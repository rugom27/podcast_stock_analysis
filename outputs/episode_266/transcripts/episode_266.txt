we want to do after they get into to college or the Olympics or whichever one comes first um so uh so that&#39;s the story so very excited about that and um these are the photos from uh by the way uh yeah these are the photos from um uh in front of fox when I went in to do fox yesterday Barney and Co that is fox and friends that&#39;s right in the front of the building that&#39;s the Christmas tree that they put up during holiday season absolutely incredible holiday spirit there&#39;s the Green Room for those of you are new listeners haven&#39;t got a chance to see this is the Green Room for not only vanney but Charles Payne and for Gutfeld that big Studio D in the back and you can see it here in the background all the cameras and the cranes and all that stuff goes into it so absolutely incredible uh today is very interesting just as I&#39;m starting to record this at 1:17 p.m. eastern time uh what are the headlines well the headlines are Dow jumps 500 points as investors rotate out of tech stocks linked uh and into stocks linked to the broader economy so tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today is what hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes is all about as you can see Google down Amazon down Nvidia down today everything else green which is moving the right direction we&#39;ll talk about some of the seasonality around these things uh and and how we&#39;re thinking about it first uh want to thank Christian dagger and the great Stu vanney for having me on Fox Business yesterday to talk about Nvidia before earnings and small caps so we&#39;re going to listen in here all in the green Thomas Hayes joins us again this morning uh he&#39;s covering the market for us today let&#39;s start with Nvidia their report after the belt what are you expecting well Nvidia is priced for Perfection at around 40 times earnings and around 40 times sales so let&#39;s hope that their earnings come in as hot as their Blackwell chips which are melting the data centers oh that&#39;s that that has that been refuted uh well the information had data they the company is telling them to realign the chips in the data center so they don&#39;t create so much heat uh you know while it is priced for Perfection there&#39;s a good chance that they pull it off this quarter the key is going to be the guidance moving forward but implied volatility is 8.5% what mean what&#39;s implied volatility it means the amount that the stock is expected to move on earnings so that&#39;s going to be a $300 billion swing either up or down on a $3.6 trillion stock what do you think is going to happen I you going opinion on this uh look we don&#39;t own the stock I think it&#39;s priced for Perfection you know there was a time when you owned Nvidia and uh the multiple went down as the stock price went up because the profit margins kept going up the profit margins are no longer going up so maybe they eek out a couple more quarters of of stock growth but I think at the end of the day as the multiple continues to expand and the profit margins stay where they are and and year on year on the quarterly revenu is only growing 4 4 billion which is amazing but 40 times sales it&#39;s it&#39;s not in our uh it&#39;s not in our wheelhouse so buying today would be a risk indeed okay don&#39;t answer the question okay uh we&#39;ve always you&#39;ve been hot on small caps that&#39;s right I want you to tell me what is the best small cap ETF for our viewers out there many of whom are interested in this sector of the market yeah I think the easiest way to play small caps as a basket which worked very well in Trump 1.0 after the election and into 2017 is iwm that&#39;s the Russell 2000 ETF easy to get broad broad-based exposure uh we like to own some individual companies but I think that&#39;s an easy way easy basket for people to get involved got it then that&#39;s the ey shares Russell 2000 Index uh iwm okay Tom thanks for being with us this morning we appreciate it thank you very much and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I had the pleasure to join David Lynn on the David Lynn report and this is these are just phenomenal interviews he&#39;s got such a large engaged audience I invariably get two or two to four phone calls every time I do his podcast and um uh we really go into detail the the perceptions of the Trump Administration versus the reality of the Trump Administration and uh and where to look in the pockets of opportunity moving forward this is a great one we&#39;re going to listen in now we are going to see nominal GDP run at levels that we have not seen in decades I think as you look two years out I could see I could see four five six handles like we haven&#39;t seen in ages do not be surprised after this initial short-term weakness or spike in yields that we get a bid in treasuries following the inauguration in that last last for some time so these are some things that people are not expecting and like we say in the business the first move is often the wrong move Thomas Hayes managing member of great Hill Capital returns to the show we&#39;ll be breaking down his analysis of the economy the markets and what&#39;s happening with the markets into the new year welcome back to the show Thomas congratulations on getting another good call you&#39;ve been right on the rally and it looks like the rally is sustained up until now a bit of a pullback today on Friday 1.9 1.29% drop on the S&amp;P 500 is of noon eastern time the NASDAQ down 2% so this week&#39;s looking like a losing week Thomas uh we&#39;ll talk about that welcome back thank you thanks for having me David great to be here so losing week um it feels like of course we&#39;re you know short-term Focus this is this has only been a couple days since Trump won but it looks like the Trump Foria has been fading this week uh was there just a short-term fade short-term trade what happened here yeah I think the initial reaction was a lot of people were offsides into the election and had to chase up and then this is a consolid ation of the games that we saw if you look at seasonality since 1932 if you look at the road map uh this is pretty normal into about the third week after that initial pop off the election that relief rally that kind of certainty the uncertainty clearing uh type of rally you do get some weakness into late October around the third third and a half week and then you tend to persist with strength year end rally into the inauguration now uh we got something for everyone here for for those people who uh who don&#39;t love Trump well the first six months after the inauguration in after an election it tends to be sideways to a grind down for those who love Trump uh you get that rally into the inauguration six months a sideways and then the second half of the Year tends to be a very strong rally in that first year of a presidential cycle but the the good news or bad news depending you look at it is that&#39;s the average since 1932 whether you have a democrat or a republican in power so I think what&#39;s going to be new here David is what is perceived to work under the new Trump Administration and what has actually worked under the previous Trump Administration if you want to go into some of that well is there anything he&#39;s proposing that&#39;s dramatically new um in its respect to how it may impact the markets uh well people think the 60% tariffs with China is new uh this is what he ran on in 2016 and interestingly enough the minute after he was elected in 2016 what you saw um there was some weakness of emerging markets and Chinese stocks into the election I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know that that was predicting a trump win in 2016 very few people were uh but that weakness persisted into the inauguration so the months of November and the months of December in 2016 emerging markets were weak China was weak China Tech was weak and then following the inauguration we had one of the biggest rallies in the shortest amount of time in history in emerging markets in China Tech in Chinese equities despite him running on protectionist tariffs and being the Tariff King so I think the surprise for 20 25 will be that these stocks start to do exceptionally well after the election despite the consensus that they will remain weak and they&#39;re they&#39;re weak into the inauguration on the basis that that tariffs are coming the other thing that&#39;s happening David that we&#39;re seeing right now that we saw in 2016 as well is the US dollar rallied like crazy on the election into the inauguration and then completely rolled over the following six months you had a weakening like you hadn&#39;t seen in a long time from January 2017 through the summer of 2017 and then the final one that&#39;s going to be the Shocker is everyone thinks yields are going to blow out because Trump is going to deficit spend and he&#39;s going to lower taxes and the exact same thing happened in 2016 he was elected in November yields blew out until the inauguration and then you saw a big reversal bonds started to get bid yields compressed the entire first year of the presidency and uh basically the 10-year yield during that time this this set of circumstances will be slightly different was between 1.29 and 3.2 if you could imagine during his presidency but uh certainly this time that the range will be higher but do not be surprised after this initial short-term weakness or spike in yields that we get a bid in treasuries following the inauguration and that lasts for some time so these are some things that people are not expecting and like we say in the business the first move is often the wrong move before we continue with the video let me tell you about a growing threat and risk to your personal safety that you should be aware of over the last decade politically motivated online threats have surged especially around recent election Cycles with the conclusion of the 2024

down uh these asset classes that we&#39;ve talked about so starting with the um the the last one yields so you&#39;re right uh let me just pull up my screen here and we can take a look at exactly what happened in 2017 this is the chart of the US ten year yield uh Trump&#39;s last inauguration January 2017 was here uh yields had a blowout like you said uh went down um and then went back up now I wonder how much of this decline from 18 to 19 uh 20 basically 2018 to 20 was a result of the tariffs people just offloading um on US dollar and and offloading on uh treasury assets here we go 20182 this is the US dollar here so similar decline they followed each other US dollar the 10year yield uh was this a result of an escalation of tariffs with China or was this a result of just uh the bond market uh reacting to other forces here yeah I mean it look it can always be a combination but but the key thing is he ran there there was not a surprise here in that he ran on tariffs and the market was expecting tariffs so the market is a discounting me mechanism and tends to act much before it actually happen so he had been talking about it since 2016 and I think you got me looking at uh here January 2017 and this is March 18th yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re talking about here you you saw a uh spike in the dollar and then weakness in the dollar following the inauguration and I think if you look at commercial positioning right now David I I think I was on your show in October of 2023 when everyone was selling Bonds in the ho yields were out and I was saying buy bonds buy by bonds by buy bonds and we had a ripy face off rally that lasted for over year okay so given your outlook on the FED funds rate what&#39;s your outlook for uh the shortterm and long-term of the yield curve well I think the biggest surprise for the second half of this year and where all of my focus is on is that there is going to be an unexpected rally in the 10year bond uh if you look at the commitments of Traders which is an important measure that we look at very carefully it works differently for different instruments but when it comes to 10-year bonds you can look and and see that the commercials have been aggressively getting long for the last couple of months they always are early and they always are right I think in the back half of the year what no one&#39;s expecting is that the 10-year is going to get bid and that&#39;s going to have a huge impact on this rotation moving forward the two key themes for the second half of this year in our view are US dollar continues to be soft and weaken and number two is the 10-year bond gets bid which compresses yields uh which has a positive impact in terms of mortgages in terms of banks in terms of RS uh and in terms of the uh rotation into small caps which the largest sector of course 21% is financials and small Banks right now commercial positioning is at an even more extreme uh uh level than that I.E uh large Traders and hedge funds are the most short that they&#39;ve been since uh 20 18 I think it was before we had a rally uh the last time the last time that you had hedge funds and large Traders this short let me know when you pull up bonds you got the dollar dollar so you&#39;re looking at 2018 yeah that&#39;s started falling in October 2018 yeah yeah so so you have an exact same situation right now commercials are aggressively long treasuries meaning they expect yield to come in hedge funds and large Traders are shorting in the hole so so this is consistent with what we saw in 2016 after the election and before the inauguration yields blew out and then they came back in same thing same thing dollar uh straight up and then weakened after the inauguration so I think the theme is uh regardless of the noise in the short term uh bonds will get bid in 2025 dollar will weaken again resume its weakening Trend again in uh 2025 and that&#39;s going to be helpful for uh emerging markets in xus despite the current sentiment which is US exceptionalism everything in the US uh with the Trump trade it just simply didn&#39;t bear out that way yeah from 2017 through 2020 albeit uh the economy did exceptionally well in the US but not at the expense it wasn&#39;t an either or it was a both and so this is a massive move back in the last Trump presidency from November 2018 the Tang year went from 3.26 all the way down to uh about 0.5 yeah about about like a almost a almost a 300 pacis Point drop over the course of two years yeah and no and no one would have predicted that whatsoever uh and and that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about I&#39;ll tell you another shock uh if you can pull up xes with which is oil servicers okay so everyone thinks drill baby drill uh these are going to be the greatest trade of all time and uh so you had that huge Spike into the inauguration after the election and then it was the greatest short of all time if you had shorted energy oil and gas servicers uh from the inauguration over the next two years you made a fortune under the Trump 90% yeah so even if you pull what was the WTI doing during the same period I&#39;m curious okay so this uh oil didn&#39;t natur underperform to the same extent except that big you know the co was a oneoff right there away from like basically whatever it was to zero but okay um yeah even pull up XLE pull up the integrated you would think that they would be less hurt not not after the inauguration what happened to the uh miners or the the yeah the uh the the oil companies yeah basically you had more Supply you had more subdued prices than you had historically had which hurt margins uh which helped the country which helped inflation come uh be lower uh helped business helped real incomes but didn&#39;t help the energy companies because they work on margin uh and uh and their cost of production was higher than it is today and the price of oil was also a lot lower so that&#39;s not a formula to generate a lot of cash uh the other one that was a big shock uh is look at xrt retail also spiked on the expectation of a strong consumer after the election and then as you got to the inauguration uh right there in January 2017 uh you had weakness for the next year yeah that&#39;s what happened so 2016 2017 uh inauguration was yeah January 2017 and then it basically went down 12% into into the um into the trough well okay so a couple of things may be different this time so we&#39;re in a rate cutting cycle uh during the first couple of months of Trump&#39;s presidency that did not happen the Fed was not cutting rates in early 2017 I believe well let&#39;s just double check that so here&#39;s the effective uh fif fund rade 20 uh 2018 yeah actually they were in a tightening cycle the other way around um so that&#39;s one major difference the other major difference is I&#39;ll let you evaluate this but people have been calling for a recession it may just be a mood point maybe it never happens we&#39;ll see I&#39;ll let you respond to that and then the third thing is taxes it&#39;s been speculated he might be even more aggressive with tax cuts this time around so three things monetary policy uh the second thing is whether or not we&#39;re getting a recession there was no recession in 2017 2018 and then number three um taxes how do these forces impact the general markets okay so monetary policy pull up xlu and XLV xlu first which is interest rate sensitive it&#39;s utilities yeah everyone would think this would be a train wreck under Trump and what what did you see you saw weakness after the election and then after the inauguration uh complete rally for the next year yeah okay so uh this is consistent with bonds getting bid dollar weakening all that stuff after the inauguration so as as it relates to monetary policy that will be supportive yields lower uh it will be supportive for dollar weaker however I do think the terminal rate and we&#39;ve said this a bit on your show we believe this was a midcycle adjustment we think there&#39;s many more years in this bull market and um therefore the the terminal rate is probably going to be a lot higher than most people had anticipated most people were looking for 3% we&#39;ve been kind of the loan voice saying it&#39;s probably going to be more like 4% because if you look back to 95 which which was a midcycle correction and some other midcycle Corrections in the late 60s uh they didn&#39;t have to go more than about 150 basis points to get to uh an acceptable nonrestrictive stance uh and I think that&#39;s going to be the case this time as well uh XLV is Health Care same thing everyone&#39;s selling it off today on the basis of RFK Junior taking over and uh you know some expectation that no one&#39;s ever going to take medicine or vaccine again yeah I didn&#39;t see that that was a a 10% drop in the last two days yeah so if you go back to 2016 you&#39;ll see it did the same thing after the election and before the inauguration weakness and then uh strength for the next year uh you got to go further up uh there you go yeah November yeah November straight down into the inauguration of January 2017 no yeah now you&#39;re there okay yeah now to January 2017 and then after the inauguration straight up right so again all of these things you know what else did the same thing Believe It or Not Arc arkk the thing that is absolutely blown up she could have she could Rise Like a Phoenix From the Ashes here in this environment as rate as bonds get bid yields go down so she had weakness after the election and then straight up for the next year uh plus so um so you said monetary policy you said uh uh cutting the taxes this is an enormous deal this is the white swan that people aren&#39;t putting enough emphasis on with the sweep which was only confirmed basically 2448 hours ago even though it was pointing in the direction uh if you take the tax rate from 21% down to 15% your tax expense uh is reduced by about 29% which would imply in the short term earnings estimates are too low at 275 and they should be reated over $300 per share on the basis of just that tax benefit then if you apply the multiplier effect of the reinvested capital over the next couple of years you start to look towards 325 350 and no one has that in their numbers right now so I think that uh people are underestimating earnings power earnings growth earnings broadening under the Trump Administration and that uh now that you have a sweep the 15% corporate tax rate is almost a foregone conclusion and that&#39;s going to have a material impact that would never in a million years pass if the Democrats held on to the house so uh that is an underrated White Swan event as it relates to earnings and makes the market which seems like it&#39;s pricey right now start to look a lot more reasonable if you add back uh the reating of earnings okay so the last couple of jobs reports were pretty positive um we&#39;re working with the assumption that uh this data is pointing towards a soft Landing uh I think a lot of people even on my show have kind of given up the recession narrative where do you stand that&#39;s that&#39;s I I bring that up because as I said earlier in 2017 Trump wasn&#39;t facing a recession Prospect yeah so I I think we&#39;ve covered this on your show in 20203 and basically everyone was waiting for the recession and I got on your show and I said no this October 2023 this this is a buy opportunity because the recession that everyone&#39;s waiting for already happened and if you look back to q1 and Q2 2023 you had two quarters of negative GDP growth that is a technical recession the government never acknowledged that it was a recession but that is the definition of a technical recession so the recession that everyone&#39;s waiting for has already happened and usually you get a recession once every four and a half years the problem is we had one in 2020 and then we had a second one in 2022 uh first two quarters of 2022 excuse me uh first two quarters of negative GDP growth and so you basically had 8.2 years of recessions in two-year period which is why you could go a handful of years without another recession uh it was just pulled forward and I think that&#39;s what people are missing now so soft Landing no uh hard Landing how about no land ing uh how about we just hit an earnings trough in Q3 of 2024 and we&#39;re going to start reaccelerating earnings growth uh led by the unmagnify over the Magnificent 7 magnificent 7even earnings growth has decelerated from the first quarter of 2024 at 50% earnings growth to now in the mid teens earnings growth that&#39;s going to continue to stay in the mid to low teens uh 93 has had negative earnings growth in q1 and Q2 just inflected positive and will start to re accelerate into the low teens earnings growth in 2025 so that broadening is going to be a general sense of well-being growth and excitement in the economy not just a handful of companies driving the bus okay uh you brought up Arc so let me just bring up uh tech stocks since uh Arc is kind of tech heavy uh still so the uh this is the NASDAQ Composite January 2017 to its peak um in October 18 up 48% um I just I&#39;m curious what the Russell did during that same time period here uh 2017 January uh all the way up to the peak 25% the Russell actually underperform the NASDAQ during the same period okay um your view on tech stocks overall I know you brought up Arc um Tesla shot up to the Moon uh in recent weeks um you know mainly because of Elon Musk with the administration now uh but this is what happened with Tesla it went up about 40% in the matter of a week um so I don&#39;t know if that has to do with the fundamentals of tech stocks or more to do with politics but I&#39;ll let you address this yeah I think this is going to be a surprise for a lot of people whether you look at ARK or ffty which is the IBD 50 momo stocks um during that period or xlk or even SMH for semiconductors all did exceptionally well under Trump so uh small caps did also did well but they pulled forward a lot of the games in those two months right after the election if you look at it it was that huge rally off the November lows and then it Consolidated for that six months before uh resuming higher so I think that&#39;s the surprise and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to emphasize people think oh it&#39;s only an energy and Industrials game and Banks game but actually energy was a short of a lifetime in the Trump administ ation after the inauguration and Tech did well Arc did well semis did well equal weighted small caps did well China you know what else did much better under Trump than under Biden pull up T solar stocks okay this is not my neck of the woods but you know if we&#39;re just being objective uh take a look at what happened from 2017 to 2020 wow uh and 90% yeah yeah and then if you look at the Biden Administration from 20 21 through 2024 uh you know not not no bueno and this is another misconception people will have going into the Trump Administration thinking they know it&#39;s going to work under Trump and it&#39;s for the most part the exact opposite of what they&#39;re expecting now Industrials did well Staples did well discretionary did well financials did well most things did well the one thing the two things that stand out uh that didn&#39;t do well which is surprising is is energy and Retail stocks xrt you can pull that up um and biotech did well by the way biotech did well so uh health I was gonna say it looked like a lot of defensive sectors did well but it wasn&#39;t just defensive I mean some of these things you&#39;re you&#39;re pointing out to aren&#39;t offensive at all uh but yeah okay up 20% I think the wild card I wanted to address with you is uh um we talked about terrorists but the escalation of trade Wars in general and more protectionism would it Force China and some other competing Nations to uh I I I would say buy less of American Goods uh Tech right China has you know in last four year Cycles they they&#39;ve greatly Advanced their own Tech sector they don&#39;t need the the argument is they don&#39;t need apple or American chips anymore they can just make their own yeah look I think the conversation is gonna go something like this Mr G Mr xan ping uh you&#39;re taxing us massively on everything that we put into your country we&#39;re going to just match it so we&#39;re going to start at 60% we can go if you want to uh tip for Tat and go up to 100% we&#39;ll go up to 100% too if you want to go down to 30% we&#39;ll go down to 30% oh and by the way Mr gin ping if you want to have zero we&#39;ll do zero as well how does that sound and that&#39;s basically how the conversation&#39;s going to go so my guess is xiin Ping is initially not going to want to negotiate so Trump will just match him where he is which will look like 60% if you look at all the objective uh data out there what it shows is if in fact Trump uh initiated a 60% tariff on all Chinese Goods it would hurt Chinese GDP by two full percentage points so it would move from 5% down to 3% which is still in line or slightly better than the US is doing right now so bad news for China but not devastating news for China because when I first heard 60% like everyone else I I thought wow that would put them in a Great Depression they would be down you know their GDP would be negative 5% it would be you know uh uh train wreck it&#39;s simply not the case they become more consumption driven more internally driven so um I think the beauty of the Trump Administration why Chinese stocks did so well after the Trump Inauguration in 2016 to 2018 is because Trump is not an idealogue it&#39;s not uh we have to start a cold war with China just because their econom is growing it&#39;s let&#39;s get a deal done that benefits Americans americ an first uh we want to create jobs in America but we got to do a deal and it&#39;s not about creating the next Cold War it&#39;s about just getting more money for Americans and I think that&#39;s a different framework than the previous administration had which was China&#39;s bad period no need to talk they&#39;re they&#39;re our enemy they&#39;re they&#39;re our threat uh and uh and I think Trump just wants to do business I I just want to talk about retail one more time since you brought up xrt so January 2017 uh in the months following the last inauguration of trump uh the xrt went down about uh 14% to it off before climbing back it didn&#39;t seem like the tax cuts worked in terms of stimulating consumer demand is that right well if you remember the tax cuts took a while to pass okay so it was a long process to get that through I think it was towards the end of the year that they finally got that done so um I I I don&#39;t think that has an immediate uh direct implication and don&#39;t forget that wouldn&#39;t kick in and put more money in the taxpayers pocket until the following year when they filed and got their returns and all of that now it might change expectations it might change sentiment it might change all of that but the the point that I&#39;m trying to drive home is um how people are thinking about the Trump Administration is completely different than what actually happened in Trump one and the uh policies and the Outlook and the appointments are really no different it&#39;s the same Red Hat they added one number to the side of it and uh same policies effectively the same proxies and I think you&#39;ll see the same result which is that uh it&#39;s it&#39;s an environment where Wall Street certainly does well but for the first time in decades Main Street was absolutely humming if you remember from 2016 to 2019 the average middle class person was feeling so much better small business business owners real incomes were going up and uh it&#39;s that type of excitement I think that you&#39;re going to see uh start to be felt next year and for the next three four years where everyone&#39;s participating versus just the people at the top what&#39;s the nfib uh latest uh small business optimism index showing right now you you know the sentiment indicators that I&#39;ve looked at are just starting to turn up for the first time in the last handful of weeks or months so I think that trend is going to persist under Trump even if you look at uh institutional managers while they&#39;ve become more enthusiastic they&#39;re not quite at euphoric periods if you look at the Bank of America fund manager survey they look like managers usually look coming out of deep troughs but not yet at Peak excitement Peak sentiment Peak positioning and I think the same is true for the consumer confidence which has been really low because of the price of groceries and different things that affect their every day lives is just now starting to turn in the right direction as as incomes are slowly starting to catch up and now on optimism On A Renewed set of uh different policies I I want to bring up one more step before we go uh Thomas just want to get your reaction to this this is an opet written by uh former FDIC chair Sheila bear I actually had the um uh pleasure of speaking with her this week anyway this was an uped she wrote CFA Institute recently surveyed over 4,000 of its members on the state of us finances um super majority 77% believe the US finances were on an unsustainable trajectory a significant majority 61% believe that the US lacks of political will to reduce its debt to GDP ratio while 63 believed we will begin to lose our Reserve currency status within the next 5 to 15 years first of all do you are you in this camp at all and does this sentiment have anything to have any effect long-term and or short-term effect on the bond market yeah two things number one they misspelt her her last name on the article I think they have it as b a i r it should be b a r I&#39;ve watched her interviews for the last 10 years and she&#39;s consistently bearish uh so I&#39;ll leave it I&#39;ll leave that number two you&#39;ve got Elon and Viet coming in that are doing something that hasn&#39;t been done for decades if if ever uh which is they think they can cut$ two trillion dollars a cost let&#39;s say they&#39;re wrong and they can only do1 trillion dollar of cost that&#39;s deflationary there&#39;s going to be a lot of people unemployed uh out of government jobs as they cut down different uh um uh agencies and they cut cut a lot of those jobs until they get absorbed into the private sector then you&#39;re also going to have an issue with uh labor different supply of labor than we&#39;ve had in the last four years as the Border gets closed up and maybe some people uh are returned back but certainly as the Border gets closed up so I think that um I think we&#39;re going to see a situ sitation where the terminal rate is higher than anticipated at 4% and I think inflation is going to be higher than anticipated they&#39;ll keep keep talking about 2% to pin inflation expectations but they know it you know it I know it everyone knows it they&#39;ve got to run inflation hotter in order to bring the debt to GDP ratio debt back down from 120 to a more reasonable level like we did after World War II from 1948 to 1956 we took it from 120 down to 53 and in those years inflation ran between 3 to 5% pretty consistently and you had hot nominal GDP growth which is exactly what we&#39;re going to see under the Trump Administration we are going to see nominal GDP run at levels that we have not seen in decades I think as you look two years out I could see I could see four five six handles like we haven&#39;t seen in ages and that will be do a lot to bring the ratio Down based on these policies that&#39;s nominal GDP what about real GDP what about inflation adjusted is inflation gonna catch up you think I think inflation is gonna be higher than 2% I think it&#39;s gonna be I think the mean is gonna be 33 three three5 somewhere in that for the next five years and if we do that then then debt to GDP comes down and all the she Sheila b AR articles uh will be solved it&#39;s reasonable to have that fear I mean if you look at the numbers objectively today people should be worried uh I think that the country is worried enough that um you know the uh the voting electorate looked like a pizza not uh not blue raspberry Jello I mean when you looked at the map the country went red and it swept and it&#39;s why because they believed that uh in the short term that election could get these things in order now now we get to see if they were right and uh if in fact we can get our fiscal house in order but it certainly seems like if anyone could get it done uh Elon and vvec would be the people you&#39;d want to tap okay so that aside um let let&#39;s assume you&#39;re right so government becomes more efficient um what you know we we&#39;ll come back to that another time let&#39;s see how that plays out but let let&#39;s just address inflation before we go so you brought up inflation going north of 2% so this is what happened during the last Trump presidency hovering above 2% for most of the term there was there were periods when the CPI headline CPI was down below 2% uh but the the I&#39;m pointing this out because it didn&#39;t Spike considerably due to uh Trump&#39;s protectionist policies I&#39;m hearing a lot of this in the media the fear that inflation is going to go way back up because of tariffs that didn&#39;t really happen last time well the key thing there what&#39;s what&#39;s the key input cost to everything is energy yeah you&#39;re right energy was deflationary for some some parts of uh the last Trump presidency um yeah and it was coming off much higher levels too from 2011 to 2014 energy was really high in terms of price uh and uh and it was more normalized under Trump because Supply increased and he was blocked on some of the things to get supply going if you recall with the pipelines with the anoir with uh the opening up the different government things he&#39;s not going to have those type of restrictions certainly in the first two years of his presidency so there is a lot that he can get done that will be deflationary and and very very positive and very productive for the for the country so um so Allin it&#39;s a good economic formula I just think that um if if history is any prolog from 1932 till today uh continued strength after this short-term November weekness into like after Thanksgiving uh into the inauguration stock should be up and then that six months it will have to consolidate while the market figures out policy the appointments and everything else uh before resuming uh some strength second half of the first year of the uh election cycle all right well you

we&#39;re back and then let&#39;s get down to some of the quotes of the week here uh as we kick in David teer who by the way one of the greatest of all time in my view uh and and empirically by the way that that helps too uh his number one position is now Alibaba and what David terer says is we keep our cool when others don&#39;t the point is markets adapt people adapt don&#39;t listen to all the crap out there so he&#39;s not known for his eloquence but uh he gets the point across and that&#39;s how Jersey Boys do it uh Warren Buffett in in the world of business the people who are most successful are those doing what they love and Seth claran it turns out that value investing is something in your blood there are people who just don&#39;t have the patience and discipline to do it and there are people who do so it leads me to think it&#39;s genetic the older I get the more I realize it&#39;s 100% genetic uh certainly you got to learn the core skills but uh there&#39;s some things that can never be taught and you find that out quickly our brand portfolio is the best in the industry says Stanley Black and Decker CEO Donald Allen Jr so excited about this one by the way uh they&#39;ve been putting in a base for a year year and a half uh and they&#39;re going to get rocking as uh as rates go lower over time but he was on with Kramer this week for an phenomenal interview where he laid out the plan to two and a half billion dollars of eida by 2027 basically two years away just to put that in perspective I think it&#39;s the stock is 80 it&#39;s probably up a little today but call it an $85 90 stock um been bouncing around between 80 and 100 for you know a year and a half and um the last time that the business did 2 well they they never did 2.5 billion but the last time they did anything close 2.3 billion of Bida was in 2021 and the stock price traded to $200 a share so well more than a double from here he&#39;s not talking about 2.3 he&#39;s talking about 2.5 billion and the plan hasn&#39;t changed since we got involved we&#39;re super excited so listen in here today Stanley Black and Decker the iconic power tool maker held an investor event here at the New York Stock Exchange with they laid out some exciting long-term targets for the business okay it&#39;s been a difficult stock to own I know over the past couple months something we know because we own it for the chapel trust da blacking Decker roared into the fed&#39;s First Rate cut because historically when the FED Cuts short rates wow long rates come down mortgages get cheaper people spend more on anything housing related this time the bond bond market didn&#39;t play ball and and long rates are actually up from when the FED first moved plus when Stanley Black and deer Reports most recent quarter management did talk about headwinds understood persisting into 2025 and of course were worried about the impact of potential trade war and tariffs so in less than two months the stock went from 110 to 85 and change I still think it works over the long term as I would would certainly wouldn&#39;t own the stock but let&#39;s check in with Don Allen he&#39;s the president show sty bck and Decker get a better sense of where the company&#39;s headed Mr Alan welcome back to M money it&#39;s great to be here Jim all right so D you had a big big meeting and you talked about a lot of very exciting long-term goals uh and I think it&#39;s pretty across the board that you want to make things let&#39;s say bigger and better so so why don&#39;t you give us a sense of some of the things you talked about because over the long term I think things are going to go very well here yeah so we spent uh about 3 hours with our key investors and a variety of other analysts that were either in person or on virtually and we focused on really making sure that folks understood how we were going to finish the supply chain transformation but more importantly what we were going to do to drive more value with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and get our evaa initially up to 2.5 billion by 2027 and then we see opportunity to go beyond that after 2027 and it&#39;s really going to be driven by we think will be you know probably a modest growth story in the short term but over time gaining more market share in DeWalt gaining market share in Stanley branded products and Craftsman and then driving more opportunities in the supply chain around product platforming better strategic sourcing etc etc so we were really excited about telling that story today that allowed us to really get people to focus on a longer period of Time Versus just the next 12 months well let&#39;s talk about the the brands I really want to focus on tools and outdoor for a moment you know it&#39;s dealt Craftsman Stanley Black and Decker cupy that which I know personally these are unbelievable Brands and a lot of times we think and I know I am definitely of this opinion these brands are bigger than the company&#39;s stock price so to speak you know they&#39;re they&#39;re remarkable brands that everybody knows and could you explain to people like how important they are I mean on the Lowe&#39;s call they talked about the being the biggest products and and and did did somehow things get lost in translation we start talking about tariffs we talk about rates we don&#39;t talk about the brands which are the best in the industry how do we kind of we Jive the two so to speak the portfolio brands that we&#39;ve created Jim is the best in the industry so we start with our dewal brand which is the pro brand for the construction industry it is the best professional construction brand out there today and then we have the Stanley brand which is for trades and professional construction and occasionally to do it yourself which is more oriented around hand tools versus the wal it&#39;s more power tool oriented and then Craftman is kind of the the do-it-yourself Enthusiast the person that works in their garage Works around their lawn and these three brands fit incredibly well together in a strategy and there&#39;s nobody in our industry that has the power of these three brands and when you look at these other brands here like Lennox Irwin black and&amp; Decker and CubCadet they&#39;re what we call Specialty brands that allow us to be targeted in certain niches certain markets they&#39;re not as broad as the three big Brands but they&#39;re very unique and they&#39;re very specialized and they differentiate themselves as well it is how hard to outrun the story of how rat didn&#39;t come down housing no you it&#39;s the worst housing market for turnover in 30 years and we also don&#39;t understand exactly what is going to happen with tariffs you can&#39;t necessarily go blow things out if those things aren&#39;t working in your favor that&#39;s exactly right I think that I think we all agree that long term this is a great industry interest rates will eventually come down to a level where mortgages are closer to 5% which I think is an important hurdle for us to get to which will free up more repair and remodel it&#39;ll free up more home sales new home construction and housing starts that will really allow this industry to get back in a much stronger place than it has been all right now let&#39;s talk about one that&#39;s strong and one that&#39;s not you&#39;ve got of some incredible things going in in Fasteners in Arrow but you also have Auto and auto slow you can&#39;t give away one point I just said oh why isn&#39;t Don just get rid of the auto but you don&#39;t want to sell that at a trough and arrow is just terrific but I kind of feel like it the the great nature of it gets lost in the shuffle of the brands I don&#39;t know yeah the auto Fastener business is very much a v business so when it goes down it goes down hard right when it recovers which interesting enough I think what&#39;s going to make this business recover is lower their lower interest rates because it&#39;s affecting you know car purchases as well so as that changes then I think you&#39;re going to start to see a v recovery where the business goes up fast that be and if you look at the previous recessions for that business that&#39;s exactly what they experienced all right so tell me as a shareholder and I&#39;ve told many people in the club this is the you know best stock for the longterm what do you say for people right now who are saying you know what I don&#39;t know I mean I didn&#39;t hear anything that says that next year is going to be a breakout you&#39;re 2027 maybe but uh but it&#39;s worth holding I mean what do we say well I think one of the things that we tried to get across to people today is that there&#39;s the power of the cash flow of this company that we&#39;ve kind of really brought back to the last two years and going to continue to do that next year and Beyond um which allows us to get our leverage where we want it to be and eventually buy back our stock so that&#39;s an important part of the strategy that we be focus on the other thing is that yeah there&#39;s going to be some short-term things like tariffs to navate $200 million head which is a big headwin but you know what you know we think we have a plan that we can execute on we&#39;ve already started to talk to some of our customers about price increases I&#39;ve spent a lot of time in DC talking to the new Administration and really making sure that we have a voice at the table around the Tariff process I completely understand what president Trump&#39;s trying to do with tariffs but I wonder if it&#39;s really something that shouldn&#39;t be broad-based but more specific to certain industries where Chinese products are more challenging coming into the US market that&#39;s not say our case right and and we&#39;re power tools and hand tools and those types of things 50% of what we sell in the US we make in the US and 25% of what we make in or what we sell in the US we make in Mexico and the remaining portion comes from China and Asia well it&#39;s much different from the way it used to be the reing has been important and you&#39;ve been working on this for a long time to me I look it&#39;s I think that all these things are momentary and we have to think longer term and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to stick with the stock excellent thank you so much to Don Allen president of Stanley Black and Decker you know their brands you&#39;ve all used them you know how good they are everybody&#39;s p and we&#39;re back now we&#39;re going to go on to some of the data here Disney shot the lights out absolutely phenomenal uh earnings which we covered last week China&#39;s economy St stabilizes after stimulus and we saw that in earnings which we&#39;re going to talk about in depth um look at China&#39;s um retail sales results by the way I got my balst straw shirt on thanks to my buddy Mike Bennett absolutely love it um so here&#39;s retail sales from China then we&#39;ve got retail fund inflows have driven money assets to record money market have driven money fund assets to record so there&#39;s still a tremendous amount of cash on the sideline that&#39;s getting forced in and you&#39;re seeing it in spades on like this and by the way it&#39;s so interesting obviously Cooper standard having a good day but uh the little sleeper that no one that that could uh I remember getting all the ask me anything questions call uh coming in on uh com stock resources when it dropped down to eight and change and everyone&#39;s like are you sure you still like this I was like yeah the intrinsic value is only $40 plus doll a share uh I really don&#39;t care about the thing moving a buck and now it&#39;s up to6 and just getting started uh 6 1565 I mean things up 50% in a handful of weeks so um okay International e-commerce revenue is growing while core segments stagnate so uh this is kind of a a an analyst um analysis here we we going to we&#39;re going to drill down first and foremost tbal and t-all uh revenues were up and when in looking at Pin duo duo the parent to teu uh which I said for many months the numbers are either unsustainable or unreliable they absolutely crapped the bed this morning and why because of fierce competition from whom from tawau and t-all keeping their share fending off the threat of them selling garbage stuff at low prices and as the consumer men&#39;s guess where the money is going it&#39;s going to the higher quality uh uh providers like tbow and t-o and as as the Chinese economy hums they don&#39;t want to buy the cheap Chinese crap they want to buy the high quality foreign luxury goods luxury Brands and uh and and tound and t-o is not going to grow 1% they&#39;re going to start growing five and 10 Perc Cloud shot the lights out we&#39;ll get into that absolutely incred 89 their eida was up 89% year onye uh revs were up nicely as well International continues to grow like crazy 30% or 29% and then these smaller businesses did just fine so we&#39;ll get into that retail sales was driven by what uh motor vehicle and part dealers this was the best component they also electronics and compli and appliance stores best component of which reminds me I got to go back and take a look at whirl poool uh we haven&#39;t done anything there but uh uh so new cars and part dealers so advance and uh Cooper standard on that pretty excited corporate profit margins near record highs I don&#39;t you know I&#39;m a mean reversion guy I think these can stay pretty accelerated with some of the Tailwinds with tack with AI with all the other stuff uh that&#39;s happening so that&#39;s a positive sign economic prize index City Group absolute positive sign Japan going through the floor same thing I&#39;ve been telling you guys all the money&#39;s going to flow out of Japan all Japan was was a money market for Asian investors that didn&#39;t want to be in China and India was uh um ahead of itself way ahead of itself in terms of valuations definitely the future of Asia more so than China but the next three to five years belongs to China One Last parabolic move and then we&#39;ll take the profits from Baba and start to find opportunities in India Japan absolutely not their demographics are toast no matter how cheap their stocks are there unless their most of their revenues come from abroad I&#39;m completely uninterested plus the the yuan is the uan the yen is going to appreciate um which is going to hurt them more leading economic indicators and real GDP moving up in the right direction this is all from yard Denny these green charts truck tonnage picking back up also rail freight loads picking back up those are the key indicators that you want to be looking at from an economic standpoint here&#39;s rail car loadings turning straight up this is the stuff you saw in 2010 and 11 not 1999 not 2007 when they were at Peaks this is turning up now at the beginning of a new midcycle uh um re acceleration uh that we&#39;re going to have by getting the terminal rate down to 4% and probably not a lot lower rail car loadings uh we got more of that for motor vehicle rail car loadings are picking back up as well Intermodal rail car loadings so um and then consumer sentiment is turning up not down and you you see these things coming out of deep troughs like in the early 90s uh recession coming out of that and for those of you looking for the recession we just had two in the last four years 2020 and 2022 when we have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth in q1 and Q2 so this is what you see you see these check backs and then recoveries like 2011 just like you saw in 93 um uh and even 2001 so we are just getting started economically speaking and I think people are seeing the pro business deregulatory policies tax-friendly policies moving forward are going to be so great for the economy and it&#39;s not just going to be the people at the top that do well no matter what the environment you&#39;re going to see like Trump Point 1.0 where real incomes rise for everyone everyday people people doing real work will get the benefits of this type of economy which is pretty exciting to see uh consumer optimism is coming off the mat but it&#39;s moving up in the right direction and that&#39;s going to reaccelerating job openings uh are down um off of extreme once at 100y year level uh so that will keep the FED in the market continuing to ease or at least posture towards easing which guidance is sometimes as almost as important as the action itself um nonfarm business productivity growth cycle is elevated that&#39;s good manufacturing productivity starting to get back up over the zero line like you saw after World War II and you see coming out of all deep troughs used car and truck prices coming down number of Motor Vehicle light sales going up so everyone was super depressed in October now you look at the October numbers and they&#39;re tracking on a 16 million SAR when everyone&#39;s been talking about 155 let&#39;s see if that persists in November and December could be super duper exciting and as we all know what&#39;s the target uh in 2017 got up to mid to high 17s it depends on the data source here here&#39;s light motor vehicles but got up to the high 17s the company earned Cooper standard earned $7 a share traded 146 we&#39;re going to get there ladies and gentlemen the difference is we&#39;re going to earn a lot more than $7 a share and we&#39;re super excited about that Domestic Auto inventory to sales ratio this is what we want to see moving up off a depression like the Cash for Clunkers error like the 2001 error moving up in the right direction fits and starts are normal and then you get to where you need to go us Motor Vehicle sales uh let&#39;s see moving up to that 16 million again so you had that check back over the summer that everyone got nervous about it has been sideways for a year I think we&#39;re going to break out here and move back up towards 17 and Cooper standard is going to Mint money like uh tra you could call Cooper standard the new treasury secretary they&#39;re going to print so much money it&#39;s going to be insane uh uh China nominal versus real retail sales ticking up China real retail sales growth ticking up not down up despite all the headlines uh nominal GDP versus M1 okay so this is the name of the game they got to get money supply going like this is this is economics 101 and guess what&#39;s happening it bottomed a few months ago it&#39;s turning up um same exact thing you saw in late um uh back in 2016 to 2017 turning up here once again M2 is turning up in China not down that&#39;s a positive thing M2 growth rate same thing consumer confidence in the US turning up this is all moving in the right direction China PMI turning up China foreign direct investment flows turning up from negative turning up not down ladies and gentlemen and then here are the two most important charts of the week as it relates to um Cooper standard look at what&#39;s happening to incentives ladies and gentlemen it keeps climbing every month it went to 7.7 and what&#39;s happening to prices they&#39;re leveling off maybe going a little bit down that&#39;s the name of the game we want we don&#39;t care about the margins that the oems make they should be erased to the bottom they had these housian days where they could control Supply during covid and rip people off by charging 10% above MSRP and play a a bad game on the public well now that game has changed they are going to be producing themselves like it&#39;s going out of style more cars than ever at lower margins than ever and Cooper standard is going to be putting the door ceiling the window ceiling the fluid transfer systems to Fuel Delivery Systems in every single one and God forbid Trump actually makes interest payments on new cars tax deductible uh we may see a a cycle top like we never seen before meaning over 188 million s seasonally adjusted annual rate and uh that is not in our models but certainly quite possible especially when you consider the average car on the road 13 years old it could be staggering deal track credit availability index you can see all the antidotes if you follow car car dealer on Twitter uh basically saying as soon as Trump got elected all the spets turned back on they are doing loans like it&#39;s going out of style subprime Prime doesn&#39;t matter if you have a heartbeat you&#39;re getting a loan for a car that&#39;s what we want to see for Cooper standard uh 75y year high in stocks vers US Stocks versus rest of the world this is the type of concentration where you want to take the other side You&#39; seen it two times in history once you had the opportunity in 67 to buy emerging markets in xus and dramatically outperform and the second time was in 2001 and you absolutely rocked the world as you saw uh money move out of um uh move back into emerging markets in next us and we&#39;re going to see that and that doesn&#39;t have to mean the US does poorly at all the us is going to do fine if I had to guess for next year I think earnings growth will probably be 13 14% I think the S&amp;P will probably be up 8 to 12% and I think fortunes will be made under the surface in the US and uh xus in emerging markets in China will be through the roof so um uh exactly the opposite of what everyone is saying right now just like in late 2016 to early 2017 in Trump one after the election and before the inauguration which we covered with um David so by the way check out his Channel at David [Music] Lynn uh on YouTube B of A Bull and Bear indicator again it&#39;s enthusiastic but it&#39;s not at a peak level yet um trading Tina Turner so here&#39;s from haret flow show uh okay what he says is what turns the trade before the inauguration day is further tightening in financial conditions Global mael most likely driver of higher FCI as companies front running tariffs uh October China export growth was the fastest since July of 2022 China has massively reoriented exports destinations California port volume volumes right now are jumping Port of Long Beach Imports a record high in October no asset allocators increasing bonds and international stocks right now but we say allocators heading into 1q uh 2025 should lean into bu treasuries okay we couldn&#39;t agree more if uh less and this is the thing that&#39;s mindboggling to me he&#39;s got two of the most efficient people effective people in the world in musk and vivc ramaswami that say they&#39;re going to cut two trillion so these guys tend to do what they say they&#39;re going to do but let&#39;s just say they don&#39;t realize what it takes to get stuff done in government and they only cut a trillion that is deflationary ladies and gentlemen deflationary not inflationary which means bonds are going to Rally next year the biggest two surprises of 2025 will be bonds rally yields compress dollar weekends no one is positioned for those and watch what happens and then the second thing that hartnet says which we again agree with buy International stocks China Europe before Inauguration Day China to ease fiscal policy and ECB to cut rates aggressively in anticipation of America First tariffs lower rates cheaper currencies lower oil prices means big easing of financial conditions in Asia and Europe relative to the US bare sentiment soon to approach buy humiliation levels here we are ladies and gentlemen so excited about that uh strong China export growth uh to to the rest of the world so while uh exports to us EU and Japan have gone down rest of the world are skyrocketing once again and uh and that&#39;s the name of the game you know all these things that we do to unnaturally um change the market I.E cut them off of chips Etc now they now they&#39;re developing their own chips before they used to be dependent on us like you know and now we&#39;ve made them independent and they&#39;re going to catch up uh um blocking the exports they&#39;ve just built stronger alliances with countries they wouldn&#39;t have paid attention to so you know you got to think second and third degree not first degree on some of these policies certainly you want to deter dangerous threats and there are ways to do that effectively but um I think we&#39;ll get a more pragmatic Administration in with big threats and then come to a table and do great deals and everything will be much better than it has been uh big government expenditures as percentage of GDP since 1791 VC and um Elon are going to knock this down we haven&#39;t seen this level since World War 2 which again we haven&#39;t seen the 120% debt to GDP since World War II and what happened it collapsed right after that same Playbook same story we&#39;ve covered it many times uh globalization to isolationism so you know for everyone that says can&#39;t do tariffs because it&#39;s going to cause a Great Depression like Smooth Holly tariffs had been climbing off a low like this from n from from the Spanish Flu 1918 for 12 years before Smoot Holly so the idea of doing some tariffs which by the way it&#39;s like oh we&#39;re unilaterally hurting these people no everything that Trump is going to do is going to say look you tax our Goods we&#39;re going to match you I mean it&#39;s very simple and and what&#39;s the cor to that if you don&#39;t want us to match you just take your tariffs down that&#39;s a simple very easy request eye for an eye tooth for a tooth and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to take place so so coming off such a low base yeah we&#39;re going to see tariffs go up for a number of years before it becomes any major issue could be 8 to 10 to 12 years out if that persists and if the counterparties don&#39;t cooperate by bringing it down to zero it&#39;s a very thoughtful strategy versus like in fairness Trump has said for since 1980 on Oprah they&#39;ve been ripping us off for years and we continue to take it and we&#39;re not going to take it anymore and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to happen for the next four years certainly the next two years so uh disinflation demographics peak in 2028 this is the world dependency ratio minus the economically dependent population uh the so that that&#39;s going to be an interesting fact Factor uh money market fund assets to all-time high 6.7 trillion to a lot of this is going to chase into markets next year so be cognizant of that uh biggest outflow from gold since July 2022 we&#39;ve been covering that for weeks we said don&#39;t chase these guys at the top and there you go I&#39;m not saying that the gold run is over I&#39;m just saying they are higher and better uses from these levels there&#39;s no question about it record outflow from China equities past five weeks that&#39;s perfect the same exact thing happened in 20 16 right after Trump was elected and what happened after the inauguration the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time in history we&#39;ll cover that this week biggest outflow from utilities since March 2015 remember everyone wanted utilities four weeks ago I said guys no uh four eight weeks ago whatever it was uh now some of them are getting very interesting again because bonds are going to get bid uh 51.4% of consumers expect stocks to be higher over the next 12 months um um funds are overweight momentum I wish this one went back further active fund position is still defensive Peak growth and expectations for the mag 7 which is interesting last time we were this high was right before the 2022 correction in Tech so for those of you you you could see what I was kind of jocking with Barney was trying to say you know trying to get me to say like uh you know about Nvidia and I&#39;m just I&#39;m like we don&#39;t own it we do not own it would you buy it we don&#39;t own it it couldn&#39;t be any clearer so uh so that&#39;s the story there and um on to the next who&#39;s left to buy the Magnificent 7 the answer is basically no one most crowded trade uh this cycle has been the most race sensitive in history five-year rolling correlation with ISM Manufacturing uh so as rates come down isms go up easing rate pressure should translate to a pickup in manufacturing this is the Trump economy manufacturing small caps Industrials Etc Wall Street Stock allocations typically fall as 10e rates move above 5% so we&#39;re below we&#39;re going to stay below not to worry we&#39;ll probably be in this range 3 to 4% on the 10year next year which increases stock allocations retail sales were up driven by cars [Music] um we covered that less cars it wasn&#39;t up that much ISM Manufacturing Empire State manufacturing uh empire state was through the roof this month and and ISM uh will catch that very very quickly Empire statement so so that&#39;s what happens you see every single time New York takes off uh ISM follows shortly there behind which is a big deal to get those manufacturing surveys up and part we covered that manufacturing activity surges in New York Region to the highest level in nearly three years uh and keep in mind manufacturers been in a Great Depression for the last two years this is a big big big news for the economy again the people that make stuff and do stuff are going to get paid which is really exciting um anyway uh daily shot Financial index conditions uh moving up uh S&amp;P 500 around close elections well this one wasn&#39;t that close but the point is it goes up uh fewer cheaper sectors left they&#39;re talking telecoms not interested uh energy we have through com stock Banks we had a great trade on we still have the uh K we&#39;ll probably let that run for for a bit more uh we made a lot of money on that because it&#39;s been uh we bought it in the hole during that Silicon Valley debacle in 2023 uh what sector sector outlook for the next so no one wants real estate and utilities and Staples I&#39;m seeing some opportuni start to pop up in those areas that&#39;s what I like everyone&#39;s cramming into financials after they&#39;ve already doubled uh and Tech after you know so again same story happens every single time uh what is this this is the cyclicality of the year oh so what he&#39;s pointing to here is you get a big draw down in or not a big draw down but you tend to get a draw down in late November which we kind of just had and then you just rip higher into the end of the year which maybe we&#39;re seeing the inflection today would be very very nice um economics e Bloomberg economics Federal Reserve sentiment model coming off the mat that&#39;s good to see deflationary grocery prices almost going below the zero bound that is a big deal prices actually did fall one10 of 1% in October the first annual drop since January 2020 Japan retail investors sold stocks last week get ready to sell more they bought at the top they&#39;re going to sell sell all the way down China retail sales value going up China industrial production up uh biggest outflow from utilities some opportunities popping up there right before rates turn and compress National Association of active investment managers they&#39;re they&#39;re exposed but it&#39;s not at an extreme yet so we could get some nice strength into year end dollar coming up against this resistance this will be a huge surprise next year it will roll back over uh CPI good uh there we go by the way I had to get three car three cars registered in uh New York before shipping a few of them out to um California and I wound up going to this garage the guy had five bays and he totally helped me out because one of them I&#39;ve been running on templates for like six months because I just didn&#39;t have time to go get it registered and uh the car was coming the next day and closed to ship it out and uh if I didn&#39;t get the inspection done this the state of New York wouldn&#39;t send me title for the vehicle uh and um so he he totally helped me out he was jammed and turns out it was Charlie gasperino a fox business&#39;s cousin uh they grew up together completely small world and uh John the other brother was saying that Charlie was the smartest guy in school growing up and a serious boxer so many of you if you watch Fox Business you know Charlie gasparino and Ellie terret who&#39;s the producer who gave me my first break on TV on the Clayman countdown five years ago she&#39;s Charlie&#39;s producer now and she&#39;s known as the crypto Queen because she&#39;s the top journalist in the in the entire crypto community so keep a lookout for her if you have interested in crypto hopefully she&#39;ll get her own show one day so um S&amp;P risk premium back to 2001 levels I love everything that points back to 2001 levels because what ripped like crazy after that small caps and Emerging Markets small business op optimism turning up [Music] um National Association of home builders housing market index is turning up the data has been very mixed on this um because of because of rates rates will come back down home building will go up uh that&#39;s going to help also Stanley which we just saw in the interview Equity issuance this is the thing you want to own the big Banks because the issuance is going to go through the roof IPOs m&amp;a all that stuff&#39;s going to be on the question is how much of that is already priced in because we had doubles on the expectation that that stuff was going to absolutely fly in 2024 and it started to pick up um but I think a lot of that news is priced in so I&#39;d love to see a big pullback in financial so we could get back in we had such a big run on BAC and uh see and took profits uh we&#39;ll see if an opportunity opens up but we never sold the uh the K with the regional Banks so um all right earning sentiment turning up we&#39;re going to take a look at that uh in a second the estimates have started going back up after being flat forever 10 US Stocks account for 20% of the entire Global index haven&#39;t seen that since the early 70s those concentrations always get worked out everyone comes up with their stories of this why this time it&#39;s different and yada yada Y and a new narrative sold by the bankers and um pushed by the journalists and it&#39;s just never it&#39;s never this time is different it&#39;s always the same so um stretch valuation US market is reflected across most standard valuation metric so you can see n in the percentiles EV to sales free cash flow yield uh Price to Book Enterprise Value to EA forward PE they&#39;re all in the 95th to 100th percentile free cash yield is the only thing that&#39;s cheap 63% desile um so this is why we have such an emphasis on uh finding discret individual companies that are trading at very reasonable valuations just starting their turn rounds got through the dstock cycle now in the restock cycle which China&#39;s you know still in the middle of the dstock cycle probably six months off from the restock cycle and you want to be in ahead of those inflection points because when they go it&#39;s just straight up um forward P obviously a lot lower on the S&amp;P 600 than the regular indices that&#39;s where you find your opportunity in the US uh profit margins at record levels we covered uh containers coming through La alltime near all-time high PE ratios and you can see by sector small caps down here at 16 midcaps large caps at 21 uh midcaps also down here around 16 so that&#39;s prices is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to find the Big Value midcaps like VF Corp like gener uh like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker like a lot of the names that we&#39;ve covered small caps Cooper standard Comstock resources Etc uh see these estimates turning back up for next year earnings uh estimates record inflow to large cap Equity Funds so everyone was buying mag S at the exact wrong time last week and and there we go weekly bankruptcy filings saying they&#39;re ticking up they couldn&#39;t be lower yeah they&#39;re ticking off off off like a dead dead level um tiny tiny nothing to even look at here same thing you saw in 2011 little Spike UPS after the collapse they&#39;ve absolutely rolled over um here&#39;s Morgan Stanley this is also a little worrisome because Michael Wilson who was the biggest bearish guy in the whole in October 2022 remember the trip Triple B break putt for those of you guys were with me now he&#39;s raising his price Target at 6,500 and that&#39;s predicated on the mag 7 which is the exact wrong way to think about things is being index bound versus stock bound where the opportunities are going to be but at least we finally got a little religion and it&#39;ll probably be a little bit right for the next 12 months Uh Russian leader Putin signs a new doctrine that lowers the threshold for using nuclear weapons that was you know not ideal but uh Trump will step in on that front and hopefully come to some positive resolution ution in a reasonable amount of time once he takes office on January 20th us home builder sentiment reaches 7-month high after election um here&#39;s the Tariff scenario this is a stair step over time this is Bloomberg&#39;s estimates for China and the rest of the world so they&#39;re not anticipating any rise in tariffs uh through the end of next summer and it will be a small stair step from 12% to 20% and then another year year and a half half and then it goes up to 25 my guess is it it it will probably be one set they&#39;ll meet us in the middle and it&#39;ll be elevated from where it is now but not uh anywhere near the headlines are advertising European stocks have underperformed us in eight of the last 10 years I would be looking for discrete opportunities there uh sets next year&#39;s S&amp;P 500 Target to 6,700 14% gain from here uh BuyBacks by corporate clients have accelerated in 2024 like you&#39;ve never seen before uh that is pretty significant US dollar total percent returns December is the worst month of the year for the US dollar so keep an eye on that that should be interesting to watch data centers could ignite a surge in power demand that&#39;s why gener gener has been doing so well um Equity indices trailing 12 well that&#39;s part of the reason uh 12mth earnings the other is hurricanes 12mth earnings per share hyperscaler this is an interesting chart hyperscaler capex growth is expected to decelerate when they move from training the large language models to inference the demand for chips is going to go down exponentially and you can see that um capex is going to start to to move down according to that Goldman Sachs uh article we forecast a 25% increase in completed us m&amp;a and the other thing to keep in mind is uh there will be new entrance and the dependency on tsmc for NVIDIA is only as good as tsmc until Intel comes online with their foundaries which the government will make sure happens and then Intel will be minting money like it&#39;s going out of style we forecast a 25% increase in completed m&amp;a trans transactions in 2025 that&#39;s going to help Regional Banks it&#39;s also going to Regional Banks because there&#39;s going to be a lot of consolidation in that group which is going to help small caps uh it&#39;s also going to help the people facilitating the deals um which should be the big Banks and the question is how much of that&#39;s priced uh probably not all of it but enough of it at this point where I&#39;d want to be a buyer at much lower levels gap between magnificent 7 and 493 earnings growth is expected to narrow by the way I think last week I said we were hopeful to do a 30 minute call this week uh good luck with that uh we&#39;ve got too much to cover ladies and gentlemen too much stuff exciting stuff is happening uh so here&#39;s what you see mag s unmagnify by 2025 uh the game changes and you start to see them both in double digits and by 2026 they basically converge small business optimism turning up covered Goldman out with uh the art of the deal note bullish the other thing to keep in mind here is the seasonality of Nvidia while it&#39;s the weakest month of the year for the US dollar it&#39;s also the weakest month of the year for Nvidia stock so keep that on your radar merging stocks struggle versus the US you have not had an opportunity like this to buy emerging market stocks like since 20 2001 and you know what happened next we&#39;ve covered it many times but just a a reminder um most people are very excited to buy things up here and up here uh and you know it&#39;s not just Emerging Markets it&#39;s some of the other things that we just talked about a second ago uh and this is what they wind up with and no one wants to buy them down here and this is what they wind up with but the reason no one wants to buy it down here is because they can&#39;t can&#39;t live with or down here it&#39;s because they can&#39;t live with this for a couple years in order to get their in this case was a five bagger they can&#39;t live with the three years of uncertainty and up and down you know someone put on Twitter about Baba this is brutal what&#39;s brutal I mean like seriously the stock is $85 or $87 like I mean if if you&#39;ve been listening for a while pretty much everyone that that is on this call probably has a basis in the low 80s to mid 80s and some of you even in the 70s 60s you were buying in the hole like crazy when it got down to $58 uh who cares if it spiked up we knew it at they were going to rip out the idiots who bought at 117 take them down below 100 it took them well well down below 100 and now we get rid of those idiots and then we&#39;ll finally have our final move up and we&#39;ll talk about that later this is from Ryan Dietrich here&#39;s that seasonality in November you know we got that rally off the election then grinding and then we got some weakness everyone got scared out with the Russian thing and blah blah blah uh and now we&#39;re probably in that trough period here about before Thanksgiving and uh going to re accelerate into year end uh this is from VF Corp thanks to my buddy over there at steel basically they put a Buy Signal with a $27 Target and they&#39;re looking at $2 a share with no growth they say what if you do get growth it&#39;s going to be a lot more so their initial upside Target is $27 this is so exciting I remember being on TV I think it was with blizz claim in the stock was $15 and um you know it&#39;s very tough for people to believe when a stock is down that much that it could ever do anything good but you got a bet on the jockey um Brack and Daryl same thing he came into Logitech when the stock was down 82% uh within eight years he had a 26 bagger so that means if you put a million dollars in Logitech when he when he took over the Reigns uh 8 years later you had 26 million bucks so I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s going to be the same case but you&#39;re betting on a winner and he&#39;s got great Brands there you got um Timberland and Northface which are going to be through the roof went as China recovers you got Vans which he&#39;s stabilized now the new schoolers are selling out he&#39;s got great stuff coming out uh you got um Dickies which is a quality work brand uh that uh that will that will recover and you can still sell the the PX business to generate some more cash to pay down debt their interest expenses come down with the sale of supreme he&#39;s doing everything he said he was going to do just just like Shane o Kelly with Advanced Auto Parts just like uh the guy we just heard from from uh um Stanley Black and Decker I love these type of businesses this is like for me I sleep at night because once I get solvency risk off the table then it&#39;s just a matter of time for the recovery I mean you know in the case of um VF Corp been around since 1890 they&#39;ve been doing this stuff buying and selling brands forever um God what was the other one that we&#39;re that uh I think Stanley&#39;s been around uh almost 100 years as well there was another one that blew my mind that was over a 100 years old um okay consumer composite indexes again turning up us homes under construction so this is dropped off this we need to start to see and we&#39;re going to see I know there&#39;s going to be a solution in the Trump administration building permits will go back up uh and um and bring the cost of housing down um yes I probably we bought the top in Orange County but you know that that had nothing to do with an economic decision that had to do with a uh family decision but uh I did get it I still got a good deal and the reason I got a good deal is because and I gotta have good deals it&#39;s just in my DNA um so the seller uh had these these tenants in that their least because it&#39;s a huge anyway they had he had a bunch of people living in there and um but their lease didn&#39;t end till May so he couldn&#39;t list the house because no one wanted to buy it with tenants and so I offered him 75x uh he took it and then I just get and then I met the tenants I said uh how much do you get out by next week gave them 100 Grand and they were gone so there you go um it worked out and it&#39;s walking distance to the beach so that&#39;s that&#39;s not a bad thing either um so that&#39;s that firsttime buyers share of US housing prices US housing purchases um so again we got to bring that affordability down that happens in rates that happens in Supply and uh and there will be positive develops I think the biggest thing that&#39;s going to happen is somehow the Trump Administration will force or or incentivize local municipalities to open up zoning dramatically and if they can do that and they can create land Supply and they can bring rates down and affordability down even if they&#39;re building you know 1500 foot houses instead of 4500 foot houses I think that&#39;s going to get the thing absolutely cranking so uh that&#39;s that and then buy side positioning in small cap starting to turn up which is good slow rate cut cycle is actually a blessing in disguise so everyone&#39;s like oh I hope they go in December no you kind of hope they don&#39;t because in the in the instances where the The Cutting cycle goes more slowly the stock market tends to do much better uh here&#39;s sler from RBC let&#39;s get down to that um so we got a look here SNP moving up moving up drop back here now it&#39;s starting to work back higher again that&#39;s good news uh equal weight same story NASDAQ stack kind of stalling out here deciding if it&#39;s going to break to new highs or not I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it does certainly after the inauguration uh but maybe led by a different composite of companies uh for the most part and then uh midcaps moving back up here which is good to see small caps just breaking out guys this is the name of the game measured move on this would take you up to 2,000 so we&#39;re not even started on small caps which is exciting because we&#39;ve been table Pounders for a long time it&#39;s nice to see that playing out um more seasonality oh let&#39;s see what the AI sentiment was by the way before we do that let&#39;s see AA sentiment results by the way I&#39;m going to be on CNA Asia tonight at 6:15 p.m. if anyone wants to tune in you can get it on their website that is like the BBC of Singapore goes throughout Asia tons and tons of viewers um okay so the bullishness came down a little bit this week bearishness went up a hair so that&#39;s good uh Emerging Markets again moved up pulled back to this uh support line we&#39;ll work back higher certainly after the inauguration same thing with the hangsang which is basically China Tech we had that huge shoot up in September October which was unbelievable and now we pull back down to this this is where everyone&#39;s getting ansy which is great get all the weak sisters out before we make our next move higher very similar to the 2016 to 2017 election to inauguration period Tokyo can&#39;t get out of its own way a 10-year yield bumping up against this downtrend line this is going to roll back over same thing with the is there US dollar it&#39;s in this sideways Trend up against upper support this will roll back those are the big two surprises of next year Canadian dollar you all are nervous oh he said it was going to go up when&#39;s it gonna go it&#39;s going to go up I&#39;d beong the Canadian dollar here for sure uh oil no view but it looks like it&#39;s uh your risk reward is to the upside um gold rolled over remember here I was like nope everyone would say buy more anyway uh copper this is going to turn up with China&#39;s recovery next year so that would be another thing I&#39;d be buying probably a good pair of trade is short gold long copper but I I wouldn&#39;t short gold um all right Nvidia is kind of just hanging out here I think it&#39;s negative today what else Google got hit today pretty hard down 5% PayPal rocking and rolling we don&#39;t even talk about up 30% in the last few weeks um actually no it&#39;s up a lot more than 30% uh 30% is because that&#39;s when I talked about it on um vanney in late August and I was telling it&#39;s up 30% since then but uh before then and I remember these podcasts in the 50s no one you literally could not give PayPal away and um it&#39;s funny I&#39;m going to speak at the money show in Sarasota on January 7th and then I fly out to Orange County um and that was one of my three ideas last year and it did nothing and now it&#39;s just going all at once and uh it&#39;s just the first stop among many Alex Chris is doing such an incredible job on that uh any other stocks we need to talk about here so yeah the utilities are rolling over they&#39;re not cheap enough for me yet to get back involved but some of these are getting very very interesting CCI is great new money that came in we put to work in CCI uh existing money you ow own it lower and this is going to work dramatically higher next year as rates compress uh some of the Staples are starting to look interesting but not cheap enough for me the uh drug the weight loss drug stocks are getting hit because of RFK that&#39;ll probably be temporary but uh they&#39;re too expensive for me based on the valuations I think in what was it on uh I think it was in August we were on Yahoo and they made me do that segment on like one to buy one to not buy or whatever and I said and Lily is too high and they&#39;re like no but they&#39;re just getting started with the weight loss just like you hear in the Nvidia story and sure enough here we are from August to now it&#39;s from 972 down to 718 it&#39;s a pretty big drop ladies and gentlemen um suncore some of these energy stocks are kind of interesting but we&#39;ve got enough with uh com stock all right so that&#39;s sler let&#39;s go through some of the news real quick then the article of the week is pretty exciting I&#39;m I&#39;m even more excited to talk about Advanced Auto parts that I am Alibaba because Alibaba is just a waiting game that&#39;s that&#39;s a foregone conclusion Advance was looking a little sketchy there it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going to be a great great story and by the way the reason I brought up the guy in um New York uh so I asked him because he uh do you do any business with Advanced Auto Parts and he says 88% of our business and I was like why do you do 88% of your business with Advance because I just saw on the same road you got autos you have Napa you have all these guys he&#39;s like number one the people that they have at their desk actually understand cars uh they didn&#39;t come from working at Walmart uh number two they&#39;re fair prices and they get me the products quickly so that was really comforting to see because this guy like I saw five people walk in that say like I need new tires I need this and he&#39;s like okay I can schedule you four weeks out I mean this guy is so busy you couldn&#39;t believe it and the fact that with that mindset that he&#39;s trusting all of his business with Advanced Auto Parts was very comforting it&#39;s an anecdote but it&#39;s better than him saying no we haven&#39;t used them in two years they&#39;re terrible scumbags you know I mean he would have told me that too if that was the case and it clearly wasn&#39;t uh we&#39;ll cover Alibaba later I mean expanding user base accelerated Cloud growth we know that Chinese stocks rebound on guidelines to boost shareholder value more more stimulus that no one cares about until they do after the inauguration Chinese Banks surge as csrc guideline urging more shareholder returns lifts confidence uh City moves their uh Target price or price Target uh 12mth price Target on Alibaba to $132 okay here is the Kelly Blue book report which we covered actually incentives going up this is the name of the game for volumes this is the number one leading indicator to volumes is incentives the higher incentives go the more volumes you see autocredit availability increases across the board in October Disney gives investors years to cheer about we agree again no one wanted it in the 80s everyone now wants it well no still people don&#39;t want it which is exciting ant groups quarterly profit nearly triples okay we own a third of this company through our holding in Alibaba you have zero credit implied in the stock this will probably IPO in 2025 and we&#39;re going to get a huge windfall from that as Alibaba shareholders but no one&#39;s talking about it alibaba&#39;s quarterly profit surges 58% on strong Cloud offshore e-commerce growth they also had some benefit of Mark to Market on some of the Investments uh if you remember last year they had a mark to Market mark down alibaba&#39;s sluggish growth in China Commerce drags Down results so here&#39;s the negativity even though they grew so we&#39;ll actually get to the facts um yeah it&#39;s mindboggling how that one author at uh Barons which she seems to have gone on a long extended vacation because the new riter is much better uh on China and then um then Bloomberg just consistently negative it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing I wonder how euphoric they will be when Baba&#39;s over $200 and all the China stocks are humming uh they&#39;ll probably be the biggest cheer leaders at that point but we&#39;ll time will tell uh Baba buys back 414 million ordinary shares $4.1 billion dollar of Buybacks in the quarter record uh Disney&#39;s turning record Parks profits even though even before the expansions uh us retail sales increase on Autos Alibaba okay that that&#39;s the same negative article from CH from uh Bloomberg Disney paints Rosie piic for coming years building products distributor qxo makes bid for Beacon Roofing so um this was exciting to see we&#39;ve covered qxo several times on this we own it at $12 looks like $12.70 um we made an exception for buying a spack above cash value because of Brad Jacobs so we&#39;re up on that one uh look I think they&#39;re paying up for Beacon rofin but he needs a platform and if they get it done he needs a platform and once he gets one I think there&#39;s going to be an enormous amounts of opportunities and synergies and the technology that he applies to make it more efficient and he&#39;ll work his United Rentals Playbook his qxo Playbook his waist connections Playbook one more time and that&#39;ll be a Monster Run for the next seven to eight years uh Walmart&#39;s earnings holiday shopping is off to a strong start which is great Boe to lay off 2200 workers the headline used to be before Christmas look they did it to themselves I mean at the end of the day um uh bad time to go on stroke on strike when you&#39;re uh company so they&#39;ll probably lay off another five or 7,000 and half of those will be people who were on the strike uh asking for more money so some got more money some got uh so so some got a 30 or 40% raise some got a 100% cut and that didn&#39;t have to happen but um you know self-inflicted wound Joseph Sai Global Supply Chain becomes okay we got that Jose Sai PDD drops so they they got hit hard this morning they&#39;re down 10% today why because their numbers were unsustainable Baba&#39;s numbers still went up so they fended off the threat from these guys uh this is a garbage business in my opinion and uh there there you go Alibaba issues uh I think they did five billion in bonds to to fund more BuyBacks uh which is exciting to see Nvidia oh what was the thing here the guidance seems to show lower growth but this may be Nvidia being conservative shortterm blah blah blah launch of Blackwell uh one Supply constraints on Wednesday critical questions about black Wells production ramp and consumer concentration little room for execution missteps blah blah blah the big thing here is that they are there was a time when you could buy Nvidia and the higher the stock price went the lower the multiple went because their margins were expanding and their revenues were expanding and everything was well now their revenue growth is capped at 4 billion a quarter which is still amazing but their margins have stopped going up which means they&#39;re probably on their way to start going down uh so growth is slowing profitability is slowing and they price as if it&#39;s never going to slow price for Perfection and um so uh so not for us and um could it push higher for a couple of quarters yeah but the law of large numbers is going to kick in and competition is coming faster than they think article of the week it&#39;s all about confidence stock market in centim results so this is the most important chart you need to pay attention to and we&#39;ve covered it several times before but you can see here in 2016 that going into the election the month before and the month of October and November after a rally off the ripy face off rally off the bottom lows where the stock went from you know the 60s to $17 just like we just went from 66 to $117 um you had three consecutive months lower month before Trump got elected month after Trump got elected month Trump got elected and month after October November December negative negative negative so we&#39;ve just had October negative November negative and uh I look history does not repeat it Rhymes so would it be shocking if we started to turn up in December no would it be surprising if we went a little lower before we rip higher and have the parabolic move after after the inauguration also know so the you know some people said oh could it be different and maybe we&#39;ll start rallying in December my answer is who cares I mean literally what is the difference if this type of move starts in one week or one month or four months at the end of the day as long as this happens the irrs on The Leverage and the options and the underlying stock will be so amazing and catch up for all the lost time that uh of this taking longer than expected to play out that it it absolutely doesn&#39;t matter all this did and we got to send the Christmas card to G is give us more opportunity to reload our options that we we were blessed with Mana from heaven in in uh in um September late September and early October it was unbelievable uh and now we have more than we had before that okay so we have reloaded and then some and we&#39;ll probably reload more in December if history holds and we get one more month of weakness before January takes off so um so that&#39;s the story there covered the two things during uh okay this week the two earnings results we&#39;re going to cover our Advan Auto Parts in Alibaba the common theme with these two are that their respective consumers are at or near the troughs in consumer sentiment consumer confidence and at Major inflection points for example if you believe the US consumer is going to stay at these levels of depression permanently you should sell your Advanced Auto Part stock okay so this is exactly how they looked in all the previous coming out of recessions and and again we&#39;ve been in a manufacturing depression not recession depression for two years and that&#39;s starting to turn the corner um and similarly if you believe that the Chinese consumer will remain depressed and never recover you should sell your Alibaba stock what that would also tell me is that you don&#39;t look at data you don&#39;t look at the housing prices starting to recover you don&#39;t look at the retail sales you don&#39;t look at the pmis you don&#39;t look at the exports you just look at the Bloomberg headlines and the former Baron headlines when they had that one person who wrote literally 135 consecutively negative headlines um when she was writing about it so I&#39;ve made my career in in the mean reversion game and it has served me extremely well over the years one of my edges is recognizing extremes and betting on recoveries whether companies sectors and countries we are expressly in the time Arbitrage business and attract Partners investors who can weather short-term noise in exchange for long-term bounties we live to tell the story because we employ little to no leverage we run a concentrated High conviction portfolio in which some thesis play out much faster than we anticipated and some take longer but on balance we aim to realize fully valued exits within 36 months coming off despondent overshot low prices Advanced Auto Parts reported earnings last week the headlines were quote Advanced Auto Parts shutters 700 stores to shore up Finance what it should have read is quote New Management with proven track record of success fixes years of Bad Decisions by previous Management in a shrink to grow strategy while maintaining healthy balance sheet through sale of non-core assets what is fascinating to me is that despite the negative headlines even the cell side who usually run for the hills from turnarounds were constructive with their outlooks Morgan Stanley had a base case of $50 price Target H with an $85 bull Case Bank of America was was more pessimistic well below the 2026 consensus EPS estimates of 313 per share and Ms estimates of 312 per share so what I always tell you guys and girls is the most important thing with turnaround situation is taking solvency risk off the table that&#39;s why the refinancing uh of Cooper standard was the critical Catalyst that&#39;s why the sale of Supreme for VF Corp was the critical Catalyst and with Advanced Auto Parts the sale of westpack was critical so all of them have basically taken solvency risk off the table now it&#39;s just a timing game for them to turn things around and get doubles and triples across the board and More in some cases um so what they&#39;re saying here is there&#39;s an opportunity to fill a massive productivity Gap you know operating margins they&#39;re targeting 7% versus the peers at 16% so even though they&#39;re only targeting 7% when I show you what that means in terms of operating income it&#39;s going to blow your mind and what the stock trades at when it hits levels of operating income of th of those levels um now Clos your storage resulting in $2 of eps at the midpoint looking out to 2027 7% operating margin is being targeted by extracting up to 500 basis points in merchandise efficiencies and sgna productivity which would result in $7 in earnings per share in our estimates okay they are not pricing this Morgan Stanley is not pricing this for $7 of estimates they are pricing this for $3 of estimates at $7 this thing could be $140 stock um it&#39;s now trading at $37 okay um Chang undertaken okay so that&#39;s the story there Bank of America a little more pessimistic but they still come out to $3 by 2026 um so if solvy risk is off the table and you can buy it at these levels and revenues are static let&#39;s assume no growth um here we go f okay risk to the upside faster than anticipated comp and earnings recovery from restructuring initiatives significant improvements in Supply Chain management closing the gap between a Advanced Auto Parts and strongest peers and a strategic combination one with one of the larger peers they could get bought out that would be the worst case scenario for us because then we&#39;re going to get taken out at $60 or $70 when this thing could be a $100 plus if we just waited another year or two after that um and material C cash generation from planned asset sales enabling share repurchases and debt Payback payback above our our um forecast management was more sanguin than the sells side analyst and laid out a clear path to recovery over the next two years uh so they&#39;re reducing 500 storage which is 10% they&#39;ve got about 5,000 and then 200 of the independently owned franchises which don&#39;t make much of a difference uh 7% in operating margin by 2027 2.5 times debt to leverage ratio and over five 00 basis points in operating margin expansion uh through uh what we covered so the most important thing here because you can read most of this on your own and I circled all the important points is this looking out to 2027 with all the stores closed and by the way the one thing that wasn&#39;t covered is closing unprofitable spread out stores in the West Coast where they have no synergies and actually funding they&#39;re going to open I think 50 30 new stores this year in areas where they have concentration and 50 next year uh by 2027 50 to 70 new new stores on 9 billion of revenues which basically assumes steady state no growth which they&#39;re going to have growth but no growth uh 7% operating margin okay yields 600 30 million of operating income ladies and gentlemen um the last four times that they had operating income in the 600 Millions were 2018 where they had $600 million of operating income 2019 where they had $679 million of operating income and 2022 where they had 670 million of operating income in those respective years when the share count was much higher 10% 10.5% higher than today the business earned $5.75 $687 $7.70 per share in EPS the stock reached highs of $186 $182 and $244 in each of those years when they had an operating income of 600 million and I believe management is being conservative because they&#39;re assuming no growth just taking 500 basis points of margin because they know longer have you know three stores within a thousand miles of each other and then they got to pay for a distribution center that they don&#39;t need just put them into the areas that they control on the east coast and put more stores there with less distribution centers you&#39;re going to get more than 500 basis points but let&#39;s just assume that they only meet their their conservative levels uh and earn seven bucks a share I mean we&#39;ve got a triple on our hands is really what it comes down to we entered this position with the expectation of a double over three years as we&#39;re now seeing Shane see CEO Shane o Kelly execute on the plan he laid out in Inception deleverage the balance sheet with the $ 1.5 billion sale of world pack close on unprofitable storage 10% consolidate supply chain our expectations have moved up while the sell side analysts have moved down it will not be an easy or short path but with solvency risk off the table following the sale of roal pack and a sensible shrink too strategy coupled with demand Tailwinds this could be another major turnaround Tom special in coming years let me re repeat that this could be another major turnaround Tom special in coming years not some easy double like vernado in six months or whatever I&#39;m talking about major and I looked at one of the analysts who wrote a very pessimistic report after earnings not he&#39;s not listed above he graduated undergrad in 2022 and it&#39;s LinkedIn picture looks like a high school yearbook photo a 23-year-old kid is trying to tell us what proven shano Kelly who ran a$7 billion HD Supply for Home Depot is doing wrong look I&#39;ll bet on Shane every single day of the week just look at his background okay at HD Supply before that CEO of Interline Brands which was subsquently rebranded as Home Depot Pro before that CEO of Petro Choice largest distributor of lubricants and lubrication Solutions uh biggest client P Diddy just kidding uh he was also CEO of a Harris a specialty construction supply distributor and uh 7 years as an infantry officer in the US Army graduated from both airborne and Ranger schools and served as a rifle platoon leader and Company Commander he Comm completed numerous deployments with the first Cavalry Division and 325th Airborne oh and by the way he&#39;s got his MBA from Harvard Business School and a bachelor&#39;s degree from West Point so I&#39;ll take that over the 23-year-old kid who just wrote his first analyst report bashing the hell out of the stock any day of the week this is the natural sentiment of sell-side analyst when you are closer to lows the same Uber pessimists become the final upgraders at the next top several years out when their despondency turns to Euphoria if they still have a job at the exact wrong time so here&#39;s the drivers of the pl turn around number one uh strong demand drivers there&#39;s no question 13-year-old average car on the road they&#39;re breaking down they got to fix the parts their big strengths are batteries which you can&#39;t ship through the mail Amazon filters and engine management it&#39;s just non-economics to ship it through the mail two we are getting back to fundamentals of selling Auto Parts which focus on a blended box three our execution is supported by experienced leadership and improved liquidity four operational productivity review identified opportunities to improve profitability and five tarting to achieve 7% adjusted operating income margin by fiscal year 2027 so they&#39;ll have n billion of net sales with low singled digigit comp sales growth I think it&#39;s going to be more than low single digit when they&#39;re running it right 7% adjusted operating income margin and two and a half times leverage ratio so you can see here the number of light duty vehicles in operation so these are the macro stories bigger Market than ever before average light Vehicles average age of the light duty Vehicles is 13 years um and so on so what actions have they already taken they sold whac they retained the Canada business they invested in the Frontline meaning people that don&#39;t come from Walmart people that actually come from the auto business that can talk to the pros like a pro and understand what they&#39;re asking for uh initiated the supply chain consolidation to build out a hub of Market Hub stores uh Market Hub of stores invested in price to improve Market competitiveness and establish talented talented leadership so it&#39;s DIY and its Pro um current a Advanced Auto Parts cash position of $2 billion includes RAC sale proceeds so $2 billion on the cash balance sheet they are not going anywhere solvency risk off the table uh here&#39;s the details about store operations merchandising excellent supply chain uh okay so they covered that all right operational impact greater than 75% of revised store footprint located in markets with number one and number two share so approximately 60 to 80 million in operating income savings so um so they&#39;re going to be they&#39;re they&#39;re basically going to invest in those areas where they have concentration and they are already number one and number two share which is huge versus all this stuff out here where they had a handful of stores and were wasting their time sending trucks thousands of miles to um to work if you look at the Northeast and down the East Coast they own this area and that&#39;s where all the money is and all the opportunity is so it&#39;s going to be a big deal and a big change and a very very smart exciting move um all right so it&#39;s funny when I&#39;m writing these things it takes hours and hours and it probably takes it to relay so you got to read that if you&#39;re going to be serious about it if you&#39;re not going to be serious about it then you just listen to what I say and you do what you do but um okay let&#39;s go into Alibaba we covered these charts this is what it looks like after the election goes down for two months into January and then it starts rallying into the inauguration and Beyond 20 150% rally and then straight away from the lows in December to the highs when Trump got out 228 Baba went from 85 at the inauguration to over 300 by the time he left office um look that&#39;s not the only Factor I&#39;m not saying that has to happen history does not repeat but there is a tendency to rhyme when different conditions are in place particularly as it relates to emerging markets in China and you can see that going back to 2001 okay so the key things here uh just to summarize is earnings were fine tound t-all grew low single digits the AI um growth in our Cloud business accelerated from PRI prior quarters with revenues from public Cloud products growing in double digits and AI related product Revenue delivering triple digit growth by the way the AI product Revenue triple digit growth um not only did that this quarter has done that for the last five quarters okay and people are questioning uh whether they&#39;re going to it&#39;s going to be the greatest business that&#39;s why we mostly got involved but the actions they&#39;re taking on the retail business will actually have that to re accelerate as well uh purchased 4.1 billion reduced the share count by 2.1% Revenue was up 5% year-over year they DEC decreased non-cash share based compens compensation which was our big pet peeve they finally took action on that used to be all the shares they were buying were going back to to management which was a train wreck um Ned income was up 63% some of that was investment gains um cash flow was down because they&#39;re making investments in the cloud infrastructure and T so basically what they said is we&#39;re not going to just sit back number one we&#39;re going to get more and more Sharon Cloud no one&#39;s going to be able to catch us no one has been able to catch us but more than that we are going to stop timu and PDD dead in their tracks we are going to crush these little batches who have come up from out of nowhere and that&#39;s exactly what they did and that&#39;s exactly what you saw today which is you know um which is why pindu Duo got shellacked Baba said no Moss we got $880 billion on our balance sheet we&#39;re going to bury you and you&#39;re starting to see that um gross merchandise volume was double digit growth year-over-year big purchase frequency big user growth the rich customers the 88 VIP members they they&#39;re buying the luxury that&#39;s going to be the whole story as the economy recovers um increased by 46 million people during the quarter during the quarter 46 more million rich people join their platform that buy you know luxury type stuff um Cloud intelligence their uh revenues were up 7% the um Ai and Cloud related was up triple digits for the fifth consecutive quarter and you can read about that it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable they do absolutely dominate Ai and the other thing that they have like uh ant Financial which is not getting any credit is they have pieces in every single AI startup in China they just say okay we&#39;ll give you some free cloud and AI in in exchange for Equity you don&#39;t have to give us cash so you know some of these companies are going to be thousand Baggers and we&#39;re going to own a piece of them because of Alibaba Cloud but again no credit for it yet um the international Commerce continues to grow 30% 29% that&#39;s a big deal that&#39;s going to continue to grow the other small businesses are doing better getting closer to profitability in some cases profitability but if you look down here talau and t-all uh China Commerce Wholesale was up big they they&#39;ve proactively wound down their direct sales which has hurt them um their tound t- M minus the direct sales was up 2% uh aidc and by the way they said um 1111 is singles day absolutely did great so that&#39;ll show up in this quarter uh International 35% sale 9% aidc 29% the logistics business 8% local Services 14% the movie business which is Tiny was down 1% uh and all others what 9% for total growth of revenues 5% that&#39;s a big deal uh so that&#39;s that and the big thing with the cloud is not just that their revenues were up 7% but that their eida was up 89% for 3 months and up 115% for the 6 months year to dat so these are the big things uh we&#39;re optimistic about the government&#39;s macro stimulus policies and are confident in their long-term positive economic impact drive sustainable growth uh so look it&#39;s all there confidence in the future how they&#39;re taking actions and um oh and everyone worrying about the video all these people from 10 cent thinking oh we have video and all that stuff well um actually the video selling has gone down if you look at industry numbers and it goes plays Wells to our our advantage at T Bal and t-all because the brands need to be looking at which platform can truly bring them more sales rather than just simply displaying their products he&#39;s taking a a backhanded slap at all these video sellers that think they&#39;re doing well and the data for the industry for the video sellers who think they&#39;re going to take share from Baba are going down not up so while they&#39;re all going down Baba is holding steady because they&#39;ve made some Investments their cloud is going up their International is going up uh they still got $80 billion of gross cash on their balance sheet they&#39;re buying back stock like it&#39;s going out of style another 22 billion on the authorization they&#39;re proactively making Investments I mean what&#39;s better gaining share through making Investments or just having another1 billion of cash sit on the balance sheet I think at this stage right now the so far ahead in cloud and AI take some of that free cash flow make the Investments and just absolutely bury and leave all the competition in the dumpster and that&#39;s exactly what they&#39;re doing and that&#39;s why I&#39;m comfortable with the cash flow going down for these Investments making up because I&#39;m seeing the return on investments and that&#39;s what we need to see and Jeff agrees they took their price Target up to 42% which implies about a 60% upside uh sentiment here is kind of neutral and uh Insider buying in Advanced Auto Parts looks like Thomas seabolt uh a director bought $100,000 a stock directly wrote the check himself Dow earnings top 30 weights was revised down by 1.4% in the last 60 days NASDAQ was revised up by 1.6% for 2025 overall earnings starting to be revised up economic data uh jobless claims today came in lower than expected so that&#39;s a good sign and nothing really huge on the economic data front and now we are going to do um the ask me anything questions so for everyone who loves the ask me anything questions uh stick around for those of you who just like the podcast part thank you for tuning in we&#39;ll be back next week and uh make it a great one so here we go on the ask me anything questions first one comes from Lan Neo hey Tom more of a philosophical question how did you gain confidence to purchase Cooper standard in 2022 after it dropped 98% from its all-time highs did you know they were able to refinance and was that a catalyst for the stock thanks I&#39;d love to know your thought process behind enduring downturns especially since you&#39;re a fund manager um yeah I did know I didn&#39;t know that they would be able to do it but I knew it would be able to get done I mean I have a lot of friends in the private credit business so my general view was they&#39;ll get it done on their own and if they don&#39;t I&#39;ll make introductions for them and they&#39;ll eventually get it done and they did get it done Goldman uh completely raped them but uh got it done and uh took the solvency risk off the table and that and that was a key catalyst so I love that moving on Richard Lou like your Etsy idea but the confusing part for me is their share compensation a lot of their free cash flows do the employee share No that&#39;s not true let let me let me walk you through it really simple so he loves Etsy he&#39;s worried that he&#39;s they&#39;re giving the employees shares they they all do the same thing and they you know the CEO hires some outside the board hires some outside Consulting agent to pay them to say that it&#39;s okay to give our employees all this stock and uh and that&#39;s what happens and it&#39;s just the way it works but if you look at the numbers it&#39;s not egregious so they&#39;re they&#39;ve got 214 million in stock compensation but they repurchased $464 million of stock stock so they&#39;re giving away far less than they&#39;re buying in and they&#39;re still generating cash they&#39;re operating income was 437 Million last quarter so um that&#39;s not a reason to like or not like it that&#39;s just the way it is and not egregious by normal standards Joseph Baxter can you take a look at fizer uh I think it&#39;s okay I I I we haven&#39;t made it a position we covered uh many times in the last few weeks uh Martin Yang how do you feel about Canada Goose we own it we&#39;re fine with it we haven&#39;t added to it but I think we&#39;ll do some work on it this week and maybe add a lot more at these levels um but we haven&#39;t made that determination yet this is just the reason we haven&#39;t added a lot is because a lot of it&#39;s going to be the Emerging Markets recovery they&#39;re huge in China and in Asia so as that recovers next year they&#39;ll recover but we already have so much exposure through Baba it&#39;s like making two big positions makes no sense so I think we&#39;re comfortable with our positioning in but we have nibbled down at these levels as new money came in but uh uh maybe we&#39;ll do a little more but we don&#39;t want to get too Overexposed because we got super amounts of great exposure with uh BBA and they&#39;re going to trade similarly so uh leave it at that Dennis Davis lung thanks for providing great content as usual you&#39;re welcome I shared your insights with my connections but they all seem too focused on hype stocks uh know you were starting to look at solar stocks from your past couple podcasts what&#39;s your opinion on N phase I covered n phase uh still not interested in doing anything I think they&#39;ll work as trades I don&#39;t want to own them as businesses um but yeah I me pH I keep looking at them and most of them keep losing money but I know they&#39;re going to work as Trad so I keep looking at them and um I&#39;m just going to do anything with them yet so I&#39;ll leave it at that I&#39;m I&#39;m I am more than comfortable with an error Ono omission of omission on solar stocks they are crappy businesses they&#39;re super cyclical and um dependent on so many things outside of their control so if you want to gamble on a trade you&#39;re probably going to win okay so all these are going to go up and I&#39;m going to get the the podcast questions next year like oh remember when I asked you about end phase in November well now that it&#39;s up 75% do you think I should keep holding it even though you didn&#39;t want me to buy it um these are this is the type of nonsense I have to deal with but uh the answer is congratulations on getting lucky and get out while you can that&#39;s that&#39;s really the theme with when uh solar stocks go up so I&#39;m just not there yet I think I think there will be some like I I would feel comfortable buying First Solar But First Solar is not really a bargain so all the other are low quality garbage um that are going to work great as trades and we&#39;re probably not going to be involved because that&#39;s not what we do um speaking of which Alex Chris sent me an email all because we have a merchant with account with him uh early results from latest PayPal experience show an incremental 3.7 3 to 7% lift fast lane by PayPal our accelerated guest checkout uh drives an average 67% conversion for Shoppers with fast lane profiles PayPal pay later increases aov by up to 55% giving Shoppers flexibility to pay over time and pay with venmo lets 92 million active consumers who love venmo pay with their balance so uh just more excitement from the inside track but it&#39;s public information because he sent it out to millions of vendors so uh there you go how much value would you place on Insider buys as a signal uh I see a lot of advance Auto Parts directors have been buying stock um is it mostly noise or insightful uh not much weight I I pay attention to buys are way more useful than sells people sell for a million reasons they buy for only one and that is they think the Stock&#39;s going to go up uh as far as Cooper standard I&#39;ve talked to management about buying stock the problem is is they bought a ton in the 30s I believe and got smoked so when it was down from 146 to 33 they thought everything was going to be great except for the fact Co came so they all they&#39;re all upside down millions of dollars but they got tons of stock so they&#39;re partners because uh they bought tons of stock even though they bought it at much higher prices than we did so they&#39;ve got incentive to get it back up uh into the 30s and well beyond and and I know they will so umh yeah it&#39;s helpful but it&#39;s not critical Landon you know and the smaller the company gets the Dumber a lot of the managers are so and I&#39;m not not referring at all to Cooper standard I don&#39;t think they could execute any better than they have in the current conditions but I&#39;m talking about generally you see a lot of crappy stocks with insiders buying stock and there&#39;s no reason for them to buy because they&#39;re absolute dog garbage stocks uh and they&#39;re wrong they just buy their own hype so um short answer is Insider buys matter they&#39;re a low weight in our analysis but Insider sells don&#39;t matter that much at all Insider Buy are helpful to pay attention to because they got to hold the stock for at least six months I&#39;ve been looking at Nestle have you done any work on the stock or have have you uh I think we looked at this a few weeks ago and said not yet I&#39;d probably be more interested in Hershey but Hershey&#39;s not at a level I think Nestle is a not yet see if it comes down a lot more yeah cash flows re accelerating uh revenues going down margins have really compressed yeah I just want to see a little continuation of uh little recovery in revenues it&#39;s probably okay but you know if I [Music] say if I say looks great and it drops to 70 before it goes to 150 and then you got to say what&#39;s the highest and best use I mean it&#39;s not really going to be a triple or double so what do they have a big dividend is that what you&#39;re after let&#39;s take a look actually it should say here 3.92% I think you&#39;re close I think I&#39;d want to see like low 80s to mid 70s before I got more interested to do work so it&#39;s not yet but it&#39;s close good eye Greg alamari wanted to know your thoughts on oxy um no everyone keeps asking me we keep covering it every week it&#39;s fine but Buffett got a much better deal the reason he bought stock is because he had all these warrants he did a deal where he lent the money right before covid in 2009 he got a ton of warrants in the 50s so everyone&#39;s like he&#39;s buying all the stock up here in the 50s it&#39;s it look it&#39;s probably going to bounce up to 7580 over the next six months it&#39;s not a good risk reward trade so pass um Tom Hawkins hings this one came through for Le SCH technology another dog Solar stock negative free cash flow oh okay never mind I take that back uh Tom uh schs shls maybe this is the solar play that we&#39;ll look at yeah it&#39;s just they haven&#39;t been around long enough for me to be interested um yeah this one would be one I&#39;d put in my speculative bucket but I don&#39;t really have a speculative bucket because uh rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two is don&#39;t forget rule number one let&#39;s see battery energy EV [Music] charging man I don&#39;t know I I just want to avoid this I have no Edge on it I think it&#39;s going to work as a great trade and I want nothing to do with it we&#39;ll leave it at that Philipe Andrew pinkos thank you very much you mentioned Estee louer look I don&#39;t know how to run a make a business so I don&#39;t know what they should do but I&#39;m I I know the turnaround Playbook is cut a lot of fat sell off non-core assets delever the balance sheet and find a way to grow and uh and then in in their case all they all they really need is a Tailwind in China uh the reason it&#39;s not a huge position but it is a position is because it um it&#39;s the same trade as as Baba basically as the Chinese consumer comes back this is going to be a double or triple and it&#39;s a high quality business and yes there&#39;s competition yes I know about elf and I know about Sephora and I know about all this nonsense but this thing&#39;s been around I think since the 1800s uh and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll figure it out so uh to answer your question there&#39;s nothing I would tell management about what they should do that a normal turnaround Playbook doesn&#39;t do and anyone of a quality uh management experience knows how to do so they&#39;ll do it or or they&#39;ll replace is this the eo2 but at some point the business gets so cheap that um that it gets fixed and there&#39;s enough here to fix it essay louder is not going anywhere and uh and it&#39;s a good quality compounder over time what do you think of genmab gmab [Music] margins have collapsed no what the hell oh no they haven&#39;t all right what does this do develops antibiotic Therapeutics for cancer so they cure cancer I have no idea if they cure cancer and I have no Edge as to whether they cure cancer or not so if you&#39;re a doctor maybe you have something to say about it but for me we own a basket of Biotech xbi those are going to do great in 2025 um and uh we don&#39;t pick individual biotech or drug stocks we we people who get it right are often you know flipping a coin and then they get it right they think they&#39;re smart and the ones who don&#39;t get it right go out of business and you never hear from them Cava um I like Cava I actually eat Cava when I&#39;m in the city and um some people have been asking can it be the next Chipotle blah blah blah I don&#39;t know I mean I think it could but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s as universal of a taste as the only reason I got interested is because they put steak on it now you know before they had it was like vegetarian nonsense and I could have zero interest in in that so the question here is what are we paying for it um I think the discretionary is going to come back next year like all the restaurants that are in the toilet I know we&#39;ve talked about Portillos my daughter Mimi loves the Portillos hot dogs and someone asked about that that probably already started to go Portillo PT no I got I got to take a look at Portillos and I got to take a look at Cava my guess is Cava is dramatically overpriced but let me just check on that before I make any draw any conclusions 14 times current sales nine times next yeah I just I just don&#39;t pay up for stuff and it&#39;s just not in my DNA so um about to Deb wow this is small business Cava too I mean it&#39;s packed where where I go on uh I&#39;m on 40th and they&#39;ve got one on 40th in Madison I&#39;m like 40th and 5ifth between fifth and sixth um all right so here&#39;s the issue I have with something like that you&#39;ve got an Enterprise value of 16.5 billion on $900 million sales and $100 million of eida so I&#39;m paying and $53 million of net income so 20 time 16 300 something times earnings I mean it&#39;s crazy town so let them get smashed more and then I&#39;ll take another look at it I mean I get it but yeah if so what&#39;s Chipotle worth CMG I don&#39;t think they&#39;re not going to become the next Chipotle it&#39;s too nichy I mean people Chipotle has burritos and steak and meat and all this stuff this is a salad game and there have been tons of salad businesses that gone out of business chopped went out of business it&#39;s not enough so and people like Greek food but like once in a while like Chipotle you can eat every day this stuff it&#39;s like oh I want to be healthy I&#39;ll eat this salad stuff and because they put steak on it I&#39;ll actually go if they were going to put that Falafel crap not interested so Chipotle on the other hand um so Chipotle is an80 billion business with10 billion of sales earning a billion dollars so they&#39;re 81 times net income they&#39;re actually doing it it&#39;s again I look it it&#39;s not my wheelhouse I I think Cava is going to be a good business question is price is what you pay value is what you going to get and I&#39;m not willing to pay that much for that earnings power I can pay a lot less and get guaranteed earnings power that I don&#39;t have to speculate on whether it&#39;s going to be a good salid business or a bad solid business I know that cars break and people replace them that&#39;s why I like those businesses so um I like the idea I just don&#39;t like the price even though it&#39;ll probably work as a trade star surgical from Paul Falcone this one&#39;s probably going to be a good one he usually sends in good stuff sta all right so it was $163 stock it&#39;s now a $30 stock why is that implantable lenses for eye lenses to the eye treat visual disorders all right so it&#39;s like medical devices healthc care supplies which we have with Baxter and we&#39;re perfectly happy with but um let&#39;s see sta all right so they went negative cash flow negative and now they&#39;re recovering margins are up yeah so Paul&#39;s a guy who&#39;s been with me on this podcast for like four or five years and now he gets it I mean he picks good businesses at reasonable prices uh for the most part and um and this one&#39;s probably another one but again you have to do a ton of work from here just to just to look at the numbers and say uh this looks worth pursuing is one thing doing the work is hours and hours I mean just writing up the article about Baba and Advanced Auto Parts is 10 hours and that&#39;s probably 5% of the work you need to do to commit Capital if you&#39;re doing a good job how&#39;s the balance sheet here wow this is small business so 1.1 billion is this trading at 30 times evida yeah 40 times earnings yeah I I would have to get comfort in the products and in the growth trajectory to be willing to pay up that multiple but on balance it looks interesting that&#39;s all I can say about that um it&#39;s a very high multiple for what it&#39;s producing right now but there there must be a story that this growth is going to extrapolate forward so that&#39;s what you really have to understand is the defensible moat and the growth ratio and if you can get Comfort around those two things it&#39;s probably a decent time to start a position but again a lot more work to do on that one um nice work moving along Drew Robinson uranium no no no no no nuclear is going to happen I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t play just the Commodities it&#39;ll probably work as a trade you want to find some businesses that are going to benefit and it&#39;s too early uh one of the ones that we had a multibagger on was Rolls-Royce on engine servicing but they have the small nuclear SMR the small nuclear reactors but they&#39;re not going to convert until 2030 plus so it&#39;s it&#39;s early let let there be a Mania rally on that stuff when it crashes in two years that&#39;s when we&#39;ll buy stuff for the Final Phase uh for now it&#39;s not the time Jacob yeah still like comto Jacob Bob Johnson Ora mining we don&#39;t do miners I&#39;ll take a quick look but the answer is going to be no I I I have no I mean they just have an uncanny way of losing money regardless of the underlying commodity price yeah I mean it&#39;s cheap for now um but that can change in five it can change in one quarter I mean everyone was super excited about Cliff&#39;s natural resources and it&#39;s just been a you know uh not for me I think your financial analysis is correct Bob I just don&#39;t want to be in that business Max more mRNA uh no interest in that um I know it&#39;s cheap I know it&#39;ll probably work I have no Edge uh and I&#39;ve covered that a gazillion times uh how do you exit a position once it reaches your intrinsic value do you sell 20 30% it depends uh I usually don&#39;t put it all on at once and I usually don&#39;t take it all off at once some I&#39;ll take off a bit before intrinsic value you know maybe if something&#39;s up 45x I&#39;ll take off 20 25% even if I think it&#39;s going to go to 10x um and then you know I&#39;ll probably take off 50% when it hits my Target and then I usually keep 10 to 20% of a flyer on because just as things overshoot on the downside they have a tendency to overshoot on the upside but it varies uh by things and sometimes you know you&#39;ll have those parabolic moves where you just have to take it all off at once and uh and benefit from that way so no that&#39;s just experience you got to learn it by doing it um qua common think solar stocks are interesting what do you think of end phase I already answered that and that&#39;s it we&#39;re done we&#39;ll see you next week same time same place if I don&#39;t talk to you before Thanksgiving I will but whether you&#39;re here or not Happy Thanksgiving to you and your family and um in the mean time make it a great one bye for now [Music] oh [Music] [Music] he [Music] [Music]
