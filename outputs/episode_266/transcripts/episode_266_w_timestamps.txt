[137.28s] linked uh and into stocks linked to the
[140.56s] broader economy so tomorrow&#39;s newspaper
[143.319s] today is what hedge fund tips with Tom
[145.56s] Hayes is all about as you can see Google
[148.2s] down Amazon down Nvidia down today
[151.2s] everything else green which is moving
[154.12s] the right direction we&#39;ll talk about
[155.28s] some of the seasonality around these
[157.0s] things uh and and how we&#39;re thinking
[159.56s] about it first uh want to thank
[161.84s] Christian dagger and the great Stu
[163.72s] vanney for having me on Fox Business
[165.48s] yesterday to talk about Nvidia before
[167.239s] earnings and small caps so we&#39;re going
[168.959s] to listen in here all in the green
[171.44s] Thomas Hayes joins us again this morning
[173.48s] uh he&#39;s covering the market for us today
[175.44s] let&#39;s start with Nvidia their report
[177.159s] after the belt what are you expecting
[179.0s] well Nvidia is priced for Perfection at
[181.319s] around 40 times earnings and around 40
[183.44s] times sales so let&#39;s hope that their
[185.799s] earnings come in as hot as their
[187.68s] Blackwell chips which are melting the
[189.36s] data centers oh that&#39;s that that has
[191.879s] that been refuted uh well the
[194.04s] information had data they the company is
[196.56s] telling them to realign the chips in the
[198.319s] data center so they don&#39;t create so much
[200.0s] heat uh you know while it is priced for
[202.68s] Perfection there&#39;s a good chance that
[204.319s] they pull it off this quarter the key is
[206.64s] going to be the guidance moving forward
[208.92s] but implied volatility is 8.5% what mean
[212.56s] what&#39;s implied volatility it means the
[214.56s] amount that the stock is expected to
[216.4s] move on earnings so that&#39;s going to be a
[218.12s] $300 billion swing either up or down on
[221.4s] a $3.6 trillion stock what do you think
[223.76s] is going to happen I you going opinion
[225.68s] on this uh look we don&#39;t own the stock I
[228.0s] think it&#39;s priced for Perfection you
[229.2s] know there was a time when you owned
[230.879s] Nvidia and uh the multiple went down as
[233.959s] the stock price went up because the
[235.36s] profit margins kept going up the profit
[237.2s] margins are no longer going up so maybe
[239.2s] they eek out a couple more quarters of
[241.599s] of stock growth but I think at the end
[243.48s] of the day as the multiple continues to
[245.319s] expand and the profit margins stay where
[246.959s] they are and and year on year on the
[249.48s] quarterly revenu is only growing 4 4
[251.599s] billion which is amazing but 40 times
[254.519s] sales it&#39;s it&#39;s not in our uh it&#39;s not
[256.759s] in our wheelhouse so buying today would
[258.359s] be a risk indeed okay don&#39;t answer the
[260.72s] question okay uh we&#39;ve always you&#39;ve
[262.84s] been hot on small caps that&#39;s right I
[265.44s] want you to tell me what is the best
[267.44s] small cap ETF for our viewers out there
[270.639s] many of whom are interested in this
[271.96s] sector of the market yeah I think the
[273.24s] easiest way to play small caps as a
[275.0s] basket which worked very well in Trump
[277.32s] 1.0 after the election and into 2017 is
[281.4s] iwm that&#39;s the Russell 2000 ETF easy to
[284.759s] get broad broad-based exposure uh we
[287.28s] like to own some individual companies
[288.96s] but I think that&#39;s an easy way easy
[290.479s] basket for people to get involved got it
[292.24s] then that&#39;s the ey shares Russell 2000
[294.44s] Index uh iwm okay Tom thanks for being
[298.44s] with us this morning we appreciate it
[299.759s] thank you very
[301.039s] much and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I
[305.44s] had the pleasure to join David Lynn on
[307.759s] the David Lynn report and this is these
[310.52s] are just phenomenal interviews he&#39;s got
[313.199s] such a large engaged audience I
[315.6s] invariably get two or two to four phone
[317.68s] calls every time I do his podcast and um
[322.68s] uh we really go into detail the the
[325.52s] perceptions of the Trump Administration
[327.639s] versus the reality of the Trump
[330.68s] Administration and uh and where to look
[333.479s] in the pockets of opportunity moving
[335.0s] forward this is a great one we&#39;re going
[336.84s] to listen in now we are going to see
[339.56s] nominal GDP run at levels that we have
[341.84s] not seen in decades I think as you look
[343.919s] two years out I could see I could see
[346.8s] four five six handles like we haven&#39;t
[348.919s] seen in ages do not be surprised after
[351.56s] this initial short-term weakness or
[353.759s] spike in yields that we get a bid in
[357.0s] treasuries following the inauguration in
[359.36s] that last last for some time so these
[360.8s] are some things that people are not
[362.919s] expecting and like we say in the
[364.759s] business the first move is often the
[366.88s] wrong move Thomas Hayes managing member
[369.08s] of great Hill Capital returns to the
[370.44s] show we&#39;ll be breaking down his analysis
[372.08s] of the economy the markets and what&#39;s
[373.56s] happening with the markets into the new
[375.72s] year welcome back to the show Thomas
[377.24s] congratulations on getting another good
[378.56s] call you&#39;ve been right on the rally and
[380.319s] it looks like the rally is sustained up
[382.12s] until now a bit of a pullback today on
[384.24s] Friday 1.9 1.29% drop on the S&amp;P 500 is
[388.12s] of noon eastern time the NASDAQ down 2%
[390.72s] so this week&#39;s looking like a losing
[392.199s] week Thomas uh we&#39;ll talk about that
[393.8s] welcome back thank you thanks for having
[395.319s] me David great to be here so losing week
[397.599s] um it feels like of course we&#39;re you
[399.68s] know short-term Focus this is this has
[401.52s] only been a couple days since Trump won
[403.52s] but it looks like the Trump Foria has
[405.639s] been fading this week uh was there just
[407.919s] a short-term fade short-term trade what
[410.84s] happened here yeah I think the initial
[412.759s] reaction was a lot of people were
[415.24s] offsides into the election and had to
[417.479s] chase up and then this is a consolid
[419.759s] ation of the games that we saw if you
[422.0s] look at seasonality since 1932 if you
[426.12s] look at the road map uh this is pretty
[428.56s] normal into about the third week after
[431.639s] that initial pop off the election that
[434.08s] relief rally that kind of certainty the
[436.96s] uncertainty clearing uh type of rally
[439.68s] you do get some weakness into late
[441.68s] October around the third third and a
[443.4s] half week and then you tend to persist
[446.4s] with strength year end rally into the
[449.52s] inauguration now uh we got something for
[452.16s] everyone here for for those people who
[454.599s] uh who don&#39;t love Trump well the first
[457.599s] six months after the inauguration in
[460.28s] after an election it tends to be
[462.36s] sideways to a grind down for those who
[464.639s] love Trump uh you get that rally into
[467.599s] the inauguration six months a sideways
[470.44s] and then the second half of the Year
[472.479s] tends to be a very strong rally in that
[475.199s] first year of a presidential cycle but
[477.599s] the the good news or bad news depending
[479.639s] you look at it is that&#39;s the average
[481.52s] since 1932 whether you have a democrat
[483.599s] or a republican in power so I think
[486.479s] what&#39;s going to be new here David is
[489.599s] what is perceived to work under the new
[492.52s] Trump Administration and what has
[495.56s] actually worked under the previous Trump
[498.0s] Administration if you want to go into
[499.52s] some of that well is there anything he&#39;s
[501.479s] proposing that&#39;s dramatically new um in
[505.4s] its respect to how it may impact the
[508.159s] markets uh well people think the 60%
[511.84s] tariffs with China is new uh this is
[514.76s] what he ran on in
[517.08s] 2016 and interestingly enough the minute
[520.64s] after he was elected in
[523.36s] 2016 what you saw um there was some
[526.68s] weakness of emerging markets and Chinese
[529.12s] stocks into the election I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
[531.64s] know that that was predicting a trump
[533.32s] win in 2016 very few people were uh but
[537.08s] that weakness persisted into the
[540.279s] inauguration so the months of November
[542.92s] and the months of December in 2016
[546.04s] emerging markets were weak China was
[548.079s] weak China Tech was weak and then
[550.68s] following the inauguration we had one of
[553.88s] the biggest rallies in the shortest
[556.2s] amount of time in history in emerging
[558.44s] markets in China Tech in Chinese
[560.76s] equities despite him running on
[563.16s] protectionist tariffs and being the
[565.519s] Tariff King so I think the surprise for
[568.68s] 20 25 will be that these stocks start to
[572.72s] do exceptionally well after the election
[575.64s] despite the consensus that they will
[578.399s] remain weak and they&#39;re they&#39;re weak
[579.88s] into the inauguration on the basis that
[582.12s] that tariffs are coming the other thing
[584.48s] that&#39;s happening David that we&#39;re seeing
[586.36s] right now that we saw in 2016 as well is
[590.36s] the US dollar rallied like crazy on the
[594.399s] election into the inauguration and then
[598.56s] completely rolled over the following six
[601.36s] months you had a weakening like you
[603.2s] hadn&#39;t seen in a long time from January
[606.36s] 2017 through the summer of 2017 and then
[609.6s] the final one that&#39;s going to be the
[610.8s] Shocker is everyone thinks yields are
[613.079s] going to blow out because Trump is going
[615.399s] to deficit spend and he&#39;s going to lower
[617.399s] taxes and the exact same thing happened
[620.0s] in
[621.24s] 2016 he was elected in November yields
[624.48s] blew out until the inauguration and then
[627.56s] you saw a big reversal bonds started to
[630.44s] get bid yields compressed the entire
[633.12s] first year of the presidency and uh
[636.639s] basically the 10-year yield during that
[638.279s] time this this set of circumstances will
[640.48s] be slightly different was between 1.29
[642.959s] and 3.2 if you could imagine during his
[645.279s] presidency but uh certainly this time
[647.88s] that the range will be higher but do not
[650.519s] be surprised after this initial
[652.04s] short-term weakness or spike in yields
[655.12s] that we get a bid in treasuries
[658.0s] following the inauguration and that
[659.6s] lasts for some time so these are some
[661.24s] things that people are not expecting and
[664.079s] like we say in the business the first
[665.92s] move is often the wrong move before we
[668.48s] continue with the video let me tell you
[670.6s] about a growing threat and risk to your
[673.16s] personal safety that you should be aware
[674.959s] of over the last decade politically

[683.6s] with the conclusion of the 2024
[685.399s] presidential election concerns around
[687.399s] personal information exposure remain
[689.8s] critical today three and four voters
[692.56s] fear political violence fueled by how

[749.399s] first move is often the raw move uh well
[752.24s] let&#39;s break down uh these asset classes
[754.16s] that we&#39;ve talked about so starting with
[755.36s] the um the the last one yields so you&#39;re
[758.12s] right uh let me just pull up my screen
[759.959s] here and we can take a look at exactly
[761.36s] what happened in 2017 this is the chart
[764.32s] of the US ten year yield uh Trump&#39;s last
[766.92s] inauguration January 2017 was here uh
[771.12s] yields had a blowout like you said uh
[773.24s] went down um and then went back up now I
[776.199s] wonder how much of this decline from 18
[779.56s] to 19 uh 20 basically 2018 to 20 was a
[783.279s] result of the tariffs people just
[785.8s] offloading um on US dollar and and
[789.44s] offloading on uh treasury assets here we
[792.92s] go 20182 this is the US dollar here so
[796.519s] similar decline they followed each other
[798.72s] US dollar the 10year yield uh was this a
[801.6s] result of an escalation of tariffs with
[804.68s] China or was this a result of just uh
[807.48s] the bond market uh reacting to other
[809.72s] forces here yeah I mean it look it can
[811.959s] always be a combination but but the key
[814.72s] thing is he ran there there was not a
[818.04s] surprise here in that he ran on tariffs
[821.839s] and the market was expecting tariffs so
[823.56s] the market is a discounting me mechanism
[825.639s] and tends to act much before it actually
[828.72s] happen so he had been talking about it
[830.24s] since 2016 and I think you got me
[832.68s] looking at uh here January 2017 and this
[836.92s] is March 18th yeah so that&#39;s that&#39;s
[840.16s] exactly what we&#39;re talking about here
[841.68s] you you saw a uh spike in the dollar and
[845.199s] then weakness in the dollar following
[846.639s] the inauguration and I think if you look
[848.68s] at commercial positioning right now
[851.12s] David I I think I was on your show in
[855.279s] October of
[857.32s] 2023 when everyone was selling Bonds in
[860.839s] the ho yields were out and I was saying
[863.12s] buy bonds buy by bonds by buy bonds and
[866.24s] we had a ripy face off rally that lasted
[868.56s] for over year okay so given your outlook
[870.839s] on the FED funds rate what&#39;s your
[872.079s] outlook for uh the shortterm and
[874.399s] long-term of the yield curve well I
[876.48s] think the biggest surprise for the
[878.36s] second half of this year and where all
[880.839s] of my focus is on is that there is going
[883.519s] to be an unexpected rally in the 10year
[887.72s] bond uh if you look at the commitments
[890.199s] of Traders which is an important measure
[892.56s] that we look at very carefully it works
[894.399s] differently for different instruments
[895.839s] but when it comes to 10-year bonds you
[897.88s] can look and and see that the
[899.48s] commercials have been aggressively
[901.399s] getting long for the last couple of
[903.32s] months they always are early and they
[905.68s] always are right I think in the back
[907.92s] half of the year what no one&#39;s expecting
[909.519s] is that the 10-year is going to get bid
[912.48s] and that&#39;s going to have a huge impact
[914.6s] on this rotation moving forward the two
[917.68s] key themes for the second half of this
[919.68s] year in our view are US dollar continues
[923.12s] to be soft and weaken and number two is
[926.48s] the 10-year bond gets bid which
[929.16s] compresses yields uh which has a
[932.0s] positive impact in terms of mortgages in
[934.519s] terms of banks in terms of RS uh and in
[938.16s] terms of the uh rotation into small caps
[940.8s] which the largest sector of course 21%
[943.72s] is financials and small Banks right now
[946.88s] commercial positioning is at an even
[949.199s] more extreme uh uh level than that I.E
[953.68s] uh large Traders and hedge funds are the
[955.36s] most short that they&#39;ve been since uh 20
[959.639s] 18 I think it was before we had a rally
[963.92s] uh the last time the last time that you
[967.44s] had hedge funds and large Traders this
[970.24s] short let me know when you pull up
[972.839s] bonds you got the dollar dollar so
[975.36s] you&#39;re looking at 2018 yeah
[978.079s] that&#39;s started falling in October 2018
[981.12s] yeah yeah so so you have an exact same
[984.16s] situation right now commercials are
[986.279s] aggressively long treasuries meaning
[988.199s] they expect yield to come in hedge funds
[991.16s] and large Traders are shorting in the
[992.72s] hole so so this is consistent with what
[995.36s] we saw in
[997.24s] 2016 after the election and before the
[999.639s] inauguration yields blew out and then
[1001.959s] they came back in same thing same thing
[1004.199s] dollar uh straight up and then weakened
[1006.68s] after the inauguration so I think the
[1008.759s] theme is uh regardless of the noise in
[1011.36s] the short term uh bonds will get bid in
[1015.04s] 2025 dollar will weaken again resume its
[1017.8s] weakening Trend again in uh
[1020.04s] 2025 and that&#39;s going to be helpful for
[1023.199s] uh emerging markets in xus despite the
[1026.28s] current sentiment which is US
[1029.199s] exceptionalism everything in the US uh
[1031.88s] with the Trump trade it just simply
[1033.679s] didn&#39;t bear out that way yeah from 2017
[1037.0s] through 2020 albeit uh the economy did
[1040.959s] exceptionally well in the US but not at
[1043.319s] the expense it wasn&#39;t an either or it
[1045.439s] was a both
[1046.88s] and so this is a massive move back in
[1049.679s] the last Trump presidency from November
[1051.88s] 2018 the Tang year went from 3.26 all
[1055.12s] the way down to uh about 0.5 yeah about
[1060.16s] about like a almost a almost a 300 pacis
[1063.84s] Point drop over the course of two years
[1067.84s] yeah and no and no one would have
[1069.4s] predicted that whatsoever uh and and
[1071.96s] that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking about I&#39;ll
[1073.08s] tell you another shock uh if you can
[1076.159s] pull up xes with which is oil
[1080.28s] servicers okay so everyone thinks drill
[1082.72s] baby drill uh these are going to be the
[1085.4s] greatest trade of all time and uh so you
[1089.52s] had that huge Spike into the
[1091.08s] inauguration after the election and then
[1092.72s] it was the greatest short of all time if
[1094.64s] you had shorted energy oil and gas
[1097.679s] servicers uh from the inauguration over
[1100.0s] the next two years you made a fortune
[1102.0s] under the Trump 90% yeah so even if you
[1106.08s] pull what was the WTI doing during the
[1108.559s] same period I&#39;m curious okay so this uh
[1111.72s] oil didn&#39;t natur underperform to the
[1114.0s] same extent except that big you know the
[1117.08s] co was a oneoff right there away from
[1118.72s] like basically whatever it was to zero
[1121.08s] but okay um yeah even pull up XLE pull
[1123.919s] up the integrated you would think that
[1125.64s] they would be less hurt not not after
[1128.159s] the inauguration what happened to the uh
[1130.52s] miners or the the yeah the uh the the
[1133.84s] oil
[1134.88s] companies yeah basically you had more
[1137.84s] Supply you had more subdued prices than
[1140.28s] you had historically had which hurt
[1142.12s] margins uh which helped the country
[1144.2s] which helped inflation come uh be lower
[1147.28s] uh helped business helped real incomes
[1149.36s] but didn&#39;t help the energy companies
[1150.88s] because they work on margin uh and uh
[1153.559s] and their cost of production was higher
[1156.32s] than it is today and the price of oil
[1158.36s] was also a lot lower so that&#39;s not a
[1160.52s] formula to generate a lot of cash uh the
[1163.36s] other one that was a big shock uh is
[1166.0s] look at xrt retail also spiked on the
[1170.559s] expectation of a strong consumer after
[1172.44s] the election and then as you got to the
[1174.96s] inauguration uh right there in January
[1178.24s] 2017 uh you had weakness for the next
[1181.559s] year yeah that&#39;s what happened so 2016
[1185.88s] 2017 uh inauguration was yeah January
[1189.08s] 2017 and then it basically went down 12%
[1193.4s] into into the um into the trough well
[1197.36s] okay so a couple of things may be
[1199.24s] different this time so we&#39;re in a rate
[1201.36s] cutting cycle
[1203.96s] uh during the first couple of months of
[1207.0s] Trump&#39;s presidency that did not happen
[1209.159s] the Fed was not cutting rates in early
[1211.44s] 2017 I believe well let&#39;s just double
[1213.64s] check that so here&#39;s the effective uh
[1215.159s] fif fund rade 20 uh 2018 yeah actually
[1218.44s] they were in a tightening cycle the
[1220.28s] other way around um so that&#39;s one major
[1223.799s] difference the other major difference is
[1225.76s] I&#39;ll let you evaluate this but people
[1227.36s] have been calling for a recession it may
[1229.2s] just be a mood point maybe it never
[1230.72s] happens we&#39;ll see I&#39;ll let you respond
[1232.2s] to that and then the third thing is
[1233.96s] taxes it&#39;s been speculated he might be
[1236.039s] even more aggressive with tax cuts this
[1239.559s] time around so three things monetary
[1241.52s] policy uh the second thing is whether or
[1243.679s] not we&#39;re getting a recession there was
[1245.039s] no recession in 2017 2018 and then
[1247.799s] number three um taxes how do these
[1250.919s] forces impact the general
[1253.039s] markets okay so monetary policy pull up
[1257.559s] xlu
[1259.36s] and XLV xlu first which is interest rate
[1263.039s] sensitive it&#39;s utilities yeah everyone
[1265.12s] would think this would be a train wreck
[1266.679s] under Trump and what what did you see
[1269.6s] you saw weakness after the election and
[1271.72s] then after the
[1273.039s] inauguration uh complete rally for the
[1275.32s] next year yeah okay so uh this is
[1278.96s] consistent with bonds getting bid dollar
[1282.08s] weakening all that stuff after the
[1284.48s] inauguration so as as it relates to
[1286.679s] monetary policy that will be supportive
[1288.679s] yields lower uh it will be supportive
[1291.24s] for dollar weaker however I do think the
[1293.799s] terminal rate and we&#39;ve said this a bit
[1295.76s] on your show we believe this was a
[1297.6s] midcycle adjustment we think there&#39;s
[1299.52s] many more years in this bull market and
[1303.2s] um therefore the the terminal rate is
[1306.84s] probably going to be a lot higher than
[1309.36s] most people had anticipated most people
[1310.84s] were looking for 3% we&#39;ve been kind of
[1312.76s] the loan voice saying it&#39;s probably
[1315.32s] going to be more like 4% because if you
[1317.0s] look back to 95 which which was a
[1318.799s] midcycle correction and some other
[1320.72s] midcycle Corrections in the late 60s uh
[1323.799s] they didn&#39;t have to go more than about
[1325.4s] 150 basis points to get to uh an
[1328.679s] acceptable nonrestrictive stance uh and
[1332.48s] I think that&#39;s going to be the case this
[1334.12s] time as well uh XLV is Health Care same
[1338.919s] thing everyone&#39;s selling it off today on
[1341.0s] the basis of RFK Junior taking over and
[1344.559s] uh you know some expectation that no
[1346.32s] one&#39;s ever going to take medicine or
[1348.08s] vaccine again yeah I didn&#39;t see that
[1349.96s] that was a a 10% drop in the last two
[1352.76s] days yeah so if you go back to 2016
[1356.159s] you&#39;ll see it did the same thing after
[1358.0s] the election and before the inauguration
[1360.679s] weakness and then uh strength for the
[1362.88s] next year uh you got to go further up uh
[1365.96s] there you go yeah November yeah November
[1368.64s] straight down into the inauguration of
[1370.24s] January
[1371.6s] 2017 no yeah now you&#39;re there okay yeah
[1375.279s] now to January 2017 and then after the
[1377.84s] inauguration straight up right so again
[1380.799s] all of these things you know what else
[1382.48s] did the same thing Believe It or Not Arc
[1385.64s] arkk the thing that is absolutely blown
[1388.12s] up she could have she could Rise Like a
[1390.039s] Phoenix From the Ashes here in this
[1391.799s] environment as rate as bonds get bid
[1394.799s] yields go down so she had weakness after
[1396.919s] the election and then straight up for
[1398.48s] the next year uh plus so um so you said
[1402.96s] monetary policy you said uh uh cutting
[1406.279s] the taxes this is an enormous deal this
[1409.6s] is the white swan that people aren&#39;t
[1411.559s] putting enough emphasis on with the
[1413.799s] sweep which was only confirmed basically
[1415.88s] 2448 hours ago even though it was
[1418.32s] pointing in the direction uh if you take
[1420.559s] the tax rate from 21% down to 15% your
[1424.24s] tax expense uh is reduced by about
[1427.88s] 29% which would imply in the short term
[1431.4s] earnings estimates are too low at 275
[1434.48s] and they should be
[1435.919s] reated over $300 per share on the basis
[1439.72s] of just that tax benefit then if you
[1442.4s] apply the multiplier effect of the
[1444.559s] reinvested capital over the next couple
[1447.279s] of years you start to look towards 325
[1450.72s] 350 and no one has that in their numbers
[1453.48s] right now so I think that uh people are
[1456.919s] underestimating earnings power earnings
[1459.159s] growth earnings broadening under the
[1461.039s] Trump Administration and that uh now
[1463.76s] that you have a sweep the 15% corporate
[1467.6s] tax rate is almost a foregone conclusion
[1470.84s] and that&#39;s going to have a material
[1472.64s] impact that would never in a million
[1473.96s] years pass if the Democrats held on to
[1477.039s] the house so uh that is an
[1481.12s] underrated White Swan event as it
[1483.84s] relates to earnings and makes the market
[1485.799s] which seems like it&#39;s pricey right now
[1487.76s] start to look a lot more reasonable if
[1489.48s] you add back uh the reating of earnings
[1492.24s] okay so the last couple of jobs reports
[1494.12s] were pretty positive um we&#39;re working
[1496.799s] with the assumption that uh this data is
[1499.48s] pointing towards a soft Landing uh I
[1501.72s] think a lot of people even on my show
[1503.24s] have kind of given up the recession
[1504.52s] narrative where do you stand that&#39;s
[1505.96s] that&#39;s I I bring that up because as I
[1508.399s] said earlier in 2017 Trump wasn&#39;t facing
[1511.559s] a recession Prospect yeah so I I think
[1514.919s] we&#39;ve covered this on your show in
[1520.679s] 20203 and basically everyone was waiting
[1523.559s] for the recession and I got on your show
[1525.44s] and I said no this October 2023 this
[1528.32s] this is a buy opportunity because the
[1531.24s] recession that everyone&#39;s waiting for
[1532.919s] already happened and if you look back to
[1535.919s] q1 and Q2
[1537.76s] 2023 you had two quarters of negative
[1541.36s] GDP growth that is a technical recession
[1544.399s] the government never acknowledged that
[1546.24s] it was a recession but that is the
[1548.08s] definition of a technical recession so
[1550.84s] the recession that everyone&#39;s waiting
[1552.36s] for has already happened and usually you
[1554.919s] get a recession once every four and a
[1556.72s] half years the problem is we had one in
[1559.48s] 2020 and then we had a second one in
[1564.039s] 2022 uh first two quarters of 2022
[1567.12s] excuse me uh first two quarters of
[1569.44s] negative GDP growth and so you basically
[1572.96s] had 8.2 years of recessions in two-year
[1576.88s] period which is why you could go a
[1579.159s] handful of years without another
[1580.96s] recession uh it was just pulled forward
[1583.84s] and I think that&#39;s what people are
[1584.76s] missing now so soft Landing no uh hard
[1587.0s] Landing how about no land ing uh how
[1589.64s] about we just hit an earnings trough in
[1592.96s] Q3 of 2024 and we&#39;re going to start
[1596.84s] reaccelerating earnings growth uh led by
[1600.0s] the
[1601.399s] unmagnify over the Magnificent 7
[1604.279s] magnificent 7even earnings growth has
[1606.2s] decelerated from the first quarter of
[1608.44s] 2024 at 50% earnings growth to now in
[1611.84s] the mid teens earnings growth that&#39;s
[1613.76s] going to continue to stay in the mid to
[1615.2s] low teens uh
[1618.24s] 93 has had negative earnings growth in
[1620.919s] q1 and Q2 just inflected positive and
[1624.36s] will start to re accelerate into the low
[1626.679s] teens earnings growth in 2025 so that
[1629.559s] broadening is going to be a general
[1632.0s] sense of well-being growth and
[1634.2s] excitement in the economy not just a
[1636.0s] handful of companies driving the bus
[1637.919s] okay uh you brought up Arc so let me
[1640.399s] just bring up uh tech stocks since uh
[1643.279s] Arc is kind of tech heavy uh still so
[1645.799s] the uh this is the NASDAQ Composite
[1647.72s] January 2017 to its peak um in October
[1651.64s] 18 up
[1653.44s] 48% um I just I&#39;m curious what the
[1655.799s] Russell did during that same time period
[1658.32s] here uh 2017 January uh all the way up
[1661.72s] to the peak 25% the Russell actually
[1664.039s] underperform the NASDAQ during the same
[1665.36s] period okay um your view on tech stocks
[1668.159s] overall I know you brought up Arc um
[1671.0s] Tesla shot up to the Moon uh in recent
[1674.159s] weeks um you know mainly because of Elon
[1677.6s] Musk with the administration now uh but
[1680.679s] this is what happened with Tesla it went
[1682.64s] up about 40% in the matter of a week um
[1686.76s] so I don&#39;t know if that has to do with
[1688.399s] the fundamentals of tech stocks or more
[1690.24s] to do with politics but I&#39;ll let you
[1691.64s] address this yeah I think this is going
[1693.72s] to be a surprise for a lot of people
[1695.559s] whether you look at ARK or ffty which is
[1698.6s] the IBD 50 momo stocks um during that
[1703.0s] period or xlk or even SMH for
[1707.24s] semiconductors all did exceptionally
[1709.44s] well under Trump so uh small caps did
[1713.6s] also did well but they pulled forward a
[1715.36s] lot of the games in those two months
[1717.0s] right after the election if you look at
[1718.519s] it it was that huge rally off the
[1721.399s] November lows and then it Consolidated
[1723.32s] for that six months before uh resuming
[1725.6s] higher so I think that&#39;s the surprise
[1728.12s] and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to emphasize
[1730.0s] people think oh it&#39;s only an energy and
[1732.159s] Industrials game and Banks game but
[1735.159s] actually energy was a short of a
[1736.76s] lifetime in the Trump administ ation
[1738.44s] after the inauguration and Tech did well
[1741.24s] Arc did well semis did well equal
[1743.76s] weighted small caps did well China you
[1745.96s] know what else did much better under
[1747.679s] Trump than under Biden pull up T solar
[1750.919s] stocks okay this is not my neck of the
[1753.48s] woods but you know if we&#39;re just being
[1755.44s] objective uh take a look at what
[1757.399s] happened from 2017 to 2020 wow uh and
[1762.88s] 90% yeah yeah and then if you look at
[1766.08s] the Biden Administration from 20 21
[1768.76s] through
[1770.399s] 2024 uh you know not not no
[1774.44s] bueno and this is another misconception
[1777.6s] people will have going into the Trump
[1779.08s] Administration thinking they know it&#39;s
[1780.519s] going to work under Trump and it&#39;s for
[1782.72s] the most part the exact opposite of what
[1784.64s] they&#39;re expecting now Industrials did
[1786.76s] well Staples did well discretionary did
[1789.44s] well financials did well most things did
[1791.399s] well the one thing the two things that
[1793.32s] stand out uh that didn&#39;t do well which
[1796.6s] is surprising is is energy and Retail
[1800.559s] stocks xrt you can pull that up um and
[1804.519s] biotech did well by the way biotech did
[1806.64s] well so uh health I was gonna say it
[1809.2s] looked like a lot of defensive sectors
[1811.32s] did well but it wasn&#39;t just defensive I
[1812.799s] mean some of these things you&#39;re you&#39;re
[1813.76s] pointing out to aren&#39;t offensive at all
[1815.88s] uh but yeah okay up 20% I think the wild
[1818.6s] card I wanted to address with you is uh
[1820.84s] um we talked about terrorists but the
[1822.44s] escalation of trade Wars in general and
[1824.0s] more protectionism would it Force China
[1826.559s] and some other competing Nations to uh I
[1830.72s] I I would say buy less of American Goods
[1834.76s] uh Tech right China has you know in last
[1837.76s] four year Cycles they they&#39;ve greatly
[1839.399s] Advanced their own Tech sector they
[1841.559s] don&#39;t need the the argument is they
[1843.039s] don&#39;t need apple or American chips
[1845.48s] anymore they can just make their own
[1846.799s] yeah look I think the conversation is
[1848.36s] gonna go something like this Mr G Mr xan
[1852.159s] ping uh you&#39;re taxing us massively on
[1855.76s] everything that we put into your country
[1857.36s] we&#39;re going to just match it so we&#39;re
[1858.76s] going to start at 60% we can go if you
[1861.559s] want to uh tip for Tat and go up to 100%
[1864.24s] we&#39;ll go up to 100% too if you want to
[1866.36s] go down to 30% we&#39;ll go down to 30% oh
[1869.279s] and by the way Mr gin ping if you want
[1871.039s] to have zero we&#39;ll do zero as well how
[1873.32s] does that sound and that&#39;s basically how
[1875.2s] the conversation&#39;s going to go so my
[1877.399s] guess is xiin Ping is initially not
[1880.12s] going to want to negotiate so Trump will
[1882.24s] just match him where he is which will
[1884.12s] look like 60% if you look at all the
[1886.36s] objective uh data out there what it
[1889.159s] shows is if in fact Trump uh initiated a
[1892.88s] 60% tariff on all Chinese Goods it would
[1895.44s] hurt Chinese GDP by two full percentage
[1898.72s] points so it would move from 5% down to
[1901.519s] 3% which is still in line or slightly
[1904.039s] better than the US is doing right now so
[1906.279s] bad news for China but not devastating
[1908.2s] news for China because when I first
[1909.559s] heard 60% like everyone else I I thought
[1912.279s] wow that would put them in a Great
[1913.44s] Depression they would be down you know
[1915.2s] their GDP would be negative 5% it would
[1917.48s] be you know uh uh train wreck it&#39;s
[1920.2s] simply not the case they become more
[1921.84s] consumption driven more internally
[1924.039s] driven so um I think the beauty of the
[1928.919s] Trump Administration why Chinese stocks
[1931.559s] did so well after the Trump Inauguration
[1933.919s] in 2016 to
[1935.679s] 2018 is because Trump is not an
[1938.279s] idealogue it&#39;s not uh we have to start a
[1941.639s] cold war with China just because their
[1943.519s] econom is growing it&#39;s let&#39;s get a deal
[1946.039s] done that benefits Americans americ an
[1948.32s] first uh we want to create jobs in
[1950.32s] America but we got to do a deal and it&#39;s
[1952.72s] not about creating the next Cold War
[1954.679s] it&#39;s about just getting more money for
[1956.44s] Americans and I think that&#39;s a different
[1959.36s] framework than the previous
[1960.88s] administration had which was China&#39;s bad
[1963.44s] period no need to talk they&#39;re they&#39;re
[1965.88s] our enemy they&#39;re they&#39;re our threat uh
[1968.799s] and uh and I think Trump just wants to
[1970.84s] do business I I just want to talk about
[1973.36s] retail one more time since you brought
[1975.08s] up xrt so January 2017
[1978.48s] uh in the months following the last
[1980.639s] inauguration of trump uh the xrt went
[1983.159s] down about uh 14% to it off before
[1986.679s] climbing back it didn&#39;t seem like the
[1988.12s] tax cuts worked in terms of stimulating
[1989.88s] consumer demand is that right well if
[1992.919s] you remember the tax cuts took a while
[1995.679s] to pass okay so it was a long process to
[1999.519s] get that through I think it was towards
[2001.0s] the end of the year that they finally
[2003.279s] got that done so um I I I don&#39;t think
[2006.76s] that has an
[2009.08s] immediate uh direct implication and
[2011.88s] don&#39;t forget that wouldn&#39;t kick in and
[2013.639s] put more money in the taxpayers pocket
[2015.44s] until the following year when they filed
[2016.96s] and got their returns and all of that
[2019.039s] now it might change expectations it
[2020.559s] might change sentiment it might change
[2022.0s] all of that but the the point that I&#39;m
[2024.44s] trying to drive home is
[2027.639s] um how people are thinking about the
[2030.24s] Trump Administration is completely
[2032.519s] different than what actually happened in
[2034.72s] Trump one and the uh policies and the
[2037.919s] Outlook and the appointments are really
[2040.08s] no different it&#39;s the same Red Hat they
[2042.159s] added one number to the side of it and
[2044.679s] uh same policies effectively the same
[2047.12s] proxies and I think you&#39;ll see the same
[2049.28s] result which is that uh it&#39;s it&#39;s an
[2052.2s] environment where Wall Street certainly
[2054.24s] does well but for the first time in
[2056.56s] decades Main Street was absolutely
[2059.399s] humming if you remember from 2016 to
[2063.079s] 2019 the average middle class person was
[2066.119s] feeling so much better small business
[2067.72s] business owners real incomes were going
[2069.44s] up and uh it&#39;s that type of excitement I
[2072.24s] think that you&#39;re going to see uh start
[2074.48s] to be felt next year and for the next
[2076.96s] three four years where everyone&#39;s
[2079.359s] participating versus just the people at
[2081.2s] the top what&#39;s the nfib uh latest uh
[2084.52s] small business optimism index showing
[2086.399s] right now you you know the sentiment
[2088.599s] indicators that I&#39;ve looked at are just
[2090.839s] starting to turn up for the first time
[2092.879s] in the last handful of weeks or months
[2095.48s] so I think that trend is going to
[2097.76s] persist under Trump even if you look at
[2100.88s] uh institutional managers while they&#39;ve
[2103.16s] become more enthusiastic they&#39;re not
[2106.28s] quite at euphoric periods if you look at
[2109.28s] the Bank of America fund manager survey
[2111.4s] they look like managers usually look
[2113.68s] coming out of deep troughs but not yet
[2116.76s] at Peak excitement Peak sentiment Peak
[2119.72s] positioning and I think the same is true
[2121.72s] for the consumer confidence which has
[2123.4s] been really low because of the price of
[2125.56s] groceries and different things that
[2126.839s] affect their every day lives is just now
[2129.68s] starting to turn in the right direction
[2131.28s] as as incomes are slowly starting to
[2133.599s] catch up and now on optimism On A
[2135.8s] Renewed set of uh different policies I I
[2138.599s] want to bring up one more step before we
[2140.2s] go uh Thomas just want to get your
[2142.119s] reaction to this this is an opet written
[2143.92s] by uh former FDIC chair Sheila bear I
[2147.0s] actually had the um uh pleasure of
[2149.44s] speaking with her this week anyway this
[2150.72s] was an uped she wrote CFA Institute
[2153.4s] recently surveyed over 4,000 of its
[2155.16s] members on the state of us finances
[2158.4s] um super majority 77% believe the US
[2161.88s] finances were on an unsustainable
[2163.72s] trajectory a significant majority 61%
[2166.48s] believe that the US lacks of political
[2168.0s] will to reduce its debt to GDP ratio
[2170.319s] while 63 believed we will begin to lose
[2172.599s] our Reserve currency status within the
[2174.28s] next 5 to 15 years first of all do you
[2176.319s] are you in this camp at all and does
[2179.16s] this sentiment have anything to have any
[2181.48s] effect long-term and or short-term
[2183.2s] effect on the bond market yeah two
[2186.079s] things number one they misspelt her her
[2188.72s] last name on the article I think they
[2190.359s] have it
[2191.4s] as b a i r it should be b a r I&#39;ve
[2195.56s] watched her interviews for the last 10
[2197.079s] years and she&#39;s consistently bearish uh
[2199.8s] so I&#39;ll leave it I&#39;ll leave that number
[2201.48s] two you&#39;ve got Elon and Viet coming in
[2204.2s] that are doing something that hasn&#39;t
[2205.44s] been done for decades if if ever uh
[2208.92s] which is they think they can cut$ two
[2210.52s] trillion dollars a cost let&#39;s say
[2212.119s] they&#39;re wrong and they can only do1
[2213.599s] trillion dollar of cost that&#39;s
[2215.48s] deflationary there&#39;s going to be a lot
[2217.079s] of people unemployed uh out of
[2219.72s] government jobs as they cut down
[2221.44s] different uh um uh agencies and they cut
[2224.88s] cut a lot of those jobs until they get
[2226.4s] absorbed into the private sector then
[2229.28s] you&#39;re also going to have an issue with
[2231.56s] uh
[2233.04s] labor different supply of labor than
[2235.48s] we&#39;ve had in the last four years as the
[2237.24s] Border gets closed up and maybe some
[2238.96s] people uh are returned back but
[2240.96s] certainly as the Border gets closed up
[2242.52s] so I think that um I think we&#39;re going
[2246.68s] to see a situ sitation where the
[2248.72s] terminal rate is higher than anticipated
[2250.599s] at 4% and I think inflation is going to
[2252.64s] be higher than anticipated they&#39;ll keep
[2254.72s] keep talking about 2% to pin inflation
[2257.44s] expectations but they know it you know
[2259.16s] it I know it everyone knows it they&#39;ve
[2260.92s] got to run inflation hotter in order to
[2263.599s] bring the debt to GDP ratio debt back
[2265.88s] down from 120 to a more reasonable level
[2268.76s] like we did after World War II from 1948
[2272.04s] to 1956 we took it from 120 down to 53
[2275.52s] and in those years inflation ran between
[2277.56s] 3 to 5% pretty consistently and you had
[2280.48s] hot nominal GDP growth which is exactly
[2283.56s] what we&#39;re going to see under the Trump
[2285.16s] Administration we are going to see
[2287.56s] nominal GDP run at levels that we have
[2289.839s] not seen in decades I think as you look
[2291.92s] two years out I could see I could see
[2294.8s] four five six handles like we haven&#39;t
[2296.92s] seen in ages and that will be do a lot
[2300.119s] to bring the ratio Down based on these
[2302.88s] policies that&#39;s nominal GDP what about
[2305.24s] real GDP what about inflation adjusted
[2307.56s] is inflation gonna catch up you think I
[2309.44s] think inflation is gonna be higher than
[2311.52s] 2% I think it&#39;s gonna be I think the
[2314.24s] mean is gonna be 33 three three5
[2317.079s] somewhere in that for the next five
[2318.44s] years and if we do that then then debt
[2320.44s] to GDP comes down and all the she Sheila
[2323.359s] b AR articles uh will be solved it&#39;s
[2327.8s] reasonable to have that fear I mean if
[2330.44s] you look at the numbers objectively
[2331.92s] today people should be worried uh I
[2334.56s] think that the country is worried enough
[2337.079s] that um you know the uh the voting
[2339.88s] electorate looked like a pizza not uh
[2342.52s] not blue raspberry Jello I mean when you
[2344.92s] looked at the map the country went red
[2347.52s] and it swept and it&#39;s why because they
[2350.2s] believed that uh in the short term that
[2354.319s] election could get these things in order
[2356.76s] now now we get to see if they were right
[2359.359s] and uh if in fact we can get our fiscal
[2361.839s] house in order but it certainly seems
[2363.599s] like if anyone could get it done uh Elon
[2366.8s] and vvec would be the people you&#39;d want
[2368.359s] to tap okay so that aside um let let&#39;s
[2371.319s] assume you&#39;re right so government
[2372.68s] becomes more efficient um what you know
[2376.04s] we we&#39;ll come back to that another time
[2377.599s] let&#39;s see how that plays out but let
[2379.079s] let&#39;s just address inflation before we
[2380.599s] go so you brought up inflation going
[2382.96s] north of 2% so this is what happened
[2385.119s] during the last Trump presidency
[2387.52s] hovering above 2% for most of the term
[2391.079s] there was there were periods when the
[2392.48s] CPI headline CPI was down below 2% uh
[2395.68s] but the the I&#39;m pointing this out
[2397.16s] because it didn&#39;t Spike considerably due
[2400.119s] to uh Trump&#39;s protectionist policies I&#39;m
[2403.079s] hearing a lot of this in the media the
[2404.839s] fear that inflation is going to go way
[2406.4s] back up because of tariffs that didn&#39;t
[2408.64s] really happen last time well the key
[2411.44s] thing there what&#39;s what&#39;s the key input
[2413.16s] cost to everything is energy yeah you&#39;re
[2415.68s] right energy was deflationary for some
[2418.04s] some parts of
[2419.8s] uh the last Trump presidency um yeah and
[2424.16s] it was coming off much higher levels too
[2425.96s] from 2011 to 2014 energy was really high
[2429.96s] in terms of price uh and uh and it was
[2433.359s] more normalized under Trump because
[2434.68s] Supply increased and he was blocked on
[2436.839s] some of the things to get supply going
[2439.04s] if you recall with the pipelines with
[2440.599s] the anoir with uh the opening up the
[2442.96s] different government things he&#39;s not
[2444.44s] going to have those type of restrictions
[2446.839s] certainly in the first two years of his
[2448.64s] presidency so there is a lot that he can
[2451.0s] get done that will be deflationary and
[2454.0s] and very very positive and very
[2455.56s] productive for the for the country so
[2457.92s] um so Allin it&#39;s a good economic formula
[2461.88s] I just think that
[2464.64s] um if if history is any prolog from 1932
[2468.44s] till
[2469.44s] today uh continued strength after this
[2472.28s] short-term November weekness into like
[2474.28s] after
[2475.119s] Thanksgiving uh into the inauguration
[2477.839s] stock should be up and then that six
[2480.24s] months it will have to consolidate while
[2481.8s] the market figures out policy the
[2483.44s] appointments and everything else uh
[2485.48s] before resuming uh some strength second
[2487.64s] half of the first year of the uh
[2490.119s] election cycle all right well you hear

[2582.88s] and we&#39;re back and then let&#39;s get down
[2585.359s] to some of the quotes of the week here
[2588.92s] uh as we kick in David teer who by the
[2591.48s] way one of the greatest of all time in
[2593.72s] my view uh and and empirically by the
[2596.559s] way that that helps too uh his number
[2599.8s] one position is now Alibaba and what
[2602.72s] David terer says is we keep our cool
[2604.96s] when others don&#39;t the point is markets
[2606.72s] adapt people adapt don&#39;t listen to all
[2608.4s] the crap out there so he&#39;s not known for
[2610.28s] his eloquence but uh he gets the point
[2612.04s] across and that&#39;s how Jersey Boys do it
[2615.0s] uh Warren Buffett in in the world of
[2617.96s] business the people who are most
[2619.16s] successful are those doing what they
[2620.72s] love and Seth claran it turns out that
[2623.72s] value investing is something in your
[2625.4s] blood there are people who just don&#39;t
[2627.24s] have the patience and discipline to do
[2629.04s] it and there are people who do so it
[2631.16s] leads me to think it&#39;s genetic the older
[2633.16s] I get the more I realize it&#39;s 100%
[2635.72s] genetic uh certainly you got to learn
[2637.64s] the core skills but uh there&#39;s some
[2639.839s] things that can never be taught and you
[2641.319s] find that out quickly our brand
[2643.48s] portfolio is the best in the industry
[2645.559s] says Stanley Black and Decker CEO Donald
[2648.2s] Allen Jr so excited about this one by
[2651.079s] the way uh they&#39;ve been putting in a
[2653.44s] base for a year year and a half uh and
[2656.079s] they&#39;re going to get rocking as uh as
[2658.559s] rates go lower over time but he was on
[2661.359s] with Kramer this week for an phenomenal
[2664.2s] interview where he laid out the plan to
[2666.16s] two and a half billion dollars of eida
[2669.0s] by 2027 basically two years away just to
[2672.599s] put that in perspective I think it&#39;s the
[2674.8s] stock is 80 it&#39;s probably up a little
[2676.68s] today but call it an $85 90 stock um
[2680.359s] been bouncing around between 80 and 100
[2682.76s] for you know a year and a half and um
[2686.72s] the last time that the business did
[2690.44s] 2 well they they never did 2.5 billion
[2693.48s] but the last time they did anything
[2694.68s] close 2.3 billion of Bida was in
[2701.8s] 2021 and the stock price traded to
[2706.44s] $200 a share so well more than a double
[2709.48s] from here he&#39;s not talking about 2.3
[2711.76s] he&#39;s talking about 2.5 billion and the
[2715.04s] plan hasn&#39;t changed since we got
[2716.64s] involved we&#39;re super excited so listen
[2719.0s] in
[2720.68s] here today Stanley Black and Decker the
[2723.119s] iconic power tool maker held an investor
[2725.16s] event here at the New York Stock
[2726.2s] Exchange with they laid out some
[2727.52s] exciting long-term targets for the
[2728.92s] business okay it&#39;s been a difficult
[2730.44s] stock to own I know over the past couple
[2732.16s] months something we know because we own
[2733.359s] it for the chapel trust da blacking
[2735.2s] Decker roared into the fed&#39;s First Rate
[2736.92s] cut because historically when the FED
[2738.319s] Cuts short rates wow long rates come
[2740.119s] down mortgages get cheaper people spend
[2742.24s] more on anything housing related this
[2744.0s] time the bond bond market didn&#39;t play
[2745.76s] ball and and long rates are actually up
[2748.119s] from when the FED first moved plus when
[2750.319s] Stanley Black and deer Reports most
[2751.8s] recent quarter management did talk about
[2753.319s] headwinds understood persisting into
[2755.48s] 2025 and of course were worried about
[2757.52s] the impact of potential trade war and
[2759.2s] tariffs so in less than two months the
[2761.0s] stock went from 110 to 85 and change I
[2763.92s] still think it works over the long term
[2765.48s] as I would would certainly wouldn&#39;t own
[2767.559s] the stock but let&#39;s check in with Don
[2769.4s] Allen he&#39;s the president show sty bck
[2771.24s] and Decker get a better sense of where
[2772.839s] the company&#39;s headed Mr Alan welcome
[2774.52s] back to M money it&#39;s great to be here
[2776.079s] Jim all right so D you had a big big
[2778.04s] meeting and you talked about a lot of
[2779.76s] very exciting long-term goals uh and I
[2782.48s] think it&#39;s pretty across the board that
[2784.0s] you want to make things let&#39;s say bigger
[2786.319s] and better so so why don&#39;t you give us a
[2787.52s] sense of some of the things you talked
[2788.599s] about because over the long term I think
[2790.24s] things are going to go very well here
[2792.16s] yeah so we spent uh about 3 hours with
[2795.359s] our key investors and a variety of other
[2797.8s] analysts that were either in person or
[2799.96s] on virtually and we focused on really
[2802.48s] making sure that folks understood how we
[2804.16s] were going to finish the supply chain
[2806.16s] transformation but more importantly what
[2808.599s] we were going to do to drive more value
[2810.92s] with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and get
[2812.68s] our evaa initially up to 2.5 billion by
[2815.559s] 2027 and then we see opportunity to go
[2818.28s] beyond that after 2027 and it&#39;s really
[2821.0s] going to be driven by we think will be
[2823.359s] you know probably a modest growth story
[2825.319s] in the short term but over time gaining
[2828.0s] more market share in DeWalt gaining
[2830.04s] market share in Stanley branded products
[2832.119s] and Craftsman and then driving more
[2834.64s] opportunities in the supply chain around
[2837.319s] product platforming better strategic
[2840.0s] sourcing etc etc so we were really
[2842.68s] excited about telling that story today
[2844.96s] that allowed us to really get people to
[2846.52s] focus on a longer period of Time Versus
[2849.2s] just the next 12 months well let&#39;s talk
[2851.28s] about the the brands I really want to
[2852.92s] focus on tools and outdoor for a moment
[2855.24s] you know it&#39;s dealt Craftsman Stanley
[2857.119s] Black and Decker cupy that which I know
[2858.559s] personally these are unbelievable Brands
[2860.92s] and a lot of times we think and I know I
[2862.8s] am definitely of this opinion these
[2865.079s] brands are bigger than the company&#39;s
[2866.76s] stock price so to speak you know they&#39;re
[2868.839s] they&#39;re remarkable brands that everybody
[2870.76s] knows and could you explain to people
[2873.24s] like how important they are I mean on
[2875.28s] the Lowe&#39;s call they talked about the
[2877.0s] being the biggest products and and and
[2880.04s] did did somehow things get lost in
[2882.24s] translation we start talking about
[2883.72s] tariffs we talk about rates we don&#39;t
[2885.64s] talk about the brands which are the best
[2887.04s] in the industry how do we kind of we
[2889.599s] Jive the two so to speak the portfolio
[2891.92s] brands that we&#39;ve created Jim is the
[2893.559s] best in the industry so we start with
[2895.44s] our dewal brand which is the pro brand
[2897.96s] for the construction industry it is the
[2900.16s] best professional construction brand out
[2902.119s] there today and then we have the Stanley
[2904.28s] brand which is for trades and
[2906.359s] professional construction and
[2908.119s] occasionally to do it yourself which is
[2910.28s] more oriented around hand tools versus
[2912.24s] the wal it&#39;s more power tool oriented
[2914.24s] and then Craftman is kind of the the
[2916.119s] do-it-yourself Enthusiast the person
[2918.119s] that works in their garage Works around
[2919.92s] their lawn and these three brands fit
[2923.079s] incredibly well together in a strategy
[2925.359s] and there&#39;s nobody in our industry that
[2927.359s] has the power of these three brands and
[2929.44s] when you look at these other brands here
[2930.76s] like Lennox Irwin black and&amp; Decker and
[2933.72s] CubCadet they&#39;re what we call Specialty
[2936.0s] brands that allow us to be targeted in
[2938.92s] certain niches certain markets they&#39;re
[2941.76s] not as broad as the three big Brands but
[2944.4s] they&#39;re very unique and they&#39;re very
[2945.76s] specialized and they differentiate
[2947.44s] themselves as well it is how hard to
[2949.839s] outrun the story of how rat didn&#39;t come
[2952.76s] down housing no you it&#39;s the worst
[2954.96s] housing market for turnover in 30 years
[2957.44s] and we also don&#39;t understand exactly
[2959.44s] what is going to happen with tariffs you
[2961.079s] can&#39;t necessarily go blow things out if
[2964.0s] those things aren&#39;t working in your
[2965.64s] favor that&#39;s exactly right I think that
[2967.96s] I think we all agree that long term this
[2971.079s] is a great industry interest rates will
[2973.52s] eventually come down to a level where
[2975.04s] mortgages are closer to 5% which I think
[2977.799s] is an important hurdle for us to get to
[2980.559s] which will free up more repair and
[2981.92s] remodel it&#39;ll free up more home sales
[2984.64s] new home construction and housing starts
[2987.119s] that will really allow this industry to
[2988.96s] get back in a much stronger place than
[2991.079s] it has been all right now let&#39;s talk
[2992.599s] about one that&#39;s strong and one that&#39;s
[2994.64s] not you&#39;ve got of some incredible things
[2997.48s] going in in Fasteners in Arrow but you
[3001.079s] also have Auto and auto slow you can&#39;t
[3003.96s] give away one point I just said oh why
[3005.92s] isn&#39;t Don just get rid of the auto but
[3007.92s] you don&#39;t want to sell that at a trough
[3010.0s] and arrow is just terrific but I kind of
[3013.4s] feel like it the the great nature of it
[3015.64s] gets lost in the shuffle of the brands I
[3017.72s] don&#39;t know yeah the auto Fastener
[3020.16s] business is very much a v business so
[3022.359s] when it goes down it goes down hard
[3025.24s] right when it recovers which interesting
[3027.44s] enough I think what&#39;s going to make this
[3028.64s] business recover is lower their lower
[3030.359s] interest rates because it&#39;s affecting
[3032.599s] you know car purchases as well so as
[3035.4s] that changes then I think you&#39;re going
[3037.599s] to start to see a v recovery where the
[3039.559s] business goes up fast that be and if you
[3041.68s] look at the previous recessions for that
[3043.52s] business that&#39;s exactly what they
[3044.88s] experienced all right so tell me as a
[3046.599s] shareholder and I&#39;ve told many people in
[3048.359s] the club this is the you know best stock
[3050.24s] for the longterm what do you say for
[3051.92s] people right now who are saying you know
[3053.48s] what I don&#39;t know I mean I didn&#39;t hear
[3055.2s] anything that says that next year is
[3056.319s] going to be a breakout you&#39;re 2027 maybe
[3059.04s] but uh but it&#39;s worth holding I mean
[3060.88s] what do we say well I think one of the
[3063.16s] things that we tried to get across to
[3064.599s] people today is that there&#39;s the power
[3066.68s] of the cash flow of this company that
[3068.4s] we&#39;ve kind of really brought back to the
[3070.4s] last two years and going to continue to
[3071.92s] do that next year and Beyond um which
[3074.319s] allows us to get our leverage where we
[3075.799s] want it to be and eventually buy back
[3077.64s] our stock so that&#39;s an important part of
[3079.52s] the strategy that we be focus on the
[3081.24s] other thing is that yeah there&#39;s going
[3082.68s] to be some short-term things like
[3084.599s] tariffs to navate $200 million head
[3087.0s] which is a big headwin but you know what
[3088.559s] you know we think we have a plan that we
[3090.319s] can execute on we&#39;ve already started to
[3092.28s] talk to some of our customers about
[3093.76s] price increases I&#39;ve spent a lot of time
[3096.28s] in DC talking to the new
[3099.119s] Administration and really making sure
[3101.16s] that we have a voice at the table around
[3102.92s] the Tariff process I completely
[3105.2s] understand what president Trump&#39;s trying
[3106.319s] to do with tariffs but I wonder if it&#39;s
[3108.599s] really something that shouldn&#39;t be
[3109.839s] broad-based but more specific to certain
[3111.839s] industries where Chinese products are
[3114.28s] more challenging coming into the US
[3115.92s] market that&#39;s not say our case right and
[3118.2s] and we&#39;re power tools and hand tools and
[3120.16s] those types of things 50% of what we
[3122.52s] sell in the US we make in the US and 25%
[3126.119s] of what we make in or what we sell in
[3129.319s] the US we make in Mexico and the
[3131.079s] remaining portion comes from China and
[3132.44s] Asia well it&#39;s much different from the
[3134.16s] way it used to be the reing has been
[3136.599s] important and you&#39;ve been working on
[3137.799s] this for a long time to me I look it&#39;s I
[3141.319s] think that all these things are
[3142.4s] momentary and we have to think longer
[3144.24s] term and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to stick
[3145.96s] with the stock excellent thank you so
[3147.799s] much to Don Allen president of Stanley
[3150.079s] Black and Decker you know their brands
[3152.079s] you&#39;ve all used them you know how good
[3153.88s] they are everybody&#39;s
[3155.76s] p and we&#39;re back now we&#39;re going to go
[3158.88s] on to some of the data here Disney shot
[3161.4s] the lights out absolutely phenomenal uh
[3164.119s] earnings which we covered last week
[3166.839s] China&#39;s economy St stabilizes after
[3169.04s] stimulus and we saw that in earnings
[3170.76s] which we&#39;re going to talk about in depth
[3175.2s] um look at
[3178.16s] China&#39;s um retail sales results by the
[3181.96s] way I got my balst straw shirt on thanks
[3185.119s] to my buddy Mike Bennett absolutely love
[3188.04s] it um so here&#39;s retail sales from China
[3192.319s] then we&#39;ve got retail fund inflows have
[3194.44s] driven money assets to record money
[3197.24s] market have driven money fund assets to
[3200.319s] record so there&#39;s still a tremendous
[3201.92s] amount of cash on the sideline that&#39;s
[3203.28s] getting forced in and you&#39;re seeing it
[3205.52s] in spades on like this and by the way
[3208.2s] it&#39;s so interesting obviously Cooper
[3210.72s] standard having a good day but uh the
[3212.88s] little sleeper that no one that that
[3215.24s] could uh I remember getting all the ask
[3217.92s] me anything questions call uh coming in
[3220.68s] on uh com stock resources when it
[3224.04s] dropped down to eight and change and
[3226.0s] everyone&#39;s like are you sure you still
[3227.48s] like this I was like yeah the intrinsic
[3229.16s] value is only $40 plus doll a share uh I
[3232.28s] really don&#39;t care about the thing moving
[3234.24s] a buck and now it&#39;s up to6 and just
[3237.04s] getting started
[3240.76s] uh
[3242.92s] 6 1565 I mean things up 50% in a handful
[3247.599s] of weeks so
[3249.88s] um okay International e-commerce revenue
[3253.079s] is growing while core segments stagnate
[3256.599s] so uh this is kind of a a an
[3262.76s] analyst um analysis here we we going to
[3266.72s] we&#39;re going to drill down first and
[3268.48s] foremost tbal and t-all uh revenues were
[3271.88s] up and when in looking at Pin duo duo
[3277.119s] the parent to teu uh which I said for
[3280.88s] many months the numbers are either
[3282.52s] unsustainable or unreliable they
[3284.92s] absolutely crapped the bed this morning
[3287.04s] and why because of fierce competition
[3289.359s] from whom from tawau and t-all keeping
[3293.16s] their share fending off the threat of
[3295.64s] them selling garbage stuff at low prices
[3298.119s] and as the consumer men&#39;s guess where
[3301.04s] the money is going it&#39;s going to the
[3302.839s] higher quality uh uh providers like tbow
[3307.0s] and t-o and as as the Chinese economy
[3309.88s] hums they don&#39;t want to buy the cheap
[3311.76s] Chinese crap they want to buy the high
[3314.319s] quality foreign luxury goods luxury
[3317.2s] Brands and uh and and tound and t-o is
[3320.4s] not going to grow 1% they&#39;re going to
[3321.76s] start growing five and 10 Perc Cloud
[3324.2s] shot the lights out we&#39;ll get into that
[3326.559s] absolutely incred 89 their eida was up
[3329.0s] 89% year onye uh revs were up nicely as
[3333.2s] well International continues to grow
[3335.559s] like crazy 30% or 29% and then these
[3338.839s] smaller businesses did just fine so
[3340.44s] we&#39;ll get into that retail sales was
[3342.559s] driven by what uh motor vehicle and part
[3346.92s] dealers this was the best component they
[3350.0s] also electronics and compli and
[3351.599s] appliance stores best component of which
[3354.28s] reminds me I got to go back and take a
[3355.839s] look at whirl poool uh we haven&#39;t done
[3358.799s] anything there but uh uh so new cars and
[3364.28s] part dealers so advance and uh Cooper
[3368.24s] standard on that pretty excited
[3370.079s] corporate profit margins near record
[3371.88s] highs I don&#39;t you know I&#39;m a mean
[3375.16s] reversion guy I think these can stay
[3377.559s] pretty accelerated with some of the
[3378.839s] Tailwinds with tack with AI with all the
[3381.559s] other stuff uh that&#39;s happening so
[3384.559s] that&#39;s a positive sign economic prize
[3386.599s] index City Group absolute positive sign
[3390.559s] Japan going through the floor same thing
[3393.119s] I&#39;ve been telling you guys all the
[3394.48s] money&#39;s going to flow out of Japan all
[3396.28s] Japan was was a money market for Asian
[3399.599s] investors that didn&#39;t want to be in
[3402.4s] China and India was uh um ahead of
[3406.96s] itself way ahead of itself in terms of
[3409.119s] valuations definitely the future of Asia
[3411.52s] more so than China but the next three to
[3413.559s] five years belongs to China One Last
[3415.359s] parabolic move and then we&#39;ll take the
[3417.2s] profits from Baba and start to find
[3418.92s] opportunities in India Japan absolutely
[3421.48s] not their demographics are toast no
[3423.2s] matter how cheap their stocks are there
[3425.28s] unless their most of their revenues come
[3427.2s] from abroad I&#39;m completely uninterested
[3429.839s] plus the the yuan is the uan the yen is
[3433.24s] going to
[3434.52s] appreciate um which is going to hurt
[3436.64s] them more leading economic indicators
[3439.039s] and real GDP moving up in the right
[3441.599s] direction this is all from yard Denny
[3443.319s] these green charts truck tonnage picking
[3445.68s] back up also rail freight loads picking
[3448.119s] back up those are the key indicators
[3449.88s] that you want to be looking at from an
[3451.359s] economic standpoint here&#39;s rail car
[3453.359s] loadings turning straight up this is the
[3455.68s] stuff you saw in 2010 and 11 not
[3459.359s] 1999 not 2007 when they were at Peaks
[3463.4s] this is turning up now at the beginning
[3465.559s] of a new midcycle
[3467.559s] uh um re
[3469.92s] acceleration uh that we&#39;re going to have
[3471.96s] by getting the terminal rate down to 4%
[3474.44s] and probably not a lot lower rail car
[3477.28s] loadings uh we got more of that for
[3480.839s] motor vehicle rail car loadings are
[3482.599s] picking back up as well Intermodal rail
[3485.119s] car loadings so um and then consumer
[3489.559s] sentiment is turning up not down and you
[3493.16s] you see these things coming out of deep
[3495.039s] troughs like in the early 90s uh
[3498.88s] recession coming out of that and for
[3501.52s] those of you looking for the recession
[3503.48s] we just had two in the last four years
[3505.2s] 2020 and 2022 when we have two
[3508.24s] consecutive quarters of negative GDP
[3510.64s] growth in q1 and Q2 so this is what you
[3513.76s] see you see these check backs and then
[3515.68s] recoveries like 2011 just like you saw
[3518.799s] in
[3519.88s] 93 um uh and even
[3523.599s] 2001 so we are just getting started
[3526.559s] economically speaking and I think people
[3528.16s] are seeing the pro business deregulatory
[3532.319s] policies tax-friendly policies moving
[3535.039s] forward are going to be so great for the
[3536.599s] economy and it&#39;s not just going to be
[3538.599s] the people at the top that do well no
[3540.16s] matter what the environment you&#39;re going
[3541.599s] to see like Trump Point 1.0 where real
[3544.2s] incomes rise for everyone everyday
[3547.24s] people people doing real work will get
[3549.72s] the benefits of this type of economy
[3551.72s] which is pretty exciting to see uh
[3554.599s] consumer optimism is coming off the mat
[3556.599s] but it&#39;s moving up in the right
[3557.76s] direction and that&#39;s going to
[3558.559s] reaccelerating job
[3560.96s] openings uh are down um off of extreme
[3566.079s] once at 100y year level uh so that will
[3569.359s] keep the FED in the market continuing to
[3572.44s] ease or at least posture towards easing
[3575.24s] which guidance is sometimes as almost as
[3578.16s] important as the action itself
[3582.88s] um nonfarm business productivity growth
[3585.92s] cycle is elevated that&#39;s good
[3587.72s] manufacturing productivity starting to
[3589.44s] get back up over the zero line like you
[3592.039s] saw after World War II and you see
[3594.44s] coming out of all deep troughs used car
[3598.599s] and truck prices coming down number of
[3601.72s] Motor Vehicle light sales going up so
[3604.92s] everyone was super depressed in October
[3606.88s] now you look at the October numbers and
[3609.0s] they&#39;re tracking on a 16 million SAR
[3612.92s] when everyone&#39;s been talking about 155
[3615.2s] let&#39;s see if that persists in November
[3616.839s] and December could be super duper
[3619.0s] exciting and as we all know what&#39;s the
[3621.319s] target uh in 2017 got up to mid to high
[3625.119s] 17s it depends on the data source here
[3627.0s] here&#39;s light motor vehicles but got up
[3629.319s] to the high 17s the company earned
[3631.28s] Cooper standard earned $7 a share traded
[3633.64s] 146 we&#39;re going to get there ladies and
[3635.96s] gentlemen the difference is we&#39;re going
[3637.319s] to earn a lot more than $7 a share and
[3640.16s] we&#39;re super excited about that Domestic
[3642.4s] Auto inventory to sales
[3644.52s] ratio this is what we want to see moving
[3647.319s] up off a depression like the Cash for
[3649.4s] Clunkers error like the 2001 error
[3652.0s] moving up in the right direction fits
[3654.4s] and starts are normal and then you get
[3656.72s] to where you need to go us Motor Vehicle
[3661.0s] sales
[3662.68s] uh let&#39;s see moving up to that 16
[3666.2s] million again so you had that check back
[3668.039s] over the summer that everyone got
[3669.319s] nervous about it has been sideways for a
[3671.68s] year I think we&#39;re going to break out
[3673.28s] here and move back up towards 17 and
[3676.0s] Cooper standard is going to Mint money
[3678.559s] like uh tra you could call Cooper
[3680.72s] standard the new treasury secretary
[3682.359s] they&#39;re going to print so much money
[3683.64s] it&#39;s going to be insane uh uh China
[3687.599s] nominal versus real retail sales ticking
[3690.28s] up China real retail sales growth
[3693.24s] ticking up not down up despite all the
[3697.0s] headlines uh nominal GDP versus M1 okay
[3700.559s] so this is the name of the game they got
[3701.88s] to get money supply going like this is
[3703.76s] this is economics 101 and guess what&#39;s
[3705.68s] happening it bottomed a few months ago
[3707.76s] it&#39;s turning up um same exact thing you
[3711.64s] saw in late
[3714.44s] um uh
[3716.96s] back in 2016 to 2017 turning up here
[3720.76s] once again M2 is turning up in China not
[3724.599s] down that&#39;s a positive thing M2 growth
[3727.319s] rate same thing consumer confidence in
[3730.119s] the US turning up this is all moving in
[3733.0s] the right direction China PMI turning up
[3737.72s] China foreign direct investment flows
[3739.559s] turning up from negative turning up not
[3743.279s] down ladies and gentlemen and then here
[3745.279s] are the two most important charts of the
[3746.799s] week as it relates to um Cooper standard
[3751.24s] look at what&#39;s happening to incentives
[3753.039s] ladies and gentlemen it keeps climbing
[3754.88s] every month it went to 7.7 and what&#39;s
[3757.279s] happening to prices they&#39;re leveling off
[3759.48s] maybe going a little bit down that&#39;s the
[3761.2s] name of the game we want we don&#39;t care
[3763.76s] about the margins that the oems make
[3766.279s] they should be erased to the bottom they
[3768.119s] had these housian days where they could
[3769.88s] control Supply during covid and rip
[3772.039s] people off by charging 10% above MSRP
[3775.079s] and play a a bad game on the public well
[3779.44s] now that game has changed they are going
[3781.52s] to be producing themselves like it&#39;s
[3783.599s] going out of style more cars than ever
[3785.76s] at lower margins than ever and Cooper
[3788.2s] standard is going to be putting the door
[3789.64s] ceiling the window ceiling the fluid
[3791.359s] transfer systems to Fuel Delivery
[3793.319s] Systems in every single one and God
[3796.2s] forbid Trump actually makes interest
[3798.92s] payments on new cars tax
[3801.359s] deductible uh we may see a a cycle top
[3805.44s] like we never seen before meaning over
[3808.039s] 188 million s seasonally adjusted annual
[3812.68s] rate and uh that is not in our models
[3816.119s] but certainly quite possible especially
[3817.72s] when you consider the average car on the
[3819.039s] road 13 years old it could be staggering
[3822.079s] deal track credit availability index you
[3824.079s] can see all the antidotes if you follow
[3825.799s] car car dealer on Twitter uh basically
[3828.96s] saying as soon as Trump got elected all
[3831.2s] the spets turned back on they are doing
[3833.279s] loans like it&#39;s going out of style
[3834.72s] subprime Prime doesn&#39;t matter if you
[3836.68s] have a heartbeat you&#39;re getting a loan
[3838.039s] for a car that&#39;s what we want to see for
[3840.0s] Cooper standard uh 75y year high in
[3844.039s] stocks vers US Stocks versus rest of the
[3846.0s] world this is the type of concentration
[3848.119s] where you want to take the other side
[3849.64s] You&#39; seen it two times in history once
[3852.319s] you had the opportunity in 67 to buy
[3854.48s] emerging markets in xus and dramatically
[3856.44s] outperform and the second time was in
[3858.88s] 2001 and you absolutely rocked the world
[3861.839s] as you saw uh money move out of
[3866.88s] um uh move back into emerging markets in
[3870.599s] next us and we&#39;re going to see that and
[3872.039s] that doesn&#39;t have to mean the US does
[3874.079s] poorly at all the us is going to do fine
[3876.48s] if I had to guess for next year I think
[3878.64s] earnings growth will probably be 13 14%
[3882.279s] I think the S&amp;P will probably be up 8 to
[3885.44s] 12% and I think fortunes will be made
[3887.72s] under the surface in the US and uh xus
[3891.64s] in emerging markets in China will be
[3893.72s] through the roof so um
[3896.72s] uh exactly the opposite of what everyone
[3898.599s] is saying right now just like in late
[3900.52s] 2016 to early 2017 in Trump one after
[3904.279s] the election and before the inauguration
[3906.4s] which we covered
[3907.88s] with um David so by the way check out
[3912.44s] his Channel at David
[3913.78s] [Music]
[3914.92s] Lynn uh on
[3917.72s] YouTube B of A Bull and Bear indicator
[3921.88s] again it&#39;s enthusiastic but it&#39;s not at
[3925.319s] a peak level yet um trading Tina Turner
[3929.88s] so here&#39;s from haret flow
[3932.359s] show uh okay what he says is what turns
[3935.88s] the trade before the inauguration day is
[3938.0s] further tightening in financial
[3939.48s] conditions Global mael most likely
[3941.68s] driver of higher FCI as companies front
[3944.279s] running tariffs uh October China export
[3947.76s] growth was the fastest since July of
[3950.039s] 2022 China has massively reoriented
[3952.839s] exports destinations California port
[3955.359s] volume volumes right now are jumping
[3957.64s] Port of Long Beach Imports a record high
[3960.359s] in
[3962.359s] October no asset allocators increasing
[3964.92s] bonds and international stocks right now
[3966.88s] but we say allocators heading into 1q uh
[3970.0s] 2025 should lean into bu treasuries okay
[3974.279s] we couldn&#39;t agree more if
[3976.96s] uh less and this is the thing that&#39;s
[3979.599s] mindboggling to me he&#39;s got two of the
[3981.799s] most efficient people effective people
[3984.079s] in the world in musk and vivc ramaswami
[3988.96s] that say they&#39;re going to cut two
[3990.16s] trillion so these guys tend to do what
[3992.52s] they say they&#39;re going to do but let&#39;s
[3993.76s] just say they don&#39;t realize what it
[3996.039s] takes to get stuff done in government
[3997.359s] and they only cut a trillion that is
[3999.359s] deflationary ladies and gentlemen
[4001.68s] deflationary not inflationary which
[4004.4s] means bonds are going to Rally next year
[4006.92s] the biggest two surprises of 2025 will
[4009.76s] be bonds rally yields compress dollar
[4013.279s] weekends no one is positioned for those
[4015.799s] and watch what happens and then the
[4017.2s] second thing that hartnet says which we
[4018.799s] again agree with buy International
[4021.079s] stocks China Europe before Inauguration
[4023.24s] Day China to ease fiscal policy and ECB
[4026.2s] to cut rates aggressively in
[4027.559s] anticipation of America First tariffs
[4029.599s] lower rates cheaper currencies lower oil
[4031.599s] prices means big easing of financial
[4033.319s] conditions in Asia and Europe relative
[4034.72s] to the US bare sentiment soon to
[4037.319s] approach buy humiliation levels here we
[4040.079s] are ladies and gentlemen so excited
[4041.96s] about that uh strong China export growth
[4045.2s] uh to to the rest of the world so while
[4047.839s] uh exports to us EU and Japan have gone
[4051.68s] down rest of the world are skyrocketing
[4054.16s] once again and uh and that&#39;s the name of
[4056.48s] the game you know all these things that
[4058.119s] we do to
[4059.76s] unnaturally um change the market I.E cut
[4063.72s] them off of chips Etc now they now
[4065.68s] they&#39;re developing their own chips
[4067.2s] before they used to be dependent on us
[4069.279s] like you know and now we&#39;ve made them
[4071.359s] independent and they&#39;re going to catch
[4072.72s] up uh um blocking the exports they&#39;ve
[4076.359s] just built stronger alliances with
[4078.24s] countries they wouldn&#39;t have paid
[4079.319s] attention to so you know you got to
[4082.319s] think second and third degree not first
[4084.64s] degree on some of these policies
[4086.48s] certainly you want to deter dangerous
[4088.92s] threats and there are ways to do that
[4090.68s] effectively but um I think we&#39;ll get a
[4093.599s] more pragmatic Administration in with
[4095.88s] big threats and then come to a table and
[4097.56s] do great deals and everything will be
[4099.92s] much better than it has been uh big
[4102.239s] government expenditures as percentage of
[4104.52s] GDP since
[4106.08s] 1791 VC and um Elon are going to knock
[4110.839s] this down we haven&#39;t seen this level
[4112.159s] since World War 2 which again we haven&#39;t
[4114.88s] seen the 120% debt to GDP since World
[4117.52s] War II and what happened it collapsed
[4119.44s] right after that same Playbook same
[4121.64s] story we&#39;ve covered it many times uh
[4124.359s] globalization to
[4126.12s] isolationism so you know for everyone
[4129.159s] that says can&#39;t do tariffs because it&#39;s
[4132.4s] going to cause a Great Depression like
[4134.48s] Smooth Holly tariffs had been climbing
[4137.4s] off a low like this from n from from the
[4140.719s] Spanish Flu 1918 for 12 years before
[4145.64s] Smoot Holly so the idea of doing some
[4148.199s] tariffs which by the way it&#39;s like oh
[4151.0s] we&#39;re unilaterally hurting these people
[4152.679s] no everything that Trump is going to do
[4154.92s] is going to say look you tax our Goods
[4157.279s] we&#39;re going to match you I mean it&#39;s
[4158.96s] very simple and and what&#39;s the cor to
[4161.56s] that if you don&#39;t want us to match you
[4163.64s] just take your tariffs down that&#39;s a
[4166.759s] simple very easy request eye for an eye
[4170.359s] tooth for a tooth and that&#39;s exactly
[4173.04s] what&#39;s going to take place so so coming
[4174.92s] off such a low base yeah we&#39;re going to
[4177.279s] see tariffs go up for a number of years
[4179.319s] before it becomes any major issue could
[4181.64s] be 8 to 10 to 12 years out if that
[4184.159s] persists and if the counterparties don&#39;t
[4186.239s] cooperate by bringing it down to zero
[4188.08s] it&#39;s a very thoughtful strategy versus
[4191.52s] like in fairness Trump has said for
[4193.64s] since 1980 on Oprah they&#39;ve been ripping
[4196.12s] us off for years and we continue to take
[4198.04s] it and we&#39;re not going to take it
[4199.199s] anymore and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going
[4200.6s] to happen for the next four years
[4202.48s] certainly the next two years so uh
[4205.159s] disinflation demographics peak in
[4211.6s] 2028 this is the world dependency ratio
[4215.8s] minus the economically dependent
[4218.8s] population uh
[4222.679s] the so that that&#39;s going to be an
[4224.719s] interesting fact Factor uh money market
[4227.28s] fund assets to all-time high 6.7
[4229.6s] trillion to a lot of this is going to
[4231.679s] chase into markets next year so be
[4234.159s] cognizant of that uh biggest outflow
[4236.92s] from gold since July 2022 we&#39;ve been
[4239.76s] covering that for weeks we said don&#39;t
[4241.0s] chase these guys at the top and there
[4243.04s] you go I&#39;m not saying that the gold run
[4244.96s] is over I&#39;m just saying they are higher
[4246.4s] and better uses from these levels
[4248.08s] there&#39;s no question about it record
[4249.92s] outflow from China equities past five
[4252.36s] weeks that&#39;s perfect the same exact
[4254.159s] thing happened in 20 16 right after
[4256.44s] Trump was elected and what happened
[4258.199s] after the inauguration the biggest rally
[4259.76s] in the shortest amount of time in
[4260.84s] history we&#39;ll cover that this week
[4262.84s] biggest outflow from utilities since
[4264.56s] March 2015 remember everyone wanted
[4267.12s] utilities four weeks ago I said guys no
[4270.12s] uh four eight weeks ago whatever it was
[4272.8s] uh now some of them are getting very
[4274.32s] interesting again because bonds are
[4276.36s] going to get bid uh
[4278.64s] 51.4% of consumers expect stocks to be
[4281.88s] higher over the next 12
[4284.12s] months um
[4286.199s] um funds are overweight
[4290.44s] momentum I wish this one went back
[4293.64s] further active fund position is still
[4298.56s] defensive Peak growth and expectations
[4300.88s] for the mag 7 which is interesting last
[4303.04s] time we were this high was right before
[4304.36s] the
[4305.32s] 2022 correction in Tech so for those of
[4309.32s] you you you could see what I was kind of
[4312.4s] jocking with Barney was trying to say
[4315.239s] you know trying to get me to say like uh
[4318.199s] you know about Nvidia and I&#39;m just I&#39;m
[4320.639s] like we don&#39;t own it we do not own it
[4324.6s] would you buy it we don&#39;t own it it
[4327.199s] couldn&#39;t be any clearer so uh so that&#39;s
[4329.639s] the story there and um on to the next
[4333.36s] who&#39;s left to buy the Magnificent 7 the
[4335.12s] answer is basically no one most crowded
[4337.159s] trade uh this cycle has been the most
[4340.4s] race sensitive in history five-year
[4342.12s] rolling correlation with ISM
[4343.96s] Manufacturing uh so as rates come down
[4346.36s] isms go up easing rate pressure should
[4349.36s] translate to a pickup in manufacturing
[4351.28s] this is the Trump economy manufacturing
[4353.76s] small caps Industrials Etc Wall Street
[4356.48s] Stock allocations typically fall as 10e
[4358.679s] rates move above 5% so we&#39;re below we&#39;re
[4363.719s] going to stay below not to worry we&#39;ll
[4365.88s] probably be in this range 3 to 4% on the
[4368.6s] 10year next year which increases stock
[4370.96s] allocations retail sales were up driven
[4373.56s] by cars
[4375.1s] [Music]
[4376.44s] um we covered that less cars it wasn&#39;t
[4380.639s] up that much ISM Manufacturing Empire
[4383.8s] State
[4385.04s] manufacturing uh empire state was
[4387.8s] through the roof this month and and
[4392.56s] ISM uh will catch that very very quickly
[4397.239s] Empire statement so so that&#39;s what
[4399.36s] happens you see every single time New
[4401.56s] York takes off uh ISM follows shortly
[4405.44s] there behind which is a big deal to get
[4408.04s] those manufacturing surveys up and part
[4410.239s] we covered that manufacturing activity
[4412.239s] surges in New York Region to the highest
[4414.04s] level in nearly three
[4415.88s] years uh and keep in mind manufacturers
[4420.0s] been in a Great Depression for the last
[4421.48s] two years this is a big big big news for
[4424.679s] the economy again the people that make
[4427.08s] stuff and do stuff are going to get paid
[4429.28s] which is really exciting
[4432.639s] um anyway uh daily shot Financial index
[4436.36s] conditions uh moving up uh S&amp;P 500
[4441.32s] around close
[4443.04s] elections well this one wasn&#39;t that
[4445.0s] close but the point is it goes up uh
[4448.6s] fewer cheaper sectors left they&#39;re
[4450.639s] talking telecoms not interested uh
[4453.28s] energy we have through com stock Banks
[4456.199s] we had a great trade on we still have
[4458.36s] the uh K we&#39;ll probably let that run for
[4461.96s] for a bit more uh we made a lot of money
[4464.239s] on that because it&#39;s been uh we bought
[4466.159s] it in the hole during that Silicon
[4467.76s] Valley debacle in
[4470.159s] 2023 uh what sector sector outlook for
[4473.199s] the next so no one wants real estate and
[4476.44s] utilities and Staples I&#39;m seeing some
[4478.56s] opportuni start to pop up in those areas
[4480.56s] that&#39;s what I like everyone&#39;s cramming
[4482.4s] into financials after they&#39;ve already
[4484.92s] doubled uh and Tech after you know so
[4488.04s] again same story happens every single
[4490.44s] time uh what is this this is the
[4493.0s] cyclicality of the year oh so what he&#39;s
[4495.48s] pointing to here is you get a big draw
[4498.44s] down in or not a big draw down but you
[4500.44s] tend to get a draw down in late November
[4503.48s] which we kind of just had and then you
[4505.159s] just rip higher into the end of the year
[4507.0s] which maybe we&#39;re seeing the inflection
[4508.8s] today would be very very
[4511.239s] nice
[4512.96s] um
[4514.48s] economics e Bloomberg economics Federal
[4516.88s] Reserve sentiment model coming off the
[4518.679s] mat that&#39;s good to see deflationary
[4521.159s] grocery prices almost going below the
[4523.159s] zero bound that is a big deal prices
[4525.96s] actually did fall one10 of 1% in October
[4529.44s] the first annual drop since January
[4533.36s] 2020 Japan retail investors sold stocks
[4536.44s] last week get ready to sell more they
[4538.48s] bought at the top they&#39;re going to sell
[4540.0s] sell all the way down China retail sales
[4542.8s] value going up China industrial
[4545.76s] production up uh biggest outflow from
[4549.6s] utilities some opportunities popping up
[4551.92s] there right before rates turn and
[4553.6s] compress National Association of active
[4555.88s] investment managers they&#39;re they&#39;re
[4557.679s] exposed but it&#39;s not at an extreme yet
[4559.639s] so we could get some nice strength into
[4562.12s] year end dollar coming up against this
[4564.08s] resistance this will be a huge surprise
[4566.639s] next year it will roll back
[4569.159s] over uh
[4571.0s] CPI
[4573.56s] good uh there we go by the way I had to
[4576.719s] get three car three cars registered in
[4579.36s] uh New York before shipping a few of
[4581.88s] them out to um California
[4585.48s] and I wound up going to this garage the
[4588.76s] guy had five bays and he totally helped
[4591.159s] me out because one of them I&#39;ve been
[4592.36s] running on templates for like six months
[4594.8s] because I just didn&#39;t have time to go
[4596.159s] get it registered and
[4598.92s] uh the car was coming the next day and
[4601.88s] closed to ship it
[4603.88s] out and uh if I didn&#39;t get the
[4606.32s] inspection done this the state of New
[4609.4s] York wouldn&#39;t send me title for the
[4611.28s] vehicle uh and um
[4615.32s] so he he totally helped me out he was
[4617.159s] jammed and turns out it was Charlie
[4620.96s] gasperino a fox business&#39;s cousin uh
[4625.08s] they grew up together completely small
[4627.159s] world and uh John the other brother was
[4629.56s] saying that Charlie was the smartest guy
[4631.32s] in school growing up and a serious boxer
[4634.36s] so many of you if you watch Fox Business
[4635.96s] you know Charlie gasparino and Ellie
[4638.239s] terret who&#39;s the producer who gave me my
[4640.199s] first break on TV on the Clayman
[4642.04s] countdown five years ago she&#39;s Charlie&#39;s
[4644.48s] producer now and she&#39;s known as the
[4646.44s] crypto Queen because she&#39;s the top
[4648.679s] journalist in
[4650.4s] the in the entire crypto community so
[4653.36s] keep a lookout for her if you have
[4654.679s] interested in crypto hopefully she&#39;ll
[4657.04s] get her own show one day so
[4660.679s] um S&amp;P risk premium back to 2001 levels
[4665.6s] I love everything that points back to
[4667.159s] 2001 levels because what ripped like
[4669.639s] crazy after that small caps and Emerging
[4673.04s] Markets small business op optimism
[4675.28s] turning
[4676.84s] up
[4678.03s] [Music]
[4679.239s] um National Association of home builders
[4683.12s] housing market index is turning
[4686.96s] up the data has been very mixed on
[4690.96s] this um because of because of rates
[4693.8s] rates will come back down home building
[4695.76s] will go up uh that&#39;s going to help also
[4697.96s] Stanley which we just saw in the
[4699.96s] interview Equity
[4702.48s] issuance this is the thing you want to
[4705.44s] own the big Banks because the issuance
[4708.96s] is going to go through the roof IPOs m&amp;a
[4712.32s] all that stuff&#39;s going to be on the
[4714.0s] question is how much of that is already
[4716.08s] priced in because we had doubles on the
[4719.12s] expectation that that stuff was going to
[4721.12s] absolutely fly in
[4723.4s] 2024 and it started to pick up um but I
[4728.04s] think a lot of that news is priced in so
[4729.96s] I&#39;d love to see a big pullback in
[4731.4s] financial so we could get back in we had
[4732.92s] such a big run on BAC and uh see and
[4736.719s] took profits uh we&#39;ll see if an
[4738.719s] opportunity opens up but we never sold
[4740.32s] the uh the K with the regional Banks so
[4743.04s] um all right earning sentiment turning
[4746.199s] up we&#39;re going to take a look at that uh
[4748.6s] in a second the estimates have started
[4750.6s] going back up after being flat forever
[4753.12s] 10 US Stocks account for 20% of the
[4755.36s] entire Global index haven&#39;t seen that
[4758.04s] since the early 70s those concentrations
[4760.6s] always get worked out everyone comes up
[4762.679s] with their stories of this why this time
[4764.48s] it&#39;s different and yada yada Y and a new
[4766.8s] narrative sold by the bankers and um
[4769.88s] pushed by the journalists and it&#39;s just
[4771.6s] never it&#39;s never this time is different
[4773.76s] it&#39;s always the same so um stretch
[4777.08s] valuation US market is reflected across
[4780.239s] most standard valuation metric so you
[4782.159s] can see n in the percentiles EV to sales
[4785.8s] free cash flow yield uh Price to Book
[4788.44s] Enterprise Value to EA forward PE
[4790.8s] they&#39;re all in the 95th to 100th
[4793.159s] percentile free cash yield is the only
[4795.48s] thing that&#39;s cheap 63%
[4797.84s] desile um so this is why we have such an
[4801.639s] emphasis on uh finding discret
[4805.96s] individual companies that are trading at
[4808.4s] very reasonable valuations just starting
[4810.239s] their turn rounds got through the dstock
[4812.159s] cycle now in the restock cycle which
[4813.96s] China&#39;s you know still in the middle of
[4816.04s] the dstock cycle probably six months off
[4818.36s] from the restock cycle and you want to
[4820.28s] be in ahead of those inflection points
[4822.48s] because when they go it&#39;s just straight
[4824.92s] up um forward P obviously a lot lower on
[4828.84s] the S&amp;P 600 than the regular indices
[4831.8s] that&#39;s where you find your opportunity
[4833.159s] in the US uh profit margins at record
[4836.0s] levels we
[4837.6s] covered uh containers coming through La
[4840.4s] alltime near all-time
[4842.48s] high PE ratios and you can see by sector
[4846.28s] small caps down here at 16 midcaps large
[4849.28s] caps at
[4850.28s] 21 uh midcaps also down here around 16
[4853.639s] so that&#39;s prices is what you pay value
[4855.36s] is what you&#39;re going to get that&#39;s where
[4856.32s] you&#39;re going to find the Big Value
[4857.8s] midcaps like VF Corp like gener uh like
[4863.199s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker like a lot of
[4864.76s] the names that we&#39;ve covered small caps
[4867.6s] Cooper standard Comstock resources Etc
[4870.76s] uh see these estimates turning back up
[4872.679s] for next year earnings uh estimates
[4874.96s] record inflow to large cap Equity Funds
[4877.56s] so everyone was buying mag S at the
[4880.08s] exact wrong time last week and and there
[4882.44s] we go weekly bankruptcy filings saying
[4884.96s] they&#39;re ticking up they couldn&#39;t be
[4886.6s] lower yeah they&#39;re ticking off off off
[4888.8s] like a dead dead level um tiny tiny
[4893.239s] nothing to even look at here same thing
[4895.239s] you saw in 2011 little Spike UPS after
[4897.44s] the collapse they&#39;ve absolutely rolled
[4900.08s] over um here&#39;s Morgan Stanley this is
[4903.679s] also a little worrisome because Michael
[4905.84s] Wilson who was the biggest bearish guy
[4908.12s] in the whole in October 2022 remember
[4911.199s] the trip Triple B break putt for those
[4913.52s] of you guys were with me now he&#39;s
[4915.32s] raising his price Target at 6,500 and
[4917.719s] that&#39;s predicated on the mag 7 which is
[4919.679s] the exact wrong way to think about
[4921.76s] things is being index bound versus stock
[4925.159s] bound where the opportunities are going
[4926.8s] to be but at least we finally got a
[4928.76s] little religion and it&#39;ll probably be a
[4930.32s] little bit right for the next 12 months
[4932.679s] Uh Russian leader Putin signs a new
[4934.32s] doctrine that lowers the threshold for
[4935.8s] using nuclear weapons that was you know
[4938.56s] not ideal but uh Trump will step in on
[4941.8s] that front and hopefully come to some
[4943.84s] positive resolution ution in a
[4944.96s] reasonable amount of time once he takes
[4946.639s] office on January 20th us home builder
[4949.32s] sentiment reaches 7-month high after
[4952.0s] election
[4954.04s] um here&#39;s the Tariff
[4957.159s] scenario this is a stair step over time
[4960.08s] this is Bloomberg&#39;s estimates for China
[4962.92s] and the rest of the world so they&#39;re not
[4964.199s] anticipating any rise in tariffs uh
[4966.6s] through the end of next summer and it
[4968.76s] will be a small stair step from 12% to
[4972.159s] 20% and then another year year and a
[4974.32s] half half and then it goes up to 25 my
[4976.719s] guess is it it it will probably be one
[4979.08s] set they&#39;ll meet us in the middle and
[4982.08s] it&#39;ll be elevated from where it is now
[4984.08s] but not uh anywhere near the headlines
[4987.0s] are advertising European stocks have
[4988.88s] underperformed us in eight of the last
[4990.719s] 10 years I would be looking for discrete
[4993.84s] opportunities there uh sets next
[4997.639s] year&#39;s S&amp;P 500 Target to 6,700 14% gain
[5002.28s] from here uh BuyBacks by corporate
[5005.239s] clients have accelerated in 2024 like
[5007.8s] you&#39;ve never seen before uh that is
[5010.52s] pretty
[5012.44s] significant US dollar total percent
[5015.88s] returns December is the worst month of
[5018.639s] the year for the US dollar so keep an
[5020.239s] eye on that that
[5021.88s] should be interesting to watch data
[5024.56s] centers could ignite a surge in power
[5026.56s] demand that&#39;s why gener gener has been
[5028.96s] doing so well
[5031.679s] um Equity indices trailing 12 well
[5035.0s] that&#39;s part of the reason uh 12mth
[5037.199s] earnings the other is hurricanes 12mth
[5039.56s] earnings per
[5041.44s] share hyperscaler this is an interesting
[5044.32s] chart hyperscaler capex growth is
[5046.6s] expected to decelerate when they move
[5049.0s] from training the large language models
[5050.679s] to inference the demand for chips is
[5053.52s] going to go down exponentially and you
[5055.6s] can see that
[5059.96s] um
[5062.239s] capex is going to start to to move down
[5066.32s] according to that Goldman Sachs uh
[5068.52s] article we forecast a 25% increase in
[5071.199s] completed us m&amp;a and the other thing to
[5073.56s] keep in mind is uh there will be new
[5076.159s] entrance and the dependency on tsmc for
[5080.8s] NVIDIA is only as good as tsmc until
[5084.199s] Intel comes online with their foundaries
[5086.0s] which the government will make sure
[5087.48s] happens and then Intel will be minting
[5089.48s] money like it&#39;s going out of style we
[5091.719s] forecast a 25% increase in completed m&amp;a
[5094.08s] trans transactions in 2025 that&#39;s going
[5096.719s] to help Regional Banks it&#39;s also going
[5098.36s] to Regional Banks because there&#39;s going
[5099.8s] to be a lot of consolidation in that
[5101.199s] group which is going to help small caps
[5103.44s] uh it&#39;s also going to help the people
[5104.76s] facilitating the deals um which should
[5108.52s] be the big Banks and the question is how
[5109.96s] much of that&#39;s priced uh probably not
[5112.04s] all of it but enough of it at this point
[5114.719s] where I&#39;d want to be a buyer at much
[5116.32s] lower levels gap between magnificent 7
[5118.96s] and 493 earnings growth is expected to
[5122.8s] narrow by the way I think last week I
[5124.84s] said we were hopeful to do a 30 minute
[5126.56s] call this week uh good luck with that uh
[5128.8s] we&#39;ve got too much to cover ladies and
[5130.28s] gentlemen too much stuff exciting stuff
[5132.119s] is happening uh so here&#39;s what you
[5137.199s] see mag s
[5140.159s] unmagnify by
[5142.44s] 2025 uh the game changes and you start
[5145.92s] to see them both in double digits and by
[5147.84s] 2026 they basically converge small
[5150.639s] business optimism turning up covered
[5155.88s] Goldman out with uh the art of the deal
[5162.119s] note
[5164.36s] bullish the other thing to keep in mind
[5166.92s] here is the seasonality of Nvidia while
[5170.04s] it&#39;s the weakest month of the year for
[5172.0s] the US dollar it&#39;s also the weakest
[5174.32s] month of the year for Nvidia stock so
[5177.8s] keep that on your
[5179.44s] radar merging stocks struggle versus the
[5182.28s] US you have not had an opportunity like
[5185.0s] this to buy emerging market stocks like
[5187.239s] since
[5188.239s] 20 2001 and you know what happened next
[5191.44s] we&#39;ve covered it many times but just a a
[5193.92s] reminder um most people are very excited
[5196.48s] to buy things up here and up here uh and
[5200.8s] you know it&#39;s not just Emerging Markets
[5202.48s] it&#39;s some of the other things that we
[5203.8s] just talked about a second ago uh and
[5206.159s] this is what they wind up with and no
[5208.199s] one wants to buy them down here and this
[5210.04s] is what they wind up with but the reason
[5212.08s] no one wants to buy it down here is
[5213.679s] because they can&#39;t can&#39;t live with or
[5215.28s] down here it&#39;s because they can&#39;t live
[5216.96s] with this for a couple years in order to
[5218.92s] get their in this case was a five bagger
[5221.76s] they can&#39;t live with the three years of
[5223.6s] uncertainty and up and down you know
[5226.0s] someone put on Twitter about Baba this
[5228.52s] is brutal what&#39;s brutal I mean like
[5231.04s] seriously the stock is $85 or $87 like I
[5234.44s] mean if if you&#39;ve been listening for a
[5236.4s] while pretty much everyone that that is
[5239.08s] on this call probably has a basis in the
[5241.08s] low 80s to mid 80s and some of you even
[5243.44s] in the 70s 60s you were buying in the
[5245.76s] hole like crazy when it got down to
[5248.159s] $58 uh who cares if it spiked up we knew
[5251.04s] it at they were going to rip out the
[5252.8s] idiots who bought at 117 take them down
[5255.6s] below 100 it took them well well down
[5257.32s] below 100 and now we get rid of those
[5259.08s] idiots and then we&#39;ll finally have our
[5260.84s] final move up and we&#39;ll talk about that
[5262.6s] later this is from Ryan Dietrich here&#39;s
[5264.44s] that seasonality in November you know we
[5267.199s] got that rally off the election then
[5269.92s] grinding and then we got some weakness
[5271.56s] everyone got scared out with the Russian
[5273.239s] thing and blah blah blah
[5275.119s] uh and now we&#39;re probably in that trough
[5277.04s] period here about before Thanksgiving
[5279.8s] and uh going to re accelerate into year
[5282.36s] end uh this is from VF Corp thanks to my
[5285.32s] buddy over there at steel basically they
[5288.0s] put a Buy Signal with a $27 Target and
[5292.0s] they&#39;re looking at $2 a share with no
[5294.28s] growth they say what if you do get
[5296.36s] growth it&#39;s going to be a lot more so
[5297.76s] their initial upside Target is $27 this
[5300.719s] is so exciting I remember being on TV I
[5302.84s] think it was with blizz claim in the
[5304.159s] stock was
[5305.239s] $15 and um you know it&#39;s very tough for
[5309.56s] people to believe when a stock is down
[5311.44s] that much that it could ever do anything
[5312.84s] good but you got a bet on the
[5314.52s] jockey um Brack and Daryl same thing he
[5317.6s] came into Logitech when the stock was
[5319.44s] down
[5320.32s] 82% uh within eight years he had a 26
[5323.04s] bagger so that means if you put a
[5324.36s] million dollars in Logitech when he when
[5327.0s] he took over the Reigns uh 8 years later
[5330.28s] you had 26 million bucks so I&#39;m not
[5332.199s] saying that&#39;s going to be the same case
[5333.48s] but you&#39;re betting on a winner and he&#39;s
[5335.199s] got great Brands there you got um
[5338.44s] Timberland and Northface which are going
[5340.28s] to be through the roof went as China
[5341.8s] recovers you got Vans which he&#39;s
[5343.88s] stabilized now the new schoolers are
[5345.719s] selling out he&#39;s got great stuff coming
[5347.56s] out uh you got um Dickies which is a
[5351.239s] quality work brand uh that uh that will
[5354.28s] that will recover and you can still sell
[5355.96s] the the PX business to generate some
[5357.8s] more cash to pay down debt their
[5359.6s] interest expenses come down with the
[5361.04s] sale of supreme he&#39;s doing everything he
[5363.119s] said he was going to do just just like
[5364.36s] Shane o Kelly with Advanced Auto Parts
[5366.76s] just like uh the guy we just heard from
[5368.96s] from uh um Stanley Black and Decker I
[5371.84s] love these type of businesses this is
[5374.28s] like for me I sleep at night because
[5376.92s] once I get solvency risk off the table
[5379.36s] then it&#39;s just a matter of time for the
[5380.719s] recovery I mean you know in the case of
[5383.28s] um VF Corp been around since 1890
[5386.28s] they&#39;ve been doing this stuff buying and
[5388.52s] selling brands forever um God what was
[5392.4s] the other one that we&#39;re that
[5394.639s] uh I think Stanley&#39;s been around uh
[5397.679s] almost 100 years as well there was
[5399.199s] another one that blew my mind that was
[5400.76s] over a 100 years old um okay consumer
[5404.88s] composite indexes again turning up us
[5408.36s] homes under construction so this is
[5409.8s] dropped off this we need to start to see
[5412.44s] and we&#39;re going to see I know there&#39;s
[5413.84s] going to be a solution in the Trump
[5415.119s] administration building permits will go
[5416.84s] back up uh and um and bring the cost of
[5420.36s] housing down um yes I probably we bought
[5424.36s] the top in Orange County but you know
[5426.52s] that that had nothing to do with an
[5427.92s] economic decision that had to do with a
[5430.8s] uh family decision but uh I did get it I
[5435.239s] still got a good deal and the reason I
[5436.84s] got a good deal is because and I gotta
[5439.719s] have good deals it&#39;s just in my DNA um
[5443.6s] so the seller uh had these these tenants
[5448.159s] in that their least because it&#39;s a huge
[5451.56s] anyway they had he had a bunch of people
[5453.56s] living in there and um but their lease
[5457.36s] didn&#39;t end till May so he couldn&#39;t list
[5459.52s] the house because no one wanted to buy
[5460.96s] it with tenants and so I offered him
[5463.8s] 75x uh he took it and then I just get
[5466.6s] and then I met the tenants I said uh how
[5468.48s] much do you get out by next week gave
[5470.159s] them 100 Grand and they were gone so
[5472.48s] there you go um it worked out and it&#39;s
[5475.239s] walking distance to the beach so that&#39;s
[5476.84s] that&#39;s not a bad thing either um so
[5479.8s] that&#39;s that firsttime buyers share of US
[5482.88s] housing prices US housing
[5485.92s] purchases
[5488.639s] um so again we got to bring that
[5491.08s] affordability down that happens in rates
[5492.719s] that happens in Supply and uh and there
[5495.32s] will be positive develops I think the
[5498.239s] biggest thing that&#39;s going to happen
[5501.4s] is somehow the Trump Administration will
[5504.719s] force or or incentivize local
[5508.159s] municipalities to open up zoning
[5510.159s] dramatically and if they can do that and
[5512.56s] they can create land Supply
[5514.44s] and they can bring rates down and
[5515.719s] affordability down even if they&#39;re
[5516.96s] building you know 1500 foot houses
[5519.159s] instead of 4500 foot houses I think
[5521.48s] that&#39;s going to get the thing absolutely
[5523.52s] cranking so uh that&#39;s that and then buy
[5527.84s] side positioning in small cap starting
[5529.48s] to turn up which is good slow rate cut
[5533.44s] cycle is actually a blessing in disguise
[5535.52s] so everyone&#39;s like oh I hope they go in
[5536.679s] December no you kind of hope they don&#39;t
[5538.88s] because in the in the instances where
[5542.04s] the The Cutting cycle goes more slowly
[5545.52s] the stock market tends to do much better
[5548.52s] uh here&#39;s sler from RBC let&#39;s get down
[5551.159s] to
[5553.6s] that um so we got a look here
[5560.0s] SNP moving up moving up drop back here
[5565.48s] now it&#39;s starting to work back higher
[5567.52s] again that&#39;s good news uh equal
[5571.199s] weight same story NASDAQ stack kind of
[5574.44s] stalling out here deciding if it&#39;s going
[5576.6s] to break to new highs or not I wouldn&#39;t
[5578.52s] be surprised if it does certainly after
[5580.04s] the inauguration uh but maybe led by a
[5583.159s] different composite of companies uh for
[5585.8s] the most part and then uh midcaps moving
[5589.8s] back up here which is good to see small
[5592.32s] caps just breaking out guys this is the
[5594.52s] name of the game measured move on this
[5596.119s] would take you up to 2,000 so we&#39;re not
[5597.92s] even started on small caps which is
[5600.36s] exciting because we&#39;ve been table
[5602.199s] Pounders for a long time it&#39;s nice to
[5603.84s] see that playing out
[5606.52s] um more seasonality oh let&#39;s see what
[5609.32s] the AI sentiment was by the way before
[5611.84s] we do
[5613.719s] that let&#39;s see AA sentiment results by
[5618.119s] the way I&#39;m going to be on CNA Asia
[5620.4s] tonight at 6:15 p.m. if anyone wants to
[5622.8s] tune in you can get it on their website
[5624.92s] that is like the BBC of Singapore goes
[5627.119s] throughout Asia tons and tons of viewers
[5631.36s] um okay so the bullishness came down a
[5633.52s] little bit this week bearishness went up
[5635.44s] a hair so that&#39;s good uh Emerging
[5638.52s] Markets again moved up pulled back to
[5641.159s] this uh support line we&#39;ll work back
[5644.679s] higher certainly after the inauguration
[5646.639s] same thing with the hangsang which is
[5648.719s] basically China Tech we had that huge
[5650.8s] shoot up in September October which was
[5653.159s] unbelievable and now we pull back down
[5654.96s] to this this is where everyone&#39;s getting
[5656.4s] ansy which is great get all the weak
[5658.119s] sisters out before we make our next move
[5659.92s] higher very similar to the 2016 to 2017
[5663.719s] election to inauguration period Tokyo
[5666.36s] can&#39;t get out of its own way a 10-year
[5668.76s] yield bumping up against this downtrend
[5670.719s] line this is going to roll back over
[5672.84s] same thing with the is there US dollar
[5675.92s] it&#39;s in this sideways Trend up against
[5677.88s] upper support this will roll back those
[5679.679s] are the big two surprises of next year
[5681.36s] Canadian dollar you all are nervous oh
[5683.08s] he said it was going to go up when&#39;s it
[5684.28s] gonna go it&#39;s going to go up I&#39;d beong
[5686.639s] the Canadian dollar here for sure uh oil
[5690.6s] no view but it looks like it&#39;s uh your
[5692.92s] risk reward is to the
[5694.639s] upside
[5696.36s] um gold rolled over remember here I was
[5700.159s] like nope everyone would say buy more
[5703.8s] anyway uh copper this is going to turn
[5706.639s] up with China&#39;s recovery next year so
[5709.199s] that would be another thing I&#39;d be
[5710.28s] buying probably a good pair of trade is
[5712.08s] short gold long copper but I I wouldn&#39;t
[5715.159s] short gold
[5722.36s] um all right Nvidia is kind of just
[5724.719s] hanging out here I think it&#39;s negative
[5728.52s] today what else Google got hit today
[5731.84s] pretty hard down
[5734.199s] 5% PayPal rocking and rolling we don&#39;t
[5736.84s] even talk about up 30% in the last few
[5739.239s] weeks um actually no it&#39;s up a lot more
[5742.44s] than 30% uh 30% is because that&#39;s when I
[5745.639s] talked about it on um vanney in late
[5749.44s] August and I was telling it&#39;s up 30%
[5751.92s] since then but uh before then
[5754.159s] and I remember these podcasts in the 50s
[5756.52s] no one you literally could not give
[5759.92s] PayPal away and um it&#39;s funny I&#39;m going
[5763.239s] to speak
[5766.0s] at the money show in Sarasota on
[5769.639s] January
[5771.44s] 7th and then I fly out to Orange
[5774.44s] County um and that was one of my three
[5777.48s] ideas last year and it did nothing and
[5779.28s] now it&#39;s just going all at once and uh
[5781.48s] it&#39;s just the first stop among many
[5784.239s] Alex Chris is doing such an incredible
[5785.84s] job on that uh any other stocks we need
[5789.159s] to talk about here so yeah the utilities
[5791.6s] are rolling over they&#39;re not cheap
[5792.679s] enough for me yet to get back involved
[5795.159s] but some of these are getting very very
[5797.159s] interesting CCI is great new money that
[5799.76s] came in we put to work in
[5801.639s] CCI uh existing money you ow own it
[5804.32s] lower and this is going to work
[5806.159s] dramatically higher next year as rates
[5808.76s] compress uh some of the Staples are
[5810.96s] starting to look interesting but not
[5812.28s] cheap enough for me
[5815.199s] the uh drug the weight loss drug stocks
[5818.04s] are getting hit because of RFK that&#39;ll
[5821.48s] probably be
[5822.52s] temporary but uh they&#39;re too expensive
[5825.0s] for me based on the valuations I think
[5826.719s] in what was it on
[5830.28s] uh I think it was in August we were on
[5833.199s] Yahoo and they made me do that segment
[5835.32s] on like one to buy one to not buy or
[5837.76s] whatever and I said and Lily is too high
[5840.639s] and they&#39;re like no but they&#39;re just
[5841.96s] getting started with the weight loss
[5843.199s] just like you hear in the Nvidia story
[5844.679s] and sure enough here we are from August
[5846.96s] to now it&#39;s from 972 down to 718 it&#39;s a
[5850.32s] pretty big drop ladies and
[5852.04s] gentlemen
[5855.96s] um
[5857.639s] suncore some of these energy stocks are
[5859.96s] kind of interesting but we&#39;ve got enough
[5861.52s] with
[5862.8s] uh com
[5865.599s] stock all right so that&#39;s sler let&#39;s go
[5867.92s] through some of the news real quick then
[5869.239s] the article of the week is pretty
[5870.36s] exciting I&#39;m I&#39;m even more excited to
[5872.239s] talk about Advanced Auto parts that I am
[5874.28s] Alibaba because Alibaba is just a
[5875.76s] waiting game that&#39;s that&#39;s a foregone
[5878.159s] conclusion Advance was looking a little
[5880.04s] sketchy there it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going
[5881.8s] to be a great great story and by the way
[5884.56s] the reason I brought up the guy in um
[5887.52s] New York uh so I asked him because he uh
[5893.36s] do you do any business with Advanced
[5894.88s] Auto Parts and he says 88% of our
[5897.52s] business and I was like why do you do
[5899.44s] 88% of your business with Advance
[5901.199s] because I just saw on the same road you
[5902.8s] got autos
[5904.08s] you have Napa you have all these guys
[5905.719s] he&#39;s like number one the people that
[5907.88s] they have at their desk actually
[5909.52s] understand cars uh they didn&#39;t come from
[5911.88s] working at Walmart uh number two they&#39;re
[5914.679s] fair prices and they get me the products
[5916.48s] quickly so that was really comforting to
[5919.04s] see because this guy like I saw five
[5921.32s] people walk in that say like I need new
[5923.88s] tires I need this and he&#39;s like okay I
[5925.76s] can schedule you four weeks out I mean
[5927.48s] this guy is so busy you couldn&#39;t believe
[5930.119s] it and the fact that with that mindset
[5933.52s] that he&#39;s trusting all of his business
[5936.599s] with Advanced Auto Parts was very
[5938.119s] comforting it&#39;s an anecdote but it&#39;s
[5939.8s] better than him saying no we haven&#39;t
[5941.599s] used them in two years they&#39;re terrible
[5943.56s] scumbags you know I mean he would have
[5945.159s] told me that too if that was the case
[5946.96s] and it clearly wasn&#39;t uh we&#39;ll cover
[5949.599s] Alibaba later I
[5951.44s] mean expanding user base accelerated
[5953.88s] Cloud growth we know that Chinese stocks
[5956.119s] rebound on guidelines to boost
[5957.52s] shareholder value more more stimulus
[5959.52s] that no one cares about until they do
[5961.32s] after the inauguration Chinese Banks
[5963.4s] surge as csrc guideline urging more
[5965.84s] shareholder returns lifts confidence uh
[5969.96s] City moves their uh Target price or
[5973.56s] price Target uh 12mth price Target on
[5976.159s] Alibaba to
[5978.08s] $132 okay here is
[5980.76s] the Kelly Blue book report which we
[5983.92s] covered actually incentives going up
[5985.52s] this is the name of the game for volumes
[5987.08s] this is the number one leading indicator
[5988.8s] to volumes is incentives the higher
[5990.599s] incentives go the more volumes you see
[5992.679s] autocredit availability increases across
[5994.719s] the board in
[5996.04s] October Disney gives investors years to
[5999.199s] cheer about we agree again no one wanted
[6002.0s] it in the 80s everyone now wants it well
[6004.04s] no still people don&#39;t want it which is
[6005.52s] exciting ant groups quarterly profit
[6007.8s] nearly triples okay we own a third of
[6010.239s] this company through our holding in
[6012.599s] Alibaba you have zero credit implied in
[6015.8s] the stock this will probably IPO in 2025
[6019.04s] and we&#39;re going to get a huge windfall
[6020.44s] from that as Alibaba shareholders but no
[6022.28s] one&#39;s talking about it alibaba&#39;s
[6023.92s] quarterly profit surges 58% on strong
[6026.76s] Cloud offshore e-commerce growth they
[6029.32s] also had some benefit of Mark to Market
[6030.76s] on some of the Investments uh if you
[6032.719s] remember last year they had a mark to
[6034.119s] Market mark down alibaba&#39;s sluggish
[6036.28s] growth in China Commerce drags Down
[6037.92s] results so here&#39;s the negativity even
[6040.599s] though they grew so we&#39;ll actually get
[6041.96s] to the facts
[6045.76s] um yeah it&#39;s mindboggling how that one
[6049.32s] author at uh Barons which she seems to
[6052.28s] have gone on a long extended vacation
[6054.199s] because the new riter is much better uh
[6056.8s] on China and then um then Bloomberg just
[6059.639s] consistently negative it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing
[6061.88s] I wonder how euphoric they will be when
[6064.08s] Baba&#39;s over $200 and all the China
[6066.52s] stocks are humming uh they&#39;ll probably
[6068.44s] be the biggest cheer leaders at that
[6070.04s] point but we&#39;ll time will tell uh Baba
[6072.8s] buys back 414 million ordinary shares
[6075.199s] $4.1 billion dollar of Buybacks in the
[6077.4s] quarter record uh Disney&#39;s turning
[6080.44s] record Parks profits even though even
[6082.679s] before the
[6084.199s] expansions uh us retail sales increase
[6087.159s] on
[6087.92s] Autos Alibaba okay that that&#39;s the same
[6090.88s] negative article from CH from uh
[6093.08s] Bloomberg Disney paints Rosie piic for
[6095.159s] coming years building products
[6097.199s] distributor qxo makes bid for Beacon
[6100.36s] Roofing so um this was exciting to see
[6104.44s] we&#39;ve covered qxo several times on this
[6106.52s] we own it at $12 looks like
[6111.88s] $12.70 um we made an exception for
[6114.84s] buying a spack above cash value because
[6118.04s] of Brad Jacobs so we&#39;re up on that one
[6120.96s] uh look I think they&#39;re paying up for
[6122.719s] Beacon rofin but he needs a platform and
[6126.159s] if they get it done he needs a platform
[6128.199s] and once he gets one I think there&#39;s
[6129.44s] going to be an enormous amounts of
[6130.88s] opportunities and synergies and the
[6132.44s] technology that he applies to make it
[6133.92s] more efficient and he&#39;ll work his United
[6136.0s] Rentals Playbook his qxo
[6140.119s] Playbook his waist connections Playbook
[6142.52s] one more time and that&#39;ll be a Monster
[6143.84s] Run for the next seven to eight
[6145.8s] years uh Walmart&#39;s earnings holiday
[6148.599s] shopping is off to a strong start which
[6150.56s] is great Boe to lay off 2200 workers the
[6153.96s] headline used to be before Christmas
[6155.84s] look they did it to themselves I mean at
[6157.96s] the end of the day
[6160.44s] um uh bad time to go on stroke on strike
[6163.679s] when you&#39;re uh company so they&#39;ll
[6165.8s] probably lay off another five or 7,000
[6168.199s] and half of those will be people who
[6169.48s] were on the strike uh asking for more
[6171.56s] money so some got more money some got uh
[6174.92s] so so some got a 30 or 40% raise some
[6177.4s] got a 100% cut and that didn&#39;t have to
[6180.679s] happen but um you know self-inflicted
[6183.08s] wound Joseph Sai Global Supply Chain
[6185.719s] becomes okay we got that Jose Sai PDD
[6189.199s] drops so they they got hit hard this
[6191.239s] morning they&#39;re down 10% today why
[6194.28s] because their numbers were unsustainable
[6196.679s] Baba&#39;s numbers still went up so they
[6199.159s] fended off the threat from these guys uh
[6201.719s] this is a garbage business in my opinion
[6203.76s] and
[6205.239s] uh there there you go Alibaba issues uh
[6208.96s] I think they did five billion in bonds
[6210.639s] to to fund more BuyBacks uh which is
[6213.679s] exciting to see
[6216.599s] Nvidia oh what was the thing here the
[6219.639s] guidance seems to show lower growth but
[6221.52s] this may be Nvidia being conservative
[6223.679s] shortterm blah blah
[6226.48s] blah launch of
[6229.04s] Blackwell uh one Supply constraints on
[6232.48s] Wednesday critical questions about black
[6234.48s] Wells production ramp and consumer
[6237.159s] concentration little room for execution
[6239.28s] missteps blah blah blah the big thing
[6242.08s] here is
[6244.28s] that they
[6246.52s] are there was a time when you could
[6249.8s] buy Nvidia and the higher the stock
[6252.88s] price went the lower the multiple went
[6254.32s] because their margins were expanding and
[6257.199s] their revenues were expanding and
[6258.8s] everything was well now their revenue
[6261.0s] growth is capped at 4 billion a quarter
[6263.32s] which is still amazing but their margins
[6265.599s] have stopped going up which means
[6266.96s] they&#39;re probably on their way to start
[6268.32s] going down uh so growth is slowing
[6271.8s] profitability is slowing and they price
[6274.159s] as if it&#39;s never going to slow price for
[6276.4s] Perfection and um so uh so not for us
[6281.0s] and um could it push higher for a couple
[6283.4s] of quarters yeah but the law of large
[6285.08s] numbers is going to kick in and
[6286.599s] competition is coming faster than they
[6288.4s] think article of the
[6290.52s] week it&#39;s all about confidence stock
[6292.719s] market in centim results so this is the
[6294.639s] most important chart you need to pay
[6296.32s] attention to and we&#39;ve covered it
[6297.8s] several times before but you can see
[6300.04s] here in
[6301.56s] 2016 that going into the election the
[6304.679s] month before and the month of October
[6307.119s] and November after a rally off the ripy
[6310.639s] face off rally off the bottom lows where
[6313.28s] the stock went from you know the 60s to
[6316.52s] $17 just like we just went from 66 to
[6320.119s] $117
[6323.52s] um you had three consecutive months
[6325.719s] lower month before Trump got elected
[6328.28s] month after Trump got
[6330.32s] elected month Trump got elected and
[6332.76s] month after October November December
[6335.36s] negative negative negative so we&#39;ve just
[6337.239s] had October negative November negative
[6341.32s] and uh I look history does not repeat it
[6344.88s] Rhymes so would it be shocking if we
[6346.96s] started to turn up in December no would
[6348.92s] it be surprising if we went a little
[6350.4s] lower before we rip higher and have the
[6352.199s] parabolic move after after the
[6353.28s] inauguration also know so the you know
[6356.08s] some people said oh could it be
[6357.44s] different and maybe we&#39;ll start rallying
[6358.8s] in December my answer is who cares I
[6361.56s] mean literally what is the difference if
[6364.04s] this type of move starts in one week or
[6367.4s] one month or four months at the end of
[6369.56s] the day as long as this happens the irrs
[6372.08s] on The Leverage and the options and the
[6373.56s] underlying stock will be so amazing and
[6375.52s] catch up for all the lost time that uh
[6378.239s] of this taking longer than expected to
[6379.88s] play out that it it absolutely doesn&#39;t
[6381.96s] matter all this did and we got to send
[6384.56s] the Christmas card to G is give us more
[6387.28s] opportunity to reload our options that
[6390.0s] we we were blessed with Mana from heaven
[6392.76s] in in uh in um September late September
[6396.36s] and early October it was unbelievable uh
[6399.159s] and now we have more than we had before
[6401.0s] that okay so we have reloaded and then
[6404.119s] some and we&#39;ll probably reload more in
[6406.08s] December if history holds and we get one
[6407.88s] more month of weakness before January
[6410.159s] takes off so um so that&#39;s the story
[6413.88s] there covered the two things during uh
[6416.96s] okay this week the two earnings results
[6419.36s] we&#39;re going to cover our Advan Auto
[6421.28s] Parts in Alibaba the common theme with
[6423.08s] these two are that their respective
[6425.0s] consumers are at or near the troughs in
[6427.08s] consumer sentiment consumer confidence
[6429.52s] and at Major inflection points for
[6431.48s] example if you believe the US consumer
[6434.239s] is going to stay at these levels of
[6435.88s] depression permanently you should sell
[6438.04s] your Advanced Auto Part stock okay so
[6441.159s] this is exactly how they looked in all
[6443.719s] the previous coming out of recessions
[6445.92s] and and again we&#39;ve been in a
[6448.04s] manufacturing depression not recession
[6450.599s] depression for two years and that&#39;s
[6452.199s] starting to turn the corner um and
[6455.84s] similarly if you believe that the
[6457.48s] Chinese consumer will remain depressed
[6460.0s] and never recover you should sell your
[6461.599s] Alibaba stock what that would also tell
[6463.88s] me is that you don&#39;t look at data you
[6465.4s] don&#39;t look at the housing prices
[6466.639s] starting to recover you don&#39;t look at
[6468.48s] the retail sales you don&#39;t look at the
[6470.0s] pmis you don&#39;t look at the exports you
[6471.92s] just look at the Bloomberg headlines and
[6473.599s] the former Baron headlines when they had
[6475.4s] that one person who wrote literally 135
[6478.719s] consecutively negative headlines um when
[6481.84s] she was writing about it so I&#39;ve made my
[6484.04s] career in in the mean reversion game and
[6486.36s] it has served me extremely well over the
[6488.48s] years one of my edges is recognizing
[6490.96s] extremes and betting on recoveries
[6492.8s] whether companies sectors and countries
[6495.44s] we are expressly in the time Arbitrage
[6498.159s] business and attract Partners investors
[6500.119s] who can weather short-term noise in
[6502.08s] exchange for long-term bounties we live
[6504.679s] to tell the story because we employ
[6506.32s] little to no leverage we run a
[6508.52s] concentrated High conviction portfolio
[6510.52s] in which some thesis play out much
[6512.4s] faster than we anticipated and some take
[6514.76s] longer but on balance we aim to realize
[6516.92s] fully valued exits within 36 months
[6519.8s] coming off despondent overshot low
[6522.32s] prices Advanced Auto Parts reported
[6524.44s] earnings last week the headlines were
[6527.84s] quote Advanced Auto Parts shutters 700
[6531.119s] stores to shore up Finance
[6533.44s] what it should have read is quote New
[6535.679s] Management with proven track record of
[6537.599s] success fixes years of Bad Decisions by
[6540.44s] previous Management in a shrink to grow
[6542.719s] strategy while maintaining healthy
[6544.8s] balance sheet through sale of non-core
[6546.96s] assets what is fascinating to me is that
[6549.88s] despite the negative headlines even the
[6551.679s] cell side who usually run for the hills
[6553.76s] from turnarounds were constructive with
[6555.8s] their outlooks Morgan Stanley had a base
[6557.719s] case of $50 price Target H with an $85
[6561.08s] bull Case Bank of America was was more
[6563.119s] pessimistic well below the 2026
[6565.8s] consensus EPS estimates of 313 per share
[6569.119s] and Ms estimates of 312 per
[6573.8s] share so what I always tell you guys and
[6577.8s] girls is the most important thing with
[6580.679s] turnaround situation is taking solvency
[6582.679s] risk off the table that&#39;s why the
[6586.04s] refinancing uh of Cooper standard was
[6588.56s] the critical Catalyst that&#39;s why the
[6591.52s] sale of
[6594.159s] Supreme for VF Corp was the critical
[6596.52s] Catalyst and with Advanced Auto Parts
[6598.92s] the sale of westpack was critical so all
[6601.88s] of them have basically taken solvency
[6604.159s] risk off the table now it&#39;s just a
[6606.0s] timing game for them to turn things
[6607.599s] around and get doubles and triples
[6610.0s] across the board and More in some cases
[6613.28s] um so what they&#39;re saying here
[6618.119s] is there&#39;s an opportunity to fill a
[6620.119s] massive productivity Gap you know
[6621.84s] operating margins they&#39;re targeting 7%
[6624.28s] versus the peers at 16% so even though
[6627.56s] they&#39;re only targeting
[6629.719s] 7% when I show you what that means in
[6632.36s] terms of operating income it&#39;s going to
[6634.159s] blow your mind and what the stock trades
[6636.88s] at when it hits levels of operating
[6638.76s] income of th of those levels
[6642.159s] um
[6644.52s] now Clos your storage resulting in $2 of
[6647.639s] eps at the midpoint looking out to 2027
[6650.48s] 7% operating margin is being targeted by
[6653.04s] extracting up to 500 basis points in
[6655.079s] merchandise efficiencies and sgna
[6658.44s] productivity which would result in $7 in
[6661.719s] earnings per share in our estimates okay
[6664.719s] they are not pricing this Morgan Stanley
[6667.4s] is not pricing this for $7 of estimates
[6669.719s] they are pricing this for $3 of
[6671.48s] estimates at $7 this thing could be $140
[6674.88s] stock um it&#39;s now trading at $37 okay um
[6685.52s] Chang
[6694.92s] undertaken okay so that&#39;s the story
[6696.92s] there Bank of America a little more
[6698.599s] pessimistic but they still come out to
[6699.76s] $3 by
[6702.04s] 2026 um so if solvy risk is off the
[6705.8s] table and you can buy it at these levels
[6707.28s] and revenues are static let&#39;s assume no
[6709.56s] growth um
[6713.8s] here we go f okay risk to the upside
[6716.4s] faster than anticipated comp and
[6718.0s] earnings recovery from restructuring
[6719.44s] initiatives significant improvements in
[6721.199s] Supply Chain management closing the gap
[6722.76s] between a Advanced Auto Parts and
[6724.36s] strongest peers and a strategic
[6725.92s] combination one with one of the larger
[6727.4s] peers they could get bought out that
[6728.719s] would be the worst case scenario for us
[6730.28s] because then we&#39;re going to get taken
[6731.36s] out at $60 or $70 when this thing could
[6733.48s] be a $100 plus if we just waited another
[6735.4s] year or two after that um and material C
[6738.679s] cash generation from planned asset sales
[6740.36s] enabling share repurchases and debt
[6741.92s] Payback payback above our our um
[6745.96s] forecast management was more sanguin
[6747.719s] than the sells side analyst and laid out
[6749.199s] a clear path to recovery over the next
[6750.88s] two years uh so they&#39;re reducing 500
[6754.4s] storage which is 10% they&#39;ve got about
[6756.199s] 5,000 and then 200 of the independently
[6758.599s] owned franchises which don&#39;t make much
[6760.32s] of a difference uh 7% in operating
[6763.56s] margin by
[6768.199s] 2027 2.5 times debt to leverage ratio
[6771.88s] and over five 00 basis points in
[6773.36s] operating margin expansion uh
[6776.36s] through uh what we
[6779.28s] covered so the most important thing here
[6782.92s] because you can read most of this on
[6784.48s] your own and I circled all the important
[6786.92s] points is
[6791.239s] this looking out to
[6793.92s] 2027 with all the stores
[6796.639s] closed and by the way the one thing that
[6799.32s] wasn&#39;t covered is closing unprofitable
[6802.56s] spread out stores in the West Coast
[6804.199s] where they have no synergies and
[6806.679s] actually funding they&#39;re going to open I
[6808.76s] think 50 30 new stores this year in
[6811.28s] areas where they have concentration and
[6812.8s] 50 next year uh by 2027 50 to 70 new new
[6816.8s] stores on 9 billion of revenues which
[6819.4s] basically assumes steady state no growth
[6821.599s] which they&#39;re going to have growth but
[6823.36s] no growth uh 7% operating
[6827.599s] margin
[6829.52s] okay yields 600 30 million of operating
[6833.96s] income ladies and gentlemen um the last
[6837.599s] four times that they had operating
[6839.639s] income in the 600 Millions were 2018
[6842.84s] where they had $600 million of operating
[6845.599s] income 2019 where they had $679 million
[6849.92s] of operating income and 2022 where they
[6852.639s] had 670 million of operating income in
[6855.679s] those respective years when the share
[6857.239s] count was much higher 10% 10.5% higher
[6861.52s] than today the business earned
[6864.52s] $5.75
[6866.4s] $687
[6867.96s] $7.70 per share in EPS the stock reached
[6871.639s] highs of
[6873.76s] $186
[6875.679s] $182 and
[6877.679s] $244 in each of those years when they
[6881.04s] had an operating income of 600 million
[6884.599s] and I believe management is being
[6886.36s] conservative because they&#39;re assuming no
[6888.88s] growth just taking 500 basis points of
[6891.36s] margin because they know longer have you
[6893.32s] know three stores within a thousand
[6895.32s] miles of each other and then they got to
[6896.88s] pay for a distribution center that they
[6898.44s] don&#39;t need just put them into the areas
[6900.36s] that they control on the east coast and
[6902.119s] put more stores there with less
[6904.159s] distribution centers you&#39;re going to get
[6905.639s] more than 500 basis points but let&#39;s
[6907.8s] just assume that they only meet their
[6909.52s] their conservative levels uh and earn
[6912.159s] seven bucks a share I mean we&#39;ve got a
[6914.48s] triple on our hands is really what it
[6916.0s] comes down to we entered this position
[6918.48s] with the expectation of a double over
[6920.159s] three years as we&#39;re now seeing Shane
[6922.04s] see CEO Shane o Kelly execute on the
[6924.28s] plan he laid out in Inception deleverage
[6926.639s] the balance sheet with the $ 1.5 billion
[6928.52s] sale of world pack close on unprofitable
[6931.04s] storage 10% consolidate supply chain our
[6934.119s] expectations have moved up while the
[6936.48s] sell side analysts have moved down it
[6938.28s] will not be an easy or short path but
[6940.48s] with solvency risk off the table
[6942.44s] following the sale of roal pack and a
[6944.28s] sensible shrink too strategy coupled
[6946.8s] with demand Tailwinds this could be
[6948.88s] another major turnaround Tom special in
[6952.36s] coming years let me re repeat that this
[6954.8s] could be another major turnaround Tom
[6957.679s] special in coming years not some easy
[6960.079s] double like vernado in six months or
[6962.32s] whatever I&#39;m talking about major and I
[6964.92s] looked at one of the analysts who wrote
[6966.679s] a very pessimistic report after earnings
[6969.199s] not he&#39;s not listed above he graduated
[6971.88s] undergrad in
[6974.36s] 2022 and it&#39;s LinkedIn picture looks
[6976.8s] like a high school yearbook photo a
[6978.639s] 23-year-old kid is trying to tell us
[6981.199s] what proven shano Kelly who ran a$7
[6984.0s] billion HD Supply for Home Depot is
[6986.52s] doing wrong look I&#39;ll bet on Shane every
[6989.119s] single day of the week just look at his
[6992.159s] background okay at HD Supply before that
[6995.679s] CEO of Interline Brands which was
[6997.92s] subsquently rebranded as Home Depot Pro
[7001.4s] before that CEO of Petro Choice largest
[7003.719s] distributor of lubricants and
[7004.84s] lubrication Solutions uh biggest client
[7008.0s] P Diddy just kidding uh he was also CEO
[7011.88s] of a Harris a specialty construction
[7014.719s] supply distributor and uh 7 years as an
[7018.679s] infantry officer in the US Army
[7020.92s] graduated from both airborne and Ranger
[7023.36s] schools and served as a rifle platoon
[7025.84s] leader and Company Commander he Comm
[7028.28s] completed numerous deployments with the
[7030.4s] first Cavalry Division and 325th
[7033.119s] Airborne oh and by the way he&#39;s got his
[7035.32s] MBA from Harvard Business School and a
[7037.52s] bachelor&#39;s degree from West Point so
[7040.0s] I&#39;ll take that over the 23-year-old kid
[7042.28s] who just wrote his first analyst report
[7044.159s] bashing the hell out of the stock any
[7046.4s] day of the week this is the natural
[7048.199s] sentiment of sell-side analyst when you
[7050.48s] are closer to lows the same Uber
[7053.32s] pessimists become the final upgraders at
[7055.52s] the next top several years out when
[7057.639s] their despondency turns to Euphoria if
[7059.92s] they still have a job at the exact wrong
[7063.32s] time so here&#39;s the drivers of the pl
[7065.84s] turn around number one uh strong demand
[7069.32s] drivers there&#39;s no question 13-year-old
[7071.079s] average car on the road they&#39;re breaking
[7072.639s] down they got to fix the parts their big
[7074.679s] strengths are batteries which you can&#39;t
[7076.36s] ship through the mail Amazon filters and
[7079.0s] engine management it&#39;s just
[7080.239s] non-economics to ship it through the
[7081.88s] mail two we are getting back to
[7084.52s] fundamentals of selling Auto Parts which
[7086.48s] focus on a blended box three our
[7090.119s] execution is supported by experienced
[7091.8s] leadership and improved liquidity four
[7094.0s] operational productivity review
[7095.48s] identified opportunities to improve
[7096.92s] profitability and five tarting to
[7099.48s] achieve 7% adjusted operating income
[7102.76s] margin by fiscal year
[7106.04s] 2027 so they&#39;ll have n billion of net
[7109.119s] sales with low singled digigit comp
[7112.079s] sales growth I think it&#39;s going to be
[7113.44s] more than low single digit when they&#39;re
[7114.96s] running it right 7% adjusted operating
[7117.84s] income margin and two and a half times
[7120.159s] leverage ratio so you can see here the
[7123.239s] number of light duty vehicles in
[7125.04s] operation so these are the macro stories
[7127.599s] bigger Market than ever before average
[7129.679s] light Vehicles average age of the light
[7132.88s] duty Vehicles is 13
[7135.36s] years um and so on so what actions have
[7139.92s] they already taken they sold whac they
[7142.96s] retained the Canada business they
[7144.32s] invested in the Frontline meaning people
[7146.88s] that don&#39;t come from Walmart people that
[7149.239s] actually come from the auto business
[7151.079s] that can talk to the pros like a pro and
[7153.76s] understand what they&#39;re asking for uh
[7155.56s] initiated the supply chain consolidation
[7157.56s] to build out a hub of Market Hub stores
[7161.52s] uh Market Hub of stores invested in
[7163.48s] price to improve Market competitiveness
[7166.44s] and establish talented talented
[7168.76s] leadership so it&#39;s DIY and its
[7172.119s] Pro um current a Advanced Auto Parts
[7176.44s] cash position of $2 billion includes RAC
[7179.52s] sale proceeds so $2 billion on the cash
[7181.679s] balance sheet they are not going
[7183.599s] anywhere solvency risk off the
[7186.719s] table uh here&#39;s the details about store
[7189.48s] operations merchandising excellent
[7191.199s] supply chain
[7194.32s] uh okay so they covered that all right
[7197.44s] operational impact greater than 75% of
[7200.239s] revised store footprint located in
[7203.76s] markets with number one and number two
[7207.0s] share so approximately 60 to 80 million
[7210.159s] in operating income savings so
[7213.639s] um so they&#39;re going to be they&#39;re
[7216.239s] they&#39;re basically going to invest in
[7218.079s] those areas where they have
[7220.639s] concentration and they are already
[7222.239s] number one and number two share which is
[7224.599s] huge versus all this stuff out here
[7227.239s] where they had a handful of stores and
[7228.719s] were wasting their time sending trucks
[7230.56s] thousands of miles to um to work if you
[7234.48s] look at the Northeast and down the East
[7236.079s] Coast they own this area and that&#39;s
[7237.84s] where all the money is and all the
[7239.04s] opportunity is so it&#39;s going to be a big
[7242.079s] deal and a big change and a very very
[7244.119s] smart exciting move
[7249.599s] um all right so
[7253.079s] it&#39;s funny when I&#39;m writing these things
[7254.36s] it takes hours and hours and it probably
[7256.159s] takes it to relay so you got to read
[7257.639s] that if you&#39;re going to be serious about
[7259.36s] it if you&#39;re not going to be serious
[7260.28s] about it then you just listen to what I
[7261.56s] say and you do what you do but
[7265.88s] um okay let&#39;s go into Alibaba we covered
[7269.52s] these charts this is what it looks like
[7271.719s] after the election goes down for two
[7274.239s] months into January and then it starts
[7276.159s] rallying into the inauguration and
[7277.96s] Beyond 20 150% rally and then straight
[7282.119s] away from the lows in December to the
[7284.119s] highs when Trump got out
[7286.079s] 228 Baba went from 85 at the
[7288.76s] inauguration to over 300 by the time he
[7291.44s] left office um look that&#39;s not the only
[7294.719s] Factor I&#39;m not saying that has to happen
[7296.36s] history does not repeat but there is a
[7298.599s] tendency to rhyme when different
[7300.119s] conditions are in place particularly as
[7301.719s] it relates to emerging markets in
[7305.119s] China and you can see that going back to
[7307.679s] 2001
[7312.48s] okay so the key things here uh just to
[7316.32s] summarize is earnings were fine tound
[7318.92s] t-all grew low single digits the AI um
[7323.92s] growth in our Cloud business accelerated
[7325.52s] from PRI prior quarters with revenues
[7327.28s] from public Cloud products growing in
[7328.92s] double digits and AI related product
[7331.48s] Revenue delivering triple digit growth
[7333.76s] by the way the AI product Revenue triple
[7336.56s] digit growth um not only did that this
[7340.84s] quarter has done that for the last five
[7343.0s] quarters okay and people are questioning
[7345.719s] uh whether they&#39;re going to it&#39;s going
[7347.76s] to be the greatest business that&#39;s why
[7349.28s] we mostly got involved but the actions
[7352.239s] they&#39;re taking on the retail business
[7353.76s] will actually have that to re accelerate
[7355.56s] as
[7357.0s] well uh purchased 4.1 billion reduced
[7360.8s] the share count by
[7363.159s] 2.1% Revenue was up 5% year-over
[7366.679s] year they DEC decreased non-cash share
[7371.159s] based compens
[7372.84s] compensation which was our big pet peeve
[7376.4s] they finally took action on
[7380.239s] that used to be all the shares they were
[7382.599s] buying were going back to to management
[7384.52s] which was a train wreck um Ned income
[7388.56s] was up 63% some of that was investment
[7392.32s] gains
[7396.679s] um cash flow was down because they&#39;re
[7399.36s] making investments in the cloud
[7400.56s] infrastructure and T so basically what
[7403.36s] they said is we&#39;re not going to just sit
[7405.04s] back number one we&#39;re going to get more
[7407.36s] and more Sharon Cloud no one&#39;s going to
[7408.96s] be able to catch us no one has been able
[7410.44s] to catch us but more than that we are
[7413.32s] going to stop timu and PDD dead in their
[7416.159s] tracks we are going to crush these
[7417.52s] little batches who have come up from out
[7419.679s] of nowhere and that&#39;s exactly what they
[7421.599s] did and that&#39;s exactly what you saw
[7423.88s] today which is you know um which is why
[7428.96s] pindu Duo got shellacked Baba said no
[7431.28s] Moss we got $880 billion on our balance
[7433.679s] sheet we&#39;re going to bury you and you&#39;re
[7435.159s] starting to see that um gross
[7438.36s] merchandise volume was double digit
[7440.199s] growth year-over-year big purchase
[7442.599s] frequency big user growth the rich
[7445.36s] customers the 88 VIP members they
[7448.0s] they&#39;re buying the luxury that&#39;s going
[7449.159s] to be the whole story as the economy
[7451.4s] recovers um increased by 46 million
[7454.48s] people during the quarter during the
[7456.199s] quarter 46 more million rich people join
[7458.84s] their platform that buy you know luxury
[7461.76s] type stuff um Cloud intelligence
[7466.719s] their uh revenues were up 7% the
[7472.239s] um Ai and Cloud related was up triple
[7475.28s] digits for the fifth consecutive
[7478.28s] quarter and you can read about that it&#39;s
[7480.76s] it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable they do
[7482.52s] absolutely dominate Ai and the other
[7485.52s] thing that they have like uh ant
[7488.52s] Financial which is not getting any
[7490.0s] credit is they have pieces in every
[7492.8s] single AI startup in China they just say
[7495.48s] okay we&#39;ll give you some free cloud and
[7497.44s] AI in in exchange for Equity you don&#39;t
[7499.96s] have to give us cash so you know some of
[7502.04s] these companies are going to be thousand
[7503.32s] Baggers and we&#39;re going to own a piece
[7504.88s] of them because of Alibaba Cloud but
[7507.8s] again no credit for it yet um the
[7511.52s] international Commerce continues to grow
[7513.4s] 30% 29% that&#39;s a big deal that&#39;s going
[7516.0s] to continue to grow the other small
[7517.76s] businesses are doing better getting
[7519.599s] closer to profitability in some cases
[7521.239s] profitability but if you look down here
[7524.239s] talau and
[7525.36s] t-all uh China Commerce Wholesale was up
[7528.4s] big they they&#39;ve proactively wound down
[7530.76s] their direct sales which has hurt them
[7533.36s] um their tound t- M minus the direct
[7535.8s] sales was up
[7537.32s] 2% uh aidc and by the way they said um
[7541.96s] 1111 is singles day absolutely did great
[7545.8s] so that&#39;ll show up in this
[7548.04s] quarter uh International
[7550.639s] 35% sale
[7552.679s] 9% aidc
[7555.159s] 29% the logistics business 8% local
[7558.44s] Services
[7559.719s] 14% the movie business which is Tiny was
[7562.599s] down 1% uh and all others what 9% for
[7566.0s] total growth of revenues 5% that&#39;s a big
[7570.0s] deal uh so that&#39;s that
[7572.88s] and the big thing with the cloud is not
[7575.679s] just that their revenues were up 7% but
[7578.32s] that their eida was up 89% for 3 months
[7582.4s] and up 115% for the 6 months year to dat
[7587.36s] so these are the big things uh we&#39;re
[7589.32s] optimistic about the government&#39;s macro
[7590.84s] stimulus policies and are confident in
[7592.599s] their long-term positive economic impact
[7595.04s] drive sustainable
[7597.199s] growth uh so look it&#39;s all there
[7599.84s] confidence in the future how they&#39;re
[7601.559s] taking actions and um oh and everyone
[7605.159s] worrying about the video all these
[7607.4s] people from 10 cent thinking oh we have
[7609.239s] video and all that stuff well
[7614.8s] um actually the video selling has gone
[7617.84s] down if you look at industry numbers and
[7619.8s] it goes plays Wells to our our advantage
[7622.239s] at T Bal and t-all because the brands
[7624.4s] need to be looking at which platform can
[7626.28s] truly bring them more sales rather than
[7628.96s] just simply displaying their products
[7630.599s] he&#39;s taking a a backhanded slap at all
[7633.079s] these video sellers that think they&#39;re
[7634.599s] doing well and the data for the industry
[7636.48s] for the video sellers who think they&#39;re
[7637.88s] going to take share from Baba are going
[7640.92s] down not up so while they&#39;re all going
[7643.84s] down Baba is holding steady because
[7645.8s] they&#39;ve made some Investments their
[7647.36s] cloud is going up their International is
[7649.28s] going up uh they still got $80 billion
[7651.88s] of gross cash on their balance sheet
[7653.92s] they&#39;re buying back stock like it&#39;s
[7655.44s] going out of style another 22 billion on
[7657.599s] the authorization they&#39;re proactively
[7659.8s] making Investments I mean what&#39;s better
[7663.559s] gaining share through making Investments
[7665.48s] or just having another1 billion of cash
[7667.48s] sit on the balance sheet I think at this
[7669.4s] stage right now the so far ahead in
[7672.32s] cloud and AI take some of that free cash
[7674.4s] flow make the Investments and just
[7675.84s] absolutely bury and leave all the
[7677.88s] competition in the dumpster and that&#39;s
[7679.36s] exactly what they&#39;re doing and that&#39;s
[7680.48s] why I&#39;m comfortable with the cash flow
[7683.0s] going down for these Investments making
[7685.04s] up because I&#39;m seeing the return on
[7686.88s] investments and that&#39;s what we need to
[7688.559s] see and Jeff agrees they took their
[7690.599s] price Target up to 42% which implies
[7693.96s] about a 60% upside uh sentiment here is
[7697.84s] kind of
[7699.36s] neutral and uh Insider buying in
[7702.96s] Advanced Auto Parts looks like Thomas
[7705.599s] seabolt uh a director bought $100,000 a
[7708.76s] stock directly wrote the check himself
[7711.52s] Dow earnings top 30 weights was revised
[7714.079s] down by
[7715.079s] 1.4% in the last 60 days NASDAQ was
[7719.119s] revised up by 1.6% for 2025 overall
[7723.119s] earnings starting to be revised up
[7726.079s] economic data uh jobless claims today
[7729.159s] came in lower than expected so that&#39;s a
[7731.04s] good sign
[7732.36s] and nothing really huge on the economic
[7734.52s] data front and now we are going to
[7738.199s] do um the ask me anything questions so
[7742.4s] for everyone who loves the ask me
[7743.92s] anything questions uh stick around for
[7746.96s] those of you who just like the podcast
[7748.76s] part thank you for tuning in we&#39;ll be
[7750.639s] back next week and uh make it a great
[7753.239s] one so here we go on the ask me anything
[7756.48s] questions first one comes
[7760.36s] from Lan
[7762.76s] Neo hey Tom more of a philosophical
[7765.32s] question how did you gain confidence to
[7766.719s] purchase Cooper standard in 2022 after
[7768.4s] it dropped 98% from its all-time highs
[7770.719s] did you know they were able to refinance
[7772.44s] and was that a catalyst for the stock
[7774.639s] thanks I&#39;d love to know your thought
[7776.44s] process behind enduring downturns
[7778.76s] especially since you&#39;re a fund manager
[7781.8s] um yeah I did know I didn&#39;t know that
[7784.639s] they would be able to do it but I knew
[7786.0s] it would be able to get done I mean I
[7787.599s] have a lot of friends in the private
[7788.84s] credit business so my general view was
[7791.4s] they&#39;ll get it done on their own and if
[7792.679s] they don&#39;t I&#39;ll make introductions for
[7794.159s] them and they&#39;ll eventually get it done
[7795.639s] and they did get it done Goldman uh
[7798.4s] completely raped them but uh got it done
[7800.84s] and uh took the solvency risk off the
[7803.239s] table and that and that was a key
[7804.48s] catalyst so I love that moving on
[7806.96s] Richard
[7808.199s] Lou like your Etsy idea but the
[7811.44s] confusing part for me is their share
[7813.239s] compensation a lot of their free cash
[7814.96s] flows do the employee share No that&#39;s
[7817.84s] not true let let me let me walk you
[7819.559s] through it really simple so he loves
[7821.4s] Etsy he&#39;s worried that he&#39;s they&#39;re
[7822.88s] giving the employees shares they they
[7825.32s] all do the same thing and they you know
[7827.36s] the CEO hires some outside the board
[7830.76s] hires some outside Consulting agent to
[7832.96s] pay them to say that it&#39;s okay to give
[7834.48s] our employees all this stock and uh and
[7837.119s] that&#39;s what happens and it&#39;s just the
[7838.96s] way it works but if you look at the
[7840.96s] numbers it&#39;s not egregious so they&#39;re
[7843.76s] they&#39;ve got 214 million in stock
[7846.28s] compensation but they repurchased
[7849.199s] $464 million of stock stock so they&#39;re
[7853.4s] giving away far less than they&#39;re buying
[7855.36s] in and they&#39;re still generating cash
[7858.04s] they&#39;re operating income was 437 Million
[7861.4s] last quarter so um that&#39;s not a reason
[7864.719s] to like or not like it that&#39;s just the
[7866.36s] way it
[7867.639s] is and not egregious by normal
[7872.4s] standards Joseph Baxter can you take a
[7875.28s] look at fizer uh I think it&#39;s okay I I I
[7879.52s] we haven&#39;t made it a position we covered
[7882.04s] uh many times in the last few weeks uh
[7884.639s] Martin Yang how do you feel about Canada
[7886.88s] Goose we own it we&#39;re fine with it we
[7888.96s] haven&#39;t added to it but I think we&#39;ll do
[7890.8s] some work on it this week and maybe add
[7892.4s] a lot more at these levels um but we
[7895.599s] haven&#39;t made that determination yet this
[7897.32s] is just the reason we haven&#39;t added a
[7899.639s] lot is because a lot of it&#39;s going to be
[7901.239s] the Emerging Markets recovery they&#39;re
[7902.96s] huge in China and in Asia so as that
[7905.84s] recovers next year they&#39;ll recover but
[7907.599s] we already have so much exposure through
[7909.04s] Baba it&#39;s like making two big positions
[7911.8s] makes no sense so I think we&#39;re
[7913.4s] comfortable with our positioning in but
[7915.52s] we have nibbled down at these levels as
[7917.32s] new money came in but uh uh maybe we&#39;ll
[7920.32s] do a little more but we don&#39;t want to
[7921.96s] get too Overexposed because we got super
[7924.079s] amounts of great exposure with uh BBA
[7927.44s] and they&#39;re going to trade similarly so
[7929.28s] uh leave it at that Dennis Davis lung
[7933.119s] thanks for providing great content as
[7934.52s] usual you&#39;re welcome I shared your
[7936.679s] insights with my connections but they
[7938.48s] all seem too focused on hype stocks uh
[7941.32s] know you were starting to look at solar
[7942.84s] stocks from your past couple podcasts
[7944.199s] what&#39;s your opinion on N phase I covered
[7946.48s] n phase uh still not interested in doing
[7948.719s] anything I think they&#39;ll work as trades
[7950.76s] I don&#39;t want to own them as
[7952.52s] businesses um but yeah I
[7957.199s] me
[7959.28s] pH I keep looking at them and most of
[7961.719s] them keep losing money but I know
[7964.159s] they&#39;re going to work as Trad so I keep
[7965.96s] looking at them and
[7969.679s] um I&#39;m just going to do anything with
[7971.96s] them yet so I&#39;ll leave it at that I&#39;m
[7973.96s] I&#39;m I am more than
[7976.96s] comfortable with an error Ono omission
[7979.52s] of omission on solar stocks they are
[7981.639s] crappy businesses they&#39;re super
[7984.04s] cyclical and um dependent on so many
[7986.92s] things outside of their control so if
[7988.559s] you want to gamble on a trade you&#39;re
[7990.559s] probably going to win okay so all these
[7993.159s] are going to go up and I&#39;m going to get
[7995.199s] the the podcast questions next year like
[7997.599s] oh remember when I asked you about end
[7999.28s] phase in November well now that it&#39;s up
[8001.88s] 75% do you think I should keep holding
[8004.639s] it even though you didn&#39;t want me to buy
[8006.199s] it um these are this is the type of
[8008.719s] nonsense I have to deal with but uh the
[8011.48s] answer is congratulations on getting
[8013.639s] lucky and get out while you can that&#39;s
[8016.0s] that&#39;s really the theme with when uh
[8018.48s] solar stocks go up so I&#39;m just not there
[8022.28s] yet I think I think there will be some
[8025.239s] like I I would feel comfortable buying
[8027.28s] First Solar But First Solar is not
[8028.8s] really a bargain so
[8031.639s] all the other are low quality garbage um
[8035.84s] that are going to work great as trades
[8037.679s] and we&#39;re probably not going to be
[8038.76s] involved because that&#39;s not what we
[8040.639s] do
[8042.76s] um speaking of which Alex Chris sent me
[8045.36s] an email all because we have a merchant
[8048.8s] with account with him uh early results
[8051.04s] from latest PayPal experience show an
[8053.119s] incremental 3.7 3 to 7% lift fast lane
[8057.0s] by PayPal our accelerated guest checkout
[8060.28s] uh drives an average 67% conversion for
[8062.96s] Shoppers with fast lane profiles PayPal
[8065.48s] pay later increases aov by up to 55%
[8068.88s] giving Shoppers flexibility to pay over
[8070.719s] time and pay with venmo lets 92 million
[8073.96s] active consumers who love venmo pay with
[8076.28s] their balance so uh just more excitement
[8078.639s] from the inside track but it&#39;s public
[8080.599s] information because he sent it out to
[8081.8s] millions of vendors so uh there you
[8085.0s] go how much value would you place on
[8087.679s] Insider buys as a signal uh I see a lot
[8090.239s] of advance Auto Parts directors have
[8091.92s] been buying
[8093.079s] stock um is it mostly noise or
[8095.76s] insightful uh not much weight I I pay
[8099.079s] attention to buys are way more useful
[8101.32s] than sells people sell for a million
[8102.92s] reasons they buy for only one and that
[8105.0s] is they think the Stock&#39;s going to go up
[8107.079s] uh as far as Cooper standard I&#39;ve talked
[8108.92s] to management about buying stock the
[8110.679s] problem is is they bought a ton in the
[8112.92s] 30s I believe and got smoked so when it
[8115.559s] was down from 146 to 33 they thought
[8118.599s] everything was going to be great except
[8119.92s] for the fact Co came so they all they&#39;re
[8121.88s] all upside down millions of dollars but
[8123.96s] they got tons of stock so they&#39;re
[8127.4s] partners because uh they bought tons of
[8130.36s] stock even though they bought it at much
[8131.639s] higher prices than we did so they&#39;ve got
[8133.4s] incentive to get it back up uh into the
[8136.32s] 30s and well beyond and and I know they
[8138.52s] will so umh yeah it&#39;s helpful but it&#39;s
[8142.559s] not critical Landon you know and the
[8146.239s] smaller the company gets the Dumber a
[8148.599s] lot of the managers are so and I&#39;m not
[8151.0s] not referring at all to Cooper standard
[8152.48s] I don&#39;t think they could execute any
[8153.92s] better than they have in the current
[8155.159s] conditions but I&#39;m talking about
[8157.159s] generally you see a lot of crappy stocks
[8159.239s] with insiders buying stock and there&#39;s
[8161.04s] no reason for them to buy because
[8162.239s] they&#39;re absolute dog garbage stocks uh
[8165.599s] and they&#39;re wrong they just buy their
[8166.92s] own hype so
[8170.8s] um short answer is Insider buys matter
[8175.36s] they&#39;re a low weight in our analysis but
[8177.76s] Insider sells don&#39;t matter that much at
[8179.96s] all Insider Buy are helpful to pay
[8182.559s] attention to because they got to hold
[8183.719s] the stock for at least six months I&#39;ve
[8185.639s] been looking at Nestle have you done any
[8187.44s] work on the stock or have have
[8190.079s] you uh I think we looked at this a few
[8192.479s] weeks ago and said not
[8200.04s] yet I&#39;d probably be more interested in
[8209.08s] Hershey but Hershey&#39;s not at a level I
[8211.719s] think Nestle is a not
[8213.479s] yet see if it comes down a lot
[8231.16s] more yeah cash flows re accelerating uh
[8234.479s] revenues going
[8237.08s] down margins have really compressed yeah
[8240.08s] I just want to see a little continuation
[8242.12s] of uh little recovery in
[8246.399s] revenues it&#39;s probably okay but you know
[8249.479s] if I
[8249.959s] [Music]
[8257.599s] say if I say looks
[8260.0s] great and it drops to 70 before it goes
[8263.24s] to 150 and then you got to say what&#39;s
[8265.92s] the highest and best use I mean it&#39;s not
[8268.04s] really going to be a triple or double so
[8270.559s] what do they have a big dividend is that
[8272.04s] what you&#39;re after let&#39;s take a
[8278.359s] look actually it should say
[8291.04s] here
[8292.92s] 3.92% I think you&#39;re close
[8306.16s] I think I&#39;d want to see like low 80s to
[8308.76s] mid 70s before I got more interested to
[8310.679s] do work so it&#39;s not yet but it&#39;s close
[8313.12s] good
[8314.8s] eye Greg alamari wanted to know your
[8318.639s] thoughts on
[8319.84s] oxy
[8323.319s] um no everyone keeps asking me we keep
[8326.88s] covering it every week it&#39;s fine but
[8329.8s] Buffett got a much better deal the
[8331.2s] reason he bought stock is because he had
[8332.76s] all these warrants he did a deal where
[8334.639s] he lent the money right before covid in
[8338.88s] 2009 he got a ton of warrants in the 50s
[8341.639s] so everyone&#39;s like he&#39;s buying all the
[8343.08s] stock up here in the
[8345.519s] 50s it&#39;s it look it&#39;s probably going to
[8347.76s] bounce up to 7580 over the next six
[8350.2s] months it&#39;s not a good risk reward trade
[8352.76s] so
[8354.2s] pass um Tom Hawkins
[8358.08s] hings this one came through for Le SCH
[8360.8s] technology another dog Solar
[8364.479s] stock negative free cash
[8379.08s] flow oh okay never mind I take that back
[8383.359s] uh
[8385.24s] Tom uh
[8388.2s] schs shls maybe this is the solar play
[8391.6s] that we&#39;ll look
[8395.64s] at yeah it&#39;s just they haven&#39;t been
[8397.479s] around long enough for me to be
[8398.64s] interested
[8408.04s] um yeah this one would be one I&#39;d put in
[8410.52s] my speculative bucket but I don&#39;t really
[8411.88s] have a speculative bucket because uh
[8414.84s] rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule
[8416.399s] number two is don&#39;t forget rule number
[8418.84s] one let&#39;s see
[8422.08s] battery energy EV
[8423.87s] [Music]
[8429.12s] charging man I don&#39;t know I I just want
[8433.16s] to avoid this I have no Edge on it I
[8435.319s] think it&#39;s going to work as a great
[8436.76s] trade and I want nothing to do with it
[8439.12s] we&#39;ll leave it at that Philipe Andrew
[8441.88s] pinkos thank you very much you mentioned
[8444.04s] Estee louer
[8451.52s] look I don&#39;t know how to run a make a
[8453.399s] business so I don&#39;t know what they
[8454.399s] should do but I&#39;m I I know the
[8456.319s] turnaround Playbook is cut a lot of fat
[8460.319s] sell off non-core assets delever the
[8463.24s] balance sheet and find a way to grow and
[8467.04s] uh and then in in their case all they
[8468.92s] all they really need is a Tailwind in
[8470.479s] China uh the reason it&#39;s not a huge
[8472.72s] position but it is a position is because
[8475.6s] it um it&#39;s the same trade as as Baba
[8479.52s] basically as the Chinese consumer comes
[8481.24s] back this is going to be a double or
[8482.439s] triple and it&#39;s a high quality business
[8484.64s] and yes there&#39;s competition yes I know
[8486.439s] about elf and I know about Sephora and I
[8488.16s] know about all this nonsense but this
[8490.399s] thing&#39;s been around I think since the
[8492.92s] 1800s uh and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll figure it
[8495.399s] out so uh to answer your
[8498.08s] question there&#39;s nothing I would tell
[8499.92s] management about what they should do
[8501.24s] that a normal turnaround Playbook
[8503.04s] doesn&#39;t do and anyone of a quality uh
[8505.8s] management experience knows how to do so
[8508.72s] they&#39;ll do it or or they&#39;ll replace is
[8510.76s] this the eo2 but at some point the
[8512.52s] business gets so cheap that
[8516.72s] um that it gets fixed and there&#39;s enough
[8519.6s] here to fix it essay louder is not going
[8521.8s] anywhere and uh and it&#39;s a good quality
[8524.52s] compounder over time what do you think
[8526.359s] of genmab gmab
[8528.96s] [Music]
[8541.76s] margins have collapsed no what the hell
[8546.08s] oh no they haven&#39;t all right what does
[8547.56s] this
[8549.399s] do develops antibiotic Therapeutics for
[8552.52s] cancer so they cure cancer I have no
[8554.399s] idea if they cure cancer and I have no
[8556.24s] Edge as to whether they cure cancer or
[8558.359s] not so if you&#39;re a doctor maybe you have
[8560.399s] something to say about it but for me we
[8562.6s] own a basket of Biotech xbi those are
[8565.6s] going to do great in
[8567.439s] 2025 um and uh we don&#39;t pick individual
[8570.84s] biotech or drug stocks we
[8573.399s] we people who get it right are often you
[8576.2s] know flipping a coin and then they get
[8578.28s] it right they think they&#39;re smart and
[8580.56s] the ones who don&#39;t get it right go out
[8581.84s] of business and you never hear from them
[8584.76s] Cava um I like Cava I actually eat Cava
[8588.439s] when I&#39;m in the city and
[8591.0s] um some people have been asking can it
[8593.12s] be the next Chipotle blah blah blah I
[8595.24s] don&#39;t know I mean I think it could but
[8600.92s] I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s as universal of a
[8602.88s] taste as the only reason I got
[8605.16s] interested is because they put steak on
[8606.64s] it now you know before they had it was
[8608.479s] like vegetarian nonsense and I could
[8611.439s] have zero interest in in that so the
[8613.92s] question here
[8615.96s] is what are we paying for
[8621.479s] it um I think the discretionary is going
[8624.84s] to come back next year like all the
[8626.279s] restaurants that are in the toilet I
[8627.88s] know we&#39;ve talked about Portillos my
[8629.6s] daughter Mimi loves the Portillos hot
[8632.399s] dogs and someone asked about that that
[8634.2s] probably already started to go
[8637.92s] Portillo
[8640.359s] PT no I got I got to take a look at
[8642.92s] Portillos and I got to take a look at
[8645.52s] Cava my guess
[8651.08s] is Cava is dramatically overpriced but
[8654.6s] let me just check on that before I make
[8656.64s] any draw any conclusions
[8662.279s] 14 times current
[8664.2s] sales nine times
[8666.6s] next yeah I just I just don&#39;t pay up for
[8669.319s] stuff and it&#39;s just not in my DNA
[8672.04s] so um
[8691.319s] about to
[8694.12s] Deb wow this is small business Cava
[8702.0s] too I mean it&#39;s packed where where I go
[8705.84s] on uh I&#39;m on 40th and they&#39;ve got one on
[8710.0s] 40th in
[8711.279s] Madison I&#39;m like 40th and
[8715.2s] 5ifth between fifth and sixth um
[8739.88s] all right so here&#39;s the issue I have
[8741.72s] with something like that you&#39;ve got an
[8743.04s] Enterprise value of 16.5
[8746.16s] billion
[8747.96s] on $900 million sales and $100 million
[8752.279s] of eida so I&#39;m paying and $53 million of
[8755.8s] net
[8756.56s] income so 20 time
[8761.88s] 16 300 something times earnings I
[8765.76s] mean it&#39;s crazy town so let them get
[8769.279s] smashed more and then I&#39;ll take another
[8771.04s] look at it I mean I get
[8773.52s] it
[8775.56s] but yeah if so what&#39;s Chipotle worth
[8781.8s] CMG I don&#39;t think they&#39;re not going to
[8783.72s] become the next Chipotle it&#39;s too nichy
[8785.92s] I mean people Chipotle has burritos and
[8788.96s] steak and meat and all this stuff this
[8790.68s] is a salad game and there have been tons
[8792.399s] of salad businesses that gone out of
[8794.12s] business chopped went out of business
[8796.52s] it&#39;s not enough so and people like Greek
[8799.319s] food but like once in a while like
[8801.76s] Chipotle you can eat every day this
[8803.68s] stuff it&#39;s like oh I want to be healthy
[8804.96s] I&#39;ll eat this salad stuff and because
[8806.52s] they put steak on it I&#39;ll actually go if
[8808.52s] they were going to put that Falafel crap
[8810.439s] not interested so Chipotle on the other
[8814.92s] hand
[8824.92s] um so Chipotle is an80 billion business
[8828.359s] with10 billion of
[8832.96s] sales earning a billion dollars so
[8835.12s] they&#39;re 81 times net income they&#39;re
[8837.279s] actually doing it it&#39;s again
[8842.439s] I look it it&#39;s not my wheelhouse I I
[8845.64s] think Cava is going to be a good
[8847.68s] business question is price is what you
[8850.12s] pay value is what you going to get and
[8851.72s] I&#39;m not willing to pay that much for
[8854.92s] that earnings power I can pay a lot less
[8858.12s] and get guaranteed earnings power that I
[8860.64s] don&#39;t have to speculate on whether it&#39;s
[8862.84s] going to be a good salid business or a
[8864.319s] bad solid business I know that cars
[8867.24s] break and people replace them that&#39;s why
[8869.2s] I like those businesses so um I like the
[8872.52s] idea I just don&#39;t like the price even
[8874.92s] though it&#39;ll probably work as a trade
[8876.64s] star surgical from Paul Falcone this
[8879.08s] one&#39;s probably going to be a good one he
[8881.2s] usually sends in good
[8887.52s] stuff
[8891.08s] sta all right so it was $163 stock it&#39;s
[8894.359s] now a $30 stock why is
[8898.16s] that implantable lenses for eye lenses
[8901.96s] to the
[8903.64s] eye treat visual disorders all right so
[8907.279s] it&#39;s like medical
[8908.72s] devices healthc care supplies which we
[8910.96s] have with Baxter and we&#39;re perfectly
[8912.479s] happy with but
[8915.84s] um let&#39;s see
[8923.279s] sta all right so they went negative cash
[8926.479s] flow negative and now they&#39;re recovering
[8929.24s] margins are up
[8931.84s] yeah so Paul&#39;s a guy who&#39;s been with me
[8934.6s] on this podcast for like four or five
[8936.24s] years and now he gets it I mean he picks
[8939.52s] good businesses at reasonable
[8941.88s] prices uh for the most part and
[8946.64s] um and this one&#39;s probably another one
[8949.479s] but again you have to do a ton of work
[8953.04s] from here just to just to look at the
[8954.64s] numbers and say uh this looks worth
[8956.68s] pursuing is one thing
[8965.76s] doing the work is hours and hours I
[8970.68s] mean just writing up the article about
[8973.319s] Baba and Advanced Auto Parts is 10 hours
[8975.68s] and that&#39;s probably 5% of the work you
[8977.8s] need to do to commit Capital if you&#39;re
[8980.76s] doing a good
[8988.2s] job how&#39;s the balance sheet
[9000.76s] here wow this is small
[9011.88s] business so 1.1 billion
[9022.84s] is this trading at 30 times
[9040.2s] evida
[9042.24s] yeah 40 times earnings
[9060.04s] yeah I I would have to get comfort in
[9061.72s] the products and in the growth
[9063.359s] trajectory to be willing to pay up that
[9065.359s] multiple but on balance it looks
[9068.88s] interesting that&#39;s all I can say about
[9071.04s] that
[9074.359s] um it&#39;s a very high multiple for what
[9076.68s] it&#39;s producing right now but there there
[9078.359s] must be a story that this growth is
[9079.72s] going to extrapolate forward so that&#39;s
[9081.2s] what you really have to understand is
[9083.16s] the defensible moat and the growth ratio
[9086.08s] and if you can get Comfort around those
[9087.439s] two
[9088.64s] things it&#39;s probably a decent time to
[9092.72s] start a position but
[9094.84s] again a lot more work to do on that
[9097.76s] one um nice work moving
[9107.08s] along Drew Robinson
[9111.24s] uranium no no no no no nuclear is going
[9115.04s] to
[9121.439s] happen I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t
[9124.04s] play just the Commodities it&#39;ll probably
[9126.64s] work as a trade you want to find some
[9128.6s] businesses that are going to benefit and
[9130.72s] it&#39;s too
[9132.479s] early uh one of the ones that we had a
[9135.319s] multibagger on was Rolls-Royce on engine
[9137.439s] servicing but they have the small
[9138.76s] nuclear SMR the small nuclear reactors
[9141.399s] but they&#39;re not going to convert until
[9143.0s] 2030 plus so it&#39;s it&#39;s early let let
[9146.2s] there be a Mania rally on that stuff
[9148.76s] when it crashes in two years that&#39;s when
[9151.279s] we&#39;ll buy stuff for the Final Phase uh
[9153.8s] for now it&#39;s not the
[9159.92s] time Jacob
[9171.6s] yeah still like comto Jacob Bob
[9177.52s] Johnson Ora mining we don&#39;t do miners
[9181.24s] I&#39;ll take a quick look but the answer is
[9182.84s] going to be
[9185.92s] no I I I have no I
[9189.68s] mean they just have an uncanny way of
[9192.399s] losing
[9193.68s] money regardless of the underlying
[9195.84s] commodity price
[9207.52s] yeah I mean it&#39;s cheap for now
[9210.64s] um but that can change in five it can
[9213.72s] change in one quarter I mean everyone
[9215.2s] was super excited about Cliff&#39;s natural
[9216.92s] resources and it&#39;s just been a you
[9221.479s] know uh not for me I think your
[9224.92s] financial analysis is correct Bob I just
[9227.04s] don&#39;t want to be in that business
[9229.88s] Max
[9231.84s] more mRNA uh no interest in that um I
[9237.04s] know it&#39;s cheap I know it&#39;ll probably
[9238.64s] work I have no
[9239.92s] Edge uh and I&#39;ve covered that a
[9242.16s] gazillion times uh how do you exit a
[9245.479s] position once it reaches your intrinsic
[9247.56s] value do you sell 20 30% it depends uh I
[9251.12s] usually don&#39;t put it all on at once and
[9252.8s] I usually don&#39;t take it all off at once
[9254.76s] some I&#39;ll take off a bit before
[9256.16s] intrinsic value you know maybe if
[9257.64s] something&#39;s up 45x I&#39;ll take off 20 25%
[9261.04s] even if I think it&#39;s going to go to 10x
[9263.96s] um and then you know I&#39;ll probably take
[9265.56s] off 50% when it hits my Target and then
[9267.92s] I usually keep 10 to 20% of a flyer on
[9270.2s] because just as things overshoot on the
[9272.12s] downside they have a tendency to
[9273.399s] overshoot on the upside but it varies uh
[9275.92s] by things and sometimes you know you&#39;ll
[9278.04s] have those parabolic moves where you
[9279.64s] just have to take it all off at once and
[9282.279s] uh and benefit from that way so no
[9283.92s] that&#39;s just experience you got to learn
[9285.279s] it by doing it um qua common
[9290.16s] think solar stocks are interesting what
[9291.56s] do you think of end phase I already
[9292.84s] answered
[9294.12s] that and that&#39;s it we&#39;re done we&#39;ll see
[9296.88s] you next week same time same place if I
[9298.84s] don&#39;t talk to you before Thanksgiving I
[9300.319s] will but whether you&#39;re here or not
