## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is due for a short-term pullback based on technical divergences and elevated investor sentiment. However, the intermediate-term outlook remains positive due to factors like potential Fed easing, strong household balance sheets, and opportunities in specific sectors. A business analyst approach is crucial, focusing on durable businesses with a margin of safety.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey | AI bubble cited as the biggest risk | Fund managers are waking up to the fact that MAG7 earnings growth has been cut by more than half while multiples have yet to come down. |
| 10-day Put/Call Ratio | Subdued | There's a lot of froth in the market still. |
| 1% EMA Advanced Decline Ratio | Diverging down | Usually when it gets down towards these levels, you've had a correction. We've not had a real correction. |
| NASDAQ Declining Issues | Showing a weakening of breadth | A few names are holding up the tech index, but most are deteriorating under the surface. |
| S&P 500 Hits All-Time High After 15% Drawdown | Secondary Drawdown Averages 6.4% | Somewhere between 3 to 9% in coming weeks would be reasonable. I think closer to six or 7% because of the stocks that are going to get hit have such high waitings. |
| Investor Sentiment (Bank of America Survey) | Near moving towards highs | I don't think we get anything more than a four to four to 9% implied correlation with S&P 500. |
| Retail Options Call Over Put Direction | Extremely High Call Buying | It's not a good time to be a buyer of equities when retail is buying this many call options. All of this premium is going to go to zero. |
