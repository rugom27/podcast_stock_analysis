[00:00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:00:02] Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:00:05] 313th videocast podcast for the week
[00:00:07] ending October 16, 2025. We got a lot of
[00:00:10] great data and market stuff to cover
[00:00:13] this week, but as always, family first.
[00:00:15] So, want to turn to Mimi's goal on
[00:00:19] Saturday. She had a couple. This is the
[00:00:21] one we're sharing this week.
[00:00:28] >> All right. Pretty exciting stuff. And
[00:00:30] then Annabelle had a meet. She won both
[00:00:33] of her events at Nova Aquatics. So,
[00:00:35] super exciting. Then I had the chance
[00:00:38] with Jim uh is my client here with the
[00:00:41] hedge fund tips hat. We'll leave his
[00:00:43] name out. Uh people like privacy. uh Jim
[00:00:47] Q and um and his friend Gary who invited
[00:00:51] me to play Shady Canyon which is so far
[00:00:54] in my view the greatest golf course in
[00:00:57] Southern California. Uh what an unbeliev
[00:01:01] and I'm a member of two others by the
[00:01:03] way. So I mean this one blew the doors
[00:01:06] off how amazing it was. Such an amazing
[00:01:09] time sp you know uh Jim and Gary are
[00:01:13] business partners together. They've got
[00:01:14] a great business uh all over the world
[00:01:17] and uh and they invited me on to play
[00:01:19] with them. We had such a wonderful time
[00:01:21] talking family, talking business,
[00:01:23] talking markets uh and playing a lot of
[00:01:26] golf. Uh really want to thank them. Had
[00:01:29] such an amazing time. Look at these
[00:01:30] background pictures. And uh there's a
[00:01:34] picture of me at the tea. That was nice
[00:01:36] of him to take more hedge fund tips. Uh
[00:01:39] some some cool uh areas around there.
[00:01:44] and uh really had it's just so beautiful
[00:01:48] uh that that chorus. Can't wait to play
[00:01:50] it again. Then I went to uh different
[00:01:53] car show. This was hypercars only. So I
[00:01:56] didn't bring any cars to this one uh a
[00:01:58] few blocks from my house here on the
[00:02:00] beach. And uh this was a Pagani uh which
[00:02:04] by the way turned out to be my favorite
[00:02:05] car. I've never actually seen a Pagani
[00:02:07] in person. They're sensational and um
[00:02:10] probably worth every penny. Uh, and then
[00:02:12] these guys had matching cars and
[00:02:15] choppers, which I thought was pretty
[00:02:16] cool. Uh, GTO. This is old school. This
[00:02:19] I love this stuff. I used to race muscle
[00:02:21] cars in high school. My friend Clayton
[00:02:23] and I, uh, Clayton did most of the work,
[00:02:25] by the way. Uh, I did a lot of the
[00:02:27] observing. Uh, uh, rebuilt a 70 Chevel
[00:02:31] 454 in high school. And, um, uh, GTO
[00:02:37] just I I love muscle cars as well.
[00:02:39] There's a Bugatti. pretty cool. Couple
[00:02:41] Bugattis. Uh
[00:02:44] I think that's a Pagani and that's a
[00:02:47] Konoang. Uh which which are amazing. I
[00:02:51] just think the Pagani has much more
[00:02:53] style. Uh so that was that. And then I
[00:02:56] was at, believe it or not, a Tony
[00:02:58] Robbins seminar. I haven't done that for
[00:03:00] 30 years ago. I listened to his tapes. I
[00:03:04] was going through all my journals when I
[00:03:06] uh we moved out from Connecticut to
[00:03:08] California and I looked at all the goals
[00:03:10] that I had set and every single one of
[00:03:12] them had come true in 10 years or less.
[00:03:14] Uh and and a lot of them way beyond what
[00:03:16] I could expect. And uh you know my first
[00:03:19] mentor Jim Ran said to me uh personal
[00:03:22] development first, productivity second.
[00:03:25] And uh as unbelievable and and
[00:03:27] incredible things have have uh uh been
[00:03:30] going the last handful of years, it was
[00:03:32] time to set uh new goals for the next 10
[00:03:36] years and really step up and level up.
[00:03:38] So uh had the opportunity to do that
[00:03:40] with Tony in town. How could you say no?
[00:03:43] Uh and that was just a fun fun
[00:03:45] experience. So, want to thank Xiao Dilva
[00:03:48] for having me on the BBC uh last night
[00:03:51] to discuss markets uh bank earnings and
[00:03:55] more. We're going to listen in here.
[00:03:56] >> Of three of the top US banks have warned
[00:03:59] that financial markets could be headed
[00:04:01] into bubble territory. Despite reporting
[00:04:04] bumper profits in the third quarter,
[00:04:06] well above estimates, the CEOs of
[00:04:08] Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and City
[00:04:10] warned that investor exuberance risked
[00:04:12] stock markets becoming unsustainably
[00:04:14] high.
[00:04:16] Thomas J. Hayes as the chairman of Great
[00:04:18] Hill Capital. He joins me live for more
[00:04:20] on this from New York. Tom, great to
[00:04:22] speak to you about this today. So, what
[00:04:24] do you make of these concerns that these
[00:04:26] banks are raising about the the
[00:04:28] financial markets and how they could be
[00:04:30] a little bit frothy?
[00:04:32] >> Well, I think there's something to that,
[00:04:33] Steve. Uh if you look at JP Morgan,
[00:04:36] obviously all the banks beat on the top
[00:04:38] and bottom line, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo,
[00:04:40] Goldman City, but uh Jen uh uh JP
[00:04:44] Morgan's credit losses for the third
[00:04:47] quarter were 3.4 billion, which was the
[00:04:50] highest since the first half of 2020. He
[00:04:54] also referenced the bankruptcies of
[00:04:56] Tricolor, the subprime auto lender, and
[00:04:59] the bankruptcy of First Brands, which
[00:05:01] had $10 billion of debt. that was an
[00:05:03] auto parts supplier. Uh so there's some
[00:05:05] some maybe some hidden risks
[00:05:08] particularly in the private credit
[00:05:09] market that they're alert to. And then
[00:05:11] if you look at the Bank of America
[00:05:13] global fund manager survey that came out
[00:05:15] this morning, it was cited by fund
[00:05:17] managers managing about a half a
[00:05:18] trillion dollars, 400 something managers
[00:05:21] uh that the AI bubble was the biggest
[00:05:24] risk to the market. So on the one hand
[00:05:27] we have a barbell. We we look at bank
[00:05:28] earnings which shot the lights out on
[00:05:30] deal making and on trading. On the other
[00:05:32] hand, we still have yet to hear from
[00:05:34] tech, and this is going to be the first
[00:05:36] quarter that their earnings growth has
[00:05:38] actually fallen by half from 32% in Q3
[00:05:42] of last year to about 14% this year. So,
[00:05:45] that guidance is going to have to be
[00:05:47] really, really good to keep these
[00:05:49] multiples as high as they are on tech
[00:05:51] stocks because the earnings growth has
[00:05:53] decelerated, but the multiples have not
[00:05:55] yet come down. And I think that's what
[00:05:56] these CEOs were referencing on the
[00:05:58] earnings calls today.
[00:05:59] >> And tell us a bit where these concerns
[00:06:00] lie then. You mentioned credit losses
[00:06:02] there. Could you elaborate on that and
[00:06:03] what that would indicate?
[00:06:06] >> Well, it's it's a warning shot. They
[00:06:08] could be discreet one-off events, but
[00:06:10] you keep your eyes on it because right
[00:06:12] now credit spreads are compressed. If
[00:06:14] you see a few more major bankruptcies,
[00:06:16] credit spreads will start to widen,
[00:06:18] which will make it tougher for companies
[00:06:20] to refinance. That's the bad news. The
[00:06:21] good news is Chair Powell seemed alert
[00:06:24] to these risks today as certainly in
[00:06:25] employment and basically said right
[00:06:28] before the blackout period implied that
[00:06:30] the that that another cut was coming. So
[00:06:32] on the one hand you have a little bit of
[00:06:34] froth in credit markets and and in some
[00:06:36] pockets of the equity markets. On the
[00:06:38] other hand, we're moving into an easing
[00:06:40] environment which is going to help a lot
[00:06:42] of companies refinance. And maybe some
[00:06:44] of these uh bankruptcies were actually
[00:06:46] due to the fact that rates uh rose so
[00:06:49] quickly and have stayed restrictive for
[00:06:51] so long. And as that restrictive Fed
[00:06:53] policy comes out of the markets, uh it
[00:06:56] could actually uh uh put some some
[00:06:58] tailwinds behind the economy. And and I
[00:07:00] think the IMF uh was signaling as much
[00:07:03] today in their increased outlook of of
[00:07:05] the global economy at 3.2%.
[00:07:07] >> And Fed and and Pal as you mentioned,
[00:07:09] they'll be looking at all this data
[00:07:10] cautiously.
[00:07:12] >> That's correct. Yeah. And uh you know
[00:07:14] Powell has has intimated that he's now
[00:07:17] going to be less restrictive. He's alert
[00:07:19] to the the dual-sided risk and
[00:07:21] predominantly focused on employment now.
[00:07:24] We've seen the tariff inflation come in
[00:07:26] less than expected. Uh and the banks
[00:07:28] overall, you know, we're we're focused
[00:07:30] on the negatives, but the positives are
[00:07:32] record banking profits. Animal spirits
[00:07:35] are back. Goldman Sachs investment
[00:07:36] banking revenue was up 42%. Uh JP Morgan
[00:07:40] was up 16%. And then on the trading
[00:07:42] side, JP Morgan at up 25%. So, positive
[00:07:46] stuff happening.
[00:07:47] >> Yeah, the banks will certainly be happy.
[00:07:49] Thanks very much, Tom, for that. Thomas
[00:07:50] J. Hayes there, chairman of Great Hill
[00:07:52] Capital. Leave it there.
[00:07:56] >> And we're back. And then uh there was a
[00:07:59] great interview with the CEO of Etsy,
[00:08:02] one of our holdings, Josh Silverman,
[00:08:05] talking about the implications of AI on
[00:08:09] the Etsy business, which makes unique
[00:08:12] products that can't be commoditized
[00:08:15] versus all of the other online retailers
[00:08:17] that may be at the effect of AI moving
[00:08:21] forward. So, let's listen in here.
[00:08:23] >> Josh Silverman. Josh, it's it's good to
[00:08:25] here to break it all down in a CNBC
[00:08:27] exclusive is MC CEO Josh Silverman.
[00:08:31] Josh, it's it's good to see you at the
[00:08:33] exchange. Sorry I couldn't be with you
[00:08:34] today. I'm in DC. But you guys
[00:08:36] characterize this as the new chapter,
[00:08:38] the next chapter in Etsy. And when I
[00:08:39] think of the sort of eras that I've
[00:08:41] covered in ETS's life, it's it's the
[00:08:44] it's the growth in the beginning. It's
[00:08:45] the COVID era, and now you're kind of in
[00:08:47] your new AI era. talk a little bit about
[00:08:51] about that and and why the move.
[00:08:54] >> Yeah. Well, first with the move, we're
[00:08:56] so excited to be along many of the most
[00:08:58] respected and innovative companies uh in
[00:09:00] the world on the New York Stock
[00:09:01] Exchange. And I think it is an
[00:09:03] incredibly exciting time for us as we
[00:09:05] enter our third decade. And so many of
[00:09:07] the trends uh particularly with AI and
[00:09:10] generative AI are unlocking incredible
[00:09:13] new potential for Etsy to achieve our
[00:09:15] mission even more powerfully than we've
[00:09:17] ever been able to do before. Etsy is
[00:09:20] about keeping commerce human. We connect
[00:09:21] over 5 million sellers with over 80
[00:09:24] million buyers. And it's the combination
[00:09:27] of technology with humans that's so
[00:09:29] powerful at Etsy. And you know the New
[00:09:31] York Stock Exchange with the market
[00:09:33] maker model is also the combination of
[00:09:35] technology with humans. So we think it's
[00:09:36] a nice symbolic moment for this exciting
[00:09:38] next chapter for Etsy.
[00:09:40] >> It is.
[00:09:40] >> Speaking of the stock, is it harder to
[00:09:42] be a public company? And you know, while
[00:09:44] your stock has done very well, it's
[00:09:45] obviously way off the highs that we saw
[00:09:47] during CO. Is it harder to be a public
[00:09:49] company and to invest in a new chapter
[00:09:51] of growth around AI really sort of
[00:09:54] double down in in that kind of
[00:09:56] transformational technology right now?
[00:09:59] >> You know, I love uh being a public
[00:10:01] company. I love accountability. Uh we
[00:10:03] have a really accountable culture at
[00:10:04] Etsy and you know our the investors that
[00:10:08] we care about are the ones who believe
[00:10:09] in our future and we think we've got an
[00:10:11] incredibly bright future ahead and so we
[00:10:14] we think investments we're making in
[00:10:16] technology right now can not only drive
[00:10:18] a lot of productivity. AI is going to do
[00:10:21] so much for every company to help with
[00:10:23] the bottom line to help them to become
[00:10:24] more productive. With Etsy, what I'm so
[00:10:26] excited about is it's also going to help
[00:10:29] drive the top line because it helps us
[00:10:30] fulfill our mission even more
[00:10:33] powerfully. It helps us to become so
[00:10:35] much more personalized than we could and
[00:10:37] to answer questions like which of these
[00:10:39] items is the most artisal and the best
[00:10:41] fit for you. Things frankly other other
[00:10:44] commerce companies are not worried about
[00:10:46] uh are uniquely benefited by AI and and
[00:10:50] so I think the future for Etsy is very
[00:10:51] bright. There's an item on the tape this
[00:10:53] morning about Walmart and Chad GPT. How
[00:10:56] do you see this sort of
[00:10:57] disintermediation working out where you
[00:10:59] can simply say, "Get me those brown
[00:11:01] shoes that I saw the other day on the
[00:11:02] street." Yeah, I think that Etsy is
[00:11:04] disproportionately positioned to to to
[00:11:07] win in a world of generative AI and and
[00:11:09] and agentive commerce. So many of my
[00:11:12] peers are coming from a defensive stance
[00:11:14] where they're worried about these chat
[00:11:17] bots because what the chat bots are
[00:11:18] going to do is they're going to scour
[00:11:19] the web and they're going to discover
[00:11:20] that the item for sale in this place is
[00:11:22] for sale in 50 other places. And now
[00:11:25] it's just going to help you find the
[00:11:26] very cheapest version that'll arrive the
[00:11:28] fastest. On Etsy, we've got over a 100
[00:11:30] million items that are genuinely unique
[00:11:33] and special made by the maker just for
[00:11:35] you. So we have something really unique
[00:11:37] to offer. And in that world, I think
[00:11:40] these chatbots are going to surface Etsy
[00:11:43] very often as a great alternative. And I
[00:11:46] think ultimately we we are a real winner
[00:11:48] in this.
[00:11:48] >> So that notion that it it's so good at
[00:11:50] curating and finding the lowest price,
[00:11:52] hence margin compression, you see
[00:11:55] yourself being protected somewhat from
[00:11:56] that.
[00:11:56] >> I think so because what a an agent is
[00:11:59] going to want to do is not present you
[00:12:00] usually with one answer. It's going to
[00:12:02] want to present you with a few choices.
[00:12:04] Here's the cheapest thing you can buy.
[00:12:06] Here's the thing that's going to arrive
[00:12:07] the fastest. and then maybe here's the
[00:12:08] thing that's the most special or unique.
[00:12:10] And in that world, I think very often
[00:12:13] Etsy gets presented as one of the most
[00:12:16] interesting options. And I also think
[00:12:19] it's going to be able to provide us so
[00:12:20] much more context. These agents are
[00:12:22] going to know you really well. And so
[00:12:24] where often people show up on Etsy and
[00:12:26] they give us maybe three keywords, a
[00:12:28] chatbot is going to be able to give us
[00:12:30] paragraphs of context about who you are
[00:12:32] and what you like, your tastes and your
[00:12:34] preferences. This just for you or is it
[00:12:35] a gift for someone else? for example,
[00:12:37] and we can do so much more with that in
[00:12:39] that world. That's why we are on offense
[00:12:41] here and we're partnering with many of
[00:12:43] the leading model builders in their very
[00:12:46] first launches. We have a seat at the
[00:12:48] table to help define what this future is
[00:12:50] going to look like.
[00:12:51] >> Josh, we've known each other for a
[00:12:53] while. I know you as a fairly thoughtful
[00:12:54] guy in terms of broadly speaking. What
[00:12:57] as you see the evolution of AI more
[00:12:59] broadly do you see the impact? You know,
[00:13:01] when I think about it, I sort of
[00:13:02] sometimes wonder, well, are people going
[00:13:04] to have jobs to spend money on Etsy? How
[00:13:06] do you view the longer term here
[00:13:08] positively?
[00:13:09] >> I think net net net it's positive uh for
[00:13:12] humanity. There are certainly risks we
[00:13:14] have to worry about but in my experience
[00:13:16] the technology evolves much faster than
[00:13:18] humans and business processes evolve. So
[00:13:20] what the technology is going to be
[00:13:21] capable of doing is going to be far in
[00:13:24] advance of what we are prepared to
[00:13:26] adopt. And so these changes are actually
[00:13:27] going to evolve over a longer period of
[00:13:29] time than I think some people might be
[00:13:31] thinking, but ultimately their power
[00:13:33] will be uh terrific. And so for Etsy,
[00:13:36] for example, we're about an individual
[00:13:39] maker of over 5 million sellers. Most of
[00:13:41] them are a business of one working from
[00:13:43] their home. And the these uh new AI
[00:13:47] technologies are going to allow those
[00:13:48] makers to connect with tens of millions
[00:13:50] of buyers even better and be able to
[00:13:53] create a human connection create be able
[00:13:55] to create a feeling of friendship and
[00:13:58] community in a world that can feel more
[00:14:01] anonymous. So I think that this
[00:14:02] technology is going to superpower Etsy
[00:14:04] to make
[00:14:05] >> a lot of businesses very easily. I guess
[00:14:06] >> a lot of businesses and in a time when
[00:14:08] there's so much macro uncertainty, one
[00:14:10] thing we've seen is Etsy is so
[00:14:12] resilient. We don't have complex supply
[00:14:14] chains like so many other people do. And
[00:14:16] so I think again this technology is
[00:14:18] going to help our sellers with their
[00:14:20] resiliency come meet the moment time and
[00:14:22] again when consumers really need us.
[00:14:24] >> That that's just where I was going to go
[00:14:26] Josh which was the macro uncertainty and
[00:14:28] the tariff question you know at front
[00:14:29] and center again today. If we see 100%
[00:14:32] tariffs on China as we continue to see
[00:14:34] higher tariff rates across the the globe
[00:14:36] how's it impacting you and and your
[00:14:38] products? You know, Etsy has been so
[00:14:40] resilient through pandemics and supply
[00:14:42] chain shocks and so many things. We have
[00:14:44] over 60 million items made by US sellers
[00:14:48] available for sale for US buyers. And
[00:14:51] then we've got tens of millions of other
[00:14:52] items available from other countries.
[00:14:54] The vast majority of our supply uh
[00:14:57] outside the US is in Europe. Actually,
[00:14:59] we have very very little supply coming
[00:15:01] from Asia. Um, and we've worked really
[00:15:04] hard with our sellers outside the US to
[00:15:06] help them understand how to comply with
[00:15:08] the tariffs and do it in a way that
[00:15:10] minimizes cost and makes, uh, sure that
[00:15:12] packages travel quickly. So, I think
[00:15:14] over time, uh, Etsy will be very
[00:15:17] resilient to this and we will, our value
[00:15:19] proposition will get stronger relative
[00:15:21] to our competitors.
[00:15:23] >> Josh, really good to talk to you about
[00:15:25] all the AI excitement and everything
[00:15:27] else going on. Josh Silverman, the CEO,
[00:15:30] >> and we're back. Then we got Charlie
[00:15:33] Munger quote of the week. Mimicking the
[00:15:35] herd invites regression to the mean. We
[00:15:39] like to buy high quality businesses the
[00:15:43] in the most dislocated unloved areas of
[00:15:46] the market when no one else wants them.
[00:15:48] Durable moed business that have years of
[00:15:52] cash generation and history. And our
[00:15:54] edge is distinguishing whether the moat
[00:15:58] is temporarily impaired or permanently
[00:16:01] impaired and then putting meaningful
[00:16:04] amounts of money to work uh when
[00:16:07] everyone else is selling. And um we
[00:16:11] learned from the best with Warren and
[00:16:13] Charlie Seth Clarman. The story stock
[00:16:16] market is a story of cycles and of the
[00:16:18] human behavior that is responsible for
[00:16:20] overreactions in both directions. Uh our
[00:16:23] first edge is determining temporary
[00:16:26] versus permanent. Our second edge is
[00:16:29] time arbitrage. Pat patience, low
[00:16:33] leverage, and low margin. It's funny,
[00:16:36] you know, we've been on TV for the last
[00:16:39] two weeks since October 1st talking
[00:16:41] about uh we've raised cash, we've come
[00:16:43] off margin, we're being cautious. Uh new
[00:16:46] clients know that only a portion of your
[00:16:49] uh capital has been put to work. And you
[00:16:52] know, as the market went up a couple of
[00:16:53] days, people were like, "Well, can we
[00:16:55] put money to work?" Blah, blah, blah.
[00:16:56] And yeah, we could do that. We can get
[00:16:58] the timing perfect. But, uh,
[00:17:02] number one, I'm going to show you that
[00:17:05] it's it's probably going to be
[00:17:08] relatively mild in terms of indices
[00:17:12] pullback. And we're already starting to
[00:17:13] see some of the volatility that we had
[00:17:15] anticipated when everyone else was like
[00:17:16] bye bye bye at the top. Um
[00:17:20] and two, even though you'll have mild
[00:17:23] pullback uh we think in in coming weeks
[00:17:27] in the indices, certain names will be
[00:17:30] down even if the indices are down mid-s
[00:17:32] single digits. Uh certain names can be
[00:17:34] down double digits and more and that's
[00:17:37] where we're going to pounce and that's
[00:17:38] where we're going to take advantage. uh
[00:17:39] and slowly starting to, you know, there
[00:17:41] are enough of portfolio positions we
[00:17:43] have that we can be adding at these
[00:17:45] levels because the margin of safety is
[00:17:46] baked uh in, but um we live and love
[00:17:50] times like this. Uh so um so we're going
[00:17:53] to talk a lot about that this week. By
[00:17:55] the way, go to hedge funips.com. We got
[00:17:58] a new popup. I know you guys love
[00:18:00] getting the popup every five minutes.
[00:18:01] You could just shut it off by clicking
[00:18:03] this X. But if you're not on the regular
[00:18:05] daily list, you should do that for the
[00:18:07] daily reads. We put a lot of work into
[00:18:08] that. You can have an insight into some
[00:18:10] of the things we're looking at on a
[00:18:11] daily basis which can be helpful to you
[00:18:14] uh related to our names, related to the
[00:18:15] markets, etc. And we'll figure out how
[00:18:17] to get this thing only popping up once,
[00:18:19] but for now just click the X.
[00:18:22] Uh then I want to thank all the people
[00:18:24] that have been buying the Hedge Fund
[00:18:27] Tips merch. And the reason I want to
[00:18:29] thank them is because for us to keep
[00:18:32] doing this for non-clients, we'll always
[00:18:34] do it for clients. uh uh we got to keep
[00:18:37] growing. And you know what? We're
[00:18:38] keeping we we're not only growing, we're
[00:18:41] growing like crazy. And the reason we're
[00:18:42] growing like crazy is because you are
[00:18:45] selflessly
[00:18:46] and generously paying it forward to
[00:18:49] people you love and care about that
[00:18:50] could benefit from information about
[00:18:52] markets uh and investing. And I can't
[00:18:56] tell you the number of new clients that
[00:18:58] came in this last quarter's raise that
[00:19:02] said, "I started listening to you
[00:19:04] because soand so referred to me. They've
[00:19:06] been listening for three years or so and
[00:19:08] so is a client of yours and they
[00:19:10] referred me to you." So for that, I'm
[00:19:12] very, very grateful and we want to get
[00:19:14] you the proper recognition. So, like
[00:19:16] Jim, who is wearing the hedge fund tips
[00:19:18] hat, by the way, and you saw me wearing
[00:19:20] the hedge fund tips hat at the cars and
[00:19:23] shoppers, uh, because people ask about
[00:19:25] that. What's that all about? Well, it's
[00:19:27] the number one podcast in the hedge fund
[00:19:28] category. We talk about great companies
[00:19:30] that we own and like and why. We take
[00:19:33] questions from the audience. So, if you
[00:19:34] love markets, if you love individual
[00:19:36] companies and investing, uh, come and
[00:19:38] listen to Turnaround Tom, uh, and you'll
[00:19:41] find some some great value. But we want
[00:19:43] to get a bunch more of you on the
[00:19:44] website because a lot of you are
[00:19:46] ordering this. But the key again is not
[00:19:49] about the few bucks we make on a hat.
[00:19:51] The key is that people ask you and we
[00:19:53] spread the word and it's much easier to
[00:19:56] wear the merch or the mug and people
[00:19:58] say, "What's that all about?" And get
[00:19:59] them to listen to an episode and maybe
[00:20:01] it's for them and maybe it's not. It's
[00:20:03] just like reading the intelligent
[00:20:04] investor, you know, or you don't. The
[00:20:06] other thing that's cool is if you go to
[00:20:09] hedge funfundtips.com and that popup
[00:20:11] comes up, um, we have a new popup that
[00:20:16] gets you on the daily list, but also
[00:20:18] we're going to send you a copy of the
[00:20:20] intelligent investor to download and
[00:20:22] also the audio version uh, which is the
[00:20:26] Bible in our view for investing and, uh,
[00:20:30] you'll be able to take advantage of
[00:20:32] that. Those of you who are already on
[00:20:33] the list got an email yesterday with the
[00:20:36] book and all of the new people that have
[00:20:38] been uh subscribing have been getting it
[00:20:41] as they subscribe. Let's talk about some
[00:20:45] market indicators and there are a lot of
[00:20:48] what we call divergences which is when
[00:20:51] the indices are very low and the
[00:20:56] indicators are improving. But in this
[00:20:59] case, the indices are very high and the
[00:21:02] indicators are deteriorating.
[00:21:06] Again, uh most of you know me or I've
[00:21:10] been accused uh on public TV of being an
[00:21:14] optimist, of which I um am guilty as
[00:21:18] charged. Uh I have been accused of being
[00:21:22] a permable which is not accurate but I'm
[00:21:25] bullish more than I'm bearish because
[00:21:27] the odds are with me 70% of the time
[00:21:29] that mark you know markets go up but
[00:21:33] what we really are is private equity in
[00:21:36] the public markets and the reason we
[00:21:38] prefer to do it in the public markets is
[00:21:40] the prices that we are able to pay from
[00:21:43] time to time for some of the greatest
[00:21:46] businesses in the world would never
[00:21:48] exist in the private markets because of
[00:21:51] the way public markets are set up
[00:21:53] structurally and how managers are
[00:21:55] incentivized. When a company falls out
[00:21:58] of favor, it's irrespective of price or
[00:22:01] underlying fundamentals. It's a crowd to
[00:22:03] the exit and we are there to take
[00:22:06] advantage until the tide turns and uh
[00:22:09] and consistently do that with low risk.
[00:22:11] So, we don't have to take gamles on
[00:22:15] what's going to be the next shiny object
[00:22:17] or hot trend or this or that and wake up
[00:22:20] one day that the company missed earnings
[00:22:22] by a penny and the stock is down 30%. We
[00:22:25] don't play in that world. We play in
[00:22:27] durable sustainable businesses where if
[00:22:30] we are unwilling to buy the entire
[00:22:33] company with 100% of our own net worth
[00:22:37] financed debt financed by JP Morgan then
[00:22:41] we won't even buy one share. Okay. And
[00:22:44] that's how the kind of work we do to
[00:22:46] underwrite each position in our universe
[00:22:49] and in our portfolios uh to take
[00:22:52] advantage of. And um we have IRRa
[00:22:55] hurdles. You know, you'll see a lot of
[00:22:57] ask me anything questions this week that
[00:22:59] you know, maybe they'll go up 25, 50%,
[00:23:01] 75%, but if they're not doubles or
[00:23:03] triples over the next few years, we're
[00:23:05] not going to allocate capital even
[00:23:07] though they are good ideas. They are we
[00:23:10] look for highest and best use. So, let's
[00:23:13] get to some of these indicators. We've
[00:23:15] got an awful lot of stuff to cover this
[00:23:19] week. So, you can see the 10day put call
[00:23:21] ratio
[00:23:22] uh is subdued. There's a lot of uh uh
[00:23:28] kind of froth in the in the market
[00:23:32] still. Uh this is interesting. You're
[00:23:35] seeing here the uh 1% EMA advanced
[00:23:38] decline ratio. It's diverging down, but
[00:23:41] the indices are holding up. Usually when
[00:23:44] it gets down towards these levels,
[00:23:45] you've had a correction. We've not had a
[00:23:47] real correction. Uh, and I think that's
[00:23:50] something to keep an eye on. Uh, similar
[00:23:53] to this, uh, NASDAQ declining issues.
[00:23:57] Again, this is showing a weakening of
[00:24:00] breath. You have the indices near
[00:24:03] all-time highs, which is usually
[00:24:06] meaning declining issues near all-time
[00:24:08] highs, but the index is still at
[00:24:09] all-time highs, which means a few names
[00:24:11] which could potentially get monkey
[00:24:12] hammered this earning season are holding
[00:24:15] up the tech index and uh most of them
[00:24:18] are deteriorating under the surface. So,
[00:24:20] these are signs when it gets elevated
[00:24:23] like this that you're probably due for a
[00:24:25] little bit of pullback consolidation.
[00:24:27] Same with NASDAQ Cohen uh high low
[00:24:31] um
[00:24:35] up down uh volume on balance volume. Uh
[00:24:38] let's see here.
[00:24:42] These are just some sectors that are
[00:24:43] kind of mid-range.
[00:24:47] Here is Dowo intermediate term breath
[00:24:50] momentum oscillator. The breath levels
[00:24:53] are at levels you usually see at market
[00:24:56] bottoms and this it really hasn't come
[00:24:59] off the top. So when you see these wide
[00:25:01] open mouths, there's usually a catchup
[00:25:03] similar to what you saw before April.
[00:25:06] We're not going to get anything like
[00:25:07] April. Don't worry about that. Uh but
[00:25:09] even here, this was going down before
[00:25:12] you got a 5% pullback. I think that's
[00:25:13] more in the range of what we're looking
[00:25:15] for. um uh here this started to
[00:25:18] deteriorate before you got a I think
[00:25:20] this is a good analog here in 2020 after
[00:25:23] the huge rip off the lows you got this
[00:25:26] kind of 2 3 months of volatility 5% 6%
[00:25:30] 7% pullbacks before resuming the uptrend
[00:25:33] and I think that will be the case uh
[00:25:35] which is why we're going to use the
[00:25:36] opportunity to not only deploy all the
[00:25:38] cash we have but go back to normalized
[00:25:40] margin levels of probably 10 to 15%
[00:25:44] uh once we really get some wash out here
[00:25:47] and all the Johnny come latelys that
[00:25:49] were selling in the hole in April and
[00:25:51] buying uh at the top in uh mid to late
[00:25:55] September uh get monkey hammered out and
[00:25:59] um and we can pick up their ashes. So
[00:26:03] similar here with S&P midcap
[00:26:05] intermediate term volume momentum
[00:26:07] oscillator. Again, this is down at
[00:26:08] levels. It precedes pullbacks. We
[00:26:11] haven't really gotten the real pullback
[00:26:13] yet. So, we're seeing a lot of these
[00:26:14] divergences here. Again, you can see
[00:26:17] this fishmouth divergence. This is going
[00:26:19] down, which is usually what you see at
[00:26:21] bottoms. This is the S&P Mlen summation
[00:26:24] indices holding up. Um,
[00:26:32] it's just consistent
[00:26:35] divergence across. So, I I expect more
[00:26:37] weakness in coming weeks is what I'm
[00:26:38] trying to say. And I'm intermediate term
[00:26:41] bullish. So, uh, you don't need to go
[00:26:44] take an Advil. Everything's going to be
[00:26:46] okay. This is where we flourish and this
[00:26:49] is where opportunity is. So, you'll have
[00:26:51] a short-term mark tomarket on the
[00:26:52] existing holdings. Uh, and then, uh, we
[00:26:55] will use all cash to buy a bunch of
[00:26:58] other holdings at lower prices and ride
[00:27:01] it back up.
[00:27:04] Bullish percent again diverging, rolling
[00:27:07] over while the indices holding up. And I
[00:27:10] think this is going to be techled the
[00:27:12] weakness in coming weeks. Uh you're
[00:27:15] seeing you saw the Amazon break its 200
[00:27:17] day moving average. Uh
[00:27:21] generally not consistent with
[00:27:23] bullishness. Mlen summation same story.
[00:27:26] Turning over indices not yet following.
[00:27:28] They will catch up.
[00:27:32] Sorry to be Debbie Downer guys. I'm just
[00:27:34] a realist and I like to make money. I
[00:27:36] don't play the hand that I want. I play
[00:27:38] the hand that I'm dealt and I play it as
[00:27:41] well as it can be played. And um we do
[00:27:44] that consistently. Skew again, it's at
[00:27:48] these levels. You're going to get some
[00:27:49] chop. Uh and this Elliot wave pattern is
[00:27:52] is still in a a downtrend. Not that I
[00:27:54] pay a lot of attention to that, but I do
[00:27:56] pay attention. Now, in the context of
[00:27:59] personal development first, productivity
[00:28:00] second, this is a excerpt from the last
[00:28:03] annual shareholder letter that Jeff
[00:28:06] Bezos wrote as CEO of Amazon. And we're
[00:28:09] going to do some of this type of
[00:28:10] learning stuff because, as you know, I
[00:28:12] read and listen to a lot of audio books
[00:28:14] and I don't always share the lessons,
[00:28:16] but I think it's going to um be helpful.
[00:28:20] He cites a passage from Richard Dawkins
[00:28:23] book, The Blind Watchmaker. It's about a
[00:28:25] basic fact of biologies. quote, "Staving
[00:28:28] off death is a thing that you have to
[00:28:30] work at, left to itself, and that is
[00:28:32] what it is when it dies. The body tends
[00:28:35] to revert to a state of equilibrium with
[00:28:37] its environment. If you measure some
[00:28:39] quantity such as temperature, the
[00:28:40] acidity, the water content, or
[00:28:42] electrical potential of a living body,
[00:28:44] you'll typically find that it is
[00:28:45] marketkedly different from the
[00:28:47] corresponding measure in the
[00:28:48] surroundings. Our bodies, for instance,
[00:28:50] are usually hotter than our
[00:28:51] surroundings. And in cold climates, they
[00:28:53] have to work hard to maintain the
[00:28:54] differential. When we die, the work
[00:28:57] stops. The temperature differential
[00:28:58] starts to disappear, and we end up the
[00:29:00] same temperature as our surroundings.
[00:29:02] Not all animals work so hard to avoid
[00:29:04] coming into equilibrium with their
[00:29:06] surrounding temperature. But all animals
[00:29:08] do some comparable work. For instance,
[00:29:10] in a dry country, animals and plants
[00:29:12] work to maintain the fluid content of
[00:29:14] their cells, work against the natural
[00:29:16] tendency for water to flow from them
[00:29:19] into the dry outside world. If they
[00:29:21] fail, they die. More generally, if
[00:29:24] living things didn't work actively to
[00:29:27] prevent it, they would eventually merge
[00:29:29] into their surroundings and cease to
[00:29:31] exist as autonomous beings. That is what
[00:29:34] happens when they die. End quote. So
[00:29:37] Jeff has this to say. While the passage
[00:29:39] is not intended as metaphor, it's
[00:29:42] nevertheless a fantastic one and very
[00:29:43] relevant to Amazon. Substitute Amazon
[00:29:46] with any business or endeavor or skill.
[00:29:49] Basically theme what you don't use you
[00:29:53] lose. Business is not static. Life is
[00:29:57] not static. You are either moving
[00:29:59] forward at every moment in time or you
[00:30:01] are moving backward at any moment in
[00:30:04] time. And like Jim Ran said, my first
[00:30:06] mentor, if you don't produce, you won't
[00:30:09] be happy. It's not about adding more
[00:30:12] zeros. It's about being more productive
[00:30:14] and adding more value and getting more
[00:30:16] fulfillment. So what Jeff Bezos says
[00:30:19] here is I would argue that it's relevant
[00:30:21] to all companies and all institutions
[00:30:23] and to each of our individual lives too.
[00:30:26] In what ways does the world pull at you
[00:30:28] in an attempt to make you normal aka
[00:30:31] make you fit in? How much work does it
[00:30:34] take to maintain your distinctiveness?
[00:30:37] Okay. How about when everyone's chasing
[00:30:39] the shiny objects and you're buying
[00:30:42] defensives because they can't give them
[00:30:43] away. All of a sudden the shiny objects
[00:30:45] start to back off. And what's up?
[00:30:47] Defensives going crazy. So to keep alive
[00:30:50] the thing.
[00:30:52] So how much work does it take to
[00:30:53] maintain your distinctiveness to keep
[00:30:55] alive the thing or things that make you
[00:30:57] special? I know a happily married couple
[00:30:59] who have a running joke in their
[00:31:00] relationship. Not infrequently, the
[00:31:02] husband looks at the wife with faux
[00:31:03] distress and says to her, "Can't you
[00:31:04] just be normal?" They both smile and
[00:31:06] laugh. And of course, the deep truth is
[00:31:07] that her distinctiveness is something he
[00:31:09] loves about her. But at the same time,
[00:31:11] it's also true that things would often
[00:31:13] be easier, take less energy if we were a
[00:31:15] little more more normal. This phenomenon
[00:31:17] h happens at all scale levels.
[00:31:19] Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is
[00:31:21] the historical norm. If we stop doing
[00:31:23] all the continuous hard work that is
[00:31:25] needed to maintain our distinctiveness
[00:31:27] in that regard, we would quickly come
[00:31:29] into equilibrium with tyranny. We all
[00:31:32] know about distinctiveness. Originality
[00:31:34] is valuable. We are all taught to quote
[00:31:37] be yourself. What I'm really asking you
[00:31:39] to do is embrace and be realistic about
[00:31:41] how much energy it takes to maintain
[00:31:42] that distinctiveness. The world wants
[00:31:44] you to be typical and in a thousand ways
[00:31:47] it pulls at you. Don't let it happen.
[00:31:50] You have to pay a price for your
[00:31:52] distinctiveness and it's worth it. The
[00:31:54] fairy tale version of be yourself is
[00:31:56] that all the pain stops as soon as you
[00:31:58] allow your distinctiveness to shine.
[00:32:01] That version is misleading. Being
[00:32:03] yourself is worth it, but don't expect
[00:32:06] it to be easy or free. You'll have to
[00:32:10] put the energy into it continuously.
[00:32:14] The world will always try to make Amazon
[00:32:17] more typical to bring us into
[00:32:18] equilibrium with our environment. It
[00:32:21] will take continuous effort, but we can
[00:32:24] and must be better than that. I mean,
[00:32:27] that right there is uh brilliant wisdom.
[00:32:30] And then some quotes from Charlie Mer.
[00:32:33] Uh we're, you know, probably, let's see,
[00:32:36] control plus plus.
[00:32:39] This is uh some of his investing
[00:32:43] checklist. Maybe we'll go into this in
[00:32:44] more detail on another day, but uh on
[00:32:47] risk, he says all investment evaluation
[00:32:49] should begin by measuring risk, especi
[00:32:52] especially reputational. Incorporate an
[00:32:55] appropriate margin of safety. Avoid
[00:32:57] dealing with people of questionable
[00:32:59] character. Insist upon proper
[00:33:01] compensation for risk assumed. That's
[00:33:03] why we look for doubles and triples.
[00:33:05] Plus, always be aware of inflation and
[00:33:08] interest rate exposures. Avoid big
[00:33:09] mistakes and shun permanent capital
[00:33:11] loss.
[00:33:15] Independence. Only in fairy tales are
[00:33:17] emperors told they are naked.
[00:33:20] Objectively and rationally require
[00:33:22] independence of thought. Remember that
[00:33:23] just because other people agree or
[00:33:25] disagree with you doesn't make you right
[00:33:27] or wrong. The only thing that matters is
[00:33:28] the correctness of your analysis and
[00:33:30] judgment. Mimicking the herd invites
[00:33:32] regression to the mean. No one's ever
[00:33:34] accused me of mimicking the herd. I can
[00:33:37] assure you of that. Uh merely average
[00:33:40] performance preparation. The only way to
[00:33:43] win is to work work and hope to have a
[00:33:47] few insights. Develop a lifelong
[00:33:49] self-learner thought through through
[00:33:51] voracious reading. Cultivate curiosity
[00:33:54] and strive to become a little bit wiser
[00:33:56] every day. More important than the will
[00:33:58] to win is the will to prepare. Develop
[00:34:02] fluency in mental models from the major
[00:34:04] academic disciplines. If you want to get
[00:34:06] smart, the questions you have to keep
[00:34:09] asking is why? Why? Why? Intellectual
[00:34:12] humility. Acknowledging what you don't
[00:34:14] know is the dawning of wisdom. As you
[00:34:16] note, we stay in a very narrow lane of
[00:34:19] our circle of competence and we keep our
[00:34:22] blinders on. Uh stay within a
[00:34:24] well-defined circle of competence.
[00:34:26] Identify and reconcile disisconfirming
[00:34:28] evidence. That's the number one thing I
[00:34:30] look for is tell me the reasons why not
[00:34:33] versus the reasons why. Resist the
[00:34:35] craving for false precision, false
[00:34:38] certainties, etc. And above all, never
[00:34:41] fool yourself and remember that you are
[00:34:42] the easiest person to fool.
[00:34:45] Understanding both the power of compound
[00:34:47] interest and the difficulty of getting
[00:34:49] it is the heart and soul of
[00:34:51] understanding a lot of things. Analytic
[00:34:53] rigor, the use of the scientific method
[00:34:55] and effective checklist to minimize
[00:34:57] errors and omissions. Determine value
[00:35:00] apart from price, progress apart from
[00:35:03] activity, and wealth apart from size. in
[00:35:07] this business. Why so many successful
[00:35:09] entrepreneurs give me their money to
[00:35:12] manage uh after they sell their business
[00:35:14] is not because I'm smarter than them.
[00:35:16] It's because they're smarter than me.
[00:35:18] They realize what it took for them to
[00:35:21] become the best in their fields and they
[00:35:24] would rather delegate to someone who is
[00:35:26] very good in their own field uh and
[00:35:29] benefit from it without all of the work.
[00:35:32] Furthermore, the super smart ones
[00:35:34] realize that they became wealthy as a
[00:35:36] result of massive action equals massive
[00:35:40] results. It's a genetic wiring that made
[00:35:43] them so successful in business. In
[00:35:45] investing, unfortunately, the exact
[00:35:48] opposite wiring is the wiring that
[00:35:51] creates the most success, which is
[00:35:53] massive inaction equals massive results.
[00:35:58] The more activity you take with trading,
[00:36:01] with investing, the lower your returns
[00:36:03] will be over time. Certainly after tax
[00:36:08] and generally absolutely
[00:36:11] um and uh it's better to remember the
[00:36:15] obvious than grasp the esoteric. Be a
[00:36:18] business analyst, not a market,
[00:36:20] macroeconomic or security analyst.
[00:36:23] Consider totality of risk and effect.
[00:36:26] Always look at potential second order
[00:36:28] and higher level effects. Think forwards
[00:36:30] and backwards. Invert. Always invert.
[00:36:34] So, you know, if someone's going to um,
[00:36:38] you know, become a a a scratch golfer,
[00:36:42] rather than say, well, what do I have to
[00:36:43] do be to become a scratch golfer? I
[00:36:45] think the the framework should be uh
[00:36:48] what actions would I take to guarantee
[00:36:50] that I never become a scratch golfer?
[00:36:51] You know, number one uh is practice very
[00:36:54] little. Number two, be very emotional on
[00:36:56] the golf course when you hit a bad shot.
[00:36:57] Number three, think you know everything.
[00:36:59] Number four, um uh never have someone
[00:37:04] look objectively at you that has more
[00:37:06] skill than you to find your blind spots.
[00:37:09] Think you know it all. Uh uh number
[00:37:11] five, um just focus on hitting driver
[00:37:14] and don't spend any time at the short
[00:37:16] range. So when you get through all this
[00:37:17] list of how to guarantee you never
[00:37:18] become a scratch golfer then you say
[00:37:21] well if I do want to become a scratch
[00:37:23] golfer I might want to do the opposite
[00:37:24] of a lot of those things and and
[00:37:26] inverting is critical in investing why
[00:37:29] not why should we buy this why shouldn't
[00:37:30] we buy this it's it's it's it's the
[00:37:32] process of uh excluding not the process
[00:37:36] of including when it comes to uh
[00:37:38] investing remember that the highest and
[00:37:40] best use is always measured by the next
[00:37:42] best use the opportunity cost good ideas
[00:37:45] are rare
[00:37:46] When the odds are greatly in your favor,
[00:37:49] bet and allocate heavily. Don't fall in
[00:37:51] love with an investment. Be situation
[00:37:53] dependent and opportunity driven.
[00:37:55] Patience. Resist the natural human bias
[00:37:57] to act. Compound interest is the eighth
[00:38:00] wonder of the world. Never interrupt it
[00:38:02] unnecessarily. Avoid unnecessary
[00:38:05] transactional taxes and frictional
[00:38:07] costs. Uh never take action for its own
[00:38:10] sake. Trading in and out, doing
[00:38:12] short-term options, all this stuff. Be
[00:38:14] alert for the arrival of luck and
[00:38:17] embrace it. Enjoy the process along with
[00:38:20] the proceeds because the process is
[00:38:22] where you live. The framework, ladies
[00:38:24] and gentlemen. Decisiveness. When proper
[00:38:26] circumstances present themselves, act
[00:38:28] with decisiveness and conviction like we
[00:38:30] did with Alibaba. Okay, we started
[00:38:33] buying it over a 100. It went down to
[00:38:36] 80. It went down to 60. Do you know what
[00:38:39] it was like being on the podcast the day
[00:38:41] it was 58 and 60 and buying it till our
[00:38:43] fingers bled to bring our basis down to
[00:38:46] $82 when everyone was saying China was
[00:38:48] uninvestable, everything's going to get
[00:38:50] delisted, all these well-meaning uh
[00:38:53] non-informed uh emotional
[00:38:56] uh uh talking heads that that were were
[00:38:58] scaring you out of out of your stock at
[00:39:00] the exact wrong time. We knew 80 billion
[00:39:03] of cash, 25 billion of free cash flow,
[00:39:06] buying in the float, growing the
[00:39:07] business, cheapest play on AI. We stuck
[00:39:10] to the underlying underwriting the
[00:39:12] business. Not a market analyst, not a
[00:39:15] securities analyst, a business analyst.
[00:39:17] What was the business worth?
[00:39:20] And when you backed out the cash, they
[00:39:22] were giving it giving you the business.
[00:39:23] They were literally giving it away. And
[00:39:25] they still are when you consider the sum
[00:39:26] of the parts. Uh change, live with
[00:39:29] change, and accept unreovable
[00:39:31] complexity. Recognize and adapt to the
[00:39:33] nature of the world around you. Don't
[00:39:34] expect to it to adapt to you.
[00:39:37] Continually challenge and willingly
[00:39:39] amend your bestloved ideas. Recognize
[00:39:42] reality even when you don't like it,
[00:39:44] especially when you don't like it. And
[00:39:45] finally, focus. Keep things simple and
[00:39:48] remember what you set out to do.
[00:39:50] Remember that reputation and integrity
[00:39:52] are your most valuable assets and can be
[00:39:55] lost in a heartbeat. Guard against the
[00:39:57] effects of hubris, arrogance, and
[00:39:59] boredom. Don't overlook the obvious by
[00:40:02] drowning in minutia, the small details.
[00:40:06] Be careful to exclude unneeded
[00:40:08] information or slop. A small leak can
[00:40:10] sink a great ship. And face your big
[00:40:12] troubles. Don't sweep them under the
[00:40:14] rug. So, that's uh the the key thing
[00:40:18] here. Preparation, discipline, patience,
[00:40:20] and decisiveness. So, I thought that
[00:40:21] would be a valuable add-on. Speaking of
[00:40:23] Charlie, Bergkshire Hathway Home
[00:40:25] Services expects a surge in unoccupied
[00:40:28] homes left behind by baby boomers. As
[00:40:31] baby boomers age, they are expected to
[00:40:33] leave behind homes that many prospective
[00:40:35] buyers won't be able to afford. This
[00:40:37] could shake the already tenuous housing
[00:40:39] market as demand among older and younger
[00:40:41] home buyers shifts towards smaller and
[00:40:44] affordable homes. And that's why I've
[00:40:45] been saying, ladies and gentlemen, I
[00:40:47] think that top end uh in certain pockets
[00:40:50] of the country, the houses that were 5
[00:40:52] million precoid that are now 15 and 20
[00:40:55] are going back to 7 and 8. It's a matter
[00:40:57] of whether it's 24, 36, or 48 months.
[00:41:01] So, keep your powder dry and get that
[00:41:03] beachfront property by uh make make your
[00:41:06] money over the next four years uh in the
[00:41:09] stock market and uh and and and buy your
[00:41:12] your dream home. Uh, but don't pay up.
[00:41:15] Don't don't top ticket. Buy it uh when
[00:41:18] everyone else is selling. We're not
[00:41:19] there yet by any stretch of the
[00:41:20] imagination. China new car sales off the
[00:41:23] charts. You can see here. Here is T-
[00:41:26] mall, which is a division of BABA. The
[00:41:29] best pre-sale in the whole year broke
[00:41:31] out. 35 individual brand turnover
[00:41:34] exceeded 100 million. 1802 brand
[00:41:36] turnover doubled. Number of brands
[00:41:38] exceeded 100 million. and the number of
[00:41:40] brands that doubled transactions with
[00:41:41] the number of active users exceeded the
[00:41:43] same cycle last year. That's from
[00:41:45] Brendan Ahern. Uh stages of record
[00:41:48] recovery rally from April 8th low. This
[00:41:52] is the average recovery uh after 15%
[00:41:55] corrections. This has been above
[00:41:57] average. So I I think we're also going
[00:41:58] to see a little bit of short-term
[00:42:00] consolidation just to get it back to
[00:42:01] mean.
[00:42:03] Uh data centers keep growing at
[00:42:04] breakneck plays. Play that through uh
[00:42:06] natural gas, ladies and gentlemen, with
[00:42:08] our comm stock. every person with a 401k
[00:42:10] account puts on average. These are the
[00:42:12] going to be the people that get hurt the
[00:42:13] most with the MAG 7 in the short term.
[00:42:16] One of the best six months rallies ever
[00:42:18] equals more good times. 12 months out,
[00:42:20] 9.2%.
[00:42:22] Uh that's since 1950. S&P performance
[00:42:25] after 35% plus 6-month rally. We think
[00:42:28] this is accurate. I think that is going
[00:42:29] to be the case looking 12 months out.
[00:42:31] But I think the the path to get there is
[00:42:34] going to be a little bit choppy.
[00:42:38] um fixed investment. Here's the dollar.
[00:42:40] Broke down. Now, it's probably going to
[00:42:42] retest that with a little strength
[00:42:44] before continuing the long-term
[00:42:46] downtrend. I mean, you guys got to love
[00:42:48] it when we were just saying, "Guys, this
[00:42:50] is a fake breakout. We continue to be
[00:42:53] bearish on the dollar." And sure enough,
[00:42:56] that's been the theme all year, which is
[00:42:57] going to help this earning season a
[00:42:59] little bit as a tailwind.
[00:43:01] uh seven out of six out of 11 sectors
[00:43:05] are expected to post positive earnings
[00:43:07] growth in Q3 Q uh earnings growth of 8%
[00:43:11] which is a decentsized bar. We'll see
[00:43:14] how that goes. Uh cash held by
[00:43:17] households again the household balance
[00:43:19] sheets are phenomenal.
[00:43:22] Um
[00:43:24] and the uh cost of debt service relative
[00:43:28] to income again is again very healthy.
[00:43:32] So we don't want to get too bearish but
[00:43:34] we do want to take a opportunity of any
[00:43:36] shortterm
[00:43:37] chop
[00:43:40] cash holdings
[00:43:42] biggest weekly inflow into healthc care.
[00:43:44] We were talking about this now it's
[00:43:46] starting to happen. By the way defensive
[00:43:48] started to get a bid in the last couple
[00:43:50] of days. Uh asset managers are getting a
[00:43:52] little bit nervous here. They were
[00:43:54] selling the bottom, buying the top. Now
[00:43:56] they're now they're getting hit again.
[00:43:59] Uh annualized one-mon volatility
[00:44:01] seasonal composite for the foury year
[00:44:04] election cycle. So this is the period of
[00:44:07] time in the 4-year presidential cycle
[00:44:09] that tends to see a huge spike in
[00:44:11] volatility. Last few days VIX above 20.
[00:44:14] I think we're going to see more of that
[00:44:16] in coming weeks. consumer staples,
[00:44:18] market cap versus earnings.
[00:44:21] Uh you could just see how beat down it
[00:44:23] is. The lowest level since 2000 when
[00:44:26] Buffett was buying all those staples and
[00:44:28] then outperformed everyone for the next
[00:44:29] four or five years when everyone was
[00:44:31] saying, "Has he lost his touch? He's not
[00:44:32] changing the shiny objects. Look at my
[00:44:35] idiot neighbor who just made 10x." Oh,
[00:44:36] and by the way, not only they get the
[00:44:38] 10x back to the back to the casino, they
[00:44:41] got a margin call and and got their
[00:44:44] account liquidated uh 12 months later.
[00:44:46] But uh what else do you want to talk
[00:44:47] about? Too bad if they can't take a
[00:44:50] joke. Uh consumer staples. Again, this
[00:44:54] just puts it in perspective going back
[00:44:56] to 2000. This is where we want to have
[00:44:58] exposure. Whether it's Dagio, whether
[00:45:00] it's Baxter, whether it's Estee Lauder,
[00:45:03] all the staples will do well in these
[00:45:06] type of environments and they will
[00:45:07] dramatically, you know, so even when you
[00:45:09] came out of that recession going all the
[00:45:11] way up to 2007,
[00:45:13] as everything was starting to hum from
[00:45:15] 2003 to 2007, they were still doing
[00:45:17] well.
[00:45:20] Okay,
[00:45:25] short interest picking up
[00:45:30] S&P streak. So again, this shows the
[00:45:32] current streak without a pullback, one
[00:45:34] of the longest and strongest evers,
[00:45:35] we're getting a pullback. So just hang
[00:45:38] in there. So when you look at, you know,
[00:45:40] much higher levels of cash than you've
[00:45:43] seen or lower levels of margin than
[00:45:44] you've seen in a long time from me, um,
[00:45:48] be grateful and patient. You'll you'll
[00:45:50] understand why in coming weeks. So, uh,
[00:45:55] all right. Dollar remains substantially
[00:45:57] overvalued.
[00:45:59] So, continues to support the bare thesis
[00:46:01] as we've been talking about.
[00:46:05] uh tech
[00:46:08] waiting highest level since 2000 before
[00:46:10] the last correction in tech. We're not
[00:46:13] calling for anything like that because
[00:46:15] earnings power is much greater than it
[00:46:16] was. But we are calling for some
[00:46:18] consolidation.
[00:46:20] Uh this shows the tailwind. This is the
[00:46:22] most important chart of the week, ladies
[00:46:24] and gentlemen. And by the way, if you're
[00:46:26] listening, we love you. If you want to
[00:46:28] get twice the value, watch it on YouTube
[00:46:30] and see all this data. I know it takes a
[00:46:33] little bit more time, but it's worth it.
[00:46:35] Um, or do whatever makes you happy.
[00:46:38] Okay? You know, so so funny. Someone
[00:46:40] once said to me, you know, I love your
[00:46:41] podcast, but they're just so long. You
[00:46:43] know, it's two hours. I said, well,
[00:46:45] first off, the podcast part is an hour.
[00:46:47] The AMA is another hour. But then just
[00:46:49] listen to 20 minutes worth. You just get
[00:46:51] 20% of the value. It's okay. You're not
[00:46:53] offending me. If you if you wanted, you
[00:46:55] know, I could give you a a you know, uh
[00:46:59] 12minute podcast, which would be, you
[00:47:01] know, 20% of the value, but uh you might
[00:47:04] miss some things that could make you a
[00:47:05] ton of money. Uh or as we like to say, a
[00:47:08] ton of money. So, all right. Uh S&P
[00:47:12] 500 hits an all-time high after 15% draw
[00:47:14] down in the same year. What happens to
[00:47:17] the secondary draw down? On average,
[00:47:21] that secondary draw down, which would be
[00:47:23] what I'm talking about now, averages
[00:47:26] 6.4%.
[00:47:30] So, you've had them between 3% to 9.6%,
[00:47:34] but secondary draw downs are always less
[00:47:36] than 10%. So, I think somewhere between
[00:47:39] 3 to 9% in coming weeks would be
[00:47:42] reasonable. I think closer to six or 7%
[00:47:46] because of the stocks that are going to
[00:47:47] get hit have such high waitings. Uh and
[00:47:50] we will be smiling so wide we could eat
[00:47:52] a banana sideways as we hoover up all
[00:47:54] the stuff that people who bought at the
[00:47:56] top are puking out. Uh let's see.
[00:48:06] Okay.
[00:48:07] uh investor sentiment from the Bank of
[00:48:08] America survey near moving towards highs
[00:48:12] not extreme again that's why I don't
[00:48:14] think we get anything more than a you
[00:48:16] know four to four to 9% implied
[00:48:19] correlation with S&P 500 is as low his
[00:48:22] historical levels
[00:48:24] stock pickers paradise
[00:48:34] CTA position got a little rich here.
[00:48:36] They're getting ready to get smoked.
[00:48:39] Uh high bar set for earnings revisions
[00:48:42] were up.
[00:48:44] Keep an eye on that. Recession
[00:48:45] expectations the lowest. So there's, you
[00:48:47] know, there's a lot of super happiness,
[00:48:50] justifiably so, but got to take a little
[00:48:53] air out of the pocket just to just to uh
[00:48:57] uh
[00:48:59] normalize things.
[00:49:04] put volume is starting to pick up. So,
[00:49:07] it's something to keep an I mean, I'd be
[00:49:08] surprised if we ended at a 3%
[00:49:10] correction, but it's not out of the
[00:49:12] question. There is a lot of money on the
[00:49:14] sidelines, but I I think we're going to
[00:49:15] see a little more pain as tech starts to
[00:49:17] report.
[00:49:19] Um,
[00:49:20] small cap equity position starting to
[00:49:22] improve. Still huge opportunity there on
[00:49:24] a company by company basis.
[00:49:36] Industrial Renaissance continues.
[00:49:40] This is interesting. I mean, this is
[00:49:42] shocking to me. This says, "A bad year
[00:49:44] for stock pickers. Only 22% of active
[00:49:46] funds beat the market. Poised for the
[00:49:47] worst annual showing in decades." This
[00:49:49] has been such an amazing year to make
[00:49:52] money. It's mind-boggling um to see
[00:49:55] this. And I think a lot of this is that
[00:49:58] the people that sold in the hole in
[00:50:00] April uh and didn't buy back and have
[00:50:02] been skeptical and now they bought the
[00:50:03] top in September. I think there going to
[00:50:05] be a lot of people that are going to be
[00:50:07] future Walmart greeters uh uh coming out
[00:50:10] of this year that sold the bottom in
[00:50:12] April, bought the top in September, and
[00:50:14] now are going to be puking out uh in
[00:50:17] October right before we take off into
[00:50:18] the year end. Small caps versus large
[00:50:20] caps starting to really move in earnest
[00:50:22] and outperform large caps. You guys have
[00:50:25] been waiting for it. It's happening
[00:50:27] since August as small has dramatically
[00:50:29] outperformed large. Russell 2000
[00:50:31] outperformed Russell 1000.
[00:50:54] This is interesting. Uh, from Matt
[00:50:57] Serminaro, utilities are the best sector
[00:51:00] in the S&P 500 year to date, up 23% but
[00:51:03] have only contributed half a percent to
[00:51:05] the S&P's 14.2% gain. That's because it
[00:51:09] only has a 2.4% waiting in the index.
[00:51:11] Wait till we see this with energy next.
[00:51:14] Um, investors surrounding tech heavy
[00:51:16] with cash, crypto, gold themes,
[00:51:19] total. Okay, look at this. Oh my
[00:51:23] goodness. Total equity flows, mutual
[00:51:27] funds, ETF, percentage of assets. They
[00:51:29] bought everything in the middle of
[00:51:31] September. So, these guys got to get
[00:51:33] smoked before we we move back higher
[00:51:35] into year-end rally. So, I think this is
[00:51:37] going to take a few weeks. You know, you
[00:51:39] got the overhang. This uh shutdown
[00:51:41] continues. People aren't paying it. I
[00:51:43] think there's a little bit of whistling
[00:51:44] past the graveyard here. Uh shutdown
[00:51:47] continues. The China deal is not inked.
[00:51:48] that will get done, but um China has a
[00:51:52] little bit more strength than I think
[00:51:54] the administration anticipated. Uh but
[00:51:58] ultimately not enough to not get a deal
[00:52:00] done. Um and then uh earnings and margin
[00:52:04] compression with the MAG 7, which is 35%
[00:52:07] of the S&P
[00:52:09] by the dip week for stocks inflows the
[00:52:12] largest. So there's a lot of chasing at
[00:52:14] the exact wrong times. A lot of one day
[00:52:16] options at the exact wrong times. We
[00:52:17] talked about the 40 million contracts a
[00:52:19] day, last 25 sessions. So,
[00:52:23] um,
[00:52:24] there we go.
[00:52:26] Albamaro, look at this bad boy. No one
[00:52:29] wanted it at 50. Everyone wants it at
[00:52:31] 95. This probably consolidates a little
[00:52:32] bit before starting to make its
[00:52:34] parabolic move up. Maybe something like
[00:52:36] this, like what we saw here in 2009 off
[00:52:38] the lows. Big pullback to this green
[00:52:41] line and then straight up.
[00:52:45] Uh, a lot of great data here, but not a
[00:52:48] ton of time. So, let's get keep going
[00:52:50] here.
[00:53:03] Sentiment is still wiped. So, that
[00:53:05] that's what puts that's what puts a
[00:53:08] floor on the amount that we can correct.
[00:53:11] Uh, and why I'm not calling for anything
[00:53:13] greater than nine than 9%
[00:53:16] uh, and maybe less than that. Maybe
[00:53:17] somewhere between four and six would
[00:53:19] make a lot of sense. Just enough to
[00:53:20] scare people out, but not enough to
[00:53:23] based on all the cash and how low the
[00:53:25] sentiment is at present.
[00:53:33] Retail options call overput direction. I
[00:53:37] mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:53:39] all I can tell you is it's not a good
[00:53:42] time to be a buyer of equities when
[00:53:44] retail is buying this many call options.
[00:53:47] So, um you can be damn sure that the
[00:53:51] folks, your friendly market makers that
[00:53:54] are selling the premium and the dealers
[00:53:56] and the big banks selling all this
[00:53:57] premium to uh
[00:54:02] overly zealous retail investors at the
[00:54:04] top are not going to allow them to get
[00:54:06] paid. I can guarantee you that uh
[00:54:09] longest retail weekly option buying
[00:54:11] streaks on record since 2020.
[00:54:13] Uh total options this is unbelievable.
[00:54:17] Retail options volume.
[00:54:19] Yeah. All this premium
[00:54:22] all of this premium is going to go to
[00:54:24] zero. All of it. I'm telling you that
[00:54:27] right now. Over the next four to eight
[00:54:29] weeks these none of these people will
[00:54:31] get get paid. All the people who sold
[00:54:34] this, the dealers, the big banks are
[00:54:36] going to make a fortune. That's why you
[00:54:37] saw record trading profits when
[00:54:39] volatility increases. You saw it in
[00:54:41] earnings this week.
[00:54:44] Okay, that's it on the data. Let's go
[00:54:45] through some headlines. Alibaba says
[00:54:47] it's AI spending in ecommerce is already
[00:54:49] breaking even. Uh Alibaba banks on AI to
[00:54:53] boost single day sales on Tao and T-
[00:54:56] Mall. China's Lee renews call to boost
[00:54:59] consumption side of the economy. Alibaba
[00:55:02] is the toll taker. 40 cents of every
[00:55:03] dollar on the e-commerce side, which is
[00:55:05] a huge part of their much bigger part of
[00:55:07] their uh retail than it is ours. Alibaba
[00:55:11] Cloud Inc.'s multi-year deal with NBA
[00:55:13] China in latest sports related
[00:55:15] collaboration. Alibaba is the top pick
[00:55:18] of analysts. I mean, you can't make this
[00:55:19] stuff up. 12 months ago, same
[00:55:22] publication, different author, 135
[00:55:24] consecutive negative articles on China
[00:55:26] and Alibaba. Now, it's the top pick of
[00:55:28] analysts. Why the stock could rise
[00:55:30] another 32%. Opinion follows trend.
[00:55:33] Trump and X still plan to meet this
[00:55:35] month. Bessant says uh worldwide EV
[00:55:38] delivery soared to a record 2.1 million
[00:55:40] units in September. 62% made in China.
[00:55:44] Go Cooper Standard. Jeep maker Stellanis
[00:55:47] plans 13 billion investment to boost US
[00:55:50] manufacturing. Go Cooper Standard.
[00:55:53] Boeing off delivers 55 planes in
[00:55:55] September on track for the most in a
[00:55:57] year since 2018. For the new people,
[00:56:00] these headlines represent some positions
[00:56:02] in our ownership universe. Intel has
[00:56:05] been a rocket this year for us. Uh
[00:56:08] signals return to AI race with new chip
[00:56:10] to launch next year. How you doing?
[00:56:12] Intel unveils Panther Lake architecture.
[00:56:14] And guess who will be their biggest
[00:56:15] salesman by the way? None other than
[00:56:18] Elfeede
[00:56:20] Trumpo will be selling semiconductors
[00:56:24] for Intel. So, uh, Intel unveils Panther
[00:56:28] Lake architecture first AI PC platform
[00:56:31] built on 18A.
[00:56:33] Disney Taylor Swift brings the streaming
[00:56:35] event of an error to Disney Plus
[00:56:38] December 12th. Just in time to get all
[00:56:41] those subscriptions for endofear
[00:56:44] earnings, baby. Love it. Amazon and Tik
[00:56:47] Tok are helping Estee Lauder reinvent
[00:56:50] itself. So where Chris Jenner is not
[00:56:52] putting on Max's beautiful face
[00:56:54] foundation, Tik Tok and Amazon are
[00:56:57] crushing it for Estee Lauder. That's why
[00:56:59] you're seeing their e-commerce high
[00:57:01] margin DTC sales accelerating rapid.
[00:57:06] Powell signals Fed is on track to keep
[00:57:08] cutting rates. This is another tailwind
[00:57:11] in the face of the headwinds that I've
[00:57:13] discussed, which is why I said there is
[00:57:16] a floor on the volatility you're going
[00:57:18] to see. You're going to feel like it
[00:57:19] could go all the way back down like
[00:57:21] April. It's not going to happen. Uh but
[00:57:24] it will get you to that breaking point
[00:57:26] and that and just know we will be in the
[00:57:28] market buying on your behalf at those
[00:57:30] points. Uh nation's biggest banks are
[00:57:32] saying economy is still strong. We
[00:57:35] agree. Bubble or not, the AI spending b
[00:57:39] is unprecedented in every way. Critical
[00:57:43] mineral firms boost Washington lobbying
[00:57:45] as US expands investments.
[00:57:49] Why biotech rally can last this time?
[00:57:51] How you doing? It's on its way. Back in
[00:57:54] style stock market and sentiment
[00:57:56] results. Uh so the Bank of America fund
[00:57:59] manager survey on Tuesday. We put out a
[00:58:01] summary of the monthly Bank of America
[00:58:02] global fund manager survey. this month
[00:58:04] surveyed 193 institutional managers with
[00:58:07] 468 billion in AUMUM. There were three
[00:58:10] five key points. One, opinion follows
[00:58:13] trend. Fund manager allocation to
[00:58:14] emerging market equities has jumped to a
[00:58:16] net 46% overweight from a from 27% last
[00:58:20] month, the highest since February of
[00:58:22] 2021. This was a trade you couldn't give
[00:58:24] away at the start of the year other than
[00:58:26] to our loyal hedge fund tips audience.
[00:58:28] Yet now that emerging markets is
[00:58:30] outperforming US 2:1, it's suddenly all
[00:58:33] anyone wants to talk about. And by the
[00:58:35] way, China outperforming by 321.
[00:58:38] Two sentiment among fund managers based
[00:58:41] on cash levels, equity allocation, and
[00:58:42] global growth expectations has climbed
[00:58:44] to an 8-month high, rising to 5.8 from
[00:58:47] 5.3. Yet these readings remain well
[00:58:49] below prior market peaks like late 2024,
[00:58:51] Trump 2.0, 2021 blue wave, 2018 tax
[00:58:55] cuts, or 204 bricks. Plenty of gas left
[00:58:58] in the tank. Agree. Intermediate to
[00:59:00] long-term. Disagree. Short-term. Three.
[00:59:04] Recession expectations among fund
[00:59:05] managers have fallen to their lowest
[00:59:07] level since February 2022 with a net 69%
[00:59:09] saying a global recession is unlikely
[00:59:12] compared to the liberation day peak when
[00:59:13] 42% expected one. Exactly why this
[00:59:15] remains one of the most hated V-shaped
[00:59:17] rallies. As we pointed out in recent
[00:59:19] weeks, Fed rate cuts in a
[00:59:20] non-recessionary environment have
[00:59:21] historically seen stocks up on average
[00:59:23] 17% one year out. Four. 33% of fund
[00:59:27] managers now view an AI equity bubble as
[00:59:30] the biggest tail risk for the second
[00:59:31] time on record. Up from just 11% last
[00:59:33] month. Managers seem to be waking up to
[00:59:35] the fact that MAG7 earnings growth has
[00:59:37] been cut by more than half to just 14%
[00:59:40] this quarter. While multiples have yet
[00:59:42] to come down at a commensurate rate. And
[00:59:44] five, watch as they do, not as they say.
[00:59:46] Despite growing fears of an AI equity
[00:59:48] bubble and a record 60% of managers
[00:59:50] viewing global stocks as overvalued,
[00:59:52] they continue to neglect defensive areas
[00:59:54] of the stock market. most notably
[00:59:56] consumer staples. Fund managers are now
[00:59:58] net 24% underweight staples, 1.5
[01:00:02] standard deviations below the long-term
[01:00:04] average, a 12point drop from 12%
[01:00:06] underweight last month and the lowest
[01:00:08] allocations to staple 2021. Uh we
[01:00:11] continue to view these boring corners of
[01:00:13] the market as ripe hunting grounds for
[01:00:14] opportunity.
[01:00:16] VFC Corp update with Q3 earning season
[01:00:18] kicking off and many of our holdings set
[01:00:20] to report next week. We thought it was a
[01:00:22] good time to revisit the an exciting
[01:00:23] update from one of our larger positions.
[01:00:25] Last month, VF Corp announced the sale
[01:00:27] of Dickies to Blueest Star Alliance in
[01:00:29] an allcash deal worth 600 million
[01:00:31] expected to close by end of year 2025.
[01:00:36] After VF's reporting structure changed
[01:00:38] last quarter to remove Dickies from
[01:00:39] disclosure, spun as an effort to quote
[01:00:42] simplify reporting and make performance
[01:00:43] easier to track, it became increasingly
[01:00:45] clear the brand was struggling, not a
[01:00:47] top priority, and likely headed for
[01:00:48] sale. Dickies had posted three
[01:00:50] consecutive years of double-digit
[01:00:51] revenue declines, falling to just 542
[01:00:53] million in fiscal year 2025 with no sign
[01:00:55] of an inflection as sales continued to
[01:00:57] drop last quarter. While VF Corf doesn't
[01:00:59] break out operating income by brand, we
[01:01:01] can do some quick back of the envelope
[01:01:02] math and get a rough idea of the work
[01:01:04] segment which includes Dickies and
[01:01:06] Timberland Pro generated 833 million in
[01:01:08] revenue and 53 million in operating
[01:01:09] income in fiscal year 2025 with Dickies
[01:01:12] accounting for roughly twothirds of the
[01:01:14] segment sales. Even assuming Dicki's
[01:01:16] contributed twothirds of the operating
[01:01:18] income, which is very generous given
[01:01:19] Timberland's relative strength, and
[01:01:21] applying the DNA consistent with
[01:01:23] historical averages, the deal implies a
[01:01:25] multiple north of 12 times Ibida and 1.1
[01:01:28] times sales of premium to the overall
[01:01:30] company.
[01:01:32] All things considered, offloading the
[01:01:34] struggling brand should have investors
[01:01:36] over the moon, especially at that price
[01:01:38] credit to management who originally had
[01:01:39] no plans to devest the brand for
[01:01:41] recognizing the opportunity and making
[01:01:43] it happen. This is part part of
[01:01:45] Bracken's cleanup. For those of you who
[01:01:47] knew, Bracken's only been in for, you
[01:01:48] know, over a year, but relatively new.
[01:01:51] He was not responsible for buying that
[01:01:54] bag of S. On top of that, the deal
[01:01:56] removes another headache by allowing VF
[01:01:59] to further delever, taking out a solid
[01:02:01] chunk of 4.1 billion of long-term debt
[01:02:04] on the balance sheet. Management plans
[01:02:05] to use all the full cash proceeds to
[01:02:07] address the upcoming 500 euro million in
[01:02:10] long-term notes due March 2026, avoiding
[01:02:13] the need to tap the AL line and incur
[01:02:15] additional interest expense. That move
[01:02:17] will reduce leverage by more than half a
[01:02:19] turn and put VF well on track to reach
[01:02:21] its 2.5 times target by fiscal year 2028
[01:02:24] with the next maturity not until March
[01:02:26] 2028. With the rest of the business
[01:02:29] continuing to accelerate and generate
[01:02:31] solid free cash flow, VF should be able
[01:02:33] to handle the future obligations
[01:02:34] organically. That begs the question,
[01:02:36] with a $2 billion authorization already
[01:02:38] in place, at what point will management
[01:02:40] start buying back stock hand over fist?
[01:02:42] Bracken, are you listening? Ladies and
[01:02:44] gentlemen, this is kind this kind of
[01:02:46] deal is exactly why we got involved with
[01:02:48] VF Corp in the first place. There are
[01:02:50] plenty of other beaten down apparel
[01:02:51] names out there that look cheap, whether
[01:02:53] it's Nike, Lulu, or even Under Armour.
[01:02:55] We have no doubt that over time those
[01:02:56] names will get bid and start to turn
[01:02:58] around. But something we always look for
[01:02:59] in investments. And a central part to
[01:03:00] our thesis on VF is the value of having
[01:03:02] multiple outs. For my poker players out
[01:03:05] there, you understand exactly what this
[01:03:07] means. VF's portfolio of 11 brands give
[01:03:10] Brack and Daryl plenty of options to
[01:03:11] buy, sell, or lean into this
[01:03:13] environment. It started with a $ 1.5
[01:03:15] billion Supreme sale last summer to
[01:03:17] delever the balance sheet, and now
[01:03:18] Dickies is the latest out to leverage.
[01:03:20] That has been VF's playbook since 1899.
[01:03:24] not 1999, $18.99, buying, building, and
[01:03:28] selling a portfolio of brands. And we
[01:03:30] don't see that changing anytime soon.
[01:03:33] Not to mention, we're betting on one of
[01:03:34] the best jockeyies out there to lead the
[01:03:35] turnaround, Bracken Daryl. During his
[01:03:38] eight years at Logitech, the stock went
[01:03:40] from $5 to $133, delivering a 27 bagger.
[01:03:44] A million dollar investment in Bracken
[01:03:45] would have turned into 27 million. For
[01:03:47] those who haven't already listened to
[01:03:49] our interview with him below, it's well
[01:03:51] worth your time. you will quickly
[01:03:52] quickly understand two things. Number
[01:03:54] one, why we have so much confidence in
[01:03:56] Bracken and number two, with the stock
[01:03:58] trading still trading at $14, why the
[01:04:01] only question we have been asking is how
[01:04:03] many shares can we possibly get our
[01:04:05] hands on. Just a few days after the
[01:04:06] Dickies announcement, Bracken and CFO
[01:04:09] Paul Vogel spoke at the Wells Fargo
[01:04:12] Consumer Conference giving more details
[01:04:13] on the Dickies deal and a highle update
[01:04:15] on each of the brands in the portfolio.
[01:04:17] Below are the five key takeaways in a
[01:04:19] highlighted transcript from the
[01:04:20] discussion.
[01:04:21] Number one, the aggressive cleanup
[01:04:24] actions at Vans, which drove 40% of the
[01:04:26] brand's decline last quarter, are
[01:04:28] expected to be fully completed by Q4
[01:04:30] after closing 20% of the DTC stores over
[01:04:32] the last two years. The store footprint
[01:04:34] is now largely where it needs to be,
[01:04:35] allowing the focus to shift towards
[01:04:37] delivering great products and marketing.
[01:04:38] Bracken expects Suno's influence to
[01:04:40] become increasingly evident with new
[01:04:42] products this holiday season and even
[01:04:44] more in the spring. Marketing efforts,
[01:04:45] especially SDA, artistic director
[01:04:48] partnership, are set to ramp up heading
[01:04:50] into the holidays with plenty of
[01:04:52] interesting initiatives planned. Three,
[01:04:54] Northace continues its push to become a
[01:04:56] true four-season brand, targeting two
[01:04:58] times growth in apparel, two times in
[01:05:00] bags and equipment, and three times in
[01:05:01] footwear. Bracken expects the summer
[01:05:03] spring collection to mark the real start
[01:05:06] of this transformation supported by
[01:05:07] marketing and pipeline of new products
[01:05:09] that will only grow from here. A key
[01:05:10] part of the strategy will be replacing
[01:05:12] the Northace success in EMA and APAC in
[01:05:15] replicating in the US with a stronger
[01:05:17] focus on premium products. Three,
[01:05:19] Timberland continues to show strength
[01:05:21] with Bracken describing it as a
[01:05:22] resurgence in the interest of the yellow
[01:05:24] boot. More importantly, this momentum is
[01:05:26] spilling over into other products with
[01:05:27] both the boat shoe and the Eurohiker
[01:05:29] showing positive sales trends.
[01:05:31] Management attributes much of the
[01:05:32] success to renewed interest in the
[01:05:34] premium end of the market driven by key
[01:05:35] collaborations like Louis Vuitton and
[01:05:37] Fel similar to dynamic emerging at Vans
[01:05:41] where Valentino set of products are
[01:05:43] selling out.
[01:05:45] Vans by Valentino you can't make this
[01:05:47] stuff up. Four, Altra, a brand
[01:05:50] management had hardly mentioned in prior
[01:05:52] calls and is now beginning to focus on,
[01:05:54] is tied for the number one trail running
[01:05:57] shoe and is one of the fastest growing
[01:05:59] road running shoes, posting 20% growth
[01:06:01] last quarter. The brand continues to
[01:06:04] show strength and has significant
[01:06:06] potential to scale with awareness still
[01:06:07] only at 8%. And five, management expects
[01:06:11] that cost reductions, strategic pricing
[01:06:13] actions, and plant relocations will
[01:06:15] fully offset tariff costs by next year
[01:06:17] compared to the 70 to 60 to 70 million
[01:06:20] impact projected for this fiscal year.
[01:06:22] VF has also has little to no exposure
[01:06:28] to the dimminimous exemption. Okay. Uh
[01:06:33] moving on,
[01:06:36] fear is starting to kick in. down to 36
[01:06:38] on the fear and greed. Congratulate, by
[01:06:40] the way, uh we're pleased to announce
[01:06:42] the successful close of our Q3 opening.
[01:06:44] That's for the smaller accounts at $1
[01:06:45] million. Congratulations to all the new
[01:06:48] clients who joined in the quarter. And
[01:06:49] to our existing clients who upsized
[01:06:51] their contributions to their accounts,
[01:06:53] larger accounts, 5 to 10 million plus,
[01:06:55] can access Bes bespoke service anytime.
[01:06:58] You do not have to wait for the January
[01:07:00] 1st opening like the million-dollar
[01:07:02] accounts. And existing clients can
[01:07:04] always add anytime they want to their
[01:07:06] account. Send us an email. Give us a
[01:07:08] heads up. The money's coming in and
[01:07:09] we'll get it deployed over time.
[01:07:12] ARC earnings top 30 weights in the fund
[01:07:16] or the ETF earnings power over the last
[01:07:19] 60 days went up for 2026 by 2%. Oil and
[01:07:23] gas services went down by 9%. I think
[01:07:28] we're getting to the trough here for oil
[01:07:31] and gas services estimates uh moving
[01:07:35] forward. And there's opportunities in
[01:07:37] the space like NOV, National Oil
[01:07:41] Wellvarco, which we love. Love the
[01:07:43] balance sheet, love the cash flow, love
[01:07:45] the opportunity, love the play on
[01:07:46] unlimited demand for energy. Not much
[01:07:49] economic data with the government still
[01:07:51] shut down. Um,
[01:07:55] and now we're on to the ask me anything
[01:07:58] questions.
[01:08:00] So, let's get started. First off, thanks
[01:08:02] for listening in. Those of you who don't
[01:08:04] like Ask Me Anything, we'll see you next
[01:08:05] week. Those who love Ask Me Anything.
[01:08:08] Our first question comes from
[01:08:11] Reed Wade. Tom, first time writing in an
[01:08:14] AMA question. Big fan of the pod. Thanks
[01:08:16] for sharing your wealth of knowledge.
[01:08:18] You're tr truly doing everyone a great
[01:08:19] service. I tell everyone in my circle
[01:08:20] about the pod. Thank you very much. That
[01:08:22] means a lot. Um, and by the way, for
[01:08:25] those of you buying the hats and the uh
[01:08:27] uh mugs and the golf shirts and all that
[01:08:30] stuff, please send in a picture. Uh,
[01:08:33] we're getting like 10x the amount of
[01:08:36] orders that we are pictures. Uh, we'll
[01:08:38] put you on the site so the community can
[01:08:40] see you and, uh, get you some
[01:08:42] recognition. So, send it to info@hedgeed
[01:08:44] funtips.com. Your picture wearing the
[01:08:46] hat or drinking the mug or the shirt,
[01:08:48] etc. Uh, I tell everyone in my circle
[01:08:51] about your pod. Did you take a look at
[01:08:53] Globent S A G L O B? I'd be happy to
[01:08:57] read. Thank you for sharing and
[01:09:00] supporting and listening in.
[01:09:03] We are very grateful.
[01:09:06] All right, this stock is down a lot.
[01:09:11] Let's take a look at what they do. I can
[01:09:14] tell you right now, it's a broken stock.
[01:09:16] It's going to take a couple years to
[01:09:17] form a base, but I'll let you know if
[01:09:20] we're in the neighborhood of where it
[01:09:21] makes sense to start slowly
[01:09:23] accumulating.
[01:09:30] So, what do they do?
[01:09:36] Oh,
[01:09:43] okay.
[01:09:47] times market cap 2 and a half billion
[01:09:52] enterprise value 2.9
[01:10:00] technology services
[01:10:02] compromise
[01:10:04] AI studio network AI adaption of media
[01:10:08] and entertainment healthcare finance
[01:10:12] yeah the issue here
[01:10:16] is that they may have no moat. Any of
[01:10:19] these technology software companies,
[01:10:21] they could be disintermediated by AI and
[01:10:24] uh it's a shoot first, ask questions
[01:10:26] later. It's probably an overshoot, but
[01:10:28] unless you have a real edge as to how
[01:10:30] their moat will never be impaired by AI.
[01:10:33] Uh, you know, look,
[01:10:38] I just want to buy generators, planes,
[01:10:42] van sneakers,
[01:10:44] uh,
[01:10:45] [Music]
[01:10:46] uh, Disney tickets, Disney cruises. I I
[01:10:50] mean, I like simple stuff that I don't
[01:10:52] have to worry about this kind of stuff.
[01:10:53] This thing could be zero, but probably
[01:10:55] won't be probably going to be an
[01:10:56] unbelievable turnaround opportunity, but
[01:10:58] like I have no edge. Unless you have an
[01:11:00] edge on the software moat, then just
[01:11:02] take a pass. It goes into the two hard
[01:11:04] box. Michael Costa Selines, we like it.
[01:11:08] It's got a lot of debt, so you got to do
[01:11:09] a maturity scale, but I think that one's
[01:11:12] going to be okay over time. Robert
[01:11:16] uh Wartanian
[01:11:18] Unicredited
[01:11:36] is Unicredit
[01:11:38] a stock you would recommend for a
[01:11:40] turnaround? Dude, it's up 12x in the
[01:11:42] last two years. You couldn't I wouldn't
[01:11:46] I mean, no, but I'd like to welcome you
[01:11:49] to the podcast. Um, you're probably new
[01:11:54] and you're going to learn a framework
[01:11:56] over the next 6 to 12 months that is
[01:11:58] going to
[01:12:00] help you
[01:12:02] avoid chasing what's already worked in
[01:12:05] the re rearview mirror and start buying
[01:12:08] those things that haven't begun to work
[01:12:12] um before they get popular, you know.
[01:12:15] So, you would be you'd be more
[01:12:16] interested in this down here at two
[01:12:19] bucks or three bucks than you would at
[01:12:21] 40. That's not to say it doesn't go
[01:12:23] higher, but I mean, let's just take a
[01:12:24] look here. There's no way
[01:12:27] we could buy this. Um,
[01:12:30] even if they were curing cancer, which I
[01:12:32] don't think they are.
[01:12:39] So, you know, revenues are back to 2012
[01:12:41] levels. Congratulations. Free cash flow
[01:12:43] is still negative. Yeah, hard hard pass.
[01:12:46] But you are going to have the best 12
[01:12:49] months of your life
[01:12:51] listening and learning this framework
[01:12:53] from an investing standpoint than you've
[01:12:55] probably had in the last 20 years,
[01:12:56] Robert. So hang in there. Welcome to
[01:13:00] Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes and um
[01:13:03] enjoy learning the framework. Be
[01:13:05] patient. And by the way, go to the site
[01:13:07] and get that uh book, Intelligent
[01:13:09] Investors, so you can start the early
[01:13:11] stages of the framework. JT investor.
[01:13:13] Hey Tom, what are your thoughts on Dine?
[01:13:15] They've got Applebee's IHOP and Fuzzy's
[01:13:18] Taco Shop.
[01:13:20] Dividend yield is 7%. I don't care about
[01:13:23] the dividend. That could go away
[01:13:24] tomorrow. Uh, thanks for your thoughts.
[01:13:26] Have a nice weekend.
[01:13:30] Uh, yeah, look, I I am looking in the
[01:13:32] restaurant space. I think as meat prices
[01:13:35] come down, a lot of these are going to
[01:13:36] fly. I think this is going to be one of
[01:13:38] them, and I think you are spot on here.
[01:13:44] Let's take a look.
[01:13:49] Yeah, I mean it's trading in line with
[01:13:51] its fundamentals have been choppy. The
[01:13:53] trading has been choppy. Let's just if
[01:13:55] it lives another day, it's going to
[01:13:56] figure it out. They got enough scale.
[01:13:59] So, let's take a look at the balance
[01:14:00] sheet.
[01:14:11] Yeah, I think long-term debts a billion.
[01:14:15] I mean, the the key thing here,
[01:14:18] what's the free cash flow?
[01:14:27] 90 million. Yeah, the key here is just
[01:14:30] to get the debt maturity ladder and uh
[01:14:33] make sure they don't have too much debt
[01:14:34] coming due too soon. But if if they if
[01:14:37] it's laded out and they refinanced a lot
[01:14:39] during COVID, uh I think this is a great
[01:14:41] play. So uh that's the qualification. Uh
[01:14:44] you got to listen to the calls, start to
[01:14:46] do your work. Uh I wouldn't buy it on
[01:14:48] that information, but I would definitely
[01:14:50] say uh you are on the right track. Let's
[01:14:53] just make sure management didn't screw
[01:14:55] everyone during co
[01:15:00] No, no. I like I like everything about
[01:15:02] this idea.
[01:15:04] JT investor, good job.
[01:15:08] Uh Marcel Bala,
[01:15:11] thank you for your weekly market updates
[01:15:14] opinion on Garish Shimer. They
[01:15:16] manufacture and sell plastic and glass
[01:15:17] vials and tubes for the medical
[01:15:19] industry.
[01:15:52] Yeah, their margins have gotten crushed.
[01:15:54] So, and their free cash flow is
[01:15:56] negative. I'm going to pass on this one.
[01:15:57] You You really got to listen in and um
[01:16:01] listen to the turnaround story and
[01:16:02] really believe it. But until I see signs
[01:16:04] of the free cash flow turning, I'm not
[01:16:06] interested on something like that. Uh
[01:16:12] BJP, thoughts on DXCM? All these guys
[01:16:15] with the fake names? They're money
[01:16:17] managers. I can guarantee you. Uh DXCM.
[01:16:21] But you know what? We're grateful to
[01:16:22] have you and pay it forward. You know,
[01:16:24] if you're getting helped by this, help
[01:16:26] other people that could benefit.
[01:16:29] Um,
[01:16:33] DXCM. This is uh,
[01:16:47] medical device company. Yeah, glucose.
[01:16:49] This is diabetes. So, these have been
[01:16:51] all left for dead because of GLP1s.
[01:16:54] Uh, I kind of like the idea. Let's just
[01:16:57] see.
[01:17:05] I just don't think there's like enough
[01:17:08] juice in it for me to get excited.
[01:17:11] Everything has to go right for me to get
[01:17:12] a double. And I don't like that. I I
[01:17:14] like I like being wrong and getting a
[01:17:16] double because the margin of safety is
[01:17:19] so great. But let's just take a quick
[01:17:21] look.
[01:17:22] Uh DXCM
[01:17:38] I I just don't I don't think your upside
[01:17:40] is big enough commensurate with the
[01:17:42] risk. Let me just see the balance sheet
[01:17:44] real quick.
[01:17:55] But I do think it'll work.
[01:18:05] Yeah, I think I think you're probably
[01:18:06] fine with that. Uh I it's just not
[01:18:08] highest and best use for us.
[01:18:19] Okay. Uh, Patrick Kelly, thanks for the
[01:18:21] great content.
[01:18:24] Uh, look forward to watching the podcast
[01:18:25] on Thursday night. Shared it with
[01:18:26] friends and family. Thank you very much.
[01:18:33] Uh, yeah, I could. Yeah, I could have
[01:18:36] Brendan back on. Uh, we'll see. Uh, I
[01:18:38] know you aren't crazy about the oil
[01:18:40] producers that
[01:18:42] and that you are happy with your energy
[01:18:44] exposure with uh, NOVV and CRK, but
[01:18:46] would you mind taking a look at NOG?
[01:18:48] They had some bad management back in the
[01:18:49] day, but I looked at their stock again.
[01:18:51] It seems interesting.
[01:18:53] All right, let's have a look. Look for
[01:18:57] Patrick Kelly,
[01:18:59] my Italian pa over there.
[01:19:02] All right. N O G.
[01:19:23] No, no. Look, it's up 20 10x off the
[01:19:27] bottom. It's still free cash flow
[01:19:29] negative. Revenues have been flat for
[01:19:31] two years.
[01:19:32] Uh, no, no, no, no. But thank you. I
[01:19:36] mean, it doesn't mean it won't go up 20%
[01:19:38] or 30%, but it's like, uh, no. But thank
[01:19:42] you for the look. And by the way,
[01:19:50] let me just show you something here,
[01:19:52] partner
[01:19:53] on N OG.
[01:20:05] Uh, management are still scumbags. So,
[01:20:08] management has not gotten better.
[01:20:10] They've doubled the share count in the
[01:20:11] last 5 years. Um,
[01:20:16] that's
[01:20:18] no.
[01:20:19] No bueno. Okay.
[01:20:23] Grayson H.
[01:20:27] NIS iOS. I think we looked at this a few
[01:20:30] times. Let's just take a look for
[01:20:33] Grayson.
[01:20:41] What do they do?
[01:20:47] Web presence and productivity cloud
[01:20:49] solutions.
[01:20:51] Adtech. Uh,
[01:20:53] uh, not for us. Unless you're damn
[01:20:56] certain about their moat. Like, I don't
[01:20:58] think you got enough margin of safety to
[01:20:59] get a double or triple. Uh, Jackson,
[01:21:08] thanks for letting me retire with
[01:21:09] confidence. Thanks for the position
[01:21:12] notifications. How about another quick
[01:21:13] peek at Tillray?
[01:21:20] Uh, they've got Sweetwater, Shock Top,
[01:21:23] Breen Ridge, Core Product, THC.
[01:21:27] Yeah, I mean, I I don't really get
[01:21:31] ideological about things. You know, we
[01:21:33] own Dagio, but this is not the stuff
[01:21:35] that I really want to uh be involved
[01:21:38] with.
[01:21:40] Um, but let's take a look.
[01:21:53] I mean, this is unbelievable. The
[01:21:54] stock's down from 300 to a buck.
[01:21:58] Um,
[01:22:03] let's take a look here. I'm going to try
[01:22:06] to be patient with this one, Jackson,
[01:22:08] because you know I love you. But, uh,
[01:22:09] this is a bag of Uh,
[01:22:14] not for me. I I don't like anything
[01:22:16] about it, but
[01:22:18] I do know you're a super smart guy and
[01:22:20] you've sent in a ton of great AMAs
[01:22:22] before and I know why you're looking at
[01:22:24] it because it's down so much and it's
[01:22:26] rebounded a bunch. Uh
[01:22:31] I I I just I wish I could tell you I
[01:22:33] love this one, buddy, but I don't. So,
[01:22:36] um,
[01:22:51] taking the share count from 200 million
[01:22:53] to a billion.
[01:22:59] There's a special place in hell for
[01:23:01] management like these like this opinion,
[01:23:04] not advice. God bless them. I wish them
[01:23:05] luck. We will have nothing to do with
[01:23:07] that. Okta,
[01:23:09] next week we're going to do a session
[01:23:11] called Tell Me How You Really Feel. All
[01:23:13] right, Octa.
[01:23:19] Okta.
[01:23:27] All right. What do these guys do?
[01:23:31] So, it was a COVID darling broken stock.
[01:23:36] kind of went through this process. Um
[01:23:41] problem with this I think
[01:23:46] auction service used to manage secure
[01:23:48] identities such as single scionications
[01:23:50] cloud premises adaptive multi
[01:23:52] authentication
[01:23:54] I mean look I the numbers look good on
[01:23:58] this I'm not going to lie uh you
[01:24:00] probably could get a double or triple on
[01:24:02] this you just better be damn sure that
[01:24:05] they're bestin-class and um
[01:24:09] security capabilities
[01:24:12] company like this gets one breach and
[01:24:14] like the stock is just smashed and the
[01:24:17] way that the enemies are accelerating
[01:24:19] and accelerating. Uh and you know this
[01:24:22] was a growth company that hasn't grown
[01:24:23] in a bunch. Uh let's see what they did
[01:24:28] here. I'm sure
[01:24:30] I don't sure the balance sheet's good.
[01:24:33] Total debt
[01:24:35] 940 million cash. Yeah, balance sheets's
[01:24:38] great.
[01:24:41] I don't know how you can have such a low
[01:24:42] return on invested capital on a effing
[01:24:44] software business, but okay. Um,
[01:24:49] got to work overtime for that.
[01:24:54] Yeah, management keeps giving themselves
[01:24:56] shares like pigs. Uh, yeah, I'm going to
[01:24:59] pass. I think it'll work for you,
[01:25:00] Johnny, but um not for me.
[01:25:07] Lachlan,
[01:25:08] thoughts on target. We like it. We've
[01:25:11] covered that one a few times.
[01:25:14] Uh GGT.
[01:25:17] Yeah, I like this. I like it.
[01:25:20] Good job, Lachlan. Welcome, Dom
[01:25:25] Monaco. Under Armour. Don't like it.
[01:25:28] covered it every week for the last 10
[01:25:30] weeks. No thank you and it'll probably
[01:25:33] work as a trade and you'll probably make
[01:25:34] some money, but I think it's it's it's
[01:25:36] done. Uh Mike, not done like out of
[01:25:40] business, but just look if if if Steph
[01:25:43] Curry and Tom Brady can't sell sneakers
[01:25:46] for you, you're you're you're effing
[01:25:47] toast. Like I mean, what do they need
[01:25:50] next? Taylor Swift selling t-shirts for
[01:25:52] them and they still can't get out of
[01:25:53] their way. It's not going to happen.
[01:25:55] Mike, see the difference between Vans
[01:25:59] and
[01:26:01] Under Armour is Vans is culturally
[01:26:03] embedded in our DNA. It's been around
[01:26:05] since the 60s. Uh it's the
[01:26:10] Lindy effect. The longer something's
[01:26:12] been in existence, the light longer
[01:26:14] likelihood it has of remaining in
[01:26:16] existence. Whereas Under Armour was a
[01:26:18] Johnny come lately. When that guy was at
[01:26:21] the top of his game, there probably
[01:26:22] wasn't a better CEO. So then he started
[01:26:24] buying vineyards and horses and
[01:26:26] and he's just he's he's checked out,
[01:26:28] man. I mean, he can't he was a one- hit
[01:26:31] wonder. He made a lot of money and
[01:26:32] that's it. It's not coming back. I mean,
[01:26:35] maybe he can pull a rabbit out of his
[01:26:36] hat and I'm I'll be happy to be wrong.
[01:26:38] I'd love to see people succeed, but I'm
[01:26:40] not going to bet on it. Crispy Cream
[01:26:42] Donuts. This is a stock that as great as
[01:26:45] their product is, it's not going to
[01:26:47] work. I mean, this thing should just be
[01:26:49] taken. This will bounce. I mean, just
[01:26:52] take it private. put it out of its
[01:26:53] misery. I don't understand why they keep
[01:26:55] playing games with that thing. Alex,
[01:26:59] uh, watch the show every week. What's
[01:27:00] your thoughts on Shutter Stock?
[01:27:04] This is one that I've never understood.
[01:27:08] And if I recall, well, there you go.
[01:27:11] It's down 90% now. It's starting to make
[01:27:13] a recovery. Let's see. SSTK. I don't
[01:27:16] know what the mode is for this business,
[01:27:18] but
[01:27:22] nah, not for me. It'll bounce. It's a
[01:27:25] technical bounce. It's fine, but I I
[01:27:27] don't want to be involved. TimD
[01:27:30] Humana, thoughts on the selloff. Um,
[01:27:33] this is interesting.
[01:27:36] Yeah, I like this. I I've looked at it.
[01:27:38] Uh,
[01:27:41] it's so funny.
[01:27:43] How is your Never mind. I will say the
[01:27:46] name you entered in the contact form is
[01:27:48] a lot different than the name in your
[01:27:49] email address, but I'll leave it at
[01:27:51] that. Human is fine. Uh Frankie McBride,
[01:27:56] what are you guys so scared of, man?
[01:27:57] Anyway, Rob Sarnitaro,
[01:28:04] congrats on your daughter's aquatic
[01:28:07] accomplishments. They apparently have
[01:28:08] incorporated your work ethic into their
[01:28:09] lives. Thank you very much. Uh they're
[01:28:12] doing it on their own. this is this is
[01:28:14] their deal. Um, and if it wasn't their
[01:28:17] deal, we wouldn't be out here. Uh,
[01:28:20] several months ago, you asked me
[01:28:21] anything in the interview
[01:28:23] about EFT.
[01:28:30] Uh, said not interested. Are you
[01:28:33] interested in now?
[01:28:41] Euronet services.
[01:29:09] 6 billion
[01:29:13] billion.
[01:29:21] I I think this is going to again
[01:29:26] continue to fall in the
[01:29:30] not enough margin of safety bucket. I
[01:29:32] think it'll probably work okay, but it's
[01:29:34] not going to be a double anytime soon.
[01:29:36] So, I can't lower my desired IRRa to
[01:29:41] have a good company in place of a great
[01:29:43] company. Root Insurance. This is from
[01:29:46] Hank Douglas. Uh, hi Tom. As always,
[01:29:49] appreciate you sharing your views. I do
[01:29:50] my best to put out to friends and family
[01:29:52] on the podcast uh as I've gotten tons of
[01:29:54] value. Thank you. Very kind. Um
[01:29:57] appreciate it. That's how this thing
[01:29:58] grows and that's why we keep doing it.
[01:30:00] Uh root. So this thing's already up 50x
[01:30:04] off the lows, consolidating a little
[01:30:06] bit. Uh
[01:30:11] you know, if you're around, you never
[01:30:14] know what's lurking in insurance
[01:30:15] companies, especially ones that are
[01:30:17] subscale. I turn free cash flow
[01:30:19] positive. The revenues are growing
[01:30:20] again. It I think a lot of that's
[01:30:22] priced. What do they do? Just a
[01:30:24] specialty PNC
[01:30:28] automobile and renters insurance.
[01:30:32] Columbus, Ohio.
[01:30:48] I think most of the juice has been
[01:30:49] squeezed. My friend, you're late to the
[01:30:52] party.
[01:30:58] And uh
[01:31:00] yeah, share count's up
[01:31:04] 9x
[01:31:06] in six years. What a bunch of scumbags.
[01:31:08] All right. Uh no thanks. All right.
[01:31:11] Next.
[01:31:13] Jacob M
[01:31:21] love the pod. The friend I show this to
[01:31:23] follows your stock picks. Anyway, I'm
[01:31:26] not interested. By the way, go to hedge
[01:31:28] funips.com. Click on terms. This is all
[01:31:31] opinion, not advice. Talk to your
[01:31:33] psychic and financial adviser before
[01:31:35] doing anything. Uh, I was looking at
[01:31:38] range resources. Appalachia play
[01:31:40] seemingly positive massive inventory.
[01:31:42] Wanted to hear your take. Our take is,
[01:31:44] we've covered this one many times. Um,
[01:31:47] we bought this in uh I think it was
[01:31:51] 2018.
[01:31:57] Yeah, we bought it in 2018 at about 11
[01:32:01] bucks. This is off. It shot up to 18
[01:32:05] immediately. We thought we were
[01:32:06] geniuses. Then COVID came. It dropped to
[01:32:08] a buck
[01:32:10] 60 and change. I don't know why this
[01:32:13] data changes, but it was a buck 60. Uh
[01:32:15] we brought our we bought every share we
[01:32:16] could buy during COVID. We brought our
[01:32:18] basis down to $410.
[01:32:20] Uh it's up to 35. It's going higher. So,
[01:32:24] uh no change in that, but um so we like
[01:32:27] it, but you know, again, most you know,
[01:32:29] you're you're coming to the party at
[01:32:31] 1:00 a.m. when all the you know,
[01:32:33] good-looking ladies have gone home. I
[01:32:34] mean, you know, can it double again from
[01:32:37] here? Yeah. Uh but, you know, it's up
[01:32:42] 7x.
[01:32:45] So, I'd be more focused on something
[01:32:47] like Commtock that's earlier in its
[01:32:51] ascent. Robert, why?
[01:33:10] Yeah. So, Robert's giving me a big pitch
[01:33:13] on Bed Bath and Beyond or Bath and Body
[01:33:15] Works.
[01:33:18] Same By
[01:33:29] although Bed Bath and Beyond is Lona's
[01:33:31] thing now, and he just basically brought
[01:33:33] the the licensing, which I like.
[01:33:34] Actually, I do like his this is I don't
[01:33:37] like the old one. Uh Bed Bath and Body
[01:33:40] Works. I don't like this business. It's
[01:33:42] It's just not
[01:33:45] You're better off with LVMH and get uh
[01:33:49] Sephora for free
[01:33:53] or Estee Lauder.
[01:33:56] Um
[01:34:02] I mean the revenues and free cash flow
[01:34:03] have been flat forever. So the stock's
[01:34:05] down a little bit off COVID highs. It
[01:34:07] probably does bounce from here. I just I
[01:34:10] think it's just it's not highest and
[01:34:11] best use, my man. I mean, maybe you'll
[01:34:14] get a double out of this.
[01:34:17] Um,
[01:34:20] let me just see something here.
[01:34:43] Yeah. So, they're bringing share count
[01:34:45] down. The revenues haven't grown.
[01:34:49] It's okay. I I don't I don't like that.
[01:34:52] I It's not It's not the highest and best
[01:34:55] use. It's probably okay. You probably
[01:34:57] can make a double, but it's it's uh it's
[01:35:01] it's not a great business.
[01:35:03] Uh I like the broader.
[01:35:10] All right. So uh Bill C is asking about
[01:35:14] longtime listener noticed medical device
[01:35:16] industry is lagged the broader
[01:35:17] healthcare and biotech recovery this
[01:35:18] year. Uh you know should I uh relevant
[01:35:22] ETI market cap weighted and XH
[01:35:28] oversold?
[01:35:29] I think this could be the next catchup
[01:35:31] trade in healthcare. looking to rotate
[01:35:33] some of my XBI winnings into these
[01:35:37] beaten up names. I think it's early to
[01:35:39] get fully out of XBI.
[01:35:42] Um,
[01:35:44] but I do think you're right. I wouldn't
[01:35:48] do it at the expense of uh XBI. I would
[01:35:51] do it
[01:35:54] in addition to it.
[01:36:00] Wait. I hi
[01:36:06] and I'd probably go equal weighted.
[01:36:12] But I wouldn't do either of those. I own
[01:36:14] back I don't companies. I'd buy
[01:36:17] companies with the highest upside.
[01:36:18] That's like a sleepy maybe you make 50%
[01:36:21] but uh we're not in for that. So we like
[01:36:23] Baxter. All right. Libby.
[01:36:27] No, that's not a question. That's a
[01:36:29] spam.
[01:36:31] Sam S.
[01:36:34] Bristol Myers.
[01:36:36] Um,
[01:36:43] I like Fizer better.
[01:36:47] I like Fizer better. Let's just put it
[01:36:48] that way. This one's probably fine, too.
[01:36:50] I like a lot of these. I've been looking
[01:36:52] at a lot of these.
[01:36:55] It's okay. Side of the pipeline. I think
[01:36:57] it's going to be harder to get a double
[01:36:59] in this than in Fizer. Check out Fizer's
[01:37:01] pipeline. Chief scientific officer. A
[01:37:04] lot of interesting things. All right,
[01:37:06] let be Eric
[01:37:09] Carmax. We covered that. Don't like it.
[01:37:14] Don't like that business.
[01:37:18] I mean,
[01:37:21] all right, I'll look
[01:37:24] now. Now you know why. But that's you
[01:37:26] know at at some price a lot of things
[01:37:29] become attractive.
[01:37:37] I still don't like it. No pass. Thank
[01:37:39] you. I get it. It's down. Maybe get a
[01:37:42] trader bounce. I I don't like the
[01:37:44] business long term.
[01:37:46] QBT as a short.
[01:37:58] This is one of those meme stocks.
[01:38:00] Quantum computing. Now, I would I
[01:38:01] wouldn't
[01:38:04] these have nothing to do with
[01:38:05] fundamental. You're right on
[01:38:06] fundamentals. I don't don't get naked
[01:38:08] short on on stuff. There's a way to No,
[01:38:12] just find good businesses, buy them,
[01:38:13] double and triple your money, rinse and
[01:38:15] repeat. You don't have to play this
[01:38:16] these silly reindeer games. Okay. Um,
[01:38:21] love the banter.
[01:38:23] Uh, this is from Tino Langford.
[01:38:26] Highlight of my week. Thank you. Love
[01:38:28] the banter, direct honesty, and
[01:38:30] informative content. What do you think
[01:38:31] of Tate
[01:38:40] H.
[01:38:42] Tate and Lyall?
[01:38:53] I think we covered this last week.
[01:38:56] Let's just take a look at the balance
[01:38:58] sheet here.
[01:39:13] 1.4 4 billion. So they've added a lot of
[01:39:14] debt. You got to see when this matures.
[01:39:16] What's the cash flow like?
[01:39:32] Okay. It's got some uh snapshots.
[01:39:39] Oh, ingredients for food beverages. I
[01:39:41] prefer international fragrances and
[01:39:44] flavors.
[01:39:46] Um,
[01:39:51] figure out why this is broken, but I
[01:39:53] think it's kind of interesting. I'd
[01:39:54] probably rather play IFFF than this. And
[01:39:57] uh,
[01:39:59] you're the goat. Thank you for that kind
[01:40:01] word. Uh, Buffett is the goat. Uh, and
[01:40:04] never will be another Buffett. So, just
[01:40:06] leave it there. Uh,
[01:40:10] you mentioned wanting a restaurant play
[01:40:12] and previously turned down Portillos.
[01:40:14] They just hit a 52- week low. Search of
[01:40:17] a new CEO. Any chance you get a look?
[01:40:19] PTL.
[01:40:32] Some of these smaller scale are really
[01:40:34] struggling. Um,
[01:40:37] I think they'll turn. Uh,
[01:40:41] I just don't like negative cash flow
[01:40:44] when they're smaller,
[01:40:47] unproven,
[01:40:48] meaning they haven't been public that
[01:40:50] long,
[01:40:52] small amount of cash, lot of debt. I
[01:40:55] think it's I think there's a little risk
[01:40:56] there, David. I mean, I'm not saying it
[01:40:58] won't work. If it works, it's going to
[01:40:59] be a runner, but hasn't hasn't been
[01:41:02] public enough. Are you buying more BABA
[01:41:04] at this level?
[01:41:06] Uh, I don't buy up. I mean, this would
[01:41:08] have to come down a lot for me to put
[01:41:10] new money. Um,
[01:41:14] we buy when things are down. This thing
[01:41:15] has had a parabolic run just because it
[01:41:17] pulls back 20 points. Uh, we don't have
[01:41:20] to. We We already have so much from 82
[01:41:23] blended basis. Why, you know, I mean,
[01:41:26] maybe I'd put some new money to work at
[01:41:29] 150, but like there are higher and
[01:41:32] better uses. There are doubles and
[01:41:33] triples. I mean, the time to put money
[01:41:34] to work was at 60 when Rema Kapadia at
[01:41:38] Baronss was writing 135 negative
[01:41:40] articles about China consecutively every
[01:41:42] single week. Um, so you know, now it's
[01:41:45] up three almost 3x from those levels
[01:41:48] even with the correction. Uh, it's going
[01:41:51] to go a lot higher, but that's not where
[01:41:53] we put new money in. you know, we put
[01:41:55] new money in those things we believe are
[01:41:56] just leaving the station, not the ones
[01:41:58] that are already uh moved a lot that are
[01:42:01] still going to move, but the rate of
[01:42:04] return is going to change from this
[01:42:06] point forward from from what it did
[01:42:10] um you know in the previous year. So, we
[01:42:12] want to get them the maximum rate of
[01:42:14] return forward. Uh Max Hughes, could you
[01:42:18] take a look at Noble Court, please? any.
[01:42:20] But to answer your question,
[01:42:23] um, you know, everyone, if you've been
[01:42:25] following along, we sold the options at
[01:42:27] 6x on a on average. We could have gotten
[01:42:30] 7x, but we didn't want to be pigs, and
[01:42:31] we were right about that. Um,
[01:42:35] as for the shares, we're long-term
[01:42:36] holders, so there's nothing to nothing
[01:42:38] to talk about there. Um, what are we
[01:42:41] talking about here? We're talking about
[01:42:43] any Noble
[01:42:58] Uh, this is just a solveny thing.
[01:43:14] Probably okay. Not highest and best use.
[01:43:16] It's a lower quality business. It been
[01:43:18] bankrupt once before. I'm pretty sure
[01:43:20] I'd pass
[01:43:39] Elron
[01:43:40] Carney been following you since the very
[01:43:43] beginning. Wow. Thank you, Elron. That's
[01:43:45] pretty awesome. Six years, 300 plus
[01:43:47] episodes.
[01:43:49] Number one in the hedge fund category.
[01:43:52] Okay.
[01:43:53] Uh
[01:43:55] Pagaya.
[01:43:57] So, this thing's already 6x off the
[01:43:59] bottom. It's pulled back a little bit.
[01:44:01] PGY
[01:44:09] free cash flow is recovering.
[01:44:20] AI powered technology financial. I I
[01:44:22] don't know what their mode is. I'm going
[01:44:24] to say no just because it's had this
[01:44:26] huge move already off the bottom. I know
[01:44:27] it's pulled back a little bit, but it's
[01:44:29] up 6x now. It's pulled back a hair. I I
[01:44:32] don't I don't love it because I can't
[01:44:35] understand what their mode is. It's a
[01:44:36] software company and all that software
[01:44:38] stuff can be disintermediated by AI.
[01:44:41] Um, if you're dying to buy a software
[01:44:43] company and want to gamble whether they
[01:44:45] get disintermediated or not, buy Adobe.
[01:44:48] Thanks for looking the other day on UPS.
[01:44:51] They total ju just lost my package.
[01:44:55] Uh, R YN,
[01:44:58] it's a wholesale insurance broker for
[01:45:01] ENS excess and surplus market.
[01:45:12] some insider buying. All right, let's
[01:45:15] take a look.
[01:45:37] Wait. R. Sorry.
[01:46:06] I don't I mean I don't think it's pulled
[01:46:09] back enough, Jason. It looks okay. I
[01:46:13] think you probably make some money with
[01:46:14] it. It's a little broken. I I It's not
[01:46:17] exciting for me yet.
[01:46:22] 35 or 40. I'll take another look. It may
[01:46:24] never get there. I see UI. I think we
[01:46:26] covered this one, Lewis, in recent
[01:46:28] weeks, but let's just take a look
[01:46:30] because it's healthcare.
[01:46:54] Yeah, I think this is going to take a
[01:46:55] little longer than you think, but um
[01:47:00] probably okay.
[01:47:05] 300 million receivables 159
[01:47:16] 1.3 billion
[01:47:18] What's the cash flow situation?
[01:47:23] 60 million. Ah, it's a little levered
[01:47:25] for my style. This needs to come down a
[01:47:27] lot more before I get excited and I
[01:47:29] don't know that it will. I think you're
[01:47:30] probably right pretty much there, Lewis.
[01:47:33] I mean, certainly
[01:47:35] below 100, I think you can start
[01:47:37] aggressively
[01:47:39] doing your research, but um
[01:47:44] I think you're right and I just think
[01:47:46] it's going to take a lot longer. So you
[01:47:47] could have dead money for three years.
[01:47:48] That's that's what I'd be worried about
[01:47:50] is the opportunity cost of capital.
[01:47:52] Lithium America's This is This is a meme
[01:47:55] stock. We don't even cover this kind of
[01:47:57] stuff, David. So I'm going to just pass.
[01:48:01] Play Albamaro. That's the one. I mean, I
[01:48:03] know it's gone up a lot since we talked
[01:48:05] about it on this podcast, but it's got a
[01:48:07] long way to go.
[01:48:09] It's just getting started. This one,
[01:48:11] it's going to take a few years. This is
[01:48:12] going to be work its way up to new highs
[01:48:14] over time.
[01:48:16] Aisha
[01:48:32] Aisha is asking uh hey Tom thank you for
[01:48:35] your knowledge and sharing it. It's very
[01:48:37] clear those that listen for a longer
[01:48:39] period have accumulated a lot of
[01:48:40] knowledge to pull from to assess
[01:48:42] companies and industries very quickly.
[01:48:44] Apart from time and study of these
[01:48:46] companies which I'm certain is the most
[01:48:47] important ingredient. What resources
[01:48:48] have helped you hone your thinking the
[01:48:49] most? Uh I covered this. Go to hedge
[01:48:52] fund tips
[01:48:54] channel on YouTube and search University
[01:48:58] of Bristol. I spent an hour telling
[01:49:00] people what to read and learn to get
[01:49:02] their foundation. And I think if you do
[01:49:04] those steps, you're going to be very
[01:49:06] well ahead of the pack at no more than
[01:49:08] 99% of active managers.
[01:49:11] Uh, Wasim, love the podcast. Wasim
[01:49:15] Hussein, could you look at the company
[01:49:17] Sky West? Looks great on paper.
[01:49:20] Okay. S
[01:49:22] K Y W.
[01:49:26] Can't understand why it's falling
[01:49:28] because it's exhausted. It's gone
[01:49:29] straight up for two years. is a 10bagger
[01:49:34] and it's probably going to consolidate a
[01:49:35] lot because that's just what they do. S
[01:49:40] K YW.
[01:49:47] Okay.
[01:49:49] So, what do they do?
[01:49:54] Regional airline. Okay. Uh take your
[01:49:58] money and run. Okay. Airlines are
[01:50:00] cyclical business. If you bought in the
[01:50:02] hole at 15,
[01:50:05] take your chips and leave the casino. Do
[01:50:08] not wait for another free drink. You
[01:50:10] will get roasted. It will go craps and
[01:50:13] you will be out of luck. So, count
[01:50:16] your money. Go see Cirus Olay. Don't
[01:50:20] ever go back to the casino. Have the
[01:50:22] best steak you can. Take your money.
[01:50:25] Airlines are garbage businesses. You buy
[01:50:28] them in the hole when they look like
[01:50:29] they're going bankrupt. If you're
[01:50:30] certain they're not going bankrupt, you
[01:50:32] make your multibagger and you get the
[01:50:34] hell out and you never go back.
[01:50:38] So, well done if you wrote it. If you're
[01:50:40] buying up here, get the hell out
[01:50:42] yesterday. Romeo,
[01:50:50] thanks for everything you do. Started
[01:50:51] listening to the podcast this year after
[01:50:52] it was recommended to me by a friend and
[01:50:54] now I look forward to it every week.
[01:50:55] Well, welcome Romeo. Thank you. Uh, what
[01:50:57] are your thoughts on Whirlpool?
[01:51:00] Good play on new housing builds. Um,
[01:51:02] yeah, this one we've gotten a hundred
[01:51:04] times in the last year and we keep
[01:51:08] looking at it and we keep passing and
[01:51:09] that's been right so far. At some point
[01:51:11] it's going to be wrong. I just don't
[01:51:13] know that it's yet
[01:51:15] because revenues have shown no signs of
[01:51:19] recovering. I mean, they're down from 21
[01:51:22] billion to 13. So, the business has been
[01:51:24] cut in half. And guess what? So has the
[01:51:27] stock. I don't see any recovery yet.
[01:51:30] When I do, I will get super interested.
[01:51:32] I'm just not seeing it yet. So keep
[01:51:34] listening to the conference calls. Keep
[01:51:36] understanding the turnaround. Go back to
[01:51:38] the previous eight quarters. Find out
[01:51:40] what they said, what actually happened
[01:51:42] relative to what they said. And there
[01:51:44] will come a time. It just doesn't feel
[01:51:46] like it's imminent right now.
[01:51:51] Sahar been listening for four years.
[01:51:55] You've improved me tremendously as an
[01:51:57] investor and I can't thank you enough.
[01:51:58] Well, you're welcome and thank you for
[01:52:00] listening. Shahar, I appreciate the
[01:52:02] support. Wondering your thoughts on
[01:52:04] KSPI.
[01:52:06] I know you don't take company and
[01:52:07] country risk, but I think in this case
[01:52:09] it's just country.
[01:52:12] KSPI,
[01:52:30] what are you putting me in here, Shahar?
[01:52:34] Why are you putting me in here, man?
[01:52:38] Kazakhstan.
[01:52:40] Oh my gosh,
[01:52:47] Kazakhstan.
[01:52:52] All right, let's see what's happening
[01:52:54] with Borat and his joint stock company,
[01:52:59] Very nice, aka Cosby KZ
[01:53:04] merchants in Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
[01:53:07] three segments, payments, marketplace,
[01:53:09] and fintech platform that facilitates
[01:53:11] transactions among merchants and
[01:53:12] consumers. I mean, could it get any
[01:53:14] worse? Talk about All right. Uh,
[01:53:20] who who the hell underwrote this
[01:53:22] business? It must have been like Roth
[01:53:24] Capital or something. All right. Not not
[01:53:26] throwing arrows here. All right. Kspi.
[01:53:30] Kspi.
[01:53:35] Wow.
[01:54:06] Yeah, I mean look this thing. It is
[01:54:07] growing like a weed.
[01:54:15] Very nice. Let's see on cash flow.
[01:54:25] Very nice. Let's see on uh balance
[01:54:28] sheet.
[01:54:38] I think you're right, man. I I think
[01:54:41] Shahar, I think we are predominantly
[01:54:44] taking country risk here.
[01:54:55] I can't recommend it, but I I will be
[01:54:57] thinking about it. Uh, maybe I could do
[01:54:59] a little more work on it, but um I think
[01:55:02] it's a decent find. I I think what's
[01:55:04] really cool is if they got some
[01:55:06] resolution with Ukraine, you get a free
[01:55:08] Ukraine pop.
[01:55:10] Uh,
[01:55:14] I can't take that company risk, but it's
[01:55:17] interesting. So, kudos to you for
[01:55:19] looking under a lot of rocks. Um, okay.
[01:55:28] Grayson, what does the bare case for
[01:55:30] Baba look like? Dude, we covered this a
[01:55:32] hundred times when everyone was trying
[01:55:34] to sell it at 60. At 160 or whatever,
[01:55:38] that horse has left the barn. Kayla
[01:55:40] Smith, thoughts on Fiserve.
[01:55:48] Uh, I don't like I I I prefer PayPal. I
[01:55:52] I love PayPal. Um,
[01:55:55] I know a lot of people are looking at
[01:55:57] this. I don't understand this business
[01:55:58] as well and I think it has to go lower
[01:55:59] before I get interested. So, we have
[01:56:01] covered that one a lot. I'm not trying
[01:56:02] to cut it short. I just think that um
[01:56:05] there are higher and better uses. This
[01:56:07] is getting close, but it's not there. My
[01:56:09] guess is if you ask in two months, I'm
[01:56:12] going to be more interested. But um
[01:56:50] It's going it's just going to be very
[01:56:52] hard to make a double quickly on this is
[01:56:54] my biggest problem. I think you're
[01:56:55] generally okay. I mean, even if you
[01:56:57] bought it and it went to 80 before it
[01:56:58] went to 180, it's not a big deal, but um
[01:57:03] uh it's not what I want to focus on
[01:57:06] right now.
[01:57:09] Tom Ferrell,
[01:57:13] put new money to work in E or Etsy now.
[01:57:15] Both.
[01:57:21] Grayson H. We did that one already.
[01:57:31] Make sure
[01:57:36] that's a new client.
[01:57:44] New client. Good. We're done. We'll be
[01:57:46] back next week. Same time, same place.
[01:57:48] In the meantime, make it a great one.
[01:57:50] Bye for now.
