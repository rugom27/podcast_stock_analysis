Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 313th videocast podcast for the week ending October 16, 2025. We got a lot of great data and market stuff to cover this week, but as always, family first. So, want to turn to Mimi's goal on Saturday. She had a couple. This is the one we're sharing this week. >> All right. Pretty exciting stuff. And then Annabelle had a meet. She won both of her events at Nova Aquatics. So, super exciting. Then I had the chance with Jim uh is my client here with the hedge fund tips hat. We'll leave his name out. Uh people like privacy. uh Jim Q and um and his friend Gary who invited me to play Shady Canyon which is so far in my view the greatest golf course in Southern California. Uh what an unbeliev and I'm a member of two others by the way. So I mean this one blew the doors off how amazing it was. Such an amazing time sp you know uh Jim and Gary are business partners together. They've got a great business uh all over the world and uh and they invited me on to play with them. We had such a wonderful time talking family, talking business, talking markets uh and playing a lot of golf. Uh really want to thank them. Had such an amazing time. Look at these background pictures. And uh there's a picture of me at the tea. That was nice of him to take more hedge fund tips. Uh some some cool uh areas around there. and uh really had it's just so beautiful uh that that chorus. Can't wait to play it again. Then I went to uh different car show. This was hypercars only. So I didn't bring any cars to this one uh a few blocks from my house here on the beach. And uh this was a Pagani uh which by the way turned out to be my favorite car. I've never actually seen a Pagani in person. They're sensational and um probably worth every penny. Uh, and then these guys had matching cars and choppers, which I thought was pretty cool. Uh, GTO. This is old school. This I love this stuff. I used to race muscle cars in high school. My friend Clayton and I, uh, Clayton did most of the work, by the way. Uh, I did a lot of the observing. Uh, uh, rebuilt a 70 Chevel 454 in high school. And, um, uh, GTO just I I love muscle cars as well. There's a Bugatti. pretty cool. Couple Bugattis. Uh I think that's a Pagani and that's a Konoang. Uh which which are amazing. I just think the Pagani has much more style. Uh so that was that. And then I was at, believe it or not, a Tony Robbins seminar. I haven't done that for 30 years ago. I listened to his tapes. I was going through all my journals when I uh we moved out from Connecticut to California and I looked at all the goals that I had set and every single one of them had come true in 10 years or less. Uh and and a lot of them way beyond what I could expect. And uh you know my first mentor Jim Ran said to me uh personal development first, productivity second. And uh as unbelievable and and incredible things have have uh uh been going the last handful of years, it was time to set uh new goals for the next 10 years and really step up and level up. So uh had the opportunity to do that with Tony in town. How could you say no? Uh and that was just a fun fun experience. So, want to thank Xiao Dilva for having me on the BBC uh last night to discuss markets uh bank earnings and more. We're going to listen in here. >> Of three of the top US banks have warned that financial markets could be headed into bubble territory. Despite reporting bumper profits in the third quarter, well above estimates, the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, and City warned that investor exuberance risked stock markets becoming unsustainably high. Thomas J. Hayes as the chairman of Great Hill Capital. He joins me live for more on this from New York. Tom, great to speak to you about this today. So, what do you make of these concerns that these banks are raising about the the financial markets and how they could be a little bit frothy? >> Well, I think there's something to that, Steve. Uh if you look at JP Morgan, obviously all the banks beat on the top and bottom line, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, Goldman City, but uh Jen uh uh JP Morgan's credit losses for the third quarter were 3.4 billion, which was the highest since the first half of 2020. He also referenced the bankruptcies of Tricolor, the subprime auto lender, and the bankruptcy of First Brands, which had $10 billion of debt. that was an auto parts supplier. Uh so there's some some maybe some hidden risks particularly in the private credit market that they're alert to. And then if you look at the Bank of America global fund manager survey that came out this morning, it was cited by fund managers managing about a half a trillion dollars, 400 something managers uh that the AI bubble was the biggest risk to the market. So on the one hand we have a barbell. We we look at bank earnings which shot the lights out on deal making and on trading. On the other hand, we still have yet to hear from tech, and this is going to be the first quarter that their earnings growth has actually fallen by half from 32% in Q3 of last year to about 14% this year. So, that guidance is going to have to be really, really good to keep these multiples as high as they are on tech stocks because the earnings growth has decelerated, but the multiples have not yet come down. And I think that's what these CEOs were referencing on the earnings calls today. >> And tell us a bit where these concerns lie then. You mentioned credit losses there. Could you elaborate on that and what that would indicate? >> Well, it's it's a warning shot. They could be discreet one-off events, but you keep your eyes on it because right now credit spreads are compressed. If you see a few more major bankruptcies, credit spreads will start to widen, which will make it tougher for companies to refinance. That's the bad news. The good news is Chair Powell seemed alert to these risks today as certainly in employment and basically said right before the blackout period implied that the that that another cut was coming. So on the one hand you have a little bit of froth in credit markets and and in some pockets of the equity markets. On the other hand, we're moving into an easing environment which is going to help a lot of companies refinance. And maybe some of these uh bankruptcies were actually due to the fact that rates uh rose so quickly and have stayed restrictive for so long. And as that restrictive Fed policy comes out of the markets, uh it could actually uh uh put some some tailwinds behind the economy. And and I think the IMF uh was signaling as much today in their increased outlook of of the global economy at 3.2%. >> And Fed and and Pal as you mentioned, they'll be looking at all this data cautiously. >> That's correct. Yeah. And uh you know Powell has has intimated that he's now going to be less restrictive. He's alert to the the dual-sided risk and predominantly focused on employment now. We've seen the tariff inflation come in less than expected. Uh and the banks overall, you know, we're we're focused on the negatives, but the positives are record banking profits. Animal spirits are back. Goldman Sachs investment banking revenue was up 42%. Uh JP Morgan was up 16%. And then on the trading side, JP Morgan at up 25%. So, positive stuff happening. >> Yeah, the banks will certainly be happy. Thanks very much, Tom, for that. Thomas J. Hayes there, chairman of Great Hill Capital. Leave it there. >> And we're back. And then uh there was a great interview with the CEO of Etsy, one of our holdings, Josh Silverman, talking about the implications of AI on the Etsy business, which makes unique products that can't be commoditized versus all of the other online retailers that may be at the effect of AI moving forward. So, let's listen in here. >> Josh Silverman. Josh, it's it's good to here to break it all down in a CNBC exclusive is MC CEO Josh Silverman. Josh, it's it's good to see you at the exchange. Sorry I couldn't be with you today. I'm in DC. But you guys characterize this as the new chapter, the next chapter in Etsy. And when I think of the sort of eras that I've covered in ETS's life, it's it's the it's the growth in the beginning. It's the COVID era, and now you're kind of in your new AI era. talk a little bit about about that and and why the move. >> Yeah. Well, first with the move, we're so excited to be along many of the most respected and innovative companies uh in the world on the New York Stock Exchange. And I think it is an incredibly exciting time for us as we enter our third decade. And so many of the trends uh particularly with AI and generative AI are unlocking incredible new potential for Etsy to achieve our mission even more powerfully than we've ever been able to do before. Etsy is about keeping commerce human. We connect over 5 million sellers with over 80 million buyers. And it's the combination of technology with humans that's so powerful at Etsy. And you know the New York Stock Exchange with the market maker model is also the combination of technology with humans. So we think it's a nice symbolic moment for this exciting next chapter for Etsy. >> It is. >> Speaking of the stock, is it harder to be a public company? And you know, while your stock has done very well, it's obviously way off the highs that we saw during CO. Is it harder to be a public company and to invest in a new chapter of growth around AI really sort of double down in in that kind of transformational technology right now? >> You know, I love uh being a public company. I love accountability. Uh we have a really accountable culture at Etsy and you know our the investors that we care about are the ones who believe in our future and we think we've got an incredibly bright future ahead and so we we think investments we're making in technology right now can not only drive a lot of productivity. AI is going to do so much for every company to help with the bottom line to help them to become more productive. With Etsy, what I'm so excited about is it's also going to help drive the top line because it helps us fulfill our mission even more powerfully. It helps us to become so much more personalized than we could and to answer questions like which of these items is the most artisal and the best fit for you. Things frankly other other commerce companies are not worried about uh are uniquely benefited by AI and and so I think the future for Etsy is very bright. There's an item on the tape this morning about Walmart and Chad GPT. How do you see this sort of disintermediation working out where you can simply say, "Get me those brown shoes that I saw the other day on the street." Yeah, I think that Etsy is disproportionately positioned to to to win in a world of generative AI and and and agentive commerce. So many of my peers are coming from a defensive stance where they're worried about these chat bots because what the chat bots are going to do is they're going to scour the web and they're going to discover that the item for sale in this place is for sale in 50 other places. And now it's just going to help you find the very cheapest version that'll arrive the fastest. On Etsy, we've got over a 100 million items that are genuinely unique and special made by the maker just for you. So we have something really unique to offer. And in that world, I think these chatbots are going to surface Etsy very often as a great alternative. And I think ultimately we we are a real winner in this. >> So that notion that it it's so good at curating and finding the lowest price, hence margin compression, you see yourself being protected somewhat from that. >> I think so because what a an agent is going to want to do is not present you usually with one answer. It's going to want to present you with a few choices. Here's the cheapest thing you can buy. Here's the thing that's going to arrive the fastest. and then maybe here's the thing that's the most special or unique. And in that world, I think very often Etsy gets presented as one of the most interesting options. And I also think it's going to be able to provide us so much more context. These agents are going to know you really well. And so where often people show up on Etsy and they give us maybe three keywords, a chatbot is going to be able to give us paragraphs of context about who you are and what you like, your tastes and your preferences. This just for you or is it a gift for someone else? for example, and we can do so much more with that in that world. That's why we are on offense here and we're partnering with many of the leading model builders in their very first launches. We have a seat at the table to help define what this future is going to look like. >> Josh, we've known each other for a while. I know you as a fairly thoughtful guy in terms of broadly speaking. What as you see the evolution of AI more broadly do you see the impact? You know, when I think about it, I sort of sometimes wonder, well, are people going to have jobs to spend money on Etsy? How do you view the longer term here positively? >> I think net net net it's positive uh for humanity. There are certainly risks we have to worry about but in my experience the technology evolves much faster than humans and business processes evolve. So what the technology is going to be capable of doing is going to be far in advance of what we are prepared to adopt. And so these changes are actually going to evolve over a longer period of time than I think some people might be thinking, but ultimately their power will be uh terrific. And so for Etsy, for example, we're about an individual maker of over 5 million sellers. Most of them are a business of one working from their home. And the these uh new AI technologies are going to allow those makers to connect with tens of millions of buyers even better and be able to create a human connection create be able to create a feeling of friendship and community in a world that can feel more anonymous. So I think that this technology is going to superpower Etsy to make >> a lot of businesses very easily. I guess >> a lot of businesses and in a time when there's so much macro uncertainty, one thing we've seen is Etsy is so resilient. We don't have complex supply chains like so many other people do. And so I think again this technology is going to help our sellers with their resiliency come meet the moment time and again when consumers really need us. >> That that's just where I was going to go Josh which was the macro uncertainty and the tariff question you know at front and center again today. If we see 100% tariffs on China as we continue to see higher tariff rates across the the globe how's it impacting you and and your products? You know, Etsy has been so resilient through pandemics and supply chain shocks and so many things. We have over 60 million items made by US sellers available for sale for US buyers. And then we've got tens of millions of other items available from other countries. The vast majority of our supply uh outside the US is in Europe. Actually, we have very very little supply coming from Asia. Um, and we've worked really hard with our sellers outside the US to help them understand how to comply with the tariffs and do it in a way that minimizes cost and makes, uh, sure that packages travel quickly. So, I think over time, uh, Etsy will be very resilient to this and we will, our value proposition will get stronger relative to our competitors. >> Josh, really good to talk to you about all the AI excitement and everything else going on. Josh Silverman, the CEO, >> and we're back. Then we got Charlie Munger quote of the week. Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean. We like to buy high quality businesses the in the most dislocated unloved areas of the market when no one else wants them. Durable moed business that have years of cash generation and history. And our edge is distinguishing whether the moat is temporarily impaired or permanently impaired and then putting meaningful amounts of money to work uh when everyone else is selling. And um we learned from the best with Warren and Charlie Seth Clarman. The story stock market is a story of cycles and of the human behavior that is responsible for overreactions in both directions. Uh our first edge is determining temporary versus permanent. Our second edge is time arbitrage. Pat patience, low leverage, and low margin. It's funny, you know, we've been on TV for the last two weeks since October 1st talking about uh we've raised cash, we've come off margin, we're being cautious. Uh new clients know that only a portion of your uh capital has been put to work. And you know, as the market went up a couple of days, people were like, "Well, can we put money to work?" Blah, blah, blah. And yeah, we could do that. We can get the timing perfect. But, uh, number one, I'm going to show you that it's it's probably going to be relatively mild in terms of indices pullback. And we're already starting to see some of the volatility that we had anticipated when everyone else was like bye bye bye at the top. Um and two, even though you'll have mild pullback uh we think in in coming weeks in the indices, certain names will be down even if the indices are down mid-s single digits. Uh certain names can be down double digits and more and that's where we're going to pounce and that's where we're going to take advantage. uh and slowly starting to, you know, there are enough of portfolio positions we have that we can be adding at these levels because the margin of safety is baked uh in, but um we live and love times like this. Uh so um so we're going to talk a lot about that this week. By the way, go to hedge funips.com. We got a new popup. I know you guys love getting the popup every five minutes. You could just shut it off by clicking this X. But if you're not on the regular daily list, you should do that for the daily reads. We put a lot of work into that. You can have an insight into some of the things we're looking at on a daily basis which can be helpful to you uh related to our names, related to the markets, etc. And we'll figure out how to get this thing only popping up once, but for now just click the X. Uh then I want to thank all the people that have been buying the Hedge Fund Tips merch. And the reason I want to thank them is because for us to keep doing this for non-clients, we'll always do it for clients. uh uh we got to keep growing. And you know what? We're keeping we we're not only growing, we're growing like crazy. And the reason we're growing like crazy is because you are selflessly and generously paying it forward to people you love and care about that could benefit from information about markets uh and investing. And I can't tell you the number of new clients that came in this last quarter's raise that said, "I started listening to you because soand so referred to me. They've been listening for three years or so and so is a client of yours and they referred me to you." So for that, I'm very, very grateful and we want to get you the proper recognition. So, like Jim, who is wearing the hedge fund tips hat, by the way, and you saw me wearing the hedge fund tips hat at the cars and shoppers, uh, because people ask about that. What's that all about? Well, it's the number one podcast in the hedge fund category. We talk about great companies that we own and like and why. We take questions from the audience. So, if you love markets, if you love individual companies and investing, uh, come and listen to Turnaround Tom, uh, and you'll find some some great value. But we want to get a bunch more of you on the website because a lot of you are ordering this. But the key again is not about the few bucks we make on a hat. The key is that people ask you and we spread the word and it's much easier to wear the merch or the mug and people say, "What's that all about?" And get them to listen to an episode and maybe it's for them and maybe it's not. It's just like reading the intelligent investor, you know, or you don't. The other thing that's cool is if you go to hedge funfundtips.com and that popup comes up, um, we have a new popup that gets you on the daily list, but also we're going to send you a copy of the intelligent investor to download and also the audio version uh, which is the Bible in our view for investing and, uh, you'll be able to take advantage of that. Those of you who are already on the list got an email yesterday with the book and all of the new people that have been uh subscribing have been getting it as they subscribe. Let's talk about some market indicators and there are a lot of what we call divergences which is when the indices are very low and the indicators are improving. But in this case, the indices are very high and the indicators are deteriorating. Again, uh most of you know me or I've been accused uh on public TV of being an optimist, of which I um am guilty as charged. Uh I have been accused of being a permable which is not accurate but I'm bullish more than I'm bearish because the odds are with me 70% of the time that mark you know markets go up but what we really are is private equity in the public markets and the reason we prefer to do it in the public markets is the prices that we are able to pay from time to time for some of the greatest businesses in the world would never exist in the private markets because of the way public markets are set up structurally and how managers are incentivized. When a company falls out of favor, it's irrespective of price or underlying fundamentals. It's a crowd to the exit and we are there to take advantage until the tide turns and uh and consistently do that with low risk. So, we don't have to take gamles on what's going to be the next shiny object or hot trend or this or that and wake up one day that the company missed earnings by a penny and the stock is down 30%. We don't play in that world. We play in durable sustainable businesses where if we are unwilling to buy the entire company with 100% of our own net worth financed debt financed by JP Morgan then we won't even buy one share. Okay. And that's how the kind of work we do to underwrite each position in our universe and in our portfolios uh to take advantage of. And um we have IRRa hurdles. You know, you'll see a lot of ask me anything questions this week that you know, maybe they'll go up 25, 50%, 75%, but if they're not doubles or triples over the next few years, we're not going to allocate capital even though they are good ideas. They are we look for highest and best use. So, let's get to some of these indicators. We've got an awful lot of stuff to cover this week. So, you can see the 10day put call ratio uh is subdued. There's a lot of uh uh kind of froth in the in the market still. Uh this is interesting. You're seeing here the uh 1% EMA advanced decline ratio. It's diverging down, but the indices are holding up. Usually when it gets down towards these levels, you've had a correction. We've not had a real correction. Uh, and I think that's something to keep an eye on. Uh, similar to this, uh, NASDAQ declining issues. Again, this is showing a weakening of breath. You have the indices near all-time highs, which is usually meaning declining issues near all-time highs, but the index is still at all-time highs, which means a few names which could potentially get monkey hammered this earning season are holding up the tech index and uh most of them are deteriorating under the surface. So, these are signs when it gets elevated like this that you're probably due for a little bit of pullback consolidation. Same with NASDAQ Cohen uh high low um up down uh volume on balance volume. Uh let's see here. These are just some sectors that are kind of mid-range. Here is Dowo intermediate term breath momentum oscillator. The breath levels are at levels you usually see at market bottoms and this it really hasn't come off the top. So when you see these wide open mouths, there's usually a catchup similar to what you saw before April. We're not going to get anything like April. Don't worry about that. Uh but even here, this was going down before you got a 5% pullback. I think that's more in the range of what we're looking for. um uh here this started to deteriorate before you got a I think this is a good analog here in 2020 after the huge rip off the lows you got this kind of 2 3 months of volatility 5% 6% 7% pullbacks before resuming the uptrend and I think that will be the case uh which is why we're going to use the opportunity to not only deploy all the cash we have but go back to normalized margin levels of probably 10 to 15% uh once we really get some wash out here and all the Johnny come latelys that were selling in the hole in April and buying uh at the top in uh mid to late September uh get monkey hammered out and um and we can pick up their ashes. So similar here with S&P midcap intermediate term volume momentum oscillator. Again, this is down at levels. It precedes pullbacks. We haven't really gotten the real pullback yet. So, we're seeing a lot of these divergences here. Again, you can see this fishmouth divergence. This is going down, which is usually what you see at bottoms. This is the S&P Mlen summation indices holding up. Um, it's just consistent divergence across. So, I I expect more weakness in coming weeks is what I'm trying to say. And I'm intermediate term bullish. So, uh, you don't need to go take an Advil. Everything's going to be okay. This is where we flourish and this is where opportunity is. So, you'll have a short-term mark tomarket on the existing holdings. Uh, and then, uh, we will use all cash to buy a bunch of other holdings at lower prices and ride it back up. Bullish percent again diverging, rolling over while the indices holding up. And I think this is going to be techled the weakness in coming weeks. Uh you're seeing you saw the Amazon break its 200 day moving average. Uh generally not consistent with bullishness. Mlen summation same story. Turning over indices not yet following. They will catch up. Sorry to be Debbie Downer guys. I'm just a realist and I like to make money. I don't play the hand that I want. I play the hand that I'm dealt and I play it as well as it can be played. And um we do that consistently. Skew again, it's at these levels. You're going to get some chop. Uh and this Elliot wave pattern is is still in a a downtrend. Not that I pay a lot of attention to that, but I do pay attention. Now, in the context of personal development first, productivity second, this is a excerpt from the last annual shareholder letter that Jeff Bezos wrote as CEO of Amazon. And we're going to do some of this type of learning stuff because, as you know, I read and listen to a lot of audio books and I don't always share the lessons, but I think it's going to um be helpful. He cites a passage from Richard Dawkins book, The Blind Watchmaker. It's about a basic fact of biologies. quote, "Staving off death is a thing that you have to work at, left to itself, and that is what it is when it dies. The body tends to revert to a state of equilibrium with its environment. If you measure some quantity such as temperature, the acidity, the water content, or electrical potential of a living body, you'll typically find that it is marketkedly different from the corresponding measure in the surroundings. Our bodies, for instance, are usually hotter than our surroundings. And in cold climates, they have to work hard to maintain the differential. When we die, the work stops. The temperature differential starts to disappear, and we end up the same temperature as our surroundings. Not all animals work so hard to avoid coming into equilibrium with their surrounding temperature. But all animals do some comparable work. For instance, in a dry country, animals and plants work to maintain the fluid content of their cells, work against the natural tendency for water to flow from them into the dry outside world. If they fail, they die. More generally, if living things didn't work actively to prevent it, they would eventually merge into their surroundings and cease to exist as autonomous beings. That is what happens when they die. End quote. So Jeff has this to say. While the passage is not intended as metaphor, it's nevertheless a fantastic one and very relevant to Amazon. Substitute Amazon with any business or endeavor or skill. Basically theme what you don't use you lose. Business is not static. Life is not static. You are either moving forward at every moment in time or you are moving backward at any moment in time. And like Jim Ran said, my first mentor, if you don't produce, you won't be happy. It's not about adding more zeros. It's about being more productive and adding more value and getting more fulfillment. So what Jeff Bezos says here is I would argue that it's relevant to all companies and all institutions and to each of our individual lives too. In what ways does the world pull at you in an attempt to make you normal aka make you fit in? How much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness? Okay. How about when everyone's chasing the shiny objects and you're buying defensives because they can't give them away. All of a sudden the shiny objects start to back off. And what's up? Defensives going crazy. So to keep alive the thing. So how much work does it take to maintain your distinctiveness to keep alive the thing or things that make you special? I know a happily married couple who have a running joke in their relationship. Not infrequently, the husband looks at the wife with faux distress and says to her, "Can't you just be normal?" They both smile and laugh. And of course, the deep truth is that her distinctiveness is something he loves about her. But at the same time, it's also true that things would often be easier, take less energy if we were a little more more normal. This phenomenon h happens at all scale levels. Democracies are not normal. Tyranny is the historical norm. If we stop doing all the continuous hard work that is needed to maintain our distinctiveness in that regard, we would quickly come into equilibrium with tyranny. We all know about distinctiveness. Originality is valuable. We are all taught to quote be yourself. What I'm really asking you to do is embrace and be realistic about how much energy it takes to maintain that distinctiveness. The world wants you to be typical and in a thousand ways it pulls at you. Don't let it happen. You have to pay a price for your distinctiveness and it's worth it. The fairy tale version of be yourself is that all the pain stops as soon as you allow your distinctiveness to shine. That version is misleading. Being yourself is worth it, but don't expect it to be easy or free. You'll have to put the energy into it continuously. The world will always try to make Amazon more typical to bring us into equilibrium with our environment. It will take continuous effort, but we can and must be better than that. I mean, that right there is uh brilliant wisdom. And then some quotes from Charlie Mer. Uh we're, you know, probably, let's see, control plus plus. This is uh some of his investing checklist. Maybe we'll go into this in more detail on another day, but uh on risk, he says all investment evaluation should begin by measuring risk, especi especially reputational. Incorporate an appropriate margin of safety. Avoid dealing with people of questionable character. Insist upon proper compensation for risk assumed. That's why we look for doubles and triples. Plus, always be aware of inflation and interest rate exposures. Avoid big mistakes and shun permanent capital loss. Independence. Only in fairy tales are emperors told they are naked. Objectively and rationally require independence of thought. Remember that just because other people agree or disagree with you doesn't make you right or wrong. The only thing that matters is the correctness of your analysis and judgment. Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean. No one's ever accused me of mimicking the herd. I can assure you of that. Uh merely average performance preparation. The only way to win is to work work and hope to have a few insights. Develop a lifelong self-learner thought through through voracious reading. Cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little bit wiser every day. More important than the will to win is the will to prepare. Develop fluency in mental models from the major academic disciplines. If you want to get smart, the questions you have to keep asking is why? Why? Why? Intellectual humility. Acknowledging what you don't know is the dawning of wisdom. As you note, we stay in a very narrow lane of our circle of competence and we keep our blinders on. Uh stay within a well-defined circle of competence. Identify and reconcile disisconfirming evidence. That's the number one thing I look for is tell me the reasons why not versus the reasons why. Resist the craving for false precision, false certainties, etc. And above all, never fool yourself and remember that you are the easiest person to fool. Understanding both the power of compound interest and the difficulty of getting it is the heart and soul of understanding a lot of things. Analytic rigor, the use of the scientific method and effective checklist to minimize errors and omissions. Determine value apart from price, progress apart from activity, and wealth apart from size. in this business. Why so many successful entrepreneurs give me their money to manage uh after they sell their business is not because I'm smarter than them. It's because they're smarter than me. They realize what it took for them to become the best in their fields and they would rather delegate to someone who is very good in their own field uh and benefit from it without all of the work. Furthermore, the super smart ones realize that they became wealthy as a result of massive action equals massive results. It's a genetic wiring that made them so successful in business. In investing, unfortunately, the exact opposite wiring is the wiring that creates the most success, which is massive inaction equals massive results. The more activity you take with trading, with investing, the lower your returns will be over time. Certainly after tax and generally absolutely um and uh it's better to remember the obvious than grasp the esoteric. Be a business analyst, not a market, macroeconomic or security analyst. Consider totality of risk and effect. Always look at potential second order and higher level effects. Think forwards and backwards. Invert. Always invert. So, you know, if someone's going to um, you know, become a a a scratch golfer, rather than say, well, what do I have to do be to become a scratch golfer? I think the the framework should be uh what actions would I take to guarantee that I never become a scratch golfer? You know, number one uh is practice very little. Number two, be very emotional on the golf course when you hit a bad shot. Number three, think you know everything. Number four, um uh never have someone look objectively at you that has more skill than you to find your blind spots. Think you know it all. Uh uh number five, um just focus on hitting driver and don't spend any time at the short range. So when you get through all this list of how to guarantee you never become a scratch golfer then you say well if I do want to become a scratch golfer I might want to do the opposite of a lot of those things and and inverting is critical in investing why not why should we buy this why shouldn't we buy this it's it's it's it's the process of uh excluding not the process of including when it comes to uh investing remember that the highest and best use is always measured by the next best use the opportunity cost good ideas are rare When the odds are greatly in your favor, bet and allocate heavily. Don't fall in love with an investment. Be situation dependent and opportunity driven. Patience. Resist the natural human bias to act. Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. Never interrupt it unnecessarily. Avoid unnecessary transactional taxes and frictional costs. Uh never take action for its own sake. Trading in and out, doing short-term options, all this stuff. Be alert for the arrival of luck and embrace it. Enjoy the process along with the proceeds because the process is where you live. The framework, ladies and gentlemen. Decisiveness. When proper circumstances present themselves, act with decisiveness and conviction like we did with Alibaba. Okay, we started buying it over a 100. It went down to 80. It went down to 60. Do you know what it was like being on the podcast the day it was 58 and 60 and buying it till our fingers bled to bring our basis down to $82 when everyone was saying China was uninvestable, everything's going to get delisted, all these well-meaning uh non-informed uh emotional uh uh talking heads that that were were scaring you out of out of your stock at the exact wrong time. We knew 80 billion of cash, 25 billion of free cash flow, buying in the float, growing the business, cheapest play on AI. We stuck to the underlying underwriting the business. Not a market analyst, not a securities analyst, a business analyst. What was the business worth? And when you backed out the cash, they were giving it giving you the business. They were literally giving it away. And they still are when you consider the sum of the parts. Uh change, live with change, and accept unreovable complexity. Recognize and adapt to the nature of the world around you. Don't expect to it to adapt to you. Continually challenge and willingly amend your bestloved ideas. Recognize reality even when you don't like it, especially when you don't like it. And finally, focus. Keep things simple and remember what you set out to do. Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat. Guard against the effects of hubris, arrogance, and boredom. Don't overlook the obvious by drowning in minutia, the small details. Be careful to exclude unneeded information or slop. A small leak can sink a great ship. And face your big troubles. Don't sweep them under the rug. So, that's uh the the key thing here. Preparation, discipline, patience, and decisiveness. So, I thought that would be a valuable add-on. Speaking of Charlie, Bergkshire Hathway Home Services expects a surge in unoccupied homes left behind by baby boomers. As baby boomers age, they are expected to leave behind homes that many prospective buyers won't be able to afford. This could shake the already tenuous housing market as demand among older and younger home buyers shifts towards smaller and affordable homes. And that's why I've been saying, ladies and gentlemen, I think that top end uh in certain pockets of the country, the houses that were 5 million precoid that are now 15 and 20 are going back to 7 and 8. It's a matter of whether it's 24, 36, or 48 months. So, keep your powder dry and get that beachfront property by uh make make your money over the next four years uh in the stock market and uh and and and buy your your dream home. Uh, but don't pay up. Don't don't top ticket. Buy it uh when everyone else is selling. We're not there yet by any stretch of the imagination. China new car sales off the charts. You can see here. Here is T- mall, which is a division of BABA. The best pre-sale in the whole year broke out. 35 individual brand turnover exceeded 100 million. 1802 brand turnover doubled. Number of brands exceeded 100 million. and the number of brands that doubled transactions with the number of active users exceeded the same cycle last year. That's from Brendan Ahern. Uh stages of record recovery rally from April 8th low. This is the average recovery uh after 15% corrections. This has been above average. So I I think we're also going to see a little bit of short-term consolidation just to get it back to mean. Uh data centers keep growing at breakneck plays. Play that through uh natural gas, ladies and gentlemen, with our comm stock. every person with a 401k account puts on average. These are the going to be the people that get hurt the most with the MAG 7 in the short term. One of the best six months rallies ever equals more good times. 12 months out, 9.2%. Uh that's since 1950. S&P performance after 35% plus 6-month rally. We think this is accurate. I think that is going to be the case looking 12 months out. But I think the the path to get there is going to be a little bit choppy. um fixed investment. Here's the dollar. Broke down. Now, it's probably going to retest that with a little strength before continuing the long-term downtrend. I mean, you guys got to love it when we were just saying, "Guys, this is a fake breakout. We continue to be bearish on the dollar." And sure enough, that's been the theme all year, which is going to help this earning season a little bit as a tailwind. uh seven out of six out of 11 sectors are expected to post positive earnings growth in Q3 Q uh earnings growth of 8% which is a decentsized bar. We'll see how that goes. Uh cash held by households again the household balance sheets are phenomenal. Um and the uh cost of debt service relative to income again is again very healthy. So we don't want to get too bearish but we do want to take a opportunity of any shortterm chop cash holdings biggest weekly inflow into healthc care. We were talking about this now it's starting to happen. By the way defensive started to get a bid in the last couple of days. Uh asset managers are getting a little bit nervous here. They were selling the bottom, buying the top. Now they're now they're getting hit again. Uh annualized one-mon volatility seasonal composite for the foury year election cycle. So this is the period of time in the 4-year presidential cycle that tends to see a huge spike in volatility. Last few days VIX above 20. I think we're going to see more of that in coming weeks. consumer staples, market cap versus earnings. Uh you could just see how beat down it is. The lowest level since 2000 when Buffett was buying all those staples and then outperformed everyone for the next four or five years when everyone was saying, "Has he lost his touch? He's not changing the shiny objects. Look at my idiot neighbor who just made 10x." Oh, and by the way, not only they get the 10x back to the back to the casino, they got a margin call and and got their account liquidated uh 12 months later. But uh what else do you want to talk about? Too bad if they can't take a joke. Uh consumer staples. Again, this just puts it in perspective going back to 2000. This is where we want to have exposure. Whether it's Dagio, whether it's Baxter, whether it's Estee Lauder, all the staples will do well in these type of environments and they will dramatically, you know, so even when you came out of that recession going all the way up to 2007, as everything was starting to hum from 2003 to 2007, they were still doing well. Okay, short interest picking up S&P streak. So again, this shows the current streak without a pullback, one of the longest and strongest evers, we're getting a pullback. So just hang in there. So when you look at, you know, much higher levels of cash than you've seen or lower levels of margin than you've seen in a long time from me, um, be grateful and patient. You'll you'll understand why in coming weeks. So, uh, all right. Dollar remains substantially overvalued. So, continues to support the bare thesis as we've been talking about. uh tech waiting highest level since 2000 before the last correction in tech. We're not calling for anything like that because earnings power is much greater than it was. But we are calling for some consolidation. Uh this shows the tailwind. This is the most important chart of the week, ladies and gentlemen. And by the way, if you're listening, we love you. If you want to get twice the value, watch it on YouTube and see all this data. I know it takes a little bit more time, but it's worth it. Um, or do whatever makes you happy. Okay? You know, so so funny. Someone once said to me, you know, I love your podcast, but they're just so long. You know, it's two hours. I said, well, first off, the podcast part is an hour. The AMA is another hour. But then just listen to 20 minutes worth. You just get 20% of the value. It's okay. You're not offending me. If you if you wanted, you know, I could give you a a you know, uh 12minute podcast, which would be, you know, 20% of the value, but uh you might miss some things that could make you a ton of money. Uh or as we like to say, a ton of money. So, all right. Uh S&P 500 hits an all-time high after 15% draw down in the same year. What happens to the secondary draw down? On average, that secondary draw down, which would be what I'm talking about now, averages 6.4%. So, you've had them between 3% to 9.6%, but secondary draw downs are always less than 10%. So, I think somewhere between 3 to 9% in coming weeks would be reasonable. I think closer to six or 7% because of the stocks that are going to get hit have such high waitings. Uh and we will be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways as we hoover up all the stuff that people who bought at the top are puking out. Uh let's see. Okay. uh investor sentiment from the Bank of America survey near moving towards highs not extreme again that's why I don't think we get anything more than a you know four to four to 9% implied correlation with S&P 500 is as low his historical levels stock pickers paradise CTA position got a little rich here. They're getting ready to get smoked. Uh high bar set for earnings revisions were up. Keep an eye on that. Recession expectations the lowest. So there's, you know, there's a lot of super happiness, justifiably so, but got to take a little air out of the pocket just to just to uh uh normalize things. put volume is starting to pick up. So, it's something to keep an I mean, I'd be surprised if we ended at a 3% correction, but it's not out of the question. There is a lot of money on the sidelines, but I I think we're going to see a little more pain as tech starts to report. Um, small cap equity position starting to improve. Still huge opportunity there on a company by company basis. Industrial Renaissance continues. This is interesting. I mean, this is shocking to me. This says, "A bad year for stock pickers. Only 22% of active funds beat the market. Poised for the worst annual showing in decades." This has been such an amazing year to make money. It's mind-boggling um to see this. And I think a lot of this is that the people that sold in the hole in April uh and didn't buy back and have been skeptical and now they bought the top in September. I think there going to be a lot of people that are going to be future Walmart greeters uh uh coming out of this year that sold the bottom in April, bought the top in September, and now are going to be puking out uh in October right before we take off into the year end. Small caps versus large caps starting to really move in earnest and outperform large caps. You guys have been waiting for it. It's happening since August as small has dramatically outperformed large. Russell 2000 outperformed Russell 1000. This is interesting. Uh, from Matt Serminaro, utilities are the best sector in the S&P 500 year to date, up 23% but have only contributed half a percent to the S&P's 14.2% gain. That's because it only has a 2.4% waiting in the index. Wait till we see this with energy next. Um, investors surrounding tech heavy with cash, crypto, gold themes, total. Okay, look at this. Oh my goodness. Total equity flows, mutual funds, ETF, percentage of assets. They bought everything in the middle of September. So, these guys got to get smoked before we we move back higher into year-end rally. So, I think this is going to take a few weeks. You know, you got the overhang. This uh shutdown continues. People aren't paying it. I think there's a little bit of whistling past the graveyard here. Uh shutdown continues. The China deal is not inked. that will get done, but um China has a little bit more strength than I think the administration anticipated. Uh but ultimately not enough to not get a deal done. Um and then uh earnings and margin compression with the MAG 7, which is 35% of the S&P by the dip week for stocks inflows the largest. So there's a lot of chasing at the exact wrong times. A lot of one day options at the exact wrong times. We talked about the 40 million contracts a day, last 25 sessions. So, um, there we go. Albamaro, look at this bad boy. No one wanted it at 50. Everyone wants it at 95. This probably consolidates a little bit before starting to make its parabolic move up. Maybe something like this, like what we saw here in 2009 off the lows. Big pullback to this green line and then straight up. Uh, a lot of great data here, but not a ton of time. So, let's get keep going here. Sentiment is still wiped. So, that that's what puts that's what puts a floor on the amount that we can correct. Uh, and why I'm not calling for anything greater than nine than 9% uh, and maybe less than that. Maybe somewhere between four and six would make a lot of sense. Just enough to scare people out, but not enough to based on all the cash and how low the sentiment is at present. Retail options call overput direction. I mean, ladies and gentlemen, all I can tell you is it's not a good time to be a buyer of equities when retail is buying this many call options. So, um you can be damn sure that the folks, your friendly market makers that are selling the premium and the dealers and the big banks selling all this premium to uh overly zealous retail investors at the top are not going to allow them to get paid. I can guarantee you that uh longest retail weekly option buying streaks on record since 2020. Uh total options this is unbelievable. Retail options volume. Yeah. All this premium all of this premium is going to go to zero. All of it. I'm telling you that right now. Over the next four to eight weeks these none of these people will get get paid. All the people who sold this, the dealers, the big banks are going to make a fortune. That's why you saw record trading profits when volatility increases. You saw it in earnings this week. Okay, that's it on the data. Let's go through some headlines. Alibaba says it's AI spending in ecommerce is already breaking even. Uh Alibaba banks on AI to boost single day sales on Tao and T- Mall. China's Lee renews call to boost consumption side of the economy. Alibaba is the toll taker. 40 cents of every dollar on the e-commerce side, which is a huge part of their much bigger part of their uh retail than it is ours. Alibaba Cloud Inc.'s multi-year deal with NBA China in latest sports related collaboration. Alibaba is the top pick of analysts. I mean, you can't make this stuff up. 12 months ago, same publication, different author, 135 consecutive negative articles on China and Alibaba. Now, it's the top pick of analysts. Why the stock could rise another 32%. Opinion follows trend. Trump and X still plan to meet this month. Bessant says uh worldwide EV delivery soared to a record 2.1 million units in September. 62% made in China. Go Cooper Standard.

This is another tailwind in the face of the headwinds that I've discussed, which is why I said there is a floor on the volatility you're going to see. You're going to feel like it could go all the way back down like April. It's not going to happen. Uh but it will get you to that breaking point and that and just know we will be in the market buying on your behalf at those points. Uh nation's biggest banks are saying economy is still strong. We agree. Bubble or not, the AI spending b is unprecedented in every way. Critical mineral firms boost Washington lobbying as US expands investments. Why biotech rally can last this time? How you doing? It's on its way. Back in style stock market and sentiment results. Uh so the Bank of America fund manager survey on Tuesday. We put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America global fund manager survey. this month surveyed 193 institutional managers with 468 billion in AUMUM. There were three five key points. One, opinion follows trend. Fund manager allocation to emerging market equities has jumped to a net 46% overweight from a from 27% last month, the highest since February of 2021. This was a trade you couldn't give away at the start of the year other than to our loyal hedge fund tips audience. Yet now that emerging markets is outperforming US 2:1, it's suddenly all anyone wants to talk about. And by the way, China outperforming by 321. Two sentiment among fund managers based on cash levels, equity allocation, and global growth expectations has climbed to an 8-month high, rising to 5.8 from 5.3. Yet these readings remain well below prior market peaks like late 2024, Trump 2.0, 2021 blue wave, 2018 tax cuts, or 204 bricks. Plenty of gas left in the tank. Agree. Intermediate to long-term. Disagree. Short-term. Three. Recession expectations among fund managers have fallen to their lowest level since February 2022 with a net 69% saying a global recession is unlikely compared to the liberation day peak when 42% expected one. Exactly why this remains one of the most hated V-shaped rallies. As we pointed out in recent weeks, Fed rate cuts in a non-recessionary environment have historically seen stocks up on average 17% one year out. Four. 33% of fund managers now view an AI equity bubble as the biggest tail risk for the second time on record. Up from just 11% last month. Managers seem to be waking up to the fact that MAG7 earnings growth has been cut by more than half to just 14% this quarter. While multiples have yet to come down at a commensurate rate. And five, watch as they do, not as they say. Despite growing fears of an AI equity bubble and a record 60% of managers viewing global stocks as overvalued, they continue to neglect defensive areas of the stock market. most notably consumer staples. Fund managers are now net 24% underweight staples, 1.5 standard deviations below the long-term average, a 12point drop from 12% underweight last month and the lowest allocations to staple 2021. Uh we continue to view these boring corners of the market as ripe hunting grounds for opportunity. VFC Corp update with Q3 earning season kicking off and many of our holdings set to report next week. We thought it was a good time to revisit the an exciting update from one of our larger positions. Last month, VF Corp announced the sale of Dickies to Blueest Star Alliance in an allcash deal worth 600 million expected to close by end of year 2025. After VF's reporting structure changed last quarter to remove Dickies from disclosure, spun as an effort to quote simplify reporting and make performance easier to track, it became increasingly clear the brand was struggling, not a top priority, and likely headed for sale. Dickies had posted three consecutive years of double-digit revenue declines, falling to just 542 million in fiscal year 2025 with no sign of an inflection as sales continued to drop last quarter. While VF Corf doesn't break out operating income by brand, we can do some quick back of the envelope math and get a rough idea of the work segment which includes Dickies and Timberland Pro generated 833 million in revenue and 53 million in operating income in fiscal year 2025 with Dickies accounting for roughly twothirds of the segment sales. Even assuming Dicki's contributed twothirds of the operating income, which is very generous given Timberland's relative strength, and applying the DNA consistent with historical averages, the deal implies a multiple north of 12 times Ibida and 1.1 times sales of premium to the overall company. All things considered, offloading the struggling brand should have investors over the moon, especially at that price credit to management who originally had no plans to devest the brand for recognizing the opportunity and making it happen. This is part part of Bracken's cleanup. For those of you who knew, Bracken's only been in for, you know, over a year, but relatively new. He was not responsible for buying that bag of S. On top of that, the deal removes another headache by allowing VF to further delever, taking out a solid chunk of 4.1 billion of long-term debt on the balance sheet. Management plans to use all the full cash proceeds to address the upcoming 500 euro million in long-term notes due March 2026, avoiding the need to tap the AL line and incur additional interest expense. That move will reduce leverage by more than half a turn and put VF well on track to reach its 2.5 times target by fiscal year 2028 with the next maturity not until March 2028. With the rest of the business continuing to accelerate and generate solid free cash flow, VF should be able to handle the future obligations organically. That begs the question, with a $2 billion authorization already in place, at what point will management start buying back stock hand over fist? Bracken, are you listening? Ladies and gentlemen, this is kind this kind of deal is exactly why we got involved with VF Corp in the first place. There are plenty of other beaten down apparel names out there that look cheap, whether it's Nike, Lulu, or even Under Armour. We have no doubt that over time those names will get bid and start to turn around. But something we always look for in investments. And a central part to our thesis on VF is the value of having multiple outs. For my poker players out there, you understand exactly what this means. VF's portfolio of 11 brands give Brack and Daryl plenty of options to buy, sell, or lean into this environment. It started with a $ 1.5 billion Supreme sale last summer to delever the balance sheet, and now Dickies is the latest out to leverage. That has been VF's playbook since 1899. not 1999, $18.99, buying, building, and selling a portfolio of brands. And we don't see that changing anytime soon. Not to mention, we're betting on one of the best jockeyies out there to lead the turnaround, Bracken Daryl. During his eight years at Logitech, the stock went from $5 to $133, delivering a 27 bagger. A million dollar investment in Bracken would have turned into 27 million. For those who haven't already listened to our interview with him below, it's well worth your time. you will quickly quickly understand two things. Number one, why we have so much confidence in Bracken and number two, with the stock trading still trading at $14, why the only question we have been asking is how many shares can we possibly get our hands on. Just a few days after the Dickies announcement, Bracken and CFO Paul Vogel spoke at the Wells Fargo Consumer Conference giving more details on the Dickies deal and a highle update on each of the brands in the portfolio. Below are the five key takeaways in a highlighted transcript from the discussion. Number one, the aggressive cleanup actions at Vans, which drove 40% of the brand's decline last quarter, are expected to be fully completed by Q4 after closing 20% of the DTC stores over the last two years. The store footprint is now largely where it needs to be, allowing the focus to shift towards delivering great products and marketing. Bracken expects Suno's influence to become increasingly evident with new products this holiday season and even more in the spring. Marketing efforts, especially SDA, artistic director partnership, are set to ramp up heading into the holidays with plenty of interesting initiatives planned. Three, Northace continues its push to become a true four-season brand, targeting two times growth in apparel, two times in bags and equipment, and three times in footwear. Bracken expects the summer spring collection to mark the real start of this transformation supported by marketing and pipeline of new products that will only grow from here. A key part of the strategy will be replacing the Northace success in EMA and APAC in replicating in the US with a stronger focus on premium products. Three, Timberland continues to show strength with Bracken describing it as a resurgence in the interest of the yellow boot. More importantly, this momentum is spilling over into other products with both the boat shoe and the Eurohiker showing positive sales trends. Management attributes much of the success to renewed interest in the premium end of the market driven by key collaborations like Louis Vuitton and Fel similar to dynamic emerging at Vans where Valentino set of products are selling out. Vans by Valentino you can't make this stuff up. Four, Altra, a brand management had hardly mentioned in prior calls and is now beginning to focus on, is tied for the number one trail running shoe and is one of the fastest growing road running shoes, posting 20% growth last quarter. The brand continues to show strength and has significant potential to scale with awareness still only at 8%. And five, management expects that cost reductions, strategic pricing actions, and plant relocations will fully offset tariff costs by next year compared to the 70 to 60 to 70 million impact projected for this fiscal year. VF has also has little to no exposure to the dimminimous exemption. Okay. Uh moving on, fear is starting to kick in. down to 36 on the fear and greed. Congratulate, by the way, uh we're pleased to announce the successful close of our Q3 opening. That's for the smaller accounts at $1 million.

Oil and gas services went down by 9%. I think we're getting to the trough here for oil and gas services estimates uh moving forward. And there's opportunities in the space like NOV, National Oil Wellvarco, which we love. Love the balance sheet, love the cash flow, love the opportunity, love the play on unlimited demand for energy. Not much economic data with the government still shut down. Um, and now we're on to the ask me anything questions. So, let's get started. First off, thanks for listening in. Those of you who don't like Ask Me Anything, we'll see you next week. Those who love Ask Me Anything. Our first question comes from Reed Wade. Tom, first time writing in an AMA question. Big fan of the pod. Thanks for sharing your wealth of knowledge. You're tr truly doing everyone a great service. I tell everyone in my circle about the pod. Thank you very much. That means a lot. Um, and by the way, for those of you buying the hats and the uh uh mugs and the golf shirts and all that stuff, please send in a picture. Uh, we're getting like 10x the amount of orders that we are pictures. Uh, we'll put you on the site so the community can see you and, uh, get you some recognition. So, send it to info@hedgeed funtips.com. Your picture wearing the hat or drinking the mug or the shirt, etc. Uh, I tell everyone in my circle about your pod. Did you take a look at Globent S A G L O B? I'd be happy to read. Thank you for sharing and supporting and listening in. We are very grateful. All right, this stock is down a lot. Let's take a look at what they do. I can tell you right now, it's a broken stock. It's going to take a couple years to form a base, but I'll let you know if we're in the neighborhood of where it makes sense to start slowly accumulating. So, what do they do? Oh, okay. times market cap 2 and a half billion enterprise value 2.9 technology services compromise AI studio network AI adaption of media and entertainment healthcare finance yeah the issue here is that they may have no moat. Any of these technology software companies, they could be disintermediated by AI and uh it's a shoot first, ask questions later. It's probably an overshoot, but unless you have a real edge as to how their moat will never be impaired by AI. Uh, you know, look, I just want to buy generators, planes, van sneakers, uh, [Music] uh, Disney tickets, Disney cruises. I I mean, I like simple stuff that I don't have to worry about this kind of stuff. This thing could be zero, but probably won't be probably going to be an unbelievable turnaround opportunity, but like I have no edge. Unless you have an edge on the software moat, then just take a pass. It goes into the two hard box. Michael Costa Selines, we like it. It's got a lot of debt, so you got to do a maturity scale, but I think that one's going to be okay over time. Robert uh Wartanian Unicredited is Unicredit a stock you would recommend for a turnaround? Dude, it's up 12x in the last two years. You couldn't I wouldn't I mean, no, but I'd like to welcome you to the podcast. Um, you're probably new and you're going to learn a framework over the next 6 to 12 months that is going to help you avoid chasing what's already worked in the re rearview mirror and start buying those things that haven't begun to work um before they get popular, you know. So, you would be you'd be more interested in this down here at two bucks or three bucks than you would at 40. That's not to say it doesn't go higher, but I mean, let's just take a look here. There's no way we could buy this. Um, even if they were curing cancer, which I don't think they are. So, you know, revenues are back to 2012 levels. Congratulations. Free cash flow is still negative. Yeah, hard hard pass. But you are going to have the best 12 months of your life listening and learning this framework from an investing standpoint than you've probably had in the last 20 years, Robert. So hang in there. Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes and um enjoy learning the framework. Be patient. And by the way, go to the site and get that uh book, Intelligent Investors, so you can start the early stages of the framework. JT investor. Hey Tom, what are your thoughts on Dine? They've got Applebee's IHOP and Fuzzy's Taco Shop. Dividend yield is 7%. I don't care about the dividend. That could go away tomorrow. Uh, thanks for your thoughts. Have a nice weekend. Uh, yeah, look, I I am looking in the restaurant space. I think as meat prices come down, a lot of these are going to fly. I think this is going to be one of them, and I think you are spot on here. Let's take a look. Yeah, I mean it's trading in line with its fundamentals have been choppy. The trading has been choppy. Let's just if it lives another day, it's going to figure it out. They got enough scale. So, let's take a look at the balance sheet. Yeah, I think long-term debts a billion. I mean, the the key thing here, what's the free cash flow? 90 million. Yeah, the key here is just to get the debt maturity ladder and uh make sure they don't have too much debt coming due too soon. But if if they if it's laded out and they refinanced a lot during COVID, uh I think this is a great play. So uh that's the qualification. Uh you got to listen to the calls, start to do your work. Uh I wouldn't buy it on that information, but I would definitely say uh you are on the right track. Let's just make sure management didn't screw everyone during co No, no. I like I like everything about this idea. JT investor, good job. Uh Marcel Bala, thank you for your weekly market updates opinion on Garish Shimer. They manufacture and sell plastic and glass vials and tubes for the medical industry. Yeah, their margins have gotten crushed. So, and their free cash flow is negative. I'm going to pass on this one. You You really got to listen in and um listen to the turnaround story and really believe it. But until I see signs of the free cash flow turning, I'm not interested on something like that. Uh BJP, thoughts on DXCM? All these guys with the fake names? They're money managers. I can guarantee you. Uh DXCM. But you know what? We're grateful to have you and pay it forward. You know, if you're getting helped by this, help other people that could benefit. Um, DXCM. This is uh, medical device company. Yeah, glucose. This is diabetes. So, these have been all left for dead because of GLP1s. Uh, I kind of like the idea. Let's just see. I just don't think there's like enough juice in it for me to get excited. Everything has to go right for me to get a double. And I don't like that. I I like I like being wrong and getting a double because the margin of safety is so great. But let's just take a quick look. Uh DXCM I I just don't I don't think your upside is big enough commensurate with the risk. Let me just see the balance sheet real quick. But I do think it'll work. Yeah, I think I think you're probably fine with that. Uh I it's just not highest and best use for us. Okay. Uh, Patrick Kelly, thanks for the great content. Uh, look forward to watching the podcast on Thursday night. Shared it with friends and family. Thank you very much. Uh, yeah, I could. Yeah, I could have Brendan back on. Uh, we'll see. Uh, I know you aren't crazy about the oil producers that and that you are happy with your energy exposure with uh, NOVV and CRK, but would you mind taking a look at NOG? They had some bad management back in the day, but I looked at their stock again. It seems interesting. All right, let's have a look. Look for Patrick Kelly, my Italian pa over there. All right. N O G. No, no. Look, it's up 20 10x off the bottom. It's still free cash flow negative. Revenues have been flat for two years. Uh, no, no, no, no. But thank you. I mean, it doesn't mean it won't go up 20% or 30%, but it's like, uh, no. But thank you for the look. And by the way, let me just show you something here, partner on N OG. Uh, management are still scumbags. So, management has not gotten better. They've doubled the share count in the last 5 years. Um, that's no. No bueno. Okay. Grayson H. NIS iOS. I think we looked at this a few times. Let's just take a look for Grayson. What do they do? Web presence and productivity cloud solutions. Adtech. Uh, uh, not for us. Unless you're damn certain about their moat. Like, I don't think you got enough margin of safety to get a double or triple. Uh, Jackson, thanks for letting me retire with confidence. Thanks for the position notifications. How about another quick peek at Tillray? Uh, they've got Sweetwater, Shock Top, Breen Ridge, Core Product, THC. Yeah, I mean, I I don't really get ideological about things. You know, we own Dagio, but this is not the stuff that I really want to uh be involved with. Um, but let's take a look. I mean, this is unbelievable. The stock's down from 300 to a buck. Um, let's take a look here. I'm going to try to be patient with this one, Jackson, because you know I love you. But, uh, this is a bag of Uh, not for me. I I don't like anything about it, but I do know you're a super smart guy and you've sent in a ton of great AMAs before and I know why you're looking at it because it's down so much and it's rebounded a bunch. Uh I I I just I wish I could tell you I love this one, buddy, but I don't. So, um, taking the share count from 200 million to a billion. There's a special place in hell for management like these like this opinion, not advice. God bless them. I wish them luck. We will have nothing to do with that. Okta, next week we're going to do a session called Tell Me How You Really Feel. All right, Octa. Okta. All right. What do these guys do? So, it was a COVID darling broken stock. kind of went through this process. Um problem with this I think auction service used to manage secure identities such as single scionications cloud premises adaptive multi authentication I mean look I the numbers look good on this I'm not going to lie uh you probably could get a double or triple on this you just better be damn sure that they're bestin-class and um security capabilities company like this gets one breach and like the stock is just smashed and the way that the enemies are accelerating and accelerating. Uh and you know this was a growth company that hasn't grown in a bunch. Uh let's see what they did here. I'm sure I don't sure the balance sheet's good. Total debt 940 million cash. Yeah, balance sheets's great. I don't know how you can have such a low return on invested capital on a effing software business, but okay. Um, got to work overtime for that. Yeah, management keeps giving themselves shares like pigs. Uh, yeah, I'm going to pass. I think it'll work for you, Johnny, but um not for me. Lachlan, thoughts on target. We like it. We've covered that one a few times. Uh GGT. Yeah, I like this. I like it. Good job, Lachlan. Welcome, Dom Monaco. Under Armour. Don't like it. covered it every week for the last 10 weeks. No thank you and it'll probably work as a trade and you'll probably make some money, but I think it's it's it's done. Uh Mike, not done like out of business, but just look if if if Steph Curry and Tom Brady can't sell sneakers for you, you're you're you're effing toast. Like I mean, what do they need next? Taylor Swift selling t-shirts for them and they still can't get out of their way. It's not going to happen. Mike, see the difference between Vans and Under Armour is Vans is culturally embedded in our DNA. It's been around since the 60s. Uh it's the Lindy effect. The longer something's been in existence, the light longer likelihood it has of remaining in existence. Whereas Under Armour was a Johnny come lately. When that guy was at the top of his game, there probably wasn't a better CEO. So then he started buying vineyards and horses and and he's just he's he's checked out, man. I mean, he can't he was a one- hit wonder. He made a lot of money and that's it. It's not coming back. I mean, maybe he can pull a rabbit out of his hat and I'm I'll be happy to be wrong. I'd love to see people succeed, but I'm not going to bet on it. Crispy Cream Donuts. This is a stock that as great as their product is, it's not going to work. I mean, this thing should just be taken. This will bounce. I mean, just take it private. put it out of its misery. I don't understand why they keep playing games with that thing. Alex, uh, watch the show every week. What's your thoughts on Shutter Stock? This is one that I've never understood. And if I recall, well, there you go. It's down 90% now. It's starting to make a recovery. Let's see. SSTK. I don't know what the mode is for this business, but nah, not for me. It'll bounce. It's a technical bounce. It's fine, but I I don't want to be involved. TimD Humana, thoughts on the selloff. Um, this is interesting. Yeah, I like this. I I've looked at it. Uh, it's so funny. How is your Never mind. I will say the name you entered in the contact form is a lot different than the name in your email address, but I'll leave it at that. Human is fine. Uh Frankie McBride, what are you guys so scared of, man? Anyway, Rob Sarnitaro, congrats on your daughter's aquatic accomplishments. They apparently have incorporated your work ethic into their lives. Thank you very much. Uh they're doing it on their own. this is this is their deal. Um, and if it wasn't their deal, we wouldn't be out here. Uh, several months ago, you asked me anything in the interview about EFT. Uh, said not interested. Are you interested in now? Euronet services. 6 billion billion. I I think this is going to again continue to fall in the not enough margin of safety bucket. I think it'll probably work okay, but it's not going to be a double anytime soon. So, I can't lower my desired IRRa to have a good company in place of a great company. Root Insurance. This is from Hank Douglas. Uh, hi Tom. As always, appreciate you sharing your views. I do my best to put out to friends and family on the podcast uh as I've gotten tons of value. Thank you. Very kind. Um appreciate it. That's how this thing grows and that's why we keep doing it. Uh root. So this thing's already up 50x off the lows, consolidating a little bit. Uh you know, if you're around, you never know what's lurking in insurance companies, especially ones that are subscale. I turn free cash flow positive. The revenues are growing again. It I think a lot of that's priced. What do they do? Just a specialty PNC automobile and renters insurance. Columbus, Ohio. I think most of the juice has been squeezed. My friend, you're late to the party. And uh yeah, share count's up 9x in six years. What a bunch of scumbags. All right. Uh no thanks. All right. Next. Jacob M love the pod. The friend I show this to follows your stock picks. Anyway, I'm not interested. By the way, go to hedge funips.com. Click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Talk to your psychic and financial adviser before doing anything. Uh, I was looking at range resources. Appalachia play seemingly positive massive inventory. Wanted to hear your take. Our take is, we've covered this one many times. Um, we bought this in uh I think it was 2018. Yeah, we bought it in 2018 at about 11 bucks. This is off. It shot up to 18 immediately. We thought we were geniuses. Then COVID came. It dropped to a buck 60 and change. I don't know why this data changes, but it was a buck 60. Uh we brought our we bought every share we could buy during COVID. We brought our basis down to $410. Uh it's up to 35. It's going higher. So, uh no change in that, but um so we like it, but you know, again, most you know, you're you're coming to the party at 1:00 a.m. when all the you know, good-looking ladies have gone home. I mean, you know, can it double again from here? Yeah. Uh but, you know, it's up 7x. So, I'd be more focused on something like Commtock that's earlier in its ascent. Robert, why? Yeah. So, Robert's giving me a big pitch on Bed Bath and Beyond or Bath and Body Works. Same By although Bed Bath and Beyond is Lona's thing now, and he just basically brought the the licensing, which I like. Actually, I do like his this is I don't like the old one. Uh Bed Bath and Body Works. I don't like this business. It's It's just not You're better off with LVMH and get uh Sephora for free or Estee Lauder. Um I mean the revenues and free cash flow have been flat forever. So the stock's down a little bit off COVID highs. It probably does bounce from here. I just I think it's just it's not highest and best use, my man. I mean, maybe you'll get a double out of this. Um, let me just see something here. Yeah. So, they're bringing share count down. The revenues haven't grown. It's okay. I I don't I don't like that. I It's not It's not the highest and best use. It's probably okay. You probably can make a double, but it's it's uh it's it's not a great business. Uh I like the broader. All right. So uh Bill C is asking about longtime listener noticed medical device industry is lagged the broader healthcare and biotech recovery this year. Uh you know should I uh relevant ETI market cap weighted and XH oversold? I think this could be the next catchup trade in healthcare. looking to rotate some of my XBI winnings into these beaten up names. I think it's early to get fully out of XBI. Um, but I do think you're right. I wouldn't do it at the expense of uh XBI. I would do it in addition to it. Wait. I hi and I'd probably go equal weighted. But I wouldn't do either of those. I own back I don't companies. I'd buy companies with the highest upside. That's like a sleepy maybe you make 50% but uh we're not in for that. So we like Baxter. All right. Libby. No, that's not a question. That's a spam. Sam S. Bristol Myers. Um, I like Fizer better. I like Fizer better. Let's just put it that way. This one's probably fine, too. I like a lot of these. I've been looking at a lot of these. It's okay. Side of the pipeline. I think it's going to be harder to get a double in this than in Fizer. Check out Fizer's pipeline. Chief scientific officer. A lot of interesting things. All right, let be Eric Carmax. We covered that. Don't like it. Don't like that business. I mean, all right, I'll look now. Now you know why. But that's you know at at some price a lot of things become attractive. I still don't like it. No pass. Thank you. I get it. It's down. Maybe get a trader bounce. I I don't like the business long term. QBT as a short. This is one of those meme stocks. Quantum computing. Now, I would I wouldn't these have nothing to do with fundamental. You're right on fundamentals. I don't don't get naked short on on stuff. There's a way to No, just find good businesses, buy them, double and triple your money, rinse and repeat. You don't have to play this these silly reindeer games. Okay. Um, love the banter. Uh, this is from Tino Langford. Highlight of my week. Thank you. Love the banter, direct honesty, and informative content. What do you think of Tate H. Tate and Lyall? I think we covered this last week. Let's just take a look at the balance sheet here. 1.4 4 billion. So they've added a lot of debt. You got to see when this matures. What's the cash flow like? Okay. It's got some uh snapshots. Oh, ingredients for food beverages. I prefer international fragrances and flavors. Um, figure out why this is broken, but I think it's kind of interesting. I'd probably rather play IFFF than this. And uh, you're the goat. Thank you for that kind word. Uh, Buffett is the goat. Uh, and never will be another Buffett. So, just leave it there. Uh, you mentioned wanting a restaurant play and previously turned down Portillos. They just hit a 52- week low. Search of a new CEO. Any chance you get a look? PTL. Some of these smaller scale are really struggling. Um, I think they'll turn. Uh, I just don't like negative cash flow when they're smaller, unproven, meaning they haven't been public that long, small amount of cash, lot of debt. I think it's I think there's a little risk there, David. I mean, I'm not saying it won't work. If it works, it's going to be a runner, but hasn't hasn't been public enough. Are you buying more BABA at this level? Uh, I don't buy up. I mean, this would have to come down a lot for me to put new money. Um, we buy when things are down. This thing has had a parabolic run just because it pulls back 20 points. Uh, we don't have to. We We already have so much from 82 blended basis. Why, you know, I mean, maybe I'd put some new money to work at 150, but like there are higher and better uses. There are doubles and triples. I mean, the time to put money to work was at 60 when Rema Kapadia at Baronss was writing 135 negative articles about China consecutively every single week. Um, so you know, now it's up three almost 3x from those levels even with the correction. Uh, it's going to go a lot higher, but that's not where we put new money in. you know, we put new money in those things we believe are just leaving the station, not the ones that are already uh moved a lot that are still going to move, but the rate of return is going to change from this point forward from from what it did um you know in the previous year. So, we want to get them the maximum rate of return forward. Uh Max Hughes, could you take a look at Noble Court, please? any. But to answer your question, um, you know, everyone, if you've been following along, we sold the options at 6x on a on average. We could have gotten 7x, but we didn't want to be pigs, and we were right about that. Um, as for the shares, we're long-term holders, so there's nothing to nothing to talk about there. Um, what are we talking about here? We're talking about any Noble Uh, this is just a solveny thing. Probably okay. Not highest and best use. It's a lower quality business. It been bankrupt once before. I'm pretty sure I'd pass Elron Carney been following you since the very beginning. Wow. Thank you, Elron. That's pretty awesome. Six years, 300 plus episodes. Number one in the hedge fund category. Okay. Uh Pagaya. So, this thing's already 6x off the bottom. It's pulled back a little bit. PGY free cash flow is recovering. AI powered technology financial. I I don't know what their mode is. I'm going to say no just because it's had this huge move already off the bottom. I know it's pulled back a little bit, but it's up 6x now. It's pulled back a hair. I I don't I don't love it because I can't understand what their mode is. It's a software company and all that software stuff can be disintermediated by AI. Um, if you're dying to buy a software company and want to gamble whether they get disintermediated or not, buy Adobe. Thanks for looking the other day on UPS. They total ju just lost my package. Uh, R YN, it's a wholesale insurance broker for ENS excess and surplus market. some insider buying. All right, let's take a look. Wait. R. Sorry. I don't I mean I don't think it's pulled back enough, Jason. It looks okay. I think you probably make some money with it. It's a little broken. I I It's not exciting for me yet. 35 or 40. I'll take another look. It may never get there. I see UI. I think we covered this one, Lewis, in recent weeks, but let's just take a look because it's healthcare. Yeah, I think this is going to take a little longer than you think, but um probably okay. 300 million receivables 159 1.3 billion What's the cash flow situation? 60 million. Ah, it's a little levered for my style. This needs to come down a lot more before I get excited and I don't know that it will. I think you're probably right pretty much there, Lewis. I mean, certainly below 100, I think you can start aggressively doing your research, but um I think you're right and I just think it's going to take a lot longer. So you could have dead money for three years. That's that's what I'd be worried about is the opportunity cost of capital. Lithium America's This is This is a meme stock. We don't even cover this kind of stuff, David. So I'm going to just pass. Play Albamaro. That's the one. I mean, I know it's gone up a lot since we talked about it on this podcast, but it's got a long way to go. It's just getting started. This one, it's going to take a few years. This is going to be work its way up to new highs over time. Aisha Aisha is asking uh hey Tom thank you for your knowledge and sharing it. It's very clear those that listen for a longer period have accumulated a lot of knowledge to pull from to assess companies and industries very quickly. Apart from time and study of these companies which I'm certain is the most important ingredient. What resources have helped you hone your thinking the most? Uh I covered this. Go to hedge fund tips channel on YouTube and search University of Bristol. I spent an hour telling people what to read and learn to get their foundation. And I think if you do those steps, you're going to be very well ahead of the pack at no more than 99% of active managers. Uh, Wasim, love the podcast. Wasim Hussein, could you look at the company Sky West? Looks great on paper. Okay. S K Y W. Can't understand why it's falling because it's exhausted. It's gone straight up for two years. is a 10bagger and it's probably going to consolidate a lot because that's just what they do. S K YW. Okay. So, what do they do? Regional airline. Okay. Uh take your money and run. Okay. Airlines are cyclical business. If you bought in the hole at 15, take your chips and leave the casino. Do not wait for another free drink. You will get roasted. It will go craps and you will be out of luck. So, count your money. Go see Cirus Olay. Don't ever go back to the casino. Have the best steak you can. Take your money. Airlines are garbage businesses. You buy them in the hole when they look like they're going bankrupt. If you're certain they're not going bankrupt, you make your multibagger and you get the hell out and you never go back. So, well done if you wrote it. If you're buying up here, get the hell out yesterday. Romeo, thanks for everything you do. Started listening to the podcast this year after it was recommended to me by a friend and now I look forward to it every week. Well, welcome Romeo. Thank you. Uh, what are your thoughts on Whirlpool? Good play on new housing builds. Um, yeah, this one we've gotten a hundred times in the last year and we keep looking at it and we keep passing and that's been right so far. At some point it's going to be wrong. I just don't know that it's yet because revenues have shown no signs of recovering. I mean, they're down from 21 billion to 13. So, the business has been cut in half. And guess what? So has the stock. I don't see any recovery yet. When I do, I will get super interested. I'm just not seeing it yet. So keep listening to the conference calls. Keep understanding the turnaround. Go back to the previous eight quarters. Find out what they said, what actually happened relative to what they said. And there will come a time. It just doesn't feel like it's imminent right now. Sahar been listening for four years. You've improved me tremendously as an investor and I can't thank you enough. Well, you're welcome and thank you for listening. Shahar, I appreciate the support. Wondering your thoughts on KSPI. I know you don't take company and country risk, but I think in this case it's just country. KSPI, what are you putting me in here, Shahar? Why are you putting me in here, man? Kazakhstan. Oh my gosh, Kazakhstan. All right, let's see what's happening with Borat and his joint stock company, Very nice, aka Cosby KZ merchants in Kazakhstan and Ukraine. three segments, payments, marketplace, and fintech platform that facilitates transactions among merchants and consumers. I mean, could it get any worse? Talk about All right. Uh, who who the hell underwrote this business? It must have been like Roth Capital or something. All right. Not not throwing arrows here. All right. Kspi. Kspi. Wow. Yeah, I mean look this thing. It is growing like a weed. Very nice. Let's see on cash flow. Very nice. Let's see on uh balance sheet. I think you're right, man. I I think Shahar, I think we are predominantly taking country risk here. I can't recommend it, but I I will be thinking about it. Uh, maybe I could do a little more work on it, but um I think it's a decent find. I I think what's really cool is if they got some resolution with Ukraine, you get a free Ukraine pop. Uh, I can't take that company risk, but it's interesting. So, kudos to you for looking under a lot of rocks. Um, okay. Grayson, what does the bare case for Baba look like? Dude, we covered this a hundred times when everyone was trying to sell it at 60. At 160 or whatever, that horse has left the barn. Kayla Smith, thoughts on Fiserve. Uh, I don't like I I I prefer PayPal. I I love PayPal. Um, I know a lot of people are looking at this. I don't understand this business as well and I think it has to go lower before I get interested. So, we have covered that one a lot. I'm not trying to cut it short. I just think that um there are higher and better uses. This is getting close, but it's not there. My guess is if you ask in two months, I'm going to be more interested. But um It's going it's just going to be very hard to make a double quickly on this is my biggest problem. I think you're generally okay. I mean, even if you bought it and it went to 80 before it went to 180, it's not a big deal, but um uh it's not what I want to focus on right now. Tom Ferrell, put new money to work in E or Etsy now. Both. Grayson H. We did that one already. Make sure that's a new client. New client. Good. We're done. We'll be back next week. Same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
