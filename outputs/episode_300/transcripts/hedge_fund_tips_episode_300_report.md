### July 12, 2024

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish, emphasizing that the market's V-shaped recovery has further to run, particularly in undervalued sectors. He highlights the potential for significant gains in consumer discretionary, energy, and housing-related stocks, driven by deregulation, tax cuts, and a shift in investor sentiment. He introduces National Oil Well Varco (NOV) as a new position, citing its strong fundamentals and potential for a multi-bagger run. He dismisses concerns about the market being overbought, arguing that many stocks have significant upside remaining. He believes that the Fed is behind the curve and that a shadow Fed may be named to lower rates.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Constructive. Hayes believes the market has more room to run, especially in specific sectors. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- V-shaped recoveries tend to push higher than expected.
- Institutions are still behind the curve and need to catch up.
- Pro-business policies are being implemented, including tax cuts and deregulation.
- Corporate and household balance sheets are underleveraged.
- The Fed is artificially keeping rates high.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
Hayes believes that the economy is strong, driven by tax cuts, deregulation, and a shift from geopolitical concerns to growth-oriented policies. He argues that artificially high interest rates are the main impediment to economic growth and that a dovish shadow Fed may be necessary to correct this. He sees potential for significant growth in the housing market and consumer discretionary sectors.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Core CPI | Lower than expectations for the fifth consecutive month. | This strengthens the case for rate cuts. |
| PPI | 0.0 month | This is surprising and puts pressure on the Fed to consider rate cuts. |
| Tariff Revenue | Record $27 billion collected in June. | This shows that tariffs are benefiting the US and contributing to a budget surplus. |
| Household and Corporate Leverage | Near record lows | Indicates potential for credit expansion and economic growth. |
