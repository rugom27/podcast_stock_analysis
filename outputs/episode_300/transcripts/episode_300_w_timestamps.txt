[0.719s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.879s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.759s] 300th videocast podcast for the week
[8.72s] ending July 17th, 2025.
[11.92s] What a 24 hours after uh 3, four full
[14.719s] days in New York non-stop TV. I got on
[18.24s] the plane at 6:00 last night, sat on the
[21.439s] tarmac till 10:15, deplaned us due to
[24.96s] weather. Get a hotel for 3 hours. get up
[28.0s] to get a six o&#39;clock flight, sit on the
[30.08s] tarmac for two hours, uh, get deplaned,
[34.719s] wind up, I get the last standby seat on
[37.92s] a 9:00 a.m. flight. I&#39;m sitting 22 rows
[41.36s] back with my knees over my ears for six
[44.079s] hours. But we got back here to do number
[46.64s] 300, and we&#39;re super excited. Uh, so
[50.239s] let&#39;s get down to it. Uh, family first
[53.6s] as always. Annabelle swam in the LA
[56.719s] invite, which was her first ever senior
[60.0s] open meet racing college kids. She&#39;s 11,
[63.199s] by the way. She also had fun at her
[65.28s] water polo team&#39;s end of season party.
[66.96s] Mimi spent the weekend at her team&#39;s
[69.68s] beach water polo fundraiser where she
[71.84s] earned this year&#39;s coaches award for
[74.56s] 14u.
[76.32s] Then they ended the weekend at the Black
[79.28s] Pink concert featuring Bruno Mars. So,
[83.52s] let&#39;s get those photos up here. That&#39;s
[86.64s] uh her coaches award from Patriot Water
[90.72s] Polo Club. Best in Orange County.
[93.36s] Unbelievable coaching staff there. This
[95.6s] is their end of year party. Uh this is
[98.64s] them at the concert. They got some last
[100.479s] minute tickets there. not uh the type of
[103.759s] tickets I&#39;d be uh excited about, but
[105.92s] they went for it and they they had an
[107.439s] incredible time.
[109.68s] Um and then uh I was in New York, picked
[112.88s] up a pair, went to Vans on Fifth Avenue
[116.399s] in New York as soon as I landed. Uh
[119.36s] picked up the new Skate Curran Kapples.
[122.159s] These shoes are awesome. As a matter of
[123.759s] fact, I&#39;m wearing them. I just literally
[125.84s] got off the plane, so you can see them
[129.28s] here. These things are awesome. You can
[131.039s] wear them dressy, you can wear them
[132.64s] undressy. They&#39;re so comfortable to walk
[134.48s] in like Vans. Wait a second. There we
[137.04s] go. I&#39;m going to figure out how, you
[138.4s] know, maybe after another 300 episodes,
[140.319s] I&#39;ll figure out how to work the camera.
[142.08s] But these are so cool because you can
[143.599s] wear them everywhere. They don&#39;t look
[145.84s] like sneakers, but they&#39;re cool enough
[147.2s] to be sneakers. And I was super excited.
[150.0s] Store was crowded. They got two levels.
[152.319s] Um, that&#39;s at Yahoo Finance Studio. What
[155.92s] else? Oh, this is with Jose Torres, the
[159.28s] chief economist over at Interactive
[161.44s] Brokers. Uh he was on when I was uh um
[166.08s] working with uh Josh Lipton for the
[168.56s] hour. Uh Jose&#39;s a good guy. I&#39;ve spoken
[170.4s] with him at the money show. That&#39;s Fox
[172.16s] and Friends in the background when I was
[173.599s] going inside to do Fox.
[176.08s] That&#39;s the Yahoo studio. More from the
[179.12s] studio. There&#39;s the van store
[180.8s] downstairs. All this was the clothes
[182.8s] section. Some wise guy on Twitter&#39;s
[184.4s] like, &quot;No one&#39;s in the store.&quot; They were
[186.319s] in the store. They were all around the
[187.68s] sneakers. And they&#39;ve got that thing
[189.04s] running like a welloiled machine. I got
[190.959s] to say, I didn&#39;t go in planning to buy
[192.64s] sneakers. They have got a machine there.
[195.12s] Like, you look at sneakers. They&#39;re
[196.4s] like, &quot;Can I help you, sir?&quot; I&#39;m like,
[197.92s] &quot;Uh, yeah. I kind of like these. Let me
[200.4s] try them in a 13 blah blah blah.&quot; He
[202.4s] waits with me. He radios like someone in
[205.2s] the back. They come sprinting out with
[206.8s] the shoes. They lace them up for you.
[209.28s] They&#39;re like, &quot;The mirror&#39;s right there.
[211.12s] You want a photo with it?&quot; blah blah
[212.56s] blah. I was like, &quot;This is great. Let&#39;s
[214.64s] go.&quot; Uh, bring them up to the counter.
[216.4s] You got any socks? I picked up like five
[218.56s] dozen socks. Vans and Dicki socks are
[220.879s] amazing, by the way. I&#39;m just saying.
[222.4s] Uh, VF Corp. Uh, that was with Caroline
[225.44s] Long. Uh, I&#39;m sorry, Caroline Woods, who
[230.08s] sat in for Kristen Scher NYC live. That
[234.879s] was Don Jr. by the way. Um, if you&#39;re
[238.799s] interested at all, uh, I go to get into
[241.84s] the show and security was like,
[246.319s] uh, you got to wait online. There&#39;s like
[247.68s] 400 people online. They weren&#39;t letting
[249.04s] anyone in because of Secret Service. So,
[251.439s] like I went to another cop. I was like,
[253.2s] I&#39;m going live in 5 minutes. Uh, can you
[256.479s] let me in? And then like I finally went
[258.479s] to the third cop. He&#39;s like, oh my gosh,
[260.079s] yeah, go right up to the front. Like
[261.28s] there was, you know, had common sense,
[262.96s] helped me right through. And
[264.32s] fortunately, I was able to do that. But
[265.919s] security was just super tight. That&#39;s
[268.08s] with Diane King Hall over at Schwab
[270.4s] Network. That&#39;s the Schwab booth.
[273.44s] Uh Sha Sam Vadus, who used to do CNBC
[277.28s] Asia, I would go on her show a lot. Uh
[279.6s] she&#39;s now working at Schwab. Her husband
[281.919s] has a job. That&#39;s all. You can see
[283.199s] Secret Service outside with Don and his
[285.36s] his new uh girlfriend or wife or
[287.919s] whatever it is. And um they seem super
[291.68s] happy. All right, so moving right along.
[294.56s] Uh, first on to the media. Want to thank
[297.759s] Christian Dagger,
[300.0s] Payton Jennings, and the great Stuart
[302.24s] Vanney for having me on Tuesday. We&#39;re
[304.72s] going to listen in here.
[305.84s] &gt;&gt; Okay, let&#39;s bring in Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s
[307.36s] watching the market for us this morning.
[308.96s] Uh, what does that rate what does the
[310.96s] CPI mean for a rate cut?
[313.039s] &gt;&gt; I think it means President Trump has uh
[315.6s] proof for his case. This is the fifth
[318.4s] consecutive month that core CPI came in
[321.68s] lower than expectations and both
[323.6s] headline and core are lower than they
[325.68s] were in January and February before the
[328.08s] tariffs came into place. Here&#39;s what&#39;s
[329.68s] going to happen, Stu. If the Fed doesn&#39;t
[331.68s] cut in July, and right now the odds are
[333.36s] they are not going to cut in July, I
[335.36s] think you&#39;re going to see a shadow Fed
[337.52s] named and is going to be a dovish person
[339.6s] and I think the market is going to start
[341.6s] to price in lower rates. Powell will be
[344.8s] a lame duck for the remainder of his
[346.72s] term.
[347.199s] &gt;&gt; Well, that would be a dramatic move,
[348.4s] wouldn&#39;t it?
[348.72s] &gt;&gt; It would be good for the market.
[349.68s] &gt;&gt; A shadow Federal Reserve board issuing
[352.479s] statements about you got to cut rates.
[355.12s] &gt;&gt; All we need is the name of the next Fed
[356.96s] chair and the market will start to
[358.4s] discount an easier Fed.
[360.32s] &gt;&gt; Okay. What? Let&#39;s suppose that we get a
[363.68s] few trade deals coming in. I mean, we
[365.84s] just reported they&#39;re talking up and
[367.199s] down the wazoo today. Uh if we get a
[369.44s] couple of deals in by August the 1st,
[372.08s] what happens to the market? You know,
[373.759s] I&#39;ve been bullish since April, okay?
[375.6s] This is a pessimist nightmare. There are
[378.08s] still a lot of trapped bears. Any good
[380.479s] news is going to push them higher.
[381.52s] Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned in the
[382.479s] business. Two decades, these V-shaped
[384.8s] recoveries, we&#39;re up 25% off the lows in
[387.36s] 3 months. On average, 12 months later,
[390.08s] the market&#39;s up another 22.3%.
[393.039s] That&#39;s every instance since 1950. So,
[395.52s] you can&#39;t be too bearish here. Yes,
[397.6s] we&#39;re overbought, but in V-shaped
[399.68s] recoveries, you tend to stay overbought.
[401.759s] Why? because people got caught off
[403.36s] sides. They&#39;re forced to chase the
[405.36s] indices. They&#39;re going to have to buy
[406.8s] lagards. Every bit of good news,
[408.72s] including earnings expectations are very
[410.479s] low. We saw JP Morgan with very strong
[412.319s] earnings this morning. They&#39;re going to
[413.919s] be forced in. So, I think we push a bit
[415.759s] higher even after this big move. Sue,
[418.88s] &gt;&gt; you&#39;re far too young to have been in
[420.56s] this business for a couple of decades.
[422.24s] &gt;&gt; I started when I was seven.
[424.72s] &gt;&gt; Good one, Tom. You&#39;re all right. Thank
[426.639s] you very much indeed. Coming up,
[428.639s] America&#39;s putting more
[430.56s] &gt;&gt; and we&#39;re back. Then I want to thank
[434.88s] Taylor Riggs, Degan McDow,
[438.479s] Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, and
[443.199s] Madison Murtog, and Cassie Loloff for
[445.68s] having me on the Big Money Show for the
[447.52s] full hour. We had so much fun in this
[450.479s] segment. Uh we&#39;re going to listen in
[452.479s] here.
[455.0s] [Laughter]
[456.43s] [Music]
[459.52s] much too fast.
[465.44s] &gt;&gt; Welcome back into the second hour of the
[467.759s] Big Money Show. I&#39;m Degan McDow along
[470.16s] with my fantabulous co-host and joining
[473.36s] us for this terrific hour, Great Hill
[476.4s] Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. Nice to
[479.28s] see you. Another big win on the economy
[482.639s] for President Trump. tariff cash pouring
[485.28s] in and now the Treasury is flashing a$
[488.08s] 27 billion surplus this for the month of
[492.319s] June. President Trump says America&#39;s
[495.199s] back.
[497.28s] Our country is uh making a lot of money,
[501.28s] a lot of money for the first time in a
[503.28s] long time in decades. We have a country
[505.759s] that was dead was dead. It was a goner
[509.36s] one year ago and now we have the hottest
[512.0s] country in the world.
[514.8s] &gt;&gt; Thomas, how do you see these numbers
[516.8s] that because this is a consumption tax
[519.839s] but better uh small consumption tax that
[524.64s] is borne in large part by exporters from
[528.56s] other countries and then you cut taxes
[530.8s] here at home and create incentive for
[532.72s] work. Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely one is
[535.36s] a surprise uh in the sense that we came
[538.48s] to surplus so quickly. Okay, 27 billion
[541.12s] in surplus. We collected a record 27
[544.56s] billion in tariffs. That&#39;s up 4x. Okay,
[547.92s] and uh they&#39;re expecting over the next
[550.56s] decade $2.8 trillion of collected
[554.0s] tariffs. Uh and then you&#39;ve got the tax
[556.72s] cuts to spur growth at the same time.
[558.399s] And to your point, Dan, I think you
[559.68s] nailed it. It&#39;s not all being borne by
[562.08s] the US consumer. It&#39;s being borne by the
[564.32s] exporters. Why would they be pushing
[565.68s] back if it was all being borne by us?
[567.44s] They&#39;re the last thing the Japanese or
[570.08s] the Chinese or the Europeans are worried
[571.839s] about is uh is the happiness of the US
[574.16s] customer. They&#39;re worried about their
[575.12s] bottom line. And uh and they&#39;re pushing
[576.959s] back hard. And I like the way President
[579.6s] Trump has put these deadlines on because
[582.64s] they know he&#39;s flexible to talk and
[584.399s] negotiate, but they also know that&#39;s a
[585.92s] real deadline. The spot starts and the
[588.16s] tariffs go up on that date. So it&#39;s like
[590.64s] we&#39;re we&#39;re going to talk we&#39;re flexible
[592.48s] flexible we are rational but if you
[595.44s] don&#39;t play you&#39;re going to pay.
[597.68s] &gt;&gt; You know what&#39;s also at a record in the
[599.6s] month of June tax receipts in June were
[603.68s] up 13%. This is even before the big
[606.16s] beautiful bill
[607.44s] &gt;&gt; and outlays were down 7%. So this is
[611.519s] heading in the right direction. What
[612.88s] were you going to say? The only thing is
[614.32s] I I love the CBO just leaves out
[616.88s] interest in that calculation,
[619.12s] &gt;&gt; which is why I loved you when I said
[620.88s] that.
[621.279s] &gt;&gt; That&#39;s
[622.8s] kind of the problem.
[623.92s] &gt;&gt; Couple of things. I think Doge is is
[625.68s] probably going to be more successful
[626.8s] than anticipated. Spending was down part
[628.56s] of the surplus spending was down 187
[630.48s] billion in June. Okay. Two,
[632.399s] productivity. We haven&#39;t had this
[633.839s] acceleration of productivity growth
[635.519s] since the 80s. And if we do get exactly
[637.6s] what Taylor&#39;s talking about, the only
[639.12s] way we&#39;re getting out of 120% debt to
[641.12s] GDP is growth. Okay. Uh so the policies
[644.64s] are in place. We we&#39;ve just gone from,
[646.8s] you know, bombs and tariffs to to now
[649.12s] we&#39;re talking about growth and we have
[650.72s] tax cuts. Wait till we get into massive
[653.36s] deregulation and unleash businesses.
[656.16s] Bonus depreciation in the one big
[658.16s] beautiful bill. That is massive for
[660.32s] large business, but it&#39;s massive for
[662.24s] small businesses. So I I think you&#39;re
[664.399s] going to see animal spirits come back.
[665.839s] If you look at household balance sheets
[668.16s] uh uh in aggregate, if you look at
[670.079s] leverage of S&amp;P 500 companies, it&#39;s near
[673.2s] record lows. There is a lot of credit
[675.36s] expansion can happen. I&#39;ll tell you
[676.64s] what&#39;s gumming up the whole system is
[678.88s] artificially high rates. So when we talk
[681.04s] about a trillion dollars a year of
[682.64s] interest, we could fix that tomorrow. If
[684.8s] a shadow Fed is announced, the market&#39;s
[687.92s] going to start to price in that lower
[690.079s] interest payment and those lower rates.
[692.16s] And I got to tell you, in the 50s when
[694.079s] we were at debt to GDP 120%, we ran
[697.04s] inflation a little bit hot. I got to be
[698.88s] honest with you, 3 to 5%. And you know
[701.44s] what happened? Debt to GDP went from
[704.0s] 120% in 1948 to 63% in 1950.
[708.24s] &gt;&gt; You ratio inflate your
[711.68s] way out of your debt. I love that you
[715.279s] combination.
[716.399s] &gt;&gt; Nominal GDP has to run hot and inflation
[718.56s] a little bit above trend. It just goes
[720.0s] hand in hand.
[721.839s] You want to inflate your way out? I I I
[723.68s] didn&#39;t have that on my bingo card today.
[725.44s] I want a little bit of I didn&#39;t have
[726.72s] that on my bingo cards. I want some
[729.2s] productivity growth. I want some
[730.72s] deregulation. I want some tax cuts. I
[732.72s] want some releveraging of the private
[734.88s] sector. And uh and we can absolutely
[737.12s] rock and roll. Look, we&#39;ve got the
[738.56s] biggest portion of our population, the
[740.48s] millennials, 72 million at perfect age
[743.279s] of productivity, of spending, of
[745.2s] starting new families. This economy can
[747.44s] hum and President Trump is setting the
[749.68s] table for that. What if they can&#39;t get
[751.04s] jobs because of AI? We were just talking
[752.639s] about that in the last hour.
[754.0s] &gt;&gt; Well, there&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s
[755.12s] interesting. There there&#39;s not been a
[757.2s] case yet where a disruptive technology
[760.399s] dis it certainly displaces, but people
[762.72s] go back and new jobs and new industries
[765.12s] are created to service the new
[766.56s] technologies or the freedoms that the
[768.959s] new technologies creates creates new
[770.72s] cottage industries that employ people.
[772.88s] Uh maybe you&#39;ll just be playing golf all
[774.639s] day and the and the golf companies will
[776.24s] do incredible business because
[777.519s] everyone&#39;s playing golf. Nothing to do.
[779.519s] uh you know, but that&#39;s an exaggeration.
[781.76s] The point is is that I don&#39;t think we&#39;re
[784.639s] going to get to a point where we&#39;re
[785.76s] sitting at home watching TV getting
[788.0s] universal basic income because there&#39;s
[789.68s] nothing to do. We&#39;ll figure out
[790.88s] something to do. It&#39;s human nature.
[792.56s] Humans like to grow. They like to be
[794.48s] productive. They like to contribute and
[796.32s] that won&#39;t change anytime soon. My
[798.079s] biggest concern isn&#39;t how technology
[800.399s] because again technology equals
[802.72s] productivity and the AI it will just
[807.6s] change the jobs that people do.
[809.68s] &gt;&gt; That&#39;s right.
[810.48s] &gt;&gt; House&#39;s recent tariff storm, but a fresh
[813.12s] set of earnings this week will be a new
[815.44s] test. We get results from America&#39;s top
[817.76s] banks, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, City, all
[820.32s] tomorrow.
[821.92s] Tom, look, I don&#39;t care what happens to
[824.959s] their trading revenue. I don&#39;t care what
[827.6s] happens to their investment banking
[829.04s] revenue. It&#39;s probably all good. But I
[831.36s] do care what they have to say about the
[832.72s] health of the consumer, the credit
[834.32s] cards, the economy. Um what do you want
[838.0s] to hear from them? And then more
[839.12s] broadly, this earning season, frankly,
[840.8s] to me has felt like it&#39;s been on fire.
[843.199s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh look, the the secret to
[845.36s] happiness is low expectations. And that
[847.36s] that&#39;s what we&#39;re coming into the season
[848.88s] with. Uh expectations were over 9% just
[851.76s] 3 months ago for this quarter. They&#39;re
[853.76s] now down to 4.8%. 8%. So, we don&#39;t have
[857.04s] to jump over the bar. We just have to
[858.56s] step over it. And I think that&#39;s what
[859.92s] you&#39;re going to see with banks. Bank of
[861.76s] America credit card spending data for
[863.839s] June was up. Confidence is back. There
[866.8s] was a lot of, you remember consumer
[868.24s] confidence during April and May. The
[870.16s] consumer was worried. There was
[871.36s] uncertainty. And then there was some
[873.519s] rationality in terms of policy. People&#39;s
[875.68s] confidence came right back. You go to
[877.68s] the restaurants, you see what&#39;s going
[878.959s] on. I think that what we&#39;re going to
[880.8s] see, we saw the stress tests were very
[882.8s] strong. I think we&#39;re going to see
[884.0s] another quarter of beat from the banks
[886.079s] that&#39;s going to kick off the the
[887.92s] thematics for this quarter and uh and
[891.36s] it&#39;s going to come in better than
[892.399s] expected. The key is really going to be
[893.76s] guidance looking forward and I do think
[896.32s] you&#39;re seeing uh CEO and seuite
[899.12s] confidence come back the last couple of
[900.88s] months and you know the thing I&#39;ve
[902.639s] learned in this business is look the
[905.12s] market feels overbought right now. It
[907.44s] feels uh like it&#39;s come a long way in a
[909.76s] short period of time. What I&#39;ve learned
[911.68s] in my career is these Vshaped
[914.24s] recoveries,
[915.76s] the overbought signal signals that are
[918.639s] normal in a regular environment, a
[920.56s] trading range type of environment can
[922.959s] stay extended for a long time coming out
[926.079s] of a V because so many people got caught
[928.16s] off sides at the lows. They are forced
[930.24s] in every new trade deal, every new
[932.079s] earnings report. Uh, and they&#39;ve got to
[934.48s] get that money to work. and where
[936.48s] they&#39;re going to do it to save to catch
[938.079s] up on performance. They got to go for
[939.44s] the lagards, the things that haven&#39;t
[940.959s] moved yet in the second half. And we&#39;re
[942.56s] seeing that the first few weeks of the
[943.76s] second half.
[944.24s] &gt;&gt; Well, I was just talking to somebody who
[945.519s] was saying it was also the retail
[946.959s] investor who really benefited the most
[948.8s] from the lows that we saw liberation
[950.88s] day, but that the institutions didn&#39;t
[952.8s] necessarily get in when they were
[954.16s] supposed to. So, that goes to your point
[956.32s] that if they&#39;re legging in slowly, then
[958.72s] this market has room to run. The same
[960.959s] person was also telling me that he likes
[962.88s] financials right now. And I&#39;m like,
[964.32s] really? looking at Goldman Sachs and JP
[966.24s] Morgan. It&#39;s difficult for me like
[967.759s] that&#39;s like buying Palunteer or Nvidia
[969.839s] at this point. Um do you think there is
[971.6s] still room there?
[973.6s] &gt;&gt; I think there&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the
[974.959s] highest and best use of capital right
[976.72s] now. I do think there is some room. I I
[978.56s] think guidance is going to be okay. I
[980.0s] think deals are coming back. Uh but
[982.32s] they&#39;ve they&#39;ve run a lot. I think you
[983.92s] you hit the nail on the head. So some
[986.56s] underperformers uh in the first half
[988.959s] that I think could could start to see
[990.88s] some bids. consumer cycl uh consumer
[993.6s] discretionary. Okay, people are have
[995.279s] been down on that because consumer has
[997.279s] been uncertainty. I think a lot of those
[998.959s] have gotten beaten up, the Nikes of the
[1001.04s] world, uh even the advanced auto parts
[1003.279s] has doubled off its lows recently. Uh
[1005.839s] and some of those areas that um that are
[1008.56s] also still in a little bit of tariff
[1010.32s] uncertainty as it relates to consumer
[1012.56s] goods, the Lululemons, we don&#39;t own
[1013.92s] Lulu, we don&#39;t own Nike, but we own
[1015.44s] similar type of companies. Uh and I
[1018.0s] think they&#39;re going to start to get bid
[1019.279s] in a material way. I think energy is
[1021.68s] actually there&#39;s some value starting to
[1023.759s] show up in the services. No one wants
[1025.199s] them. And I think finally, even though
[1026.959s] they&#39;re getting hit with some of the
[1028.4s] Medicaid and and uh spend, I think
[1031.199s] healthcare, some some aspects of
[1032.72s] healthcare have really been hit. So, I
[1034.64s] think you want to kind of go towards
[1036.16s] where the puck is going, not where it
[1038.079s] already is. And I think financials and
[1039.679s] tech have had a good run here.
[1041.199s] &gt;&gt; I agree with you, but you explained it
[1042.64s] better than I could.
[1043.679s] &gt;&gt; Brian, what?
[1044.319s] &gt;&gt; I think Dan, you might be spot on. I fly
[1045.919s] United every month uh straight out of
[1047.6s] Orange County to to Newark and I&#39;ve had
[1049.44s] great experiences. So may maybe to your
[1051.36s] point I think the whole the whole basket
[1053.039s] though of airlines has been so beaten
[1054.559s] down. So when you&#39;re buying that you
[1056.4s] kind of want to buy the best balance
[1058.0s] sheets and and the the best financials.
[1060.16s] So Delta still has good financials
[1061.919s] relative to the peers. Uh maybe United
[1065.039s] uh but beyond that you start to get a
[1066.96s] little bit dicey.
[1068.64s] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1068.96s] &gt;&gt; Speaking of financial conditions I did
[1070.64s] want to point out each announcement. So
[1073.28s] maybe things get a little bit tighter,
[1074.72s] but loose financial conditions are,
[1077.36s] &gt;&gt; by the way, it&#39;s so funny when people
[1079.039s] say
[1080.08s] &gt;&gt; if if Powell lowered rates to close to
[1082.72s] the level of inflation, which would be
[1084.4s] neutral, uh it wouldn&#39;t affect mortgages
[1087.679s] because they trade off the 10-year
[1089.039s] yield. That&#39;s completely false. You know
[1090.48s] what game comes back the minute he
[1091.919s] lowers rates?
[1093.2s] &gt;&gt; Fiveyear and sevenyear adjustable arms.
[1095.12s] And that gets everyone back in the game.
[1097.36s] And and it completely changes. You talk
[1099.44s] about productivity, putting people into
[1100.96s] high-paying jobs, middle class jobs, and
[1103.36s] and uh and having what happened in the
[1105.679s] first term of Trump where regular
[1107.44s] everyday people&#39;s real wages went up.
[1110.48s] Main Street did better on a relative
[1112.64s] basis during Trump&#39;s first term uh than
[1116.32s] than we&#39;ve seen in the previous
[1118.32s] administration. We&#39;re going to see it
[1119.52s] again.
[1120.16s] &gt;&gt; Jack Leg Jay, loosen my financial
[1123.2s] conditions.
[1124.559s] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1125.36s] &gt;&gt; Okay. Seriously, I I want just that
[1128.88s] mortgage lower.
[1129.679s] &gt;&gt; Oh, and by the way, all the trapped
[1131.76s] equity in people&#39;s homes, wait till they
[1133.84s] lower rates and you see the HELOC game
[1135.52s] come on.
[1136.48s] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1136.88s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s true.
[1138.4s] &gt;&gt; For that reason, unlike you, why are you
[1141.2s] all talking about interest rate cuts?
[1143.52s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think a couple of things. One is
[1146.88s] you&#39;ve got 16% of GDP is housing related
[1150.4s] and those are the highpaying jobs.
[1152.64s] Number two, the biggest portion of our
[1155.12s] population is the millennials and their
[1157.76s] uh ability to start their lives. Housing
[1160.16s] and family formation has now been
[1161.84s] delayed by five years unnecessarily by
[1164.799s] this policy. And number three, like
[1166.48s] everyone at this table, we pay a lot of
[1168.08s] taxes. Uh and those taxes, $600 billion
[1172.08s] are going into unnecessary interest
[1174.559s] expense determined at the hand of one
[1176.48s] person.
[1176.799s] &gt;&gt; Perspective, that&#39;s not the Fed&#39;s
[1178.559s] mandate. I hear you. I wish we could all
[1181.52s] get a home and a mortgage again for 3%.
[1184.0s] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[1184.64s] &gt;&gt; that&#39;s not what they&#39;re there for.
[1186.16s] &gt;&gt; That&#39;s correct. So, dual mandate,
[1188.64s] maximum employment. Okay, we saw the
[1190.48s] jobs report like Charles was talking
[1192.08s] about, not as great as advertised. Okay.
[1194.799s] And inflation has been low, very, very
[1197.679s] low. So,
[1199.919s] the the real issue is they&#39;re supposed
[1202.4s] to be data dependent by mandate. They&#39;ve
[1205.44s] now shifted in the last 30 days to being
[1208.0s] prediction dependent. Now, this was the
[1210.4s] same guy who said quantitative
[1211.919s] tightening was on autopilot in December
[1214.559s] of 2018. I remember because I was at
[1216.799s] Disneyland and the market was crashing
[1218.4s] 20% in the month of December because
[1220.559s] they didn&#39;t know what he was doing and
[1222.08s] Minutian had to call a meeting of the
[1224.0s] bankers on Sunday to bail him out Sunday
[1226.48s] night and they and they juiced it and
[1228.08s] they turned things around. Uh then he
[1230.48s] did transitory and now he is certain
[1233.2s] because his crystal ball has been so
[1234.799s] big.
[1234.96s] &gt;&gt; Then he cut rates before the election.
[1237.2s] &gt;&gt; Well, there you go. and and and now he&#39;s
[1239.12s] talking about his predictions,
[1240.0s] &gt;&gt; but his predictions are like yours. I
[1241.6s] mean, his predictions are the economy is
[1243.52s] not slowing down enough to justify a
[1245.2s] rate
[1245.44s] &gt;&gt; cut except he talks out of both of his
[1247.52s] mouths because in the summary of
[1248.96s] economic projections, real GDP he&#39;s got
[1252.0s] it 1.4%.
[1254.0s] How can you say that we can&#39;t cut rates
[1256.799s] if if real GDP in their own projections,
[1259.919s] summary of economic projections, last
[1261.6s] meeting, 1.4?
[1263.039s] &gt;&gt; Can I push back again? Yes,
[1265.28s] &gt;&gt; he&#39;s one vote and his vote is no more
[1267.44s] important than any of the other 11
[1269.2s] members.
[1269.84s] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1270.4s] &gt;&gt; Do we hold him to a higher standard
[1272.24s] because he&#39;s Fed chair? What about all
[1273.919s] of the other 120 votes that we talk
[1276.159s] about?
[1276.96s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I look I I think as chairman he
[1280.64s] leads the tenor and it&#39;s and it&#39;s
[1282.799s] incumbent upon him
[1284.559s] &gt;&gt; to present the data that is supportive.
[1287.36s] Look, this lady part of the swamp, Tom.
[1289.679s] &gt;&gt; They&#39;re part of the swamp. And this lady
[1291.039s] who just came on and said, &quot;We&#39;re near
[1292.96s] the neutral rate.&quot; How do you get to
[1294.88s] that math? I could go to my fifth, you
[1297.039s] know, fifth grader and say, &quot;Listen,
[1300.08s] the Fed funds rate is at 425, inflation
[1303.36s] is at 28. Does that look like it&#39;s about
[1305.84s] the same number?&quot; And she&#39;d say, &quot;No,
[1307.52s] that looks pretty far apart.&quot; And I&#39;d
[1308.88s] say, &quot;Well, that then that&#39;s not
[1310.159s] neutral.&quot; And that old dog don&#39;t hunt,
[1312.559s] as they say. Dan probably.
[1314.08s] &gt;&gt; What do you guys think? Well, wait. So,
[1315.36s] I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve never thought I want to
[1317.28s] go to Vegas to play Uno.
[1318.88s] &gt;&gt; I I hate Vegas. They think it&#39;s an
[1320.48s] armpit. I definitely don&#39;t want to go
[1322.08s] there to play.
[1322.559s] &gt;&gt; Well, you just don&#39;t want to go there at
[1323.44s] all.
[1323.6s] &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want to go there at all.
[1324.559s] &gt;&gt; Brian, you&#39;re missing the whole boat. My
[1325.76s] 11-year-old loves Uno. I have yet to
[1329.12s] beat her at Uno. And it will now be an
[1332.0s] excuse to go to Vegas and can say, &quot;Hey,
[1333.919s] we&#39;ll go play Uno together.&quot; And we get
[1336.799s] to teach them at 11 to how to play cards
[1339.2s] for money. I mean that not that but then
[1341.12s] the
[1342.72s] how is she going to take over my
[1343.84s] investing business if she doesn&#39;t
[1345.039s] understand probabilities.
[1346.24s] &gt;&gt; Uno is a great game but if you&#39;re if
[1348.0s] you&#39;re going to Uno in Vegas like how
[1350.08s] could it not be for money? It&#39;s got to
[1351.52s] be for money right
[1353.76s] in Vegas.
[1354.24s] &gt;&gt; All I know is Uno beats old maid any
[1356.24s] day. So I will absolutely go play any
[1359.039s] game not for money. That&#39;s what I&#39;m
[1360.72s] saying. It&#39;s got to be for money. I&#39;ve
[1363.039s] never I don&#39;t know if I have one.
[1365.039s] They&#39;re not getting anywhere.
[1367.2s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that&#39;s the case. And and I
[1368.96s] I will say in my adult life, the one
[1371.919s] period where I felt like Main Street was
[1374.72s] booming and feeling happy was in
[1376.72s] President Trump&#39;s first term. The
[1378.24s] policies people were optimistic, but
[1379.76s] there but it wasn&#39;t just like hope. It
[1381.84s] was their real wages were actually going
[1383.919s] up. And I do think this bonus
[1385.84s] depreciation and I do think the tax is
[1389.2s] not going back up on businesses uh is
[1392.32s] going to recreate that environment and
[1394.32s] is starting to recreate that
[1396.32s] environment. So let&#39;s let&#39;s be hopeful
[1398.32s] these numbers start to improve and we
[1400.32s] move back towards 55 61% and this range
[1404.48s] starts to go up. But again, you need the
[1406.72s] highpaying jobs and that&#39;s what
[1407.919s] President Trump is trying to do with
[1409.6s] reshoring manufacturing with with
[1411.6s] opening up federal lands to build
[1413.2s] houses. Those are major components to
[1415.039s] the economy that have been kind of left
[1416.4s] &gt;&gt; and whatever the definition of middle
[1417.76s] class is, if we&#39;re going to go by the
[1419.28s] Pew definition,
[1419.919s] &gt;&gt; need to start paying your bills.
[1421.36s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that&#39;s personal
[1422.559s] responsibility. But I also think if you
[1424.4s] want equilibrium in the um in the
[1427.36s] education world, allow people to
[1430.159s] discourage their student loans in
[1432.24s] bankruptcy and that will create an
[1433.919s] equilibrium overnight because then the
[1435.76s] pricing will come down. Then it will be
[1438.32s] risk versus return in terms of expecting
[1440.559s] a return on investment for education. Uh
[1443.52s] universities will have to deliver.
[1445.52s] Elizabeth Warren does not like this
[1447.2s] because uh she got paid $400,000 at Yale
[1450.08s] as a as a professor. And you know, if
[1451.76s] you keep the prices inflated and you
[1453.52s] keep the spots on with this subsidized
[1455.919s] lending, you&#39;re going to see tuition
[1457.76s] prices continue to go up. If you let the
[1459.6s] natural market play its course and you
[1461.919s] let that be discouraged, then they&#39;re
[1463.36s] going to have to deliver value for every
[1464.88s] dollar of tuition that you
[1467.2s] &gt;&gt; and we&#39;re back. And then we I got to
[1470.24s] join Josh Lipton for just over an hour
[1472.4s] on Yahoo Finance. We obviously cut these
[1474.96s] all down just to my section, so we&#39;re
[1476.559s] not here uh until tomorrow. So, I wanted
[1479.52s] to thank Josh Lipton and Taylor Cloier
[1482.48s] Smith. Uh we&#39;re listening here.
[1485.039s] &gt;&gt; Ravage is kind of just shrugging this
[1486.799s] off.
[1487.6s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, Trump&#39;s negotiation
[1489.44s] strategy has been punch him in the face
[1491.12s] and then offer them an ice pack and
[1492.559s] they&#39;re grateful for the ice pack. So
[1494.08s] what the market knows is that he goes
[1496.32s] for all and then he when they come to
[1498.559s] the table he talks with them but if they
[1500.799s] don&#39;t respect his deadlines he will pull
[1502.799s] the trigger on on the tariffs which he
[1504.799s] has and we saw that in June 27 billion
[1507.84s] record amount of money into the
[1509.2s] treasuries and we actually ran a budget
[1511.2s] surplus in June to the equivalent tune
[1513.919s] of 27 billion spending went down. So I
[1517.2s] think that uh Trump&#39;s showing a little
[1519.12s] bit of momentum and the market&#39;s
[1520.88s] comfortable that he&#39;s also shown in
[1522.48s] recent months more rationality comes out
[1524.799s] strong and then he backs up into
[1526.799s] something that&#39;s reasonable and the
[1528.08s] markets can digest.
[1529.279s] &gt;&gt; Jared, we got bank earnings on tap. What
[1531.919s] do you expect? Where do you stand on the
[1533.2s] rally?
[1534.159s] &gt;&gt; I think that overbought can remain
[1536.64s] overbought. The one thing I&#39;ve learned
[1538.159s] in this business seeing these Vshaped
[1540.72s] recoveries is that overbought can push
[1544.0s] higher because so many people were
[1545.44s] caught off sides at the lows that uh
[1547.919s] retail was buying the lows, institutions
[1549.84s] now have to play catch-up. And where are
[1551.279s] they going to catch up is those stocks
[1553.12s] that haven&#39;t left the station. So that
[1555.12s] you&#39;re going to see a broadening
[1557.12s] participation uh in not just the MAG 7,
[1560.159s] but broadening out as we&#39;ve seen in the
[1561.84s] beginning parts of the second half. And
[1563.84s] then as it relates to earnings, the
[1565.279s] secret to happiness is low expectations.
[1567.52s] And that&#39;s what what&#39;s happening uh for
[1569.76s] earnings season. Uh estimates for
[1571.679s] earnings growth down to 4.8% from 9.4%.
[1575.6s] So it&#39;s an easy bar. You don&#39;t have to
[1576.96s] jump over it. You can just step over it.
[1579.52s] &gt;&gt; Not a fan. He&#39;s upset. He&#39;s frustrated.
[1581.919s] He thinks the Fed&#39;s late. They should
[1583.44s] have been already cutting. Now you hear
[1585.919s] all this hot talk and chatter, which I&#39;m
[1587.919s] sure you&#39;ve been reading about. The
[1589.36s] Fed&#39;s building renovation. It&#39;s gone
[1592.4s] over. That&#39;s where the focus is at.
[1595.2s] &gt;&gt; It feels like we&#39;ve kind of turned a
[1597.6s] corner here in terms of the heat being
[1599.2s] ratcheted up. Yeah. And I&#39;m just curious
[1601.52s] what you make of that.
[1602.72s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. There&#39;s no question. Look,
[1603.919s] taxpayers like you and me are paying
[1605.52s] $600 billion of extra interest that we
[1607.679s] don&#39;t need to. The rate is not neutral.
[1609.52s] There was a Fed head out today saying
[1610.96s] we&#39;re close to the neutral rate. How I
[1612.48s] mean, I could go to my 11-year-old who&#39;s
[1614.08s] in fifth grade and say, &quot;Our Fed funds
[1616.159s] rate is at 425 and inflation is at 2 and
[1619.36s] change. Does that look neutral to you?&quot;
[1621.12s] and she would say, &quot;No, that looks
[1622.88s] pretty far apart. Like you could drive a
[1624.559s] truck through it.&quot; So, uh, number one,
[1627.039s] we&#39;re paying more than we have to.
[1628.32s] Number two, millennials are getting hurt
[1629.679s] more than anyone else. 72 million people
[1631.279s] in this country trying to start
[1632.4s] families, trying to buy a house, housing
[1634.72s] and family for formation. They&#39;ve been
[1636.64s] delayed by five years. And the only way
[1639.84s] we&#39;re going to get out of this
[1640.72s] situation, 120% debt to GDP, we&#39;re not
[1643.039s] going to cut our way to prosperity. We
[1644.559s] got to grow our way like we did in the
[1646.159s] 50s when we brought inflation uh debt to
[1648.72s] GDP from 120% down to 63%. We ran
[1651.84s] inflation a little bit higher than
[1653.52s] normal 3 to 5%. We ran nominal growth
[1656.64s] much higher and that&#39;s going to be the
[1658.64s] formula moving forward. And that&#39;s why
[1659.84s] the big beautiful bill we&#39;re seeing the
[1661.52s] tax cuts uh accelerated depreciation for
[1664.48s] small business. That&#39;s job creation
[1666.4s] stuff like we saw in the first term uh
[1668.96s] of of Trump. And honestly, Main Street
[1672.0s] did much better during the first term of
[1674.08s] Trump than Wall Street did. And I think
[1676.32s] you&#39;re seeing policies uh you know,
[1678.32s] we&#39;ve gone from, you know, tariffs and
[1680.24s] and war and geopolitical to now tax
[1682.64s] cuts, growth. And the third piece that
[1684.96s] people are awaiting, which is going to
[1686.399s] be huge, is going to be deregulation.
[1688.399s] That&#39;s going to let animal spirits go.
[1690.159s] So what Trump is saying, look, if they
[1692.159s] got to get him out on a technicality,
[1693.679s] did he lie in front of Congress? Did he
[1695.12s] not? The fact of the matter is the
[1696.72s] entire the the only building that they
[1698.399s] redid from the ground up was the FBI
[1700.559s] building that cost less than the overrun
[1703.44s] that cost 700 million bucks. This was
[1705.84s] estimated at 1.8 billion. Now it&#39;s 2.5
[1708.799s] billion. who&#39;s putting some restraints
[1710.96s] on this independent body in
[1713.36s] &gt;&gt; Don&#39;t don&#39;t you think though that when I
[1715.039s] read about this building project which
[1716.559s] has been known for years and the
[1718.24s] overruns are public to me I read this
[1720.159s] and I see okay I see this like this is
[1722.48s] really just about Trump being frustrated
[1725.52s] with all the things you&#39;re laying out
[1727.2s] that he&#39;s not cutting. That&#39;s how I read
[1729.12s] it.
[1729.36s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, 100%. Look, if you got a
[1730.88s] trillion dollars of interest expense and
[1732.24s] it could be 500 billion,
[1734.24s] &gt;&gt; uh, that that&#39;s some serious math. And
[1736.0s] Trump has spent his whole career
[1737.44s] refinancing debt and he likes to do it
[1739.039s] at low rates. So,
[1739.76s] &gt;&gt; he&#39;s a real estate guy. He wants a loan.
[1741.2s] &gt;&gt; And look, the fact of the matter is,
[1742.48s] let&#39;s say Powell&#39;s predict, he&#39;s
[1743.919s] supposed to be data dependent. Now, he&#39;s
[1745.44s] become prediction dependent. Let&#39;s say
[1746.72s] his predictions are correct and
[1748.48s] inflation goes up. It&#39;s much easier to
[1750.48s] to re raise rates by 25 basis points
[1753.279s] than to try to fend off deflation, which
[1756.0s] costs a lot, puts a lot of people out of
[1757.52s] work, a lot of pain. You can&#39;t turn that
[1759.039s] around. You can quell inflation if it
[1760.88s] starts to get away a lot quicker than
[1762.32s] you can do.
[1762.799s] &gt;&gt; Let me let me they tell me I have to go,
[1763.919s] but I I just want one last question. I&#39;m
[1765.679s] curious about your take on this.
[1767.52s] &gt;&gt; There is the assumption, Tom, you know
[1769.679s] this, the assumption and the expectation
[1771.279s] that we have an independent Fed.
[1774.159s] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1774.559s] &gt;&gt; To the extent that that ever became
[1776.64s] really called into question, I&#39;m just
[1779.12s] curious how you think as an investor the
[1781.12s] ripple effects of that would be on the
[1783.279s] dollar, on rates.
[1784.72s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, look, I I think the other
[1786.64s] side of it is people are feeling like J.
[1789.039s] Powell may not be impartial based on his
[1791.679s] actions during different periods of his
[1793.36s] tenure. Uh, and to your point that
[1796.24s] that&#39;s concerning to some people on on
[1798.48s] certain sides. And if it became kind of
[1800.799s] a proxy just for what President Trump
[1802.799s] wanted to do, maybe that would be
[1804.159s] concerning as well. But I think
[1805.52s] consensus is building across the lines.
[1807.84s] People realize that these millennials
[1809.84s] are getting hurt. You know, people if
[1811.44s] you look at people&#39;s, you know,
[1813.039s] insurance bills, if they look at their
[1814.88s] their refinancing rates, if you look at
[1816.72s] the amount of trapped equity in homes,
[1818.64s] people can&#39;t even access through HELOCs
[1820.24s] if they want to build an expansion uh uh
[1822.88s] to, you know, if they&#39;re having another
[1824.24s] kid, they can&#39;t do an addition on their
[1826.0s] house because the cost is too much.
[1827.52s] People are trapped in houses bigger than
[1829.039s] they need if they&#39;re 60 70 because they
[1830.72s] can&#39;t trade from a 3% mortgage to a 7%
[1833.6s] even if they&#39;re taking equity out and
[1834.96s] moving down. This is unnecessary stuff
[1837.12s] from a guy who candidly three times has
[1840.88s] been wrong. Autopilot on quantitative
[1843.12s] tightening crashing the market 20%. Uh
[1845.76s] transitory. So his prediction record is
[1847.919s] not good. And his summary of economic
[1849.76s] projections if he&#39;s so clear inflation
[1851.679s] is going to go up. Why does he have real
[1853.039s] GDP at 1.4%. That old dog don&#39;t hunt.
[1856.64s] You can&#39;t talk out of both sides of your
[1857.919s] mouth. Either we&#39;re we&#39;re going too fast
[1859.76s] and you got to keep rates high or we&#39;re
[1861.76s] going too slow and you got to bring them
[1863.039s] down. And Trump is saying bring them
[1864.559s] down. All right, Tom. Well, we are just
[1866.24s] getting started here on Market
[1867.6s] Domination coming up. Got CPI data
[1869.76s] tomorrow set to show just how hard
[1871.679s] tariffs tail with your expectations.
[1873.6s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think he&#39;s correct. I I think
[1875.279s] you know you could have a short-term
[1876.96s] modest bump, but it rolls over. And by
[1878.96s] the way, the Fed themselves believes
[1880.32s] that if you look at their summary of
[1881.76s] economic projections, they acknowledge
[1883.279s] it&#39;s kind of a one-time tax. But I will
[1885.039s] say if the US consumer was going to eat
[1887.52s] all of those tariffs, why do you think
[1889.679s] the foreign countries are fighting so
[1891.279s] hard against Trump? It&#39;s not because
[1892.72s] they&#39;re concerned about the US consumer
[1894.399s] having a tough time. It&#39;s they&#39;re
[1896.159s] worried about them eating the tariffs.
[1897.919s] Otherwise, they simply wouldn&#39;t care if
[1899.36s] it was all passed through. So, I think
[1901.039s] we need to keep that that in mind. I
[1902.559s] think it&#39;s it&#39;s a balance like Jose
[1904.159s] said. Uh and I think, you know, I&#39;d be
[1906.559s] very interested to to hear what Jose
[1908.24s] thinks about uh the 10-year yield. Jared
[1910.48s] was talking about the 30-year yield
[1912.32s] approaching 5% and kind of what he
[1915.12s] thinks about the impact of Bessant
[1917.36s] working on the 10-year yield with the
[1919.12s] SLR and allowing banks to hold more
[1921.519s] treasuries if he has any thoughts there.
[1923.2s] &gt;&gt; Jose, chime in there.
[1924.24s] &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. I mean, I thought I&#39;ve been
[1925.6s] saying for a while that folks should be
[1927.12s] coming in and buying treasuries. You
[1928.72s] know, the bond vigilantes, I&#39;ve been
[1930.399s] seeing them sort of shift and going into
[1932.96s] more.
[1933.36s] &gt;&gt; They see the shift to online as
[1934.88s] structural and one that is difficult to
[1936.96s] address under Proctor&#39;s current
[1938.96s] organization. at least in the short
[1940.799s] term.
[1941.6s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, they&#39;ll figure it out. They&#39;ve got
[1943.12s] brand modes. Uh but the problem is it&#39;s
[1945.519s] got low singledigit growth and it&#39;s
[1947.44s] trading at, you know, mid20s multiple
[1949.2s] forward earnings. So, it&#39;s a little bit
[1950.88s] ahead of itself. I will say a lot of the
[1952.96s] defensives have been beaten down.
[1954.64s] Proctor is not one of them. So, for me
[1956.399s] to put new money to work on this
[1958.08s] downgrade, it&#39;s not that attractive in
[1959.919s] terms of price is what you pay, value is
[1961.44s] what you get. I think that uh it&#39;s it
[1964.559s] will recover. It will be fine, but it&#39;s
[1966.48s] kind of already priced out in at these
[1968.0s] levels. So I I&#39;m a pass on that.
[1969.36s] &gt;&gt; A pass on that. Let&#39;s check in on
[1970.72s] another one. That&#39;d be shares of Rivian
[1972.399s] riding lower today on the back of a
[1974.159s] downgrade to neutral from buy at
[1975.679s] Guggenheim. Also removed its price
[1977.76s] target on the EV maker. The analysts
[1979.12s] there saying the EV incentive changes
[1981.519s] have both near and long-term
[1983.12s] implications. So Guggenheim downgrades
[1985.76s] this one to neutral. Uh they talk about
[1988.32s] Tom softer long-term R2 R3 assumptions
[1991.2s] driven by both softer R1 sales. They
[1993.919s] talk about negative US EV and emission
[1995.919s] policy changes. just how do you see this
[1997.519s] one?
[1997.84s] &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t buy this with your money.
[1999.919s] &gt;&gt; Wow, that doesn&#39;t sound like
[2001.6s] &gt;&gt; I&#39;ll tell you, look, I I think at the
[2003.36s] end of the day, uh it&#39;s going to be
[2005.519s] Tesla and the rest as it relates to the
[2007.36s] EV world. Uh and Rivian&#39;s just not part
[2010.48s] of that equation. Yes, if you&#39;re in the
[2011.84s] Hamptons and you don&#39;t want to drive
[2013.12s] around in a Tesla, you&#39;re driving around
[2014.72s] in a Rivian, but they haven&#39;t changed
[2015.919s] the model. They got the model right
[2017.039s] originally, but it&#39;s getting a little
[2018.559s] stale, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve got the
[2019.84s] money for the refresh. Uh EV incentives
[2022.559s] going away, subsidized market going away
[2024.159s] in the US, too much competition with
[2025.679s] China if they want to be outside of the
[2027.12s] US. Um not a good outlook.
[2029.84s] &gt;&gt; They say we no longer have confidence in
[2031.679s] the required volumes and or required
[2033.919s] ASPs to support our prior price target.
[2037.2s] Referring there to average selling
[2038.64s] price. The stock is down about 5% this
[2040.72s] year, but most on the street, it looks
[2042.64s] like Guggenheim, they&#39;re they&#39;re most at
[2044.32s] a hold here. All right. Finally, Melius
[2046.32s] Research initiating coverage on
[2047.679s] Starbucks with a sell rating and an $80
[2050.639s] target price implying 16% downside from
[2053.2s] the current price. Melius pointing out
[2054.879s] the competitive intensity that Starbucks
[2057.359s] faces. So, initi, you know, you don&#39;t a
[2059.52s] lot of times initiating a a sell. You
[2062.079s] don&#39;t find that very often, but they go
[2063.599s] out there with this. They say avoid this
[2065.2s] one.
[2066.0s] &gt;&gt; Of these three, this would be the one
[2067.599s] that I hope they keep downgrading so I
[2069.28s] can buy some shares.
[2070.399s] &gt;&gt; Why? Uh, it&#39;s a high quality business,
[2072.399s] durable mode, every corner,
[2074.0s] predictability, all the factors you want
[2076.079s] in a durable growing business. Yes,
[2078.32s] they&#39;ve had competition abroad. They&#39;ve
[2079.919s] had competition here. They had some bad
[2081.919s] execution, but at the end of the day,
[2083.359s] every time I pass a Starbucks, the
[2084.8s] 11-year-old and 13-year-old daughter
[2086.32s] want to stop. So,
[2087.76s] &gt;&gt; let me ask you this, turnaround time.
[2089.119s] Here&#39;s how they put it, right? They say
[2090.639s] listen they acknowledge coffee leader
[2092.96s] global coffee leader they said but the
[2094.72s] road to oper operational consistency
[2097.44s] brand revitalization longer and harder
[2100.079s] than consensus expects a turnaround they
[2102.64s] said is underway but not yet proven and
[2105.599s] execution risk is high on this one.
[2107.92s] &gt;&gt; I like that and I like it lower. I
[2109.92s] wouldn&#39;t be a buyer here. Uh but if they
[2112.16s] keep downgrading it on the sell side for
[2113.92s] another few months, it&#39;s going to get
[2115.04s] low enough that I&#39;m going to get
[2116.079s] interested.
[2116.64s] &gt;&gt; All right, we&#39;ll have you back when you
[2118.0s] do. And Tom, you know, Starbucks
[2119.76s] currently undergoing a turnaround
[2121.119s] strategy as we were just discussing in
[2122.48s] the world of turnaround stories. Tom,
[2124.48s] you&#39;re looking at certain plays that
[2125.92s] have you deem it worth keeping an eye
[2127.68s] on. So, let&#39;s go through some of those.
[2129.52s] &gt;&gt; Well, these I mean, these are all
[2131.04s] companies that we own. I mean, uh we
[2133.04s] came out publicly talking lately about
[2135.44s] uh advanced auto parts. Okay, this is
[2137.599s] something that you couldn&#39;t give away
[2138.8s] just a couple of months ago. Got
[2140.88s] hammered on the tariffs. Well, first
[2142.48s] off, it got hammered on COVID,
[2144.24s] overstock, detock, poorly run. O O&#39;R
[2146.8s] O&#39;Reilly ate their lunch, stock down 80s
[2148.64s] something percent. Uh, so we started
[2150.64s] building a position and we like this
[2152.56s] because we bet on jockeyies with
[2153.92s] turnaround. So, uh, Shane O Kelly came
[2156.32s] from HD Supply, 7 billion business. He
[2159.28s] sold off the Canada business, delevered
[2161.28s] the balance sheet, closed the
[2162.56s] unprofitable stores on the West Coast
[2164.16s] that were too spread out, so they
[2165.44s] couldn&#39;t get economies of scale. And now
[2167.599s] he&#39;s cleaned up the mess. And he&#39;s back
[2169.359s] into expansion, opening a hundred new
[2171.2s] stores in the next three years, all in
[2173.359s] markets where they are number one and
[2175.52s] number two so that they can consolidate
[2177.52s] distribution centers, serve the customer
[2179.119s] faster, and it&#39;s already working. This
[2180.88s] thing&#39;s already doubled from 30 to 60.
[2182.8s] By the way, he&#39;s targeting high
[2184.4s] singledigit margins by the end of 2027,
[2187.2s] early 2028. Last time they had those
[2189.119s] margins, the stock traded 150. It&#39;s
[2191.52s] still only at 60.
[2192.64s] &gt;&gt; As you noted, there&#39;s been a nice move
[2194.079s] in the stock. I&#39;m just It is now up
[2196.0s] about 30% this year, but you I mean
[2198.72s] you&#39;re obviously saying valuation still
[2200.0s] attractive.
[2200.48s] &gt;&gt; This thing just gets just getting
[2202.079s] started. If it pulls back five bucks,
[2203.599s] I&#39;d be a buyer here if you if you don&#39;t
[2205.119s] have a position. But uh this Shane Shane
[2209.04s] O Kelly has a proven track record. He
[2210.88s] knows exactly what he&#39;s doing and he&#39;s
[2212.4s] doing everything he said he was going to
[2214.56s] do uh just in the short while that he&#39;s
[2216.72s] taken the helm. And uh very very very
[2219.119s] promising uh for for the plan. And uh
[2222.72s] and the and the last one um is a brand
[2226.079s] new one which is National Well, it used
[2228.8s] to be called National Oil Well Arco. And
[2230.48s] the reason I&#39;m bringing that up for NOV,
[2232.0s] Inc. is because it&#39;s the cheapest it&#39;s
[2233.76s] been since back when it was called that
[2235.599s] in 2001 through 2007. It it was uh at
[2240.16s] these levels right before it had a
[2241.44s] 10bagger. So this is a
[2242.8s] &gt;&gt; And why is it cheap, Tom?
[2244.24s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it&#39;s cheap because uh number
[2246.24s] one, they got flushed out after 2018
[2248.96s] with all the fracking etc. the demand
[2250.72s] for rigs, technology&#39;s gotten better.
[2252.8s] Uh, however, I think we&#39;re at a point
[2256.16s] with positive energy policy. As rates
[2260.079s] come down, it will become economic to
[2262.64s] drill more at lower prices, and they&#39;re
[2265.28s] going to be the beneficiary. They&#39;ve
[2266.48s] got, you know, they they&#39;re they&#39;re an
[2267.839s] OEM of onshore and offshoring drilling
[2270.56s] rigs. They have the highest install
[2272.0s] base. They&#39;ve got 50% share, and it&#39;s
[2274.48s] trading like it&#39;s going out of business.
[2275.68s] It&#39;s not going out of business. They
[2276.64s] generated over a billion dollars of free
[2278.48s] cash flow last year. They got a great
[2280.16s] balance sheet, billion plus of cash,
[2281.92s] billion of debt. And so if you believe
[2284.079s] that we&#39;re going to uh energy policy is
[2286.32s] going to be favorable the next few
[2287.44s] years, we&#39;re going to have more
[2288.32s] production. They&#39;re going to be great
[2289.359s] beneficiaries. And they&#39;ve got the
[2291.2s] largest install base for the aftermarket
[2293.359s] servicing. So even if you get uh
[2295.119s] fluctuations in energy price at these
[2297.76s] levels, uh with that install base,
[2299.599s] they&#39;re going to be less affected. And
[2301.28s] if you get any positive outcome in drill
[2303.92s] rigs increasing, which we&#39;re kind of at
[2305.44s] a trough right now, that&#39;s why I like to
[2306.88s] buy things. We talked about Albero last
[2308.56s] time. that&#39;s moved up 20 points since uh
[2311.2s] then this is a safer way to play it in
[2313.68s] terms of good balance sheet less price
[2316.48s] risk than buying um uh you know oil and
[2320.64s] gas type of company. They&#39;re kind of
[2323.68s] picks and shovels and I like picks and
[2325.359s] shovels plays versus being fully at the
[2328.32s] effect of the underlying commodity
[2330.24s] price. It&#39;s Can I just ask you about the
[2331.92s] drill baby drill mantra? Because I&#39;ve
[2334.0s] had any number of very smart energy
[2336.88s] analysts come out and I always ask him
[2338.48s] about it and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve yet to
[2340.24s] find one who says it&#39;s going to happen.
[2342.0s] They all tell me, Josh, I realize it&#39;s a
[2344.48s] Trump mantra. It&#39;s a GOP mantra. It&#39;s
[2347.119s] not going to happen. Not with WTI at
[2349.2s] these levels.
[2350.16s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you have to look at the
[2352.0s] equation. So if if we if Trump is
[2355.119s] effective in either announcing a shadow
[2357.52s] Fed or the Fed actually cuts two three
[2359.599s] times this year and rates go lower that
[2362.24s] the economics of that decision and the
[2364.72s] planning become completely different.
[2366.24s] But when you have rates up here, why
[2368.079s] would you drill at $60? But if your cost
[2370.0s] of capital comes down by a third, if
[2372.16s] rates come down, you know, 150 basis
[2374.56s] points, 125 basis points, you can drill
[2377.04s] profitably at 65. And and that&#39;s what
[2379.2s] they&#39;re here to do. And by the way, in
[2380.56s] the meantime, you get a 4.1% dividend
[2382.48s] yield while you wait. So, uh, I like it
[2385.359s] at these levels because my downside is
[2387.68s] pretty well protected because they got a
[2389.359s] healthy balance sheet. Uh, they&#39;re free
[2391.28s] cash flow generative. And my upside, if
[2393.119s] we catch a cycle like we did in the
[2394.72s] early 2000, and I think there are a lot
[2396.16s] of similarities to that cycle as it
[2397.68s] relates to commodities, weaker dollar,
[2399.92s] etc., uh, and economic growth, that this
[2401.92s] thing could be a multi-bagger over the
[2403.44s] next three to five years.
[2404.32s] &gt;&gt; I want to end on on one final name,
[2406.0s] Canada Goose. Explain why that one&#39;s a
[2407.52s] bite.
[2408.16s] &gt;&gt; Okay. You&#39;re you&#39;re not going to believe
[2410.0s] it. Stock&#39;s still down 80%. It was one
[2411.599s] of these COVID stories. They overstock
[2413.76s] blah blah blah. Okay. Uh they moved.
[2416.48s] They&#39;ve got record free cash flow,
[2418.96s] record revenues, record margins. Stock
[2421.52s] is still down 80% off the co peaks.
[2423.76s] Okay. So, I play these divergences.
[2425.44s] Familyrun business, second generation.
[2428.0s] They own 39.5% of the stock. They&#39;re
[2430.32s] turning around. Here&#39;s how they&#39;re doing
[2431.44s] it. Cutting out the wholesale business,
[2433.44s] which was low margin, going DTC, 74
[2435.839s] beautiful stores. You know, the one on
[2437.119s] Fifth Avenue. Uh those margins are up.
[2439.68s] Margins are up to 71% and it&#39;s no longer
[2442.24s] just Parker&#39;s. Drake is yesterday&#39;s
[2444.16s] news. He used to wear it. Uh they&#39;ve got
[2446.32s] raincoats. They&#39;ve got eyewear. They&#39;ve
[2447.92s] got footwear. They&#39;ve got t-shirts. Uh
[2450.16s] and uh and it&#39;s affordable. So it&#39;s not
[2452.24s] just the people that can afford a $900
[2453.599s] or $1,500 jacket. It&#39;s someone that
[2455.44s] says, &quot;I want a Canada Goose uh t-shirt
[2457.92s] for $50. I want the hat for $75.&quot; And it
[2461.04s] becomes affordable luxury like some of
[2462.88s] the other brands. You go into Tiffany&#39;s,
[2464.72s] you got stuff at, you know, 500 grand
[2467.119s] and you have stuff at $300. You can get
[2469.28s] a bracelet for your daughter.
[2470.48s] &gt;&gt; You mentioned the stock. I mean,
[2472.0s] relative co. It has though more
[2473.92s] recently. This year, it&#39;s had a nice pop
[2475.44s] already. You say stick with it though,
[2477.28s] Tom.
[2477.68s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look, I mean, we&#39;ve got a much
[2479.2s] lower basis, but this is early days. I
[2481.839s] mean, the stock was up again down 80%
[2485.599s] and and now cash flow is higher than it
[2487.839s] was than it was at those levels. So when
[2490.48s] you play those divergences, in the short
[2492.56s] term, the market is a voting machine
[2494.319s] based on emotions. That&#39;s what you&#39;re
[2496.079s] seeing right now. It&#39;s left for dead. In
[2498.0s] the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine
[2500.079s] based on fundamentals. Fundamentals are
[2502.0s] better than they&#39;ve ever been. Price is
[2503.359s] worse than it&#39;s ever been. Bet on price.
[2505.119s] It&#39;ll catch up to fundamentals as they
[2506.72s] keep growing.
[2507.2s] &gt;&gt; You made a very compelling case. If I&#39;m
[2508.72s] a viewer, I&#39;m listening. Before I carve
[2510.24s] out a position, y
[2511.44s] &gt;&gt; you always think through downside risks.
[2512.88s] I know that. What are they here?
[2514.8s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, look, the balance sheet is pretty
[2516.56s] clean. Uh the the one risk obviously
[2518.96s] there&#39;s some uncertainty about tariffs.
[2520.64s] They&#39;re Canadianbased but uh they have
[2523.04s] much less impact. Management went
[2524.48s] through it on the last earning call.
[2525.68s] Listen to some of the earnings calls.
[2526.96s] You&#39;ll be less concerned about tariffs.
[2528.8s] I think uh if you had a consumer week
[2530.8s] but we saw Bank of America credit card
[2532.56s] spending up big in June now that
[2534.72s] certaintyy&#39;s coming back after the April
[2536.24s] May uncertainty. So I think on balance
[2538.48s] you want to be exposed to some of these
[2539.76s] brands and I like the fact uh consumer
[2542.079s] discretionary no one wants it. It was an
[2543.52s] underperformer first half. uh second
[2545.92s] half is starting to outperform and I
[2547.76s] want to be in those that are now you&#39;re
[2549.359s] seeing at the first three weeks already
[2550.64s] that rotation uh the goosees of the
[2553.28s] world advanced auto parts kind of
[2554.72s] qualifies in somewhat in that
[2556.16s] discretionary and others like Starbucks
[2559.119s] to a lesser extent the Nikes of the
[2560.8s] world we don&#39;t own Nike we don&#39;t own
[2562.4s] Starbucks but I like those themes where
[2564.24s] people were counting them out they were
[2565.68s] going to get killed by tariffs and
[2566.8s] uncertainty and now they&#39;re roaring back
[2568.72s] and the prices have not reflected that
[2570.64s] and that&#39;s where all these people that
[2572.16s] got caught flatfooted in April in the
[2574.079s] hole selling in the hole Now they have
[2575.839s] to catch up. They can&#39;t catch up by
[2577.359s] buying Meta up huge or Nvidia up huge.
[2580.88s] They got to catch up by buying the
[2582.079s] lagards that have good fundamentals. So
[2583.839s] hopefully they can catch up to the
[2585.119s] indices if they sold at the wrong time.
[2587.2s] So these type of names are going to
[2588.8s] outperform in the second half and that&#39;s
[2590.24s] where we&#39;re placing our bets.
[2591.28s] &gt;&gt; All right, three picks from turnaround
[2592.8s] Tom. Thank you, sir. Well, wrapping up
[2594.64s] today&#39;s market domination. Don&#39;t go
[2596.079s] anywhere. We&#39;ve got you covered with all
[2597.839s] the action and following the closing
[2599.04s] bell. Stay tuned for market domination
[2600.8s] overtime. Well, I think the market&#39;s
[2602.64s] used to Trump&#39;s negotiation strategy of
[2604.64s] punching people in the face and then
[2605.92s] offering them an ice pack and kind of
[2607.359s] backing off. And uh I think the big
[2609.68s] theme though in listening to Jared was
[2611.599s] uh small caps being the leader and
[2613.119s] that&#39;s in line with the Lagards uh
[2615.28s] leading for the second half because a
[2617.599s] lot of managers were caught off sides
[2618.96s] and they got to buy what&#39;s down in order
[2620.64s] to catch up to the indices. You can&#39;t
[2621.92s] buy the indices when they&#39;re already up.
[2623.44s] So continue to watch that theme.
[2625.359s] Consumer discretionary was out of favor
[2626.88s] first half. Small caps were out of
[2628.4s] favor. Energy was out of favor. Uh so so
[2631.28s] I think there&#39;s going to be some
[2632.079s] opportunities. That doesn&#39;t mean the
[2633.119s] others won&#39;t go up. It just means that
[2634.56s] your relative value is is there.
[2636.96s] &gt;&gt; Let me ask you about this. My colleague
[2638.16s] Josh Schaefer writing about this today.
[2640.16s] A number of firms Josh pointing on Wall
[2642.079s] Street raising their S&amp;P targets targets
[2645.04s] for the S&amp;P 500 points out RBC goes to
[2648.4s] 6250 apparently was at 5730. Here&#39;s what
[2652.24s] Lori Calvacina writes over there. She
[2654.56s] says we feel actually neutral. She says
[2656.72s] on the outlook for stocks in the second
[2658.319s] half. says, &quot;Mindful that our new price
[2660.56s] target is essentially in line with
[2662.0s] recent levels. Says we expect choppy
[2664.4s] conditions in the back half of the year
[2666.0s] and swings in both directions.&quot; You say
[2667.92s] what to that?
[2668.88s] &gt;&gt; First boss in the business, first hedge
[2670.4s] fund I worked at, my boss taught me the
[2672.319s] most important thing. Only key thing he
[2674.319s] taught me, opinion follows trend.
[2676.4s] &gt;&gt; And they got caught flatfooted. And now
[2678.079s] the market&#39;s run away from them. So
[2679.28s] they&#39;ve upgraded. They&#39;ll upgrade again
[2680.56s] when the market runs away from them. Let
[2682.24s] me give you a statistic. Uh the market&#39;s
[2685.04s] been up 25% off the bottom the last
[2686.96s] three months. The last times that this
[2688.48s] has happened since 1950, the average
[2690.88s] return 12 months out is another 23%. So
[2694.319s] RBC will be taking 6 6250 to 6,500 when
[2697.839s] it&#39;s at 6,700 and 6,500 to 6,900 when
[2701.44s] it&#39;s at 7,000. I&#39;m not saying that
[2702.96s] happens tomorrow. I&#39;m not saying we
[2704.319s] don&#39;t get volatility in the fall. I&#39;m
[2706.16s] just saying that
[2707.52s] &gt;&gt; if you look under the surface, there&#39;s
[2709.28s] still a lot to do. I mean, I got a lot
[2711.04s] of new money in this quarter and I was a
[2712.48s] little concerned. I&#39;m like, markets feel
[2713.52s] a little frothy. And I looked at some of
[2715.2s] the opportunities out there that weren&#39;t
[2717.2s] the heaviest waitings of the S&amp;P 500.
[2719.359s] I&#39;m like, &quot;This is easy.&quot; Like, there&#39;s
[2721.359s] real value that I can generate great
[2723.04s] returns for my clients. And um uh you
[2725.599s] just got to look for it and look where
[2727.04s] skate to where the puck&#39;s going, not
[2728.4s] where it already is.
[2729.44s] &gt;&gt; Talking about where it&#39;s going next,
[2730.48s] let&#39;s talk about earning season. That&#39;s
[2731.76s] coming up. Uh Jared, what&#39;s coming
[2733.28s] earning season? Is is this going to be a
[2734.64s] a positive catalyst for the market?
[2736.56s] &gt;&gt; I do think so. I think we&#39;re going to
[2737.92s] get some follow through here. And you
[2740.319s] know the thing about V recoveries is
[2742.079s] overbought can stay overbought for a
[2743.92s] while especially when there&#39;s so many
[2745.2s] people off sides and and who is off
[2746.72s] sides honestly the retail investor has
[2748.72s] been right since co and institutions
[2750.4s] have been too too pessimistic and
[2752.0s] they&#39;re still not at extreme levels so
[2753.839s] low secret to happiness low expectations
[2756.319s] expectations 4.8% 8% earnings growth
[2758.24s] down from 99 n and change. It&#39;s a bar
[2760.88s] you can step over. I think it&#39;s going to
[2762.24s] be stepped over. The key is going to be
[2763.44s] guidance and I think guidance is going
[2764.88s] to be better now that uncertainty is
[2766.24s] lifted a bit much certainly much more
[2768.48s] than when they were reporting for Q1.
[2770.319s] &gt;&gt; I hear some strategists saying
[2771.92s] interested to get your take on this that
[2773.68s] now more than ever they&#39;ll tell their
[2775.04s] clients you got to do your homework.
[2776.4s] What they mean is specifically they say
[2778.56s] Tom you got to figure out who has the
[2781.28s] pricing power right now to navigate
[2783.28s] tariffs and who doesn&#39;t. What do you
[2784.72s] make of that argument? I think there&#39;s
[2787.04s] definitely something to be said for
[2788.319s] that. I think the other side of that
[2790.319s] coin is the ones that don&#39;t have that
[2792.96s] pricing power have been repriced
[2796.88s] at such an extreme discount to the worst
[2799.52s] case scenario that you&#39;re probably
[2801.28s] getting more value there than looking
[2803.76s] for the ones that everyone&#39;s been
[2804.88s] crowding into that they think are
[2806.24s] completely unaffected by tariffs.
[2807.92s] &gt;&gt; Fair point. Thank you, Tom. I will say
[2809.76s] that the unintended consequence of
[2812.8s] removing these EV subsidies may may in
[2815.52s] fact be they&#39;re the last man standing as
[2817.359s] the Ribeanss go by the wayside as the
[2819.839s] big three invest less in EVs and more
[2822.72s] into hybrids. So I think there&#39;s always
[2824.64s] going to be a niche market for that on
[2825.92s] their base business. And then as you add
[2828.24s] in some of these factors like the
[2829.839s] humanoid robots, autonomous driving, uh
[2832.72s] you you got a lot of upside catalysts. I
[2835.119s] I invest more for free cash flow. So,
[2836.96s] this falls outside of my framework, but
[2838.319s] I could understand why people would be
[2840.16s] interested in betting on Elon Musk. He&#39;s
[2842.0s] proven himself over and over. He&#39;s like
[2843.599s] a cat. He&#39;s got nine lives and uh he&#39;ll
[2845.92s] come back with something that&#39;ll
[2847.119s] probably wow the world.
[2848.48s] &gt;&gt; Are you interested, Tom, in that broader
[2851.119s] robo taxi theme where Musk, of course,
[2853.52s] taking on Whimo? Does the space interest
[2856.079s] you long term?
[2857.68s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. I mean, when
[2859.599s] Musk announced that did that thing in
[2861.92s] Austin with uh one vehicle, a couple
[2864.88s] vehicles with drivers in it, the stock
[2866.72s] went up10 billion. Google&#39;s been
[2868.96s] executing on on all cylinders with
[2870.88s] Whimo. It gets absolutely zero credit
[2872.96s] attributed to the stock. So, uh I like
[2875.599s] the theme. Uh and the question is, is
[2877.839s] this going to be roll out? I I think
[2878.96s] Whimo&#39;s got the lead and I think Musk is
[2881.359s] going to try to figure out a way to
[2882.4s] catch them if not surpass them.
[2884.0s] &gt;&gt; All right, Pra. Thank you. And of
[2885.44s] course, a big thank you to Tom Hayes for
[2887.599s] hanging me with me this afternoon. Any
[2889.44s] final thoughts, Tom, for the audience?
[2891.52s] &gt;&gt; I think uh just be wary of you&#39;re going
[2895.119s] to see a consensus of people saying the
[2896.56s] market&#39;s now overbought, and a lot of
[2898.0s] those people are people who missed it.
[2899.839s] &gt;&gt; Uh V-shaped recoveries tend to push a
[2903.2s] little bit faster than everyone expects,
[2904.96s] even if they&#39;re unggrounded in the
[2906.64s] fundamentals. So, just be wary of that.
[2909.119s] We might push a little higher. Maybe
[2910.559s] we&#39;ll get some volatility in the fall,
[2912.0s] but the under underpinnings of the
[2913.76s] economy continue to be strong and the
[2916.319s] tax cuts, that one big beautiful bill,
[2918.24s] you could argue different sides of it.
[2919.76s] That&#39;s growth positive as Jose was
[2922.16s] saying earlier. Uh so, um we continue to
[2925.68s] be constructive. Just got to do a little
[2927.119s] more work under the surface to find the
[2928.48s] good opportunities.
[2929.2s] &gt;&gt; Overbought but can still move higher.
[2930.72s] Yeah,
[2930.96s] &gt;&gt; there you go. Thank you, Tom. Appreciate
[2932.319s] it. Coming up, a sea sweet shakeup.
[2935.04s] &gt;&gt; And we&#39;re back. And then I want to thank
[2938.48s] Diane King Hall and Maya Seal Schill for
[2942.16s] having me on the Schwab network. I love
[2944.48s] these next two. We go into picks in
[2946.88s] detail. I love talking about stocks.
[2948.8s] We&#39;ll listen in here.
[2949.76s] &gt;&gt; Investment strategies and stock picks.
[2951.28s] I&#39;m joined now by Tom Hayes, chairman
[2952.88s] and managing member Great Hill Capital.
[2956.24s] Tom, thank you so much for joining us
[2958.0s] today. Before we get into your picks and
[2959.92s] strategies, let&#39;s talk a little bit
[2961.2s] about uh the recovery because you have
[2963.04s] some thoughts on this a V-shaped
[2964.72s] recovery that we&#39;ve seen. You say
[2967.2s] overbought can stay overbought. What do
[2969.76s] you mean by that?
[2970.72s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I&#39;ve been doing this for
[2972.079s] a while as you know, Diane, and what I
[2974.0s] found is when you get these sharp
[2976.319s] V-shaped recoveries, the normal signals
[2979.359s] that you would get when we&#39;re in a
[2980.72s] regular range, when it gets overbought,
[2982.64s] you want to lighten up a little bit.
[2984.24s] They don&#39;t apply when you come 25% off
[2986.96s] the lows in three months. And actually
[2989.359s] what happens historically, uh, if you
[2991.76s] look back to 1950, on average, when the
[2994.16s] market&#39;s up 25%
[2997.359s] &gt;&gt; in 3 months, on average, the market goes
[2999.92s] up another 22.3%
[3002.319s] the next 12 months. That sounds crazy
[3004.64s] with the, you know, market trading at 22
[3006.8s] 23 times earnings.
[3008.4s] &gt;&gt; Uh, but you got to be open-minded. I c
[3010.8s] should we get some consolidation after
[3012.48s] such a big move? Yeah, we might get some
[3014.4s] sideways. We might get a little chop,
[3016.079s] but I wouldn&#39;t underestimate because
[3018.559s] it&#39;s what we call trapped bears. And a
[3022.16s] lot of people, not not so much retail,
[3024.4s] the retail investors have been the smart
[3025.92s] ones.
[3026.4s] &gt;&gt; They do say that the retail investors
[3028.319s] were the smart money this time around.
[3030.559s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Since co actually every single
[3032.559s] dip, institutions are still behind the
[3034.64s] curve. They&#39;re still skeptical. And now
[3037.04s] they&#39;ve got career risk because they
[3039.68s] lightened up at the exact wrong time.
[3041.359s] They sold over a trillion dollars of
[3042.8s] equity in the hole and every new good
[3044.96s] headline, whether it&#39;s a deal, whether
[3046.88s] it&#39;s earnings coming in better than
[3048.48s] expectations, they are forced back in.
[3050.64s] And you know what? They&#39;re going to be
[3051.599s] forced in. They can&#39;t chase the stuff
[3052.96s] that already ran. They miss that. They
[3055.2s] have to chase the lagards that are
[3056.8s] playing the catch-up trade in order to
[3058.319s] have any chance of catching the indices.
[3060.0s] &gt;&gt; So, I&#39;ll talk a little bit more about
[3061.359s] that. So, then though, what makes you
[3063.76s] said if you go back to 1950, what makes
[3065.599s] this setup different than typical like
[3067.119s] late stage rally?
[3069.04s] Yeah, I I think you have a lot of pro
[3073.04s] business policy that has just been
[3074.88s] implemented. So, we went from bombing
[3077.2s] and tariffs and uncertainty to now tax
[3080.559s] cuts, growth, and we haven&#39;t even gotten
[3083.28s] to the biggest part of it, which is
[3085.119s] going to be massive deregulation, okay?
[3088.16s] Unleashing animal spirits. You have
[3090.4s] corporate balance sheets of the S&amp;P 500,
[3093.28s] the most underlevered they&#39;ve been in
[3095.76s] years, and personal household balance
[3097.92s] sheets, the most underlevered they&#39;ve
[3100.079s] been in years. So, what&#39;s gumming up the
[3101.92s] system? Why don&#39;t we have Animal Spirits
[3103.599s] and 3 1/2% 4% GDP growth? We have
[3107.04s] artificially high interest rates. Okay,
[3110.319s] there was a there was a Fed head on two
[3112.079s] days ago saying we&#39;re around the neutral
[3114.319s] rate. Listen, I have an 11year-old
[3116.8s] daughter in fifth grade. I can say to
[3119.04s] her the Fed funds rate is 4.25%
[3123.04s] inflation is 2.7%. Does that look
[3125.76s] neutral to you? And she would say no
[3127.68s] daddy, it looks like you could drive a
[3129.119s] truck through that. The gap is so
[3130.88s] &gt;&gt; No, she would say that for an
[3132.16s] 11year-old. Okay, maybe in your
[3134.0s] household. So you you&#39;re making a case
[3136.24s] that the laggers will need to play
[3137.76s] catchup. Where do you see opportunity
[3139.92s] within sectors or names when it comes to
[3141.76s] the laggers?
[3142.559s] &gt;&gt; Okay, so one we brought to you when
[3144.4s] everyone was scared in April and that
[3146.0s] was called advanced auto parts. You
[3147.92s] couldn&#39;t give this thing away. It got
[3149.04s] down to $30. Everyone thought it was
[3151.28s] going out of business.
[3152.72s] &gt;&gt; Shane
[3153.28s] &gt;&gt; in May. Oh my gosh, it was terrible.
[3155.04s] &gt;&gt; Okay, so number one, it&#39;s doubled off
[3157.92s] the bottoms. Number two, it&#39;s going to
[3160.319s] double again over the next couple of
[3161.839s] years. Why? Shane O Kelly, he came from
[3164.64s] HD Supply. Okay, this is a $7 billion
[3167.359s] business for Home Depot. He understands
[3169.2s] distribution. So what did he do? He took
[3172.079s] solveny risk off the table. He sold off
[3174.48s] the Canada business, used that money,
[3176.64s] paid down debt. Now solveny is no longer
[3178.72s] an issue. Then he said, &quot;Okay, the
[3180.72s] United States, the West Coast is doing
[3182.559s] terribly because the stores are all
[3184.0s] spread out. They don&#39;t have any critical
[3185.28s] mass. We&#39;re spending too much money.
[3186.8s] It&#39;s taking too long to get the products
[3188.24s] to the customers. We&#39;re just going to be
[3189.68s] a loser in that area. We&#39;re shutting
[3191.04s] down those stores.&quot; Then what does he
[3193.359s] do? Clean up balance sheet. Good. Clean
[3195.359s] up the unprofitable stores. Now he&#39;s
[3197.44s] back into growth mode. He&#39;s opening up a
[3199.44s] hundred new stores in the next three
[3201.2s] years in those areas only which he is
[3203.599s] number one or number two in the auto
[3205.839s] parts supply business. Uh which is going
[3208.24s] to create efficiencies which is going to
[3210.0s] create growth. And here&#39;s the kicker.
[3212.16s] He&#39;s going to have margins at high
[3213.359s] single digits within the next 24 to 36
[3215.599s] months. The last time they had that the
[3217.44s] stock was $150. It&#39;s $60ish today. So
[3220.88s] that&#39;s why it&#39;s gone from 30 to 60. It&#39;s
[3222.64s] going to $120 over the next couple
[3224.24s] years.
[3224.4s] &gt;&gt; Okay. Because I was going to ask you if
[3225.839s] it&#39;s doubled, like how much more
[3229.68s] &gt;&gt; growth could it have?
[3230.72s] &gt;&gt; It&#39;ll consolidate the next few weeks,
[3232.16s] but if you take a 2-year view, it&#39;s
[3234.0s] going to double again.
[3234.88s] &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Uh so the take a
[3236.559s] two-year view on that one from the point
[3238.0s] of view of Tom Hayes there. All right,
[3239.68s] Tom, let&#39;s talk about Canada Goose.
[3241.359s] That&#39;s on your list. It has outperformed
[3243.359s] the S&amp;P 500 year to date. Now, and a a
[3246.64s] chunk of that run came within the past
[3248.319s] month or so.
[3249.76s] &gt;&gt; Why does it have more room to run from
[3251.839s] your point of view?
[3252.72s] &gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the thing. And their coats are
[3254.319s] expensive.
[3254.88s] &gt;&gt; Their coats are super expensive. Um, so
[3257.92s] we like this in the high single digits
[3259.52s] and the low double digits. It&#39;s moved.
[3262.24s] However, it&#39;s still down 80 90% from its
[3265.359s] co highs. In the short term, the market
[3267.92s] is a voting machine based on emotion. In
[3270.48s] the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine
[3271.68s] based on fundamentals. Let me tell you
[3272.96s] about these fundamentals. They have
[3275.359s] record revenues, record- free cash flow,
[3278.079s] and now record margins. So, why is the
[3279.76s] stock still down 90%. They&#39;re they&#39;re
[3282.0s] getting rid of their wholesale business,
[3283.359s] which is the lower margin business.
[3284.8s] They&#39;re all going DTC. The other thing
[3286.48s] is people going DTC. Okay.
[3288.079s] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. 76 stores. You got the one on
[3290.16s] Fifth Avenue. You always see a line. But
[3292.16s] here&#39;s the kicker. Like all luxury
[3293.92s] brands, they go, &quot;Oh, not everyone can
[3295.44s] afford a $1,900 or $1,500.&quot;
[3299.92s] Yes.
[3300.24s] &gt;&gt; They&#39;re going 365. Raincoats, eyewear,
[3304.24s] shoes, t-shirts.
[3306.0s] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[3306.559s] &gt;&gt; So, everyone can afford a piece of the
[3308.4s] brand. And it&#39;s huge. Not only in Asia,
[3310.48s] it&#39;s huge all over the world.
[3312.0s] Highquality stuff, family controlled.
[3314.4s] Family&#39;s got 39.5% of the stock. The son
[3317.119s] is running it. Danny is doing an
[3318.88s] incredible job. They&#39;re buying back
[3320.24s] stock. This is going to be a great
[3322.72s] recovery. It It&#39;s amazing. This is This
[3325.599s] is what This is my knitting. Okay. When
[3327.76s] fundamentals are improving, but the
[3329.76s] price is depressed, you play that
[3331.28s] divergence, and eventually short-term
[3333.52s] voting, long-term weighing, it will
[3335.359s] catch up to fundamentals. That&#39;s the
[3336.96s] story in Canada Goose. Does it pull back
[3338.72s] a couple bucks in the next? I have no
[3340.559s] idea. But over the next couple of years,
[3343.359s] this strategy is working. Margins are
[3345.2s] up. Uh all more and more people can
[3348.24s] afford their products. It&#39;s not just
[3349.599s] jacket
[3350.0s] &gt;&gt; because of their expanding. Quick 30
[3351.839s] second final thought from you. I know
[3353.2s] you have another pick. You can either go
[3354.72s] there or final thought on the overall
[3356.96s] market.
[3357.92s] &gt;&gt; I think well National Oil Well Varco is
[3360.48s] the old name. Nov Inc. I love stocks.
[3362.64s] What can I say?
[3363.359s] &gt;&gt; That&#39;s all right.
[3363.839s] &gt;&gt; All right.
[3364.72s] &gt;&gt; They&#39;ve got 50% of the market. They do
[3366.799s] onshore and offshore drilling rigs.
[3369.28s] They&#39;re the largest OEM and they have an
[3372.48s] install base uh bigger than anyone else
[3374.64s] which helps them with the cyclicality of
[3376.0s] the price. They&#39;re less sensitive to
[3377.2s] price. I want exposure to energy. I
[3379.119s] don&#39;t feel like the uh exploration and
[3381.2s] production companies have come down
[3382.4s] enough relative to the price of of oil.
[3385.92s] So, this is a way to play it. It&#39;s it&#39;s
[3387.52s] the cheapest it&#39;s been since 2001, right
[3389.44s] before it had a 10x run. The balance
[3391.52s] sheet is great. billion of cash, just
[3393.44s] over a billion dollars of debt, a
[3395.04s] billion dollars of free cash flow.
[3397.04s] They&#39;re not issuing shares, they&#39;re
[3398.64s] they&#39;re non-dilutive. So, if you think
[3400.96s] drilling is going to go up, which it
[3403.04s] will when rates come down,
[3404.72s] &gt;&gt; they&#39;re going to be a major beneficiary.
[3406.16s] And it&#39;s operating leverage is huge. So,
[3408.559s] that&#39;s a new one for us. We like it. And
[3410.96s] uh
[3411.599s] &gt;&gt; All right, that&#39;s a new one. You heard
[3412.96s] this here first. Well, I think first
[3415.28s] we&#39;ll popish, but I mean Tom is active
[3419.359s] on social media, so you can find more
[3421.599s] information there as well. Uh that&#39;s Tom
[3424.72s] Hayes joining us right now here on set
[3426.559s] the New York Stock Exchange, chairman of
[3428.64s] Great Hill Capital.
[3431.599s] &gt;&gt; And we&#39;re back. And then finally, thanks
[3434.72s] to Mel Montana&#39;s Christian Scher, who
[3437.68s] was out at Disneyland, by the way, doing
[3439.52s] an interview, I think, with Bob Iger and
[3441.92s] uh Caroline Woods for uh stepping in.
[3444.96s] We&#39;ll listen in here.
[3447.2s] &gt;&gt; Joining me for more on this and
[3449.599s] everything moving markets or that could
[3451.359s] potentially move markets today is Thomas
[3453.119s] Hayes, chairman and managing member at
[3455.2s] Great Hill Capital. He joins me at the
[3457.359s] desk. Thomas, great to have you.
[3458.88s] &gt;&gt; Great to be here, Caroline.
[3460.0s] &gt;&gt; Thanks so much for kicking off this
[3461.44s] Wednesday with us. So, we had a a whole
[3463.76s] bunch of news at the top there. I think
[3466.0s] it&#39;s good to start with maybe PPI and
[3468.72s] your reaction to that because obviously
[3470.72s] CPI yesterday seemed good at the
[3472.64s] headline level and then investors sort
[3475.04s] of dug in and might have seen some some
[3478.0s] tariff impact and things like furniture
[3480.64s] and clothes. At the wholesale level,
[3482.48s] it&#39;s actually cooler than expected.
[3484.4s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And wholesale tends to be the
[3486.0s] leading indicator. You know, if you look
[3487.599s] at uh core CPI yesterday, though, it&#39;s
[3489.52s] it&#39;s important to point out for the
[3491.359s] fifth consecutive month, it came in
[3493.76s] lower than estimates. That&#39;s number one.
[3495.92s] Number two, both headline and core were
[3499.359s] lower than January and February before
[3501.92s] tariffs kicked in. So, the case for rate
[3504.0s] cuts is starting to become stronger and
[3505.44s] stronger. And then PPI today, this is
[3508.16s] surprising, okay, to come in flat 0.0.
[3512.16s] all these people, the Fed included,
[3514.319s] rather than being data dependent, being
[3515.839s] prediction dependent, their predictions
[3517.52s] are proving to be incorrect. And I think
[3519.599s] there&#39;s going to be pressure uh to
[3521.92s] really start to consider at least a 25
[3523.68s] basis point cut. 62 63% odds probably
[3526.64s] went up this morning for September. It
[3528.72s] should be July. Uh, and I do think if
[3531.68s] it&#39;s not July, which the odds are it
[3533.599s] won&#39;t be, we&#39;re going to hear who our
[3535.76s] next Fed chair is going to be next year,
[3539.68s] and that the market will start to
[3541.28s] discount a more doubbish Fed even if
[3543.76s] Powell sits in the seat until next May.
[3545.839s] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, would those expectations be
[3548.799s] incorrect about inflation ticking higher
[3551.2s] or have we just not seen the impact of
[3553.839s] tariffs really hit the inflation data
[3556.079s] yet? because we still don&#39;t know what
[3558.64s] overall tariffs are going to be. We have
[3561.119s] the 10% baseline, but we have threats
[3563.28s] about even higher tariffs and some
[3566.0s] sectoral tariffs that are, you know,
[3567.839s] already feeling the hit.
[3569.76s] &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is waiting for GDAU. I mean,
[3571.44s] it was supposed to be last month was
[3572.88s] going to be terrible. This month was
[3574.24s] going to be terrible. Powell&#39;s like, is
[3575.839s] it going to be terrible? I mean, um,
[3578.319s] what&#39;s what&#39;s comical about the summary
[3579.92s] of economic projections is that they in
[3582.88s] their own projections acknowledge it&#39;s a
[3584.64s] one-time bump. Okay, which we haven&#39;t
[3586.319s] really really seen here. And then at the
[3588.319s] same time, speaking out out of both
[3589.839s] sides of their mouth, they say real GDP
[3591.44s] is going to decline to 1.4%. That old
[3593.92s] dog don&#39;t hunt. You know, if if
[3595.359s] inflation&#39;s going up, you you you&#39;re not
[3597.119s] going to see that. So, um so pressure is
[3599.68s] going to be on, but I think as it
[3601.119s] relates to the overall market, it&#39;s a
[3604.079s] very unique situation because everything
[3605.92s] appears to be a little bit frothy, a
[3607.92s] little bit overbought. We&#39;ve moved over
[3609.599s] 25% off the lows in just 3 months. But
[3613.119s] I&#39;ve been doing this for two decades.
[3614.799s] And what I found is when you have these
[3616.319s] V-shaped recoveries, uh, they tend to
[3619.359s] stay overbought for a while because so
[3621.44s] many people got flushed at the lows and
[3623.28s] they have to play catch-up. As a matter
[3624.88s] of fact, since 1950 on average, when you
[3627.68s] have a 25% move off the bottom in 3
[3629.76s] months, 12 months later, the market&#39;s up
[3631.68s] another 22.3%. That&#39;s a lot of data, 75
[3634.799s] years. So, um, could we get some
[3637.76s] consolidation? Sure. But I wouldn&#39;t get
[3641.28s] too bearish here because Trump&#39;s
[3643.28s] strategy is he punches people in the
[3644.96s] face and then he offers them an ice pack
[3646.48s] and they&#39;re grateful. So yes, he
[3648.559s] escalates. He asks for 300 basis points
[3650.319s] of cuts. Maybe he gets 100. He asks for
[3652.799s] 30% or 50% or 100% tariffs. He winds up
[3655.68s] with 10 or 20, which is more than anyone
[3657.44s] thought he could get a year ago. Uh and
[3660.24s] it&#39;s proving to be positive. We ran a
[3662.16s] budget surplus last month. Record
[3664.96s] tariffs collected 27 billion. budget
[3667.68s] surplus right in line with 27 billion.
[3670.16s] So, uh, then you got tax cuts. You know,
[3672.48s] we went from bombs and tariffs to tax
[3675.92s] cuts and growth. And the next phase is
[3677.839s] going to be deregulation in a massive
[3679.599s] way for banks, which are going to be
[3680.799s] able to hold more treasuries with the
[3682.24s] SLR, supplemental leverage ratio. It&#39;s
[3684.319s] going to bring 10-year yields down. It&#39;s
[3685.76s] going to uh really really kickstart the
[3688.24s] housing market, which has been left for
[3689.599s] dead with artificially high rates.
[3691.44s] &gt;&gt; Is that priced in, do you think, at
[3693.28s] these levels? because there was
[3694.48s] expectation for deregulation, but if
[3696.64s] this is ultimately a market that can
[3698.24s] push higher, is it just playing catch-up
[3700.96s] or are there real fundamental reasons
[3703.28s] that this market should push higher?
[3705.44s] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and I wouldn&#39;t be captivated
[3707.76s] by the general indices because they&#39;re
[3709.92s] overweighted to MAG 7 whose earnings
[3712.48s] have been de earnings growth has been
[3714.48s] decelerating all year and is going to
[3716.24s] continue to decelerate partially due to
[3718.319s] capex, partially because the rates were
[3720.0s] high. I think you could see a lot of
[3722.24s] companies under the surface, the
[3723.92s] unmagnificent 493 double and triple over
[3726.88s] the next couple years without moving the
[3728.4s] indices much because their waitings are
[3730.4s] still so low. So, this is going to be a
[3733.76s] really fertile ground for stock pickers
[3736.16s] doing bottom-up fundamental analysis
[3737.92s] that know what they own uh to make an
[3740.24s] incredible amount of money in a
[3741.52s] relatively reasonable amount of time.
[3743.44s] So, if investors have to be a bit more
[3745.92s] selective in terms of where they&#39;re
[3748.0s] deploying their capital, what&#39;s your
[3750.319s] best advice about where they should be
[3752.16s] doing just that?
[3753.44s] &gt;&gt; Well, I think you uh I think the housing
[3757.359s] theme
[3758.88s] that&#39;s been left for dead is a place to
[3760.64s] start to look. We&#39;ve got a couple
[3762.16s] turnarounds for you, but uh I you know,
[3764.799s] we own companies like Stanley Black &amp;
[3766.72s] Decker. They&#39;re a derivative play on
[3768.24s] housing and construction, which is 16.2%
[3770.4s] of the economy. We have Generrack which
[3772.559s] owns uh 75% of the home standby
[3775.359s] generator market. All of these are
[3777.359s] highly interest rate sensitive. And then
[3779.68s] we&#39;ve got Brad Jacobs company uh QXO
[3782.64s] which they bought Beacon Roofing Supply.
[3784.4s] He&#39;s going to do a roll up in building
[3786.4s] materials. And you know Brad Jacobs from
[3788.16s] XPO which was a 5060 bagger. You know
[3790.72s] him from United Rentals uh which was
[3793.28s] also a 5060 Bagger. He makes a lot of
[3795.359s] money for shareholders and QXO is just
[3797.839s] getting started. So those are on the
[3798.96s] housing theme. We were here with Kristen
[3800.96s] last month. We we talked about a stock
[3802.559s] called Advanced Auto Parts. Discre
[3804.96s] discretionary has gotten left for dead
[3806.96s] in the first half of the year. It&#39;s
[3808.079s] starting to outperform the second half
[3809.52s] as the consumer confidence comes back.
[3811.76s] This is a turnaround play. Shane O.
[3813.52s] Kelly came from Home Depot supply. Uh
[3816.319s] he&#39;s cleaned up the balance sheet, sold
[3818.079s] off the Canada business, paid down debt,
[3819.839s] shut the unprofitable stores. Now he&#39;s
[3821.52s] back in growth mode. 100 new stores in
[3823.68s] the next 3 years. The stock has doubled
[3825.839s] off the lows from last month. It&#39;s going
[3827.28s] to double again over the next couple of
[3828.799s] years. He&#39;s a winner. That&#39;s an
[3830.799s] opportunity. Uh, and then we got a
[3832.4s] couple more turnarounds. Which one do
[3833.839s] you want to hear first?
[3834.64s] &gt;&gt; Uh, well, we only have 30 seconds. So,
[3836.88s] &gt;&gt; let me give you a brand new one.
[3838.16s] National Oil Well, Varco. Okay. No OV,
[3840.88s] Inc., now they call themselves. Uh,
[3842.64s] leader in onshore and offshore drilling
[3844.72s] rigs. This is a way to get exposure to
[3846.96s] the energy sector. The demand for energy
[3848.88s] is going to continue to grow massively
[3850.799s] without taking massive underlying price
[3853.28s] risk because we don&#39;t know what the
[3854.4s] price of oil is going to do tomorrow or
[3855.76s] the next day. um 50% install base uh and
[3860.16s] they they have a pristine balance sheet,
[3862.64s] $1.2 billion of cash, only $1.7 billion
[3865.44s] of debt, 100 billion of free cash flow.
[3867.599s] They&#39;re not diluting shareholders, same
[3869.44s] share count. So, it&#39;s a hugely leveraged
[3872.16s] uh operating leverage play on the
[3874.319s] recovery in rig count over the next 2 3
[3876.4s] years. We are going to drill baby drill,
[3878.24s] but we need rates to come down for it to
[3880.0s] be economic at $60 70 and they&#39;ll be a
[3882.24s] key beneficiary.
[3883.2s] &gt;&gt; Okay. And looks like you can potentially
[3885.44s] buy that dip. That one&#39;s down 12% year
[3887.599s] to date. Advanced Auto Parts up more
[3889.359s] than 30%. Year to date. We have to leave
[3891.44s] it there. Thomas Hayes, always
[3892.64s] appreciate your your stock picks and
[3894.64s] your insights. Thanks so much.
[3896.0s] &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me.
[3896.72s] &gt;&gt; That&#39;s Thomas Hayes, chairman and
[3897.92s] managing member at Great Hill Capital.
[3900.24s] All right.
[3902.079s] &gt;&gt; And we&#39;re back. So, I wanted to have a
[3904.799s] huge guest for uh episode number 300.
[3907.599s] And I literally reached out to all of
[3909.2s] our CEOs. What I didn&#39;t count on was the
[3911.92s] fact that they&#39;re all in a quiet period.
[3914.24s] Darren uh Brack and Daryl said as much
[3916.48s] his team was interested. Uh they are in
[3918.96s] a quiet period, so I&#39;m going to keep
[3920.24s] following up and try to get them in a a
[3922.0s] future episode month or so down the
[3924.96s] road. Um on uh uh Brad Jacobs, they were
[3929.039s] kind enough uh to respond out and I&#39;m
[3931.359s] going to be meeting him in the month of
[3933.119s] September, not for the podcast at this
[3935.2s] moment. Uh kind of a meet and greet. So
[3937.599s] we&#39;re I&#39;m excited for that when I&#39;m back
[3939.359s] on the East Coast and uh and grateful
[3942.0s] for that as well. So, let&#39;s get down to
[3944.0s] business here. The wise ones bet heavily
[3946.559s] when the world offers them that
[3948.24s] opportunity. They bet big when they have
[3950.079s] the odds and the rest of the time they
[3952.48s] don&#39;t. It&#39;s just that simple. That&#39;s
[3953.92s] Charlie Munger. And then Buffett, what
[3956.96s] counts for most people in investing is
[3959.2s] not how much they know, but rather how
[3961.599s] realistically they define what they
[3964.72s] don&#39;t know. And what you can tell if
[3966.4s] you&#39;ve been listening for a while, and
[3967.68s] most of you have, uh, we stay in our
[3971.76s] lane. We eat our own cooking and we
[3975.839s] stick to where we have an edge and we
[3978.0s] love turnarounds. We love high-quality
[3980.079s] businesses that are temporarily marked
[3981.52s] down and we continue to do it over and
[3983.76s] over and many of you have really
[3985.599s] benefited immensely. Uh and I&#39;m grateful
[3988.079s] for all your feedback. We had some
[3989.599s] amazing um uh emails this week and uh
[3993.28s] super grateful for that. Also very
[3994.96s] grateful for all of you who have
[3996.16s] supported the podcast uh that can&#39;t
[3998.319s] afford to become clients and are either
[4000.079s] on the trade service or um you know
[4002.64s] buying the merch and sending in your
[4004.4s] photos. Let&#39;s get let&#39;s get a bunch more
[4006.319s] photos in ladies and gentlemen because
[4008.079s] the orders are pouring in. You can get a
[4009.92s] hat like this t-shirt golf thing. You
[4012.16s] just go to hedge funips.com
[4014.4s] click on the hat here. It&#39;ll take you to
[4016.799s] the merch store and get your photo up.
[4018.64s] Be part of the community. That&#39;ll be
[4020.0s] fun. Now
[4021.92s] the question on everyone&#39;s mind uh is
[4027.119s] are we overbought?
[4029.28s] And if you gathered anything from my
[4032.48s] appearances, the answer is yes. And it
[4035.839s] doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re going to crash.
[4038.16s] And it doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re not going
[4041.119s] to go higher either. Um and even if we
[4045.119s] got some short-term consolidation,
[4048.079s] what&#39;s the difference? So, I had um you
[4051.28s] know I talked to my clients and and many
[4054.16s] of them are now good friends uh and and
[4056.88s] they&#39;ll reach out and one one was saying
[4058.559s] oh the market market&#39;s overbought and I
[4061.76s] replied and I said yeah I know that and
[4064.4s] so does everyone else and which one of
[4066.64s] the companies that we own uh together
[4071.359s] do you feel is trading at or above its
[4075.2s] intrinsic value?
[4077.52s] And it, you know, there were crickets
[4080.16s] and then there was, you know, we got on
[4082.24s] the phone and it was like, yeah, you
[4084.72s] know, that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s why that&#39;s
[4086.72s] why I pay you to do what you do because
[4088.48s] the answer is none of them. You know, we
[4091.039s] know where we&#39;re getting out of these
[4092.319s] companies before we get in. So, if
[4094.24s] they&#39;re right and it&#39;s overbought or
[4095.76s] whatever and we consolidate sideways or
[4098.159s] we get a little chop, it makes no
[4099.6s] difference. And I and I want to
[4101.839s] illustrate
[4104.0s] um
[4107.759s] the core concept that we&#39;ve tried to
[4110.88s] instill over the last 300 episodes,
[4113.44s] which is to zoom out and separate
[4116.64s] yourself from all the noise and focus on
[4119.759s] what matters. Focus on the underlying
[4121.52s] fundamentals. Don&#39;t get caught in the
[4122.96s] short-term emotional
[4125.839s] voting machine that people think that
[4127.92s] they can predict whether the next move
[4129.52s] in the market is two points 2% up or 5%
[4132.56s] down. All of that is complete and utter
[4135.04s] Okay, I can say that I earned
[4138.239s] that in in episode 300. Um, but I want
[4141.759s] to go through some of these names
[4142.799s] because, you know, Advanced Auto Parts,
[4145.199s] it&#39;s it&#39;s now doubled off the bottom in
[4147.279s] a in a matter of weeks. Is this
[4148.799s] overbought? If we were to pull up the
[4150.319s] daily chart, would this look a little
[4152.48s] bit like, oh, it&#39;s gotten far ahead?
[4154.319s] Yeah. But here we&#39;re looking at the
[4155.839s] monthly chart. And what we can realize,
[4158.0s] and this is really good for all the new
[4159.6s] C clients that came in this quarter, and
[4161.839s] a ton of you did, and a ton of you added
[4163.92s] money. And I think it&#39;s because you
[4165.839s] understand the framework enough to say,
[4168.08s] wait a second, if we&#39;re looking under
[4169.839s] the surface, the game hasn&#39;t even begun.
[4171.759s] Look at this thing. It&#39;s It&#39;s up a 100%
[4174.319s] in a couple of months and it literally
[4177.52s] has not even begun its recovery. This is
[4179.759s] going When I talked to um Diane King
[4183.279s] Hall and I said it&#39;s going to double
[4184.48s] again and she said why? And I went
[4186.239s] through all the reasons. I was being
[4187.759s] conservative. Ladies and gentlemen, this
[4189.759s] thing is so yes, it&#39;s up 100%. Could it
[4193.12s] pull back to 50 before it goes to 100?
[4195.199s] Of course it could. But are we going to
[4197.04s] take a tax event just because we don&#39;t
[4199.199s] want five minutes of short-term
[4201.04s] volatility? That&#39;s not the type of
[4202.8s] client I attract. That&#39;s why I do these
[4205.36s] podcasts because the people that come to
[4206.88s] me are business-minded, successful
[4208.719s] people who take the short-term noise,
[4211.36s] don&#39;t get faked out by the short-term
[4212.8s] headlines in exchange for the long-term
[4215.6s] big rewards. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re
[4217.52s] talking. So, I&#39;m going to go through,
[4218.64s] you know, quick sampling of zoomed out
[4220.719s] charts, which is more the most valuable
[4223.28s] thing I could teach you.
[4225.6s] um because we do do the granular
[4227.28s] fundamentals and we do do the earnings
[4228.88s] calls and we do do the financials and we
[4230.64s] do do the ask me anything. But just to
[4232.64s] show you for those of you who think you
[4234.56s] want to time the market because it looks
[4236.4s] frothy right now, um be careful what
[4239.679s] you&#39;re selling. I mean, if you&#39;re
[4241.04s] selling the Momo stocks and the shiny
[4243.92s] objects that have had this quick
[4245.28s] rebound, you&#39;re you&#39;re probably totally
[4247.6s] right, by the way, or shorting them. Uh
[4250.08s] if you&#39;re selling some of these that are
[4251.44s] just getting going, you&#39;re going to miss
[4252.719s] the whole boat. you&#39;re absolutely going
[4254.32s] to miss it at the exact wrong time. You
[4255.92s] waited through all of this not noise and
[4258.8s] now you&#39;re getting paid. You&#39;re going to
[4260.08s] sell out because you&#39;re scared about
[4262.0s] some headline or some silly stupid thing
[4263.92s] when the game is just getting started.
[4265.28s] What about Albamaro, which looks like
[4267.76s] it&#39;s absolutely flown. And by the way,
[4271.12s] it has. Last month I was pitching
[4272.719s] Kristen Scher. She wasn&#39;t there this
[4274.32s] month on Albamaro when it was in the 50s
[4277.199s] and now it&#39;s at $75.
[4279.6s] It went from 49 to 75 in two months. But
[4283.199s] when we zoom out, this has not begun. So
[4287.04s] yeah, it&#39;s up 50% in a couple of weeks
[4289.84s] and zoom out and the party hasn&#39;t even
[4292.64s] started yet. I would put new money to
[4294.56s] work today in this name even though it&#39;s
[4297.199s] up and it makes it harder
[4298.64s] psychologically to do Boeing. Okay,
[4300.96s] that&#39;s had a monster run. It&#39;s up from
[4303.44s] uh 135 to 231 from when we were on Vney
[4306.88s] pounding the table. Buy it at 135.
[4309.28s] Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, they can&#39;t. The
[4311.12s] doors are falling off.&quot; All this
[4312.64s] That doesn&#39;t matter. It
[4314.48s] matters. Look, it matters. Obviously,
[4316.32s] safety is important, but they got the
[4317.76s] right guy running it. They have an
[4318.88s] engineer running it now. People are
[4320.159s] going to be safe.
[4322.159s] Um, United on the other hand, not so
[4324.56s] happy with those those guys. They are
[4326.8s] going to be giving me a lot of effing
[4328.32s] miles. That that I can tell you right
[4329.92s] now. But, um, uh, so Boeing, yeah, it&#39;s
[4333.84s] come a long way. It&#39;s up almost 100% in
[4336.159s] a few months, but in the long-term
[4339.52s] scheme of things, in a duopoly, it
[4341.199s] hasn&#39;t even started. So, do you trim
[4342.64s] some? Yeah, we trim the options a few
[4344.239s] weeks ago. We made a lot of money on the
[4346.159s] options. Can we trim a little stock? You
[4349.28s] can. You can to make room for stuff, but
[4352.8s] this thing is going to keep going. So,
[4355.44s] you know, don&#39;t get faked out. Baba,
[4357.92s] everyone&#39;s going sideways because Baba
[4360.08s] went to 144, back to 15, 105 or
[4363.84s] whatever. It&#39;s up from 55. Number one.
[4366.88s] Number two. Okay, someone said to me
[4370.08s] today, &quot;Oh, Bob is struggling.&quot; I said,
[4372.0s] &quot;What? The price or the fundamentals?&quot;
[4374.239s] Because the fundamentals that I look at
[4376.08s] keep getting better. They continue to
[4377.6s] build their moat as the number one AI
[4379.52s] player in the world in my view. Number
[4381.84s] two, number one retailer in the world. I
[4383.84s] mean, how do you grow top line when you
[4386.96s] have the biggest e-commerce business in
[4389.12s] the world? Like, how do you have that
[4390.719s] growth rate of high single digits, low
[4392.8s] double digits when you&#39;re already doing
[4394.719s] a billion people? And they figured out a
[4396.56s] way to do it. So, this one is just
[4399.76s] sitting waiting for the deal with Xi and
[4403.04s] Trump and it&#39;s going to be off to the
[4405.36s] races. And this is the perfect setup and
[4408.239s] I talked about it two weeks ago. Um
[4412.88s] if I was running this stock as like as
[4415.679s] like you know people say uh people make
[4418.64s] up in their mind they say like oh stocks
[4420.64s] are manipulated because they they don&#39;t
[4422.32s] want to take responsibility for their
[4423.6s] own actions. But if if there was a way
[4425.92s] to manipulate this stock this is exactly
[4428.0s] the way I would make it look. I would
[4429.92s] have people absolutely despondent at 65
[4432.64s] puking in the hole. I&#39;d get as many
[4434.719s] headlines in as many newspapers as
[4436.96s] possible saying the world was ending in
[4438.64s] China and everything was done to just
[4440.719s] get every last person who had stock up
[4443.28s] here to give me their stock in the 60s
[4445.199s] and and the 50s. And then as soon as
[4448.239s] they were just completely capitulation,
[4450.8s] completely uninvestable, completely the
[4453.36s] world is over, delist the stocks, all
[4456.32s] the worst headlines to scare everyone
[4458.48s] out of the stock of one of the greatest
[4460.239s] cash flow generators in the entire world
[4462.32s] at the lowest prices. I&#39;d run it
[4464.159s] straight up the flag for 150 to get the
[4467.6s] suckers back in because they just missed
[4470.239s] more than a double 150% move off the
[4472.48s] top. And once we get the morons back in,
[4474.56s] you take it right back down to 100 to
[4476.4s] get them back out again before you make
[4477.76s] the final run. This is like textbook
[4480.4s] 101. How to absolutely destroy people in
[4484.4s] a stock. And that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s
[4486.159s] happening now. And I got to tell you,
[4489.04s] some of the weak hands have been puking
[4490.48s] out at 105 or 110. This gave me the
[4492.96s] first opportunity in many, many quarters
[4496.159s] to be able to put brand new clients in
[4498.239s] Alibaba below $110. I never thought that
[4501.52s] would come again. I was prepared if it
[4503.76s] did. It came and now we&#39;re we&#39;re going
[4506.64s] to be off to the races. You&#39;re going to
[4508.159s] wake up one morning. There&#39;s going to be
[4509.92s] a deal between Trump and Xi. Trump has
[4512.32s] dialed down the stuff. He allowed Nvidia
[4515.199s] now to sell their H20 chips to China as
[4519.36s] a complete olive branch and we are going
[4523.199s] to be off to the races with or without
[4526.96s] you. So that&#39;s that. Uh Baxter. Okay.
[4531.44s] this thing. It&#39;s just it&#39;s in
[4534.159s] healthcare. Healthc care is getting beat
[4535.679s] down until it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s no different
[4537.28s] than early 2000s, which we&#39;ve done the
[4539.44s] analog over and over. They&#39;ve got the
[4541.04s] new CEO. This one will be fine. So, you
[4544.159s] know, we could go through a bunch more,
[4546.0s] but again, all these stocks that look
[4548.239s] like they&#39;ve totally taken off haven&#39;t
[4549.84s] even gotten started. CCI, this is a
[4552.0s] rates play. You&#39;re going to see that
[4553.28s] happen. um as
[4557.04s] this stuff Cooper Standard. Okay, th
[4559.84s] this thing is just getting started.
[4562.4s] We&#39;ve got the uh interest deductibility
[4565.12s] on new cars made in America now. We got
[4567.52s] the volume&#39;s picking up. I talked to you
[4569.84s] saw the thing uh Ford had its largest
[4573.04s] month ever. I talked to a buddy playing
[4575.28s] golf in Connecticut. He runs one of the
[4576.8s] largest Toyota dealers in the country
[4579.199s] and he said it was their biggest month
[4580.719s] ever. It&#39;s incentives. The game is on.
[4582.56s] This thing is early days and you people
[4585.52s] are so some of you are so impatient.
[4588.159s] You&#39;re making so much money and you want
[4589.92s] to make so much more in such a short
[4591.92s] period of time. Just chill out. Let the
[4594.719s] money come to you. It&#39;s coming, baby.
[4596.48s] The work is done. Um, and most of you
[4599.12s] saw it last quarter. So, you know, uh,
[4601.28s] pat yourselves on the back for being in
[4603.28s] the right place at the right time with
[4604.8s] the right manager. What can I say? Uh,
[4607.12s] comtock. Okay, so this has to
[4608.88s] consolidate. I had some guy said, &quot;Oh my
[4610.8s] god, it&#39;s gone down from 31 to 23 in a
[4614.719s] few weeks.&quot; Like We&#39;re up from $7
[4618.4s] a share. Of course, it&#39;s going to
[4620.32s] consolidate. It did the exact same thing
[4622.48s] in 2002, 2003. It goes up. It
[4626.239s] consolidates and comes back. Takes out
[4628.239s] the weak hands, the idiots who bought at
[4630.0s] 30, chased it up. Take them take them
[4632.719s] out. Let them puke it down at 20. We&#39;ll
[4636.239s] potentially buy some more at 20 and ride
[4638.719s] it up to 50 and then everyone will want
[4640.56s] it at 50 and we&#39;ll start to lay some
[4642.239s] off. Dagio, okay, they just got a new
[4645.12s] CEO finally. They&#39;ve had two morons
[4647.6s] running the business for the last two
[4649.76s] iterations.
[4651.6s] And uh you know, Buffett, our investment
[4654.56s] in Dagio is pretty darn simple. Buffett
[4657.84s] said, &quot;Buy a business that&#39;s so good
[4659.76s] that even a ham sandwich could run it
[4661.76s] because one day a ham sandwich will.&quot;
[4663.44s] And we&#39;ve had two ham sandwiches. So now
[4665.76s] I think you&#39;re going to find uh I I
[4668.56s] wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you
[4670.08s] got an Irishman in there from Dagio to
[4672.239s] run the damn thing and uh and take it up
[4674.64s] the flag pole because the brands can&#39;t
[4676.56s] be competed with and people still want
[4678.159s] to escape and they&#39;re the best in the
[4679.76s] game for premiumization emerging
[4681.44s] markets. They&#39;re best positioned. They
[4683.199s] just had morons running it. So, uh, but
[4685.679s] you you you can, you know, they&#39;ve
[4687.6s] worked overtime to try to destroy it,
[4689.28s] but it&#39;s just one of those businesses
[4690.48s] you can&#39;t do. Like Boeing, like they
[4692.56s] tried for 5 years, you know, the
[4694.88s] salesman who ran it before Ortberg, uh,
[4698.719s] tried his very best to destroy one of
[4700.239s] the greatest businesses in mankind and
[4701.84s] and he just simply couldn&#39;t do it. Uh,
[4704.239s] Disney, another one. Okay. Yeah, it&#39;s up
[4706.48s] 50% in a few weeks. So, could it pull
[4708.48s] back down to 110? I don&#39;t know. Who
[4711.04s] cares? It&#39;s going a lot higher. They
[4713.12s] have a moat. What they do in terms of
[4716.08s] the streaming, they&#39;ve got half the
[4717.76s] streamers as Netflix. They got zero
[4720.4s] attribution for that streaming business,
[4722.159s] which is just getting started. Same
[4723.6s] thing in 1984 when they transformed
[4726.0s] their library uh uh over to um VHS. It
[4731.36s] took a while to gain traction and then
[4733.04s] boom, it was a money machine. Their
[4734.719s] cruises are 20% return on invested
[4736.8s] capital. They&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re
[4738.8s] growing those out. They&#39;ve got the Abu
[4740.48s] Dhabi park. They got the movies.
[4743.12s] And people are like, &quot;Oh, should I sell
[4744.88s] it?&quot; Yeah, sell it. It&#39;ll go down to
[4747.199s] 110. Are you gonna buy it at 110? I
[4749.44s] mean,
[4751.679s] um,
[4754.4s] let&#39;s stay louder. Here&#39;s another one
[4756.159s] straight up in the last few weeks from
[4758.0s] $48 to $86.
[4761.04s] It hasn&#39;t begun. It&#39;ll go back to $60
[4764.56s] and retest or whatever. Or it won&#39;t. It
[4767.199s] doesn&#39;t really matter. And it&#39;ll just
[4769.199s] work its way higher over time. Why?
[4771.04s] because it&#39;s one of the greatest
[4772.0s] businesses ever built in the history of
[4773.44s] mankind. It&#39;s 75 years old. They buy and
[4775.76s] sell brands. People think it&#39;s one
[4777.12s] brand. It&#39;s a dozen brands. They got the
[4779.36s] hot new brands for the young people, the
[4781.52s] Korean stuff that the K-pop people wear
[4784.0s] that, you know, danced at the concert
[4785.92s] for my daughters.
[4788.32s] They&#39;re going to be great. Okay. I walk
[4790.8s] into Fox Business and my favorite
[4793.199s] person, Yasha, says, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s get
[4795.52s] that makeup on. Get rid of your rings
[4797.76s] under your eyes. That&#39;s my thing. I
[4799.52s] always have my hair sticking up like
[4801.199s] alalfa in the back. Teresa combs that
[4803.92s] down. And then I got these big rings
[4806.32s] under my eyes cuz I stay up late looking
[4808.239s] at stock stock charts and reading
[4811.52s] fundamentals and all that stuff. And um
[4815.12s] and uh and what does she do? She pulls
[4817.12s] out her Mac. MAC is one of Estee
[4819.679s] Lauder&#39;s brands. She puts it on. Boom
[4821.84s] boom boom. No more rings. I like why do
[4823.92s] you use Mac? Why don&#39;t you use other
[4825.28s] stuff that&#39;s cheaper? She&#39;s like because
[4826.56s] nothing&#39;s better. That&#39;s all you need to
[4828.56s] know. On to the next. Etsy impatience.
[4833.199s] Record free cash flow. Hang in there.
[4835.36s] That&#39;s going to be fine. Just getting
[4836.719s] started. Yeah, it&#39;s up a bit.
[4839.6s] So, so it&#39;s like, okay, the market&#39;s
[4842.32s] overbought. Which one should we sell
[4844.239s] first? That&#39;s on that&#39;s on the that you
[4846.8s] Yeah, it&#39;s a lot of them are up 50% and
[4849.36s] 100% in the last couple of months, but
[4852.48s] every single one of them have have at
[4854.4s] least one to in some cases nine more
[4857.12s] bags left in them. So, you want to sell
[4859.28s] it now thinking that you&#39;re going to
[4860.88s] save half a bag and buy it back and pay
[4863.36s] taxes anyway and not wind up making or
[4865.44s] do you want to just be smart and sit
[4867.199s] back, suck up any short-term volatility
[4869.679s] and just ride it through, finish the
[4871.679s] year super high, super happy, and uh
[4874.719s] onto the next gener
[4879.6s] thing down to 100. It&#39;s up 50% in a few
[4881.84s] weeks. Well, we didn&#39;t buy it for 150
[4884.08s] bucks, okay? at whether at 90, whether
[4886.96s] at 10 105, wherever you came in to be a
[4890.64s] client. We bought this thing for well
[4892.56s] above 200 and beyond, and it&#39;s not even
[4894.64s] started. So, yeah, it&#39;s up 50%. We&#39;re
[4896.48s] happy. The P&amp;L is looking great.
[4898.4s] Everyone&#39;s smart in a bull market, but
[4900.64s] on a business basis, long-term weighing
[4903.44s] machine, these things are not even
[4905.679s] started. Goose, Goose is up over 100% in
[4908.8s] the last two months. Okay? It&#39;s got
[4912.0s] record free cash flow, record margins.
[4914.8s] um um record revenues
[4918.8s] and people are saying is it overbought?
[4920.719s] This thing&#39;s still down 80%. It has more
[4922.8s] cash flow, more revenues, more margins
[4925.52s] per share, not non-dilutive. The family
[4928.48s] owns 39.5 and it&#39;s still down, you know,
[4931.76s] 60 70%. This thing is just beginning the
[4934.48s] 365. Listen to the interview with Dian
[4936.88s] GXO, new CEO. The game is back on. They
[4941.28s] got the approval of um of the Winkington
[4946.639s] deal. Okay. They they haven&#39;t even
[4948.48s] started to juice out the free cash flow
[4951.199s] and earnings of the synergies of that
[4953.12s] combination. It&#39;s going to be
[4954.239s] unbelievable. There&#39;s a reason the
[4955.92s] government asked whether it was a
[4957.28s] monopoly because when it&#39;s together,
[4959.679s] it&#39;s going to be very very very
[4961.6s] profitable. Okay? So whether it&#39;s uh you
[4965.199s] know they got through that. Okay? So
[4966.88s] leave it at that or Mel. It&#39;s a
[4968.4s] defensive. defensives hasn&#39;t done well
[4969.92s] because everyone&#39;s been buying, you
[4971.679s] know, Shitcoin and Trumpcoin and all
[4975.6s] that stuff. It&#39;s not the environment for
[4977.12s] defenses, but it will be. So, if we get
[4978.88s] a little rockiness in some of these
[4980.48s] names in the fall, this these type of
[4982.88s] names will do really well. The
[4984.239s] Backaxers, the Hormels, the ones that
[4986.08s] are doing nothing right now. Intel, Lip
[4988.56s] Boutan, I I mean, yeah, it&#39;s up a few
[4991.36s] points, but it&#39;s not even begun. So, you
[4995.44s] know, I I&#39;m just trying to go through
[4997.04s] some of these names. National Oil Well,
[4999.36s] Varco, it&#39;s gone up a couple points.
[5002.4s] This is exactly what it did in the early
[5004.239s] 2000s. It starts to recover, goes back,
[5007.28s] fakes everyone out before the big run.
[5009.12s] And I think we&#39;re we&#39;re going to start
[5010.56s] that in the energy sector imminently.
[5013.6s] And I wanted to have a little bit more
[5014.96s] exposure than just com stock resources.
[5017.92s] So, if there&#39;s not room in your
[5019.12s] portfolio, you&#39;ve been around for it,
[5020.639s] you, you know, pick up a couple shares
[5022.08s] if you think it makes sense. We&#39;re going
[5023.52s] to go through that analysis. Uh new
[5025.44s] people, you&#39;re you&#39;re getting shares as
[5027.44s] you&#39;re coming in. Um but that&#39;s a good
[5030.0s] one. And then PayPal, yeah, it&#39;s up a
[5032.56s] lot from 55 to 73 in a in a couple of
[5035.04s] months. We&#39;re not in it for anything
[5037.12s] under 150. So like chillax. Okay. If we
[5041.04s] go back to 65 before we go to 150, so be
[5044.239s] it. No big deal. Okay. QXO again. This
[5048.48s] has been a double. Now it&#39;s back to 22
[5051.36s] from $25. Relax. Brad Jacobs is going to
[5054.719s] be doing more deals. There&#39;s no question
[5056.56s] about it. They&#39;ve explicitly told you
[5058.08s] that&#39;s what they&#39;re going to do. Um
[5061.12s] Stanley Black &amp; Decker again up to 70
[5063.84s] from 53. Hasn&#39;t even begun. I mean, this
[5066.8s] looks almost picture for picture what it
[5070.0s] looked like in the early 2000s, which is
[5071.6s] an analog we&#39;ve drawn on a lot of
[5072.96s] reasons. They get this final spike down
[5075.76s] and to get absolutely everyone out of
[5078.08s] the 125year stock. They think a hammer
[5080.96s] company is going out of business. You
[5082.4s] can&#39;t make this up. Okay. And then
[5084.639s] what happens? They run it straight up
[5086.159s] the flag pole 3x. Watch what happens
[5089.199s] over the next 6 to 12 months when the
[5093.44s] new land comes online. When the 10-year
[5095.84s] yields at 375, when mortgage rates are
[5098.56s] at 59, this thing&#39;s going to go to 140
[5101.12s] before you can even blink an eye. And
[5103.28s] people are saying, &quot;Is it overbought?&quot;
[5104.56s] Because it&#39;s up 50% in two weeks.
[5107.76s] So, I&#39;m I&#39;m it sounds like I&#39;m being
[5111.52s] tough, but I&#39;m trying to drill down a
[5113.92s] lesson that if you get it, this is this
[5116.4s] is a perfect example. VF Corp., okay,
[5119.679s] this you cannot make up. Go to a store
[5121.76s] and see all the action that&#39;s going on.
[5124.08s] go see the new product that&#39;s in there
[5126.8s] by the van way. Vans is just one part of
[5128.719s] the business, but he&#39;s going to turn it.
[5130.239s] This is exactly what it did in the early
[5132.4s] 2000s when everyone was chasing shiny
[5134.239s] objects. This thing ran down and then it
[5136.4s] runs right up, gets everyone in, pulls
[5139.52s] right back down, scares everyone. This
[5141.28s] time it was tariffs. They were afraid of
[5143.12s] $150. All you need to do is look at PPI
[5145.6s] and CPI to realize that tariffs had zero
[5147.92s] impact or very little impact. Um and uh
[5151.679s] and this thing will be back over $50 in
[5154.48s] a reasonable amount of time, a couple of
[5156.56s] years. And everyone will say, &quot;What
[5157.76s] happened?&quot; Well, what happened was Tom
[5159.76s] and Co. Great Hill Capital has been
[5161.52s] buying every effing share that&#39;s been
[5163.679s] offered on the market for the last three
[5165.44s] weeks that we could get our hands on.
[5167.199s] While everyone else is saying, &quot;Uh,
[5169.28s] could you look at their balance sheet? I
[5171.12s] think they&#39;re still leveraged.&quot;
[5172.48s] Meanwhile,
[5174.32s] they just sold Supreme and paid down $
[5176.08s] 1.5 billion of debt. They got other
[5178.239s] assets they can sell if they need to.
[5180.719s] They&#39;re going to be just fine. Bracken
[5182.8s] knows exactly what he&#39;s doing and we&#39;re
[5184.32s] betting on the jockey.
[5187.28s] Um, so what else you want to talk about?
[5189.76s] We&#39;re done. No, I&#39;m kidding. We&#39;re just
[5191.52s] getting started. We got a lot to cover.
[5193.12s] 300. Uh, I got to All right, so let&#39;s
[5196.88s] get going here. Look, I&#39;ve been up for
[5198.48s] 24 hours. I can go all day long. So, all
[5200.96s] right. So, here people shorting in the
[5202.88s] hole. Hedge funds are doing what?
[5204.239s] They&#39;re shorting at the exact wrong time
[5205.84s] just like they do every time when you
[5207.6s] see these extremes. Small caps are going
[5209.12s] to keep running. Big rotation. What&#39;s
[5211.199s] not worked the first half? Energy
[5212.639s] healthcare discretionary. What&#39;s working
[5214.239s] the most in the beginning of the second
[5215.679s] half? Energy healthcare discretionary.
[5218.32s] So you know that your discretionary are
[5220.0s] your VF corps, your advanced auto parts,
[5222.48s] your Canada goosees, all the stuff that
[5224.8s] you couldn&#39;t give away. Now consumer
[5227.12s] confidence is coming back. That&#39;s where
[5228.4s] it&#39;s going to be. What did everyone bet
[5229.92s] on in the first half? Comm services
[5232.0s] financials. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going
[5233.52s] to perform nearly as well in the second
[5235.6s] half. Uh large cap value relative price
[5239.84s] index versus the US dollar.
[5243.84s] So you can see that as you invert the
[5247.6s] dollar. So the dollar is weakening
[5252.88s] and
[5255.44s] as the dollar
[5259.28s] weakened
[5263.12s] Russell 1000 large cap value.
[5268.32s] So you could see here as the dollar
[5270.48s] weakened inverted which would mean the
[5272.56s] red line goes up is the dollar weakening
[5274.96s] you saw value start to dramatically
[5276.96s] outperform
[5278.96s] uh the S&amp;P which is basically growth
[5281.04s] because it&#39;s cap um cap weighted
[5284.8s] and that&#39;s what we&#39;re starting to see uh
[5287.44s] now we should start to see and it works
[5289.12s] on a lag basis as you can see here as
[5290.96s] well. QXO got upgraded this week. Price
[5293.76s] target $33 by city. Customs duties, we
[5297.6s] talked about it in the hits record $27
[5300.56s] billion collected. S&amp;P500 following Zwag
[5304.48s] breath thrust signals 1957 to date. They
[5307.6s] tend to persist for a long time. Um,
[5316.96s] average home price is going down by the
[5319.76s] way. affordability is going up.
[5330.239s] Defensive big snack stocks, you know, I
[5333.12s] talked to some people that are in this
[5334.4s] business
[5336.159s] with major companies and their view
[5338.48s] across the board, whether it&#39;s alcohol,
[5340.32s] chips, candy, etc., big big companies is
[5344.32s] that
[5346.08s] what&#39;s the the the perceived impact from
[5350.0s] GLPs and other things um troughed a
[5354.32s] couple of quarters ago and now the
[5356.48s] volumes are starting to recover. So I
[5359.36s] think you&#39;re going to see an enormous
[5360.639s] amount of value in alcohol stocks, candy
[5363.92s] stocks, junk food stocks, packaged food
[5366.159s] stocks, all that stuff. that noise is
[5368.96s] over and I think there&#39;s going to be a
[5370.719s] period of volatility that defenses will
[5372.88s] start to out form and you&#39;re going to be
[5374.56s] able to buy some of this stuff really
[5376.56s] really inexpensively right now to take
[5378.4s] advantage of that.
[5382.0s] Um
[5384.8s] inflation break evens are back down.
[5386.56s] That&#39;s from Fundstrat
[5388.719s] too exposed to stocks. National
[5390.48s] Association of Active Investment
[5391.76s] Managers. So this shows that could
[5393.52s] potentially have some short-term
[5394.88s] consolidation. They&#39;re chasing up now.
[5397.92s] Um, what I don&#39;t love about this one
[5402.32s] is it doesn&#39;t go back to 2000 where this
[5405.44s] was elevated for a while and the market
[5407.44s] just kept going up and up and up. You
[5409.28s] could almost think of it like this. Like
[5412.32s] this is the first bite here, spike off a
[5415.04s] trough that we&#39;re having here off this
[5417.52s] big trough and people are doing this.
[5419.679s] Why isn&#39;t he pointing to this? Why is he
[5421.44s] only pointing to this to to make his
[5423.04s] point? And I think you&#39;re probably
[5425.36s] closer to this based on just what I look
[5427.44s] under the surface. If I look at the S&amp;P,
[5429.6s] I say, &quot;Oh, this looks like it&#39;s
[5430.8s] frothy.&quot; But if I look at do work, you
[5434.48s] know, emerging markets, this is going to
[5436.08s] break through here and this is going to
[5437.28s] be a huge thing along with small caps.
[5439.84s] Um,
[5444.639s] macro conditions getting easy. Hasn&#39;t
[5447.6s] been this easy since the beginning of
[5451.04s] 2024, which was a good period. the
[5453.6s] beginning of uh July of 2020 when they
[5457.199s] really eased things and the market kept
[5458.719s] going even though it was overbought.
[5460.639s] Same with 16, same with 14. So, you got
[5463.76s] to be open-minded. Uh 7.1 trillion in
[5466.639s] money markets. I know Acman had a tweet
[5469.199s] out this week bullish. Um yeah, look, a
[5472.56s] lot of people are bullish that were
[5474.08s] bearish in the hole. So, you do have to
[5476.32s] be alert, but that&#39;s why we try to just
[5479.199s] again look under the surface, zoom out.
[5481.84s] Yeah, we could be shortterm a little
[5483.44s] bit, but on a name by-name basis, I
[5486.48s] think these things are going to run
[5487.52s] because the managers that missed it,
[5490.239s] which is 90 literally 90% of in
[5493.76s] institutional managers, uh they&#39;re going
[5496.0s] to they have to buy the lagards now.
[5497.679s] They have to catch up.
[5504.719s] Vanguard&#39;s
[5506.32s] outlook for financial markets completely
[5508.4s] worthless. um they serviced our
[5512.96s] uh p pension in Ridgefield, Connecticut
[5515.76s] when I served on the pension commission
[5517.04s] for 7 years. They were wrong every
[5518.719s] single year. It was comical. I used it
[5520.4s] to like as Tinder to help light the fire
[5522.719s] in the in the fireplace when we had
[5524.719s] guests over to the house. Uh small cap
[5527.199s] versus large cap.
[5530.239s] Small outperforms large since March of
[5533.679s] this year.
[5538.4s] UK starting to outperform US.
[5542.159s] All the things clicking into place.
[5544.48s] Stable coins could become a significant
[5546.159s] new source of demand for treasuries.
[5547.6s] We&#39;ve covered that.
[5549.679s] CPI follows a string of soft releases.
[5551.76s] We covered that. Five months in a row
[5553.199s] below expectations, lower than before
[5555.12s] tariffs. We expect modest affordability
[5557.92s] relief over the next two years. Who&#39;s
[5559.6s] this from Goldman Sachs?
[5562.88s] Uh, another clue. who are going higher
[5564.88s] from Carson.
[5568.159s] Oh, we covered this three-month gain.
[5570.0s] That&#39;s Ryan Carson over at Dietrich
[5574.56s] up
[5576.88s] returns after three-month rally up
[5578.88s] 22.3%.
[5581.28s] V control equity exposure
[5585.04s] forced into chasing the squeeze. We&#39;ve
[5587.04s] covered that in past weeks. Share of
[5589.12s] young adults living with parents stayed
[5590.96s] the same in 2024. This is sad. This is
[5594.96s] Jay Powell and co. Uh, this chart alone
[5599.12s] should be enough to fire him for cause,
[5601.199s] but he&#39;s going to sit in the seat. So,
[5603.04s] they should just name the next person.
[5604.96s] Name a dovish person. Let the market
[5606.639s] price it in. If he wants to show up to
[5608.159s] work and get free coffee for 9 months,
[5609.92s] let him do it. Um, S&amp;P 500 dividend
[5613.679s] yield plus treasury yield.
[5620.8s] So on a lagging basis, yield should be
[5623.84s] going up here or dividend yield should
[5626.56s] be going up or treasury yield should be
[5627.84s] coming down. I think both are going to
[5629.28s] happen. I think they&#39;re going to be in
[5630.4s] the middle.
[5632.0s] Spending growth in the Bank of America
[5634.48s] credit card data picked up in June
[5636.32s] across all major categories. So that&#39;s
[5639.199s] good to see. Um led by home improvement,
[5642.639s] by the way. That&#39;s really interesting.
[5644.239s] Clothing very good. General merchandise,
[5649.36s] lodging was down a little bit,
[5650.719s] restaurants were up,
[5654.0s] Dow Jones transportation average. This
[5655.76s] is not the type of formation, if you&#39;re
[5657.44s] a chartist, that you see at market tops.
[5661.12s] This is what you see before breakouts.
[5663.36s] And um yeah, we should be paying
[5666.88s] attention to FedEx and UPS with a chart
[5668.88s] like this. We already have Boeing, so
[5670.56s] that&#39;s good. Maybe start to look at some
[5672.32s] of the railroads, Estee Lauder
[5674.4s] Companies. What&#39;s this? Um, upgraded
[5678.639s] opinion follows trend. The thing runs
[5680.4s] from 60 to 80. Now they upgrade it to
[5683.04s] 110. Buy rating 30% upside potential
[5687.199s] after it ran from 50 to 85. So now you
[5689.44s] understand how the game works, how sell
[5692.48s] analysts keep their jobs.
[5695.52s] Big ticket spending, new vehicles
[5699.199s] through the roof.
[5701.76s] Through the roof. That&#39;s going to
[5703.36s] continue.
[5710.96s] valuation signal stronger price returns
[5713.36s] for the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 than the
[5715.28s] cap weighted couldn&#39;t agree more.
[5718.88s] Value ma valuation matters little in the
[5721.199s] near term but is almost all that matters
[5724.4s] in the long term.
[5727.36s] price to normalize earnings predictive
[5729.199s] power on subsequent holding period
[5730.8s] returns since 1987.
[5735.44s] Consensus expects 4% earnings growth in
[5738.239s] 2Q.
[5740.8s] This is what I talked about. Secret to
[5742.48s] happiness is low expectations. Bar has
[5744.4s] been brought down from 9.8 to four and
[5747.12s] change. We&#39;ll beat by three or 400 basis
[5749.44s] points and that should be fuel for
[5751.92s] things to push a little bit higher in
[5753.52s] coming weeks.
[5756.0s] percent of stocks above the
[5761.76s] 20day moving average.
[5769.679s] All right. Well, that&#39;s, you know,
[5771.36s] that&#39;s what you see in long-term
[5773.199s] doorbell rallies, especially coming off
[5775.36s] the lows. See, this is where, and this
[5776.8s] is where people get faked out. So, right
[5779.199s] here that you had a V-shaped recovery in
[5781.76s] COVID looked like we were overbought.
[5783.52s] They did consolidate a little bit. Uh,
[5785.92s] and then you got these number of days
[5787.6s] above 20-day moving average, but it was
[5790.32s] only halfway through the rally. When you
[5791.84s] come off these V&#39;s,
[5794.32s] just like up here, it tends to persist.
[5797.44s] That&#39;s why I&#39;m saying don&#39;t get too cute
[5799.36s] here. If we were in a range, you&#39;d all
[5800.96s] be right about your overbought signals
[5802.48s] or whatever technical indicators you&#39;re
[5804.56s] looking at and think you have an edge
[5805.84s] that no one else is looking at it. Like
[5807.92s] the edge is knowing what everyone else
[5809.52s] consensus has from those indicators and
[5811.679s] actually doing the opposite. But um
[5815.6s] but especially on V-shaped recoveries,
[5817.52s] you got to be super careful.
[5821.76s] Rising home prices and stock prices
[5823.44s] boost households.
[5827.04s] Magnificent 7 total returns year-to-
[5829.199s] date. Tesla down 22%, Apple down 15%,
[5833.36s] Google down 4%, Amazon basically
[5835.84s] flatline, S&amp;P now up 7%. I mean that&#39;s
[5840.08s] uh joke. So Microsoft is held up, Meta
[5843.36s] is held up, and Nvidia&#39;s held up.
[5851.52s] Recession odds in
[5854.48s] 2025 versus forward price to earnings.
[5880.639s] Single stock put call skew shows
[5883.36s] balanced positioning among short-term
[5885.36s] hedge fund and retail traders. We expect
[5887.199s] positioning to neither be a headwind nor
[5889.679s] a tailwind this earning season. So
[5891.52s] earnings is the name of the game. It&#39;s a
[5893.44s] coin flip and with expectations so low,
[5895.679s] it probably resolves a bit higher.
[5897.679s] Chinese exports reach record high in
[5900.56s] first six months of the year. Record
[5902.48s] high. Not in the headlines. Boeing&#39;s
[5905.119s] China jet deliveries are rising on the
[5907.6s] trade thaw. Another thing no one&#39;s
[5909.84s] paying attention to. China&#39;s economy
[5912.08s] maintains strong growth in the second
[5913.679s] quarter, 5.2% by the way. And everyone&#39;s
[5917.199s] saying, &quot;Wow, they&#39;re slowing.&quot; 5 When&#39;s
[5919.199s] the last time we saw 5.2%. ch stocks
[5922.159s] shine when sector strength is all or
[5924.32s] nothing.
[5926.239s] Again, look at this
[5929.199s] instance coming out of such a thaw. You
[5931.119s] get to this quote unquote overbought.
[5933.04s] It&#39;s the beginning of the rally, not the
[5934.56s] end. When you come out of these dramatic
[5936.56s] draw downs, it&#39;s the beginning. Doesn&#39;t
[5938.48s] mean you don&#39;t get a little
[5939.36s] consolidation. It&#39;s the beginning.
[5941.679s] Consolidation. Sure, we could get some
[5943.6s] consolidation. Uh I think more likely
[5946.56s] we&#39;re going to push higher and then
[5948.8s] consolidate to the breakout level
[5951.199s] similar to what we saw. So you know
[5953.76s] we&#39;ll shoot well above to new time highs
[5956.239s] and then come back and and test it
[5958.08s] before kind of consolidating for a
[5960.159s] while. Prime book consumer staples
[5964.08s] allocation to European equities rises to
[5966.4s] 4year high. So probably a little
[5968.719s] pullback in that soon. Short dollar
[5971.04s] becomes the most crowded trade for the
[5972.8s] first time. Of course, we get the
[5974.159s] counter trend bounce we&#39;ve been talking
[5975.6s] about. FMS cash level drops to 3.9
[5978.719s] triggering sell signal. This was the
[5980.96s] only thing I&#39;ve ever seen Hartnet do
[5982.88s] wrong because if you actually put all of
[5985.84s] his other quote unquote sell signals up,
[5988.4s] they&#39;re actually kind of bullish um or
[5992.159s] mixed at best. And I think Zakardi did
[5994.88s] it. Mike Zakardi um someone else did it.
[5998.48s] I Jeff missed that chart, but um this is
[6001.92s] not indicative particularly when it
[6003.44s] immediately when it first immediately
[6005.36s] gets there. Biggest three-month rise in
[6007.84s] risk appetite on record. Okay. But um so
[6012.719s] this was a little bit of a no January
[6015.04s] 2001 was not January 2002. So that ran
[6017.6s] another year after that. This one ran
[6020.719s] another two years uh uh January 2013.
[6024.719s] June 2009, totally overbought and it ran
[6027.92s] another two years. January, 2002, again,
[6032.159s] totally overbought in sentiment, ran
[6033.76s] another two years. It&#39;s called the
[6035.44s] catchup, the catchup trade. The catch-up
[6038.239s] trade.
[6041.44s] Uh, Americans now spend more on
[6043.36s] healthcare than groceries or housing.
[6044.8s] That kind of makes sense in terms of the
[6046.719s] age of the population and what&#39;s
[6048.56s] happened to
[6050.48s] different inflation of products which I
[6052.8s] think Trump is going to continue to uh
[6054.8s] to work on asset managers plus hedge
[6057.199s] fund managers net positioning. So,
[6060.0s] they&#39;ve been so underweight as the
[6061.76s] markets moved up, which is what what
[6063.6s] makes me think that we, you know, even
[6066.56s] get a pullback, we&#39;re going to keep
[6067.679s] pushing higher and force them back in.
[6077.28s] There&#39;s a pony in the healthc care p
[6079.119s] pile. This is from Ned Davis Research.
[6083.6s] Hyperscaler Capex, Wall Street
[6087.44s] International Bank. Uh, Wall Street
[6088.96s] international banks upgrade China GDP
[6091.44s] outlook. Previous forecast
[6094.56s] was 4.1. Now it&#39;s up to 5.1. Wow, that&#39;s
[6097.84s] a huge upgrade. UBS similar. Morgan
[6101.04s] Stanley upgrades them. They&#39;re all
[6102.8s] pushing towards five. They were all
[6104.639s] below four and a half and below. Um,
[6108.719s] Goldman even went up and SCB went up
[6111.6s] huge.
[6113.52s] Hang near its highest since 2022.
[6116.639s] Mainland China investors have been
[6117.92s] buyers of Hong Kong stocks. Home price
[6120.4s] inflection point.
[6125.92s] New highs happen in clusters. We&#39;re not
[6127.6s] seeing that clustering yet. So, that&#39;s
[6129.04s] going to keep happening. Total short
[6131.28s] interest again really elevated towards
[6134.159s] what you see at lows, not highs.
[6138.159s] We&#39;ve seen some value areas outperformed
[6140.159s] magnificent. By the way, one of the
[6142.159s] things that we always like to look at is
[6143.84s] skew. And I would say there&#39;s nothing at
[6147.28s] the moment about skew that makes me
[6149.6s] worry about a big 10% plus move. I&#39;d be
[6153.44s] more concerned when it&#39;s up above 150
[6156.8s] and the market keeps pushing higher.
[6159.119s] It&#39;s it&#39;s getting maybe in maybe in four
[6161.84s] four to six four to eight weeks it&#39;ll be
[6165.04s] up at that level when everyone&#39;s super
[6167.199s] pulled in and everyone&#39;s super
[6168.88s] complacent.
[6170.48s] uh and the smart ones have bought
[6172.4s] catastro catastrophe insurance which is
[6174.719s] basically what skew measures 10% outside
[6176.96s] of uh two standard deviation move
[6179.84s] downward. Um then I then I&#39;d start to
[6182.48s] get cautious and and if skew goes there
[6184.56s] implied volatility is going to be super
[6186.239s] down which means it&#39;ll be super cheap to
[6188.639s] buy insurance and at which time we&#39;d
[6190.48s] probably put a little bit on.
[6193.52s] Okay, let&#39;s get back to it.
[6198.239s] streaks of weaker than expected core
[6200.239s] CPI. Oh, we covered this five in a row.
[6206.88s] ETF flows since April 8th low. It&#39;s gone
[6211.36s] into crypto and value. That&#39;s pretty
[6214.159s] wild. Value even more than growth.
[6218.32s] T bills.
[6220.719s] What has it gone out of? Levered long
[6224.32s] small caps.
[6227.28s] China.
[6229.04s] So, these are the ones where you&#39;re
[6231.119s] going to get juice in the next move.
[6233.84s] China small cap. These probably actually
[6236.56s] take a breather.
[6241.44s] H, who&#39;s that from?
[6244.8s] What&#39;s the source? We need sources for
[6246.48s] everything. Oh, Todd S. Okay. Retail
[6249.679s] activity has increased to the highest
[6251.76s] level since 2018.
[6255.52s] Yeah, but look, look, they were the ones
[6257.44s] buying in 2020 as well. Like I said,
[6259.76s] they&#39;ve been right since COVID. Retail
[6261.92s] institutional investors have been wrong.
[6265.52s] So, I view this as a good sign, not a
[6268.239s] bad sign. Historically, that wasn&#39;t the
[6269.84s] case, but since CO, they&#39;ve been right.
[6275.84s] US equity sentiment indicator flatline.
[6278.239s] Not extreme. Flatline, ladies and
[6280.32s] gentlemen.
[6284.639s] Oh, I like this. Summer sales event. 0%
[6287.6s] limited term APR finance. 0% down
[6290.4s] payment. Zero payments for 90 days.
[6294.4s] And it&#39;s no wonder that sales were up
[6296.56s] 70%.
[6298.48s] Here we go. Ford stores are absolutely
[6300.8s] ripping right now. This is from car
[6302.48s] dealership guy. Apparently, the new
[6304.08s] marketing programs are working. Blocked
[6306.4s] out the name. We were up 70% last month
[6308.96s] in Ford sales at our Ford store. the
[6310.96s] largest increase of any large store in
[6313.199s] the market. I think this new program
[6314.96s] that Ford launched 0000 is going to be
[6317.119s] massive. It&#39;s all about low upfront
[6318.88s] costs and getting that 0%.
[6324.32s] Beigebook mentions of slow and
[6326.32s] inflation. Inflation mentions have gone
[6328.88s] way down. Inventions of slow have gone
[6332.48s] up. And that&#39;s what need Powell needs to
[6334.48s] be focused on
[6337.04s] not his memoir S&amp;P cycle composite for
[6340.4s] 2025.
[6346.639s] This is from Ned David Research.
[6350.719s] So the implication is that it pushes
[6353.84s] higher into August, consolidates
[6356.159s] sideways until midocctober and then
[6358.96s] resolves higher for year end. I think
[6360.88s] this is a reasonable frame framework to
[6362.8s] look at. That&#39;s kind of how I&#39;m thinking
[6364.159s] about it. It just feels like we got more
[6365.84s] here because everyone thinks we can&#39;t
[6368.08s] and then you will absorb it, but I don&#39;t
[6370.48s] think you&#39;re going to get those massive.
[6371.679s] We got our 20% correction of the year. I
[6374.159s] don&#39;t think we&#39;re getting another one
[6375.199s] this fall. So, this will be like buy
[6377.679s] stuff under the surface and ride into
[6379.6s] the sunset into year end.
[6382.88s] Retail sales rebound in June as
[6385.44s] expected.
[6387.119s] PPI, this is a leading indicator, came
[6390.48s] in at 0.0 month. Year-on-year was lower
[6394.159s] than expected.
[6396.639s] Affordability gap is crazy town. Got to
[6400.88s] bring the rates down.
[6412.08s] S&amp;P 500 returns after new all-time highs
[6414.88s] 1990 to present. One year later up
[6416.8s] 11.6%.
[6418.88s] Percentage of overbought and overstocks
[6420.56s] sold stocks. This is from bespoke,
[6436.32s] showing less overbought. Okay, some
[6438.48s] news. Trump&#39;s U-turn on Nvidia spurs
[6441.199s] talk of grand bargain with China. This
[6443.52s] is a big deal. Uh, Trump softens tone on
[6447.04s] China to secure Xi summit and a trade
[6449.84s] deal. Wait till you see what Baba does
[6452.639s] if they when they get that thing done.
[6454.719s] China&#39;s new consumers don&#39;t want a
[6458.48s] house, they want lab boooo and bubble
[6461.76s] tea.
[6468.4s] So they want consumerism, which is great
[6470.719s] for Tao and T- mall.
[6478.08s] Wall Street banks lift China growth
[6479.6s] outlook after brighter quarter. Nvidia
[6482.32s] says US has lifted restrictions on AI
[6484.48s] chip sales to China. That&#39;s the H20. Xi
[6487.84s] signals China may finally tackle
[6489.6s] deflationary price wars.
[6492.4s] Uh so there was a race to the bottom in
[6494.239s] the delivery business which I think is a
[6495.76s] garbage business. Anyway, Baba
[6498.239s] participates in it but it&#39;s it&#39;s not
[6500.639s] meaningful.
[6503.52s] Um, so that&#39;s good.
[6507.28s] US home prices are losing steam with
[6509.199s] most big markets below peak. That&#39;s
[6511.76s] actually positive. Trump tax law is
[6514.159s] surprise boon for affordable housing
[6517.04s] creation.
[6524.8s] tax and spending law makes significant
[6526.48s] changes to the lowincome housing tax
[6528.4s] credit, the new markets tax credit and
[6530.719s] opportunity zones, which are expected to
[6532.239s] spur construction of new apartment
[6534.08s] buildings and renovation of older ones,
[6537.6s] positive development and addressing the
[6539.28s] housing affordability crisis. But some
[6540.96s] experts say Jeff
[6545.119s] All right, so you can read that over
[6547.199s] Bloomberg. A second push for Mikey&#39;s
[6549.04s] federal land sales.
[6553.92s] They&#39;re going to get that the federal
[6555.52s] lands open one way or another. Feds
[6558.0s] Waller doubles down on July rate cut.
[6560.0s] It&#39;s not political.
[6562.8s] Crypto regulation bills move forward
[6565.119s] after record setting. House vote. Stable
[6568.48s] coins helps PayPal sixth largest issuer
[6570.88s] stable coins. Helps demand for
[6572.159s] treasuries. Lower rates helps housing
[6574.239s] 16% of the economy. Market rotation puts
[6577.28s] shine on S&amp;P 500 losers as winners
[6580.239s] trail.
[6583.84s] Investors are taking profits and
[6585.28s] pivoting into underperforming sectors
[6587.36s] fueling a reversal in US equities.
[6590.4s] Some themes have gone a bit too far.
[6592.159s] Seems like we&#39;re on the cusp of at least
[6593.679s] some profit taking but could turn into a
[6596.159s] full reversal. Stretch valuations are
[6597.84s] partly to blame for the rotation.
[6601.119s] This is what I said. They missed it.
[6602.96s] They&#39;re buying the lagards and that&#39;s
[6604.88s] where we&#39;re going to benefit. That&#39;s why
[6606.0s] it&#39;s like, well, which specific company
[6608.239s] that that we own together do you think
[6610.88s] is trading well above intrinsic value
[6613.76s] and we should sell? And the answer is
[6615.92s] zero or we would have sold them already.
[6618.48s] Bank of America says toy sentiment to
[6620.4s] spark rotation, not retreat. I like
[6623.84s] that. That&#39;s probably hardnet. He&#39;s a
[6625.6s] smart guy. I don&#39;t subscribe to Reuters,
[6627.44s] though. All right. Battered dollar a
[6630.32s] boon for US multinational companies.
[6632.239s] That&#39;s going to be reflected in second
[6633.52s] half earnings, which we&#39;ve been saying
[6634.8s] since Q1. Guinness owner Dagio to
[6638.0s] replace chief executive Deborah Crew.
[6640.32s] Thank God. Way too long to make that
[6642.8s] decision. Um,
[6646.159s] Estee Lauder, a late digital adopter,
[6648.239s] makes new push to reach shoppers online.
[6651.36s] That&#39;s why my daughters are talking
[6652.88s] about some of their brands at 11 and 13.
[6656.08s] Good ages for them to be targeted. I
[6658.48s] mean, you know, from a business
[6660.56s] standpoint, from a kid, they shouldn&#39;t
[6661.92s] even have a phone, but whatever. That&#39;s
[6663.36s] not all right. We&#39;ll talk about that
[6665.76s] another time. Trump to unveil 70 billion
[6668.48s] AI and energy investments. US tariff
[6671.52s] revenue climbs to fresh record for
[6673.52s] single fiscal year. Create we had a
[6675.6s] budget surplus last month, by the way,
[6677.6s] of 27 billion.
[6680.32s] First time in ages. Amazon Prime Day
[6682.56s] fuels 30.3% rise in US online spending.
[6687.52s] hardly the sign of a flagging economy.
[6690.0s] Uh there&#39;s a pony in this pile stock
[6691.92s] market and sentiment results. So for we
[6694.8s] didn&#39;t get you bracken and we didn&#39;t get
[6696.56s] you Brad for number 300, but we did get
[6699.84s] you a new name. Um so let&#39;s get to it
[6703.679s] here.
[6705.599s] First off, the fund manager survey. We
[6708.88s] put out a summary, the monthly Bank of
[6711.04s] America fund manager survey. Here are
[6712.56s] the five key points. Uh we covered the
[6714.88s] sell signal, so we&#39;ll skip over that.
[6716.8s] Second opinion follows trend. Allocation
[6718.639s] to European equities has climbed to a
[6720.239s] 4-year high with 41% of managers net
[6722.96s] overweight up from near 1% in January.
[6725.28s] We were we were on an island with that
[6727.44s] call heading into the year as part of
[6728.96s] our last Shelby first thesis pounding
[6730.48s] the table on international out
[6731.599s] performance thanks to a weaker dollar.
[6734.08s] Uh so you see more and more of that.
[6736.56s] This runs in cycles. We&#39;ll continue to
[6738.639s] cover this until you guys see that
[6741.119s] getting stuck in recency bias is
[6745.599s] not zooming out. When you zoom out, you
[6747.76s] see these trends where you can make
[6749.44s] fortunes if you pay attention. Uh three,
[6753.119s] 81% of managers now expect at least one
[6755.199s] rate cut, 47% expecting two. 42% of
[6758.96s] managers expect Q2 earnings to surprise
[6761.36s] to the upside. This has been a theme
[6762.639s] we&#39;ve been talking about recent weeks.
[6763.92s] bar hasn&#39;t been this low for quarterly
[6765.76s] earnings in nearly two years with
[6766.96s] estimates cut to just 4.8 from 9.3
[6769.119s] earlier in the year. Yet another
[6770.48s] catalyst for the upside. Number five,
[6772.56s] now that the dollar&#39;s had its worst
[6774.0s] start to the year in 50 years, short the
[6775.92s] dollar is the most crowded trade for the
[6778.08s] first time ever. And just as you&#39;d
[6780.159s] expect when a dollar trade becomes
[6781.84s] obvious and the Johnny come lately pile
[6783.76s] in, the market does what it always does
[6786.48s] and flushes them out with the dollar
[6788.08s] seeing a solid short-term bounce off the
[6790.239s] lows over the past two weeks. National
[6793.44s] Oil Wellvarco. Each week we try to cover
[6795.36s] one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in
[6796.8s] previous podcast videocasts and or owned
[6798.96s] for clients including personally.
[6802.08s] So you can see we haven&#39;t seen these
[6803.52s] levels, you know, basically going back
[6805.599s] to the early 2000s. But what are we
[6807.52s] looking at? We&#39;re looking at cash flow
[6809.76s] reaceleration, revenue reaceleration,
[6812.719s] return on invested capital
[6814.159s] reaceleration, margin reaceleration, and
[6816.56s] debt deceleration. What about share
[6819.199s] count? Deceleration in share count
[6822.4s] margin acceleration. And yet you can&#39;t
[6824.719s] give this away. There&#39;s a pony in this
[6826.239s] pile. The joke comes concerns twin boys
[6828.56s] of five or six worried that the boys had
[6830.8s] developed extreme personalities. One was
[6832.4s] a total pessimist. The other was a total
[6834.0s] optimist. Their parents took them to a
[6835.52s] psychiatrist. First, the psychiatrist
[6838.0s] treated the pessimist. Trying to
[6839.36s] brighten his outlook. The psychiatrist
[6841.119s] took him to a room piled to the ceiling
[6842.639s] with brand new toys. But instead of
[6844.08s] yelping with delight, the little boy
[6845.52s] burst into tears. What&#39;s the matter? the
[6847.119s] psychiatrist asked, baffled. &quot;Don&#39;t you
[6849.52s] want to play with any of the toys?&quot;
[6850.88s] &quot;Yes,&quot; the little boy baldled. &quot;But if I
[6853.599s] did, I&#39;d only break them.&quot; Next, the
[6855.599s] psychiatrist treated the optimist.
[6857.52s] Trying to dampen his outlook, the psych
[6859.36s] psychiatrist took him to a room piled to
[6861.36s] the ceiling with horse manure. But
[6863.36s] instead of wrinkling his nose in
[6864.88s] disgust, the optimist admitted just the
[6867.119s] yelp of delight the psychiatrist had
[6869.92s] been hoping to hear from his brother,
[6871.199s] the pessimist. Then he clamored on top
[6873.76s] of the pile, dropped to his knees, and
[6875.679s] began gleefully digging out scoop after
[6878.239s] scoop with his bare hands. &quot;What do you
[6880.4s] think you&#39;re doing?&quot; the psychiatrist
[6881.84s] asked, just as baffled by the optimist
[6883.92s] as he had been by the pessimist. &quot;With
[6885.92s] all this manure,&quot; the little boy
[6887.36s] replied, beaming, &quot;There must be a pony
[6889.679s] in here somewhere.&quot;
[6892.08s] &quot;So, uh, so that&#39;s what we got with
[6894.48s] National Oil Well, Varco in the oil
[6897.04s] sector.
[6898.56s] It&#39;s definitely a pile and we&#39;re going
[6900.32s] to find that pony as we did with com
[6902.239s] stock resources. There are many
[6903.679s] parallels between this classic pony in
[6905.84s] the pile joke and the energy sector
[6907.28s] right now. The sector has been in the
[6908.56s] doghouse all year posting some of the
[6910.08s] worst returns among all sectors and at
[6912.32s] this point you pretty much can&#39;t give it
[6913.76s] away. In fact, managers are only just
[6916.0s] coming off record low allocation levels
[6917.679s] from May and still net 23% underweight
[6921.36s] the sector. Meanwhile, energy&#39;s weight
[6923.52s] in the S&amp;P 500 has fallen back to
[6925.28s] all-time lows of just 3%, levels we
[6927.28s] haven&#39;t seen since oil went negative
[6929.119s] during the pandemic. That was an
[6931.28s] opportunity we happily took advantage
[6933.119s] of, buying as much Exxon Mobile as we
[6935.52s] could get our hands up on and ended up
[6938.0s] with a multibagger in short order. Those
[6939.84s] of you who are with us back in 2000
[6942.56s] remember us buying Exxon Mobile hand
[6945.599s] overfist at $33. And by 2021, everyone
[6948.8s] wanted it close to $100. and we helped
[6951.28s] them out and it really didn&#39;t do a whole
[6953.36s] lot after that. Um, what makes us
[6955.84s] especially interested is that despite
[6958.639s] being essentially left for dead with
[6960.639s] record low exposure, the sector
[6961.92s] continues to see strong earnings growth
[6963.44s] revisions for 2026. It is now expected
[6965.679s] to deliver the highest growth of any
[6967.679s] sector with estimates calling for 20.8%
[6970.4s] earnings growth, bigger than tech. The
[6973.119s] kind of short-term voting machine versus
[6974.8s] long-term weighing machine divergence is
[6976.48s] music to our ears here at Great Hill
[6978.4s] Capital. And we&#39;ve wasted no time over
[6980.88s] the past couple weeks digging through
[6982.4s] the pile to find our next pony. Comtock
[6984.96s] has been our go-to name for exposure to
[6986.639s] the sector and a huge winner for us. But
[6988.639s] it has hasn&#39;t come down enough to
[6990.4s] justify putting new money to work. We
[6992.4s] then looked at opportunities in the
[6993.84s] exploration and production space. And
[6995.599s] while some names are starting to look
[6997.599s] cheap, they haven&#39;t pulled back enough
[6998.88s] relative to the underlying price of oil.
[7000.639s] But after combing through company after
[7002.56s] company, we finally found what we were
[7004.239s] looking for, our next pony. That brings
[7005.92s] us to our newest position, National Oil
[7007.599s] Well Varco, uh Nov or Nov Inc. I think
[7010.639s] they call themselves now, which we
[7012.32s] revealed during media appearances this
[7014.08s] week. Nov is the largest OEM of rig
[7016.4s] systems, both onshore and offshore oil
[7018.56s] and gas and drilling. They&#39;ve dominated
[7020.48s] more than half the market for over two
[7022.48s] decades and built the largest installed
[7024.159s] base of rig equipment in the industry.
[7026.639s] That positioning has allowed them to tap
[7028.48s] a lucrative aftermarket services
[7030.239s] business,
[7031.76s] creating a recurring high margin revenue
[7033.52s] stream that&#39;s helped somewhat insulate
[7035.04s] the company from usual cyclicality of
[7037.28s] oil and gas prices. Aftermarket now
[7039.36s] accounts for 24% of sales and has been a
[7041.199s] key driver behind the company&#39;s 14
[7042.8s] consecutive quarters of IBIDA margin
[7045.199s] expansion. That kind of topline
[7047.52s] protection offers us highly attractive
[7049.119s] way to gain exposure to production
[7050.48s] without taking massive risk on the
[7052.239s] underlying commodity. On top of that,
[7054.159s] NLV has a rock solid solid balance sheet
[7056.32s] with $1.2 billion of cash, $1.7 billion
[7058.88s] of long-term debt, and the next debt
[7060.719s] maturity, not until 2029. Free cash flow
[7064.239s] is the name of the game in any
[7065.44s] turnaround, and NOV checks all the boxes
[7067.84s] as well, generating nearly $1 billion of
[7070.32s] free cash flow last year while sitting
[7072.159s] on a backlog of more than $4.4 billion.
[7075.28s] So, with the downside well protected,
[7076.88s] the next question is what does the
[7078.08s] upside scenario look like? As we like to
[7080.32s] say, we skate to where the puck is
[7081.679s] going, not where it already has been.
[7083.04s] For the past decade, the oil production
[7084.8s] story has been all about shale. But now,
[7087.119s] with many of those fields plateauing and
[7088.719s] starting to roll over and demand
[7090.08s] slowing, showing no signs of slowing,
[7092.239s] that leaves offshore as the only place
[7094.639s] left for growth thanks to new drilling
[7096.32s] technologies, many of which are credit
[7098.0s] to
[7099.52s] average offshore development. Break even
[7102.0s] costs have dropped from $75 a barrel to
[7104.159s] as low as $40 today. It&#39;s safe to say
[7106.48s] the economics are finally working again.
[7109.119s] Management is already seeing signs. The
[7111.599s] cycle is turning and the trend is
[7113.199s] starting to play out. NOV is tracking 14
[7115.52s] potential FPSO projects, the most in
[7118.0s] three years with as many as 12 awards
[7120.4s] possible in 2025, each representing 100
[7122.639s] million to 700 million in revenue. They
[7124.719s] also expect offshore development capex
[7126.639s] to grow more than 50% from 2025 to 2027
[7130.719s] compared to the 2020 to 2024 average. As
[7134.96s] the cycle turns and more operators call
[7137.04s] up NOV for offshore, which already
[7140.159s] accounts for 45% of their sales, that is
[7142.719s] when operating leverage really starts to
[7144.4s] kick in. At that point, NOV will be
[7146.32s] swimming in more cash than they know
[7147.599s] what to do with. And while we wait for
[7149.36s] the cycle to rebound, they are returning
[7151.44s] at least 50% of the excess free cash
[7154.639s] flow to shareholders through dividends
[7155.92s] and buybacks with a current dividend
[7157.599s] yield of 4.1% and shares outstanding
[7160.48s] down 3.4% over the past year. Meanwhile,
[7163.599s] by the way, 4.1% dividend yield is
[7166.0s] pretty nice. Better than what T bills
[7168.239s] will be and um certainly a lot more
[7171.599s] upside, multiags of upside versus zero
[7174.56s] upside. Meanwhile, the market is still
[7176.4s] pricing NOV as if it&#39;s going out of
[7178.159s] business. The stock trades just over
[7179.76s] four times cash flow. Prices haven&#39;t we
[7182.56s] haven&#39;t seen since the 2001 lows right
[7185.679s] before the stock went on a 10x run. With
[7189.599s] rates coming down in production getting
[7191.04s] more economic uh paired with more
[7193.599s] favorable energy policy, we wouldn&#39;t be
[7195.28s] surprised to see NOV catch a similar
[7197.199s] cycle and go on another multi-bagger
[7199.52s] run. For months now, we&#39;ve been pointing
[7201.84s] out the similarities between today and
[7204.32s] the early 2000s. Whether it&#39;s small
[7205.92s] caps, international stocks, or value
[7207.36s] outperforming. But don&#39;t forget, this
[7209.199s] was also when energy quietly became the
[7211.36s] top performing sector of the decade.
[7213.36s] History does not repeat, but it often
[7214.96s] rhymes. Here&#39;s everything you need to
[7216.88s] know about NLV. So, you can go through
[7219.52s] these decks. We outline the the most
[7221.76s] important parts and the earnings call.
[7225.04s] And you can see on a granular level how
[7227.679s] they make their money and the outlook
[7232.56s] and
[7237.36s] so on and so forth. So you do see
[7239.76s] short-term sentiment is a little bit
[7241.28s] elevated here
[7243.28s] uh with national uh
[7249.36s] uh national active investment managers
[7253.04s] and with retail investors.
[7254.88s] Congratulations to all the new clients
[7256.239s] that came in uh during our Q1, Q2, and
[7259.679s] Q3 2025 raises. You could not be better
[7262.239s] positioned for what we believe will
[7263.52s] continue to be a highly rewarding
[7265.44s] remainder of the year in 2025. This view
[7267.92s] is based on what&#39;s already taken place
[7269.199s] in 2025 as well as much of the data
[7271.44s] we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on our
[7272.639s] podcast coupled with our proprietary
[7274.32s] methods of expressing and executing upon
[7276.639s] those views on your behalf. By the way,
[7278.8s] a lot of new clients have come in like,
[7280.88s] okay, you&#39;ve got a bunch of stocks on.
[7282.8s] Great. You were able to put to work.
[7284.719s] Where&#39;s the special options overlay? We
[7287.28s] will get that on over time because the
[7289.28s] way option pricing works,
[7292.0s] um, it&#39;s less liquid than the stock
[7295.52s] market. So we want to do it on days
[7297.679s] where we can really get bargains. So
[7300.08s] patience with that. Those take a few
[7301.52s] weeks. Uh but we take a long view on
[7303.36s] those and and and yes, we get a lot of
[7305.599s] excess return from from that expression
[7308.32s] and uh you&#39;ll have more expression than
[7311.04s] you know to do with. So uh uh that that
[7314.32s] takes a little longer to to get
[7316.239s] expressed than than the stocks
[7317.76s] themselves. Uh as of last week, our Q3
[7320.32s] raise is officially closed.
[7322.08s] Congratulations. Uh that&#39;s for the small
[7323.84s] accounts, the 1 million to 5 million.
[7326.159s] Congratulations to everyone I had the
[7327.76s] pleasure of speaking with and on
[7329.199s] boarding last week. Most of you have
[7330.88s] already had your applications approved
[7332.239s] by IB and we&#39;ve begun deploying capital
[7334.159s] on your behalf. Uh larger or normal
[7337.04s] account sizes of 5 to 10 million plus
[7338.88s] can still access bespoke service and
[7340.88s] come in when whenever they want by
[7343.04s] clicking there. Um this is opinion not
[7346.159s] advice and not a solicitation. While
[7348.32s] you&#39;re at hedge fun.com, click on terms.
[7352.159s] Uh reat earnings top 30 weights earnings
[7356.08s] estimates have gone up by 4% for this
[7359.119s] year and 1.67%
[7361.52s] next year. Utilities
[7364.159s] uh flattish earnings down 19 basis
[7367.28s] points for this year up 26 basis points
[7369.84s] for next year. uh CPI and PPI both
[7376.96s] came in at levels that the Fed should be
[7379.76s] calling in the case of PPI which is
[7382.32s] leading indicator they should be calling
[7383.679s] emergency meeting and cutting 50 basis
[7385.599s] points. They won&#39;t do that. They&#39;ll wait
[7387.599s] till September and they&#39;ll probably get
[7389.199s] away with it. But I think it will give
[7391.679s] Trump cover to announce his Fed chair
[7396.32s] nominee which will act as a shadow Fed
[7398.88s] and um Powell will just come to the
[7402.0s] office, get free coffee for the next 10
[7403.92s] months. Um earnings still holding up 300
[7408.4s] bucks for next year. And that&#39;s it for
[7411.199s] the podcast. Let&#39;s get to the 300th Ask
[7414.08s] Me Anything questions. So, we got quite
[7417.36s] a bit.
[7419.28s] Um,
[7421.44s] here we go.
[7426.88s] First question.
[7432.159s] Uh, Marcel Bella, only recently
[7434.639s] discovered your podcast. Find it very
[7436.32s] informative and helpful. You mentioned
[7437.52s] farmer is interesting segment at the
[7438.96s] moment. What&#39;s your take on Regeneron?
[7443.92s] I think we covered Regeneron. I kind of
[7446.32s] I&#39;m I don&#39;t buy individual biotech
[7448.48s] stocks, but if I had to, that would be
[7450.48s] definitely one I&#39;d be interested in.
[7452.239s] You&#39;re worried that it didn&#39;t go to 400,
[7453.92s] it&#39;s at 550. I think if you bought it
[7455.52s] here for the long term, you&#39;re going to
[7456.719s] be okay. Um, but again, I I don&#39;t like
[7460.159s] individual biotech stocks. Um, that one
[7462.8s] might be an exception, but I have no
[7464.96s] urgency to buy either that or Biogen,
[7468.56s] which also continues to look attractive.
[7470.96s] Lewis Spzzio, hope you&#39;re doing well.
[7473.52s] wanted to reach out, express my
[7474.719s] gratitude and admiration for the work
[7476.4s] you&#39;re doing for Headphone Tip podcast.
[7477.92s] Been tuning in every week since August
[7479.28s] 24th. Can definitely say it changed my
[7480.96s] life. Thanks to you, I&#39;ve more than
[7482.239s] doubled my initial investment going from
[7483.84s] 22,000 to 45,000 in just one year. My
[7486.32s] dad has been following you longer, over
[7488.159s] two years now, and he&#39;s had backto-back
[7489.679s] years at 30% plus returns. Even my
[7491.599s] girlfriend, who I encouraged to get
[7492.8s] involved, is up over 20%. Made a real
[7494.8s] impact on all this.
[7498.56s] Okay. All right. I&#39;ll get back to you on
[7500.159s] that. He&#39;s asking for a I got it. Okay.
[7504.159s] All right. Well, thank you for the kind
[7505.599s] words. Uh, Guran Story Chickic, uh, love
[7509.599s] the show and all the riches that come
[7511.52s] along. The healthcare sector has dropped
[7513.36s] from 15.9% to 9.3% in S&amp;P. Do you expect
[7518.32s] more carnage? You believe now&#39;s the time
[7519.679s] to find another pony in that pile of
[7522.719s] crap?
[7524.88s] Uh, I think you should get start to get
[7526.719s] healthcare exposure if you don&#39;t have
[7527.84s] any. We like Baxter. Um, there are some
[7530.639s] drug stocks we&#39;re looking at.
[7532.56s] But, uh, you should have a basket of
[7534.719s] biotech now that&#39;s already started to
[7536.8s] take off or started to recover. Um,
[7541.599s] all right. And then he&#39;s talking about
[7543.36s] Tidewater. I don&#39;t like Tidewater is not
[7546.239s] for me. I&#39;m going to just pass on that.
[7549.119s] Um,
[7552.56s] dear Tom, hope you&#39;re doing well.
[7554.56s] Gratitude, admiration. Okay, so that
[7557.92s] one&#39;s that. Got that one already.
[7566.56s] Hi Tom. Uh, this is from Marlo Kadis.
[7570.159s] Been an avid listener for a year now.
[7571.76s] Love the content. As a British investor,
[7573.599s] my main concern is dollar exposure. In
[7575.28s] your opinion, it&#39;s worth holding US
[7577.199s] stocks or better to highly concentrate
[7579.679s] in XUS given the dollar weakness. I
[7582.239s] think most of the dollar weakness you&#39;re
[7583.599s] going to see in the short term is
[7586.239s] already done.
[7588.0s] Um, so I would be buying stocks.
[7592.239s] You&#39;re converting pounds into dollars to
[7594.96s] buy stocks.
[7597.44s] Um,
[7600.159s] I think now is a decent time as any. I
[7602.159s] mean, you can&#39;t get too cute with the
[7603.36s] currency hedging. I I would,
[7606.48s] you know,
[7608.239s] when I was pounding the table to buy
[7609.679s] international was a time to buy
[7610.719s] international. Dollar&#39;s now weakened a
[7612.56s] lot. It&#39;s probably going to have a
[7613.52s] short-term counter trend bounce. But I
[7616.0s] think if you own good companies over
[7617.599s] time, you could hedge out the currency
[7619.44s] if you&#39;re going to get crazy about that.
[7620.8s] I personally wouldn&#39;t do it. Just own
[7622.4s] good companies and and stop worrying
[7624.079s] about the currency stuff. Um Johnny S,
[7631.36s] uh notice you mentioned NOV. What are
[7633.599s] your thoughts on how? Uh I was in
[7635.44s] between both of them. Nov is better. A
[7638.239s] lot better. Borman,
[7642.639s] uh glad to hear your golf game&#39;s going
[7644.239s] well. Would you mind taking a look at
[7645.52s] HBI? Yeah, I&#39;ve looked at it over and
[7647.679s] over. It&#39;s it&#39;s a fine trading vehicle.
[7649.679s] It&#39;s not a great business, but uh it&#39;s
[7652.0s] probably okay. Here, we&#39;ll just take a
[7653.92s] look at it again for the millionth time
[7656.0s] that I&#39;m going to say probably works as
[7658.32s] a trade, but I&#39;m not interested in
[7659.679s] owning it long term.
[7667.119s] Revenues continue to decline. Cash flow
[7669.04s] is declining. Price is declining.
[7670.719s] Margins are going up a little bit.
[7672.32s] What&#39;s the balance sheet look like?
[7688.32s] Yeah, it&#39;s got a lot of debt for that
[7690.0s] small of a business. Two billion to 200
[7692.32s] million in cash. That&#39;s your problem
[7693.679s] right there. Um, probably does okay, but
[7697.04s] I I I wouldn&#39;t take that risk. It&#39;s not
[7698.88s] a it&#39;s not a super high quality
[7700.4s] business.
[7702.159s] Um,
[7705.92s] hey Tom, what&#39;s your take on the August
[7707.36s] 1 Trump deadlines? Market shrugging it
[7709.92s] off. Feels like it&#39;s ignoring them for
[7711.199s] now. Might delay them further. No, he&#39;s
[7714.159s] going to enforce them. They&#39;re going
[7715.599s] into effect if if the t if the countries
[7717.599s] don&#39;t go to the table and the country
[7718.88s] should know that. That&#39;s the way Trump
[7720.639s] goes. He gives you a thing to
[7724.48s] uh to act, but you got to come to the
[7726.239s] table and deal. And a lot of this is
[7728.239s] about the non-tariff barriers, opening
[7730.96s] their countries to our businesses more
[7732.96s] than it is whether we get 10% or 15% or
[7736.4s] 12% or 18% or 30%. It&#39;s to bring them to
[7740.48s] the table. But when they don&#39;t come to
[7742.719s] the table or they come to the table in a
[7744.4s] ridiculous dilotant way, the 30% kicks
[7747.199s] in for 24, 48, 72 uh hours, 7 days, 14
[7752.88s] days, as long as the pain as long as as
[7755.76s] much pain as they need to come to the
[7757.52s] table like big boys and girls and hammer
[7759.76s] out a deal. And um so I&#39;m excited about
[7762.96s] them. I&#39;m not uh fearing them at all. I
[7765.44s] hope they go into effect and then we&#39;ll
[7767.04s] wind up with a better deal for America.
[7768.8s] It may take two days of volatility, but
[7771.36s] it&#39;ll be what it&#39;ll be. Thoughts on
[7772.8s] Rivian? I wouldn&#39;t buy it with your
[7774.239s] money. With the uh
[7777.119s] socialist subsidization of the EV um
[7780.239s] sector over, there&#39;s one last man
[7782.639s] standing. There will always be a niche
[7784.159s] for that business, which will be Tesla.
[7786.8s] The big three are not going to invest in
[7788.639s] that. They&#39;re going to focus on hybrids.
[7790.32s] So, if you want an EV, you&#39;re going to
[7792.0s] buy a Tesla. Uh, Rivian was a, you know,
[7795.04s] fancy car for the Hamptons that, you
[7797.04s] know, people didn&#39;t want to be seen in
[7798.56s] Teslas. They haven&#39;t changed their body
[7800.48s] style in four years. They don&#39;t have the
[7801.92s] money to change it. It was cool when it
[7803.599s] was. It&#39;s toast. It&#39;s roadkill. On to
[7805.92s] the next. Um,
[7808.719s] if you didn&#39;t already have your VF
[7810.239s] position, would you be interested in
[7811.84s] Deckers? No, they don&#39;t have enough
[7813.679s] diversity. VF Corp has a ballast of its
[7816.96s] portfolio.
[7819.119s] Um, unknown. Thoughts on a zeroc coupon
[7822.8s] 30-year treasury to take advantage of
[7824.719s] easing policies? Not interested. Much
[7828.079s] better ways to make money. If rates were
[7830.159s] at 10%, if the if if the Fed funds rate
[7832.56s] was at 15% like 1982, basically buy 30
[7836.4s] 30 years at a 60% discount, invest the
[7838.8s] rest in equities, then you have
[7840.719s] basically zero downside and you lever it
[7843.28s] up. That that&#39;s like the trade of a
[7844.8s] century. Buffett and my first boss were
[7846.719s] doing it hand over fist. The difference
[7848.239s] between Buffett and my boss was that
[7850.32s] Buffett was doing it with no margin and
[7852.56s] my boss was doing it with margin and
[7854.32s] sweating bullets at night, but both of
[7855.84s] them made a ton of money uh and live to
[7858.079s] tell the story. Thanks for your
[7860.32s] perspectives. Was wondering what you
[7861.76s] think of the chemical industry as a
[7863.84s] cyclical pay. We&#39;ve covered it almost
[7865.599s] every week. I like it. Uh, as far as the
[7868.719s] names that you&#39;re talking about, DAO,
[7870.239s] Dupant, Cortiva, Westlake, PPG, um,
[7877.92s] Selines,
[7879.84s] Scots, Miracle Grow. I like to play them
[7881.599s] in different ways than those, but uh,
[7884.48s] you&#39;re on the right track.
[7888.88s] Udit
[7890.719s] anorang. I lr
[7896.88s] I

[7910.96s] icon.
[7914.719s] H.
[7930.59s] [Music]
[7935.679s] revenues holding in. Margins have been
[7937.599s] down for six years. Return on capital
[7940.079s] has been down. They must have done a
[7941.28s] dumb acquisition.
[7943.52s] Uh
[7945.199s] balance sheet
[7952.64s] [Music]
[7964.0s] $3.5 billion of debt, $500 million cash,
[7967.119s] a little bit levered.
[7971.36s] This is probably where it went wrong.
[7972.639s] You can see the jump in revenue. So,
[7974.0s] they did an acquisition that didn&#39;t
[7975.44s] work.
[7977.36s] Usually the sign of an aging CEO that
[7979.52s] wants to keep his job. He bets the whole
[7981.76s] ranch so he gets three three more years
[7983.44s] at the helm.
[7985.28s] Stock price stock share count went up to
[7987.679s] do a stupid deal.
[7990.56s] Um
[7994.96s] see what business they&#39;re in.
[8003.92s] outsource development and clinical
[8005.92s] research.
[8008.48s] Oh, I see.
[8012.32s] I see compound selection.
[8017.679s] Yeah. Uh
[8021.84s] I think this one warrants
[8024.4s] doing some work on.
[8026.8s] I don&#39;t think uh I&#39;m gonna wind up being
[8030.4s] interested in it, but I think it
[8032.159s] definitely checks the boxes to do more
[8034.48s] work on Ger. So, good work, Gerilyn
[8037.84s] Muinx. Copart,
[8041.119s] give me your thought that auto industry
[8042.48s] could boom over the coming years. What
[8043.599s] do you think of Copart?
[8047.199s] I think you&#39;re late. I think you&#39;re
[8048.639s] about 20 years late on Copart.
[8054.56s] This has been a massive compounder.
[8057.199s] Hasn&#39;t come in enough. But no, nothing
[8060.159s] wrong with the business. But um
[8066.719s] you&#39;re not going to make a lot of money
[8069.04s] when you&#39;re buying something that&#39;s
[8070.32s] already perfect.
[8072.48s] You know, it&#39;s like
[8075.76s] I say they don&#39;t give away multiaggers
[8077.52s] for free. I mean, this would probably be
[8079.92s] a multibagger over 10 years. you make
[8082.0s] make 3x, but it&#39;s just a steady
[8084.639s] compounder. This is like, oh, I was
[8086.48s] thinking about putting my money in
[8087.599s] treasuries. Instead, I&#39;m going to buy
[8088.88s] Copart, so I wind up with, you know, two
[8091.36s] or 3x over 10 years. I think that&#39;s
[8093.599s] probably a good way to think about it.
[8095.84s] Um,
[8101.92s] I mean, there aren&#39;t many businesses
[8103.28s] that are better. That&#39;s all I can say.
[8105.119s] That said, it&#39;s like uh you&#39;re a little
[8108.88s] late to the party. Even though it&#39;ll
[8110.4s] keep going up, it&#39;s just higher and
[8113.36s] better uses.
[8123.679s] Jimmy Jones,
[8129.36s] thoughts on the new backer CEO? It&#39;s
[8131.28s] fine. Could only be better than the last
[8132.96s] one. Um,
[8139.52s] uh, actually, no, we went over that one.
[8141.84s] Uh, the new Baxter CEO,
[8144.719s] his last deal was a 5x turnaround.
[8148.56s] Uh, new Baxter
[8152.079s] CEO. We&#39;ll probably spend a lot of
[8154.719s] Andrew Hinder. He came from
[8159.679s] ATP or something.
[8162.239s] ATS. Okay. So, let&#39;s take a look at ATS.
[8180.239s] He got involved in 2017. We covered this
[8182.639s] last week. And the stock went from $6 to
[8184.639s] $48. I like this guy as a turnaround
[8187.04s] specialist. I&#39;m actually very excited
[8188.32s] about him. And I actually bought more
[8189.76s] stock across the board where we could.
[8192.319s] um following this announcement. So,
[8195.28s] don&#39;t don&#39;t ask what I say,
[8198.559s] watch what I do.
[8211.04s] Yeah. So, this guy&#39;s asking me for the
[8212.88s] stocks that I&#39;m going to own for 10
[8214.399s] years. I I I play I don&#39;t know how long
[8217.28s] I&#39;m going to own them. I know where I&#39;m
[8219.599s] going to get out of them. Okay. I do
[8221.439s] turn around. I do recovery business. You
[8223.2s] want to own a stock for five to seven or
[8225.12s] 10 years. Buy Copart and double or
[8227.599s] triple your money slowly over time. But
[8230.16s] as far as um or just buy the S&amp;P. So
[8233.2s] he&#39;s saying because he goes to school
[8234.96s] and he gets loans, they&#39;re not allowed
[8236.24s] to make money. So he just wants the
[8237.76s] stock to hold for the long term. Just
[8239.2s] buy the S&amp;P. I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s easy.
[8242.8s] Uh Marco Stalari
[8259.519s] All right.
[8261.359s] Don&#39;t put three names in one. It&#39;s
[8263.599s] unfair to everyone else. Just one ticker
[8267.679s] per question.
[8270.639s] FDEF
[8273.18s] [Music]
[8274.88s] Frontier Development.
[8284.399s] Oh, this must be a foreign stock.
[8289.439s] FDV.
[8293.28s] Yeah, it&#39;s a British stock.
[8298.24s] [Music]
[8310.559s] Yeah, looks like it&#39;s starting to
[8311.92s] recover. What do they do?
[8320.0s] I don&#39;t see the the revenue is
[8321.92s] recovering though.
[8345.359s] still negative cash flow. I mean, this
[8347.359s] is a tiny company, speculative company.
[8349.92s] You really have to know what they do. So
[8351.679s] if you like know that
[8354.08s] what did they do again? They develop
[8355.599s] games I think
[8360.399s] publishes video games. So if you know
[8362.08s] one game&#39;s going to be unbelievable and
[8364.24s] you have some edge that&#39;s fine, but
[8366.88s] other than that I have zero interest in
[8369.12s] this stock. It&#39;ll probably work. But
[8371.439s] number one is you&#39;re coming to me when
[8373.04s] it&#39;s already up 4x 3x. I think it
[8375.76s] probably continues to go. But you got to
[8377.359s] you got to know that business. That&#39;s
[8379.28s] not what we do here. Uh, elf,
[8384.479s] it looks like you you&#39;re just picking a
[8386.08s] bunch that you kind of missed the first
[8387.599s] leg of the recovery rally.
[8390.64s] Um,
[8392.24s] Elf, I&#39;ve never liked UBI.
[8399.2s] Ubisoft
[8424.72s] Um.
[8426.72s] All right. So, this one
[8430.479s] is potentially
[8435.439s] the one that so far makes the most sense
[8438.16s] out of everything you&#39;ve given me.
[8443.359s] Just on a fundamental basis,
[8449.6s] what do these guys do?
[8455.28s] Publish video games. So, you&#39;re into
[8457.28s] video games. You You have to have some
[8459.359s] type of edge.
[8475.84s] Um, if you understand what their
[8480.479s] publishing docket is and you have some
[8482.8s] edge, like you&#39;ve played video games
[8484.24s] your whole life and you know it&#39;s going
[8485.52s] to be a huge hit and you&#39;re on all the
[8488.0s] Twitch and everything else or wherever
[8490.0s] people talk about that. If you have some
[8491.439s] edge, like I think your margin of safety
[8493.2s] is good, but if it&#39;s just a meto video
[8495.2s] game and they don&#39;t have any hits in the
[8496.479s] pipe, it&#39;s just going to languish. It&#39;s
[8498.399s] like a drug company. They got to come up
[8499.92s] with a new big hit for it to work. Uh,
[8502.399s] but I think your margin of safety seems
[8504.479s] best in Ubisoft relative to the other
[8507.68s] few that you sent. So, good work on that
[8512.24s] Marco.
[8518.08s] Dev Patel Nphase
[8522.0s] every week. Every week phase.
[8528.88s] Yeah. Like if you&#39;re going to buy solar,
[8533.84s] I think this is worth starting to look
[8535.6s] at. I&#39;m not I&#39;m just not interested.
[8539.84s] Too much risk for too little reward. I
[8542.24s] if if you put a gun to my head and said
[8544.16s] buy solar tomorrow, that would probably
[8546.0s] be the name I&#39;d buy, but I don&#39;t have
[8548.8s] to. So therefore, I won&#39;t. That goes in
[8551.12s] too hard box.
[8553.6s] Um,
[8557.359s] Matthew Blecker, hi Tom, great podcast.
[8559.76s] Also huge fans in the Newport Beach
[8561.2s] area. Any interest in staples like
[8563.12s] Clorox? Yeah, I think Clorox is fine uh
[8566.96s] for the long term. I think they also
[8568.72s] have a CEO problem, but again, it&#39;s a
[8572.319s] business that a ham sandwich could run
[8575.28s] and one probably is running at the
[8577.52s] moment, but um I think you want to own
[8580.08s] this for the long term.
[8582.319s] and we&#39;ve covered that a few times.
[8583.76s] That&#39;s why I don&#39;t need to spend a lot
[8584.96s] of time on it. So, yeah, I like it here
[8586.72s] for the long term. That&#39;s another one
[8588.08s] that for the kid who needs to own stuff
[8590.08s] for five to 10 years, that one&#39;s
[8592.16s] probably fine. Um,
[8595.84s] okay. Podcast invite.
[8598.8s] Graham drawer. Okay, we got that one.
[8601.84s] Suzy
[8604.16s] Eli Lily. Not for me.
[8607.359s] See if it came down enough yet.
[8610.8s] No. Hard pass for me. Next,
[8617.52s] Tim Felmingham.
[8628.479s] Been following you for about three years
[8629.68s] now. First year I just watched and last
[8631.28s] two years I&#39;ve been actively investing,
[8632.64s] following your principles. Obviously,
[8634.24s] that&#39;s worked out very well. Thank you
[8635.52s] very much for everything you do for your
[8636.88s] listeners. I hope to become a client one
[8638.56s] day, but in the meantime, doing very
[8639.84s] well just by following your teaching.
[8641.2s] Thank you. Question. As a UK investor,
[8643.439s] my returns will are very good or
[8645.439s] significantly eroded by the weakening
[8647.04s] dollar. Is there any UK stocks that
[8648.56s] currently fit your framework? Well, you
[8650.72s] now know the framework. Go find them is
[8652.96s] the answer to your question. Um,
[8656.56s] reduce your currency risk. Um
[8663.28s] our way of playing that is GXO which is
[8665.52s] you know
[8668.24s] benefits from a weakening
[8670.8s] euro because they collect a lot of euros
[8672.8s] and then it gets converted into US
[8674.64s] dollar earnings. So um that&#39;s all I got
[8678.399s] there. Um,
[8682.0s] again, I think you&#39;re asking after the
[8685.439s] fact. The biggest move in the shortest
[8687.52s] period of time already happened. I think
[8688.88s] it&#39;s going to trend lower over time, but
[8691.04s] um,
[8693.439s] that&#39;s all I would say about that.
[8696.24s] All right, another podcast invite.
[8703.439s] All
[8718.88s] right, this from Lee Foster. I find the
[8721.2s] hardest thing in investing is not
[8722.319s] picking the undervalued stocks, but
[8723.439s] knowing when to trim or get out
[8724.56s] completely. I may be wrong, but I get
[8726.479s] the impression that even if an equity
[8728.88s] has room to run beyond your initial
[8730.479s] targets, you will still take some
[8731.68s] profits off the table. a self-imposed
[8733.76s] takeprofit, if you will. I know your
[8736.319s] exact method is a secret, as it should
[8737.84s] be, but is it ever correct to ignore
[8740.399s] fundamentals and sell just to guarantee
[8741.76s] a winner? I never sell to guarantee a
[8743.439s] winner. I sell at the price that I
[8745.04s] determined I would get out when I got
[8746.24s] in. The only thing that would change
[8747.439s] that is if the fundamentals got
[8750.319s] dramatically better than trend, but
[8752.72s] dramatically better than I anticipated
[8754.479s] they could ever get. um and therefore
[8757.28s] warranted uh a a a rerating
[8761.6s] from our internal models. But I have no
[8764.399s] expectation that I&#39;m at the top. I have
[8766.0s] an expectation that I&#39;m selling where I
[8767.68s] said I would sell and the IRRa was
[8769.76s] sufficient when I got in at a particular
[8771.439s] price and decided I&#39;d get out at a
[8773.12s] particular price. So I don&#39;t care if it
[8774.96s] runs another 200% beyond where I got
[8777.04s] out. I&#39;m I&#39;m selling it well above my
[8780.24s] designation of intrinsic value just as I
[8783.6s] bought it dramatically below my
[8786.24s] interpretation of intrinsic value
[8788.0s] according to my models and according to
[8790.08s] the math. So um
[8794.319s] some I&#39;ll leave a kicker on just to run
[8797.12s] to infinity because in the mark in the
[8799.439s] short term the market&#39;s a voting machine
[8800.8s] based on emotion and I&#39;ll just ride some
[8802.319s] of that emotion after I&#39;ve taken the
[8803.68s] bulk off. But for the most part, if it
[8806.64s] hits my target that I decided before I
[8808.8s] even got into stock, I&#39;m mostly 90. I&#39;m
[8812.24s] out. I&#39;m basically out. I&#39;ll usually
[8814.24s] keep a trailer on. It&#39;ll run another 20%
[8816.319s] and then I&#39;m out. And it and then I
[8818.08s] never look at it again until it&#39;s
[8819.68s] dramatically undervalued and no one
[8821.12s] likes it, which is many years in the
[8822.8s] future. Um,
[8825.84s] Alios, no, same thing.
[8833.92s] Okay,
[8842.96s] this is from Rico Bell. Hi, Tom. I&#39;ve
[8845.68s] been listening about two years. I own a
[8847.04s] small construction company and turn my
[8848.479s] guys on to you. Oh, thank you. We look
[8850.24s] forward to your podcast every week and
[8851.6s] even listen on the job site while
[8853.04s] installing roofing shingles hopefully
[8854.56s] from QXO. LOL. I was wondering what your
[8858.16s] thoughts are on TPL.
[8860.479s] Thanks for everything. We appreciate you
[8862.319s] more than you know. Well, thank you and
[8864.64s] Rico, get ready, my man, because you and
[8867.2s] your crew are going to be busier than
[8868.88s] one armed paper hangers uh in the next
[8871.52s] few years. So, super excited and thank
[8874.64s] you for sharing with people you care
[8876.399s] about. Okay, TPL, this is a special
[8880.56s] situation.
[8882.64s] Um,
[8886.479s] I think there are higher and better uses
[8888.96s] of
[8890.64s] capital.
[8897.52s] This is an asset play.
[8904.08s] It This is This is
[8907.52s] I don&#39;t like this type of play. These
[8909.12s] tend to be traps. you&#39;re gonna have no
[8912.08s] real edge on this and you&#39;re not buying
[8914.64s] it when no one wants it. So, I would I
[8916.479s] would pass on this one, my friend. Only
[8918.319s] and I&#39;m doing this quickly just because
[8919.6s] I&#39;ve already done work on it. Um, but I
[8922.399s] like the way you&#39;re thinking and your
[8924.0s] crew and uh let why don&#39;t you throw some
[8926.88s] housing stocks my way when you see
[8928.72s] something uh company that you guys are
[8930.72s] using a lot of their stuff whether it&#39;s
[8932.399s] Trex whether it&#39;s uh some of these
[8934.64s] suppliers uh throw a couple of those out
[8937.92s] when you think they&#39;re undervalued and
[8939.359s] we&#39;ll we&#39;ll get them on the show and uh
[8941.359s] give a shout out to you guys again. But
[8942.96s] thanks for tuning in uh loyally and
[8945.439s] sharing it and and benefiting from it. I
[8947.439s] appreciate that. Uh, Marlon Estrada,
[8951.6s] LTM, Latam Airlines,
[8957.28s] LTM.
[8961.2s] O,
[8963.68s] this looks like a lot of delutions
[8965.12s] happened over the years. This looks like
[8967.359s] a cigar, but one last puff. Maybe you
[8969.6s] get a trade out of it. It&#39;s not a
[8971.6s] business you would want to buy and hold.
[8974.08s] Seems like they just continue to
[8975.6s] mismanage it for some strange reason
[8981.28s] and dilute the hell out of their
[8982.64s] shareholders. Why do they keep doing
[8984.319s] that? Must be government involvement.
[8989.28s] What is going on here?
[8993.6s] Just makes little sense
[8999.76s] what the hell they&#39;re doing.
[9003.04s] Well, there&#39;s your answer.
[9005.84s] Wow.
[9009.68s] They 10xed the share count
[9014.399s] postcoid
[9018.16s] 10x
[9022.56s] and 2x the revenue. So,
[9026.96s] this is a group that obviously has zero
[9030.72s] respect for shareholders.
[9033.359s] They were probably on their last legs. I
[9035.12s] I don&#39;t
[9040.399s] I don&#39;t know. I that type of activity. I
[9043.6s] mean, maybe it was just a desperation
[9045.04s] move, but
[9051.12s] uh let me see.
[9057.439s] Two billion of cash,
[9062.0s] 2.8 billion of debt,
[9068.08s] huh?
[9069.92s] I mean,
[9078.24s] that&#39;s a lot of shares that they&#39;re
[9079.92s] gonna have to buy back before this thing
[9081.6s] starts to work. Um
[9085.52s] I mean the problem is
[9089.84s] that even before COVID the stock did
[9092.0s] nothing for 20 years. So it was
[9093.68s] mismanaged before you had the once in a
[9095.52s] 100redy year event.
[9097.76s] Um
[9101.12s] I don&#39;t know. It does look like it&#39;s
[9102.56s] recovering. I think it&#39;s worth doing a
[9104.08s] little more work on but
[9109.92s] the red flags are definitely there. So,
[9113.359s] oh, emerged from chapter 11 on January
[9115.439s] 23rd.
[9122.88s] Yeah. All right. Yeah. I This one
[9126.0s] requires a lot of work. This is not an
[9127.6s] easy peasy thing
[9130.96s] because there&#39;s there&#39;s just a hell of a
[9133.04s] lot of shares now.
[9150.399s] Hey Tom, I&#39;m 20 years old from Dublin,
[9152.16s] Ireland. Been listening to the podcast
[9153.52s] for nearly six months now. One of the
[9155.12s] best, most entertaining tools. Thank you
[9156.56s] very much. Given how competitive the
[9158.08s] hedge fund space is, what&#39;s the one
[9159.28s] thing you wish you&#39;d focused on earlier?
[9161.68s] Um,
[9163.92s] I think the number one thing you can do
[9165.439s] when you&#39;re in your 20s and know nothing
[9167.12s] is get your CFA and then um
[9175.84s] I mean, you know, first thing you read
[9177.6s] the intelligent investor. If that thing
[9179.12s] isn&#39;t a light bulb for you, go build a
[9181.04s] business. You&#39;ll make a lot more money
[9182.319s] as an entrepreneur at a young age. If
[9184.399s] you&#39;re going to be an investor, it&#39;s
[9185.439s] going to take you literally 15 to 20
[9187.76s] years before you even know where the
[9189.52s] coffee machine is and you can become
[9193.359s] good and maybe great. Great is going to
[9196.16s] be the intangible that can&#39;t be taught.
[9199.28s] Um, good is going to be 80 to 100 hour
[9202.479s] weeks for 10 to 15 years. Um, so I think
[9207.12s] before you even
[9209.2s] think about whether youorked enough or
[9211.439s] this or that, get your CFA if you&#39;re
[9213.2s] really serious about it. Otherwise,
[9214.8s] start a business and just get rich that
[9216.479s] way. I mean, that you&#39;ll be able to do
[9218.8s] it quicker. So, you better really love
[9221.04s] markets if you&#39;re going to put in the
[9222.24s] 15. I think over the long term,
[9225.68s] you know, you can make a lot more money
[9228.08s] as a great investor, but in the short
[9230.479s] term as an entrepreneur, you know, you
[9231.92s] can get a couple hits, 20, 30, 40
[9234.08s] million bucks, and you know, you only
[9236.8s] eat one cheeseburger a day, so it&#39;s
[9240.0s] probably not a bad way to go.
[9242.72s] Um,
[9246.56s] that&#39;s it. So, thank you all for being
[9251.04s] amazing supporters and being with me for
[9254.08s] now going on 5 years, 300 episodes.
[9258.64s] Um, very very grateful for all the
[9261.439s] support. I I know it&#39;s delivered a lot
[9263.6s] of value and I&#39;m very grateful for all
[9265.28s] the feedback and letters and emails and
[9268.16s] notes and testimonials and comment below

[9275.52s] can double the size. uh and quadruple
[9278.08s] the size over the next 300 episodes. Uh
[9280.88s] so with that said, we&#39;ll be back next
[9282.56s] week, same time, same place. In the
[9284.56s] meantime, make it a great one. Bye for
