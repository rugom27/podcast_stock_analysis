Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 300th videocast podcast for the week ending July 17th, 2025. What a 24 hours after uh 3, four full days in New York non-stop TV. I got on the plane at 6:00 last night, sat on the tarmac till 10:15, deplaned us due to weather. Get a hotel for 3 hours. get up to get a six o&#39;clock flight, sit on the tarmac for two hours, uh, get deplaned, wind up, I get the last standby seat on a 9:00 a.m. flight. I&#39;m sitting 22 rows back with my knees over my ears for six hours. But we got back here to do number 300, and we&#39;re super excited. Uh, so let&#39;s get down to it. Uh, family first as always. Annabelle swam in the LA invite, which was her first ever senior open meet racing college kids. She&#39;s 11, by the way. She also had fun at her water polo team&#39;s end of season party. Mimi spent the weekend at her team&#39;s beach water polo fundraiser where she earned this year&#39;s coaches award for 14u. Then they ended the weekend at the Black Pink concert featuring Bruno Mars. So, let&#39;s get those photos up here. That&#39;s uh her coaches award from Patriot Water Polo Club. Best in Orange County. Unbelievable coaching staff there. This is their end of year party. Uh this is them at the concert. They got some last minute tickets there. not uh the type of tickets I&#39;d be uh excited about, but they went for it and they they had an incredible time. Um and then uh I was in New York, picked up a pair, went to Vans on Fifth Avenue in New York as soon as I landed. Uh picked up the new Skate Curran Kapples. These shoes are awesome. As a matter of fact, I&#39;m wearing them. I just literally got off the plane, so you can see them here. These things are awesome. You can wear them dressy, you can wear them undressy. They&#39;re so comfortable to walk in like Vans. Wait a second. There we go. I&#39;m going to figure out how, you know, maybe after another 300 episodes, I&#39;ll figure out how to work the camera. But these are so cool because you can wear them everywhere. They don&#39;t look like sneakers, but they&#39;re cool enough to be sneakers. And I was super excited. Store was crowded. They got two levels. Um, that&#39;s at Yahoo Finance Studio. What else? Oh, this is with Jose Torres, the chief economist over at Interactive Brokers. Uh he was on when I was uh um working with uh Josh Lipton for the hour. Uh Jose&#39;s a good guy. I&#39;ve spoken with him at the money show. That&#39;s Fox and Friends in the background when I was going inside to do Fox. That&#39;s the Yahoo studio. More from the studio. There&#39;s the van store downstairs. All this was the clothes section. Some wise guy on Twitter&#39;s like, &quot;No one&#39;s in the store.&quot; They were in the store. They were all around the sneakers. And they&#39;ve got that thing running like a welloiled machine. I got to say, I didn&#39;t go in planning to buy sneakers. They have got a machine there. Like, you look at sneakers. They&#39;re like, &quot;Can I help you, sir?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Uh, yeah. I kind of like these. Let me try them in a 13 blah blah blah.&quot; He waits with me. He radios like someone in the back. They come sprinting out with the shoes. They lace them up for you. They&#39;re like, &quot;The mirror&#39;s right there. You want a photo with it?&quot; blah blah blah. I was like, &quot;This is great. Let&#39;s go.&quot; Uh, bring them up to the counter. You got any socks? I picked up like five dozen socks. Vans and Dicki socks are amazing, by the way. I&#39;m just saying. Uh, VF Corp. Uh, that was with Caroline Long. Uh, I&#39;m sorry, Caroline Woods, who sat in for Kristen Scher NYC live. That was Don Jr. by the way. Um, if you&#39;re interested at all, uh, I go to get into the show and security was like, uh, you got to wait online. There&#39;s like 400 people online. They weren&#39;t letting anyone in because of Secret Service. So, like I went to another cop. I was like, I&#39;m going live in 5 minutes. Uh, can you let me in? And then like I finally went to the third cop. He&#39;s like, oh my gosh, yeah, go right up to the front. Like there was, you know, had common sense, helped me right through. And fortunately, I was able to do that. But security was just super tight. That&#39;s with Diane King Hall over at Schwab Network. That&#39;s the Schwab booth. Uh Sha Sam Vadus, who used to do CNBC Asia, I would go on her show a lot. Uh she&#39;s now working at Schwab. Her husband has a job. That&#39;s all. You can see Secret Service outside with Don and his his new uh girlfriend or wife or whatever it is. And um they seem super happy. All right, so moving right along. Uh, first on to the media. Want to thank Christian Dagger, Payton Jennings, and the great Stuart Vanney for having me on Tuesday. We&#39;re going to listen in here. &gt;&gt; Okay, let&#39;s bring in Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s watching the market for us this morning. Uh, what does that rate what does the CPI mean for a rate cut? &gt;&gt; I think it means President Trump has uh proof for his case. This is the fifth consecutive month that core CPI came in lower than expectations and both headline and core are lower than they were in January and February before the tariffs came into place. Here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen, Stu. If the Fed doesn&#39;t cut in July, and right now the odds are they are not going to cut in July, I think you&#39;re going to see a shadow Fed named and is going to be a dovish person and I think the market is going to start to price in lower rates. Powell will be a lame duck for the remainder of his term. &gt;&gt; Well, that would be a dramatic move, wouldn&#39;t it? &gt;&gt; It would be good for the market. &gt;&gt; A shadow Federal Reserve board issuing statements about you got to cut rates. &gt;&gt; All we need is the name of the next Fed chair and the market will start to discount an easier Fed. &gt;&gt; Okay. What? Let&#39;s suppose that we get a few trade deals coming in. I mean, we just reported they&#39;re talking up and down the wazoo today. Uh if we get a couple of deals in by August the 1st, what happens to the market? You know, I&#39;ve been bullish since April, okay? This is a pessimist nightmare. There are still a lot of trapped bears. Any good news is going to push them higher. Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned in the business. Two decades, these V-shaped recoveries, we&#39;re up 25% off the lows in 3 months. On average, 12 months later, the market&#39;s up another 22.3%. That&#39;s every instance since 1950. So, you can&#39;t be too bearish here. Yes, we&#39;re overbought, but in V-shaped recoveries, you tend to stay overbought. Why? because people got caught off sides. They&#39;re forced to chase the indices. They&#39;re going to have to buy lagards. Every bit of good news, including earnings expectations are very low. We saw JP Morgan with very strong earnings this morning. They&#39;re going to be forced in. So, I think we push a bit higher even after this big move. Sue, &gt;&gt; you&#39;re far too young to have been in this business for a couple of decades. &gt;&gt; I started when I was seven. &gt;&gt; Good one, Tom. You&#39;re all right. Thank you very much indeed. Coming up, America&#39;s putting more &gt;&gt; and we&#39;re back. Then I want to thank Taylor Riggs, Degan McDow, Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, and Madison Murtog, and Cassie Loloff for having me on the Big Money Show for the full hour. We had so much fun in this segment. Uh we&#39;re going to listen in here. [Laughter] [Music] much too fast. &gt;&gt; Welcome back into the second hour of the Big Money Show. I&#39;m Degan McDow along with my fantabulous co-host and joining us for this terrific hour, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. Nice to see you. Another big win on the economy for President Trump. tariff cash pouring in and now the Treasury is flashing a$ 27 billion surplus this for the month of June. President Trump says America&#39;s back. Our country is uh making a lot of money, a lot of money for the first time in a long time in decades. We have a country that was dead was dead. It was a goner one year ago and now we have the hottest country in the world. &gt;&gt; Thomas, how do you see these numbers that because this is a consumption tax but better uh small consumption tax that is borne in large part by exporters from other countries and then you cut taxes here at home and create incentive for work. Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely one is a surprise uh in the sense that we came to surplus so quickly. Okay, 27 billion in surplus. We collected a record 27 billion in tariffs. That&#39;s up 4x. Okay, and uh they&#39;re expecting over the next decade $2.8 trillion of collected tariffs. Uh and then you&#39;ve got the tax cuts to spur growth at the same time. And to your point, Dan, I think you nailed it. It&#39;s not all being borne by the US consumer. It&#39;s being borne by the exporters. Why would they be pushing back if it was all being borne by us? They&#39;re the last thing the Japanese or the Chinese or the Europeans are worried about is uh is the happiness of the US customer. They&#39;re worried about their bottom line. And uh and they&#39;re pushing back hard. And I like the way President Trump has put these deadlines on because they know he&#39;s flexible to talk and negotiate, but they also know that&#39;s a real deadline. The spot starts and the tariffs go up on that date. So it&#39;s like we&#39;re we&#39;re going to talk we&#39;re flexible flexible we are rational but if you don&#39;t play you&#39;re going to pay. &gt;&gt; You know what&#39;s also at a record in the month of June tax receipts in June were up 13%. This is even before the big beautiful bill &gt;&gt; and outlays were down 7%. So this is heading in the right direction. What were you going to say? The only thing is I I love the CBO just leaves out interest in that calculation, &gt;&gt; which is why I loved you when I said that. &gt;&gt; That&#39;s kind of the problem. &gt;&gt; Couple of things. I think Doge is is probably going to be more successful than anticipated. Spending was down part of the surplus spending was down 187 billion in June. Okay. Two, productivity. We haven&#39;t had this acceleration of productivity growth since the 80s. And if we do get exactly what Taylor&#39;s talking about, the only way we&#39;re getting out of 120% debt to GDP is growth. Okay. Uh so the policies are in place. We we&#39;ve just gone from, you know, bombs and tariffs to to now we&#39;re talking about growth and we have tax cuts. Wait till we get into massive deregulation and unleash businesses. Bonus depreciation in the one big beautiful bill. That is massive for large business, but it&#39;s massive for small businesses. So I I think you&#39;re going to see animal spirits come back. If you look at household balance sheets uh uh in aggregate, if you look at leverage of S&amp;P 500 companies, it&#39;s near record lows. There is a lot of credit expansion can happen. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s gumming up the whole system is artificially high rates. So when we talk about a trillion dollars a year of interest, we could fix that tomorrow. If a shadow Fed is announced, the market&#39;s going to start to price in that lower interest payment and those lower rates. And I got to tell you, in the 50s when we were at debt to GDP 120%, we ran inflation a little bit hot. I got to be honest with you, 3 to 5%. And you know what happened? Debt to GDP went from 120% in 1948 to 63% in 1950. &gt;&gt; You ratio inflate your way out of your debt. I love that you combination. &gt;&gt; Nominal GDP has to run hot and inflation a little bit above trend. It just goes hand in hand. You want to inflate your way out? I I I didn&#39;t have that on my bingo card today. I want a little bit of I didn&#39;t have that on my bingo cards. I want some productivity growth. I want some deregulation. I want some tax cuts. I want some releveraging of the private sector. And uh and we can absolutely rock and roll. Look, we&#39;ve got the biggest portion of our population, the millennials, 72 million at perfect age of productivity, of spending, of starting new families. This economy can hum and President Trump is setting the table for that. What if they can&#39;t get jobs because of AI? We were just talking about that in the last hour. &gt;&gt; Well, there&#39;s, you know, it&#39;s interesting. There there&#39;s not been a case yet where a disruptive technology dis it certainly displaces, but people go back and new jobs and new industries are created to service the new technologies or the freedoms that the new technologies creates creates new cottage industries that employ people. Uh maybe you&#39;ll just be playing golf all day and the and the golf companies will do incredible business because everyone&#39;s playing golf. Nothing to do. uh you know, but that&#39;s an exaggeration. The point is is that I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get to a point where we&#39;re sitting at home watching TV getting universal basic income because there&#39;s nothing to do. We&#39;ll figure out something to do. It&#39;s human nature. Humans like to grow. They like to be productive. They like to contribute and that won&#39;t change anytime soon. My biggest concern isn&#39;t how technology because again technology equals productivity and the AI it will just change the jobs that people do. &gt;&gt; That&#39;s right. &gt;&gt; House&#39;s recent tariff storm, but a fresh set of earnings this week will be a new test. We get results from America&#39;s top banks, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, City, all tomorrow. Tom, look, I don&#39;t care what happens to their trading revenue. I don&#39;t care what happens to their investment banking revenue. It&#39;s probably all good. But I do care what they have to say about the health of the consumer, the credit cards, the economy. Um what do you want to hear from them? And then more broadly, this earning season, frankly, to me has felt like it&#39;s been on fire. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Uh look, the the secret to happiness is low expectations. And that that&#39;s what we&#39;re coming into the season with. Uh expectations were over 9% just 3 months ago for this quarter. They&#39;re now down to 4.8%. 8%. So, we don&#39;t have to jump over the bar. We just have to step over it. And I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to see with banks. Bank of America credit card spending data for June was up. Confidence is back. There was a lot of, you remember consumer confidence during April and May. The consumer was worried. There was uncertainty. And then there was some rationality in terms of policy. People&#39;s confidence came right back. You go to the restaurants, you see what&#39;s going on. I think that what we&#39;re going to see, we saw the stress tests were very strong. I think we&#39;re going to see another quarter of beat from the banks that&#39;s going to kick off the the thematics for this quarter and uh and it&#39;s going to come in better than expected. The key is really going to be guidance looking forward and I do think you&#39;re seeing uh CEO and seuite confidence come back the last couple of months and you know the thing I&#39;ve learned in this business is look the market feels overbought right now. It feels uh like it&#39;s come a long way in a short period of time. What I&#39;ve learned in my career is these Vshaped recoveries, the overbought signal signals that are normal in a regular environment, a trading range type of environment can stay extended for a long time coming out of a V because so many people got caught off sides at the lows. They are forced in every new trade deal, every new earnings report. Uh, and they&#39;ve got to get that money to work. and where they&#39;re going to do it to save to catch up on performance. They got to go for the lagards, the things that haven&#39;t moved yet in the second half. And we&#39;re seeing that the first few weeks of the second half. &gt;&gt; Well, I was just talking to somebody who was saying it was also the retail investor who really benefited the most from the lows that we saw liberation day, but that the institutions didn&#39;t necessarily get in when they were supposed to. So, that goes to your point that if they&#39;re legging in slowly, then this market has room to run. The same person was also telling me that he likes financials right now. And I&#39;m like, really? looking at Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. It&#39;s difficult for me like that&#39;s like buying Palunteer or Nvidia at this point. Um do you think there is still room there? &gt;&gt; I think there&#39;s I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the highest and best use of capital right now. I do think there is some room. I I think guidance is going to be okay. I think deals are coming back. Uh but they&#39;ve they&#39;ve run a lot. I think you you hit the nail on the head. So some underperformers uh in the first half that I think could could start to see some bids. consumer cycl uh consumer discretionary. Okay, people are have been down on that because consumer has been uncertainty. I think a lot of those have gotten beaten up, the Nikes of the world, uh even the advanced auto parts has doubled off its lows recently. Uh and some of those areas that um that are also still in a little bit of tariff uncertainty as it relates to consumer goods, the Lululemons, we don&#39;t own Lulu, we don&#39;t own Nike, but we own similar type of companies. Uh and I think they&#39;re going to start to get bid in a material way. I think energy is actually there&#39;s some value starting to show up in the services. No one wants them. And I think finally, even though they&#39;re getting hit with some of the Medicaid and and uh spend, I think healthcare, some some aspects of healthcare have really been hit. So, I think you want to kind of go towards where the puck is going, not where it already is. And I think financials and tech have had a good run here. &gt;&gt; I agree with you, but you explained it better than I could. &gt;&gt; Brian, what? &gt;&gt; I think Dan, you might be spot on. I fly United every month uh straight out of Orange County to to Newark and I&#39;ve had great experiences. So may maybe to your point I think the whole the whole basket though of airlines has been so beaten down. So when you&#39;re buying that you kind of want to buy the best balance sheets and and the the best financials. So Delta still has good financials relative to the peers. Uh maybe United uh but beyond that you start to get a little bit dicey. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Speaking of financial conditions I did want to point out each announcement. So maybe things get a little bit tighter, but loose financial conditions are, &gt;&gt; by the way, it&#39;s so funny when people say &gt;&gt; if if Powell lowered rates to close to the level of inflation, which would be neutral, uh it wouldn&#39;t affect mortgages because they trade off the 10-year yield. That&#39;s completely false. You know what game comes back the minute he lowers rates? &gt;&gt; Fiveyear and sevenyear adjustable arms. And that gets everyone back in the game. And and it completely changes. You talk about productivity, putting people into high-paying jobs, middle class jobs, and and uh and having what happened in the first term of Trump where regular everyday people&#39;s real wages went up. Main Street did better on a relative basis during Trump&#39;s first term uh than than we&#39;ve seen in the previous administration. We&#39;re going to see it again. &gt;&gt; Jack Leg Jay, loosen my financial conditions. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Okay. Seriously, I I want just that mortgage lower. &gt;&gt; Oh, and by the way, all the trapped equity in people&#39;s homes, wait till they lower rates and you see the HELOC game come on. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that&#39;s true. &gt;&gt; For that reason, unlike you, why are you all talking about interest rate cuts? &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think a couple of things. One is you&#39;ve got 16% of GDP is housing related and those are the highpaying jobs. Number two, the biggest portion of our population is the millennials and their uh ability to start their lives. Housing and family formation has now been delayed by five years unnecessarily by this policy. And number three, like everyone at this table, we pay a lot of taxes. Uh and those taxes, $600 billion are going into unnecessary interest expense determined at the hand of one person. &gt;&gt; Perspective, that&#39;s not the Fed&#39;s mandate. I hear you. I wish we could all get a home and a mortgage again for 3%. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that&#39;s not what they&#39;re there for. &gt;&gt; That&#39;s correct. So, dual mandate, maximum employment. Okay, we saw the jobs report like Charles was talking about, not as great as advertised. Okay. And inflation has been low, very, very low. So, the the real issue is they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent by mandate. They&#39;ve now shifted in the last 30 days to being prediction dependent. Now, this was the same guy who said quantitative tightening was on autopilot in December of 2018. I remember because I was at Disneyland and the market was crashing 20% in the month of December because they didn&#39;t know what he was doing and Minutian had to call a meeting of the bankers on Sunday to bail him out Sunday night and they and they juiced it and they turned things around. Uh then he did transitory and now he is certain because his crystal ball has been so big. &gt;&gt; Then he cut rates before the election. &gt;&gt; Well, there you go. and and and now he&#39;s talking about his predictions, &gt;&gt; but his predictions are like yours. I mean, his predictions are the economy is not slowing down enough to justify a rate &gt;&gt; cut except he talks out of both of his mouths because in the summary of economic projections, real GDP he&#39;s got it 1.4%. How can you say that we can&#39;t cut rates if if real GDP in their own projections, summary of economic projections, last meeting, 1.4? &gt;&gt; Can I push back again? Yes, &gt;&gt; he&#39;s one vote and his vote is no more important than any of the other 11 members. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do we hold him to a higher standard because he&#39;s Fed chair? What about all of the other 120 votes that we talk about? &gt;&gt; Yeah. I look I I think as chairman he leads the tenor and it&#39;s and it&#39;s incumbent upon him &gt;&gt; to present the data that is supportive. Look, this lady part of the swamp, Tom. &gt;&gt; They&#39;re part of the swamp. And this lady who just came on and said, &quot;We&#39;re near the neutral rate.&quot; How do you get to that math? I could go to my fifth, you know, fifth grader and say, &quot;Listen, the Fed funds rate is at 425, inflation is at 28. Does that look like it&#39;s about the same number?&quot; And she&#39;d say, &quot;No, that looks pretty far apart.&quot; And I&#39;d say, &quot;Well, that then that&#39;s not neutral.&quot; And that old dog don&#39;t hunt, as they say. Dan probably. &gt;&gt; What do you guys think? Well, wait. So, I&#39;ve never I&#39;ve never thought I want to go to Vegas to play Uno. &gt;&gt; I I hate Vegas. They think it&#39;s an armpit. I definitely don&#39;t want to go there to play. &gt;&gt; Well, you just don&#39;t want to go there at all. &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t want to go there at all. &gt;&gt; Brian, you&#39;re missing the whole boat. My 11-year-old loves Uno. I have yet to beat her at Uno. And it will now be an excuse to go to Vegas and can say, &quot;Hey, we&#39;ll go play Uno together.&quot; And we get to teach them at 11 to how to play cards for money. I mean that not that but then the how is she going to take over my investing business if she doesn&#39;t understand probabilities. &gt;&gt; Uno is a great game but if you&#39;re if you&#39;re going to Uno in Vegas like how could it not be for money? It&#39;s got to be for money right in Vegas. &gt;&gt; All I know is Uno beats old maid any day. So I will absolutely go play any game not for money. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. It&#39;s got to be for money. I&#39;ve never I don&#39;t know if I have one. They&#39;re not getting anywhere. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that&#39;s the case. And and I I will say in my adult life, the one period where I felt like Main Street was booming and feeling happy was in President Trump&#39;s first term. The policies people were optimistic, but there but it wasn&#39;t just like hope. It was their real wages were actually going up. And I do think this bonus depreciation and I do think the tax is not going back up on businesses uh is going to recreate that environment and is starting to recreate that environment. So let&#39;s let&#39;s be hopeful these numbers start to improve and we move back towards 55 61% and this range starts to go up. But again, you need the highpaying jobs and that&#39;s what President Trump is trying to do with reshoring manufacturing with with opening up federal lands to build houses. Those are major components to the economy that have been kind of left &gt;&gt; and whatever the definition of middle class is, if we&#39;re going to go by the Pew definition, &gt;&gt; need to start paying your bills. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think that&#39;s personal responsibility. But I also think if you want equilibrium in the um in the education world, allow people to discourage their student loans in bankruptcy and that will create an equilibrium overnight because then the pricing will come down. Then it will be risk versus return in terms of expecting a return on investment for education. Uh universities will have to deliver. Elizabeth Warren does not like this because uh she got paid $400,000 at Yale as a as a professor. And you know, if you keep the prices inflated and you keep the spots on with this subsidized lending, you&#39;re going to see tuition prices continue to go up. If you let the natural market play its course and you let that be discouraged, then they&#39;re going to have to deliver value for every dollar of tuition that you &gt;&gt; and we&#39;re back. And then we I got to join Josh Lipton for just over an hour on Yahoo Finance. We obviously cut these all down just to my section, so we&#39;re not here uh until tomorrow. So, I wanted to thank Josh Lipton and Taylor Cloier Smith. Uh we&#39;re listening here. &gt;&gt; Ravage is kind of just shrugging this off. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I mean, Trump&#39;s negotiation strategy has been punch him in the face and then offer them an ice pack and they&#39;re grateful for the ice pack. So what the market knows is that he goes for all and then he when they come to the table he talks with them but if they don&#39;t respect his deadlines he will pull the trigger on on the tariffs which he has and we saw that in June 27 billion record amount of money into the treasuries and we actually ran a budget surplus in June to the equivalent tune of 27 billion spending went down. So I think that uh Trump&#39;s showing a little bit of momentum and the market&#39;s comfortable that he&#39;s also shown in recent months more rationality comes out strong and then he backs up into something that&#39;s reasonable and the markets can digest. &gt;&gt; Jared, we got bank earnings on tap. What do you expect? Where do you stand on the rally? &gt;&gt; I think that overbought can remain overbought. The one thing I&#39;ve learned in this business seeing these Vshaped recoveries is that overbought can push higher because so many people were caught off sides at the lows that uh retail was buying the lows, institutions now have to play catch-up. And where are they going to catch up is those stocks that haven&#39;t left the station. So that you&#39;re going to see a broadening participation uh in not just the MAG 7, but broadening out as we&#39;ve seen in the beginning parts of the second half. And then as it relates to earnings, the secret to happiness is low expectations. And that&#39;s what what&#39;s happening uh for earnings season. Uh estimates for earnings growth down to 4.8% from 9.4%. So it&#39;s an easy bar. You don&#39;t have to jump over it. You can just step over it. &gt;&gt; Not a fan. He&#39;s upset. He&#39;s frustrated. He thinks the Fed&#39;s late. They should have been already cutting. Now you hear all this hot talk and chatter, which I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been reading about. The Fed&#39;s building renovation. It&#39;s gone over. That&#39;s where the focus is at. &gt;&gt; It feels like we&#39;ve kind of turned a corner here in terms of the heat being ratcheted up. Yeah. And I&#39;m just curious what you make of that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. There&#39;s no question. Look, taxpayers like you and me are paying $600 billion of extra interest that we don&#39;t need to. The rate is not neutral. There was a Fed head out today saying we&#39;re close to the neutral rate. How I mean, I could go to my 11-year-old who&#39;s in fifth grade and say, &quot;Our Fed funds rate is at 425 and inflation is at 2 and change. Does that look neutral to you?&quot; and she would say, &quot;No, that looks pretty far apart. Like you could drive a truck through it.&quot; So, uh, number one, we&#39;re paying more than we have to. Number two, millennials are getting hurt more than anyone else. 72 million people in this country trying to start families, trying to buy a house, housing and family for formation. They&#39;ve been delayed by five years. And the only way we&#39;re going to get out of this situation, 120% debt to GDP, we&#39;re not going to cut our way to prosperity. We got to grow our way like we did in the 50s when we brought inflation uh debt to GDP from 120% down to 63%. We ran inflation a little bit higher than normal 3 to 5%. We ran nominal growth much higher and that&#39;s going to be the formula moving forward. And that&#39;s why the big beautiful bill we&#39;re seeing the tax cuts uh accelerated depreciation for small business. That&#39;s job creation stuff like we saw in the first term uh of of Trump. And honestly, Main Street did much better during the first term of Trump than Wall Street did. And I think you&#39;re seeing policies uh you know, we&#39;ve gone from, you know, tariffs and and war and geopolitical to now tax cuts, growth. And the third piece that people are awaiting, which is going to be huge, is going to be deregulation. That&#39;s going to let animal spirits go. So what Trump is saying, look, if they got to get him out on a technicality, did he lie in front of Congress? Did he not? The fact of the matter is the entire the the only building that they redid from the ground up was the FBI building that cost less than the overrun that cost 700 million bucks. This was estimated at 1.8 billion. Now it&#39;s 2.5 billion. who&#39;s putting some restraints on this independent body in &gt;&gt; Don&#39;t don&#39;t you think though that when I read about this building project which has been known for years and the overruns are public to me I read this and I see okay I see this like this is really just about Trump being frustrated with all the things you&#39;re laying out that he&#39;s not cutting. That&#39;s how I read it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, 100%. Look, if you got a trillion dollars of interest expense and it could be 500 billion, &gt;&gt; uh, that that&#39;s some serious math. And Trump has spent his whole career refinancing debt and he likes to do it at low rates. So, &gt;&gt; he&#39;s a real estate guy. He wants a loan. &gt;&gt; And look, the fact of the matter is, let&#39;s say Powell&#39;s predict, he&#39;s supposed to be data dependent. Now, he&#39;s become prediction dependent. Let&#39;s say his predictions are correct and inflation goes up. It&#39;s much easier to to re raise rates by 25 basis points than to try to fend off deflation, which costs a lot, puts a lot of people out of work, a lot of pain. You can&#39;t turn that around. You can quell inflation if it starts to get away a lot quicker than you can do. &gt;&gt; Let me let me they tell me I have to go, but I I just want one last question. I&#39;m curious about your take on this. &gt;&gt; There is the assumption, Tom, you know this, the assumption and the expectation that we have an independent Fed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To the extent that that ever became really called into question, I&#39;m just curious how you think as an investor the ripple effects of that would be on the dollar, on rates. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, look, I I think the other side of it is people are feeling like J. Powell may not be impartial based on his actions during different periods of his tenure. Uh, and to your point that that&#39;s concerning to some people on on certain sides. And if it became kind of a proxy just for what President Trump wanted to do, maybe that would be concerning as well. But I think consensus is building across the lines. People realize that these millennials are getting hurt. You know, people if you look at people&#39;s, you know, insurance bills, if they look at their their refinancing rates, if you look at the amount of trapped equity in homes, people can&#39;t even access through HELOCs if they want to build an expansion uh uh to, you know, if they&#39;re having another kid, they can&#39;t do an addition on their house because the cost is too much. People are trapped in houses bigger than they need if they&#39;re 60 70 because they can&#39;t trade from a 3% mortgage to a 7% even if they&#39;re taking equity out and moving down. This is unnecessary stuff from a guy who candidly three times has been wrong. Autopilot on quantitative tightening crashing the market 20%. Uh transitory. So his prediction record is not good. And his summary of economic projections if he&#39;s so clear inflation is going to go up. Why does he have real GDP at 1.4%. That old dog don&#39;t hunt. You can&#39;t talk out of both sides of your mouth. Either we&#39;re we&#39;re going too fast and you got to keep rates high or we&#39;re going too slow and you got to bring them down. And Trump is saying bring them down. All right, Tom. Well, we are just getting started here on Market Domination coming up. Got CPI data tomorrow set to show just how hard tariffs tail with your expectations. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I think he&#39;s correct. I I think you know you could have a short-term modest bump, but it rolls over. And by the way, the Fed themselves believes that if you look at their summary of economic projections, they acknowledge it&#39;s kind of a one-time tax. But I will say if the US consumer was going to eat all of those tariffs, why do you think the foreign countries are fighting so hard against Trump? It&#39;s not because they&#39;re concerned about the US consumer having a tough time. It&#39;s they&#39;re worried about them eating the tariffs. Otherwise, they simply wouldn&#39;t care if it was all passed through. So, I think we need to keep that that in mind. I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a balance like Jose said. Uh and I think, you know, I&#39;d be very interested to to hear what Jose thinks about uh the 10-year yield. Jared was talking about the 30-year yield approaching 5% and kind of what he thinks about the impact of Bessant working on the 10-year yield with the SLR and allowing banks to hold more treasuries if he has any thoughts there. &gt;&gt; Jose, chime in there. &gt;&gt; Sure. Sure. I mean, I thought I&#39;ve been saying for a while that folks should be coming in and buying treasuries. You know, the bond vigilantes, I&#39;ve been seeing them sort of shift and going into more. &gt;&gt; They see the shift to online as structural and one that is difficult to address under Proctor&#39;s current organization. at least in the short term. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they&#39;ll figure it out. They&#39;ve got brand modes. Uh but the problem is it&#39;s got low singledigit growth and it&#39;s trading at, you know, mid20s multiple forward earnings. So, it&#39;s a little bit ahead of itself. I will say a lot of the defensives have been beaten down. Proctor is not one of them. So, for me to put new money to work on this downgrade, it&#39;s not that attractive in terms of price is what you pay, value is what you get. I think that uh it&#39;s it will recover. It will be fine, but it&#39;s kind of already priced out in at these levels. So I I&#39;m a pass on that. &gt;&gt; A pass on that. Let&#39;s check in on another one. That&#39;d be shares of Rivian riding lower today on the back of a downgrade to neutral from buy at Guggenheim. Also removed its price target on the EV maker. The analysts there saying the EV incentive changes have both near and long-term implications. So Guggenheim downgrades this one to neutral. Uh they talk about Tom softer long-term R2 R3 assumptions driven by both softer R1 sales. They talk about negative US EV and emission policy changes. just how do you see this one? &gt;&gt; I wouldn&#39;t buy this with your money. &gt;&gt; Wow, that doesn&#39;t sound like &gt;&gt; I&#39;ll tell you, look, I I think at the end of the day, uh it&#39;s going to be Tesla and the rest as it relates to the EV world. Uh and Rivian&#39;s just not part of that equation. Yes, if you&#39;re in the Hamptons and you don&#39;t want to drive around in a Tesla, you&#39;re driving around in a Rivian, but they haven&#39;t changed the model. They got the model right originally, but it&#39;s getting a little stale, and I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve got the money for the refresh. Uh EV incentives going away, subsidized market going away in the US, too much competition with China if they want to be outside of the US. Um not a good outlook. &gt;&gt; They say we no longer have confidence in the required volumes and or required ASPs to support our prior price target. Referring there to average selling price. The stock is down about 5% this year, but most on the street, it looks like Guggenheim, they&#39;re they&#39;re most at a hold here. All right. Finally, Melius Research initiating coverage on Starbucks with a sell rating and an $80 target price implying 16% downside from the current price. Melius pointing out the competitive intensity that Starbucks faces. So, initi, you know, you don&#39;t a lot of times initiating a a sell. You don&#39;t find that very often, but they go out there with this. They say avoid this one. &gt;&gt; Of these three, this would be the one that I hope they keep downgrading so I can buy some shares. &gt;&gt; Why? Uh, it&#39;s a high quality business, durable mode, every corner, predictability, all the factors you want in a durable growing business. Yes, they&#39;ve had competition abroad. They&#39;ve had competition here. They had some bad execution, but at the end of the day, every time I pass a Starbucks, the 11-year-old and 13-year-old daughter want to stop. So, &gt;&gt; let me ask you this, turnaround time. Here&#39;s how they put it, right? They say listen they acknowledge coffee leader global coffee leader they said but the road to oper operational consistency brand revitalization longer and harder than consensus expects a turnaround they said is underway but not yet proven and execution risk is high on this one. &gt;&gt; I like that and I like it lower. I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer here. Uh but if they keep downgrading it on the sell side for another few months, it&#39;s going to get low enough that I&#39;m going to get interested. &gt;&gt; All right, we&#39;ll have you back when you do. And Tom, you know, Starbucks currently undergoing a turnaround strategy as we were just discussing in the world of turnaround stories. Tom, you&#39;re looking at certain plays that have you deem it worth keeping an eye on. So, let&#39;s go through some of those. &gt;&gt; Well, these I mean, these are all companies that we own. I mean, uh we came out publicly talking lately about uh advanced auto parts. Okay, this is something that you couldn&#39;t give away just a couple of months ago. Got hammered on the tariffs. Well, first off, it got hammered on COVID, overstock, detock, poorly run. O O&#39;R O&#39;Reilly ate their lunch, stock down 80s something percent. Uh, so we started building a position and we like this because we bet on jockeyies with turnaround. So, uh, Shane O Kelly came from HD Supply, 7 billion business. He sold off the Canada business, delevered the balance sheet, closed the unprofitable stores on the West Coast that were too spread out, so they couldn&#39;t get economies of scale. And now he&#39;s cleaned up the mess. And he&#39;s back into expansion, opening a hundred new stores in the next three years, all in markets where they are number one and number two so that they can consolidate distribution centers, serve the customer faster, and it&#39;s already working. This thing&#39;s already doubled from 30 to 60. By the way, he&#39;s targeting high singledigit margins by the end of 2027, early 2028. Last time they had those margins, the stock traded 150. It&#39;s still only at 60. &gt;&gt; As you noted, there&#39;s been a nice move in the stock. I&#39;m just It is now up about 30% this year, but you I mean you&#39;re obviously saying valuation still attractive. &gt;&gt; This thing just gets just getting started. If it pulls back five bucks, I&#39;d be a buyer here if you if you don&#39;t have a position. But uh this Shane Shane O Kelly has a proven track record. He knows exactly what he&#39;s doing and he&#39;s doing everything he said he was going to do uh just in the short while that he&#39;s taken the helm. And uh very very very promising uh for for the plan. And uh and the and the last one um is a brand new one which is National Well, it used to be called National Oil Well Arco. And the reason I&#39;m bringing that up for NOV, Inc. is because it&#39;s the cheapest it&#39;s been since back when it was called that in 2001 through 2007. It it was uh at these levels right before it had a 10bagger. So this is a &gt;&gt; And why is it cheap, Tom? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, it&#39;s cheap because uh number one, they got flushed out after 2018 with all the fracking etc. the demand for rigs, technology&#39;s gotten better. Uh, however, I think we&#39;re at a point with positive energy policy. As rates come down, it will become economic to drill more at lower prices, and they&#39;re going to be the beneficiary. They&#39;ve got, you know, they they&#39;re they&#39;re an OEM of onshore and offshoring drilling rigs. They have the highest install base. They&#39;ve got 50% share, and it&#39;s trading like it&#39;s going out of business. It&#39;s not going out of business. They generated over a billion dollars of free cash flow last year. They got a great balance sheet, billion plus of cash, billion of debt. And so if you believe that we&#39;re going to uh energy policy is going to be favorable the next few years, we&#39;re going to have more production. They&#39;re going to be great beneficiaries. And they&#39;ve got the largest install base for the aftermarket servicing. So even if you get uh fluctuations in energy price at these levels, uh with that install base, they&#39;re going to be less affected. And if you get any positive outcome in drill rigs increasing, which we&#39;re kind of at a trough right now, that&#39;s why I like to buy things. We talked about Albero last time. that&#39;s moved up 20 points since uh then this is a safer way to play it in terms of good balance sheet less price risk than buying um uh you know oil and gas type of company. They&#39;re kind of picks and shovels and I like picks and shovels plays versus being fully at the effect of the underlying commodity price. It&#39;s Can I just ask you about the drill baby drill mantra? Because I&#39;ve had any number of very smart energy analysts come out and I always ask him about it and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve yet to find one who says it&#39;s going to happen. They all tell me, Josh, I realize it&#39;s a Trump mantra. It&#39;s a GOP mantra. It&#39;s not going to happen. Not with WTI at these levels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Well, you have to look at the equation. So if if we if Trump is effective in either announcing a shadow Fed or the Fed actually cuts two three times this year and rates go lower that the economics of that decision and the planning become completely different. But when you have rates up here, why would you drill at $60? But if your cost of capital comes down by a third, if rates come down, you know, 150 basis points, 125 basis points, you can drill profitably at 65. And and that&#39;s what they&#39;re here to do. And by the way, in the meantime, you get a 4.1% dividend yield while you wait. So, uh, I like it at these levels because my downside is pretty well protected because they got a healthy balance sheet. Uh, they&#39;re free cash flow generative. And my upside, if we catch a cycle like we did in the early 2000, and I think there are a lot of similarities to that cycle as it relates to commodities, weaker dollar, etc., uh, and economic growth, that this thing could be a multi-bagger over the next three to five years. &gt;&gt; I want to end on on one final name, Canada Goose. Explain why that one&#39;s a bite. &gt;&gt; Okay. You&#39;re you&#39;re not going to believe it. Stock&#39;s still down 80%. It was one of these COVID stories. They overstock blah blah blah. Okay. Uh they moved. They&#39;ve got record free cash flow, record revenues, record margins. Stock is still down 80% off the co peaks. Okay. So, I play these divergences. Familyrun business, second generation. They own 39.5% of the stock. They&#39;re turning around. Here&#39;s how they&#39;re doing it. Cutting out the wholesale business, which was low margin, going DTC, 74 beautiful stores. You know, the one on Fifth Avenue. Uh those margins are up. Margins are up to 71% and it&#39;s no longer just Parker&#39;s. Drake is yesterday&#39;s news. He used to wear it. Uh they&#39;ve got raincoats. They&#39;ve got eyewear. They&#39;ve got footwear. They&#39;ve got t-shirts. Uh and uh and it&#39;s affordable. So it&#39;s not just the people that can afford a $900 or $1,500 jacket. It&#39;s someone that says, &quot;I want a Canada Goose uh t-shirt for $50. I want the hat for $75.&quot; And it becomes affordable luxury like some of the other brands. You go into Tiffany&#39;s, you got stuff at, you know, 500 grand and you have stuff at $300. You can get a bracelet for your daughter. &gt;&gt; You mentioned the stock. I mean, relative co. It has though more recently. This year, it&#39;s had a nice pop already. You say stick with it though, Tom. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Look, I mean, we&#39;ve got a much lower basis, but this is early days. I mean, the stock was up again down 80% and and now cash flow is higher than it was than it was at those levels. So when you play those divergences, in the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotions. That&#39;s what you&#39;re seeing right now. It&#39;s left for dead. In the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals. Fundamentals are better than they&#39;ve ever been. Price is worse than it&#39;s ever been. Bet on price. It&#39;ll catch up to fundamentals as they keep growing. &gt;&gt; You made a very compelling case. If I&#39;m a viewer, I&#39;m listening. Before I carve out a position, y &gt;&gt; you always think through downside risks. I know that. What are they here? &gt;&gt; Yeah, look, the balance sheet is pretty clean. Uh the the one risk obviously there&#39;s some uncertainty about tariffs. They&#39;re Canadianbased but uh they have much less impact. Management went through it on the last earning call. Listen to some of the earnings calls. You&#39;ll be less concerned about tariffs. I think uh if you had a consumer week but we saw Bank of America credit card spending up big in June now that certaintyy&#39;s coming back after the April May uncertainty. So I think on balance you want to be exposed to some of these brands and I like the fact uh consumer discretionary no one wants it. It was an underperformer first half. uh second half is starting to outperform and I want to be in those that are now you&#39;re seeing at the first three weeks already that rotation uh the goosees of the world advanced auto parts kind of qualifies in somewhat in that discretionary and others like Starbucks to a lesser extent the Nikes of the world we don&#39;t own Nike we don&#39;t own Starbucks but I like those themes where people were counting them out they were going to get killed by tariffs and uncertainty and now they&#39;re roaring back and the prices have not reflected that and that&#39;s where all these people that got caught flatfooted in April in the hole selling in the hole Now they have to catch up. They can&#39;t catch up by buying Meta up huge or Nvidia up huge. They got to catch up by buying the lagards that have good fundamentals. So hopefully they can catch up to the indices if they sold at the wrong time. So these type of names are going to outperform in the second half and that&#39;s where we&#39;re placing our bets. &gt;&gt; All right, three picks from turnaround Tom. Thank you, sir. Well, wrapping up today&#39;s market domination. Don&#39;t go anywhere. We&#39;ve got you covered with all the action and following the closing bell. Stay tuned for market domination overtime. Well, I think the market&#39;s used to Trump&#39;s negotiation strategy of punching people in the face and then offering them an ice pack and kind of backing off. And uh I think the big theme though in listening to Jared was uh small caps being the leader and that&#39;s in line with the Lagards uh leading for the second half because a lot of managers were caught off sides and they got to buy what&#39;s down in order to catch up to the indices. You can&#39;t buy the indices when they&#39;re already up. So continue to watch that theme. Consumer discretionary was out of favor first half. Small caps were out of favor. Energy was out of favor. Uh so so I think there&#39;s going to be some opportunities. That doesn&#39;t mean the others won&#39;t go up. It just means that your relative value is is there. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you about this. My colleague Josh Schaefer writing about this today. A number of firms Josh pointing on Wall Street raising their S&amp;P targets targets for the S&amp;P 500 points out RBC goes to 6250 apparently was at 5730. Here&#39;s what Lori Calvacina writes over there. She says we feel actually neutral. She says on the outlook for stocks in the second half. says, &quot;Mindful that our new price target is essentially in line with recent levels. Says we expect choppy conditions in the back half of the year and swings in both directions.&quot; You say what to that? &gt;&gt; First boss in the business, first hedge fund I worked at, my boss taught me the most important thing. Only key thing he taught me, opinion follows trend. &gt;&gt; And they got caught flatfooted. And now the market&#39;s run away from them. So they&#39;ve upgraded. They&#39;ll upgrade again when the market runs away from them. Let me give you a statistic. Uh the market&#39;s been up 25% off the bottom the last three months. The last times that this has happened since 1950, the average return 12 months out is another 23%. So RBC will be taking 6 6250 to 6,500 when it&#39;s at 6,700 and 6,500 to 6,900 when it&#39;s at 7,000. I&#39;m not saying that happens tomorrow. I&#39;m not saying we don&#39;t get volatility in the fall. I&#39;m just saying that &gt;&gt; if you look under the surface, there&#39;s still a lot to do. I mean, I got a lot of new money in this quarter and I was a little concerned. I&#39;m like, markets feel a little frothy. And I looked at some of the opportunities out there that weren&#39;t the heaviest waitings of the S&amp;P 500. I&#39;m like, &quot;This is easy.&quot; Like, there&#39;s real value that I can generate great returns for my clients. And um uh you just got to look for it and look where skate to where the puck&#39;s going, not where it already is. &gt;&gt; Talking about where it&#39;s going next, let&#39;s talk about earning season. That&#39;s coming up. Uh Jared, what&#39;s coming earning season? Is is this going to be a a positive catalyst for the market? &gt;&gt; I do think so. I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through here. And you know the thing about V recoveries is overbought can stay overbought for a while especially when there&#39;s so many people off sides and and who is off sides honestly the retail investor has been right since co and institutions have been too too pessimistic and they&#39;re still not at extreme levels so low secret to happiness low expectations expectations 4.8% 8% earnings growth down from 99 n and change. It&#39;s a bar you can step over. I think it&#39;s going to be stepped over. The key is going to be guidance and I think guidance is going to be better now that uncertainty is lifted a bit much certainly much more than when they were reporting for Q1. &gt;&gt; I hear some strategists saying interested to get your take on this that now more than ever they&#39;ll tell their clients you got to do your homework. What they mean is specifically they say Tom you got to figure out who has the pricing power right now to navigate tariffs and who doesn&#39;t. What do you make of that argument? I think there&#39;s definitely something to be said for that. I think the other side of that coin is the ones that don&#39;t have that pricing power have been repriced at such an extreme discount to the worst case scenario that you&#39;re probably getting more value there than looking for the ones that everyone&#39;s been crowding into that they think are completely unaffected by tariffs. &gt;&gt; Fair point. Thank you, Tom. I will say that the unintended consequence of removing these EV subsidies may may in fact be they&#39;re the last man standing as the Ribeanss go by the wayside as the big three invest less in EVs and more into hybrids. So I think there&#39;s always going to be a niche market for that on their base business. And then as you add in some of these factors like the humanoid robots, autonomous driving, uh you you got a lot of upside catalysts. I I invest more for free cash flow. So, this falls outside of my framework, but I could understand why people would be interested in betting on Elon Musk. He&#39;s proven himself over and over. He&#39;s like a cat. He&#39;s got nine lives and uh he&#39;ll come back with something that&#39;ll probably wow the world. &gt;&gt; Are you interested, Tom, in that broader robo taxi theme where Musk, of course, taking on Whimo? Does the space interest you long term? &gt;&gt; Yeah, it&#39;s interesting. I mean, when Musk announced that did that thing in Austin with uh one vehicle, a couple vehicles with drivers in it, the stock went up10 billion. Google&#39;s been executing on on all cylinders with Whimo. It gets absolutely zero credit attributed to the stock. So, uh I like the theme. Uh and the question is, is this going to be roll out? I I think Whimo&#39;s got the lead and I think Musk is going to try to figure out a way to catch them if not surpass them. &gt;&gt; All right, Pra. Thank you. And of course, a big thank you to Tom Hayes for hanging me with me this afternoon. Any final thoughts, Tom, for the audience? &gt;&gt; I think uh just be wary of you&#39;re going to see a consensus of people saying the market&#39;s now overbought, and a lot of those people are people who missed it. &gt;&gt; Uh V-shaped recoveries tend to push a little bit faster than everyone expects, even if they&#39;re unggrounded in the fundamentals. So, just be wary of that. We might push a little higher. Maybe we&#39;ll get some volatility in the fall, but the under underpinnings of the economy continue to be strong and the tax cuts, that one big beautiful bill, you could argue different sides of it. That&#39;s growth positive as Jose was saying earlier. Uh so, um we continue to be constructive. Just got to do a little more work under the surface to find the good opportunities. &gt;&gt; Overbought but can still move higher. Yeah, &gt;&gt; there you go. Thank you, Tom. Appreciate it. Coming up, a sea sweet shakeup. &gt;&gt; And we&#39;re back. And then I want to thank Diane King Hall and Maya Seal Schill for having me on the Schwab network. I love these next two. We go into picks in detail. I love talking about stocks. We&#39;ll listen in here. &gt;&gt; Investment strategies and stock picks. I&#39;m joined now by Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member Great Hill Capital. Tom, thank you so much for joining us today. Before we get into your picks and strategies, let&#39;s talk a little bit about uh the recovery because you have some thoughts on this a V-shaped recovery that we&#39;ve seen. You say overbought can stay overbought. What do you mean by that? &gt;&gt; Yeah, you know, I&#39;ve been doing this for a while as you know, Diane, and what I found is when you get these sharp V-shaped recoveries, the normal signals that you would get when we&#39;re in a regular range, when it gets overbought, you want to lighten up a little bit. They don&#39;t apply when you come 25% off the lows in three months. And actually what happens historically, uh, if you look back to 1950, on average, when the market&#39;s up 25% &gt;&gt; in 3 months, on average, the market goes up another 22.3% the next 12 months. That sounds crazy with the, you know, market trading at 22 23 times earnings. &gt;&gt; Uh, but you got to be open-minded. I c should we get some consolidation after such a big move? Yeah, we might get some sideways. We might get a little chop, but I wouldn&#39;t underestimate because it&#39;s what we call trapped bears. And a lot of people, not not so much retail, the retail investors have been the smart ones. &gt;&gt; They do say that the retail investors were the smart money this time around. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Since co actually every single dip, institutions are still behind the curve. They&#39;re still skeptical. And now they&#39;ve got career risk because they lightened up at the exact wrong time. They sold over a trillion dollars of equity in the hole and every new good headline, whether it&#39;s a deal, whether it&#39;s earnings coming in better than expectations, they are forced back in. And you know what? They&#39;re going to be forced in. They can&#39;t chase the stuff that already ran. They miss that. They have to chase the lagards that are playing the catch-up trade in order to have any chance of catching the indices. &gt;&gt; So, I&#39;ll talk a little bit more about that. So, then though, what makes you said if you go back to 1950, what makes this setup different than typical like late stage rally? Yeah, I I think you have a lot of pro business policy that has just been implemented. So, we went from bombing and tariffs and uncertainty to now tax cuts, growth, and we haven&#39;t even gotten to the biggest part of it, which is going to be massive deregulation, okay? Unleashing animal spirits. You have corporate balance sheets of the S&amp;P 500, the most underlevered they&#39;ve been in years, and personal household balance sheets, the most underlevered they&#39;ve been in years. So, what&#39;s gumming up the system? Why don&#39;t we have Animal Spirits and 3 1/2% 4% GDP growth? We have artificially high interest rates. Okay, there was a there was a Fed head on two days ago saying we&#39;re around the neutral rate. Listen, I have an 11year-old daughter in fifth grade. I can say to her the Fed funds rate is 4.25% inflation is 2.7%. Does that look neutral to you? And she would say no daddy, it looks like you could drive a truck through that. The gap is so &gt;&gt; No, she would say that for an 11year-old. Okay, maybe in your household. So you you&#39;re making a case that the laggers will need to play catchup. Where do you see opportunity within sectors or names when it comes to the laggers? &gt;&gt; Okay, so one we brought to you when everyone was scared in April and that was called advanced auto parts. You couldn&#39;t give this thing away. It got down to $30. Everyone thought it was going out of business. &gt;&gt; Shane &gt;&gt; in May. Oh my gosh, it was terrible. &gt;&gt; Okay, so number one, it&#39;s doubled off the bottoms. Number two, it&#39;s going to double again over the next couple of years. Why? Shane O Kelly, he came from HD Supply. Okay, this is a $7 billion business for Home Depot. He understands distribution. So what did he do? He took solveny risk off the table. He sold off the Canada business, used that money, paid down debt. Now solveny is no longer an issue. Then he said, &quot;Okay, the United States, the West Coast is doing terribly because the stores are all spread out. They don&#39;t have any critical mass. We&#39;re spending too much money. It&#39;s taking too long to get the products to the customers. We&#39;re just going to be a loser in that area. We&#39;re shutting down those stores.&quot; Then what does he do? Clean up balance sheet. Good. Clean up the unprofitable stores. Now he&#39;s back into growth mode. He&#39;s opening up a hundred new stores in the next three years in those areas only which he is number one or number two in the auto parts supply business. Uh which is going to create efficiencies which is going to create growth. And here&#39;s the kicker. He&#39;s going to have margins at high single digits within the next 24 to 36 months. The last time they had that the stock was $150. It&#39;s $60ish today. So that&#39;s why it&#39;s gone from 30 to 60. It&#39;s going to $120 over the next couple years. &gt;&gt; Okay. Because I was going to ask you if it&#39;s doubled, like how much more &gt;&gt; growth could it have? &gt;&gt; It&#39;ll consolidate the next few weeks, but if you take a 2-year view, it&#39;s going to double again. &gt;&gt; Okay. All right. Uh so the take a two-year view on that one from the point of view of Tom Hayes there. All right, Tom, let&#39;s talk about Canada Goose. That&#39;s on your list. It has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 year to date. Now, and a a chunk of that run came within the past month or so. &gt;&gt; Why does it have more room to run from your point of view? &gt;&gt; Here&#39;s the thing. And their coats are expensive. &gt;&gt; Their coats are super expensive. Um, so we like this in the high single digits and the low double digits. It&#39;s moved. However, it&#39;s still down 80 90% from its co highs. In the short term, the market is a voting machine based on emotion. In the long term, it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals. Let me tell you about these fundamentals. They have record revenues, record- free cash flow, and now record margins. So, why is the stock still down 90%. They&#39;re they&#39;re getting rid of their wholesale business, which is the lower margin business. They&#39;re all going DTC. The other thing is people going DTC. Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. 76 stores. You got the one on Fifth Avenue. You always see a line. But here&#39;s the kicker. Like all luxury brands, they go, &quot;Oh, not everyone can afford a $1,900 or $1,500.&quot; Yes. &gt;&gt; They&#39;re going 365. Raincoats, eyewear, shoes, t-shirts. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So, everyone can afford a piece of the brand. And it&#39;s huge. Not only in Asia, it&#39;s huge all over the world. Highquality stuff, family controlled. Family&#39;s got 39.5% of the stock. The son is running it. Danny is doing an incredible job. They&#39;re buying back stock. This is going to be a great recovery. It It&#39;s amazing. This is This is what This is my knitting. Okay. When fundamentals are improving, but the price is depressed, you play that divergence, and eventually short-term voting, long-term weighing, it will catch up to fundamentals. That&#39;s the story in Canada Goose. Does it pull back a couple bucks in the next? I have no idea. But over the next couple of years, this strategy is working. Margins are up. Uh all more and more people can afford their products. It&#39;s not just jacket &gt;&gt; because of their expanding. Quick 30 second final thought from you. I know you have another pick. You can either go there or final thought on the overall market. &gt;&gt; I think well National Oil Well Varco is the old name. Nov Inc. I love stocks. What can I say? &gt;&gt; That&#39;s all right. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; They&#39;ve got 50% of the market. They do onshore and offshore drilling rigs. They&#39;re the largest OEM and they have an install base uh bigger than anyone else which helps them with the cyclicality of the price. They&#39;re less sensitive to price. I want exposure to energy. I don&#39;t feel like the uh exploration and production companies have come down enough relative to the price of of oil. So, this is a way to play it. It&#39;s it&#39;s the cheapest it&#39;s been since 2001, right before it had a 10x run. The balance sheet is great. billion of cash, just over a billion dollars of debt, a billion dollars of free cash flow. They&#39;re not issuing shares, they&#39;re they&#39;re non-dilutive. So, if you think drilling is going to go up, which it will when rates come down, &gt;&gt; they&#39;re going to be a major beneficiary. And it&#39;s operating leverage is huge. So, that&#39;s a new one for us. We like it. And uh &gt;&gt; All right, that&#39;s a new one. You heard this here first. Well, I think first we&#39;ll popish, but I mean Tom is active on social media, so you can find more information there as well. Uh that&#39;s Tom Hayes joining us right now here on set the New York Stock Exchange, chairman of Great Hill Capital. &gt;&gt; And we&#39;re back. And then finally, thanks to Mel Montana&#39;s Christian Scher, who was out at Disneyland, by the way, doing an interview, I think, with Bob Iger and uh Caroline Woods for uh stepping in. We&#39;ll listen in here. &gt;&gt; Joining me for more on this and everything moving markets or that could potentially move markets today is Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. He joins me at the desk. Thomas, great to have you. &gt;&gt; Great to be here, Caroline. &gt;&gt; Thanks so much for kicking off this Wednesday with us. So, we had a a whole bunch of news at the top there. I think it&#39;s good to start with maybe PPI and your reaction to that because obviously CPI yesterday seemed good at the headline level and then investors sort of dug in and might have seen some some tariff impact and things like furniture and clothes. At the wholesale level, it&#39;s actually cooler than expected. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And wholesale tends to be the leading indicator. You know, if you look at uh core CPI yesterday, though, it&#39;s it&#39;s important to point out for the fifth consecutive month, it came in lower than estimates. That&#39;s number one. Number two, both headline and core were lower than January and February before tariffs kicked in. So, the case for rate cuts is starting to become stronger and stronger. And then PPI today, this is surprising, okay, to come in flat 0.0. all these people, the Fed included, rather than being data dependent, being prediction dependent, their predictions are proving to be incorrect. And I think there&#39;s going to be pressure uh to really start to consider at least a 25 basis point cut. 62 63% odds probably went up this morning for September. It should be July. Uh, and I do think if it&#39;s not July, which the odds are it won&#39;t be, we&#39;re going to hear who our next Fed chair is going to be next year, and that the market will start to discount a more doubbish Fed even if Powell sits in the seat until next May. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, would those expectations be incorrect about inflation ticking higher or have we just not seen the impact of tariffs really hit the inflation data yet? because we still don&#39;t know what overall tariffs are going to be. We have the 10% baseline, but we have threats about even higher tariffs and some sectoral tariffs that are, you know, already feeling the hit. &gt;&gt; Yeah, this is waiting for GDAU. I mean, it was supposed to be last month was going to be terrible. This month was going to be terrible. Powell&#39;s like, is it going to be terrible? I mean, um, what&#39;s what&#39;s comical about the summary of economic projections is that they in their own projections acknowledge it&#39;s a one-time bump. Okay, which we haven&#39;t really really seen here. And then at the same time, speaking out out of both sides of their mouth, they say real GDP is going to decline to 1.4%. That old dog don&#39;t hunt. You know, if if inflation&#39;s going up, you you you&#39;re not going to see that. So, um so pressure is going to be on, but I think as it relates to the overall market, it&#39;s a very unique situation because everything appears to be a little bit frothy, a little bit overbought. We&#39;ve moved over 25% off the lows in just 3 months. But I&#39;ve been doing this for two decades. And what I found is when you have these V-shaped recoveries, uh, they tend to stay overbought for a while because so many people got flushed at the lows and they have to play catch-up. As a matter of fact, since 1950 on average, when you have a 25% move off the bottom in 3 months, 12 months later, the market&#39;s up another 22.3%. That&#39;s a lot of data, 75 years. So, um, could we get some consolidation? Sure. But I wouldn&#39;t get too bearish here because Trump&#39;s strategy is he punches people in the face and then he offers them an ice pack and they&#39;re grateful. So yes, he escalates. He asks for 300 basis points of cuts. Maybe he gets 100. He asks for 30% or 50% or 100% tariffs. He winds up with 10 or 20, which is more than anyone thought he could get a year ago. Uh and it&#39;s proving to be positive. We ran a budget surplus last month. Record tariffs collected 27 billion. budget surplus right in line with 27 billion. So, uh, then you got tax cuts. You know, we went from bombs and tariffs to tax cuts and growth. And the next phase is going to be deregulation in a massive way for banks, which are going to be able to hold more treasuries with the SLR, supplemental leverage ratio. It&#39;s going to bring 10-year yields down. It&#39;s going to uh really really kickstart the housing market, which has been left for dead with artificially high rates. &gt;&gt; Is that priced in, do you think, at these levels? because there was expectation for deregulation, but if this is ultimately a market that can push higher, is it just playing catch-up or are there real fundamental reasons that this market should push higher? &gt;&gt; Yeah. And and I wouldn&#39;t be captivated by the general indices because they&#39;re overweighted to MAG 7 whose earnings have been de earnings growth has been decelerating all year and is going to continue to decelerate partially due to capex, partially because the rates were high. I think you could see a lot of companies under the surface, the unmagnificent 493 double and triple over the next couple years without moving the indices much because their waitings are still so low. So, this is going to be a really fertile ground for stock pickers doing bottom-up fundamental analysis that know what they own uh to make an incredible amount of money in a relatively reasonable amount of time. So, if investors have to be a bit more selective in terms of where they&#39;re deploying their capital, what&#39;s your best advice about where they should be doing just that? &gt;&gt; Well, I think you uh I think the housing theme that&#39;s been left for dead is a place to start to look. We&#39;ve got a couple turnarounds for you, but uh I you know, we own companies like Stanley Black &amp; Decker. They&#39;re a derivative play on housing and construction, which is 16.2% of the economy. We have Generrack which owns uh 75% of the home standby generator market. All of these are highly interest rate sensitive. And then we&#39;ve got Brad Jacobs company uh QXO which they bought Beacon Roofing Supply. He&#39;s going to do a roll up in building materials. And you know Brad Jacobs from XPO which was a 5060 bagger. You know him from United Rentals uh which was also a 5060 Bagger. He makes a lot of money for shareholders and QXO is just getting started. So those are on the housing theme. We were here with Kristen last month. We we talked about a stock called Advanced Auto Parts. Discre discretionary has gotten left for dead in the first half of the year. It&#39;s starting to outperform the second half as the consumer confidence comes back. This is a turnaround play. Shane O. Kelly came from Home Depot supply. Uh he&#39;s cleaned up the balance sheet, sold off the Canada business, paid down debt, shut the unprofitable stores. Now he&#39;s back in growth mode. 100 new stores in the next 3 years. The stock has doubled off the lows from last month. It&#39;s going to double again over the next couple of years. He&#39;s a winner. That&#39;s an opportunity. Uh, and then we got a couple more turnarounds. Which one do you want to hear first? &gt;&gt; Uh, well, we only have 30 seconds. So, &gt;&gt; let me give you a brand new one. National Oil Well, Varco. Okay. No OV, Inc., now they call themselves. Uh, leader in onshore and offshore drilling rigs. This is a way to get exposure to the energy sector. The demand for energy is going to continue to grow massively without taking massive underlying price risk because we don&#39;t know what the price of oil is going to do tomorrow or the next day. um 50% install base uh and they they have a pristine balance sheet, $1.2 billion of cash, only $1.7 billion of debt, 100 billion of free cash flow. They&#39;re not diluting shareholders, same share count. So, it&#39;s a hugely leveraged uh operating leverage play on the recovery in rig count over the next 2 3 years. We are going to drill baby drill, but we need rates to come down for it to be economic at $60 70 and they&#39;ll be a key beneficiary. &gt;&gt; Okay. And looks like you can potentially buy that dip. That one&#39;s down 12% year to date. Advanced Auto Parts up more than 30%. Year to date. We have to leave it there. Thomas Hayes, always appreciate your your stock picks and your insights. Thanks so much. &gt;&gt; Thanks for having me. &gt;&gt; That&#39;s Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital. All right. &gt;&gt; And we&#39;re back. So, I wanted to have a huge guest for uh episode number 300. And I literally reached out to all of our CEOs. What I didn&#39;t count on was the fact that they&#39;re all in a quiet period. Darren uh Brack and Daryl said as much his team was interested. Uh they are in a quiet period, so I&#39;m going to keep following up and try to get them in a a future episode month or so down the road. Um on uh uh Brad Jacobs, they were kind enough uh to respond out and I&#39;m going to be meeting him in the month of September, not for the podcast at this moment. Uh kind of a meet and greet. So we&#39;re I&#39;m excited for that when I&#39;m back on the East Coast and uh and grateful for that as well. So, let&#39;s get down to business here. The wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds and the rest of the time they don&#39;t. It&#39;s just that simple. That&#39;s Charlie Munger. And then Buffett, what counts for most people in investing is not how much they know, but rather how realistically they define what they don&#39;t know. And what you can tell if you&#39;ve been listening for a while, and most of you have, uh, we stay in our lane. We eat our own cooking and we stick to where we have an edge and we love turnarounds. We love high-quality businesses that are temporarily marked down and we continue to do it over and over and many of you have really benefited immensely. Uh and I&#39;m grateful for all your feedback. We had some amazing um uh emails this week and uh super grateful for that. Also very grateful for all of you who have supported the podcast uh that can&#39;t afford to become clients and are either on the trade service or um you know buying the merch and sending in your photos. Let&#39;s get let&#39;s get a bunch more photos in ladies and gentlemen because the orders are pouring in. You can get a hat like this t-shirt golf thing. You just go to hedge funips.com click on the hat here. It&#39;ll take you to the merch store and get your photo up. Be part of the community. That&#39;ll be fun. Now the question on everyone&#39;s mind uh is are we overbought? And if you gathered anything from my appearances, the answer is yes. And it doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re going to crash. And it doesn&#39;t mean that we&#39;re not going to go higher either. Um and even if we got some short-term consolidation, what&#39;s the difference? So, I had um you know I talked to my clients and and many of them are now good friends uh and and they&#39;ll reach out and one one was saying oh the market market&#39;s overbought and I replied and I said yeah I know that and so does everyone else and which one of the companies that we own uh together do you feel is trading at or above its intrinsic value? And it, you know, there were crickets and then there was, you know, we got on the phone and it was like, yeah, you know, that&#39;s that&#39;s that&#39;s why that&#39;s why I pay you to do what you do because the answer is none of them. You know, we know where we&#39;re getting out of these companies before we get in. So, if they&#39;re right and it&#39;s overbought or whatever and we consolidate sideways or we get a little chop, it makes no difference. And I and I want to illustrate um the core concept that we&#39;ve tried to instill over the last 300 episodes, which is to zoom out and separate yourself from all the noise and focus on what matters. Focus on the underlying fundamentals. Don&#39;t get caught in the short-term emotional voting machine that people think that they can predict whether the next move in the market is two points 2% up or 5% down. All of that is complete and utter Okay, I can say that I earned that in in episode 300. Um, but I want to go through some of these names because, you know, Advanced Auto Parts, it&#39;s it&#39;s now doubled off the bottom in a in a matter of weeks. Is this overbought? If we were to pull up the daily chart, would this look a little bit like, oh, it&#39;s gotten far ahead? Yeah. But here we&#39;re looking at the monthly chart. And what we can realize, and this is really good for all the new C clients that came in this quarter, and a ton of you did, and a ton of you added money. And I think it&#39;s because you understand the framework enough to say, wait a second, if we&#39;re looking under the surface, the game hasn&#39;t even begun. Look at this thing. It&#39;s It&#39;s up a 100% in a couple of months and it literally has not even begun its recovery. This is going When I talked to um Diane King Hall and I said it&#39;s going to double again and she said why? And I went through all the reasons. I was being conservative. Ladies and gentlemen, this thing is so yes, it&#39;s up 100%. Could it pull back to 50 before it goes to 100? Of course it could. But are we going to take a tax event just because we don&#39;t want five minutes of short-term volatility? That&#39;s not the type of client I attract. That&#39;s why I do these podcasts because the people that come to me are business-minded, successful people who take the short-term noise, don&#39;t get faked out by the short-term headlines in exchange for the long-term big rewards. And that&#39;s what we&#39;re talking. So, I&#39;m going to go through, you know, quick sampling of zoomed out charts, which is more the most valuable thing I could teach you. um because we do do the granular fundamentals and we do do the earnings calls and we do do the financials and we do do the ask me anything. But just to show you for those of you who think you want to time the market because it looks frothy right now, um be careful what you&#39;re selling. I mean, if you&#39;re selling the Momo stocks and the shiny objects that have had this quick rebound, you&#39;re you&#39;re probably totally right, by the way, or shorting them. Uh if you&#39;re selling some of these that are just getting going, you&#39;re going to miss the whole boat. you&#39;re absolutely going to miss it at the exact wrong time. You waited through all of this not noise and now you&#39;re getting paid. You&#39;re going to sell out because you&#39;re scared about some headline or some silly stupid thing when the game is just getting started. What about Albamaro, which looks like it&#39;s absolutely flown. And by the way, it has. Last month I was pitching Kristen Scher. She wasn&#39;t there this month on Albamaro when it was in the 50s and now it&#39;s at $75. It went from 49 to 75 in two months. But when we zoom out, this has not begun. So yeah, it&#39;s up 50% in a couple of weeks and zoom out and the party hasn&#39;t even started yet. I would put new money to work today in this name even though it&#39;s up and it makes it harder psychologically to do Boeing. Okay, that&#39;s had a monster run. It&#39;s up from uh 135 to 231 from when we were on Vney pounding the table. Buy it at 135. Everyone&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, they can&#39;t. The doors are falling off.&quot; All this That doesn&#39;t matter. It matters. Look, it matters. Obviously, safety is important, but they got the right guy running it. They have an engineer running it now. People are going to be safe. Um, United on the other hand, not so happy with those those guys. They are going to be giving me a lot of effing miles. That that I can tell you right now. But, um, uh, so Boeing, yeah, it&#39;s come a long way. It&#39;s up almost 100% in a few months, but in the long-term scheme of things, in a duopoly, it hasn&#39;t even started. So, do you trim some? Yeah, we trim the options a few weeks ago. We made a lot of money on the options. Can we trim a little stock? You can. You can to make room for stuff, but this thing is going to keep going. So, you know, don&#39;t get faked out. Baba, everyone&#39;s going sideways because Baba went to 144, back to 15, 105 or whatever. It&#39;s up from 55. Number one. Number two. Okay, someone said to me today, &quot;Oh, Bob is struggling.&quot; I said, &quot;What? The price or the fundamentals?&quot; Because the fundamentals that I look at keep getting better. They continue to build their moat as the number one AI player in the world in my view. Number two, number one retailer in the world. I mean, how do you grow top line when you have the biggest e-commerce business in the world? Like, how do you have that growth rate of high single digits, low double digits when you&#39;re already doing a billion people? And they figured out a way to do it. So, this one is just sitting waiting for the deal with Xi and Trump and it&#39;s going to be off to the races. And this is the perfect setup and I talked about it two weeks ago. Um if I was running this stock as like as like you know people say uh people make up in their mind they say like oh stocks are manipulated because they they don&#39;t want to take responsibility for their own actions. But if if there was a way to manipulate this stock this is exactly the way I would make it look. I would have people absolutely despondent at 65 puking in the hole. I&#39;d get as many headlines in as many newspapers as possible saying the world was ending in China and everything was done to just get every last person who had stock up here to give me their stock in the 60s and and the 50s. And then as soon as they were just completely capitulation, completely uninvestable, completely the world is over, delist the stocks, all the worst headlines to scare everyone out of the stock of one of the greatest cash flow generators in the entire world at the lowest prices. I&#39;d run it straight up the flag for 150 to get the suckers back in because they just missed more than a double 150% move off the top. And once we get the morons back in, you take it right back down to 100 to get them back out again before you make the final run. This is like textbook 101. How to absolutely destroy people in a stock. And that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happening now. And I got to tell you, some of the weak hands have been puking out at 105 or 110. This gave me the first opportunity in many, many quarters to be able to put brand new clients in Alibaba below $110. I never thought that would come again. I was prepared if it did. It came and now we&#39;re we&#39;re going to be off to the races. You&#39;re going to wake up one morning. There&#39;s going to be a deal between Trump and Xi. Trump has dialed down the stuff. He allowed Nvidia now to sell their H20 chips to China as a complete olive branch and we are going to be off to the races with or without you. So that&#39;s that. Uh Baxter. Okay. this thing. It&#39;s just it&#39;s in healthcare. Healthc care is getting beat down until it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s no different than early 2000s, which we&#39;ve done the analog over and over. They&#39;ve got the new CEO. This one will be fine. So, you know, we could go through a bunch more, but again, all these stocks that look like they&#39;ve totally taken off haven&#39;t even gotten started. CCI, this is a rates play. You&#39;re going to see that happen. um as this stuff Cooper Standard. Okay, th this thing is just getting started. We&#39;ve got the uh interest deductibility on new cars made in America now. We got the volume&#39;s picking up. I talked to you saw the thing uh Ford had its largest month ever. I talked to a buddy playing golf in Connecticut. He runs one of the largest Toyota dealers in the country and he said it was their biggest month ever. It&#39;s incentives. The game is on. This thing is early days and you people are so some of you are so impatient. You&#39;re making so much money and you want to make so much more in such a short period of time. Just chill out. Let the money come to you. It&#39;s coming, baby. The work is done. Um, and most of you saw it last quarter. So, you know, uh, pat yourselves on the back for being in the right place at the right time with the right manager. What can I say? Uh, comtock. Okay, so this has to consolidate. I had some guy said, &quot;Oh my god, it&#39;s gone down from 31 to 23 in a few weeks.&quot; Like We&#39;re up from $7 a share. Of course, it&#39;s going to consolidate. It did the exact same thing in 2002, 2003. It goes up. It consolidates and comes back. Takes out the weak hands, the idiots who bought at 30, chased it up. Take them take them out. Let them puke it down at 20. We&#39;ll potentially buy some more at 20 and ride it up to 50 and then everyone will want it at 50 and we&#39;ll start to lay some off. Dagio, okay, they just got a new CEO finally. They&#39;ve had two morons running the business for the last two iterations. And uh you know, Buffett, our investment in Dagio is pretty darn simple. Buffett said, &quot;Buy a business that&#39;s so good that even a ham sandwich could run it because one day a ham sandwich will.&quot; And we&#39;ve had two ham sandwiches. So now I think you&#39;re going to find uh I I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if you got an Irishman in there from Dagio to run the damn thing and uh and take it up the flag pole because the brands can&#39;t be competed with and people still want to escape and they&#39;re the best in the game for premiumization emerging markets. They&#39;re best positioned. They just had morons running it. So, uh, but you you you can, you know, they&#39;ve worked overtime to try to destroy it, but it&#39;s just one of those businesses you can&#39;t do. Like Boeing, like they tried for 5 years, you know, the salesman who ran it before Ortberg, uh, tried his very best to destroy one of the greatest businesses in mankind and and he just simply couldn&#39;t do it. Uh, Disney, another one. Okay. Yeah, it&#39;s up 50% in a few weeks. So, could it pull back down to 110? I don&#39;t know. Who cares? It&#39;s going a lot higher. They have a moat. What they do in terms of the streaming, they&#39;ve got half the streamers as Netflix. They got zero attribution for that streaming business, which is just getting started. Same thing in 1984 when they transformed their library uh uh over to um VHS. It took a while to gain traction and then boom, it was a money machine. Their cruises are 20% return on invested capital. They&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re they&#39;re growing those out. They&#39;ve got the Abu Dhabi park. They got the movies. And people are like, &quot;Oh, should I sell it?&quot; Yeah, sell it. It&#39;ll go down to 110. Are you gonna buy it at 110? I mean, um, let&#39;s stay louder. Here&#39;s another one straight up in the last few weeks from $48 to $86. It hasn&#39;t begun. It&#39;ll go back to $60 and retest or whatever. Or it won&#39;t. It doesn&#39;t really matter. And it&#39;ll just work its way higher over time. Why? because it&#39;s one of the greatest businesses ever built in the history of mankind. It&#39;s 75 years old. They buy and sell brands. People think it&#39;s one brand. It&#39;s a dozen brands. They got the hot new brands for the young people, the Korean stuff that the K-pop people wear that, you know, danced at the concert for my daughters. They&#39;re going to be great. Okay. I walk into Fox Business and my favorite person, Yasha, says, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s get that makeup on. Get rid of your rings under your eyes. That&#39;s my thing. I always have my hair sticking up like alalfa in the back. Teresa combs that down. And then I got these big rings under my eyes cuz I stay up late looking at stock stock charts and reading fundamentals and all that stuff. And um and uh and what does she do? She pulls out her Mac. MAC is one of Estee Lauder&#39;s brands. She puts it on. Boom boom boom. No more rings. I like why do you use Mac? Why don&#39;t you use other stuff that&#39;s cheaper? She&#39;s like because nothing&#39;s better. That&#39;s all you need to know. On to the next. Etsy impatience. Record free cash flow. Hang in there. That&#39;s going to be fine. Just getting started. Yeah, it&#39;s up a bit. So, so it&#39;s like, okay, the market&#39;s overbought. Which one should we sell first? That&#39;s on that&#39;s on the that you Yeah, it&#39;s a lot of them are up 50% and 100% in the last couple of months, but every single one of them have have at least one to in some cases nine more bags left in them. So, you want to sell it now thinking that you&#39;re going to save half a bag and buy it back and pay taxes anyway and not wind up making or do you want to just be smart and sit back, suck up any short-term volatility and just ride it through, finish the year super high, super happy, and uh onto the next gener thing down to 100. It&#39;s up 50% in a few weeks. Well, we didn&#39;t buy it for 150 bucks, okay? at whether at 90, whether at 10 105, wherever you came in to be a client. We bought this thing for well above 200 and beyond, and it&#39;s not even started. So, yeah, it&#39;s up 50%. We&#39;re happy. The P&amp;L is looking great. Everyone&#39;s smart in a bull market, but on a business basis, long-term weighing machine, these things are not even started. Goose, Goose is up over 100% in the last two months. Okay? It&#39;s got record free cash flow, record margins. um um record revenues and people are saying is it overbought? This thing&#39;s still down 80%. It has more cash flow, more revenues, more margins per share, not non-dilutive. The family owns 39.5 and it&#39;s still down, you know, 60 70%. This thing is just beginning the 365. Listen to the interview with Dian GXO, new CEO. The game is back on. They got the approval of um of the Winkington deal. Okay. They they haven&#39;t even started to juice out the free cash flow and earnings of the synergies of that combination. It&#39;s going to be unbelievable. There&#39;s a reason the government asked whether it was a monopoly because when it&#39;s together, it&#39;s going to be very very very profitable. Okay? So whether it&#39;s uh you know they got through that. Okay? So leave it at that or Mel. It&#39;s a defensive. defensives hasn&#39;t done well because everyone&#39;s been buying, you know, Shitcoin and Trumpcoin and all that stuff. It&#39;s not the environment for defenses, but it will be. So, if we get a little rockiness in some of these names in the fall, this these type of names will do really well. The Backaxers, the Hormels, the ones that are doing nothing right now. Intel, Lip Boutan, I I mean, yeah, it&#39;s up a few points, but it&#39;s not even begun. So, you know, I I&#39;m just trying to go through some of these names. National Oil Well, Varco, it&#39;s gone up a couple points. This is exactly what it did in the early 2000s. It starts to recover, goes back, fakes everyone out before the big run. And I think we&#39;re we&#39;re going to start that in the energy sector imminently. And I wanted to have a little bit more exposure than just com stock resources. So, if there&#39;s not room in your portfolio, you&#39;ve been around for it, you, you know, pick up a couple shares if you think it makes sense. We&#39;re going to go through that analysis. Uh new people, you&#39;re you&#39;re getting shares as you&#39;re coming in. Um but that&#39;s a good one. And then PayPal, yeah, it&#39;s up a lot from 55 to 73 in a in a couple of months. We&#39;re not in it for anything under 150. So like chillax. Okay. If we go back to 65 before we go to 150, so be it. No big deal. Okay. QXO again. This has been a double. Now it&#39;s back to 22 from $25. Relax. Brad Jacobs is going to be doing more deals. There&#39;s no question about it. They&#39;ve explicitly told you that&#39;s what they&#39;re going to do. Um Stanley Black &amp; Decker again up to 70 from 53. Hasn&#39;t even begun. I mean, this looks almost picture for picture what it looked like in the early 2000s, which is an analog we&#39;ve drawn on a lot of reasons. They get this final spike down and to get absolutely everyone out of the 125year stock. They think a hammer company is going out of business. You can&#39;t make this up. Okay. And then what happens? They run it straight up the flag pole 3x. Watch what happens over the next 6 to 12 months when the new land comes online. When the 10-year yields at 375, when mortgage rates are at 59, this thing&#39;s going to go to 140 before you can even blink an eye. And people are saying, &quot;Is it overbought?&quot; Because it&#39;s up 50% in two weeks. So, I&#39;m I&#39;m it sounds like I&#39;m being tough, but I&#39;m trying to drill down a lesson that if you get it, this is this is a perfect example. VF Corp., okay, this you cannot make up. Go to a store and see all the action that&#39;s going on. go see the new product that&#39;s in there by the van way. Vans is just one part of the business, but he&#39;s going to turn it. This is exactly what it did in the early 2000s when everyone was chasing shiny objects. This thing ran down and then it runs right up, gets everyone in, pulls right back down, scares everyone. This time it was tariffs. They were afraid of $150. All you need to do is look at PPI and CPI to realize that tariffs had zero impact or very little impact. Um and uh and this thing will be back over $50 in a reasonable amount of time, a couple of years. And everyone will say, &quot;What happened?&quot; Well, what happened was Tom and Co. Great Hill Capital has been buying every effing share that&#39;s been offered on the market for the last three weeks that we could get our hands on. While everyone else is saying, &quot;Uh, could you look at their balance sheet? I think they&#39;re still leveraged.&quot; Meanwhile, they just sold Supreme and paid down $ 1.5 billion of debt. They got other assets they can sell if they need to. They&#39;re going to be just fine. Bracken knows exactly what he&#39;s doing and we&#39;re betting on the jockey. Um, so what else you want to talk about? We&#39;re done. No, I&#39;m kidding. We&#39;re just getting started. We got a lot to cover. 300. Uh, I got to All right, so let&#39;s get going here. Look, I&#39;ve been up for 24 hours. I can go all day long. So, all right. So, here people shorting in the hole. Hedge funds are doing what? They&#39;re shorting at the exact wrong time just like they do every time when you see these extremes. Small caps are going to keep running. Big rotation. What&#39;s not worked the first half? Energy healthcare discretionary. What&#39;s working the most in the beginning of the second half? Energy healthcare discretionary. So you know that your discretionary are your VF corps, your advanced auto parts, your Canada goosees, all the stuff that you couldn&#39;t give away. Now consumer confidence is coming back. That&#39;s where it&#39;s going to be. What did everyone bet on in the first half? Comm services financials. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to perform nearly as well in the second half. Uh large cap value relative price index versus the US dollar. So you can see that as you invert the dollar. So the dollar is weakening and as the dollar weakened Russell 1000 large cap value. So you could see here as the dollar weakened inverted which would mean the red line goes up is the dollar weakening you saw value start to dramatically outperform uh the S&amp;P which is basically growth because it&#39;s cap um cap weighted and that&#39;s what we&#39;re starting to see uh now we should start to see and it works on a lag basis as you can see here as well. QXO got upgraded this week. Price target $33 by city. Customs duties, we talked about it in the hits record $27 billion collected. S&amp;P500 following Zwag breath thrust signals 1957 to date. They tend to persist for a long time. Um, average home price is going down by the way. affordability is going up. Defensive big snack stocks, you know, I talked to some people that are in this business with major companies and their view across the board, whether it&#39;s alcohol, chips, candy, etc., big big companies is that what&#39;s the the the perceived impact from GLPs and other things um troughed a couple of quarters ago and now the volumes are starting to recover. So I think you&#39;re going to see an enormous amount of value in alcohol stocks, candy stocks, junk food stocks, packaged food stocks, all that stuff. that noise is over and I think there&#39;s going to be a period of volatility that defenses will start to out form and you&#39;re going to be able to buy some of this stuff really really inexpensively right now to take advantage of that. Um inflation break evens are back down. That&#39;s from Fundstrat too exposed to stocks. National Association of Active Investment Managers. So this shows that could potentially have some short-term consolidation. They&#39;re chasing up now. Um, what I don&#39;t love about this one is it doesn&#39;t go back to 2000 where this was elevated for a while and the market just kept going up and up and up. You could almost think of it like this. Like this is the first bite here, spike off a trough that we&#39;re having here off this big trough and people are doing this. Why isn&#39;t he pointing to this? Why is he only pointing to this to to make his point? And I think you&#39;re probably closer to this based on just what I look under the surface. If I look at the S&amp;P, I say, &quot;Oh, this looks like it&#39;s frothy.&quot; But if I look at do work, you know, emerging markets, this is going to break through here and this is going to be a huge thing along with small caps. Um, macro conditions getting easy. Hasn&#39;t been this easy since the beginning of 2024, which was a good period. the beginning of uh July of 2020 when they really eased things and the market kept going even though it was overbought. Same with 16, same with 14. So, you got to be open-minded. Uh 7.1 trillion in money markets. I know Acman had a tweet out this week bullish. Um yeah, look, a lot of people are bullish that were bearish in the hole. So, you do have to be alert, but that&#39;s why we try to just again look under the surface, zoom out. Yeah, we could be shortterm a little bit, but on a name by-name basis, I think these things are going to run because the managers that missed it, which is 90 literally 90% of in institutional managers, uh they&#39;re going to they have to buy the lagards now. They have to catch up. Vanguard&#39;s outlook for financial markets completely worthless. um they serviced our uh p pension in Ridgefield, Connecticut when I served on the pension commission for 7 years. They were wrong every single year. It was comical. I used it to like as Tinder to help light the fire in the in the fireplace when we had guests over to the house. Uh small cap versus large cap. Small outperforms large since March of this year. UK starting to outperform US. All the things clicking into place. Stable coins could become a significant new source of demand for treasuries. We&#39;ve covered that. CPI follows a string of soft releases. We covered that. Five months in a row below expectations, lower than before tariffs. We expect modest affordability relief over the next two years. Who&#39;s this from Goldman Sachs? Uh, another clue. who are going higher from Carson. Oh, we covered this three-month gain. That&#39;s Ryan Carson over at Dietrich up returns after three-month rally up 22.3%. V control equity exposure forced into chasing the squeeze. We&#39;ve covered that in past weeks. Share of young adults living with parents stayed the same in 2024. This is sad. This is Jay Powell and co. Uh, this chart alone should be enough to fire him for cause, but he&#39;s going to sit in the seat. So, they should just name the next person. Name a dovish person. Let the market price it in. If he wants to show up to work and get free coffee for 9 months, let him do it. Um, S&amp;P 500 dividend yield plus treasury yield. So on a lagging basis, yield should be going up here or dividend yield should be going up or treasury yield should be coming down. I think both are going to happen. I think they&#39;re going to be in the middle. Spending growth in the Bank of America credit card data picked up in June across all major categories. So that&#39;s good to see. Um led by home improvement, by the way. That&#39;s really interesting. Clothing very good. General merchandise, lodging was down a little bit, restaurants were up, Dow Jones transportation average. This is not the type of formation, if you&#39;re a chartist, that you see at market tops. This is what you see before breakouts. And um yeah, we should be paying attention to FedEx and UPS with a chart like this. We already have Boeing, so that&#39;s good. Maybe start to look at some of the railroads, Estee Lauder Companies. What&#39;s this? Um, upgraded opinion follows trend. The thing runs from 60 to 80. Now they upgrade it to 110. Buy rating 30% upside potential after it ran from 50 to 85. So now you understand how the game works, how sell analysts keep their jobs. Big ticket spending, new vehicles through the roof. Through the roof. That&#39;s going to continue. valuation signal stronger price returns for the equal weighted S&amp;P 500 than the cap weighted couldn&#39;t agree more. Value ma valuation matters little in the near term but is almost all that matters in the long term. price to normalize earnings predictive power on subsequent holding period returns since 1987. Consensus expects 4% earnings growth in 2Q. This is what I talked about. Secret to happiness is low expectations. Bar has been brought down from 9.8 to four and change. We&#39;ll beat by three or 400 basis points and that should be fuel for things to push a little bit higher in coming weeks. percent of stocks above the 20day moving average. All right. Well, that&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s what you see in long-term doorbell rallies, especially coming off the lows. See, this is where, and this is where people get faked out. So, right here that you had a V-shaped recovery in COVID looked like we were overbought. They did consolidate a little bit. Uh, and then you got these number of days above 20-day moving average, but it was only halfway through the rally. When you come off these V&#39;s, just like up here, it tends to persist. That&#39;s why I&#39;m saying don&#39;t get too cute here. If we were in a range, you&#39;d all be right about your overbought signals or whatever technical indicators you&#39;re looking at and think you have an edge that no one else is looking at it. Like the edge is knowing what everyone else consensus has from those indicators and actually doing the opposite. But um but especially on V-shaped recoveries, you got to be super careful. Rising home prices and stock prices boost households. Magnificent 7 total returns year-to- date. Tesla down 22%, Apple down 15%, Google down 4%, Amazon basically flatline, S&amp;P now up 7%. I mean that&#39;s uh joke. So Microsoft is held up, Meta is held up, and Nvidia&#39;s held up. Recession odds in 2025 versus forward price to earnings. Single stock put call skew shows balanced positioning among short-term hedge fund and retail traders. We expect positioning to neither be a headwind nor a tailwind this earning season. So earnings is the name of the game. It&#39;s a coin flip and with expectations so low, it probably resolves a bit higher. Chinese exports reach record high in first six months of the year. Record high. Not in the headlines. Boeing&#39;s China jet deliveries are rising on the trade thaw. Another thing no one&#39;s paying attention to. China&#39;s economy maintains strong growth in the second quarter, 5.2% by the way. And everyone&#39;s saying, &quot;Wow, they&#39;re slowing.&quot; 5 When&#39;s the last time we saw 5.2%. ch stocks shine when sector strength is all or nothing. Again, look at this instance coming out of such a thaw. You get to this quote unquote overbought. It&#39;s the beginning of the rally, not the end. When you come out of these dramatic draw downs, it&#39;s the beginning. Doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t get a little consolidation. It&#39;s the beginning. Consolidation. Sure, we could get some consolidation. Uh I think more likely we&#39;re going to push higher and then consolidate to the breakout level similar to what we saw. So you know we&#39;ll shoot well above to new time highs and then come back and and test it before kind of consolidating for a while. Prime book consumer staples allocation to European equities rises to 4year high. So probably a little pullback in that soon. Short dollar becomes the most crowded trade for the first time. Of course, we get the counter trend bounce we&#39;ve been talking about. FMS cash level drops to 3.9 triggering sell signal. This was the only thing I&#39;ve ever seen Hartnet do wrong because if you actually put all of his other quote unquote sell signals up, they&#39;re actually kind of bullish um or mixed at best. And I think Zakardi did it. Mike Zakardi um someone else did it. I Jeff missed that chart, but um this is not indicative particularly when it immediately when it first immediately gets there. Biggest three-month rise in risk appetite on record. Okay. But um so this was a little bit of a no January 2001 was not January 2002. So that ran another year after that. This one ran another two years uh uh January 2013. June 2009, totally overbought and it ran another two years. January, 2002, again, totally overbought in sentiment, ran another two years. It&#39;s called the catchup, the catchup trade. The catch-up trade. Uh, Americans now spend more on healthcare than groceries or housing. That kind of makes sense in terms of the age of the population and what&#39;s happened to different inflation of products which I think Trump is going to continue to uh to work on asset managers plus hedge fund managers net positioning. So, they&#39;ve been so underweight as the markets moved up, which is what what makes me think that we, you know, even get a pullback, we&#39;re going to keep pushing higher and force them back in. There&#39;s a pony in the healthc care p pile. This is from Ned Davis Research. Hyperscaler Capex, Wall Street International Bank. Uh, Wall Street international banks upgrade China GDP outlook. Previous forecast was 4.1. Now it&#39;s up to 5.1. Wow, that&#39;s a huge upgrade. UBS similar. Morgan Stanley upgrades them. They&#39;re all pushing towards five. They were all below four and a half and below. Um, Goldman even went up and SCB went up huge. Hang near its highest since 2022. Mainland China investors have been buyers of Hong Kong stocks. Home price inflection point. New highs happen in clusters. We&#39;re not seeing that clustering yet. So, that&#39;s going to keep happening. Total short interest again really elevated towards what you see at lows, not highs. We&#39;ve seen some value areas outperformed magnificent. By the way, one of the things that we always like to look at is skew. And I would say there&#39;s nothing at the moment about skew that makes me worry about a big 10% plus move. I&#39;d be more concerned when it&#39;s up above 150 and the market keeps pushing higher. It&#39;s it&#39;s getting maybe in maybe in four four to six four to eight weeks it&#39;ll be up at that level when everyone&#39;s super pulled in and everyone&#39;s super complacent. uh and the smart ones have bought catastro catastrophe insurance which is basically what skew measures 10% outside of uh two standard deviation move downward. Um then I then I&#39;d start to get cautious and and if skew goes there implied volatility is going to be super down which means it&#39;ll be super cheap to buy insurance and at which time we&#39;d probably put a little bit on. Okay, let&#39;s get back to it. streaks of weaker than expected core CPI. Oh, we covered this five in a row. ETF flows since April 8th low. It&#39;s gone into crypto and value. That&#39;s pretty wild. Value even more than growth. T bills. What has it gone out of? Levered long small caps. China. So, these are the ones where you&#39;re going to get juice in the next move. China small cap. These probably actually take a breather. H, who&#39;s that from? What&#39;s the source? We need sources for everything. Oh, Todd S. Okay. Retail activity has increased to the highest level since 2018. Yeah, but look, look, they were the ones buying in 2020 as well. Like I said, they&#39;ve been right since COVID. Retail institutional investors have been wrong. So, I view this as a good sign, not a bad sign. Historically, that wasn&#39;t the case, but since CO, they&#39;ve been right. US equity sentiment indicator flatline. Not extreme. Flatline, ladies and gentlemen. Oh, I like this. Summer sales event. 0% limited term APR finance. 0% down payment. Zero payments for 90 days. And it&#39;s no wonder that sales were up 70%. Here we go. Ford stores are absolutely ripping right now. This is from car dealership guy. Apparently, the new marketing programs are working. Blocked out the name. We were up 70% last month in Ford sales at our Ford store. the largest increase of any large store in the market. I think this new program that Ford launched 0000 is going to be massive. It&#39;s all about low upfront costs and getting that 0%. Beigebook mentions of slow and inflation. Inflation mentions have gone way down. Inventions of slow have gone up. And that&#39;s what need Powell needs to be focused on not his memoir S&amp;P cycle composite for 2025. This is from Ned David Research. So the implication is that it pushes higher into August, consolidates sideways until midocctober and then resolves higher for year end. I think this is a reasonable frame framework to look at. That&#39;s kind of how I&#39;m thinking about it. It just feels like we got more here because everyone thinks we can&#39;t and then you will absorb it, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get those massive. We got our 20% correction of the year. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re getting another one this fall. So, this will be like buy stuff under the surface and ride into the sunset into year end. Retail sales rebound in June as expected. PPI, this is a leading indicator, came in at 0.0 month. Year-on-year was lower than expected. Affordability gap is crazy town. Got to bring the rates down. S&amp;P 500 returns after new all-time highs 1990 to present. One year later up 11.6%. Percentage of overbought and overstocks sold stocks. This is from bespoke, showing less overbought. Okay, some news. Trump&#39;s U-turn on Nvidia spurs talk of grand bargain with China. This is a big deal. Uh, Trump softens tone on China to secure Xi summit and a trade deal. Wait till you see what Baba does if they when they get that thing done. China&#39;s new consumers don&#39;t want a house, they want lab boooo and bubble tea. So they want consumerism, which is great for Tao and T- mall. Wall Street banks lift China growth outlook after brighter quarter. Nvidia says US has lifted restrictions on AI chip sales to China. That&#39;s the H20. Xi signals China may finally tackle deflationary price wars. Uh so there was a race to the bottom in the delivery business which I think is a garbage business. Anyway, Baba participates in it but it&#39;s it&#39;s not meaningful. Um, so that&#39;s good. US home prices are losing steam with most big markets below peak. That&#39;s actually positive. Trump tax law is surprise boon for affordable housing creation. tax and spending law makes significant changes to the lowincome housing tax credit, the new markets tax credit and opportunity zones, which are expected to spur construction of new apartment buildings and renovation of older ones, positive development and addressing the housing affordability crisis. But some experts say Jeff All right, so you can read that over Bloomberg. A second push for Mikey&#39;s federal land sales. They&#39;re going to get that the federal lands open one way or another. Feds Waller doubles down on July rate cut. It&#39;s not political. Crypto regulation bills move forward after record setting. House vote. Stable coins helps PayPal sixth largest issuer stable coins. Helps demand for treasuries. Lower rates helps housing 16% of the economy. Market rotation puts shine on S&amp;P 500 losers as winners trail. Investors are taking profits and pivoting into underperforming sectors fueling a reversal in US equities. Some themes have gone a bit too far. Seems like we&#39;re on the cusp of at least some profit taking but could turn into a full reversal. Stretch valuations are partly to blame for the rotation. This is what I said. They missed it. They&#39;re buying the lagards and that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to benefit. That&#39;s why it&#39;s like, well, which specific company that that we own together do you think is trading well above intrinsic value and we should sell? And the answer is zero or we would have sold them already. Bank of America says toy sentiment to spark rotation, not retreat. I like that. That&#39;s probably hardnet. He&#39;s a smart guy. I don&#39;t subscribe to Reuters, though. All right. Battered dollar a boon for US multinational companies. That&#39;s going to be reflected in second half earnings, which we&#39;ve been saying since Q1. Guinness owner Dagio to replace chief executive Deborah Crew. Thank God. Way too long to make that decision. Um, Estee Lauder, a late digital adopter, makes new push to reach shoppers online. That&#39;s why my daughters are talking about some of their brands at 11 and 13. Good ages for them to be targeted. I mean, you know, from a business standpoint, from a kid, they shouldn&#39;t even have a phone, but whatever. That&#39;s not all right. We&#39;ll talk about that another time. Trump to unveil 70 billion AI and energy investments. US tariff revenue climbs to fresh record for single fiscal year. Create we had a budget surplus last month, by the way, of 27 billion. First time in ages. Amazon Prime Day fuels 30.3% rise in US online spending. hardly the sign of a flagging economy. Uh there&#39;s a pony in this pile stock market and sentiment results. So for we didn&#39;t get you bracken and we didn&#39;t get you Brad for number 300, but we did get you a new name. Um so let&#39;s get to it here. First off, the fund manager survey. We put out a summary, the monthly Bank of America fund manager survey. Here are the five key points. Uh we covered the sell signal, so we&#39;ll skip over that. Second opinion follows trend. Allocation to European equities has climbed to a 4-year high with 41% of managers net overweight up from near 1% in January. We were we were on an island with that call heading into the year as part of our last Shelby first thesis pounding the table on international out performance thanks to a weaker dollar. Uh so you see more and more of that. This runs in cycles. We&#39;ll continue to cover this until you guys see that getting stuck in recency bias is not zooming out. When you zoom out, you see these trends where you can make fortunes if you pay attention. Uh three, 81% of managers now expect at least one rate cut, 47% expecting two. 42% of managers expect Q2 earnings to surprise to the upside. This has been a theme we&#39;ve been talking about recent weeks. bar hasn&#39;t been this low for quarterly earnings in nearly two years with estimates cut to just 4.8 from 9.3 earlier in the year. Yet another catalyst for the upside. Number five, now that the dollar&#39;s had its worst start to the year in 50 years, short the dollar is the most crowded trade for the first time ever. And just as you&#39;d expect when a dollar trade becomes obvious and the Johnny come lately pile in, the market does what it always does and flushes them out with the dollar seeing a solid short-term bounce off the lows over the past two weeks. National Oil Wellvarco. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast videocasts and or owned for clients including personally. So you can see we haven&#39;t seen these levels, you know, basically going back to the early 2000s. But what are we looking at? We&#39;re looking at cash flow reaceleration, revenue reaceleration, return on invested capital reaceleration, margin reaceleration, and debt deceleration. What about share count? Deceleration in share count margin acceleration. And yet you can&#39;t give this away. There&#39;s a pony in this pile. The joke comes concerns twin boys of five or six worried that the boys had developed extreme personalities. One was a total pessimist. The other was a total optimist. Their parents took them to a psychiatrist. First, the psychiatrist treated the pessimist. Trying to brighten his outlook. The psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with brand new toys. But instead of yelping with delight, the little boy burst into tears. What&#39;s the matter? the psychiatrist asked, baffled. &quot;Don&#39;t you want to play with any of the toys?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; the little boy baldled. &quot;But if I did, I&#39;d only break them.&quot; Next, the psychiatrist treated the optimist. Trying to dampen his outlook, the psych psychiatrist took him to a room piled to the ceiling with horse manure. But instead of wrinkling his nose in disgust, the optimist admitted just the yelp of delight the psychiatrist had been hoping to hear from his brother, the pessimist. Then he clamored on top of the pile, dropped to his knees, and began gleefully digging out scoop after scoop with his bare hands. &quot;What do you think you&#39;re doing?&quot; the psychiatrist asked, just as baffled by the optimist as he had been by the pessimist. &quot;With all this manure,&quot; the little boy replied, beaming, &quot;There must be a pony in here somewhere.&quot; &quot;So, uh, so that&#39;s what we got with National Oil Well, Varco in the oil sector. It&#39;s definitely a pile and we&#39;re going to find that pony as we did with com stock resources. There are many parallels between this classic pony in the pile joke and the energy sector right now. The sector has been in the doghouse all year posting some of the worst returns among all sectors and at this point you pretty much can&#39;t give it away. In fact, managers are only just coming off record low allocation levels from May and still net 23% underweight the sector. Meanwhile, energy&#39;s weight in the S&amp;P 500 has fallen back to all-time lows of just 3%, levels we haven&#39;t seen since oil went negative during the pandemic. That was an opportunity we happily took advantage of, buying as much Exxon Mobile as we could get our hands up on and ended up with a multibagger in short order. Those of you who are with us back in 2000 remember us buying Exxon Mobile hand overfist at $33. And by 2021, everyone wanted it close to $100. and we helped them out and it really didn&#39;t do a whole lot after that. Um, what makes us especially interested is that despite being essentially left for dead with record low exposure, the sector continues to see strong earnings growth revisions for 2026. It is now expected to deliver the highest growth of any sector with estimates calling for 20.8% earnings growth, bigger than tech. The kind of short-term voting machine versus long-term weighing machine divergence is music to our ears here at Great Hill Capital. And we&#39;ve wasted no time over the past couple weeks digging through the pile to find our next pony. Comtock has been our go-to name for exposure to the sector and a huge winner for us. But it has hasn&#39;t come down enough to justify putting new money to work. We then looked at opportunities in the exploration and production space. And while some names are starting to look cheap, they haven&#39;t pulled back enough relative to the underlying price of oil. But after combing through company after company, we finally found what we were looking for, our next pony. That brings us to our newest position, National Oil Well Varco, uh Nov or Nov Inc. I think they call themselves now, which we revealed during media appearances this week. Nov is the largest OEM of rig systems, both onshore and offshore oil and gas and drilling. They&#39;ve dominated more than half the market for over two decades and built the largest installed base of rig equipment in the industry. That positioning has allowed them to tap a lucrative aftermarket services business, creating a recurring high margin revenue stream that&#39;s helped somewhat insulate the company from usual cyclicality of oil and gas prices. Aftermarket now accounts for 24% of sales and has been a key driver behind the company&#39;s 14 consecutive quarters of IBIDA margin expansion. That kind of topline protection offers us highly attractive way to gain exposure to production without taking massive risk on the underlying commodity. On top of that, NLV has a rock solid solid balance sheet with $1.2 billion of cash, $1.7 billion of long-term debt, and the next debt maturity, not until 2029. Free cash flow is the name of the game in any turnaround, and NOV checks all the boxes as well, generating nearly $1 billion of free cash flow last year while sitting on a backlog of more than $4.4 billion. So, with the downside well protected, the next question is what does the upside scenario look like? As we like to say, we skate to where the puck is going, not where it already has been. For the past decade, the oil production story has been all about shale. But now, with many of those fields plateauing and starting to roll over and demand slowing, showing no signs of slowing, that leaves offshore as the only place left for growth thanks to new drilling technologies, many of which are credit to average offshore development. Break even costs have dropped from $75 a barrel to as low as $40 today. It&#39;s safe to say the economics are finally working again. Management is already seeing signs. The cycle is turning and the trend is starting to play out. NOV is tracking 14 potential FPSO projects, the most in three years with as many as 12 awards possible in 2025, each representing 100 million to 700 million in revenue. They also expect offshore development capex to grow more than 50% from 2025 to 2027 compared to the 2020 to 2024 average. As the cycle turns and more operators call up NOV for offshore, which already accounts for 45% of their sales, that is when operating leverage really starts to kick in. At that point, NOV will be swimming in more cash than they know what to do with. And while we wait for the cycle to rebound, they are returning at least 50% of the excess free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and buybacks with a current dividend yield of 4.1% and shares outstanding down 3.4% over the past year. Meanwhile, by the way, 4.1% dividend yield is pretty nice. Better than what T bills will be and um certainly a lot more upside, multiags of upside versus zero upside. Meanwhile, the market is still pricing NOV as if it&#39;s going out of business. The stock trades just over four times cash flow. Prices haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t seen since the 2001 lows right before the stock went on a 10x run. With rates coming down in production getting more economic uh paired with more favorable energy policy, we wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see NOV catch a similar cycle and go on another multi-bagger run. For months now, we&#39;ve been pointing out the similarities between today and the early 2000s. Whether it&#39;s small caps, international stocks, or value outperforming. But don&#39;t forget, this was also when energy quietly became the top performing sector of the decade. History does not repeat, but it often rhymes. Here&#39;s everything you need to know about NLV. So, you can go through these decks. We outline the the most important parts and the earnings call. And you can see on a granular level how they make their money and the outlook and so on and so forth. So you do see short-term sentiment is a little bit elevated here uh with national uh uh national active investment managers and with retail investors. Congratulations to all the new clients that came in uh during our Q1, Q2, and Q3 2025 raises. You could not be better positioned for what we believe will continue to be a highly rewarding remainder of the year in 2025. This view is based on what&#39;s already taken place in 2025 as well as much of the data we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on our podcast coupled with our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those views on your behalf. By the way, a lot of new clients have come in like, okay, you&#39;ve got a bunch of stocks on. Great. You were able to put to work. Where&#39;s the special options overlay? We will get that on over time because the way option pricing works, um, it&#39;s less liquid than the stock market. So we want to do it on days where we can really get bargains. So patience with that. Those take a few weeks. Uh but we take a long view on those and and and yes, we get a lot of excess return from from that expression and uh you&#39;ll have more expression than you know to do with. So uh uh that that takes a little longer to to get expressed than than the stocks themselves. Uh as of last week, our Q3 raise is officially closed. Congratulations. Uh that&#39;s for the small accounts, the 1 million to 5 million. Congratulations to everyone I had the pleasure of speaking with and on boarding last week. Most of you have already had your applications approved by IB and we&#39;ve begun deploying capital on your behalf. Uh larger or normal account sizes of 5 to 10 million plus can still access bespoke service and come in when whenever they want by clicking there. Um this is opinion not advice and not a solicitation. While you&#39;re at hedge fun.com, click on terms. Uh reat earnings top 30 weights earnings estimates have gone up by 4% for this year and 1.67% next year. Utilities uh flattish earnings down 19 basis points for this year up 26 basis points for next year. uh CPI and PPI both came in at levels that the Fed should be calling in the case of PPI which is leading indicator they should be calling emergency meeting and cutting 50 basis points. They won&#39;t do that. They&#39;ll wait till September and they&#39;ll probably get away with it. But I think it will give Trump cover to announce his Fed chair nominee which will act as a shadow Fed and um Powell will just come to the office, get free coffee for the next 10 months. Um earnings still holding up 300 bucks for next year. And that&#39;s it for the podcast. Let&#39;s get to the 300th Ask Me Anything questions. So, we got quite a bit. Um, here we go. First question. Uh, Marcel Bella, only recently discovered your podcast. Find it very informative and helpful. You mentioned farmer is interesting segment at the moment. What&#39;s your take on Regeneron? I think we covered Regeneron. I kind of I&#39;m I don&#39;t buy individual biotech stocks, but if I had to, that would be definitely one I&#39;d be interested in. You&#39;re worried that it didn&#39;t go to 400, it&#39;s at 550. I think if you bought it here for the long term, you&#39;re going to be okay. Um, but again, I I don&#39;t like individual biotech stocks. Um, that one might be an exception, but I have no urgency to buy either that or Biogen, which also continues to look attractive. Lewis Spzzio, hope you&#39;re doing well. wanted to reach out, express my gratitude and admiration for the work you&#39;re doing for Headphone Tip podcast. Been tuning in every week since August 24th. Can definitely say it changed my life. Thanks to you, I&#39;ve more than doubled my initial investment going from 22,000 to 45,000 in just one year. My dad has been following you longer, over two years now, and he&#39;s had backto-back years at 30% plus returns. Even my girlfriend, who I encouraged to get involved, is up over 20%. Made a real impact on all this. Okay. All right. I&#39;ll get back to you on that. He&#39;s asking for a I got it. Okay. All right. Well, thank you for the kind words. Uh, Guran Story Chickic, uh, love the show and all the riches that come along. The healthcare sector has dropped from 15.9% to 9.3% in S&amp;P. Do you expect more carnage? You believe now&#39;s the time to find another pony in that pile of crap? Uh, I think you should get start to get healthcare exposure if you don&#39;t have any. We like Baxter. Um, there are some drug stocks we&#39;re looking at. But, uh, you should have a basket of biotech now that&#39;s already started to take off or started to recover. Um, all right. And then he&#39;s talking about Tidewater. I don&#39;t like Tidewater is not for me. I&#39;m going to just pass on that. Um, dear Tom, hope you&#39;re doing well. Gratitude, admiration. Okay, so that one&#39;s that. Got that one already. Hi Tom. Uh, this is from Marlo Kadis. Been an avid listener for a year now. Love the content. As a British investor, my main concern is dollar exposure. In your opinion, it&#39;s worth holding US stocks or better to highly concentrate in XUS given the dollar weakness. I think most of the dollar weakness you&#39;re going to see in the short term is already done. Um, so I would be buying stocks. You&#39;re converting pounds into dollars to buy stocks. Um, I think now is a decent time as any. I mean, you can&#39;t get too cute with the currency hedging. I I would, you know, when I was pounding the table to buy international was a time to buy international. Dollar&#39;s now weakened a lot. It&#39;s probably going to have a short-term counter trend bounce. But I think if you own good companies over time, you could hedge out the currency if you&#39;re going to get crazy about that. I personally wouldn&#39;t do it. Just own good companies and and stop worrying about the currency stuff. Um Johnny S, uh notice you mentioned NOV. What are your thoughts on how? Uh I was in between both of them. Nov is better. A lot better. Borman, uh glad to hear your golf game&#39;s going well. Would you mind taking a look at HBI? Yeah, I&#39;ve looked at it over and over. It&#39;s it&#39;s a fine trading vehicle. It&#39;s not a great business, but uh it&#39;s probably okay. Here, we&#39;ll just take a look at it again for the millionth time that I&#39;m going to say probably works as a trade, but I&#39;m not interested in owning it long term. Revenues continue to decline. Cash flow is declining. Price is declining. Margins are going up a little bit. What&#39;s the balance sheet look like? Yeah, it&#39;s got a lot of debt for that small of a business. Two billion to 200 million in cash. That&#39;s your problem right there. Um, probably does okay, but I I I wouldn&#39;t take that risk. It&#39;s not a it&#39;s not a super high quality business. Um, hey Tom, what&#39;s your take on the August 1 Trump deadlines? Market shrugging it off. Feels like it&#39;s ignoring them for now. Might delay them further. No, he&#39;s going to enforce them. They&#39;re going into effect if if the t if the countries don&#39;t go to the table and the country should know that. That&#39;s the way Trump goes. He gives you a thing to uh to act, but you got to come to the table and deal. And a lot of this is about the non-tariff barriers, opening their countries to our businesses more than it is whether we get 10% or 15% or 12% or 18% or 30%. It&#39;s to bring them to the table. But when they don&#39;t come to the table or they come to the table in a ridiculous dilotant way, the 30% kicks in for 24, 48, 72 uh hours, 7 days, 14 days, as long as the pain as long as as much pain as they need to come to the table like big boys and girls and hammer out a deal. And um so I&#39;m excited about them. I&#39;m not uh fearing them at all. I hope they go into effect and then we&#39;ll wind up with a better deal for America. It may take two days of volatility, but it&#39;ll be what it&#39;ll be. Thoughts on Rivian? I wouldn&#39;t buy it with your money. With the uh socialist subsidization of the EV um sector over, there&#39;s one last man standing. There will always be a niche for that business, which will be Tesla. The big three are not going to invest in that. They&#39;re going to focus on hybrids. So, if you want an EV, you&#39;re going to buy a Tesla. Uh, Rivian was a, you know, fancy car for the Hamptons that, you know, people didn&#39;t want to be seen in Teslas. They haven&#39;t changed their body style in four years. They don&#39;t have the money to change it. It was cool when it was. It&#39;s toast. It&#39;s roadkill. On to the next. Um, if you didn&#39;t already have your VF position, would you be interested in Deckers? No, they don&#39;t have enough diversity. VF Corp has a ballast of its portfolio. Um, unknown. Thoughts on a zeroc coupon 30-year treasury to take advantage of easing policies? Not interested. Much better ways to make money. If rates were at 10%, if the if if the Fed funds rate was at 15% like 1982, basically buy 30 30 years at a 60% discount, invest the rest in equities, then you have basically zero downside and you lever it up. That that&#39;s like the trade of a century. Buffett and my first boss were doing it hand over fist. The difference between Buffett and my boss was that Buffett was doing it with no margin and my boss was doing it with margin and sweating bullets at night, but both of them made a ton of money uh and live to tell the story. Thanks for your perspectives. Was wondering what you think of the chemical industry as a cyclical pay. We&#39;ve covered it almost every week. I like it. Uh, as far as the names that you&#39;re talking about, DAO, Dupant, Cortiva, Westlake, PPG, um, Selines, Scots, Miracle Grow. I like to play them in different ways than those, but uh, you&#39;re on the right track. Udit anorang. I lr I l r icon. H. [Music] revenues holding in. Margins have been down for six years. Return on capital has been down. They must have done a dumb acquisition. Uh balance sheet [Music] $3.5 billion of debt, $500 million cash, a little bit levered. This is probably where it went wrong. You can see the jump in revenue. So, they did an acquisition that didn&#39;t work. Usually the sign of an aging CEO that wants to keep his job. He bets the whole ranch so he gets three three more years at the helm. Stock price stock share count went up to do a stupid deal. Um see what business they&#39;re in. outsource development and clinical research. Oh, I see. I see compound selection. Yeah. Uh I think this one warrants doing some work on. I don&#39;t think uh I&#39;m gonna wind up being interested in it, but I think it definitely checks the boxes to do more work on Ger. So, good work, Gerilyn Muinx. Copart, give me your thought that auto industry could boom over the coming years. What do you think of Copart? I think you&#39;re late. I think you&#39;re about 20 years late on Copart. This has been a massive compounder. Hasn&#39;t come in enough. But no, nothing wrong with the business. But um you&#39;re not going to make a lot of money when you&#39;re buying something that&#39;s already perfect. You know, it&#39;s like I say they don&#39;t give away multiaggers for free. I mean, this would probably be a multibagger over 10 years. you make make 3x, but it&#39;s just a steady compounder. This is like, oh, I was thinking about putting my money in treasuries. Instead, I&#39;m going to buy Copart, so I wind up with, you know, two or 3x over 10 years. I think that&#39;s probably a good way to think about it. Um, I mean, there aren&#39;t many businesses that are better. That&#39;s all I can say. That said, it&#39;s like uh you&#39;re a little late to the party. Even though it&#39;ll keep going up, it&#39;s just higher and better uses. Jimmy Jones, thoughts on the new backer CEO? It&#39;s fine. Could only be better than the last one. Um, uh, actually, no, we went over that one. Uh, the new Baxter CEO, his last deal was a 5x turnaround. Uh, new Baxter CEO. We&#39;ll probably spend a lot of Andrew Hinder. He came from ATP or something. ATS. Okay. So, let&#39;s take a look at ATS. He got involved in 2017. We covered this last week. And the stock went from $6 to $48. I like this guy as a turnaround specialist. I&#39;m actually very excited about him. And I actually bought more stock across the board where we could. um following this announcement. So, don&#39;t don&#39;t ask what I say, watch what I do. Yeah. So, this guy&#39;s asking me for the stocks that I&#39;m going to own for 10 years. I I I play I don&#39;t know how long I&#39;m going to own them. I know where I&#39;m going to get out of them. Okay. I do turn around. I do recovery business. You want to own a stock for five to seven or 10 years. Buy Copart and double or triple your money slowly over time. But as far as um or just buy the S&amp;P. So he&#39;s saying because he goes to school and he gets loans, they&#39;re not allowed to make money. So he just wants the stock to hold for the long term. Just buy the S&amp;P. I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s easy. Uh Marco Stalari All right. Don&#39;t put three names in one. It&#39;s unfair to everyone else. Just one ticker per question. FDEF [Music] Frontier Development. Oh, this must be a foreign stock. FDV. Yeah, it&#39;s a British stock. [Music] Yeah, looks like it&#39;s starting to recover. What do they do? I don&#39;t see the the revenue is recovering though. still negative cash flow. I mean, this is a tiny company, speculative company. You really have to know what they do. So if you like know that what did they do again? They develop games I think publishes video games. So if you know one game&#39;s going to be unbelievable and you have some edge that&#39;s fine, but other than that I have zero interest in this stock. It&#39;ll probably work. But number one is you&#39;re coming to me when it&#39;s already up 4x 3x. I think it probably continues to go. But you got to you got to know that business. That&#39;s not what we do here. Uh, elf, it looks like you you&#39;re just picking a bunch that you kind of missed the first leg of the recovery rally. Um, Elf, I&#39;ve never liked UBI. Ubisoft Um. All right. So, this one is potentially the one that so far makes the most sense out of everything you&#39;ve given me. Just on a fundamental basis, what do these guys do? Publish video games. So, you&#39;re into video games. You You have to have some type of edge. Um, if you understand what their publishing docket is and you have some edge, like you&#39;ve played video games your whole life and you know it&#39;s going to be a huge hit and you&#39;re on all the Twitch and everything else or wherever people talk about that. If you have some edge, like I think your margin of safety is good, but if it&#39;s just a meto video game and they don&#39;t have any hits in the pipe, it&#39;s just going to languish. It&#39;s like a drug company. They got to come up with a new big hit for it to work. Uh, but I think your margin of safety seems best in Ubisoft relative to the other few that you sent. So, good work on that Marco. Dev Patel Nphase every week. Every week phase. Yeah. Like if you&#39;re going to buy solar, I think this is worth starting to look at. I&#39;m not I&#39;m just not interested. Too much risk for too little reward. I if if you put a gun to my head and said buy solar tomorrow, that would probably be the name I&#39;d buy, but I don&#39;t have to. So therefore, I won&#39;t. That goes in too hard box. Um, Matthew Blecker, hi Tom, great podcast. Also huge fans in the Newport Beach area. Any interest in staples like Clorox? Yeah, I think Clorox is fine uh for the long term. I think they also have a CEO problem, but again, it&#39;s a business that a ham sandwich could run and one probably is running at the moment, but um I think you want to own this for the long term. and we&#39;ve covered that a few times. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t need to spend a lot of time on it. So, yeah, I like it here for the long term. That&#39;s another one that for the kid who needs to own stuff for five to 10 years, that one&#39;s probably fine. Um, okay. Podcast invite. Graham drawer. Okay, we got that one. Suzy Eli Lily. Not for me. See if it came down enough yet. No. Hard pass for me. Next, Tim Felmingham. Been following you for about three years now. First year I just watched and last two years I&#39;ve been actively investing, following your principles. Obviously, that&#39;s worked out very well. Thank you very much for everything you do for your listeners. I hope to become a client one day, but in the meantime, doing very well just by following your teaching. Thank you. Question. As a UK investor, my returns will are very good or significantly eroded by the weakening dollar. Is there any UK stocks that currently fit your framework? Well, you now know the framework. Go find them is the answer to your question. Um, reduce your currency risk. Um our way of playing that is GXO which is you know benefits from a weakening euro because they collect a lot of euros and then it gets converted into US dollar earnings. So um that&#39;s all I got there. Um, again, I think you&#39;re asking after the fact. The biggest move in the shortest period of time already happened. I think it&#39;s going to trend lower over time, but um, that&#39;s all I would say about that. All right, another podcast invite. All right, this from Lee Foster. I find the hardest thing in investing is not picking the undervalued stocks, but knowing when to trim or get out completely. I may be wrong, but I get the impression that even if an equity has room to run beyond your initial targets, you will still take some profits off the table. a self-imposed takeprofit, if you will. I know your exact method is a secret, as it should be, but is it ever correct to ignore fundamentals and sell just to guarantee a winner? I never sell to guarantee a winner. I sell at the price that I determined I would get out when I got in. The only thing that would change that is if the fundamentals got dramatically better than trend, but dramatically better than I anticipated they could ever get. um and therefore warranted uh a a a rerating from our internal models. But I have no expectation that I&#39;m at the top. I have an expectation that I&#39;m selling where I said I would sell and the IRRa was sufficient when I got in at a particular price and decided I&#39;d get out at a particular price. So I don&#39;t care if it runs another 200% beyond where I got out. I&#39;m I&#39;m selling it well above my designation of intrinsic value just as I bought it dramatically below my interpretation of intrinsic value according to my models and according to the math. So um some I&#39;ll leave a kicker on just to run to infinity because in the mark in the short term the market&#39;s a voting machine based on emotion and I&#39;ll just ride some of that emotion after I&#39;ve taken the bulk off. But for the most part, if it hits my target that I decided before I even got into stock, I&#39;m mostly 90. I&#39;m out. I&#39;m basically out. I&#39;ll usually keep a trailer on. It&#39;ll run another 20% and then I&#39;m out. And it and then I never look at it again until it&#39;s dramatically undervalued and no one likes it, which is many years in the future. Um, Alios, no, same thing. Okay, this is from Rico Bell. Hi, Tom. I&#39;ve been listening about two years. I own a small construction company and turn my guys on to you. Oh, thank you. We look forward to your podcast every week and even listen on the job site while installing roofing shingles hopefully from QXO. LOL. I was wondering what your thoughts are on TPL. Thanks for everything. We appreciate you more than you know. Well, thank you and Rico, get ready, my man, because you and your crew are going to be busier than one armed paper hangers uh in the next few years. So, super excited and thank you for sharing with people you care about. Okay, TPL, this is a special situation. Um, I think there are higher and better uses of capital. This is an asset play. It This is This is I don&#39;t like this type of play. These tend to be traps. you&#39;re gonna have no real edge on this and you&#39;re not buying it when no one wants it. So, I would I would pass on this one, my friend. Only and I&#39;m doing this quickly just because I&#39;ve already done work on it. Um, but I like the way you&#39;re thinking and your crew and uh let why don&#39;t you throw some housing stocks my way when you see something uh company that you guys are using a lot of their stuff whether it&#39;s Trex whether it&#39;s uh some of these suppliers uh throw a couple of those out when you think they&#39;re undervalued and we&#39;ll we&#39;ll get them on the show and uh give a shout out to you guys again. But thanks for tuning in uh loyally and sharing it and and benefiting from it. I appreciate that. Uh, Marlon Estrada, LTM, Latam Airlines, LTM. O, this looks like a lot of delutions happened over the years. This looks like a cigar, but one last puff. Maybe you get a trade out of it. It&#39;s not a business you would want to buy and hold. Seems like they just continue to mismanage it for some strange reason and dilute the hell out of their shareholders. Why do they keep doing that? Must be government involvement. What is going on here? Just makes little sense what the hell they&#39;re doing. Well, there&#39;s your answer. Wow. They 10xed the share count postcoid 10x and 2x the revenue. So, this is a group that obviously has zero respect for shareholders. They were probably on their last legs. I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know. I that type of activity. I mean, maybe it was just a desperation move, but uh let me see. Two billion of cash, 2.8 billion of debt, huh? I mean, that&#39;s a lot of shares that they&#39;re gonna have to buy back before this thing starts to work. Um I mean the problem is that even before COVID the stock did nothing for 20 years. So it was mismanaged before you had the once in a 100redy year event. Um I don&#39;t know. It does look like it&#39;s recovering. I think it&#39;s worth doing a little more work on but the red flags are definitely there. So, oh, emerged from chapter 11 on January 23rd. Yeah. All right. Yeah. I This one requires a lot of work. This is not an easy peasy thing because there&#39;s there&#39;s just a hell of a lot of shares now. Hey Tom, I&#39;m 20 years old from Dublin, Ireland. Been listening to the podcast for nearly six months now. One of the best, most entertaining tools. Thank you very much. Given how competitive the hedge fund space is, what&#39;s the one thing you wish you&#39;d focused on earlier? Um, I think the number one thing you can do when you&#39;re in your 20s and know nothing is get your CFA and then um I mean, you know, first thing you read the intelligent investor. If that thing isn&#39;t a light bulb for you, go build a business. You&#39;ll make a lot more money as an entrepreneur at a young age. If you&#39;re going to be an investor, it&#39;s going to take you literally 15 to 20 years before you even know where the coffee machine is and you can become good and maybe great. Great is going to be the intangible that can&#39;t be taught. Um, good is going to be 80 to 100 hour weeks for 10 to 15 years. Um, so I think before you even think about whether youorked enough or this or that, get your CFA if you&#39;re really serious about it. Otherwise, start a business and just get rich that way. I mean, that you&#39;ll be able to do it quicker. So, you better really love markets if you&#39;re going to put in the 15. I think over the long term, you know, you can make a lot more money as a great investor, but in the short term as an entrepreneur, you know, you can get a couple hits, 20, 30, 40 million bucks, and you know, you only eat one cheeseburger a day, so it&#39;s probably not a bad way to go. Um, that&#39;s it. So, thank you all for being amazing supporters and being with me for now going on 5 years, 300 episodes. Um, very very grateful for all the support.
