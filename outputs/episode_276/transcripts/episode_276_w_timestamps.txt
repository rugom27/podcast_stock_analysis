[0.64s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.48s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[6.359s] 276th video cast podcast for the week
[9.0s] ending January 30th
[11.679s] 2025 as always we&#39;re going to start with
[13.88s] family first then we&#39;ll get right down
[15.4s] to business got a lot of incredible data
[17.359s] to cover today although when
[19.56s] everything&#39;s going right there&#39;s really
[21.08s] not a lot to say uh as you know we like
[23.76s] to spend time on the the names that are
[26.24s] just leaving the station versus uh doing
[28.76s] Victory laps for the ones that are
[30.16s] soaring and uh candidly they&#39;re a lot
[32.92s] more soaring today uh than just starting
[35.399s] out of the gate which is pretty exciting
[37.079s] to see and um and nicely coming for
[40.079s] those of you who&#39;ve been listening for a
[41.399s] while uh and reaped some significant
[44.039s] benefits and uh certainly clients uh
[47.16s] very very happy these days so excited
[49.48s] for that uh this is Annabelle you want
[52.079s] to speak of real accomplishment uh
[54.559s] Annabelle was in Las Vegas this weekend
[56.6s] for the Southern California swimming
[58.68s] Allstar Festival she got first place in
[61.359s] all six of her individual events and set
[63.879s] five meet records in the 200 free 50
[67.119s] free 100 back 50 fly and 200 medal relay
[72.08s] uh afterwards uh Caitlyn and Annabelle
[75.119s] hit the town and took in the sights so
[79.479s] that was Annabelle with the Las Vegas
[82.84s] sign I stayed back to take Mimi to the
[86.36s] daddy daughter dance at our club and
[89.759s] that was just special trying to squeeze
[92.759s] the last few uh bits of
[95.799s] uh them being uh young daughters you
[99.64s] know 12 were pushing up against the
[101.799s] limits here for daddy daughter dances so
[103.88s] I was excited to do that and get her to
[106.24s] her activities here in Orange County uh
[109.6s] this was this photo here and then uh
[113.479s] there&#39;s some more of Annabelle I guess
[115.24s] that&#39;s the Luxor wow uh this was amazing
[119.24s] want to thank Brad s for hosting me at
[123.479s] Mission Vio Country Club this week uh we
[127.88s] it was called a monster pin
[131.28s] scramble and we tied for fifth sixth and
[135.44s] seventh all had net 74 we were ham and
[139.16s] egging it all day long dropping some
[141.56s] putts the the this is historically a
[144.92s] course that is impossible to putt and
[147.4s] then they put the pins in the most
[149.44s] difficult possible places
[151.84s] ever uh but we pulled through so uh so
[155.239s] Kudos really hats off had an incredible
[158.28s] time with Brad and um and the fact that
[162.0s] we could compete and come in basically
[164.36s] tied for fifth and then there were other
[166.68s] uh fifth sixth and seventh was all the
[168.239s] same
[169.0s] score um that&#39;s more of Caitlyn with uh
[173.239s] Annabelle in that&#39;s Paris in the
[175.92s] background pretty cool stuff there&#39;s
[177.959s] Annabelle doing some El this
[181.36s] impersonations uh and this was
[183.4s] interesting she took a picture randomly
[186.36s] in front of the Chinese year of the
[189.599s] snake so maybe um certainly I would say
[194.12s] that podcast we did with Brendan Ahern
[197.799s] uh of kweb last fall after I played golf
[200.319s] at his awesome course in Connecticut
[203.68s] um uh probably marked the bottom of uh
[207.56s] Baba and uh you know now everyone&#39;s
[210.08s] getting excited about it but the year of
[211.799s] the snake and there she is randomly uh
[214.239s] there are no accidents that&#39;s pretty
[215.84s] cool and then a friend and client sent
[217.959s] over this hat he made up called uh uh
[222.08s] htrt turnaround Tom uh gosh did he
[226.36s] already trademark that well now you know
[228.76s] my clients all these CTI millionaires a
[231.2s] couple billionaires and uh
[233.4s] decamillionaires many times over they&#39;re
[235.72s] uh they&#39;re ahead of the game on all of
[237.48s] it but it says burden yourself with the
[239.439s] fact # trt pretty cool stuff um okay by
[245.48s] the way just uh as a last point I think
[249.2s] last week I
[250.519s] shared uh how embarrassing my golfing
[253.56s] had been uh since moving out here after
[256.079s] being on break well it&#39;s grooving now
[258.88s] and um shot my best score ever in
[263.12s] history uh Saturday which was an 80 even
[267.28s] so I still have not breaking broken 80
[271.72s] but I really thought that was so far off
[273.56s] the way I came out here and started
[274.919s] playing it was it was disaster and um
[278.759s] and I actually am starting to gain
[281.919s] confidence that it&#39;s durable and I and I
[283.919s] can hear all the golfers laughing in the
[285.52s] background but um I got this device and
[288.88s] you know again wait for the chuckles
[291.039s] called the hack motion and I have no
[292.639s] affiliation with the company and it just
[294.6s] basically measures your flexion and
[296.479s] extension at the top of the swing and an
[298.24s] impact wrist angles and you basically
[300.88s] for those of you who don&#39;t know golf you
[302.12s] want to be more boded at Impact versus
[304.4s] extended boded like this and it just
[306.96s] does that and I&#39;ve been grooving that
[308.6s] and it&#39;s it&#39;s been a complete Game
[310.8s] Changer obviously I can putt now with my
[312.919s] long putter that everyone laughs at uh
[315.36s] putt pretty well and uh uh so now I
[319.319s] think better out of the sand I think I
[321.68s] got to work on some chipping but
[323.479s] complete Game Changer
[325.319s] so uh I thought it would be
[328.16s] fluky it&#39;s not not feeling fluky at all
[331.12s] uh because I continue to just grind in
[332.759s] the data and I just look at flexion and
[334.4s] intension when I&#39;m in flexion I just
[336.919s] pure the ball and um so I&#39;m going to
[339.28s] work on that and pretty excited cuz for
[341.84s] those you&#39;ve been following you know my
[343.319s] goal for 2024 was to get to a single
[346.199s] digit handicap I failed but I didn&#39;t
[349.4s] quit I almost quit the game seriously
[351.199s] when I came out here after moving and
[352.8s] not playing for four months I was
[354.28s] embarrassingly bad it was like a you
[357.479s] know a friend was out and I said to him
[359.8s] I was like I was better two years ago
[361.44s] when I was just starting and he&#39;s like
[364.12s] yeah you were and uh and literally that
[367.319s] day it&#39;s you
[368.56s] know hack motion thing comes up on my
[371.12s] Instagram I fall for it like a sucker
[373.12s] and it actually works so there you go
[375.08s] all right on to
[376.479s] business uh here is want to thank uh
[380.96s] Camille Smith Claire failen and Mary
[384.56s] calie for having me on CBS to discuss
[387.28s] the fed this week we&#39;re going to listen
[389.319s] in here service meeting for the first
[391.199s] time in 2025 economists and consumers
[393.479s] alike are waiting to see if and when
[395.319s] there will be more rate Cuts joining us
[397.4s] now is Thomas Hayes chairman and
[398.96s] managing member at Great Hill Capital
[401.28s] welcome thanks for having me Mary and
[403.599s] president Trump has called for interest
[405.16s] rates to drop immediately do you predict
[407.44s] any shakeups or surprises or will it be
[409.84s] business as usual I think the secret to
[413.0s] happiness is low expectations and we can
[415.16s] expect business as usual right now
[417.16s] there&#39;s a 2.7% chance
[420.16s] or expectations that there will be a cut
[422.0s] for this meeting so very low
[423.479s] expectations here I don&#39;t think that
[425.479s] will change even if Trump wants uh Cuts
[428.24s] immediately because number one they have
[430.12s] to get more information tariffs and
[432.44s] deportation could be short-term
[434.28s] inflationary for prices the Doge
[436.639s] Department of governmental efficiency
[438.56s] could offset some of that but they can&#39;t
[440.599s] make any decisions until they know what
[442.24s] the landscape is going to look like how
[444.0s] do you predict the central bank&#39;s
[445.36s] relationship with the new Administration
[447.08s] will
[448.36s] be uh probably less Pleasant than uh
[452.08s] we&#39;ve seen in recent history uh Trump
[454.319s] wants rates lower he&#39;s going to continue
[456.0s] to pound on that table and J Powell is
[458.879s] going to continue to ride out his term
[460.84s] to early next year and do exactly what
[463.479s] he believes the data is telling him to
[465.319s] do so expect a lot of push and pull
[467.96s] there uh president Trump does believe he
[469.879s] should have a say in rates uh the FED is
[473.52s] an independent body so I think that will
[475.56s] be the push pull moving forward and
[477.24s] there&#39;s limitations on what can be done
[479.8s] to really Force the fed&#39;s hand many are
[482.599s] saying inflation concerns have eased but
[484.96s] plenty of Americans still feeling the
[486.479s] impact do you think the US will hit the
[488.68s] 2% inflation Target this year or is it
[490.96s] still Out Of
[492.199s] Reach I think that is unlikely uh we do
[495.759s] have debt to GDP a near record highs
[498.96s] 120% going back all the way to post
[502.28s] World War II and honestly the only way
[504.28s] to solve for that is you have to run
[505.879s] growth uh above Trend which means
[508.68s] inflation is probably going to be in the
[510.919s] 2 and 1/2 to 3 and a half% range for the
[513.279s] foreseeable future that&#39;s going to help
[515.24s] us bring down the debt to GDP ratio
[517.76s] through growth and uh and the good news
[520.719s] is wages are slowly catching up so it
[523.56s] should be a push pull fast growth wages
[526.32s] starting to catch up but inflation a
[527.76s] little bit above Trend the FED lowered
[529.88s] rates three times in 2024 what is your
[532.2s] prediction for
[534.12s] 2025 I think I&#39;m going to side with the
[536.16s] FED here their summary of economic
[537.839s] projections their Dot Plot indicates
[539.88s] they want to get two cuts in in 2025 I
[543.24s] think that&#39;s realistic expectations if
[545.68s] you look at fed fund Futures where this
[547.519s] stuff is gamed out you have a 30% cut
[550.079s] chance of a cut in May in in May uh by
[553.6s] June you go to 74% and by December
[556.839s] you&#39;ve got a 90% chance of a cut and a
[559.36s] 62% chance of two cuts by December I
[562.32s] think it&#39;s going to be back half loaded
[563.839s] I think we get two more Cuts Mary Thomas
[565.8s] Hayes chairman and managing member of
[567.64s] great Hill Capital thanks so much for
[569.12s] joining us thanks for having
[571.959s] me and we&#39;re back uh then quotes of the
[575.64s] week you know this is an interesting
[577.12s] quote and the reason I bring it up from
[578.519s] John Templeton obviously is a legend
[580.92s] markets are born on pessimism grow on
[583.92s] skepticism mature on optimism and die on
[588.12s] Euphoria the time of Maximum pessimism
[591.0s] is the best time to buy and the time of
[594.44s] Maximum optimism is the best time to
[597.519s] sell and people often equate this and
[600.2s] they always want to do things all or
[602.64s] nothing and it always has to be a macro
[604.72s] call but I can tell you across the board
[608.2s] how many things right now feel like they
[612.64s] match this meaning they are in maximum
[615.72s] op optimism and the best time to sell
[618.12s] and you saw some of that that we&#39;ve been
[619.6s] warning you about for some time um
[623.839s] and on the flip side there&#39;s a whole
[627.56s] another 75% of the world and different
[630.88s] sectors and companies which we&#39;re in
[632.36s] that are starting to absolutely fly like
[635.079s] nobody&#39;s business and I told you it was
[636.839s] coming and by the way kudos to all the
[638.76s] people that came in in q1 I mean these
[640.839s] guys are smiling so wide they could eat
[642.2s] a banana sideways as well as my existing
[643.92s] clients are super duper unbel you know
[646.76s] we&#39;re off to an great start and um for
[651.44s] 2025 um also want to uh um it&#39;s pretty
[657.0s] cool living out here because
[659.72s] had a chance to meet one of those new
[661.519s] new folks that came in want to uh to
[665.6s] thank thank Brad k for meeting up in
[669.04s] person and uh Tom B I&#39;m GNA go go meet
[672.44s] you uh the interesting thing is you know
[675.16s] we all live you know I live a a few
[677.639s] blocks from the water I can see it I can
[679.32s] walk from it these guys live right on
[681.24s] the water they could stick their toes in
[683.48s] the sand when they wake up which is
[685.04s] pretty awesome uh so I&#39;m going to go
[686.76s] down and see you and everyone else
[688.2s] around the country grateful very
[690.2s] exciting and this is what we&#39;ve been
[691.959s] waiting for and this is what we&#39;ve laid
[693.68s] the foundation for and it&#39;s not about
[696.12s] predicting anything it&#39;s about using a
[698.04s] durable sustainable uh framework that is
[702.76s] repeatable over time and it&#39;s the kind
[705.6s] of framework you know outperformance
[707.6s] comes in clumps it doesn&#39;t come linearly
[711.12s] uh it when it comes it comes all at once
[713.48s] and here we are and kudos to those of
[716.24s] you who took advantage of that message
[719.279s] this quarter and um and I think we&#39;re
[722.68s] just at the beginning of very very
[724.36s] exciting and good things ahead so um the
[728.8s] key to investing is not assessing how
[730.839s] much an industry is going to affect
[733.079s] society or how much it will grow but
[735.24s] rather determining the competitive
[736.88s] advantage of Any Given company and above
[739.36s] all the durability of that Advantage
[741.68s] this is the key thing this is Warren
[743.199s] Buffett and what he&#39;s basically saying
[744.76s] here
[746.399s] is in English you&#39;re not going to make
[749.399s] predicting the future and everyone
[751.32s] that&#39;s what they do they spend their
[752.88s] time trying to predict the future who&#39;s
[754.8s] going to be the leader in AI chips who&#39;s
[756.639s] going to be this and that and Buffett
[758.8s] May became the wealthiest investor in
[760.519s] history through buying durable companies
[763.8s] that that work through Cycles when they
[765.88s] were temporarily impaired regular
[768.199s] everyday items you you don&#39;t need the
[771.399s] hundred Baggers o you know over time
[773.72s] because when you&#39;re reaching for the
[775.16s] hundred Baggers you fall prey to
[778.12s] Buffett&#39;s number one rule rule number
[780.16s] one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two
[783.12s] is don&#39;t forget rule number one so yeah
[785.279s] they write books about the lucky
[786.639s] gamblers who get it right and make a
[788.48s] thousand bagger on one lucky pick but
[790.56s] I&#39;m telling you I&#39;ve been around long
[791.88s] enough all of those people give it back
[793.68s] to the casino sooner or later and um you
[797.399s] know even many of the people who got the
[799.839s] subprime crisis uh correct and
[802.519s] everything else you know the follow-up
[804.6s] acts are few and far between there are
[807.16s] some but um
[810.04s] you you want a maintainable durable it&#39;s
[814.279s] a l it looks a little slower out of the
[816.0s] gate but over the long term the the
[817.76s] effects of compounding I mean one
[820.76s] example that I&#39;ve shared with you guys
[823.36s] many times but there are a lot of new
[825.079s] viewers so I want to go into it is
[827.199s] Charlie Munger bought this company
[829.16s] called byd in
[832.56s] 2009 and uh maybe I&#39;ll even pull it
[836.48s] up by the way 10year yield is going down
[839.639s] but uh b y d d y so
[844.8s] basically he had the fundamentals right
[847.48s] he bought in 2009 it shot up then it
[851.48s] collapsed 90% they held on to it he
[854.16s] could you know Buffett wasn&#39;t crazy
[855.92s] about it but Monger was you know all
[858.48s] Full Tilt on it and it did basically
[860.839s] nothing from 2009 to
[863.399s] 20120 so they were effectively flat they
[866.32s] had a 90% draw down they had a SE call
[870.839s] it 70% draw down a 60% draw down over
[874.36s] that 10 years and it looks easy on this
[876.839s] chart if you were living through that
[878.16s] you&#39;d be like Oh I&#39;m wrong if you&#39;re
[879.92s] early you&#39;re wrong blah blah blah and
[882.72s] what wound up happening was when it
[885.24s] comes it comes all at once when your
[886.839s] analysis is correct it did a 10 bagger
[889.839s] the next 12 months so basically in 13
[892.959s] years they had call it a 20 bagger and
[896.0s] if you do the irr on that it works and
[898.399s] and that&#39;s this is an extreme example
[902.12s] you know but another one I&#39;ve shared
[903.399s] with you guys was we bought uh range
[906.6s] resources in
[908.8s] 2018 uh at 11 down from 90 we estimated
[913.16s] the fair value of proved and unproved
[915.6s] was about $60 a share um they only
[918.92s] report 10e pv10 which is like 20 and uh
[922.8s] so we bought at 11 it immediately went
[924.8s] to 18 we thought we were geniuses then
[927.0s] Co came shot down to a buck 60 we loaded
[930.8s] the boat the back of the truck like
[932.759s] nobody&#39;s business brought our basis down
[935.12s] to
[936.16s] $410 and today it&#39;s 40 40 plus and
[939.16s] probably going to 60 so um you know in
[942.639s] the short term looked like a failure but
[944.56s] when you know what you own and you&#39;ve
[946.319s] done proper
[947.56s] analysis
[951.72s] um good things happen you know and
[956.399s] um so this will probably wind up being a
[961.0s] 15 bagger in 7 years so you know do the
[965.279s] irrs on that uh but most people wouldn&#39;t
[967.68s] have sat through it because they trade
[969.319s] price they don&#39;t trade value they don&#39;t
[970.639s] know how to analyze a business they
[972.079s] don&#39;t have the experience and that&#39;s
[973.68s] what we try to impart on these weekly
[978.0s] podcasts so uh final quote is from
[980.839s] Charlie Munger the world is full of
[982.959s] foolish gamblers they will not do as
[985.079s] well as the patient investors and we&#39;re
[987.279s] going to find that over and over and
[989.12s] over all the folks who are chasing the
[991.279s] shiny objects got a little taste of what
[993.759s] it is to be shellac this week uh they
[997.0s] will continue to get reminders about
[999.319s] that
[1000.88s] and
[1003.319s] um if
[1004.75s] [Music]
[1008.24s] you learn and follow a sensible
[1012.399s] framework uh and take the time and be
[1015.319s] patient uh and go through the process
[1017.519s] and get experience you will not fall for
[1019.92s] those traps uh that so many people and
[1022.44s] so many super intelligent people I mean
[1024.4s] these are not it&#39;s you know people
[1026.88s] always say oh the retail investor I&#39;m
[1028.439s] telling
[1029.4s] you billionaires who have built
[1031.679s] unbelievable businesses fall for the
[1033.6s] same traps that retail investors fall
[1035.679s] fall for it&#39;s just human nature to get
[1037.839s] sucked in the fomo I I always joke I
[1039.959s] didn&#39;t get the fomo gene it&#39;s it&#39;s you
[1042.48s] know it&#39;s true and I encourage you to
[1046.28s] [Music]
[1047.6s] um just
[1049.36s] when when when you&#39;re buying a business
[1051.76s] because the price is going up and
[1053.32s] because it&#39;s in the news all the time
[1055.96s] what I want you to do is pull out the
[1058.64s] income statement the balance sheet the
[1061.36s] cash flow statement and analyze what you
[1065.039s] are getting in terms of free cash flow
[1067.96s] and if you had access to unlimited
[1071.24s] Capital JP Morgan was going to finance
[1073.24s] you for the whole business the only
[1075.559s] catch is you have to put up 100% % of
[1079.48s] your net worth alongside so let&#39;s say
[1082.4s] you&#39;re going to buy a100 billion
[1084.52s] business and you&#39;re worth $30 million
[1087.44s] you
[1088.159s] know um JP Morgan would put up the rest
[1091.84s] but you have to put up the full 30
[1093.28s] million and if you&#39;re wrong and you&#39;re
[1095.36s] going to take the business private and
[1096.799s] you&#39;re going to live off the cash flow
[1098.039s] for the rest of your life if you&#39;re
[1099.64s] wrong you lose your full $30
[1102.679s] million um JP Morgan will be debt
[1105.799s] they&#39;ll they&#39;ll take take over the
[1107.159s] business you&#39;ll get wiped out on your
[1108.44s] equity they&#39;ll liquidate the assets Etc
[1111.36s] if you wouldn&#39;t be willing to put 100%
[1114.24s] of your net worth to take the business
[1116.12s] private coupled by JP Morgan debt why
[1119.28s] are you buying it just because the quote
[1121.0s] unquote stock price is going up um the
[1125.0s] idea of buying any instrument on the
[1128.12s] basis of it&#39;s going to go up because
[1131.2s] more people are going to buy it versus
[1133.72s] it&#39;s going to go up because its
[1135.2s] intrinsic value is going to go up is a
[1137.159s] trap that will hurt you royally over
[1140.039s] time
[1141.44s] so that&#39;s kind of the the Crux of what
[1144.36s] we do here every week and I think a lot
[1146.52s] of you have caught on to the uh
[1148.799s] philosophy and uh and are are smiling a
[1151.48s] lot lately so uh this is something that
[1154.159s] no one else was paying attention to kind
[1155.96s] of a diversion everyone was focused on
[1159.679s] uh deep seek uh disrupting the Ari
[1162.76s] Market this week and it&#39;s certainly true
[1165.28s] that that&#39;s part of it uh but what they
[1168.36s] weren&#39;t wen&#39;t focused on was the fact
[1171.24s] that bank of Japan raised rates uh to
[1175.0s] their highest level in many years so
[1177.039s] they
[1178.08s] increased uh rates by 25 basis points
[1182.2s] and what this is as I&#39;ve been warning
[1184.84s] that very few people have been talking
[1186.799s] about that uh that don&#39;t listen to this
[1189.32s] podcast or follow me
[1192.64s] um is
[1194.84s] that a bigger risk to the Magnificent
[1199.36s] seven
[1201.28s] trade than overspending on chips without
[1206.4s] a return on investment or
[1209.64s] overvaluation or any of that is actually
[1212.32s] the unwind of the carry trade where
[1214.4s] people have been getting free money and
[1215.84s] they&#39;ve been parking it in the mag 7 in
[1217.6s] the US and benefiting from the currency
[1219.44s] differential and benefiting from uh
[1223.88s] basically free money is is uh what what
[1226.52s] it&#39;s been so as that money becomes less
[1230.159s] free uh what you&#39;re seeing is an unwind
[1234.039s] of the most crowded trade in the world
[1236.08s] probably in history and I think we&#39;re
[1238.2s] going to see more and more of that and
[1239.96s] it will be in fits and starts like they
[1241.679s] tried in
[1243.919s] August uh and they got shellacked and
[1247.0s] the uh Bank of Japan Governor had to
[1250.32s] walk it back uh this time they blamed it
[1254.159s] on deep seek
[1256.32s] which is certainly part of the the
[1258.76s] formula if you remember I was on vanney
[1262.0s] and I said Icarus is flying too close to
[1264.44s] the Sun uh the good news is his wings
[1267.679s] aren&#39;t melting yet and I was referring
[1269.2s] to Jensen Wong and I emphatically said
[1271.96s] but competition is coming you just wait
[1275.159s] you don&#39;t need to be much older than
[1278.6s] 4045 uh to understand how the
[1281.159s] semiconductor Cycle Works and the
[1283.44s] problem is is you have so many people
[1284.84s] managing money that uh haven&#39;t been
[1288.159s] through these cycles and don&#39;t realize
[1291.279s] that just like the glp 1&#39;s which we
[1293.88s] warned about which now has unbelievable
[1296.4s] competition from all different uh sides
[1299.039s] and the stocks have come off the boil uh
[1301.799s] certainly doing everything that they
[1303.159s] promis it&#39;s getting people skinny uh
[1305.799s] healthy for the time being a lot of
[1308.08s] health benefits but now there are tons
[1309.919s] of entrance so the pie is getting cut up
[1312.6s] same thing&#39;s going to happen with the
[1314.08s] chips same thing&#39;s going to happen with
[1316.2s] AI and um
[1319.2s] and we&#39;re seeing that over and over so
[1321.52s] uh speaking of competition in AI we had
[1327.799s] Alibaba come out and publish their data
[1332.559s] that showed that they
[1334.6s] outperform deep
[1336.679s] seek and open
[1339.159s] AI uh pretty much across the board so
[1342.559s] right
[1343.799s] now the quen 2.5 Max is probably the
[1347.88s] best AI
[1349.88s] the world has to offer and we&#39;ve been
[1351.96s] ahead of the curve on that for many many
[1355.159s] months telling you that there is an AI
[1358.64s] ETF in China with ticker Baba
[1363.0s] bab and part of that premise was yes
[1365.72s] they were developing their own internal
[1367.279s] stuff they&#39;re number one in Cloud uh
[1369.52s] they&#39;re going to get all the bulk of the
[1371.72s] uh compute demand and all the other
[1373.679s] things that were part of our initial
[1375.679s] premise uh furthermore
[1378.96s] they&#39;ve been
[1379.919s] giving tokens for compute power to
[1383.0s] pretty much every AI startup in China in
[1385.24s] exchange for Equity so beyond their own
[1389.0s] development you win so many different
[1392.32s] ways and and that&#39;s what&#39;s been so
[1394.24s] amazing about Alibaba but they&#39;ve
[1396.84s] actually it&#39;s not just coming from the
[1399.279s] startups that they have Equity
[1400.6s] investments in that we have as owners of
[1403.12s] Alibaba but it&#39;s coming
[1406.679s] from their own internal development and
[1409.52s] now as it stands and this is early days
[1412.0s] there&#39;s going to be a lot of competition
[1413.679s] but Alibaba is a major player and by the
[1415.6s] data they are Best in Class better than
[1418.44s] open AI better than deep seek on all of
[1421.44s] these metrics and I think probably going
[1423.52s] to continue to be better uh here&#39;s a
[1425.919s] lady who put
[1427.559s] out uh a a post and she specializes in
[1432.4s] AI goodbye chat GPT Alibaba just dropped
[1435.76s] quen 2.5 Max and the world is already
[1439.08s] blown away by it it its potential 13
[1441.32s] wild examples so far don&#39;t miss the
[1443.24s] fifth one uh so she&#39;s comparing chat GPT
[1446.4s] to quen 2.5 and showing how it beats it
[1448.44s] in every single area artifacts like
[1450.96s] Claude it can code write text search the
[1454.159s] web comparison between quen video
[1456.64s] generation and Sora so you can see here
[1460.4s] uh the big difference it&#39;s day and night
[1463.44s] then quen 2.5 VL lets you create open AI
[1466.64s] operator like agent for computer and
[1469.0s] mobile phones uh three bouncing yellow
[1472.44s] balls within a
[1473.96s] sphere uh it can compete directly with
[1476.72s] open AI operator in computer
[1480.44s] use create videos quicker than other AI
[1483.679s] tools I mean look at the quality of
[1485.24s] these videos it&#39;s unbelievable upload
[1486.799s] files to analyze PDFs read images and
[1489.84s] extract insights instantly this is huge
[1493.559s] uh generate uncensored images uh this
[1496.679s] one if you&#39;re not watching it&#39;s a p
[1499.6s] picture of Donald Trump having coffee
[1502.24s] with Kamala uh which is definitely AI
[1505.48s] generated I have not seen that happen in
[1507.279s] real life I don&#39;t think we will be
[1509.32s] seeing that anytime soon uh quen 2.5
[1512.72s] performs competitively with top models
[1514.52s] surpassing deep seek V3 in benchmarks
[1517.039s] like Arena hard live bench Live code
[1519.96s] bench and GP QA Diamond you can see the
[1523.159s] data
[1524.48s] here uh is out with its latest code
[1527.6s] artifacts the open source series is
[1530.039s] under Apache 2.0 and uses gradio 5 and
[1533.919s] custom components so we&#39;ve talked about
[1536.44s] in past podcasts moving from training
[1539.12s] the large language models which is the
[1541.159s] capital intensive to uh inference phase
[1544.399s] which is lower cost uh deep seek made a
[1546.76s] claim that what it costs uh some of the
[1549.559s] hyperscalers or
[1551.96s] uh you know billions to do they were
[1555.2s] able to do for five you know 100 billion
[1556.88s] they were able to do for 5 million or
[1558.76s] five you know a fraction of the cost uh
[1561.36s] it&#39;s a gamechanging competition is
[1563.799s] coming I think Alibaba is going to be
[1565.76s] the core beneficiary in the East uh and
[1569.72s] we&#39;ll see who&#39;s going to be in the west
[1571.52s] but this is mind-boggling and if you see
[1574.039s] in the US the number one download is
[1576.039s] deep seek so the Americans if it works
[1578.64s] like we&#39;re just Americans by and large
[1580.88s] are I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good thing or
[1582.039s] a bad thing you know with Tik Tok has
[1583.96s] been fantastic I I think it&#39;s a a
[1585.76s] wonderful
[1586.919s] tool um
[1588.96s] I always say if they&#39;re stealing my data
[1590.96s] what are they going to do call my mom I
[1592.52s] mean you know at the end of the day uh
[1595.24s] the tools are are working and they&#39;re
[1596.919s] and they&#39;re great and this is large this
[1599.039s] is partially a function
[1602.72s] of unintended consequences of knee-jerk
[1606.279s] policy when we decided rather than keep
[1609.76s] them dependent uh and coming back to us
[1613.0s] for all of their Tech needs we were
[1615.64s] going to sanction them and not give them
[1618.039s] the raw materials which they were going
[1620.0s] to find anyway and and we forced them
[1622.52s] you know necessity is the mother of
[1624.0s] invention we forced them to compete with
[1627.08s] us when they didn&#39;t want to and now uh
[1630.72s] they&#39;re eating our lunch so far so
[1633.0s] that&#39;s where it is and we&#39;ll see what
[1635.08s] happens but as owners of Alibaba we
[1637.24s] couldn&#39;t be happier so we&#39;ll leave it at
[1639.52s] that uh moving along
[1643.0s] here we have some data this is from Ryan
[1645.559s] Dietrich S&amp;P was up uh first five days
[1648.52s] of
[1649.279s] 2025 that&#39;s a
[1651.36s] general maximum in the markets going
[1653.72s] back to
[1654.559s] 1950 when that happens the average
[1658.32s] return is 14.2 versus the average year
[1662.039s] is
[1663.039s] 9.5 if the first five days is lower your
[1665.6s] average return is
[1667.36s] 1.1 uh so that bodess pretty well so
[1670.0s] he&#39;s looking for Mid double digits on
[1671.679s] the basis of that uh I&#39;m less sanguin
[1674.0s] but I&#39;m open-minded our money is going
[1675.6s] to be made under the surface I mean the
[1677.44s] the relative outperformance of what
[1679.48s] we&#39;ve seen just in the last handful of
[1681.32s] days is uh unprecedented relative to
[1684.279s] what how we&#39;re doing relative to the
[1685.76s] market and everything else it&#39;s just
[1687.2s] unreal so um Bank of America indicates
[1691.64s] us household Equity net worth up to 1.6
[1694.679s] trillion here&#39;s the Bull and Bear
[1697.76s] indicator uh again not showing signs
[1701.679s] that you&#39;re at the level that you got to
[1703.48s] puke out everything and sell we&#39;re not
[1705.36s] at Euphoria yet so that&#39;s that lot of
[1708.44s] things to do Under the surface there
[1709.88s] there&#39;s a lot of things I wouldn&#39;t be
[1711.159s] buying by the way and you know what they
[1712.559s] are uh and if you by the way last week&#39;s
[1715.64s] was a lot longer this is going to be a
[1716.88s] lot
[1718.159s] shorter uh but that would be the one I
[1720.399s] would listen to if you just wanted to
[1721.679s] listen to one for the year and get the
[1723.559s] road map uh how we&#39;re thinking and
[1725.72s] that&#39;s already starting to play out that
[1727.679s] would be a very useful one to listen to
[1729.36s] you can find it on YouTube under hedge
[1731.24s] fund tips it&#39;s probably the January 23rd
[1733.679s] episode
[1735.6s] 275 Twin Peaks and treasury yield these
[1738.6s] are already coming down that&#39;s the
[1740.08s] 30-year yield we already showed you the
[1742.2s] 10-year yield it&#39;s backed off 30 basis
[1744.159s] points already um value beating growth
[1747.48s] so far in 2025 by a wide margin looks
[1750.039s] like about five or
[1751.88s] 6% um Twin Peaks in the US dollar looks
[1755.919s] like the dollar peaked out in early
[1757.44s] January all the things that we said were
[1760.679s] very similar and likely to recur from
[1763.2s] 2016 election to 2017 inauguration which
[1766.96s] is why we were so Ardent about if you&#39;re
[1769.64s] coming in come in now and many of you
[1772.039s] took us up on that and kudos to you
[1777.64s] um uh these things are playing so we
[1780.2s] said you know dollar would would uh it
[1783.32s] strengthened into after the
[1785.84s] election yields blew out after the
[1788.44s] election and then after the inauguration
[1790.76s] you start to see dollar back off yields
[1793.44s] back off we&#39;re seeing that and what&#39;s
[1795.0s] start starting to happen Emerging
[1796.32s] Markets are starting to outperform
[1798.12s] absolutely was on no one&#39;s bingo card
[1800.72s] except for the amazing loyal incredible
[1803.44s] listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom
[1806.279s] Hayes um four-year presidential cycle
[1809.32s] 1949 to 2000 Post elction year tends to
[1813.0s] be pretty good this is from Jeffrey hirs
[1815.039s] over at the stock Traders Almanac uh he
[1817.64s] puts out good stuff so this year is a
[1821.24s] generally a good year and we&#39;ve kind of
[1822.88s] outlined how we think about that midterm
[1825.44s] years tend to get a bit more choppy so
[1827.48s] we&#39;ll probably be harvesting a lot of
[1829.2s] profits early next year and uh creating
[1832.36s] powder for for huge opportunities going
[1834.559s] into the midterm election which we&#39;re
[1836.24s] excited about here&#39;s consumer staple
[1838.48s] stocks uh above the 200 day moving
[1841.039s] average this is kind of at an extreme
[1842.679s] here we like this exposure through the
[1845.48s] horels of the world through the dagios
[1848.559s] of the world through the things that
[1849.919s] have been beaten down uh of late I think
[1852.6s] they&#39;re going to start to
[1854.2s] perform uh no Twin Peaks in stocks okay
[1858.639s] uh cash bubble there&#39;s still 6.9
[1860.84s] trillion in Money Market funds so as
[1862.76s] yields go down and stocks go up there&#39;s
[1864.48s] going to be more of a Chase just human
[1867.24s] nature uh what else we have here home
[1869.799s] prices near all-time highs relative to
[1871.799s] rents so you can see the last few times
[1875.08s] that you had this extreme of prices
[1877.399s] relative to rents prices came down I do
[1880.639s] think that&#39;s going to be the
[1882.919s] case uh you know I you know particularly
[1887.12s] in Orange County here here uh where we
[1889.039s] just bought a house and we we did a
[1890.84s] special situation I I found an
[1893.0s] incredible I got it at a discount to
[1895.2s] what the guy paid in 2019 because he was
[1897.399s] in a pinch that I I just love deals okay
[1900.039s] I told my wife you want me to sell the
[1901.32s] bottom in Connecticut and buy the top in
[1902.84s] Orange County are you out of your mind
[1904.12s] have you been watching what I do for a
[1905.48s] living for the last 25 years uh the
[1907.72s] reason we where we are is because I do
[1909.72s] the opposite of that for a living uh
[1911.88s] long story short I I found a great
[1914.0s] situation where my margin of safety is
[1916.559s] fully intact and then uh
[1919.6s] if so so what&#39;s going on in Orange
[1923.519s] county is very similar to what happened
[1926.12s] in Orange County in the 90s uh early 90s
[1929.799s] is you had a ton of Japanese hot money
[1932.24s] come in trying to get out of Japan just
[1935.039s] like you&#39;ve had a ton of Chinese hot
[1936.88s] money come in uh
[1940.2s] um uh in the last few years from China
[1942.6s] trying to get out of China and my thesis
[1944.84s] is generally that you&#39;re going to see as
[1948.36s] the Chinese economy recovers and stocks
[1951.039s] start to do well in China you&#39;re not
[1952.919s] going to see money go back because it&#39;s
[1954.36s] so hard to get money out of China but
[1956.44s] you&#39;re going to stop seeing it pour out
[1959.399s] uh of China so the marginal buyers in
[1962.559s] these markets are going to dry up and
[1965.96s] once that marginal buyer dries up you
[1968.039s] see prices drop Prett pretty pretty
[1969.88s] quickly so um so I do think there&#39;s
[1974.0s] optimism for for people looking to buy a
[1976.279s] house um
[1979.12s] to just uh probably be patient depending
[1981.48s] on the area you&#39;re in I I mean I think
[1983.44s] in in areas that took longer to recover
[1985.88s] from the great financial crisis like
[1987.08s] Connecticut I think that they&#39;re going
[1988.84s] to continue to go up uh which is why we
[1990.799s] rented out our houses in Connecticut
[1992.399s] because I didn&#39;t want to be a seller in
[1993.799s] the whole uh uh and
[1998.0s] um so so that&#39;s that but you got to pay
[2000.679s] attention to these extremes when they&#39;re
[2003.24s] as my stat friend likes to say and I&#39;m
[2005.799s] going to speak to these incredible
[2007.24s] students on Monday uh at a high school
[2009.679s] in Orange County shout out to them and
[2012.559s] to Cork who invited me he&#39;s a statistics
[2015.039s] teacher there and does an incredible job
[2016.96s] for his students and I&#39;ll go uh have a
[2019.519s] few words with them uh as they&#39;ve
[2022.12s] requested um so uh they understand a lot
[2025.84s] about statistics and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be
[2027.44s] asking me about some of these charts
[2029.0s] which is exciting uh here&#39;s the US
[2031.12s] dollar breaking down we&#39;d like to see
[2032.84s] that for your presidential cycle again
[2035.08s] from Jeff you can take a look at that
[2038.44s] uh high yield credit spreads are near
[2040.519s] record low so just keeping an eye on
[2042.679s] that credit markets are still great uh I
[2045.48s] think Cooper standard will use that
[2047.159s] window to refinance in the first half of
[2049.04s] this year that&#39;ll even bring interest
[2050.56s] costs down further and push out
[2052.679s] maturities even Beyond uh where they are
[2055.56s] so that&#39;s another positive thing they
[2057.119s] just need a positive quarter which
[2058.56s] they&#39;re likely to get from the volumes
[2060.119s] last month and uh and they&#39;ll be Off to
[2062.56s] the Races how much Americans drink so
[2065.0s] people have been saying every no one&#39;s
[2066.359s] drinking anymore it runs in Cycles
[2069.56s] number one and number two we&#39;ve seen
[2073.0s] these type of Peaks and troughs before
[2075.599s] as a matter of fact drinking per capita
[2077.72s] was much lower in the late 90s than it
[2080.359s] is today uh so this little short-term
[2084.079s] blip is probably nothing more than that
[2086.079s] which is why we like the highest quality
[2087.76s] businesses in the most dislocated
[2089.359s] sectors it&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done it&#39;s
[2091.159s] why we bought Exxon in the 30s uh when
[2094.359s] uh during covid and Wells Fargo at $25
[2098.44s] and uh same thing with the alcohol
[2100.76s] companies with di AIO Etc it&#39;s the same
[2103.28s] exact trade it&#39;s it&#39;s maximum pessimism
[2106.2s] it&#39;s exactly what Templeton was talking
[2107.88s] about you don&#39;t need to just apply it to
[2109.72s] the markets and just say oh because one
[2112.68s] or two stocks are or seven stocks are
[2115.2s] super overvalued therefore everything&#39;s
[2117.04s] overvalued look under the surface there
[2119.079s] are things that are so pessimistic that
[2121.0s] are bull market opportunities and there
[2123.4s] are things that are too optimistic that
[2124.68s] are bare Market opportunities and you
[2126.4s] you just have to learn how to
[2128.48s] distinguish that over time
[2131.56s] um okay we&#39;ve got what else do we have
[2135.079s] here uh earnings are doing well we&#39;ll
[2137.56s] cover that at the end I think 12.7%
[2140.24s] earnings growth was above 9%
[2141.88s] expectations so that&#39;s good we&#39;re in the
[2143.88s] seasonal time of year where guidance is
[2146.16s] softer uh that has been the case they
[2148.48s] took down earnings from 275 to
[2153.52s] 272 so you have to keep your eye on that
[2155.92s] this is just another way of looking at
[2157.24s] the mid midterm this year tends to be
[2159.48s] strong uh midterms tend to be a little
[2161.96s] choppier so we&#39;ll be harvesting profits
[2164.079s] probably early next year and uh probably
[2167.56s] a lot more than we anticipate which is
[2169.24s] going to be exciting and um uh and then
[2172.839s] we&#39;ll put that dry powder to work in the
[2174.24s] hole when everyone else is puking at at
[2175.88s] the bottom uh consensus expects 10%
[2178.48s] earnings growth we did that companies
[2181.0s] have expressed optimism at record
[2184.0s] high so you see some mixed here&#39;s the uh
[2187.92s] guidance seasonality
[2191.599s] here this is interesting one quarter of
[2194.56s] S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to
[2196.72s] outpace the Magnificent 7 in two second
[2199.599s] half 2025 up from just 8% at the lows in
[2202.56s] second half 2023 so you&#39;re starting to
[2205.119s] see that re Brading that you
[2207.44s] see and uh and that&#39;s looking very
[2209.8s] healthy for the market the earnings
[2211.56s] growth we&#39;ve covered a million times mag
[2213.68s] 7 earnings are decelerating their
[2215.4s] multiples have not contracted yet but
[2217.079s] they&#39;re sted to uh and the rest of the
[2220.4s] market UNM magnificent 493 multiples are
[2223.359s] accelerating but their multiples have
[2224.96s] not expanded yet they will rate mag 7
[2228.16s] multiples will derate UNM magnificent
[2230.52s] 493 multiples will rate higher um the
[2235.68s] backers of the World when they finish
[2237.64s] the sale uh and the slow growing
[2240.68s] business uh is sold that multiple will
[2243.4s] rate from 12 to probably 16 17 they&#39;ll
[2247.079s] take their n interest expense down uh
[2249.44s] all those good things Tech materials and
[2251.52s] communication services are expected to
[2253.16s] drive best margin expansion in 20125 you
[2256.52s] still can&#39;t give away materials we&#39;ve
[2258.079s] been scooping it up like crazy uh album
[2260.72s] marals of the world Etc today was the
[2262.92s] best performance in consumer staples
[2264.44s] relative to technology since 2002 again
[2267.44s] pointing back to all the conditions that
[2269.319s] we said are prime for an outperformance
[2272.88s] dramatically of value versus growth
[2275.68s] small cap versus large emerg markets
[2278.04s] versus develop markets everything that
[2280.48s] people can&#39;t give away we are taking
[2282.76s] advantage of and it&#39;s starting to play
[2284.44s] out uh total net call volume buying all
[2288.28s] the mag seven at the top getting
[2290.52s] smoked um rig counts coming
[2293.76s] down China industrial profits going
[2298.24s] up us manufacturing PMI turning up we&#39;re
[2301.24s] coming out of the manufacturing
[2302.599s] depression how are you taking advantage
[2304.4s] of that we know our plays uh breath
[2307.839s] expansion awaits macro conf
[2310.4s] confirmation from the ISM Manufacturing
[2312.72s] PMI which all the data is pointing back
[2314.839s] up we&#39;ve been covering that for weeks
[2317.28s] percentage of S&amp;P members above their
[2319.68s] 50-day M moving average you&#39;re seeing
[2321.359s] this breath really start to turn around
[2323.079s] since the inauguration as we had
[2325.319s] anticipated here&#39;s a look at nvidia&#39;s
[2327.92s] massive earnings rise and analyst
[2330.079s] forecast for continued strength are
[2332.2s] these forecasts to upbeat so they&#39;re
[2334.8s] basically
[2336.2s] saying that
[2342.319s] two years out it will be from earnings
[2345.4s] obscurity to the largest company in the
[2346.839s] world in two years and and never
[2348.4s] stopping so 200 billion so they think
[2349.96s] it&#39;s going to be half they basically
[2351.72s] think this company is going to be half
[2353.079s] of US GDP so uh I wouldn&#39;t bet on it
[2356.359s] ladies and gentlemen and um the wings
[2359.599s] are beginning to melt that&#39;s all I can
[2361.48s] tell you uh Equity risk premium people
[2363.96s] view this as a negative I view it as a
[2365.88s] positive why because this is
[2368.76s] concentrated and impacted dramatically
[2371.2s] by the mag 7 same thing that happened in
[2375.04s] 2001 which led to a period of dramatic
[2377.52s] outperformance of what small caps
[2380.2s] International value uh all the things
[2383.04s] that we are loaded into and taking
[2385.319s] advantage of prime book magnificent 7
[2388.079s] completely overweight they&#39;ve been
[2389.4s] puking out of it while the retailers
[2391.68s] have been buying retail investors have
[2393.64s] been buying it uh we&#39;re seeing how that
[2395.8s] ends and then we get a lot of these dip
[2397.4s] buyers that aren&#39;t going to understand
[2398.56s] how a bare Market Works in certain
[2400.599s] stocks that are going to keep buying the
[2401.92s] dips and keep getting burned uh views of
[2404.76s] Lula turn negative when momo stocks
[2406.96s] break they don&#39;t recover quickly um
[2410.119s] that&#39;s that&#39;s all I can tell you from
[2411.359s] years of experience um views of Lula
[2414.72s] turn negative Brazilians worry on taxes
[2417.2s] and economy this is very positive if
[2419.839s] Lula gets dumped Brazil is going to be a
[2422.4s] monster of opportunity and we will start
[2424.079s] to take advantage of it now that China&#39;s
[2425.88s] working so well uh Dallas fed
[2428.359s] manufacturing this is what we were
[2429.599s] talking about coming out of the
[2430.72s] manufacturing
[2432.48s] depression
[2435.0s] um yeah so this is deep seek numbers but
[2437.839s] a day later Alibaba came out with quen
[2440.56s] and smoked all these numbers so that&#39;s
[2442.52s] all you need to know there uh Bank of
[2445.319s] Japan raises interest rates we cover
[2447.079s] this to the highest in 17 years so when
[2449.48s] people are talking about deep seek deep
[2451.2s] seek definitely has something to do with
[2452.68s] it uh but also pay attention to the
[2454.92s] carry trade onwi and uh watch the money
[2458.119s] flows and you&#39;ll understand why these
[2460.16s] High Flyers are are starting to get gut
[2462.96s] punched
[2464.56s] uh Japan CPI this is turning up and you
[2469.0s] know you have to consider Japan has no
[2471.56s] natural resources that&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s
[2473.359s] always been a train wreck and their
[2474.52s] birth rate is is a train wreck but
[2478.52s] um so so they&#39;ve got all the input costs
[2481.359s] they&#39;ve got no way to do it uh they&#39;ve
[2483.76s] been priming the pump inflation is going
[2486.599s] up they&#39;re going to have to continue to
[2488.24s] raise which is going to continue to
[2489.68s] unwind the carry trade and you&#39;re going
[2491.92s] to watch what happens over the next 6 to
[2493.76s] 12 to 18 months similar things that
[2496.48s] happened in the periods that we&#39;ve
[2498.28s] discussed every single week and you&#39;re
[2499.68s] seeing seeing play out in real
[2505.4s] time here&#39;s the Japanese 2-year
[2508.599s] government bond yield going par
[2510.48s] parabolic basically
[2512.56s] here here is the Chinese Yuan starting
[2515.96s] to strengthen this was a key condition
[2517.839s] we talked about for Chinese equities to
[2520.44s] start to take off we&#39;re seeing it all
[2522.0s] fall into place yuan&#39;s best week in two
[2525.4s] years while we had the US Dollar&#39;s worst
[2529.079s] week in many
[2530.28s] years healthc care remember we talked
[2532.599s] about it on Fox coming into the new year
[2535.079s] we said no one wants materials no one
[2536.72s] wants healthc care these are the top
[2538.68s] performers they&#39;re kicking butt in the
[2540.48s] first month of the
[2541.88s] year
[2544.599s] uh broad deflationary impact is in
[2547.24s] attacked so inflation&#39;s under control
[2549.119s] that should give fed cover to do the
[2552.0s] final one or two cuts probably back half
[2554.72s] of the Year number percentage of
[2557.28s] companies outperforming the S&amp;P 500
[2559.28s] since 1990 haven&#39;t seen this again going
[2562.48s] back to that 2000 period when all the
[2565.359s] things we talked about took off uh steel
[2568.28s] came out and increased their price
[2570.44s] Target to $35 on VF Corp as we always
[2575.559s] say opinion follows Trend and sure
[2579.4s] enough uh Brack and Daryl shot the
[2581.64s] lights out and uh the analysts have to
[2584.599s] follow so they&#39;ve all been conservative
[2586.559s] the same thing you&#39;ll start to see
[2587.76s] happen with Baba same thing happens over
[2589.88s] and over
[2591.079s] vernado uh what whatever it happens to
[2593.76s] be we we keep seeing this over and over
[2596.079s] and over 10-year government bond yield
[2598.599s] coming down quite a
[2601.839s] bit uh let&#39;s see
[2605.119s] here Japanese Yen starting to strengthen
[2607.8s] carry trade starting to unwind again
[2611.16s] expectations for global economic boom
[2613.64s] highest since April
[2616.16s] 2022 uh you also had that early in
[2618.76s] Trump&#39;s term in 17 and that was a good
[2620.68s] thing so that&#39;s not necessarily bearish
[2622.16s] you had it in
[2623.4s] 201 uh so that&#39;s kind of a mixed
[2626.48s] indicator current combination of macro
[2629.079s] conditions has historically been
[2630.28s] supportive of risk assets uh so what you
[2633.079s] see here is after the first cut if
[2634.88s] there&#39;s no recession Equity markets tend
[2636.72s] to do very well in the coming years we
[2639.16s] agree here&#39;s a post from a guy named
[2642.04s] Jeff
[2644.2s] weninger this Market&#39;s leadership is on
[2646.839s] tender
[2648.24s] hooks uh so what he&#39;s basically
[2651.4s] showing is that when you have a one-day
[2653.44s] change S&amp;P 500 equal weighted index
[2656.64s] minus the S&amp;P 500 when it gets this
[2659.359s] extreme that tends to be the bottom in
[2661.4s] the equal weighted basket and then sure
[2664.119s] enough equal weight starts to outperform
[2667.2s] uh Market weight here&#39;s an example post
[2671.119s] of opinion follows Trend you know these
[2673.52s] are same type of people who wanted
[2676.48s] nothing to do with Alibaba at $58 when
[2679.24s] we were pounding the table nothing to do
[2681.2s] with it at 62 nothing to do with it at
[2683.28s] 80 now it&#39;s at 103 and they&#39;re all
[2686.2s] saying uh getting prepared for a blast
[2688.8s] off sometime in 2025 so you know they
[2691.88s] missed the first 80% but you know other
[2694.16s] than that how was the play Mrs Lincoln
[2696.2s] so let&#39;s move on here
[2699.48s] um why some Magnificent Seven companies
[2702.319s] could be earning Less in
[2704.119s] 2050 than today and in this chart you&#39;ll
[2707.839s] see the top 10 US companies in q1 of
[2711.64s] 2000 trailing 12-month Gap net income
[2714.68s] track through 2025 rebased to 100 as of
[2717.8s] q1 2000 Legend ordered high to low in
[2720.72s] terms of growth since 2000 and basically
[2723.4s] what you&#39;re seeing here is the companies
[2725.76s] that were the Magnificent set in
[2727.92s] 2000 uh significant portion of them ear
[2730.8s] are earning less today than they did at
[2733.079s] their Peak 25 years ago
[2737.04s] uh four of the top 10 earners of the S&amp;P
[2740.119s] 500 at the turn of the century currently
[2742.119s] earn less than nominal earnings than
[2743.68s] they did in 2000 according to a review
[2746.119s] by Jim Reed at Deutsche
[2749.4s] Bank uh those four companies were pegged
[2751.76s] as IBM City Group GE and Intel while
[2754.319s] Microsoft earnings were are uh 10 times
[2757.2s] what they were in
[2758.88s] 2000 uh if it is possible that a couple
[2762.319s] of the mag 7 earn Less in 2050 than they
[2765.64s] do today even if the index is
[2767.48s] significantly higher read ask history
[2769.64s] would say yes it is I would Bank on 50%
[2772.72s] of the mag 7 will be earning Less in
[2775.04s] 2050 than they are today in nominal
[2777.359s] terms I can I can almost guarantee that
[2779.16s] I would make that bet it it if you&#39;re a
[2781.64s] sside banker and you want to sell me a
[2784.079s] swap on that I I&#39;ll I&#39;ll load up the
[2786.24s] truck so call me baby you can put your
[2789.359s] six points embedded in it we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll
[2791.319s] be happy to do business Trump would
[2794.2s] rather not put tariffs on China
[2795.96s] maintains
[2797.28s] threat um Japan core inflation climbs to
[2800.559s] a 16-month high boosting case for rate
[2804.24s] hikes Yuan gains As Trump dials back
[2807.0s] tariff
[2807.92s] threats Trump says he&#39;ll demand interest
[2810.24s] rates drop urges OPEC to cut oil prices
[2813.04s] in davo speech Trump says he knows
[2815.44s] interest rates better than fed Chief
[2817.319s] Powell so there will be a push pull
[2818.8s] there he&#39;ll get one or two cuts out of
[2820.24s] him but Powell&#39;s like hey uh Legacy baby
[2823.28s] I&#39;m riding this baby out until early
[2825.04s] next year when I when I step down on my
[2826.8s] own terms uh we&#39;ll see you know never
[2829.52s] never count Trump out if he wants
[2830.96s] something he&#39;s going to get it uh
[2832.68s] Beijing tells insurers to buy more
[2834.24s] Chinese stocks China&#39;s new rules add
[2836.88s] $138 billion into the market Japan
[2840.24s] raises interest rates to highest level
[2841.839s] since 2008 that is a carry trade on wine
[2844.8s] ladies and gentlemen this is was the
[2846.119s] last carry trade on unwind so pay
[2849.28s] attention Burberry sees positive signs
[2851.72s] as turnaround plan continues I think a
[2853.359s] lot of these luxury brands are going to
[2855.079s] start to see their day now that China&#39;s
[2856.839s] back uh whe you know that also includes
[2859.76s] Nike but certainly Canada Goose uh Vans
[2862.64s] is already seeing U VF Corp is already
[2865.28s] seeing it in Spades um and we&#39;ll see
[2869.44s] many more to come Beijing tells insurers
[2871.4s] to buy more Chinese
[2873.64s] stocks us Bond stocks at most expensive
[2876.319s] relative to Bond since.com error these
[2878.72s] are all the things that we keep talking
[2880.16s] about this is equity risk premium and
[2882.2s] they keep talking about it as stocks
[2884.04s] it&#39;s the mag 7 pushing so what&#39;s going
[2885.76s] to get hurt is what&#39;s pushing it I mean
[2887.96s] Buffett had monster returns in 2000 2001
[2892.48s] 2002 2003 2004 when everyone else was
[2895.359s] getting smoked CU while everyone was
[2897.48s] buying Global Crossing and Enron and uh
[2901.119s] Cisco he was buying you know Coca-Cola
[2904.28s] and boring stocks that no one wanted and
[2907.04s] he just dramatically outperformed he was
[2909.48s] ahead of the curb he skated to where the
[2910.839s] puck was going not where it was while
[2912.72s] they were writing articles about him
[2914.44s] wondering if quote unquote Buffett has
[2916.24s] lost his touch he was getting wealthier
[2918.64s] and wealthier dollar post worse week in

[2928.72s] some actions calling some stuff uh we
[2931.079s] covered that one in one of the recent
[2932.44s] weekly articles will the Chinese
[2934.88s] consumer finally start spending uh good
[2937.559s] question my answer is probably different
[2939.88s] than Bloomberg&#39;s midcap stocks have been
[2942.44s] in the shadows why 2025 could be there
[2944.799s] year we were talking about that all
[2946.44s] fourth quarter you guys are already
[2947.839s] positioned for it dollar uh Falls after
[2951.24s] Donald Trump hints at softer stance on
[2952.76s] China tariffs uh so 60% on day one was
[2957.359s] uh not in the cards we&#39;ll see how it
[2959.799s] goes investors bet Trump will make
[2961.44s] Europe investable again we&#39;ve seen the
[2963.599s] biggest inflows into European stocks
[2965.88s] starting to perform International is
[2967.48s] going to perform we&#39;ve got some exposure
[2970.16s] in Europe through gxo as our big play we
[2973.52s] think that&#39;s going to be a home run pboc

[2987.799s] coupon handout for from far from enough
[2992.48s] to Spur consumption so this is a this is
[2995.079s] a journalist who is just looking at one
[2998.16s] off what they&#39;re neglecting to take into
[3000.76s] account is the fact that these one-offs
[3002.28s] have been going on for 12 months and
[3003.68s] they&#39;re all starting to collect and the
[3005.799s] beach ball is getting ready or and it&#39;s
[3007.64s] starting to explode out of the water
[3009.119s] it&#39;s been held underneath the water for
[3010.839s] too long and now it&#39;s Off to the Races
[3012.88s] Nvidia slashes nearly 600 billion in
[3014.72s] market value uh what&#39;s what&#39;s driving
[3017.799s] the Panic okay Estee louder reviews
[3020.72s] Brands amid management change Beauty
[3023.119s] group is working with evercore to uh
[3025.0s] review portfolio looking to improve
[3026.72s] performance under new CEO look all you
[3028.799s] need to know from this article is very
[3030.64s] simple the louder family owns 38% of
[3033.359s] Este louder&#39;s total common stock and
[3035.04s] about 86% of the voting power they are
[3037.359s] going to get this right if you remember
[3039.44s] Walmart had periods like this and the
[3041.88s] Walmart family stepped in got a new CEO
[3045.04s] made changes invested in online
[3047.76s] massively the market said oh they&#39;re
[3049.559s] they&#39;re crazy they&#39;re blowing all their
[3051.68s] profits and now uh they&#39;ve been
[3053.52s] dominating same exact thing is going to
[3055.839s] happen with s louder they&#39;ve been
[3057.2s] through this in the past they sell
[3058.48s] Brands they buy Brands same as VF Corp
[3060.64s] they&#39;ve been trading brands for over a
[3061.96s] hundred years they know how to how to
[3064.079s] how to do it Young Americans are
[3065.88s] drinking less but can it last and we
[3068.079s] kind of covered that with the other
[3069.319s] chart the answer is uh no uh people are
[3073.4s] going to drink and uh uh it it goes in
[3077.079s] cycles and here even so they&#39;re picking
[3080.2s] up some some market share with these low
[3082.72s] and no alcohol uh beverage markets look
[3086.04s] all that&#39;s good thing but in the scheme
[3087.799s] of History the way these quality stocks
[3091.319s] are priced relative to the reality of
[3094.68s] the uh shortterm softness in the
[3097.48s] underlying business is such a big
[3099.88s] Divergence that&#39;s how you make money you
[3101.88s] know if if a stock is down 50 60 70% and
[3107.079s] it&#39;s the best in class and the overall
[3109.119s] industry is down two 2 and a
[3111.68s] half% uh that&#39;s an opportunity because
[3114.16s] even if the pi gets smaller it&#39;s just
[3116.119s] going to put the strongest player in a
[3117.72s] position to cobble up more of the
[3119.119s] competition and take advantage so even
[3121.119s] if the pi went 75% smaller and the
[3123.52s] number one player controls 100% of the
[3125.48s] you know 95% of the market uh that&#39;s a
[3127.92s] win that&#39;s not going to be the case here
[3130.16s] but it&#39;s just a way to think about it
[3132.359s] another mental model to keep in the back
[3134.24s] of your head Beijing unveil 7.2 billion
[3137.16s] injection of insur capital for stocks AI
[3140.0s] fueled stock rally deal dealt $1
[3142.04s] trillion doll Blow by Chinese upstart

[3147.2s] to do Chinese boost index Investments
[3149.64s] and latest bid to revive markets
[3152.44s] building products distributor qxo
[3154.119s] launches hostile bid for Beacon this is
[3156.839s] not Brad Jacobs Mo to do hostile he&#39;s
[3160.28s] very Cooperative uh kind of acquirer and
[3165.44s] activist he is paying up for Beacon I
[3168.16s] don&#39;t like that but he sees something
[3171.24s] that I don&#39;t see and I&#39;m going to trust
[3173.76s] his judgment based on the fact that he&#39;s
[3176.72s] built a handful of multi-billion dollar
[3179.16s] companies from scratch and made
[3180.88s] shareholders billions upon billions of
[3183.04s] dollars over many decades whether United
[3186.24s] Rentals whether um XPO whether Waste
[3190.76s] Connections uh you name it he&#39;s done it
[3193.119s] he knows how to do it and he just needs
[3194.88s] to get in the game so he&#39;ll wind up
[3196.4s] having to pay more I think he&#39;s going to
[3198.28s] get this done I wouldn&#39;t lose sleep if
[3200.599s] he didn&#39;t I know the market will be
[3202.079s] disappointed in the short term and we
[3203.44s] can build a bigger position but um
[3207.2s] I think he&#39;ll get it done I don&#39;t think
[3209.48s] he&#39;ll get an enormous pop because he&#39;s
[3211.04s] going to overpay for it but he&#39;s talking
[3213.16s] about the benefit of what he&#39;s always
[3215.24s] done in his rollups is he&#39;s brought
[3216.88s] technology into boring industries that
[3220.2s] he can buy at a reasonable price and
[3222.16s] then he he rolls up a fragmented
[3224.24s] industry so he&#39;s paying up for this
[3226.839s] public
[3227.96s] platform uh and then he&#39;ll roll up a ton
[3230.4s] of fragmented private businesses at much
[3233.0s] lower multiples so we&#39;ll get it back he
[3234.72s] just needs a platform to play and uh and
[3238.2s] uh I have I have full confidence but you
[3240.319s] know this is this is uh
[3243.52s] uncharacteristic but probably necessary
[3245.72s] at this point and my guess is they&#39;ve
[3247.68s] got two or three other options if this
[3249.559s] one doesn&#39;t work out for some reason uh
[3252.04s] Boeing&#39;s Rosie Outlook negates the need
[3253.72s] for fire
[3255.72s] sale don&#39;t know what that
[3259.4s] is where do
[3263.92s] we oh us manufacturers show signs of
[3267.04s] recovery from 2-year
[3269.079s] slump GM stock Falls as carmaker signals
[3272.04s] that tariffs may impact his Outlook uh
[3274.559s] yeah and it&#39;s and it&#39;s completely
[3275.96s] unknown but their numbers were better
[3278.559s] than expected their units are better
[3280.079s] than expected and I think that is going
[3281.88s] to continue you cannot invest on the
[3284.68s] basis of what may or may not happen in
[3286.72s] terms of policy it&#39;s going to take you
[3287.96s] out of too many stocks at the end of the
[3290.079s] day if the worst case happens with
[3295.319s] tariffs people are still going to need
[3297.799s] cars with the average car on the road
[3299.44s] being 13.5 years rates are still go
[3301.799s] short rates are still trending down
[3304.24s] which helps the consumer the difference
[3305.68s] is going to be like houses not everyone
[3307.96s] needs a 6,000 ft starter home so they&#39;re
[3311.0s] building a lot more
[3312.68s] 2,500 foot homes and more and more
[3315.319s] people are moving from Big SUVs to uh
[3318.24s] more affordable sedans and I think
[3319.88s] that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to see and
[3321.119s] units are going to go up they just might
[3323.039s] be smaller units but it doesn&#39;t matter
[3326.079s] from a Cooper standard perspective it
[3327.559s] does matter from a margin perspective
[3328.96s] for GM it does not matter from a margin
[3331.48s] perspective for Cooper
[3334.119s] standard billionaire Castell to acquire
[3336.48s] Diago&#39;s unit and expand in Ghana so he
[3339.4s] will get Ghana Guinness uh Boeing CEO
[3342.359s] don&#39;t expect a major restructuring
[3343.88s] possibly a pruning so he&#39;s showing signs
[3346.0s] of confidence uh also says company
[3349.039s] reaching 737 key Milestone this year uh
[3353.359s] Alibaba T&#39;s new AI model as it says
[3355.88s] rival
[3356.839s] deep seek open Ai and meta&#39;s top
[3359.079s] offerings it doesn&#39;t just rival it
[3361.2s] exceeds according to the data 10-year
[3363.88s] treasury yield slides after weaker than
[3366.359s] expected GDP Baba launches new AI model
[3370.359s] that outperforms de seek blah blah blah
[3372.88s] Intel&#39;s fourth quarter sales beat
[3374.68s] estimates during turnaround there&#39;s
[3376.48s] nothing to do with this story until they
[3378.079s] announce a new CEO or we figure out if
[3380.359s] they&#39;re in play but uh I think the next
[3382.92s] catalyst is a new CEO nice to see that
[3384.96s] they did a little better than expected
[3387.44s] uh shows progress in the face of another
[3389.48s] decline look number one co- CEOs never
[3391.72s] work number two uh you just need to get
[3393.96s] a new big name in there and uh and the
[3396.16s] game will be on it&#39;s uh planes and
[3398.76s] parkus stock market and sentiment
[3401.079s] results so we covered a lot of this uh
[3404.48s] what I want to
[3408.76s] cover uh oh this was interesting Canada
[3411.88s] Goose got the green light from the
[3413.16s] Ontario Securities Commission to buy
[3414.92s] back up to 10% of its public public
[3416.48s] float doubling its us share repurchase
[3419.16s] capacity in other words our slice of p
[3421.319s] is about to get 10% bigger without
[3423.2s] putting up any additional Capital which
[3425.359s] is exciting that&#39;s why the stock is
[3426.68s] starting to move and I&#39;m sure they
[3428.4s] wouldn&#39;t be in the market buying a ton
[3429.76s] of stock if sales were going to be weak
[3431.559s] if in case you haven&#39;t noticed it&#39;s been
[3432.88s] a cold winter uh and Asia is back so I
[3435.599s] would expect uh better numbers than one
[3438.4s] would anticipate moving forward in which
[3440.839s] case uh the BuyBacks will be very
[3443.4s] meaningful uh Boeing update
[3448.88s] so what I&#39;d rather do you can read
[3452.28s] through the article of the week if you
[3453.48s] haven&#39;t already we&#39;re going to listen to
[3455.079s] the CEO himself Kelly ortberg on CNBC
[3458.16s] right after earnings Boeing as well
[3460.88s] company reporting its biggest annual
[3462.599s] loss since 2020 and our Phil leau is
[3464.96s] here this morning with the CEO hey
[3467.839s] Phil hey Carl Kelly oror thank you for
[3470.799s] joining us uh this morning uh look we
[3473.319s] know what 2024 was and you do that going
[3475.76s] into this job um as you look at
[3478.839s] 2025 I can tell that you see some some
[3481.44s] reasons for optimism here yeah I really
[3483.88s] do despite the challenging fourth
[3485.599s] quarter uh we are making some some
[3488.28s] significant progress you know we had a
[3490.599s] great Capital rise so the balance sheet
[3492.4s] is solid uh for the next year and we&#39;re
[3495.079s] starting to see really good progress as
[3496.76s] we ramp production back up on the 737
[3499.76s] and the max production rate is is
[3501.72s] critically important to the recovery of
[3503.319s] the program of the company are you
[3505.2s] seeing what you need need to see so far
[3507.079s] to say yeah I like where we&#39;re headed in
[3509.88s] terms of getting ultimately to 38 per
[3512.319s] month at some point this year yeah we&#39;re
[3514.319s] actually a little ahead of where I
[3515.72s] expected you know we coming out of the
[3517.52s] strike uh we slowed down intentionally
[3520.72s] uh rebalance the production line and I
[3522.72s] think that&#39;s paying big dividends for us
[3524.599s] right now we&#39;ll probably deliver in the
[3526.4s] upper 30s uh on produ on 737 Maxes in
[3530.799s] January now we had a lot of airplanes in
[3532.92s] inventory so we&#39;re flushing through that
[3535.319s] that inventory but so far so good and
[3537.52s] what I look at is is less about the
[3539.599s] deliveries and more about the key
[3541.48s] performance indicators that the FAA is
[3543.599s] using to determine whether we&#39;re able to
[3546.16s] move Beyond 38 a month and those
[3547.96s] indicators are looking good and we&#39;re
[3549.92s] going to stay focused on making sure
[3551.68s] we&#39;re discipline as we build uh these
[3553.839s] airplanes and ramp back up all of this
[3555.72s] is happening as we have a new president
[3558.0s] in office two questions here one have
[3560.72s] you talked with President Trump and two
[3563.44s] Elon Musk and doge is one of his big
[3567.64s] plants and driving greater efficiency I
[3570.64s] know you&#39;ve talked with Elon Musk you&#39;ve
[3572.48s] had him down to your facility where
[3574.079s] you&#39;re building the new Air Force One
[3576.079s] what&#39;s your perspective in terms of what
[3578.2s] president Trump will do during his
[3580.599s] administration well first of all I mean
[3582.52s] he&#39;s keenly focused on American jobs and
[3585.039s] he knows that the aviation industry is
[3587.64s] is critically important to American jobs
[3590.0s] and we build these airplanes in the US
[3591.72s] and we export them throughout the
[3593.24s] throughout the world so I think the
[3595.0s] administration is going to be very
[3596.4s] supportive of not just Boeing but the
[3598.559s] overall uh Aerospace industry and yeah
[3601.28s] we&#39;ve been engaged with with Elon on
[3603.799s] looking particularly at the vc25b
[3606.4s] program at looking at that program and
[3608.599s] seeing are there areas that we can make
[3611.16s] changes to that program eliminate cost
[3613.559s] eliminate schedule uh the the uh
[3616.52s] president wants the airplane sooner and
[3618.359s] so we&#39;re working with Elon and their
[3619.799s] team to figure out what can we do to
[3621.52s] pull up the schedule of that aircraft
[3623.24s] have the interactions so far been what
[3625.119s] you would call Construction oh yeah
[3626.64s] absolutely I mean they sincerely are
[3628.72s] looking at at things that are in the
[3631.0s] contract or in the process that are
[3633.52s] slowing us down that aren&#39;t providing
[3635.52s] value and we&#39;re engaging with the with
[3637.839s] the Doge team to see if we can&#39;t find
[3640.64s] that right uh mix of of of requirements
[3643.68s] that need to come out and get out of our
[3645.24s] way so that we can be more efficient and
[3647.24s] deliver a better product Kelly Jim&#39;s got
[3649.0s] a question for you Jim go ahead thank
[3651.24s] you Phil Kelly thank you for coming on
[3653.48s] I&#39;m wondering why this uh the second
[3656.44s] half is when things get better I would
[3658.48s] expect that the second quarter is the
[3661.039s] reason I mentioned that is because I
[3662.319s] don&#39;t want people to buy the stock
[3663.52s] knowing the second quarter is awful I
[3665.48s] mean how do we know that that things are
[3667.64s] going to get better in the third quarter
[3668.96s] if the second quarter is not
[3671.48s] good well Jim we haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t
[3673.96s] forecast a a bad second quarter what
[3676.839s] we&#39;ve said is that the first half will
[3679.079s] be a usage of cash and then we&#39;ll do
[3681.039s] we&#39;ll turn to a a cash positive in the
[3683.48s] second half of the year but it&#39;s all
[3684.88s] determinant on the the uh 737 Max
[3688.319s] production rates and I&#39;m not going to
[3690.079s] put a date on when we need to get to
[3691.72s] rate 38 and get approval for the FAA to
[3694.4s] go beyond it&#39;s more important that we do
[3696.68s] this right we have a stable production
[3698.68s] system we get through that and I expect
[3701.079s] by the second half of the year we&#39;ll
[3703.16s] have that approval and we&#39;ll be moving
[3704.799s] to a higher production rate so that&#39;s
[3706.799s] really what&#39;s driving the first half
[3708.88s] second half profile uh you got the uh
[3711.88s] labor agreement I know your hands on now
[3714.359s] looks like that you&#39;ve got a lot of good
[3715.64s] people people uh how many can you do Max
[3718.359s] how many not the max but how many can
[3720.0s] you make per month because I&#39;m trying to
[3722.279s] figure out how to model what the second
[3723.88s] half could
[3725.92s] be well uh we&#39;re planning to be at about
[3728.68s] 38 a month for uh the balance of of this
[3732.24s] year ramping up um to and we&#39;ll go in
[3735.16s] five step increments every six months uh
[3738.799s] after that so that gives you a feel for
[3740.52s] how to uh how to model the the rate
[3743.96s] increases on 787 where at 5 a month uh
[3747.24s] rate moving to 7 a month rate and we&#39;ll
[3749.52s] do that uh when our performance
[3751.119s] indicators say uh the production system
[3753.44s] is stable and hopefully that&#39;s in the
[3755.119s] next quarter or so Kelly when you look
[3757.24s] at your defense and space portfolio look
[3760.16s] it&#39;s been a mess you continue to lose
[3761.92s] money with some of these programs
[3763.4s] especially the fixed price programs
[3765.68s] contracts that have just not been
[3767.599s] they&#39;ve not been good contracts have you
[3770.2s] talked with the incoming or the new
[3772.44s] defense secretary I I guess and and do
[3775.119s] you expect that to change in terms of
[3778.039s] how these contracts are Bid out because
[3780.079s] clearly it has not worked over the last
[3782.079s] several years well uh so first of all I
[3784.599s] haven&#39;t spoke to the newc def but I
[3786.68s] certainly hope to um as he just you know
[3789.119s] was just confirmed um I I don&#39;t think
[3792.0s] that we&#39;re going to change our approach
[3793.92s] to uh these programs as you know we&#39;ve
[3796.24s] learned a lot about these fixed price
[3797.68s] development programs and we&#39;re just not
[3799.039s] going to enter into the wrong contracts
[3801.599s] fixed price has its place uh but it
[3804.359s] isn&#39;t in uh high-risk development areas
[3807.039s] I think Cost Plus is more appropriate I
[3809.359s] don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to
[3810.279s] significantly change but you know we&#39;ll
[3812.279s] work with the administration as they
[3814.079s] look at what they want to do for
[3815.88s] Contracting going forward you have some
[3817.52s] divisions that you are currently
[3819.48s] considering or or have said look we will
[3821.92s] take some bids on some of our uh
[3824.559s] divisions or businesses subsidiaries how
[3827.52s] many of those do you expect those
[3829.52s] transactions to take place this year
[3831.48s] well uh a few um you know we&#39;ve got
[3834.48s] couple a couple in ADV Advanced stages
[3836.839s] that we&#39;re looking at um you know I&#39;m
[3838.799s] through my portfolio review uh don&#39;t
[3841.72s] think of this as major structural
[3843.559s] redesign of the of the corporation but I
[3846.079s] do think there&#39;s places that we can
[3848.24s] streamline and so we&#39;ll be actioning
[3850.44s] those uh here in the next uh six months
[3852.839s] to a year uh when might we expect you to
[3855.44s] name a new president CEO of space and
[3858.839s] defense is that a first half uh higher
[3861.52s] or do you think it may take a little
[3862.96s] longer you know I don&#39;t have a fixed
[3864.88s] time on that Phil uh you know it depends
[3867.039s] on the the um availability of the right
[3869.839s] person to to lead that and and um I&#39;ve
[3872.839s] got an interim CEO is&#39;s doing a great
[3874.68s] job right now so I&#39;m not in a hurry to
[3876.64s] make a bad decision uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll uh
[3879.64s] take that when when the time&#39;s right and
[3881.96s] we&#39;re back and
[3886.52s] then we had uh VF Corp and Brack and
[3890.48s] Daryl did an incredible job
[3893.799s] uh you can go through these key points
[3896.24s] on your own I think his
[3898.92s] interview on CNBC after earnings told
[3901.72s] the whole story and you know I was
[3904.359s] pretty optimistic kind of thinking that
[3906.4s] this is a story that could easily go to
[3907.799s] $40 $50 if you remember listen Liz this
[3910.599s] is going to be incredible turnar around
[3912.039s] and she&#39;s like she looked at me like I
[3913.839s] had three heads she&#39;s like John what do
[3915.359s] you think you know kind of like this kid
[3917.2s] is crazy and uh and sure enough it&#39;s a a
[3921.119s] double now and probably a lot more so I
[3923.68s] figured it would be a triple but
[3924.96s] listening to him
[3926.2s] and kind of his long-term
[3928.24s] mindset
[3930.2s] uh as these numbers continue to improve
[3933.16s] and the free cash flow continues to
[3934.48s] improve he&#39;s going to be buying in stock
[3936.4s] I think this is going to be a lot more
[3937.559s] than that and we&#39;ll just see how the
[3939.52s] fundamentals go take that when when the
[3941.76s] time&#39;s right but
[3945.0s] um there you go congratulations on
[3947.52s] hanging in guys you deserve it and uh
[3950.48s] just the beginning so on to the next
[3959.599s] sentiment is neutral managers are
[3962.48s] starting to get some more
[3964.52s] exposure re earnings top 30 weights are
[3967.52s] up 17 bips utilities top 30 weights
[3972.72s] revisions up 40 bips in the last 60
[3977.119s] days and on uh here is
[3980.92s] the earnings growth rate with 16% of the
[3985.039s] S&amp;P reported is
[3986.599s] 12.7% that&#39;s exceeding estimates by
[3990.0s] about
[3992.4s] 3.7% uh so that&#39;s positive guidance
[3995.039s] though has come in a little bit which is
[3996.839s] normal seasonally so we&#39;ll keep an eye
[3998.68s] on that uh so with that said we&#39;re going
[4001.24s] to move on to the ask me anything
[4003.2s] questions if you like the ask me
[4004.44s] anything questions hang out with us for
[4006.44s] a little bit if you don&#39;t thanks for
[4008.52s] tuning in this week we&#39;ll be back next
[4010.359s] week um so here&#39;s the first question
[4013.48s] from JP
[4017.279s] hi Tom thank you for all that you share
[4019.2s] you create more value than you will ever
[4020.76s] know what is your opinion on UPS I like
[4023.64s] that they&#39;re getting rid of less
[4025.359s] profitable work focus on higher margin
[4027.119s] reminds me of
[4028.799s] PayPal Ah that&#39;s a good question I kind
[4031.839s] of started to sniff that one
[4034.88s] out but I continue to think it&#39;s a
[4038.079s] little bit early you don&#39;t fire Amazon
[4041.72s] and um
[4047.52s] get away with it right away uh that&#39;s
[4050.039s] all I can say I think that this one is a
[4052.88s] wait and see I you know I&#39;d probably put
[4056.079s] an alert below a 100 bucks if it breaks
[4057.88s] a 100 bucks I&#39;m going to start to look
[4059.16s] at it aggressively but right here I
[4061.68s] think it&#39;s in flux uh Michael I see a
[4064.96s] lot more Amazon trucks than I do UPS
[4066.92s] trucks that&#39;s for damn sure uh Michael
[4073.48s] Oak o
[4078.359s] oer
[4080.319s] Oar uh Tom thank you for your weekly
[4082.72s] lessons could you lay your thoughts on
[4084.279s] Cole&#39;s
[4086.16s] Corporation will the new CEO from
[4088.16s] Walmart Ashley Buchanan redefine back
[4092.4s] to middle class Shoppers currently
[4094.72s] closing unproductive stores and cutting
[4096.239s] Workforce probably cut
[4098.4s] dividend is that debt B burden
[4101.56s] untenable thanks uh We&#39;ve looked at this
[4103.799s] one a few times and we&#39;ve continued to
[4105.52s] say no uh I think that&#39;s going to
[4108.6s] be the theme I will say driving around
[4111.52s] the other
[4112.679s] day I saw that they had these stores
[4115.12s] that were Kohl&#39;s plus
[4117.56s] Sephora and Sephora is on
[4120.799s] fire so that might get more feet into
[4123.44s] the door of younger people uh the store
[4125.759s] and the store concept never worked uh
[4128.44s] just see JC Penny
[4130.88s] but I I just can&#39;t get excited about
[4133.44s] this one so I&#39;m going to pass you know
[4136.04s] the retailing business is very very hard
[4139.239s] unless you&#39;re specialized like in
[4140.839s] Advanced Auto Parts and it&#39;s still hard
[4145.199s] um I think you&#39;re Pro I think this is a
[4148.44s] good trade I think it&#39;s going to be a
[4150.44s] long-term slog I just don&#39;t like the
[4152.319s] business I mean the Kmarts of the world
[4155.159s] it&#39;s very very tough to turn around that
[4157.239s] model um I&#39;d be more inclined to look at
[4160.6s] Target at
[4162.359s] these levels but uh I&#39;m not
[4169.0s] okay
[4171.56s] Patrick bunzel is asking about NE I
[4175.56s] don&#39;t know what NEP
[4177.44s] is oh next are our Energy
[4186.319s] Partners uh this is probably a don&#39;t
[4189.0s] touch
[4208.76s] what is
[4213.92s] xplr explore resources I neither of
[4218.64s] these are for me but thank you for
[4220.159s] tuning in uh David Pang
[4227.44s] hey Tom been listening for about a year
[4229.96s] I&#39;ve come to really enjoy your insights
[4231.48s] if you&#39;re ever in Columbus love to meet
[4233.719s] and be become a client okay uh oh here&#39;s
[4236.96s] the am okay metap fast uh no we&#39;ve
[4239.08s] covered that no thank you hard
[4243.199s] pass
[4245.36s] um thanks for the question and um yeah
[4248.88s] love to meet in person or when you&#39;re in
[4250.239s] New York or Orange
[4252.0s] County uh look me up
[4255.36s] Tom thank you for all that you share you
[4257.719s] create we did this don&#39;t resend
[4260.48s] questions
[4262.92s] guys all
[4265.92s] right Sam
[4268.4s] G love all the work you do for us thank
[4270.76s] you regarding CPS why to get your take
[4272.4s] on the impact of autonomous Robo taxi to
[4275.679s] earnings valuation over the next two to
[4277.64s] five years seems like autonomous Robo
[4279.08s] taxi is getting a lot more attention or
[4280.719s] hype whether it&#39;s warranted or not
[4282.52s] wonder if it&#39;s impacting multiples logic
[4284.28s] would imply less cars with needed long
[4286.04s] term yeah you&#39;re overthinking number one
[4288.48s] that stuff takes longer than you expect
[4290.0s] and number two we&#39;re not going to be in
[4291.64s] this two or three years I mean maybe
[4293.4s] we&#39;ll be here 3 years from now but we&#39;re
[4295.08s] not going to be here 5 years from now
[4296.44s] it&#39;s probably going to take a lot longer
[4297.76s] than that to have any Dent assuming
[4300.44s] everything goes according to plan with
[4302.56s] autonomous and I&#39;m not convinced that
[4304.88s] it&#39;s going to be that many it&#39;ll be less
[4307.44s] cars but and and then you got to think
[4309.679s] about the global you&#39;re just getting
[4311.48s] caught up in the headline mix and that&#39;s
[4313.88s] not what we&#39;re focused on Tom admire
[4315.96s] your drive dedication and Priceless work
[4317.4s] you put in week after week thank you uh
[4319.52s] this is from Goran sto chit thank
[4322.8s] you uh would you agree that Intel is the
[4326.12s] least discussed totally ignored
[4327.44s] potential winner of deep seek induced AI
[4329.28s] terminal reason being that open source
[4331.08s] AI models are run locally on laptops and
[4333.52s] PCs which will speed up their adoption
[4335.0s] and proliferation until dominates that
[4336.719s] space powering N9 out of 10 best selling
[4339.32s] models across leading
[4341.36s] oems well I will say this uh the beauty
[4345.88s] of deep seek and Co is that they can be
[4348.48s] run on inferior chips and Intel is the
[4351.96s] leader in inferior chips so with that
[4355.36s] said I do think it&#39;s going to be a
[4357.32s] positive I also agree with part of your
[4359.32s] thesis on that but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re
[4361.159s] in the stock uh that is a benefiting
[4364.56s] Tailwind uh that will support our
[4366.639s] original thesis and uh we&#39;re on the
[4369.56s] exact same page with you and we love all
[4371.679s] the weakness and we continue to take
[4374.0s] advantage uh
[4376.04s] um okay Don L thoughts on
[4384.199s] MRX uh sold to you not interested let&#39;s
[4387.48s] see what it is shiny
[4390.4s] object Don welcome to the
[4396.52s] podcast I&#39;m assuming you are a new
[4398.88s] viewer and we are super happy to have
[4401.199s] you on board we always look there are
[4404.12s] many paths to the top of the mountain
[4406.52s] shiny objects are not one that we take
[4410.12s] but they are a way for other
[4413.4s] people to get to the top of the mountain
[4415.56s] if they should so
[4417.719s] choose we just like more predictability
[4420.36s] but let&#39;s just see what this does before
[4422.32s] we Financial Services platform Market
[4425.679s] access
[4427.96s] commodity now no thank you hard
[4431.84s] pass um Griffin Brown
[4435.96s] meeting the intelligent investor now
[4438.88s] have you ever read security analysis by
[4440.76s] Ben Graham yes multiple times do you
[4443.52s] recommend I read any that or any other
[4445.76s] book for financial statement analysis uh
[4447.6s] start with that and then just start
[4449.48s] reading a lot of read all the CFA books
[4453.0s] start reading a lot of annual
[4455.0s] reports and uh take it from
[4458.199s] there thank you for listening Jacob sax
[4463.36s] off do you think the Deep seek news
[4466.159s] could be the Catalyst for NVIDIA to
[4467.719s] experience the same as Nova
[4471.8s] Nordisk did where the stock start to
[4474.76s] Tumble uh I
[4478.12s] think I think
[4480.52s] I I think I intentionally am not playing
[4483.32s] in that space because that&#39;s a m that&#39;s
[4486.36s] a better than a coin flip
[4489.239s] risk Bill
[4493.12s] vaugh does there become a factor or
[4495.639s] systematic aspect of turnaround
[4497.04s] investing I know it&#39;s your framework to
[4499.679s] buy at the bottom when sentiment is at
[4502.0s] of trough but does this not increase
[4504.88s] your portfolio risk given these
[4508.719s] scenarios uh may be correlated with
[4511.44s] rates Capital Market strength this is
[4513.44s] why I&#39;ll never have any real
[4515.679s] competition is this is how most people
[4517.92s] think um I view view each business on a
[4521.199s] discreet basis I&#39;m cognizant of credit
[4524.12s] conditions because when we
[4525.76s] bought Cooper standard at
[4529.48s] $510
[4531.239s] um credit markets were closed so that is
[4535.4s] what creates the opportunity if you know
[4536.96s] what you&#39;re doing and you know what the
[4538.12s] asset coverage is and you do proper
[4539.56s] solvency risk so no and and the second
[4542.92s] answer to your question which is a good
[4544.679s] question Bill and thank you for sending
[4545.92s] it in is it&#39;s why you don&#39;t own one
[4549.36s] stock you know the the second question
[4552.639s] we always ask when we&#39;re getting into
[4554.44s] investment if this goes to zero if
[4556.159s] there&#39;s something I don&#39;t know that I
[4557.32s] don&#39;t
[4558.159s] know um will they take me out on a
[4560.44s] stretcher and the answer must be no so
[4563.56s] I&#39;m taking 8 to 12 discrete risks on the
[4568.32s] basis of Sumer turnarounds good portion
[4571.52s] of turnarounds but these are durable
[4574.28s] businesses that have operated through
[4575.56s] many cycles and uh there&#39;s some Catalyst
[4578.159s] in play so it depends on the sector the
[4582.679s] company the competition
[4585.48s] uh where they are in the cycle what has
[4587.48s] caused the downturn what is the bare
[4589.44s] thesis what are they seeing
[4591.8s] that we can adopt and still say that
[4596.36s] it&#39;s
[4597.44s] overshot uh and then starting the
[4600.0s] analysis from that framework uh but no
[4603.08s] there&#39;s you know everyone thinks there&#39;s
[4604.48s] going to be a cookie cutter magic
[4606.28s] formula that you know they can press a
[4608.52s] button and become Warren Buffett Warren
[4609.96s] Buffett became Warren Buffett over 60
[4611.44s] years of experience and he made a lot of
[4612.84s] mistakes in the beginning go read his
[4614.12s] early letters
[4615.88s] um and the only way you can get to that
[4618.719s] level uh and and or anywhere half as
[4622.28s] good as that level no one will ever be
[4623.52s] warn Buffett
[4625.56s] is through experience and that&#39;s the
[4628.76s] quick you know and you got to love the
[4630.6s] game because if you&#39;re doing this for
[4631.96s] money you will fail go run a business
[4634.52s] where you get paid for Massive Action
[4636.12s] and you&#39;ll make a fortune and then you
[4637.92s] give it to the handful of people in the
[4639.44s] world that can do a really good job
[4641.84s] buying these type of PE buying these
[4644.0s] type of businesses and buying them right
[4646.0s] and and having the ice in their veins
[4647.6s] and doing it with low leverage and all
[4649.44s] the conditions that are critical and and
[4651.239s] you&#39;re buying their experience you&#39;re
[4654.28s] buying Decades of their life for pennies
[4656.199s] on the dollar to do it for you while
[4657.639s] you&#39;re at the beach and that&#39;s what the
[4659.04s] smart people that do that invest with me
[4660.6s] do they&#39;re like ah you know I&#39;m a ctim
[4662.56s] millionaire I&#39;m a billionaire I&#39;m going
[4663.6s] to lay it off to Tom and let him worry
[4665.32s] about it all day and if he does well I
[4667.48s] give him more and if he does poorly I&#39;ll
[4668.96s] shut it off and the bottom line is we
[4670.76s] don&#39;t lose clients that&#39;s everything you
[4672.159s] need to know so um so so that&#39;s how I
[4675.32s] put it that way but good question on to
[4677.4s] the next Joe
[4682.52s] Cook
[4684.639s] hey TT turn around Tom great energy
[4688.08s] thank you I know you delay
[4691.52s] us uh I know you delay telling us
[4694.88s] non-clients when you get into Position
[4697.48s] will you be telling your non- clients we
[4699.8s] will not we look we discuss companies on
[4702.84s] a weekly basis that
[4705.44s] we think are
[4706.76s] interesting uh most of the time we own
[4709.679s] we we I mean I don&#39;t I would never
[4712.32s] listen to someone talking about a stock
[4713.96s] if they didn&#39;t have skin in the game
[4715.32s] like it&#39;s like someone trying to sell
[4716.88s] you an investment or a partnership it&#39;s
[4718.6s] like okay well how much do you have
[4719.76s] invested oh I have nothing but you
[4721.0s] should invest it&#39;s like okay salesman
[4722.639s] thank you very much on to the next um I
[4725.92s] will only listen to people who have skin
[4727.76s] in the game and then I got to make my
[4728.96s] own determinations if if they&#39;re correct
[4731.92s] um but uh number one this opinion not
[4735.04s] advice go to go to hedge fund tips.com
[4737.679s] terms um consult your financial adviser
[4741.48s] most of these are not appropriate for
[4742.719s] any of you you should be talking to your
[4744.0s] financial adviser we deal exclusively
[4746.12s] with accredited investors and qualified
[4748.28s] institutions qualified
[4750.56s] clients um for educational purposes Etc
[4754.6s] uh so we have no obligation to tell you
[4756.4s] when we&#39;re getting in when we&#39;re getting
[4757.6s] out that is for the benefit of our
[4758.96s] clients that is our sole responsibility
[4761.28s] as to our clients uh but we do uh let
[4764.239s] people know
[4765.28s] uh when we get out and um you know
[4768.719s] that&#39;s that but you know our average
[4770.92s] holding period is you know 12 to 48
[4773.32s] months so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking
[4774.76s] about a stock and selling it you know
[4776.719s] the next week we might be selling in two
[4778.88s] years or three years or four years we&#39;re
[4780.6s] just saying this is our framework and a
[4782.159s] lot of times we&#39;ll put out a a name that
[4783.84s] we&#39;ve got invested in and it goes down
[4785.719s] and we buy more you know so you know
[4787.44s] about it at a better price than we know
[4789.4s] about it but we average down and then we
[4791.0s] make a lot of money on the upside so
[4792.44s] it&#39;s you know it&#39;s that&#39;s the way it
[4794.28s] goes
[4795.96s] um Matt Del priori thanks for everything
[4799.36s] you do what are your thoughts on Sofi uh
[4802.04s] no not for me covered a million times I
[4804.88s] hope a lot of people make money on it on
[4807.0s] their own uh I&#39;ve never had
[4810.92s] success um investing in a company that
[4813.76s] was run by a former investment
[4815.8s] banker
[4817.719s] um I will say Anthony Noto might be the
[4820.92s] exception he&#39;s he seems like a super
[4823.32s] quality guy EX military veteran
[4826.52s] Etc uh but I&#39;m going to still stick with
[4829.52s] that rule uh we&#39;ll just leave it at that
[4832.8s] David mullinex uh love your work been
[4835.48s] watching you for a few months now what
[4837.08s] do you think of constellation Brands I
[4838.56s] know you like diio I think they&#39;ll all
[4840.36s] work but I think Diago&#39;s got a better
[4842.719s] look at premiumization which is the
[4844.639s] trend that&#39;s going to be able to weather
[4846.32s] any storms uh constellation doesn&#39;t have
[4849.84s] that moat but it&#39;s a pretty pretty good
[4851.96s] business and um will benefit from the
[4855.719s] same thesis same as brown Foreman but I
[4859.32s] like diio better here a lot better
[4863.44s] uh Cole as I would not buy constellation
[4866.44s] so that&#39;s that&#39;s my answer to you Cole
[4870.08s] fman uh is this pullback not the Y carry
[4872.84s] trade onwi all I see on my feeds are
[4875.12s] deep seek but now Bank of
[4877.239s] Japan uh raid hikes what do you think
[4880.32s] yeah you guys KN know that from
[4882.04s] listening to me for weeks that&#39;s part of
[4884.32s] it they both played a role but that was
[4886.719s] the one thing that no one was talking
[4888.679s] about Sebastian Penna thoughts on
[4892.82s] [Music]
[4899.04s] PCG uh and
[4901.48s] qxo qxo the problem with qxo is you&#39;re
[4904.52s] paying 2x the cash for a spack so you&#39;re
[4908.36s] basically
[4909.679s] given $6 for nothing
[4914.639s] other than Brad Jacobs multi-decade
[4917.32s] track record of creating billions of
[4918.76s] dollars of wealth for for his
[4920.159s] shareholders in multiple businesses so
[4923.679s] the problem with qxo Sebastian is if he
[4926.159s] screws up uh you&#39;re going to lose half
[4928.12s] your money and they&#39;re going to
[4929.0s] liquidate for six or seven bucks and and
[4931.52s] that&#39;s what it is that&#39;s a risk I&#39;m
[4933.04s] willing to take uh they won&#39;t take me
[4935.199s] out on a stretcher all the other
[4936.56s] positions are crushing it so uh but I
[4940.199s] think that&#39;s a very low probability
[4941.679s] because Brad Jacobs is not a quitter and
[4944.159s] he&#39;s going to get something done and
[4945.32s] he&#39;s going to get a platform and 10
[4946.76s] years out you&#39;re going to have an 8 to
[4948.32s] 10 bagger and a nice irr so
[4951.88s] um so that&#39;s that uh thoughts on
[4957.4s] PCG this is Harry this is California
[4960.56s] it&#39;s a
[4961.36s] turnaround uh we actually did ride this
[4964.44s] up we bought this in the hole during uh
[4967.88s] some years back
[4969.88s] and it&#39;s it wasn&#39;t a huge position and
[4974.04s] it it was it made a nice move but I
[4975.92s] think we sold out at like $16 or
[4978.32s] something it went went up to 21 now it&#39;s
[4980.08s] back to
[4981.04s] 16 uh this is California base I I&#39;m
[4984.719s] going to just be a pass on that I there
[4986.96s] are a lot of reasons why it could work
[4988.159s] which is why we got involved but it&#39;s
[4990.32s] not something I really want to do right
[4994.4s] now uh
[5000.96s] okay Patrick uh same same answer the
[5004.88s] previous question about other books and
[5006.239s] things to
[5011.04s] read and that&#39;s it we&#39;ll be back next
[5013.92s] week same time same place in the
[5015.639s] meantime make it a great one bye for now
