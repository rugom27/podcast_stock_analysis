**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautiously Optimistic, favoring value and international markets → 7/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆

- Underlying strength in value stocks and emerging markets.
- Unwinding of carry trade puts pressure on overvalued growth stocks.
- Macro data points to continued economic expansion, but with sector rotation.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a significant rotation from growth to value, driven by factors such as the unwinding of the carry trade, rising interest rates in Japan, and increased competition in the AI and semiconductor sectors. Emerging markets, particularly China, are poised for outperformance. Focus on durable businesses with strong fundamentals and avoid chasing overhyped stocks.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Bank of Japan Rate Hike | Raised interest rates to the highest level in 17 years | This is a key catalyst for the unwinding of the carry trade, putting pressure on overvalued US tech stocks that have benefited from cheap Japanese capital. "Pay attention to the carry trade unwind and watch the money flows." |
| Alibaba's Quen 2.5 Max AI Model | Outperforms DeepSeek and OpenAI | Alibaba is a major player in AI and is best in class. This is a game changer and Alibaba is the core beneficiary in the East. |
| US Dollar Weakness | Dollar post worst week in 14 months | Dollar peaked out in early January. This is positive for emerging markets and international equities. |
| Earnings Growth | S&P 500 earnings growth is 12.7% | Earnings are doing well, but guidance is softer. This is normal seasonally. |
