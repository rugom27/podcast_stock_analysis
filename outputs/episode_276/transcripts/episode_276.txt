welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 276th video cast podcast for the week ending January 30th 2025 as always we&#39;re going to start with family first then we&#39;ll get right down to business got a lot of incredible data to cover today although when everything&#39;s going right there&#39;s really not a lot to say uh as you know we like to spend time on the the names that are just leaving the station versus uh doing Victory laps for the ones that are soaring and uh candidly they&#39;re a lot more soaring today uh than just starting out of the gate which is pretty exciting to see and um and nicely coming for those of you who&#39;ve been listening for a while uh and reaped some significant benefits and uh certainly clients uh very very happy these days so excited for that uh this is Annabelle you want to speak of real accomplishment uh Annabelle was in Las Vegas this weekend for the Southern California swimming Allstar Festival she got first place in all six of her individual events and set five meet records in the 200 free 50 free 100 back 50 fly and 200 medal relay uh afterwards uh Caitlyn and Annabelle hit the town and took in the sights so that was Annabelle with the Las Vegas sign I stayed back to take Mimi to the daddy daughter dance at our club and that was just special trying to squeeze the last few uh bits of uh them being uh young daughters you know 12 were pushing up against the limits here for daddy daughter dances so I was excited to do that and get her to her activities here in Orange County uh this was this photo here and then uh there&#39;s some more of Annabelle I guess that&#39;s the Luxor wow uh this was amazing want to thank Brad s for hosting me at Mission Vio Country Club this week uh we it was called a monster pin scramble and we tied for fifth sixth and seventh all had net 74 we were ham and egging it all day long dropping some putts the the this is historically a course that is impossible to putt and then they put the pins in the most difficult possible places ever uh but we pulled through so uh so Kudos really hats off had an incredible time with Brad and um and the fact that we could compete and come in basically tied for fifth and then there were other uh fifth sixth and seventh was all the same score um that&#39;s more of Caitlyn with uh Annabelle in that&#39;s Paris in the background pretty cool stuff there&#39;s Annabelle doing some El this impersonations uh and this was interesting she took a picture randomly in front of the Chinese year of the snake so maybe um certainly I would say that podcast we did with Brendan Ahern uh of kweb last fall after I played golf at his awesome course in Connecticut um uh probably marked the bottom of uh Baba and uh you know now everyone&#39;s getting excited about it but the year of the snake and there she is randomly uh there are no accidents that&#39;s pretty cool and then a friend and client sent over this hat he made up called uh uh htrt turnaround Tom uh gosh did he already trademark that well now you know my clients all these CTI millionaires a couple billionaires and uh decamillionaires many times over they&#39;re uh they&#39;re ahead of the game on all of it but it says burden yourself with the fact # trt pretty cool stuff um okay by the way just uh as a last point I think last week I shared uh how embarrassing my golfing had been uh since moving out here after being on break well it&#39;s grooving now and um shot my best score ever in history uh Saturday which was an 80 even so I still have not breaking broken 80 but I really thought that was so far off the way I came out here and started playing it was it was disaster and um and I actually am starting to gain confidence that it&#39;s durable and I and I can hear all the golfers laughing in the background but um I got this device and you know again wait for the chuckles called the hack motion and I have no affiliation with the company and it just basically measures your flexion and extension at the top of the swing and an impact wrist angles and you basically for those of you who don&#39;t know golf you want to be more boded at Impact versus extended boded like this and it just does that and I&#39;ve been grooving that and it&#39;s it&#39;s been a complete Game Changer obviously I can putt now with my long putter that everyone laughs at uh putt pretty well and uh uh so now I think better out of the sand I think I got to work on some chipping but complete Game Changer so uh I thought it would be fluky it&#39;s not not feeling fluky at all uh because I continue to just grind in the data and I just look at flexion and intension when I&#39;m in flexion I just pure the ball and um so I&#39;m going to work on that and pretty excited cuz for those you&#39;ve been following you know my goal for 2024 was to get to a single digit handicap I failed but I didn&#39;t quit I almost quit the game seriously when I came out here after moving and not playing for four months I was embarrassingly bad it was like a you know a friend was out and I said to him I was like I was better two years ago when I was just starting and he&#39;s like yeah you were and uh and literally that day it&#39;s you know hack motion thing comes up on my Instagram I fall for it like a sucker and it actually works so there you go all right on to business uh here is want to thank uh Camille Smith Claire failen and Mary calie for having me on CBS to discuss the fed this week we&#39;re going to listen in here service meeting for the first time in 2025 economists and consumers alike are waiting to see if and when there will be more rate Cuts joining us now is Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital welcome thanks for having me Mary and president Trump has called for interest rates to drop immediately do you predict any shakeups or surprises or will it be business as usual I think the secret to happiness is low expectations and we can expect business as usual right now there&#39;s a 2.7% chance or expectations that there will be a cut for this meeting so very low expectations here I don&#39;t think that will change even if Trump wants uh Cuts immediately because number one they have to get more information tariffs and deportation could be short-term inflationary for prices the Doge Department of governmental efficiency could offset some of that but they can&#39;t make any decisions until they know what the landscape is going to look like how do you predict the central bank&#39;s relationship with the new Administration will be uh probably less Pleasant than uh we&#39;ve seen in recent history uh Trump wants rates lower he&#39;s going to continue to pound on that table and J Powell is going to continue to ride out his term to early next year and do exactly what he believes the data is telling him to do so expect a lot of push and pull there uh president Trump does believe he should have a say in rates uh the FED is an independent body so I think that will be the push pull moving forward and there&#39;s limitations on what can be done to really Force the fed&#39;s hand many are saying inflation concerns have eased but plenty of Americans still feeling the impact do you think the US will hit the 2% inflation Target this year or is it still Out Of Reach I think that is unlikely uh we do have debt to GDP a near record highs 120% going back all the way to post World War II and honestly the only way to solve for that is you have to run growth uh above Trend which means inflation is probably going to be in the 2 and 1/2 to 3 and a half% range for the foreseeable future that&#39;s going to help us bring down the debt to GDP ratio through growth and uh and the good news is wages are slowly catching up so it should be a push pull fast growth wages starting to catch up but inflation a little bit above Trend the FED lowered rates three times in 2024 what is your prediction for 2025 I think I&#39;m going to side with the FED here their summary of economic projections their Dot Plot indicates they want to get two cuts in in 2025 I think that&#39;s realistic expectations if you look at fed fund Futures where this stuff is gamed out you have a 30% cut chance of a cut in May in in May uh by June you go to 74% and by December you&#39;ve got a 90% chance of a cut and a 62% chance of two cuts by December I think it&#39;s going to be back half loaded I think we get two more Cuts Mary Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital thanks so much for joining us thanks for having me and we&#39;re back uh then quotes of the week you know this is an interesting quote and the reason I bring it up from John Templeton obviously is a legend markets are born on pessimism grow on skepticism mature on optimism and die on Euphoria the time of Maximum pessimism is the best time to buy and the time of Maximum optimism is the best time to sell and people often equate this and they always want to do things all or nothing and it always has to be a macro call but I can tell you across the board how many things right now feel like they match this meaning they are in maximum op optimism and the best time to sell and you saw some of that that we&#39;ve been warning you about for some time um and on the flip side there&#39;s a whole another 75% of the world and different sectors and companies which we&#39;re in that are starting to absolutely fly like nobody&#39;s business and I told you it was coming and by the way kudos to all the people that came in in q1 I mean these guys are smiling so wide they could eat a banana sideways as well as my existing clients are super duper unbel you know we&#39;re off to an great start and um for 2025 um also want to uh um it&#39;s pretty cool living out here because had a chance to meet one of those new new folks that came in want to uh to thank thank Brad k for meeting up in person and uh Tom B I&#39;m GNA go go meet you uh the interesting thing is you know we all live you know I live a a few blocks from the water I can see it I can walk from it these guys live right on the water they could stick their toes in the sand when they wake up which is pretty awesome uh so I&#39;m going to go down and see you and everyone else around the country grateful very exciting and this is what we&#39;ve been waiting for and this is what we&#39;ve laid the foundation for and it&#39;s not about predicting anything it&#39;s about using a durable sustainable uh framework that is repeatable over time and it&#39;s the kind of framework you know outperformance comes in clumps it doesn&#39;t come linearly uh it when it comes it comes all at once and here we are and kudos to those of you who took advantage of that message this quarter and um and I think we&#39;re just at the beginning of very very exciting and good things ahead so um the key to investing is not assessing how much an industry is going to affect society or how much it will grow but rather determining the competitive advantage of Any Given company and above all the durability of that Advantage this is the key thing this is Warren Buffett and what he&#39;s basically saying here is in English you&#39;re not going to make predicting the future and everyone that&#39;s what they do they spend their time trying to predict the future who&#39;s going to be the leader in AI chips who&#39;s going to be this and that and Buffett May became the wealthiest investor in history through buying durable companies that that work through Cycles when they were temporarily impaired regular everyday items you you don&#39;t need the hundred Baggers o you know over time because when you&#39;re reaching for the hundred Baggers you fall prey to Buffett&#39;s number one rule rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two is don&#39;t forget rule number one so yeah they write books about the lucky gamblers who get it right and make a thousand bagger on one lucky pick but I&#39;m telling you I&#39;ve been around long enough all of those people give it back to the casino sooner or later and um you know even many of the people who got the subprime crisis uh correct and everything else you know the follow-up acts are few and far between there are some but um you you want a maintainable durable it&#39;s a l it looks a little slower out of the gate but over the long term the the effects of compounding I mean one example that I&#39;ve shared with you guys many times but there are a lot of new viewers so I want to go into it is Charlie Munger bought this company called byd in 2009 and uh maybe I&#39;ll even pull it up by the way 10year yield is going down but uh b y d d y so basically he had the fundamentals right he bought in 2009 it shot up then it collapsed 90% they held on to it he could you know Buffett wasn&#39;t crazy about it but Monger was you know all Full Tilt on it and it did basically nothing from 2009 to 20120 so they were effectively flat they had a 90% draw down they had a SE call it 70% draw down a 60% draw down over that 10 years and it looks easy on this chart if you were living through that you&#39;d be like Oh I&#39;m wrong if you&#39;re early you&#39;re wrong blah blah blah and what wound up happening was when it comes it comes all at once when your analysis is correct it did a 10 bagger the next 12 months so basically in 13 years they had call it a 20 bagger and if you do the irr on that it works and and that&#39;s this is an extreme example you know but another one I&#39;ve shared with you guys was we bought uh range resources in 2018 uh at 11 down from 90 we estimated the fair value of proved and unproved was about $60 a share um they only report 10e pv10 which is like 20 and uh so we bought at 11 it immediately went to 18 we thought we were geniuses then Co came shot down to a buck 60 we loaded the boat the back of the truck like nobody&#39;s business brought our basis down to $410 and today it&#39;s 40 40 plus and probably going to 60 so um you know in the short term looked like a failure but when you know what you own and you&#39;ve done proper analysis um good things happen you know and um so this will probably wind up being a 15 bagger in 7 years so you know do the irrs on that uh but most people wouldn&#39;t have sat through it because they trade price they don&#39;t trade value they don&#39;t know how to analyze a business they don&#39;t have the experience and that&#39;s what we try to impart on these weekly podcasts so uh final quote is from Charlie Munger the world is full of foolish gamblers they will not do as well as the patient investors and we&#39;re going to find that over and over and over all the folks who are chasing the shiny objects got a little taste of what it is to be shellac this week uh they will continue to get reminders about that and um if [Music] you learn and follow a sensible framework uh and take the time and be patient uh and go through the process and get experience you will not fall for those traps uh that so many people and so many super intelligent people I mean these are not it&#39;s you know people always say oh the retail investor I&#39;m telling you billionaires who have built unbelievable businesses fall for the same traps that retail investors fall fall for it&#39;s just human nature to get sucked in the fomo I I always joke I didn&#39;t get the fomo gene it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s true and I encourage you to [Music] um just when when when you&#39;re buying a business because the price is going up and because it&#39;s in the news all the time what I want you to do is pull out the income statement the balance sheet the cash flow statement and analyze what you are getting in terms of free cash flow and if you had access to unlimited Capital JP Morgan was going to finance you for the whole business the only catch is you have to put up 100% % of your net worth alongside so let&#39;s say you&#39;re going to buy a100 billion business and you&#39;re worth $30 million you know um JP Morgan would put up the rest but you have to put up the full 30 million and if you&#39;re wrong and you&#39;re going to take the business private and you&#39;re going to live off the cash flow for the rest of your life if you&#39;re wrong you lose your full $30 million um JP Morgan will be debt they&#39;ll they&#39;ll take take over the business you&#39;ll get wiped out on your equity they&#39;ll liquidate the assets Etc if you wouldn&#39;t be willing to put 100% of your net worth to take the business private coupled by JP Morgan debt why are you buying it just because the quote unquote stock price is going up um the idea of buying any instrument on the basis of it&#39;s going to go up because more people are going to buy it versus it&#39;s going to go up because its intrinsic value is going to go up is a trap that will hurt you royally over time so that&#39;s kind of the the Crux of what we do here every week and I think a lot of you have caught on to the uh philosophy and uh and are are smiling a lot lately so uh this is something that no one else was paying attention to kind of a diversion everyone was focused on uh deep seek uh disrupting the Ari Market this week and it&#39;s certainly true that that&#39;s part of it uh but what they weren&#39;t wen&#39;t focused on was the fact that bank of Japan raised rates uh to their highest level in many years so they increased uh rates by 25 basis points and what this is as I&#39;ve been warning that very few people have been talking about that uh that don&#39;t listen to this podcast or follow me um is that a bigger risk to the Magnificent seven trade than overspending on chips without a return on investment or overvaluation or any of that is actually the unwind of the carry trade where people have been getting free money and they&#39;ve been parking it in the mag 7 in the US and benefiting from the currency differential and benefiting from uh basically free money is is uh what what it&#39;s been so as that money becomes less free uh what you&#39;re seeing is an unwind of the most crowded trade in the world probably in history and I think we&#39;re going to see more and more of that and it will be in fits and starts like they tried in August uh and they got shellacked and the uh Bank of Japan Governor had to walk it back uh this time they blamed it on deep seek which is certainly part of the the formula if you remember I was on vanney and I said Icarus is flying too close to the Sun uh the good news is his wings aren&#39;t melting yet and I was referring to Jensen Wong and I emphatically said but competition is coming you just wait you don&#39;t need to be much older than 4045 uh to understand how the semiconductor Cycle Works and the problem is is you have so many people managing money that uh haven&#39;t been through these cycles and don&#39;t realize that just like the glp 1&#39;s which we warned about which now has unbelievable competition from all different uh sides and the stocks have come off the boil uh certainly doing everything that they promis it&#39;s getting people skinny uh healthy for the time being a lot of health benefits but now there are tons of entrance so the pie is getting cut up same thing&#39;s going to happen with the chips same thing&#39;s going to happen with AI and um and we&#39;re seeing that over and over so uh speaking of competition in AI we had Alibaba come out and publish their data that showed that they outperform deep seek and open AI uh pretty much across the board so right now the quen 2.5 Max is probably the best AI the world has to offer and we&#39;ve been ahead of the curve on that for many many months telling you that there is an AI ETF in China with ticker Baba bab and part of that premise was yes they were developing their own internal stuff they&#39;re number one in Cloud uh they&#39;re going to get all the bulk of the uh compute demand and all the other things that were part of our initial premise uh furthermore they&#39;ve been giving tokens for compute power to pretty much every AI startup in China in exchange for Equity so beyond their own development you win so many different ways and and that&#39;s what&#39;s been so amazing about Alibaba but they&#39;ve actually it&#39;s not just coming from the startups that they have Equity investments in that we have as owners of Alibaba but it&#39;s coming from their own internal development and now as it stands and this is early days there&#39;s going to be a lot of competition but Alibaba is a major player and by the data they are Best in Class better than open AI better than deep seek on all of these metrics and I think probably going to continue to be better uh here&#39;s a lady who put out uh a a post and she specializes in AI goodbye chat GPT Alibaba just dropped quen 2.5 Max and the world is already blown away by it it its potential 13 wild examples so far don&#39;t miss the fifth one uh so she&#39;s comparing chat GPT to quen 2.5 and showing how it beats it in every single area artifacts like Claude it can code write text search the web comparison between quen video generation and Sora so you can see here uh the big difference it&#39;s day and night then quen 2.5 VL lets you create open AI operator like agent for computer and mobile phones uh three bouncing yellow balls within a sphere uh it can compete directly with open AI operator in computer use create videos quicker than other AI tools I mean look at the quality of these videos it&#39;s unbelievable upload files to analyze PDFs read images and extract insights instantly this is huge uh generate uncensored images uh this one if you&#39;re not watching it&#39;s a p picture of Donald Trump having coffee with Kamala uh which is definitely AI generated I have not seen that happen in real life I don&#39;t think we will be seeing that anytime soon uh quen 2.5 performs competitively with top models surpassing deep seek V3 in benchmarks like Arena hard live bench Live code bench and GP QA Diamond you can see the data here uh is out with its latest code artifacts the open source series is under Apache 2.0 and uses gradio 5 and custom components so we&#39;ve talked about in past podcasts moving from training the large language models which is the capital intensive to uh inference phase which is lower cost uh deep seek made a claim that what it costs uh some of the hyperscalers or uh you know billions to do they were able to do for five you know 100 billion they were able to do for 5 million or five you know a fraction of the cost uh it&#39;s a gamechanging competition is coming I think Alibaba is going to be the core beneficiary in the East uh and we&#39;ll see who&#39;s going to be in the west but this is mind-boggling and if you see in the US the number one download is deep seek so the Americans if it works like we&#39;re just Americans by and large are I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing you know with Tik Tok has been fantastic I I think it&#39;s a a wonderful tool um I always say if they&#39;re stealing my data what are they going to do call my mom I mean you know at the end of the day uh the tools are are working and they&#39;re and they&#39;re great and this is large this is partially a function of unintended consequences of knee-jerk policy when we decided rather than keep them dependent uh and coming back to us for all of their Tech needs we were going to sanction them and not give them the raw materials which they were going to find anyway and and we forced them you know necessity is the mother of invention we forced them to compete with us when they didn&#39;t want to and now uh they&#39;re eating our lunch so far so that&#39;s where it is and we&#39;ll see what happens but as owners of Alibaba we couldn&#39;t be happier so we&#39;ll leave it at that uh moving along here we have some data this is from Ryan Dietrich S&amp;P was up uh first five days of 2025 that&#39;s a general maximum in the markets going back to 1950 when that happens the average return is 14.2 versus the average year is 9.5 if the first five days is lower your average return is 1.1 uh so that bodess pretty well so he&#39;s looking for Mid double digits on the basis of that uh I&#39;m less sanguin but I&#39;m open-minded our money is going to be made under the surface I mean the the relative outperformance of what we&#39;ve seen just in the last handful of days is uh unprecedented relative to what how we&#39;re doing relative to the market and everything else it&#39;s just unreal so um Bank of America indicates us household Equity net worth up to 1.6 trillion here&#39;s the Bull and Bear indicator uh again not showing signs that you&#39;re at the level that you got to puke out everything and sell we&#39;re not at Euphoria yet so that&#39;s that lot of things to do Under the surface there there&#39;s a lot of things I wouldn&#39;t be buying by the way and you know what they are uh and if you by the way last week&#39;s was a lot longer this is going to be a lot shorter uh but that would be the one I would listen to if you just wanted to listen to one for the year and get the road map uh how we&#39;re thinking and that&#39;s already starting to play out that would be a very useful one to listen to you can find it on YouTube under hedge fund tips it&#39;s probably the January 23rd episode 275 Twin Peaks and treasury yield these are already coming down that&#39;s the 30-year yield we already showed you the 10-year yield it&#39;s backed off 30 basis points already um value beating growth so far in 2025 by a wide margin looks like about five or 6% um Twin Peaks in the US dollar looks like the dollar peaked out in early January all the things that we said were very similar and likely to recur from 2016 election to 2017 inauguration which is why we were so Ardent about if you&#39;re coming in come in now and many of you took us up on that and kudos to you um uh these things are playing so we said you know dollar would would uh it strengthened into after the election yields blew out after the election and then after the inauguration you start to see dollar back off yields back off we&#39;re seeing that and what&#39;s start starting to happen Emerging Markets are starting to outperform absolutely was on no one&#39;s bingo card except for the amazing loyal incredible listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes um four-year presidential cycle 1949 to 2000 Post elction year tends to be pretty good this is from Jeffrey hirs over at the stock Traders Almanac uh he puts out good stuff so this year is a generally a good year and we&#39;ve kind of outlined how we think about that midterm years tend to get a bit more choppy so we&#39;ll probably be harvesting a lot of profits early next year and uh creating powder for for huge opportunities going into the midterm election which we&#39;re excited about here&#39;s consumer staple stocks uh above the 200 day moving average this is kind of at an extreme here we like this exposure through the horels of the world through the dagios of the world through the things that have been beaten down uh of late I think they&#39;re going to start to perform uh no Twin Peaks in stocks okay uh cash bubble there&#39;s still 6.9 trillion in Money Market funds so as yields go down and stocks go up there&#39;s going to be more of a Chase just human nature uh what else we have here home prices near all-time highs relative to rents so you can see the last few times that you had this extreme of prices relative to rents prices came down I do think that&#39;s going to be the case uh you know I you know particularly in Orange County here here uh where we just bought a house and we we did a special situation I I found an incredible I got it at a discount to what the guy paid in 2019 because he was in a pinch that I I just love deals okay I told my wife you want me to sell the bottom in Connecticut and buy the top in Orange County are you out of your mind have you been watching what I do for a living for the last 25 years uh the reason we where we are is because I do the opposite of that for a living uh long story short I I found a great situation where my margin of safety is fully intact and then uh if so so what&#39;s going on in Orange county is very similar to what happened in Orange County in the 90s uh early 90s is you had a ton of Japanese hot money come in trying to get out of Japan just like you&#39;ve had a ton of Chinese hot money come in uh um uh in the last few years from China trying to get out of China and my thesis is generally that you&#39;re going to see as the Chinese economy recovers and stocks start to do well in China you&#39;re not going to see money go back because it&#39;s so hard to get money out of China but you&#39;re going to stop seeing it pour out uh of China so the marginal buyers in these markets are going to dry up and once that marginal buyer dries up you see prices drop Prett pretty pretty quickly so um so I do think there&#39;s optimism for for people looking to buy a house um to just uh probably be patient depending on the area you&#39;re in I I mean I think in in areas that took longer to recover from the great financial crisis like Connecticut I think that they&#39;re going to continue to go up uh which is why we rented out our houses in Connecticut because I didn&#39;t want to be a seller in the whole uh uh and um so so that&#39;s that but you got to pay attention to these extremes when they&#39;re as my stat friend likes to say and I&#39;m going to speak to these incredible students on Monday uh at a high school in Orange County shout out to them and to Cork who invited me he&#39;s a statistics teacher there and does an incredible job for his students and I&#39;ll go uh have a few words with them uh as they&#39;ve requested um so uh they understand a lot about statistics and I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll be asking me about some of these charts which is exciting uh here&#39;s the US dollar breaking down we&#39;d like to see that for your presidential cycle again from Jeff you can take a look at that uh high yield credit spreads are near record low so just keeping an eye on that credit markets are still great uh I think Cooper standard will use that window to refinance in the first half of this year that&#39;ll even bring interest costs down further and push out maturities even Beyond uh where they are so that&#39;s another positive thing they just need a positive quarter which they&#39;re likely to get from the volumes last month and uh and they&#39;ll be Off to the Races how much Americans drink so people have been saying every no one&#39;s drinking anymore it runs in Cycles number one and number two we&#39;ve seen these type of Peaks and troughs before as a matter of fact drinking per capita was much lower in the late 90s than it is today uh so this little short-term blip is probably nothing more than that which is why we like the highest quality businesses in the most dislocated sectors it&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done it&#39;s why we bought Exxon in the 30s uh when uh during covid and Wells Fargo at $25 and uh same thing with the alcohol companies with di AIO Etc it&#39;s the same exact trade it&#39;s it&#39;s maximum pessimism it&#39;s exactly what Templeton was talking about you don&#39;t need to just apply it to the markets and just say oh because one or two stocks are or seven stocks are super overvalued therefore everything&#39;s overvalued look under the surface there are things that are so pessimistic that are bull market opportunities and there are things that are too optimistic that are bare Market opportunities and you you just have to learn how to distinguish that over time um okay we&#39;ve got what else do we have here uh earnings are doing well we&#39;ll cover that at the end I think 12.7% earnings growth was above 9% expectations so that&#39;s good we&#39;re in the seasonal time of year where guidance is softer uh that has been the case they took down earnings from 275 to 272 so you have to keep your eye on that this is just another way of looking at the mid midterm this year tends to be strong uh midterms tend to be a little choppier so we&#39;ll be harvesting profits probably early next year and uh probably a lot more than we anticipate which is going to be exciting and um uh and then we&#39;ll put that dry powder to work in the hole when everyone else is puking at at the bottom uh consensus expects 10% earnings growth we did that companies have expressed optimism at record high so you see some mixed here&#39;s the uh guidance seasonality here this is interesting one quarter of S&amp;P 500 companies are expected to outpace the Magnificent 7 in two second half 2025 up from just 8% at the lows in second half 2023 so you&#39;re starting to see that re Brading that you see and uh and that&#39;s looking very healthy for the market the earnings growth we&#39;ve covered a million times mag 7 earnings are decelerating their multiples have not contracted yet but they&#39;re sted to uh and the rest of the market UNM magnificent 493 multiples are accelerating but their multiples have not expanded yet they will rate mag 7 multiples will derate UNM magnificent 493 multiples will rate higher um the backers of the World when they finish the sale uh and the slow growing business uh is sold that multiple will rate from 12 to probably 16 17 they&#39;ll take their n interest expense down uh all those good things Tech materials and communication services are expected to drive best margin expansion in 20125 you still can&#39;t give away materials we&#39;ve been scooping it up like crazy uh album marals of the world Etc today was the best performance in consumer staples relative to technology since 2002 again pointing back to all the conditions that we said are prime for an outperformance dramatically of value versus growth small cap versus large emerg markets versus develop markets everything that people can&#39;t give away we are taking advantage of and it&#39;s starting to play out uh total net call volume buying all the mag seven at the top getting smoked um rig counts coming down China industrial profits going up us manufacturing PMI turning up we&#39;re coming out of the manufacturing depression how are you taking advantage of that we know our plays uh breath expansion awaits macro conf confirmation from the ISM Manufacturing PMI which all the data is pointing back up we&#39;ve been covering that for weeks percentage of S&amp;P members above their 50-day M moving average you&#39;re seeing this breath really start to turn around since the inauguration as we had anticipated here&#39;s a look at nvidia&#39;s massive earnings rise and analyst forecast for continued strength are these forecasts to upbeat so they&#39;re basically saying that two years out it will be from earnings obscurity to the largest company in the world in two years and and never stopping so 200 billion so they think it&#39;s going to be half they basically think this company is going to be half of US GDP so uh I wouldn&#39;t bet on it ladies and gentlemen and um the wings are beginning to melt that&#39;s all I can tell you uh Equity risk premium people view this as a negative I view it as a positive why because this is concentrated and impacted dramatically by the mag 7 same thing that happened in 2001 which led to a period of dramatic outperformance of what small caps International value uh all the things that we are loaded into and taking advantage of prime book magnificent 7 completely overweight they&#39;ve been puking out of it while the retailers have been buying retail investors have been buying it uh we&#39;re seeing how that ends and then we get a lot of these dip buyers that aren&#39;t going to understand how a bare Market Works in certain stocks that are going to keep buying the dips and keep getting burned uh views of Lula turn negative when momo stocks break they don&#39;t recover quickly um that&#39;s that&#39;s all I can tell you from years of experience um views of Lula turn negative Brazilians worry on taxes and economy this is very positive if Lula gets dumped Brazil is going to be a monster of opportunity and we will start to take advantage of it now that China&#39;s working so well uh Dallas fed manufacturing this is what we were talking about coming out of the manufacturing depression um yeah so this is deep seek numbers but a day later Alibaba came out with quen and smoked all these numbers so that&#39;s all you need to know there uh Bank of Japan raises interest rates we cover this to the highest in 17 years so when people are talking about deep seek deep seek definitely has something to do with it uh but also pay attention to the carry trade onwi and uh watch the money flows and you&#39;ll understand why these High Flyers are are starting to get gut punched uh Japan CPI this is turning up and you know you have to consider Japan has no natural resources that&#39;s that&#39;s why it&#39;s always been a train wreck and their birth rate is is a train wreck but um so so they&#39;ve got all the input costs they&#39;ve got no way to do it uh they&#39;ve been priming the pump inflation is going up they&#39;re going to have to continue to raise which is going to continue to unwind the carry trade and you&#39;re going to watch what happens over the next 6 to 12 to 18 months similar things that happened in the periods that we&#39;ve discussed every single week and you&#39;re seeing seeing play out in real time here&#39;s the Japanese 2-year government bond yield going par parabolic basically here here is the Chinese Yuan starting to strengthen this was a key condition we talked about for Chinese equities to start to take off we&#39;re seeing it all fall into place yuan&#39;s best week in two years while we had the US Dollar&#39;s worst week in many years healthc care remember we talked about it on Fox coming into the new year we said no one wants materials no one wants healthc care these are the top performers they&#39;re kicking butt in the first month of the year uh broad deflationary impact is in attacked so inflation&#39;s under control that should give fed cover to do the final one or two cuts probably back half of the Year number percentage of companies outperforming the S&amp;P 500 since 1990 haven&#39;t seen this again going back to that 2000 period when all the things we talked about took off uh steel came out and increased their price Target to $35 on VF Corp as we always say opinion follows Trend and sure enough uh Brack and Daryl shot the lights out and uh the analysts have to follow so they&#39;ve all been conservative the same thing you&#39;ll start to see happen with Baba same thing happens over and over vernado uh what whatever it happens to be we we keep seeing this over and over and over 10-year government bond yield coming down quite a bit uh let&#39;s see here Japanese Yen starting to strengthen carry trade starting to unwind again expectations for global economic boom highest since April 2022 uh you also had that early in Trump&#39;s term in 17 and that was a good thing so that&#39;s not necessarily bearish you had it in 201 uh so that&#39;s kind of a mixed indicator current combination of macro conditions has historically been supportive of risk assets uh so what you see here is after the first cut if there&#39;s no recession Equity markets tend to do very well in the coming years we agree here&#39;s a post from a guy named Jeff weninger this Market&#39;s leadership is on tender hooks uh so what he&#39;s basically showing is that when you have a one-day change S&amp;P 500 equal weighted index minus the S&amp;P 500 when it gets this extreme that tends to be the bottom in the equal weighted basket and then sure enough equal weight starts to outperform uh Market weight here&#39;s an example post of opinion follows Trend you know these are same type of people who wanted nothing to do with Alibaba at $58 when we were pounding the table nothing to do with it at 62 nothing to do with it at 80 now it&#39;s at 103 and they&#39;re all saying uh getting prepared for a blast off sometime in 2025 so you know they missed the first 80% but you know other than that how was the play Mrs Lincoln so let&#39;s move on here um why some Magnificent Seven companies could be earning Less in 2050 than today and in this chart you&#39;ll see the top 10 US companies in q1 of 2000 trailing 12-month Gap net income track through 2025 rebased to 100 as of q1 2000 Legend ordered high to low in terms of growth since 2000 and basically what you&#39;re seeing here is the companies that were the Magnificent set in 2000 uh significant portion of them ear are earning less today than they did at their Peak 25 years ago uh four of the top 10 earners of the S&amp;P 500 at the turn of the century currently earn less than nominal earnings than they did in 2000 according to a review by Jim Reed at Deutsche Bank uh those four companies were pegged as IBM City Group GE and Intel while Microsoft earnings were are uh 10 times what they were in 2000 uh if it is possible that a couple of the mag 7 earn Less in 2050 than they do today even if the index is significantly higher read ask history would say yes it is I would Bank on 50% of the mag 7 will be earning Less in 2050 than they are today in nominal terms I can I can almost guarantee that I would make that bet it it if you&#39;re a sside banker and you want to sell me a swap on that I I&#39;ll I&#39;ll load up the truck so call me baby you can put your six points embedded in it we&#39;ll be we&#39;ll be happy to do business Trump would rather not put tariffs on China maintains threat um Japan core inflation climbs to a 16-month high boosting case for rate hikes Yuan gains As Trump dials back tariff threats Trump says he&#39;ll demand interest rates drop urges OPEC to cut oil prices in davo speech Trump says he knows interest rates better than fed Chief Powell so there will be a push pull there he&#39;ll get one or two cuts out of him but Powell&#39;s like hey uh Legacy baby I&#39;m riding this baby out until early next year when I when I step down on my own terms uh we&#39;ll see you know never never count Trump out if he wants something he&#39;s going to get it uh Beijing tells insurers to buy more Chinese stocks China&#39;s new rules add $138 billion into the market Japan raises interest rates to highest level since 2008 that is a carry trade on wine ladies and gentlemen this is was the last carry trade on unwind so pay attention Burberry sees positive signs as turnaround plan continues I think a lot of these luxury brands are going to start to see their day now that China&#39;s back uh whe you know that also includes Nike but certainly Canada Goose uh Vans is already seeing U VF Corp is already seeing it in Spades um and we&#39;ll see many more to come Beijing tells insurers to buy more Chinese stocks us Bond stocks at most expensive relative to Bond since.com error these are all the things that we keep talking about this is equity risk premium and they keep talking about it as stocks it&#39;s the mag 7 pushing so what&#39;s going to get hurt is what&#39;s pushing it I mean Buffett had monster returns in 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 when everyone else was getting smoked CU while everyone was buying Global Crossing and Enron and uh Cisco he was buying you know Coca-Cola and boring stocks that no one wanted and he just dramatically outperformed he was ahead of the curb he skated to where the puck was going not where it was while they were writing articles about him wondering if quote unquote Buffett has lost his touch he was getting wealthier and wealthier dollar post worse week in 14 months is tariff versus side diio weighs options for Guinness in portfolio review they&#39;re selling the African division which is good they&#39;re taking some actions calling some stuff uh we covered that one in one of the recent weekly articles will the Chinese consumer finally start spending uh good question my answer is probably different than Bloomberg&#39;s midcap stocks have been in the shadows why 2025 could be there year we were talking about that all fourth quarter you guys are already positioned for it dollar uh Falls after Donald Trump hints at softer stance on China tariffs uh so 60% on day one was uh not in the cards we&#39;ll see how it goes investors bet Trump will make Europe investable again we&#39;ve seen the biggest inflows into European stocks starting to perform International is going to perform we&#39;ve got some exposure in Europe through gxo as our big play we think that&#39;s going to be a home run pboc injects record liquidity via new tool as Yuan limits easing China stock set for $236 billion influx from state-owned investors that&#39;s from UBS China&#39;s great coupon handout for from far from enough to Spur consumption so this is a this is a journalist who is just looking at one off what they&#39;re neglecting to take into account is the fact that these one-offs have been going on for 12 months and they&#39;re all starting to collect and the beach ball is getting ready or and it&#39;s starting to explode out of the water it&#39;s been held underneath the water for too long and now it&#39;s Off to the Races Nvidia slashes nearly 600 billion in market value uh what&#39;s what&#39;s driving the Panic okay Estee louder reviews Brands amid management change Beauty group is working with evercore to uh review portfolio looking to improve performance under new CEO look all you need to know from this article is very simple the louder family owns 38% of Este louder&#39;s total common stock and about 86% of the voting power they are going to get this right if you remember Walmart had periods like this and the Walmart family stepped in got a new CEO made changes invested in online massively the market said oh they&#39;re they&#39;re crazy they&#39;re blowing all their profits and now uh they&#39;ve been dominating same exact thing is going to happen with s louder they&#39;ve been through this in the past they sell Brands they buy Brands same as VF Corp they&#39;ve been trading brands for over a hundred years they know how to how to how to do it Young Americans are drinking less but can it last and we kind of covered that with the other chart the answer is uh no uh people are going to drink and uh uh it it goes in cycles and here even so they&#39;re picking up some some market share with these low and no alcohol uh beverage markets look all that&#39;s good thing but in the scheme of History the way these quality stocks are priced relative to the reality of the uh shortterm softness in the underlying business is such a big Divergence that&#39;s how you make money you know if if a stock is down 50 60 70% and it&#39;s the best in class and the overall industry is down two 2 and a half% uh that&#39;s an opportunity because even if the pi gets smaller it&#39;s just going to put the strongest player in a position to cobble up more of the competition and take advantage so even if the pi went 75% smaller and the number one player controls 100% of the you know 95% of the market uh that&#39;s a win that&#39;s not going to be the case here but it&#39;s just a way to think about it another mental model to keep in the back of your head Beijing unveil 7.2 billion injection of insur capital for stocks AI fueled stock rally deal dealt $1 trillion doll Blow by Chinese upstart also a lot of Japanese carry trade has to do Chinese boost index Investments and latest bid to revive markets building products distributor qxo launches hostile bid for Beacon this is not Brad Jacobs Mo to do hostile he&#39;s very Cooperative uh kind of acquirer and activist he is paying up for Beacon I don&#39;t like that but he sees something that I don&#39;t see and I&#39;m going to trust his judgment based on the fact that he&#39;s built a handful of multi-billion dollar companies from scratch and made shareholders billions upon billions of dollars over many decades whether United Rentals whether um XPO whether Waste Connections uh you name it he&#39;s done it he knows how to do it and he just needs to get in the game so he&#39;ll wind up having to pay more I think he&#39;s going to get this done I wouldn&#39;t lose sleep if he didn&#39;t I know the market will be disappointed in the short term and we can build a bigger position but um I think he&#39;ll get it done I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll get an enormous pop because he&#39;s going to overpay for it but he&#39;s talking about the benefit of what he&#39;s always done in his rollups is he&#39;s brought technology into boring industries that he can buy at a reasonable price and then he he rolls up a fragmented industry so he&#39;s paying up for this public platform uh and then he&#39;ll roll up a ton of fragmented private businesses at much lower multiples so we&#39;ll get it back he just needs a platform to play and uh and uh I have I have full confidence but you know this is this is uh uncharacteristic but probably necessary at this point and my guess is they&#39;ve got two or three other options if this one doesn&#39;t work out for some reason uh Boeing&#39;s Rosie Outlook negates the need for fire sale don&#39;t know what that is where do we oh us manufacturers show signs of recovery from 2-year slump GM stock Falls as carmaker signals that tariffs may impact his Outlook uh yeah and it&#39;s and it&#39;s completely unknown but their numbers were better than expected their units are better than expected and I think that is going to continue you cannot invest on the basis of what may or may not happen in terms of policy it&#39;s going to take you out of too many stocks at the end of the day if the worst case happens with tariffs people are still going to need cars with the average car on the road being 13.5 years rates are still go short rates are still trending down which helps the consumer the difference is going to be like houses not everyone needs a 6,000 ft starter home so they&#39;re building a lot more 2,500 foot homes and more and more people are moving from Big SUVs to uh more affordable sedans and I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to see and units are going to go up they just might be smaller units but it doesn&#39;t matter from a Cooper standard perspective it does matter from a margin perspective for GM it does not matter from a margin perspective for Cooper standard billionaire Castell to acquire Diago&#39;s unit and expand in Ghana so he will get Ghana Guinness uh Boeing CEO don&#39;t expect a major restructuring possibly a pruning so he&#39;s showing signs of confidence uh also says company reaching 737 key Milestone this year uh Alibaba T&#39;s new AI model as it says rival deep seek open Ai and meta&#39;s top offerings it doesn&#39;t just rival it exceeds according to the data 10-year treasury yield slides after weaker than expected GDP Baba launches new AI model that outperforms de seek blah blah blah Intel&#39;s fourth quarter sales beat estimates during turnaround there&#39;s nothing to do with this story until they announce a new CEO or we figure out if they&#39;re in play but uh I think the next catalyst is a new CEO nice to see that they did a little better than expected uh shows progress in the face of another decline look number one co- CEOs never work number two uh you just need to get a new big name in there and uh and the game will be on it&#39;s uh planes and parkus stock market and sentiment results so we covered a lot of this uh what I want to cover uh oh this was interesting Canada Goose got the green light from the Ontario Securities Commission to buy back up to 10% of its public public float doubling its us share repurchase capacity in other words our slice of p is about to get 10% bigger without putting up any additional Capital which is exciting that&#39;s why the stock is starting to move and I&#39;m sure they wouldn&#39;t be in the market buying a ton of stock if sales were going to be weak if in case you haven&#39;t noticed it&#39;s been a cold winter uh and Asia is back so I would expect uh better numbers than one would anticipate moving forward in which case uh the BuyBacks will be very meaningful uh Boeing update so what I&#39;d rather do you can read through the article of the week if you haven&#39;t already we&#39;re going to listen to the CEO himself Kelly ortberg on CNBC right after earnings Boeing as well company reporting its biggest annual loss since 2020 and our Phil leau is here this morning with the CEO hey Phil hey Carl Kelly oror thank you for joining us uh this morning uh look we know what 2024 was and you do that going into this job um as you look at 2025 I can tell that you see some some reasons for optimism here yeah I really do despite the challenging fourth quarter uh we are making some some significant progress you know we had a great Capital rise so the balance sheet is solid uh for the next year and we&#39;re starting to see really good progress as we ramp production back up on the 737 and the max production rate is is critically important to the recovery of the program of the company are you seeing what you need need to see so far to say yeah I like where we&#39;re headed in terms of getting ultimately to 38 per month at some point this year yeah we&#39;re actually a little ahead of where I expected you know we coming out of the strike uh we slowed down intentionally uh rebalance the production line and I think that&#39;s paying big dividends for us right now we&#39;ll probably deliver in the upper 30s uh on produ on 737 Maxes in January now we had a lot of airplanes in inventory so we&#39;re flushing through that that inventory but so far so good and what I look at is is less about the deliveries and more about the key performance indicators that the FAA is using to determine whether we&#39;re able to move Beyond 38 a month and those indicators are looking good and we&#39;re going to stay focused on making sure we&#39;re discipline as we build uh these airplanes and ramp back up all of this is happening as we have a new president in office two questions here one have you talked with President Trump and two Elon Musk and doge is one of his big plants and driving greater efficiency I know you&#39;ve talked with Elon Musk you&#39;ve had him down to your facility where you&#39;re building the new Air Force One what&#39;s your perspective in terms of what president Trump will do during his administration well first of all I mean he&#39;s keenly focused on American jobs and he knows that the aviation industry is is critically important to American jobs and we build these airplanes in the US and we export them throughout the throughout the world so I think the administration is going to be very supportive of not just Boeing but the overall uh Aerospace industry and yeah we&#39;ve been engaged with with Elon on looking particularly at the vc25b program at looking at that program and seeing are there areas that we can make changes to that program eliminate cost eliminate schedule uh the the uh president wants the airplane sooner and so we&#39;re working with Elon and their team to figure out what can we do to pull up the schedule of that aircraft have the interactions so far been what you would call Construction oh yeah absolutely I mean they sincerely are looking at at things that are in the contract or in the process that are slowing us down that aren&#39;t providing value and we&#39;re engaging with the with the Doge team to see if we can&#39;t find that right uh mix of of of requirements that need to come out and get out of our way so that we can be more efficient and deliver a better product Kelly Jim&#39;s got a question for you Jim go ahead thank you Phil Kelly thank you for coming on I&#39;m wondering why this uh the second half is when things get better I would expect that the second quarter is the reason I mentioned that is because I don&#39;t want people to buy the stock knowing the second quarter is awful I mean how do we know that that things are going to get better in the third quarter if the second quarter is not good well Jim we haven&#39;t we haven&#39;t forecast a a bad second quarter what we&#39;ve said is that the first half will be a usage of cash and then we&#39;ll do we&#39;ll turn to a a cash positive in the second half of the year but it&#39;s all determinant on the the uh 737 Max production rates and I&#39;m not going to put a date on when we need to get to rate 38 and get approval for the FAA to go beyond it&#39;s more important that we do this right we have a stable production system we get through that and I expect by the second half of the year we&#39;ll have that approval and we&#39;ll be moving to a higher production rate so that&#39;s really what&#39;s driving the first half second half profile uh you got the uh labor agreement I know your hands on now looks like that you&#39;ve got a lot of good people people uh how many can you do Max how many not the max but how many can you make per month because I&#39;m trying to figure out how to model what the second half could be well uh we&#39;re planning to be at about 38 a month for uh the balance of of this year ramping up um to and we&#39;ll go in five step increments every six months uh after that so that gives you a feel for how to uh how to model the the rate increases on 787 where at 5 a month uh rate moving to 7 a month rate and we&#39;ll do that uh when our performance indicators say uh the production system is stable and hopefully that&#39;s in the next quarter or so Kelly when you look at your defense and space portfolio look it&#39;s been a mess you continue to lose money with some of these programs especially the fixed price programs contracts that have just not been they&#39;ve not been good contracts have you talked with the incoming or the new defense secretary I I guess and and do you expect that to change in terms of how these contracts are Bid out because clearly it has not worked over the last several years well uh so first of all I haven&#39;t spoke to the newc def but I certainly hope to um as he just you know was just confirmed um I I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re going to change our approach to uh these programs as you know we&#39;ve learned a lot about these fixed price development programs and we&#39;re just not going to enter into the wrong contracts fixed price has its place uh but it isn&#39;t in uh high-risk development areas I think Cost Plus is more appropriate I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to significantly change but you know we&#39;ll work with the administration as they look at what they want to do for Contracting going forward you have some divisions that you are currently considering or or have said look we will take some bids on some of our uh divisions or businesses subsidiaries how many of those do you expect those transactions to take place this year well uh a few um you know we&#39;ve got couple a couple in ADV Advanced stages that we&#39;re looking at um you know I&#39;m through my portfolio review uh don&#39;t think of this as major structural redesign of the of the corporation but I do think there&#39;s places that we can streamline and so we&#39;ll be actioning those uh here in the next uh six months to a year uh when might we expect you to name a new president CEO of space and defense is that a first half uh higher or do you think it may take a little longer you know I don&#39;t have a fixed time on that Phil uh you know it depends on the the um availability of the right person to to lead that and and um I&#39;ve got an interim CEO is&#39;s doing a great job right now so I&#39;m not in a hurry to make a bad decision uh we&#39;ll we&#39;ll uh take that when when the time&#39;s right and we&#39;re back and then we had uh VF Corp and Brack and Daryl did an incredible job uh you can go through these key points on your own I think his interview on CNBC after earnings told the whole story and you know I was pretty optimistic kind of thinking that this is a story that could easily go to $40 $50 if you remember listen Liz this is going to be incredible turnar around and she&#39;s like she looked at me like I had three heads she&#39;s like John what do you think you know kind of like this kid is crazy and uh and sure enough it&#39;s a a double now and probably a lot more so I figured it would be a triple but listening to him and kind of his long-term mindset uh as these numbers continue to improve and the free cash flow continues to improve he&#39;s going to be buying in stock I think this is going to be a lot more than that and we&#39;ll just see how the fundamentals go take that when when the time&#39;s right but um there you go congratulations on hanging in guys you deserve it and uh just the beginning so on to the next sentiment is neutral managers are starting to get some more exposure re earnings top 30 weights are up 17 bips utilities top 30 weights revisions up 40 bips in the last 60 days and on uh here is the earnings growth rate with 16% of the S&amp;P reported is 12.7% that&#39;s exceeding estimates by about 3.7% uh so that&#39;s positive guidance though has come in a little bit which is normal seasonally so we&#39;ll keep an eye on that uh so with that said we&#39;re going to move on to the ask me anything questions if you like the ask me anything questions hang out with us for a little bit if you don&#39;t thanks for tuning in this week we&#39;ll be back next week um so here&#39;s the first question from JP hi Tom thank you for all that you share you create more value than you will ever know what is your opinion on UPS I like that they&#39;re getting rid of less profitable work focus on higher margin reminds me of PayPal Ah that&#39;s a good question I kind of started to sniff that one out but I continue to think it&#39;s a little bit early you don&#39;t fire Amazon and um get away with it right away uh that&#39;s all I can say I think that this one is a wait and see I you know I&#39;d probably put an alert below a 100 bucks if it breaks a 100 bucks I&#39;m going to start to look at it aggressively but right here I think it&#39;s in flux uh Michael I see a lot more Amazon trucks than I do UPS trucks that&#39;s for damn sure uh Michael Oak o oer Oar uh Tom thank you for your weekly lessons could you lay your thoughts on Cole&#39;s Corporation will the new CEO from Walmart Ashley Buchanan redefine back to middle class Shoppers currently closing unproductive stores and cutting Workforce probably cut dividend is that debt B burden untenable thanks uh We&#39;ve looked at this one a few times and we&#39;ve continued to say no uh I think that&#39;s going to be the theme I will say driving around the other day I saw that they had these stores that were Kohl&#39;s plus Sephora and Sephora is on fire so that might get more feet into the door of younger people uh the store and the store concept never worked uh just see JC Penny but I I just can&#39;t get excited about this one so I&#39;m going to pass you know the retailing business is very very hard unless you&#39;re specialized like in Advanced Auto Parts and it&#39;s still hard um I think you&#39;re Pro I think this is a good trade I think it&#39;s going to be a long-term slog I just don&#39;t like the business I mean the Kmarts of the world it&#39;s very very tough to turn around that model um I&#39;d be more inclined to look at Target at these levels but uh I&#39;m not okay Patrick bunzel is asking about NE I don&#39;t know what NEP is oh next are our Energy Partners uh this is probably a don&#39;t touch what is xplr explore resources I neither of these are for me but thank you for tuning in uh David Pang hey Tom been listening for about a year I&#39;ve come to really enjoy your insights if you&#39;re ever in Columbus love to meet and be become a client okay uh oh here&#39;s the am okay metap fast uh no we&#39;ve covered that no thank you hard pass um thanks for the question and um yeah love to meet in person or when you&#39;re in New York or Orange County uh look me up Tom thank you for all that you share you create we did this don&#39;t resend questions guys all right Sam G love all the work you do for us thank you regarding CPS why to get your take on the impact of autonomous Robo taxi to earnings valuation over the next two to five years seems like autonomous Robo taxi is getting a lot more attention or hype whether it&#39;s warranted or not wonder if it&#39;s impacting multiples logic would imply less cars with needed long term yeah you&#39;re overthinking number one that stuff takes longer than you expect and number two we&#39;re not going to be in this two or three years I mean maybe we&#39;ll be here 3 years from now but we&#39;re not going to be here 5 years from now it&#39;s probably going to take a lot longer than that to have any Dent assuming everything goes according to plan with autonomous and I&#39;m not convinced that it&#39;s going to be that many it&#39;ll be less cars but and and then you got to think about the global you&#39;re just getting caught up in the headline mix and that&#39;s not what we&#39;re focused on Tom admire your drive dedication and Priceless work you put in week after week thank you uh this is from Goran sto chit thank you uh would you agree that Intel is the least discussed totally ignored potential winner of deep seek induced AI terminal reason being that open source AI models are run locally on laptops and PCs which will speed up their adoption and proliferation until dominates that space powering N9 out of 10 best selling models across leading oems well I will say this uh the beauty of deep seek and Co is that they can be run on inferior chips and Intel is the leader in inferior chips so with that said I do think it&#39;s going to be a positive I also agree with part of your thesis on that but that&#39;s not why we&#39;re in the stock uh that is a benefiting Tailwind uh that will support our original thesis and uh we&#39;re on the exact same page with you and we love all the weakness and we continue to take advantage uh um okay Don L thoughts on MRX uh sold to you not interested let&#39;s see what it is shiny object Don welcome to the podcast I&#39;m assuming you are a new viewer and we are super happy to have you on board we always look there are many paths to the top of the mountain shiny objects are not one that we take but they are a way for other people to get to the top of the mountain if they should so choose we just like more predictability but let&#39;s just see what this does before we Financial Services platform Market access commodity now no thank you hard pass um Griffin Brown meeting the intelligent investor now have you ever read security analysis by Ben Graham yes multiple times do you recommend I read any that or any other book for financial statement analysis uh start with that and then just start reading a lot of read all the CFA books start reading a lot of annual reports and uh take it from there thank you for listening Jacob sax off do you think the Deep seek news could be the Catalyst for NVIDIA to experience the same as Nova Nordisk did where the stock start to Tumble uh I think I think I I think I intentionally am not playing in that space because that&#39;s a m that&#39;s a better than a coin flip risk Bill vaugh does there become a factor or systematic aspect of turnaround investing I know it&#39;s your framework to buy at the bottom when sentiment is at of trough but does this not increase your portfolio risk given these scenarios uh may be correlated with rates Capital Market strength this is why I&#39;ll never have any real competition is this is how most people think um I view view each business on a discreet basis I&#39;m cognizant of credit conditions because when we bought Cooper standard at $510 um credit markets were closed so that is what creates the opportunity if you know what you&#39;re doing and you know what the asset coverage is and you do proper solvency risk so no and and the second answer to your question which is a good question Bill and thank you for sending it in is it&#39;s why you don&#39;t own one stock you know the the second question we always ask when we&#39;re getting into investment if this goes to zero if there&#39;s something I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t know um will they take me out on a stretcher and the answer must be no so I&#39;m taking 8 to 12 discrete risks on the basis of Sumer turnarounds good portion of turnarounds but these are durable businesses that have operated through many cycles and uh there&#39;s some Catalyst in play so it depends on the sector the company the competition uh where they are in the cycle what has caused the downturn what is the bare thesis what are they seeing that we can adopt and still say that it&#39;s overshot uh and then starting the analysis from that framework uh but no there&#39;s you know everyone thinks there&#39;s going to be a cookie cutter magic formula that you know they can press a button and become Warren Buffett Warren Buffett became Warren Buffett over 60 years of experience and he made a lot of mistakes in the beginning go read his early letters um and the only way you can get to that level uh and and or anywhere half as good as that level no one will ever be warn Buffett is through experience and that&#39;s the quick you know and you got to love the game because if you&#39;re doing this for money you will fail go run a business where you get paid for Massive Action and you&#39;ll make a fortune and then you give it to the handful of people in the world that can do a really good job buying these type of PE buying these type of businesses and buying them right and and having the ice in their veins and doing it with low leverage and all the conditions that are critical and and you&#39;re buying their experience you&#39;re buying Decades of their life for pennies on the dollar to do it for you while you&#39;re at the beach and that&#39;s what the smart people that do that invest with me do they&#39;re like ah you know I&#39;m a ctim millionaire I&#39;m a billionaire I&#39;m going to lay it off to Tom and let him worry about it all day and if he does well I give him more and if he does poorly I&#39;ll shut it off and the bottom line is we don&#39;t lose clients that&#39;s everything you need to know so um so so that&#39;s how I put it that way but good question on to the next Joe Cook hey TT turn around Tom great energy thank you I know you delay us uh I know you delay telling us non-clients when you get into Position will you be telling your non- clients we will not we look we discuss companies on a weekly basis that we think are interesting uh most of the time we own we we I mean I don&#39;t I would never listen to someone talking about a stock if they didn&#39;t have skin in the game like it&#39;s like someone trying to sell you an investment or a partnership it&#39;s like okay well how much do you have invested oh I have nothing but you should invest it&#39;s like okay salesman thank you very much on to the next um I will only listen to people who have skin in the game and then I got to make my own determinations if if they&#39;re correct um but uh number one this opinion not advice go to go to hedge fund tips.com terms um consult your financial adviser most of these are not appropriate for any of you you should be talking to your financial adviser we deal exclusively with accredited investors and qualified institutions qualified clients um for educational purposes Etc uh so we have no obligation to tell you when we&#39;re getting in when we&#39;re getting out that is for the benefit of our clients that is our sole responsibility as to our clients uh but we do uh let people know uh when we get out and um you know that&#39;s that but you know our average holding period is you know 12 to 48 months so it&#39;s not like we&#39;re talking about a stock and selling it you know the next week we might be selling in two years or three years or four years we&#39;re just saying this is our framework and a lot of times we&#39;ll put out a a name that we&#39;ve got invested in and it goes down and we buy more you know so you know about it at a better price than we know about it but we average down and then we make a lot of money on the upside so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s that&#39;s the way it goes um Matt Del priori thanks for everything you do what are your thoughts on Sofi uh no not for me covered a million times I hope a lot of people make money on it on their own uh I&#39;ve never had success um investing in a company that was run by a former investment banker um I will say Anthony Noto might be the exception he&#39;s he seems like a super quality guy EX military veteran Etc uh but I&#39;m going to still stick with that rule uh we&#39;ll just leave it at that David mullinex uh love your work been watching you for a few months now what do you think of constellation Brands I know you like diio I think they&#39;ll all work but I think Diago&#39;s got a better look at premiumization which is the trend that&#39;s going to be able to weather any storms uh constellation doesn&#39;t have that moat but it&#39;s a pretty pretty good business and um will benefit from the same thesis same as brown Foreman but I like diio better here a lot better uh Cole as I would not buy constellation so that&#39;s that&#39;s my answer to you Cole fman uh is this pullback not the Y carry trade onwi all I see on my feeds are deep seek but now Bank of Japan uh raid hikes what do you think yeah you guys KN know that from listening to me for weeks that&#39;s part of it they both played a role but that was the one thing that no one was talking about Sebastian Penna thoughts on [Music] PCG uh and qxo qxo the problem with qxo is you&#39;re paying 2x the cash for a spack so you&#39;re basically given $6 for nothing other than Brad Jacobs multi-decade track record of creating billions of dollars of wealth for for his shareholders in multiple businesses so the problem with qxo Sebastian is if he screws up uh you&#39;re going to lose half your money and they&#39;re going to liquidate for six or seven bucks and and that&#39;s what it is that&#39;s a risk I&#39;m willing to take uh they won&#39;t take me out on a stretcher all the other positions are crushing it so uh but I think that&#39;s a very low probability because Brad Jacobs is not a quitter and he&#39;s going to get something done and he&#39;s going to get a platform and 10 years out you&#39;re going to have an 8 to 10 bagger and a nice irr so um so that&#39;s that uh thoughts on PCG this is Harry this is California it&#39;s a turnaround uh we actually did ride this up we bought this in the hole during uh some years back and it&#39;s it wasn&#39;t a huge position and it it was it made a nice move but I think we sold out at like $16 or something it went went up to 21 now it&#39;s back to 16 uh this is California base I I&#39;m going to just be a pass on that I there are a lot of reasons why it could work which is why we got involved but it&#39;s not something I really want to do right now uh okay Patrick uh same same answer the previous question about other books and things to read and that&#39;s it we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one bye for now [Music] oh [Music] m [Music]
