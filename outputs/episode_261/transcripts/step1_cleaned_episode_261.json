me on and my buddy Lou for making the in introduction Lou Bassin uh you&#39;re awesome man and um so we&#39;re going to listen in here uh that&#39;s coming up 4 P PM Eastern Time ahead of that we have Thomas Hayes back with us the chairman and managing uh member of great Hill Capital always good to have Thomas he&#39;s a very smart young man um what do you make of what the banks first off told us Thomas I mean Steady As She Goes some bumps along the way but not nearly as many as some feared and they are sort of like a telegraphing something what yeah there&#39;s no question about it Neil the key here for all of earning season including the banks is expectations because profits were down year on year in aggregate but expectations were lower I think uh that&#39;s also going to be the theme with the General market expectations were 7.8% earnings growth at the end of June they&#39;re now 4.2% earnings growth so I think that&#39;s a low bar that we can beat and the market likes beating expectations as it relates to the banks the fears were around net interest income which Brian moan who you show at 4:00 said uh troughed last quarter so that&#39;s positive news and it was more than offset by deal making predominantly equity and debt issuance uh as well as uh trading as well so yeah I was noticing in case of Goldman sacks on fire uh with all of that deal making and all the hyper kinetic activity on Wall Street do you ever wonder that this there&#39;s almost too much gas there you know we have this beautiful combination right now of massive liquidity we had more central banks cut last month than have cut since 2020 and prior to that 2009 and that&#39;s historically a good thing for Equity so you have liquidity plus complacency uh and this could be the first October for an election year where we&#39;ve seen very very limited volatility so I&#39;ll be interested to see what happens in the next 2 weeks before the election do we get any of that normal chop pre-election like we usually see in presidential election years or do we just power through and uh right now the Market&#39;s voting with liquidity and beating expectation so far Donald Trump has said if he doesn&#39;t win we&#39;re going to have a market crash yeah what do you think of that uh I think that all presidents take too much credit for the economy uh whether whether good or bad or are find too much credit when it when it&#39;s bad I think the key thing that the market wants historically is checks and balances so yeah we do better under a split government under a split government so so long as one party doesn&#39;t get the presidency the Senate and the house I think the Market&#39;s going to like it I think you know you got GDP now up 3.2% from 2.5% uh you have rail freight car loadings which bode well they&#39;re up that bodess well for a manufactur in recovery we&#39;ve been in a manufacturing depression or strong recession for the last two years despite the rest of the economy picking up the slack you know you talk about the rest of the economy I look at the rest of the market used to be concentrating technology technology is still doing fine but it has widened out considerably and hence this argument that as we enter a third year of a bull market uh we could easily match the average length of a bull market what 5 and a half years some have gone on for a decade or more how do you see it I love it I love the broadening that&#39;s happened that&#39;s a sign of Health in the market and thematically what you see at the beginning of an easing cycle you know we just got 50 basis points where 25 26 days in is uh broadening so the unmagnify are are now going to start to outperform the Magnificent but you know by the way did you notice with the Magnificent Seven I was shocked when I read their multiples trading at 28 times earnings and and and a lot of that has to do with the fact yeah the stock prices have soared but earnings have soared so it makes the math more compelling and not nearly as nose bedy as we had through the internet boom yeah and I think why you&#39;re seeing the 493 though pick up is because the earnings growth of the Magnificent 7 is decelerating started the year at 50% it&#39;s down to mid- teens and the unmagnify were negative earnings growth until the most recent quarter inflected positive and they&#39;re going to move up to Mid teen so that there&#39;s huge opportunities on the let pursue that I think you were touching on when you were talking about maybe four and a half% earnings growth that&#39;s off the original estimates are close to double that right for the S&P 500 UBS has said something similar out with a statement that they think earnings will contract a little bit not not not Go reverse but we will see a sort of a tightening of that now what would that mean if they&#39;re right if you&#39;re right for the stocks yeah I think as long as they beat the low bar of expectations that that&#39;s going to be the key and looking out to 2025 you&#39;re looking at 15% earnings growth and margins are actually accelerating so we&#39;re kind of so this will be just a quarter phenomenon type thing it picks up as the time go I from all the data that we look at it looks like a short-term pause and then a re acceleration and that&#39;s a function of liquidity and things starting to move again all right got it my friend I always think that these guys play with us here don&#39;t you where they say you know uh we&#39;re going to have horrible numbers and if you just mildly beat it I pull that stunt with my parents on their report card it&#39;s going to be all FS you know and they see a couple of DS and C&#39;s and they think I&#39;m menet Neil the secret to happiness in life is low expectations and that&#39;s exactly what the earnings game is all about I built a career on it my friend uh always good SC and I really appreciate it Tom Tom excellent uncanny read of these markets another uncanny read of politics and we&#39;re back and then I want to thank Reuters for including me in their article on banks yesterday as well as Alison Lampert and David shepardson for including me in their article on the strike with regard to Boeing what I said on that article was striking workers who temporarily do not have a paycheck do not want to become per permanent unemployed work uh do not want to become unemployed workers who permanently do not have a paycheck I would estimate the strike will be resolved within a week as these workers do not want to find themselves in the next batch of 177,000 cuts Boeing cut 17,000 people in the last week uh they&#39;re raising 1010 billion of capital as a matter of fact while we&#39;re on the subject I put this post out today uh Boeing&#39;s raising $10 billion of equity to wait out the strike that was already priced in which is why the stock is up the total toal assets of the International Association of M machinists Union are $300 million that is the magnitude of their reserves the IM am is paying their members $250 a week to strike while the president of the Union makes $330,000 and has rejected a 30% pay increase for the workers and I know many of you listening to this videoast podcasts are like 30% raise and they&#39;re not taking it uh these are six figure jobs ladies and gentlemen for the most part uh so the 300 million is the collective assets of the 530,000 members of which only 33,000 are Boeing so you got to look at these other half a million workers who have been contributing to this fund that Boeing is draining after being offered a 30% pay raise uh very hard to pay mortgages and car payments on $250 a week when $100,000 Boeing jobs are on the table and being rejected Ed by Union leadership that earns hundreds of thousands of dollars per year we&#39;ll be interesting to see how the other half a million members feel about their Collective reserves being worn down by the Boeing strike so I think this comes to a head at the end of the day 10 billion versus 300 million you know who has more waiting power um and uh you know it seems like it&#39;s not like oh the workers are wrong and Boeing&#39;s right or vice versa it just seems like a a reasonable offer inflation has gone up much less than 30% uh so 30% seems to be a reasonable catchup to get everyone back on track Maybe I&#39;m Wrong maybe it needs to be 35% maybe it needs to be 25% but at the end of the day uh Boeing is in in in the stronger position here and I think this is going to lead to AE and a resolution and hopefully very positive for the workers and and obviously very positive for the company and for all the airlines that depend on their planes that have been waiting for those planes uh\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nBoeing&#39;s raising $10 billion of equity to wait out the strike that was already priced in which is why the stock is up. The total assets of the International Association of machinists Union are $300 million. The IAM is paying their members $250 a week to strike while the president of the Union makes $330,000 and has rejected a 30% pay increase for the workers. The 300 million is the collective assets of the 530,000 members of which only 33,000 are Boeing. Boeing is in in in the stronger position here and I think this is going to lead to a resolution and hopefully very positive for the workers and and obviously very positive for the company and for all the airlines that depend on their planes that have been waiting for those planes.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nPeter Lynch: you have to learn that there&#39;s a company behind every stock and that there&#39;s only one real reason why stocks go up companies go from doing poorly to doing well. Buffett: risk comes from not knowing what you&#39;re doing and those are people who just look at stock tickers and Chase what&#39;s going up the shiny objects and then get their heads handed to them in time.\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmoving along  some clotes to the week there are quite a few here uh first one is from Peter Lynch I think you have to learn that there&#39;s a company behind every stock and that there&#39;s only one real reason why stocks go up companies go from doing poorly to doing well uh that&#39;s our specialty and small companies grow into large large companies and we got a couple of those as well which is exciting buffit in this same vein says risk comes from not knowing what you&#39;re doing uh and those are people who just look at stock tickers and Chase what&#39;s going up the shiny objects and then get their hands heads handed to them in time not always right away but uh sooner or later it always happens uh and then\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  which is basically the ethos of our entire business at Great Hill Capital which is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised and that&#39;s what we specialize in and that&#39;s what we try to impart to our awesome uh viewing and listening audience here at hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes live from Connecticut this week by the way so uh first image we want to talk about is the 493 to post profit growth for the second straight quarter you can see the yellow line of earnings growth converging with the black line of The Magnificent 7 uh you can see magnificent 7 which we talked about a lot was up at 50% in the first quarter of this year earnings growth UNM magnificent 493 was negative now those are moving towards the mid- teens while the mag 7 is moving down to the mid teens and you say well if the mag 7 is still going to have mid teens earnings growth and the UNM mag is going to get to Mid teens earnings growth why doesn&#39;t the mag s keep going up because the mag s was priced at 28 times earnings and the equal weight was priced at 18 so you can pay uh you know uh basically a a third 33% less for the same earnings growth if you are outside the Magnificent 7even so I hope that answers everyone&#39;s\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfirst image we want to talk about is the 493 to post profit growth for the second straight quarter you can see the yellow line of earnings growth converging with the black line of The Magnificent 7 uh you can see magnificent 7 which we talked about a lot was up at 50% in the first quarter of this year earnings growth UNM magnificent 493 was negative now those are moving towards the mid- teens while the mag 7 is moving down to the mid teens and you say well if the mag 7 is still going to have mid teens earnings growth and the UNM mag is going to get to Mid teens earnings growth why doesn&#39;t the mag s keep going up because the mag s was priced at 28 times earnings and the equal weight was priced at 18 so you can pay uh you know uh basically a a third 33% less for the same earnings growth if you are outside the Magnificent 7even so I hope that answers everyone&#39;s questions  that&#39;s a very important statement right there this is from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson wanted to cover this one first the it talks about how long can this bull market go it just turned two years old but it&#39;s still young and he takes all the post World War II bull markets and uh works it down to the average is 5.5 years so we&#39;re two years in and the average gain of the bull markets since post World War II bull markets is 191% and we&#39;re only at 63.8% so we&#39;ve been talking not just since 2022 since 2020 since the covid lows and many of you were with us back then now we thought this thing could run till 2030 to 2032 so for those of you who have come in as clients we&#39;ve got a lot of exciting stuff to do over the next six seven years um the other thing\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nquestions  that&#39;s a very important statement right there this is from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson wanted to cover this one first the it talks about how long can this bull market go it just turned two years old but it&#39;s still young and he takes all the post World War II bull markets and uh works it down to the average is 5.5 years so we&#39;re two years in and the average gain of the bull markets since post World War II bull markets is 191% and we&#39;re only at 63.8% so we&#39;ve been talking not just since 2022 since 2020 since the covid lows and many of you were with us back then now we thought this thing could run till 2030 to 2032 so for those of you who have come in as clients we&#39;ve got a lot of exciting stuff to do over the next six seven years um the other thing here is  uh the ranges are just I mean you know 1987 to 2000 and we&#39;ve made the case that we think this is mid cycle of an 18e secular bull like we saw from uh 48 to 68 and 82 to 2000 based on demographics with the Millennials being the bulk of the population at 33 34 years old and they&#39;re spending doesn&#39;t cap out till the early 40s which gives us another six seven years um and that&#39;s those are the ones that you saw same thing with the Boomers 87 to 2000 uh 582 per um you know big big run so all right and then\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is uh the ranges are just I mean you know 1987 to 2000 and we've made the case that we think this is mid cycle of an 18e secular bull like we saw from uh 48 to 68 and 82 to 2000 based on demographics with the Millennials being the bulk of the population at 33 34 years old and they're spending doesn't cap out till the early 40s which gives us another six seven years um and that's those are the ones that you saw same thing with the Boomers 87 to 2000 uh 582 per um you know big big run so all right and then\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is the other thing year three of bull markets where we are now tend to be a little bit weaker and that is consistent what we've been saying ladies and gentlemen which is the heaviest weight would underperform and the indices would remain subdued so those passively indexing are going to be hurt and those uh that are you know exclusively in the S&P 500 and those that are uh stock active stock picking under the surface from the UNM magnificent 493 and know the underlying company and know what they're doing you know it's so funny investing is such a funny thing um in that every single day people will go to get heart surgery and um and they go to a heart surgeon because they're a specialist who's devoted you know 20 30 years to seeing thousands of cases and different variations and knowing the rules and knowing the exceptions to the rules to become a great heart surgeon uh and yet no one ever walks out of surgery and says uh I could do that you know when their wife uh needs a heart Sur heart uh procedure they never say I could do that uh and yet with investing you see it all the time and I would say in some cases the investing results are probably as important if you know not more important than the heart surgery but but kind of up there you know money is not everything but it's right up there with oxygen so leave it at that all right so uh\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nyear three of bull markets where we are now tend to be a little bit weaker and that is consistent what we've been saying ladies and gentlemen which is the heaviest weight would underperform and the indices would remain subdued so those passively indexing are going to be hurt and those uh that are you know exclusively in the S&P 500 and those that are uh stock active stock picking under the surface from the UNM magnificent 493 and know the underlying company and know what they're doing\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nPrivate Client weekly outflow from T bills is the highest we've seen. Record inflow into Chinese Equity Funds that happened at the end of September. We look at Baba a lot when it got up back up to 120 we're going to get smoked and I said the max pain would be if it breaks below 100 it just flush out all that late money it didn't quite do that it got down to like 101 or 102 now it's now it's starting to bounce again I hope we see a flush down to 98 we'll reload on longer dated options. Record outflow to from Japan Equity Funds. Money market fund assets still at a record. All of our positions that we've been talking about whether biotech which is moving whether China what are Emerging Markets small caps we're all predicated on the easing cycle at beginning. Traders chasing China stocks but allocator skeptical a big inflection point especially ahead of the US election we buy any China dips as policy makers saying Capital markets to be used aggressively to boost domestic animal spirits and demand and expect China gbt GDP upgrades from 4.6% China bond yields up from 2% Florida to Spur asset allocation into China which we talked about we wanted to see Rising Yuan which we've started to see we wanted to see Rising bond yields which we started to see this is all stuff that we had been talking about in recent months that is now playing out. Manufacturing continues to struggle while Services stay resilient. Accelerated recovery in Us free liquidity augur well for Equity markets so this liquidity M2 money supply easing cycle just beginning just starting to turn up and consumer expects 4% earnings growth in Q3 consensus rather they've set the bar low like I talked about with Neil so they will beat it they're already at 5% largely fueled by Banks and we'll probably finish up 6% probably 2% points maybe two and a half to three percentage points above the 4.2% expectations which will be good enough for government work S&P 500 companies beating consensus expectations. Demand recovery equals higher margins which is Awesome. The rumors of margin demise have been greatly exaggerated they're holding up higher than ever energy consumer discretionary Industrials materials and Tech have historically had high leverage easing rate pressure should translate into a pickup in manufacturing. Duck and Miller was out saying today that the market is you know the market is convinced that Trump is going to get reelected. A friend asked me the other day what what do you need to be in what's the Trump trade and the number one thing that will absolutely rocket if Trump gets elected is small caps. Chinese stocks did better than ever under Trump despite all the threats of tariffs he is someone that wants to make deals. Marcel Munch pointed out a HSI. Trump got elected in 2016 literally the the market just went straight up after he got elected absolutely straight up this was a double in two years so there's that and then\n\ngoing back to 1972 when rates ease manufacturing picks up and if you get a trump in uh versus a comma you&#39;re going to see a huge increase in the amount of manufacturing that&#39;s going to be done in the US duck and Miller was out saying today that the market is you know the market is convinced that Trump is going to get uh reelected I&#39;m not sure um I you know uh I don&#39;t do politics I will say the reason we&#39;re doing the podcast early is I&#39;m going to the Al Smith dinner tomorrow night which I do uh most every year I can but in presidential years it&#39;s unbelievable because historically for you know 30 40 years you&#39;ve gotten both presidential candidates come in and uh kind of make jokes for a couple hours this year one of the candidates decided not to show up um so it&#39;ll just be Trump tomorrow and um I was uh looking forward to meeting both and I&#39;ll be happy to meet one and it&#39;ll be a fun night so um a friend asked me the other day what what do you need to be in what&#39;s the Trump trade and the number one thing that will absolutely rocket if Trump gets elected is small caps they&#39;re going to do well anyway just because the stage is set but if you look remember back to 2016 what moved Industrials small caps manufacturing related Stuff Etc so um so that&#39;s going to be uh we&#39;re we&#39;re regardless of who is elected those groups are poised to move but the amount of the move will be exacerbated by Trump uh and if you remember Chinese stocks did better than ever under Trump um despite all the threats of tariffs he is uh someone that wants to make deals and we&#39;re going to cover that Marcel Munch uh pointed out a uh oh come on why is everything log me out okay here we go HSI okay so Trump got elected in 2016 literally the the market just went straight up after he got elected absolutely straight up uh this was a double in two years so there&#39;s that and then uhmoving along  the restocking cycle which has been the the core basis of our thesis for the last year and a half since the 2022 lows it Contin to improve continues to play out as anticipated all of you remember when this was at its low when I was talking about it we&#39;re going into a restock cycle uh we&#39;re worked through the inventories and here we are it played out as anticipated which is just the beginning of a recovery 2009 to 2011 you still had nine more years of recovery how about 2000 to 2001 to 2003 ladies and gentlemen well 2003 you had the recovery and then you kept rallying for another four years same story will be the case current mortgage rate is a Tipping Point to drive refinancing uh Russell growth versus Russell value relative price to trailing EPS uh bodess well for a reversion to Value uh you can see it now moving in that direction high PE dispersion usually bodess well for Value investing uh performance of Russell over Russ growth over value so you can see the mean reversion growth to Value has been obscenely high and then you get these reversion when did you get the biggest reversion 2001 to 2007 again how many times can I say that growth versus value elevated on a PE growth covered that crowded positions in growth stocks still evident based on factors low 4p versus high uh long-term growth rate so you can see that again these are all at extremes and if you play the other side that&#39;s where big money is made if you&#39;re patient and you&#39;re not on margin so you can sit through the short-term volatility because the moves are most violent before inflection points small size neglected by active managers you can see the data by the way if you&#39;re listening to it it&#39;s unbelievable I know many of you are longtime listeners firsttime callers but if you can watch this and see the visuals I&#39;m a visual learner uh it&#39;s a big big deal so growth versus value at xco high same story here value versus growth historical discount remains extreme highest since when 2001 before you had the biggest move in the shortest period of time and going back all the way to 1982 which is another great analog for where we are right now you had the most aggressive tightening cycle that uh then uh became an easing cycle and what happened value out performed growth for literally 12 13 straight years in a row so uh positioning and valuation AR argue well for value and income dividend yield inexpensive versus history you have to go to back to all the way to when 2001 to 2003 dividend yield neglected by active managers quarterly Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20 years when&#39;s the last time you saw it that wide 2001 guys this is not rocket science if you pay attention you can make a lot of money uh over time so number of CEO changes in 2024 is on the rise this is great for what we do we&#39;ve got our Brack and Daryl we got our Shane o Kelly we got our Alex Chris there&#39;s a reason we bet on jockeys and we&#39;re patient even Baba had a change uh that&#39;s the name of the game good quality business change in management re accelerate growth good companies when they&#39;re mappr uh and uh rinse and repeat from bad breath to 67% hit rate equal weighted S&P hit new highs in 2024 leading the regular index by 3.6 percentage points in Q3 Market breath has shifted from record Narrows in 2024 to a 20-year high with 67% of stocks ahead of the index um okay Jason goord says you know who&#39;s not chasing stocks\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nyou&#39;re not on margin so you can sit through the short-term volatility because the moves are most violent before inflection points small size neglected by active managers you can see the data by the way if you&#39;re listening to it it&#39;s unbelievable I know many of you are longtime listeners firsttime callers but if

stocks ahead of the index um okay Jason goord says you know who&#39;s not chasing stocks here is  insiders corporate Executives among S&amp;P 500 firms have some of the least open Market purchases in 13 years so he&#39;s saying that that&#39;s case for a short-term consolidation I wouldn&#39;t disagree it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see some some level of consolidation uh certainly in the higher weighted companies in the indices where you&#39;ve seen the lowest Insider buying and the highest corporate BuyBacks where that tells you everything you need to know uh saying one thing in doing something else both the mag 7 and other 493 okay slow in Q3 accelerate and Beyond covered that now this is interesting so this was uh I think I got this from uh bespoke this is the presidential election odds in poly Market Trump went up he just shot up to 60% and CA down to 40% uh or 58 to 41 in recent weeks not really um anyway politics is not my game like literally just give me a split government and we&#39;ll make money in equities but uh this is pretty pronounced and uh we&#39;ll see how it plays out according to Dr and Miller the market is is convinced that Trump is going to be elected I really did not have that level of conviction um um so we&#39;ll see what happens but uh there you go Cruise Lines credit card spend remains you know it&#39;s really here&#39;s why it&#39;s it&#39;s not I don&#39;t care about political ideology the reason that I didn&#39;t have that level conviction is it&#39;s like virtually impossible just like it was virtually impossible for Trump to get reelected because we were in a recession due to covid two quarters of negative GDP growth it&#39;s it&#39;s virtually impossible to get to not get reelected when you are in a strong economy uh it&#39;s possible but the odds are against you and given you know the question is uh the people that didn&#39;t own Assets in the last few years I.E real estate or equities uh although most many households now do through their retirement uh they haven&#39;t felt the benefit all that they&#39;ve seen is the increases in price uh on the things that they buy every day so that may be a silent majority that is causing these numbers in these objectives betting markets and polls to be skewing upwards despite the the overall economy GDP at 3.2% for this quarter GDP now uh moving higher so we will see we&#39;re prepared for all eventualities uh at the same time Equity index valuations in the US market are at the top of their long-term range while other markets are not so where can you find the best value relative to history is China and UK and Emerging Markets and Europe so that&#39;s where we&#39;re focused S&amp;P 500 companies beating consensus we covered that\n\nEquity index valuations in the US market are at the top of their long-term range while other markets are not so where can you find the best value relative to history is China and UK and Emerging Markets and Europe

MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfederal fund rate changes expected over the next 12 months at its peak a few months ago people were expecting 10 cuts now they're expecting six Cuts I think that actually makes a lot more sense 25 bips six times maybe two times before the end of the year and once a quarter next year it should be more than enough it wouldn't be surprise me if the econom is strong enough that the terminal ratees 4% not 3% that's non-consensus but we'll just put it out there our corporate misery index fell to negative Q3 in the F for the first time since 1 Q 2021 that is normal after you

Korean exports remain strong that's usually barometer for the global economy on a sector comparison stocks in Europe's trade on much bigger discounts than they' have typically done in the past that creates opportunity ladies and gentlemen the light blue\n\nthe median versus the current which uh shows the SE s in which you can find the biggest discounts uh which are most of them excluding real estate one of the structural Dynamics at play is that government debt levels are high and and Rising just like they were when in postor War II when they borrowed a lot to beat a visible enemy uh whereas this time we borrowed a lot to beat an invisible enemy and maybe more than a lot to beat an invisible enemy would be more justifiable if it was a visible enemy but it is what it is how did they get it from here down to here they inflated away they ran inflation uh 3 to 5% above Trend until 1956 this dropped down from uh 120 and change down to 60 57 by by the mid-50s and never looked back and then it infl back up it run runs in Cycles hopefully they&#39;ll do the exact same thing this time and based on their start with a 50 basis point cut and the 30 billion a month rolloff it tells me that they&#39;re playing from the same Himel next we&#39;re here this is the second week of reporting next week is the most important earnings week 33% of the S&P 500 component report next week and that&#39;s that expected versus actual results uh Fed rate Cuts this is interesting during a recession you get more rate Cuts than expected during a soft Landing you tend to get less and I think uh with the exception of 95 so we&#39;re expecting 200 basis points maybe we get less this time like 98 and like some of the other times where you have a soft landing and the amount of cuts comes in at or less than expectations so you know what are we talking about 150 would be less than expectations which would be consistent with the soft Landing like 95 like 98 uh type of scenarios households directly own 38% of all equities mutual funds own less pensions and government funds own less foreign investors own more and households own more a lot more since 2010 City economic surprise index turning up so that&#39;s a positive which we&#39;ve covered this is a chart from fund Strat about more items deflating even as core CPI flattish so 4 4% of components are now coming down in the CPI basket we expect productivity growth around 1.7% over the next few years followed by a larger Boost from artificial intelligence later this decade that&#39;s from Goldman Sachs so the the productivity Boost from AI is down the road estimates from economic research suggest that there could be a modest drag on productivity as a result of lower educational achievement that&#39;s kind of interesting and then seasonality for semiconductors a lot of people have been bearish on semis maybe justifiably so um you see conflicting data but historically November is a good month for semiconductors so just be alert to that following the election um we have exposure through Intel which we like I know you can&#39;t give it away but uh just just hang in there ladies and gentlemen uh you&#39;ve got an implicit government back stop like you had with Tesla Tesla should have been bankrupt times the government said we need EV to work the government needs a domestic Fab uh all of these companies that everyone uh praises to high heaven they don&#39;t exist without a a reliable Fab so if TSM shut down tomorrow Nvidia would be out of business AMD would out be out of business they are dependent on the kindness of strangers and Intel will be a duopoly with tsmc or oligopoly with Samsung if you want to include them in the mix but the government will stand them up and make them succeed in spite of themselves and we will benefit as Equity holders just patience Daniel Son statistical tests suggest that initial claims led the unemployment rate uh by roughly two to four months on average though they were less leading during contradictory turns okay so that&#39;s kind of a bearish thesis number of hurricanes this year so you see what&#39;s happening with J even though the number is not even normalized um so there&#39;s probably more to come and so far I&#39;ve been talking to people in Florida the amount of total loss of cars seems to be very high not even so much from Milton more from Helen with that storm surge so we&#39;ll see how that impacts and maybe that&#39;s why Morgan Stanley took up their SAR for this year from 158 in North America to 16 million and if so that&#39;s going to be very good for Cooper standard we shall see uh this is why you see consumer discretionary down uh to 2016 troughs before they recovered as well or 2021 troughs before it recovered as well food at home versus food away from home spread narrowed uh so a lot of restaurants there should be opportunity in restaurants moving forward we&#39;re trying to find some ways to express that um there are a lot lot of ways to do that so food away from home uh CP year on-year change so the prices so now that demand has come down a little bit this is the time you want to be a buyer not a seller uh food away from home the prices have gone down remember they were charging whatever they could whatever they with when the stimulus checks were out people would pay $13 for a Big Mac now they won&#39;t pay six uh and that normalizes the market shakes out the weak players and then the big get bigger again so keep an eye on that and McDonald&#39;s is telling you that story with their stock price corpor buyback authorizations year to dat have hit a record high that&#39;s very interesting because that&#39;s largely big Tech and at the same time the uh Buys in big Tech or the net buys actually the sells have been uh aggressive so just keep an eye watch what they do not what they say China equities we covered that vix tends to jump ahead of election let&#39;s see what happens the next two weeks this is the seasonality of small caps tend to be weak in an election year in the next couple of weeks right before the election like we saw in 2016 I made so much money on that they fell so much before right before the election we bought a ton of options so we&#39;ll see if we get some weakness it&#39;s actually looks like it&#39;s breaking out right now so it might already be pricing in what would be uh Trump would be more beneficial to small caps than than kamla but I think they would work irrespective of who had the executive branch so long as the Senate and the house are mixed and um and you get these big big moves small caps always do unbelievably well November and December so you want to be we are positioned for that uh companies with positive year-

that's a problem so you know that's that's one of the considerations we have and why we haven't done anything with those yet that and we also own you know plenty of sneakers through uh Vans gener CEO

175 so uh Kelly Bluebook report new vehicle prices at nq3 lower year-over-year incentive spending increases for the third straight month so this is exactly what we've been saying what would happen they would get the uh Lots back up to normal then you would see incentives then you'd see lower rates then you would see prices come down and then you'd see volume go through the roof and the oems would have a race to the bottom crushing each other with price and margins and uh Cooper standard would be smiling all the way to the bank as they just provide based on volume the lower the price gets the more incentives the more volume we're going to see because the average car on the road is over 13 years old same story and now playing out and if Morgan Stanley is correct and we're at 16 million SAR that 200,000 could be a big deal we've done some calculation it's about 150 bucks a car um and once they get over 158 the break even is basically 100% margin so you know you're talking two three bucks a share of earnings for every $200,000 of uh 200,000 cars above uh 15.8 so it's meaningful the the the key thing is not to get tied up with oh if they do 16.4 million SAR uh it'll earn six bucks and therefore I'll have a $90 stock at 15 times uh the key is is that they're going to earn well more than $7 a share well before the SAR cyclical SAR Peak that happens every cycle of 17 and a half to 18 million North American SAR we're nowhere near that and they won't have to be anywhere near that to earn seven bucks uh they could probably do it with their eyes closed at 16.8 you know with a 16 handle on it they'll be able to earn over seven bucks which is what we want to see uh and the multiples moving forward China Shores up property sector signals more spending is coming uh Boeing cut 177,000 jobs delay as jet strikes so they're basically say they're basically sending a message loud and clear to the strikers if you think you won't be part of the next 177,000 think again because you're having an impact but we're going to fight back and we'll be the last folks standing let's come to a reasonable deal and they also have Boeing has uh um filed a complaint uh filing unfair Labor practice charges against the Union uh saying that they're negotiating in bad faith and they're not being realistic uh and I think a lot of people uh looking at a sixf fig job working on an assembly line making sixf figure income and many people working very hard as well making a lot less than that and not getting 30% raises are probably looking at this similarly to how they looked at the port strikes with the head of the Union making $750,000 with Bentley's in his driveway and an 8,000 foot house and saying something doesn't smell right here so uh let's hope they come to a amicable

said as you get the recovery all the trinket stuff goes to hell and the quality stuff Baba controls um csrc this is from Brendan Ahern over at crane shares csrc chairman woo King will give a speech at the 2024 Financial Street Forum annual meeting on October 18th in Beijing he's expected to speak to the nine National measures supporting corporate governance including Chinese company paying dividends and buying back stock real estate stocks rows as banks in Beijing Shanghai and Shen push through a mass shortage refinancing at lower prime rate plus 30 basis points China says it has big stimulus coming but it won't say how big well we got some indication uh from Kon Global saying that it's rumored to be Six Trillion hat tip to Marcel Munch uh over on Twitter and that equates to about 840 billion us over the next three years which is monstrous monstrous tarp likee if you can consider the size of the US economy versus China and to do a tarp like stimulus uh at this stage in the recovery is absolutely amazing what if Warren Buffett had faced kamla Harris's unrealized capital gains tax from the outset here are the numbers and maybe people are starting to realize how silly some of the policies are in that um effectively Buffett would be worth 15.6 billion instead of 271 billion remember he gave about a 100 away to to uh Char it Buffett's by far the richest guy in the world the problem is uh if you care about Buffett rankings U uh Forbes rankings he gave away almost half of his money so he could be below musk and Zuckerberg and all those and Gates uh because he doesn't want to be number one because he doesn't want to get called every day so let let those guys get uh pestered every day for donations hedge fund manager who could be Trump treasury secretary says

plus complacency\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nstock market and sentiment results  boy we've got a lot of stuff this week uh which is exciting uh you can see the notes that we had we talked about VF Corp and Cooper standard here's the data from Morgan Stanley on Cooper standard here 16 million SAR up from 156 probably so up from the trough of 239 and uh up from the trough of 13.9 rather and uh pretty exciting it's it's and then next year they're estimating 16.2 which would be amazing so uh and I think it'll be higher next year by the way because the other thing is I don't know if you noticed Trump made a proposal not only to make gener uh not only to make generators tax deductible which would be unbelievable for gener but also to make um uh car loan interest payments tax deductible I mean it's like I sent the guy my portfolio and he's like what could I think of that would make Tom Hayes's clients even richer than they already are uh it would be unbelievable from a business standpoint uh you couldn't ask for anything more we will see uh one if he is elected and to if he can get those things through but man that would be a turbo boost for what we're trying to do here uh Baba update if you forgot what David teer said three weeks ago that he was above his position limit for China and if his number one position is Baba I think he overall has 20-some percent in China and he said if we got a pullback in coming weeks he would exceed the limit Again by adding more so here's the pullback you know what David teer is doing the question is what are you doing uh and I hope we get a little bit more weakness and uh be able to take advantage of it so here's that article 840 billion a new stimulus uh should be the number Bank of America fund manager survey update uh we put out on Tuesday here were the key points read the whole thing if you have a chance there's a lot of great data we're only going to cover five key points here the last time we saw this abrupt move a two standard deviation move out of bonds in one month was 2001 to 2003 again and which preceded some of the biggest moves in history for us small caps emerging markets in China equities so here you can see the last time you had this kind of move out of bond so abruptly again 2002 2001 2002 2003 and what happened next small caps up 165% Emerging Markets up 432 per and the hangsang up 34% in the following years um two managers are still at levels of global growth pessimism reminiscent of lows in equities they haven't been this low since uh 18 since 2009 since 2001 Etc investors reduced exposure to defensives and rotated into cyclicals this month what did we talk about last month move out of defensives and into cyclicals and that's what's happening right now materials and energy are the most underweight uh uh both about one standard deviation below their long-term average uh underweight so there's going to be some opportunities there uh we've got comto resources in that space and we will uh albam Maro on the material side and we'll look to add more uh short China equities is still the third most crowded trade this month even after the full reaming they took in September more reaming to come we're gonna get this one off the list for sure uh fear and greed got up to 70 so it's getting close to like maybe we're due for some coton consolidation now na Association of active investment managers didn't really get up to uh levels what well let's see maybe they updated it today NAA am I think they updated it tomorrow yeah they updated it tomorrow so uh moving right along uh

around please do for everyone else it&#39;s been a great hour uh okay first question comes from Robert Peters what do you think of silvaco fell sharply after guidance lowered a little over reaction from Robert Peters uh they helped somebody manufacturers with their tech software uh I&#39;m probably going to say no but let me take a look first SV Co okay so this company&#39;s been around for five minutes it&#39;s dropped from $21 down to $8 I don&#39;t invest in companies that don&#39;t have a long history of data that I can see how management operated through all different types of Cycles so uh this is an absolute no for me without even looking at the financials because there are not enough financials for me to look back at and sure we&#39;ll miss some opportunities doing that but um uh all I need to see right\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestion comes from Robert Peters what do you think of silvaco fell sharply after guidance lowered a little over reaction from Robert Peters uh they helped somebody manufacturers with their tech software uh I&#39;m probably going to say no but let me take a look first SV Co okay so this company&#39;s been around for five minutes it&#39;s dropped from $21 down to $8 I don&#39;t invest in companies that don&#39;t have a long history of data that I can see how management operated through all different types of Cycles so uh this is an absolute no for me without even looking at the financials because there are not enough financials for me to look back at and sure we&#39;ll miss some opportunities doing that but um uh all I need to see right here is  negative free cash flow and that&#39;s enough for me so uh no pass it&#39;s a trading vehicle not an investing vehicle but thank you for sending that in uh Ben Stiller okay uh yeah okay Ben Stiller I know you&#39;re a fan of Brad Jacobs do you ever invest in companies like qxo well we talked about it at the podcast we do have a position in qxo at 11:57 and uh pretty big one at that so on to the next question uh Caleb L lesby uh thank you for all the great content and insight what are your thoughts on Dollar Tree uh uh if you don&#39;t want to discuss that I&#39;d love your thoughts on Ulta as a dad with a daughter I got to believe they are making money good money thanks again sir from KB lesby uh I got my eye on both of them I&#39;m not doing anything on either but they do fall in the area of consumer discretionary that I want to be in and uh I think you&#39;ve got a keen nose and uh you&#39;ll probably rewrite on both of them but um I think it&#39;s a little early I mean let&#39;s take a look here and Ulta yeah I mean I think I think both of these are going to work the these are these are both positions that I&#39;ve done some work on and I&#39;m just kind of waiting and watching I mean the whole thing\n\nnegative free cash flow and that&#39;s enough for me so uh no pass it&#39;s a trading vehicle not an investing vehicle but thank you for sending that in uh Ben Stiller okay uh yeah okay Ben Stiller I know you&#39;re a fan of Brad Jacobs do you ever invest in companies like qxo well we talked about it at the podcast we do have a position in qxo at 11:57 and uh pretty big one at that so on to the next question ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA Caleb L lesby uh thank you for all the great content and insight what are your thoughts on Dollar Tree uh uh if you don&#39;t want to discuss that I&#39;d love your thoughts on Ulta as a dad with a daughter I got to believe they are making money good money thanks again sir from KB lesby uh I got my eye on both of them I&#39;m not doing anything on either but they do fall in the area of consumer discretionary that I want to be in and uh I think you&#39;ve got a keen nose and uh you&#39;ll probably rewrite on both of them but um I think it&#39;s a little early I mean let&#39;s take a look here and Ulta yeah I mean I think I think both of these are going to work the these are these are both positions that I&#39;ve done some work on and I&#39;m just kind of waiting and watching I mean the whole thing here is\n\nyou know in order to outperform you&#39;re never going to overperform out very hard to outperform with more than 15 positions and we usually try to run h 12 or 13 uh so the good is the better enemy the better is the enemy the best so we can put new positions in uh you know newer portfolios that we don&#39;t want to put them into positions that have already run 50 60 70% for existing clients um so that&#39;s where names like this can come to play uh and then as we Harvest other things that have gone up a lot like a bunch of the options in gener and Baba and all that stuff uh then we can start to put them into names like this but I do like both of these names I think they&#39;re both going to work for you whether today is the day to buy some or or two months from now I can&#39;t tell you that but I think if you have a Long View I think you&#39;re in good shape and uh well done Caleb uh Sam R what&#39;s your thoughts on Chinese people&#39;s sentiment not following the Bazooka stimulus uh there&#39;s no evidence of that I mean someone sent me a a message about lvmh was down because of China like look at some point people get tired of $30,000 handbag let them take a break let them look at the 20 in their closet and get tired of that after the next two months and they&#39;ll be back out buying Ferraris and lvmh Handbags once again uh it&#39;s just not going to be tomorrow so this idea about sentiment and stuff this is short-term noise the bottom line is the government&#39;s going to CH Jam so much liquidity into that market it is going to continue to go up in serious size in fits and starts Matt hollerin asking about Cooper standard um yeah look it&#39;s it&#39;s not a perfect formula but yes the margins are very high because all the fixed costs are in and the parts are very cheap once you get about 15.8 um it&#39;s about 150 a car so that&#39;s what I would use but that doesn&#39;t include all the pricing concessions that they gained uh which they renegotiate every year or two uh so it&#39;s an imperfect formula but I think the $3 uh every two 300,000 cars is the way to look at it and um I think it&#39;s going to be better than most people expect so uh so that&#39;s round numbers it you can&#39;t be that precise because as that money starts to flow in management will screw it up so it&#39;s not going to be perfect uh but it&#39;s going to be better well better the key here Matt is working with a crayon not a scalpel and my view is that uh you&#39;ll probably get to $67 a share and earnings between 16 half and 17 A5 uh Sor 16 A5 USR and 17 versus what it took in past cycles of 17 and a half to 18 to get to the same earnings power because of how well they&#39;ve got the business set up now for the next inflection so that&#39;s all you need to know you&#39;re not going to get it oneto one uh in that way but um certainly I think the first few hundred, cars is going to to uh shock a lot of people and that&#39;s where the the biggest bulk of that is Garrett hi Tom always the highlight of my week to listen to the podcast thank you as so few in the hedge fund Asset Management industry offer such a service I was wondering if you had a read on lvmh after earnings it seems like it this also hinges on China&#39;s thesis yeah I mean you know the issue with this one is that it&#39;s going to trade I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s and that&#39;s the other issue I have with buying Lulu or Nike is it&#39;s just a double you know you you want to try to have a couple handfuls less than a dozen as uncorrelated bets as you can get uh SO trading lvmh and owning Baba in size you&#39;re kind of doing the same thing it&#39;s a bet on China&#39;s recovery so if you don&#39;t have Baba then you should take a good look at lvmh if you have baba you kind of it&#39;s It&#39;s kind of the the same trade um only not as good so I think you&#39;re there I think you&#39;re a hair hair early on that one Philip leair your podcast have been very insightful keep up the great work thoughts on dxcm I think this is a diabetes thing if I&#39;m not mistaken we&#39;ve looked at this one in the past um the gross their margins are declining materially but their revenues keep going up so you got to understand what how are these margins going to start to recover I mean there&#39;s still decent Mar at 63% but they&#39;re falling off a cliff even as cash flow recoveries let&#39;s see what is this software or is this diabetes it&#39;s probably soft medical device company continuous glucose monitoring systems in the US and internationally yeah so just figure out what their mode is if you remember Baxter got rid of that business um I think you&#39;re probably be okay that was sold off in line with the glp scare I like the idea I think you really got to understand what they have and how it&#39;s Unique and uh and then go from there but as far as everyone getting on gp1s and losing weight and and not being diabetic anymore uh the data we looked at during the scare showed that uh virtually the uh these things are going to be annuities it&#39;s like owning cigarette companies they&#39;re going to keep generating cash they&#39;re going to keep buying back stuff stock so you&#39;re probably okay with that one without doing the work in other words I&#39;m saying go ahead and do the work start listening to the conference call start reading the annual report start doing Channel checks on competition etc etc Maas beckard uh just saw you talked about Intel trading at tangible book meaning if it got liquidated you&#39;d get back around $20 a share very comfortable yet here in Germany a small B battery manufacturing mostly for apple airpods is bankrupt but they do not pay tangible book to shareholders instead they confiscate the shares them shareholders are left with nothing no compensation this is according to German law called stug sounds like a bland joke about communist Community blah blah blah are you aware of similar laws in the US no okay trying to learn more from David I heard he had problems with Russian Bonds in 1998 government let them toall okay so Matias number one the guy compounded money in over 20% for decades one of the few in the world uh so he had a bad trade with Russian bonds like you know happens on to the next uh what about the other 300 trades that he did well it&#39;s so funny while we&#39;ve been waiting for Baba to work we probably put out a dozen double pluses on this podcast and everyone&#39;s focused on Baba and so excited that it moves 40 bucks it hasn&#39;t even started yet and and people are so excited about that but the other does doz or so double pluses that no one cares about I mean you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh you can&#39;t make this stuff up so the point is is look this is America if there&#39;s excess Equity after the bond holders are paid you get it back in the case of Intel there would be and in the case of that ever happening that&#39;s Looney Tunes it did 52 billion in Revenue the government&#39;s backstopping it they need the Fabs and that&#39;s the whole story not whether you get back your 20 bucks as far as what happens in socialist Germany I have no idea and that&#39;s why I don&#39;t invest there Dave Jones uh question about you think gxo gets bought out I hope not if they do I would think it&#39;ll be around 80 bucks but uh time will tell Robert little what do you think about ticker CX doesn&#39;t seem like it should have a $112,000 market cap um obviously a new listener uh for browser based video monitoring and analytics this is more this me too BS stuff um this is this is nothing this is not high quality this is not durable cash flows this is gambling stocks which we have no interest in so Robert I implore you to listen to many of our past podcasts start to learn a framework that I learned uh uh from following Buffett Munger Benjamin Graham all the greats teer uh lee cooperman Etc uh that&#39;s durable that works over time and um you know companies like this where you&#39;re trying to get rich quick on a penny stock is the shortest way to blow up your account and never get rich so uh we&#39;ll leave it at that uh Rob Kowalski uh hey Tom love the show do you have any thoughts on nuclear uranium commodity stops like kamiko no uh so nuclear&#39;s all the hype now so these things will trade for a week and then they&#39;ll blow up uh the big trade we had on that made a multibagger very quickly was Rolls-Royce and we were playing the airline service recovery and got the benefit of uh the uh the smrs which are 10 years out by the way uh so they&#39;re very speculative at this point there will be a way to play that it&#39;s not right now so let all the Maniacs chase the shiny objects run them up and then crash in the next six months that&#39;s not what we do we&#39;re not gamblers chasing the next hot idea JT we&#39;re chasing the shorer ones uh Slumber and oil field services companies keep getting my attention [Music] uh what is in your opinion on Slumber would you prefer a single high quality name like S Baker Halbert in her plate through o diversification while positioning for Rebound uh I keep looking at these they&#39;re not cheap enough for me yet uh or they may never get there um yeah I&#39;ve been looking for a play here for a while and uh there&#39;s just hire and better uses of my money it&#39;s not now uh Tim Wang thoughts on Celsius Holdings got my eye on it not doing anything yet never do anything but I am spending time on it I&#39;ll leave it at that but probably not going to ever do anything with it uh Eric Walker Carnival all right so this thing has already had a run we talked about this years ago in 2020 and now that it&#39;s doubled everyone wants it so let&#39;s just take a look yeah I mean the issue with this was the balance sheet it&#39;ll probably go up to 30 bucks but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to go a whole lot more than that this cycle because of what their balance sheet looks like postco but um uh the people that were buying it during 2019 and were able to hold through it&#39;s it&#39;s okay wasn&#39;t the best use of capital but it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a decent trade and will work will work higher Drew Robinson uh hey Tom huge fan of the podcast before I get into my question why to mentioned the Walgreens employee Vape comment in last week&#39;s episode was too good so relatable anyway what is good entry point for Tesla uh difficult to determine whether robot taxing optimistic price is in stock I&#39;m curious what your thoughts are uh I I&#39;ve never bet with musk or against musk and I have my reasons for that which I cannot discuss on the podcast but um I would never bet against him and if you get an opportunity to invest in SpaceX at anything below half a trillion dollars it probably makes sense as far as Robo taxes and all this other stuff it&#39;s just not what we do um we look for high quality companies that are trading at reasonable valuations that have pretty sure doubles this one you know I&#39;ve even looked at it recently and I I don&#39;t make bets on uh guessing Technologies in the future it&#39;s not where you make durable predictable money um so with that it&#39;s just I&#39;m I hope it works for musk and the world I&#39;m not going to participate Jim Jones with the recent rally into China as a whole do you think that ant group

yeah the ones that have been with me for a while have it at five bucks and change but uh I think 13 bucks is like unbelievable so I I wouldn&#39;t really want to mess with this at all um let me take a look at the balance sheet my guess is their balance sheet is toast based on the way the stock is trading cash flow I mean they&#39;re not even anywhere remotely near to cash flow break even so for me I&#39;m out U but keep them coming Bob I think you&#39;re going to hit a home run on the next one and let&#39;s see Jason Z Celsius are you still looking at it yeah continue to look at it continue to

rates ease manufacturing picks up and if you get a trump in uh versus a comma you&#39;re going to see a huge increase in the amount of manufacturing that&#39;s going to be done in the US duck and Miller was out saying today that the market is you know the market is convinced that Trump is going to get uh reelected I&#39;m not sure um I you know uh I don&#39;t do politics I will say the reason we&#39;re doing the podcast early is I&#39;m going to the Al Smith dinner tomorrow night which I do uh most every year I can but in presidential years it&#39;s unbelievable because historically for you know 30 40 years you&#39;ve gotten both presidential candidates come in and uh kind of make jokes for a couple hours this year one of the candidates decided not to show up um so it&#39;ll just be Trump tomorrow and um I was uh looking forward to meeting both and I&#39;ll be happy to meet one and it&#39;ll be a fun night so um a friend asked me the other day what what do you need to be in what&#39;s the Trump trade and the number one thing that will absolutely rocket if Trump gets elected is small caps they&#39;re going to do well anyway just because the stage is set but if you look remember back to 2016 what moved Industrials small caps manufacturing related Stuff Etc so um so that&#39;s going to be uh we&#39;re we&#39;re regardless of who is elected those groups are poised to move but the amount of the move will be exacerbated by Trump uh and if you remember Chinese stocks did better than ever under Trump um despite all the threats of tariffs he is uh someone that wants to make deals and we&#39;re going to cover that Marcel Munch uh pointed out a uh oh come on why is everything log me out okay here we go HSI okay so Trump got elected in 2016 literally the the market just went straight up after he got elected absolutely straight up uh this was a double in two years so there&#39;s that and then uhmoving along  the restocking cycle which has been the the core basis of our thesis for the last year and a half since the 2022 lows it Contin to improve continues to play out as anticipated all of you remember when this was at its low when I was talking about it we&#39;re going into a restock cycle uh we&#39;re worked through the inventories and here we are it played out as anticipated which is just the beginning of a recovery 2009 to 2011 you still had nine more years of recovery how about 2000 to 2001 to 2003 ladies and gentlemen well 2003 you had the recovery and then you kept rallying for another four years same story will be the case current mortgage rate is a Tipping Point to drive refinancing uh Russell growth versus Russell value relative price to trailing EPS uh bodess well for a reversion to Value uh you can see it now moving in that direction high PE dispersion usually bodess well for Value investing uh performance of Russell over Russ growth over value so you can see the mean reversion growth to Value has been obscenely high and then you get these reversion when did you get the biggest reversion 2001 to 2007 again how many times can I say that growth versus value elevated on a PE growth covered that crowded positions in growth stocks still evident based on factors low 4p versus high uh long-term growth rate so you can see that again these are all at extremes and if you play the other side that&#39;s where big money is made if you&#39;re patient and you&#39;re not on margin so you can sit through the short-term volatility because the moves are most violent before inflection points small size neglected by active managers you can see the data by the way if you&#39;re listening to it it&#39;s unbelievable I know many of you are longtime listeners firsttime callers but if you can watch this and see the visuals I&#39;m a visual learner uh it&#39;s a big big deal so growth versus value at xco high same story here value versus growth historical discount remains extreme highest since when 2001 before you had the biggest move in the shortest period of time and going back all the way to 1982 which is another great analog for where we are right now you had the most aggressive tightening cycle that uh then uh became an easing cycle and what happened value out performed growth for literally 12 13 straight years in a row so uh positioning and valuation AR argue well for value and income dividend yield inexpensive versus history you have to go to back to all the way to when 2001 to 2003 dividend yield neglected by active managers quarterly Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20 years when&#39;s the last time you saw it that wide 2001 guys this is not rocket science if you pay attention you can make a lot of money uh over time so number of CEO changes in 2024 is on the rise this is great for what we do we&#39;ve got our Brack and Daryl we got our Shane o Kelly we got our Alex Chris there&#39;s a reason we bet on jockeys and we&#39;re patient even Baba had a change uh that&#39;s the name of the game good quality business change in management re accelerate growth good companies when they&#39;re mappr uh and uh rinse and repeat from bad breath to 67% hit rate equal weighted S&P hit new highs in 2024 leading the regular index by 3.6 percentage points in Q3 Market breath has shifted from record Narrows in 2024 to a 20-year high with 67% of stocks ahead of the index um okay Jason goord says you know who&#39;s not chasing stocks",
    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nNeil Cavuto on Fox Business yesterday want to thank Neil and Jenna D toasis for having me on and my buddy Lou for making the in introduction Lou Bassin uh you&#39;re awesome man and um so we&#39;re going to listen in here uh that&#39;s coming up 4 P PM Eastern Time ahead of that we have Thomas Hayes back with us the chairman and managing uh member of great Hill Capital always good to have Thomas he&#39;s a very smart young man um what do you make of what the banks first off told us Thomas I mean Steady As She Goes some bumps along the way but not nearly as many as some feared and they are sort of like a telegraphing something what yeah there&#39;s no question about it Neil the key here for all of earning season including the banks is expectations because profits were down year on year in aggregate but expectations were lower I think uh that&#39;s also going to be the theme with the General market expectations were 7.8% earnings growth at the end of June they&#39;re now 4.2% earnings growth so I think that&#39;s a low bar that we can beat and the market likes beating expectations as it relates to the banks the fears were around net interest income which Brian moan who you show at 4:00 said uh troughed last quarter so that&#39;s positive news and it was more than offset by deal making predominantly equity and debt issuance uh as well as uh trading as well so yeah I was noticing in case of Goldman sacks on fire uh with all of that deal making and all the hyper kinetic activity on Wall Street do you ever wonder that this there&#39;s almost too much gas there you know we have this beautiful combination right now of massive liquidity we had more central banks cut last month than have cut since 2020 and prior to that 2009 and that&#39;s historically a good thing for Equity so you have liquidity plus complacency uh and this could be the first October for an election year where we&#39;ve seen very very limited volatility so I&#39;ll be interested to see what happens in the next 2 weeks before the election do we get any of that normal chop pre-election like we usually see in presidential election years or do we just power through and uh right now the Market&#39;s voting with liquidity and beating expectation so far Donald Trump has said if he doesn&#39;t win we&#39;re going to have a market crash yeah what do you think of that uh I think that all presidents take too much credit for the economy uh whether whether good or bad or are find too much credit when it when it&#39;s bad I think the key thing that the market wants historically is checks and balances so yeah we do better under a split government under a split government so so long as one party doesn&#39;t get the presidency the Senate and the house I think the Market&#39;s going to like it I think you know you got GDP now up 3.2% from 2.5% uh you have rail freight car loadings which bode well they&#39;re up that bodess well for a manufactur in recovery we&#39;ve been in a manufacturing depression or strong recession for the last two years despite the rest of the economy picking up the slack you know you talk about the rest of the economy I look at the rest of the market used to be concentrating technology technology is still doing fine but it has widened out considerably and hence this argument that as we enter a third year of a bull market uh we could easily match the average length of a bull market what 5 and a half years some have gone on for a decade or more how do you see it I love it I love the broadening that&#39;s happened that&#39;s a sign of Health in the market and thematically what you see at the beginning of an easing cycle you know we just got 50 basis points where 25 26 days in is uh broadening so the unmagnify are are now going to start to outperform the Magnificent but you know by the way did you notice with the Magnificent Seven I was shocked when I read their multiples trading at 28 times earnings and and and a lot of that has to do with the fact yeah the stock prices have soared but earnings have soared so it makes the math more compelling and not nearly as nose bedy as we had through the internet boom yeah and I think why you&#39;re seeing the 493 though pick up is because the earnings growth of the Magnificent 7 is decelerating started the year at 50% it&#39;s down to mid- teens and the unmagnify were negative earnings growth until the most recent quarter inflected positive and they&#39;re going to move up to Mid teen so that there&#39;s huge opportunities on the let pursue that I think you were touching on when you were talking about maybe four and a half% earnings growth that&#39;s off the original estimates are close to double that right for the S&P 500 UBS has said something similar out with a statement that they think earnings will contract a little bit not not not Go reverse but we will see a sort of a tightening of that now what would that mean if they&#39;re right if you&#39;re right for the stocks yeah I think as long as they beat the low bar of expectations that that&#39;s going to be the key and looking out to 2025 you&#39;re looking at 15% earnings growth and margins are actually accelerating so we&#39;re kind of so this will be just a quarter phenomenon type thing it picks up as the time go I from all the data that we look at it looks like a short-term pause and then a re acceleration and that&#39;s a function of liquidity and things starting to move again all right got it my friend I always think that these guys play with us here don&#39;t you where they say you know uh we&#39;re going to have horrible numbers and if you just mildly beat it I pull that stunt with my parents on their report card it&#39;s going to be all FS you know and they see a couple of DS and C&#39;s and they think I&#39;m menet Neil the secret to happiness in life is low expectations and that&#39;s exactly what the earnings game is all about I built a career on it my friend uh always good SC and I really appreciate it Tom Tom excellent uncanny read of these markets another uncanny read of politics and we&#39;re back and then I want to thank Reuters for including me in their article on banks yesterday as well as Alison Lampert and David shepardson for including me in their article on the strike with regard to Boeing what I said on that article was striking workers who temporarily do not have a paycheck do not want to become per permanent unemployed work uh do not want to become unemployed workers who permanently do not have a paycheck I would estimate the strike will be resolved within a week as these workers do not want to find themselves in the next batch of 177,000 cuts Boeing cut 17,000 people in the last week uh they&#39;re raising 1010 billion of capital as a matter of fact while we&#39;re on the subject I put this post out today uh Boeing&#39;s raising $10 billion of equity to wait out the strike that was already priced in which is why the stock is up the total toal assets of the International Association of M machinists Union are $300 million that is the magnitude of their reserves the IM am is paying their members $250 a week to strike while the president of the Union makes $330,000 and has rejected a 30% pay increase for the workers and I know many of you listening to this videoast podcasts are like 30% raise and they&#39;re not taking it uh these are six figure jobs ladies and gentlemen for the most part uh so the 300 million is the collective assets of the 530,000 members of which only 33,000 are Boeing so you got to look at these other half a million workers who have been contributing to this fund that Boeing is draining after being offered a 30% pay raise uh very hard to pay mortgages and car payments on $250 a week when $100,000 Boeing jobs are on the table and being rejected Ed by Union leadership that earns hundreds of thousands of dollars per year we&#39;ll be interesting to see how the other half a million members feel about their Collective reserves being worn down by the Boeing strike so I think this comes to a head at the end of the day 10 billion versus 300 million you know who has more waiting power um and uh you know it seems like it&#39;s not like oh the workers are wrong and Boeing&#39;s right or vice versa it just seems like a a reasonable offer inflation has gone up much less than 30% uh so 30% seems to be a reasonable catchup to get everyone back on track Maybe I&#39;m Wrong maybe it needs to be 35% maybe it needs to be 25% but at the end of the day uh Boeing is in in in the stronger position here and I think this is going to lead to AE and a resolution and hopefully very positive for the workers and and obviously very positive for the company and for all the airlines that depend on their planes that have been waiting for those planes uh",

    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmoving along  some clotes to the week there are quite a few here uh first one is from Peter Lynch I think you have to learn that there&#39;s a company behind every stock and that there&#39;s only one real reason why stocks go up companies go from doing poorly to doing well uh that&#39;s our specialty and small companies grow into large large companies and we got a couple of those as well which is exciting buffit in this same vein says risk comes from not knowing what you&#39;re doing uh and those are people who just look at stock tickers and Chase what&#39;s going up the shiny objects and then get their hands heads handed to them in time not always right away but uh sooner or later it always happens uh and then\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  which is basically the ethos of our entire business at Great Hill Capital which is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised and that&#39;s what we specialize in and that&#39;s what we try to impart to our awesome uh viewing and listening audience here at hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes live from Connecticut this week by the way so uh first image we want to talk about is the 493 to post profit growth for the second straight quarter you can see the yellow line of earnings growth converging with the black line of The Magnificent 7 uh you can see magnificent 7 which we talked about a lot was up at 50% in the first quarter of this year earnings growth UNM magnificent 493 was negative now those are moving towards the mid- teens while the mag 7 is moving down to the mid teens and you say well if the mag 7 is still going to have mid teens earnings growth and the UNM mag is going to get to Mid teens earnings growth why doesn&#39;t the mag s keep going up because the mag s was priced at 28 times earnings and the equal weight was priced at 18 so you can pay uh you know uh basically a a third 33% less for the same earnings growth if you are outside the Magnificent 7even so I hope that answers everyone&#39;s",

company behind every stock and that there&#39;s only one real reason why stocks go up companies go from doing poorly to doing well uh that&#39;s our specialty and small companies grow into large large companies and we got a couple of those as well which is exciting buffit in this same vein says risk comes from not knowing what you&#39;re doing uh and those are people who just look at stock tickers and Chase what&#39;s going up the shiny objects and then get their hands heads handed to them in time not always right away but uh sooner or later it always happens uh and then\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  which is basically the ethos of our entire business at Great Hill Capital which is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be Mis appraised and that&#39;s what we specialize in and that&#39;s what we try to impart to our awesome uh viewing and listening audience here at hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes live from Connecticut this week by the way so uh first image we want to talk about is the 493 to post profit growth for the second straight quarter you can see the yellow line of earnings growth converging with the black line of The Magnificent 7 uh you can see magnificent 7 which we talked about a lot was up at 50% in the first quarter of this year earnings growth UNM magnificent 493 was negative now those are moving towards the mid- teens while the mag 7 is moving down to the mid teens and you say well if the mag 7 is still going to have mid teens earnings growth and the UNM mag is going to get to Mid teens earnings growth why doesn&#39;t the mag s keep going up because the mag s was priced at 28 times earnings and the equal weight was priced at 18 so you can pay uh you know uh basically a a third 33% less for the same earnings growth if you are outside the Magnificent 7even so I hope that answers everyone&#39;s\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nquestions  that&#39;s a very important statement right there this is from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson wanted to cover this one first the it talks about how long can this bull market go it just turned two years old but it&#39;s still young and he takes all the post World War II bull markets and uh works it down to the average is 5.5 years so we&#39;re two years in and the average gain of the bull markets since post World War II bull markets is 191% and we&#39;re only at 63.8% so we&#39;ve been talking not just since 2022 since 2020 since the covid lows and many of you were with us back then now we thought this thing could run till 2030 to 2032 so for those of you who have come in as clients we&#39;ve got a lot of exciting stuff to do over the next six seven years um the other thing here is  uh the ranges are just I mean you know 1987 to 2000 and we&#39;ve made the case that we think this is mid cycle of an 18e secular bull like we saw from uh 48 to 68 and 82 to 2000 based on demographics with the Millennials being the bulk of the population at 33 34 years old and they&#39;re spending doesn&#39;t cap out till the early 40s which gives us another six seven years um and that&#39;s those are the ones that you saw same thing with the Boomers 87 to 2000 uh 582 per um you know big big run so all right and then\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is uh the ranges are just I mean you know 1987 to 2000 and we've made the case that we think this is mid cycle of an 18e secular bull like we saw from uh 48 to 68 and 82 to 2000 based on demographics with the Millennials being the bulk of the population at 33 34 years old and they're spending doesn't cap out till the early 40s which gives us another six seven years um and that's those are the ones that you saw same thing with the Boomers 87 to 2000 uh 582 per um you know big big run so all right and then\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is the other thing year three of bull markets where we are now tend to be a little bit weaker and that is consistent what we've been saying ladies and gentlemen which is the heaviest weight would underperform and the indices would remain subdued so those passively indexing are going to be hurt and those uh that are you know exclusively in the S&P 500 and those that are uh stock active stock picking under the surface from the UNM magnificent 493 and know the underlying company and know what they're doing you know it's so funny investing is such a funny thing um in that every single day people will go to get heart surgery and um and they go to a heart surgeon because they're a specialist who's devoted you know 20 30 years to seeing thousands of cases and different variations and knowing the rules and knowing the exceptions to the rules to become a great heart surgeon uh and yet no one ever walks out of surgery and says uh I could do that you know when their wife uh needs a heart Sur heart uh procedure they never say I could do that uh and yet with investing you see it all the time and I would say in some cases the investing results are probably as important if you know not more important than the heart surgery but but kind of up there you know money is not everything but it's right up there with oxygen so leave it at that all right so uh\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nPrivate Client weekly outflow from T bills is the highest we've seen. Record inflow into Chinese Equity Funds that happened at the end of September. We look at Baba a lot when it got up back up to 120 we're going to get smoked and I said the max pain would be if it breaks below 100 it just flush out all that late money it didn't quite do that it got down to like 101 or 102 now it's now it's starting to bounce again I hope we see a flush down to 98 we'll reload on longer dated options. Record outflow to from Japan Equity Funds. Money market fund assets still at a record. All of our positions that we've been talking about whether biotech which is moving whether China what are Emerging Markets small caps we're all predicated on the easing cycle at beginning. Traders chasing China stocks but allocator skeptical a big inflection point especially ahead of the US election we buy any China dips as policy makers saying Capital markets to be used aggressively to boost domestic animal spirits and demand and expect China gbt GDP upgrades from 4.6% China bond yields up from 2% Florida to Spur asset allocation into China which we talked about we wanted to see Rising Yuan which we've started to see we wanted to see Rising bond yields which we started to see this is all stuff that we had been talking about in recent months that is now playing out. Manufacturing continues to struggle while Services stay resilient. Accelerated recovery in Us free liquidity augur well for Equity markets so this liquidity M2 money supply easing cycle just beginning just starting to turn up and consumer expects 4% earnings growth in Q3 consensus rather they've set the bar low like I talked about with Neil so they will beat it they're already at 5% largely fueled by Banks and we'll probably finish up 6% probably 2% points maybe two and a half to three percentage points above the 4.2% expectations which will be good enough for government work S&P 500 companies beating consensus expectations. Demand recovery equals higher margins which is Awesome. The rumors of margin demise have been greatly exaggerated they're holding up higher than ever energy consumer discretionary Industrials materials and Tech have historically had high leverage easing rate pressure should translate into a pickup in manufacturing. Duck and Miller was out saying today that the market is you know the market is convinced that Trump is going to get reelected. A friend asked me the other day what what do you need to be in what's the Trump trade and the number one thing that will absolutely rocket if Trump gets elected is small caps. Chinese stocks did better than ever under Trump despite all the threats of tariffs he is someone that wants to make deals. Marcel Munch pointed out a HSI. Trump got elected in 2016 literally the the market just went straight up after he got elected absolutely straight up this was a double in two years so there's that and then\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nyou&#39;re not on margin so you can sit through the short-term volatility because the moves are most violent before inflection points small size neglected by active managers you can see the data by the way if you&#39;re listening to it it&#39;s unbelievable I know many of you are longtime listeners firsttime callers but if you can watch this and see the visuals I&#39;m a visual learner uh it&#39;s a big big deal so growth versus value at xco high same story here value versus growth historical discount remains extreme highest since when 2001 before you had the biggest move in the shortest period of time and going back all the way to 1982 which is another great analog for where we are right now you had the most aggressive tightening cycle that uh then uh became an easing cycle and what happened value out performed growth for literally 12 13 straight years in a row so uh positioning and valuation AR argue well for value and income dividend yield inexpensive versus history you have to go to back to all the way to when 2001 to 2003 dividend yield neglected by active managers quarterly Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20 years when&#39;s the last time you saw it that wide 2001 guys this is not rocket science if you pay attention you can make a lot of money uh over time so number of CEO changes in 2024 is on the rise this is great for what we do we&#39;ve got our Brack and Daryl we got our Shane o Kelly we got our Alex Chris there&#39;s a reason we bet on jockeys and we&#39;re patient even Baba had a change uh that&#39;s the name of the game good quality business change in management re accelerate growth good companies when they&#39;re mappr uh and uh rinse and repeat from bad breath to 67% hit rate equal weighted S&amp;P hit new highs in 2024 leading the regular index by 3.6 percentage points in Q3 Market breath has shifted from record Narrows in 2024 to a 20-year high with 67% of stocks ahead of the index um okay Jason goord says you know who&#39;s not chasing stocks here is  insiders corporate Executives among S&amp;P 500 firms have some of the least open Market purchases in 13 years so he&#39;s saying that that&#39;s case for a short-term consolidation I wouldn&#39;t disagree it wouldn&#39;t surprise me to see some some level of consolidation uh certainly in the higher weighted companies in the indices where you&#39;ve seen the lowest Insider buying and the highest corporate BuyBacks where that tells you everything you need to know uh saying one thing in doing something else both the mag 7 and other 493 okay slow in Q3 accelerate and Beyond covered that now this is interesting so this was uh I think I got this from uh bespoke this is the presidential election odds in poly Market Trump went up he just shot up to 60% and CA down to 40% uh or 58 to 41 in recent weeks not really um anyway politics is not my game like literally just give me a split government and we&#39;ll make money in equities but uh this is pretty pronounced and uh we&#39;ll see how it plays out according to Dr and Miller the market is is convinced that Trump is going to be elected I really did not have that level of conviction um um so we&#39;ll see what happens but uh there you go Cruise Lines credit card spend remains you know it&#39;s really here&#39;s why it&#39;s it&#39;s not I don&#39;t care about political ideology the reason that I didn&#39;t have that level conviction is it&#39;s like virtually impossible just like it was virtually impossible for Trump to get reelected because we were in a recession due to covid two quarters of negative GDP growth it&#39;s it&#39;s virtually impossible to get to not get reelected when you are in a strong economy uh it&#39;s possible but the odds are against you and given you know the question is uh the people that didn&#39;t own Assets in the last few years I.E real estate or equities uh although most many households now do through their retirement uh they haven&#39;t felt the benefit all that they&#39;ve seen is the increases in price uh on the things that they buy every day so that may be a silent majority that is causing these numbers in these objectives betting markets and polls to be skewing upwards despite the the overall economy GDP at 3.2% for this quarter GDP now uh moving higher so we will see we&#39;re prepared for all eventualities uh at the same time Equity index valuations in the US market are at the top of their long-term range while other markets are not so where can you find the best value relative to history is China and UK and Emerging Markets and

as you can see what did I say the 10-year yield was a counter Trend rally the trend is going to be down not up it's got overbought the trend is down we were saying this is a counter Trend move here here here and here now it's now it's proving to be correct same will be true with the dollar S&P broke out maybe checking back or maybe goes straight up we'll see uh we're kind of agnostic either way relatively fully invested have a little bit of cash from all the option profits uh in recent weeks but um uh we have actually built a new position on Monday uh we got a a beautiful slug in accounts that had room and new accounts um but then it started running away from us I why it's supposed to go down first before it goes up but uh it went up right away so we'll wait for that thing to take a breather and then maybe get it up to uh six or 7% position uh so so uh brand new clients know what we're talking about there and existing clients that had Rome we we've got some there too um semiconductor index so that that's that Industrials equal weight break broken out Etc okay so that's that\n\nhere is  the Article of the week liquidity plus complacency\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nstock market and sentiment results  boy we've got a lot of stuff this week uh which is exciting uh you can see the notes that we had we talked about VF Corp and Cooper standard here's the data from Morgan Stanley on Cooper standard here 16 million SAR up from 156 probably so up from the trough of 239 and uh up from the trough of 13.9 rather and uh pretty exciting it's it's and then next year they're estimating 16.2 which would be amazing so uh and I think it'll be higher next year by the way because the other thing is I don't know if you noticed Trump made a proposal not only to make gener uh not only to make generators tax deductible which would be unbelievable for gener but also to make um uh car loan interest payments tax deductible I mean it's like I sent the guy my portfolio and he's like what could I think of that would make Tom Hayes's clients even richer than they already are uh it would be unbelievable from a business standpoint uh you couldn't ask for anything more we will see uh one if he is elected and to if he can get those things through but man that would be a turbo boost for what we're trying to do here uh Baba update if you forgot what David teer said three weeks ago that he was above his position limit for China and if his number one position is Baba I think he overall has 20-some percent in China and he said if we got a pullback in coming weeks he would exceed the limit Again by adding more so here's the pullback you know what David teer is doing the question is what are you doing uh and I hope we get a little bit more weakness and uh be able to take advantage of it so here's that article 840 billion a new stimulus uh should be the number Bank of America fund manager survey update uh we put out on Tuesday here were the key points read the whole thing if you have a chance there's a lot of great data we're only going to cover five key points here the last time we saw this abrupt move a two standard deviation move out of bonds in one month was 2001 to 2003 again and which preceded some of the biggest moves in history for us small caps emerging markets in China equities so here you can see the last time you had this kind of move out of bond so abruptly again 2002 2001 2002 2003 and what happened next small caps up 165% Emerging Markets up 432 per and the hangsang up 34% in the following years um two managers are still at levels of global growth pessimism reminiscent of lows in equities they haven't been this low since uh 18 since 2009 since 2001 Etc investors reduced exposure to defensives and rotated into cyclicals this month what did we talk about last month move out of defensives and into cyclicals and that's what's happening right now materials and energy are the most underweight uh uh both about one standard deviation below their long-term average uh underweight so there's going to be some opportunities there uh we've got comto resources in that space and we will uh albam Maro on the material side and we'll look to add more uh short China equities is still the third most crowded trade this month even after the full reaming they took in September more reaming to come we're gonna get this one off the list for sure uh fear and greed got up to 70 so it's getting close to like maybe we're due for some coton consolidation now na Association of active investment managers didn't really get up to uh levels what well let's see maybe they updated it today NAA am I think they updated it tomorrow yeah they updated it tomorrow so uh moving right along uh okay blah

around please do for everyone else it&#39;s been a great hour uh okay first question comes from Robert Peters what do you think of silvaco fell sharply after guidance lowered a little over reaction from Robert Peters uh they helped somebody manufacturers with their tech software uh I&#39;m probably going to say no but let me take a look first SV Co okay so this company&#39;s been around for five minutes it&#39;s dropped from $21 down to $8 I don&#39;t invest in companies that don&#39;t have a long history of data that I can see how management operated through all different types of Cycles so uh this is an absolute no for me without even looking at the financials because there are not enough financials for me to look back at and sure we&#39;ll miss some opportunities doing that but um uh all I need to see right",
    "### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfirst image we want to talk about is the 493 to post profit growth for the second straight quarter you can see the yellow line of earnings growth converging with the black line of The Magnificent 7 uh you can see magnificent 7 which we talked about a lot was up at 50% in the first quarter of this year earnings growth UNM magnificent 493 was negative now those are moving towards the mid- teens while the mag 7 is moving down to the mid teens and you say well if the mag 7 is still going to have mid teens earnings growth and the UNM mag is going to get to Mid teens earnings growth why doesn&#39;t the mag s keep going up because the mag s was priced at 28 times earnings and the equal weight was priced at 18 so you can pay uh you know uh basically a a third 33% less for the same earnings growth if you are outside the Magnificent 7even so I hope that answers everyone&#39;s questions  that&#39;s a very important statement right there this is from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson wanted to cover this one first the it talks about how long can this bull market go it just turned two years old but it&#39;s still young and he takes all the post World War II bull markets and uh works it down to the average is 5.5 years so we&#39;re two years in and the average gain of the bull markets since post World War II bull markets is 191% and we&#39;re only at 63.8% so we&#39;ve been talking not just since 2022 since 2020 since the covid lows and many of you were with us back then now we thought this thing could run till 2030 to 2032 so for those of you who have come in as clients we&#39;ve got a lot of exciting stuff to do over the next six seven years um the other thing\n\ngoing back to 1972 when rates ease manufacturing picks up and if you get a trump in uh versus a comma you&#39;re going to see a huge increase in the amount of manufacturing that&#39;s going to be done in the US duck and Miller was out saying today that the market is you know the market is convinced that Trump is going to get uh reelected I&#39;m not sure um I you know uh I don&#39;t do politics I will say the reason we&#39;re doing the podcast early is I&#39;m going to the Al Smith dinner tomorrow night which I do uh most every year I can but in presidential years it&#39;s unbelievable because historically for you know 30 40 years you&#39;ve gotten both presidential candidates come in and uh kind of make jokes for a couple hours this year one of the candidates decided not to show up um so it&#39;ll just be Trump tomorrow and um I was uh looking forward to meeting both and I&#39;ll be happy to meet one and it&#39;ll be a fun night so um a friend asked me the other day what what do you need to be in what&#39;s the Trump trade and the number one thing that will absolutely rocket if Trump gets elected is small caps they&#39;re going to do well anyway just because the stage is set but if you look remember back to 2016 what moved Industrials small caps manufacturing related Stuff Etc so um so that&#39;s going to be uh we&#39;re we&#39;re regardless of who is elected those groups are poised to move but the amount of the move will be exacerbated by Trump uh and if you remember Chinese stocks did better than ever under Trump um despite all the threats of tariffs he is uh someone that wants to make deals and we&#39;re going to cover that Marcel Munch uh pointed out a uh oh come on why is everything log me out okay here we go HSI okay so Trump got elected in 2016 literally the the market just went straight up after he got elected absolutely straight up uh this was a double in two years so there&#39;s that and then uhmoving along  the restocking cycle which has been the the core basis of our thesis for the last year and a half since the 2022 lows it Contin to improve continues to play out as anticipated all of you remember when this was at its low when I was talking about it we&#39;re going into a restock cycle uh we&#39;re worked through the inventories and here we are it played out as anticipated which is just the beginning of a recovery 2009 to 2011 you still had nine more years of recovery how about 2000 to 2001 to 2003 ladies and gentlemen well 2003 you had the recovery and then you kept rallying for another four years same story will be the case current mortgage rate is a Tipping Point to drive refinancing uh Russell growth versus Russell value relative price to trailing EPS uh bodess well for a reversion to Value uh you can see it now moving in that direction high PE dispersion usually bodess well for Value investing uh performance of Russell over Russ growth over value so you can see the mean reversion growth to Value has been obscenely high and then you get these reversion when did you get the biggest reversion 2001 to 2007 again how many times can I say that growth versus value elevated on a PE growth covered that crowded positions in growth stocks still evident based on factors low 4p versus high uh long-term growth rate so you can see that again these are all at extremes and if you play the other side that&#39;s where big money is made if you&#39;re patient and you&#39;re not on margin so you can sit through the short-term volatility because the moves are most violent before inflection points small size neglected by active managers you can see the data by the way if you&#39;re listening to it it&#39;s unbelievable I know many of you are longtime listeners firsttime callers but if you can watch this and see the visuals I&#39;m a visual learner uh it&#39;s a big big deal so growth versus value at xco high same story here value versus growth historical discount remains extreme highest since when 2001 before you had the biggest move in the shortest period of time and going back all the way to 1982 which is another great analog for where we are right now you had the most aggressive tightening cycle that uh then uh became an easing cycle and what happened value out performed growth for literally 12 13 straight years in a row so uh positioning and valuation AR argue well for value and income dividend yield inexpensive versus history you have to go to back to all the way to when 2001 to 2003 dividend yield neglected by active managers quarterly Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20 years when&#39;s the last time you saw it that wide 2001 guys this is not rocket science if you pay attention you can make a lot of money uh over time so number of CEO changes in 2024 is on the rise this is great for what we do we&#39;ve got our Brack and Daryl we got our Shane o Kelly we got our Alex Chris there&#39;s a reason we bet on jockeys and we&#39;re patient even Baba had a change uh that&#39;s the name of the game good quality business change in management re accelerate growth good companies when they&#39;re mappr uh and uh rinse and repeat from bad breath to 67% hit rate equal weighted S&P hit new highs in 2024 leading the regular index by 3.6 percentage points in Q3 Market breath has shifted from record Narrows in 2024 to a 20-year high with 67% of stocks ahead of the index um okay Jason goord says you know who&#39;s not chasing stocks",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nthe median versus the current which uh shows the SE s in which you can find the biggest discounts uh which are most of them excluding real estate one of the structural Dynamics at play is that government debt levels are high and and Rising just like they were when in postor War II when they borrowed a lot to beat a visible enemy uh whereas this time we borrowed a lot to beat an invisible enemy and maybe more than a lot to beat an invisible enemy would be more justifiable if it was a visible enemy but it is what it is how did they get it from here down to here they inflated away they ran inflation uh 3 to 5% above Trend until 1956 this dropped down from uh 120 and change down to 60 57 by by the mid-50s and never looked back and then it infl back up it run runs in Cycles hopefully they&#39;ll do the exact same thing this time and based on their start with a 50 basis point cut and the 30 billion a month rolloff it tells me that they&#39;re playing from the same Himel next we&#39;re here this is the second week of reporting next week is the most important earnings week 33% of the S&P 500 component report next week and that&#39;s that expected versus actual results uh Fed rate Cuts this is interesting during a recession you get more rate Cuts than expected during a soft Landing you tend to get less and I think uh with the exception of 95 so we&#39;re expecting 200 basis points maybe we get less this time like 98 and like some of the other times where you have a soft landing and the amount of cuts comes in at or less than expectations so you know what are we talking about 150 would be less than expectations which would be consistent with the soft Landing like 95 like 98 uh type of scenarios households directly own 38% of all equities mutual funds own less pensions and government funds own less foreign investors own more and households own more a lot more since 2010 City economic surprise index turning up so that&#39;s a positive which we&#39;ve covered this is a chart from fund Strat about more items deflating even as core CPI flattish so 4 4% of components are now coming down in the CPI basket we expect productivity growth around 1.7% over the next few years followed by a larger Boost from artificial intelligence later this decade that&#39;s from Goldman Sachs so the the productivity Boost from AI is down the road estimates from economic research suggest that there could be a modest drag on productivity as a result of lower educational achievement that&#39;s kind of interesting and then seasonality for semiconductors a lot of people have been bearish on semis maybe justifiably so um you see conflicting data but historically November is a good month for semiconductors so just be alert to that following the election um we have exposure through Intel which we like I know you can&#39;t give it away but uh just just hang in there ladies and gentlemen uh you&#39;ve got an implicit government back stop like you had with Tesla Tesla should have been bankrupt times the government said we need EV to work the government needs a domestic Fab uh all of these companies that everyone uh praises to high heaven they don&#39;t exist without a a reliable Fab so if TSM shut down tomorrow Nvidia would be out of business AMD would out be out of business they are dependent on the kindness of strangers and Intel will be a duopoly with tsmc or oligopoly with Samsung if you want to include them in the mix but the government will stand them up and make them succeed in spite of themselves and we will benefit as Equity holders just patience Daniel Son statistical tests suggest that initial claims led the unemployment rate uh by roughly two to four months on average though they were less leading during contradictory turns okay so that&#39;s kind of a bearish thesis number of hurricanes this year so you see what&#39;s happening with J even though the number is not even normalized um so there&#39;s probably more to come and so far I&#39;ve been talking to people in Florida the amount of total loss of cars seems to be very high not even so much from Milton more from Helen with that storm surge so we&#39;ll see how that impacts and maybe that&#39;s why Morgan Stanley took up their SAR for this year from 158 in North America to 16 million and if so that&#39;s going to be very good for Cooper standard we shall see uh this is why you see consumer discretionary down uh to 2016 troughs before they recovered as well or 2021 troughs before it recovered as well food at home versus food away from home spread narrowed uh so a lot of restaurants there should be opportunity in restaurants moving forward we&#39;re trying to find some ways to express that um there are a lot lot of ways to do that so food away from home uh CP year on-year change so the prices so now that demand has come down a little bit this is the time you want to be a buyer not a seller uh food away from home the prices have gone down remember they were charging whatever they could whatever they with when the stimulus checks were out people would pay $13 for a Big Mac now they won&#39;t pay six uh and that normalizes the market shakes out the weak players and then the big get bigger again so keep an eye on that and McDonald&#39;s is telling you that story with their stock price corpor buyback authorizations year to dat have hit a record high that&#39;s very interesting because that&#39;s largely big Tech and at the same time the uh Buys in big Tech or the net buys actually the sells have been uh aggressive so just keep an eye watch what they do not what they say China equities we covered that vix tends to jump ahead of election let&#39;s see what happens the next two weeks this is the seasonality of small caps tend to be weak in an election year in the next couple of weeks right before the election like we saw in 2016 I made so much money on that they fell so much before right before the election we bought a ton of options so we&#39;ll see if we get some weakness it&#39;s actually looks like it&#39;s breaking out right now so it might already be pricing in what would be uh Trump would be more beneficial to small caps than than kamla but I think they would work irrespective of who had the executive branch so long as the Senate and the house are mixed and um and you get these big big moves small caps always do unbelievably well November and December so you want to be we are positioned for that uh companies with positive year- on-year price change uh this is what you see coming out of recoveries they come from these depression type levels in 2022 2020 2016 and 2009 and then they&#39;re Off to the Races so again seeing this stuff visually makes it easy ###

going to be a double over the next few years and then uh move beyond that xbo spin-off gxo Logistics said to explore potential sales sales so the stocks moved up we were you know pounding the table in the high 40s now it&#39;s in the low 60s uh this is somewhat disappointing to me because I got into this for a double plus uh not a trade but the rumor circulating out t\n\nhere is  the Article of the week liquidity plus complacency\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nstock market and sentiment results  boy we've got a lot of stuff this week uh which is exciting uh you can see the notes that we had we talked about VF Corp and Cooper standard here's the data from Morgan Stanley on Cooper standard here 16 million SAR up from 156 probably so up from the trough of 239 and uh up from the trough of 13.9 rather and uh pretty exciting it's it's and then next year they're estimating 16.2 which would be amazing so uh and I think it'll be higher next year by the way because the other thing is I don't know if you noticed Trump made a proposal not only to make gener uh not only to make generators tax deductible which would be unbelievable for gener but also to make um uh car loan interest payments tax deductible I mean it's like I sent the guy my portfolio and he's like what could I think of that would make Tom Hayes's clients even richer than they already are uh it would be unbelievable from a business standpoint uh you couldn't ask for anything more we will see uh one if he is elected and to if he can get those things through but man that would be a turbo boost for what we're trying to do here uh Baba update if you forgot what David teer said three weeks ago that he was above his position limit for China and if his number one position is Baba I think he overall has 20-some percent in China and he said if we got a pullback in coming weeks he would exceed the limit Again by adding more so here's the pullback you know what David teer is doing the question is what are you doing uh and I hope we get a little bit more weakness and uh be able to take advantage of it so here's that article 840 billion a new stimulus uh should be the number Bank of America fund manager survey update uh we put out on Tuesday here were the key points read the whole thing if you have a chance there's a lot of great data we're only going to cover five key points here the last time we saw this abrupt move a two standard deviation move out of bonds in one month was 2001 to 2003 again and which preceded some of the biggest moves in history for us small caps emerging markets in China equities so here you can see the last time you had this kind of move out of bond so abruptly again 2002 2001 2002 2003 and what happened next small caps up 165% Emerging Markets up 432 per and the hangsang up 34% in the following years um two managers are still at levels of global growth pessimism reminiscent of lows in equities they haven't been this low since uh 18 since 2009 since 2001 Etc investors reduced exposure to defensives and rotated into cyclicals this month what did we talk about last month move out of defensives and into cyclicals and that's what's happening right now materials and energy are the most underweight uh uh both about one standard deviation below their long-term average uh underweight so there's going to be some opportunities there uh we've got comto resources in that space and we will uh albam Maro on the material side and we'll look to add more uh short China equities is still the third most crowded trade this month even after the full reaming they took in September more reaming to come we're gonna get this one off the list for sure uh fear and greed got up to 70 so it's getting close to like maybe we're due for some coton consolidation now na Association of active investment managers didn't really get up to uh levels what well let's see maybe they updated it today NAA am I think they updated it tomorrow yeah they updated it tomorrow so uh moving right along uh

first it would separate National Security trainings from trade adjusting us trade policy to the realities of global multi-polar environment second it would resolve the trade dispute used using tried and true policies from the 1980s uh would China accept the deal obviously it has already surged outward FDI in attempt to drisk from itself too good to be true investors should remember the old adage that quote only Nixon could go to China similarly only Trump can deal with China his Democratic opponents are not allowed to allowed owing to the rigidity of the US political context should investors buy or sell something no not yet wait for the trade War his started it set in with Trump back in power and fade all the Trump trades related to the trade war in particular we would fade any

about small caps it&#39;s completely wrong about that to achieve this we propose the following um oh okay so this is the data about the international machinists have $300 million of assets relative to

is a deal to be done it'll be close to 80 or $85 uh I would prefer they didn't do it because I think it goes over a 100 over the next few years but uh you know that's a champagne problem if we make too much money too quickly we'll we'll uh find a way to redeploy uh People's Bank of China starts 71 billion liquidity tool for stock investors which was basically what teer was talking about um which is non-recourse loans to buy stocks I'm telling you this thing is going to fly I just hope we get uh get back down to 98 so we can reload the options that we took profits on uh Lululemon and Nike are less popular among teens why that's a problem so you know that's that's one of the considerations we have and why we haven't done anything with those yet that and we also own you know plenty of sneakers through uh Vans gener CEO says pressure on the power grid is only going to get worse from weather and Technology we agree um but we did hit the window with the options when it uh surg to 176 on the uh Helen fears by the rumor sell the news we haven't sold a share of stock we think it's going to work higher over the next few years and if you remember we were pounding the table well below 100 80s and now it's what whatever 175 so uh Kelly Bluebook report new vehicle prices at nq3 lower year-over-year incentive spending increases for the third straight month so this is exactly what we've been saying what would happen they would get the uh Lots back up to normal then you would see incentives then you'd see lower rates then you would see prices come down and then you'd see volume go through the roof and the oems would have a race to the bottom crushing each other with price and margins and uh Cooper standard would be smiling all the way to the bank as they just provide based on volume the lower the price gets the more incentives the more volume we're going to see because the average car on the road is over 13 years old same story and now playing out and if Morgan Stanley is correct and we're at 16 million SAR that 200,000 could be a big deal we've done some calculation it's about 150 bucks a car um and once they get over 158 the break even is basically 100% margin so you know you're talking two three bucks a share of earnings for every $200,000 of uh 200,000 cars above uh 15.8 so it's meaningful the the the key thing is not to get tied up with oh if they do 16.4 million SAR uh it'll earn six bucks and therefore I'll have a $90 stock at 15 times uh the key is is that they're going to earn well more than $7 a share well before the SAR cyclical SAR Peak that happens every cycle of 17 and a half to 18 million North American SAR we're nowhere near that and they won't have to be anywhere near that to earn seven bucks uh they could probably do it with their eyes closed at 16.8 you know with a 16 handle on it they'll be able to earn over seven bucks which is what we want to see uh and the multiples moving forward China Shores up property sector signals more spending is coming uh Boeing cut 177,000 jobs delay as jet strikes so they're basically say they're basically sending a message loud and clear to the strikers if you think you won't be part of the next 177,000 think again because you're having an impact but we're going to fight back and we'll be the last folks standing let's come to a reasonable deal and they also have Boeing has uh um filed a complaint uh filing unfair Labor practice charges against the Union uh saying that they're negotiating in bad faith and they're not being realistic uh and I think a lot of people uh looking at a sixf fig job working on an assembly line making sixf figure income and many people working very hard as well making a lot less than that and not getting 30% raises are probably looking at this similarly to how they looked at the port strikes with the head of the Union making $750,000 with Bentley's in his driveway and an 8,000 foot house and saying something doesn't smell right here so uh let's hope they come to a amicable amicable solution that benefits both parties and move on to doing what the world needs which is more planes uh why Chinese stocks will climb another 50% from current levels research CEO says that's Jeff degraph I think he's being conservative but that's naturally in the first stages coming out of the Abyss uh feds ghouls be says rates are way above normal expect more Cuts we agree this is gxo could see $85 per share in potential takeover I think that's coming from a Jeff analyst and then Alibaba lzada courts Armani delin gabana defend off shopy and tiktock in Southeast Asia so they like I said as you get the recovery all the trinket stuff goes to hell and the quality stuff Baba controls um csrc this is from Brendan Ahern over at crane shares csrc chairman

Chinese company paying dividends and buying back stock real estate stocks rows as banks in Beijing Shanghai and Shen push through a mass shortage refinancing at lower prime rate plus 30 basis points China says it has big stimulus coming but it won't say how big well we got some indication uh from Kon Global saying that it's rumored to be Six Trillion hat tip to Marcel Munch uh over on Twitter and that equates to about 840 billion us over the next three years which is monstrous monstrous tarp likee if you can consider the size of the US economy versus China and to do a tarp like stimulus uh at this stage in the recovery is absolutely amazing what if Warren Buffett had faced kamla Harris's unrealized capital gains tax from the outset here are the numbers and maybe people are starting to realize how silly some of the policies are in that um effectively Buffett would be worth 15.6 billion instead of 271 billion remember he gave about a 100 away to to uh Char it Buffett's by far the richest guy in the world the problem is uh if you care about Buffett rankings U uh Forbes rankings he gave away almost half of his money so he could be below musk and Zuckerberg and all those and Gates uh because he doesn't want to be number one because he doesn't want to get called every day so let let those guys get uh pestered every day for donations hedge fund manager who could be Trump treasury secretary says tariffs can be negotiated lower okay so they're setting the stage that they're not going to blow things up with China they're going to lean on them to benefit us workers and US businesses Boeing to sell at least 10 billion in shares to plug cash Trin we covered that Alibaba to be added to the hangsang stock connect Hong Kong index hangsang China technology index Etc we covered alibaba's Global unit pushes translation focused AI model for merchants and individual units Claudia s of the Sam rule says her namesake recession indicator may have been a false alarm this time we talked about that when it was hot Alibaba bu to invest in China's self-driving IPO how it measures up to Tesla so they already have uh this company already provided nearly 900,000 rides in China again if you want an AI ETF leaving aside all the other benefits of owning Baba uh no company has more investments in AI startups than Baba because they just say okay we'll give you cloud computing credits you give us equity in your company and uh it's it's unbelievable I think that a lot of the gains are going to be from things that we don't even know that we don't know you're going to have some of these AI startups that are thousand Baggers that we own 10% of and we don't even know that we own 10% of it and it inrees to Alibaba shareholders X urges officials to work on growth Target for fourth quarter which means if you don't make 5% I kill you and uh kidding not kidding Chinese stocks attractive but investment manager cautious before the election uh it'll be too late by the time they get certainty because the idea is don't let people in just like they didn't get let in in in September and they're not going to get let in even at 98 is not getting let in when you had a chance to buy in the 50s and 60s and 70s 98 is great but it's not it's not the same game uh",

a little early I mean let&#39;s take a look here and Ulta yeah I mean I think I think both of these are going to work the these are these are both positions that I&#39;ve done some work on and I&#39;m

to invest in SpaceX at anything below half a trillion dollars it probably makes sense as far as Robo taxes and all this other stuff it&#39;s just not what we do um we look for high quality companies that are trading at reasonable valuations that have pretty sure doubles this one you know I&#39;ve even looked at it recently and I I don&#39;t make bets on uh guessing Technologies in the future it&#39;s not where you make durable predictable money um so with that it&#39;s just I&#39;m I hope it works for musk and the world I&#39;m not going to participate\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nJim Jones with the recent rally into China as a whole do you think that ant group will IPO in 2025 yes uh probably and what would be the overall effect on the price I think the valuation goes from 30 something billion to 100 uh and that&#39;ll have a reasonable impact for Boba shareholders over time uh Bob Johnson semi longterm listener frequent contributor of mediocre IDE is until today hopefully dwl de doas group on one in stock exchange auto parts company uh joint venture Chinese spin off their metal orgy business uh I look I&#39;m telling you I&#39;ve been doing this for a while I like I&#39;m putting new clients in in Cooper standard at 13 bucks all day long yeah the ones that have been with me for a while have it at five bucks and change but uh I think 13 bucks is like unbelievable so I I wouldn&#39;t really want to mess with this at all um let me take a look at the balance sheet my guess is their balance sheet is toast based on the way the stock is trading cash flow I mean they&#39;re not even anywhere remotely near to cash flow break even so for me I&#39;m out U but keep them coming Bob I think you&#39;re going to hit a home run on the next one and let&#39;s see Jason Z Celsius

you won't be part of the next 177,000 think again because you're having an impact but we're going to fight back and we'll be the last folks standing let's come to a reasonable deal and they also have Boeing has uh um filed a complaint uh filing unfair Labor practice charges against the Union uh saying that they're negotiating in bad faith and they're not being realistic uh and I think a lot of people uh looking at a sixf fig job working on an assembly line making sixf figure income and many people working very hard as well making a lot less than that and not getting 30% raises are probably looking at this similarly to how they looked at the port strikes with the head of the Union making $750,000 with Bentley's in his driveway and an 8,000 foot house and saying something doesn't smell

uh over on Twitter and that equates to about 840 billion us over the next three years which is monstrous monstrous tarp likee if you can consider the size of the US economy versus China and to do a tarp like stimulus uh at this stage in the recovery is absolutely amazing what if Warren Buffett had faced kamla Harris's unrealized capital gains tax from the outset here are the numbers and maybe people are starting to realize how silly some of the policies are in that um effectively Buffett would be worth 15.6 billion instead of 271 billion remember he gave about a 100 away to to uh Char it
