**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Massive liquidity
- More central banks cut last month than have cut since 2020 and prior to that 2009
- Complacency
- Market voting with liquidity and beating expectations so far

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is in a mid-cycle of an 18-year secular bull market, driven by demographics (Millennials) and an easing cycle. Value will outperform growth. China and Emerging Markets offer the best value. A split government is good for the market.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Earnings Growth Expectations | 4.2% (low bar) | The market likes beating expectations. Looking out to 2025, you're looking at 15% earnings growth and margins are actually accelerating. |
| GDP Now | Up 3.2% from 2.5% | Positive sign for the economy. |
| Rail Freight Car Loadings | Up | Bodes well for a manufacturing recovery. |
| Private Client weekly outflow from T bills | Highest we've seen | Sign of risk appetite |
| Record inflow into Chinese Equity Funds | End of September | Positive for Chinese equities |
| Federal Fund Rate Changes Expected | 6 cuts | More than enough. Wouldn't be surprised if the terminal rate is 4% not 3%. |
| Total containers coming through LA | New Highs | Bodes well for retail sales. |

## Featured Company Deep Dives
### BABA – High Conviction
Baba is being added to the Hangsang family of indexes, forcing institutional buying.  It is a play on AI in China.  The Chinese government will jam so much liquidity into that market it is going to continue to go up in serious size in fits and starts.

**Key Metrics:**
- Stock Connect Hong Kong Index
- Hangsang 25 Index
- Artificial Intelligence Theme Index
- China Technology Index
- New Economy Index

**Valuation / Target:** N/A
**Action:** Buy on dips, especially if it flushes down to 98. Reload on longer dated options.  What is David Tepper doing? The question is what are you doing?

### BA – High Conviction
Boeing won't go bankrupt.  The strike will be resolved soon.  The company has a massive backlog and is in a duopoly.  The company is in the stronger position relative to the union.

**Key Metrics:**
- 23 billion in cash
- 6200 unfilled orders
- Hundreds of billions of dollars of sale of backlog
- Tens of billions of free cash flow backlog

**Valuation / Target:** N/A
**Action:** Buy. If it won't go bankrupt, it's going to be a double over the next few years.

### GXO – Medium Conviction
GXO Logistics is exploring potential sales. A deal will be close to 80 or $85. The UK is having the most amount of economic surprises to the upside.

**Key Metrics:**
- Potential takeover price of $85 per share

**Valuation / Target:** N/A
**Action:** Hold.  Tom would prefer they didn't do a deal because he thinks it goes over a 100 over the next few years.

### CRI – High Conviction
Cooper Standard will benefit from increased auto production and a recovery in the auto industry.  The lower the price gets, the more incentives, the more volume we're going to see because the average car on the road is over 13 years old.

**Key Metrics:**
- Morgan Stanley estimating 16 million SAR
- 150 bucks a car above 15.8 million SAR
- Break even is basically 100% margin

**Valuation / Target:** N/A
**Action:** Buy.  Tom is putting new clients in in Cooper standard at 13 bucks all day long.  The ones that have been with me for a while have it at five bucks and change but I think 13 bucks is like unbelievable.
