[180.519s] Neil the great Neil Cavuto on Fox
[183.879s] Business yesterday want to thank Neil
[186.28s] and Jenna D toasis for having me on and
[189.28s] my buddy Lou for making the in
[191.92s] introduction Lou Bassin uh you&#39;re
[194.56s] awesome man and um so we&#39;re going to
[197.799s] listen in here uh that&#39;s coming up 4 P
[199.959s] PM Eastern Time ahead of that we have
[201.44s] Thomas Hayes back with us the chairman
[202.84s] and managing uh member of great Hill
[205.799s] Capital always good to have Thomas he&#39;s
[207.28s] a very smart young man um what do you
[209.84s] make of what the banks first off told us
[211.84s] Thomas I mean Steady As She Goes some
[213.959s] bumps along the way but not nearly as
[216.12s] many as some feared and they are sort of
[218.4s] like a telegraphing something what yeah
[221.4s] there&#39;s no question about it Neil the
[223.239s] key here for all of earning season
[225.0s] including the banks is expectations
[226.72s] because profits were down year on year
[229.48s] in aggregate but expectations were lower
[232.28s] I think uh that&#39;s also going to be the
[234.159s] theme with the General market
[236.0s] expectations were 7.8% earnings growth
[239.079s] at the end of June they&#39;re now
[240.84s] 4.2% earnings growth so I think that&#39;s a
[243.72s] low bar that we can beat and the market
[245.599s] likes beating expectations as it relates
[247.959s] to the banks the fears were around net
[250.319s] interest income which Brian moan who you
[253.56s] show at 4:00 said uh troughed last
[256.4s] quarter so that&#39;s positive news and it
[258.12s] was more than offset by deal making
[260.919s] predominantly equity and debt issuance
[264.04s] uh as well as uh trading as well so yeah
[266.44s] I was noticing in case of Goldman sacks
[268.199s] on fire uh with all of that deal making
[270.32s] and all the hyper kinetic activity on
[272.52s] Wall Street do you ever wonder that this
[275.479s] there&#39;s almost too much gas there you
[277.84s] know we have this beautiful combination
[280.28s] right now of massive liquidity we had
[283.199s] more central banks cut last month than
[286.44s] have cut since 2020 and prior to that
[289.08s] 2009 and that&#39;s historically a good
[290.96s] thing for Equity so you have liquidity
[293.44s] plus
[294.919s] complacency uh and this could be the
[297.199s] first October for an election year where
[300.199s] we&#39;ve seen very very limited volatility
[302.56s] so I&#39;ll be interested to see what
[303.84s] happens in the next 2 weeks before the
[305.24s] election do we get any of that normal
[307.72s] chop pre-election like we usually see in
[309.639s] presidential election years or do we
[311.36s] just power through and uh right now the
[313.639s] Market&#39;s voting with liquidity and
[315.08s] beating expectation so far Donald Trump
[317.36s] has said if he doesn&#39;t win we&#39;re going
[319.72s] to have a market crash yeah what do you
[321.8s] think of that uh I think that all
[324.68s] presidents take too much credit for the
[326.72s] economy uh whether whether good or bad
[329.039s] or are find too much credit when it when
[331.0s] it&#39;s bad I think the key thing that the
[333.479s] market wants historically is checks and
[336.68s] balances so yeah we do better under a
[338.88s] split government under a split
[340.24s] government so so long as one party
[343.039s] doesn&#39;t get the presidency the Senate
[345.88s] and the house I think the Market&#39;s going
[347.639s] to like it I think you know you got GDP
[349.479s] now up 3.2% from
[352.479s] 2.5% uh you have rail freight car
[355.56s] loadings which bode well they&#39;re up that
[358.4s] bodess well for a manufactur in recovery
[360.319s] we&#39;ve been in a manufacturing depression
[362.639s] or strong recession for the last two
[364.68s] years despite the rest of the economy
[366.4s] picking up the slack you know you talk
[367.84s] about the rest of the economy I look at
[369.199s] the rest of the market used to be
[370.68s] concentrating technology technology is
[372.44s] still doing fine but it has widened out
[374.68s] considerably and hence this argument
[376.28s] that as we enter a third year of a bull
[378.56s] market uh we could easily match the
[381.12s] average length of a bull market what 5
[382.599s] and a half years some have gone on for a
[384.52s] decade or more how do you see it I love
[386.84s] it I love the broadening that&#39;s happened
[388.639s] that&#39;s a sign of Health in the market
[390.68s] and thematically what you see at the
[392.199s] beginning of an easing cycle you know we
[394.0s] just got 50 basis points where 25 26
[396.4s] days in is uh broadening so the
[399.8s] unmagnify are are now going to start to
[402.0s] outperform the Magnificent but you know
[403.72s] by the way did you notice with the
[404.96s] Magnificent Seven I was shocked when I
[406.72s] read their multiples trading at 28 times
[408.44s] earnings and and and a lot of that has
[410.52s] to do with the fact yeah the stock
[412.199s] prices have soared but earnings have
[414.759s] soared so it makes the math more
[416.8s] compelling and not nearly as nose bedy
[419.039s] as we had through the internet boom yeah
[421.039s] and I think why you&#39;re seeing the 493
[422.72s] though pick up is because the earnings
[424.56s] growth of the Magnificent 7 is
[426.52s] decelerating started the year at 50%
[428.44s] it&#39;s down to mid- teens and the
[430.599s] unmagnify were negative earnings growth
[432.8s] until the most recent quarter inflected
[434.52s] positive and they&#39;re going to move up to
[436.199s] Mid teen so that there&#39;s huge
[437.96s] opportunities on the let pursue that I
[440.08s] think you were touching on when you were
[441.24s] talking about maybe four and a half%
[442.879s] earnings growth that&#39;s off the original
[445.599s] estimates are close to double that right
[447.639s] for the S&amp;P 500 UBS has said something
[450.639s] similar out with a statement that they
[452.56s] think earnings will contract a little
[454.68s] bit not not not Go reverse but we will
[457.599s] see a sort of a tightening of that now
[459.56s] what would that mean if they&#39;re right if
[461.12s] you&#39;re right for the stocks yeah I think
[463.52s] as long as they beat the low bar of
[465.24s] expectations that that&#39;s going to be the
[467.12s] key and looking out to 2025 you&#39;re
[469.68s] looking at 15% earnings growth and
[472.12s] margins are actually accelerating so
[474.599s] we&#39;re kind of so this will be just a
[476.0s] quarter phenomenon type thing it picks
[477.919s] up as the time go I from all the data
[480.52s] that we look at it looks like a
[481.84s] short-term pause and then a re
[483.8s] acceleration and that&#39;s a function of
[485.24s] liquidity and things starting to move
[486.639s] again all right got it my friend I
[488.08s] always think that these guys play with
[489.599s] us here don&#39;t you where they say you
[491.52s] know uh we&#39;re going to have horrible
[493.44s] numbers and if you just mildly beat it I
[495.639s] pull that stunt with my parents on their
[497.28s] report card it&#39;s going to be all FS you
[499.08s] know and they see a couple of DS and C&#39;s
[500.72s] and they think I&#39;m menet Neil the secret
[502.68s] to happiness in life is low expectations
[504.8s] and that&#39;s exactly what the earnings
[506.12s] game is all about I built a career on it
[507.919s] my friend uh always good SC and I really
[510.08s] appreciate it Tom Tom excellent uncanny
[512.08s] read of these markets another uncanny
[514.68s] read of
[516.839s] politics and we&#39;re back and then I want
[520.56s] to thank Reuters for including me in
[522.479s] their article on banks yesterday as well
[525.0s] as Alison Lampert and David shepardson
[527.399s] for including me in their article on the
[530.24s] strike with regard to Boeing what I said
[533.8s] on that article was striking workers who
[535.88s] temporarily do not have a paycheck do
[538.04s] not want to become per permanent
[540.519s] unemployed work uh do not want to become
[542.959s] unemployed workers who permanently do
[545.079s] not have a paycheck I would estimate the
[547.48s] strike will be resolved within a week as
[549.079s] these workers do not want to find
[550.56s] themselves in the next batch of 177,000
[552.56s] cuts Boeing cut 17,000 people in the
[555.12s] last week uh they&#39;re raising 1010
[557.079s] billion of capital as a matter of fact
[559.2s] while we&#39;re on the subject I put this
[561.88s] post out today uh Boeing&#39;s raising $10
[564.36s] billion of equity to wait out the strike
[566.279s] that was already priced in which is why
[567.64s] the stock is up the total toal assets of
[570.6s] the International Association of M
[572.88s] machinists Union are $300 million that
[576.56s] is the magnitude of their reserves the
[579.16s] IM am is paying their members $250 a
[582.36s] week to strike while the president of
[584.6s] the Union makes
[586.04s] $330,000 and has rejected a 30% pay
[590.76s] increase for the workers and I know many
[592.279s] of you listening to this videoast
[594.519s] podcasts are like 30% raise and they&#39;re
[596.56s] not taking it uh these are six figure
[598.76s] jobs ladies and gentlemen for the most
[600.6s] part uh so the 300 million is the
[604.2s] collective assets of the 530,000 members
[608.04s] of which only 33,000 are Boeing so you
[612.079s] got to look at these other half a
[613.92s] million workers who have been
[615.16s] contributing to this fund that Boeing is
[617.72s] draining after being offered a 30% pay
[620.56s] raise uh very hard to pay mortgages and
[623.519s] car payments on $250 a week when
[626.279s] $100,000 Boeing jobs are on the table
[628.56s] and being rejected Ed by Union
[630.2s] leadership that earns hundreds of
[631.48s] thousands of dollars per year we&#39;ll be
[633.8s] interesting to see how the other half a
[635.6s] million members feel about their
[636.88s] Collective reserves being worn down by
[639.279s] the Boeing strike so I think this comes
[641.16s] to a head at the end of the day 10
[643.2s] billion versus 300 million you know who
[645.2s] has more waiting power um and uh you
[649.519s] know it seems like it&#39;s not like oh the
[652.839s] workers are wrong and Boeing&#39;s right or
[654.56s] vice versa it just seems like a a
[657.04s] reasonable offer inflation has gone up
[659.56s] much less than
[661.279s] 30% uh so 30% seems to be a reasonable
[665.32s] catchup to get everyone back on track
[667.839s] Maybe I&#39;m Wrong maybe it needs to be 35%
[670.68s] maybe it needs to be 25% but at the end
[673.279s] of the day uh Boeing is in in in the
[677.32s] stronger position here and I think this
[679.56s] is going to lead to AE and a resolution
[681.079s] and hopefully very positive for the
[682.36s] workers and and obviously very positive
[684.16s] for the company and for all the airlines
[686.24s] that depend on their planes that have
[687.88s] been waiting for those planes
[689.839s] uh moving along some clotes to the week
[692.36s] there are quite a few here uh first one
[694.68s] is from Peter Lynch I think you have to
[696.16s] learn that there&#39;s a company behind
[697.959s] every stock and that there&#39;s only one
[700.48s] real reason why stocks go up companies
[703.399s] go from doing poorly to doing well uh
[706.399s] that&#39;s our specialty and small companies
[708.68s] grow into large large companies and we
[710.36s] got a couple of those as well which is
[712.12s] exciting buffit in this same vein says
[715.16s] risk comes from not knowing what you&#39;re
[717.32s] doing uh and those are people who just
[719.6s] look at stock tickers and Chase what&#39;s
[721.32s] going up the shiny objects and then get
[723.12s] their hands heads handed to them in time
[726.279s] not always right away but uh sooner or
[728.32s] later it always happens uh and then
[730.519s] finally which is basically the ethos of
[733.0s] our entire business at Great Hill
[734.639s] Capital which is great investment
[736.92s] opportunities come around when excellent
[739.12s] companies are surrounded by unusual
[741.56s] circumstances that cause the stock to be
[744.12s] Mis appraised and that&#39;s what we
[746.32s] specialize in and that&#39;s what we try to
[748.0s] impart to our awesome uh viewing and
[751.32s] listening audience here at hedge fund
[753.12s] tips with Tom Hayes live from
[754.8s] Connecticut this week by the way so uh
[757.68s] first image we want to talk about is the
[759.959s] 493 to post profit growth for the second
[762.76s] straight quarter you can see the yellow
[764.88s] line of earnings growth converging with
[767.12s] the black line of The Magnificent 7 uh
[770.639s] you can see magnificent 7 which we
[772.56s] talked about a lot was up at 50% in the
[774.68s] first quarter of this year earnings
[776.079s] growth UNM magnificent 493 was negative
[779.24s] now those are moving towards the mid-
[780.92s] teens while the mag 7 is moving down to
[783.399s] the mid teens and you say well if the
[785.839s] mag 7 is still going to have mid teens
[787.839s] earnings growth and the UNM mag is going
[789.519s] to get to Mid teens earnings growth why
[791.76s] doesn&#39;t the mag s keep going up because
[793.68s] the mag s was priced at 28 times
[795.72s] earnings and the equal weight was priced
[797.839s] at 18 so you can pay uh you know
[802.959s] uh basically a a third 33% less for the
[807.88s] same earnings growth if you are outside
[810.639s] the Magnificent 7even so I hope that
[812.639s] answers everyone&#39;s questions that&#39;s a
[814.199s] very important statement right there
[815.8s] this is from Ryan Dietrich over at
[818.399s] Carson wanted to cover this one first
[820.959s] the it talks about how long can this
[823.16s] bull market go it just turned two years
[826.04s] old but it&#39;s still young and he takes
[829.04s] all the post World War II bull markets
[832.279s] and uh works it down to the average is
[837.04s] 5.5 years so we&#39;re two years in and the
[840.32s] average gain of the bull markets since
[842.959s] post World War II bull markets is
[846.279s] 191% and we&#39;re only at
[850.759s] 63.8% so we&#39;ve been talking not just
[854.079s] since 2022 since 2020 since the covid
[857.88s] lows and many of you were with us back
[861.44s] then now we thought this thing could run
[864.079s] till 2030 to 2032 so for those of you
[867.839s] who have come in as clients we&#39;ve got a
[869.759s] lot of exciting stuff to do over the
[871.519s] next six seven years um the other thing
[875.88s] here is uh the ranges are just I mean
[879.48s] you know 1987 to 2000 and we&#39;ve made the
[882.36s] case that we think this is mid cycle of
[884.639s] an 18e secular bull like we saw from uh
[888.32s] 48 to 68 and 82 to 2000 based on
[893.079s] demographics with the Millennials being
[895.36s] the bulk of the population at 33 34
[897.56s] years old and they&#39;re spending doesn&#39;t
[899.32s] cap out till the early 40s which gives
[901.24s] us another six seven years um and that&#39;s
[905.48s] those are the ones that you saw same
[907.399s] thing with the Boomers 87 to
[909.959s] 2000 uh 582 per um you know big big run
[917.079s] so all right and then here is the other
[921.519s] thing year three of bull markets where
[924.839s] we are now tend to be a little bit
[926.68s] weaker and that is consistent what we&#39;ve
[929.48s] been saying ladies and gentlemen which
[931.079s] is the heaviest weight would
[933.199s] underperform and the indices would
[935.6s] remain subdued so those passively
[938.279s] indexing are going to be hurt and those
[942.279s] uh that are you know exclusively in the
[943.839s] S&amp;P 500 and those that are uh stock
[947.56s] active stock picking under the surface
[949.199s] from the UNM magnificent 493 and know
[952.24s] the underlying company and know what
[953.8s] they&#39;re doing you know it&#39;s so funny
[956.16s] investing is such a funny thing um
[959.68s] in that every single day people will go
[963.079s] to get heart surgery and um and they go
[967.24s] to a heart surgeon because they&#39;re a
[968.44s] specialist who&#39;s devoted you know 20 30
[970.6s] years to seeing thousands of cases and
[973.6s] different variations and knowing the
[975.68s] rules and knowing the exceptions to the
[977.279s] rules to become a great heart surgeon uh
[980.319s] and yet no one ever walks out of surgery
[982.839s] and says uh I could do that you know
[985.839s] when their wife uh needs a heart Sur
[988.0s] heart uh procedure they never say I
[990.279s] could do that uh and yet with investing
[993.399s] you see it all the time and I would say
[997.079s] in some cases the investing results are
[1000.88s] probably as important if you know not
[1003.88s] more important than the heart surgery
[1005.48s] but but kind of up there you know money
[1007.519s] is not everything but it&#39;s right up
[1008.88s] there with oxygen so leave it at that
[1012.319s] all right so uh here is the uh some of
[1015.12s] the charts that we want to cover this
[1016.8s] week we got a huge amount of data
[1019.519s] uh let&#39;s see here if I can make this
[1022.56s] bigger some of you have asked for that
[1024.64s] and it makes it easier for me to read as
[1026.48s] well that&#39;s nice okay so let&#39;s go here
[1030.559s] uh Private Client weekly outflow from T
[1033.52s] bills is the highest we&#39;ve seen this
[1036.319s] goes all the way back to uh 2000 to 2003
[1040.64s] which we&#39;re going to see this bull bear
[1042.28s] indicator is getting really towards
[1044.0s] extreme bullish which is not um you know
[1048.16s] that&#39;s time to be a little more cautious
[1050.36s] certainly in the heaviest
[1052.28s] weights uh record inflow into Chinese
[1055.72s] Equity Funds that happened at the end of
[1057.679s] September which we said they were going
[1059.64s] to get punished all the skeptical people
[1062.52s] who got excited you know we look at Baba
[1065.039s] a lot when it got up back up to 120
[1067.4s] we&#39;re going to get smoked and I said the
[1068.919s] max pain would be if it breaks below 100
[1071.08s] it just flush out all that late money it
[1073.4s] didn&#39;t quite do that it got down to like
[1075.2s] 101 or 102 now it&#39;s now it&#39;s starting to
[1078.039s] bounce again I hope we see a flush down
[1080.4s] to 98 we&#39;ll reload on longer dated
[1082.919s] options we&#39;ve not sold a single share of
[1085.2s] stock obviously but we we made a ton of
[1087.6s] money on the options um but we wouldn&#39;t
[1090.76s] mind reloading so let&#39;s let&#39;s pray for
[1092.76s] 98 if we don&#39;t get it uh then we&#39;ll just
[1095.44s] make a ton of money on the stock and we
[1096.96s] already uh rang the register on the
[1099.0s] options so that was an exciting exciting
[1101.32s] part of uh the last quarter record
[1104.08s] outflow to from Japan Equity Funds uh
[1108.0s] remember we&#39;ve been saying this this was
[1109.76s] just a Japan has nothing going on uh
[1114.2s] this was simply a hot money flow out of
[1117.039s] China during the last two years when the
[1119.48s] government policies were unfriendly and
[1121.799s] non stimulative like the rest of the
[1123.48s] world and where Bank of Japan was
[1125.679s] stimulating every day now they&#39;ve got to
[1127.6s] Titan and this hot money is coming out
[1129.679s] of there and it&#39;s also going to come out
[1131.039s] of India by the way but first Japan
[1132.96s] because Japan has no growth prospects
[1134.84s] India&#39;s growth prospects are phenomenal
[1136.6s] for the next few decades it&#39;s just
[1138.0s] they&#39;re young they&#39;re in their 20s not
[1139.84s] their 30s we want them when they&#39;re in
[1141.159s] their early 30s that&#39;s when the game
[1143.12s] really takes off money market fund
[1145.64s] assets uh still at a record so we saw
[1148.559s] this in May 2020 these are going to
[1150.559s] start to turn down and all that money is
[1152.08s] going to be coming into equities uh so
[1154.36s] we&#39;re excited about that just like we
[1155.799s] saw in January 2009 when uh easing
[1159.88s] started quantitative easing quantitative
[1161.679s] easing which we basically have had with
[1163.84s] the runoff and now the cuts we&#39;ll
[1166.159s] probably get another 2550 basis points
[1169.12s] before the end of the year and all of
[1171.4s] our positions that we&#39;ve been talking
[1172.84s] about whether biotech which is moving
[1175.08s] whether uh China what are Emerging
[1177.799s] Markets small caps we&#39;re all predicated
[1179.6s] on the easing cycle at beginning and as
[1181.96s] amazing as it&#39;s been the last few weeks
[1184.12s] it&#39;s just gotten started we&#39;re only 26
[1186.6s] 27 days in ladies and gentlemen so uh
[1190.039s] cool stuff The Price is Right cha
[1192.039s] Traders chasing China stocks but
[1194.159s] allocator skeptical a big inflection
[1195.96s] point especially ahead of the US
[1197.76s] election we buy any China dips as policy
[1200.44s] makers saying Capital markets to be used
[1202.96s] aggressively to boost domestic animal
[1205.08s] spirits and demand and expect China gbt
[1209.76s] GDP upgrades from 4.6% China bond yields
[1213.28s] up from 2% Florida to Spur asset
[1215.64s] allocation into China which we talked
[1217.88s] about we wanted to see Rising Yuan which
[1219.799s] we&#39;ve started to see we wanted to see
[1221.72s] Rising bond yields which we started to
[1223.72s] see this is all stuff that we had been
[1226.44s] talking about in recent months that is
[1228.84s] now playing out go back to the tapes
[1232.559s] CPI um two-year percentage change so it
[1236.679s] hasn&#39;t dropped this precipitously since
[1238.88s] the beginning of the secular bull market
[1241.039s] from 1982 to
[1243.36s] 2000 uh s same exact story you can see
[1246.799s] here see here and uh we covered Ryan
[1250.799s] Dietrich
[1252.72s] stuff uh okay manufacturing continues to
[1255.76s] struggle while Services stay resilient
[1258.28s] uh this is changing though because if
[1261.159s] you look at rail freight car loads
[1264.039s] and uh also overlay manufacturing pmis
[1268.52s] to rate declines that tends easing
[1271.72s] Cycles tend to Spur manufacturing so
[1274.12s] this will come back this is just coming
[1275.679s] off the floor like you saw in 2011 and
[1279.12s] like you saw in when 2001 to 2003 ladies
[1282.2s] and gentlemen my favorite uh analog
[1284.159s] which I cover I don&#39;t know 20 times
[1286.039s] every single week for the last five
[1288.08s] months
[1289.279s] uh percentage of country with Services
[1291.559s] PMI above 50 so this is what a recovery
[1294.039s] looks like the beginning stages of a
[1295.919s] recovery not the end stages of a
[1297.76s] recovery accelerated recovery in Us free
[1301.2s] liquidity augur well for Equity markets
[1303.44s] so this liquidity M2 money supply uh
[1306.64s] easing cycle just beginning just
[1308.84s] starting to turn up and consumer expects
[1311.88s] 4% earnings growth in Q3 consensus
[1315.44s] rather they&#39;ve set the bar low like I
[1317.4s] talked about with Neil so they will beat
[1319.559s] it they&#39;re already at 5% largely fueled
[1321.679s] by Banks uh and we&#39;ll probably finish up
[1324.919s] 6% probably 2% points maybe two and a
[1328.48s] half to three percentage points above
[1330.64s] the 4.2% expectations which will be good
[1333.84s] enough for government work S&amp;P 500
[1337.12s] companies beating consensus expectations
[1339.0s] so you can see by sector uh this is
[1342.159s] pause before re acceleration seven out
[1344.159s] of 11 sectors are expected to see
[1346.2s] decelerated earnings growth in Q3
[1348.64s] followed by reaccelerating earnings
[1350.52s] growth in Q4 which is why we&#39;ve been
[1352.44s] talking about consumer discretionary and
[1355.279s] this creates an enormous opportunity
[1357.72s] moving
[1359.08s] forward it&#39;s all about demand watch rate
[1361.919s] sensitive sectors historically volume
[1364.039s] drove margins operating leverage
[1366.679s] cyclical sectors have exhibited biggest
[1369.159s] operating leverage energy consumer
[1371.08s] discretionary Cooper standard just
[1373.08s] kidding but not kidding not kidding uh
[1376.0s] Industrials materials and Tech moving
[1378.2s] into 2025 we expect a healthy volume
[1380.44s] recovery and Manufacturing Goods sectors
[1382.36s] that have been pressured by higher rates
[1384.159s] which should translate into upside EPS
[1386.24s] driven driving driven by operating
[1389.159s] leverage your Stanley Black and&amp; Deckers
[1391.559s] your janer racks your Cooper standards
[1395.159s] uh your gxo You Name It We got it uh
[1399.799s] demand recovery equals higher margins
[1402.799s] which is Awesome by the way the uh the
[1405.84s] rumors of
[1409.12s] um the rumors of margin demise have been
[1413.48s] greatly exaggerated they&#39;re holding up
[1415.12s] higher than ever energy consumer
[1418.0s] discretionary Industrials materials and
[1419.679s] Tech have historically had high
[1422.4s] leverage uh easing rate pressure should
[1426.12s] translate into a pickup in manufacturing
[1427.96s] so you can see here throughout history
[1429.279s] going back to
[1430.76s] 1972 when rates ease manufacturing picks
[1433.88s] up and if you get a trump in uh versus a
[1438.039s] comma you&#39;re going to see a huge
[1440.32s] increase in the amount of manufacturing
[1442.12s] that&#39;s going to be done in the US duck
[1444.559s] and Miller was out saying today that the
[1447.0s] market is you know the market is
[1448.96s] convinced that Trump is going to get uh
[1450.76s] reelected I&#39;m not sure um I you know uh
[1456.2s] I don&#39;t know that&#39;s not that&#39;s not what
[1457.64s] I do I I don&#39;t do politics I will say
[1459.799s] the reason we&#39;re doing the podcast early
[1461.36s] is I&#39;m going to the Al Smith dinner
[1462.88s] tomorrow night which I do uh most every
[1467.159s] year I can but in presidential years
[1469.48s] it&#39;s unbelievable because historically
[1471.84s] for you know 30 40 years you&#39;ve gotten
[1474.52s] both presidential candidates come in and
[1477.72s] uh kind of make jokes for a couple hours
[1479.6s] this year one of the candidates decided
[1481.279s] not to show up um so it&#39;ll just be Trump
[1484.799s] tomorrow and um I was uh looking forward
[1488.64s] to meeting both and I&#39;ll be happy to
[1489.96s] meet one and it&#39;ll be a fun night so
[1493.76s] um a friend asked me the other day what
[1497.12s] what do you need to be in
[1499.52s] what&#39;s the Trump trade
[1502.399s] and the number one thing that will
[1505.12s] absolutely rocket if Trump gets elected
[1508.08s] is small caps they&#39;re going to do well
[1510.799s] anyway just because the stage is set but
[1513.32s] if you look remember back to 2016 what
[1515.88s] moved Industrials small caps
[1519.24s] manufacturing related Stuff Etc so um so
[1522.799s] that&#39;s going to be uh we&#39;re we&#39;re
[1526.44s] regardless of who is elected
[1529.64s] those groups are poised to move but the
[1532.039s] amount of the move will be exacerbated
[1534.32s] by Trump uh and if you remember Chinese
[1536.679s] stocks did better than ever under Trump
[1540.159s] um despite all the threats of tariffs he
[1543.6s] is uh someone that wants to make deals
[1545.76s] and we&#39;re going to cover that Marcel
[1547.84s] Munch uh pointed out a
[1552.52s] uh oh come on why is everything log me
[1556.08s] out okay here we go
[1559.24s] HSI okay
[1561.76s] so Trump got elected in
[1564.44s] 2016
[1566.2s] literally the the market just went
[1568.2s] straight up after he got elected
[1569.919s] absolutely straight up uh this was a
[1571.84s] double in two years so there&#39;s that and
[1575.72s] then uh moving along the restocking
[1579.44s] cycle which has been the the core basis
[1582.919s] of our thesis for the last year and a
[1584.88s] half since the 2022 lows it Contin to
[1588.799s] improve continues to play out as
[1590.679s] anticipated all of you remember when
[1592.76s] this was at its low when I was talking
[1594.64s] about it we&#39;re going into a restock
[1596.279s] cycle uh we&#39;re worked through the
[1599.0s] inventories and here we are it played
[1601.6s] out as anticipated which is just the
[1603.52s] beginning of a recovery 2009 to 2011 you
[1606.399s] still had nine more years of recovery
[1608.919s] how about 2000 to 2001 to 2003 ladies
[1612.039s] and gentlemen well 2003 you had the
[1614.399s] recovery and then you kept rallying for
[1615.919s] another four years same story will be
[1617.72s] the case current mortgage rate is a
[1619.559s] Tipping Point to drive
[1622.399s] refinancing uh Russell growth versus
[1624.919s] Russell value relative price to trailing
[1630.32s] EPS uh bodess well for a reversion to
[1636.0s] Value uh you can see it now moving in
[1638.52s] that
[1639.6s] direction high PE dispersion usually
[1642.36s] bodess well for Value
[1644.44s] investing uh performance of Russell over
[1648.679s] Russ growth over value so you can see
[1650.64s] the mean reversion growth to Value has
[1653.559s] been obscenely high and then you get
[1655.679s] these reversion when did you get the
[1657.159s] biggest reversion 2001 to 2007 again how
[1661.399s] many times can I say that growth versus
[1663.48s] value elevated on a PE growth covered
[1666.279s] that crowded positions in growth stocks
[1668.559s] still evident based on factors low 4p
[1671.679s] versus high uh long-term growth rate so
[1674.799s] you can see that again these are all at
[1676.48s] extremes and if you play the other side
[1678.84s] that&#39;s where big money is made if you&#39;re
[1680.44s] patient and you&#39;re not on margin so you
[1682.08s] can sit through the short-term
[1683.679s] volatility because the moves are most
[1685.279s] violent before inflection
[1689.12s] points small size neglected by active
[1692.279s] managers you can see the data by the way
[1695.0s] if you&#39;re listening to it it&#39;s
[1696.08s] unbelievable I know many of you are
[1697.32s] longtime listeners firsttime callers but
[1699.799s] if you can watch this and see the
[1701.679s] visuals I&#39;m a visual learner uh it&#39;s a
[1704.64s] big big deal so growth versus value at
[1706.84s] xco high same story here value versus
[1709.799s] growth historical discount remains
[1711.48s] extreme highest since when
[1714.36s] 2001 before you had the biggest move in
[1716.519s] the shortest period of time and going
[1718.2s] back all the way to 1982 which is
[1720.44s] another great analog for where we are
[1722.519s] right now you had the most aggressive
[1724.559s] tightening cycle that uh then uh became
[1727.919s] an easing cycle and what happened value
[1729.559s] out performed growth for literally 12 13
[1733.0s] straight years in a row so uh
[1735.44s] positioning and valuation AR argue well
[1738.12s] for value and income dividend yield
[1740.84s] inexpensive versus history you have to
[1742.919s] go to back to all the way to when 2001
[1745.279s] to
[1746.36s] 2003 dividend yield neglected by active
[1749.0s] managers quarterly Market breath in Q3
[1751.279s] was the widest in 20 years when&#39;s the
[1753.24s] last time you saw it that wide 2001 guys
[1757.0s] this is not rocket science if you pay
[1759.88s] attention you can make a lot of money uh
[1763.44s] over time so number of CEO changes in
[1766.399s] 2024 is on the rise this is great for
[1770.36s] what we do we&#39;ve got our Brack and Daryl
[1773.039s] we got our Shane o Kelly we got our Alex
[1775.64s] Chris there&#39;s a reason we bet on jockeys
[1778.12s] and we&#39;re patient even Baba had a change
[1781.88s] uh that&#39;s the name of the game good
[1783.64s] quality business change in management re
[1786.399s] accelerate growth good companies when
[1788.76s] they&#39;re
[1789.64s] mappr uh and uh rinse and repeat from
[1793.08s] bad breath to
[1794.64s] 67% hit rate equal weighted S&amp;P hit new
[1798.2s] highs in 2024 leading the regular index
[1800.519s] by 3.6 percentage points in Q3 Market
[1804.24s] breath has shifted from record Narrows
[1806.039s] in 2024 to a 20-year high with 67% of
[1810.0s] stocks ahead of the
[1812.48s] index
[1817.679s] um okay Jason goord says you know who&#39;s
[1821.76s] not chasing stocks here is insiders
[1824.039s] corporate Executives among S&amp;P 500 firms
[1826.88s] have some of the least open Market
[1828.24s] purchases in 13
[1830.76s] years so he&#39;s saying that that&#39;s case
[1833.96s] for a short-term consolidation I
[1836.72s] wouldn&#39;t disagree it wouldn&#39;t surprise
[1838.44s] me to see some some level of
[1840.399s] consolidation uh certainly in the higher
[1843.24s] weighted companies in the indices where
[1845.159s] you&#39;ve seen the lowest Insider buying
[1846.84s] and the highest corporate BuyBacks where
[1848.6s] that tells you everything you need to
[1849.84s] know uh saying one thing in doing
[1852.32s] something else both the mag 7 and other
[1855.279s] 493 okay slow in Q3 accelerate and
[1859.12s] Beyond covered that now this is
[1861.84s] interesting so this was uh I think I got
[1865.519s] this from uh bespoke this is the
[1869.88s] presidential election odds in poly
[1872.2s] Market Trump went up he just shot up to
[1875.399s] 60% and CA down to
[1878.2s] 40% uh or 58 to 41 in recent weeks not
[1883.48s] really
[1885.12s] um anyway politics is not my game like
[1888.0s] literally just give me a split
[1889.159s] government and we&#39;ll make money in
[1890.32s] equities but uh this is pretty
[1892.559s] pronounced and uh we&#39;ll see how it plays
[1895.159s] out according to Dr and Miller the
[1897.44s] market is is convinced that Trump is
[1899.96s] going to be elected I really did not
[1903.559s] have that level of
[1905.399s] conviction
[1907.44s] um um so we&#39;ll see what happens but uh
[1912.6s] there you go Cruise Lines credit card
[1914.44s] spend remains you know it&#39;s really
[1917.24s] here&#39;s why it&#39;s it&#39;s
[1920.559s] not I don&#39;t care about political
[1923.399s] ideology the reason that I didn&#39;t have
[1925.279s] that level conviction is it&#39;s like
[1927.519s] virtually
[1929.48s] impossible just like it was virtually
[1931.559s] impossible for Trump to get reelected
[1933.399s] because we were in a recession due to
[1934.96s] covid two quarters of negative GDP
[1936.72s] growth it&#39;s it&#39;s virtually impossible to
[1940.32s] get to not get reelected when you are in
[1943.96s] a strong economy uh it&#39;s possible but
[1947.639s] the odds are against you and given you
[1950.679s] know the question
[1952.72s] is uh the people that didn&#39;t own Assets
[1956.0s] in the last few years I.E real estate or
[1959.12s] equities uh although most many
[1961.36s] households now do through their
[1963.559s] retirement uh they haven&#39;t felt the
[1965.799s] benefit all that they&#39;ve seen is the
[1968.72s] increases in price uh on the things that
[1972.0s] they buy every day so that may be a
[1974.159s] silent majority that is causing these
[1976.559s] numbers in these objectives betting
[1978.36s] markets and polls to be skewing upwards
[1981.679s] despite the the overall economy GDP at
[1984.44s] 3.2% for this quarter GDP now uh moving
[1988.0s] higher so we will see we&#39;re prepared for
[1991.08s] all eventualities uh at the same time
[1993.48s] Equity index valuations in the US market
[1995.279s] are at the top of their long-term range
[1996.96s] while other markets are not so where can
[2001.519s] you find the best value relative to
[2003.679s] history is China and UK and Emerging
[2007.32s] Markets
[2008.36s] and Europe so that&#39;s where we&#39;re focused
[2011.88s] S&amp;P 500 companies beating consensus we
[2014.159s] covered that here is federal fund rate
[2017.32s] changes expected over the next 12 months
[2019.799s] at its peak a few months ago people were
[2022.12s] expecting 10 cuts now they&#39;re expecting
[2025.0s] six Cuts I think that actually makes a
[2027.08s] lot more sense 25 bips six times maybe
[2030.24s] two times before the end of the year and
[2031.76s] once a quarter next year it should be
[2033.159s] more than
[2034.559s] enough it wouldn&#39;t be surprise me if the
[2037.399s] econom is strong enough that the
[2039.039s] terminal ratees 4% not 3% that&#39;s
[2041.44s] non-consensus but we&#39;ll just put it out
[2043.72s] there our corporate misery index fell to
[2046.279s] negative Q3 in the F for the first time
[2048.8s] since 1 Q
[2051.56s] 2021 that is normal after you have these
[2055.24s] rebounds you have these steep spikes
[2057.76s] huge things because your comps are
[2059.8s] higher just like you had in 2012 so if
[2062.879s] you sold in 2012 on this basis you got
[2065.32s] smoked because you had a eight more
[2068.079s] years of a bull run same thing in the
[2070.24s] 80s you had this huge recovery from 81
[2073.599s] then you retest it down at 89 and you
[2075.76s] had 11 more years left in the bull
[2077.2s] market so that&#39;s not necessarily A Bad
[2078.919s] Thing uh Korean exports remain strong
[2081.679s] that&#39;s usually barometer for the global
[2083.8s] economy on a sector comparison stocks in
[2086.48s] Europe&#39;s trade on much bigger discounts
[2088.119s] than they&#39; have typically done in the
[2089.44s] past that creates opportunity ladies and
[2091.8s] gentlemen the light blue here is the
[2093.839s] median versus the current which uh shows
[2097.119s] the SE s in which you can find the
[2098.92s] biggest discounts uh which are most of
[2101.88s] them excluding real estate one of the
[2104.44s] structural Dynamics at play is that
[2106.28s] government debt levels are high and and
[2107.96s] Rising just like they were when in
[2111.16s] postor War II when they borrowed a lot
[2113.04s] to beat a visible enemy uh whereas this
[2116.88s] time we borrowed a lot to beat an
[2118.28s] invisible enemy and maybe more than a
[2120.88s] lot to beat an invisible enemy would be
[2123.4s] more justifiable if it was a visible
[2125.119s] enemy but it is what it is how did they
[2126.96s] get it from here down to here they
[2128.72s] inflated away they ran inflation uh 3 to
[2131.48s] 5% above Trend until 1956 this dropped
[2134.76s] down from uh 120 and change down to 60
[2138.839s] 57 by by the mid-50s and never looked
[2142.32s] back and then it infl back up it run
[2144.76s] runs in Cycles hopefully they&#39;ll do the
[2146.48s] exact same thing this time and based on
[2149.079s] their start with a 50 basis point cut
[2151.24s] and the 30 billion a month rolloff it
[2153.44s] tells me that they&#39;re playing from the
[2155.0s] same Himel next
[2158.96s] we&#39;re here this is the second week of
[2160.68s] reporting next week is the most
[2162.04s] important earnings week 33% of the S&amp;P
[2164.88s] 500 component report next week and
[2168.4s] that&#39;s that expected versus actual
[2172.319s] results uh Fed rate Cuts this is
[2175.64s] interesting during a
[2178.68s] recession you get more rate Cuts than
[2182.44s] expected during a soft Landing you tend
[2184.96s] to get less and I think uh with the
[2188.56s] exception of 95 so we&#39;re
[2193.76s] expecting 200 basis points maybe we get
[2197.4s] less this time like 98 and like some of
[2200.119s] the other times where you have a soft
[2202.119s] landing and the amount of cuts comes in
[2205.76s] at or less than expectations so you know
[2208.88s] what are we talking about 150 would be
[2210.72s] less than expectations which would be
[2212.2s] consistent with the soft Landing like 95
[2215.079s] like 98 uh type of scenarios households
[2218.16s] directly own 38% of all equities mutual
[2221.839s] funds own less pensions and government
[2223.839s] funds own less foreign investors own
[2226.119s] more and households own more a lot more
[2231.079s] since
[2233.52s] 2010 City economic surprise index
[2236.04s] turning up so that&#39;s a positive which
[2238.68s] we&#39;ve covered this is a chart from fund
[2241.8s] Strat about more items deflating even as
[2245.2s] core CPI flattish so 4 4% of components
[2249.0s] are now coming down in the CPI basket we
[2252.76s] expect productivity growth around 1.7%
[2255.319s] over the next few years followed by a
[2256.839s] larger Boost from artificial
[2258.8s] intelligence later this decade that&#39;s
[2261.359s] from Goldman Sachs so the the
[2264.24s] productivity Boost from AI is down the
[2266.72s] road estimates from economic research
[2268.8s] suggest that there could be a modest
[2270.2s] drag on productivity as a result of
[2271.92s] lower educational achievement that&#39;s
[2274.76s] kind of interesting and then seasonality
[2277.2s] for semiconductors a lot of people have
[2278.92s] been bearish on
[2282.56s] semis maybe justifiably
[2285.4s] so um you see conflicting data but
[2288.24s] historically November is a good month
[2289.839s] for semiconductors so just be alert to
[2292.2s] that following the election um we have
[2295.52s] exposure through Intel which we like I
[2297.52s] know you can&#39;t give it away but uh just
[2300.52s] just hang in there ladies and gentlemen
[2302.96s] uh you&#39;ve got an implicit government
[2304.48s] back stop like you had with Tesla Tesla
[2306.4s] should have been bankrupt times the
[2308.4s] government said we need EV to work the
[2310.44s] government needs a domestic Fab uh all
[2313.119s] of these companies that everyone uh
[2315.8s] praises to high heaven they don&#39;t exist
[2318.76s] without a a reliable Fab so if TSM shut
[2321.96s] down tomorrow Nvidia would be out of
[2324.04s] business AMD would out be out of
[2325.64s] business they are dependent on the
[2327.28s] kindness of strangers and Intel will be
[2330.16s] a duopoly with tsmc or oligopoly with
[2335.119s] Samsung if you want to include them in
[2336.72s] the mix but the government will stand
[2338.76s] them up and make them succeed in spite
[2340.68s] of themselves and we will benefit as
[2342.72s] Equity holders just patience Daniel Son
[2345.52s] statistical tests suggest that initial
[2347.52s] claims led the unemployment rate uh by
[2350.44s] roughly two to four months on average
[2351.96s] though they were less leading during
[2353.8s] contradictory
[2355.48s] turns okay so that&#39;s kind of a bearish
[2357.88s] thesis number of hurricanes this year so
[2360.359s] you see what&#39;s happening with J even
[2362.48s] though the number is not even
[2364.68s] normalized um
[2368.119s] so there&#39;s probably more to come and so
[2370.599s] far I&#39;ve been talking to people in
[2372.04s] Florida the amount of total loss of cars
[2373.96s] seems to be very high not even so much
[2376.2s] from Milton more from Helen with that
[2378.04s] storm surge so we&#39;ll see how that
[2380.56s] impacts and maybe that&#39;s why Morgan
[2382.52s] Stanley took up their SAR for this year
[2385.079s] from 158 in North America to 16 million
[2389.68s] and if so that&#39;s going to be very good
[2391.28s] for Cooper standard we shall see uh this
[2394.599s] is why you see consumer discretionary
[2396.56s] down
[2398.48s] uh to 2016 troughs before they recovered
[2401.64s] as well or 2021 troughs before it
[2404.2s] recovered as well food at home versus
[2407.319s] food away from home spread
[2409.599s] narrowed uh so a lot of restaurants
[2411.88s] there should be opportunity in
[2413.68s] restaurants moving forward we&#39;re trying
[2415.48s] to find some ways to express that
[2421.119s] um there are a lot lot of ways to do
[2423.44s] that so food away from home uh
[2428.319s] CP year on-year change so the prices so
[2431.56s] now that demand has come down a little
[2433.04s] bit this is the time you want to be a
[2434.24s] buyer not a seller uh food away from
[2437.4s] home the prices have gone down remember
[2439.359s] they were charging whatever they could
[2441.079s] whatever they with when the stimulus
[2442.52s] checks were out people would pay $13 for
[2444.96s] a Big Mac now they won&#39;t pay six uh and
[2447.56s] that normalizes the market shakes out
[2449.2s] the weak players and then the big get
[2451.4s] bigger again so keep an eye on that and
[2454.16s] McDonald&#39;s is telling you that story
[2455.64s] with their stock price corpor buyback
[2457.88s] authorizations year to dat have hit a
[2459.48s] record high that&#39;s very interesting
[2461.64s] because that&#39;s largely big Tech and at
[2464.079s] the same time the uh Buys in big Tech or
[2467.04s] the net buys actually the sells have
[2469.359s] been uh aggressive so just keep an eye
[2472.68s] watch what they do not what they say
[2474.92s] China equities we covered that vix tends
[2477.88s] to jump ahead of election let&#39;s see what
[2479.4s] happens the next two weeks this is the
[2481.599s] seasonality of small caps tend to be
[2484.4s] weak in an election year in the next
[2486.359s] couple of weeks right before the
[2487.88s] election like we saw in 2016 I made so
[2490.56s] much money on that they fell so much
[2492.68s] before right before the election we
[2494.839s] bought a ton of options so we&#39;ll see if
[2497.119s] we get some weakness it&#39;s actually looks
[2498.64s] like it&#39;s breaking out right now so it
[2500.48s] might already be pricing in what would
[2503.56s] be uh Trump would be more beneficial to
[2505.92s] small caps than than kamla but I think
[2508.92s] they would work irrespective of who had
[2511.119s] the executive branch so long as the
[2513.2s] Senate and the house are mixed and um
[2516.16s] and you get these big big moves small
[2518.16s] caps always do unbelievably well
[2520.4s] November and December so you want to be
[2522.359s] we are positioned for that uh companies
[2525.04s] with positive year- on-year price
[2527.72s] change uh this is what you see coming
[2529.839s] out of recoveries they come from these
[2531.359s] depression type levels in 2022 2020 2016
[2537.72s] and 2009 and then they&#39;re Off to the
[2540.16s] Races so again seeing this stuff
[2542.04s] visually makes it easy uh Baba is going
[2545.28s] to now be added to
[2548.079s] the hangsang family of indexes so that&#39;s
[2550.96s] going to force a lot of institutional
[2552.48s] money into Baba stock which will be the
[2554.88s] stock connect Hong Kong index the
[2557.559s] hangsang 25 index the artificial
[2560.079s] intelligence theme index so anyone
[2561.88s] wanting to play AI in China they&#39;re
[2563.319s] going to be a wait in that index and the
[2565.52s] China technology index and the new
[2567.44s] economy index and that goes into effect
[2569.28s] on the October 28th so there&#39;ll be a
[2571.52s] bunch of new buyers in addition to the
[2573.319s] stock connect which now they represent
[2575.16s] 2.8% of all the shares which is a big
[2578.52s] buying in a short amount of time that is
[2580.319s] going to continue as the new stimulus
[2582.24s] rolls out small caps iwm is bullish
[2585.2s] triangle breakout to watch uh above its
[2588.599s] 40 and 200 we moving averages this is
[2590.96s] from Bank of America so it just says
[2593.96s] small caps are finally breaking out they
[2595.72s] were the lagger now they&#39;re turning into
[2597.319s] the leader and this is a whatever cup
[2599.64s] and handle which means measured move
[2601.44s] would imply another 80 points on top of
[2604.2s] that so we&#39;ve got a long way to go
[2606.079s] ladies and gentlemen this is just just
[2607.28s] getting started uh this is from Marcel
[2609.88s] Munch found this uh article
[2613.119s] from BC Alpha looks like Trump will make
[2616.559s] a deal with China investors are over
[2619.72s] indexing to Trump&#39;s rhetoric on tariffs
[2622.4s] focusing on statements he made earlier
[2623.92s] this year or in his first te and
[2625.92s] ignoring the significant change in his
[2629.079s] signaling uh at the Republican National
[2631.44s] Convention only use the word tariff
[2633.079s] twice and only in the context of forcing
[2634.72s] China to relocate manufacturing capacity
[2636.76s] from Mexico to the US yes former China
[2640.04s] uh former president Donald Trump is
[2642.0s] talking about attracting Chinese FDI if
[2645.28s] it acted upon it would be revolutionary
[2647.16s] change in the US China trade
[2648.44s] relationship first it would separate
[2649.76s] National Security trainings from trade
[2651.68s] adjusting us trade policy to the
[2653.079s] realities of global multi-polar
[2654.48s] environment second it would resolve the
[2655.839s] trade dispute used using tried and true
[2658.839s] policies from the
[2660.24s] 1980s uh would China accept the deal
[2662.64s] obviously it has already surged outward
[2664.44s] FDI in attempt to drisk from itself too
[2667.2s] good to be true investors should
[2668.2s] remember the old adage that quote only
[2670.359s] Nixon could go to China similarly only
[2672.68s] Trump can deal with China his Democratic
[2674.8s] opponents are not allowed to allowed
[2677.48s] owing to the rigidity of the US
[2679.4s] political context should investors buy
[2681.52s] or sell something no not yet wait for
[2683.16s] the trade War his started it set in with
[2685.76s] Trump back in power and fade all the
[2687.8s] Trump trades related to the trade war in
[2690.16s] particular we would fade any
[2691.68s] appreciation yeah so in the U I would
[2694.48s] fade uh any appreciation in US dollar
[2697.24s] induced by the start of the trade War
[2698.96s] that&#39;s a counter Trend move that&#39;s going
[2700.24s] to fall apart he&#39;s also talking about
[2701.68s] small caps it&#39;s completely wrong about
[2703.4s] that to achieve this we propose the
[2706.119s] following
[2708.72s] um oh okay so this is the data about the
[2712.16s] international machinists have $300
[2714.52s] million of assets relative to Boeing
[2717.559s] who&#39;s raising another 10 billion they
[2719.68s] they can wait him out these are the
[2721.839s] assets
[2723.48s] here uh moving along seasonal composite
[2726.44s] October 1 to December 31st that is uh in
[2731.04s] election year so here we are October
[2733.319s] 16th you tend to get more choppiness
[2735.68s] into the end of the month before you
[2737.04s] rally into the end of the year let&#39;s see
[2738.599s] what
[2739.76s] happens we covered that from
[2744.319s] Carson uh that&#39;s consumption this
[2748.079s] is uh high yield o OAS spreads
[2753.119s] uh are close to record lows so that&#39;s
[2755.76s] going to be good for
[2758.599s] uh Cooper sandard to refinance and other
[2761.0s] small caps companies to refinance here
[2763.2s] is another poll since this has really
[2767.44s] just turned up since October 9th or 10th
[2769.72s] I trying to think what exactly happened
[2771.8s] on October 9th or 10th must have been an
[2774.0s] interview or something but uh it just
[2777.119s] went straight up for Trump and straight
[2778.599s] down for kamla we&#39;ll see again these
[2780.76s] things betting odds polls no one knows
[2782.88s] until they know uh retail foot traffic
[2786.079s] on a continuous upward Trend which has
[2788.8s] been a big deal this is compared to 2019
[2792.92s] and it just keeps marching higher that&#39;s
[2795.0s] very positive for things like Vans uh
[2797.319s] things like goose and other special
[2800.16s] calendar days saw a visit boost across
[2802.68s] all retail
[2804.119s] categories uh this is uh SNP also from
[2808.359s] Bank of America implying a 5930 move for
[2811.559s] the S&amp;P 500 we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s going to
[2814.119s] happen all at once or it could also go
[2815.8s] back and retest the break breakout
[2817.24s] levels before moving up time will
[2820.64s] tell moving along China growth
[2823.079s] expectations surge to most optimistic
[2825.24s] since April 2023 this is the end of
[2828.119s] early October so they were super bearish
[2830.28s] in September then you got the first
[2832.319s] batch of the stimulus now they&#39;re
[2834.4s] getting very optimistic and uh as you
[2837.72s] can see they don&#39;t tend to get
[2838.92s] optimistic for nothing it tends to
[2840.52s] persist and persist and persist uh this
[2843.48s] is the boom bus semiconductor cycle uh
[2847.52s] this implies that you know you could
[2849.359s] have a downturn which would hurt the
[2851.2s] nvidias and the amds again Intel would
[2854.319s] probably draw more tension away from
[2856.2s] gpus and back to CPUs where Intel has a
[2859.68s] stronghold uh so I think we&#39;re insulated
[2862.119s] if this proves to be correct but again
[2865.0s] here&#39;s one two three instances is not
[2867.24s] the best uh amount to draw a hard and
[2870.319s] fast conclusion S&amp;P sector returns
[2872.96s] during soft Landing fed uh policies
[2875.319s] healthc care tends to dramatic ically
[2877.599s] outperform uh and financials PayPal is a
[2880.0s] financial ladies and gentlemen uh
[2882.48s] Healthcare would include biotech which
[2884.68s] is moved quite a lot it&#39;s been
[2886.359s] consolidating I think we&#39;re getting
[2887.559s] ready for the next move up which is
[2889.4s] going to be awesome we&#39;ve been in that
[2890.839s] position for a while nice to see uh it
[2893.88s] moving but uh just getting started and
[2897.28s] profits from non Financial corporate
[2898.88s] business excess liquidity leading
[2901.079s] indicator push forward so we&#39;re seeing
[2903.559s] that the increas liquidity is going to
[2905.04s] lead to more increased profit here the
[2907.04s] profit margins we were discussing near
[2909.0s] record highs at 15% everyone was saying
[2912.28s] these margins are unsustainable here
[2914.04s] here and here and yet they just keep
[2915.8s] climbing higher small cap exposures come
[2918.64s] down dramatically from 50% down to it
[2922.28s] looks like 18% in the last 10 years this
[2925.079s] is going to mean revert ig&#39;s corporate
[2927.96s] OAS spreads we covered here&#39;s a bigger
[2930.92s] chart and almost done here with the
[2933.76s] data uh this is the Goldman Sachs
[2937.319s] economic surprise index what countries
[2939.88s] are having the most amount of economic
[2941.96s] surprises to the upside UK ladies and
[2944.24s] gentlemen are gxo
[2946.28s] Logistics uh and um tiny position in a
[2950.96s] ASAS started to spring up we&#39;ll see we
[2953.24s] haven&#39;t added to it yet but we&#39;re we&#39;re
[2956.04s] looking at it and then uh us Russia of
[2959.839s] all things that&#39;s kind of interesting
[2962.799s] Canada US Australia Etc and what&#39;s
[2965.64s] having the worst economic surprises
[2967.559s] India and Japan have been having
[2969.68s] negative surprises where everyone is
[2971.24s] crowded and where no one&#39;s crowded and
[2973.48s] China is starting to turn up positive we
[2976.16s] covered the retail foot traffic uh
[2978.52s] trainer this is interesting total
[2980.559s] containers coming through La at new
[2982.92s] highs bodess well for retail sales
[2985.839s] ladies and gentlemen so that helps all
[2988.119s] of your consumer discretionary in case
[2989.839s] you were wondering excess liquidity will
[2991.72s] turn higher if stimulus is working this
[2993.92s] relates to China this is going to start
[2996.72s] turn higher and then let&#39;s look at the
[2999.559s] sler stuff from RBC this is from today
[3003.64s] and as you can see what did I say the
[3005.92s] 10-year yield was a counter Trend rally
[3009.599s] the trend is going to be down not up
[3013.359s] it&#39;s got overbought the trend is down we
[3016.24s] were saying this is a counter Trend move
[3018.2s] here here here and here now it&#39;s now
[3019.76s] it&#39;s proving to be correct same will be
[3021.799s] true with the dollar S&amp;P broke out maybe
[3024.88s] checking back or maybe goes straight up
[3026.68s] we&#39;ll see uh we&#39;re kind of agnostic
[3028.92s] either way relatively fully invested
[3031.559s] have a little bit of cash from all the
[3033.319s] option profits uh in recent weeks but um
[3037.48s] uh we have actually built a new position
[3039.68s] on Monday uh we got a a beautiful
[3045.359s] slug in accounts that had room and new
[3048.16s] accounts um but then it started running
[3050.68s] away from us I
[3054.04s] why it&#39;s supposed to go down first
[3057.079s] before it goes up but uh it went up
[3059.44s] right away so we&#39;ll wait for that thing
[3061.4s] to take a breather and then maybe get it
[3063.079s] up to uh six or 7% position uh so so uh
[3068.4s] brand new clients know what we&#39;re
[3069.559s] talking about there and existing clients
[3071.48s] that had Rome we we&#39;ve got some there
[3073.44s] too um semiconductor index so that
[3077.96s] that&#39;s that Industrials equal weight
[3081.24s] break broken out Etc okay so that&#39;s that
[3084.72s] moving along five numbers that explain
[3086.88s] why bone go won&#39;t go bankrupt by Al rout
[3089.4s] we know 23 billion in cash in last
[3093.119s] quarter 6200 unfilled orders uh hundreds
[3097.839s] of billions of dollars of sale of
[3099.28s] backlog tens of billions of free cash
[3101.04s] flow
[3103.28s] backlog uh two this is a great article
[3106.68s] by the way by Al root he&#39;s one of the
[3108.119s] best over at Barons by the way uh no I
[3110.559s] was a little tough on one of the other
[3112.079s] writers but uh this Al rout is is uh
[3115.44s] money good that guy just gets it right
[3117.559s] all the time um backlogs are one thing
[3121.16s] further demand is another industry still
[3123.079s] in good shape Airbus estimates the world
[3125.24s] will require
[3127.079s] 42,43 planes over the next 20 years and
[3129.68s] they&#39;ve got already 88500 unfulfilled
[3132.88s] orders so they&#39;re going to have half of
[3134.2s] that because it&#39;s is duopoly so they got
[3135.68s] another 21,000 behind the 8,500 they
[3138.079s] haven&#39;t filled and you can&#39;t give away
[3139.319s] the stock you can&#39;t make this stuff up
[3141.88s] ah ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s kind of
[3143.44s] funny anyway 13 points
[3147.92s] six
[3150.559s] billion it&#39;s easy to see Boeing
[3152.52s] delivering more than 800 Jets a year
[3155.28s] Boeing delivered 806 in 2018 that
[3157.599s] generated 136.6 billion of free cash
[3160.2s] flow that year I mean it&#39;s just what a
[3163.319s] great article by the
[3164.839s] way look that up at Baron five numbers
[3167.76s] that explain why Boeing won&#39;t go
[3169.079s] bankrupt and if it won&#39;t go bankrupt
[3170.64s] it&#39;s going to be a double over the next
[3171.76s] few years and then uh move beyond that
[3174.559s] xbo spin-off gxo Logistics said to
[3176.88s] explore potential sales sales so the
[3179.4s] stocks moved up we were you know
[3181.24s] pounding the table in the high 40s now
[3183.2s] it&#39;s in the low
[3185.04s] 60s uh this is somewhat disappointing to
[3187.96s] me because I got into this for a double
[3189.96s] plus uh not a trade but the rumor
[3192.88s] circulating out there is that if there
[3194.88s] is a deal to be done it&#39;ll be close to
[3197.64s] 80 or
[3199.28s] $85 uh I would prefer they didn&#39;t do it
[3202.2s] because I think it goes over a 100 over
[3203.799s] the next few years but uh you know
[3206.559s] that&#39;s a champagne problem if we make
[3208.319s] too much money too quickly we&#39;ll we&#39;ll
[3210.359s] uh find a way to redeploy uh People&#39;s
[3213.28s] Bank of China starts 71 billion
[3215.28s] liquidity tool for stock investors which
[3217.079s] was basically what teer was talking
[3219.319s] about um which is non-recourse loans to
[3222.0s] buy stocks I&#39;m telling you this thing is
[3223.599s] going to fly I just hope we get uh get
[3226.0s] back down to 98 so we can reload the
[3227.92s] options that we took profits on uh
[3230.079s] Lululemon and Nike are less popular
[3232.28s] among teens why that&#39;s a problem so you
[3234.24s] know that&#39;s that&#39;s one of the
[3235.599s] considerations we have and why we
[3237.2s] haven&#39;t done anything with those yet
[3239.0s] that and we also own you know plenty of
[3240.96s] sneakers through uh Vans gener CEO says
[3245.119s] pressure on the power grid is only going
[3246.559s] to get worse from weather and Technology
[3248.319s] we agree um but we did hit the window
[3251.359s] with the options when it uh surg to 176
[3254.44s] on the uh Helen fears by the rumor sell
[3257.2s] the news we haven&#39;t sold a share of
[3258.88s] stock we think it&#39;s going to work higher
[3260.119s] over the next few years and if you
[3262.079s] remember we were pounding the table well
[3264.079s] below 100 80s and now it&#39;s what whatever
[3266.68s] 175 so uh Kelly Bluebook report new
[3270.4s] vehicle prices at nq3 lower
[3272.64s] year-over-year incentive spending
[3274.799s] increases for the third straight month
[3276.48s] so this is exactly what we&#39;ve been
[3278.04s] saying what would happen they would get
[3280.079s] the uh Lots back up to normal then you
[3282.359s] would see incentives then you&#39;d see
[3283.76s] lower rates then you would see prices
[3285.76s] come down and then you&#39;d see volume go
[3287.28s] through the roof and the oems would have
[3289.48s] a race to the bottom crushing each other
[3291.48s] with price and margins and uh Cooper
[3294.359s] standard would be smiling all the way to
[3296.599s] the bank as they just provide based on
[3298.72s] volume the lower the price gets the more
[3300.599s] incentives the more volume we&#39;re going
[3302.2s] to see because the average car on the
[3303.559s] road is over 13 years old same story and
[3306.92s] now playing out and if Morgan Stanley is
[3310.079s] correct and we&#39;re at 16 million SAR that
[3313.44s] 200,000 could be a big deal we&#39;ve done
[3316.64s] some calculation it&#39;s about 150 bucks a
[3319.88s] car um and once they get over 158 the
[3323.039s] break even is basically 100% margin so
[3326.44s] you know you&#39;re talking two three bucks
[3328.28s] a share of earnings for every
[3332.0s] $200,000 of uh 200,000 cars above uh
[3337.88s] 15.8 so it&#39;s meaningful the the the key
[3340.96s] thing is not to
[3342.559s] get tied up with oh if they do 16.4
[3348.0s] million SAR uh it&#39;ll earn six bucks and
[3351.4s] therefore I&#39;ll have a $90 stock at 15
[3353.92s] times uh the key is is that they&#39;re
[3357.839s] going to earn well more than $7 a share
[3361.24s] well before the SAR cyclical SAR Peak
[3365.64s] that happens every cycle of 17 and a
[3367.48s] half to 18 million North American SAR
[3370.24s] we&#39;re nowhere near that and they won&#39;t
[3371.799s] have to be anywhere near that to earn
[3373.2s] seven bucks uh they could probably do it
[3375.48s] with their eyes closed at 16.8 you know
[3380.559s] with a 16 handle on it they&#39;ll be able
[3382.319s] to earn over seven bucks which is what
[3383.76s] we want to see uh and the multiples
[3386.64s] moving forward China Shores up property
[3388.839s] sector signals more spending is coming
[3392.16s] uh Boeing cut 177,000 jobs delay as jet
[3396.28s] strikes so they&#39;re basically say they&#39;re
[3397.96s] basically sending a message loud and
[3399.44s] clear to the strikers if you think you
[3401.44s] won&#39;t be part of the next 177,000 think
[3403.96s] again because you&#39;re having an impact
[3406.16s] but we&#39;re going to fight back and we&#39;ll
[3408.119s] be the last folks standing let&#39;s come to
[3410.92s] a reasonable deal and they also have
[3414.48s] Boeing has uh um filed a complaint uh
[3418.76s] filing unfair Labor practice charges
[3420.799s] against the
[3421.92s] Union uh saying that they&#39;re negotiating
[3424.2s] in bad faith and they&#39;re not being
[3426.2s] realistic uh and I think a lot of
[3431.0s] people uh looking at a sixf fig job
[3434.76s] working on an assembly line making sixf
[3436.799s] figure income and many people working
[3439.92s] very hard as well making a lot less than
[3441.88s] that and not getting 30% raises are
[3443.839s] probably looking at this similarly to
[3445.52s] how they looked at
[3446.839s] the port strikes with the head of the
[3450.28s] Union making $750,000 with Bentley&#39;s in
[3453.039s] his driveway and an 8,000 foot house and
[3455.24s] saying something doesn&#39;t smell right
[3457.319s] here so uh let&#39;s hope they come to a
[3460.0s] amicable amicable solution that benefits
[3463.039s] both parties and move on to doing what
[3465.64s] the world needs which is more planes uh
[3468.52s] why Chinese stocks will climb another
[3470.28s] 50% from current levels research CEO
[3472.64s] says that&#39;s Jeff degraph I think he&#39;s
[3474.4s] being conservative but that&#39;s naturally
[3476.2s] in the first stages coming out of the
[3478.24s] Abyss uh feds ghouls be says rates are
[3481.599s] way above normal expect more Cuts we
[3483.72s] agree this is gxo could see $85 per
[3486.64s] share in potential takeover I think
[3489.16s] that&#39;s coming from a Jeff
[3491.28s] analyst and then Alibaba lzada courts
[3494.24s] Armani delin gabana defend off shopy and
[3497.28s] tiktock in Southeast Asia so they like I
[3499.72s] said as you get the recovery all the
[3502.2s] trinket stuff goes to hell and the
[3504.52s] quality stuff Baba controls
[3512.559s] um csrc this is from Brendan Ahern over
[3516.16s] at crane shares csrc chairman woo King
[3519.359s] will give a speech at the 2024 Financial
[3521.88s] Street Forum annual meeting on October
[3523.599s] 18th in Beijing he&#39;s expected to speak
[3525.96s] to the nine National measures supporting
[3527.96s] corporate governance including Chinese
[3530.119s] company paying dividends and buying back
[3532.24s] stock real estate stocks rows as banks
[3534.48s] in Beijing Shanghai and Shen push
[3536.4s] through a mass shortage refinancing at
[3538.0s] lower prime rate plus 30 basis points
[3541.599s] China says it has big stimulus coming
[3543.559s] but it won&#39;t say how big well we got
[3545.839s] some indication uh from Kon Global
[3549.4s] saying that it&#39;s rumored to be Six
[3551.799s] Trillion hat tip to Marcel Munch uh over
[3555.359s] on Twitter and that equates to about 840
[3559.0s] billion us over the next three years
[3562.319s] which is monstrous monstrous tarp likee
[3565.559s] if you can consider the size of the US
[3567.799s] economy versus China and to do a tarp
[3570.039s] like stimulus uh at this stage in the
[3572.96s] recovery is absolutely amazing what if
[3575.039s] Warren Buffett had faced kamla Harris&#39;s
[3577.839s] unrealized capital gains tax from the
[3580.319s] outset here are the numbers and maybe
[3581.72s] people are starting to realize how silly
[3583.28s] some of the policies are in that um
[3587.16s] effectively Buffett would be worth 15.6
[3589.839s] billion instead of 271 billion remember
[3593.119s] he gave about a 100 away to to uh Char
[3595.88s] it Buffett&#39;s by far the richest guy in
[3597.52s] the world the problem is uh if you care
[3599.96s] about Buffett rankings U uh Forbes
[3602.68s] rankings he gave away almost half of his
[3604.96s] money so he could be below musk and
[3607.48s] Zuckerberg and all those and Gates uh
[3609.799s] because he doesn&#39;t want to be number one
[3610.96s] because he doesn&#39;t want to get called
[3611.839s] every day so let let those guys get uh
[3614.799s] pestered every day for donations hedge
[3617.0s] fund manager who could be Trump treasury
[3618.76s] secretary says tariffs can be negotiated
[3622.24s] lower okay so they&#39;re setting the stage
[3624.4s] that they&#39;re not going to blow things up
[3625.559s] with China they&#39;re going to lean on them
[3627.119s] to benefit us workers and US businesses
[3631.0s] Boeing to sell at least 10 billion in
[3633.0s] shares to plug cash Trin we covered that
[3635.44s] Alibaba to be added to the hangsang
[3637.319s] stock connect Hong Kong index hangsang
[3639.76s] China technology index Etc we covered
[3642.2s] alibaba&#39;s Global unit pushes translation
[3644.52s] focused AI model for merchants and
[3646.4s] individual units Claudia s of the Sam
[3649.24s] rule says her namesake recession
[3651.0s] indicator may have been a false alarm
[3652.96s] this time we talked about that when it
[3654.52s] was hot Alibaba bu to invest in China&#39;s
[3657.28s] self-driving IPO how it measures up to
[3659.76s] Tesla so they already have uh this
[3663.2s] company already provided nearly 900,000
[3665.92s] rides in China again if you want an AI
[3668.88s] ETF leaving aside all the other benefits
[3670.839s] of owning Baba uh no company has more
[3673.799s] investments in AI startups than Baba
[3676.76s] because they just say okay we&#39;ll give
[3678.64s] you cloud computing credits you give us
[3680.48s] equity in your company and uh it&#39;s it&#39;s
[3683.079s] unbelievable I think that a lot of the
[3685.24s] gains are going to be from things that
[3686.48s] we don&#39;t even know that we don&#39;t know
[3688.2s] you&#39;re going to have some of these AI
[3689.559s] startups that are thousand Baggers that
[3691.599s] we own 10% of and we don&#39;t even know
[3693.96s] that we own 10% of it and it inrees to
[3696.28s] Alibaba shareholders X urges officials
[3699.119s] to work on growth Target for fourth
[3700.92s] quarter which means if you don&#39;t make 5%
[3703.799s] I kill you and uh kidding not kidding
[3707.92s] Chinese stocks attractive but investment
[3709.96s] manager cautious before the election uh
[3712.839s] it&#39;ll be too late by the time they get
[3714.599s] certainty because the idea is don&#39;t let
[3717.4s] people in just like they didn&#39;t get let
[3719.2s] in in in September and they&#39;re not going
[3720.88s] to get let in even at 98 is not getting
[3722.92s] let in when you had a chance to buy in
[3724.4s] the 50s and 60s and 70s 98 is great but
[3727.96s] it&#39;s not it&#39;s not the same game uh here
[3731.44s] is the Article of the week liquidity
[3733.0s] plus complacency stock market and
[3734.599s] sentiment
[3736.079s] results boy we&#39;ve got a lot of stuff
[3738.319s] this week uh which is exciting uh you
[3740.96s] can see the notes that we had we talked
[3742.64s] about VF Corp and Cooper standard here&#39;s
[3744.799s] the data from Morgan Stanley on Cooper
[3747.52s] standard here 16 million SAR up from 156
[3751.119s] probably so up from the trough of
[3754.64s] 239 and uh up from the trough of 13.9
[3759.079s] rather and uh pretty exciting it&#39;s it&#39;s
[3762.799s] and then next year they&#39;re estimating
[3765.0s] 16.2 which would be amazing so uh and I
[3768.319s] think it&#39;ll be higher next year by the
[3769.64s] way because the other thing is I don&#39;t
[3771.96s] know if you noticed Trump made a
[3773.839s] proposal not only to make gener uh not
[3777.52s] only to make generators tax deductible
[3780.319s] which would be unbelievable for gener
[3782.76s] but also to make um uh car loan interest
[3787.48s] payments tax deductible I mean it&#39;s like
[3789.52s] I sent the guy my portfolio and he&#39;s
[3791.16s] like what could I think of that would
[3792.48s] make Tom Hayes&#39;s clients even richer
[3794.64s] than they already are uh it would be
[3796.76s] unbelievable from a business standpoint
[3799.44s] uh you couldn&#39;t ask for anything more we
[3801.64s] will see uh one if he is elected and to
[3806.2s] if he can get those things through but
[3808.559s] man that would be a turbo boost for what
[3811.16s] we&#39;re trying to do here uh Baba update
[3814.44s] if you forgot what David teer said three
[3816.2s] weeks ago that he was above his position
[3818.599s] limit for China and if his number one
[3820.96s] position is Baba I think he overall has
[3823.039s] 20-some percent in China and he said if
[3825.279s] we got a pullback in coming weeks he
[3826.92s] would exceed the limit Again by adding
[3828.64s] more so here&#39;s the pullback you know
[3830.72s] what David teer is doing the question is
[3832.319s] what are you doing uh and I hope we get
[3835.0s] a little bit more weakness and uh be
[3837.72s] able to take advantage of it so here&#39;s
[3839.64s] that article 840 billion a new stimulus
[3843.16s] uh should be the number Bank of America
[3845.559s] fund manager survey update uh we put out
[3848.52s] on Tuesday here were the key
[3851.24s] points read the whole thing if you have
[3853.599s] a chance there&#39;s a lot of great data
[3855.119s] we&#39;re only going to cover five key
[3856.4s] points here the last time we saw this
[3858.4s] abrupt move a two standard deviation
[3860.559s] move out of bonds in one month was 2001
[3863.72s] to 2003 again and which preceded some of
[3866.839s] the biggest moves in history for us
[3868.119s] small caps emerging markets in China
[3869.839s] equities so here you can see the last
[3871.96s] time you had this kind of move out of
[3873.48s] bond so abruptly again 2002 2001 2002
[3878.48s] 2003 and what happened next small caps
[3880.92s] up 165% Emerging Markets up 432 per and
[3885.319s] the hangsang up
[3886.88s] 34% in the following years um two
[3891.16s] managers are still at levels of global
[3892.88s] growth pessimism reminiscent of lows in
[3896.559s] equities they haven&#39;t been this low
[3898.68s] since uh 18 since 2009 since 2001 Etc
[3904.2s] investors reduced exposure to defensives
[3906.24s] and rotated into cyclicals this month
[3909.2s] what did we talk about last month move
[3912.359s] out of defensives and into cyclicals and
[3914.44s] that&#39;s what&#39;s happening right now
[3916.16s] materials and energy are the most
[3918.4s] underweight uh uh both about one
[3920.76s] standard deviation below their long-term
[3922.88s] average uh underweight so there&#39;s going
[3925.079s] to be some opportunities there uh we&#39;ve
[3927.92s] got comto resources in that space and we
[3931.24s] will uh albam Maro on the material side
[3934.359s] and we&#39;ll look to add more uh short
[3937.16s] China equities is still the third most
[3939.599s] crowded trade this month even after the
[3942.4s] full reaming they took in September more
[3945.319s] reaming to come we&#39;re gonna get this one
[3947.599s] off the list for sure uh fear and greed
[3950.279s] got up to 70 so it&#39;s getting close to
[3952.4s] like maybe we&#39;re due for some coton
[3954.4s] consolidation now na Association of
[3956.48s] active investment managers didn&#39;t really

[4042.359s] Emerging Markets it&#39;s value uh value
[4045.119s] over growth uh so that&#39;s that on to so
[4048.64s] the podcast is over we&#39;re going to start
[4050.76s] the ask me anything question section for
[4053.319s] those of you like to stick around please
[4055.4s] do for everyone else it&#39;s been a great
[4057.44s] hour uh okay first
[4061.0s] question comes from Robert Peters what
[4065.359s] do you think of
[4066.72s] silvaco fell sharply after guidance
[4068.96s] lowered a little over
[4070.559s] reaction from Robert
[4073.24s] Peters uh they helped somebody
[4075.799s] manufacturers with their tech
[4078.0s] software uh I&#39;m probably going to say no
[4082.319s] but let me take a look
[4085.039s] first
[4089.119s] SV
[4093.4s] Co okay so this company&#39;s been around
[4095.599s] for five minutes it&#39;s dropped from $21
[4098.08s] down to $8 I don&#39;t invest in companies
[4101.719s] that don&#39;t have a long history of data
[4105.279s] that I can see how management operated
[4107.239s] through all different types of Cycles so
[4109.6s] uh this is an absolute no for me without
[4112.04s] even looking at the financials because
[4113.56s] there are not enough financials for me
[4115.279s] to look back at and sure we&#39;ll miss some
[4117.239s] opportunities doing that but
[4120.199s] um uh all I need to see right here is
[4124.64s] negative free cash flow and that&#39;s
[4126.0s] enough for me so uh no pass it&#39;s a
[4128.44s] trading vehicle not an investing vehicle
[4130.48s] but thank you for sending that
[4133.159s] in uh
[4136.44s] Ben Stiller okay uh yeah okay Ben
[4140.719s] Stiller I know you&#39;re a fan of Brad
[4142.839s] Jacobs do you ever invest in companies
[4144.52s] like qxo well we talked about it at the
[4146.48s] podcast we do have a position in qxo at
[4149.359s] 11:57 and uh pretty big one at that so
[4152.92s] on to the next
[4155.159s] question uh Caleb L lesby uh thank you
[4159.319s] for all the great content and insight
[4160.839s] what are your thoughts on Dollar
[4164.239s] Tree uh uh if you don&#39;t want to discuss
[4166.759s] that I&#39;d love your thoughts on Ulta as a
[4168.4s] dad with a daughter I got to believe
[4169.759s] they are making money good money thanks
[4172.44s] again sir from KB lesby uh I got my eye
[4175.52s] on both of them I&#39;m not doing anything
[4177.279s] on either but they do fall in the area
[4180.08s] of consumer discretionary that I want to
[4182.719s] be in and uh I think you&#39;ve got a keen
[4186.679s] nose and uh you&#39;ll probably rewrite on
[4191.12s] both of them but um I think it&#39;s a
[4194.12s] little early
[4197.239s] I mean let&#39;s take a look here and
[4204.159s] Ulta yeah I mean I think I think both of
[4206.8s] these are going to work the these are
[4208.32s] these are both positions that I&#39;ve done
[4210.08s] some work on and I&#39;m just kind of
[4212.719s] waiting and watching I mean the whole
[4215.4s] thing here is you know in order to
[4218.36s] outperform you&#39;re never going to
[4219.56s] overperform out very hard to outperform
[4222.04s] with more than 15 positions and we
[4223.64s] usually try to run h 12 or 13 uh so the
[4227.56s] good is the better enemy the better is
[4229.4s] the enemy the best so we can put new
[4232.0s] positions in uh you know newer
[4234.84s] portfolios that we don&#39;t want to put
[4236.199s] them into positions that have already
[4237.679s] run 50 60 70% for existing clients um so
[4242.4s] that&#39;s where names like this can come to
[4244.12s] play uh and then as we Harvest other
[4247.0s] things that have gone up a lot like a
[4249.12s] bunch of the options in gener and Baba
[4251.6s] and all that stuff uh then we can start
[4253.52s] to put them into names like this but I
[4254.92s] do like both of these names I think
[4256.6s] they&#39;re both going to work for you
[4257.84s] whether today is the day to buy some or
[4260.4s] or two months from now I can&#39;t tell you
[4262.28s] that but I think if you have a Long View
[4264.32s] I think you&#39;re in good shape and uh well
[4267.12s] done Caleb uh Sam
[4269.96s] R what&#39;s your thoughts on Chinese
[4272.239s] people&#39;s sentiment not following the
[4273.88s] Bazooka stimulus uh there&#39;s no evidence
[4276.159s] of that I mean someone sent me a a
[4278.36s] message about lvmh was down because of
[4281.4s] China like look at some point people get
[4283.76s] tired of $30,000 handbag let them take a
[4286.159s] break let them look at the 20 in their
[4288.04s] closet and get tired of that after the
[4289.88s] next two months and they&#39;ll be back out
[4292.08s] buying Ferraris and lvmh Handbags once
[4294.96s] again uh it&#39;s just not going to be
[4296.84s] tomorrow so this idea about sentiment
[4299.28s] and stuff this is short-term noise the
[4301.76s] bottom line is the government&#39;s going to
[4303.32s] CH Jam so much liquidity into that
[4306.0s] market it is going to continue to go up
[4308.92s] in serious size in fits and starts Matt
[4312.199s] hollerin asking about Cooper standard
[4315.719s] um yeah look it&#39;s it&#39;s not a perfect
[4319.04s] formula but yes the margins are very
[4321.679s] high because all the fixed costs are in
[4323.04s] and the parts are very cheap once you
[4324.48s] get about
[4326.159s] 15.8 um it&#39;s about 150 a car so that&#39;s
[4329.92s] what I would use but that doesn&#39;t
[4331.44s] include all the pricing concessions that
[4333.44s] they gained uh which they renegotiate
[4335.84s] every year or two uh so it&#39;s an
[4338.199s] imperfect formula but I think the
[4341.12s] $3 uh every two 300,000 cars is the way
[4345.76s] to look at it and um I think it&#39;s going
[4349.36s] to be better than most people expect so
[4351.76s] uh so that&#39;s round numbers it you can&#39;t
[4353.88s] be that precise because as that money
[4356.88s] starts to flow in management will screw
[4358.48s] it up so it&#39;s not going to be perfect uh
[4360.96s] but it&#39;s going to be better well better
[4363.56s] the key here Matt is working with a
[4367.04s] crayon not a scalpel and my view is
[4372.719s] that uh you&#39;ll probably get to $67 a
[4377.4s] share and earnings between 16 half and
[4379.44s] 17 A5 uh Sor 16 A5 USR and
[4384.6s] 17 versus what it took in past cycles of
[4388.48s] 17 and a half to 18 to get to the same
[4390.96s] earnings power because of how well
[4392.639s] they&#39;ve got the business set up now for
[4394.28s] the next inflection so that&#39;s all you
[4396.28s] need to know you&#39;re not going to get it
[4397.96s] oneto one uh in that way but um
[4402.6s] certainly I think the first few hundred,
[4404.28s] cars is going to to uh shock a lot of
[4406.52s] people and that&#39;s where the the biggest
[4408.52s] bulk of that is Garrett hi Tom always
[4411.32s] the highlight of my week to listen to
[4412.44s] the podcast thank you as so few in the
[4414.6s] hedge fund Asset Management industry
[4416.8s] offer such a service I was wondering if
[4418.679s] you had a read on lvmh after earnings it
[4422.28s] seems like it this also hinges on
[4424.04s] China&#39;s thesis yeah I mean you know the
[4427.199s] issue with this one is that it&#39;s going
[4429.56s] to
[4431.52s] trade I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s and that&#39;s the
[4434.4s] other issue I have with buying Lulu or
[4437.36s] Nike is it&#39;s just a double you know you
[4440.88s] you want to try to
[4442.56s] have a couple handfuls less than a dozen
[4446.96s] as uncorrelated bets as you can get uh
[4450.28s] SO
[4453.56s] trading
[4455.92s] lvmh and owning Baba in
[4459.28s] size you&#39;re kind of doing the same thing
[4461.92s] it&#39;s a bet on China&#39;s recovery so if you
[4464.76s] don&#39;t have Baba then you should take a
[4466.4s] good look at lvmh if you have baba you
[4468.56s] kind of it&#39;s It&#39;s kind of the the same
[4472.28s] trade
[4476.679s] um only not as good so I think you&#39;re
[4482.639s] there I think you&#39;re a hair hair early
[4485.159s] on that one Philip
[4488.12s] leair your podcast have been very
[4490.239s] insightful keep up the great work
[4491.639s] thoughts on
[4494.0s] dxcm I think this is a diabetes thing if
[4497.0s] I&#39;m not
[4498.639s] mistaken we&#39;ve looked at this one in the
[4501.76s] past
[4514.6s] um the gross their margins are declining
[4518.08s] materially but their revenues keep going
[4520.08s] up so you got to understand what how are
[4522.36s] these margins going to start to recover
[4523.84s] I mean there&#39;s still decent Mar at 63%
[4526.28s] but they&#39;re falling off a cliff even as
[4529.0s] cash flow recoveries let&#39;s see what is
[4531.199s] this software or is this diabetes it&#39;s
[4533.56s] probably soft medical device
[4536.0s] company continuous glucose monitoring
[4538.56s] systems in the US and
[4541.92s] internationally yeah so just figure out
[4544.12s] what their mode is if you remember
[4545.239s] Baxter got rid of that business
[4553.0s] um I think you&#39;re probably be okay that
[4556.28s] was sold off in line with the glp scare
[4559.52s] I like the idea I think you really got
[4561.76s] to understand what they have and how
[4563.76s] it&#39;s Unique and uh and then go from
[4566.679s] there but as far as everyone getting on
[4568.239s] gp1s and losing weight and and not being
[4570.6s] diabetic anymore uh the data we looked
[4573.0s] at during the scare showed that uh
[4576.28s] virtually the
[4578.4s] uh these things are going to be
[4580.159s] annuities it&#39;s like owning cigarette
[4581.719s] companies they&#39;re going to keep
[4582.76s] generating cash they&#39;re going to keep
[4584.239s] buying back stuff stock so you&#39;re
[4585.8s] probably okay with that one without
[4587.199s] doing the work in other words I&#39;m saying
[4589.32s] go ahead and do the work start listening
[4590.6s] to the conference call start reading the
[4592.36s] annual report start doing Channel checks
[4594.12s] on competition etc etc Maas
[4598.04s] beckard uh just saw you talked about
[4600.4s] Intel trading at tangible book meaning
[4602.56s] if it got liquidated you&#39;d get back
[4604.12s] around $20 a share very comfortable yet
[4606.36s] here in Germany a small B battery
[4608.08s] manufacturing mostly for apple airpods
[4610.44s] is bankrupt but they do not pay tangible
[4612.639s] book to shareholders instead they
[4614.0s] confiscate the shares them shareholders
[4616.0s] are left with nothing no compensation
[4618.08s] this is according to German law called
[4620.159s] stug sounds like a bland joke about
[4622.679s] communist Community blah blah blah are
[4625.84s] you aware of similar laws in the US
[4632.48s] no okay trying to learn more from David
[4635.08s] I heard he had problems with
[4636.32s] Russian Bonds in 1998 government let
[4638.56s] them
[4641.8s] toall okay so Matias number one the guy
[4645.0s] compounded money in over 20% for decades
[4648.92s] one of the few in the world uh so he had
[4651.639s] a bad trade with Russian bonds like you
[4654.56s] know happens on to the next uh what
[4657.84s] about the other 300 trades that he did
[4660.48s] well it&#39;s so funny while we&#39;ve been
[4661.84s] waiting for Baba to work we probably put
[4663.44s] out a dozen double pluses on this
[4665.48s] podcast and everyone&#39;s focused on Baba
[4667.6s] and so excited that it moves 40 bucks it
[4669.679s] hasn&#39;t even started yet and and people
[4672.28s] are so excited about that but the other
[4674.6s] does doz or so double pluses that no one
[4676.76s] cares about I mean you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh
[4680.48s] you can&#39;t make this stuff up so the
[4682.239s] point is is look this is America if
[4684.639s] there&#39;s excess Equity after the bond
[4686.44s] holders are paid you get it back in the
[4688.56s] case of Intel there would be and in the
[4691.239s] case of that ever happening that&#39;s
[4692.679s] Looney Tunes it did 52 billion in
[4694.719s] Revenue the government&#39;s backstopping it
[4696.639s] they need the Fabs and that&#39;s the whole
[4698.28s] story not whether you get back your 20
[4699.92s] bucks as far as what happens in
[4701.719s] socialist Germany I have no idea and
[4703.679s] that&#39;s why I don&#39;t invest there Dave
[4705.84s] Jones uh question about you think gxo
[4708.84s] gets bought out I hope not if they do I
[4711.44s] would think it&#39;ll be around 80 bucks but
[4714.04s] uh time will tell Robert little what do
[4716.639s] you think about ticker
[4719.88s] CX doesn&#39;t seem like it should have a
[4722.52s] $112,000 market
[4725.92s] cap um obviously a new listener
[4736.12s] uh for browser based video monitoring
[4739.199s] and analytics this is more this me
[4743.239s] too BS stuff um this is this is nothing
[4749.12s] this is not high quality this is not
[4751.679s] durable cash flows this is gambling
[4755.239s] stocks which we have no interest in so
[4757.679s] Robert I implore you to listen to many
[4760.56s] of our past podcasts start to learn a
[4762.76s] framework that I learned uh uh from
[4765.96s] following Buffett Munger Benjamin Graham
[4768.96s] all the greats teer uh lee
[4772.28s] cooperman
[4774.239s] Etc uh that&#39;s durable that works over
[4777.48s] time and
[4779.8s] um you know companies like this where
[4782.4s] you&#39;re trying to get rich quick on a
[4783.679s] penny stock is the shortest way to blow
[4785.239s] up your account and never get rich so uh
[4788.0s] we&#39;ll leave it at that uh Rob
[4791.199s] Kowalski uh hey Tom love the show do you
[4793.36s] have any thoughts on nuclear uranium
[4794.88s] commodity stops like kamiko no uh so
[4798.199s] nuclear&#39;s all the hype now so these
[4799.84s] things will trade for a week and then
[4801.28s] they&#39;ll blow up uh the big trade we had
[4804.199s] on that made a multibagger very quickly
[4806.639s] was Rolls-Royce and we were playing the
[4808.44s] airline service recovery and got the
[4810.199s] benefit of uh the
[4814.8s] uh the smrs which are 10 years out by
[4818.08s] the way uh so they&#39;re very speculative
[4820.28s] at this point there will be a way to
[4822.48s] play that it&#39;s not right now so let all
[4824.52s] the Maniacs chase the shiny objects run
[4826.48s] them up and then crash in the next six
[4828.239s] months that&#39;s not what we do we&#39;re not
[4830.44s] gamblers chasing the next hot idea JT
[4833.6s] we&#39;re chasing the shorer ones uh Slumber
[4837.8s] and oil field services companies keep
[4840.28s] getting my
[4841.679s] attention
[4842.76s] [Music]
[4844.96s] uh what is in your opinion on Slumber
[4848.32s] would you prefer a single high quality
[4849.88s] name like S Baker Halbert in her plate
[4852.8s] through o diversification while
[4855.36s] positioning for Rebound uh I keep
[4857.6s] looking at these they&#39;re not cheap
[4859.719s] enough for me yet uh or they may never
[4862.08s] get there
[4869.84s] um yeah I&#39;ve been looking for a play
[4872.159s] here for a while and uh there&#39;s just
[4875.44s] hire and better uses of my money it&#39;s
[4877.08s] not
[4878.4s] now uh Tim Wang thoughts on Celsius
[4881.92s] Holdings got my eye on it not doing
[4883.88s] anything yet never do anything but I am
[4887.48s] spending time on it I&#39;ll leave it at
[4889.28s] that but probably not going to ever do
[4891.719s] anything with
[4892.719s] it uh Eric
[4895.6s] Walker Carnival all right so this thing
[4898.32s] has already had a run we talked about
[4900.679s] this years ago in
[4904.199s] 2020 and now that it&#39;s doubled everyone
[4907.04s] wants it so let&#39;s just take a
[4909.719s] look yeah I mean the issue with this was
[4911.92s] the balance sheet it&#39;ll probably go up
[4913.4s] to 30 bucks but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s
[4915.04s] going to go a whole lot more than that
[4916.48s] this cycle because of what their balance
[4918.12s] sheet looks like postco but
[4921.56s] um uh the people that were buying it
[4924.36s] during 2019 and were able to hold
[4926.32s] through it&#39;s it&#39;s okay wasn&#39;t the best
[4928.32s] use of capital but it&#39;s uh it&#39;s a decent
[4930.8s] trade and will work will work higher
[4932.52s] Drew
[4934.48s] Robinson uh hey Tom huge fan of the
[4936.88s] podcast before I get into my question
[4938.159s] why to mentioned the Walgreens employee
[4939.84s] Vape comment in last week&#39;s episode was
[4941.639s] too good so relatable anyway what is
[4945.239s] good entry point for Tesla uh difficult
[4948.36s] to determine whether robot taxing
[4949.84s] optimistic price is in stock I&#39;m curious
[4951.679s] what your thoughts are uh I I&#39;ve never
[4954.679s] bet with musk or against musk and I have
[4958.96s] my reasons for that which I cannot
[4961.12s] discuss on the podcast but
[4964.96s] um I would never bet against him and if
[4968.0s] you get an opportunity to invest in
[4969.679s] SpaceX at anything below half a trillion
[4971.88s] dollars it probably makes sense as far
[4974.199s] as Robo taxes and all this other stuff
[4977.239s] it&#39;s just not what we do um we look for
[4980.199s] high quality companies that are trading
[4981.639s] at reasonable valuations that have
[4983.52s] pretty sure doubles this
[4987.04s] one you know I&#39;ve even looked at it
[4989.48s] recently
[4991.96s] and I I don&#39;t make bets on uh guessing
[4995.6s] Technologies in the future it&#39;s not
[4997.159s] where you make durable predictable money
[5000.08s] um so with that it&#39;s just I&#39;m I hope it
[5003.0s] works for musk and the world I&#39;m not
[5004.76s] going to participate Jim Jones with the
[5007.679s] recent rally into China as a whole do
[5009.88s] you think that ant group will IPO in
[5012.159s] 2025 yes uh probably and what would be
[5015.8s] the overall effect on the price I think
[5018.0s] the valuation goes from 30 something
[5019.96s] billion to 100 uh and that&#39;ll have a
[5024.199s] reasonable impact for Boba shareholders
[5027.44s] over time uh Bob
[5029.719s] Johnson semi longterm listener frequent
[5032.32s] contributor of mediocre IDE is until
[5034.92s] today hopefully
[5037.44s] dwl de doas group on one in stock
[5041.199s] exchange auto parts
[5044.159s] company uh joint venture Chinese spin
[5047.4s] off their metal orgy
[5049.239s] business uh I
[5051.84s] look I&#39;m telling you I&#39;ve been doing
[5053.84s] this for a while I like I&#39;m putting new
[5056.52s] clients in in Cooper standard at 13
[5058.679s] bucks all day long yeah the ones that
[5060.32s] have been with me for a while have it at
[5061.679s] five bucks and change but uh I think 13
[5065.04s] bucks is like unbelievable
[5067.56s] so I I wouldn&#39;t really want to mess with
[5070.76s] this at all um let me take a look at the
[5075.44s] balance sheet my guess is their balance
[5077.04s] sheet is toast based on the way the
[5078.52s] stock is
[5083.84s] trading cash flow I mean they&#39;re not
[5086.119s] even anywhere remotely near to cash flow
[5088.119s] break even so for me I&#39;m out U but keep
[5092.6s] them coming Bob I think you&#39;re going to
[5094.0s] hit a home run on the next one and let&#39;s
[5096.88s] see Jason Z Celsius are you still
[5100.36s] looking at it yeah continue to look at
[5102.4s] it continue to do nothing uh with that
[5104.92s] said we&#39;ll be back next week same time
[5107.52s] same place in the meantime make make it
