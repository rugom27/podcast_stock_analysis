Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 304th videocast podcast for the week ending August 14th, 2025. We got a lot of incredible stuff to cover today. A very special guest interview with the CEO of one of our larger holdings and a lot more. But as always, family first. Got to take the girls to the Orange County Fair out here in California. Had a blast. Uh then we got uh they set up a lemonade stand. Uh Mimi and Annabelle did and their friend joined them to help Grace. Uh and they sold a lot more. You know, the big seller was this soda called Poppy. They were very creative, very successful, and she's been doing that actually and making some bank. Uh I mean, she's got some tripledigit days uh in the last week while they're kind of off from swimming and before vacation, etc. So, there's another great picture of Mimi and Annabelle. Uh, same thing here. Us on the high thing. Uh, and I hit my goal inside of four years with three months to spare. Earlier this week, I hit a 9.8 index. So, the two goals inside of four years, break 80s, get to a singledigit index accomplished, only to be taken away uh two days later up to a 10.1. But mission accomplished and now I can look out two years for the next goal because that's the key thing is set the next not for uh what you get but for who you become to get it done. So my goal is down to a seven inside of the next 24 months. And uh I think that'll probably top out my maximum capacity and a little bit of luck to get there. But uh but that's where it is. So I wanted to share that for those of you who've been following along. Been only only been playing three and 3.7 something years. December will be four years. So uh that you know took a lot of effort to get there and I really enjoy it. So that's that. Back up to 101. All right. Uh without further ado, we had the most incredible interview, highest viewed uh uh interview of all time for five plus years. We've been doing hedge funips.com with the CEO of VFC Corp. That's Vans, Timberland, Northface, Dickies, Alta, Icebreaker, and more. You got to listen in here. And uh I'll tell you what, uh you know, as as great as Cooper Standard has been, went from whatever five and change from our initial basis to now uh knocking on the door to $30 and probably going to double again here uh in a reasonable amount of time in our view. All of this, by the way, is opinion, not advice. Go to hedge funips.com and click on terms. Talk to your financial advisor. Don't do anything until you talk to someone else and blah blah blah. So that's that. Um, I think VF is going to be the next uh Cooper Standard and this interview gave me a lot more confidence in that outlook. So, we're going to listen in here. Well, without further ado, I would like to welcome and I'm truly honored to welcome the president and CEO of VF Corp, Mr. Bracken Daryl. Thank you so much for joining us today. >> Thank you, Tom. Thank you very much, Rob. Well, announcement. I feel like the Chicago Bulls uh opening when when Michael Jordan was there >> company very well. Uh VF Corp has major incredible brands Vans, Northface, Timberland, Dickies, and a lot more. Mr. Daryl will will speak with us about that. But I do know that you're on a timeline, so I want to get right down to some of the questions and give our investors as much valuable information as we can. We've heard your your quarterly earnings call. Congratulations on a great quarter, by the way. the turnaround is going along exactly as you promised when you when you took the helm just a couple short years ago. Um, one of the core things I'm going to start with compensation and and most management would say, uhoh, here we go. But, uh, it's just the opposite. Uh, we're really excited about how VF Corp has set this up. And one of the core things we look for in potential investments is the overall alignment of management with shareholders. Uh, are they acting like owners? and do they respect shareholder equity? Uh, since joining VF Corp in 2023, you have personally written over $3 million worth of checks from your own pocket to purchase stock, and several other board members and executives have made material open market buys. You have a policy requiring significant share ownership over a 5-year period, ranging from 2x to 6x current annual base salary with credit given only for direct holdings. On top of that, 90% of your compensation is tied to financial targets, including revenue, operating income, gross margins, uh, with 50% of stock option awards linked to long-term performance goals. The rest of the executive team has similar performance-based compensate compensation. Can you speak to how you and the board think about alignment with shareholders and why you believe this culture is so important for the VF Corp turnaround? You know, I don't know if if u if most people are as financially motivated as as a lot of investors might think, but uh certainly some people are. Um but in my in my experience, good boards and good leaders understand that the scorecard for winning is about increasing shareholder value dramatically. And so they whether they're there because they want to make a ton of money or they're there because they want to be viewed as a big winner, both of those arrive at the same place, which is you should absolutely have the performance tied to the to the performance of stock. And so I could and and the performance of stock is usually a direct reflection of the growth of the top line and the growth of the bottom line. So I couldn't feel any more strongly that you know especially the CEOs um but also you know the the rest of the management team should be very directly tied to that and uh and we are and I think every company really ought to be. >> Yeah I I agree and I'm I'm really happy to hear you say that. you know, when I got involved in the stock, you know, pre kind of tariff fears, uh I was I was just sharing uh with your colleagues that uh we've got a pretty low basis, $13 and change uh across the board and uh we saw you start to implement the turnaround plan and the stock ran up from, you know, 13 to 28 and then there were some fears about tariffs uh and it got knocked down. But when when I originally wrote this and I wrote a personal check and I wrote big checks for my clients to buy uh stock, my my basis and by the way my nickname on Wall Street uh is turnaround Tom. So we we do have something in common uh as you're a turnaround specialist as well. Uh you know I had originally underwrote this. I said look >> the number one thing with a turnaround is take solveny risk off the table. So I underwrite for that first. If they do that you get a double. uh if they actually stabilize the business, you get more than that. And if they execute and grow and turn it around, you can get upside. But my initial initial underwriting was, you know, $40 stock. Okay? And as I've listened to you uh over the quarters and seen what you said you were going to do and see see what you've done, leaving aside the short-term liberation noise and all that stuff that you're going to work through just fine. I've taken my internal underwriting up uh from that 4050 because you've already taken solveny risk off the table. you're already stabilizing and growing most of the brands uh to I I think over I I can't tell you if it's going to be three, four, five, six years, but but generally three to five years. I think this stock could work its way back to new highs. Um and I know you can't guide on any of that. Uh a little bit of curveball here when you forget about the guidance, forget about you're an individual investor. You wrote $3 million worth of your own money into stock. Did you have a similar view to me or or do you think I'm too optimistic? >> Well, I Yeah, since I since I can't talk about Oh, I can't I could, but it'd be naive of me >> to go out and start predicting stock prices like that. >> Yeah, fair point. >> I can't really respond directly. I comment to to your question, Tom. But what but I'll talk about why did I invest? >> Yeah, >> I invested for a couple of reasons. First, I think uh uh you know, I wouldn't be here. First of all, I'm you you you deserve the name Turnaround Tom because you you've invested in turnarounds in serially and and they've worked. I don't think I deserve the name I'm not turnaround bracken because I really never go into any of these with that first objective, that double objective. That is not my objective. Yeah. >> In fact, I I just view that as like like if you're on a stairway, the turnaround part of it is the first two or three steps, you know, that that's just a a path that's just part of the pathway to what I really want to do. I love creating long-term growth businesses. I mean, that's my game. >> Yeah. >> That's all I'm here for. That's all I ever cared about in my life from from a career standpoint. I love to grow people. I love to grow businesses. I love to grow brands. I love to create great things, great products. So that's why I came here. It wasn't to do the turnaround. The turnaround is just a step along the way. So my So that's the I guess my starting point. My second one is in terms of the the investment itself, I would say, you know, uh as a result, you know, I think we're a tremendous investment or I wouldn't put my own money in. >> I also wouldn't be here if I didn't feel that way. So I I I feel like it's a tremendous investment as you said. you know, we're we're trading at, you know, kind of not not historic lows, but at pretty low prices relative to even four or five years ago. >> Yeah. >> And the brands are fantastic. I mean, we really have tremendous spread. So, that's that's about all you need. The rest is really leadership, getting the right team in place, then and then putting the process in place and executing. And I think I could know how to do that. You know, the most important one is getting the right people here. We definitely have, at least at the top now, I've really got a fantastic team, >> right? We're going to get to that uh here. Something we always prioritize at Great Hill Capital is investing in companies with high quality sound management. What we call betting on the jockey. And that's exactly how we view Vupc because by all means, Bracken, you're a turnaround specialist. Whether you want to call yourself that or not, turnaround Daryl. Let's leave that aside. Uh for th we're going to call you growth company Daryl. But uh for those in the audience who may be less familiar, Bracken's first major turnaround was Old Spice uh where he tripled market share in two years, creating one of the most successful turnarounds in PNG history. Then he took over Logitech in 2013 when the stock was down 82%, sales were declining, operating margins had collapsed. Over the next eight years, the stock went from $5 to $133, delivering a 26 bagger. The setup sounds very familiar to what you faced when you joined VF Corp, a stock that had fallen 85% with declining sales and operating margins cut in half. Uh could you first discuss what you've learned from your track record of successful turnarounds and now that you're approaching the 2-year market VF Corp? Compare and contrast your plan, execution, results, and uh results to date and expected outcome between Logitech and VF Corp to date. uh Logitech being a 26x because of you. Uh maybe kind of draw some comparisons if you see any. >> Well, the the mo the most important what have I learned today? What what have I learned in my experience? The most important thing is pretty know if I've learned anything and I I've been very lucky to work around great people, you know, and I had great people at Logitech and I built that team over uh probably five or six years, you know, to really get it to where it was. um the team that really had that kind of performance. It didn't take five or six years to perform, but it took five or six years to get there. And and it probably didn't need to take as long as it as it did, but that's just intuitively how I felt like uh the the timing that that made sense here. Um I've gone much faster on the people side. you know, I I'd say it's taken me, you know, really a year and a half to get to the same kind of caliber team. Um, and and and that that super team is still over there at Logitech and I've got a super team here now. So, I feel really really good about that. So, that's those are those two things are very parallel in terms of what we've done so far. Um the second thing is it's it ends up being all about u you know if you think about it financial the requirement to be financially disciplined aside. So we'll park that for a second because that's a given. Um if you think about we only do two things. We create products that ideally make people feel better about themselves and are preferred to other people's products and we create uh and we we help build brands that people want to join, want to be part of. And those are the two things we have to do exceptionally well. And and so to do that, you've got to have a great product machine. So the first one of the first things we really worked on here is let's first of all and we didn't have this problem logic. Let's get to one product process. It's as if we had you know 13 different factors or 32 different factors for creating products. They were all doing it differently. We've gone to one now. Now that's that's still not fully implemented because it takes a little while to cross over and get to one that common practice, but it's a best practice. It's a best industry practice. And so we've now by the time we get to, you know, over the next 6 to 12 months, we'll be on that one common best-in-class process of ideating and creating product and bringing it to market. That's the most important step from a process standpoint you can do in this company. And and I feel super good about that. Now, we're going to do that for every major process at this company. We are. So, so think about that like you open your phone and you've got apps on the phone. Um those once you've got one one really good process, it's like a it's like an app. And so every time there's an improvement to that process, you can update all the different brands apps or processes at the same time. >> Wow. >> So that's what that's what we're that's where we're headed and and that's really going to be a good best practice. I dreamed of doing this before when I was back at PNG a long time ago. And PNG generally had one good strong process. Ever since I experienced that, I wanted that in every company I was in. Logitech, we didn't have that problem because we were on one process. Here we didn't. We weren't. So, we've done that. So, that's the second step we've made. So, first people, second processes, you know. The third is functional excellence is really bringing in people who are the best in class at what they do and making sure that we're constantly pulsing the industry and outside our industry in areas let's say for example AI today where the best things that are happening we're bringing them in learning them and then becoming functionally excellent and those three things are super super critical and you know we're well downstream on all three of them I would say all three of those were really critical to the performance of Logitech the the second one was easier to do because we were already on one process, we just tend to improve it. Um, and then the the but the first the the people side and the functional excellence side took years to develop and that's what we're that's exactly we're doing here. >> Thank you. Well, uh, that that's really really helpful. I I want to talk a little bit about the cleanup phase which which you've been going through the last 24 years. Uh, probably the one you hear the most about and arguably the biggest piece. >> 24 months. >> 24 months. >> Yeah. 24 months. >> I think some investors feel like it's 24 years, but it's been 24 months. >> 24 months. Exactly. you know, it's it's uh been very very short time, but a lot of a lot accomplished in that short time. But the one you probably hear about most, the piece of the turnaround, uh biggest piece of the turnaround, and that's Vans. Uh I now have five pairs, by the way. Picked up a another pair at Vans Vital and Laguna Beach this weekend with my girls. Th this this is a brand uh VF acquired back in 2004 that went on to grow 10x over the next 15 years. So, you know, from the from starting in the early60s and and yet they were able to drive that growth, but it's been under real pressure since, as you know, revenues in the most recent fiscal year were more than 40% below their peak uh in fiscal year 2022. You've you've been open about what went wrong, that Vans lost touch with its core audience by chasing trends, became overexposed to value channels, which diluted the brand brand, and leaned too heavily on legacy franchises. Since you stepped in uh back in 2023, the focus has been on taking your medicine and cleaning things up from existing value channels and closing unprofitable stores to rights sizing inventories, all of which have helped to drive significant gross margin improvement. Uh could you speak to that initial phase of the van's turnaround, what you prioritized, what you think needed fixing most urgently, and how you've approached setting the brand up for a comeback? Yeah, you know, I think I think this this happens a lot in very successful businesses. You know, the the thing it's like uh the thing that gets you there, you overdo it. You know, it's like it's like you get a really really strong muscle and then you just keep going and going and going and then suddenly one day you're so overdeveloped that the rest of your body's in trouble, you know. >> Yeah. >> And that's exactly what happened here, you know. And we we I think they did some really great things with the brand. I mean, the Warp Tour, the just fantastic. They had fantastic products that were really appealing and they did really good things with them and then they just, you know, again, it's so easy to be 2020 in hindsight. I'm not critical of anybody was here at the time because oh before the grace of God could have been me you know >> but but I I think they just they had a few things that were really working and rather than keep that innovation funnel filled where you're constantly putting in new ideas innovation ideas on the product innovation ideas on the marketing you know they they had things that were working and they just poured more and more fuel into those and they took them broader and broader in distribution for example and to deeper deeper into the value channel and they just went deeper and and deeper and deeper and broader and broader and broader on some of the same styles and you know there was wasn't something behind them. It just they had they had cut the spending or at least they had an increased spending on the on the innovation pipeline and you know the problem is at some point that music stops you know so that's really what it was and and and if that sounds overly simplistic I don't think it is. The cool thing is the brand is as strong as ever. It's a fantastic brand. You you you really have a very hard time finding anybody who doesn't think the brand is really strong. >> That's a great sign. You know, that's like a wonderful sign. And the business is in trouble, but the brand see consumers don't seem to realize that. Well, why is the business in trouble? The brand's good. I just don't see anything I want to buy right now. That's a good sign if you like to create products because it means we can come back. And uh and then the marketing side of it is is just getting pe trying to find your way into the cultural uh excitement that's happening in the moment. You know, trying to lean into that. I'm not a big believer that you can create uh big broad trends usually as a as a company. Sometimes I think people maybe they pull that off, but you can usually find them and then align your brand with them and then do things that consumers see as as really fitting in the moment. And so that's really what we're up to now. And it's uh it's it's super exciting and fun. >> Yeah, that's great. Well, thanks for for commenting on that in the cleanup. I want to talk a little bit about growth. Uh the focus seems to be on creating new products and returning the brand to its roots. In many ways, it reminds us a little bit of what New Balance pulled off in recent years, maybe converse to a lesser extent. uh after 15 years of sale declines, they reinvented themselves, New Balance, that is by leaning into street wear culture, influential uh partnerships, and high-profile collaborations. In terms of returning the brand to its roots, it doesn't get much clearer than bringing back the Vans warped tour. You sold out three events in a matter of hours and drew nearly 170,000 attendees in uh Long Beach, more than double the previous peak. You've also introduced new core franchises like the new school, now your number two global franchise and top uh growth driver along with sellouts like Super Low Pro. I have a pair, by the way. I think I sent you a picture. And continue to successfully lean into the premium product space. Uh on top of that, you've rolled out several high-profile collaborations, including Lil Uzi partnership uh and continue to elevate the marketing approach. As we head into back to school and holiday seasons, what should investors expect to see from Vans as this brand uh work starts to materialize? Uh are there any early signs of tractions you can traction you can point to? And how should we think about the early influence of Suncho as she begins shaping the brand's direction going forward? >> Yeah. First of all, Tom, you've made the same mistake I did. It's Sunsh. >> Sun, excuse me. >> When I introduced Sun, she she corrected me. You I introduced her to whatever thousands of of employees at at bands. And she said, you know, Bre and I I hope you realize it's I think she said Daryl. I think uh my name is Sun Chay and I said oh no I appreciate that my name is actually Bracken Daryl not Daryl Bracken we still laugh about it um you know look I I think um the the New Balance example is fascinating I think it's one of the most successful uh growth stories I've ever heard of and I grew up with New Balance I'm old enough to remember when New Balance was just a running shoe and uh and what they call the dad shoe today was was the never shoe I actually ran in, but but I I remember the brand and it was a very narrow narrowly targeted running shoe and they stayed that way for a very very long time and I knew the prior CEO quite well and he left to run purple I think and and the new CEO took over and it seemed like just miraculously uh it it took off and so I studied that one with my team because we're we found it just a fascinating example but there are a lot of the cool thing about this industry there are good examples of of brands either getting their mojo back or or getting Mojo back and a lot more like the new battle story or creating mojo like on or creating Mojo after quite a long time like Hoka, you know, it's it's a it's a cool industry where when you when you start to get things right, things really can uh take off. And so it's another thing I love about this industry is people are interested in enough that that can happen and and we all spend enough marketing to help make that happen. So I, you know, I I can't comment directly on back to school, but you asked for early signs. We I mentioned this in our earnings call. You know, we started we started here really trying to move things just like we did at Timberland at the really kind of the top of the top of the curve. So when we at Timberland, I'll use as a parallel, you know, when I first got here, we started doing these it was the 50 60th anniversary of the boot and we started doing collaborations with some of the best, you know, hot designers. Not people you necessarily heard of, they're really known in the design community, the fashion community. So we did eight, I think, of those in a row. Kind of month after month, we put them out there. It was our birthday. It was hip-hop's birthday. It was the hip-hop, you know, it was the boot's birthday. We did a little movie that very few people saw, but it's one of the coolest movies on the planet. Um, so so we did a few things there and that was really intended to kind of seed the very top of this the industry. And then, you know, thank God for Fel and Louis Vuitton, they they reached out to us and said, "Hey, we'd really like to do something with you guys." And that that created the next wave in Paris. And then Maisy Willoughby, who's our uh our brilliant CMO, you know, working with Nina Flood, who's our brilliant president, you know, Nina had this idea. Hey, what if we bought out all the billboards and put Jatims instead of Jim if you're if you don't speak French, Jatim is I love you. Jatims is I love Tims. I guess it'd be kind of the equivalent. So, we bought out all the billboards in Paris. all at the attempt to try to get, you know, mo our mojo back >> and it worked, you know, and then Timberland started to come up again. You know, a lot of we're doing the same thing in bands where we started with a with a subbrand called OTW stands for off the wall. We brought cool collaborations. They all sell out immediately and and so we've been doing that now for a year and a half. And and the cool thing is now in Paris this year at fashion week where a lot of the industry comes together we had the tier zero the top of the industry people who who want to carry our our otw product we we were up 50% booking uh 50% in in uh meetings there and we had people that had not carried us in years who came back and want to carry it now. >> So it's just a good sign you know it's like I mentioned in the earnings call it's a good sign that you know things are happening now. That is a sliver of our business. It's not going to have any meaningful impact in absolute dollars volume profit on the Vans brand if we sell you know three times more of those but >> right >> fact that they're interested you know trends start at the top they don't usually start at the do bottom so it's going to flow down we believe we'll see what's proof that >> that's great that's great well thank you for that color looking uh now I want to go into the reinvention look looking back when you first joined VF you you threw in the kitchen sink quarter and took all your medicine at once resetting expectations, cutting the dividend. You launched Project Reinvent, which focused on four priorities, delivering $300 million of fixed cost savings, strengthening the balance sheet, creating America's regional platform, modeled after the successful EMA and APAC operating models, and driving sustainable growth through Vans turnaround. Now nearly two years in, you've delivered more than more than $300 million in cost savings earlier than originally expected. deleveraged the balance sheet by selling Supreme for 1.5 billion uh and reducing the debt by over two billion and are on track to reach 2.5 times leverage by fiscal 2028. You've successfully implemented the America's regional model and two of your four largest brands have now returned to growth. You've emphasized having a high say do ratio since day one. Could you speak to your experience leading this turnaround over the past two years and walk us through the key stages starting with cleaning up and resetting the table and now what investors should expect as the focus shifts to returning VF back into a growth company. I'm going to call you now growth Daryl. >> Good. You know, I think uh I think one of the key things that happens to companies when they get in trouble is they get really good at growing, you know, topline for a long time and as a result, they also get good at growing their SGNA for a long time. And then when they stop growing or they start to decline, they don't they continue to be good at growing the SGNA. So, so it gets out of whack, >> you know, and and and nobody is as flexible as they want to be in adjusting SGNA to the top line. So taking out, you know, $300 million of SGNA was just a must. You know, it was the same thing a lot. I was there. So that's and by the way was the same way at Old Spice long ago. My first my first uh turnaround to growth. So so that was like job one. But but then you know then then it comes then you get back to a lot of things I already talked about which is you know that once you get your cost in line you get it if there's maybe the most important number in any P&L in my opinion and you're a financial expert. I'm a I'm I'm I'm just a guy who works in business. But I think the most important number in a P&L is the gross margin because it because everything's captured that it's like it's like um it's like looking at DNA, you know, if your DNA is healthy then the you know and interesting and and suggests you're going to have a strong long high level performance and health and longevity. Uh that's a very good sign and I think gross margin is the DNA of a company. It shows you how strong your brand is. It shows you how strong your products are. It shows you how strong your your pricing power is. There's a lot in that. So, I am very fixated admittedly on gross margins. So, we're we worked hard to figure out how do we get our gross margins back to where they need to be. And we have specific targets we're after. We've been pretty public about those. And when we hit those targets, you know, we'll be at 55, you know, 55% uh 45% SGNA and we'll be at 10% operating income. That was with no growth from where we were then. So I I I believe we're really well on track to doing that. And that's connected to that two and a half times leverage that we're we're planning for 28 or below. >> And so all of this is like on a on the on a very logical path to get to the point where where the the real starting line is, which is it's all about growth. It's all about growth. It's always all about growth once you get the fundamentals right from an SGNA standpoint and and a basic cost standpoint. So that's what So today we are all about growth. >> Yeah, I love it. I love it. And and you did lay that out in reinvented growth uh two mediumterm fiscal year 2028 targets reaching 55% gross margins and more than doubling operating margins to 10%. What stood out to us in these targets is is that they're entirely based on cost savings and assume zero revenue growth. If our math is right, even under that highly conservative scenario, this business would earn close to two bucks a share from the margin expansion and cost savings alone, which in our view would support a stock price more than double current levels. Obviously, don't comment on that. Uh you've uh you've also noted that each additional billion dollars of revenue or 10% growth could drive an extra 1 and a half to 2% of oper operating margin improvement. That becomes especially relevant given the 3 to 5% growth outlook for the broader apparel and footwear market over the next few years alongside VF's own category expansion. Whether it's Northface aiming to 2x apparel and equipment and 3x footwear or just taking market share with stronger product and brand execution. So between a growing market, category expansion and share gains, it's hard to see a scenario where VF doesn't participate in the growth. Uh my question is twofold. Is first, is that a fair way to think about the earnings power and upside from your medium-term targets? Uh uh and you can be as vague as you want. Uh and two, are those fiscal year 2028 targets still firmly on track? How are you thinking about progress so far? And given that the targets are primarily driven by cost savings, how are you approaching tariffs and potential mitigation strategies, especially considering 85% of the US volume is sourced from Southeast Asia and Central and South America? >> Of course, yes, we we're still on track to those trap those >> love it goals as we as we track for those goals as we said here in the earnings call. Uh the tariffs are obviously, you know, not something anybody planned for. We certainly didn't contemplate when we came to those targets, but we continue to feel like we could manage within our current game plan to deliver those targets even with those with the tariffs. You know, if I wouldn't be able to say that with any confidence if the targets affected us disproportionately to others in the industry, but it sure uh based on all that we can see, everybody's kind of affected equally. So, this is kind of like a big macroeconomic reality that we're all dealing with. So that means people are going to manage it just like we are as much cost as you can get price increases for you on top of that and in the end that will all adjust. We'll have a short-term impact that'll last us whatever it is a year 18 months or something until it's all you know the divot that the tariffs immediately give you. You can't offset immediately but we'll end up offsetting all that. So that's really what we believe and u and we said that during the earnings call and and we're we're all in to go make sure that happens. in terms of the the responsiveness of this business to growth. Yeah. You know, one of the coolest things about this business in particular is it has so much leverage, you know, it's incredibly painful on the downside when you lose revenue. >> Uh and incredibly uh wonderful on the upside when you add revenue, >> you know. So that's why you could add a billion dollars of growth to this business and get, you know, a point and a half to two points of operating income expansion if you want to put it into that. It's it's there. So, so it's a cool business from that regard and but that does make it that plus the fact that we have debt at the level we do makes it quite a volatile play going down and up. So, it'll be interesting to see what happens as we start to grow at some point. >> Great. Couple more here as we wind down. I know you're on a timeline as as well. Uh I want a couple final on leadership. A player A players tend to follow other A players and since you took the helm of V VF corp the company seems to have become a magnet for talent. Uh in fact including you 12 of the 16 leaders on the global leadership team are either new to the company or in a in a new role. That includes Sun uh who's now uh global brand president of Vans who joined from Lululemon after nearly seven years as chief product officer during a period which revenues quadrupled and the brand became one of the most respected in the apparel space or Chris Gobble the the new uh brand president of Dickies who came over from Gap after helping lead its turnaround. The list goes on, but what's clear is you've built what looks like an allstar leadership team. That said, could you speak to what this new group brings to the table that may have been uh missing before, the kind of culture you've worked to build and the difference you've seen at as this leadership team starts to show its impact? >> Yeah, you know, I think I think they came for a couple of reasons. you know, uh, a, as you said, a players tend tend to be more likely to hire A players, but I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I think the more important factor is, uh, great brands, great potential, tend to attract people who love great brands. And I think that's the that's the bigger driver. I'd love to give me and Brent Haidider, who's our our head of people and the head of North America, of the Americas, too. I'd love to give us both a bat on the back, and I'll give him one because he does amazing things. But I think it's just as much the fact that we've got such amazing opportunity here and people smell that and they love it and um and that is super super exciting. In terms of the team itself, you know, I think this what I what I really believe is that great teams are uh are made of people who feel uh who feel super excited about what they're doing. They feel the potential. they feel enabled by the by the company more than uh hindered by it. You know, I'm since I spent my whole life in relatively large companies, I have an incredible maybe because I have I have an incredible bias against bureaucracy. I hate bureaucracy. I hate long meetings. I hate big decks. I hate all that stuff. So, I really do all I can to try to create this little um uh uh I'm trying to think of a better word, but quicksand of big company reality as I as possible. The least amount of process but good process. That that process I talked about earlier, you know, 321. Well, the goal is not to have one really thick process. It's to have one thin, clean, streamlined process. It's the least the least process is the best process. Not not too little because you need you need good process. I love that. But but but I think the error that most big companies end up with is they just get they keep it's like you you end up after a while you end up like a like a hospital that's been there for 30 years. You know, somebody gave the the heart wing and somebody else gave the dermatology wing and before you know it, it's like 10 different uh buildings all kind of stuffed together. And I've worked in enough big companies to have felt that myself. And I'm doing everything I can to avoid that. I want this to feel like a pristine brand new building that you walk in and feel transparency and flexibility and empower and fast. >> That's great. Uh a little bit on touching on Northace here before we go. Switching gears to a brand firing on all cylinders with a whole lot more ahead of it. Northace has become the largest outdoor brand in the world. You recently laid out plans to make uh the North Face a true four-season brand, aiming to 2x the apparel business, 2x bags and equipment, 3x footwear, implying a 7.7 billion revenue run rate down the road. You're also coming off the Skiims collaboration uh uh with Kim Kardashian, which became the fastest selling partnership in brand history, selling out within hours and generating over 10 million 10 billion impressions. Could you speak to the current health of the North Face brand, where you see the biggest opportunities for expansion and how you plan to lean into uh maybe influencerbased marketing and perhaps future collaborations to drive continued brand heat? >> Yeah, I'll speak for Caroline Brown here who run who who came in and is a luxury brand expert and and really came into the North Face, but she's also an athlete herself and and loves the performance orientation of this brand. I think the magic of the North Face brand sits in that those two extremes. On the one end, you've got this brand that that started as an equipment brand and it's probably the most uh present brand in the climbing of Everest or or maybe the all the other really challenging climbs you can think of. We have over 200 North Face athletes including you know Alex Hano with Panel who is who who did Free Solo and climbed that incredibly scary uh climb with no ropes uh live on a in a documentary and if you haven't seen it please do. >> On the other end of the spectrum you've got people who love to wear Northace in New York, you know, in the winter in in a subway, you know, >> and it's and and it's fashion for them and it could be better. We're not doing anything in the North Face as well as we could and and Caroline would be the first one to say this despite the fact that the business is so strong and the so strong. There's so much unexloited opportunity in the Northace whether you're talking about really being a four season brand and we can talk more about that if you want to, but really being a four-season brand or or really just exploiting the fact that we can be a much more uh fashionware brand. people love to wear for how it looks, not just how it performs. We're not doing either one of those nearly as well as we could. And so I'm by the way, we're also not doing nearly as well as with women as we could be, even though we do sell to a lot of women. It's not that we don't, but there's there's just opportunities left, right, and center on Northace where I sit and Caroline feels the same way. And I think we're we're we've got the right team in place to make that happen. >> That's fantastic. Um, uh, weaker dollar, just want to touch on that before we close up. As a multinational company with 55% of sales outside the US, a strong dollar has been a significant headwind in recent years. With the dollar having its worst start to the year in over 50 years, down nearly 10% year-to- date. How should investors think about the potential impact if this weakness persists? Could it become a meaningful tailwind uh going forward? >> You know, I'm I'm I'm never too uh like like everything else that you can't control, I don't spend too much time thinking about it. in the short term, you know, weaker dollar is a little better for us, you know, because obviously it it improves our profitability. We do have SGNA that's that's dollar based and but and uh it's this dollar based we have a lot of SGNA outside the US, so that that hurts us, but generally speaking, a weaker dollar is better. Um but I'm just not going to rely on that. Yeah, I think it's nice if we have it, >> make advantage of it. We'll make sure not to get u so dependent on it that we can't be flexible and move in the other direction when the when it swings because it always does. >> Yeah. >> So, if I've learned one thing, just be on the balls of your feet and don't don't rely on anything you can't count on. You can't control yourself. >> Love it. Love it. Is there anything we didn't ask Bracken, but you'd really like to share or talk about as we close out? No, I I'm uh you look, I'm I'm obviously pretty excited about this this business. And you know, I didn't come here for for two years. I came I didn't come here for five years. I came here for to turn this into something. And I came here for a decade. And most investors are not here for a decade. So, I'm very aware of that. And they need to see results bigger than that. But we're executing and we're doing what we said we would do. I think we're we're right on track to what we need to do to be this great company that I believe we can be. >> Yeah. Well, we're we're much longer term than your average investor, Brack, and we're our holding periods tend to vary between three to five or more years. Uh, and uh, and that's what we like to see. And the last question I have to ask, uh, is what's your personal favorite pair of Vans and why? I like my new current Kapples. Uh, what what are you wearing these days? >> Uh, I am wearing a pair of premium old schools today that we just launched. Yesterday I wore um I I wear a different one almost every day. I And I I can't even tell you how much if you think I've invested a lot in NBF stock, you should see how much I've invested in Van Shoes and all the rest of our stuff. I mean, we just make good stuff. >> Yes. >> I would say my current favorite is probably um a pair of neighborhood collaboration bands that are just very cool. They're black and they I like them. But but honestly, I like so many different products right now. It's hard to choose. And uh that's a really good place to be. And it's getting harder and harder, which is a good sign. >> Yeah. Well, that's exciting. I can't thank you enough for taking the time uh to talk with me and a lot of our investors and many people out there that that really want to see the incredible value in this story. Uh I'm now going to call you, my new nickname for you is Growth Bracken. Uh coming to you from the heart from Turnaround Tom. I think we're going to leave it there. Thanks. Thanks so much for joining. >> Thank you, Phil. >> And we're back. Uh, and then on Friday, I had the pleasure to join the great Ash Webster on Varnian Co. Thanks to Christian Dagger and Payton Jennings for having me on. We got to talk Little China, which was a curveball. Uh, we were supposed to talk about something else, but uh, really glad to do that. We'll listen in here. >> I'm Ashley Webster in for Stu Vani today. Let's get straight to your money and the markets, and it's all very positive. The uh Dow is up half a percent after losing 200 points yesterday. Uh S&P and NASDAQ also up half of a percent or more. 10-year Treasury yield. Let's take a look at the 10 years. See where that is uh right now. There you go. It's up 3.3 basis points on the way up the yield at 4.28. And Bitcoin uh was down a little bit earlier down about 372 bucks at 116970 almost $117,000. All right, Thomas Hayes joins me now. Thomas, good morning to you. Uh, in the last hour we spoke to Kenny Pulkari and he thinks the market is too dependent on the Magnificent 7. What say you? I agree. I think managers are going to be finding their outperformance in buying the Lagards, those stocks that have not risen quite as much. I think in terms of animal spirits coming back to this market, uh, we have a dovish pivot at the Fed with the appointment of Steven Mirren. That's going to be very very positive. We're now showing a 91.4% chance of a cut in September. So, there's a lot to like here, but you have to be very selective where you buy in coming months. >> Uh, I heard someone say earlier and very quickly get your comments on this, the Chinese economy is coming back thanks to all the government interventions to help that along. Should we start looking at companies with large exposure to China to get ahead of that story? Well, it's funny you mentioned that. Uh there's no question it's the the most untold story happening right now. It's they've been stimulating for over a year and you are starting to see a massive reaceleration. We own a company called Alibaba. They're like the Amazon of China. That's our exposure. But certainly you're you're going to start to see companies like Nike start to benefit from a reaceleration of the Chinese consumer. And the Chinese government has mandated that they want to get consumption to 70% of their economy by 2030. So any company in China that benefits from consumption is going to start to do well in coming years. >> You will buy it, says Beijing. They may not have a choice. Tom, thank you very much. Thanks for your time this morning. Uh let's take a look at the markets again. >> And we're back. And then I want to thank um Johan Cherion and Siata Roy for having me in their article on Reuters. You can check that out. And now on to the data. We like to uh kind of start a little bit with a quote of the week, which is from Peter Theal. This week, the most contrarian thing of all is not actually to oppose the crowd per se, but to think for yourself. Be an independent thinker. Burden yourself with the facts. And that's what we try to do here every single week on Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. Uh, also, um, we had some new people send in pictures. A lot of you are getting orders. And the key is not not the orders, you know, I think we make six, seven bucks on a hat. Uh, maybe eight, I don't know. But, uh, the the key is is birds of a feather flock together. And I know that the level of sophistication on this podcast, the people listening in and that are big enough fans to buy a hat or a shirt or a hoodie or a mug, um, hang around with like-minded successful people. And most of them are very successful business people and they come to me for investing ideas and then over time they make money from the ideas and they wind up hiring me as their manager because they want to keep growing their business or just enjoy life. if they sold their business um uh and and so on. So the the purpose of this merch is not to make six or seven bucks on a hat. The purpose of the merch is that it helps to grow the listener viewership with likeminded people so that we continue to be incentivized to offer it to both clients which will always get it and non non-clients uh as long as possible. And the formula to keep me doing this for non-clients is that we continue to grow and we have been continuing to grow and I know many of you are sharing this like crazy and I want to thank you and I would say for the newer people the number one compliment you can pay me I get a lot of thank yous super grateful for that super grateful for the viewership the number one compliment you can pay me is to share this podcast with one like-minded friend or family member that you care about that you think would be interested and and benefit from this and uh and wearing a hat sometimes is exactly what opens up that conversation. So uh we got a bunch of new people. Go here, click on the link that says number one hedge fund podcast. This new one was from Dan G sends a picture from Ireland. Super excited. And you can see a lot of our others uh all different folks from all over the world and we're super excited if you share that. And uh and a lot of you have been buying it and you don't want to share it. I totally understand privacy. You could either use first name or not even send it and we appreciate your support as long as it gets the word out and people ask you, "Hey, what's that hat all about?" And you say, "Look, I listen to this podcast. I made some money off the ideas if that's the case." And uh, you know, you might want to check it out. And if you watch it on YouTube, you get twice the value. If you listen to it on audio while you do your daily walk, you're going to get tremendous value that way as well. With that said, let's get down to data, baby. All right, here we go. Uh, first off, I want to start with Sloomer. this week over at RBC. Thanks to my friends over there. Uh let's talk about seasonality, ladies and gentlemen. Obviously, we all know the worst seasonality is August, September, October. So, if you're not thinking we're going to get a little chop, um you know, you're not being realistic. This is the time of year it tends to happen. However, um you know, if you look at the compilation of uh historical trends going back to 1928, uh there is a tendency for this to stay pretty strong through year end. And that's why I've been kind of in the camp of maybe 3 to 8% pullbacks to be bought to to create opportunities. But I think, you know, if you think about the S&P 500, it's basically a MAG7 index by waiting. So, while the overall indices could see that chop, I think you're seeing more and more of the under the surface. And certainly, if you're a client, you're seeing it in the P&L. I mean, what an unbelievable week by the way. Um, even including today's little noise with the PPI. um the names the quote under the surface which is where we play uh are doing extremely extremely well. So this is less important for us uh than most. And I think what's going to happen is we're gonna wind up harvesting a decent amount of profits uh u early pretty early uh next year and have higher than normal cash levels as we wait for the normal midcycle midterm election year volatility into late October uh and then just reload a ton of cash and and ride it into the end of year. So we'll see. We'll take it time by time. We got to take it on a company by company basis. If the company is not at fully valued, we're not selling it. Uh but uh I think some of them are going to get there pretty damn quick in the next six months. And uh uh we are going to be helping a lot of people out when they're clamoring for the stocks that no one wanted at the lows, everyone's going to want at the highs. And then we'll just rinse and repeat, sit on a little cash, maybe put on some shorts, and then uh uh buy a ton of stuff on sale in the fall of next year and uh and go ahead. So, um, pretty exciting outlook here. And then you've got S&P little momentum waning. Does it go back and test where it broke out? I I don't know. Uh, I think still the pain trade feels up, but the PPI numbers this we're going to talk about the PPI numbers, by the way. Uh, advanced decline. What else we got here? Russell small cap is starting to take off. This is this is pretty early. Today's a hiccup. I think this is going to persist higher uh in the inter near near even in the near term. I don't even think it pushes out to the intermediate term. You see sentiment kind of middle of the range. What else we got here? Sloomer. Uh European looking like it wants to break out of this channel. Um hang sang right up here testing here. Check back pushing to new highs. This looks a lot like the Russell by the way. And if you go back to the uh let's see the mammoth cycle. Um all right, we'll go back to it. Justin mammoth sentiment cycle. I think we're right here with Baba i.e. China. So, take a look at this. This looks a lot like right here. We're just getting through denial. A little more chop. We had that aversion that shook everyone out right here. And you know, whether earnings is going to be the catalyst, whether a meeting with a deal with China is going to be the catalyst. I mean 10-centent earnings were good. JD's earnings were good. I think Alibaba is going to be very good. Um uh but I think the China deal that comes in the third quarter here is going to be what's this final parabolic move. I wouldn't say final, I would say beginning of parabolic move higher and then we'll see what earnings cash flow acceleration, earnings growth looks like uh back up here. So this these are exciting times. I mean it's just the time arbitrage game being patient. Okay, so this morning wholesale inflation accelerates the PPI. So you can see it's high relative to going all the way back to 2022. Now if you listen to the Fed, take with a grain of salt, they have modeled in it's a oneoff and then normalization at capital markets. Ian Lingen said there wasn't anything in the details that materially changed investors understanding of the state of play in either the real economy or the Fed. The point 9% jump in PPI reflects lingering cost pressures some driven by tariffs but core inflation trends remain contained. Let me repeat that. Core inflation trends remain contained according to Gina Balden, president of Bulvin Wealth Management Group. It's a reminder that the path to lower rates might not be linear, but the broader disinflationary trend is still intact. She said, "This is not a signal to panic. It's a time to focus on fundamentals, maintain diversification, and look for companies with stronger pricing power and healthy margins." Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant said, "Oh, so he kind of walked back a one time 150 basis point cut. Um, you know, blah blah blah. don't tell what the Fed could do, but he did say that we're 150 basis points. I've been saying 200, but he says 150 basis points above neutral. Uh, and even after the PPI, the odds of a cut in September dropped from 98%, they're still 90%. So, there's a 9.4% chance that they do not cut in September. 90% chance they do. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. Revolving consumer credit owned and secured is down. This goes back to the thesis that the consumer has a healthy balance sheet. Lower rates will enable them to unlock a trillion dollar of home equity that's been captive. Um, which it's going to be a huge, huge stimulus to the economy. the weight of the biggest stock in the S&P 500. Uh you can see at different peaks going all all the way back to GE in 1994 uh and um 2006 etc. market cap weight of the top 10% largest stocks. Again, 75% um you know, this is not the time historically you want to be in those top weighted stocks. Maybe this time's different. That seems to be the consensus narrative until it changes. I can tell you with the amount of capex spend and the margin compression, I wouldn't bet on it. It's not to say they are not going to do unbelievable things and all of the amazing things that AI is going to bring won't happen. They will and probably way more than we can imagine and the benefit to productivity will be beyond anything we can imagine. Uh and it's going to help a lot of companies that aren't named Nvidia. It's going to be the application of the commodity that will become AI into real businesses that is going to grow margins, productivity, and create a lot more jobs than people think. They think it's going to cut a lot of jobs. I think it's going to create a ton of new jobs like every single technological revolution since the dawn of man. The macro volatility that characterized April quarter has given way to a rebound in single stock volatility this quarter. Okay. price changes for selective market classes. Compact cars were down, mid-size cars were down. So, you can see in the Manheim uh that this supports the uh affordability thesis year-to- date performance of Dowo components. You can see UNH is a big negative waiting. The software stocks are getting hit because of the fear that AI can recreate a lot of these software quote unquote moes in minutes for low cost. Um, probably a little bit overshoot on the Adobe's of the world, but probably not unrealistic either. So, something to keep in mind. Uh, seasonality here we need to be responsible about. This is what we're talking about. Doesn't mean it's a crash. It could just mean a little sideways consolidation. I do think though because everyone is mired in recency bias. Um, if you're wondering what I'm looking at, by the way, portfolio, the markets, which we're recording this midday, I I stay on top of everything. I can hit pause when I need to hit pause, and that's uh what I love about the business. Um, I do think though because people are so traumatized still by that April sellown, especially a lot of managers that sold in the hole that they all are that pain is so present and that creates a lot of recency bias that they're thinking they're going to get something like that during this period because oh my god, if the if the correction was that bad in April, what's going to happen in the seasonally weak part of the year? And usually when everyone's looking for that correction in the seasonally weak part of the year because that's what all the talking heads are talking about. Um the pain period could surprise to the upside and really destroy people who sold in the hole. So uh market likes to cause the most you know the market likes to cause the most amount of pain to the most amount of people at any one point in time. That's how it's designed. And the the thing that would cause the most amount of pain to the most amount of people right now Certainly the institutions would be to keep pushing higher um and especially in the the high short interest stocks as well which is kind of the next phase of it. revenue per employee. Uh global EV sales are still climbing. Again, that's the China story. Albam Marl, the tech giants are boosting capex. That's again going to be a margin story. Major Trump related corporate pledges in the US. We're talking about investment in the US. Apple 600 billion 20,000 jobs. Stargate 500 billion, 200,000 jobs that we'll see. Nvidia 200 billion, TSMC 100 billion. Uh so there's a lot of investment coming back. That's very very good for the economy. Household debt service ratio again supporting what we're saying the lowest going back 40 some odd years. Uh excluding the the pandemic by the yeah the pandemic uh lows there in 2000. But like excluding that one in a 100 year event is the lowest it's been still in 45 years. Um capex growers underperform. So keep that in mind. The ones that are increasing a lot of capex are uh historically tend to underperform. Everyone's excited about all the capex of the mag 7. It would fly in the face of logic historically that they will be the outperformers. uh usually for that to work um the pace of EBIDA growth has to exceed the pace of capex growth and that's not the case in any of them as as far as I can see. Uh AI adoption starting to deflate the US labor market. So that gives the Fed uh we had one speaker out talking about we need to focus more on the employment side of the mandate that that clears the path for September. Multiples have plenty of room to rise. This is S&P equal weight price to earnings ratio hasn't moved higher after six black swan events. So, uh we could definitely see the multiple expansion in the nonheavy weighted stocks. The highest mortgage rate US home owners say they would accept on their next home purchase. So, the sweet spot seems to be right under six. As I've said, I think we're going to get there before the end of the year. And I also think, and again, this is not what I do for a living, but I have a strong feeling that when mortgage rates hit 59, 30-year fixed, oh, and by the way, that's going to lead to a mass proliferation of uh 7 and one, interestonly, resets, ARMS 5 in one, all that crazy stuff is going to come back. So for those who say short rates don't affect mortgage rates, they're going to be totally effing wrong because the new product that banks are going to push out again to create fees is going to be massive. Because if you have a Fed funds rate at, you know, 350 and you go 350 plus 200 on uh interest only for five years adjustable mortgage, you got 550. 550 on an interest only is a low payment on any house. And what's going to happen is this trillion dollars of locked up equity, which is a lot of older people, baby boomers who no longer need seven bedrooms and an indoor pool and a movie theater, uh, are going to all dump at once. They're all going to hit the market at once. Right now, here's the joke. The joke is on them because they're all holding back their properties because right now the market's a little uncertain. you you've seen the top in most areas in housing prices. So, they're like, "Well, I'm not going to hit I'm not going to put it on the market and let it sit because no one's giving me what they would have given me last year. Once they cut rates, I'll get more than I would have got last year." And what they're going to find, especially with the super high end, I think, look, I'm in Orange County. I think the 20s, I think you're going to start to see some of these 20s hit the market for 12 a.5. Um, as for the fives and sevens,5 to7 million houses, uh, they may retain their bid because there's just an enormous demand at the lower end of the market. But I do think some of these 15s and 20s that were worth seven and eight before the pandemic are going to hit hit tens and twelves and maybe some will even go back to seven and eight. Uh, I think that air packet's going to be lift. And I'm totally willing to be completely wrong because I focus on stocks, not on real estate. But my instinct is everyone's consensus view that when rates go down, prices are going to start to go back up again. I think is going to be opposite. I think what's going to go up again is going to be massive supply all at once. And it's going to be a buyer market with cheaper capital. Um and uh I think the supply is going to outstrip the demand in the short term particularly for the um higher end. That's just my two cents. Discretionary investor positioning is well below levels implied by the strong upgrades to consensus earnings estimates. So there's room there. Then you've got Russell 2000 versus S&P funding. again levels not seen since mid24 which supports the small cap thesis. Uh Russell 2K Russell 2000 hedge fund short dollar notional has not been this high in 4 years. You want to take the opposite side of where hedge funds are all crowded short. And that's why you saw such abrupt amazing moves this week. US large cap equal weighted to market weighted stock market relative total return. What this is pointing to is we are at a low of unmagnificent 493 performance versus magnificent 7. That a low level that in every instance 2008, 2000, 1990,74 uh led to years of unbelievable outperformance um of small caps following those periods. So you can see it here every single instance. This is really valuable from Jim Pollson who by the way probably one of the best commentators ever in the history of markets. It's a shame he's retired. Um and he was with a small firm called Luthold. So he didn't get as much spotlight as he should have. Literally one of the best. Literally one of the best. Um US stock buybacks yearly again underpinning for the market dips are going to be bought. US equity market concentration historical highs. So look you can keep saying look it's the same chart last year whatever okay bet against it okay do bubble nifty50 uh AT&T and uh IBM in the 60s etc. It doesn't mean we're going to get a marketwide crash or anything like that. I think we're going to get underperformance of the overweighted concentrated because their margins are compressing and their earnings growth is collapsing. I'm just calling it facts. Earnings absolute earnings going up. Earnings growth ratio collapsing mid30s down to this quarter will be the first quarter at 10% or below for the MAG 7. So, keep buying them. Sold to you. But, um I don't think you're going to like the outcome. I think you're going to love the outcome of the type of stocks that we're doing here and you're already seeing it like gang busters this year. So data center energy demand will grow from 5% of total US power demand today to more than 10% in 2030. That's our comtock resources play. uh patients it's just unbelievable along with Generrack by the way which has doubled um nearly uh historically 50% probability of outperformance in international equities uh oh based on the underperformance. So this is just going back to the normal cycles. We were big on this going into this year when no one would listen to us and internationals outperformed domestic by 10f full percentage points. Record net 91% of fund manager survey investors say US equities are overvalued. They say emerging markets are undervalued. So once the coast is clear on a China deal or China earnings or them seeing more results from the stimulus which we've been seeing, it's going to be a panic buying into those because mag seven is going to start to really hurt their books and they're going to say where can we get it and then once one the whole flock follows and uh my guess is 18 24 months from now we'll be laying off a ton of China stock to these lemmings and that's really what it's going to be about. I mean there's no no other way to explain it. Uh long mag 7 is once again seen as the most crowded trade. That's exactly what it was right before the August massive correction. Um manager now starting to get overweight emarly stages emerging markets. Wow, we got a lot of charts this week. Uh consumer balance sheet goes to the fact that very unlevered earnings revisions going up like we talked about. Expectations were 4.8. 8% earnings growth over 11% now which is mindboggling. Uh this is from Carson slowing economic momentum but no sign of recession yet. So something to keep an eye on but that can last many many years. It was in this range from 2009 all the way to the pandemic. So this can last a long long time. Mortgage debt is a little less than onethird of the housing market. Lowest level since the 1950s. again trapped equity again consumer deleveraged um okay stocks that cut guidance on average are down 10% out earnings this quarter uh that raised guidance are up only 4.3 so there's this trepidation in the market again top waitings you know people are getting Um, healthcare is the lagard. That's where I'd focused. AI exposed that had been the short-term leader. I'd be trimming that and looking for the AI beneficiaries, not the AI names. Uh, different gravy. Here we go. Tech versus S&P price relative. Again, you go back to 2000, you go back to 1970s. This, it's the same story. Everyone said it was different with com and this and that. Uh I just don't think we're going to get a pronounced downturn. I think we're going to get relative underperformance. S&P 500 versus EHA outperformance and DXY index. So what you can see here is as the dollar weakens you get these multi-year periods of international equity outperformance and as the dollar strengthens you get these multi-year periods of dollar equity outperformance. We are in a weakening regime of the dollar which is just beginning uh which means international will outperform and the big play what's the second largest economy in the world it's called China and that's going to be an enormous part they're all underweight just like they were uh energy in the whole in the pandemic they're underweight China they'll all catch up like lemmings and it will um you'll be you'll be able to benefit as the intelligent incredible loyal viewers of hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes because you now are able to independently think for yourself and not get caught up in the headline noise. July CPI follows a swing of soft releases. Um the absolute forward PE for the Russell 2000 as of month end suggests 9% annualized 10-year returns as of month end. So, what they're saying here is the Russell 2000, just like all cyclical periods, uh, is going to outperform. I I'll bet if you did this regression on the S&P 500, it would imply five to 6%. I think Vanguard is even lower than that on the S&P. I think that's too conservative, but you're basically talking about a 3 to 4% outperformance spread on Russell over the next 10 years. Um, business optimism continues to climb. Worst performing stocks in the S&P 500. This is this should be I mean Lulu continues to pop up is interesting. Obviously, United, but they got the DOJ Dow. So, there's some stuff to see here. Growth versus defensive ratio of healthcare and technology, the lowest since 2000. Um you can see Baxter up today with a little volatility. Uh biotech we have we have the exposure. I just continue continues to nag me that I want a little more exposure to healthcare at these generational relative low prices. Um hedge fund length in US index futures. So they're they're net underweight, which that's not where you want to be because that's where they were in 2020 and you had another year plus of straight up gains. So keep it in mind. Uh EPS crushing preeason estimate by 7.7%. That's pretty amazing. one of the highest beat seasons of many, many years. That's from uh that's uh Kelly Cox. She puts out some good stuff. Um data center versus office construction, general office supplies going down, data centers going up. That was the play, ladies and gentlemen. If you were listening to the podcast and a real estate guy, I was pounding the hell out of it when we bought Vornnado and doubled in a few weeks. I said if you're a real estate person, you need to be strongly looking at New York City office and San Francisco office. And most of those costs per foot have now doubled and tripled. So, I hope some of you took advantage of it. Oh, and by the way, if you did, send me some money. Okay, let's let's uh let's manage some of those profits for you is the name of the game. So, all right. And the this is really good. There are only two times in history where the oil to S&P 500 ratio was lower. 1999 and 2020. And by the way, those were generational opportunities to buy companies like Comtock Resources and National Oil. Well, Varco um particularly uh 1999 20201. Something to keep in mind on something to keep a close eye on. We have our exposure in energy. We're comfortable with that level. We were able to add Varco to comtock. So that's that. Discretionary investor positioning has been capped at neutral since the tariff expalation began in early February. Interesting. So they're still underweight. So pain trade higher near record 10th largest week for institutional client inflow since 2008. So, we're getting towards uh since 2008. That's interesting. So, we're getting towards um getting everyone back in the boat, but I don't think we're fully there yet. We find that nine out of 13 US regional power maker markets have already reached critical tightness this summer while expecting all but one to reach critical tightness in 2030. Um again, supports the comtock, supports the gener. Yes, the Fed has cut near all-time highs and the bulls loved it. So when the Fed cuts at all-time highs on average the next month, markets up onetenth of 1%. 6 months later up 3.4. Year later, up almost 14%. Hat tip to the guys over at Carson. Looks like Ryan's work. XLV sector starting to get a little bit of a bid. Um S&P stocks versus short interest pretty high short interest level you see towards bottoms but um US PPI index higher than expected excess returns for small cap stocks rolling seven-year periods you can see going all the way back to the beginning of the 2000s that's when you want to be a buyer sell small caps not a seller the time before that was the late '7s the Time before that was the uh mid7 uh no time before that was the late 80s then mid70s then mid50s you get the point. This this stuff all goes in cycles and it's when everyone thinks that this time is different is when the cycle cycle shift begins and it's already begun. Um, 30-year fixed mortgage rates, you can see them trending down. Total card spending rose 6% month-on-month in July, following a4% month-on-month in June. This is the consumer relevering. We're going to see retail sales uh later this week. May was the second highest ever month for net purchases of overseas equities by US investors. Small cap surge that was yesterday. Megga cap stocks underperform housing related stocks over the past month in percentage gains. Pretty exciting to see. Mag 7 down, small caps up. Uh real estate ETF versus S&P again, lowest going back to 2000. The CCIs of the world, they're going to go up. We probably more need a little more re exposure because that's a play on rates coming down as well. We're comfortable with CCI but maybe a little more. I mean we don't want to have double of everything. I mean, you know, we want to be concentrated and we want to be so but for those of you who are, you know, doing your own thing. Uh there's just so much amazing opportunity. Um all right, global equity returns internationals dramatically outperformed led by Greece of all things. Uh who would have said that in 2008 or 2011 rather. Uh worst has been Saudi Arabia. Interesting. Uh India has been among the worst by the way. You couldn't and people couldn't get it fast enough at the top a year and a half ago when we were like get out. Get out. Go into China. Go into China. China's going up huge. We will probably wind up taking our China profits in the next two years and going back into India for the long long term. They do have the most favorable demographics. Equal weight looking ready to break out in a major way. Um boy, I didn't think we were going to have all this on a uh already amazing week with growth bracken. That was amazing. Um okay so some of left behind large caps charter Lulu staples like General Mills Danahur Slumber we've got our exposure thereby I think that's going to work but yeah allocations to equities are near their highest by whom? That's from State Street. Retail options put call direction by week. Longest retail weekly option buying streaks on record since 2020. Well, they were right. They're buying a ton of options in 2020. And they made super bank. So, um, futures short liquidations. Homeowner households have been declining. US business applications going straight up. AI companies are spending handover fist. That's a margin story. earnings estimates hit new highs by the way. Um 20 Okay, this is forward at 321 24 month. Okay, that's from uh Cali car dealership guy. Auto loan applications rejections are plummeting, meaning credit is loosening. Anyone who wants a car gets a car. In Q2, only 6.7% of B borrowers reported being denied for their auto loans. A sharp drop from the whopping 19% in Q2 2024. So in Q2 202 24 you wanted a car. A the rates were high and b you got declined. Now rates are getting a little lower and everyone's getting approved. So the spickets are opening up. Uh the incentives are going up. Here is the tariffs are currently generating over $300 billion in revenue, an increase from closer to 80 billion uh a year ago. That's the run rate. So Trump is you know bridging the deficit in his own way in that regard. Annual CPI inflation rate. This is from Pollson blue left scale versus city US inflation surprise index. So the surprise index is collapsing. The inflation rate tends to follow that. I think that this PPI is going to prove to be a short-term fake out when we look back 90 days from now because if you look at the overall surprise indices, they're down and that will catch down, not up. Credit spread still under control. S&P 500 members outperforming the S&P index trailing 60 days. You haven't seen this low since early 20201, which is our analog for a lot of the names that we own, which did nothing but go straight up over the next six years from 2001 to 2007. Value small caps international. Small caps remain historically cheap versus large caps. You can see it here. Uh almost yeah, dramatically low. Lowest since 2001. I mean, it's amazing when I see this every week. It just gets me so clear zooming out and seeing like I I'm like a kid in a candy store. I'm so excited. Um and there we go. Moving on. We miss any sloomer here. 30-year yields, 10-year yields working down. Euro, look at this move in the euro. No one was calling for that. Fourth quarter were like, "It's coming. It's coming." And it went against us. And then boom, Canadian dollar. All my Canadian friends smiling so wide they could eat two bananas sideways. Um, oil should start to find some support somewhere between here and $60, $59. Uh, gold price has been kind of losing momentum here, stalling. See if there's anything else we want to cover here. You can see a lot of software stocks breaking down there. There's probably going to be a pony in that pile somewhere. All right, that looks like it from Sloomer. All right, let's get to some news. Advanced Auto Parts earnings beat by.16 revenue topped estimates. So, they beat on the top and bottom line. Why is the stock down? Uh, you can see this article here from Nate Wolf. We'll do a comprehensive next week. Uh, they lowered their guidance from midpoint 170 from mid.2. Um the revision accounted for higher net interest expense related to the company's offering of 1.95 billion in senior notes last month that is going to get refinanced in the next three months. So this is a nonissue in my view. Uh as rates come down these guys are all going to hit the window at the exact same time. But in the meantime um you know we get to build some position here. I don't know if it's going to get low enough for us to add more because we're our basis now has gotten really low 40s uh some in the 30s but yeah so I don't think this is an area where we're major buyers but we would definitely uh in the next few days um any $5 million accounts come in we'd probably start to build a position here for sure. Uh, China consumer loan subsidy seen driving trillions of new credit. Their mandate, as I talked with Ash, to get to 70% consumption is well on its way. China's 11 trillion stock market stages said steady resurgence. 2.7 billion of global funds swarmed Chinese stocks in July and the flow will be bigger and stronger. for long only funds poured 2.7 and global interest should be stronger after summer. The bank says China trade deal deadline extended to early November. China stocks turnovers tops 300 billion as bulls take charge. That's from yesterday. Besson urges Fed to lower rates by 150 basis points or more. He qualified that, but that's where he thinks neutral is. Uh we generally agree. We think it's a little lower, but that's fine. Homeowners rush to refinance as mortgage rates plunge opens window of opportunity. They're gonna The only one that's going to benefit from this is the mortgage brokers and mortg mortgage originers who are going to be refinancing them every 90 days for the next two years and making their points every single time. Moving along, small caps rally as magnificent seven stocks roll over in market rotation. Hedge funds have never been this short. Small caps time for a rip your face off rally. Investors pile into cheap emerging market stocks. Bank of America survey shows this is tomorrow's newspaper today. This is go back to our Q4 uh last year when we were talking international and all this stuff and everyone looked at a weaker dollar. You couldn't find one person talking that.

The mine's closure had been under scrutiny for weeks amid speculation that authorities would not extend its license, and it accounts for some 6% of global output. According to Bank of America, the stoppage has led to speculation about a possible crackdown on the lithium sector, which is suffering from over supply with some analysts saying it could be part of the government's anti-involution initiative to tackle over capacity. And Albamaro is singing the same tune, ladies and gentlemen. Early effing days. Moving along, President Trump calls Intel CEO a success after meeting. It's like, look, you could have just invited the guy out for a coffee. Instead, you got to take his children hostage so he comes to Washington. But that's how Trump negotiates, I guess.

America's power crisis is just getting started. We love you, Generrack. Uh full volume ahead, stock market and sentiment results. We're on to the article of the week. On Monday, we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey. You can find it here. uh this month they surveyed 197 institutional managers with 475 billion AUM. Here were the five key points. Number one, managers are slowly starting to turn bullish on China with a net 11% now expecting a China stronger Chinese economy up from only 2% in July and reaching the highest level in 5 months. Two, a record net 91% of fund managers say US equities are overvalued, up from 87% in July. Emerging markets are viewed as the most undervalued with 49% holding that view, the highest since February 2024. Rotation, rotation, rotation three. 45% of managers see long Magnificent 7 as the most crowded trade, reclaiming its crown yet again. Last time it held the crown, March. We know what happened next. They got hit more than the general market. Four, equity allocation among managers rose for the fourth consecutive month to a net 14% overweight, but remains well below the 24-year average of net 25% overweight and the recent December 2024 high of net 49% overweight. This continues to reinforce our view that the pain trade is likely to the upside with trapped bears still stuck on the sidelines and becoming forced buyers as we continue to work higher. Healthc care has been left for dead with just a net 2% of managers overweight the sector 1.6 standard deviations below its long-term average. This is down 16% month overmonth and marks the lowest level since January 2018. Meanwhile, the sector is at its lowest waiting in the S&P in nearly 25 years. There are plenty of ponies in this pile. Here's the estate. Uh, healthc care waiting lowest going back to 95. GXO update. GXO logistics, baby. Each week, we try to cover one to two companies we've discussed uh in previous podcast videocasts and or own for clients, including myself. I eat my own cooking. I eat so much of it. I'm glowing. I'm smiling so wide I can eat a banana sideways. So each uh here we go. We can see cash flows been a little bit weak. We understood that going into the story. Um and we're going to talk about what's next. Revenues are going through the roof because they've done acquisitions. So how is the revenue turning organically and inorganically? Well, we got some major catalysts. First off, GXO delivered another lights out quarter last week. Revenues of 3.3 billion came in 200 million ahead of consensus beating by 6% while adjusted EPS of 57 topped 55 cents. On top of that, management raised fullyear guidance for the second time in two months as every sign points to an inflection and acceleration in the business from here. We first got involved with GXO nearly in early 2024 with a solid starter position and intent to add on any weakness. Luckily for us, the market gave us plenty of chances and we took full advantage. What originally attracted us beyond GXO being a Brad Jacobs company spin-off from XBO in late 2021 with him still holding 1.7 million shares was its heavy exposure to Europe and international markets. In fact, GXO generates well over 70% of its revenues from outside the US for nearly all of last year and until we were blue in the face. We pointed to the cyclical nature of international and US equity outperformance and how they often track US dollar cycles with international equities left for dead after a record long 16-year stretch of underperformance. This was an area ripe with opportunity. At the time we were on an island with that call. So you can see the data here. Strong dollar, weak dollar, and what happens to international. at the time we were not on an island. But with the dollar now down 10% year-to- date and international markets trouncing US equities by a wide margin, 19% versus 9%, it's suddenly all anyone wants to talk about. Most importantly, GXO continues to be a direct beneficiary. Shortly after its spin from XPO in late 2021, GXO found itself caught in the middle of a once in a hundredyear detock restock cycle. The stock sold off in concert with the shift from goods to services following the pandemic with organic growth falling from 15.4% in 2022 uh which was 2% by year end 2023. Management took advantage of the cyclical drawdown and used its strong balance sheet to go shopping at sectorwide trough multiples apply uh acquiring Clipper in 2022 for 1.3 billion at 13 times IBIDA uh PFS web in 2023 for 142 million at seven times and most recently Winkington for 958 million at seven times IBIDA. Fast forward to today, volumes and inventories have largely normalized. This quarter marked the sixth consecutive quarter of organic growth and the strongest print in over two years at 6%. While fundamentals have clearly improved, two temporary overhangs kept the lid on the stock. The CMA's extended Wington review and the surprise retirement of CEO Malcolm Wilson. The good news is that with this Q2 report, both are now in the rearview mirror. Earlier in the quarter, the CMA approved the Winkington deal and G with GXO agreeing to devest roughly 5% of lower margin grocery contracts. Integration between the two businesses will begin in the coming weeks, unlocking 60 million in cost synergies and opening new opportunities in higher growth verticals like aerospace and defense. On the leadership front, Patrick Kellaher, a 33-year-old industry veteran and most recently CEO North America at DHL, the largest logistics company, will take over on August 19th. He will be joined by a refresh board with seven top-notch new members, all handpicked by Brad Jacobs. With the smoke cleared out, the market is finally waking up to what we've been pounding the table on for months. Record high revenue, highest organic growth in nine quarters, 2.4 4 billion sales pipeline and guidance raised twice in two months. All of this from a stock that was hitting fresh all-time high uh all-time lows just a few months ago. And the best part is that despite the beats and raises guidance still looks awfully conservative, GXO has already booked 795 million in incremental 2025 revenue through Q2. Assuming 95% retention in line with historical averages, that alone translates to 6.45 four or five organic growth with zero additional contract wins. So even with flat volumes and no new business for the rest of 2025, GXO would be at the high end of its organic growth range. We think this sets a bar low bar for material upside in the back half. The bottom line is that GXO is back, baby. And as the business accelerates, we expect a rerating from trough multiples towards levels consistent with a double-digit grower and a cash machine. Mahina, as my 11-year-old who studies Duolingo Spanish would say, by comparison, its former parent XBO logistics trades at an average annual PE of 25 times. that sets up a clear path to what we believe is a double over the next few years as the story unfolds and maybe more. This was a textbook great Hill Capital setup, a high quality compounder with recovering fundamentals while price lagged due to short-term noise and uncertainty trading at a valuation that assumed the cycle would never turn. The cycle has already turned. The market is still catching up. We are not. So you can go through the key points. We have underlined the key points of the earnings release, starred the ultra important points uh and gone through the deck for you. 10 key points. Q2 revenues reached a record of 3.3 billion up 16% year-over-year. Organic growth was 6% the strongest in more than two years accelerating from 2.8% last quarter and improving across every region. And most importantly, management said customer inventory levels are largely normalized, implying the acceleration wasn't driven by pull forward demand. Two, GXO booked new business wins of 307 million in annualized revenue during the quarter, up 13% year-over-year. This brought total incremental revenue for 20251 through Q2 to 795 million and incremental revenue for 2026 to 513 million. uh company record through the first half. More than half of those wins came from e-commerce, which is also driving outsides growth in the higher margin reverse logistics returns business. Reverse logistics now accounts for roughly 10% of the pipeline and a high singledigit to low double-digit percentage of revenues. Three, the total sales pipeline remains about 2.4 billion up yearonear and still excluding the Winkington sales pipeline since the full last full year before the spin. The pipeline has grown by more than onethird and is more diverse than ever with roughly 500 million tied to industrial and aerospace and defense and a a segment that has doubled over the last 18 months. Four, earlier in Q2, GXO received final regulatory approval for the Winkington acquisition, agreeing to dispose of roughly 5% of the business tied to lower margin grocery contracts. Winkington continues to perform well, delivering 10% of revenue growth on its own in Q2. That's amazing. By the way, management is set to begin integration in coming weeks and expects to deliver the majority of the run rate 60 million in cost synergies by the end of 2026, which is ahead of prior expectations. This will be a major driver of IBIDA margin expansion and also is expected to generate significant revenue synergies particularly in the key industrial and aerospace verticals where Winkitin has significant exposure. Management is already working on very large bids in the aerospace and uh defense verticals expected in the back half of 2026 with scale comparable to the landmark 10-year 2.5 billion NHS contract five as part of the $500 million repurchase program announced in February. Management bought back 2.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price of 34.86 86. This is why I love Brad Jacobs so much. I mean, this guy gets it. This guy gets it. You have all these morons buying back, let's just call it large cap tech at record high valuations and right before they're going to normalize in terms of multiples. And then you have this winner, consistent winner, consistent wealth creator, buying back stock at the absolute lows when all the other management would be hunkered on their desk like a bunch of crying in their soup. He's in the market buying stock handover fist and increasing our and his share of the pie because he owns a lot of stock uh with no new money out of our pockets. Kudos. Really amazing job. This brought total repurchases for the first half to 5.4 million shares, reducing shares outstanding by 4% at an average price of 37.34, which represents a 26% discount to the average share price over the last 30 trading days. Six free cash flow during the quarter was an outflow of 43 million compared to 31 million generated in the same period a year ago. However, this was primarily due to a one-time payment for a regulatory item recorded last quarter. Management remains on track to deliver the fullear target of 25 to 30% adjusted IBIDA to free cash flow conversion which implies $262 million of free cash flow at the midpoint seven net debt stood at 2.5 billion at the end of the quarter bringing net leverage to 3.0 3.0 zero times. Management top priority is deleveraging the balance sheet ideally to between 1.5 and two times over time. Liquidity remains strong at 1.2 billion as of the end of Q2 after receiving an upgrade from Moody's in June. GXO now holds an investment grade credit rating from all three major agencies for the first time since the spin. Let me repeat that. After receiving an upgrade from Moody since in June, GXO now holds an investment grade credit rating from all three major agencies for the first time since the spin. Why is that important? Lower cost of capital so that if they can find more and more businesses at 7 to nine times subscale businesses, issue debt at a low rate, which is going to get lower over the next three months, and then get a rerated high multiple on those earnings in the public market. Rinse and repeat. That's why he's created so many tens of billions of dollars of wealth for his owners and in himself because he gets it. Number eight, operating return on invested capital uh during Q2 stood at 46% well above the long-term target of over 30%. And number nine, with over 70% of revenues generated outside the US, a strong dollar has been a a headwind for GXO. However, with the dollar now down 10% year-to date, it's becoming a meaningful tailwind for the company, which was part of our original thesis. GXO does not hedge revenue with favorable FX rates driving 4% of the 16% revenue growth during the quarter or 127 million. Amen. Hallelujah. Number 10. After already raising fullear guidance back in June, management continues to see strong momentum across the business with over a third of Q3 complete. Q2 trends have remained consistent so far this quarter along with strong planning for a good holiday season already underway with customers that gave management enough confidence to raise fullear guidance for a second time in two months for 2025. They now expect to deliver organic revenue growth of 3.5 to 6.5. Adjusted IBIDA is expected between 865 million and 885 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share are forecasted at 2.43 to 2.63. Finally, adjusted IBIDA to free cash flow conversion is projected to be between 25 to 35%. Again, we highlighted all the important facts for you. Put stars next to the super important facts and you can go through that on hedge funfips.com and just scroll down to most popular posts and this will be right at the top. Cooper standard update. Look at all this free cash flow, ladies and gentlemen. We got in mid2022 when it was looking most glum. Look is what's happening. Reaceleration of revenues, positive free cash flow, margin reaceleration, return on invested capital turning positive uh and so on. Cooper Standard raises fullear adjusted EBIDA guidance as second quarter and first half results exceed expectations. And they're doing that on anemic ex estimate in volume which will prove to be far too conservative. This is exciting. Midpoint to 235 million on Ibida from 217. That's a big jump particularly considering they took down the estimate of North American production. Uh which I think again will prove to be too conservative. but they just follow what S&P publishes and S&P is wrong as often as it's right. So you can see the deck we put here. You can see ample liquidity 272 million. Um you can see the cost per vehicle. We've gone through this a million times, but the 10 key points were number one, management continues to deliver significant margin improvement. Jeff Edwards is hitting on all cylinders with gross profit margins reaching 13.2% for the quarter up 150 basis points year-on-year and adjusted EVIDA margins at 8.9% up 170 basis points year. Keep in mind this margin expansion is occurring despite lower overall revenues. So operating leverage has not yet kicked in. Let me repeat that operating margin hasn't even begun. And if you think that this is going to be a cycle that does not reach 17.5 to 18.5 million SAR in the US with onethird more population than we saw in the early 80s when it hit 17 million and change. You are smoking something that you shouldn't be smoking. This is going to be a cash machine ladies and gentlemen. the the volumes are going to be enormous and it's coming to a theater near you now now margin but will s but will soon do so in earnest most importantly management continues to expect to hit their long-term goal of reaching doubledigit margins as they exit Q4 and head into 2026 six with management saying they should be quote shocked if we don't. Doubledigit margins on still anemic volumes is execution cubed. You can't get better than that. Number two, management released long-term 2030 financial targets for the ceiling systems business where they are the global leader. CPS expects the segment to deliver greater than 1.8 billion in revenues, up from this year's projected 1.4 billion, a 6% kagger adjusted EBA margins of 13% greater than 13% up from this year's projected 9.25 and return on invested capital of greater than 20% what will prove to be probably 220% of S&P returns. up from this year's projected 10.5% 25%. At base level assumptions, this implies 234 million in adjusted IBIDA from the ceiling segment alone. Let me let me repeat this ladies and gentlemen. At the base level, this implies 234 million of adjusted IBIDA from the ceiling segment alone. essentially the midpoint of what the entire company is projected to deliver this year. Meaning they're going to double Ibida in the next four plus years. Most importantly, these aren't pie in the sky projections. 80% of the incremental revenue is already booked. Volumes assume the morticians forecast and never exceeded 15.3 million SAR in North America. And the current vehicle mix remains the same with no benefit assumed from increased hybrids which adds 80% cost per vehicle or EVs add 20% cost per vehicle meaning the writing is on the wall for material upside to these conservative projections. Number three, management also released long-term 2030 financial targets for the fluid handling systems business. You want to talk magic GPUs? I want to talk fluid handling systems, the key space where they expect to unlock the full potential of the organization. End quote as they leverage growth in hybrid trends. CPS expects the segment to deliver over two billion in revenues, up from this year's projected 1.4 4 billion an 8% kagger adjusted EBIDA margins greater than 16% up from this year's projected 9.25 and return on invested capital greater than 30% which will probably prove to be 5x the S&P compounded annual growth rate for the next six years maybe 4x up from this year's projected 13.25% 25% similar to the ceiling projections. These are based on the same mortician forecast assumptions at the base level assumptions. This implies 320 million in adjusted IBIDA from the fluid handling segment alone. Combining both segments, the 2030 projections imply CPS delivering $3.8 8 billion in revenue and $554 million in adjusted EBI E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E I E IDIDA or 14.6% mortgage. For margins for context in 2017 CPS delivered 3.62 62 billion in revenues and 452 million in adjusted IBIDA, a 12.5% margin, which earned $721 in earnings per share. The stock traded up to $146 per share on these numbers in 2017. Ladies and gentlemen, this thing is just getting started. So if it if it generated $721 of earnings on $452 million of adjusted IBIDA and traded up to 146 time dollars per share which is a 20 times multiple let's like do a little math ladies and gentlemen 554 million in adjusted IBIDA at 13.6 higher margins. When I talk about, you know, doubles from here, I'm being retardedly conservative in my view. And that's not the right word, but I'm like retarding my enthusiasm is the right way to put it. Um, so that's that. I'm excited about that one. This is all my opinion. This is all our models. We could be completely wrong, but so far we've been damn right. And I think that's going to continue uh in material ways. And I do think this thing's just getting started. So, um next free cash flow during the quarter was an outflow of 23 million in line with Q2 of last year despite cash interest paid being more than 14 million higher this year. The outflow is largely due to working capital timing and reflects the normal seasonality of the first half. More importantly, management continues to expect this headwind. Look, I'm thinking about the last point here. I've tried to be conservative, you know, talking about because of the execution and the cost that they've taken out of the business on the same revenues, they'd earned $10 a share. They're telling you they're going to do more revenues. And here's the thing, the stock market is not going to price in that outcome in 2031. It's going to price in that outcome in 2027, 2028. It's going to start to look ahead as they start to execute and this thing is going to get multiple expansion and people are going to be euphoric and they're all going to start saying this time when the stock is in the hundreds they're all going to say start saying this time is different they you know have a secular thing with a special rubber or whatever and it'll be you know 150 maybe it'll be 200 bucks $10 of earnings 20 times multiple okay that's the rainbows and unicorn scenario um and we'll help him and we'll give them all the stock that we bought at $5 and change and a little bit at three and change and some more at $7 and we'll help him out. And that's all we do, ladies and gentlemen. Rinse and repeat over and over. Play the time arbitrage game. Low leverage, buy great companies, know what you own. And that's the story. Back to cash flow. This is despite the 55 million in cash interest paid in June which will be repeated in December. Meaning positive free cash flow despite 110 million in total interest payments. Management expects this positive free cash flow combined with hitting the midpoint of previously stated fullear guidance will result in a net leverage ratio for below four times by year end. Five. Cooper Standard continues to evaluate options for strengthening the balance sheet and is monitoring conditions in the credit markets with a global refi on the table. During Q2, CPS received an upgrade from Moody's, moving their outlook from stable to positive as management believes they are on the cusp of a ratings inflection point, potentially reaching the single B territory. CPS is working to refi both the 612 million 13.5% first lean notes and the 338 10.625 6253 lean notes both maturing in 2027. The upside implications of getting this done this done are material. For example, if management is able to refi both loans at 9%, this would save 34 million a year in interest expense or buck 93 a share pre-tax implying a trough multiple to those savings alone gets you to near today's share price. Six capbacks during the second quarter total of just 7.8 million or 1.1% of sales. This is well below last quarter's 2.6% and just a fraction of the bloated heyday averages of 5 to 6%. Levels management that has has no intention of returning to for the full year. Management continues to expect 45 million to 55 million in capex or about 1.8% of sales at the midpoint with the focus firmly on discipline investments and getting back to double digit returns on invested capital. Number seven, CPS secured 77 million in net new business during the quarter, bringing the first half bookings to 132 million. The company also earned several key supplier honors, including Ford supplier of the year selection for the Renault Group uh MDMA project, the Toyota's Excellent VA achievement award. Earlier in the year, management views these recognitions as strong signal of future opportunities to win profitable business, noting that relationships with key customers have never been better. Number eight, management continue to execute on the cost optimization program, removing 25 million in manufacturing and purchasing lean saving savings, another 4 million from the restructuring and head count reduction program announced last year. This brings the total cumulative sustainable cost savings impact to adjusted IBIDA to 687 million since inception in 2019 taken 687 million in cost out. Talk about operating leverage cubed nine based on stronger than expected first half results and continued execution. management raised fullear adjusted IBIDA guidance to 220 to 250 million up from the prior 230 200 to 235 million an 8% increase at the midpoint. Importantly, the raise is driven entirely by manufacturing and purchasing improvements, not higher production volumes. In fact, management expects to achieve despite what they called a rather depressing S&P volume forecast, which they would be shocked to see materialize. Current S&P forecast call for a North American production of 14.9 million units down from 15.1 million last quarter and well below 2024 is 15.5. The bottom line is there is material upside to guidance if and when volume forecasts improve in the back half of the year. I'd bet my bottom dollar on that 10. With the vast majority of commercial negotiations with key customers now complete, management has secured agreements that will allow them to pass through or recover nearly all direct tariff impacts in the business. How you doing ladies and gentlemen? Does it get any better than Jeff Edwards and Brad Jacobs? What an exciting week. Well, we got growth bracken Daryl the next CPS in waiting. We are excited about that as well. So, uh let's talk about sentiment. Kind of mid-range, a little bit elevated. We get it. Moving on. Earnings, top 30 weights of the IBD growth index. Expectations up 10% for this year, up 8% for next year. Materials down 2% this year, up 1% next year. This is where you're finding opportunity. This is where it's already moved. Insider buying in international flavors and fragrances. Uh, keeping an eye on that. We saw the core CPI, core PPI numbers, uh, etc. We've talked about that. Jobless claims, I mean, you know, oh, came in a little lower than expected. It's 224,000, ladies and gentlemen. So the labor part of the mandate uh needs to be paid attention to here and we will see tomorrow retail sales earnings growth 81 11.8% versus 4.7% with 81% of the S&P reported. And now on to the ask me anything section of the podcast. If you love that, um, you're gonna want to listen in here. If you, uh, don't, thank you for tuning in. We'll see you next week, same time, different place. Um, but here we go with question number one from our incredible audience. Maya R. Hi, I know you can't talk about the specifics of your option strategy for clients, assuming you could get both at cheap prices. Do you prefer call spreads or long naked calls? Um, well, they're not naked if they're long. Um, and do you really do you like really long-term options or whichever looks cheap? It depends on the company sector, industry, pricing. Um, so that's that that's that's the special sauce for my clients. Michael Travis, good morning. I've been a listener to the podcast for past two plus years. Slowly building my invest Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Um, okay. Uh, Sagar, uh, would love to hear your take on Elevance Help. Um, okay, let's do ELV. That other one was a client inquiry. um midquarter. So, we got to um deal with that for October 1st. Elevance. Um let's take a look. Yeah, look, there's going to be elevance we get every week. There is going to be a time. Let's look at the balance sheet. So, what is going on with this elevance? There we go. Health benefits company. [Music] All right. Yeah. I just just from a lot of experience, I don't know that this one's fallen enough yet. I think the fundamentals might be done falling. I'm not sure if the price is done falling on this one. I I don't have a lot of historical experience with this one. Um, let's just take a look. Balance sheet. It's okay. Yeah, the free cash flow's come down quite a lot, but that could just be it's never had a good return on investment though. like United Healthcare. Yeah, I don't cuz they will willing to bet UNH has doubled to triple the return on invested capital historically. Yeah, it's double digit and this one's been 1 2%. I don't think it's a great enough quality business relative to the valuation. I I don't like Alivance, so I'm going to pass. I just keep digging in that sector, whether it's Sentine has a lot of Medicaid. I I'd be like more up the scale like a Humana if you don't want the DOJ. I think UNH will probably work really well at some point. Um, Marco Sal Stalterini, by the way, this week we've gotten a ton of inquiries to invest midcarter, which we can't accept the $1 million accounts. If they come in materially higher than a million, we take them. Um, we do the $1 million accounts one once a quarter. But people just saying, "I've grew my account to over well over a million dollars listening to you for the last three years, and now I want to give it to you." I mean, it's it's shocking how many of those emails we've gotten in the last four or five months. I'm I I'm just That's probably the greatest email I get every day. Um, Marco Stalari, what do you think about European car makers as China sets the stage for an involution? Could they be long-term holds? I'm thinking about Volkswagen, Mercedes, maybe Stellanis. I I don't like the producers. I like the arms dealers, not the waring factions. I will never not never say never, but very unlikely I will ever buy a car producer. Nothing new there. I say it pretty much every week. Next. Uh, been a loyal listener for three years. Thank you, Ang Woo. Last week four hours long podcast is one of my favorite. Yeeha. I love that. Yeah, there by the way there was so much good stuff embedded in that. I I know a lot of you probably couldn't listen for the full hours, but I'm sorry for you because I gave it all. I left I mean I left that one all out on the field. I should have done an exit stage left after that one for sure. Um thank you for bringing Brack into the interview this week. Also, thank you for answering my AMA question on OC real estate in the past. So, is Brad Jacobs your next guest? Been a big fan of both Brad and Bracken since those TED talk days. Um, yeah, no commitments on that front. Uh, I am um blessed enough I will be meeting Mr. Jacobs in the month of September. Uh, with no commitment for any type of podcast, but just an honor to meet with him and hang out for an hour or so and uh and share ideas. So, I'm grateful and looking forward to that. Uh, there will be no microphone brought with me at that point, but um, super excited for that. Cole Flechman, can you share your typical parameters? Uh, dot dot dot dot. No, that's for clients. Next, JT investor, what are your thoughts on Crocs after the recent sell-off? Looks like enterprise value to IBIDA is 5.4 times. continue to see young kids wearing them and the Hey Dudes brand seems to be gaining properity with young men. Would also be curious how Vans is dealing with competition from this brand if you get a chance to ask management. Um, Crocs are big in the swimming community. I would not buy this with your money. I've been getting the same question since up here. Literally since $183. Should I buy Crocs? The answer is uh not for me. Let's see if I have any fundamental basis in that instinctual response. Um C R O X. Why is this not working? It's annoying. There it is. Okay. New simple. Some point you run out of chefs and and swimmers. I mean, who's left with Crocs? What's going on here? Okay, here we go. So, revenues have been flat for basically three years. 4.1 billion, 3.9 billion. So, yeah. So, revenue is flat for three years. Free cash flow is declining. Margins are kind of holding in. Return on invested capital is collapsing. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. And the price is not really down. I mean, it's down a little bit, but I think this run is over, ladies and gentlemen. I think people have moved on from Crocs. And I wouldn't be caught dead in a pair of hair. Hey dudes, just just saying. Um, no offense if you guys wear them. Total cash. So very leveraged. They've increased the leverage as revenues have stopped going up and cash flow has gone down. They've issued Oh, excuse me. I stand corrected. Their debt has gone down. So, they're paying down debt. Um, let's take a look at uh Yeah, it's still still a good business. Multiples. Look, I'll tell you what. I think your thesis is okay and I think you might make money as a trade from 80 to 100 back in the top of the range. May maybe you squeak out a double on it. Um but you really should get some level of confidence that they can reacelerate revenue growth before you take the plunge is what I would say. But I generally understand where you're coming from and uh it's just not for me. Higher and better uses of capital. Uh I want situations where when I'm wrong I make a double and if I'm right I make multi bags. Uh Edgard Abro keep up the great work. What about Lulu? Looks like the bottom's in from your lips to God's ears. Uh, I I can't tell you how many Lulu stores I've been in in the last four weeks trying to answer this question and Aloe stores. Look, we got Sun Chay, baby. They don't have her anymore. So I can say I want to believe but I got a better discretionary plate. Like the when you're down the whole thing is if you can find businesses where your downside's protected and your upside is double if anything if it stops getting worse and it's triple to 5x if things actually get better. That's what I like. I mean, Lulu, if I'm right and everything goes great, I'm lucky to get a double. And for me, that's not worth my time. It's not worth the margin of safety. I mean, I'm going to let me just see here. Again, similar story to Crocs. Free cash flows rolling over. And these are not like super Let's take a look at some of the one is a tough one. I keep looking at it. I understand what you're talking about, Edgar. It's just not as good as a VF Corp for me. I'm not saying VF Corp brands are better or anything else. I'm saying my upside is so much higher. So why am I going to commit a dollar of capital to this for a double when I could commit a dollar of capital for maybe an eight bagger with Brackens growth brackens project who's just two steps up on the turnaround plan and the growth plan hasn't even begun. I mean, the vast majority of this growth for Lulu is in the rearview mirror unless they really get creative. I mean, Alo's chipping away. Short answer is I think you're right. Long answer is I'm probably gonna miss it and be okay with it. Johnny Sat sends me a four-page question. Let's take a look at the company. I, by the way, if you can't explain your investment thesis with a crayon to a 5-year-old, it's probably not going to work. [Music] All right. So, they were on a roll. Free cash flow was going up until 20. Why are all these on quarterly? Oh, okay. Last 12 months. Okay, great. So, decelerated revenues were going up. They peaked. couple years ago, one year ago. [Music] Was this a spack or something? [Music] Digital promotion services to clients, consumer package goods, brands, promotions and network. So this looks like trade desk which has gotten smashed technology publishers to retail IPN direct consumer blah blah blah. I just don't know what the mode is with these. I never even understood trade desk. TTD getting smoked. [Music] I don't invest in these type of businesses because I can't discern the moat. If you're comfortable that no one's going to uh attack the castle and their mode is strong and what they're doing is special, which is really really hard case to prove for a $600 million company. Uh then power to you. But let's take a look. Balance sheet is great. Free cash flow is great. Revenues are still growing. This is a lot of issuance of stock. Look at these pigs. They increased the share count from 8.9 million to 24 million in one year. So, I don't see a commensurate jump in revenues. So, it doesn't look like they did a huge deal. So, they're pigs and if they screwed you once, they're going to screw you again. So, for that reason, I'm out. No respect of equity. Kirk Holligan, I really like your podcast. It's really refreshing as I get sick of all the talking heads on TV calling for a buy on stocks at all-time highs, but they were nowhere when the stock was cheap. What do you think about Nestle as a buy? And is there any way to avoid Swiss dividend tax? I have no idea about Swiss dividend tax at 35%. But, um, I wouldn't even really care about the dividend on this one if you're going to play it. I I've actually never bought a stock for a dividend, so I'll leave it at that. Um, ask your accountant on that. I'm sure they can figure out something. I mean, it's it's barely down. I don't know what I mean, yes, it's a compounder, but like I I'd be all over Hershey if I haven't already missed that. Let's see. I think Hershey's a better bet. But let's let's take a look at Nestle. I don't see anything good happening here. Cash flow is going down. Revenues are going down. Gross margins are going down. I mean, if you're buying it for a dividend, that's a mistake. I I'm going to pass. If you if you have to have chocolate by Hershey. Um Theo Djar Dan. I'm thinking that's a joke and a former hockey player. Unless it's the hockey player himself. And I think I know who this is in Canada. Wasn't there a hockey player named Theodar? Anyway, all right. My Canadians will let me know later. Uh, regarding the Ether machine, would you take immediate exposure through DY NX or wait for the merger to complete and buy shares of ETHM? Uh, no idea. I I'm not an expert in that. I'm betting on the jockey. If I'm going to bet on crypto, I'm betting on Andrew Keys uh all day long. Um, number one. Number two, I have no idea what the price is going to do. What I do see is Tom Lee out saying it's going to 60,000 and all that nonsense. Um, I don't know. Wrong podcast. Uh, I would say what Andrew I mean if I if I had to get exposure today I mean I had I had two choices. I I could have do done the pipe at the time when it dispacks. um uh or where I would have I would just be buying I think $10 a share at effectively whatever the price of Ethereum is or the NAV at that point when it dispacks call it fourth quarter or whatever versus buying now in which case I would get the benefit or the detriment benefit if Ethereum prices are higher three months from now, detriment if they're lower. Um, so I chose the private placement, sent in the money early versus later. Um, I don't know. This is this this goes in my can afford to lose 100% bucket and I think I'm going to make a lot of money in spite of myself on this one because I'm betting on a superior jockey. So, um, I personally, since you're not getting in the pipe anyway, I mean, you're basically making a bet that nine, if you're not buying DYX now, you're kind of making a bet that Ethereum prices will be lower in 90 days, which could very well be a good bet. I don't know. I'm not an expert in this field. Um, but if you think they're going to be higher, I'd probably be inclined to buy some. I think that that ticker is down because right now Tom Lee's getting the flows because they did a reverse merger through an OPCO um runoff Bitcoin miner with legacy potential legacy liabilities. We don't know or I'm not commenting either way. I'm sure they checked it out and they believe that it's clean and that may very well be true. Um, so that's how they got around that no wait period, whereas the Ether machine had to file and wait 90 days for a clean vehicle where you'll have no potential legacy liabilities going forward. Um, and do it right. And um, and that's what it is. So I prefer that way. And I, you know, and I prefer that jockey. So, um, because I know what he's done in his dharma, capital, and I know that he has an edge over his competition in terms of staking, restaking is my view uh that he has uh an edge and I think he will also have an edge in the other things that the vehicle is able to do. Um, that's my opinion. I'm biased. He's a friend and uh and I believe in him. So, um, if I was not in the private placement, I'd probably, um, you know, and potentially be 100% wrong, but I'd probably be buying some stock in the market and thinking that it was potentially going to go higher because of now finan financial institutions adopting it and tokenization on top of that particular blockchain, etc. Um, so again, zero expertise in that area. Zero. I'm sure there are viewers that have a lot more expertise, but I do have really good instincts on betting on the right jockeyies, and I have zero doubt on this jockey. Uh Alwin Lal Manhattan Associates Manh. I think this is a software play. I'm not, you know, Buffett never did a lot of the tech or software because their modes constantly got eroded. I lean in that direction. Uh, and I lean harder. I mean, here you go. Cash flow is great. Revenue is great. It's leveled off a little bit. It's getting hit with all the software selloff because there's a lot of AI is going to disrupt in that software solutions to manage supply chains, inventory, omni channel operations, blah blah blah. I have no idea what AI is going to do to this type of business. I know I know exactly what AI is going to do to fluid transfer systems and ceiling systems. It's just going to make margins go up. So, I can't I mean, the financials, I'm sure, are great on this thing and most software companies and there's going to be a pony in this pile. I just not going to play. I mean, I can gamble and win and I can gamble and lose. I just don't gamble. I bet on sure things. And that's why I have 8 to 12 companies because there's not a million ideas out there that are sureish things. And then there's always what you don't know that you don't know. Otherwise, we would own just one stock. So, we own 8 to 10 because you're not going to outperform with more than 15. The math just doesn't support it. Um, Chris Williamson. Tom, love the show. I always share with someone new each week. try to at least if you had to choose one CRK at 15 or Varco at 11, they're two different things. I mean, my basis at CRK is so much lower. I I mean, Varco is just getting started in my humble opinion. So, with new money, I mean, we we're close to a double already. And you know com I mean if comtock got down to like 11 or 12 we would start putting new clients in it like aggressively but for our existing book it's up a lot. So you know and it'll double and then double but uh Varco I think is just getting started in my view but I like them both. I mean there's nothing nothing I can tell you. I own them both. Uh Jennifer Johnson I eat sweet green daily. SG looks like it bottomed. I think a lot of the restaurant companies are bottoming. I keep looking at Jack in the Box, even Denny's. I mean, the these are dog these are bad companies, but I'm just saying like I'm noticing what's going on out there. Sweet Green. Let's see. I I I'm skeptical of salad shows like Cava Got Smashed. I've seen so many Chopped. I've seen them all come and go. Like, Americans like effing cheeseburgers, okay? They don't like salads. They'll eat salads for a few minutes because they think they're being healthy, but they always go back to the cheeseburgers. So, um, let's see here. I mean, how much money do you want to burn? Like, they can't burn money fast enough here. Revenues are slowing and they're still burning cash. I don't know what is exciting about that other than you're looking at the price on the chart. So, maybe they hail marry it. Maybe they get put taken out of their misery and Chipotle buys them or something, but um I don't see any real excitement around that. Um and I think it'll work as a trade. So I think your instincts are right. I just wouldn't if I'm not willing to buy the whole company. I'm not interested. Dedra Barlo, thanks. I enjoy your podcast. Listen to it while I walk the dogs. I was wondering what you think about Wendy's. If Nelson Peltz couldn't turn Wendy's around, there's no hope for Wendy's. Okay. He wasted 10 years of his life working on this thing. I don't see it. When's the last time you ate Wendy's? Let me see here. Okay. So, revenues trough. Call me back if it gets to six. I'll probably start buying it. I need a huge margin of safety for a business like this. It's going to be fine, but I don't think it's come down enough relative to like the upside, relative to the downside. There's no way symmetry for me. So, for for that reason, I'm out. I think you're probably right, but it's not enough upside for me. Dow Inc. I keep looking at Dowo every day. I think you're going to be right, Gareth. My materials play as Albamarl. Okay, I'm putting his name in as the ticker. That's helpful. D [Music] there. I mean, this is the problem. This is why I keep looking at it and doing nothing. They've done something to damage the business. I want to see some light at the end of the tunnel that revenue stop going down and free cash flow stops being negative. Once you get there, then this thing's going to rocket. Uh so you got to listen to the last three or four conference calls. What did they say would happen? What has happened? Uh let's just see even if you buy it wrong, are you going to live to tell the story? Let's take a look at the balance sheet. Cuz look, you could buy this thing at 20 and it goes to five before it goes to 100. So which is fine because if you're damn certain about the business, you're still going to make 5x. But you better make sure that there's no solveny risk here. Let's take a look. So, I got $14 billion of debt and two billion of cash. It's not ideal. a negative free cash flow [Music] and declining revenues. And they're confident enough that they're buying in stock while all this is happening. I think you're right. I'm not going to participate. Eric Klene, I love the podcast. At what level is Lilia by? Ladies and gentlemen, go look and check the records in November. What was it? August on Yahoo when the thing was at all-time highs. And I they made me do that segment which I hate to do because they like um goodbye gu or goodbye BE and you have to do a long stock in the sector and you have to do a short stock in the sector. And people were euphoric about Lily because they had this miracle drug that was going to change the world. And I said it is a miracle. And here comes competition, ladies and gentlemen. And the stock has gone nothing but lower ever since. And by the way, the same thing is going to happen with all these AI names and GPU, which will become a commodity producers. The next phase of AI play will be the companies implementing it and doubling their margins. It will not be the providers because the capex is too severe. they will do. So this Lily drugs productivity all the stories go back to it. What about Novo Nordisk was going to be bigger than the entire European stock exchange straight effing down from 66% drop. Are people still losing weight like crazy and getting healthy from Novo Nordisk and Lily's life-changing drugs? Yes. But now you've got competitors and competition. When you have abnormal margins, you invite competition. And both Lily, Novo, Nordisk, etc. have done that. It will be the same thing with the AI producers and providers that people are tripping over themselves. And um but right now we are not in the distribution phase like we are with Lily and Nova Nordisk. We are in the euphoria stage and people are buying it while insiders are dumping hundreds of millions on their head and people think it makes sense. So for now um so the answer is you couldn't give I I I wouldn't buy this. I mean, this would have to get down and it's not going to. This would have to get down to 150 before I even took a first look. And it's not going to. So, um, so that's that Lily. Okay. Aaron, a little off topic. I have a five and six-year-old. You and your wife do such an amazing job with your girls. Future Olympicans ain't too bad. What's your secret philosophy? Life parenting books. Your wisdom is admirable. I think part genes, part luck. Uh, and mostly lead by example. I think that's the key in anything you do. Anything you want other people to do, you got to do it first. And um, and that's that. You know, no one's perfect, but lead by example. Uh, David Simona, hey Tom, I've been following you since I saw you on Tik Tok. Started buying Alibaba. Got my basis down to 82 bucks. So, thank you for that. I also have CPS PayPal. Oh, uh, just an inquiry on selling. I don't want to exit too early or late. Will you be letting your listeners know when you think time is to move on these companies? No, at all. Uh I historically I for historically number one this is to teach you a general framework like Ben Graham taught to Warren Buffett. Okay it's your responsibility to do your own work on any investments. Number one. Number two unless you hire me as your manager then it's my responsibility to do that work for you. Um however over the last 5 years when we have exited a position we uh fully we have let people know like the Vernados like the Range Resources like the Wells Fargo like the on and on and on. So there's a good chance that we will continue to do in the future what we've done in the past but that there are no guarantees. If you do not understand why you bought it and what it's worth, you shouldn't be in it, um, you should just sit back and learn and not put any money at risk until you learn better over time. Um, but to that point, we generally do let people know when we have fully exited a position. Hunter, big fan. Thanks for making me money. You're welcome. Thank you for tuning in. What's one thing you'd recommend a junior in college do to make themselves stand out? Uh Hunter, um I go to an SEC school, so it's kind of hard to stand out to the big banks like Goldman or JPM since I don't go to the best academic school. I wish I knew this before going to college. also wish I knew. Um, okay. So, Nphase we've done a million times. Uh, we did a interview with the University of Bristol Investing Club. So, just go to YouTube under hedge fund tips, search Bristol B R I S T O L. I tell you step by step everything you should do if you want to get into this industry. Um, and then Nphase we'll do one more time. I do think this group has gotten oversold dramatically. Um, NPhase is not one. Everything looks right about it. Instinctually, I just don't want to be involved in it. I think there's just so much, believe it or not, green tech did well under Trump, did poorly under Biden. Energy did well under Biden, did poorly under Trump. the exact opposite what everyone would expect. So there is a huge pony in the pile of solar. I think it's going to work. I'm not going to participate unless it's like unless it was like first solar came down to levels where I got super excited. That would probably be the only one because I think the Walton family still owns most of it and I probably missed that opportunity in April. But it's it's not that's when God gave out FOMO jeans, he didn't give any to me. Like I'm happy that everyone else makes money in solar. I'm not going to I'm probably not going to play there. Lucas, thank you for the value you give each week. You're welcome. Uh, one of the highlights of my week. Quick question. Are there any stocks you passed on that you regret passing on? Zero. Absolutely none. I don't I don't I don't have any FOMO. I just make sure I errors of omission are not I don't even think about errors of commission where I made a investment decision. I put capital at stake. If that doesn't work, then it's on me. Omission, I could care less. Don't even think about it. Uh, Wilhelm was just in a Timberland store in Aviero, Portugal. The store was completely full. Best customer service I experienced in a while. And I was trying on slippers. Opinion. Gurishimer. He wants me to look at R E S H E I M E R. [Music] Revenu is growing, margins are collapsing, free cash flow is negative. That's a pass for me. It's a new client inquiry. Lachlan Lachlan, longtime listener here, want to ask if you personally began your career on the cell side? No. Do you believe it's necessary to start there? No. As opposed to joining a fund or family office under someone you admire after graduation or working a few years in a different industry. If you have an opportunity to work under someone you admire, uh you should do that if the opportunity is available. Well, the benefit of the big banks is that you get a massive training program and the really good one or two man shops aren't going to have time to train you. Uh, Agit Alcandon, thoughts on Dualingo? I think it's great except for the fact that AI is going to destroy this model. I think this is um my kid uses it, loves it, and it's the best in game now. But you could probably if you knew anything about AI go on Grock and have them create a program to teach you the same thing for free. So I think they're gonna struggle a little bit and maybe this is an overshot on the negativity, but I don't want to take that bet. So for that reason, I'mma pass. Tom, planning to pursue a CFA in a year or so. What resources should I be turning to in the meantime? Um, the CFA books and start now. Why would you wait two years? That makes zero sense. Lee Foster, could you take a look at Unite Group UTG? It's a UK REIT. And I've said over and over, if I don't know the buildings, I'm not doing a REIT. So, we did Vernado because I know all the buildings. Uh, this I don't see anything that's exciting to me. This looks like it's going to be a debt problem, but uh for that I This is like asking me about what the price of Bitcoin is going to be next week. I I have no idea. Um I think we're done. Wow, a lot of great AMA questions today. another guy. Okay. Well, with that said, we will be back next week. Same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat.
