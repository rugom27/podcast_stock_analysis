Fox Business varne and Co for the full hour and I learned that when you&#39;re on for the full hour which is rare uh you are part of the andco which is and Company uh having a full hours and Company so was very honored to do that really want to shout out uh Christian dagger Preston miselle uh you guys are awesome and uh of course the great Stuart vanney who uh who had me on as well so we&#39;re going to listen what I did so you don&#39;t have to listen to the whole hour is I splice so they do a 15minute segment 45 minute segment equals 60 at the end of it they basically say hey Tom what do you think about this and that and we go into different things in promptu so listen in here3 Tom Hayes is with us to help us through the market on a difficult day musk admitted that his time at doge is making running and his businesses difficult but he says he&#39;s staying at Doge for at least another year what does that mean for Tesla&#39;s stock well number one thank God for the country that he&#39;s doing that for the country to bring down yields that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very good thing with the cuts uh you know people talk about Elon Musk like he&#39;s a solo preneur working out of a Wei work office I mean this guy has 10 thou you know thousands of people running his businesses uh I think they&#39;re going to be just fine I think this is a short-term thing you have you know consum sentiment is a little low with the uncertainty in the short term we see this every four years until we have some certainty of policy so I wouldn&#39;t bet against Elon Musk it&#39;s a roundtrip since be the beginning of the election if you own it you want to bet on him the long term uh if you want to buy it for the first time let&#39;s get through some short-term volatility and I think there&#39;s going to be an opportunity the uncertainty surrounding tariffs take big picture for a second that there is uncertainty about the Tariff and the implications thereof but that doesn&#39;t bother you no you know every four years if you look at the seasonal tendency in February and early March is weakness and it we don&#39;t need great policy we just need known policy and right now we&#39;re in a period of uncertainty and we&#39;re just going to deal with this for another week but look at earnings earnings were up 18.2% for the last quarter the underlying economy is strong consumer sentiment a little weak because of the uncertainty in the short term but if we look back back towards history what we see after midm March once there&#39;s some certainty around policy the market tends to Rally into summer so be using the red days to buy we&#39;ve been buying every red day since that huge flush last Tuesday then we got the 500 uh Point rebound then we&#39;re down we were buying yesterday in the whole and we&#39;ll probably have one or two more opportunities before this thing kind of bottoms and and takes off so you guys you&#39;re serious dip buyers oh absolutely yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s high quality you know some things have been overshot the number one thing about the mag 7 the correction in the mag 7 everyone says tariffs a lot of them don&#39;t aren&#39;t affected by tariff so what&#39;s actually been causing it it&#39;s the carry trade on wine the number one people should be watching is Japanese government bond yields and today they&#39;ve backed off they&#39;re at 20-year highs they went to 157 that is a funding currency people get free currency and they invest in the most crowded trade which is mag 7 as those yields have gone up mag 7 has gone down today those yields have come down and we should see some stability in the NASDAQ today that&#39;s an interesting interpretation of why big Tech has been selling off the carry trade all right Tom stay there with me for the hour please there you go hey Tom um the crypto firms would no longer have to register with the SEC what does that mean and do you support it yeah this was related to trading firms and they it was a bit of an overreach they tried to lump it in with treasury Traders treasury dealers uh which is completely unrelated if they had a case it should have been a separate regulation that had to stand on its own merits they didn&#39;t have a case of the Trump Administration says no Moss if you are managing outside money for other people and your resp responsible for other people like I do you have to register with the SEC and I think that&#39;s a good Safeguard so that you&#39;re regulated and you&#39;re following all the rules and everything is safe for the client uh even if you&#39;re managing crypto I think for other people that should probably be under consideration if you&#39;re managing it for yourself or you&#39;re a trading firm and proprietary Capital absolutely not I think this is a good move but these changes are good for cryptos I agree likely to increase that price and value I think you know deregulation is always a constructive thing for the price of an asset and I think crypto will be no different Tom thank you you&#39;re going to stay with me for the hour lucky I all right check come back in Thomas uh you brought stock books you&#39;ve gone back to the well crown castle you&#39;ve liked them they have gone up aren&#39;t they cell phone towers or something that&#39;s right uh 40,000 cell phone towers 7% dividend yield while you wait for the stock appreciation and they&#39;re selling off the low return fiber business to over for over $8 billion to Z group uh these existing 40,000 towers that they&#39;re going to be left with and all the cash they require very little maintenance it&#39;s just a cash machine that&#39;s going to pay you out dividends they&#39;re going to buy back shares and it&#39;s a rate play so as musk is successful with Doge and yields come down these type of instruments the reats go up because they trade on on interest rates wait a minute if I buy it now at $98 a share the yield is 7% yeah just in that range and and you&#39;re going to get capital appreciation over the next few years on top of it and your yield will be locked in because you&#39;re buying low and selling High that&#39;s what we like to do on this show you&#39;re supposed to do that Stanley Black and DEA real fast what construction play again a play on rates construction has been down because rates have been high and new home starts and confidence and all that that is going to come back as rates come down they&#39;ve taken $2 billion a cost out of the business they Overstock during covid now they&#39;re they&#39;ve destocked now they&#39;re restocking uh this play is going to be great that $2 billion gross margins are going up from 20% to 35% uh this business is going to be off to the races this is a leverage play you say home builders are down I want to buy home Builders don&#39;t buy home build buy Stanley back and Decker they&#39;re going to benefit when construction back it comes back in a leveraged way much more so than the home builders do sounds like an order to me I love it my friend take that we&#39;ll take thanks Tom coming up he what do you think Tom what would a win against Canada look like I think even tariffs I think the the administration should put up a website and say Canada tariffs us this this this and this line item every single thing we tariff them this this this and this and get those numbers even that&#39;s all we want is fair trade but have transparency and say that&#39;s reciprocal tff is reciprocal want the second yeah we&#39;re not trying to start a trade War we just want a fair and level trade we import about 6 million barrels a day from Canada that&#39;s good for our refiners they refine about 60% of that 4 million barrels a day it&#39;s good for Canada because they have that heavy thick oil uh so there are a lot of good things that are happening between the countries but we just need it even we want our banks to be able to do business in Canada just like they can do business in the US uh so Donald Trump is using president Trump is using these tariffs as a way to make things Fair make it equal trade make it equal regulation let our banks do business with them and this will be a positive thing when all is said and done Tom Hayes thank you very much for being with us for the hour today we appreciate it thanks see you soon and we&#39;re back then the day before I was on Yahoo finance want to thank Brad Smith Maddie Mills Justin Oliver Taylor Clothier and John Highland I will be on for a full hour next month in Studio I believe it&#39;s April 13th that Monday it might be the 14th actually April 14th Monday 10:00 a.m. for the full hour uh here&#39;s the segment for this week to fall after seeing their worst week since September amid Moun growth risks joining us now with more we&#39;ve got Tom Hayes great Hill Capital chairman and managing member and Tom we&#39;ve been speaking about whether or not this is a recession risk trade that we&#39;re seeing playing out in the markets where are you seeing buying opportunities are you repositioning it all amid the increased risks yeah I think this is a great opportunity I mean sentiment is basically flushed out you&#39;ve seen hedge funds selling in the hole like never before in the last two weeks they&#39;re always a contra indicator you&#39;ve seen retail investors buying more insurance after the house is already half burned down you want to buy the insurance before the house is burned down put put buying is is near a record high for retail investors so we&#39;re in the normal seasonal pattern of an election uh postelection year which means Fe February is weak early March is weak and why is that it&#39;s because of policy uncertainty it happens every single four years and we don&#39;t need good policy we just need known policy uh and once we have known policy look at earnings up 18.2% for the last quarter I think things are actually in a good position but the one thing that no one&#39;s talking about that I think is more important than anything else is not tariffs it&#39;s actually the unwind of the carry trade which fueled the most crowded TR trade in the last few years which was mag 7 and all you need to do is look at 10year yields of Japanese government bonds and they&#39;ve gone from 0 to 157 that&#39;s the highest rate in 20 years and that was what we call a funding currency that had zero cost of carry now has a cost of carry so as that trade unwinds the hot money is coming out of the mag 7 and momentum stocks like paler like Nvidia Etc yeah I was going to ask you what the correlation is to the mag 7 there why why that Ms when we see an unwind of the the Yen carry trade and how that ultimately impacts some of the inflows or outflows I guess in this case for the mag 7 yeah you can actually overlay the PE ratio of Microsoft to Japanese government bond yields and you can see as Japanese government bond yields increase okay the cost of that Capital goes up from zero to uh a carry cost the multiple of Microsoft compresses and that&#39;s over long periods of time so while everyone&#39;s talking about tariffs look you know you could look at jgb chart you could look at tariffs chart tariffs chart we&#39;re near 100-year lows uh in terms of tariffs and what most people forget as you hear Holly Smoot every single day on TV is that they raised tariffs from 1918 to 1929 for 11 consecutive years to levels much higher than anything we&#39;re close to right now and the economy boomed before Holly Smoot when that was of the straw that broke the camels back uh and coincident with a a big selloff that we all know about but uh I think there&#39;s a lot of runway in terms of tariffs I&#39;m not pro tariffs but I&#39;d be less concerned with that I&#39;d be watching that funding currency as it relates to the crowded trades of the mag s and be looking outside of the mag 7 for opportunities in the US uh and be looking aggressively in international opportunities you know I guess we&#39;re all talking about tariffs though because it&#39;s what all of the companies are talking about right now too the facts that most recently saying the highest number of S&amp;P 500 companies citing tariffs on earnings calls over the past 10 years here so this this even moves through the last time in Trump 1.0 that we were thinking and talking about and seeing the implementation of tariffs and so how are companies how are you hearing and assessing companies who are trying to bake this into their own forecasts for the rest of the year yeah I mean welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 as a matter of fact I saw some analoges and overlays you could see the stock market uh in Trump 1.0 when the tarff uh talks were escalating in in accordance with the graph you&#39;re you&#39;re uh talking about and we&#39;re effectively in the trough right now we&#39;re going to get certainty we&#39;re going to know by a lot can happen between now and April 2nd uh he didn&#39;t want to do it on April Fool&#39;s Day maybe maybe he should have because I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to look exactly like they look right now on April 2nd I do think uh the other thing that people are not really accounting for aggressively is if it is a worst case scenario what it brings back on the table which had been off the table the last 8 weeks is the fed put comes back into play we&#39;ve seen the odds of a Fed cut go up to over 85% in June just a month ago everyone said no Cuts in 2025 so here we are we&#39; got the Trump put effectively coming back in potentially but the fed put coming back in and oh by the way what&#39;s happened in the background no one&#39;s paying attention to bessent and Trump have delivered on what they said they would do which everyone was laughing at when the 10-year yield was at 480 it&#39;s now down 60 some on basis points that&#39;s going to help refinance debt that&#39;s going to help stoke the housing market again as 10year yields uh go lower and uh and no one&#39;s really positioned for that home builders you can&#39;t give away right now home building supply companies you can&#39;t give away right now and I think there&#39;s going to be great opportunity there with lower and lower rates you&#39;re seeing it on the 30-year mortgage tied to the tenure all right Thomas Thanks so much for taking the time here with us today we got about 20 minutes until the opening bell here we&#39;ll leave the conversation right there appreciate thanks for having me and we&#39;re back and then I got a chance to join uh here we go want to uh JD Durkin want to thank Mill Montanas and Christen Scher for having me on nysse live and welcome back to the show this is NYSC TV live I am JD derkin in studio here at the New York Stock Exchange and joining me now is Thomas Hayes Thomas&#39;s chair and managing member at Great Hill Capital Thomas welcome back great to have you here as always thanks for having me JD uh let&#39;s start with your takeway ways a Topline and core CPI reading both a bit cooler than expected maybe helping to set the stage for investors today we&#39;re in positive territory not by very much but what&#39; you make of the numbers I think it&#39;s a big deal because as of yesterday you saw the odds of a Fed cut in June go up over 90% with inflation coming down this gives the fed the opportunity to be back in the picture and if you remember just a few weeks ago people were saying no Cuts in 2025 but what they were missing was the fact that seasonally January February inflation numbers are hot it&#39;s a seasonal Factor we&#39;re now coming off the boil inflation&#39;s coming down it brings the FED back into play um what is something about the overall markets you wish people were paying a little bit more attention to or maybe something we&#39;re not discussing discussing quite enough uh I think number one the big correction in mag 7 was not attributable to tariffs because most are unaffected by tariffs it was actually the carry trade unwind if you saw the 10-year jgb yield shot up from effectively 0 to 157 in a very short period of time when you&#39;re borrowing the funding currency and it has no cost that&#39;s good you can crowd into mag 7 when the that cost starts to go up as we saw in recent weeks uh people have to unwind that leverage because there&#39;s a cost of carry so what have you seen in the last two days those 10year jgb yields have backed up off the boil from 157 back down to 150 150 range the markets are steady things are calm mag 7 ready for a big technical bounce here but I I don&#39;t think the theme for 2025 has changed which is mag 7 underperform they&#39;ll do fine okay maybe trade in a Range maybe back to the top of this range so we&#39;ll get a good technical bounce here but real huge opportunity unmagnify those boring companies and international which we&#39;ve already seen take off like a rocket this year what are your expectations for PPI inflation data out tomorrow and what does the FED do with both this CPI print and tomorrow&#39;s print into next week&#39;s meeting yeah you know PPI tends to be the leading indicator they&#39;ve been a little better than CPI even in the seasonally strong period so I would expect it to be subdued like we saw today that&#39;s a very constructive thing that can bring the FED back into play if we have further volatility they can start saying like we stand ready to act uh right now we&#39;re going to wait be dated to pendent as they always say whereas before they&#39;re kind of like effectively alluding to the fact that they were done and kind of calm and patient now that they can say well we&#39;re paying attention we can be in play and that&#39;s what the FED funds Futures are reflecting I got about a minute let me ask you about a few of these names I know you covered closely uh let&#39;s start with Alibaba up over 60% for the most part knocking the cover off the ball recently unveiling a new AI model what do you track in there uh this is an absolute home run we&#39;ve been building this position for two years okay so we bought started buying in the hundreds we backed up the truck in the 60s it&#39;s basis 83 it&#39;s absolutely taken off it is just getting started do you buy it up after 60% wait for a pullback you might get a little bit of weakness to buy it but as far as some of the parts intrinsic value we&#39;re just getting started this is going to be a multi-year theme their stimulus is kicking in they&#39;ve they&#39;ve basically done a 180 on their policy and Alibaba is best position as an AI play in China let&#39;s close with the PayPal struggling a bit not quite down to its 52- we lows but it is trading below the 200 day moving average what do you see with PayPal bet on the jockey Alex Chris is a winner he came from into it he ran 50% of revenues that thing was a multibagger he&#39;s applying the same principles to this business he&#39;s going to generate 7 to 8 billion of free cash flow they&#39;re buying in 15% of the company it&#39;s a cash machine margins are going back up it&#39;s a neglected business this is a winner it&#39;s going a lot higher from here over the next 12 to 24 months in our opinion Thomas I know it&#39;s always a killer interview when I sit there and say I could do this like for at least another hour unfortunately we got to leave it there it&#39;s always great to talk with you that&#39;s Thomas Hayes a chair and managing member over at Great Hill Capital thanks a lot for being here thanks for having me J folks the markets are in positive territory at least sea back and forth for the D and we&#39;re back and last but certainly not least I love this interview with Diane King hall right from the floor of of the New York Stock Exchange um went through a lot of great stuff and and uh Diane remembers me because she was on Yahoo when I was pitching Baba under a hundred bucks and uh j under a hundred bucks and PayPal in the 50s and she&#39;s like boy you are contrarian all those things are working out so we gave her a couple more and you&#39;re GNA love this one and Tom hay chairman and managing member great Hill Capital we put your full Thomas Hayes I always call you Tom I prer Tom that&#39;s great Diane good to see you it&#39;s good to see you I always love chatting with you all right let&#39;s talk about kind of the broad Market weakness we&#39;ve seen first I know I&#39;ve got some notes from you I want to get into max EV but I want to initially start where we are with this uh reaction to tariffs tariffs were a Hallmark of the first Trump Administration it seems like it&#39;s going to be a Hallmark of trump 2.0 as well um what is generally what is your takeaway from the first admin ministration with uh regard to tariffs and how to operate in the volatility that we see now yeah you you can&#39;t make investment decisions on things that are outside of your control so I always like to say welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 new headline new tweet new volatility but resolves higher over time and the thing we also have to keep in mind about these tariffs is is what is implemented is a onetime level up it&#39;s not 25% % compounded at 10% per year it&#39;s 25% one time uh and that creates an environment where what we see every four years in a post uh election year is February and March are extremely weak why are they always extremely weak every four years because it&#39;s policy uncertainty we don&#39;t even need good policy Diane all we need is known policy and right now we don&#39;t know that I think we&#39;re getting some firmness on that and I think the Market&#39;s ready to uh start to have a technical bounce here okay all right speaking of a technical bounce I wonder what your thoughts are on the magx having they really underperformed this year as a group you know whether we&#39;re looking at Nvidia it&#39;s majorly down this year um uh Microsoft alphabet Google uh you name it apple as well only one that has a gain so far this year that I&#39;ve noticed I may be missing one meta uh what is your expectation are you expecting to see some kind of technical shift here some would call them oversold what&#39;s your thought yeah I do think we&#39;re going to see a technical bounce uh it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting off their 52e highs or recent highs they&#39;re all down over 20% or around 20% with the exception of Apple was down like 12 and 1 half 133% um our theme coming in as you may remember was under performance of the mag 7 they they had and it&#39;s fundamentally driven it&#39;s not just technically driven in that their earnings are are decelerating from 33% last year to 16% this year so they&#39;re reating in terms of price so we&#39;re going to get a technical bounce but I do think they&#39;re going to be a bit range bound maybe back up to the top of the range for this year underperform real opportunities are going to be under the surface mag mag UNM magnificent 493 uh uh and international my goodness the spread between International and domestic&#39;s been fantastic I think that theme&#39;s going to reoccur like we see every 10 to 15 years we&#39;ve been 15 14 15 years us performance it&#39;s time to shift back to some International so we have seen some International perform better for instance in China um is the theme of us exceptionalism over just for this year uh well when they shift they tend to be for many years as a matter of fact Reagan&#39;s second Administration uh interesting parallel uh International dramatically outperformed us did fine but International dramatically outperformed I mean the spread between the tremendous 10 Tech in China and the mag 7 is 55% this year year-to date China Tech up 45% mag 7 was actually it&#39;s more now mag 7 was down 15% so that&#39;s spreads about 60% and I know this because we&#39;ve been building aaba position for two years that did nothing and all of a sudden it went up overnight and everyone&#39;s like you&#39;re a genius well it took us two years to build a position we were buing the hundred we&#39;re backing up the truck in the&#39; 60s and here we are so I think it persists speaking of uh stock picks I do want to get through some of yours you got a few um you&#39;ve got uh Baxter International you&#39;ve got Stanley uh uh and you&#39;ve got Boeing as well where do you want to start let&#39;s start with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker because that&#39;s the most hated we&#39;re a contrarian as you know for for a long time uh Stanley Black and&amp; Decker is a construction play so they&#39;re going to say uh let&#39;s buy home builders home builders are down a lot stanle black and&amp; Decker will benefit from lower rates because construction has stopped consumer sentiment with the policy uncertainty housing starts have stopped that&#39;s all going to come back we&#39;re seeing the 10-year yield come down we&#39;re seeing that as an initiative of Treasury secretary bessent and Trump Scott Bess mortgages are priced off the 10e yield you see a high five handle on the 30-year mortgage uh which which will be fostered by you say we will see we will see when this year I think but before the end of the year you&#39;re going to see 599 something like that on the 30-year mortgage and housing is going to go crazy again meaning construction meaning Stanley Black and deckor they&#39;ve taken look they overstocked during Co because they didn&#39;t think they could get parts they&#39;ve destocked now they&#39;re restocking they&#39;ve taken $2 billion of costs out of the business that&#39;s $11 a share and their gross margins which troughed at 20% are now reaccelerating at 35% so this thing is going to earn money last time they had these kind of gross margins it was $150 stock it&#39;s trading in the 80s okay we have a little over a minute left I hate doing this okay backer well I really like Boeing because I know you just let&#39;s do Boe all right so Boe I mean when I say I really like it because it&#39;s somewhat of a contrarian pick you wonder if it&#39;s hit a bottom now basically yeah I I think we&#39;re there uh we we probably hit the bottom at 138 then we rallied to 180 now we&#39;re back into the 150s this is a great final opportunity to get into Boeing why because look love Boeing or hate Boeing they made a lot of mistakes in the last few years they&#39;ve got Kelly ortberg he came from Rockwell Collins he&#39;s fixing the thing at the end of the day it&#39;s a do so you say I don&#39;t like Bo okay go to airb and wait 25 years for your next plane so they&#39;re going to Mint money they&#39;re going to do phenomenal Global Travel is is growing their demand is going to K and the leadership now you have an engineer versus a salesperson running the company they might actually build the planes right yeah all those uh production and quality issues that yeah yeah yeah that&#39;s certainly something they had to work on all right Tom we&#39;re going to have to leave our conversation there I always love sit down with you that&#39;s Tom Hayes great Hill capital thank you so much for joining y today and we&#39;re back want to thank uh not only uh uh not only Diane King Hall but but Heidi Schultz and Ali Thompson uh newly back over at Schwab Network so thank you for that want to thank Reuters for including me in their article on the market turmoil and I continue to point to the Japanese Yen because candidly most of our names are doing just fine the ones that are affected by tariffs have just basically been grinding sideways some are a little bit down the ones that have gotten smacked we&#39;re not in the mag seven are the ones that are getting all the pain and they don&#39;t get affected by tariffs so why are they going down when the the the media keeps telling you it&#39;s all about Trump tariffs and the stocks that are going down the most aren&#39;t affected by terrs it&#39;s the carry trade on wine we&#39;re going to cover it again this week we&#39;ve been warning you for months uh to lighten up on the mag 7 and many of you did and You&#39; saved a lot of money uh and made a lot of money because you followed us into uh uh the names that are working whether it&#39;s Baba Intel now we&#39;re going to talk about all these uh also want to thank speaking of Baba Lou Bassin you can follow him at X we talked a little bit about him last week he&#39;s starting his own um podcast on um that he does follow him here and he&#39;s got a newsletter the big skinny.com want to thank Lou because he was on Varney this morning and I caught it and he was pitching Baba and he gave me the credit and I&#39;m very grateful for that again that&#39;s a good friend and that&#39;s a quality guy what they do when no one&#39;s watching and um uh really really one is Alibaba yeah Alibaba I&#39;ve come around buying cheap things price is what you pay value is what you get we were talking about AI earlier this is a great way to play AI conservatively trading at about 15 times earnings revenue is accelerating their AI growth has hit Triple digit growth for the last 6 quarters in a row uh this is a name that is increasingly becoming less contrarian and more common place got to give credit to Tom Hayes a good friend and fellow analyst for for putting me on to this one too uh dug into the fundamentals and this is it one in this Market at 14 times earnings I&#39;m backing up the truck and buying some all right Luke thank you very much join his newsletter check out his show uh super guy he&#39;s working as an executive with a oil and gas rollup down in Houston I believe uh and on Varney and all the shows on Fox Business every single week you know him well all right let&#39;s talk about markets um first and foremost I the theme that I want to get across which bessent did a decent job of explaining this morning is everyone is stuck in this tar thing and uncertainty and this really does happen every just like we said on the things every single uh new presidential cycle the year after uh February and uh through mid-march tends to be very bumpy very weak and if you remember last month when the market was up huge in early February I went on TV several times and we played it on this podcast and I said the famous buckle up buttercup and get your shopping list ready because we&#39;re going to hit some air pockets and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re seeing now that&#39;s the bad news the good news is not only do you see weakness in February through mid-march because of policy uncertainty every single time uh you see a monster rally from March through the summer uh once you get a little bit of clarity on what policy is going to be and what is that change going to be in our view is very simple we&#39;re going to move from this tit fortat fighting punching it out on tariffs which is ultimately going to lead to we expect lower tariffs on both sides because we&#39;ll say okay you&#39;re charging us 50% on our cars we&#39;re going to charge you 50% on your cars and they&#39;re going to say well we don&#39;t want 50% on our cars we say no problem how about we do 25 and you do 25 they say uh no we don&#39;t we want to charge you more well that&#39;s not the way it&#39;s going to work we either do even even or uh we&#39;ll do more than you your choice because we have the market that you need to stay in business and they&#39;ll say well can you do any better sure we how about we do zero and you do zero would that make sense to you oh no we want we want to tariff you well okay then we want to tariff you oh okay let&#39;s do zero and zero and then you get real free trade happening am I saying that&#39;s going to happen on every line item no am I saying that we&#39;re going to move in that direction because we do hold the cards in this yes and are we willing to take a little short-term volatility for long-term reward you bet you and uh and that&#39;s what&#39;s pretty darn exciting I can&#39;t tell you the number of journalists who called me this week to talk about Trump tariffs as it why is mag 7 they they kept saying mag all the tech stocks are down when is this tariff thing going I said what does this have to do with tariffs like does Google export uh uh search to Mexico or do do do they get their search product from Mexico and Canada I mean this is just you can&#39;t make this stuff up so anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely crazy how emotional people get and you just zoom out as we say here on hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes every week and actually burden yourself with the facts hold on I&#39;m going to go get my buddy&#39;s hat here we go by the way I got to figure out what we&#39;re going to do with these hats obviously this my buddy and friend and client Damian L burden yourself with the facts great Hill Capital we got like 10 of these I got to do some type of promotion with these um but we&#39;ll figure that out um here let&#39;s all right so let&#39;s just uh dispassionately take a look at the markets briefly we&#39;ve talked about everything we needed to talk about on the markets with the four interviews and three days so here is the put call ratio it&#39;s elevated it&#39;s not at an extreme but it does look like kind of a downtrend maybe it goes up a little higher after this week and we&#39;ll be up here and we could say all right if it&#39;s not going to be a huge type of thing we&#39;ll be fine I got to be honest with you I mean I&#39;m even looking at today which closed pretty weak and our aggregate portfolios are up today I&#39;m not saying that like it doesn&#39;t matter the point is is that because we are truly active managers the type of positions we take are uncorrelated where you see a lot of ACC ACC active managers that are closet indexers they&#39;re basically copying an index fund uh and then just moving the needle in terms of weights at the margins to hug The Benchmark get their fees have the pension Consultants check off because they don&#39;t you know outperform or underperform so everyone gets their jobs everyone gets their fees we do the exact opposite like if you look if you compare our Holdings for clients relative to any index there&#39;s going to be absolutely no Rhyme or Reason we run it like private equity in the public markets we underwrite each position as if we&#39;re buying the entire company and then we just try to buy companies in different Industries so we have discret uncorrelated Bets with huge margins of safeties that we can get a minimum double triple in a reasonable amount of time to three years and we rinse and repeat over and over and over and we do the turnaround Tom special durable proven businesses over and over and over so um speaking of which in two weeks time uh April 1 we will open up for Q2 opening for the small accounts uh those of you been around know our minimum used to be 5 million and they could come in whenever they wanted and uh that&#39;s been great and th for those accounts that have a better deal by the way uh they can come in anytime they want they get bespoke service for the smaller accounts which we opened up uh over a year ago and has been very very successful uh we open up once a quarter so we can manage that all in a week or two and then just get back to investing so those of you who are going to be coming in in April and I would imagine if you&#39;ve been listening to this podcast for a while you want to come in when a lot of these opportunities are available versus when everything&#39;s up uh just go to hedge fund tips.com and click on money management enter your information there and make sure you qualify and then we can start to get back to you in the next week or two and you&#39;ll be first in Q when that opens in April and you can have your application set up and we can take it from there so um let&#39;s take a look at where we are in the extremes here on a chart by chart basis just to separate emotion from reality you can see most of these indic most of these indicators that we look at from time to time are extreme and coming back or close to extreme and coming back NASDAQ declining issues tricks uh NASDAQ Coen high low this is pretty extreme here could it get more extreme if it was a one you know a big event sure you know we&#39;re right at correction territory on the S&amp;P largely driven by mag 7 all of the mag 7 uh I I think excluding Apple uh are down 20% or more um uh and it&#39;s interesting because if you recall those of youve been listening we bought uh Amazon and Google in the hole in um October November 2022 during the tech crash and they were pretty quick uh basically doubles and we sold out of those and we sold out of all that stuff and the banks in July um and they actually went up more after we sold and we&#39;re just like okay whatever they just got rich we made our money on those uh and now they&#39;re back well below that uh and it just goes to show you things overshoot on the upside they overshoot on the downside we take the middle out and we&#39;re super excited about that um some of these are getting ready for a big technical bounce but as I said in the interviews I believe they&#39;re going to be trading in a range and underperforming for the remainder of the Year our theme of international maybe that&#39;ll come off the boil because it&#39;s had such a big move in such a short period of time will persist though through end of the year and Beyond so that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to continue to focus um but you can see a lot of these sectors are getting completely oversold uh materials there&#39;s so much to do in materials so many new names that we&#39;re researching and ready to allocate to in addition to our existing one um healthc care kind of mid-range uh intermediate term volume momentum so like often this was a bounce area sometimes it gets to a more extreme we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s the case this time uh but you know Dow is getting close to buy all SNP pmo by SPX is kind of at the level you usually get bounces could get a little bit more extreme maybe we flush Monday and then turn around Tuesday we&#39;ll see um uh bullish percent S&amp;P 500 this is an area where you tend to get some bounces unless it&#39;s an extreme one uh but I like the risk reward here and I like it on a discreet BAS as I go through a lot of the names that we talked about and other names that we own for our clients that we haven&#39;t talked about I just love where they all are and some are going well against the train uh well Against the Grain while everything else is going down they&#39;re going up you&#39;ve seen it obviously in Baba you now see it in Intel which we&#39;re going to talk about today um and uh and several others and and we think that&#39;s going to continue and then a lot of them are just sitting there like Advanced Auto Parts like um Stanley Black and&amp; Decker just sitting and waiting so while the Market&#39;s crashing around them they&#39;re kind of just in this holding pattern and I think usually what you see in crashes is a new leadership group comes out and I do think as the rates come down we&#39;re going to see a lot of these just Skyrocket even including gener uh and others here&#39;s the melen oscillator uh that was the NASDAQ one here&#39;s the niky one uh so again you get these flushes and you get the you know kind of check backs and then straight up so I I think we&#39;re mostly there on a company by compan basis this might have to work itself a little bit through but uh here&#39;s the uh uh volatility index uh spiked up you know it&#39;s it&#39;s way too late to buy insurance uh for all the people we have record Put buying this week we have record selling in the hole that&#39;s the kind of stuff I like to see and we&#39;re in the market on red days buying stocks and that&#39;s the name of the game so uh moving along here we got a double of these there we go quote of the week if you want to have better performance than the crowd you must do things differently than the crowd not be a closet indexer not chase the shiny objects that we warned about and we covered last week how badly all of them have been hit I mean it&#39;s just staggering you know it&#39;s funny because you know people know I&#39;m in the markets are like how you doing I&#39;m like pretty well how are you they&#39;re like oh man it&#39;s so bad I&#39;m like what what do you mean they&#39;re like all my tech stocks are down like it seems like you know in talking with the average bear even the average money manager they are so concentrated in all this stuff that got shellacked so while the indices are down single digits I mean some of these guys are down like 30 40% because they had all that stuff and they had it with leverage and uh you know you just got to know when the crowd is getting swept up and step aside and and lose the fomo gene that leads people to these outcomes uh some of this volatility you saw Millennium uh huge hedge fund kind of blowing up they had a um a note on Bloomberg one of the strategies was like completely for selling last Friday uh b gford a growth fund they&#39;re getting smoked so uh think differently than the crowd is the name of the game and here&#39;s the master Warren Buffett himself the most important quality for an investor is not intellect you need a temperament that neither derives great pleasure from being with the crowd or against the crowd and I&#39;m noticing a lot of the smart you know some of my smartest clients I have been calling me this week uh basically saying are we allowed to put money in you know in the middle of the quarter I&#39;m like yeah you&#39;re already an existing client you can put money in whenever you want just give me a heads up so I know there&#39;s cash there to uh to deploy right away um and uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh anyway I love environments like this this is like this is this is my favorite time in the business is to be around during periods like this uh especially when we saw it coming and and we were talking to you guys so uh so you all buckled up buttercup I know you didn&#39;t own any mag 7 and uh and here we go so uh here is what I&#39;m watching though for this whether or not this turns into something more serious is the high yield option adjusted spread basically high yield credit spreads uh this is very very very subdued very open up I think we&#39;ve got a few more years I think this is going to look a lot like 2001 to 2007 which we we&#39;ve talked about um and we&#39;re kind of here we could see these spreads blow out a little bit if it gets crazy with the tariffs but right now they&#39;re doing well that&#39;s what we keep this is the chart that no one&#39;s paying attention to that we&#39;ve been talking about for six months is to watch the Japanese government bond yield and watch the carry trade unwind all of this hot money is coming out and while all the media is blaming tariffs all the money is coming out of mag7 which are unaffected by tariffs why because Japan has been printing money for three decades they&#39;re getting inflation and now they have to raise rates to quell the inflation and every day you see this go up mag 7 goes down today was no different you know and we will continue to see this so that&#39;s why for three plus months we&#39;ve been suggesting lighten up on your mag 7 this is not good what&#39;s going to happen to those crowded trades and what&#39;s going to happen under the surface is fortunes are going to be made and we got our first taste of it barely a taste it&#39;s like a sample when you go to the ice cream parlor we&#39;re going to get the whole Sunday Inc coming months and years which is what happened with Alibaba that&#39;s just the beginning of what&#39;s going to happen what happened today with in all of these I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m super excited about Intel as a matter of fact it was so funny I saw the news last night and I get and I was flying home from uh um New York and I get in this morning and I&#39;m like I know I bought a lot of Intel I just like I really hope I bought enough and I look and and I&#39;m looking at the position I&#39;m like oh my gosh this is our third largest position this is unbelievable because it just kept going down and we kept buying more uh you know it was like went 19 to 23 and then it dropped back to 21 and we&#39;re like we bought more then it went up to like 25 or 26 then it went down to 21 we bought more because why because it was trading if they liquidated the whole thing tomorrow we would have got back like 20 25 bucks so we had our downside protected if they completely screwed up the Fabs we&#39;d probably have a double on the Legacy business with the refresh is see CPUs and if they actually got anything right we&#39;d have a triple and if they really got someone to run it uh which they by the way they just did this thing could be a five bagger plus because guess what your broadcom your nvidias your your chip quote unquote designers think that they&#39;re brilliant but they rely on the kindness of strangers if tsmc goes away tomorrow Nvidia ceases to exist because no one can produce their designs so Intel is going to solve that problem for the world and help them out and they&#39;re right now testing Nvidia chips and avago chips uh or broadcom in Intel factories and the 18a is looking better than everyone expected and now you got a winner which you&#39;re not going to believe what I have to say about this guy today who&#39;s G to run us and take it to the promised land I thought Ginger could do it because he was on the 5 yard line uh this guy is going to be able to spike the football not just once but probably five times it&#39;s going to be a complete blowout as they increase capacity and by the way the turnaround for those of you who are in inidia and just got slacked um nvidia&#39;s next phase will be dependent on the success of Intel so if you&#39;re playing Nvidia you&#39;re better off getting more leverage playing Intel because if Nvidia is going to double from here Intel&#39;s probably going to 5x from here is really what what it&#39;s going to take and honestly I hope that happens I hope Nvidia doubles from here because the only way they&#39;re doubling is if intel provides the excess capacity uh because even if tsmc breaks ground on$ 150 billion dollar of factories tomorrow in Arizona or Ohio or wherever the hell they want to put them it&#39;s going to take them five years Intel&#39;s been wasting money for the last five years but they&#39;re ready to go so there you go uh just like everyone talking about tariffs affecting Netflix what it&#39;s the effing carry trade wake up look at this chart every morning stop looking at the S&amp;P just look here if it&#39;s going up Tech is going to have trouble today if it&#39;s going down Tech is going to rally and and probably in big violent bounces when it when it uh eases up all right in preparation for our amazing special guest next week the CEO of Cooper standard Jeffrey Edwards I want you guys to impress this chart in your brain this is you USR going all the way back to 1967 so almost 50 years uh excuse me more than 50 years uh we&#39;re basically almost 60 years and what&#39;s the common denominator ladies and gentlemen is that SAR Peaks out every single cycle every single 7 to 10 years you have Peaks and TRS this this is the definition of a cyclical business it&#39;s why we bought it when we bought it at the bottom of the cycle when no one wants it it Peaks out between 17 and 20 million units 17 and 20 million units so our whole thesis was predicated on in 2017 they had uh 17.1 million SAR they generated $7 and 19 cents of earnings because of all the operating leverage as you get over their Break Even which is 151 153 whatever it happens to be in terms of production um and they minted money so at $7.20 a share the market assigned them a 20 times earnings multiple and the stock was $146 they have since taken out tons of costs 500 600 million in costs which means that if they get the normal cyclical top between 17 million and 18 million the thing can earn 7 to $10 plus I think it&#39;s going to be over $10 a share we&#39;re going to talk about potentially why uh next week we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to stress test our our thesis on the CEO and see if he agrees or disagrees uh and he also has the right to not answer and uh not and smile and not respond if that&#39;s what he chooses to do uh but here&#39;s the other thing ladies and gentlemen so we&#39;re like oh we could just get that back to 17 million okay let me tell you what didn&#39;t exist uh the last four times that we peaked well above 17 million at cyclical tops I&#39;ll tell you what what didn&#39;t exist number one you didn&#39;t have cars that were on average 13 and a half years old the oldest that they&#39;ve ever been breaking down by the minute uh so number one that didn&#39;t exist I&#39;ll tell you what else didn&#39;t exist the number of human beings in a America didn&#39;t exist and take a look at this ladies and gentlemen in 1986 which is very similar second term of Reagan after coming off a depressing 1982 which was attributable to what by the way the huge vulker tax uh uh the huge vulker rate hikes just like we had with uh Powell here in 2022 that crashed the car market it came back just like this trickled up here and then just spiked when no one expected a little bit of fake back maybe we&#39;ll get a little bit of fake back and then a huge Spike up to 17 18 and then 20 million 21 million SAR by the end of Reagan&#39;s term so two things that didn&#39;t exist during that ladies and gentlemen number one rates were a little higher even though they had come down off the vulker high okay leave that aside okay we&#39;ve got how many people in America right now about 330 million by the US Census do you know how many we had when they did 20 million SAR after the vulker uh hikes crashed the car market they only had 226 million people ladies and gentlemen so they did 20 million cars catch up on a third less of the people 100 million less people they did 5 million more cars it was catchup after rat started coming down off the peak and you had Reagan part two well now we&#39;ve got Trump part two the only difference is from 26 226 to 331 is almost a 50% increase uh we got the cars that are older than they&#39;ve ever been it would not Shock Me okay and I was too damn conservative when I bought this company at $510 and $5.50 in in May of 2022 I mean don&#39;t get me wrong we own a ton of it but um and we&#39;ve added every single opportunity new money came in today I&#39;d be buying a ton of Cooper standard at 13 and14 all day long personally and I will by the way and new money is coming in this week so uh just from existing clients because we&#39;re not open to new new smaller accounts uh until April 1 but uh I think we&#39;re going to hit 20 for a minute in this cycle and maybe we&#39;re going to get a fake back before that with a little bit of the consumer confidence in the second quarter although they were going to pull forward production in the first quarter because of this deadline which uh may prove to be such a blessing in disguise imagine they do this deadline they pull all this production forward the tariffs aren&#39;t as bad as possible and you keep those elevated production levels and the business is set up to just absolutely minant money so this is the biggest thing that I had never thought about is I kept saying well we&#39;re going to get back to 17 to 18 because we we&#39;ve done that every single cycle for the last 40 years what I and by the way the 70s okay which which peaked at like 16 and change which they&#39;d still probably earn five6 dollar a share and we&#39;re going to talk about why uh the population was only 203 million I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up ladies and gentlemen I think there&#39;s so much pent up demand we could wind up but just on 17 17 and a half I think we easily do $10 a share and I&#39;m going to explain why next week uh and God forbid we actually get to8 192 then then the question is what multiple do you apply maybe we don&#39;t get a 20 multiple like we got in 2017 or they got in 2017 I didn&#39;t even know they existed in 2017 so maybe at $10 we only have a $100 stock well we&#39;re a $13 stock now that wouldn&#39;t be the worst case scenario what if we get a 15 times what if we get a 20 times multiple I am so excited about next week uh but I&#39;m also excited about this week why because Intel&#39;s getting upgraded why because lip Boot tan was appointed the new CEO he was on the board he resigned because he didn&#39;t like the direction they were taking they came back They begged him to join that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened and all these words I mean this is almost comical by the way these uh uh firms came out Bank of America maril lanch Morgan Stanley they come out and say oh this CEO looks good why because the stock was up 133% overnight so they had to take their price Target up from 20 to now 25 I mean you&#39;re taking your price Target up $5 on lip bhan are you smoking crack I mean let me tell you what lip boan did at Cadence Design Systems okay he came into Cadence designs January of 2009 after the stock was down 85% okay and it was trading at $3.50 in January of 2009 when he was appointed full time CEO and over from 2009 to when he left as executive chairman on May of 2023 the stock went from 350 to $239 okay so basically in 14 years you had a 68 bagger if anyone knows how to run a turnaround it&#39;s lip boo tan and that&#39;s 6800 and for those of you who don&#39;t add well okay $1 million investment when he became CEO became a $68 million value by the time he stepped down 14 years later 1 million became 68 million 100,000 became 6.8 million 10 million became 680 million 100 million became $6.8 billion dollar riding this winning jockey who knows the business inside up out upside down and sideways and these Schmucks are upgrading at $5 a share you can&#39;t make this stuff up but if it wasn&#39;t for people like that we wouldn&#39;t have opportunities like this bet on a winning jockey ladies and gentlemen and Watch What Happens total option put volumes moving average 5 day retail investors buying all the insurance available in the world after the house is burned down at the highest prices possible do you think these guys are going to get paid out on their puts in the hole no the sellers are going to make Bank the buyers are going to lose 100% it&#39;s the way the game works it&#39;s the way the game has always worked there&#39;s no way in hell even if the market continues to go down for the next two weeks I guarantee you by option expiration where you look where all the weights are which is probably probably in April and May I guarantee you these things aren&#39;t paying a goddamn Penny to one person who bought a put option in the last week when they went to record all-time highs which always marks a bottom ladies and gentlemen uh here we go uh bull bear spread again extreme that we have not seen basically since the covid lows in 2020 and that was time to be a buyer not a seller and 2020 was a little different cuz was more pronounced when you have a drop this Steep and this pronounced it tends to recover more quickly and I think that&#39;s where we are so even if goes a little lower maybe flush Monday and then turn around Tuesday we&#39;ll see uh I think we&#39;re basically there and we&#39;re certainly there for the type of stocks that we buy as would I be you know if you put a gun to my head would I buy would I you know they say you got to buy a MAG 7even I you know maybe I&#39;d buy some Amazon here maybe I&#39;d buy some uh maybe I&#39;d buy some Google I don&#39;t know man I&#39;ve been using and that is the most incredible thing uh I&#39;m really impressed by grock which is U musk AI through Twitter um so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know I don&#39;t know but they&#39;ve got Yahoo and they&#39;ve got the data center business they&#39;ve got all that stuff but but I&#39;m not I&#39;m not no one&#39;s putting a gun to my head so therefore I&#39;m going to buy the things that I feel comfortable have a huge margin of safety I don&#39;t have to worry about the market every single day I know what the business is worth and I know I&#39;m going to get my doubles or triples in a reasonable amount of time rinse and repeat over and over uh this is a phenomenal thing a friend did for me because I&#39;ve been talking about the uh carry trade unwind and we showed last week how the Microsoft PE contracts as the 10-year jgb yield increases showing that the carry trade is in fact impacting things here you can see it a little clearer uh although it&#39;s not concentrated to the mag 7 which I think is the most crowded it&#39;s just NASDAQ 100 the um I don&#39;t re okay they did the currency TR uh thing too I don&#39;t really care about that what you can see here is the green line is jgb 10year yields they get these abrupt spikes and you get a crash in um when they Spike up the NASDAQ in blue crushes so it&#39;s an inverse relationship you get the spikes in uh the 10-year yield uh Japanese government bonds which means the carry trade unwind you get a deleveraging in the crowded trades spikes and then Del leverages spikes and then Del leverages and this is uh you know this is just the way it works this shouldn&#39;t be surprising but apparently for those you remember last year we were showing this chart and we said we&#39;ve never seen an opportunity like this how overvalued the mag 7 uh was relative to Chinese Tech double top double bottom well what&#39;s happened this has gone straight up this has gone straight down they are converging these divergences are where fortunes are made and we&#39;re at the early stages ladies and gentlemen here we go hedge funds have dumped stocks over the last two weeks at the fastest Pace in history that is a contra indicator they did the exact same thing in late 2020 when we were were buying until our hands were sore um the tech that were they were s selling in the government we&#39;re generally not Tech investors but it was so damn cheap to buy Amazon and uh and uh and Google and um and meta I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up same thing happen happened in 2018 in the beginning when there was the Tariff TRS and then sure enough you got the rally into the summer everyone forgets that uh memories are short this is a better characterization we&#39;re kind of like right here ladies and gentlemen so if we get a final flush or if we got it this week I don&#39;t know and then you just go straight up into summer is effectively what happens uh steifel upgraded VF Corp this week to $35 price Target we&#39;re going to spend some time on that uh in the article of the week this shows the different draw Downs uh throughout the years and recoveries here&#39;s the Bloomberg dollar Index again just rolling over as we had anticipated 10-year government bond yield this is now 157 that&#39;s why you saw volatility in Tech this week and not really a lot else mostly just Tech and chinate Tech was up and the businesses that have a large enough margin of safety people are just crowding out of as the carry trade on wines and you have forced structural liquidations redemptions um from those funds that were overweight uh got smoked better than deep seek and open AI Alibaba touts open source AI model that beats Rivals and they&#39;ve also said it outperforms deep seek and it uses fewer resources so what was the theme that hurt Nvidia deep seek said we can do the same or better with a lot less chips well now Alibaba saying thank you deep seek not only can we do better than open Ai and better than you we can do it with fewer resources than you have so suck it is what they said it&#39;s basically what it comes down to so um uh there we go so S&amp;P 500% of members above the 20000 day moving average uh so breath is closing in a little bit it this seems to me like where it wants to settle out we&#39;ll find out worst to First trailing and predicted 10-year Total return by stock category well uh everyone was saying us exceptionalism now it has the lowest expected return everyone was saying uh stay away from International uh or stay away from Emerging Markets now it has the highest expected return for the next uh 10 years over double digits and developed xus no one you couldn&#39;t give it away two months ago now it&#39;s has the second highest expected return so amazing how quickly things change last shall be first ladies and gentlemen you remember the themes in the Articles so that&#39;s playing out before your eyes fed fund Futures uh this is a complicated chart all you need to know is last time I looked at it yesterday June chance of a cut went up to 90% huge outflow from crypto this week so all the leverage trades uh like mag 7 like crypto like the r rip uh risk on that are dependent on free funding currencies are getting unw uh in recent weeks largest four-weekly inflow into European equities in 10 years okay so this is the kind of thing that you saw when 2001 and 2002 when emerging markets in international and small cap and value outperformed for seven plus years all the conditions are setting up everyone on this podcast the last six months knew it was coming prepared for it and now we&#39;re taking advantage so congratulations to you and for those of you who are new there&#39;s still plenty of time still incredible opportunities uh to get money to work soon the window&#39;s going to close very very quickly but um now is the time and super duper excited you know it&#39;s like a lot of people are like yeah but I feel like I missed Alibaba and you said to come in in January and all that stuff and look what&#39;s happened Alibaba and that&#39;s absolutely right you did miss it but that&#39;s the bad news the good news is uh you know we have more ideas than we have uh available Capital we&#39;re fully invested here I mean this is the time you want to be buying on red days this is where you when you look back 12 months like we did in March of 2023 and October of 2022 when we were pounding the table uh you know those things don&#39;t come around all the time and there&#39;s just so much exciting stuff to do right now and um uh this is like a kid in a candy store I got to be honest with you core wrist model this is getting to an extreme that&#39;s from macarts decom um so that&#39;s that the momentum ETF cracking of course hang Sayang broke out back tested and now it&#39;s it&#39;s green again so you know I it&#39;s so funny because now everyone&#39;s coming to me and asking should I buy Alibaba and I feel so bad it&#39;s like it&#39;s up you know more than 100% off the lows and in a relatively short period of time and I know it&#39;s going up a lot more but like to tell them to buy I&#39;m like well hopefully wait for a pullback I don&#39;t I just don&#39;t know if you&#39;re going to get it we kind of got it into to the 120 so it&#39;s like do I tell them to buy at 140 and then it goes to you know 125 and they&#39;re like scared or whatever before it goes to 200 I I don&#39;t know you should have been listening a year ago when all of us were on here white knuckling it at60 and $70 saying yeah I&#39;ll buy more and uh bringing our bases down I mean it&#39;s just fun all right so uh there we go relative performance Max draw Downs what else do we have here a AI I bearish sentiment at all-time highs we haven&#39;t seen this High bull versus bare ratio since the lows in October the last time I was this giddy about opportunity uh so here we are again ladies and gentlemen so that&#39;s that the only difference is I know that the mag seven are going to technically bounce and probably have a violent bounce here at some point but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to trade above their range for a while I I think they&#39;re going to continue to underperform for at least the next 12 months um they&#39;re great businesses they just got ahead of themselves and I think there&#39;s just so many more better risk rewards you know and even if I bought you know if someone put a gun in my head and I had to buy Amazon and I was right and it went up 50% over the next 18 months I don&#39;t get into any stock for 50% if I can&#39;t get at least a double in two or three years I won&#39;t take any risk of capital so it&#39;s got to be at least a double plus and I just don&#39;t see it in those names at all or anything close to it for the foreseeable future over the long term yeah for sure probably but uh not in the short term US Stocks lag in global peers by record amount this has even become more pronounced so it&#39;s like a 15-point spread if you go tremendous 10 China the top 10 Chinese tech stocks uh relative to the mag 7 the spread is now almost 65% year to date because China techs up some 55 no it&#39;s it&#39;s almost 70% % and mag 7 was down 15 uh as the basket it might have got down 18 now I mean it&#39;s just it&#39;s unreal I mean I couldn&#39;t have made the stuff up and then what does City Group do after China Tech doubles and mag s crashes uh 20% and More in many cases City downgrades US Stocks to neutral after like three weeks ago it was all about us exceptionalism upgrades China to overweight I mean oh my gosh it&#39;s like walk watching a comedy movie I mean Steve Martin should be writing these uh these upgrades and downgrades you know maybe we&#39;ll get will Ferell to work for City Bank and write some of these papers fear and greed Index this is not where you want to be a seller ladies and gentlemen yeah these things can bump around for a couple of weeks but uh it&#39;s extreme Fe fear it&#39;s palpable not only did we get the upgrade in uh Intel and we got it in VF Corp but we got it in gxo logistics ladies and gentlemen Steve will put it out with a buy 60 $6 price Target they&#39;re doing good work over at steel those guys are awake and I got some friends over there that are just doing great stuff so uh kudos to you and guess what price is what you pay value is what you get we&#39;re still get buying the things with the greatest value for the least amount of price highest earnings growth lows multiple merging markets China xus us still has the slowest earnings growth for the highest multiple so yeah keep crowding into those trades and as the Kyrie trade unwinds you&#39;re going to continue to get monkey hammered every single week you&#39;ll get your technical rallies and then you&#39;ll get smoked and it&#39;s just going to continue on like that for some time mag s index draw down I mean 20 over 20% and this what I think was March 10th that was three days ago it&#39;s probably 22 23% for those people who were concentrated in the most crowded trades stock winners become the biggest losers so this is a way of saying the last shall be first or the first became last what&#39;s the best health care which we talked about remember at the end of the year materials is up there still not flying yet but but up there in the top groups what&#39;s the worst what was first tech uh uh it some consumer discretionary there&#39;s going to be some opportunities in consumer discretionary very very now like right now uh so that&#39;s that cyclical over defensive Total return rate ratio you can see that rolling over mag 7 you know conver uh catching down to uh European Defense stocks mortgage applications are spiking up this is our theme guys people looking at me like I&#39;m sideways housing&#39;s going to come roaring back when rates come down besson&#39;s got it he&#39;s got it handled and the FED will now be back in the game the fed put will be back in the game if you get we&#39;re g to see a 30-year mortgage rate below 6% sometime this year and when that happens these mortgage applications are going to go from wow like we&#39;ve seen in the last uh couple of months to they can&#39;t make a chart large enough for how many applications are going to happen why because the third thing that I didn&#39;t cover with as it relates to CPS is not only is the population bigger and the cars are older but the third thing that I didn&#39;t cover is the bulk of our population is 34 years old and the ma the the number one time that people buy an extra car and a new car is when they start families and when they&#39;re they&#39;re in their Peak spending and Peak earning years from 30 to 40 plus is when they spend all the money on extra cars and they they buy a new house they move out to the suburbs they have a kid they Buy dishwashers they buy all that stuff and that&#39;s the kind of stuff that&#39;s going to fly for the next five years and um you heard it here first but do you play the you know like we make the analogy with the uh with Cooper standard do you play The oems Who are going to be duking itself out duking themselves out for volumes and margin compression or do you pay the arms dealers who benefit from higher volumes and we&#39;re we&#39;re playing the arms dealers the generx of the world the um Stanley Black and Deckers of the world so while the supply of houses is going to pick up rapidly when these rates come down and they&#39;re going to be you know fighting against each other uh the suppliers like Stanley and like um J and the other uh covert housing plays are going to hockey stick and with huge margins because there&#39;s no one else left in town uh and they&#39;re the best brands in the business with gener having 75% of the home stand by generators DeWalt Stanley Black &amp; Decker Craftsman the best of Best in Class if you&#39;re going to construct something you&#39;re going to use their stuff uh this was the fastest Market correction since 1950 here are the list this was the fifth fastest those tends to get pretty big bounces as well here&#39;s the performance of the mag 7 this is a little old but Tesla round tripped it down 5 2% Nvidia was down over 30% the rest of these were all down over 20% except for uh Apple was down close to 20% um so that&#39;s that where are we at here we&#39;re almost done with these fund flows into the biggest US listed European Equity ETFs is the highest since 2017 China large cap ETF fxi still has an alltime high short interest the only time you had a short interest this High uh or even close to this High rather and it was only a third of as high as it is now it was a record back then was in 2016 when you had a parabolic move straight up in Alibaba and Chinese tech stocks uh was the last time you had this level of short interest now we&#39;ve got three times the short interest the more we push higher the more these guys are going to be forced buyers and unnatural and that&#39;s why I told you when we were at 60 and 70 and $80 that once this thing goes they&#39;re not going to let anyone in and that&#39;s exactly what happened I mean it didn&#39;t let anyone in and it&#39;s still not letting anyone in and it&#39;s probably going to push higher and all those people that missed it are going to miss it more and they&#39;re going to be forced to buy it over with a two handle in front of it uh and really get the you know not a lot of the meat is really what it comes down to so Opposites Attract us and Hong Kong stocks diverge we&#39;ve covered that a gazillion times just trying to make the point uh here&#39;s from Seth golden oversold threshold I think this was today uh lowest S&amp;P RSI since 2020 which was the covid lows so every single time you hit this level you&#39;re going to get a monster bounce historically let&#39;s see if that holds true again this time I would bet that that is correct uh and so on CPI came in better than expected inflation numbers were good this week uh and that&#39;s that massive valuation gap between yeah us and China forward PE looking at 2223 in us China looking at 12 times and the earnings growth is accelerating in China decelerating in the US cyclically adjusted PE ratio in the US this is mindboggling cyclically adjusted PE ratio in the US is 38 times the highest it&#39;s been since 2022 before we had that big correction uh and in China it&#39;s only 10 times earnings down from 30 times at a peak in 2011 so what does that tell you ladies and gentlemen price is what you pay value is what you get you can buy at the top and ride it down or buy at the bottom and ride it up choice is yours uh GS retail favorites getting smoked value is outperforming and has been on the rising relative trend for a few months especially in the US value outperforms growth what have we been saying ladies and gentlemen stocks have bottomed on March 12th in the past 20 years you are here so here we are ladies and gentlemen we&#39;ve shown similar charts like this uh expect good things to happen in coming weeks or sooner takes the Bulls have a bull market okay so here you can see here when you get the bull bear sentiment this flushed out you tend to get big uh recoveries sometimes you get double downs we&#39;re not facing anything economically that I think would warrant these type of double rollovers that that you&#39;re that you&#39;re talking about here have we finally reached Peak truck this is part of our kind of theme we&#39;re going to see more volume of houses but they&#39;re going to be smaller we&#39;re going to see more volume of cars and they&#39;re also going to be smaller risk appetite completely flushed out sector Outlook everyone&#39;s bullish on what&#39;s worked in the rear view mirror um I think there&#39;s going to be some opportunities here in uh consumer discretionary which we have some so Staples inflows people crowded into defense and healthc Care that&#39;ll probably back off uh in coming weeks and that&#39;s that let&#39;s go to some of the news people underestimate the importance of Chinese president Z&#39;s entrepreneurial meeting that&#39;s from alibaba&#39;s Joe Sai the importance of the meeting has been underestimated adding that quote it gave us the confidence to put our earnings back into capex Investments that&#39;s what you need to hear China&#39;s way to drive economic growth is getting consumers to unleash $20 trillion of rainy day savings says Alibaba chair Joe Sai they are pushing internal consumption domestic consumption and Alibaba is the toll taker middle class and upper class high quality consumption which is what they need to grow as an economy and given the targets that they&#39;ve set that is exactly what they need Alibaba releases AI model that reads emotions to take on open AI us China discuss a trump G Summit for June I mean if I&#39;d shown you these headlines uh last year you would have said I was crazy but I said this type of stuff was going to take place when you got a pragmatic Administration in in power as it relates to China yes he&#39;s going to drive a hard deal and yes he wants to do business he just wants to do business alibaba.com targets 100% AI adoption by merchants in 2025 in global expansion Drive Alibaba revamps Quark search engine into AI super assistant at China&#39;s Tech race picks up Chinese stocks find favor on deep seek trade as City Group downgrades us equities how alibaba&#39;s new RIS SCV chip hits the mark for China&#39;s Tech self-sufficiency Drive oh did I mention they&#39;re in the chip business which we talked about a year ago tsmc pitched Intel Foundry joint venture to Nvidia AMD broadcom sources say don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen with the new cea I think CEO I think lip buan is gonna say thanks but no thanks ladies and gentlemen I got it step aside you need me more than I need you you need capacity I got capacity let me show you how it&#39;s done uh there you go semiconductor veteran will succeed co- CEOs David zizar and Michelle Johnston hus uh Intel CEO signals that he&#39;ll stick with contentious Foundry plan of course he will he knows it&#39;s a monopoly it&#39;s the or excuse me it will be a duopoly right now it&#39;s a monopoly run by tsmc they&#39;re running the tables Intel&#39;s coming to play they have everything that Nvidia needs and avago needs which is capacity the reason nvidia&#39;s growth rate has decelerated from 250% revenue growth to lower than probably 40 30% by this year uh end of this year is is not for lack of demand it&#39;s for lack of ability to produce their business is ryant on the kindness of strangers and tsmc can&#39;t give them more than four billion of Revenue growth per quarter and when the base gets bigger it&#39;s a decelerating growth rate and when you have a 30 time sales multiple people say I can&#39;t pay that multiple if growth is decelerating uh why why it&#39;s decelerating is immaterial the fact is it&#39;s decelerating so you can tell me all day the cows come home people can&#39;t get chips and I&#39;ll tell you yeah that&#39;s exactly the problem people can&#39;t get chips Intel&#39;s going to solve that problem maybe it gives Nvidia the chance to have a second second wind once that capacity comes online but in the meantime uh they&#39;re handcuffed and uh and that&#39;s not going to change anytime soon until lip Bo tan saves the day and like I said if lip Bo tan Saves the Day why would you be in a stock that could be double uh called Nvidia when you could be a stock that could be a five to seven bagger in intel if they actually deliver on what&#39;s needed by the iagos the uh uh amds uh the nvidias of the world and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to take place if anyone can do it it&#39;s this guy Ginger probably would have done a decent job he was at the five yard line but um I I I just love how this played out Kelly Blue book report new vehicle prices increase year-over-year in February with record EV incentives and booming six fig sales so here is the average car price so it&#39;s basically Flatline since Fe February of 2022 this probably will start to go down by the end of the year as people opt for uh smaller or midsize cars and hybrids these incentives went straight up they&#39;re checking back a little bit we need to see them around 9 or 10 uh and I think we&#39;re going to get there very very soon once all these volumes start to come in uh which is going to be a function oh and by the way the one thing that I didn&#39;t mention in all of those Cycles the other thing that didn&#39;t exist which I&#39;m kind of surprised that he brought up I I understood why he said it in the campaign when Trump said he wanted to make interest payments on car loans tax deductible for individuals uh I was surprised I heard it after he got elected so this guy&#39;s following through he wants that in the tax package taxes on tips eliminated and interest rates um interest on car loans deductible you you couple that with 40% greater population oldest car Fleet uh I think we&#39;re I think we&#39;re being too conservative on this one is really what it comes down to I thought I was being overly optimistic now I think I&#39;m being too conservative us car buyers rush to dealer lots to avoid tariff related price hikes so they&#39;re gonna try to jam in a lot of production before August 2nd and buyers are going to jam in a lot of purchases which all works Boeing ties employee incentive plan to companywide Performance Boeing&#39;s Jet delivery&#39;s top Airbus for the second straight month Kelly ortberg baby ladies and gentlemen four bagger seven years Rockwell Collins and you&#39;re saying I wonder if it&#39;s going to work it&#39;s a duopoly weekly mortgage demand surges 11% higher as interest rates drop for the sixth straight week beacon qxo in quote friendly talks on 11 billion doll deal as qxo aims to double their ebit ah Brad Jacobs strikes again let&#39;s go baby CEO Brack and darl brings VF corpse reinvention back to Wall Street so uh that is um Emily Rakowski wearing the Northface brand that can&#39;t be a bad thing I&#39;ll tell you uh Japan 10-year yield at highest since 2008 on bets for boj hikes now that&#39;s an interesting story uh so yield is the highest since 200 and eight but I think what they&#39;re also saying here is that so everyone&#39;s crowded into bets on boj Hikes um maybe if that&#39;s becoming crowded maybe they&#39;ll delay it a little bit which would also create the reprieve for the markets to Rally into summer so we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep an eye on that the fact that everyone&#39;s crowding now into them doing hikes um we&#39;ll see Euro on course for best week since 2009 Euro strong dollar weak same Playbook different day stock market and sentiment results we went through all the media here&#39;s VF Corp ladies and gentlemen you know we were just pounding the table down here our base is I think 5553 across all the accounts shot right up to 28 well no didn&#39;t shoot right up to 28 it first went against us like it always does and then it went doubled uh now it&#39;s come back to check back just like it does out of a every single cycle shoots out fakes everyone out straight up shoots out fakes everyone out straight up shoots out fakes everyone out straight up doing the exact same thing here the difference between this time and those three times is you got Brack and Daryl who created a 26 bagger at Logitech after he came in as CEO when the stock was down 83% uh there&#39;s a theme Here ladies and gentlemen you notice what I&#39;m doing here well pay attention uh so here&#39;s what you see cash flow is down now it&#39;s recovering and he just basically laid out the plan that if the and and you need to read all of this because the number one thing in a in a turnaround is solvency risk comes off the table they did that by selling uh Supreme 1.5 billion paid down debt now they&#39;re re accelerating and what he basically said in investor day and what you could extrapolate from that with the cost savings with all the initiatives with everything else if the revenue didn&#39;t grow for the next decade this would still be a double uh and what he&#39;s also said in this at the same exact time in the same exact breath is that he can&#39;t he effectively he can&#39;t see a scenario where they don&#39;t grow the whole business at least double digits and he specifically says I&#39;m not here to grow anything less than double digits which means the operating Leverage is massive and while we thought that we would ride this thing to 4045 $50 and have our double in a in a couple two three years um it more likely now looks like we&#39;re going to be holding this for a long time and this thing&#39;s going to work its way back to New highs and then by the way he also alluded to the fact not a thing you do if you&#39;re in a period of survival that we&#39;re going to get back to doing what VF Corp has done since the late 1800s uh which is uh by hot uh hot brand so they&#39;re back in they went from survival to stability to now re accelerate growth to now re to accelerating the growth and and expanding again and uh and this thing&#39;s just getting started so just bet on Bracken all this will tell you why all this will go through every detail of every plan whether it&#39;s the lady who came over from Lululemon who&#39;s going to get the women sales in Vans humming again uh or all the another other initiatives but we will be here until uh tomorrow and I got to go on cg10 America and a couple hours so go through this at at your leisure but the key is this is going to be an unbelievable multi-year Journey with Brack and Daryl and we&#39;re super excited to be a part of it the second one that we did here this week was albam Maro I love Alam Maro because the basic theme Here is that so you can kind of see the long-term view very cyclical business and by the way it was this way even before for EVS so everyone&#39;s saying oh it only depends on EVS yes but liquid lithium prices are very cyclical they go up and down and what happens is when the price is up all these producers overproduce and the small ones go out of business and the big ones like albam Maro just stopped producing waited out wait for all their competition to go out and then they mint money three L three years later when uh the price just gallops because there&#39;s no producers left and they&#39;re left standing they&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity all their competitors are going out of business oh and by the way China&#39;s got this unnaturally subsidized Market in EVS everyone says well no one really wants EVS in America anymore it doesn&#39;t matter everyone in China is going to be forced to drive EVS they got you know 40 million Global stock is going to be 120 million Global stock by 2027 2028 that&#39;s all driven by China forced unnatural subsidized markets uh don&#39;t hate the player hate the game I mean if if that&#39;s what they&#39;re going to do and that&#39;s what they&#39;re telling you what they&#39;re going to do how do you best position for oh yeah you can go figure out is it going to be Neo is it going to be byd is it going to be Tesla or you can just be the Arms Dealer and uh buy the lithium producer the best one that has all the liquidity to wait this out if it&#39;s another year great if if we&#39;re already there this thing goes straight up from 75 to 200 plus 300 plus uh and you don&#39;t have to think about it you don&#39;t have to lose sleep about it I mean it&#39;s some things are just you know some things are just too easy it it really is I mean I guess for most people it&#39;s hard to sit through the bottoming process I guess that&#39;s what makes it hard or they don&#39;t read and do the work but like okay so yeah I guess this is hard a bottom so what was the price volatility here in the last bottom so it got as low as 46 and it got as high as uh 80 so that&#39;s a lot of volatility for a lot of people if they if they bought at 80 and it dropped to 46 they&#39;re they&#39;re you know and they&#39;re on Leverage but if they just said wait a second I know what I own here I know what the Cycle&#39;s like so let&#39;s say they bought at 80 it went draw down against them to 45 oh my God it&#39;s going against me well if you&#39;re not on Leverage you don&#39;t care because you know what you own and then it went up to $326 in the next two years so you made a four bagger on your 80 if you if you if you bought more down and you brought your basis down to 60 you made a five or six bagger uh and uh and life goes on you know the same thing in 2009 the same thing in 2000 and more likely than not it&#39;ll be the same thing now and um but most people can&#39;t handle the volatility so let&#39;s take a look at this base it got as low as 71 shot up to 100 back to 71 what&#39;s our basis on this 8834 oh we&#39;re stupid people oh we bought it 88 and now it&#39;s 71 hm maybe we should sell in the Hole uh how about every new penny that we have available to put to work we&#39;ll buy more and that makes more sense to me because when it&#39;s 300 again we&#39;re going to be glad that we&#39;re bringing our basis down from 8834 to hopefully 77 when all is said and done that&#39;s how he do it on to the next uh here is sentiment all right so here&#39;s all the reasons why yada Y yty and by the way the reason I have conviction is because I know every single word that&#39;s here okay so you say oh I could just look at a chart and buy some yeah then that&#39;s why you&#39;re going to be selling in the hole because you don&#39;t know why you own it and you don&#39;t know what you own uh and that&#39;s why I&#39;m buying in the hole because I do all this work and I know every little nook and cranny about every aspect of the business and their competitors and everything else and that&#39;s why I can have conviction and that&#39;s why I make this look easy even though I guess it&#39;s not I don&#39;t know I never feel like I&#39;m working so it feels easy but um it&#39;s a lot of work I mean if you wanted to find out as work I I kind of feel like it&#39;s a treasure hunt but uh so that&#39;s that sentiments washed out we know that earnings Industrials remember we are in sandbagger season that&#39;s what they do every year but let&#39;s see what Industrials did they took them down 2% for this year uh exploration and production these have stopped going down they were going down double digits for a while now they&#39;re going down 1.8 I mean look I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;m probably going to do nothing with it I was looking at halberton uh HP helwick and pain whatever they&#39;re called and Murphy Oil today they&#39;re starting to look super interesting I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to do anything with any of them because we love our com stock resources we have enough exposure but we might and if we do it&#39;s going to be in the serer space and I think it&#39;s kind of ready Insider buying and selling these there&#39;s a material stock Chemical stock we love that space uh but we have our exposure through Alam Maro we&#39;re happy with that so you saw the CPI numbers came in better than expected the PPI numbers core PPI and PPI both came in a lot better than expected so again that puts the fed put back in play earnings growth for this quarter is expected to be 7.3% you know the negative GDP noise there&#39;s a lot of noise around inventories related to frontloading of tariffs in the fourth quarter and some of the uh um Long Beach um people uh importing stuff I can&#39;t even think of what it is where trucks go in not trucks boats uh docks anyway there was a rush to get a lot of goods in so it might have pulled forward so you might see a weak print in q1 but when I I look at these earnings [Music] um and even estimates as much as they&#39;ve come down it&#39;s still at 271 they only took it down $4 from 275 and this is supposed to be the time of year when they take it down a lot more and then they beat like crazy all year so and then they took next year up the backend load they took it up higher so uh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna I don&#39;t I know the Atlanta GDP says that we&#39;re going to get a negative print I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s going to be the case because they haven&#39;t been super accurate let&#39;s see what the FED funds Futures we talking about today as it relates to a June cut uh just want to see if this is still at 90% June 89% is May on the table now no May is a 211% and what about March 9 next week There&#39;s a 2% chance so you&#39;re saying there&#39;s a chance uh very unlikely but we could see a change in the doish rhetorics so leave leaving that aside uh we&#39;re done with the podcast for everyone who likes to stick around for the ask me anything questions which come from our listening studio audience which we&#39;re excited to cover each week we&#39;ve got an awful lot this week so we&#39;re going to go through them at some point in time we&#39;re going to have to be more selective because we&#39;re just getting so many now but we&#39;ll continue to try to do every single question we can and uh for those of you who don&#39;t stick around for the ask me anything questions we&#39;ll be back next week for the most amazing podcast of all time with the CEO of Cooper standard and we uh will be having more of those in the pipe with different CEOs moving forward but uh tomorrow the next week&#39;s going to be super special and for those of you who do get a lot of value from the ask me anything questions here we go first one&#39;s from Johnny Selenas good afternoon Tom was scanning through some charts what do you think about Blackline down here uh I they&#39;re like a software me too company I&#39;ve never been able to understand what their mode is so uh um as cheap as they are and as attractive as they look let me just take a look at their financials here I mean if their financials are okay maybe I&#39;ll spend some time trying to figure out why anyone can&#39;t just copy and replicate their software I mean look at this look at this cash generation margins are going down a little bit not good in that type of business but uh this is this is definitely worth looking at I mean this is one of those 2021 Darlings that got overbid and now let&#39;s see how many slices are in the pie revenues are still growing although at a slower rate so that&#39;s not good for bro that&#39;s a broken growth stock right there what did they do with the shares as the stock fell uh they increased them a little bit they&#39;re probably paying themselves a lot of money uh in options and so on but on balance it&#39;s not terrible uh let&#39;s see here uh balance sheet my guess is they have no debt they got 800 million of cash 800 million of debt that&#39;s fine let&#39;s take a look at cash flow uh cash from operations [Music] growing free cash flow good all right let me tell me more about this amazing software you have

and why you continue to use it for a long time or why it&#39;s just a me too product and you&#39;re planning on switching to something cheaper be interested to know uh and this one is definitely worth doing more work on so Johnny Selenas uh hard maybe uh Joe Ramen thanks for all you do by the way my daughters love your noodles uh love your I&#39;m kidding love your podcast I am close to having enough to be a client in the next one to two years all right we will be here I&#39;m curious about what you think about Trump&#39;s executive orders regarding us investment in China related to investing in Baba uh do you invest in adrs or buy your contact shares on the Hong Kong market we&#39;ve done both when the fear of delisting was acute we did some 9988 once it was relieved after the pcaob decision we opted for um the baba um look we have three key filters in any investment number one is if JP Morgan was going to finance us to buy 100% of the company the only caveat was I had to put up 100% of my net worth as the equity they would be the debt if it worked I made insane multiples on My Equity if it didn&#39;t work I&#39;m wiped out completely and JP Morgan gets the business uh would I do the deal uh on a numbers basis with Alibaba I would do the deal 100% uh on the country risk and government risk particularly when it was looking really dark uh you can&#39;t do that but what you can do is pass filter number two which was and this was the filter I had to run in my head every single day during the darkest times in the last year and two years if this position were to go to zero would they take me out on a stretcher and if the answer is yes then either I don&#39;t go into the position or I go in a position size risk management that although it&#39;s heavy and big and our largest position uh if it were to go to zero because there could always be something that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know uh that you can&#39;t control in any position position that you&#39;re in um and once I got that down to a size where I could make a lot of money if I was right but not get carried out on a stretcher and all that means is yes it would hurt if it went to zero but I have enough other good positions in enough size that I could still outperform even with that one sleeve going to zero and live another day then I could live with it and that&#39;s why I was able to lean the hell in when it dropped to 60 and back up the truck number one a lot of the other positions had gone off and bought me the luxury to do that like Google like Amazon like many Rolls-Royce like many others that were home runs uh like Vado uh so that afforded me the ability to do that but um you can&#39;t guard against it so what you have to do is say is how is this sized in my portfolio and if you&#39;re a cowboy and you say well it&#39;s the best thing at the best price and you just say I hope it works out and you put 100% you deserve to die I mean that&#39;s die Mr Bond you know I mean what what else could I tell you so yeah there&#39;s always a risk and and if it&#39;s not that on Baba it&#39;s something else on something else so uh that&#39;s that&#39;s the beauty like I say here every week they don&#39;t give away multi-baggers for free you know so what what you can do is manage what you can control not what you can&#39;t control and yeah I love I love to lean in in size and it&#39;s and it is our biggest position but I always had in the back of my mind that you have real risk it could go to zero so what does the rest of the portfolio look like in that situation and I was very comfortable and all those other stocks performed in the way that I needed them to to buy me that luxury to do what I wanted to do on a numbers basis despite the Black Swan risk and that&#39;s the only way you can think about it so yeah Trump could wake up tomorrow and tweet something crazy and uh and that could happen and that could happen with any company whether it&#39;s coer standard whether it&#39;s Genera whether it&#39;s General Motors which we don&#39;t own thank God uh um and that&#39;s the way it goes so uh that&#39;s how you manage around it Chris Williams there are there are no short things and that that the the framework that you&#39;re operating from is incorrect because if you have the view that there should be a sh thing then you&#39;re a cowboy and then you&#39;re going to gamble all of it in one and hope that you get rich overnight and everyone that goes for that winds up getting broke and the ones that do get rich overnight let me give you a little secret they give it all back to the casino Okay so create a durable thoughtful framework that not only will um keep you out of the stretcher but allow you to compound money above Trend meaningfully regularly and sleep well over time and then the other uh filters were if I were to walk into the board of directors and offer to take the entire company myself at the price it was quoted in the market would they call security to have me escorted out of the room the answer must be yes the price the margin of safety has to be so great that if I was to actually offer to buy the whole company the board would have me removed from the building because it was an unbelievably disrespectful um insulting offer and that&#39;s where I like to buy stocks in the public markets that will never exist in the private markets I can&#39;t tell you how many people come to me with private Market deals every single day and I say no number one I have an obligation I invest all of my money alongside with clients I eat my own C cooking so that&#39;s rule number one for me rule number two I like to sleep at night and rule number and number three I have control over the investment so I know what I&#39;m buying uh and number four I don&#39;t have the fomo gene yeah I&#39;ll miss some privates that wind up being 50 Baggers I could care less because all those deal junkies they take their 50 Baggers and they put them in 10 or 15 uh subpar deals and 14 of them go out and they lose 90% of their 50 bagger gain and then they wind up you know starting from a much smaller base finding a sensible manager that can compound it regular it&#39;s I&#39;ve just seen it over and over okay so uh that&#39;s that that&#39;s how I live my life very simple I only eat one cheeseburger a day I don&#39;t need 10 uh I can have anything I want I don&#39;t need any of that if I&#39;ve got an internet connection in a room I&#39;m a happy camper and a golf club in the afternoon uh good on that so uh what was curious what your thoughts are on aircap CEO saying if Boeing aircraft will go up by 40 million and every country besides us will be forced to go to Airbus uh go go ahead uh airc cap go to Airbus have fun you can get your next plane in 25 years it&#39;s the dumbest thing I&#39;ve ever heard and as you said sounds like a load of nonsense you answered your own question uh but fair point for pointing it out and thanks for listening in Ben first name only thank you for your weekly podcast was wondering why the stock market went down on Tuesday I I thought you thought I thought you said you thought it would go up this week Ben I don&#39;t give a if it goes up or down in the next two days or week or week and a half uh that&#39;s not the game I&#39;m in I hope it goes down for the next two weeks do I think we&#39;re going to bounce here and start to Rally into the summer I do think so and I think it&#39;s going to start imminently if if it&#39;s if it&#39;s not last week and it&#39;s not this week maybe it&#39;s next week maybe it&#39;s the week I I don&#39;t give two shits what I do care about is it created the opportunity to buy more of phenomenal business the problem is is our businesses for the most part didn&#39;t go down enough where I felt like a fear of loss why don&#39;t I have more available Capital to put to work it&#39;s like they&#39;re kind of just hanging around churning around while the while Tech gets smashed and then they&#39;ll go back up so I&#39;m just sitting here waiting and watching and where I have some new money come in I put more to work at lower prices and uh and then it&#39;ll rip up and won&#39;t allow anyone in and everyone will be like oh what happened and then they&#39;ll all want to buy in July when we&#39;re actually taking off a couple of positions and finding two brand new positions to replace them cuz they&#39;re at full value um so uh welcome to the podcast I can assume by the nature of your question you&#39;re brand new uh Niche Patel Tom been listening to you for over a year thank you for all the great information you give what are your thoughts on TTD seems to fall very uh seems very oversold leader in the sector didn&#39;t have really bad earnings looks to be a buying opportunity uh we covered this one a couple weeks ago I said no let me take a look at it again yeah this is a broken Momo stock uh call me up again if it goes to like 40 um I don&#39;t like these things these are momo stocks that get broken maybe they bounce dead cat bounces but um I like businesses that have been around for decades that I can just see how they operate through Cycles this stuff is like guessing for me and I don&#39;t like to guess I like to earn so uh let&#39;s just look at the cash flow so maybe I can save us some time yeah it&#39;s generating a boatload of cash GH wow all right revenues growing income statement let&#39;s see what they did with the share count not terrible uh what is this this is that ad serving business yeah self-service cloud-based ad buying platform form optimize data driven very trade desk all right 30 times all right I think this is going lower but it&#39;s ah I&#39;ll take a look at it it&#39;s kind of interesting but I I guarantee you I&#39;m gonna do nothing with this one I I it&#39;s just not the thing I do I I stick to what I&#39;m good at this is not something I&#39;m good at Griffin Brown uh hi Tom 23y old kid here recently gotten into investing stock analysis found your podcast a few months haven&#39;t missed an episode since thank you welcome tell your friends Griffin awesome stuff um when you receive a stock idea what do you immediately look to determin validity yeah uh two things it it seems like I&#39;m answering in one minute but behind that one minute is 20 some odd years of experience so like I&#39;ve seen it all or at least most of it and I just know the nature of certain types of businesses that I avoid and the nature of certain types of businesses that I get interested in but then I&#39;m looking at solvency risk is number one if the socks down a lot is the balance sheet good does it generate enough cash how has it operated through past Cycles uh are they keeping the share count relative then I might look at some multiples just enough to determine whether I want whether the margin of safety is large enough that I actually want to spend the next three weeks digging into it and its compet competition or not and that&#39;s usually a good starting point uh Chris Patterson given albam Maro significant reduction in cap back uh how do you see the impact on company&#39;s long-term growth prospects expanding lithium capacity to meet future demand uh I see that they do this every single cycle since they&#39;ve existed that basically the small players come in when the price of lithium goes up at the top excess capacity comes on board they flood the market the little guys uh go out of business because they can&#39;t stay afloat at at as prices collapse companies like albam Maro they have ample liquidity as one of the largest lithium providers in the world and they just waited out till their competition goes out of business supply comes offline demand continues or or or returns and then they&#39;re the only game in town on the way up and they mint money and then you get out at the top when all the new entrance come in uh like every time Dustin D appreciated any guidance on best places to learn more about value at risk or risk adjusted portfolio allocation strategies uh Dustin that&#39;s a load of um basically you want to underwrite each individual position as if you were buying the entire company and if you&#39;re lucky you&#39;ll be able to find eight to 12 of those that you want to own at a particular time uh but you should assume and treat each one as if you have 100% of your net worth tied up in the equity and if you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re wiped out and then on that basis you underwrite 8 to 12 individual uncorrelated risks uh discreet from V which measures against an index or some other consultant metric that&#39;s never going to make you any money so uh I will uh leave that there nice question uh Hayes W okay are you hope you&#39;re doing well thank you for your time and energy making the podcast greatly appreciated by many myself included you&#39;re welcome thank you Johnson Outdoors uh quality portfolio of outdoor recreation Brands low debt beating down all right I&#39;ll take a look I don&#39;t like this Recreation business like the uh Malibu Boats and the uh all this other stuff but I&#39;ll take a look they&#39;re all going to bounce Leslie&#39;s out um there&#39;s there&#39;s a lot of them I think they&#39;re going to start working yeah this looks interesting j o UT so no one wants this stuff right now because it&#39;s consumer discretionary and for five minutes consumer sentiment is down because of the tariffs once that&#39;s resolved like every four years all right so cash flow starting to recover revenues are still down margins are collapsing so you just have to kind of get a sense of how they operate through each cycle and what&#39;s their turnaround plan do they have a decent boun balance sheet let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet if they can if they have enough Runway 162 million and the debt is zero so that&#39;s a good start you just have leases let&#39;s take a look at their cash flow so so uh let&#39;s take a look at this wow so they really Peak during Co so their revenues are like back down to preco levels what&#39;s their share count doing here they&#39;ve they&#39;ve done okay with the share count so look they&#39;re in a hard spot you got to understand turnaround story I&#39;d probably get more interested in yeah I mean it probably goes I would I mean around 20 it would be get interesed but this is a really broken stock so it may take a while to recover um but I think it will and I just don&#39;t like this type of business but I think you&#39;re going to be right and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s generally okay if you can get comfort with their plan for turnaround not not make sure it&#39;s cyclical and not secular is what I&#39;m telling you are those brands are any of those Brands dead or they&#39;re just going to you know bounce back like Vans and and different things that have been around for 60 years Lee Foster love your pod is such a tree tape Friday I watch while working from home on Fridays can I ask your opinion on the B Canadian movement and if it will have any material upside for Canada Goose and potentially outweigh tariff concerns um seems a bit oversold to me look Goose&#39;s recovery is mostly about China so I&#39;m not really I mean yeah it needs America it needs all that stuff but again that&#39;s stuff not stuff you can control by Canadian is irrelevant uh because if your econom is weak your Canadians aren&#39;t going to have any money to spend I think it&#39;s going to get resolved with the new prime minister and um if not you&#39;ll you know we welcome you as the 51st state and Wayne Gretzky will be a great Governor so I&#39;m I&#39;m joking not joking uh but I think it&#39;s going to go better than you guys anticipate and it has really Limited bearing on the small position we have in Goose which we hope to make a much larger position soon um really enjoy the podcast you have great understanding and opinion on market trends as well as individual stocks thank you was wondering used to your I&#39;m used to okay when when when did it when did it not work I&#39;m used to all of your analysis coming true uh want to know how you handle times that uh I mean my biggest mistakes are generally timing and I&#39;ll just cover this I I&#39;ll tell you like range resources is a good example uh we bought at $11 it immediately shot up in 2018 it immediately shot up to 18 we thought we were geniuses then Co came and it crashed down to 160 we bought like crazy brought our basis down to 410 so we just you know it&#39;s a huge markdown short term it enabled us to like quadruple the position size uh and then ride it and why did we have confidence to do that when everyone else was bailing out is pretty simple because while they have to report 10y year approved reserves to the SEC uh we did an analysis of the unproved reserves and we figured it was worth you know somewhere around $60 and so like would we have liked it to bottom at 11 and then go to 60 yes uh would we have liked it to go but it worked out for the best because we were able to hugely increase the size of the position and now ride it all the way up and we think we still have juice left in this so um the main thing is if you underwrite it properly um the only thing that&#39;s going to cost the where you can lose is it takes longer than you expect and that&#39;s why you got to have you know more than one position you know uh we talked about Charlie munger&#39;s byd okay and byd was a disaster okay so he bought it in 2009 up here somewhere then you had a draw down from 10 to 5 so 50% draw down so you lost three years use of money and you were down 50% uh if you followed uh Munger into that oh that&#39;s boy gaming where&#39;s byddy there we go the Chinese uh electric company so you brought it up here in 2009 or wherever it was 20 down to two so 90% draw down then uh I don&#39;t know whether they added in the hole or not but they they held on to it for for sure and it basically did nothing for 10 years and then uh you had a 10 bagger in 12 months so you know over that time if they&#39;ve got a you know average basis of five 10 bucks and they wind up with an eight bagger uh the irr is pretty damn good 800% in 12 years so um because he knew what he owned and he was betting on the jockey and the whole thing so I think the biggest once you learn how to underwrite a business and avoid the ones that you wouldn&#39;t put 100% of your net work worth in either because you don&#39;t have confidence because you haven&#39;t done enough work or you don&#39;t have confidence because it&#39;s not a good enough business uh and you ignore the ones that are going to be good trades just because you think the price is going to go up and you may prove to be right who gives a the question is is it a good enough business that you would stake the whole Ranch on it and that&#39;s what you want to make a portfolio out of and then and be humble enough to know that you can&#39;t know everything I couldn&#39;t predict that Co was going to come and crash it from a 11 down to $160 something but I did know that the intrinsic value was still there and it gave me an opportunity to get four times the position than I would have had if it went perfectly so that&#39;s how you got to manage it you got to do the work upfront is what it comes down to the work upfront uh J and and and if you really have to be in a position that you don&#39;t have 100% certainty of but you like the risk reward then you got to just manage around you know usually those have an expected value of 10x you just got to side the position down and assume it&#39;s like an option position and it&#39;s a two or 3% position if it goes to zero you you accounted for that by the sizing so if it worked it would add 20 you know 2,000 basis points or 20% of excess contribution but if it didn&#39;t work you lost 200 basis points and that&#39;s probably a reasonable risk if it&#39;s well underwritten knowing that you can only have an EV of 10 if there&#39;s a possibility of a zero um but I wouldn&#39;t take many of those that&#39;s for damn sure I would take them very very selectively and very rarely because I generally don&#39;t want to put any money to work if I can&#39;t make it a real position of you know 7 8 10 12 in some cases as high as 20% but that&#39;s only happened once or twice in a career um we&#39;re talking covid when uh you know Exxon was trading at $33 and Wells Fargo was trading at $25 I mean those are times when you got a you know when it&#39;s when it&#39;s raining gold you got to pull out the bucket not the thimble um and Baba you know so um so that&#39;s that JT investor uh you shared thoughts on Tesla in the past do you think the extreme negative sentiment has created an attractive entry point finally on this stock seems like a long-term growth thesis is still intact political bias Weighing on the stock at this time could be a temporary overhang what are your thoughts look I would never I I never have bet for or against Elon Musk and never will bet uh I I won&#39;t say I&#39;ll never bet for him because uh I I may but uh as a car company this thing&#39;s way overvalued and their deliveries are going down so you&#39;re making a bet that what he&#39;s been promising for years and not yet delivered full self-driving Auto um uh automated robots and Robo taxis he delivers all of them and I wouldn&#39;t bet against that um I can&#39;t value it so I just avoid it it&#39;s like I again I don&#39;t have the fomo gene so like I I never bet never bet what what does Buffett say he said um never bet what you have in Need For What you don&#39;t have and don&#39;t need or some something along those lines anyway the point is is that this is not not where I excel I&#39;m not a guy that&#39;s going to predict the future and I have to have a leap of faith I like businesses where I can see the cash and the price has just vacillated to you know two or three standard deviations below the cash flow Trend and I can just play the mean reversion so this kind of stuff uh God bless it and there people probably make a 5x from this at some point I mean look if this thing shot down to 100 on some ridiculous thing maybe I&#39;d take a punt on it I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know even at 100 if I could put clients in it and sleep at night I mean this would be like something I&#39;d just be like uh guys I can&#39;t risk client money in this and I just tell everyone I&#39;m going to buy a bunch of shares personally and you know I encourage you to do it but we can&#39;t take this level of risk in the portfolio it&#39;s a punt it&#39;s a gamble it&#39;s a you know it&#39;s it&#39;s a great jockey but uh I I can&#39;t get my hands around the valuation unless I have certainty that he&#39;s going to deliver on any of these things or if other people are going to I I don&#39;t do that that&#39;s not what I do so so um the other thing that I don&#39;t do is I don&#39;t have to participate in every stock that&#39;s in the headlines as a matter of fact I&#39;ve made all my money participating in stocks that are not in the headlines and selling them when they are in the headlines so the fact that Tesla is in the headlines every day tells me I&#39;m not interested there will be a time if this thing is going to be a bargain that it will not be in the headlines at all for six months no one will be talking about it that&#39;s when you want to buy right now eh you probably get a bounce it&#39;s not it&#39;s not interesting enough for me I never bet against a guy he&#39;s a genius all right thoughts on DK wants thoughts on target uh I think we covered this last week DK uh certainly closer to a buy Point than a sell point I&#39;m not I&#39;m not ready to buy this one no change from last week I I think it&#39;s getting close to the point where you want to own it but I just don&#39;t generally like that business president Trump had immediate event with Elon Musk declared he will double US Auto production from Tesla I&#39;ve contacted CPS investor relations but they never provided a breakdown of what car models were supplying to if not at all I I&#39;ve told you on the podcast that they Supply to Tesla they just don&#39;t uh they&#39;re not allowed to use the logo in their pitch deck um and that would not be a decision that would not have any bearing on whether I invest in Cooper standard or not even even though it affirmed what you were hoping to hear it&#39;s kind of useless information Professor Tom the globalization is stopping and countries are moving towards One&#39;s best interests does this affect your thesis on Baba Baba&#39;s not an exporter so why would that affect my thesis on baba um would you hold it past 2029 Trump&#39;s second term if didn&#39;t reach intrinsic value Tesla being there was a major reason I invested in China uh I don&#39;t know how you connect those dots I apologize it was a long question apology accepted uh sharing your knowledge means a lot well thank you very much and thank you for having the courage to send in a question Jimmy Jones um I don&#39;t I still don&#39;t know what your question is oh some theory about globalization de globalization has nothing to do with my investment in Alibaba I can assure you none of my macro opinions have anything to do with how I underwrite individual companies for the next three to five years um as for whether I&#39;ll own it after Trump is in or out um my sense is this is going to move a lot faster than everyone thinks and it&#39;s going to exceed my estimates of intrinsic value sooner than I think it is and I&#39;m going to sell it at that level and it&#39;s going to go up a lot more than I thought it would and for 18 months I&#39;m going to regret selling it at a price that I thought was insane and uh and then 24 months after that I&#39;m going to be glad that I was not a pig uh and didn&#39;t get slaughtered with the rest of them I&#39;ll leave it at that uh Filipe Andrew pinkos selones yes we like it we&#39;ve said we liked it we don&#39;t own it at this time NF uh bought some Insider stocks that&#39;s from Brady Todaro I don&#39;t like this look I like Cooper St I like Comstock I don&#39;t like these other producers because I don&#39;t know enough about their assets and I&#39;m not going to spend six months to answer and ask me anything question like I did understanding range resources and com stock resources and eqt and making the decisions that I did to do range a while ago com stock more recently at $8 and change just around Jerry Jones basis um where&#39;s NF yeah this has been around for five minutes I&#39;m you&#39;re probably okay but I I just like better quality stuff and better quality management teams Cole especially in the oil patch Cole fman uh new job as an investment analyst wondering what you news you use to stay up to date I mean the basics like you say here uh for General stuff you know you get the cide research Wall Street Journal Barons Bloomberg yes get all of those that&#39;s the minimum um Financial Times you seem very knowledgeable on everything that&#39;s going on yeah I read non-stop like Buffett I mean um because I love it so yeah that those five are the starting points and then you&#39;ll as you the more you read the more you&#39;re going to learn about other things to read industry Publications depending what Holdings you have Etc thoughts on ANF amberi and Finch yeah I&#39;m look I mean I&#39;ve got enough discretionary but I&#39;m keeping my eyes open because they&#39;ve got no not yet this is a broken momentum stock not even thinking about it yet uh Edgard Constellation Energy I don&#39;t know why people are so in love with this stock see G no not yet um all right so Brady&#39;s asking we have to uh refinance all this debt this year look that&#39;s why they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing right now to bring down rates I mean part of this tariff nonsense about Fentanyl and yeah that&#39;s part of it for sure but it&#39;s also to create some volatility to get bond yields down so they can refinance as much of it as possible uh today was a little bumpy because of uh the 30-year auction so uh yeah it&#39;s a thing and the administration is on top of it and Bon told you exactly that we&#39;re going to move from very quickly from tariff rattling to growth initiatives I.E tax cuts deregulation and the Market&#39;s going to hockey stick straight up into the summer and no one&#39;s going to wonder why and it&#39;s not going to let people in and then July they&#39;re going to buy just in time for the fall weakness Greg alamari uh what&#39;s your take on ddl a Chinese grocery store answer is no okay basically if it&#39;s not one of the biggest companies in China that&#39;s been around for decades I won&#39;t touch it because half of them wind up being frauds and you say well that&#39;s pretty harsh Tom Well yeah if you&#39;ve been around markets for 20 years you&#39;ve seen all kinds of stuff happen in China so I&#39;m not willing to take country and Company even even though there are hundreds of companies that on paper in China look like the best thing I&#39;ve ever seen in my life complete wet dreams of of uh Financial balance sheet income statement I won&#39;t touch them with with a 10- foot pole um and I&#39;m sticking to that uh that&#39;s that Matt glass hour thank you for continuing to do your weekly podcast you&#39;re welcome I found you about a year ago I&#39;ve been following you baba CP yes gxo your approach has completely changed my investment Outlook and has drastically changed my portfolio for the better what are your thoughts on Estee louder well we&#39;ve covered that a lot we like it a lot and it&#39;s a play on the China recovery so uh you just have to be patient with that but I&#39;ve been talking a lot with the makeup people both at Fox and this week I talked with the ones at Yahoo apparently they destroyed the Mac brand but beyond that it&#39;s a great quality product and it&#39;s a complete play he&#39;s talking about it as a play on Russia I think you&#39;re right but it&#39;s more of a play on China which is just start stting so um that one&#39;s going to be fine in our view and as it starts to show signs of improvement that might be one we would actually buy up as it really starts to prove itself and it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not at that level yet asml one of the greatest businesses in the world from Chad Lamborn it&#39;s come down a little bit uh not for me yet I mean if this thing you know God forbid this got down to $500 I&#39;d probably this would potentially be one of the bigger positions in the portfolio but it would probably still be smaller than Intel uh best content on any media thank you that&#39;s very kind of you uh devis L what&#39;s your opinion on Wayfair not thrilled with the CEO if they changed the CEO I&#39;d probably get very interested Thomas bar found a couple gems I&#39;m curious your thought Culp and Kirk uh please only send one name per question see this one Culp is burning cash and the revenues are declining deserves to be cheap so tell me what the turnaround story is I&#39;m not interested in Kirk [Music] this one is called solvency analysis man you like companies that burn cash and decline revenues I don&#39;t sleep with companies that burn cash and decline revenues um what do they do home decor and Furnishings in the US this is a housing play it&#39;s a it&#39;s a function of rates so it&#39;s like gener and Stanley so I would never own this as a third because I already have two of those housing plays and race plays but um yeah this is like legged in plat free cash flows burning what&#39;s happening with the balance sheet $4 million of cash uh I got some how much accounts receivable do they have a lot less than their payable wait let me see something here the hell is oh scratch that liabilities here we go oh long-term debt is 34 million wait a second why are these numbers so different what was I just looking at all right so they do oh they have accounts payable of 46 million they have no accounts receivable and they have 34 million of long-term debt 3 million of cash I mean I totally see what you&#39;re seeing in terms of a trade but um let&#39;s see if they have they diluted have they raised equity no share counts this one&#39;s super risky this is like a PA punt but I think you I think it might work if it doesn&#39;t go bankrupt you&#39;re going to make a multibagger but it&#39;s definitely not looking great right now so I&#39;d have to really do dig in on their turnaround story and see some signs of improvement because the financials are just showing me uh Death By A Thousand Cuts Rob S appreciate all the consistent great knowledge you share was wondering why you prefer to buy the suppliers of Home Builders than the home builders uh we covered that um yeah so that&#39;s good I read your mind and we covered it today Goran stoit uh okay he&#39;s talking about the whole policy thing with with related to China these are all the people who missed the move up from 70 to 100 40 that are now saying yeah but but what if you&#39;re wrong what if you&#39;re wrong look we knew these risks when we got in at now a blended basis of 8 3 a lot in the hundreds a lot more in the 60s um and that&#39;s why it&#39;s not the only position in the portfolio because on a numbers basis and on what they&#39;re doing basis it would it would easily be 110% of our our net worth except you you just have to assume there&#39;s some risk of what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and if it goes to zero do you live another day but uh I think the highest most acute level of that risk during the B Biden Administration was alleviated by the pcaob decision and uh um and that&#39;s all you can do so you know it&#39;s this is a calculated Risk game and uh uh with every position I mean these are known risks with every other position there are unknown risks that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t even know and that&#39;s why you have a POS you know uh you could have a portfolio of 15 to 30 or 40 stocks but you&#39;re never going to outperform uh but you can&#39;t you know I mean maybe you could do what Buffett with what Monger talks about and have you know four or five is enough diversification but you know if you lose a you know if you lose one of those the other four better be damn good to out earn and then still be able to outperform so I I don&#39;t like that game I like I like the 8 to 12 game sometimes a little more maybe even push up to 14 15 at certain points in the market but uh uh best base case is is more concentrated and accepting the risk in in each discret underwriting and going in with my eyes wide open so uh the answer to your question is yeah I see what you see so does everyone else and uh and it&#39;s up 100% so there&#39;s that uh with that said I want to thank everyone for tuning in we&#39;re going to be back next time same time same place next week except we&#39;re going to have the most amazing guest in CEO Jeff Edwards of Cooper standard you won&#39;t believe what he&#39;s done to set this thing up for the next turn next uh uh phase of this cycle turn we&#39;ve seen the nent stages and the part is just getting started so with that said see you next week in the meantime make it a great one bye for now [Music] a [Music] [Music] a [Music]
