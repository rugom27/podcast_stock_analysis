[298.8s] proud of all the hard work that they&#39;re

[341.319s] what I did so you don&#39;t have to listen
[342.44s] to the whole hour is I splice so they do
[344.36s] a 15minute segment 45 minute segment
[347.08s] equals 60 at the end of it they
[348.479s] basically say hey Tom what do you think
[350.16s] about this and that and we go into
[352.08s] different things in promptu so listen in
[354.96s] here3 Tom Hayes is with us to help us
[357.36s] through the market on a difficult day
[359.639s] musk admitted that his time at doge is
[361.52s] making running and his businesses
[363.479s] difficult but he says he&#39;s staying at
[365.56s] Doge for at least another year what does
[368.28s] that mean for Tesla&#39;s stock well number
[370.4s] one thank God for the country that he&#39;s
[371.96s] doing that for the country to bring down
[373.68s] yields that&#39;s a that&#39;s a very good thing
[375.319s] with the cuts uh you know people talk
[377.68s] about Elon Musk like he&#39;s a solo preneur
[379.96s] working out of a Wei work office I mean
[381.639s] this guy has 10 thou you know thousands
[383.68s] of people running his businesses uh I
[385.88s] think they&#39;re going to be just fine I
[387.199s] think this is a short-term thing you
[388.72s] have you know consum sentiment is a
[390.319s] little low with the uncertainty in the
[391.759s] short term we see this every four years
[393.96s] until we have some certainty of policy
[395.68s] so I wouldn&#39;t bet against Elon Musk it&#39;s
[397.8s] a roundtrip since be the beginning of
[399.4s] the election if you own it you want to
[401.199s] bet on him the long term uh if you want
[403.479s] to buy it for the first time let&#39;s get
[405.16s] through some short-term volatility and I
[406.88s] think there&#39;s going to be an opportunity
[408.16s] the uncertainty surrounding tariffs take
[410.8s] big picture for a second that there is
[412.44s] uncertainty about the Tariff and the
[414.199s] implications thereof but that doesn&#39;t
[415.84s] bother you no you know every four years
[418.56s] if you look at the seasonal tendency in
[420.8s] February and early March is weakness and
[423.599s] it we don&#39;t need great policy we just
[425.84s] need known policy and right now we&#39;re in
[427.919s] a period of uncertainty and we&#39;re just
[429.16s] going to deal with this for another week
[430.8s] but look at earnings earnings were up
[432.599s] 18.2% for the last quarter the
[434.8s] underlying economy is strong consumer
[436.68s] sentiment a little weak because of the
[438.039s] uncertainty in the short term but if we
[440.12s] look back back towards history what we
[442.599s] see after midm March once there&#39;s some
[444.52s] certainty around policy the market tends
[446.44s] to Rally into summer so be using the red
[449.039s] days to buy we&#39;ve been buying every red
[451.199s] day since that huge flush last Tuesday
[453.36s] then we got the 500 uh Point rebound
[455.919s] then we&#39;re down we were buying yesterday
[457.72s] in the whole and we&#39;ll probably have one
[459.08s] or two more opportunities before this
[460.879s] thing kind of bottoms and and takes off
[462.52s] so you guys you&#39;re serious dip buyers oh
[464.639s] absolutely yeah and it&#39;s it&#39;s high
[466.36s] quality you know some things have been
[467.919s] overshot the number one thing about the
[469.4s] mag 7 the correction in the mag 7
[471.84s] everyone says tariffs a lot of them
[474.0s] don&#39;t aren&#39;t affected by tariff so
[475.879s] what&#39;s actually been causing it it&#39;s the
[477.599s] carry trade on wine the number one
[479.72s] people should be watching is Japanese
[482.08s] government bond yields and today they&#39;ve
[484.879s] backed off they&#39;re at 20-year highs they
[486.56s] went to 157 that is a funding currency
[489.36s] people get free currency and they invest
[491.599s] in the most crowded trade which is mag 7
[493.319s] as those yields have gone up mag 7 has
[497.12s] gone down today those yields have come
[499.319s] down and we should see some stability in
[501.599s] the NASDAQ today that&#39;s an interesting
[503.4s] interpretation of why big Tech has been
[505.199s] selling off the carry trade all right
[507.199s] Tom stay there with me for the hour
[508.56s] please there you go hey Tom um the
[512.159s] crypto firms would no longer have to
[514.32s] register with the
[515.8s] SEC what does that mean and do you
[518.08s] support it yeah this was related to
[520.08s] trading firms and they it was a bit of
[521.8s] an overreach they tried to lump it in
[523.64s] with treasury Traders treasury dealers
[526.56s] uh which is completely unrelated if they
[528.2s] had a case it should have been a
[529.959s] separate regulation that had to stand on
[531.76s] its own merits they didn&#39;t have a case
[533.56s] of the Trump Administration says no Moss
[536.16s] if you are managing outside money for
[538.44s] other people and your resp responsible
[539.76s] for other people like I do you have to
[541.519s] register with the SEC and I think that&#39;s
[543.079s] a good Safeguard so that you&#39;re
[544.839s] regulated and you&#39;re following all the
[546.12s] rules and everything is safe for the
[547.519s] client uh even if you&#39;re managing crypto
[550.519s] I think for other people that should
[552.88s] probably be under consideration if
[554.56s] you&#39;re managing it for yourself or
[555.839s] you&#39;re a trading firm and proprietary
[557.44s] Capital absolutely not I think this is a
[559.279s] good move but these changes are good for
[561.519s] cryptos I agree likely to increase that
[564.12s] price and value I think you know
[566.72s] deregulation is always a constructive
[568.88s] thing for the price of an asset and I
[570.32s] think crypto will be no different Tom
[572.079s] thank you you&#39;re going to stay with me
[573.16s] for the hour lucky I all right
[575.92s] check come back in Thomas uh you brought
[579.0s] stock books you&#39;ve gone back to the well
[580.92s] crown castle you&#39;ve liked them they have
[583.279s] gone up aren&#39;t they cell phone towers or
[585.88s] something that&#39;s right uh 40,000 cell
[588.0s] phone towers 7% dividend yield while you
[590.64s] wait for the stock appreciation and
[592.64s] they&#39;re selling off the low return fiber
[595.04s] business to over for over $8 billion to
[597.72s] Z group uh these existing 40,000 towers
[601.04s] that they&#39;re going to be left with and
[602.12s] all the cash they require very little
[603.959s] maintenance it&#39;s just a cash machine
[605.399s] that&#39;s going to pay you out dividends
[606.519s] they&#39;re going to buy back shares and
[608.32s] it&#39;s a rate play so as musk is
[610.04s] successful with Doge and yields come
[612.04s] down these type of instruments the reats
[614.2s] go up because they trade on on interest
[616.16s] rates wait a minute if I buy it now at
[617.8s] $98 a share the yield is 7% yeah just in
[621.44s] that range and and you&#39;re going to get
[623.0s] capital appreciation over the next few
[624.48s] years on top of it and your yield will
[626.24s] be locked in because you&#39;re buying low
[628.0s] and selling High that&#39;s what we like to
[630.24s] do on this show you&#39;re supposed to do
[631.64s] that Stanley Black and DEA real fast
[634.079s] what construction play again a play on
[635.92s] rates construction has been down because
[637.8s] rates have been high and new home starts
[639.519s] and confidence and all that that is
[640.88s] going to come back as rates come down
[642.32s] they&#39;ve taken $2 billion a cost out of
[644.0s] the business they Overstock during covid
[646.12s] now they&#39;re they&#39;ve destocked now
[647.519s] they&#39;re restocking uh this play is going
[649.639s] to be great that $2 billion gross
[651.639s] margins are going up from 20% to
[653.8s] 35% uh this business is going to be off
[655.88s] to the races this is a leverage play you
[657.72s] say home builders are down I want to buy
[659.0s] home Builders don&#39;t buy home build buy
[660.68s] Stanley back and Decker they&#39;re going to
[662.16s] benefit when construction back it comes
[664.16s] back in a leveraged way much more so
[666.279s] than the home builders do sounds like an
[668.079s] order to me I love it my friend take
[670.16s] that we&#39;ll take thanks Tom coming up he
[672.519s] what do you think Tom what would a win
[673.8s] against Canada look like I think even
[676.279s] tariffs I think the the administration
[678.2s] should put up a website and say Canada
[680.44s] tariffs us this this this and this line
[682.72s] item every single thing we tariff them
[685.36s] this this this and this and get those
[686.72s] numbers even that&#39;s all we want is fair
[688.76s] trade but have transparency and say
[690.92s] that&#39;s reciprocal tff is reciprocal want
[693.279s] the second yeah we&#39;re not trying to
[694.519s] start a trade War we just want a fair
[696.44s] and level trade we import about 6
[698.2s] million barrels a day from Canada that&#39;s
[700.279s] good for our refiners they refine about
[702.12s] 60% of that 4 million barrels a day it&#39;s
[704.48s] good for Canada because they have that
[705.76s] heavy thick oil uh so there are a lot of
[707.88s] good things that are happening between
[709.079s] the countries but we just need it even
[710.56s] we want our banks to be able to do
[711.72s] business in Canada just like they can do
[713.36s] business in the US uh so Donald Trump is
[715.839s] using president Trump is using these
[718.0s] tariffs as a way to make things Fair
[721.2s] make it equal trade make it equal
[723.36s] regulation let our banks do business
[725.32s] with them and this will be a positive
[727.04s] thing when all is said and done Tom
[728.44s] Hayes thank you very much for being with
[729.76s] us for the hour today we appreciate it
[731.399s] thanks see you
[733.24s] soon and we&#39;re back then the day before
[736.76s] I was on Yahoo finance want to thank
[738.88s] Brad Smith Maddie Mills Justin Oliver
[741.639s] Taylor Clothier and John Highland I will
[744.76s] be on for a full hour next month in
[749.199s] Studio I believe it&#39;s April 13th that
[752.399s] Monday it might be the 14th actually
[754.519s] April 14th Monday 10:00 a.m. for the
[756.839s] full hour uh here&#39;s the segment for this
[759.959s] week to fall after seeing their worst
[762.399s] week since September amid Moun growth
[764.6s] risks joining us now with more we&#39;ve got
[766.32s] Tom Hayes great Hill Capital chairman
[768.079s] and managing member and Tom we&#39;ve been
[770.16s] speaking about whether or not this is a
[772.36s] recession risk trade that we&#39;re seeing
[774.04s] playing out in the markets where are you
[775.88s] seeing buying opportunities are you
[778.0s] repositioning it all amid the increased
[780.279s] risks yeah I think this is a great
[782.199s] opportunity I mean sentiment is
[783.959s] basically flushed out you&#39;ve seen hedge
[785.88s] funds selling in the hole like never
[787.48s] before in the last two weeks they&#39;re
[789.24s] always a contra indicator you&#39;ve seen
[791.519s] retail investors buying more insurance
[794.04s] after the house is already half burned
[795.839s] down you want to buy the insurance
[797.36s] before the house is burned down put put
[799.6s] buying is is near a record high for
[801.519s] retail investors so we&#39;re in the normal
[804.48s] seasonal pattern of an election uh
[806.92s] postelection year which means Fe
[809.12s] February is weak early March is weak and
[811.519s] why is that it&#39;s because of policy
[813.44s] uncertainty it happens every single four
[815.32s] years and we don&#39;t need good policy we
[816.959s] just need known policy uh and once we
[819.68s] have known policy look at earnings up
[822.279s] 18.2% for the last quarter I think
[825.079s] things are actually in a good position
[827.16s] but the one thing that no one&#39;s talking
[829.76s] about that I think is more important
[831.36s] than anything else is not tariffs it&#39;s
[834.16s] actually the unwind of the carry trade
[836.6s] which fueled the most crowded TR trade
[839.36s] in the last few years which was mag 7
[841.44s] and all you need to do is look at 10year
[843.48s] yields of Japanese government bonds and
[846.639s] they&#39;ve gone from 0 to 157 that&#39;s the
[849.839s] highest rate in 20 years and that was
[852.639s] what we call a funding currency that had
[855.839s] zero cost of carry now has a cost of
[858.6s] carry so as that trade unwinds the hot
[861.279s] money is coming out of the mag 7 and
[863.279s] momentum stocks like paler like Nvidia
[865.36s] Etc yeah I was going to ask you what the
[866.68s] correlation is to the mag 7 there why
[868.56s] why that Ms when we see an unwind of the
[870.639s] the Yen carry trade and how that
[873.04s] ultimately impacts some of the inflows
[875.68s] or outflows I guess in this case for the
[877.88s] mag 7 yeah you can actually overlay the
[881.079s] PE ratio of Microsoft to Japanese
[884.639s] government bond yields and you can see
[886.92s] as Japanese government bond yields
[889.04s] increase okay the cost of that Capital
[891.519s] goes up from zero to uh a carry cost the
[895.079s] multiple of Microsoft compresses and
[898.12s] that&#39;s over long periods of time so
[900.199s] while everyone&#39;s talking about tariffs
[901.6s] look you know you could look at jgb
[903.639s] chart you could look at tariffs chart
[905.72s] tariffs chart we&#39;re near 100-year lows
[909.639s] uh in terms of tariffs and what most
[911.88s] people forget as you hear Holly Smoot
[914.12s] every single day on TV is that they
[916.759s] raised tariffs from 1918 to 1929 for 11
[920.959s] consecutive years to levels much higher
[923.199s] than anything we&#39;re close to right now
[924.92s] and the economy boomed before Holly
[927.759s] Smoot when that was of the straw that
[929.68s] broke the camels back uh and coincident
[932.16s] with a a big selloff that we all know
[934.04s] about but uh I think there&#39;s a lot of
[936.079s] runway in terms of tariffs I&#39;m not pro
[938.279s] tariffs but I&#39;d be less concerned with
[940.56s] that I&#39;d be watching that funding
[942.04s] currency as it relates to the crowded
[943.759s] trades of the mag s and be looking
[946.04s] outside of the mag 7 for opportunities
[948.04s] in the US uh and be looking aggressively
[951.0s] in international opportunities you know
[952.759s] I guess we&#39;re all talking about tariffs
[954.56s] though because it&#39;s what all of the
[956.36s] companies are talking about right now
[957.839s] too the facts that
[959.56s] most recently saying the highest number
[961.079s] of S&amp;P 500 companies citing tariffs on
[963.079s] earnings calls over the past 10 years
[965.6s] here so this this even moves through the
[967.48s] last time in Trump 1.0 that we were
[970.199s] thinking and talking about and seeing
[971.639s] the implementation of tariffs and so how
[973.839s] are companies how are you hearing and
[975.279s] assessing companies who are trying to
[977.04s] bake this into their own forecasts for
[978.72s] the rest of the year yeah I mean welcome
[980.6s] to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 as a
[982.72s] matter of fact I saw some analoges and
[984.44s] overlays you could see the stock market
[987.079s] uh in Trump 1.0 when the tarff uh talks
[990.0s] were escalating in in accordance with
[991.639s] the graph you&#39;re you&#39;re uh talking about
[993.959s] and we&#39;re effectively in the trough
[996.12s] right now we&#39;re going to get certainty
[997.24s] we&#39;re going to know by a lot can happen
[998.8s] between now and April 2nd uh he didn&#39;t
[1001.6s] want to do it on April Fool&#39;s Day maybe
[1003.56s] maybe he should have because I don&#39;t
[1005.12s] think they&#39;re going to look exactly like
[1006.44s] they look right now on April 2nd I do
[1008.759s] think uh the other thing that people are
[1010.72s] not really accounting for aggressively
[1013.48s] is if it is a worst case scenario what
[1015.8s] it brings back on the table which had
[1018.279s] been off the table the last 8 weeks is
[1020.079s] the fed put comes back into play we&#39;ve
[1022.959s] seen the odds of a Fed cut go up to over
[1026.24s] 85% in June just a month ago everyone
[1029.12s] said no Cuts in 2025 so here we are we&#39;
[1031.839s] got the Trump put effectively coming
[1033.88s] back in potentially but the fed put
[1036.079s] coming back in and oh by the way what&#39;s
[1038.4s] happened in the background no one&#39;s
[1039.64s] paying attention to bessent and Trump
[1041.64s] have delivered on what they said they
[1043.12s] would do which everyone was laughing at
[1044.919s] when the 10-year yield was at 480 it&#39;s
[1047.4s] now down 60 some on basis points that&#39;s
[1050.0s] going to help refinance debt that&#39;s
[1051.799s] going to help stoke the housing market
[1054.32s] again as 10year yields uh go lower and
[1058.16s] uh and no one&#39;s really positioned for
[1059.52s] that home builders you can&#39;t give away
[1061.16s] right now home building supply companies
[1063.2s] you can&#39;t give away right now and I
[1064.919s] think there&#39;s going to be great
[1065.76s] opportunity there with lower and lower
[1067.24s] rates you&#39;re seeing it on the 30-year
[1068.559s] mortgage tied to the tenure all right
[1071.559s] Thomas Thanks so much for taking the
[1072.76s] time here with us today we got about 20
[1074.4s] minutes until the opening bell here
[1076.12s] we&#39;ll leave the conversation right there
[1077.2s] appreciate thanks for having me and
[1079.559s] we&#39;re back and then I got a chance to
[1083.84s] join uh here we go want to uh JD Durkin
[1088.679s] want to thank Mill Montanas and Christen
[1090.88s] Scher for having me on nysse live and
[1095.0s] welcome back to the show this is NYSC TV
[1097.0s] live I am JD derkin in studio here at
[1099.12s] the New York Stock Exchange and joining
[1100.72s] me now is Thomas Hayes Thomas&#39;s chair
[1102.84s] and managing member at Great Hill
[1104.52s] Capital Thomas welcome back great to
[1105.96s] have you here as always thanks for
[1107.12s] having me JD uh let&#39;s start with your
[1108.44s] takeway ways a Topline and core CPI
[1111.08s] reading both a bit cooler than expected
[1112.96s] maybe helping to set the stage for
[1114.559s] investors today we&#39;re in positive
[1116.08s] territory not by very much but what&#39; you
[1117.919s] make of the numbers I think it&#39;s a big
[1119.52s] deal because as of yesterday you saw the
[1122.48s] odds of a Fed cut in June go up over 90%
[1126.84s] with inflation coming down this gives
[1128.6s] the fed the opportunity to be back in
[1130.4s] the picture and if you remember just a
[1132.0s] few weeks ago people were saying no Cuts
[1134.159s] in 2025 but what they were missing was
[1136.64s] the fact that seasonally January
[1138.88s] February inflation numbers are hot it&#39;s
[1140.6s] a seasonal Factor we&#39;re now coming off
[1142.44s] the boil inflation&#39;s coming down it
[1144.559s] brings the FED back into play um what is
[1146.919s] something about the overall markets you
[1148.36s] wish people were paying a little bit
[1149.88s] more attention to or maybe something
[1151.52s] we&#39;re not discussing discussing quite
[1153.559s] enough uh I think number one the big
[1156.679s] correction in mag 7 was not attributable
[1159.36s] to tariffs because most are unaffected
[1160.96s] by tariffs it was actually the carry
[1162.919s] trade unwind if you saw the 10-year jgb
[1166.12s] yield shot up from effectively 0 to 157
[1169.6s] in a very short period of time when
[1171.559s] you&#39;re borrowing the funding currency
[1173.24s] and it has no cost that&#39;s good you can
[1174.919s] crowd into mag 7 when the that cost
[1177.36s] starts to go up as we saw in recent
[1179.2s] weeks uh people have to unwind that
[1181.4s] leverage because there&#39;s a cost of carry
[1183.159s] so what have you seen in the last two
[1184.799s] days those 10year jgb yields have backed
[1187.88s] up off the boil from 157 back down to
[1190.2s] 150 150 range the markets are steady
[1193.0s] things are calm mag 7 ready for a big
[1195.76s] technical bounce here but I I don&#39;t
[1197.48s] think the theme for 2025 has changed
[1200.08s] which is mag 7 underperform they&#39;ll do
[1203.24s] fine okay maybe trade in a Range maybe
[1205.28s] back to the top of this range so we&#39;ll
[1206.84s] get a good technical bounce here but
[1208.84s] real huge opportunity
[1210.96s] unmagnify those boring companies and
[1213.84s] international which we&#39;ve already seen
[1215.32s] take off like a rocket this year what
[1216.6s] are your expectations for PPI inflation
[1218.84s] data out tomorrow and what does the FED
[1220.679s] do with both this CPI print and
[1222.48s] tomorrow&#39;s print into next week&#39;s
[1223.88s] meeting yeah you know PPI tends to be
[1226.039s] the leading indicator they&#39;ve been a
[1227.48s] little better than CPI even in the
[1229.159s] seasonally strong period so I would
[1230.6s] expect it to be subdued like we saw
[1232.88s] today that&#39;s a very constructive thing
[1234.919s] that can bring the FED back into play if
[1236.88s] we have further volatility they can
[1238.52s] start saying like we stand ready to act
[1241.08s] uh right now we&#39;re going to wait be
[1242.4s] dated to pendent as they always say
[1244.0s] whereas before they&#39;re kind of like
[1245.84s] effectively alluding to the fact that
[1247.4s] they were done and kind of calm and
[1249.76s] patient now that they can say well we&#39;re
[1251.84s] paying attention we can be in play and
[1253.96s] that&#39;s what the FED funds Futures are
[1255.36s] reflecting I got about a minute let me
[1256.88s] ask you about a few of these names I
[1258.08s] know you covered closely uh let&#39;s start
[1259.96s] with Alibaba up over 60% for the most
[1262.48s] part knocking the cover off the ball
[1264.36s] recently unveiling a new AI model what
[1266.24s] do you track in there uh this is an
[1267.76s] absolute home run we&#39;ve been building
[1268.96s] this position for two years okay so we
[1270.88s] bought started buying in the hundreds we
[1272.279s] backed up the truck in the 60s it&#39;s
[1274.64s] basis 83 it&#39;s absolutely taken off it is
[1277.559s] just getting started do you buy it up
[1279.36s] after 60% wait for a pullback you might
[1281.32s] get a little bit of weakness to buy it
[1283.039s] but as far as some of the parts
[1284.52s] intrinsic value we&#39;re just getting
[1286.08s] started this is going to be a multi-year
[1288.12s] theme their stimulus is kicking in
[1290.279s] they&#39;ve they&#39;ve basically done a 180 on
[1292.44s] their policy and Alibaba is best
[1294.679s] position as an AI play in China let&#39;s
[1296.64s] close with the PayPal struggling a bit
[1298.6s] not quite down to its 52- we lows but it
[1300.76s] is trading below the 200 day moving
[1302.48s] average what do you see with PayPal bet
[1303.96s] on the jockey Alex Chris is a winner he
[1305.919s] came from into it he ran 50% of revenues
[1308.08s] that thing was a multibagger he&#39;s
[1309.88s] applying the same principles to this
[1311.4s] business he&#39;s going to generate 7 to 8
[1313.08s] billion of free cash flow they&#39;re buying
[1314.52s] in 15% of the company it&#39;s a cash
[1317.52s] machine margins are going back up it&#39;s a
[1319.84s] neglected business this is a winner it&#39;s
[1321.72s] going a lot higher from here over the
[1323.6s] next 12 to 24 months in our opinion
[1325.64s] Thomas I know it&#39;s always a killer
[1326.799s] interview when I sit there and say I
[1328.039s] could do this like for at least another
[1329.96s] hour unfortunately we got to leave it
[1331.279s] there it&#39;s always great to talk with you
[1332.84s] that&#39;s Thomas Hayes a chair and managing
[1334.4s] member over at Great Hill Capital thanks
[1336.12s] a lot for being here thanks for having
[1337.279s] me J folks the markets are in positive
[1339.0s] territory at least sea back and forth
[1340.799s] for the D and we&#39;re back and last but
[1343.44s] certainly not least I love this
[1345.039s] interview with Diane King hall right
[1347.52s] from the floor of of the New York Stock
[1350.4s] Exchange um went through a lot of great
[1353.0s] stuff and and uh Diane remembers me
[1355.4s] because she was on Yahoo when I was
[1357.08s] pitching Baba under a hundred bucks and
[1360.2s] uh j under a hundred bucks and PayPal in
[1363.76s] the 50s and she&#39;s like boy you are
[1366.039s] contrarian all those things are working
[1367.44s] out so we gave her a couple more and
[1369.4s] you&#39;re GNA love this one and Tom hay
[1372.48s] chairman and managing member great Hill
[1375.12s] Capital we put your full Thomas Hayes I
[1377.88s] always call you Tom I prer Tom that&#39;s
[1380.32s] great Diane good to see you it&#39;s good to
[1381.88s] see you I always love chatting with you
[1384.159s] all right let&#39;s talk about kind of the
[1385.52s] broad Market weakness we&#39;ve seen first I
[1387.96s] know I&#39;ve got some notes from you I want
[1389.88s] to get into max EV but I want to
[1392.08s] initially start where we are with this
[1394.4s] uh reaction to tariffs tariffs were a
[1396.559s] Hallmark of the first Trump
[1397.84s] Administration it seems like it&#39;s going
[1399.24s] to be a Hallmark of trump 2.0 as well um
[1403.559s] what is generally what is your takeaway
[1406.679s] from the first admin ministration with
[1409.88s] uh regard to tariffs and how to operate
[1412.2s] in the volatility that we see now yeah
[1414.96s] you you can&#39;t make investment decisions
[1417.64s] on things that are outside of your
[1419.24s] control so I always like to say welcome
[1421.24s] to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 new
[1424.72s] headline new tweet new volatility but
[1427.12s] resolves higher over time and the thing
[1429.88s] we also have to keep in mind about these
[1431.24s] tariffs is is what is implemented is a
[1435.36s] onetime level up it&#39;s not 25% %
[1438.88s] compounded at 10% per year it&#39;s 25% one
[1441.799s] time uh and that creates an environment
[1444.48s] where what we see every four years in a
[1447.44s] post uh election year is February and
[1452.08s] March are extremely weak why are they
[1454.44s] always extremely weak every four years
[1456.12s] because it&#39;s policy uncertainty we don&#39;t
[1458.12s] even need good policy Diane all we need
[1460.48s] is known policy and right now we don&#39;t
[1463.2s] know that I think we&#39;re getting some
[1465.64s] firmness on that and I think the
[1467.08s] Market&#39;s ready to uh start to have a
[1469.399s] technical bounce here okay all right
[1471.279s] speaking of a technical bounce I wonder
[1473.799s] what your thoughts are on the magx
[1475.24s] having they really underperformed this
[1477.399s] year as a group you know whether we&#39;re
[1479.2s] looking at Nvidia it&#39;s majorly down this
[1482.24s] year um uh Microsoft alphabet Google uh
[1487.36s] you name it apple as well only one that
[1491.0s] has a gain so far this year that I&#39;ve
[1492.84s] noticed I may be missing one meta uh
[1495.72s] what is your expectation are you
[1497.24s] expecting to see some kind of technical
[1499.76s] shift here some would call them oversold
[1502.32s] what&#39;s your thought yeah I do think
[1504.08s] we&#39;re going to see a technical bounce uh
[1506.12s] it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting off their 52e
[1508.52s] highs or recent highs they&#39;re all down
[1510.559s] over 20% or around 20% with the
[1512.919s] exception of Apple was down like 12 and
[1514.76s] 1 half 133% um our theme coming in as
[1518.6s] you may remember was under performance
[1521.12s] of the mag 7 they they had and it&#39;s
[1524.12s] fundamentally driven it&#39;s not just
[1526.08s] technically driven in that their
[1527.84s] earnings are are decelerating from 33%
[1529.84s] last year to 16% this year so they&#39;re
[1532.159s] reating in terms of price so we&#39;re going
[1534.0s] to get a technical bounce but I do think
[1535.52s] they&#39;re going to be a bit range bound
[1537.2s] maybe back up to the top of the range
[1539.159s] for this year underperform real
[1541.08s] opportunities are going to be under the
[1542.559s] surface mag mag UNM magnificent
[1545.559s] 493 uh uh and international my goodness
[1549.48s] the spread between International and
[1550.88s] domestic&#39;s been fantastic I think that
[1552.679s] theme&#39;s going to reoccur like we see
[1554.919s] every 10 to 15 years we&#39;ve been 15 14 15
[1557.64s] years us performance it&#39;s time to shift
[1559.96s] back to some International so we have
[1562.559s] seen some International perform better
[1566.12s] for instance in China um is the theme of
[1570.48s] us exceptionalism over just for this
[1573.84s] year uh well when they shift they tend
[1577.12s] to be for many years as a matter of fact
[1579.919s] Reagan&#39;s second Administration uh
[1582.88s] interesting parallel uh International
[1585.159s] dramatically outperformed us did fine
[1587.32s] but International dramatically
[1588.72s] outperformed I mean the spread between
[1590.76s] the tremendous 10 Tech in China and the
[1593.96s] mag 7 is 55% this year year-to date
[1598.2s] China Tech up 45% mag 7 was actually
[1601.679s] it&#39;s more now mag 7 was down 15% so
[1604.039s] that&#39;s spreads about
[1605.6s] 60% and I know this because we&#39;ve been
[1608.44s] building aaba position for two years
[1610.159s] that did nothing and all of a sudden it
[1612.039s] went up overnight and everyone&#39;s like
[1613.88s] you&#39;re a genius well it took us two
[1615.72s] years to build a position we were buing
[1617.64s] the hundred we&#39;re backing up the truck
[1619.279s] in the&#39; 60s and here we are so I think
[1621.6s] it persists speaking of uh stock picks I
[1624.919s] do want to get through some of yours you
[1626.72s] got a few um you&#39;ve got uh Baxter
[1630.08s] International you&#39;ve got Stanley uh uh
[1633.84s] and you&#39;ve got Boeing as well where do
[1635.48s] you want to start let&#39;s start with
[1636.679s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker because that&#39;s
[1638.0s] the most hated we&#39;re a contrarian as you
[1640.279s] know for for a long time uh Stanley
[1642.32s] Black and&amp; Decker is a construction play
[1643.96s] so they&#39;re going to say uh let&#39;s buy
[1645.96s] home builders home builders are down a
[1647.44s] lot stanle black and&amp; Decker will
[1649.48s] benefit from lower rates because
[1651.0s] construction has stopped consumer
[1652.24s] sentiment with the policy uncertainty
[1654.159s] housing starts have stopped that&#39;s all
[1655.52s] going to come back we&#39;re seeing the
[1656.559s] 10-year yield come down we&#39;re seeing
[1658.159s] that as an initiative of Treasury
[1660.159s] secretary bessent and Trump Scott Bess
[1662.559s] mortgages are priced off the 10e yield
[1664.64s] you see a high five handle on the
[1667.12s] 30-year mortgage uh which which will be
[1670.08s] fostered by you say we will see we will
[1672.24s] see when this year I think but before
[1674.32s] the end of the year you&#39;re going to see
[1675.44s] 599 something like that on the 30-year
[1677.24s] mortgage and housing is going to go
[1679.0s] crazy again meaning construction meaning
[1681.88s] Stanley Black and deckor they&#39;ve taken
[1683.559s] look they overstocked during Co because
[1685.279s] they didn&#39;t think they could get parts
[1686.679s] they&#39;ve destocked now they&#39;re restocking
[1688.2s] they&#39;ve taken $2 billion of costs out of
[1690.32s] the business that&#39;s $11 a share and
[1692.6s] their gross margins which troughed at
[1694.519s] 20% are now reaccelerating at 35% so
[1697.96s] this thing is going to earn money last
[1699.44s] time they had these kind of gross
[1700.519s] margins it was $150 stock it&#39;s trading
[1702.44s] in the 80s okay we have a little over a
[1704.76s] minute left I hate doing this okay
[1707.64s] backer
[1709.2s] well I really like Boeing because I know
[1711.0s] you just let&#39;s do Boe all right so Boe I
[1713.519s] mean when I say I really like it because
[1715.559s] it&#39;s somewhat of a contrarian pick you
[1717.44s] wonder if it&#39;s hit a bottom now
[1718.84s] basically yeah I I think we&#39;re there uh
[1720.76s] we we probably hit the bottom at 138
[1722.519s] then we rallied to 180 now we&#39;re back
[1724.24s] into the 150s this is a great final
[1726.919s] opportunity to get into Boeing why
[1729.399s] because look love Boeing or hate Boeing
[1731.24s] they made a lot of mistakes in the last
[1732.6s] few years they&#39;ve got Kelly ortberg he

[1796.12s] candidly most of our names are doing
[1798.799s] just fine the ones that are affected by
[1800.799s] tariffs have just basically been
[1802.72s] grinding sideways some are a little bit
[1805.039s] down the ones that have gotten smacked
[1806.799s] we&#39;re not in the mag seven are the ones
[1808.64s] that are getting all the pain and they
[1809.84s] don&#39;t get affected by tariffs so why are
[1813.44s] they going down when the the the media
[1817.44s] keeps telling you it&#39;s all about Trump
[1819.159s] tariffs and the stocks that are going

[1888.399s] accelerating their AI growth has hit
[1890.44s] Triple digit growth for the last 6
[1891.96s] quarters in a row uh this is a name that
[1894.0s] is increasingly becoming less contrarian
[1896.48s] and more common place got to give credit
[1898.32s] to Tom Hayes a good friend and fellow
[1900.0s] analyst for for putting me on to this
[1901.639s] one too uh dug into the fundamentals and
[1903.679s] this is it one in this Market at 14
[1905.24s] times earnings I&#39;m backing up the truck
[1906.639s] and buying some all right Luke thank you

[1908.76s] much join his newsletter check out his
[1911.679s] show uh super guy he&#39;s working as an
[1914.76s] executive with a oil and gas rollup down
[1918.24s] in Houston I believe uh and on Varney
[1921.36s] and all the shows on Fox Business every
[1923.559s] single week you know him well all right
[1926.039s] let&#39;s talk about
[1927.84s] markets
[1929.72s] um first and
[1933.039s] foremost I the theme that I want to get
[1935.519s] across which bessent did a decent job of
[1937.799s] explaining this morning is everyone is
[1940.72s] stuck in this tar thing and uncertainty
[1943.76s] and this really does happen every just
[1945.72s] like we said on the things every single
[1948.279s] uh new presidential cycle the year after
[1951.279s] uh February and uh through mid-march
[1955.12s] tends to be very bumpy very weak and if
[1957.08s] you remember last month when the market
[1958.72s] was up huge in early February I went on
[1961.12s] TV several times and we played it on
[1963.32s] this podcast and I said the famous
[1966.36s] buckle up buttercup and get your
[1968.12s] shopping list ready because we&#39;re going
[1969.44s] to hit some air pockets and that&#39;s
[1971.24s] exactly what we&#39;re seeing now that&#39;s the
[1973.6s] bad news the good news is not only do
[1975.76s] you see weakness in February through
[1978.2s] mid-march because of policy uncertainty
[1980.559s] every single time uh you see a monster
[1983.24s] rally from March through the summer uh
[1986.559s] once you get a little bit of clarity on
[1989.08s] what policy is going to be and what is
[1990.84s] that change going to be in our view is
[1993.96s] very simple we&#39;re going to move from
[1995.799s] this tit fortat fighting punching it out
[1998.679s] on tariffs which is ultimately going to
[2000.639s] lead to we expect lower tariffs on both
[2006.279s] sides because we&#39;ll say okay you&#39;re
[2008.639s] charging us 50% on our cars we&#39;re going
[2010.679s] to charge you 50% on your cars and
[2013.159s] they&#39;re going to say well we don&#39;t want
[2014.799s] 50% on our cars we say no problem how
[2017.6s] about we do 25 and you do 25 they say uh
[2022.0s] no we don&#39;t we want to charge you more
[2024.399s] well that&#39;s not the way it&#39;s going to
[2025.76s] work we either do even even or uh we&#39;ll
[2028.6s] do more than you your choice because we
[2030.919s] have the market that you need to stay in
[2033.44s] business and they&#39;ll say well can you do
[2037.24s] any better sure we how about we do zero
[2040.08s] and you do zero would that make sense to
[2042.279s] you oh no we want we want to tariff you
[2045.0s] well okay then we want to tariff you oh
[2047.2s] okay let&#39;s do zero and zero and then you
[2049.399s] get real free trade happening am I
[2051.0s] saying that&#39;s going to happen on every
[2052.2s] line item no am I saying that we&#39;re
[2054.24s] going to move in that direction because
[2055.639s] we do hold the cards in this yes and are
[2057.96s] we willing to take a little short-term
[2059.56s] volatility for long-term reward you bet
[2062.079s] you and uh and that&#39;s what&#39;s pretty darn
[2064.679s] exciting I can&#39;t tell you the number of
[2066.359s] journalists who called me this week to
[2068.2s] talk about Trump tariffs as it why is
[2070.32s] mag 7 they they kept saying mag all the
[2073.04s] tech stocks are down when is this tariff
[2075.48s] thing going I said what does this have
[2076.839s] to do with tariffs like does Google
[2080.28s] export uh uh search to Mexico or do do
[2085.079s] do they get their
[2086.359s] search product from Mexico and Canada I
[2089.52s] mean this is just you can&#39;t make this
[2091.079s] stuff up so anyway it&#39;s it&#39;s absolutely
[2095.2s] crazy how emotional people get and you
[2097.92s] just zoom out as we say here on hedge
[2100.04s] fund tips with Tom Hayes every week and
[2102.0s] actually burden yourself with the facts
[2104.16s] hold on I&#39;m going to go get my buddy&#39;s
[2107.48s] hat here we
[2110.44s] go by the way I got to figure out what
[2113.92s] we&#39;re going to do with these hats
[2116.0s] obviously this my buddy and friend and
[2119.079s] client Damian L burden yourself with the
[2123.079s] facts great Hill Capital we got like 10
[2125.76s] of these I got to do some type of
[2127.24s] promotion with these
[2130.96s] um but we&#39;ll figure that out um here
[2135.4s] let&#39;s all right so let&#39;s just uh
[2136.64s] dispassionately take a look at the
[2137.8s] markets briefly we&#39;ve talked about
[2139.56s] everything we needed to talk about on
[2141.079s] the markets with the four interviews and
[2143.68s] three days so here is the put call ratio
[2146.88s] it&#39;s elevated it&#39;s not at an extreme but
[2150.96s] it does look
[2153.72s] like kind of a downtrend maybe it goes
[2156.16s] up a little higher after this week
[2158.72s] and we&#39;ll be up here and we could say
[2160.76s] all right if it&#39;s not going to be a huge
[2162.48s] type of thing we&#39;ll be fine I got to be
[2165.76s] honest with you I mean I&#39;m even looking
[2167.319s] at today which closed pretty weak and
[2172.319s] our aggregate portfolios are up today
[2174.64s] I&#39;m not saying that
[2176.359s] like it doesn&#39;t matter the point is is
[2180.88s] that because we are truly active
[2183.8s] managers the type of positions we take
[2186.319s] are uncorrelated where you see a lot of
[2188.359s] ACC
[2189.8s] ACC active managers that are closet
[2192.839s] indexers they&#39;re basically copying an
[2195.319s] index fund uh and then just moving the
[2198.839s] needle in terms of weights at the
[2200.28s] margins to hug The Benchmark get their
[2202.48s] fees have the pension Consultants check
[2204.68s] off because they don&#39;t you know
[2206.839s] outperform or underperform so everyone
[2209.079s] gets their jobs everyone gets their fees
[2211.079s] we do the exact opposite like if you
[2213.359s] look if you compare our Holdings for
[2215.2s] clients relative to any index there&#39;s
[2217.2s] going to be absolutely no Rhyme or
[2218.52s] Reason we run it like private equity in
[2221.24s] the public markets we underwrite each
[2223.319s] position as if we&#39;re buying the entire
[2225.839s] company and then we just try to buy
[2227.68s] companies in different Industries so we
[2229.48s] have discret uncorrelated Bets with huge
[2233.079s] margins of safeties that we can get a
[2235.24s] minimum double triple in a reasonable
[2236.92s] amount of time to three years and we
[2238.96s] rinse and repeat over and over and over
[2241.0s] and we do the turnaround Tom special
[2243.119s] durable proven businesses over and over
[2245.119s] and over so um speaking of which in two
[2249.72s] weeks time uh April 1 we will open up
[2254.88s] for Q2 opening for the small accounts uh
[2259.359s] those of you been around know our
[2260.839s] minimum used to be 5 million and they
[2262.839s] could come in whenever they wanted and
[2265.28s] uh that&#39;s been great and th for those
[2267.24s] accounts that have a better deal by the
[2269.2s] way uh they can come in anytime they
[2271.599s] want they get bespoke service for the
[2273.28s] smaller accounts which we opened up uh
[2275.92s] over a year ago and has been very very
[2277.92s] successful uh we open up once a quarter
[2280.64s] so we can manage that all in a week or
[2282.44s] two and then just get back to investing
[2284.72s] so those of you who are going to be
[2287.56s] coming in in April and I would imagine
[2291.52s] if you&#39;ve been listening to this podcast
[2293.0s] for a while you want to come in when a
[2295.0s] lot of these opportunities are available
[2296.92s] versus when everything&#39;s up uh just go
[2301.24s] to hedge fund
[2303.44s] tips.com and click on money management
[2305.76s] enter your information there and make
[2306.96s] sure you qualify and then we can start
[2308.96s] to get back to you in the next week or
[2310.88s] two and you&#39;ll be first in Q when that
[2313.16s] opens in April and you can have your
[2315.839s] application set up and we can take it
[2318.079s] from there
[2319.92s] so um let&#39;s take a look at where we are
[2322.4s] in the extremes here on a chart by chart
[2325.64s] basis just to separate emotion from
[2328.359s] reality you can see most of these indic
[2331.28s] most of these indicators that we look at
[2333.599s] from time to time are extreme and coming
[2336.64s] back or close to extreme and coming back
[2339.88s] NASDAQ declining issues tricks uh NASDAQ
[2343.68s] Coen high low this is pretty extreme
[2346.2s] here could it get more extreme if it was
[2348.48s] a one you know a big event sure you know
[2351.48s] we&#39;re right at correction territory on
[2353.2s] the S&amp;P largely driven by mag 7 all of
[2357.119s] the mag 7 uh I I think excluding
[2361.0s] Apple uh are down 20% or
[2364.24s] more um uh and it&#39;s interesting because
[2368.16s] if you recall those of youve been
[2370.0s] listening we bought uh Amazon and Google
[2373.2s] in the hole in um October November 2022
[2378.48s] during the tech crash and they were
[2380.359s] pretty quick uh basically doubles and we
[2383.56s] sold out of those and we sold out of all
[2386.16s] that stuff and the banks in
[2388.76s] July um and they actually went up more
[2393.04s] after we sold and we&#39;re just like okay
[2394.8s] whatever they just got rich we made our
[2396.28s] money on those uh and now they&#39;re back
[2398.4s] well below that uh and it just goes to
[2400.76s] show you things overshoot on the upside
[2402.56s] they overshoot on the downside we take
[2405.16s] the middle out and we&#39;re super excited
[2407.16s] about that um some of these are getting
[2409.839s] ready for a big technical bounce but as
[2411.839s] I said in the interviews I believe
[2413.92s] they&#39;re going to be trading in a range
[2415.68s] and underperforming for the remainder of
[2417.599s] the Year our theme of international
[2420.2s] maybe that&#39;ll come off the boil because
[2421.599s] it&#39;s had such a big move in such a short
[2423.2s] period of time will persist though
[2425.48s] through end of the year and Beyond so
[2427.96s] that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to continue to
[2429.76s] focus um but you can see a lot of these
[2432.52s] sectors are getting completely oversold
[2435.16s] uh materials there&#39;s so much to do in
[2437.8s] materials so many new names that we&#39;re
[2440.64s] researching and ready to allocate to in
[2443.28s] addition to our existing one um healthc
[2446.72s] care kind of
[2449.0s] mid-range uh intermediate term volume
[2451.48s] momentum so like often this was a bounce
[2454.4s] area sometimes it gets to a more extreme
[2456.88s] we&#39;ll see if that&#39;s the case this
[2459.04s] time uh but you know Dow is getting
[2462.52s] close to buy all SNP pmo by SPX is kind
[2467.8s] of at the level you usually get bounces
[2469.359s] could get a little bit more extreme
[2470.72s] maybe we flush Monday and then turn
[2472.56s] around Tuesday we&#39;ll see um uh bullish
[2477.52s] percent S&amp;P 500 this is an area where
[2480.28s] you tend to get some bounces unless it&#39;s
[2482.48s] an extreme
[2483.76s] one uh but I like the risk reward here
[2486.119s] and I like it on a discreet BAS as I go
[2487.92s] through a lot of the names that we
[2489.44s] talked about and other names that we own
[2491.119s] for our clients that we haven&#39;t talked
[2492.64s] about I just love where they all are and
[2494.4s] some are going well against the train uh
[2497.8s] well Against the Grain while everything
[2499.2s] else is going down they&#39;re going up
[2500.52s] you&#39;ve seen it obviously in Baba you now
[2502.319s] see it in Intel which we&#39;re going to
[2503.72s] talk about
[2504.88s] today um and uh and several others and
[2508.04s] and we think that&#39;s going to continue
[2509.2s] and then a lot of them are just sitting
[2510.72s] there like Advanced Auto Parts like um
[2514.96s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker just sitting
[2516.319s] and waiting so while the Market&#39;s
[2517.48s] crashing around them they&#39;re kind of
[2518.56s] just in this holding pattern and I think
[2521.24s] usually what you see in crashes is a new
[2524.16s] leadership group comes out and I do
[2526.16s] think as the rates come down we&#39;re going
[2528.0s] to see a lot of these just Skyrocket
[2529.68s] even including gener uh and others
[2532.359s] here&#39;s the melen
[2534.92s] oscillator uh that was the NASDAQ one
[2538.119s] here&#39;s the niky one uh so again you get
[2541.4s] these flushes and you get the you know
[2543.88s] kind of check backs and then straight up
[2546.04s] so I I think we&#39;re mostly there on a
[2548.4s] company by compan basis this might have
[2550.4s] to work itself a little bit through but
[2553.2s] uh here&#39;s the uh uh volatility index uh
[2557.52s] spiked up you know it&#39;s it&#39;s way too
[2560.839s] late to buy insurance uh for all the
[2563.68s] people we have record Put buying this
[2565.92s] week we have record selling in the hole
[2568.559s] that&#39;s the kind of stuff I like to see
[2570.68s] and we&#39;re in the market on red days
[2572.2s] buying stocks and that&#39;s the name of the
[2573.88s] game so uh moving along here
[2579.76s] we got a double of these there we go
[2583.16s] quote of the week if you want to have
[2584.64s] better performance than the crowd you
[2586.28s] must do things differently than the
[2587.92s] crowd not be a closet indexer not chase
[2590.559s] the shiny objects that we warned about
[2592.839s] and we covered last week how badly all
[2595.079s] of them have been hit I mean it&#39;s just
[2597.16s] staggering you know it&#39;s funny because
[2600.04s] you know people know I&#39;m in the markets
[2601.24s] are like how you doing I&#39;m like pretty
[2603.359s] well how are you they&#39;re like oh man
[2605.44s] it&#39;s so bad I&#39;m like what what do you
[2606.88s] mean
[2608.079s] they&#39;re like all my tech stocks are down
[2609.88s] like it seems like you know in talking
[2612.599s] with the average bear even the average
[2614.64s] money manager they are so concentrated
[2617.559s] in all this stuff that got shellacked so
[2619.8s] while the indices are down single digits
[2622.359s] I mean some of these guys are down like
[2625.16s] 30 40% because they had all that stuff
[2628.04s] and they had it with leverage and uh you
[2630.839s] know you just got to
[2632.319s] know when the crowd is getting swept up
[2635.04s] and step aside and and lose the fomo
[2637.8s] gene that leads people to these
[2640.4s] outcomes uh some of this volatility you
[2643.319s] saw Millennium uh huge hedge fund kind
[2646.48s] of blowing up they had a um a note on
[2650.119s] Bloomberg one of the strategies was like
[2652.76s] completely for selling last Friday uh b
[2656.44s] gford a growth fund they&#39;re getting
[2658.359s] smoked so uh think differently than the
[2662.04s] crowd is the name of the game and here&#39;s
[2663.48s] the master Warren Buffett himself the
[2665.079s] most important quality for an investor
[2666.599s] is not intellect you need a temperament
[2669.359s] that neither derives great pleasure from
[2671.119s] being with the crowd or against the
[2672.92s] crowd and I&#39;m noticing a lot of the
[2675.319s] smart you know some of my smartest
[2677.72s] clients I have been calling me this week
[2680.44s] uh basically saying are we allowed to
[2682.04s] put money in you know in the middle of
[2683.8s] the quarter I&#39;m like yeah you&#39;re already
[2685.0s] an existing client you can put money in
[2686.64s] whenever you want just give me a heads
[2687.96s] up so I know there&#39;s cash there to uh to
[2690.44s] deploy right away um and
[2695.119s] uh you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh anyway I love
[2698.839s] environments like this this is like this
[2700.48s] is this is my favorite time in the
[2703.04s] business is to be around during periods
[2704.76s] like this uh especially when we saw it
[2706.96s] coming and and we were talking to you
[2708.359s] guys so uh so you all buckled up
[2709.96s] buttercup I know you didn&#39;t own any mag
[2712.0s] 7 and uh and here we go so uh here is
[2715.839s] what I&#39;m watching though for this
[2717.359s] whether or not this turns into something
[2718.92s] more serious is the high yield option
[2721.8s] adjusted spread basically high yield
[2724.119s] credit spreads uh this is very very very
[2727.559s] subdued very open up I think we&#39;ve got a
[2729.76s] few more years I think this is going to
[2731.16s] look a lot like 2001 to 2007 which we
[2735.48s] we&#39;ve talked about um and we&#39;re kind of
[2740.16s] here we could see these spreads blow out
[2741.96s] a little bit if it gets crazy with the
[2743.319s] tariffs but right now they&#39;re doing well
[2745.119s] that&#39;s what we keep this is the chart
[2746.76s] that no one&#39;s paying attention to that
[2748.24s] we&#39;ve been talking about for six months
[2750.76s] is to watch the Japanese government bond
[2753.64s] yield and watch the carry trade unwind
[2755.96s] all of this hot money is coming out and
[2758.8s] while all the media is blaming
[2762.48s] tariffs all the money is coming out of
[2764.68s] mag7 which are unaffected by tariffs why
[2768.079s] because Japan has been printing money
[2770.2s] for three decades they&#39;re getting
[2772.2s] inflation and now they have to raise
[2774.64s] rates to quell the inflation and every
[2777.92s] day you see this go up mag 7 goes down
[2781.64s] today was no different you know and we
[2784.24s] will continue to see this so that&#39;s why
[2787.359s] for three plus months we&#39;ve been
[2789.4s] suggesting lighten up on your mag 7 this
[2792.88s] is not good what&#39;s going to happen to
[2795.52s] those crowded trades and what&#39;s going to
[2797.92s] happen under the surface is fortunes are
[2799.839s] going to be made and we got our first
[2802.48s] taste of it barely a taste it&#39;s like a
[2804.96s] sample when you go to the ice cream
[2806.4s] parlor we&#39;re going to get the whole
[2807.96s] Sunday Inc coming months and years which
[2810.559s] is what happened with Alibaba that&#39;s
[2812.319s] just the beginning of what&#39;s going to
[2814.24s] happen what happened today with in
[2817.44s] all of these I mean I&#39;m I&#39;m super
[2819.72s] excited about Intel as a matter of fact
[2821.319s] it was so funny I saw the news last
[2825.119s] night and I get and I was flying home
[2827.48s] from uh um New York and I get in this
[2832.079s] morning and I&#39;m like I know I bought a
[2834.52s] lot of Intel I just like I really hope I
[2837.44s] bought enough and I look and and I&#39;m
[2839.76s] looking at the position I&#39;m like oh my
[2842.4s] gosh this is our third largest position
[2844.599s] this is unbelievable because it just
[2847.04s] kept going down and we kept buying more
[2850.64s] uh you know it was like went 19 to 23
[2855.44s] and then it dropped back to 21 and we&#39;re
[2857.319s] like we bought more then it went up to
[2859.16s] like 25 or 26 then it went down to 21 we
[2862.92s] bought more because why because it was
[2865.48s] trading if they liquidated the whole
[2866.92s] thing tomorrow we would have got back
[2868.319s] like 20 25 bucks so we had our downside
[2871.04s] protected if they completely screwed up
[2873.28s] the Fabs we&#39;d probably have a double on
[2874.88s] the Legacy business with the refresh is
[2876.64s] see CPUs and if they actually got
[2879.079s] anything right we&#39;d have a triple and if
[2881.24s] they really got someone to run it uh
[2883.359s] which they by the way they just did this
[2885.079s] thing could be a five bagger plus
[2887.359s] because guess what your broadcom your
[2890.359s] nvidias your your chip quote unquote
[2893.64s] designers think that they&#39;re brilliant
[2895.92s] but they rely on the kindness of
[2898.319s] strangers if tsmc goes away tomorrow
[2902.119s] Nvidia ceases to exist because no one
[2904.48s] can produce their designs so Intel is
[2908.44s] going to solve that problem for the
[2910.44s] world and help them out and they&#39;re
[2912.92s] right now testing Nvidia chips and avago
[2915.48s] chips uh or broadcom in Intel factories
[2919.359s] and the 18a is looking better than
[2921.4s] everyone expected and now you got a
[2923.28s] winner which you&#39;re not going to believe
[2925.88s] what I have to say about this guy today
[2927.8s] who&#39;s G to run us and take it to the
[2929.599s] promised land I thought Ginger could do
[2931.44s] it because he was on the 5 yard line uh
[2933.96s] this guy is going to be able to spike
[2935.44s] the football not just once but probably
[2938.24s] five times it&#39;s going to be a complete
[2939.92s] blowout as they increase capacity and by
[2942.4s] the way the turnaround for those of you
[2943.92s] who are in inidia and just got
[2946.2s] slacked um
[2948.96s] nvidia&#39;s next phase will be dependent on
[2951.88s] the success of Intel so if you&#39;re
[2954.0s] playing Nvidia you&#39;re better off getting
[2956.319s] more leverage playing Intel because if
[2958.559s] Nvidia is going to double from here
[2960.359s] Intel&#39;s probably going to 5x from here
[2962.559s] is really what what it&#39;s going to take
[2964.0s] and honestly I hope that happens I hope
[2966.16s] Nvidia doubles from here because the
[2968.0s] only way they&#39;re doubling is if intel
[2970.04s] provides the excess capacity uh because
[2973.04s] even if tsmc breaks ground on$ 150
[2976.4s] billion dollar of factories tomorrow in
[2979.359s] Arizona or Ohio or wherever the hell
[2981.88s] they want to put them it&#39;s going to take
[2983.28s] them five years Intel&#39;s been wasting
[2985.079s] money for the last five years but
[2986.559s] they&#39;re ready to
[2987.76s] go so there you go uh just like everyone
[2991.359s] talking about tariffs affecting
[2995.319s] Netflix what it&#39;s the effing carry trade
[2998.16s] wake up look at this chart every morning
[3001.24s] stop looking at the S&amp;P just look here
[3003.359s] if it&#39;s going up Tech is going to have
[3004.92s] trouble today if it&#39;s going down Tech is
[3007.079s] going to rally and and probably in big
[3009.079s] violent bounces when it when it uh eases
[3011.359s] up all right in preparation for our
[3014.4s] amazing special guest next week the CEO
[3017.16s] of Cooper standard Jeffrey Edwards I
[3020.68s] want you guys to impress this chart in
[3023.88s] your brain this is you USR going all the
[3029.0s] way back to
[3030.799s] 1967 so almost
[3033.96s] 50
[3035.68s] years uh excuse me more than 50 years uh
[3040.319s] we&#39;re basically almost 60 years and
[3043.599s] what&#39;s the common denominator ladies and
[3046.079s] gentlemen is that SAR Peaks out every
[3051.599s] single cycle every single 7 to 10 years
[3055.28s] you have Peaks and TRS this this is the
[3057.24s] definition of a cyclical business it&#39;s
[3059.88s] why we bought it when we bought it at
[3062.72s] the bottom of the cycle when no one
[3064.799s] wants it it Peaks out between 17 and 20
[3070.0s] million units 17 and 20 million units so
[3074.72s] our whole
[3076.4s] thesis was predicated on in
[3080.04s] 2017 they had uh 17.1 million SAR they
[3085.119s] generated $7 and 19 cents of earnings
[3088.68s] because of all the operating leverage as
[3090.28s] you get over their Break Even which is
[3091.96s] 151 153 whatever it happens to be in
[3094.88s] terms of production um and they minted
[3098.52s] money so at $7.20 a share the market
[3101.92s] assigned them a 20 times earnings
[3104.319s] multiple and the stock was
[3108.92s] $146 they have since taken out tons of
[3113.559s] costs 500 600 million in costs which
[3117.16s] means that if they get the normal
[3119.72s] cyclical top between 17 million and 18
[3124.119s] million the thing can earn 7 to $10 plus
[3128.359s] I think it&#39;s going to be over $10 a
[3130.24s] share we&#39;re going to talk about
[3131.88s] potentially why uh next week we&#39;re going
[3134.799s] to we&#39;re going to stress test our our
[3136.799s] thesis on the CEO and see if he agrees
[3139.44s] or
[3140.28s] disagrees uh and he also has the right
[3142.559s] to not answer and uh not and smile and
[3145.68s] not respond if that&#39;s what he chooses to
[3147.559s] do uh but here&#39;s the other thing ladies
[3149.96s] and gentlemen so we&#39;re like oh we could
[3151.799s] just get that back to 17 million okay
[3153.72s] let me tell you what didn&#39;t
[3155.68s] exist uh the last four times that we
[3158.839s] peaked well above 17 million at cyclical
[3161.64s] tops I&#39;ll tell you what what didn&#39;t
[3163.48s] exist number one you didn&#39;t have cars
[3165.52s] that were on average 13 and a half years
[3167.68s] old the oldest that they&#39;ve ever been
[3169.319s] breaking down by the minute uh so number
[3171.88s] one that didn&#39;t exist I&#39;ll tell you what
[3173.559s] else didn&#39;t exist the number of human
[3175.48s] beings in a America didn&#39;t exist and
[3179.16s] take a look at this ladies and gentlemen
[3181.2s] in
[3183.4s] 1986 which is very similar second term
[3186.44s] of Reagan after coming off a depressing
[3189.16s] 1982 which was attributable to what by
[3191.559s] the way the huge vulker tax uh uh the
[3195.24s] huge vulker rate hikes just like we had
[3198.28s] with uh Powell here in 2022 that crashed
[3203.079s] the car market it came back just like
[3206.0s] this trickled up here and then just
[3208.68s] spiked when no one expected a little bit
[3210.559s] of fake back maybe we&#39;ll get a little
[3211.88s] bit of fake back and then a huge Spike
[3213.88s] up to 17 18 and then 20 million 21
[3218.68s] million SAR by the end of Reagan&#39;s term
[3221.68s] so two things that didn&#39;t exist during
[3224.24s] that ladies and gentlemen number one
[3225.48s] rates were a little higher even though
[3226.72s] they had come down off the vulker high
[3228.52s] okay leave that aside okay we&#39;ve got how
[3232.04s] many people in America right now about
[3234.92s] 330 million by the US Census do you know
[3238.52s] how many we had when they did 20 million
[3240.359s] SAR after the vulker uh hikes crashed
[3243.28s] the car market they only had
[3247.96s] 226 million people ladies and gentlemen
[3251.359s] so they did 20 million cars catch up on
[3256.44s] a third less of the people 100 million
[3259.52s] less people they did 5 million more cars
[3264.44s] it was catchup after rat started coming
[3267.16s] down off the peak and you had Reagan
[3269.64s] part two well now we&#39;ve got Trump part
[3271.2s] two the only difference is from 26 226
[3276.119s] to 331 is almost a 50% increase uh we
[3281.16s] got the cars that are older than they&#39;ve
[3282.839s] ever been it would not Shock Me okay and
[3286.64s] I was too damn conservative when I
[3288.48s] bought this company at $510 and $5.50 in
[3292.72s] in May of
[3294.04s] 2022 I mean don&#39;t get me wrong we own a
[3296.079s] ton of it but um and we&#39;ve added every
[3299.319s] single opportunity new money came in
[3300.88s] today I&#39;d be buying a ton of Cooper
[3302.799s] standard at 13 and14 all day long
[3306.319s] personally and I will by the way and new
[3307.799s] money is coming in this week so uh just
[3310.2s] from existing clients because we&#39;re not
[3311.72s] open to new new smaller accounts uh
[3314.119s] until April 1 but uh I think we&#39;re going
[3317.68s] to hit 20 for a minute in this cycle and
[3321.039s] maybe we&#39;re going to get a fake back
[3322.319s] before that with a little bit of the
[3324.16s] consumer confidence in the second
[3325.68s] quarter although they were going to pull
[3326.839s] forward production in the first quarter
[3328.68s] because of this deadline which uh may
[3331.4s] prove to be such a blessing in disguise
[3333.2s] imagine they do this deadline they pull
[3335.839s] all this production forward the tariffs
[3337.76s] aren&#39;t as bad as possible and you keep
[3339.16s] those elevated production levels and the
[3341.28s] business is set up to just absolutely
[3343.28s] minant money so this is the biggest
[3345.52s] thing that I had never thought about is
[3348.119s] I kept saying well we&#39;re going to get
[3349.559s] back to 17 to 18 because we we&#39;ve done
[3351.68s] that every single cycle for the last 40
[3353.52s] years what I and by the way the 70s
[3356.799s] okay which which peaked at like 16 and
[3359.839s] change which they&#39;d still probably earn
[3362.24s] five6 dollar a share and we&#39;re going to
[3363.839s] talk about why uh the population was
[3366.839s] only 203 million I mean you can&#39;t make
[3370.039s] this stuff up ladies and gentlemen I
[3372.0s] think there&#39;s so much pent up demand we
[3374.079s] could wind up but just on 17 17 and a
[3378.64s] half I think we easily do $10 a share
[3381.28s] and I&#39;m going to explain why next week
[3383.72s] uh and God forbid we actually get to8
[3387.16s] 192 then then the question is what
[3389.88s] multiple do you apply maybe we don&#39;t get
[3391.48s] a 20 multiple like we got in 2017 or
[3394.0s] they got in 2017 I didn&#39;t even know they
[3396.039s] existed in 2017 so maybe at $10 we only
[3399.359s] have a $100 stock well we&#39;re a $13 stock
[3401.559s] now that wouldn&#39;t be the worst case
[3402.76s] scenario what if we get a 15 times what
[3404.68s] if we get a 20 times multiple I am so
[3406.96s] excited about next week uh but I&#39;m also
[3409.64s] excited about this week why because
[3411.92s] Intel&#39;s getting upgraded why because lip
[3415.28s] Boot tan was appointed the new CEO he
[3418.839s] was on the board he resigned because he
[3421.16s] didn&#39;t like the direction they were
[3422.28s] taking they came back They begged him to
[3423.96s] join that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened and
[3427.2s] all these words I mean this is almost
[3429.48s] comical by the way these uh uh firms
[3433.079s] came out Bank of America maril lanch
[3435.52s] Morgan Stanley they come out and say oh
[3437.52s] this CEO looks good why because the
[3439.92s] stock was up 133% overnight so they had
[3442.28s] to take their price Target up from 20 to
[3444.48s] now 25 I mean you&#39;re taking your price
[3447.079s] Target up $5 on lip bhan are you smoking
[3451.799s] crack I mean let me tell you what lip
[3454.0s] boan did at Cadence Design Systems okay
[3457.96s] he came into Cadence designs January of
[3461.559s] 2009 after the stock was down
[3465.88s] 85% okay
[3468.559s] and it was trading at
[3471.72s] $3.50 in January of 2009 when he was
[3475.4s] appointed full time CEO and over from
[3479.76s] 2009 to when he left as executive
[3482.559s] chairman on May of
[3485.359s] 2023 the stock went from 350 to
[3491.88s] $239 okay so basically in 14 years you
[3497.48s] had a 68 bagger if anyone knows how to
[3501.72s] run a turnaround it&#39;s lip boo tan and
[3506.2s] that&#39;s
[3507.68s] 6800 and for those of you who don&#39;t add
[3510.24s] well okay $1 million investment when he
[3514.2s] became CEO became a $68
[3518.64s] million value by the time he stepped
[3521.599s] down 14 years later 1 million became 68
[3524.88s] million 100,000 became 6.8 million 10
[3528.92s] million became 680 million 100 million
[3532.24s] became
[3533.359s] $6.8 billion dollar riding this winning
[3537.799s] jockey who knows the business inside up
[3540.599s] out upside down and sideways and these
[3543.119s] Schmucks are upgrading at $5 a share you
[3545.76s] can&#39;t make this stuff up but if it
[3547.52s] wasn&#39;t for people like that we wouldn&#39;t
[3549.88s] have opportunities like this bet on a
[3553.039s] winning jockey ladies and gentlemen and
[3555.44s] Watch What Happens total option put
[3558.68s] volumes moving average 5 day retail
[3562.839s] investors buying all the insurance
[3566.839s] available in the world after the house
[3569.559s] is burned down at the highest prices
[3572.039s] possible do you think these guys are
[3574.64s] going to get paid out on their puts in
[3576.359s] the hole no the sellers are going to
[3578.599s] make Bank the buyers are going to lose
[3580.92s] 100% it&#39;s the way the game works it&#39;s
[3583.44s] the way the game has always worked
[3584.88s] there&#39;s no way in hell even if the
[3587.88s] market continues to go down for the next
[3590.52s] two weeks I guarantee you by option
[3593.16s] expiration where you look where all the
[3594.88s] weights are which is probably probably
[3596.28s] in April and May I guarantee you these
[3598.839s] things aren&#39;t paying a goddamn Penny to
[3601.4s] one person who bought a put option in
[3603.599s] the last week when they went to record
[3605.359s] all-time highs which always marks a
[3607.24s] bottom ladies and gentlemen uh here we
[3610.119s] go uh bull bear spread again extreme
[3614.119s] that we have not seen basically since
[3616.799s] the covid lows in
[3619.799s] 2020 and that was time to be a buyer not
[3622.76s] a seller and 2020 was a little different
[3625.72s] cuz was more pronounced when you have a
[3628.0s] drop this Steep and this pronounced it
[3630.24s] tends to recover more quickly and I
[3632.64s] think that&#39;s where we are so even if
[3634.16s] goes a little lower maybe flush Monday
[3636.44s] and then turn around Tuesday we&#39;ll see
[3638.96s] uh I think we&#39;re basically there and
[3640.44s] we&#39;re certainly there for the type of
[3641.64s] stocks that we buy as would I be you
[3644.24s] know if you put a gun to my head would I
[3645.48s] buy would I you know they say you got to
[3647.4s] buy a MAG 7even I you know maybe I&#39;d buy
[3649.799s] some Amazon here maybe I&#39;d buy some uh
[3653.079s] maybe I&#39;d buy some Google I don&#39;t know
[3654.72s] man I&#39;ve been using and that is the most
[3657.039s] incredible thing uh I&#39;m really impressed
[3660.599s] by grock which is U musk AI through
[3664.44s] Twitter um so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know I
[3667.16s] don&#39;t know but they&#39;ve got Yahoo and
[3668.28s] they&#39;ve got the data center business
[3669.52s] they&#39;ve got all that stuff but but I&#39;m
[3670.96s] not I&#39;m not no one&#39;s putting a gun to my
[3672.559s] head so therefore I&#39;m going to buy the
[3673.599s] things that I feel comfortable have a
[3675.359s] huge margin of safety I don&#39;t have to
[3676.839s] worry about the market every single day
[3678.24s] I know what the business is worth and I
[3680.079s] know I&#39;m going to get my doubles or
[3681.039s] triples in a reasonable amount of time
[3682.48s] rinse and repeat over and over uh this
[3685.48s] is a phenomenal thing a friend did for
[3687.319s] me because I&#39;ve been talking about the
[3689.839s] uh carry trade unwind and we showed last
[3692.44s] week how the Microsoft PE contracts as
[3696.079s] the 10-year jgb yield increases showing
[3699.119s] that the carry trade is in fact
[3700.44s] impacting things here you can see it a
[3702.2s] little clearer uh although it&#39;s not
[3704.24s] concentrated to the mag 7 which I think
[3706.079s] is the most crowded it&#39;s just NASDAQ 100
[3709.0s] the um I don&#39;t re okay they did the
[3712.4s] currency TR uh thing too I don&#39;t really
[3714.68s] care about that what you can see here is
[3718.72s] the green line is jgb 10year yields they
[3722.839s] get these abrupt spikes and you get a
[3724.599s] crash
[3726.24s] in
[3728.039s] um when they Spike up the NASDAQ in blue
[3732.68s] crushes so it&#39;s an inverse relationship
[3734.559s] you get the spikes in uh the 10-year
[3738.079s] yield uh Japanese government bonds which
[3739.96s] means the carry trade unwind you get a
[3741.64s] deleveraging in the crowded trades
[3744.2s] spikes and then Del leverages spikes and
[3746.839s] then Del leverages and this is uh you
[3750.16s] know this is just the way it works this
[3752.359s] shouldn&#39;t be surprising but apparently
[3754.24s] for those you remember last year we were
[3756.279s] showing this chart and we said we&#39;ve
[3758.24s] never seen an opportunity like this
[3760.92s] how overvalued the mag 7 uh was relative
[3765.2s] to Chinese Tech double top double bottom
[3768.64s] well what&#39;s happened this has gone
[3769.96s] straight up this has gone straight down
[3772.079s] they are converging these divergences
[3773.839s] are where fortunes are made and we&#39;re at
[3775.64s] the early stages ladies and gentlemen
[3777.92s] here we go hedge funds have dumped
[3779.24s] stocks over the last two weeks at the
[3780.76s] fastest Pace in history that is a contra
[3783.2s] indicator they did the exact same thing
[3785.64s] in late 2020 when we were were buying
[3788.039s] until our hands were sore um the tech
[3792.039s] that were they were s selling in the
[3793.359s] government we&#39;re generally not Tech
[3794.64s] investors but it was so damn cheap to
[3796.319s] buy Amazon and uh and uh and Google and
[3801.16s] um and meta I
[3803.16s] mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up same
[3805.4s] thing happen happened in 2018 in the
[3807.799s] beginning when there was the Tariff TRS
[3809.76s] and then sure enough you got the rally
[3811.0s] into the summer everyone forgets that uh
[3813.599s] memories are short this is a better
[3815.64s] characterization we&#39;re kind of like
[3817.2s] right here ladies and gentlemen so if we
[3818.68s] get a final flush or if we got it this
[3820.559s] week I don&#39;t know and then you just go
[3822.4s] straight up into summer is effectively
[3824.319s] what happens uh steifel upgraded VF Corp
[3827.92s] this week to $35 price Target we&#39;re
[3831.0s] going to spend some time on that uh in
[3833.48s] the article of the week this shows the
[3836.359s] different draw Downs uh throughout the
[3839.2s] years and recoveries here&#39;s the
[3841.799s] Bloomberg dollar Index again just
[3843.96s] rolling over as we had anticipated
[3846.319s] 10-year government bond yield this is
[3848.079s] now 157 that&#39;s why you saw volatility in
[3850.4s] Tech this week and not really a lot else
[3853.279s] mostly just Tech and chinate Tech was up
[3856.079s] and the businesses that have a large
[3857.72s] enough margin of safety people are just
[3859.279s] crowding out of as the carry trade on
[3861.599s] wines and you have forced structural
[3863.599s] liquidations redemptions um from those
[3866.24s] funds that were overweight uh got smoked
[3868.839s] better than deep seek and open AI
[3871.44s] Alibaba touts open source AI model that
[3873.799s] beats Rivals and they&#39;ve also said it
[3877.319s] outperforms deep seek and it uses fewer
[3881.279s] resources so what was the theme that
[3883.2s] hurt Nvidia deep seek said we can do the
[3886.24s] same or better with a lot less chips
[3888.52s] well now Alibaba saying thank you deep
[3890.64s] seek not only can we do better than open
[3893.039s] Ai and better than you we can do it with
[3895.92s] fewer resources than you have so suck it
[3899.359s] is what they said it&#39;s basically what it
[3901.16s] comes down to so um uh there we go
[3906.359s] so S&amp;P
[3908.559s] 500% of members above the 20000 day
[3912.279s] moving average uh so breath is closing
[3915.319s] in a little bit it this seems to me like
[3917.64s] where it wants to settle out we&#39;ll find
[3920.16s] out worst to First trailing and
[3922.76s] predicted 10-year Total return by stock
[3924.599s] category well
[3927.16s] uh everyone was saying us exceptionalism
[3929.799s] now it has the lowest expected return
[3932.039s] everyone was saying uh stay away from
[3934.96s] International uh or stay away from
[3936.96s] Emerging Markets now it has the highest
[3938.64s] expected return for the next uh 10 years
[3942.039s] over double digits and developed xus no
[3946.2s] one you couldn&#39;t give it away two months
[3948.2s] ago now it&#39;s has the second highest
[3950.039s] expected return so amazing how quickly
[3952.72s] things change last shall be first ladies
[3955.92s] and gentlemen you remember the themes in
[3957.559s] the Articles so that&#39;s playing out
[3959.16s] before your eyes fed fund
[3962.16s] Futures uh this is a complicated chart
[3965.079s] all you need to know is last time I
[3966.44s] looked at it yesterday June chance of a
[3970.039s] cut went up to 90% huge outflow from
[3972.92s] crypto this week so all the leverage
[3975.76s] trades uh like mag 7 like crypto like
[3979.16s] the r rip uh risk on that are dependent
[3983.039s] on free funding currencies are getting
[3985.119s] unw
[3986.799s] uh in recent weeks largest four-weekly
[3989.359s] inflow into European equities in 10
[3993.0s] years okay so this is the kind of thing
[3995.68s] that you saw when 2001 and 2002 when
[3999.24s] emerging markets in international and
[4000.88s] small cap and value outperformed for
[4002.72s] seven plus years all the conditions are
[4004.88s] setting up everyone on this podcast the
[4007.16s] last six months knew it was coming
[4008.96s] prepared for it and now we&#39;re taking
[4010.88s] advantage so congratulations to you and
[4013.24s] for those of you who are new there&#39;s
[4014.799s] still plenty of time still incredible
[4017.319s] opportunities uh to get money to work
[4019.839s] soon the window&#39;s going to close very
[4021.599s] very quickly but um now is the time and
[4025.279s] super duper excited you know it&#39;s like a
[4028.039s] lot of people are like yeah but I feel
[4029.319s] like I missed Alibaba and you said to
[4031.839s] come in in January and all that stuff
[4033.48s] and look what&#39;s happened Alibaba and
[4034.68s] that&#39;s absolutely right you did miss it
[4036.599s] but that&#39;s the bad news the good news is
[4039.559s] uh you know we have more ideas than we
[4041.68s] have uh available Capital we&#39;re fully
[4043.92s] invested here I mean this is the time
[4045.599s] you want to be buying on red days this
[4047.24s] is where you when you look back 12
[4048.839s] months like we did in March of 2023 and
[4051.96s] October of 2022 when we were pounding
[4054.4s] the table uh you know those things don&#39;t
[4056.64s] come around all the time and there&#39;s
[4058.4s] just so much exciting stuff to do right
[4061.039s] now and
[4062.64s] um uh this is like a kid in a candy
[4065.68s] store I got to be honest with you core
[4067.039s] wrist model this is getting to an
[4068.68s] extreme that&#39;s from macarts
[4070.76s] decom um so that&#39;s that the momentum ETF
[4074.48s] cracking of course
[4076.16s] hang Sayang broke out back tested and
[4079.2s] now it&#39;s it&#39;s green again so you know I
[4083.0s] it&#39;s so funny because now everyone&#39;s
[4084.64s] coming to me and asking should I buy
[4086.92s] Alibaba and I feel so bad it&#39;s like it&#39;s
[4089.599s] up you know more than 100% off the
[4093.48s] lows and in a relatively short period of
[4096.239s] time and I know it&#39;s going up a lot more
[4098.719s] but like to tell them to buy I&#39;m like
[4101.319s] well hopefully wait for a pullback I
[4102.96s] don&#39;t I just don&#39;t know if you&#39;re going
[4104.04s] to get it we kind of got it into to the
[4105.679s] 120 so it&#39;s like do I tell them to buy
[4108.08s] at 140 and then it goes to you know 125
[4111.12s] and they&#39;re like scared or whatever
[4112.92s] before it goes to 200 I I don&#39;t know you
[4115.08s] should have been listening a year ago
[4116.359s] when all of us were on here white
[4118.08s] knuckling it at60 and $70 saying yeah
[4121.08s] I&#39;ll buy
[4122.199s] more and uh bringing our bases down I
[4125.52s] mean it&#39;s just fun all right so uh there
[4129.159s] we go relative
[4131.239s] performance Max draw Downs what else do
[4134.12s] we have here a AI I bearish sentiment at
[4136.679s] all-time highs we haven&#39;t seen this High
[4139.159s] bull versus bare ratio since the lows in
[4141.359s] October the last time I was this giddy
[4143.159s] about
[4144.199s] opportunity uh so here we are again
[4146.4s] ladies and gentlemen so that&#39;s that the
[4148.48s] only difference is I know that the mag
[4150.799s] seven are going to technically bounce
[4152.12s] and probably have a violent bounce here
[4154.279s] at some point but I don&#39;t think they&#39;re
[4156.199s] going to trade above their range for a
[4158.64s] while I I think they&#39;re going to
[4160.08s] continue to underperform for at least
[4161.719s] the next 12 months um they&#39;re great
[4165.56s] businesses they just got ahead of
[4167.0s] themselves and I think there&#39;s just so
[4168.08s] many more better risk rewards you know
[4170.44s] and even if I bought you know if someone
[4172.199s] put a gun in my head and I had to buy
[4173.719s] Amazon and I was right and it went up
[4177.4s] 50% over the next 18
[4181.799s] months I don&#39;t get into any stock for
[4184.48s] 50% if I can&#39;t get at least a double in
[4186.679s] two or three years I won&#39;t take any risk
[4188.64s] of capital so it&#39;s got to be at least a
[4190.679s] double plus and I just don&#39;t see it in
[4192.48s] those names at all or anything close to
[4194.76s] it for the foreseeable future over the
[4196.64s] long term yeah for sure probably but uh
[4199.08s] not in the short term US Stocks lag in
[4201.199s] global peers by record amount this has
[4203.76s] even become more pronounced so it&#39;s like
[4205.36s] a 15-point spread if you
[4207.76s] go tremendous 10 China the top 10
[4211.239s] Chinese tech stocks uh relative to the
[4214.0s] mag
[4215.12s] 7 the spread is now almost
[4217.719s] 65% year to date because China techs up
[4221.239s] some
[4223.0s] 55 no it&#39;s it&#39;s almost 70% % and mag 7
[4226.199s] was down 15 uh as the basket it might
[4229.56s] have got down 18 now I mean it&#39;s just
[4232.239s] it&#39;s unreal I mean I couldn&#39;t have made
[4233.84s] the stuff up and then what does City
[4235.44s] Group do after China Tech doubles and
[4237.96s] mag s crashes uh 20% and More in many
[4242.12s] cases City downgrades US Stocks to
[4244.76s] neutral after like three weeks ago it
[4247.0s] was all about us exceptionalism upgrades
[4249.52s] China to overweight I mean oh my gosh
[4252.84s] it&#39;s like walk watching a comedy movie I
[4255.6s] mean Steve Martin should be writing
[4257.08s] these uh these upgrades and downgrades
[4260.159s] you know maybe we&#39;ll get will Ferell to
[4261.679s] work for City Bank and write some of
[4263.12s] these papers fear and greed Index this
[4265.36s] is not where you want to be a seller
[4266.8s] ladies and gentlemen yeah these things
[4268.239s] can bump around for a couple of weeks
[4269.84s] but uh it&#39;s extreme Fe fear it&#39;s
[4272.56s] palpable not only did we get the upgrade
[4275.04s] in uh Intel and we got it in VF Corp but
[4279.0s] we got it in gxo logistics ladies and
[4281.679s] gentlemen Steve will put it out with a
[4284.08s] buy 60 $6 price Target they&#39;re doing
[4287.04s] good work over at steel those guys are
[4288.84s] awake and I got some friends over there
[4291.239s] that are just doing great stuff so uh
[4293.92s] kudos to you and guess what price is
[4296.56s] what you pay value is what you get we&#39;re
[4298.639s] still get buying the things with the
[4300.48s] greatest value for the least amount of
[4302.32s] price highest earnings growth lows
[4303.84s] multiple merging markets China xus us
[4307.28s] still has the slowest earnings growth
[4309.48s] for the highest multiple so yeah keep
[4311.36s] crowding into those trades and as the
[4313.32s] Kyrie trade unwinds you&#39;re going to
[4315.239s] continue to get monkey hammered every
[4317.679s] single week you&#39;ll get your technical
[4320.04s] rallies and then you&#39;ll get smoked and
[4321.88s] it&#39;s just going to continue on like that
[4323.44s] for some time mag s index draw down I
[4327.6s] mean 20 over 20% and this what I think
[4331.88s] was March 10th that was three days ago
[4334.6s] it&#39;s probably 22 23% for those people
[4337.04s] who were concentrated in the most
[4338.36s] crowded trades stock winners become the
[4340.76s] biggest
[4341.679s] losers so this is a way of saying the
[4345.4s] last shall be first or the first became
[4347.679s] last what&#39;s the best health care which
[4349.679s] we talked about remember at the end of
[4351.4s] the year materials is up there still not
[4353.76s] flying yet but but up there in the top
[4356.04s] groups what&#39;s the worst what was first
[4358.84s] tech uh uh it some consumer
[4361.84s] discretionary there&#39;s going to be some
[4362.88s] opportunities in consumer discretionary
[4364.56s] very very
[4366.88s] now like right now uh so that&#39;s that
[4370.0s] cyclical over defensive Total return
[4372.239s] rate ratio you can see that rolling over
[4375.44s] mag 7 you know conver uh catching down
[4378.92s] to uh European Defense
[4381.719s] stocks mortgage applications are spiking
[4384.36s] up this is our theme guys people looking
[4386.88s] at me like I&#39;m sideways housing&#39;s going
[4388.679s] to come roaring back when rates come
[4390.56s] down besson&#39;s got it he&#39;s got it handled
[4393.199s] and the FED will now be back in the game
[4395.32s] the fed put will be back in the game if
[4397.36s] you get we&#39;re g to see a 30-year
[4400.12s] mortgage rate below 6% sometime this
[4402.32s] year and when that happens these
[4404.28s] mortgage applications are going to go
[4406.4s] from wow like we&#39;ve seen in the last uh
[4410.0s] couple of months to they can&#39;t make a
[4412.44s] chart large enough for how many
[4414.199s] applications are going to happen why
[4416.159s] because the third thing that I didn&#39;t
[4417.76s] cover with as it relates to CPS is not
[4419.8s] only is the population bigger and the
[4421.56s] cars are older but the third thing that
[4423.199s] I didn&#39;t cover is the bulk of our
[4424.719s] population is 34 years old and the ma
[4427.28s] the the number one time that people buy
[4428.88s] an extra car and a new car is when they
[4431.159s] start families and when they&#39;re they&#39;re
[4433.4s] in their Peak spending and Peak earning
[4435.239s] years from 30 to 40 plus is when they
[4438.199s] spend all the money on extra cars and
[4440.0s] they they buy a new house they move out
[4441.719s] to the suburbs they have a kid they Buy
[4443.56s] dishwashers they buy all that stuff and
[4445.199s] that&#39;s the kind of stuff that&#39;s going to
[4446.199s] fly for the next five years and um you
[4449.28s] heard it here first but do you
[4451.6s] play
[4453.159s] the you know like we make the analogy
[4456.84s] with the uh with Cooper standard do you
[4459.08s] play The oems Who are going to be duking
[4460.8s] itself out duking themselves out for
[4463.199s] volumes and margin compression or do you
[4464.88s] pay the arms dealers who benefit from
[4467.0s] higher volumes and we&#39;re we&#39;re playing
[4469.12s] the arms dealers the generx of the world
[4471.8s] the um Stanley Black and Deckers of the
[4474.56s] world so while the supply of houses is
[4477.84s] going to pick up rapidly when these
[4479.48s] rates come down and they&#39;re going to be
[4482.08s] you know fighting against each other uh
[4485.84s] the suppliers like Stanley and like um J
[4490.36s] and the other uh covert housing plays
[4492.679s] are going to hockey stick and with huge
[4495.28s] margins because there&#39;s no one else left
[4497.239s] in town uh and they&#39;re the best brands
[4500.04s] in the business with gener having 75% of
[4502.199s] the home stand by generators DeWalt
[4504.6s] Stanley Black &amp; Decker Craftsman the
[4507.199s] best of Best in Class if you&#39;re going to
[4508.8s] construct something you&#39;re going to use
[4510.0s] their stuff uh this was the fastest
[4512.84s] Market correction since 1950 here are
[4514.92s] the list this was the fifth fastest
[4517.199s] those tends to get pretty big bounces as
[4519.84s] well here&#39;s the performance of the mag 7
[4522.0s] this is a little old but Tesla round
[4523.76s] tripped it down 5 2% Nvidia was down
[4526.679s] over 30% the rest of these were all down
[4529.04s] over 20% except for uh Apple was down
[4532.48s] close to
[4534.76s] 20%
[4536.32s] um so that&#39;s that where are we at here
[4539.0s] we&#39;re almost done with
[4540.76s] these fund flows into the biggest US
[4543.679s] listed European Equity ETFs is the
[4545.679s] highest since
[4550.719s] 2017 China large
[4553.32s] cap ETF fxi still has an
[4558.159s] alltime high short interest the only
[4561.8s] time you had a short interest this
[4564.159s] High uh or even close to this High
[4567.0s] rather and it was only a third of as
[4568.76s] high as it is now it was a record back
[4570.88s] then was in 2016 when you had a
[4573.6s] parabolic move straight up in Alibaba
[4575.639s] and Chinese tech stocks uh was the last
[4578.32s] time you had this level of short
[4579.719s] interest now we&#39;ve got three times the
[4581.48s] short interest the more we push higher
[4583.32s] the more these guys are going to be
[4584.52s] forced buyers and unnatural and that&#39;s
[4587.56s] why I told you when we were at 60 and 70
[4590.36s] and $80 that once this thing goes
[4593.159s] they&#39;re not going to let anyone in and
[4595.56s] that&#39;s exactly what happened I mean it
[4597.08s] didn&#39;t let anyone in and it&#39;s still not
[4599.0s] letting anyone in and it&#39;s probably
[4600.36s] going to push higher and all those
[4601.48s] people that missed it are going to miss
[4602.56s] it more and they&#39;re going to be forced
[4603.96s] to buy it over with a two handle in
[4605.44s] front of it uh and really get the you
[4607.88s] know not a lot of the meat is really
[4609.639s] what it comes down to so Opposites
[4612.32s] Attract us and Hong Kong stocks diverge
[4615.08s] we&#39;ve covered that a gazillion times
[4617.199s] just trying to make the point uh here&#39;s
[4619.12s] from Seth golden oversold threshold I
[4621.36s] think this was today uh lowest S&amp;P RSI
[4624.719s] since 2020 which was the covid lows so
[4628.36s] every single time you hit this level
[4629.88s] you&#39;re going to get a monster bounce
[4631.48s] historically let&#39;s see if that holds
[4633.56s] true again this time I would bet that
[4635.56s] that is
[4636.44s] correct uh and so on CPI came in better
[4640.159s] than expected inflation numbers were
[4642.36s] good this
[4643.679s] week uh and that&#39;s
[4646.56s] that massive valuation gap
[4651.28s] between yeah us and
[4654.48s] China forward PE looking at 2223 in us
[4659.04s] China looking at 12 times and the
[4660.679s] earnings growth is accelerating in China
[4662.56s] decelerating in the US cyclically
[4664.92s] adjusted PE ratio in the US this is
[4668.12s] mindboggling cyclically adjusted PE
[4670.639s] ratio in the US is 38 times the highest
[4673.48s] it&#39;s been since 2022 before we had that
[4675.6s] big correction uh and in China it&#39;s only
[4679.76s] 10 times earnings down from 30 times at
[4684.52s] a peak in 2011 so what does that tell
[4687.44s] you ladies and gentlemen price is what
[4689.0s] you pay value is what you get you can
[4691.239s] buy at the top and ride it down or buy
[4693.04s] at the bottom and ride it up choice is
[4695.76s] yours
[4698.639s] uh GS retail favorites getting
[4703.28s] smoked value is outperforming and has
[4705.56s] been on the rising relative trend for a
[4707.56s] few months especially in the US value
[4710.04s] outperforms growth what have we been
[4712.32s] saying ladies and gentlemen stocks have
[4714.159s] bottomed on March 12th in the past 20
[4717.12s] years you are here so here we are ladies
[4720.0s] and gentlemen we&#39;ve shown similar charts
[4721.719s] like this uh expect good things to
[4724.159s] happen in coming weeks or sooner takes
[4727.32s] the Bulls have a bull market okay so
[4730.32s] here you can see here when you get the
[4733.44s] bull bear sentiment this flushed out you
[4735.719s] tend to get big uh recoveries sometimes
[4739.08s] you get double downs we&#39;re not facing
[4741.96s] anything economically that I think would
[4743.719s] warrant these type of double rollovers
[4746.239s] that that you&#39;re that you&#39;re talking
[4747.6s] about here have we finally reached Peak
[4750.36s] truck this is part of our kind of theme
[4752.8s] we&#39;re going to see more volume of houses
[4755.0s] but they&#39;re going to be smaller we&#39;re
[4756.08s] going to see more volume of cars and
[4758.159s] they&#39;re also going to be
[4760.719s] smaller risk appetite completely flushed
[4764.04s] out
[4766.0s] sector
[4767.239s] Outlook everyone&#39;s bullish on what&#39;s
[4770.28s] worked in the rear view
[4772.639s] mirror um I think there&#39;s going to be
[4774.679s] some opportunities here in uh consumer
[4778.04s] discretionary which we have some so
[4780.92s] Staples
[4782.28s] inflows people crowded into defense and
[4784.92s] healthc Care that&#39;ll probably back off
[4787.36s] uh in coming weeks and that&#39;s that let&#39;s
[4789.199s] go to some of the news people
[4790.48s] underestimate the importance of Chinese
[4792.12s] president Z&#39;s entrepreneurial meeting
[4795.239s] that&#39;s from alibaba&#39;s Joe Sai the
[4797.92s] importance of the meeting has been
[4799.04s] underestimated adding that quote it gave
[4801.32s] us the confidence to put our earnings
[4802.719s] back into capex Investments that&#39;s what
[4805.92s] you need to hear China&#39;s way to drive
[4808.8s] economic growth is getting consumers to
[4810.679s] unleash $20 trillion of rainy day
[4813.96s] savings says Alibaba chair Joe Sai they
[4817.719s] are pushing internal consumption
[4820.96s] domestic consumption and Alibaba is the
[4823.8s] toll taker middle class and upper class
[4826.76s] high quality consumption which is what
[4828.8s] they need to grow as an economy and
[4831.36s] given the targets that they&#39;ve set that
[4833.08s] is exactly what they need Alibaba
[4835.239s] releases AI model that reads emotions to
[4837.96s] take on open AI us China discuss a trump
[4842.88s] G Summit for June I mean if I&#39;d shown
[4846.88s] you these headlines uh last year you
[4849.239s] would have said I was crazy but I said
[4850.96s] this type of stuff was going to take
[4852.32s] place when you got a pragmatic
[4854.12s] Administration in in power as it relates
[4857.0s] to China yes he&#39;s going to drive a hard
[4859.199s] deal and yes he wants to do business he

[4888.28s] self-sufficiency Drive oh did I mention
[4890.679s] they&#39;re in the chip business which we
[4892.12s] talked about a year ago tsmc pitched
[4894.719s] Intel Foundry joint venture to Nvidia
[4897.28s] AMD broadcom sources say don&#39;t think
[4900.04s] that&#39;s going to happen with the new cea
[4901.719s] I think CEO I think lip buan is gonna
[4904.4s] say thanks but no thanks ladies and
[4906.28s] gentlemen I got it step aside you need
[4909.4s] me more than I need you you need
[4910.88s] capacity I got capacity let me show you
[4912.76s] how it&#39;s done uh there you go
[4915.04s] semiconductor veteran will succeed co-
[4916.84s] CEOs David zizar and Michelle Johnston
[4921.44s] hus uh Intel CEO signals that he&#39;ll
[4924.84s] stick with contentious Foundry plan of
[4928.32s] course he will he knows it&#39;s a monopoly
[4930.719s] it&#39;s the or excuse me it will be a
[4933.08s] duopoly right now it&#39;s a monopoly run by
[4935.28s] tsmc they&#39;re running the tables Intel&#39;s
[4938.08s] coming to play they have everything that
[4940.4s] Nvidia needs and avago needs which is
[4942.96s] capacity the reason nvidia&#39;s growth rate
[4946.04s] has decelerated from 250% revenue growth
[4949.239s] to lower than probably 40 30% by this
[4952.679s] year uh end of this year is is not for
[4955.92s] lack of demand it&#39;s for lack of ability
[4958.12s] to produce their business is ryant on
[4960.199s] the kindness of strangers and tsmc can&#39;t
[4962.84s] give them more than four billion of
[4964.239s] Revenue growth per quarter and when the
[4965.639s] base gets bigger it&#39;s a decelerating
[4967.44s] growth rate and when you have a 30 time
[4968.84s] sales multiple people say I can&#39;t pay
[4971.28s] that multiple if growth is decelerating
[4973.679s] uh why why it&#39;s decelerating is
[4975.4s] immaterial the fact is it&#39;s decelerating
[4977.679s] so you can tell me all day the cows come
[4979.639s] home people can&#39;t get chips and I&#39;ll
[4981.48s] tell you yeah that&#39;s exactly the problem
[4983.199s] people can&#39;t get chips Intel&#39;s going to
[4984.88s] solve that problem maybe it gives Nvidia
[4987.199s] the chance to have a second second wind
[4989.96s] once that capacity comes online but in
[4991.6s] the meantime uh they&#39;re handcuffed and
[4994.639s] uh and that&#39;s not going to change
[4995.76s] anytime soon until lip Bo tan saves the
[4999.12s] day and like I said if lip Bo tan Saves
[5002.199s] the Day why would you be in a stock that
[5004.12s] could be double uh called Nvidia when
[5006.719s] you could be a stock that could be a
[5007.96s] five to seven bagger in intel if they
[5010.88s] actually deliver on what&#39;s needed by the
[5012.8s] iagos the uh uh amds uh the nvidias of
[5017.239s] the world and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to
[5018.88s] take place if anyone can do it it&#39;s this
[5021.04s] guy Ginger probably would have done a
[5022.639s] decent job he was at the five yard line
[5024.719s] but um I I I just love how this played
[5028.36s] out Kelly Blue book report new vehicle
[5031.04s] prices increase year-over-year in
[5032.28s] February with record EV incentives and
[5034.44s] booming six fig
[5037.239s] sales so here is the average car price
[5040.28s] so it&#39;s basically Flatline since Fe
[5042.28s] February of
[5043.52s] 2022 this probably will start to go down
[5046.4s] by the end of the year as people opt for
[5049.84s] uh smaller or midsize cars and hybrids
[5053.159s] these incentives went straight up
[5054.639s] they&#39;re checking back a little bit we
[5056.48s] need to see them around 9 or 10 uh and I
[5059.4s] think we&#39;re going to get there very very
[5060.84s] soon once all these volumes start to
[5062.84s] come in uh which is going to be a
[5064.8s] function oh and by the way the one thing
[5066.32s] that I didn&#39;t mention in all of those
[5068.12s] Cycles the other thing that didn&#39;t exist
[5070.4s] which I&#39;m kind of surprised that he
[5072.639s] brought up I I understood why he said it
[5074.52s] in the campaign when Trump said he
[5076.4s] wanted to make interest payments on car
[5079.679s] loans tax deductible for
[5083.239s] individuals uh I was surprised I heard
[5085.6s] it after he got elected so this guy&#39;s
[5087.679s] following through he wants that in the
[5089.36s] tax package taxes on tips eliminated and
[5092.88s] interest rates um interest on car loans
[5097.44s] deductible you you couple that with 40%
[5100.4s] greater population oldest car
[5102.679s] Fleet uh I think we&#39;re I think we&#39;re
[5105.56s] being too conservative on this one is
[5107.28s] really what it comes down to I thought I
[5108.8s] was being overly optimistic now I think
[5110.4s] I&#39;m being too conservative us car buyers
[5112.52s] rush to dealer lots to avoid tariff
[5114.719s] related price hikes so they&#39;re gonna try
[5117.84s] to jam in a lot of production before
[5119.639s] August 2nd and buyers are going to jam
[5121.56s] in a lot of purchases which all works

[5134.679s] and gentlemen four bagger seven years
[5136.8s] Rockwell Collins and you&#39;re saying I
[5138.199s] wonder if it&#39;s going to work it&#39;s a
[5139.76s] duopoly weekly mortgage demand surges
[5142.28s] 11% higher as interest rates drop for

[5155.28s] Brad Jacobs strikes again let&#39;s go baby
[5158.4s] CEO Brack and darl brings VF corpse
[5161.0s] reinvention back to Wall Street so uh
[5164.28s] that is um Emily Rakowski wearing the
[5167.679s] Northface brand that can&#39;t be a bad
[5170.0s] thing I&#39;ll tell you uh Japan 10-year
[5172.92s] yield at highest since 2008 on bets for
[5176.76s] boj hikes now that&#39;s an interesting
[5181.159s] story uh so yield is the highest since
[5183.719s] 200 and eight but I think what they&#39;re
[5187.48s] also saying
[5189.04s] here is
[5195.84s] that so everyone&#39;s crowded into bets on
[5198.48s] boj Hikes um maybe if that&#39;s becoming
[5201.84s] crowded maybe they&#39;ll delay it a little
[5203.199s] bit which would also create the reprieve
[5205.199s] for the markets to Rally into summer so
[5207.96s] we&#39;ll we&#39;ll keep an eye on that the fact
[5209.719s] that everyone&#39;s crowding now into them
[5211.719s] doing hikes um we&#39;ll see
[5214.76s] Euro on course for best week since 2009
[5217.36s] Euro strong dollar weak same Playbook
[5220.28s] different day stock market and sentiment
[5221.88s] results we went through all the media
[5223.6s] here&#39;s VF Corp ladies and gentlemen you
[5226.239s] know we were just pounding the table
[5228.52s] down here our base is I think
[5231.119s] 5553 across all the accounts shot right
[5233.8s] up to 28 well no didn&#39;t shoot right up
[5236.04s] to 28 it first went against us like it
[5239.08s] always does and then it went doubled uh
[5241.719s] now it&#39;s come back to check back just
[5243.199s] like it does out of a every single cycle
[5245.199s] shoots out fakes everyone out straight
[5247.679s] up shoots out fakes everyone out
[5249.679s] straight up shoots out fakes everyone
[5251.88s] out straight up doing the exact same
[5253.8s] thing here the difference between this
[5255.36s] time and those three times is you got
[5257.04s] Brack and Daryl who created a 26 bagger
[5259.44s] at Logitech after he came in as CEO when
[5262.239s] the stock was down 83% uh there&#39;s a
[5264.6s] theme Here ladies and gentlemen you
[5265.8s] notice what I&#39;m doing here well pay
[5267.96s] attention uh so here&#39;s what you see cash
[5270.56s] flow is down now it&#39;s recovering and he
[5273.159s] just basically laid out the plan that if
[5278.199s] the and and you need to read all of this
[5280.4s] because the number one thing in a in a
[5282.48s] turnaround is solvency risk comes off
[5284.199s] the table they did that by selling uh
[5286.36s] Supreme 1.5 billion paid down
[5290.159s] debt now they&#39;re re
[5293.119s] accelerating and what he basically said
[5295.76s] in investor day and what you could
[5298.04s] extrapolate from that with the cost
[5300.48s] savings with all the initiatives with
[5302.159s] everything else if the revenue didn&#39;t
[5304.32s] grow for the next decade this would
[5306.52s] still be a double uh and what he&#39;s also
[5310.04s] said in this at the same exact time in
[5313.08s] the same exact breath is that he can&#39;t
[5317.28s] he effectively he can&#39;t see a scenario
[5319.8s] where they don&#39;t grow the whole business
[5322.199s] at least double digits and he
[5323.8s] specifically says I&#39;m not here to grow
[5325.239s] anything less than double digits which
[5327.119s] means the operating Leverage is massive
[5330.04s] and while we thought that we would ride
[5332.04s] this thing to 4045 $50 and have our
[5335.199s] double in a in a couple two three years
[5338.32s] um it more likely now looks like we&#39;re
[5341.6s] going to be holding this for a long time
[5342.96s] and this thing&#39;s going to work its way
[5344.159s] back to New highs and then by the way he
[5346.32s] also alluded to the fact not a thing you
[5348.08s] do if you&#39;re in a period of survival
[5349.96s] that we&#39;re going to get back to doing
[5351.08s] what VF Corp has done since the late
[5354.0s] 1800s uh which is uh by hot uh hot brand
[5358.679s] so they&#39;re back in they went from
[5360.679s] survival to stability to now re
[5363.56s] accelerate growth to now re to
[5366.52s] accelerating the growth and and
[5368.08s] expanding again and uh and this thing&#39;s
[5370.679s] just getting started so just bet on
[5372.08s] Bracken all this will tell you why all
[5374.76s] this will go through every detail of
[5376.159s] every plan whether it&#39;s the lady who
[5377.84s] came over from Lululemon who&#39;s going to
[5380.0s] get the women sales in Vans humming
[5382.28s] again uh or all the another other
[5386.4s] initiatives but we will be here until uh
[5390.44s] tomorrow and I got to go on cg10 America
[5393.8s] and a couple hours so go through this at
[5397.159s] at your leisure but the key is this is
[5399.96s] going to be an unbelievable multi-year
[5401.6s] Journey with Brack and
[5403.04s] Daryl and we&#39;re super excited to be a
[5405.4s] part of it the second one that we did
[5408.08s] here this week
[5409.719s] was albam Maro I love Alam Maro
[5414.44s] because the basic theme Here is
[5418.119s] that so you can kind of see the
[5420.08s] long-term view very cyclical business
[5422.239s] and by the way it was this way even
[5423.719s] before for EVS so everyone&#39;s saying oh
[5425.88s] it only depends on EVS yes but liquid
[5429.119s] lithium prices are very cyclical they go
[5431.719s] up and down and what happens is when the
[5434.44s] price is up all these producers
[5436.56s] overproduce and the small ones go out of
[5438.719s] business and the big ones like albam
[5440.76s] Maro just stopped producing waited out
[5442.84s] wait for all their competition to go out
[5444.8s] and then they mint money three L three
[5447.04s] years later when uh the price just
[5451.239s] gallops because there&#39;s no producers
[5453.119s] left and they&#39;re left standing they&#39;ve
[5454.639s] got $3.5 billion of liquidity all their
[5456.84s] competitors are going out of business oh
[5458.36s] and by the way China&#39;s got this
[5460.04s] unnaturally subsidized Market in EVS
[5462.28s] everyone says well no one really wants
[5463.6s] EVS in America anymore it doesn&#39;t matter
[5465.92s] everyone in China is going to be forced
[5467.4s] to drive EVS they got you know 40
[5469.52s] million Global stock is going to be 120
[5471.36s] million Global stock by 2027 2028 that&#39;s
[5474.36s] all driven by China forced unnatural
[5477.32s] subsidized markets uh don&#39;t hate the
[5479.44s] player hate the game I mean if if that&#39;s
[5481.76s] what they&#39;re going to do and that&#39;s what
[5482.84s] they&#39;re telling you what they&#39;re going
[5483.639s] to do how do you best position for oh
[5485.4s] yeah you can go figure out is it going
[5487.04s] to be Neo is it going to be byd is it
[5489.32s] going to be Tesla or you can just be the
[5491.639s] Arms Dealer and uh buy the lithium
[5494.32s] producer the best one that has all the
[5496.639s] liquidity to wait this out if it&#39;s
[5498.199s] another year great if if we&#39;re already
[5500.159s] there this thing goes straight up from
[5501.56s] 75 to 200 plus 300 plus uh and you don&#39;t
[5505.56s] have to think about it you don&#39;t have to
[5506.719s] lose sleep about it I mean it&#39;s some
[5509.159s] things are just you
[5510.92s] know some things are just too easy it it
[5513.52s] really is I mean I guess for most people
[5516.199s] it&#39;s hard to sit through the bottoming
[5518.159s] process I guess that&#39;s what makes it
[5519.56s] hard or they don&#39;t read and do the work
[5522.04s] but like okay so yeah I guess this is
[5523.84s] hard a bottom so what was the price
[5526.159s] volatility here in the last bottom so it
[5528.159s] got as low as 46 and it got as high as
[5532.119s] uh 80 so that&#39;s a lot of volatility for
[5535.44s] a lot of people if they if they bought
[5537.0s] at 80 and it dropped to 46 they&#39;re
[5539.04s] they&#39;re you know and they&#39;re on Leverage
[5540.679s] but if they just said wait a second I
[5542.52s] know what I own here I know what the
[5544.48s] Cycle&#39;s like so let&#39;s say they bought at
[5546.56s] 80 it went draw down against them to 45
[5549.04s] oh my God it&#39;s going against me well if
[5550.84s] you&#39;re not on Leverage you don&#39;t care
[5552.32s] because you know what you own and then
[5553.6s] it went up to $326 in the next two years
[5556.679s] so you made a four bagger on your 80 if
[5559.159s] you if you if you bought more down and
[5561.0s] you brought your basis down to 60 you
[5562.679s] made a five or six bagger uh and uh and
[5565.96s] life goes on you know the same thing in
[5567.56s] 2009 the same thing in 2000 and more
[5570.4s] likely than not it&#39;ll be the same thing
[5572.719s] now and um but most people can&#39;t handle
[5575.92s] the volatility so let&#39;s take a look at
[5577.239s] this base it got as low as
[5578.96s] 71 shot up to 100 back to 71 what&#39;s our
[5583.159s] basis on
[5588.28s] this
[5589.96s] 8834 oh we&#39;re stupid people oh we bought
[5593.159s] it 88 and now it&#39;s 71 hm maybe we should
[5598.44s] sell in the Hole uh how about every new
[5602.28s] penny that we have available to put to
[5603.84s] work we&#39;ll buy more and that makes more
[5605.719s] sense to me because when it&#39;s 300 again
[5607.719s] we&#39;re going to be glad that we&#39;re
[5609.239s] bringing our basis down
[5612.4s] from 8834 to hopefully 77 when all is
[5617.239s] said and done that&#39;s how he do it on to
[5620.0s] the next uh here is
[5627.76s] sentiment all right so here&#39;s all the
[5629.639s] reasons why yada Y yty and by the way
[5632.76s] the reason I have conviction is because
[5634.0s] I know every single word that&#39;s here
[5635.8s] okay so you say oh I could just look at
[5637.88s] a chart and buy some yeah then that&#39;s
[5640.0s] why you&#39;re going to be selling in the
[5641.0s] hole because you don&#39;t know why you own
[5642.32s] it and you don&#39;t know what you own uh
[5644.28s] and that&#39;s why I&#39;m buying in the hole
[5645.679s] because I do all this work and I know
[5648.0s] every little nook and cranny about every
[5650.28s] aspect of the business and their
[5651.48s] competitors and everything else and
[5652.96s] that&#39;s why I can have conviction and
[5654.36s] that&#39;s why I make this look easy even
[5657.36s] though I guess it&#39;s not I don&#39;t know I
[5659.8s] never feel like I&#39;m working so it feels
[5661.32s] easy but um it&#39;s a lot of work
[5664.239s] I mean if you wanted to find out as work
[5666.56s] I I kind of feel like it&#39;s a treasure
[5668.199s] hunt but uh so that&#39;s that sentiments
[5671.159s] washed out we know that earnings
[5674.04s] Industrials remember we are in
[5676.04s] sandbagger season that&#39;s what they do
[5677.84s] every year but let&#39;s see what
[5679.08s] Industrials did they took them down 2%
[5681.119s] for this year uh exploration and
[5684.28s] production these have stopped going down
[5686.4s] they were going down double digits for a
[5687.719s] while now they&#39;re going down 1.8 I
[5690.52s] mean look I&#39;ll be honest I&#39;m probably
[5692.6s] going to do nothing with it I was
[5693.96s] looking at
[5696.52s] halberton uh HP helwick and pain
[5699.719s] whatever they&#39;re called and Murphy Oil
[5703.159s] today they&#39;re starting to look super
[5705.239s] interesting I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to
[5706.84s] do anything with any of them because we
[5708.32s] love our com stock resources we have
[5709.92s] enough exposure but we might and if we
[5712.119s] do it&#39;s going to be in the serer space
[5714.32s] and I think it&#39;s kind of ready Insider
[5716.4s] buying and selling these there&#39;s a
[5717.679s] material stock Chemical stock we love
[5719.6s] that
[5721.08s] space uh but we have our exposure
[5724.0s] through Alam Maro we&#39;re happy with
[5726.52s] that so you saw the CPI numbers came in
[5729.88s] better than expected the PPI numbers
[5733.84s] core PPI and PPI both came in a lot
[5737.36s] better than expected so again that puts
[5739.76s] the fed put back in play earnings growth
[5742.08s] for this quarter is expected to be
[5743.88s] 7.3% you know the negative GDP noise
[5747.32s] there&#39;s a lot of noise around
[5748.56s] inventories related to frontloading of
[5750.48s] tariffs in the fourth quarter and some
[5752.84s] of the uh
[5755.36s] um Long Beach um people uh importing
[5761.199s] stuff I can&#39;t even think of what it is
[5764.6s] where trucks go in not trucks
[5767.08s] boats uh docks anyway there was a rush
[5769.96s] to get a lot of goods in so it might
[5771.76s] have pulled forward so you might see a
[5773.159s] weak print in q1 but when I I look at
[5776.48s] these
[5778.56s] earnings
[5779.6s] [Music]
[5782.239s] um and even estimates as much as they&#39;ve
[5784.96s] come down it&#39;s still at 271 they only
[5787.44s] took it down $4 from 275 and this is
[5791.08s] supposed to be the time of year when
[5792.159s] they take it down a lot more and then
[5793.36s] they beat like crazy all year so and
[5795.4s] then they took next year up the backend
[5797.44s] load they took it up higher so uh I
[5800.32s] don&#39;t I don&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna I don&#39;t
[5801.84s] I know the Atlanta GDP says that we&#39;re
[5803.48s] going to get a negative print I don&#39;t
[5805.84s] know if that&#39;s going to be the case
[5807.159s] because they haven&#39;t been super accurate
[5809.119s] let&#39;s see what the FED funds Futures we
[5812.08s] talking about today as it relates to a
[5814.119s] June
[5815.28s] cut uh just want to see if this is still
[5818.44s] at
[5821.84s] 90%
[5823.56s] June
[5825.6s] 89% is May on the table now no May is a
[5830.28s] 211% and what about March 9 next
[5833.679s] week There&#39;s a 2% chance so you&#39;re
[5836.96s] saying there&#39;s a chance uh very unlikely
[5840.0s] but we could see a change in the doish
[5842.119s] rhetorics so leave leaving that aside uh
[5845.36s] we&#39;re done with the podcast for everyone
[5847.4s] who likes to stick around for the ask me
[5849.92s] anything questions which come from our
[5852.56s] listening studio audience which we&#39;re
[5855.44s] excited to cover each week we&#39;ve got an
[5857.04s] awful lot this week so we&#39;re going to go
[5858.76s] through them at some point in time we&#39;re
[5860.44s] going to have to be more selective
[5861.679s] because we&#39;re just getting so many now
[5863.52s] but we&#39;ll continue to try to do every
[5865.199s] single question we can and uh for those
[5867.88s] of you who don&#39;t stick around for the
[5869.36s] ask me anything questions we&#39;ll be back
[5871.48s] next week for the most amazing podcast
[5873.52s] of all time with the CEO of Cooper
[5876.119s] standard and we uh will be having more
[5878.599s] of those in the pipe with different CEOs
[5881.04s] moving forward but uh tomorrow the next
[5883.96s] week&#39;s going to be super special and for
[5885.44s] those of you who do get a lot of value
[5886.92s] from the ask me anything questions here
[5888.84s] we go first one&#39;s from Johnny Selenas
[5891.159s] good afternoon Tom was scanning through
[5892.56s] some charts what do you think about
[5894.4s] Blackline down here uh I they&#39;re like a
[5898.199s] software me too company I&#39;ve never been
[5900.36s] able to understand what their mode is so
[5903.32s] uh um as cheap as they are and as
[5907.36s] attractive as they look let me just take
[5909.679s] a look at their financials here I mean
[5913.28s] if their financials are okay maybe I&#39;ll
[5915.04s] spend some time trying to figure out why
[5917.199s] anyone can&#39;t just copy and replicate
[5919.0s] their software I mean look at this look
[5921.76s] at this cash
[5924.48s] generation margins are going down a
[5926.599s] little bit not good in that type of
[5928.199s] business but uh this is this is
[5931.599s] definitely worth looking at
[5934.0s] I mean this is one of those 2021
[5936.04s] Darlings that got
[5937.88s] overbid and
[5941.239s] now let&#39;s see how many slices are in the
[5943.56s] pie revenues are still growing although
[5945.639s] at a slower rate so that&#39;s not good for
[5947.52s] bro that&#39;s a broken growth stock right
[5950.0s] there what did they do with the shares
[5952.32s] as the stock
[5953.96s] fell uh they increased them a little bit
[5956.4s] they&#39;re probably paying themselves a lot
[5957.8s] of money uh in options and so on but on
[5961.32s] balance it&#39;s not terrible uh let&#39;s see
[5965.8s] here uh balance sheet my guess is they
[5968.92s] have no debt they got 800 million of
[5972.599s] cash 800 million of debt that&#39;s fine
[5975.44s] let&#39;s take a look at cash
[5979.0s] flow uh cash from
[5982.36s] operations
[5983.95s] [Music]
[5985.56s] growing free cash flow good all right
[5989.88s] let me tell me more about this amazing
[5993.719s] software you

[6039.76s] switching to something cheaper be
[6041.159s] interested to know uh and this one is
[6043.76s] definitely worth doing more work on so
[6045.56s] Johnny Selenas uh hard
[6048.679s] maybe uh Joe Ramen
[6056.719s] thanks for all you do by the way my
[6058.52s] daughters love your noodles uh love your
[6061.679s] I&#39;m kidding love your podcast I am close
[6063.8s] to having enough to be a client in the
[6065.199s] next one to two years all right we will
[6067.08s] be here I&#39;m curious about what you think
[6069.04s] about Trump&#39;s executive orders regarding
[6070.52s] us investment in China related to
[6072.36s] investing in Baba uh do you invest in
[6074.639s] adrs or buy your contact shares on the
[6076.639s] Hong Kong market we&#39;ve done both when
[6078.92s] the fear of delisting was acute we did
[6081.8s] some 9988 once it was relieved after the
[6085.84s] pcaob decision we opted for um the
[6091.32s] baba um look we have three key filters
[6097.0s] in any investment number one is if JP
[6101.08s] Morgan was going to finance us to buy
[6104.28s] 100% of the company the only caveat was
[6107.199s] I had to put up 100% of my net worth as
[6109.239s] the equity they would be the debt if it
[6113.48s] worked I made insane multiples on My
[6115.76s] Equity if it didn&#39;t work I&#39;m wiped out
[6117.679s] completely and JP Morgan gets the
[6119.36s] business uh would I do the deal uh on a
[6122.92s] numbers basis with Alibaba I would do
[6125.239s] the deal 100% uh on the country risk and
[6128.52s] government risk particularly when it was
[6130.04s] looking really dark uh you can&#39;t do that
[6132.76s] but what you can do
[6136.88s] is pass filter number two which was and
[6140.76s] this was the filter I had to run in my
[6142.119s] head every single day during the darkest
[6143.84s] times in the last year and two years if
[6146.76s] this position were to go to zero would
[6150.239s] they take me out on a stretcher and if
[6152.119s] the answer is yes then either I don&#39;t go
[6155.04s] into the position or I go in a position
[6157.92s] size risk management that although it&#39;s
[6161.32s] heavy and big and our largest position
[6164.96s] uh if it were to go to zero because
[6166.88s] there could always be something that you
[6168.599s] don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know uh that
[6170.88s] you can&#39;t control in any position
[6173.199s] position that you&#39;re in
[6176.159s] um and once I got that down to a size
[6178.96s] where I could make a lot of money if I
[6180.36s] was right but not get carried out on a
[6182.28s] stretcher and all that means is yes it
[6184.239s] would hurt if it went to zero but I have
[6186.719s] enough other good positions in enough
[6189.159s] size that I could still outperform even
[6192.36s] with that one sleeve going to zero and
[6195.44s] live another day then I could live with
[6196.88s] it and that&#39;s why I was able to lean the
[6198.119s] hell in when it dropped to 60 and back
[6199.88s] up the truck number one a lot of the
[6201.56s] other positions had gone off and bought
[6203.199s] me the luxury to do that like Google
[6205.96s] like Amazon like many Rolls-Royce like
[6208.679s] many others that were home runs uh like
[6211.679s] Vado uh so that afforded me the ability
[6214.48s] to do that but um you can&#39;t guard
[6219.119s] against it so what you have to do is say
[6221.8s] is how is this sized in my portfolio and
[6223.84s] if you&#39;re a cowboy and you say well it&#39;s
[6225.599s] the best thing at the best price and you
[6227.639s] just say I hope it works out and you put
[6229.599s] 100% you deserve to die I mean that&#39;s
[6233.52s] die Mr Bond you know I mean what what
[6235.639s] else could I tell you so yeah there&#39;s
[6237.239s] always a risk and and if it&#39;s not that
[6239.0s] on Baba it&#39;s something else on something
[6241.48s] else so uh that&#39;s that&#39;s the beauty like
[6244.639s] I say here every week they don&#39;t give
[6246.36s] away multi-baggers for free you know so
[6248.96s] what what you can do is manage what you
[6251.32s] can control not what you can&#39;t control
[6254.32s] and yeah I love I love to lean in in
[6256.36s] size and it&#39;s and it is our biggest
[6257.92s] position but I always had in the back of
[6260.119s] my
[6261.32s] mind that you have
[6263.56s] real risk it could go to zero so what
[6266.32s] does the rest of the portfolio look like
[6267.84s] in that situation and I was very
[6269.28s] comfortable and all those other stocks
[6271.56s] performed in the way that I needed them
[6273.04s] to to buy me that luxury to do what I
[6275.44s] wanted to do on a numbers basis despite
[6277.56s] the Black Swan risk and that&#39;s the only
[6279.28s] way you can think about it so yeah Trump
[6281.119s] could wake up tomorrow and tweet
[6282.28s] something crazy and uh and that could
[6285.0s] happen and that could happen with any
[6286.239s] company whether it&#39;s coer standard
[6287.8s] whether it&#39;s Genera whether it&#39;s General
[6290.44s] Motors which we don&#39;t own thank God uh
[6293.239s] um and that&#39;s the way it goes so uh
[6296.32s] that&#39;s how you manage around it Chris
[6298.159s] Williams there are there are no short
[6299.92s] things and that that the the framework
[6302.599s] that you&#39;re operating from is incorrect
[6304.4s] because if you have the view that there
[6307.159s] should be a sh thing then you&#39;re a
[6309.44s] cowboy and then you&#39;re going to gamble
[6311.28s] all of it in one and hope that you get
[6313.199s] rich overnight and everyone that goes
[6314.92s] for that winds up getting broke and the
[6316.639s] ones that do get rich overnight let me
[6318.4s] give you a little secret they give it
[6319.84s] all back to the casino Okay so
[6323.92s] create a durable thoughtful framework
[6326.92s] that not only will um keep you out of
[6330.4s] the stretcher but allow you to compound
[6333.36s] money above Trend meaningfully regularly
[6336.28s] and sleep well over time and then the
[6338.639s] other uh filters were if I were to walk
[6342.32s] into the board of directors and offer to
[6344.32s] take the entire company myself at the
[6347.04s] price it was quoted in the market would
[6349.239s] they call security to have me escorted
[6351.36s] out of the room the answer must be yes
[6354.119s] the price the margin of safety has to be
[6356.119s] so great that if I was to actually offer
[6358.44s] to buy the whole company the board would
[6360.52s] have me removed from the building
[6361.96s] because it was an unbelievably
[6364.56s] disrespectful um insulting offer and
[6368.96s] that&#39;s where I like to buy stocks in the
[6370.56s] public markets that will never exist in
[6372.239s] the private markets I can&#39;t tell you how
[6374.08s] many people come to me with private
[6375.52s] Market deals every single day and I say
[6378.08s] no number one I have an obligation I
[6380.159s] invest all of my money alongside with
[6381.8s] clients I eat my own C cooking so that&#39;s
[6383.52s] rule number one for me rule number two I
[6385.76s] like to sleep at night and rule number
[6387.84s] and number three I have control over the
[6389.56s] investment so I know what I&#39;m buying uh
[6391.679s] and number four I don&#39;t have the fomo
[6393.199s] gene yeah I&#39;ll miss some privates that
[6394.92s] wind up being 50 Baggers I could care
[6396.719s] less because all those deal junkies they
[6398.88s] take their 50 Baggers and they put them
[6400.56s] in 10 or 15 uh subpar deals and 14 of
[6404.52s] them go out and they lose 90% of their
[6406.32s] 50 bagger gain and then they wind up you
[6408.92s] know starting from a much smaller base
[6410.48s] finding a sensible manager that can
[6412.119s] compound it regular
[6413.44s] it&#39;s I&#39;ve just seen it over and over
[6415.119s] okay
[6415.96s] so uh that&#39;s that that&#39;s how I live my
[6418.96s] life very simple I only eat one
[6420.239s] cheeseburger a day I don&#39;t need 10 uh I
[6422.8s] can have anything I want I don&#39;t need
[6424.44s] any of that if I&#39;ve got an internet
[6425.679s] connection in a room I&#39;m a happy camper
[6427.36s] and a golf club in the afternoon uh good
[6430.119s] on that so uh what was curious what your
[6433.44s] thoughts are on aircap
[6435.44s] CEO saying if Boeing aircraft will go up
[6438.679s] by 40 million and every country besides
[6441.44s] us will be forced to go to
[6443.44s] Airbus
[6445.04s] uh go go ahead uh airc cap go to Airbus
[6449.599s] have fun you can get your next plane in
[6451.36s] 25 years it&#39;s the dumbest thing I&#39;ve
[6453.48s] ever heard and as you said sounds like a
[6456.0s] load of nonsense you answered your own
[6457.8s] question uh but fair point for pointing
[6461.159s] it out and thanks for listening in Ben
[6462.88s] first name only thank you for your
[6464.88s] weekly podcast was wondering why the
[6466.48s] stock market went down on Tuesday I I
[6469.36s] thought you thought I thought you said
[6470.92s] you thought it would go up this week
[6473.639s] Ben I don&#39;t give a if it goes up or
[6475.8s] down in the next two days or week or
[6477.96s] week and a half uh that&#39;s not the game
[6480.239s] I&#39;m in I hope it goes down for the next
[6482.08s] two weeks do I think we&#39;re going to
[6483.52s] bounce here and start to Rally into the
[6485.44s] summer I do think so and I think it&#39;s
[6487.159s] going to start imminently if if it&#39;s if
[6488.96s] it&#39;s not last week and it&#39;s not this
[6490.88s] week maybe it&#39;s next week maybe it&#39;s the
[6492.639s] week I I don&#39;t give two shits what I do
[6495.52s] care about is it created the opportunity
[6497.92s] to buy more of phenomenal business the
[6500.119s] problem is is our businesses for the
[6502.119s] most part didn&#39;t go down enough where I
[6503.84s] felt like a fear of loss why don&#39;t I
[6506.4s] have more available Capital to put to
[6508.48s] work it&#39;s like they&#39;re kind of just
[6509.76s] hanging around churning around while the
[6511.76s] while Tech gets smashed and then they&#39;ll
[6513.76s] go back up so I&#39;m just sitting here
[6515.679s] waiting and watching and where I have
[6517.36s] some new money come in I put more to
[6519.44s] work at lower prices and uh and then
[6521.52s] it&#39;ll rip up and won&#39;t allow anyone in
[6524.4s] and everyone will be like oh what
[6525.84s] happened and then they&#39;ll all want to
[6526.96s] buy in July when we&#39;re actually taking
[6529.119s] off a couple of positions and finding
[6530.639s] two brand new positions to replace them
[6532.44s] cuz they&#39;re at full value um so uh
[6536.239s] welcome to the podcast I can assume by
[6538.719s] the nature of your question you&#39;re brand
[6540.679s] new uh Niche Patel Tom been listening to
[6545.04s] you for over a year thank you for all
[6546.239s] the great information you give what are
[6547.28s] your thoughts on
[6548.4s] TTD seems to fall very uh seems very
[6552.119s] oversold leader in the sector didn&#39;t
[6554.56s] have really bad earnings looks to be a
[6556.239s] buying opportunity uh we covered this
[6557.96s] one a couple weeks ago I said
[6560.48s] no let me take a look at it again
[6565.48s] yeah this is a broken Momo stock uh call
[6569.52s] me up again if it goes to like
[6571.8s] 40 um I don&#39;t like these things these
[6575.4s] are momo stocks that get broken maybe
[6577.44s] they bounce dead cat bounces but um I
[6580.44s] like businesses that have been around
[6581.719s] for decades that I can just see how they
[6583.48s] operate through Cycles this stuff is
[6585.0s] like guessing for me and I don&#39;t like to
[6587.48s] guess I like to earn
[6590.159s] so uh
[6594.0s] let&#39;s just look at the cash flow so
[6595.28s] maybe I can save us some
[6602.08s] time yeah it&#39;s generating a boatload of
[6607.36s] cash GH
[6624.0s] wow all right revenues
[6630.199s] growing income
[6632.92s] statement let&#39;s see what they did with
[6634.88s] the share
[6638.8s] count not
[6642.48s] terrible uh what is this this is that ad
[6645.36s] serving
[6649.079s] business yeah self-service cloud-based
[6651.84s] ad buying platform form optimize data
[6654.84s] driven very trade
[6666.199s] desk all right 30
[6674.4s] times all right I think this is going
[6676.76s] lower but it&#39;s ah I&#39;ll take a look at it
[6681.079s] it&#39;s kind of interesting but I I
[6683.119s] guarantee you I&#39;m gonna do nothing with
[6684.639s] this one I I it&#39;s just not the thing I
[6687.639s] do I I stick to what I&#39;m good at this is
[6689.48s] not something I&#39;m good at Griffin Brown
[6692.0s] uh hi Tom 23y old kid here recently
[6694.159s] gotten into investing stock analysis
[6695.599s] found your podcast a few months haven&#39;t
[6697.159s] missed an episode since thank you
[6699.36s] welcome tell your friends Griffin
[6701.159s] awesome
[6702.119s] stuff um when you receive a stock idea
[6705.44s] what do you immediately look to determin
[6707.0s] validity yeah uh two things it it seems
[6710.599s] like I&#39;m answering in one minute but
[6712.199s] behind that one minute is 20 some odd
[6714.159s] years of experience so like I&#39;ve seen it
[6716.0s] all or at least most of it and I just
[6718.92s] know the nature of certain types of
[6720.639s] businesses that I avoid and the nature
[6722.52s] of certain types of businesses that I
[6723.92s] get interested in but then I&#39;m looking
[6725.719s] at solvency risk is number one if the
[6727.56s] socks down a lot is the balance sheet
[6729.199s] good does it generate enough cash how
[6731.8s] has it operated through past Cycles uh
[6734.599s] are they keeping the share count
[6735.92s] relative then I might look at some
[6737.36s] multiples just enough to determine
[6739.44s] whether I want whether the margin of
[6740.96s] safety is large enough that I actually
[6742.28s] want to spend the next three weeks
[6744.4s] digging into it and its compet
[6746.32s] competition or not and that&#39;s usually a
[6748.639s] good starting point uh Chris Patterson
[6752.52s] given albam Maro significant reduction
[6754.159s] in cap back uh how do you see the impact
[6757.199s] on company&#39;s long-term growth prospects
[6759.52s] expanding lithium capacity to meet
[6761.239s] future demand uh I see that they do this
[6763.8s] every single cycle since they&#39;ve existed
[6766.88s] that
[6767.679s] basically the small players come in when
[6769.96s] the price of lithium goes up at the top
[6773.04s] excess capacity comes on board they
[6775.04s] flood the market the little guys uh go
[6777.84s] out of business because they can&#39;t stay
[6779.639s] afloat at at as prices collapse
[6782.199s] companies like albam Maro they have
[6784.0s] ample liquidity as one of the largest
[6785.56s] lithium providers in the world and they
[6787.719s] just waited out till their competition
[6789.239s] goes out of business supply comes
[6790.679s] offline demand continues or or or
[6794.079s] returns and then they&#39;re the only game
[6796.079s] in town on the way up and they mint
[6797.56s] money and then you get out at the top
[6799.679s] when all the new entrance come in uh
[6801.84s] like every time Dustin D appreciated any
[6805.679s] guidance on best places to learn more
[6807.76s] about value at risk or risk adjusted
[6809.52s] portfolio allocation strategies uh
[6811.719s] Dustin that&#39;s a load of um
[6814.04s] basically you want to underwrite each
[6816.679s] individual position as if you were
[6818.159s] buying the entire company and if you&#39;re
[6820.4s] lucky you&#39;ll be able to find eight to 12
[6822.36s] of those that you want to own at a
[6824.199s] particular time uh but you should assume
[6827.599s] and treat each one as if you have 100%
[6829.719s] of your net worth tied up in the equity
[6831.88s] and if you&#39;re wrong you&#39;re wiped out and
[6834.0s] then on that basis you underwrite 8 to
[6836.76s] 12 individual uncorrelated risks uh
[6840.44s] discreet from V which measures against
[6844.239s] an index or some other
[6846.48s] consultant metric that&#39;s never going to
[6848.0s] make you any money so uh I will uh leave
[6851.719s] that there nice question uh Hayes W okay
[6856.639s] are you hope you&#39;re doing well thank you
[6858.48s] for your time and energy making the
[6860.04s] podcast greatly appreciated by many
[6861.52s] myself included you&#39;re welcome thank you
[6863.36s] Johnson Outdoors uh quality portfolio of
[6865.92s] outdoor recreation
[6868.48s] Brands low debt beating down all right
[6872.239s] I&#39;ll take a look I don&#39;t like this
[6874.0s] Recreation business like the uh Malibu
[6877.48s] Boats and the uh all this other stuff
[6880.719s] but I&#39;ll take a look they&#39;re all going
[6882.56s] to bounce Leslie&#39;s out um there&#39;s
[6885.719s] there&#39;s a lot of them I think they&#39;re
[6887.84s] going to start working yeah this looks
[6891.0s] interesting j o
[6897.0s] UT so no one wants this stuff right now
[6899.679s] because it&#39;s consumer discretionary and
[6901.119s] for five minutes consumer sentiment is
[6903.28s] down because of the tariffs once that&#39;s
[6905.04s] resolved like every four years all right
[6907.44s] so cash flow starting to recover
[6908.92s] revenues are still down margins are
[6911.679s] collapsing so you just have to kind of
[6914.119s] get a sense of how they operate through
[6917.159s] each
[6918.679s] cycle and what&#39;s their turnaround plan
[6921.32s] do they have a decent boun balance
[6924.159s] sheet let&#39;s take a look at the balance
[6926.4s] sheet if they can if they have enough
[6929.36s] Runway 162 million and the debt is zero
[6935.599s] so that&#39;s a good
[6938.599s] start you just have
[6941.0s] leases let&#39;s take a look at their cash
[6943.36s] flow
[6955.04s] so
[6956.36s] so uh let&#39;s take a look at
[6960.52s] this wow so they really Peak during Co
[6963.0s] so their revenues are like back down to
[6964.679s] preco
[6967.8s] levels what&#39;s their share count doing
[6975.639s] here they&#39;ve they&#39;ve done okay with the
[6977.84s] share count so look they&#39;re in a hard
[6980.56s] spot you got to understand turnaround
[6983.52s] story I&#39;d probably get more interested
[6986.0s] in yeah I mean it probably
[6988.239s] goes I would I mean around 20 it would
[6991.0s] be get interesed but this is a really
[6992.48s] broken stock so it may take a while to
[6995.36s] recover um but I think it will and I
[6998.88s] just don&#39;t like this type of business
[7000.199s] but I think you&#39;re going to be right and
[7001.639s] I think it&#39;s it&#39;s generally okay if you
[7003.8s] can get comfort with their plan for
[7005.56s] turnaround not not make sure it&#39;s
[7007.84s] cyclical and not secular is what I&#39;m
[7009.32s] telling you are those brands are any of
[7010.92s] those Brands dead or they&#39;re just going
[7012.719s] to you know bounce back like Vans and
[7014.84s] and different things that have been
[7015.8s] around for 60 years Lee Foster love your
[7018.52s] pod is such a tree tape Friday I watch
[7020.28s] while working from home on Fridays can I
[7022.84s] ask your opinion on the B Canadian
[7025.079s] movement and if it will have any
[7026.84s] material upside for Canada Goose and
[7028.84s] potentially outweigh tariff concerns
[7032.88s] um seems a bit oversold to me look
[7037.32s] Goose&#39;s recovery is mostly about China
[7039.719s] so I&#39;m not really I mean yeah it needs
[7044.04s] America it needs all that stuff but
[7045.679s] again that&#39;s stuff not stuff you can
[7047.36s] control by Canadian is
[7049.679s] irrelevant uh because if your econom is
[7052.719s] weak your Canadians aren&#39;t going to have
[7054.159s] any money to spend I think it&#39;s going to
[7055.599s] get resolved with the new prime minister
[7058.119s] and um if not you&#39;ll you know we welcome
[7060.92s] you as the 51st state and Wayne Gretzky
[7062.88s] will be a great Governor so I&#39;m I&#39;m
[7065.679s] joking not joking uh but I think it&#39;s
[7068.8s] going to go better than you guys
[7069.92s] anticipate and it has really Limited
[7072.199s] bearing on the small position we have in
[7075.0s] Goose which we hope to make a much
[7076.599s] larger position soon
[7080.0s] um really enjoy the podcast you have
[7082.8s] great understanding and opinion on
[7084.96s] market trends as well as individual
[7086.4s] stocks thank you was
[7089.719s] wondering used to your I&#39;m used to okay
[7092.96s] when when when did it when did it not
[7094.84s] work I&#39;m used to all of your analysis
[7096.32s] coming
[7097.199s] true uh want to know how you handle
[7099.76s] times that uh I mean my biggest mistakes
[7102.44s] are generally timing and I&#39;ll just cover
[7104.56s] this I I&#39;ll tell you like range
[7107.04s] resources is a good example uh we bought
[7109.88s] at
[7111.04s] $11 it immediately shot up in 2018 it
[7114.44s] immediately shot up to 18 we thought we
[7116.239s] were geniuses then Co came and it
[7119.079s] crashed down to 160 we bought like crazy
[7122.76s] brought our basis down to 410 so we just
[7125.719s] you know it&#39;s a huge markdown short term
[7128.56s] it enabled us to like quadruple the
[7131.079s] position size
[7132.8s] uh and then ride it and why did we have
[7134.36s] confidence to do that when everyone else
[7135.96s] was bailing out is pretty simple because
[7138.96s] while they have to report 10y year
[7140.32s] approved reserves to the
[7141.84s] SEC uh we did an analysis of the
[7144.639s] unproved reserves and we figured it was
[7146.719s] worth you know somewhere around $60 and
[7150.199s] so like would we have liked it to bottom
[7153.239s] at 11 and then go to 60 yes uh would we
[7157.32s] have liked it to go but it worked out
[7159.84s] for the best because we were able to
[7161.239s] hugely increase the size of the position
[7163.52s] and now ride it all the way up and we
[7165.0s] think we still have juice left in this
[7166.599s] so um the main thing is if you
[7169.199s] underwrite it
[7171.239s] properly um the only thing that&#39;s going
[7173.32s] to cost the where you can lose is it
[7176.32s] takes longer than you expect and that&#39;s
[7178.719s] why you got to have you know more than
[7180.52s] one position you know uh we talked about
[7182.76s] Charlie munger&#39;s byd okay and
[7186.239s] byd was a disaster okay so he bought it
[7189.88s] in 2009 up here somewhere then you had a
[7192.92s] draw down from 10 to 5 so 50% draw down
[7195.92s] so you lost three years use of money and
[7199.079s] you were down
[7200.52s] 50% uh if you followed uh Munger into
[7203.88s] that oh that&#39;s boy gaming where&#39;s
[7208.159s] byddy there we go the Chinese uh
[7210.84s] electric company so you brought it up
[7212.88s] here in 2009 or wherever it was 20 down
[7215.44s] to two so 90% draw down then uh I don&#39;t
[7218.8s] know whether they added in the hole or
[7220.32s] not but they they held on to it for for
[7222.119s] sure and it basically did nothing for 10
[7225.44s] years and then uh you had a 10 bagger in
[7228.92s] 12 months so you know over that time if
[7232.92s] they&#39;ve got a you know average basis of
[7235.32s] five 10 bucks and they wind up with an
[7237.8s] eight
[7239.04s] bagger uh the irr is pretty damn good
[7241.52s] 800% in 12 years so um because he knew
[7245.52s] what he owned and he was betting on the
[7246.84s] jockey and the whole thing so I think
[7248.599s] the biggest once you learn how to
[7250.079s] underwrite a business and avoid the ones
[7252.92s] that you wouldn&#39;t put 100% of your net
[7254.44s] work worth in either because you don&#39;t
[7256.199s] have confidence because you haven&#39;t done
[7257.44s] enough work or you don&#39;t have confidence
[7259.119s] because it&#39;s not a good enough business
[7261.32s] uh and you ignore the ones that are
[7263.8s] going to be good trades just because you
[7265.719s] think the price is going to go up and
[7266.96s] you may prove to be right who gives a
[7268.84s] the question is is it a good enough
[7270.92s] business that you would stake the whole
[7272.56s] Ranch on it and that&#39;s what you want to
[7274.679s] make a portfolio out of and then and be
[7276.8s] humble enough to know that you can&#39;t
[7278.159s] know everything I couldn&#39;t predict that
[7280.159s] Co was going to come and crash it from a
[7281.92s] 11 down to $160 something but I did know
[7286.719s] that the intrinsic value was still there
[7288.36s] and it gave me an opportunity to get
[7289.639s] four times the position than I would
[7291.0s] have had if it went perfectly so that&#39;s
[7292.96s] how you got to manage it you got to do
[7294.199s] the work upfront is what it comes down
[7296.4s] to the work upfront uh J and and and if
[7299.8s] you really have to be in a position that
[7303.48s] you don&#39;t have 100% certainty of but you
[7305.88s] like the risk reward then you got to
[7307.079s] just manage around you know usually
[7308.719s] those have an expected value of 10x you
[7311.079s] just got to side the position down and
[7313.0s] assume it&#39;s like an option position and
[7314.639s] it&#39;s a two or 3% position if it goes to
[7317.44s] zero you you accounted for that by the
[7322.159s] sizing so if it worked it would add 20
[7325.239s] you know 2,000 basis points or 20% of
[7327.96s] excess contribution but if it didn&#39;t
[7330.159s] work you lost 200 basis points and
[7332.48s] that&#39;s probably a reasonable risk if
[7335.52s] it&#39;s well underwritten knowing that you
[7338.119s] can only have an EV of 10 if there&#39;s a
[7340.239s] possibility of a zero
[7343.239s] um but I wouldn&#39;t take many of those
[7345.48s] that&#39;s for damn sure I would take them
[7347.199s] very very selectively and very rarely
[7349.199s] because I generally don&#39;t want to put
[7350.599s] any money to work if I can&#39;t make it a
[7352.119s] real position of you know 7 8 10 12 in
[7355.56s] some cases as high as 20% but that&#39;s
[7358.0s] only happened once or twice in a career
[7360.639s] um we&#39;re talking covid when uh you know
[7363.76s] Exxon was trading at $33 and Wells Fargo
[7366.52s] was trading at $25 I mean those are
[7368.84s] times when you got a you know when it&#39;s
[7370.52s] when it&#39;s raining gold you got to pull
[7372.639s] out the bucket not the thimble um and
[7375.599s] Baba you know so um so that&#39;s that JT
[7380.44s] investor uh you shared thoughts on Tesla
[7382.84s] in the past do you think the extreme
[7384.4s] negative sentiment has created an
[7385.76s] attractive entry point finally on this
[7387.159s] stock seems like a long-term growth
[7388.44s] thesis is still intact political bias
[7390.52s] Weighing on the stock at this time could
[7392.04s] be a temporary overhang what are your
[7393.719s] thoughts look I would never I I never
[7397.199s] have bet for or against Elon Musk and
[7401.88s] never will bet uh I I won&#39;t say I&#39;ll
[7404.599s] never bet for him because uh I I may but
[7409.239s] uh as a car company this thing&#39;s way
[7411.88s] overvalued and their deliveries are
[7413.28s] going down so you&#39;re making a bet that
[7415.44s] what he&#39;s been promising for years and
[7416.96s] not yet delivered full
[7418.96s] self-driving Auto
[7421.599s] um uh automated robots and Robo taxis he
[7425.679s] delivers all of them and I wouldn&#39;t bet
[7427.639s] against that
[7429.8s] um I can&#39;t value it so I just avoid it
[7432.92s] it&#39;s like I again I don&#39;t have the fomo
[7435.28s] gene so
[7437.0s] like I I never
[7441.559s] bet never bet what what does Buffett say
[7444.96s] he said
[7451.32s] um never bet what you have in Need For
[7454.239s] What
[7455.4s] you don&#39;t have and don&#39;t need or some
[7458.04s] something along those lines anyway the
[7460.0s] point is is that this is not not where I
[7463.0s] excel I&#39;m not a guy that&#39;s going to
[7465.079s] predict the future and I have to have a
[7466.96s] leap of faith I like businesses where I
[7469.36s] can see the cash and the price has just
[7471.36s] vacillated to you know two or three
[7473.48s] standard deviations below the cash flow
[7476.28s] Trend and I can just play the mean
[7477.679s] reversion so this kind of stuff uh God
[7481.0s] bless it and there people probably make
[7482.679s] a 5x from this at some point I mean look
[7485.92s] if this thing shot down to 100 on some
[7487.719s] ridiculous thing maybe I&#39;d take a punt
[7490.119s] on it I I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know even at 100
[7492.639s] if I could put clients in it and sleep
[7494.239s] at night I mean this would be like
[7495.48s] something I&#39;d just be like uh guys I
[7498.079s] can&#39;t risk client money in this and I
[7499.96s] just tell everyone I&#39;m going to buy a
[7502.04s] bunch of shares personally and you know
[7503.88s] I encourage you to do it but we can&#39;t
[7505.32s] take this level of risk in the portfolio
[7507.4s] it&#39;s a punt it&#39;s a gamble it&#39;s a you
[7509.4s] know it&#39;s it&#39;s a great jockey but uh I I
[7512.96s] can&#39;t get my hands around the valuation
[7514.48s] unless I have certainty that he&#39;s going
[7516.199s] to deliver on any of these things or if
[7518.52s] other people are going to I I don&#39;t do
[7520.36s] that that&#39;s not what I do so so um the
[7523.679s] other thing that I don&#39;t do is I don&#39;t
[7525.76s] have to participate in every stock
[7527.88s] that&#39;s in the headlines as a matter of
[7529.559s] fact I&#39;ve made all my money
[7530.8s] participating in stocks that are not in
[7532.48s] the headlines and selling them when they
[7534.36s] are in the headlines so the fact that
[7536.079s] Tesla is in the headlines every day
[7537.44s] tells me I&#39;m not interested there will
[7539.4s] be a time if this thing is going to be a
[7540.96s] bargain that it will not be in the
[7542.559s] headlines at all for six months no one
[7544.32s] will be talking about it that&#39;s when you
[7546.239s] want to buy right now eh you probably
[7548.96s] get a bounce it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
[7550.679s] interesting enough for me I never bet
[7552.04s] against a guy he&#39;s a genius all right
[7553.76s] thoughts on DK wants thoughts on target
[7557.119s] uh I think we covered this last week
[7560.119s] DK
[7564.32s] uh certainly closer to a buy Point than
[7566.639s] a sell point I&#39;m
[7570.84s] not I&#39;m not ready to buy this one no
[7573.4s] change from last week I I think it&#39;s
[7575.199s] getting close to the point where you
[7576.4s] want to own it but I just don&#39;t
[7579.199s] generally like that business president
[7580.679s] Trump had immediate event with Elon Musk
[7582.719s] declared he will double US Auto
[7584.679s] production from
[7586.239s] Tesla I&#39;ve contacted CPS investor
[7588.679s] relations but they never provided a
[7590.04s] breakdown of what car models were
[7591.44s] supplying to if not at all I I&#39;ve told
[7594.199s] you on the podcast that they Supply to
[7596.559s] Tesla they just
[7597.92s] don&#39;t uh they&#39;re not allowed to use the
[7600.04s] logo in their pitch deck um and that
[7603.96s] would not be a decision that would not
[7605.88s] have any bearing on whether I invest
[7608.92s] in Cooper standard or not even even
[7611.719s] though it affirmed what you were hoping
[7612.92s] to hear it&#39;s kind of useless information
[7616.199s] Professor Tom the globalization is
[7618.679s] stopping and countries are moving
[7620.76s] towards One&#39;s best interests does this
[7624.239s] affect your thesis on
[7625.76s] Baba Baba&#39;s not an exporter so why would
[7629.159s] that affect my thesis on
[7631.04s] baba
[7633.159s] um would you hold it past
[7637.32s] 2029 Trump&#39;s second term if didn&#39;t reach
[7640.159s] intrinsic value
[7648.92s] Tesla being there was a major reason I
[7650.84s] invested in
[7653.199s] China uh I don&#39;t know how you connect
[7656.44s] those dots I apologize it was a long
[7659.119s] question apology accepted uh sharing
[7662.559s] your knowledge means a lot well thank
[7663.76s] you very much and thank you for having
[7664.88s] the courage to send in a question Jimmy
[7667.04s] Jones um I don&#39;t I still don&#39;t know what
[7670.04s] your question is
[7672.079s] oh some theory about globalization de
[7675.199s] globalization has nothing to do with my
[7677.0s] investment in Alibaba I can assure you
[7678.8s] none of
[7680.199s] my macro opinions have anything to do
[7683.28s] with how I underwrite individual
[7685.239s] companies for the next three to five
[7687.28s] years um as for whether I&#39;ll own it
[7689.599s] after Trump is in or out um my sense is
[7692.88s] this is going to move a lot faster than
[7694.28s] everyone thinks and it&#39;s going to exceed
[7696.84s] my estimates of intrinsic value sooner
[7699.04s] than I think it is and I&#39;m going to sell
[7701.28s] it at that level and it&#39;s going to go up
[7703.0s] a lot more than I thought it would and
[7705.96s] for 18 months I&#39;m going to regret
[7708.4s] selling it at a price that I thought was
[7710.76s] insane and uh and then 24 months after
[7713.8s] that I&#39;m going to be glad that I was not
[7715.48s] a pig uh and didn&#39;t get slaughtered with
[7718.36s] the rest of them I&#39;ll leave it at
[7720.4s] that uh Filipe Andrew
[7726.0s] pinkos
[7727.84s] selones yes we like it we&#39;ve said we
[7730.52s] liked it we don&#39;t own it at this time
[7735.119s] NF uh bought some Insider stocks that&#39;s
[7737.719s] from Brady
[7740.079s] Todaro I don&#39;t like this look I like
[7742.52s] Cooper St I like Comstock I don&#39;t like
[7745.04s] these other producers because I don&#39;t
[7748.28s] know enough about their assets and I&#39;m
[7751.639s] not going to spend six months to answer
[7754.199s] and ask me anything question like I did
[7756.92s] understanding range resources and com
[7758.96s] stock resources and eqt and making the
[7762.159s] decisions that I did to do range a while
[7765.599s] ago com stock more recently at $8 and
[7768.76s] change just around Jerry Jones
[7771.36s] basis um where&#39;s
[7775.159s] NF yeah this has been around for five
[7777.4s] minutes I&#39;m you&#39;re probably okay but I I
[7781.28s] just like better quality stuff and
[7783.079s] better quality management teams Cole
[7785.0s] especially in the oil patch Cole
[7787.119s] fman uh new job as an investment analyst
[7790.159s] wondering what you news you use to stay
[7792.639s] up to
[7793.8s] date I mean the basics like you say here
[7796.92s] uh for General stuff you know you get
[7799.04s] the cide research Wall Street Journal
[7801.36s] Barons Bloomberg yes get all of those
[7803.92s] that&#39;s the
[7805.119s] minimum um Financial
[7810.639s] Times you seem very knowledgeable on
[7812.84s] everything that&#39;s going on yeah I read
[7814.32s] non-stop like Buffett I mean
[7817.119s] um because I love it so yeah that those
[7819.96s] five are the starting points and then
[7821.719s] you&#39;ll as you the more you read the more
[7823.559s] you&#39;re going to learn about other things
[7824.639s] to read industry Publications depending
[7827.04s] what Holdings you have Etc thoughts on
[7829.04s] ANF amberi and Finch yeah I&#39;m look I
[7831.96s] mean I&#39;ve got enough discretionary but
[7834.0s] I&#39;m keeping my eyes open because they&#39;ve
[7835.4s] got no not yet this is a broken momentum
[7838.32s] stock not even thinking about it yet uh
[7841.32s] Edgard Constellation
[7844.04s] Energy I don&#39;t know why people are so in
[7846.4s] love with this
[7849.96s] stock see
[7855.559s] G no not
[7858.239s] yet
[7863.559s] um all right so Brady&#39;s asking we have
[7866.079s] to uh refinance all this debt this
[7870.239s] year look that&#39;s why they&#39;re doing what
[7872.36s] they&#39;re doing right now to bring down
[7873.639s] rates I mean part of this tariff
[7875.44s] nonsense about Fentanyl and yeah that&#39;s
[7878.8s] part of it for sure but it&#39;s also to
[7881.32s] create some volatility to get bond
[7883.119s] yields down so they can refinance as
[7884.8s] much of it as possible uh today was a
[7887.96s] little bumpy because of uh the 30-year
[7890.76s] auction so uh yeah it&#39;s a thing and the
[7894.119s] administration is on top of it and Bon
[7895.76s] told you exactly that we&#39;re going to
[7896.96s] move from very quickly from tariff
[7900.04s] rattling to growth initiatives I.E tax
[7902.88s] cuts deregulation and the Market&#39;s going
[7905.4s] to hockey stick straight up into the
[7906.92s] summer and no one&#39;s going to wonder why
[7909.0s] and it&#39;s not going to let people in and
[7910.96s] then July they&#39;re going to buy just in
[7912.48s] time for the fall weakness Greg
[7916.159s] alamari uh what&#39;s your take on ddl a
[7918.559s] Chinese grocery store answer is no okay
[7922.44s] basically if it&#39;s
[7923.88s] not one of the biggest companies in
[7926.119s] China that&#39;s been around for decades I
[7928.0s] won&#39;t touch it because half of them wind
[7929.719s] up being frauds and you say well that&#39;s
[7932.079s] pretty harsh Tom Well yeah if you&#39;ve
[7934.199s] been around markets for 20 years you&#39;ve
[7936.0s] seen all kinds of stuff happen in China
[7938.639s] so I&#39;m not willing to take country and
[7940.599s] Company even even though there are
[7941.719s] hundreds of companies that on paper in
[7943.48s] China look like the best thing I&#39;ve ever
[7945.239s] seen in my life complete wet dreams of
[7948.239s] of uh Financial balance sheet income
[7951.079s] statement I won&#39;t touch them with with a
[7953.119s] 10- foot pole um and I&#39;m sticking to
[7957.36s] that uh that&#39;s that Matt glass
[7964.239s] hour thank you for continuing to do your
[7966.44s] weekly podcast you&#39;re welcome I found
[7968.32s] you about a year ago I&#39;ve been following
[7969.679s] you baba CP yes gxo your approach has
[7972.679s] completely changed my investment Outlook
[7974.199s] and has drastically changed my portfolio
[7975.639s] for the better what are your thoughts on
[7977.0s] Estee louder well we&#39;ve covered that a
[7978.92s] lot we like it a lot and it&#39;s a play on
[7980.84s] the China recovery so uh you just have
[7983.159s] to be patient with that but I&#39;ve been
[7984.639s] talking a lot with the makeup people
[7986.48s] both at Fox and this week I talked with
[7988.36s] the ones at Yahoo apparently they
[7990.599s] destroyed the Mac brand but beyond that
[7992.84s] it&#39;s a great quality product and it&#39;s a
[7994.599s] complete play he&#39;s talking about it as a
[7996.639s] play on Russia I think you&#39;re right but
[7999.079s] it&#39;s more of a play on China which is
[8000.679s] just start stting so um that one&#39;s going
[8003.52s] to be fine in our view and as it starts
[8005.48s] to show signs of improvement that might
[8007.36s] be one we would actually buy up as it
[8010.079s] really starts to prove itself and it&#39;s
[8012.52s] uh it&#39;s not at that level yet asml one
[8015.52s] of the greatest businesses in the world
[8017.159s] from Chad Lamborn it&#39;s come down a
[8019.96s] little bit
[8024.559s] uh not for me yet I mean if this thing
[8029.28s] you know God forbid this got down to
[8031.079s] $500 I&#39;d probably this would
[8036.32s] potentially be one of the bigger
[8038.679s] positions in the portfolio but it would
[8040.199s] probably still be smaller than
[8041.88s] Intel uh best content on any media thank
[8044.52s] you that&#39;s very kind of you uh devis L
[8048.599s] what&#39;s your opinion on Wayfair not
[8050.36s] thrilled with the CEO if they changed
[8052.0s] the CEO I&#39;d probably get very interested
[8054.8s] Thomas bar found a couple gems I&#39;m
[8058.119s] curious your thought Culp and Kirk
[8062.48s] uh please only send one name
[8065.96s] per
[8069.28s] question see this
[8080.079s] one Culp is burning cash and the
[8082.559s] revenues are declining deserves to be
[8084.199s] cheap so tell me what the turnaround
[8085.76s] story is I&#39;m not interested in Kirk
[8093.6s] [Music]
[8102.76s] this one is called solvency
[8112.88s] analysis man you like companies that
[8115.119s] burn cash and decline revenues I don&#39;t
[8117.76s] sleep with companies that burn cash and
[8120.0s] decline revenues
[8122.28s] um what do they
[8126.719s] do home decor and Furnishings in the US
[8129.96s] this is a housing play it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
[8132.639s] function of rates so it&#39;s like gener and
[8135.44s] Stanley so I would never own this as a
[8136.96s] third because I already have two of
[8138.32s] those housing plays and race plays but
[8146.76s] um yeah this is like legged in plat free
[8149.679s] cash flows burning what&#39;s happening with
[8151.36s] the balance
[8153.159s] sheet $4 million of
[8166.199s] cash uh I got some how much accounts
[8169.48s] receivable do they have a lot less than
[8172.119s] their payable
[8188.679s] wait let me see something here the hell
[8193.519s] is oh scratch that liabilities here we
[8199.319s] go oh long-term debt is 34
[8203.24s] million wait a second why are these
[8205.12s] numbers so different what was I just
[8207.24s] looking
[8209.04s] at all right so they do oh they have
[8211.559s] accounts payable of 46 million they have
[8214.08s] no accounts receivable and they
[8220.439s] have 34 million of long-term debt 3
[8225.2s] million of cash I mean I totally see
[8227.519s] what you&#39;re seeing in terms of a trade
[8230.479s] but um let&#39;s see if they have they
[8233.0s] diluted have they raised equity
[8242.559s] no share counts this one&#39;s super risky
[8245.679s] this is like a PA punt but I think you I
[8248.719s] think it might work if it doesn&#39;t go
[8250.679s] bankrupt you&#39;re going to make a
[8252.04s] multibagger but it&#39;s definitely not
[8254.479s] looking great right now so I&#39;d have to
[8256.12s] really do dig in on their turnaround
[8257.88s] story and see some signs of improvement
[8260.479s] because the financials are just showing
[8262.479s] me uh Death By A Thousand Cuts Rob S
[8266.96s] appreciate all the consistent great
[8268.16s] knowledge you share was wondering why
[8269.24s] you prefer to buy the suppliers of Home
[8270.519s] Builders than the home builders uh we
[8272.28s] covered that
[8274.639s] um yeah so that&#39;s good I read your mind
[8278.2s] and we covered it today Goran
[8282.24s] stoit
[8284.679s] uh okay he&#39;s talking about the whole
[8286.96s] policy thing with with related to China
[8289.0s] these are all the people who missed the
[8290.319s] move up from 70 to 100 40 that are now
[8293.679s] saying yeah but but what if you&#39;re wrong
[8295.76s] what if you&#39;re wrong look we knew these
[8297.599s] risks when we got in at now a blended
[8300.08s] basis of 8 3 a lot in the hundreds a lot
[8303.04s] more in the
[8304.28s] 60s
[8306.719s] um and that&#39;s why it&#39;s not the only
[8308.96s] position in the portfolio because on a
[8310.359s] numbers basis and on what they&#39;re doing
[8312.319s] basis it would it would easily be 110%
[8314.76s] of our our net worth except you you just
[8317.479s] have to assume there&#39;s some risk of what
[8318.84s] you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and
[8319.88s] if it goes to zero do you live another
[8321.28s] day but uh I think the highest most
[8324.559s] acute level of that risk during the B
[8326.24s] Biden Administration was alleviated by
[8328.08s] the pcaob decision and uh um and that&#39;s
[8331.719s] all you can do so you know it&#39;s this is
[8333.719s] a calculated Risk game and
[8336.399s] uh
[8338.439s] uh with every position I mean these are
[8341.0s] known
[8341.92s] risks with every other position there
[8344.16s] are unknown risks that you don&#39;t know
[8346.399s] that you don&#39;t even know and that&#39;s why
[8348.08s] you have a POS you know uh you could
[8351.12s] have a portfolio of 15 to 30 or 40
[8353.639s] stocks but you&#39;re never going to
[8355.28s] outperform uh
[8363.559s] but you can&#39;t you know I mean maybe you
[8366.359s] could do what Buffett with what Monger
[8368.24s] talks about and have you know four or
[8369.76s] five is enough diversification but you
[8371.84s] know if you lose a you know if you
[8374.0s] lose one of those the other four better
[8377.559s] be damn good to out earn and then still
[8381.08s] be able to outperform so I I don&#39;t like
[8383.16s] that game I like I like the 8 to 12 game
[8385.16s] sometimes a little more maybe even push
[8386.8s] up to 14 15 at certain points in the
[8389.24s] market but uh uh best base case is is
[8392.76s] more concentrated and accepting the risk
[8394.64s] in in each discret underwriting and
[8397.24s] going in with my eyes wide open so uh
[8399.52s] the answer to your question is yeah I
[8400.8s] see what you see so does everyone else
[8402.88s] and uh and it&#39;s up 100%
[8406.0s] so there&#39;s that uh with that said I want
[8409.28s] to thank everyone for tuning in we&#39;re
[8410.68s] going to be back next time same time
[8413.08s] same place next week except we&#39;re going
[8415.0s] to have the most amazing guest in CEO
[8418.6s] Jeff Edwards of Cooper standard you
[8421.0s] won&#39;t believe what he&#39;s done to set this
[8423.479s] thing up for the next turn next uh uh
[8426.72s] phase of this cycle turn we&#39;ve seen the
[8429.2s] nent stages and the part is just getting
[8431.6s] started so with that said see you next
[8433.6s] week in the meantime make it a great one
