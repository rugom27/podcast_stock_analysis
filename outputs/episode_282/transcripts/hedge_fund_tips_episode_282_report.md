### N/A

**Executive Summary**

He also reiterates his bullish stance on Alibaba (BABA) and Cooper Standard (CPS). He emphasizes the importance of focusing on value stocks and international opportunities, while lightening up on the Magnificent Seven. He believes the market is in a bottoming process and expects a rally into the summer.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish, expecting a rally into the summer after a period of weakness due to policy uncertainty. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Market sentiment is flushed out.
- Hedge funds are selling in the hole.
- Retail investors are buying insurance after the house is already half burned down.
- Earnings are up 18.2% for the last quarter.
- Expectation of lower tariffs leading to free trade.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
Hayes believes the market weakness in February and early March is a normal seasonal pattern in an election year due to policy uncertainty. He expects a rally from March through the summer once there is clarity on policy. He is watching the Japanese government bond yield and the unwind of the carry trade, which he believes is impacting the Mag 7. He anticipates lower tariffs and a move towards free trade.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Japanese Government Bond Yield (JGB) | Increased from 0 to 1.57% | The increase in JGB yields is causing an unwind of the carry trade, leading to deleveraging in crowded trades like the Mag 7. This is more important than tariffs. |
| US Auto Sales (SAR) | Historically peaks between 17 and 20 million units | With an aging car fleet and a growing population, the US could see a surge in auto sales, potentially reaching 20 million units. |
| Fed Funds Futures | 89% chance of a June rate cut | The market is pricing in a higher probability of a rate cut, which could provide support for risk assets. |
