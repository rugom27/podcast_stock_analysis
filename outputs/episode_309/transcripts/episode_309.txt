Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 309th videocast podcast for the week ending September 18th, 2025. We got a lot of great stuff to cover this week, but as always, family first. I got my incredible Headphone Tips t-shirt on. You can get yours at the website. But uh more importantly, I had a chance to do probably what's going to be one of the last daddy daughter dances uh with my daughter at the club this w this past Friday and uh we just had a great time. There are some of the photos there. It's a little Annabelle and it was obviously a cowboy theme. Super fun. But as you can see, she's on the big side of the remainder of the um the uh the event. So, uh we really enjoyed that. Kind of sad that it's the last uh getting the tail end there, but then I had a chance to go down to Dallas to be with some friends. I want to thank Chris K for hosting me. We got to play Fields Ranch East Course. Uh and um boy, it was uh we walked the course. It was absolutely incredible. One of the toughest course the Caddyy was telling me he's seen seven indexes go there and shoot a 100. Um I despite five penalty balls. Uh my putter was hot as hell. Uh shot in the mid 80s and uh and called it a day. That was that was good. Two birdies on the back, but man, what a tough track. And my ribs were hurting. So I was pushing it right until I pulled out the 3-wood and kind of got things in order. That's when I got the birdies. But um super thank you for the hosting there. There you can see they're building a lot of great houses out in Fris where the course is at PGA National. We also got to go to a Cowboys Giants game. One of the most exciting football games I've ever experienced. Unfortunately, the Giants lost, but they were all happy in the box that their Cowboys won. Understandably so. Thanks again to Chris. Got to benefit from the field passes and walk down on the field, which was a first time for me. Super excited, super grateful. Thank you so much. What a fun experience. Uh, tomorrow morning at 9:25 a.m. Eastern, I will be on Fox Business Varnian Co. Uh, hoping we can do a shorter podcast this week because next week I've got Clayman, I've got Yahoo, I've got Big Money Show for two hours, I've got um, uh, claiming Yahoo. um Vanney for sure uh in in studio next week which I'm excited about. I've got uh possibly Charles Payne for the following Tuesday. We'll see how that shakes out and a lot more. So tomorrow, tune in. I'll be on remote and then next week all in studio. So we're going to have a lot of media next week. Hopefully we can get through a lot of data this week. Benjamin Graham quotes of the week. In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run it's a weighing machine. And I've added to this as many of you know uh in the short run the market's a voting machine based on emotions. In the long run it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals. We've now seen that uh amply in Cooper Standard. These are just in the last few months. Cooper Standard in Alibaba in PayPal we saw this week in Intel we saw this morning. Uh and it's just the beginning ladies and gentlemen. I'm very very excited for you. Very very grateful for all my clients. But more than that, I'm excited for all my clients. Uh, and uh, and there are a handful of you that took huge bets on me when I was tiny. Uh, and you've been rewarded amply. And, uh, and there are many of you that are taking huge bets on me now. And, um, and it's just the beginning of great things to come uh, as we grow and, uh, deliver as much value as humanly possible. So, um, here's from Seth Clarman. value investing at its core is the marriage of a contrarian streak and a calculator. I think a lot of people forget the calculator part and they think that oh I can just buy any stock that's down a lot uh but without doing the math and without understanding the framework and without the proper expressions uh it's not going to work out as anticipated. So we try to convey as much of that knowledge as we can here uh while still giving our clients the edge every single week. Um, and uh, and I'm very very grateful for all the kind messages that I've been receiving all year long. Uh, and particularly in the last few months from everyone who not only has doubled and tripled their money and now become clients, but uh, more than that, uh, some of the more important stories. I had one client come in this week who said his sister's husband passed away in COVID and she turned her account, I think she got had $300,000. she turned her account into like $650,000 following me and that was uh gamechanging for her as a single mom. Uh that's way more important to me uh than turning a $50 million account into a hundred. But we enjoy doing both. So uh here we go. Uh want to thank some people for adding their pictures. to those of you who have been contributing to um getting the merch. Okay, the number one thing that keeps this thing going is growth. Uh I'll continue to put it out there as long as you guys continue to share it and we continue to grow subscribers. And the way to do that is wear the merch. You can go to hedge funips.com, click on the hat here, and then a lot of you have been kind and sending in your pictures uh to the website. We got a couple new ones up this week. Want to thank you for doing that. While that uh loads, I also want to remind you that Annabelle is in the world's longest running competition for athlete of the year. If I had known they were going to drag it out for months, uh probably would have never entered her into it. But that being said, she's now second in the quarterfinals. So, where you get the videocast on hedge funips.com, you'll see it up last week, episode 308. Click here on the link if you want to vote for Annabelle. Let's push her from second in the quarterfinals to first in the quarterfinals uh by voting there and so on and so forth. Okay. Uh here is our newest picture. This is Frederick Weebie Wie Ebe from Germany. I'll read his story later, but he's 16 or 17 years old. I think he just turned 17 and sent this awesome picture with his mug, sharing it with all his friends. And please uh uh we're very grateful for the orders, but we're not doing the merch to make $6 on a hat. We're doing the merch so that you wear it around and people around you that are like-minded that want to learn about markets ask you about it and come into the community and and learn and grow and share the good news. So um uh please contribute to the extent that you can uh but simply by being here every week and offering your support and liking and subscribing and adding your comments and helping the algorithm each week uh is very very appreciated. All right, on to some data ladies and gentlemen. Let's start with Sloomer so we can get a picture of the uh overall market. I want to thank my buddy who always sends this consistently without fail. You know who you are and you've been around since the beginning. Very, very grateful to you. So, here's the S&P. This monthly range looks like it pushes up to 6,900 or beyond. Uh the question is when? We don't know when, but the start of an easing cycle or the restart of an easing cycle is a move in the right direction. So, we're excited about that. It seems like uh we've gotten through a lot of the seasonally weak period. There is a tendency the last two weeks of September if there is going to be some weakness to for it to show up. Now, uh hard to say uh whether we we're going to see that this year or not, but looking at the Russell up 2.5% today. Small caps, baby. What have we been pounding the table on? By the way, here's a stat I heard today. 967 days since the last all-time high in the Russell. This is just starting to break out. We've got our small cap exposure. We're super excited and we hope you do, too. Here is S&P with advanced decline. Uh here is equal weight also starting to break out. This is going to be the game for the next 12 to 24 months. If you're in cap weighted, you are going to underperform equal weighted in our view. Again, all this is opinion, not advice. Click go to hedge funips.com. Click on terms. All right. Next, uh here's the Russell. This is what we talked about with the breakout. Built this cup large handle. Now, it's going to break out. Measured move implies uh 32 3,300 on the Russell Small cap index. Uh, and I think that will be just the beginning. Bearish sentiment is unbelievably high considering how well the market is doing. So, usually not the kind of things you see at exact tops. Does that preclude a little pullback? No. But, um, it's unbelievable. Could you imagine if you were a manager that sold in the hole in April when we were buying and what you have to do now into year end? There are going to be a lot of people with pink slips. It's it's unbelievable. Um, pray for them. Hang Sang just getting started. You talk about the Russell breaking out to new highs. Wait till the Hang Sang does it. It's so funny. People are still skeptical about this rally and it'll take a little breather and then it'll go up to 200 and then all the negative anti-China D-listing ADR people are going to get forced in over 200 on Baba and um uh there will be a point where we're going to be happy to help them out. It probably has a three handle on it, but uh God bless or or as they say in the South, bless your heart. Hang Sang, here we go. Same story outperformed 3 to1. My buddy Brendan's Kweb ETF for China uh just breaking out of this cup and handle on its way to the promised land. Kudos Brendan. I think that day that we played golf in September of 20124 marked the bottom and uh and the and the market god said, "These guys are persistent mofos. Let's just turn it around for them." And here we go. Early early days. Uh super excited for you and for everyone listening. Uh Germany showing some weakness uh on the DAX 30-year yield dropped 10-year yield is kind of basing here. This will be interesting to see how this plays out, whether we get a counter trend bouncing down or if we resume the downtrend. There's also a lot to see with regard to the dollar. This looks like it's going to keep moving up and yields are going to bust through. Like we said, uh mid3s, everyone was calling for fives on the 10-year. We kept saying mid-3s when it was right around five. And that's exactly what's happening. And what else have we been saying? 30-year fix below 6% before the end of the year. Time's ticking, but we're getting closer, ladies and gentlemen. So, we'll see what happens. Here's the dollar index breaking down. They're showing support here at 95. We'll show you some other charts in the charts of the week. Looney continues to show strength. Breakout back test probably resume uptrend. Uh Euro, same thing. A little bit of resistance here. Probably continues to plow forward. That's exciting. Uh I've got some land in Portugal that I want to lay off because uh anyway, it is what it is. I'll take a strong euro. Uh oil hitting support here. You can see the theme of our article of the week we'll cover regarding oil. Um, gold continues to show strength. I mean, have at it. If you want to chase gold up here, make my day. God bless you. I hope you make a lot of money and live live to tell the story and don't give it back to the casino. But good luck and Godspeed. Bless your heart. Uh, on to the next. Uh, what do we got here? Microsoft, Dell, Crowd Strike, KAC, AAT, K Web, Ali, Effing Baba. Here we go, baby. Breaking out. If you recall um let's see the mammoth cycle which we covered and by the way now it's happening for PayPal as well which we covered last week and this is basically where we are now. We broke out at denial in Alibaba. You can see it here. And this is not rearview mirror like all the technicians you see out there that show you after the fact uh how obvious it was because we were the ones that were pounding the table when the thing was in the 50s and everyone was saying uninvestable and Morgan Stanley was downgrading in the hole. And that uh author from Baronss kept hammering it every single week for 136 weeks straight. By the way, she's been quiet as a mouse ever since. It doubled and now going to double again. Um, so here this retracement, whatever the hell it is, looks like it's going to 181. Does it go straight there? Does it test back 148? I don't know. We have uh harvested all of our January 2026 spreads at 6x and change. Uh, our max expected value was 7x. We don't want to be pigs. Uh this was enormous enormous sums of money and uh we're very grateful. We have not sold one share. We do not intend to sell one share anytime soon. Nor have we sold even one of our uh uh longerdated plays uh out to 2027. We just did this out of an abundance of locking in insane amounts of money for our clients. Um, okay. Uber, Tesla, by the way, full self-driving, absolutely incredible. Homebuilders starting to go. All these themes are now playing out and they'll all jump on. You'll hear all the people that were selling here that get excited when it breaks out and um but that's great. That's why we're able to do what we do if anyway. So, uh, Albamaro again, breakout, check back on the minds, go into 116 plus, and then it's going to probably go a lot higher and work its way to new highs over the next few years. Very excited about that one. Uh, let's see. Wow, a lot of charts in this one. A lot of stuff getting ready. A lot of the unmnificent 493, a lot of the international, a lot of the small caps, a lot of the equal weights. Uh, now starting to get bid. Okay, now on to the data. Five key takeaways from the meeting with Jerome Powell from CNBC. Number one, while the rate reduction was no surprise, there was plenty of intrigue over what the dot plot of individual members expectations would show for the future. The upshot, two more cuts this year, another in 2026, and one more in 2027. All of which would take the Fed funds rate down to 3% which the median forecast of the committee sees as neutral, which means you get option arms at four, four and a half. and uh housing goes bananas. Uh markets number two, markets weren't sure what to make of it all. An initial rally by the Dow Jones Industrial uh both the Treasury market yields were lower on the short end. Okay, so we don't care what happened on the first day. Three, at least some of the confusion may have been from Powell characterizing the rate move as riskmanagement cut on top. This guy is so confused it's unbelievable. On top of that, while the FOMC indicated a rapid pace of cutting this year with moves at the two remaining meetings in October and December, it anticipates just one reduction each of the next two years with no cuts in 2028. The mix between dovishness and hawkishness left markets queasy. Not today. Uh the meeting began with a whiff a strong whiff of poli politics with Governor Steven Mirren. Attended his first meeting after being sworn in Tuesday. However, Powell gave little indication of tension in the air. The only way for any voter to really move things around is to be incredibly persuasive. And the only way to do that in the context in which we work is to make really strong arguments based on the data and understand the economy. That's all that really matters and that's how it's going to work. The chair said while Mirren was the only member to cast a vote against the cut in favor of a larger half-point move. The dot plot showed a wide disparity among officials views underscoring the challenging policy path ahead. Those wanting just one more cut this year lost narrowly by 10 to9 margin against those looking for two. Future years also showed a wise distribution across potential outcomes. All right. Uh this is cool. Alibaba developed AI processor on par with Nvidia's H20 chip. CCTV report shows. Very exciting. Here's energy stocks breaking out. No one's paying attention to it. Uh dollar index breaking down uh more than 15-year uh lows. Okay. So, keep an eye on this. If we get down to 95, this is broken. This is going to continue down for the next two years. Maybe we get a counter trend bounce before we break through, but I think the trend is what we've been talking about since it was up here and no one believed us. Weaker dollar long international long small small cap long value. All right, here's some color on the Nvidia deal from this morning from a pessimist, but I'd like to read the counterarguments just to um allow us to climb the wall of worry, but it says, "Nvidia Intel Color, the two companies are announcing a partnership this morning to develop quote custom data center and PC products. As part of the alliance, Nvidia will invest $5 billion in Intel's common stock at a purchase price of 2338. Intel closed at $24.90. This Nvidia injection follows a $2 billion soft bank stake at $23 and the Treasury's$ 8.9 billion investment at 20.47 for data centers. Intel will build custom Nvidia x86 CPUs that Nvidia will integrate into its AI infrastructure platforms and offer to the market. For personal computing, Intel will build and offer the market x86 system on system chips, SOC's that integrate NVIDIA RTX GPU chiplets. This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing stack with computing stack with Intel CPUs and the vast x86 ecosystem. Um, if you recall, what I've been telling you was the government investment was the best thing that ever happened to Intel because the quidd proquo and the um implicit endorsement would create pressure on domestic designers to become clients of Intel. You are seeing the first stage of this for all the skeptics. This is chapter one. This is the first inning for those of you who like baseball. So, uh, here's what this guy says. It means the news represents another financial lifeline for Intel and will further, uh, eliminate questions about its balance sheet wherewithal bolstering the balance sheet could help sentiment around semiconductor equipment as it enhances Intel's ability to spend. Although, the real issue when it comes to Intel's capex is finding major external customers for its foundry business. Duh. What do you think is going to happen next with Intel? And that is not being addressed here. No Sherlock. For Nvidia, the $5 billion is a tiny drop in the bucket. It means nothing financially, but it does help bolsters the company's relationship with the White House by supporting a key semiconductor national champion. That's correct. This is a key point that this author makes. US semiconductor national champion. This is key. The outlook for these new joint products is unclear. There hasn't exactly been a clamoring for joint Nvidia x86 chips. Although the knee-jerk reaction is likely to be negative for AMD and the market's going to uh markets other big a x86 player. I think this is going to completely uh gut punch AMD. AMD, you know, took advantage of Intel's ineptness. Now they're partnering with Nvidia. Nvidia needs the fabs. But that that's the thing that people have been missing since we broached this thesis. Nvidia needs Intel almost as much, if not more, than Intel needs Nvidia. Okay? Nvidia has something to lose. Intel had nothing to lose. They were in the gutter. It was all asymmetry to the upside. and and the US government couldn't let them go because they needed them so for for national security. So you put all this together and this was an absolute no-brainer uh that everyone was sleeping on and now everyone's going to be able to take advantage of that was listening. So uh blah blah blah. It's notable what is not happening. Here's the pessimism. Nvidia is not committing to having its standalone chips built in Intel fabs. At least not at this time. No kidding. Okay. which would have been a huge deal. They want to, you know, you want a little foreplay before you get down to business, okay? And uh uh they're not going to give them the whole kitten kaboodleoodle out of the gate. They want to say, "Okay, Lip Bhutan's now in charge. We got an adult in the room. Let's see how they do. Let's give them a couple crumbs. If they deliver on the crumbs, it look, it's just like clients with me. I I got these guys that are worth 300, 500,$2 billion. They come and they throw me a crumb. They give me five million bucks. I turn it into 10 million bucks. They give me a lot more. Oh, I didn't know you had more. Yeah, there's like a few hundred million behind it. Oh, okay. Thanks for letting me know. Uh, and then next thing you know, it's 50. Next thing you know, it's a h 100red. It's the exact same thing with Nvidia. Why would they give them a hundred million or, you know, or in this case all the orders right away until they test them out? Let Nvidia prove their new competency uh under a great leader and then they'll get all the business. I mean, Nvidia would love nothing more than to give all their business to Intel uh to hedge their risk with with Taiwan Semiconductor, but Intel has to prove it and now they're going to do it and they've got the government backs stop and it's going to be absolutely unbelievable. Okay, so uh which would have been a huge deal. So, the news shouldn't be negative for Taiwan Semiconductor, although these joint Nvidia Intel products could help fill capacity in Intel fabs, assuming there's strong demand for them. Okay, so pretty decent mixed note, but nowhere near the vision of what we've been talking about for months and is starting to take place. Here's that long-term dollar chart. Keep an eye on consumer sentiment index and subsequent 12 month S&P 500 returns. Thanks Allan for this. This goes to show that when you get consumer sentiment this low, by the way, we just retested the sentiment lows that we saw in October 2022 when we bought every share of Google and Amazon that we could get our hands on. It was a quick double within 12 to 15 months. Um, clients made a lot of money on that one. Look, our sentiment is back down here. The question is, where is those quick doubles and triples? And I can tell you they're in your portfolio. Okay. And you haven't seen this since the financial crisis, since 2022, since 2011, since 1990, uh, since 1980. These were all massive, unbelievable buy opportunities if you knew the right sectors to be in, and that's what we're having right now. So, yeah, are we at all times highs? Yes. But is the whole market at all-time highs? If you own an S&P index, you are kidding yourself. You own a MAG7 index and you're betting that multiples should stay at 33 times for MAG 7 even though earnings growth has decelerated from 33% down to 10%. Good luck with that. Okay. On the flip side, if you look for the opportunity under the surface, you could see indices be flat for a year and a half and see more doubles and triples under the surface than you've ever seen before because the waitings of the companies that are doubles and triples where they're starting from is so insignificant, it won't move the index, but it will move your P&L and possibly make you very, very wealthy. Uh, Zack Tan puts out uh, notable Chinese pop icon Jolen Sai who is also the ambassador of Valentino was seen wearing a pair of Valentino X Vans Authentics in her latest music video released today. She has a huge devoted fan base in Chinese entertainment sphere. The popular popularity of Vans Authentics in China is skyrocketing because of this. Okay, maybe I should get some Vans Valentinos with cat faces on the front. I'll wear them with pride. The Valentino Vans are selling for $500 a pair on the Valentino WeChat store. All sizes have sold out. I'm going to get me some cat shoes. China new car sales 2025 OEM model vehicle type again record blowing out 2024 2023 Cooper Standard benefits S&P to new all-time highs versus bullish sentiment at the lows. You can see here um despite the indices being at all-time highs, sentiments at all-time lows and what happens there is great things happen for the most undervalued areas. You know, if you look at COVID, it was energy and banks. If you look at some of these others, uh if you look at 2022, it was tech. And if you look at now, it's all the names that we own. Russell small cap stocks, total short interest, record high, breaking out to new highs. These guys are going to be monkey hammered, shellacked. If you remember the video game from when you were a kid where the heads kept popping up and they kept getting bashed in their head with a hammer, that's exactly what's going to happen to all the people that are short small caps. And that's going to create buyers that elevate this thing to double over the next few years. China listed Hong Kong ETF see record inflow. Opinion follows trend. Announced share buybacks by year still on pace. Interest over time. By the way, wait until you see the buyback announcements decelerate from the MAG7 because they're spending so much on capex with an undefined return on invested capital. It's it's kind of beautiful because um they're doing all the digging in the ditches and the guys that are going to make all the money are the ones selling them the shovels and the ones benefiting from all their labor. uh which is going to be exactly what happens with boring industrial companies whose margins double because of all the capex that these mag sevens spend on AI that they're going to utilize for you know a few hundred bucks a month and make fortunes by creating efficiencies in their processing chain. So uh so that's that. Mortgage rates today interest is going through the roof. Peak huge demand as rates come down. US jobless claims jumped to highest in nearly four years. So that's why they did their whatever he said defensive cut. Um small versus large stocks annualizing at negative 10% last 10 years. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't understand, this is going back to 1936 that we were at a twice in 100year opportunity. This is the fourth time in in a hundred years that you've had an opportunity to buy small caps at these valuations. And if you did it in 1956, by the way, this made Buffett's career from 1956 to 1968. He closed his partnership in 1968 when he ran out of opportunities. Um, if you did it in 2000 to 2008, if you did it in 1937 to 1951, you made more money than a one-armed. You're busier than a one-armed paper hanger finding opportunity. It's on right now and we are positioned for it. Super grateful. Wall Street versus Main Street peaking inequality. Uh, it's funny. My barber asked, "What do you think of the economy?" And I said, "Look, I think there's a huge divergence. I think if you own assets, you're happy. uh real estate or stocks and if you don't own assets, you're not happy. And that's a that's an issue that's going to have to get bridged over the next two three years, which it will because it did in the first um uh first term of the Trump presidency. And the first step to do that is to lower rates and let people in and let businesses hire, let businesses refinance, let businesses grow, which will create more employment, which will create more demand for labor. And then you'll see real wages continue to increase. Uh hyperscaler capex to cash flow reached 72%. So their capex is now eating away at the cash flow. Industry average transaction price versus industry average incentive paid as a percentage of average total price. So prices stopped going up 3 years ago for automobiles despite inflation continuing. Incentives are now reacelerating. This is the leading indicator for volume growth. Volume growth is the leading indicator for Cooper Standards earnings per share. The bull market is almost 3 years old, but as you can see, it's early days by historical average. Fourth year of the bull market is almost Fourth year of the bull market is almost year here year almost three years old. So fourth year I'm not sure what he's what point he's making here. Uh where are we here? Third almost three years old. So, the third year tends to be more subdued. This would line up perfectly with uh MAG 7 underperforming indices going flat, huge opportunities under the surface, midterm election cycle. I love this environment for what we're doing where no one's people are going to struggle to make money who are passive and people who know what they're doing active are going to make more money than in a year when the S&P is up 20%. So, um, super excited for 2026. The pay premium, if you know, it'd be very hard to top 2025, but, uh, super excited for 2026. The pay premium for switching jobs is near a 5year low. Uh, Q3 GDP estimates now back over 3% from the Atlanta Fed GDP. Now uh buyback stocks outperform uh wait all cap. Okay, this is hysterical. All country world index weights China is 3.26% versus Japan. Their economy is bigger. These weights are going to accelerate back up. Huge flows come into China. Get the handshake with Trump. So, we'll have some I think we're going to, you know, we've had this huge run. Uh I think we're going to consolidate a little bit in anticipation of a handshake, no handshake. They'll, you know, Trump will Trump will try to blow things up at the end to get one more thing in the negotiation. The Chinese stocks will come down 58%. Uh and then they'll shake hands and it'll be off to the races. So, um I could just see once they shake hands, the amount of flows that are going to go in chasing these rallies is insane. the percentage of America's 200 largest metro area housing markets seeing home prices rise or fall on a year-over-year basis. 38 as of July 2025, 38% of the nation's 200 largest housing markets saw home prices fall year-over-year. In July 2025, 62% saw it saw it rise. So, you you got to start to see city by city. CTAs are starting to get a little bit frothy in the indices. Um CPI less shelter rolling over year declines versus calendar year returns. Oh, that's interesting. Intry-year declines versus calendar year returns. Despite average intrayear drops of 14.1% annual returns were positive 34 to 35 years. So you can see we add a 19% intraday over 20% drop in 2025 year to date 10%. Uh concentration of S&P 500 market cap earnings in the largest 10 index constituents. So again 40% of the weight only 30% of the earnings those earnings decelerating. this will converge. Uh if it's more likely than not it will be the waiting going from 40 to 30 versus the earnings totally collapsing. But I could see 40 to 30 and earnings 30 to 25 for sure. Uh data center start uh start spending is accelerating. This is margins margins tend to decline before a recession. You can see here margins are near record highs 12.8%. uh liquidity versus yield curve feties will be big for the stock market. This is only bull market in post-war history which has lived its entire existence with negative excess financial liquidity with an inverted yield curve. This is about to change and stocks will love it. That's from Jim Pollson. One of the best ever in the business. Jim Pollson. Love that guy. A ai investor sentiment. Bulls minus bare spread. Again at the lows, not things you see at tops. Aggregate institutional net flows. This is hysterical. Hedge funds have been sellers since April. Continued sellers. They're so screwed. Aggregate long only net flows. They're chasing and S&P price. I mean, how how offsides can you be? It you just can't can't make this up. Uh, okay. We got to get get on with it here. Gross leverage long short ratio. Uh, five months off the April lows. S&P performance after 30% rallies in five months. Uh, one month later, average 1% up. 3 months later, average 6.8% up. Six months later, average 7.6% up. 12 months. After the 30% rally, on average, 18.1% up. Median age of an IPO is currently 14 years. Look, the ducks are quacking. They're going to start to feed them like nobody's business. Uh, owner occupied real estate assets and liabilities. Liabilities have been basically flat since 2007. Asset values have gone up 2 and a halfx 35 trillion of trapped equity that's going to be taken out and spent and invested at lower rates in coming quarters. Goldman Sachs Research lowered its forecast for global EV penetration raised it for hybrids. That's great for Cooper Standard total corporate profits versus trailing EPS. All right. uh returns after Fed interest rate cuts resume gain four or more cuts, two or fewer cuts. So if we're right and it's three this year and one next year, healthcare should be the biggest outperformer at 20.3% followed by Staples. Think Baxter, thinks uh Hormemell, think Dagio. These are the top two performers if we get four cuts over the next two years. than energy. Think natural oil well varco comp stock resources utilities no interest uh communicate which well crown castle is kind of a utility rate materials all the things that we're in. So if you believe we're getting three to four over the next 24 months you want to be out of financials uh and tech and uh some of this stuff and in healthcare staples energy etc. Exactly what we've been telling you with tomorrow's newspaper today. Here's the Russell. Large speculators net position, most short in a long time. Uh, and we're breaking out to new highs. They will be the first buyers. Alibaba, Hong Kong stock price and net inflow for mainland investors via Southbound Stock Connect. Uh, absolutely great. Um, by the way, just want to acknowledge Jeff Adams doing an unbelievable job getting a lot of this stuff ready each week. uh his analysis has become fantastic, his preparation has become fantastic and he has a very very bright future ahead with us. Uh CIOS want CEOs to prioritize increasing capital spending versus improving balance sheets. So that's a sign of animal spirits coming back. Cash level steady at 3.9 the past 3 months. This is usually what you see uh here. This was a multi-year rally. So, this first move, people say, "Oh, they have no cash. We're going to top." It's not the case. That's like what you see early after a big bare market. Uh, charts of the month, fund manager survey rises to seven-month high. It's still nowhere near the 2021 highs or the 2013 highs or the 2010 highs. It's very common coming out of a trough like we saw in April. 58% of FMS investors view global equity markets as overvalued. The wall of worry resumes. That's kind of interesting. I think indices are overvalued. I think what's missing the forest for the trees is what's under the surface. Uh that's hasn't even begun. Change since first and second Trump inaugurations. First term through end of 2027 plus 10%. Second term plus 10%. That's fant that's unbelievable. The performance of Trump 1.0 0 and Trump 2.0 this time in their respective presidencies is exactly identical. Uh US unemployment rate for age 20 to 24 is ticking up. Funding spread professional investor positioning this is from Goldman Sachs uh second and fourth contract. So this means we're nowhere near an extreme that you would see at a top effectively. This what they're trying to communicate here is there's plenty of room to run. Quarterly bottom up EPS actuals versus estimates every future quarter expected to show record profits. Change in quarterly earnings estimate since June July 3rd. They've been going up modestly especially in the out quarters. Uh look at this turning up 3004 for next year helped inflows to into US now exceeding unhedged. Twothirds of inflows are hedged. Equity flows are back to neutral. That's unreal. Defensive sectors market cap weight. If you don't have this, by the way, this is when the cover of Forbes magazine in 2000 when everyone was buying Cisco and Amazon before they both dropped 90%. Uh, and they had Buffett on the cover of I think it was Forbes saying, "Has Buffett lost his touch?" Buffett was buying all the defensives. uh Proctor and Gamble, Coca-Cola, Disney uh and uh and then when everyone else the bed the next three years he had his best performance uh of a very long time for from 2000 to 2004 when everyone else was getting absolutely shellacked. Uh same environment, ladies and gentlemen. Very interesting. I'm not necess I'm not really calling for I I do think there are going to be some some shiny object companies that get smashed, but uh I don't think I don't think the Mag 7 is going to get smashed because they have earnings power now. But uh the uh empty suits are going to get smashed for sure or the empty t-shirts nowadays. 47% expect the Fed to deliver four or more rate cuts over the next four months which next 12 months which what it it bodess well for healthcare materials staples etc. US retail sales top expectations in August. Breath thrust in S&P. Man, so much great stuff here. Uh here's Fund Strat looking for uh 6,800 to 6,900 on the S&P refinances [Music] multi-year four-year high this week alone. Early days dovestment de domestic investment is picking up after 10 years of underinvestment. Man, I thought this was going to be a short podcast without the media this week, but uh here we go. Uh dollar index last five years straight down. Forward earnings expectations still rising. Broadening of the profit cycle. Russell 2000 small caps now now cranking. emerging market equities now cranking. Here's how the Nvidia uh here's how the new Alibaba chip stacks up to Nvidia objective thing basically shows paru performance between the H20 and the Ping tog ppu by Ali effan baba. How do you like that ladies and gentlemen? Hang Sang tech tech index hits its highest level since 2021. China tech stocks remain at wide discount to US peers early days. Uh US retail sales you know they're going to give a little back in the next two weeks because everyone's forced to buy them. But uh after that what I love is like you know Baba I don't know where's Baba. Yeah 163. So maybe it goes to like one I don't I don't know. Maybe it goes to 170 first. But either way, whether from here or from there, I probably I think you could get another like $15 pullback and all the people who bought at 160 or 180 will sell down $15 and then it'll take off take off straight to 200 again. Uh and then everyone will be naming their dog after Alibaba and all the people that kept you out of the stock at 50 are going to be getting into getting you into it at 250. Mark my words, this is the most important thing you're going to hear on this podcast for the next 10 years. All the same people who got you out of your Alibaba stock at $50 are going to be the exact same people that get you into Alibaba stock at $250 per share. Mark my words, that one you can take to the bank. US retail sales looking good. uh big real estate inflows in 14 months and likely Fed cuts plus real estate conference. Don't know what that is. Breath of earnings revisions. Man, we are given some serious amount of value. Cap weighted to equal weighted index. Uh you could see here this is not sustainable. If you just want to be passive and you don't want to even mess around with small caps or international, go equal weight over cap weight over the next two years and send me a Christmas card. uh implied equity valuation by non-bank investors globally. There's materials to the S&P 500. Again, going all the way back to 2000. I mean, I feel like we need more materials, more healthcare, more uh staples. I mean, we got a lot of all of them. More energy. We got a lot of all of them. We're so ready. I mean, it's it's unreal. People like, "How can you possibly top what just happened?" It hasn't even started. I told you when it comes it comes all at once and you get five years worth of irr in five months and people don't know they don't understand the framework but here we go Fed cuts help lessen refi risk for small caps we love that that was part of the original thesis money market aum as a percentage of Bloomberg bond aggregate money demand going down. This is from Scott Granis. Um, I want to check that out a little bit. Retail options call put direction ratio. 10-year yield versus CPI inflation. So, that's trending down.

This is super exciting. Uh and make him orange instead of red. China's most recognizable entrepreneur is back making bold bets and pushing AI. The man is on campus. He is he is an implicit endorsement by Xi Jingping and Co. and he is making things hum. Early days, ladies and gentlemen. Alibaba shares jump after it lands a major major customer for its AI chips. Tech war. Alibaba developed AI processor on par with Nvidia's H20 chip. China bans tech companies from buying Nvidia's AI chips. This is part of the negotiating thing that will create some short-term volatility. uh which is why we booked all those gains in the shortdated stuff and uh and held with smile so wide we could eat a banana sideways every single share of massive amount of a position of stock in Alibaba as long as massive amounts of longerdated premium uh and spreads as well. But um booking all that money for clients I I I'm literally never been happier. I mean, it's just super super happy for them. Alibaba, oh, by the way, including me, which I'm probably one of the largest clients uh doing separately managed account. Uh Alibaba releases next generation Quen 3. I'm not bigger than the institutions in the family offices, but I'm probably the biggest individual client. Probably. Yeah, I got some big Well, there's one guy. Yeah. All right.

How you doing? VF Corporation to sell Dickies to Blueest Star Alliance. They got $600 million in cash. They're using that to pay down debt and do exactly what they promised. Way to go, Bracken. Absolutely delivering. Wait till you see the reaceleration of growth. We've already seen the reaceleration of margins. Now you're going to see the reaceleration of growth. You're going to see, by the way, that pays down a lot of debt, which takes uh refinance risk off the table for years and generates additional free cash flow. Fed lowers rates by quarter point signals more cuts are likely. That's from Timos. $7 trillion of wall of cash. Worry is looming for investors once Fed interest rate cuts start. What does that mean? They're going to be pushed out on the risk curve into equities. Mortgage refinance demand spikes nearly 60% as interest rates drop sharply. Fed open mortgage twist would boost housing, says PIMCO. Federal Reserve may use different tools involving its balance sheet to ease US mortgage costs and stimulate housing, says PIMCO. Reinvesting the roughly $18 billion in current monthly rolloff into new mortgage securities could compress mortgage spreads by as much as.3 percentage point according to PIMCO. PIPCO estimates that an operation mortgage twist approach where the Fed sells legacy mortgage bonds and reinvest proceeds into current securities could push mortgage rates down by as much as a half of a percentage point. This is huge. Let's see who it was over at Pimco. It's just BIMCO. I guess they're not attributing to any one person who I'd like to meet. Uh, home sales are primed to pop if mortgage rates fall to this level. Uh, what are they calling for? 6%. What do you know? We're going to do it by the end of the year. Jacob says QXO can thrive even as giants Home Depot and Lowe's loom over deals. I'm going to meet with Mr. Jacobs next Friday afternoon. Super grateful for that. Excited for that. and um we'll get back to you whether he'll wind up being a guest on the podcast or not. But uh what a what a great opportunity and looking forward to uh uh talking with and learning from the best of the best. US manufacturing output unexpectedly rises on rebound in motor vehicle production manufacturing. How you doing? JP Morgan predicts small caps to lead with 30 to 60% outperformance versus large caps. Thank you for extrapolating the rearview mirror through the windshield. Uh, and welcome to the party, JP Morgan. Why the next winners in the AI boom may not be AI stocks. This is from Vanguard and he's talking about value outperforming as a result. And you can listen to the entire or read the entire interview at Morning Star quote why the next winners in the AI boom may not be AI stocks. We also posted that article on our reads one or two days ago in the New York Times. Uh Joe Davis of Vanguard was quoted in that article making the same case which we've been making for six months. You would be surprised who listens to this podcast. Natural gas is not a bridge to tomorrow. It's the superighway of the future. Comm stock, the fuel behind the future stock market and sentiment results. Here is our article of the week. Bank of America fund manager survey update. On Tuesday, we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America global fund manager survey. This month surveyed 196 institutional managers with 490 billion AUM. Here were the five key points. September saw the largest monthly rotation out of UK equity since April 2004 with positioning moving from a net 2% underweight to a net 20% underweight. Got to get more exposure there beyond GXO. Two, a record 58% of managers now view global equities as undervalued, up from 57% in August. Once again, the most hated rally. Three growth expectations jumped 25% to a net 16% expecting the global economy to weaken compared with a net negative 41% in August marking the biggest monthly increase since October 2024. Four equity allocation among managers rose to a seven-month high. This is long only by the way at a net 28% overweight as managers continue to play catch-up into year end. Positioning remains far from stretch leaving room for further buying and reinforcing our view that lagards will remain remain in favor. And five, energy remains left for dead with fund managers cutting allocation to a net 26% underweight from last month's 16%, the lowest since May 2025 at 1.8 standard deviations below its long-term average. There are plenty of ponies in the pile, two of which we'll touch on today. Energy. We've seen this movie before. At Great Hill Capital, we like to skate to where the puck is going, not to where it's already been. While the market chases the latest AI darlings and shiny objects, we continue to see the unloved, boring corners of the market as hunting grounds ripe with opportunity. Last week, we highlighted the washed out sentiment in consumer staples and two of our favorite names, Hormeell and Dagio. This week, the another sector left for dead stands out for similar reasons, energy. Year-to date, it has returned a meager 4.81%, 81% placing it near the bottom of the barrel alongside healthcare staples and real estate and well behind the S&P at plus 12.33%. Weakness in the energy sector is a movie we have seen and profited from many times before. Take 2020 for example. Energy was coming off the worst performing sector of 2019. Had the lowest S&P waiting on record at just 3.5% and the highest short interest in nearly 20 years and traded at less than half the market multiple. We saw this as a mana from heaven opportunity and bought as many shares of Exxon Mobile as we could get our hands on, which went on to become a multibagger in short order. The point is that some of the best times to invest in any sector, let alone energy, are when it feels the most uncomfortable. Fortunately for us, Mr. Market appears to be serving up one of those opportunities on the silver platter. Sentiment has once again reached left for dead extremes not seen since the pandemic when oil briefly went negative and before that in early 2000s. As we've discussed in previous articles and podcasts, today's setup bears striking parallels to the early 2000s, a period that set the stage for outperformance in small caps, international equities, and value. What gets less attention is that during that same stretch, energy, which is value, quietly became the top performing sector of the decade. Let me repeat that. What gets less attention in that is that during that same stretch, energy quietly became the top performing sector of the decade. Whether we see a repeat or simply a strong run of outperformance, one thing is clear. It pays to be a buyer at these depressed levels. Managers allocations have barely come off the mat from the record low levels seen in May. With the sector currently 26% underweight and 1.8 eight standard deviations below its long-term average. Energy's weight in the S&P 500 has dropped to all-time lows of around 3%, levels not seen since oil went negative during the pandemic. By the way, for those of you who listen, I get it and we're busy. You're golfing, you're walking, you're exercising. Uh I would try one week watching the video cast on YouTube. You're going to get five times amount of value for the same amount of time. Uh, if you can't, listening is better than not. But I mean, visually, I'm I'm a visual learner. Seeing the charts, seeing the balance sheets, seeing the cash flow statements, I mean, it's it's priceless. But, um, grateful for whatever you do, listening is great as well. Energy's weight in the S&P 500 has dropped to an all-time low of 3%, levels not seen since oil went negative during the pandemic. Energy sector as a percent of the S&P 500 down to 3%. I mean, that was such an unbelievable trade. Uh the oil S&P 500 ratio has fallen to nearrecord levels near record lows and with only two historical periods lower 1999 which preceded a generational stretch of energy outperformance and the pandemic when oil went negative. Short interest continues to rise reaching multi-year highs at 13.2%. When everyone piles into one side of the trade and the rubber band to stretch this far against any sector or company that alone is enough to grab our attention. But what makes us even more curious is that while price has taken a beating, fundamentals tell a very different story. Earnings growth in 2026 is expected to reach 17.1%, the third largest of any sector and well above the S&P at 13.7%. Materials, by the way, 17.4%. So, while Mr. market continues to sell off the sector and investors get faked out by short-term headlines. Whether it's next week's weather or supply and demand balances, we think it is completely missing the forest for the trees. Energy, particularly natural gas, is a secular theme driven by structural trends that aren't just here to stay, they are growing by the day. Here's a statement you won't hear anyone out anywhere else. Owning energy today is arguably the most overlooked pick and shovel play on AI. Let me repeat that. Owning energy today is arguably the most overlooked pick and shovel play on AI. Keeping that view in mind, you can imagine how much it makes us smile when Mr. Market punishes these names and serves up bargains based on fleeting weather outlook. So what drives that view? When it comes to AI, many investors today find themselves in the prediction business. They are peering into a magic eightball, paying over a 100 times sales for the Palunteers of the world and guessing which high-flying AI names will be the winners of tomorrow. If AI delivers on its promises, these investors may be rewarded. The reason we say may, not will, is simple. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. All those sorts of noble bleed at those sorts of nosebleleed valuations, you have to ask yourself how many of these rosy scenarios are already baked in. We would go out on a limb and say quite a bit. To us, it's partially reminiscent of Amazon in 2000. The company hit nearly every promise it made and then some, but investors were already paying for those outcomes many years in advance. Even as fundamentals improved over the next couple of years, investors were met with a 90% draw down. We cannot emphasize this enough. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Rather than trying to be a hero and predict winners, we take take a different approach. If AI delivers on everything it has promised, the biggest beneficiaries will be the boring names where nobody's talking about AI. These are areas are currently assigned zero value or benefit from AI. Yet they stand to see a productivity boom and in many cases doubling and tripling of their margins. On the other hand, if AI fails to live up to its lofty promises and proves far less transformative than many companies are betting on, tech stocks will come back down to earth and today's shiny objects will disappear. In that scenario, we would expect a rotation back to everyday cheap, boring stocks. I was sitting in the front of the bus on the way to Dallas talking to this AI expert and um you know he basically said we're nowhere near that. All it does he's like you have to program it properly and it can cut down time and manpower on mundane tasks. That's basically where it is now. Could it become sentient in 5 years? You bet. Will it? Maybe. I mean, full self-driving is is pretty miraculous in my view. Um, but when you ask it to do kind of any type of quality thinking, reasoning in the framework of having an edge, um, what it does is it saves humans hundreds of hours to get to the data that they need to make the decisions that give them an edge. They're not yielding the AIS and the the LLMs are not yielding the edge. They're yielding a massive time saving to put yourself to be at the cusp of having an edge. Uh and that's the key distinction is the time save, not um the replication of of framework and outcome. The good news and the reason we have singled out energy as our top pick and shovel play is that whether AI turns out to be transformational or not, energy is the toll taker. Just to answer the question of AI's impact, a massive bail buildout and the resulting energy demand is required. So in either scenario, energy is the winner. The fact of the matter is that AI needs power as much as a diabet the fact of the matter is that AI needs power just as a di diabetic needs insulin. And we want to be at the forefront of that. Heads we win big, tails we still win. Heads we win big, tails we still win. Goldman Sachs estimates that the data center demand will increase by 165% by 2030 with 60% expected to be powered by natural gas. Data center energy demand is projected to rise from 5% of total US power consumption today to over 10% by 2030. Chat GPT queries are six to 10 times more power intensive as traditional Google searches. After more than a decade of little change, US electricity consumption is set to grow an average rate of 1.7% annually. Here's a great New York Times article from last week making the case that the value names could be some of the biggest beneficiaries. This is the article I was telling you about. I recommend you read it below. This is by Jeff Summer over at the New York Times and you can see the most highlighted parts. Comtock resources update. Okay, so it's had this huge run from 7 to 30. Now it backed off to 16. It's working its way back early days. This is exactly what it did in the early 2000s. And the 10 key points of this are as follows. We've we've highlighted and starred all the most important things from the earnings release and the conference call. If you skip over that, it's it's your disadvantage, but we already know it. So, we're going to get down to the 10 key points. And that is number one, natural gas and oil sales reached 344 million in Q2, up 24% year-over-year despite lower production. Comtock realized $32 per MCF before hedging and $3.06 per MCF after hedging, a significant improvement from last year's $1.65. Most importantly, management remains very bullish on 2026, citing rising demand coming online and direct discussions with major customers about long-term supply agreements with activity expected to ramp up meaningfully in 2026. Comtock continues to have the best-in-class cost structure among gas producers with production costs 47% below the pure average. In Q2, production cost average 80 cents per MCFE, down 3 cents sequentially and 4 cents year-over-year, giving a 74% cash margin. Management expects drilling efficiencies to further reduce DNC costs through the remainder of the year in both the Western and Legacy Hannesville areas. Three management continues to make progress deleveraging the balance sheet, paying down 35 million in debt during the quarter and improving leverage ratio to three times. Comtock ended the quarter with nearly 1.1 billion in liquidity and importantly reiterated that they have zero intentions of issuing equity for the foreseeable future. This is key. reiterated that they have zero intentions of issuing equity for the foreseeable future to further accelerate deleveraging management plans to divest certain non-core properties in 2025 and has already received strong interest as new entrance move into the basin amid higher prices. Love it. Help them out. Four management announced a new partnership with Nextera Energy to explore the development of gas fired power generation assets near the western Hannesville aimed at serving potential data center customers. They believe the location roughly 100 miles from both Houston and the Dallas Metroplex has strong potential for data center development and discussions with prospective customers are already underway. Five, Comtock has begun utilizing horseshoe wells which had which have delivered up to a 35% reduction in drilling costs, averaging $800 per lateral foot compared to $1,240 for a short lateral. The legacy Hannesville inventory now includes 149 future horseshoe locations with management planning nine horseshoe wells in 2025 and 10 in 2026 and no drilling issues reported to date. These drilling cost savings combined with the lowest transportation costs in the industry thanks to highly attractive Gulf access will continue to support comtock's best-in-class cost structure. Six management continues to view the Western Hanesville as some of the best they have ever drilled and never been more encouraged by the opportunity set in the region. The Western Hanesville footprint has expanded to nearly 525,000 net acres with 29 wells drilled to date and 24 currently producing. Management expects the Western Hanesville to yield significantly more resource per section than the Legacy Hannesville. 7. Management now expects to drill 19 wells and turn 13 to sales in 2025 in Western Hanesville and to drill 32 wells and turn 32 sales in Legacy Hannesville. Based on current drilling inventory, Comtock now has over 30 years of drilling based on 2025 activity. 30 years. That's unbelievable. Wow. Oper. And by the way, they only report PV10 years of proved reserves. So 3xit operating cash flow in Q2 was 210 million, up significantly from the 118 million in the same quarter last year. This brings year-to- date operating cash flow to 448 million compared with 300 million at the same point in 2024. N9, thanks to the passage of the one big beautiful bill, Comto expects meaningful benefit on tax rate and does not anticipate any significant tax liability from non-core property sales, further supporting strong cash flow ahead. and 10. The Marquee Marquez gas treating plant began operations in July, effectively doubling Comtock's treating capacity by more than 400 million cubic feet per day. Here's the earnings call with the key highlights. Q&A with key highlights and national oil well Varco update. Here we go, ladies and gentlemen. This is a newer one. 10 key points. National Oil Well of Varco reported second quarter revenues of 2.19 billion, up 4% sequentially and down 1% year-over-year, beating the street consensus by 41 million. Adjusted Ebida declined 10% year-over-year to 252 million or 11.5% of sales compared with 12.7% last year driven by higher tariff related costs and a less favorable sales mix. Two, the energy equipment segment generated revenue of 1.21 21 billion during the quarter, flat year-over-year and up 5% sequentially with adjusted IBIDA 158 million or 131.1% margin up 131 130 basis points yearon year. Most importantly, this marks the segment's 12th consecutive quarter of year-over-year margin expansion. New orders totaled for totaled 420 million, down 557 million year, while the backlog for capital equipment orders stands at 4.3 billion, a slight decline of 31 million year-over-year. Three, management continues to expect offshore to return to growth and reacelerate in 2026 as discussions advanced on multiple deep water programs. While operators have delayed projects and final investment decisions, there are no indications of cancellations. National Oil Well Varco continues to see a healthy pipeline of floating production, storage, and offloading awards, each representing 100 to 700 million in revenue with industry forecast calling for up to 50 FPSOs through the end of the decade. Four cash from operations total 191 million for the quarter with free cash flow came in at 108 million bringing the 12-month free cash flow to 99 million and driving IBIDA to free cash flow conversion rate of 83%. Management continues to implement structural improvements to working capital resulting in 300 basis points year-over-year improvement as a percentage of revenue. Five, management announced a companywide cost reduction initiative targeting more than 100 million in annual savings by the end of 2026, partially offset by tariffs and inflation headwinds. These savings will come from centralizing business processes, lower cost sourcing, facility consolidations, and exciting exiting product lines in markets where returns are insufficient with the latter expected to be accretive to NOV's margins and return on invested capital. Six, National Oil Varco recorded a tariff expense of 11 million during the quarter as it continues to leverage its supply chain manufacturing footprint and opportunities under USMCA to reduce the impact. Unmitigated tariff exposure stands at approximately 300 million annually. Uh management expects tariff related costs to reach 20 to 25 million in Q3 and 25 to 30 million in Q4 after which expansion should stabilize as mitigation and pricing actions take effect. Management 7 management turned 17 returned 176 million of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and buybacks, continuing their pledge to return at least 50% of excess free cash flow year to date. Share purchases total 10.9 million shares for 150 million at an average of $13.76 per share. Give this guy the co gold medal Emmy for buying shares back at the right time versus the other losers who are buying shares back at 100 times sales so they can dump their stock on idiot retail investors that don't realize what's happening to them. uh unlike the retail investors listening to this uh podcast who are absolutely becoming extraordinary investors that are taking the time to understand the weighing machine and the fundamentals behind a business versus the voting machine and just gambling on price based on emotion. Um where were we? Uh uh average cost of 1376 per share while dividends paid year-to- date amount to 135 million. Eight. NOV continues to maintain rock solid balance sheet with 1.08 billion in cash and cash equivalents around 23% of market cap, 1.5 billion available on its primary revolving credit facility and total debt of 1.73 billion with the next maturity not until 2029. This implies a net debt leverage ratio below one times and a gross debt leverage ratio below two times supporting its investment grade credit rating. Nine capital ex let me say that again. Investment grade credit rating nine capital expenders during the quarter total 83 million or just 3.8% of sales bringing the year-to- date capex to 167 million compared with 151 million at the same point last year. Management expects second half capex to be roughly in line with or slightly higher than last year as they continue to prioritize investments with high returns on capital. Music to my ears. You know, if I was going to get a tattoo and I'm not, the first one would be for golf and it would say there is no stroke in golf that benefits from deceleration. That would be tattoo on the left butt cheek. on the right butt cheek, I would tattoo um prioritizing investments with high returns on invested capital or finding jockeyies that prioritize investments with high returns on capital like Bracken, like Jeff Edwards, like Alex Chris, like Joe Sai, etc. For the second half of the year, management sees global activity slowing further, but expects NOV's backlog like Brad Jacobs cubed. Uh NOV's backlog in international tool purchases to support flat to modest sales growth compared with the first half. For Q3 specifically, management expects year-over-year revenues to decline 1 to 3% and adjusted EBID out of range between $230 million to $250 million. Here's all the key points highlighted. We know them. If you don't, it's to your advantage to read them. Uh sentiment kind of in the middle, a little bit greedy. And ah this is important uh because we're going to be closing down pretty soon. Congratulations to all of the new clients that came in intraquarter Q3 with the larger size $5 million plus accounts. And to those existing and to one that up to 50 million by the way, congratulations. And to those Frank uh existing clients who upsize their contributions to their accounts, we will reopen to smaller accounts $1 million again starting October 1st. Those interested in going live on October 1st can begin the onboarding and application process ahead of time. Uh unbelievable amount of people did that in the last week and they've been approved very quickly and we've been able to deploy very quickly.

For communication services, top 30 weights last 60 days revisions up 2% in last 60 days. Uh retail sales we covered beat expectations. Housing starts a little weak. So this is going to be a function of the three cuts. Continuing claims and initial jobless claims better than estimates. That's good. uh fact set earnings growth for Q3 is expected to be 7.6 which means we probably do 10%. And now we are on to the ask me anything questions which we have to get through. Oh, this was from Frederick who's on the site. I'm 16 years old turning 17 next month. got started with value investing when I was 12. Order some merchandise. First thing I did here, he's a US exchange student from Germany. He said first thing he did when he got here was to order some merchandise for me and my dad who's a long-term viewer of your podcast too in Germany. Golf polos for my dad. Uh, thanks for your podcast. Really improve my investing. Could generate much value for me both me and my mom as I help her making investment decisions. Congratulations, man. That's awesome. You can go see Frederick uh on the website. What a rock star. Um Jean Reeling, will Wendy's ever make a comeback? Uh I don't know. When's the last time you ate Wendy's? I mean, does that answer your question? I don't think so. I I don't think yet. I mean, you had Nelson Peltz in there and he couldn't turn the damn thing around. So, if what if Nelson can't do it, I doubt I'm gonna be the one to do it. Um because I'm not gonna waste time trying to replace the CEO. Look, these restaurants are all going to benefit. They're a leveraged play on beef prices coming down. So, Wendy's will probably get a bump, but I think there are much better ways to play it. Um, and you're starting to see, as we had predicted, uh, cattle prices starting to crack. Not today, but in the last couple of weeks, you can see it start came down from 240 to 230 feeders from 370 down to 340. So, this trend should continue. Uh, let's take a look at Wendy's. Well, someone's eating Wendy's because the revenues are maintaining. They're not growing. Margins have been coming down because of the beef. Free cash flow is okay. So, I guess the answer to your question, John, is not John who asked that question. Well, whoever that was. Uh, nice lady. Let's just take a quick look here. For me, it's not yet attractive, but I think you're going to be right on this. I think you're going to be so right because the whole restaurant group is going to rip as beef prices come down. 450 million of cash. 4 billion. This is their problem. They got $4 billion of debt. They got 450 million of cash and they put on a lot of debt. Well, they've always had a lot of debt. All right. Cash flow seems okay. See, income statement. Yeah, it's it's kind of okay. Maybe I'll go have some Wendy's today. Share count's coming down. I kind of like it, John. Uh, not John. whoever sent that in. So, I'm good with it. I don't I I'm not going to do it, but I'm good with it. Good job, ATKR from John Peterson Patterson. Thank you for the top tier idea generation. Would you please look at at core the broken growth stock? It's going to take a while to build the base on at core. A lot of people got hurt in that one. free cash flow declining, revenues declining, margins declining, return on invested capital declining, stock price declining. So tell me what's the turnaround story and I'll tell you whether it makes sense. So you're going to have to listen to a bunch of conference calls. Let's see if the balance sheet if they live another day. But it looks like their mode has been breached. You know, it's a great growth stock. Got 350 million 900 million of debt. That's probably okay. Pre-cash flow is okay. Income statement. Uh let's see. Bringing down the share count. What do they do? Manufacturing and sale of electrical, mechanical, safety and infrastructure product solutions. Uh metal, electrical conduit fittings, plastic pipe fittings, electrical cable, flexible conduit. ah serves various end markets including new construction. Ah I kind of like this business has been around since 1959. ATKR we're going to look at this one. Uh I just want to understand the turnaround but uh TKR I think John I think you're on the money on this but we got to do some work but I think it warrants some work. Um, but we got QXO, so we're probably not going to do anything, but we are going to look at it. Uh, Vana Christristic. Hi Tom. I love your podcast. I listened three months after a friend's recommendation. It's quickly become part of my routine. Thank you. And thank you to to your friend. Uh, what's your outlook on NCL? Royal Caribbean. Problem with NCL. Problem with all these is that they're overlevered from COVID. They had to borrow so much money to stay in business. Looks like this is starting to recover though. I'd rather play it through Disney to be honest with you. Disney's investing a lot in the cruises and you have outs in case the crude cruise business goes a little sideways. This is a binary play on, you know, basically baby boomers aging, travel, and preferences. But, um, I think it's probably a decent bet. Let's just see what they've done to the balance sheet. While we wait for that, we're going to close out some of these because for some reason, computer is running less quickly than I would like. All right, revenues are up, free cash flow is trying to inflct, margins are increasing, so the turnaround seems to be in place. Um, let's see what the balance sheet looks like. Key point for turnarounds is solveny risk. 190 million in cash, 220 million in receivables. And here comes the big number, 11 billion of debt to refinance, which they doubled. right after co it's a large debt load to carry. See what the share count is too. Revenues are hockey sticking. They doubled the share count. They doubled the debt. The stock is down 50%. I think he got a little more upside, but not a ton. So, uh, okay. Not for me. Thank you for welcome. Welcome to the hedge fund tips family. Sam S, hope. And now pay it forward and share it with a friend you care about. Sam S. Hope all is well. What are your thoughts on LEG? I like it. Like it and plat furniture play. little overlevered so it's not like bet the ranch but I think it's I think it's gonna be okay. Um Hank Douglas longtime listener here as always appreciate the weekly wisdom tips. Try to spread the good word on hedge fund tips to friends and family. Thank you very much for that Hank. Uh any thoughts on Orstead as Danish business has undergone some trouble recently. I know Trump hates windmills. Do you see any potential value here? Uh, no. I would not be investing in a windmill business. Um, unless you invest side by side with a bird mortuary or bird funeral homes. Uh, RS Ted D. Now, negative free cash flow. revenues are flat. Probably the leverage balance sheets. This is not I I know it's down a lot. It should be down a lot. Um I mean the policy is not going to change that much in Europe. They'll continue to kill birds, but we're not going to be doing it here for at least four years in the US and they tend to follow uh what makes sense. Usually not out of ideology, but out of economic necessity and it's proven to be ineffective. Uh 4 billion in cash, 11 billion of debt. I mean, it's probably okay. I just don't like the business for that reason. Negative free cash flow is huge. Three billion and negative free I I don't like it. I don't like anything about it. um it might work for you, but it's not going to work for us. Um but but I like the thought process behind the idea. I just don't like the sector. Uh maybe that's, you know, some bias in there, but based on the fund fundamentals, I wouldn't take a bet. If I hated the sector and I love the financials, I might take a bet, but I hate the sector and I hate the financials, so therefore I'm out. Uh Michael Costa curious your thoughts on Craft Hind. We covered that last week. If I had it, I'd probably keep both. Mark Callaway, thanks for all you do. I've profited over 200K from your opinions, not advice on on the podcast. Quickly approaching the minimum requirements to become a client. I can't tell you how many people have become clients in the last year that made all their money listening to the podcast and now have turned it over. and I'm very grateful for those. Um, it's unbelievable. Um, I I did vote for your incredibly talented daughter, Annabelle, for youth athlete of the year. Thank you very much. Was happy to do a small gesture other than sharing your content and saying your appraisal. Thank you. As I'm not a client yet, uh, point me in the right direction. exit strategies for stocks in the portfolio. We always let people know when we're we have no obligation to, but we tend to tell people when we are out of a stock. So, you keep doing what you're doing. Um, and uh, you know, we're we're pretty pretty explicit on that. We have no obligation to do that, but we tend to do it when we're out. We we let people know. We did it many many many times, whether it was Rolls-Royce, Fortnado, a lot of others. uh Austin Marmal, Amazon, Google, Exxon, Wells Fargo, and the list goes on and on. Austin Marmal, huge fan of the show. Been sharing it with my close friends. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. Austin uh communicating Oh, my question is about communicating investment ideas particularly around Moes. When you've done your work yourself, it's easy to gain conviction around a brand name like Vans. But when presenting to someone who has not done the work, how do you convey conviction and brand strength? I don't I don't give a what other people think. All I care about is what I do and what I do for my clients. I'm not I I could care less about convincing other people about my ideas. All I need to do is be right, be on low leverage, and play the time arbitrage game and double and triple over time. And my clients are happy and they add more money and they tell their friends. And that's what I do. convincing other people who don't want to do the work. Let them go chase shiny objects and gamble because soon what what's beautiful about those people, the gamblers, is they think that they're smart. So they wind up making 10x mistake on a stock and because they're so brilliant, they take that money and the next one because of all their intelligence, they put 100% in and they they get wiped out and you never hear from them. I I love on Twitter you see all these trading guys, they just come and go like it like the seasons, man. I mean, they think they're brilliant and then they just wiped out and you see them as Walmart greeters or you see him as police officer. By the way, police officer is noble profession. It's probably an upgrade. Uh 100% upgrade. Uh but you know, it's a complete joke and it's just human nature and uh that's the thing. So don't worry about convincing others. Just focus on doing your work and uh you convince them with your returns. That's that's the only thing that matters. Um, and that's that. What was your process for ascribing value for the brands? I look at the numbers. The numbers tell the whole story. You know, either either you have a moat and you have a high return on capital and you have a long history of producing and the the jockey is a key factor in a lot of the turnarounds that I do. Uh, or you don't and it's a pass. But you're probably pretty new. So, go back and listen to the last hundred or so podcasts and you'll start to get an idea of the framework. I bought NF at 150 for long-term play with the same idea of uh for natural gas. Uh you don't want to buy lowquality names in the natural gas space. That's that's the number one thing I can tell you. New Fortress Energy. This looks like a dump dumpster fire. They haven't generated any positive free cash flow. What What is telling you? Their debt keeps growing. Their margins compressed. They're hugely negative free cash flow. Um they couldn't make money even when the price was way up last year. I mean, hard pass. But uh welcome to the podcast, Ren. And um you'll learn it over time. Uh that's where we all start. Thank you for your market education you put out there. It really helps me understand the bigger picture. Also uncanny how time and time again things you already talked about a year ago are materializing. What's your take on IFF? I love IFFF. I I would consider putting that in kind of the materials bucket. I like it here. All right. Divas Lung Tom great podcast always been listening sharing your podcast for a while. What's your thoughts on Zim? I had an analyst who who lasted for about five minutes who pitched me on Zim after it was up 20x. This is literally where he pitched me right up here. Fortunately, we didn't do anything with it. um not for me. on to the next value investing is genetic and uh that particular person I think will go on to be a very successful entrepreneur because he's a salesman and sales is probably the most important skill as it relates to making money outside the financial services business and for a lot of people in the financial services business that have no investment framework that that matters or or makes a difference. they just have to gather assets and sell. But, um, I always tell young people, if you're getting into the investment business because you think it's going to be the way to make the most money, don't do it. You're not going to compete with people like me. It's it's just not going to happen. I do I do it 24/7. I live, eat, sleep, breathe it. I love it. I never feel like I work a day in this business. Um, go be an entrepreneur. Start and fail two or three times in your 20s with new businesses. By the time you're 30, you'll be worth 10 or 20 million. You'll be calling me up to invest five or 10, and I will I will be happy to do that. In the investment business, you're going to develop your skills over 10 to 15 years, and you're going to make, you know, you're going to make a a good living, but you're not going to make insane amounts of money until your 40s. And um but you will and then you might out out earn all those entrepreneurs who made 10 or 20 million in 10 years uh over time. And it's a skill that no one can ever take away from you. They could take everything from you. They can't take that skill. And it's it's one of the most valuable skills in the world. So if you love it and it's all you want to do 24/7, go into the investment business. If you're just doing it because you think that's how you're going to make the most money, become an entrepreneur. Go fail at a couple businesses. Get your hit. Sell your business. Some of you will make a 100 or 200 million selling your business and uh and more. Uh and then you can invest some of it and give some of it to a professional that does it 24/7 and we will be here when you're ready. Jimmy Jones, does UPS being unionized concern me? Often unions prioritize themselves over the company. You think? Uh yeah, it concerns me, but um it's a negotiation. Boeing is unionized. I think UBS is going to be fine. Uh, that's that. I don't know what that is. Luke M, Flower Foods we covered last week. F L W flower. I'd be more inclined to do Hormel or um even General Mills before I did flower l. This looks like a compounder whose moat has been breached. All right, I'm going to have to get off here pretty soon. I mean, they got, if this is correct, 5 million of cash, 369 of receivables, how much debt, billion free cash flow? I mean, they got some potential balance sheet issues. You might want to double check that. Uh, what are their brands? Again, I would be I'd be doing Hormell or maybe General Mills, English muffins, Wonderbread. I mean, this is the exact opposite stuff. You know, Hormel is all protein. Like, anyone on GLPs are trying to lose weight, the last thing they want is carbs and bread. Not to say that they're not going to eat it because people will, but uh not for me. John Lee Boohoo stock. No, we still have a tiny bit of ASOS. Uh, that's a better play if you're going to play in that dumpster fire of a sector, but that's going to come back. Great podcasting. Your pri prizes to everyone. Unity software. Uh you I don't like software plays cuz I can't handicap the moat with certainty. Just kind of guessing. Uh free cash flow is improving. Revenue is still not showing signs of turning up. So I think you want to see that the stock is up 3x off the bottom. It's kind of late. I mean, let me just see it. I I don't like software. So, if you've been listening for more than three months, I I tend to avoid it. And uh this time would be no different. Doesn't mean it won't work. It might work. Uh York B wants GMED as a healthcare play. I think we covered this a few weeks ago. Yeah, their margins are still sucking wind, but everything else looks better. Let's look at the balance sheet. I think this is medical devices cash debt looks good. Income statement revenues are growing. They must have done a deal. Share growth is how much of this was stockbased comp? Yeah, a little piggy with the equity. I don't like that. Yeah, it's probably okay, but I there are better stocks out there. Um, but thank you for the uh question. Why is 10-centent valued more than Baba? Do you think Baba can go to one trillion market cap? Yes, it can. Uh, and that's temporary. They will overtake 10 cent. That's the second best company in China, not the first. They've been better allocators of capital, but they're in the wrong businesses right now. Uh, it's a new client, Robert. Oh, all in all the news, the stock crash is coming. How do you see it? And how do you protect your customers in the for a crash market? Greetings, Robert. Um, number one, that you have to be burdened by the facts. Okay? And a lot of that's recency bias. We just had a 20% correction. We just had three in five years. The average is one every three and a half years for the last 100 years. Low probability of a crash in the near term. pullback. Sure. Three, five, 8, 10%. That's everyday occurrence, multiple times a year. Um, the way I protect people, we we have in the bucket, we can hedge out and do all that stuff, but that's generally a waste of money. What we do is we buy great businesses with a high margin of safety at the price that we're paying, and our downside is protected, and we do it with very little leverage. And, uh, we sacrifice short-term short-term volatility for long-term rewards. And anyone that tells you you're going to get outperformance without short-term volatility, run the other way. Uh, and we deliver. And, uh, we don't lose clients, which tells you everything you need to know. If anything, it's the opposite. They refer their friends and family, and then they don't just double up, they triple up, and sometimes 10x up after I deliver for them. And that's the way it should be. Uh, they run tests and then when they see the results, they go allin. Thoughts on target? Uh, we we mentioned we kind of like this one. We're not going to do anything with it, but if we had to be in a retailer, we do it. We have retail exposure through Alibaba. CYH from Matthew Tombbo, I got to wrap this up. Uh, all right. If I didn't get to your question this week, I'll keep it in my inbox and we'll cover it next week. I just can't do anymore today. Um, CH might be interesting. They got potential balance sheet problem. Two billion in debt, 37 million of cash. Let's see. But they got $3.2 billion of receivables go up to 131 million. Uh I think you got to just do more work on this. What is this? Uh medical facilities, acute care hospitals. That's generally a shitty business. Um, the one guy did it, I think Rick Scott did it really well with HCA and the other guy, I don't know though, this one looks really interesting. Cy. So this this is the kind of stock that takes a month of work to really get comfortable with the facilities and the unit economics and the growth strategy, urgent care centers, ambulatory centers. Uh the answer is probably. Let me just take a look at the share count here because why is this thing just been a dumpster fire for a long long time? No. $12 billion of debt and 37 million of cash. This is the problem. I mean, it's probably debt secured by the individual building. So, you got to understand that. Is it is it straight debt at holdco or is it each secured by the buildings in which case you know if building by building default doesn't take the whole company out of business but I think what you got here is a real solveny risk uh that the market's pricing in and um but if you can get comfortable on the maturities and the debt situation this is an easy you know tenbagger if it works um but uh a lot of work to do there I think it's a decent find, but I don't think it's a slam dunk. Love your show. Been watching. This is from uh Jack Hazard. Love your show. Been watching since 2022. Always give a like and share it with my friends. Thank you very much. My portfolio is up 150% this year. Thanks to your suggestions. Congratulations. Can't wait to become a client. I'll get there soon. You will. Uh PRMBB, they sell Poland Spring and Deer Park. P RMBB. I'm so addicted to using these ask me anything questions. I really do have to go though. Um, not yet. Too early on PRMBB. All right, let me just see if I can get a couple quick ones in. Uh, Adobe and Regeneron. Adobe, I'm not going to get confidence there. I can't handicap. Regeneron, yes. Um, oh, Martin on Wendy's, same answer. Heidi Beers, Dorfer. Uh, Kagura. I think we covered this one and I think I'm generally okay with it. Trying to get everyone's in. Let's see here. Yeah, it's probably good here. Lynn Johnson, Deck. Uh Starbucks. I love the new CEO. Uh, I just don't think it's a good use of capital because it's going to, you know, it's 50% versus two or three hex. Deckers, we got our VF corps, so we're probably not going to double down. No, I don't like Deckers at these levels. Jean Pierre, that's a new client. New client. Adrian, uh, Cooper from Australia, hi Tom. Thank you for all that you do. You've helped me tremendously materially in terms of lifting my knowledge, but a huge mostly unmentioned benefit. You provide confidence when those of us who know far less about markets than you start to wobble a bit. Your podcast is a source of great reassurance. Thank you. Question. You're welcome. Thank you. Uh like, subscribe, and share. Uh what do you think of CSL Australian Stock Exchange biotech? No, we don't do individual biotechs. Sorry about that, but keep listening. I appreciate you, Luke Proer. Quantum computing. Uh, nah, that's a fad for now. It's going to be huge later, but like buying these speculative stocks is not what we do. But welcome to the podcast. He's been in for a couple of months. Uh, not to say you can't make money doing that. That's not what we do here. And, um, I appreciate the question for trading. All right. This is from NAL Jane. I really have to go for FOR. Shift for payments. Buy PayPal. Don't mess around with these subpar things. F Our R. No, not yet. Uh, Theo AB Inbbe. Now, the only U alcohol company, God speed to you and your family for everything you do. Thank you very much, Theo. Only one we want is Diagio in that space because of the premiumization trend. Um, Anton asks, "What are some of the biggest mistakes you see retail and even institutional investors making?" Same mistakes, chasing fads and not doing their work, being influenced by the short-term voting machine based on emotion versus the long-term weighing machine based on doing real work. No one wants to do real work. They want quick fixes, 60-second sweet candy, and that's going to be your competitive advant advantage. If you're willing to do real work, you're going to get real results. You're going to have a durable uh incredible outcome, and that's what we wish for you. So, with that said, we'll be back next week, same time, same place. Actually, we'll be from New York. Uh maybe a day early because I got to do something in Greenwich on Thursday. Um in the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Goodbye.
