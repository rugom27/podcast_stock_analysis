We got a lot of great stuff to cover this week, but as always, family first. Uh Annabelle had an impressive weekend at the Winter Age Group Championships. She swam a remarkable 211 in her 200 IM, securing the top spot in the nation in that event. Additionally, she broke the two-minute barrier in her 200yard freestyle. She further solidified her number one ranking lead in the 500yard freestyle with a time of 516. She went 28 seconds in the 50-yard backstroke and in the relays instead of swimming backstroke. Her coach made her anchor in both the 200yard medley relay and the 200yard freestyle relay. and both times she delivered by clocking 24 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle finish. As a result of her outstanding swims this weekend, Annabelle has now taken the top spot on the IMX leaderboard on USA swimming, which ranks swimmers by age across the nation based on their versatility in all strokes. So, congratulations to Annabelle. There's her top number one ranking 11year-old in the country. super excited. Uh that's the family after her meet. Uh and there she is at her new school Christmas"

No one wanted it in September of last year at 18 and 19 bucks when I went on Vney and Co. and Vney looked at me like I had three heads. Now it's up double. This is going to work higher over time. Consolidating parabolic gains in the short term. National Oil Well, Varco, uh, up 50% off the lows. Early days, ladies and gentlemen. This is going to be a multi-year play on energy. Fizer just getting started here. Uh short-term noise with nervous sellside people into year end with their bonuses. And uh this is going to be a perfect play. 7% yield for 2020 six easing cycle defensive healthc care lowest relative valuation in 25 years. generational opportunity. PayPal, record- free cash flow, revenue growing, margins increasing, and these sellside idiots can't get out of their way. This is these are the exact same idiots that were downgrading Alibaba at $60 a share. This thing is a cash flow monster. Alex Chris is delivering everything he said he would do. And this thing's going and they just applied to be a bank, which is another story, which is what SoFi did. And I'm telling you, this is a hundred times better business than SoFi will ever be in their wildest, wetest dreams. And by the way, you do not have a CEO that the minute the stock goes up is going to dump a $2 billion equity offering on your head like you see every time SoFi stock pops up, not drops a couple billion dollars on the retail investor's head. So, people just don't get it, but they'll eventually figure it out. In the short term, the market's a voting machine based on emotion, in the long term, it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals. And while everyone was bitching and moaning about PayPal is not moving, we were in the market buying it like crazy this week. So, thank you very much, Cellside. You're the same that gave us the opportunity in Alibaba and we have sent you Christmas cards because you made us a boatload of money off of your calls enabling us to get a ton of stock at cheap prices. Uh Papa John's pizza, wait till those dividend checks come from Trump. Right now they're going to the military. $1,776. Uh that's a lot of people. That money goes straight into consumer discretionary. Uh and uh I think that if the Supreme Court votes down the um the tariffs, he's just going to say he's not going to give it back to the foreign countries. He's going to just pay it all out in $2,000 dividend checks. And then he's going to work around the Supreme Court decision using other laws to still keep doing the tariffs on top of it. But the money he already collected, he's not returning that. He's just going to dividend it out. companies, restaurant companies that have been left for dead, consumer discretionary are going to boom. Uh G, uh QXO, that's Brad Jacob's new vehicle. I'm going to see him again"

You'll get to 30 and you're up 50%.

It's always nice to see green on your screen. Dow up 250, NASDAQ up 170. Tom Hayes joining me now. Why the rally today, Tom? What's behind it? >> Well, t the season to be jolly, Stu. Uh, Santa comes to town the 15th of the month on average in December since 1950. We tend to rally from the 15th to the 30th of the month. City Bank was out this morning calling for a 13% rally in 2026. That mimics Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs. It's on the basis of a supportive Fed. We have the two Kevins. Kevin Walsh being the proper dove is good for equities. Uh, excuse me, Kevin Hasset being the proper dove. And Kevin Worsh being good for the bond market. He is a hawk in Dove's clothing. So, the market likes some potential certainty coming that way. And tax laws selling season is in the rear view mirror. >> Well, that's always good to hear. All right, Tom. Here's this. The core theme in 2026 will be a rotation out of Mac 7. You wrote that. Justify it. >> Yeah, we've been talking about this for a few months and it's starting to play out in spades. You have decelerating earnings growth and a very high multiple in the MAG 7. You have accelerating earnings growth and a very low multiple in the unmnificent 493. Midterm election years tend to be volatile and choppy. Average return for the S&P up 2.4%. What outperforms in those periods is defensives and healthcare, the unmagnificent 493. I think we're going to see a bid in energy as well, which is going to be surprising to a lot of people. Commercials have been a aggressive buyers of energy futures. They are always early and they are always right. So, expect slightly higher energy prices in 2026. So, it's going to be cyclicals, it's going to be industrials, it's going to be defensives, it's going to be less pronounced in tech taking a breather in 2026. Investors want to see a return on invested capital that they're not seeing yet. So, they're going elsewhere. >> Okay. We're trying to stick as positive as we can. So, we're looking at City Bank thinking the stock market will go up 13% in 2026. We'll stick with that. Tom Hayes, thanks for being here. We'll see you again later. And we got a new poll that shows President >> And we're back. And I want to uh go through our quotes of the week here uh from Warren Buffett. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. That is a core tenant here at Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. For those of you been around for a while, um, you know, I had one client who I love, uh, super unbelievably successful guy, uh, called"

Kevin Walsh being the proper dove is good for equities. Uh, excuse me, Kevin Hasset being the proper dove. And Kevin Worsh being good for the bond market. He is a hawk in Dove's clothing. So, the market likes some potential certainty coming that way. And tax laws selling season is in the rear view mirror. >> Well, that's always good to hear. All right, Tom. Here's this. The core theme in 2026 will be a rotation out of Mac 7. You wrote that. Justify it. >> Yeah, we've been talking about this for a few months and it's starting to play out in spades. You have decelerating earnings growth and a very high multiple in the MAG 7. You have accelerating earnings growth and a very low multiple in the unmnificent 493. Midterm election years tend to be volatile and choppy. Average return for the S&P up 2.4%. What outperforms in those periods is defensives and healthcare, the unmagnificent 493. I think we're going to see a bid in energy as well, which is going to be surprising to a lot of people. Commercials have been a aggressive buyers of energy futures.

Investors want to see a return on invested capital that they're not seeing yet. So, they're going elsewhere. >> Okay. We're trying to stick as positive as we can. So, we're looking at City Bank thinking the stock market will go up 13% in 2026. We'll stick with that. Tom Hayes, thanks for being here. We'll see you again later. And we got a new poll that shows President >> And we're back. And I want to uh go through our quotes of the week here uh from Warren Buffett. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. That is a core tenant here at Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. For those of you been around for a while, um, you know, I had one client who I love, uh, super unbelievably successful guy, uh, called in about this stock and I and I said, you know, we just had a monster year. And he said, well, what about this one? Why isn't this one moving? I said, well, let me ask you a question. I said, um, is the business doing better this year than last year? Um, not the price. Is the business doing better this year than last year? And he said, \"Yeah, it it is.\" And uh uh you know, price always catches up to fundamentally it catches up and it catches down.

And he said, well, what about this one? Why isn't this one moving? I said, well, let me ask you a question. I said, um, is the business doing better this year than last year? Um, not the price. Is the business doing better this year than last year? And he said, \"Yeah, it it is.\" And uh uh you know, price always catches up to fundamentally it catches up and it catches down. And um uh so he's like, \"Yep, I got it.\" So, he's been with me for a long time and been through a few of these and then seen them take off and uh and that was a lot of fun. Uh John Templeton, to buy when others are despondently sell and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit. And that is part of our core framework is we like to buy the highest quality assets in the most dislocated and hated areas of the markets and then sell them when everyone wants them and help them out. So I want to go through a bunch of the names that we've talked about on the podcast over time, many of which uh we have held or hold uh and go through it. This one is news, ladies and gentlemen. XBI, the biotech basket has now more than doubled off the lows here. You see it's just gone parabolic this year. Um, we took profits and not because we don't think it's going higher. I do think it's going uh probably another 40 50% higher, but we had to make room for a new position in the healthc care sector. Yes, a third position in the healthcare sector. And the only way to do it was to boot this out. And it just comes down to irr from here. You know, maybe it does 40 50% more over the next 3 years. Instead, we replaced it with a position we believe can be a triple three to four bagger uh in the next uh you know our normal time range, you know, three, four, five years. And we're super excited about that. We have put a mon monster pretty big position uh on it. And uh we'll be releasing that sometime after the new year after all new clients are in and fully positioned. Uh we'll go public with that um uh long-term holding idea.
