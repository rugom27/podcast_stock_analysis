We got a lot of great stuff to cover this week, but as always, family first. Uh Annabelle had an impressive weekend at the Winter Age Group Championships. She swam a remarkable 211 in her 200 IM, securing the top spot in the nation in that event. Additionally, she broke the two-minute barrier in her 200yard freestyle. She further solidified her number one ranking lead in the 500yard freestyle with a time of 516. She went 28 seconds in the 50-yard backstroke and in the relays instead of swimming backstroke. Her coach made her anchor in both the 200yard medley relay and the 200yard freestyle relay. and both times she delivered by clocking 24 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle finish. As a result of her outstanding swims this weekend, Annabelle has now taken the top spot on the IMX leaderboard on USA swimming, which ranks swimmers by age across the nation based on their versatility in all strokes. So, congratulations to Annabelle. There's her top number one ranking 11year-old in the country. super excited. Uh that's the family after her meet. Uh and there she is at her new school Christmas"

Uh, Santa comes to town the 15th of the month on average in December since 1950. We tend to rally from the 15th to the 30th of the month. City Bank was out this morning calling for a 13% rally in 2026. That mimics Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs. It's on the basis of a supportive Fed. We have the two Kevins. Kevin Walsh being the proper dove is good for equities. Uh, excuse me, Kevin Hasset being the proper dove. And Kevin Worsh being good for the bond market. He is a hawk in Dove's clothing. So, the market likes some potential certainty coming that way. And tax laws selling season is in the rear view mirror. >> Well, that's always good to hear. All right, Tom. Here's this. The core theme in 2026 will be a rotation out of Mac 7. You wrote that. Justify it. >> Yeah, we've been talking about this for a few months and it's starting to play out in spades. You have decelerating earnings growth and a very high multiple in the MAG 7. You have accelerating earnings growth and a very low multiple in the unmnificent 493. Midterm election years tend to be volatile and choppy. Average return for the S&P up 2.4%. What outperforms in those periods is defensives and healthcare, the unmagnificent 493. I think we're going to see a bid in energy as well, which is going to be surprising to a lot of people. Commercials have been a aggressive buyers of energy futures. They are always early and they are always right. So, expect slightly higher energy prices in 2026.

Here is the uh Sloomer data from RBC thanks to our friends over there. So yeah, big move off the bottom. Probably consolidating a little bit up here.

You know, I mean, look, there's there's a very strong aspect of the inflation calls over the last 5 years where you could say always wrong, never in doubt. I think he's moderated in recent months and he has a chance to go out as a champion if he does one more cut and get away with the murder that he caused. a lot of banks, a lot of people by missing it. It's no inflation. Then he had to go too fast, too aggressive. Uh I I think he's got a chance to win, but the point is Wars will be the same thing. He's going to say, \"I'll do whatever you say.\" And then he's going to get in and he's going to be king and he's going to do whatever he wants. And he's an academic. And um I think the market is underestimating that risk right now. Uh the bond market will love it because it'll feel that the independence is intact.

But, uh, that's what I would that that that could be the biggest kind of mix in 2026 to watch out for cuz there's a lot of pressure around Trump to put in Wars because I think Wars can be controlled uh, versus Hasset is going to be more dovish and you know the the perception is is more inclined to do what Trump has been a proponent of since the day he was born as a real estate guy, which is lower rates. So, uh I think that we do if we ever want to bring debt to GDP down, I think we have to run growth hotter than normal, which is means inflation is going to run above trend, aka 3% is the new 2%.

Number one, for the first time since Q4 of 2023, Boeing generated positive free cash flow coming in at 238 million compared to a quarterly outflow of 1.96 billion last year. The improvement came from a higher commercial deliveries and better working capital both year and sequentially.

This is like um I have no interest in this. Uh thanks for the question, Gregory. Let's see. All right. Here's a whole 10-page question about whether the election cycle still works. No one cares. We underwrite companies on an individual basis. If two filters, number one is if JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy the entire company with one catch, they'd be the debt financing, I'd have to be the equity financing with 100% of my net worth. So, if it works, the equity slug is small. I make 20x on my money. If it doesn't work, I'm applying as a greeter for Walmart. Uh, if we wouldn't do that deal, we won't be we won't buy even one share. Second filter is if I was to walk into the board of directors and offer to buy the entire company at the price that it was quoted in the public markets today, would they call security because they thought I was out of my mind to make such a low offer? If the answer is no, they would entertain the offer. We won't do the deal. So, doesn't meet these criteria, we are not interested. Uh this is Rahul wants to invest. Uh we'll be in touch.
