[00:00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:00:03] Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:00:05] 322nd video cast podcast for the week
[00:00:08] ending December 18th, 2025. We got a lot
[00:00:11] of great stuff to cover this week, but
[00:00:13] as always, family first. Uh Annabelle
[00:00:16] had an impressive weekend at the Winter
[00:00:19] Age Group Championships. She swam a
[00:00:21] remarkable 211 in her 200 IM, securing
[00:00:25] the top spot in the nation in that
[00:00:27] event. Additionally, she broke the
[00:00:29] two-minute barrier in her 200yard
[00:00:31] freestyle. She further solidified her
[00:00:33] number one ranking lead in the 500yard
[00:00:37] freestyle with a time of 516. She went
[00:00:41] 28 seconds in the 50-yard backstroke and
[00:00:44] in the relays instead of swimming
[00:00:45] backstroke. Her coach made her anchor in
[00:00:48] both the 200yard medley relay and the
[00:00:50] 200yard freestyle relay. and both times
[00:00:54] she delivered by clocking 24 seconds in
[00:00:56] the 50-yard freestyle finish. As a
[00:00:59] result of her outstanding swims this
[00:01:01] weekend, Annabelle has now taken the top
[00:01:03] spot on the IMX leaderboard on USA
[00:01:07] swimming, which ranks swimmers by age
[00:01:10] across the nation based on their
[00:01:12] versatility in all strokes. So,
[00:01:15] congratulations to Annabelle. There's
[00:01:18] her top number one ranking 11year-old in
[00:01:21] the country. super excited. Uh that's
[00:01:23] the family after her meet. Uh and there
[00:01:27] she is at her new school Christmas
[00:01:31] concert. I went to see her singing as
[00:01:33] did Caitlyn. Uh there's another picture
[00:01:36] from the event and really proud and uh
[00:01:41] uh that was at her school uh and so on
[00:01:44] and uh and Mimi's doing a great job. So
[00:01:47] we got a lot of great stuff to cover
[00:01:49] today. Uh, first I want to thank Payton
[00:01:52] Jennings for having me on Fox Business
[00:01:55] Varnian Co. Talking Markets. We'll
[00:01:58] listen in here. Yes, it's Monday
[00:01:59] morning. It's always nice to see green
[00:02:01] on your screen. Dow up 250, NASDAQ up
[00:02:04] 170. Tom Hayes joining me now. Why the
[00:02:06] rally today, Tom? What's behind it?
[00:02:10] >> Well, t the season to be jolly, Stu. Uh,
[00:02:13] Santa comes to town the 15th of the
[00:02:15] month on average in December since 1950.
[00:02:18] We tend to rally from the 15th to the
[00:02:20] 30th of the month. City Bank was out
[00:02:23] this morning calling for a 13% rally in
[00:02:26] 2026. That mimics Morgan Stanley,
[00:02:29] Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs. It's on
[00:02:31] the basis of a supportive Fed. We have
[00:02:33] the two Kevins. Kevin Walsh being the
[00:02:36] proper dove is good for equities. Uh,
[00:02:39] excuse me, Kevin Hasset being the proper
[00:02:41] dove. And Kevin Worsh being good for the
[00:02:44] bond market. He is a hawk in Dove's
[00:02:48] clothing. So, the market likes some
[00:02:50] potential certainty coming that way. And
[00:02:53] tax laws selling season is in the rear
[00:02:55] view mirror.
[00:02:56] >> Well, that's always good to hear. All
[00:02:58] right, Tom. Here's this. The core theme
[00:03:00] in 2026 will be a rotation out of Mac 7.
[00:03:05] You wrote that. Justify it.
[00:03:08] >> Yeah, we've been talking about this for
[00:03:09] a few months and it's starting to play
[00:03:11] out in spades. You have decelerating
[00:03:14] earnings growth and a very high multiple
[00:03:17] in the MAG 7. You have accelerating
[00:03:20] earnings growth and a very low multiple
[00:03:22] in the unmnificent 493. Midterm election
[00:03:26] years tend to be volatile and choppy.
[00:03:29] Average return for the S&P up 2.4%.
[00:03:33] What outperforms in those periods is
[00:03:36] defensives and healthcare, the
[00:03:37] unmagnificent 493. I think we're going
[00:03:40] to see a bid in energy as well, which is
[00:03:43] going to be surprising to a lot of
[00:03:44] people. Commercials have been a
[00:03:46] aggressive buyers of energy futures.
[00:03:49] They are always early and they are
[00:03:51] always right. So, expect slightly higher
[00:03:54] energy prices in 2026. So, it's going to
[00:03:56] be cyclicals, it's going to be
[00:03:57] industrials, it's going to be
[00:03:58] defensives, it's going to be less
[00:04:00] pronounced in tech taking a breather in
[00:04:04] 2026. Investors want to see a return on
[00:04:07] invested capital that they're not seeing
[00:04:09] yet. So, they're going elsewhere.
[00:04:10] >> Okay. We're trying to stick as positive
[00:04:12] as we can. So, we're looking at City
[00:04:14] Bank thinking the stock market will go
[00:04:15] up 13% in 2026. We'll stick with that.
[00:04:19] Tom Hayes, thanks for being here. We'll
[00:04:20] see you again later. And we got a new
[00:04:22] poll that shows President
[00:04:25] >> And we're back. And I want to uh go
[00:04:29] through our quotes of the week here uh
[00:04:32] from Warren Buffett. Price is what you
[00:04:35] pay. Value is what you get. That is a
[00:04:37] core tenant here at Hedge Fund Tips with
[00:04:40] Tom Hayes. For those of you been around
[00:04:42] for a while, um, you know, I had one
[00:04:45] client who I love, uh, super
[00:04:47] unbelievably successful guy, uh, called
[00:04:51] in about this stock and I and I said,
[00:04:53] you know, we just had a monster year.
[00:04:55] And he said, well, what about this one?
[00:04:57] Why isn't this one moving? I said, well,
[00:04:59] let me ask you a question. I said, um,
[00:05:03] is the business doing better this year
[00:05:07] than last year?
[00:05:09] Um,
[00:05:11] not the price. Is the business doing
[00:05:13] better this year than last year? And he
[00:05:15] said, "Yeah, it it is." And uh uh you
[00:05:18] know, price always catches up to
[00:05:21] fundamentally it catches up and it
[00:05:23] catches down. And um uh so he's like,
[00:05:26] "Yep, I got it." So, he's been with me
[00:05:29] for a long time and been through a few
[00:05:31] of these and then seen them take off and
[00:05:33] uh and that was a lot of fun. Uh John
[00:05:36] Templeton, to buy when others are
[00:05:38] despondently sell and to sell when
[00:05:40] others are euphorically buying takes the
[00:05:43] greatest courage but provides the
[00:05:44] greatest profit. And that is part of our
[00:05:46] core framework is we like to buy the
[00:05:49] highest quality assets in the most
[00:05:52] dislocated and hated areas of the
[00:05:54] markets and then sell them when everyone
[00:05:56] wants them and help them out. So I want
[00:05:59] to go through a bunch of the names that
[00:06:01] we've talked about on the podcast over
[00:06:03] time, many of which uh we have held or
[00:06:05] hold uh and go through it. This one is
[00:06:08] news, ladies and gentlemen. XBI, the
[00:06:11] biotech basket has now more than doubled
[00:06:14] off the lows here. You see it's just
[00:06:15] gone parabolic this year. Um, we took
[00:06:19] profits and not because we don't think
[00:06:21] it's going higher. I do think it's going
[00:06:23] uh probably another 40 50% higher, but
[00:06:27] we had to make room for a new position
[00:06:32] in the healthc care sector. Yes, a third
[00:06:36] position in the healthcare sector. And
[00:06:38] the only way to do it was to boot this
[00:06:40] out. And it just comes down to irr from
[00:06:43] here. You know, maybe it does 40 50%
[00:06:45] more over the next 3 years. Instead, we
[00:06:48] replaced it with a position we believe
[00:06:50] can be a triple three to four bagger uh
[00:06:54] in the next uh you know our normal time
[00:06:56] range, you know, three, four, five
[00:06:58] years. And we're super excited about
[00:07:01] that. We have put a mon monster pretty
[00:07:05] big position uh on it. And uh we'll be
[00:07:09] releasing that sometime after the new
[00:07:11] year after all new clients are in and
[00:07:14] fully positioned. Uh we'll go public
[00:07:17] with that um uh long-term holding idea.
[00:07:21] But we want to make sure all the new
[00:07:22] people coming in for this quarter are
[00:07:25] fully positioned because it's uh uh it's
[00:07:28] not like a a small cap like Cooper was,
[00:07:30] but it is a small midcap couple billion
[00:07:34] dollar company and we think has a
[00:07:36] massive amounts of upside. And I met a
[00:07:38] new friend here who's a competitor and
[00:07:42] uh he showed me his whole factory and
[00:07:45] operations this week. I walked through
[00:07:47] and um uh kind of explained how the
[00:07:50] industry works, answered my questions
[00:07:53] about uh the industry in general and and
[00:07:56] some things I wanted to know. And um uh
[00:07:59] we're we're super excited about that.
[00:08:01] But we can't just have a million
[00:08:02] positions because you're not going to
[00:08:04] dramatically outperform if you start
[00:08:05] getting uh too many positions. So we
[00:08:08] took profits on this. Uh again, we think
[00:08:10] it can go higher. We also trimmed a
[00:08:12] little bit um uh not a ton because we do
[00:08:16] think this one's going this one's going
[00:08:18] to go a lot higher than another 40 or
[00:08:19] 50%. Uh which is uh Albamarl. This
[00:08:24] thing's up almost triple off the bottom
[00:08:26] now. So we took some profits. Think it's
[00:08:28] going to consolidate for a little while
[00:08:30] but this is going a lot higher over
[00:08:31] time. So we still have a a core position
[00:08:33] in that. Um so just want to kind of go
[00:08:36] through these. Uh Albamaro building this
[00:08:39] is a weekly basis. So, I'm going to I'm
[00:08:40] doing this as an exercise because there
[00:08:42] are a lot of new listeners and I want to
[00:08:44] show you guys what it means to zoom out.
[00:08:47] So, we're going to look at what I
[00:08:48] consider a short-term chart, which is
[00:08:50] only the last 10 years, and then we'll
[00:08:52] go into a longer term chart, which is
[00:08:54] the last 30 years. Uh, but this is a
[00:08:56] normal consolidation. Uh, I love, you
[00:08:59] know, we did a article on Advanced Auto
[00:09:02] Parts a few weeks ago talking about what
[00:09:04] they've been doing and everything else
[00:09:05] and like there's some credit card
[00:09:07] nonsense noise out in the short term
[00:09:10] because 3 days the credit card sales
[00:09:12] were down and all these idiot sellside
[00:09:14] analysts are like, "Oh my god." You
[00:09:17] know, look, um, all I can tell you is
[00:09:22] this.
[00:09:23] The same company that downgraded PayPal
[00:09:27] this week at $60.
[00:09:30] Okay. Is the same company that upgraded
[00:09:34] Alibaba at $320 and downgraded Alibaba
[00:09:38] at $60 when we were buying it until the
[00:09:42] our fingers bled all over the keyboard.
[00:09:44] We were buying so much. So, um, we loved
[00:09:48] seeing the downgrade from Morgan Stanley
[00:09:50] this week on PayPal.
[00:09:53] uh super excited because uh they made us
[00:09:56] so much money downgrading the stock at
[00:09:59] 60 so we could get our hands on
[00:10:01] unlimited numbers of shares uh and and
[00:10:04] benefit from from their short-term
[00:10:06] folly. Uh and that's what we try to do
[00:10:09] is we look under the curtain. So
[00:10:11] Albamout still plenty to go but that's
[00:10:13] just three bagger off the bottom nearly
[00:10:15] is uh that's a lot in a short period of
[00:10:18] time. So it's going to consolidate and
[00:10:20] we wanted to reap some of the benefits.
[00:10:22] Uh Boeing up big. I mean was 130 in
[00:10:27] April. Uh now it's you know got up to
[00:10:29] 250. It's back over 200. This is
[00:10:31] long-term play duopoly. We love it.
[00:10:34] BABA. Everyone's like, "What's happening
[00:10:35] to the BABA?" I don't know. It's gone
[00:10:37] straight the f up and now it's
[00:10:39] consolidating gains like like stocks do
[00:10:41] when they go straight up in a short
[00:10:43] period of time. So chillax, ladies and
[00:10:45] gentlemen. We took off, as you know, all
[00:10:47] of our options six to 7x on the spreads.
[00:10:50] Uh but we we have kept our 100% of our
[00:10:54] position and uh no change there. Uh
[00:10:56] Baxter's coming off the lows here. We
[00:10:59] love this one in 2026. Defensives,
[00:11:01] healthc care, staples are going to do
[00:11:04] the best in the typically the most
[00:11:05] volatile year of the four-year cycle and
[00:11:08] we're excited to see that. Dividend
[00:11:10] payers in an even easing cycle. That
[00:11:12] whole group will go. BU's just coming
[00:11:15] off the mat. That's up almost double off
[00:11:16] the lows. Um, we haven't talked a lot
[00:11:19] about that because that was our our
[00:11:21] Chinese play for people who were not
[00:11:23] clients with us uh that got the lows in
[00:11:26] Baba and BU was a lagard. Um, and it's
[00:11:30] it's been a great one and um uh it was
[00:11:33] just a way to get people into China that
[00:11:35] missed the the Baba train. Uh Crown
[00:11:38] Castle, this is going to be a winner in
[00:11:40] 2026.
[00:11:42] Uh we've gone did an article a couple of
[00:11:44] weeks ago. dividend payer, pure play,
[00:11:48] paying down debt, sold off the
[00:11:50] unprofitable B business that was sucking
[00:11:52] all the cash. We love this play. Cooper
[00:11:54] Standard straight up. I mean, you all
[00:11:56] have been with me for a while. $510
[00:12:00] initial basis in May of 2022 when we
[00:12:02] came out on the claiming countdown on
[00:12:04] Fox Business. Things been straight up to
[00:12:07] went up to 40. Eight bagger. Now it's at
[00:12:09] 35 headed to 100. This thing's going to
[00:12:12] earn over $10 at the top of this cycle a
[00:12:14] couple years out. Uh, and the only
[00:12:16] question is whether it's a 10 or 20
[00:12:17] multiple excited comtock resources has
[00:12:20] been straight up. So, you're going to
[00:12:21] see a lot of these and be like, should I
[00:12:22] get out? They've moved so much. We're
[00:12:24] going to look at the monthly chart in a
[00:12:25] little bit and you're going to see how
[00:12:27] most of these haven't even begun even
[00:12:29] though they're up double and triple from
[00:12:30] where we started talking about them on
[00:12:32] the podcast. Uh, Dagio, this is going to
[00:12:34] be a 2026 play. Defensives, dividend
[00:12:38] payers, uh, staples in volatility. We
[00:12:42] absolutely love this here. Uh, play on
[00:12:45] the premiumization, people drinking less
[00:12:47] and drinking better, higher margin
[00:12:50] stuff. Disney, I'm taking the kids next
[00:12:52] week. Barring rain, we're going on
[00:12:54] Christmas Day. That's what they wanted
[00:12:56] to do. They make the calls. Uh, so
[00:12:59] that'll be fun. And, uh, Disney's just
[00:13:03] getting started. Uh, I mean, look, it's
[00:13:05] up off $85 basis, but it's it's it's got
[00:13:08] a long runway ahead. Estee Lauder has
[00:13:12] been a rocket ship off the lows. already
[00:13:13] doubled off the lows, just getting
[00:13:15] started. This is a long-term play. Uh
[00:13:17] Etsy cash flow's been strong. Stock is
[00:13:20] kind of consolidating here, waiting for
[00:13:23] some certainty from the new CEO, uh but
[00:13:26] continues to generate cash. They just
[00:13:27] authorize a huge buyback. So, we're
[00:13:30] comfortable there. Uh GenerRack, you
[00:13:33] know, continues to do exactly what it
[00:13:35] does every cycle. Has a huge run, then
[00:13:38] it works its way higher just like we're
[00:13:40] doing here. Then it consolidates back
[00:13:43] and and then it has its final parabolic
[00:13:45] move every five years. No change here.
[00:13:47] Still the leader in home standby
[00:13:49] generators and a monster call option on
[00:13:51] the data center play. They've got a half
[00:13:53] a billion dollar backlog on that as
[00:13:55] well. Canada Goose continues to provide
[00:13:58] record free cash flow, record revenues,
[00:14:00] familyowned.
[00:14:02] You know, it's doing more revenues and
[00:14:04] more free cash flow than it was up here
[00:14:06] at $50 and $70 a share. It's at 14. They
[00:14:09] rejected a $15 buyout or whatever it
[00:14:11] was. This thing will work higher over
[00:14:13] time. We love it. It's a play on the
[00:14:15] China recovery and it's going well.
[00:14:17] China luxury is going well. GXO
[00:14:19] Logistics, yes, it's doubled off the the
[00:14:22] lows from April and yes, it's just
[00:14:25] getting started. We did a full 1-hour
[00:14:27] interview, 45minute interview with the
[00:14:29] new CEO, Patrick Keller. Brad Jacobs
[00:14:33] finally stepped down as executive
[00:14:34] chairman as he has always done. Uh, and
[00:14:37] in United Rentals, I think after he
[00:14:40] stepped down as chairman, uh, I think it
[00:14:43] went up another 30 or 40 bags. So, um,
[00:14:47] uh, for those of you who think this
[00:14:48] story, Brad is stepping down, uh, for
[00:14:52] any other reason than to focus on QXO,
[00:14:54] you're strongly mistaken. He's stepping
[00:14:55] down because he feels confident he can
[00:14:57] step down now. It's in good hands. And
[00:14:59] uh and this story can just start to rip
[00:15:02] in the US with Patrick Keller at the
[00:15:04] helm from DHL, CEO of North America. Uh
[00:15:09] Hormell again getting ready for the
[00:15:11] defensive play in 2026. Dividend payers
[00:15:14] staples protein play. Skippies Planters
[00:15:18] uh Spam for those of you who eat Msubi,
[00:15:21] which is fake sushi with ham on it.
[00:15:24] That's a West Coast thing. West Coast.
[00:15:27] Uh,
[00:15:28] you got your Hormel. We're happy about
[00:15:30] that one. Intel has been a rocket ship
[00:15:32] this year. Double off the lows. No one
[00:15:34] wanted it in September of last year at
[00:15:36] 18 and 19 bucks when I went on Vney and
[00:15:38] Co. and Vney looked at me like I had
[00:15:40] three heads. Now it's up double. This is
[00:15:42] going to work higher over time.
[00:15:44] Consolidating parabolic gains in the
[00:15:46] short term. National Oil Well, Varco,
[00:15:50] uh, up 50% off the lows. Early days,
[00:15:53] ladies and gentlemen. This is going to
[00:15:54] be a multi-year play on energy. Fizer
[00:15:58] just getting started here. Uh short-term
[00:16:01] noise with nervous sellside people into
[00:16:04] year end with their bonuses. And uh this
[00:16:07] is going to be a perfect play. 7% yield
[00:16:10] for 2020 six easing cycle defensive
[00:16:14] healthc care lowest relative valuation
[00:16:16] in 25 years. generational opportunity.
[00:16:19] PayPal, record- free cash flow, revenue
[00:16:22] growing, margins increasing, and these
[00:16:24] sellside idiots can't get out of their
[00:16:26] way. This is these are the exact same
[00:16:28] idiots that were downgrading Alibaba at
[00:16:31] $60 a share. This thing is a cash flow
[00:16:34] monster. Alex Chris is delivering
[00:16:35] everything he said he would do. And this
[00:16:38] thing's going and they just applied to
[00:16:39] be a bank, which is another story, which
[00:16:41] is what SoFi did. And I'm telling you,
[00:16:43] this is a hundred times better business
[00:16:46] than SoFi will ever be in their wildest,
[00:16:48] wetest dreams. And by the way, you do
[00:16:51] not have a CEO that the minute the stock
[00:16:54] goes up is going to dump a $2 billion
[00:16:57] equity offering on your head like you
[00:16:59] see every time SoFi stock pops up, not
[00:17:03] drops a couple billion dollars on the
[00:17:05] retail investor's head. So, people just
[00:17:07] don't get it, but they'll eventually
[00:17:08] figure it out. In the short term, the
[00:17:10] market's a voting machine based on
[00:17:11] emotion, in the long term, it's a
[00:17:13] weighing machine based on fundamentals.
[00:17:16] And while everyone was bitching and
[00:17:18] moaning about PayPal is not moving, we
[00:17:21] were in the market buying it like crazy
[00:17:23] this week. So, thank you very much,
[00:17:25] Cellside. You're the same that
[00:17:27] gave us the opportunity in Alibaba and
[00:17:30] we have sent you Christmas cards because
[00:17:32] you made us a boatload of money off of
[00:17:36] your calls enabling us to get a ton of
[00:17:38] stock at cheap prices. Uh Papa John's
[00:17:42] pizza, wait till those dividend checks
[00:17:44] come from Trump. Right now they're going
[00:17:45] to the military. $1,776.
[00:17:49] Uh that's a lot of people. That money
[00:17:50] goes straight into consumer
[00:17:52] discretionary. Uh and uh I think that if
[00:17:55] the Supreme Court votes down the um the
[00:17:59] tariffs, he's just going to say he's not
[00:18:01] going to give it back to the foreign
[00:18:03] countries. He's going to just pay it all
[00:18:04] out in $2,000 dividend checks. And then
[00:18:07] he's going to work around the Supreme
[00:18:10] Court decision using other laws to still
[00:18:12] keep doing the tariffs on top of it. But
[00:18:14] the money he already collected, he's not
[00:18:16] returning that. He's just going to
[00:18:17] dividend it out. companies, restaurant
[00:18:19] companies that have been left for dead,
[00:18:21] consumer discretionary are going to
[00:18:23] boom. Uh G, uh QXO, that's Brad Jacob's
[00:18:26] new vehicle. I'm going to see him again
[00:18:29] in person in um January when I'm doing
[00:18:33] my TV in New York. And uh he invited me
[00:18:36] to his book signing and I'm reading his
[00:18:38] new book, How to Make a Few More Billion
[00:18:41] Dollars, which is absolutely amazing uh
[00:18:44] and very inspiring. We love that. Uh
[00:18:46] Stanley Black & Decker housing play
[00:18:48] rates going down. Housing's going to be
[00:18:50] a theme in 2026. We're excited. Took
[00:18:52] longer because Powell was belligerent,
[00:18:54] but now it's happening and it's going to
[00:18:57] work. Uh these are just general ETFs
[00:19:00] with general market stuff.
[00:19:03] VF Corp. Okay, again, uh doubled off the
[00:19:07] bottom. It's early days, ladies and
[00:19:11] gentlemen. I'm telling you, Bracken,
[00:19:12] this Bracken will take this thing back
[00:19:14] up close to if not all all-time highs
[00:19:16] over the next 5 years. This guy knows
[00:19:18] exactly what he's doing. If you missed
[00:19:19] the interview we did with him on the
[00:19:21] podcast, go to uh YouTube, type in hedge
[00:19:24] fund tips, Bracken Daryl, you'll see the
[00:19:26] CEO of VUPC Corp laying out the plan uh
[00:19:29] and he's executing. This thing is just
[00:19:32] getting started. Uh, and then
[00:19:37] XBI we took profits on so we could make
[00:19:40] room for rather than having something
[00:19:43] that can go up another 40 or 50% uh
[00:19:46] we're going to have something that we
[00:19:47] think can go up 3 to 4x over the next
[00:19:49] few years and new clients existing
[00:19:52] clients are already in it everywhere
[00:19:53] there was room new uh if you're not in
[00:19:56] it which is very few of you that have
[00:19:59] maybe accounts that have no margin
[00:20:01] capability like cash or IRA accounts
[00:20:03] uh just email me. I'll give you the
[00:20:05] name. You can either add money to your
[00:20:07] account or figure out how to, you know,
[00:20:08] do it on your own. And then um
[00:20:12] brand new clients will all have a
[00:20:14] position in this and existing clients
[00:20:15] all have a position in this. And many of
[00:20:17] you have actually sent in a lot of new
[00:20:18] money uh in the last few weeks. You all
[00:20:20] have positions in this. So uh very very
[00:20:22] excited for you and for everyone here.
[00:20:26] Moving along, uh this is the monthly
[00:20:29] version of all this stuff. So you could
[00:20:31] see XBI has a lot more upside but
[00:20:34] generally look we don't buy ETFs. We
[00:20:36] bought this because we don't buy
[00:20:38] individual stocks and we wanted to
[00:20:39] participate in the recovery of biotech
[00:20:41] and it's happened and it's going to
[00:20:43] continue to happen but there are just
[00:20:45] much higher IRS we can get uh and we had
[00:20:49] to make room doing that. So ring the
[00:20:52] register and move on
[00:20:54] uh VF Corp. So, look, huge move off the
[00:20:57] lows early early days, ladies and
[00:21:01] gentlemen. Uh, where you guys are going
[00:21:03] to get all tricked out is when it goes
[00:21:04] back up to like 35 or 40 and then it
[00:21:07] goes back to 25 before it goes up to 80.
[00:21:10] This is where a lot of you guys are
[00:21:12] going to lose. What's going to happen is
[00:21:14] it's going to go up to 30 35.
[00:21:17] All of you who didn't believe it at 12
[00:21:19] and 15 are going to buy it at 35 and
[00:21:23] then it's going to drop a third down to
[00:21:25] 20 25 and it's going to stay there for a
[00:21:28] while. Maybe go down to 20 21 and take
[00:21:30] out all the whiny you know whats as I
[00:21:32] always like to talk about and just when
[00:21:34] everyone pukes out uh that's when it'll
[00:21:37] work its way up to new highs. So um so
[00:21:40] that's that. Stay tuned. Next five years
[00:21:43] you're going to see it happen in real
[00:21:44] time. Uh we have Stanley Black & Decker
[00:21:48] coming off the lows. This is a whole
[00:21:50] housing recovery play. Very much like
[00:21:52] the uh two 2001 lows. It just kept going
[00:21:56] lower and lower and then it tries to
[00:21:57] work itself higher. Checks back and then
[00:22:00] boom, back up to new highs. This will
[00:22:01] work itself up. It's taken all the costs
[00:22:04] out of the business. Add a little bit of
[00:22:06] tailwind in housing and we're off to the
[00:22:08] races. Uh Planet Pizza, you can see
[00:22:11] these long-term consolidations by huge
[00:22:13] secular rallies. I think we're going to
[00:22:15] see that. PayPal, same story. This is
[00:22:17] the PayPal is the poster child for the
[00:22:21] normal sentiment
[00:22:23] of the mammoth cycle.
[00:22:29] And I love it because I always get these
[00:22:35] nervous Nellies right around here at
[00:22:38] aversion, just so you guys are aware.
[00:22:42] Okay, here's
[00:22:45] here it is.
[00:22:47] Okay, so you have
[00:22:52] discouragement is down there.
[00:22:56] Wall of worry
[00:22:58] and then they drop the trapoor
[00:23:02] to aversion. That's where we are right
[00:23:04] now. And this is when everyone gets
[00:23:06] thrown out of their stock right down
[00:23:08] here because they got all excited. It
[00:23:10] was recovering. OH, WE'RE GOING BACK UP.
[00:23:12] And then all the people who couldn't buy
[00:23:14] it at 50 couldn't get enough at $89.90.
[00:23:18] Trapoor down to 60. I, you know, I was
[00:23:21] saying I hope it goes to 49 to really
[00:23:22] take the weak sisters out. But, you
[00:23:24] know, we're probably going to bottom
[00:23:26] around here, if not a little lower. And
[00:23:28] then, um,
[00:23:30] that's when we'll work back up to 90. At
[00:23:34] 90, there will be a lot of volatility. A
[00:23:35] lot of these guys will be like, "Oh, I'm
[00:23:37] back to even at 90." uh where they
[00:23:39] bought after the huge run. Uh and then
[00:23:42] once we get those guys out, it'll go
[00:23:45] straight back up. Stock will be 150, 200
[00:23:47] bucks. And all the idiots that
[00:23:49] downgraded it at 60 will be upgrading it
[00:23:51] at 150, 170, 200, they won't be able to
[00:23:54] get enough. And they will be doing our
[00:23:56] work for us, creating a market for us to
[00:23:58] help everyone out who can't get enough
[00:24:00] at 200 when they wanted nothing at 60.
[00:24:04] That's how we use it. Fizer, okay, early
[00:24:08] days. It's moved up a few bucks. Now
[00:24:10] they're downgrading it. Now, no one's
[00:24:12] going to be able to figure out what
[00:24:13] happens in early next year when it goes
[00:24:15] to 30 and people are going to miss a 50%
[00:24:17] move. And if you have it positioned the
[00:24:19] way we do, that's means a lot more in
[00:24:21] terms of returns, etc. National Oil
[00:24:24] Well, Varco, so excited. 10 to $15.
[00:24:26] Okay, early days, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:29] This thing is going to work its way back
[00:24:31] up to 60 over the next three years.
[00:24:32] We're going to have a massive energy
[00:24:34] cycle that no one's expecting. Intel,
[00:24:37] same story. Consolidate, work higher
[00:24:39] over time when they get that fab
[00:24:41] humming. Hormell, you get a massive
[00:24:43] dividend while you wait. Been raising
[00:24:44] the dividend every single year for 60
[00:24:46] years. Just barely getting its its sea
[00:24:49] legs back, turning back up. This will
[00:24:51] work its way over 50 over the next
[00:24:53] couple of years. Then you got um GXO. We
[00:24:57] covered everything with Patrick Kellaher
[00:24:59] last week. This hasn't even begun. uh
[00:25:01] goose we covered uh Generrack doing this
[00:25:04] normal wall of worry climbing its way
[00:25:07] back from the from the dead in 2023 when
[00:25:10] we initiated and now uh probably another
[00:25:13] couple years working its way higher back
[00:25:15] over 200 everyone will be like oh back
[00:25:17] to 200 I'm going to get out and that's
[00:25:18] when it makes its next parabolic move
[00:25:20] with the data centers with the housing
[00:25:22] recovery etc is in a similar spot uh as
[00:25:26] PayPal discouragement wall of worry
[00:25:30] aversion
[00:25:31] then it'll take it up here and no one
[00:25:33] will believe it and it'll go higher. Uh
[00:25:37] Estee Lauder
[00:25:39] monster double move off the lows this
[00:25:41] year and now uh people think it's over.
[00:25:44] It hasn't even begun. This this has not
[00:25:47] even begun. This is like the great
[00:25:48] financial crisis recovery. We're
[00:25:50] probably here right here in 2009. If
[00:25:53] you're watch, if you're listening to
[00:25:54] this versus watching this and you can't
[00:25:55] see this, I would strongly urge you guys
[00:25:58] to watch this week's uh version. Disney
[00:26:02] hasn't even started. It's just getting
[00:26:04] started. Uh Dagio, this is a
[00:26:07] generational buy opportunity. No one
[00:26:09] wants it. They think no one's ever going
[00:26:10] to drink again. I'm telling you, these
[00:26:12] people get on the GLP1s, they get off
[00:26:14] the GLP1s, and they still don't change
[00:26:16] their habits. It's just they're
[00:26:18] upgrading. It was mismanaged for a
[00:26:20] while. They had an absolute clown
[00:26:22] without a circus running the business.
[00:26:24] And like Warren Buffett says, buy a
[00:26:26] business that's so good, one day a ham
[00:26:28] sandwich will run it cuz uh that's
[00:26:31] exactly what happened. Now they've got
[00:26:32] an adult in the room. This thing is
[00:26:34] going to turn and over time it's going
[00:26:36] to work up to new highs. This is one of
[00:26:37] the greatest franchises in history.
[00:26:41] Comtock Resources
[00:26:44] again, everyone's so excited. It went
[00:26:46] from $8 our initial basis uh up to 30
[00:26:50] and now it pulled back a little bit. Th
[00:26:52] this this is a multi-year move back to
[00:26:56] levels you haven't seen since the early
[00:26:59] 2000s and we've been talking about this
[00:27:01] for many many months. Cooper standard
[00:27:04] here we are ladies and gentlemen
[00:27:06] straight from 5 to 40. Now it's at 35.
[00:27:08] It's headed back higher over time. We're
[00:27:12] excited about that one. C uh Crown
[00:27:15] Castle getting paid a nice dividend
[00:27:17] while you wait. This thing's going to
[00:27:18] work higher now that they got rid of the
[00:27:21] uh cash sucking fiber business. Got rid
[00:27:25] of that albatross around their neck. Now
[00:27:27] it's a pure play. Money machine
[00:27:29] returning capital to owners. BYU we
[00:27:32] covered uh Baxter. This is going to be
[00:27:35] the healthc care play. You're going to
[00:27:36] wake up. It's going to be an
[00:27:37] announcement about the pump. It's all
[00:27:39] fixed and this is going to be a $30
[00:27:41] stock and just getting started and no
[00:27:43] one's going to understand what happened
[00:27:45] and they didn't buy any in the hole. So,
[00:27:47] they don't benefit because they bought
[00:27:49] their first shares at 30 and they didn't
[00:27:50] buy a lot more at 20. So, uh they'll get
[00:27:53] to 30 and get out. Some of you will be
[00:27:56] smart. You'll get to 30 and you're up
[00:27:58] 50%. Or if you had some at 30 and you
[00:28:01] got more at 20, you'll be up like 33%
[00:28:04] and then as it works its way back,
[00:28:06] you'll be you'll make multibags over
[00:28:08] time, get paid a dividend while you
[00:28:10] wait. Baba, we know the story. It's got
[00:28:12] to consolidate this for a while and make
[00:28:14] its next move. Uh Boeing duopoly
[00:28:18] consolidating before its next big move.
[00:28:21] And Albamaro again, monster move shaved
[00:28:25] a little bit. Had to take a little bit,
[00:28:27] but this is this is just beginning. this
[00:28:28] will work higher over 200 over time. Uh
[00:28:32] just uh that's that. We just had to uh
[00:28:36] not be pigs, take some profits and uh
[00:28:39] Advance Auto, same story. Building its
[00:28:41] base. They're doing everything they said
[00:28:43] they were going to do. This will work
[00:28:44] its way higher. So uh that's the story.
[00:28:47] Uh we could end now, but actually we
[00:28:48] haven't started yet. We got a lot to
[00:28:50] cover this week. So uh let's go through
[00:28:53] some economic data. China car sales
[00:28:55] through the roof. You can see here
[00:28:56] record highs in December. That's
[00:28:58] benefiting Cooper Standard. This is from
[00:29:00] Stiffel uh by the way and they have a
[00:29:06] price target of $43 on the stock. You
[00:29:10] can see the forward multiples
[00:29:13] uh on uh 2027. Ibida estimates are six
[00:29:17] times forward and um so that's that
[00:29:22] Stiffel actually upgraded PayPal to 75.
[00:29:25] They applied for a bank uh so they can
[00:29:28] do uh service their business customers
[00:29:31] better similar to what SoFi did but
[00:29:33] they've got a much bigger install base
[00:29:34] already and that'll be a good thing.
[00:29:37] Here is the uh Sloomer data from RBC
[00:29:40] thanks to our friends over there. So
[00:29:42] yeah, big move off the bottom. Probably
[00:29:44] consolidating a little bit up here. Uh
[00:29:46] on this one, it's looking less a little
[00:29:49] more oversold than overbought. So maybe
[00:29:51] we could push through to new highs uh
[00:29:53] into year end. We shall see
[00:30:03] some different takes here. Equal weight
[00:30:04] just broke to new highs. That's good for
[00:30:06] market breath. Russell Small Cap just
[00:30:09] broke to new highs. This is a play that
[00:30:11] we've been talking about. This is going
[00:30:12] to be a big theme. Measured move points
[00:30:15] to 3,200 plus.
[00:30:18] This game is just getting started.
[00:30:20] Bullishness not fully at an extreme yet.
[00:30:23] Uh let's see what else. Europe breaking
[00:30:25] out to new highs.
[00:30:27] Germanyy's been consolidating for a
[00:30:29] while. We'll see what happens with that.
[00:30:32] Uh Hong Kong big move consolidation.
[00:30:35] It'll break through this and then just
[00:30:37] keep going. So Bob's got a lot more
[00:30:40] upside. Just going to take a few more
[00:30:41] years. And 10-year yield still in this
[00:30:45] range. You know, our call at the be when
[00:30:48] it was at five. Everyone said it was
[00:30:50] going to break through five. We said no,
[00:30:51] it's going below four before it goes
[00:30:53] above five. Uh and we thought it would
[00:30:55] happen by the end of this year. We got
[00:30:56] 12 days. We're at 4.11. Let's see if we
[00:30:59] can get down to 3.99.
[00:31:01] Um maybe if not this year, first quarter
[00:31:04] and next year. 10-year yield seems to be
[00:31:06] up against resistance and we did get
[00:31:09] down into the threes uh a little bit
[00:31:12] earlier this year. So, we actually did
[00:31:14] do it. Let's see if we can end the year
[00:31:16] there. I doubt it, but uh the dollar, I
[00:31:19] told you this was a false breakout back
[00:31:21] to resuming its downtrend. That's going
[00:31:24] to persist for some time. Uh Canadian
[00:31:27] dollar, see you skeptical Canadians, I
[00:31:30] told you you guys were going to be rich.
[00:31:32] The looney is going higher. Okay. So,
[00:31:35] smile for once and stop saying sorry all
[00:31:37] the time and uh enjoy your day in the
[00:31:40] sun because it's just beginning there uh
[00:31:43] Canada. So, we got a lot of Canadian
[00:31:45] friends there. Energy. Uh we'll maybe
[00:31:48] we'll go through this next week. A lot
[00:31:49] of commercial buying in the commitments
[00:31:51] of traders. This is going higher in
[00:31:53] 2026.
[00:31:55] Um
[00:31:56] like this uh fake out here that's going
[00:31:59] to catch everyone off sides. Maybe they
[00:32:01] take it down to 55 before they shoot
[00:32:03] straight up to 70. Uh 6570. I think we
[00:32:06] could have a move in oil over the next
[00:32:08] 18 months.
[00:32:11] And I think that's that on the Sloomer
[00:32:14] stuff. We've got some data we want to
[00:32:17] cover. PayPal got upgraded to 75 and
[00:32:20] then some idiot downgraded it. They're
[00:32:22] just doing us favors. They don't even
[00:32:24] know it yet. They're going to be on the
[00:32:25] same Christmas card list that the
[00:32:27] Babaell side guys who downgraded at 60
[00:32:29] are on. Longerterm view of IPO activity
[00:32:33] starting to tick up again.
[00:32:36] Power generation capacity, we got to
[00:32:38] catch up. That's going to help the
[00:32:39] comtock resources and the Generex of the
[00:32:41] world.
[00:32:43] Retail net purchases of US equities
[00:32:46] starting to move up. Short interest is
[00:32:48] still high.
[00:32:50] Uh what do we got here? Big year for tax
[00:32:53] refunds. That's going to that's probably
[00:32:54] that's why the average draw down since
[00:32:58] 1950 in a midterm election year aka next
[00:33:00] year is 17.3%.
[00:33:03] I don't think we're going to get that. I
[00:33:05] do think we're going to get a 10 or 12%
[00:33:07] maybe even a 15% probably 10% at some
[00:33:10] point in the year. And the reason I
[00:33:12] don't think it's going to be 17%
[00:33:14] is because uh there is a lot of fiscal
[00:33:17] stimulus and you are in an easing cycle
[00:33:19] and mini QE is starting again. So, I
[00:33:22] think the the corrections are going to
[00:33:24] be run-of-the-mill that you get every 13
[00:33:26] months on average you get a 10%
[00:33:28] correction. I think 2026 will be no
[00:33:31] different. I think there'll be a lot
[00:33:32] more volatility and consolidation, but
[00:33:34] this fiscal stimulus is real. The tax
[00:33:36] refunds, the deregulation, the Fed in
[00:33:38] the picture, a lot of positive things,
[00:33:41] and we'll we'll know more as we get more
[00:33:42] data. Uh
[00:33:45] biggest two-e outflow from tech funds
[00:33:47] since February of 2025.
[00:33:50] Interesting. Bottom. You guys, if you
[00:33:52] were here, you you knew it first. Bottom
[00:33:54] up consensus. Expect substantial margin
[00:33:56] expansion in 2026.
[00:34:01] Fund stress calling for a 10% return in
[00:34:03] 2026. I think that's reasonable. Um,
[00:34:08] that would be well above the average of
[00:34:10] a midterm election year of 2.4. I would
[00:34:12] I would take the under on fund strat
[00:34:15] this year. I'd say 5 to 7% on the
[00:34:18] indices. If you own outside the mag
[00:34:21] seven, uh you could make a lot more
[00:34:24] there. There going to be a lot of stocks
[00:34:26] under the surface that double and triple
[00:34:28] that don't even move the needle on the
[00:34:29] index. Uh because their weights are so
[00:34:31] low and that's where we're going to play
[00:34:33] and we're going to be smiling so wide.
[00:34:35] Look, we could eat three bananas
[00:34:36] sideways this year. We're going to eat,
[00:34:39] I hope, two to six bananas sideways next
[00:34:41] year. Uh I think we will and I'm pretty
[00:34:44] excited about it. Uh tariffs
[00:34:49] What tariffs? Yeah, we know uh
[00:34:53] travel Oracle's free cash flow. This is
[00:34:56] the problem with tech. If you're
[00:34:57] overweight, S&P index or MAG 7, this is
[00:35:00] what you're dealing with. The return on
[00:35:02] invested capital is not there yet. And
[00:35:05] the question is whether people will keep
[00:35:06] funding it to get it there. And with
[00:35:09] these type of numbers this early, the
[00:35:10] answer is the market doesn't know at the
[00:35:12] moment.
[00:35:14] And that's why we had monstrous
[00:35:19] gear even though we had zero mag 7. Uh
[00:35:23] cyclicals versus defenses.
[00:35:26] Cyclical starting to move by the way. Uh
[00:35:30] dividend yields. It's going to be a
[00:35:32] year. Main Street
[00:35:34] plays outperforming Wall Street plays.
[00:35:47] contribution.
[00:35:48] Oh, this is key.
[00:35:51] Contribution to S&P earnings growth. You
[00:35:54] can see here that the dynamic is
[00:35:58] changing. Whereas in 2024,
[00:36:01] the MAG 7 was the majority of the
[00:36:04] contribution.
[00:36:05] Starting next year, the unmagnificent
[00:36:08] 493 is going to be the majority of the
[00:36:11] contribution with the mag 7 being the
[00:36:14] minority of the contribution with their
[00:36:17] earnings growth dramatically
[00:36:19] decelerating which we have been covering
[00:36:23] uh for your presidential cycle. So you
[00:36:25] can see it again ladies and gentlemen
[00:36:28] kind of followed the map here. first
[00:36:29] year you get this down cycle early on.
[00:36:32] Then you get a move off the bottom. Then
[00:36:34] you get year-end kind of flat
[00:36:35] consolidation which continues into the
[00:36:38] first quarter of the second presidential
[00:36:40] year. Some weakness into the fall. That
[00:36:43] will be when defensives really pick up
[00:36:45] and then a rally into year end. Third
[00:36:47] and fourth years being very strong. So
[00:36:50] uh we tend to do exceptionally well when
[00:36:54] other people do poorly. Uh that's kind
[00:36:56] of our knitting and uh
[00:37:01] th this year was the exception. Every
[00:37:03] everyone did well. We did really really
[00:37:04] well. Um but uh we we're we're looking
[00:37:08] forward to next year's environment. We
[00:37:09] love volatility. Big tech has borrowed
[00:37:12] more in the current quarter than any
[00:37:13] full year in history other than 2017.
[00:37:16] Market doesn't love that right now
[00:37:18] unless we start to see some returns on
[00:37:20] that. Um what else we got here? We got a
[00:37:24] lot of stuff for you.
[00:37:28] This shows the
[00:37:32] bell curve of returns
[00:37:35] since 1928.
[00:37:40] This year it looks like it'll fall into
[00:37:41] this majority bucket at the top of the
[00:37:44] bell curve. Uh so we're probably due to
[00:37:47] one due for one of the tail ends. uh not
[00:37:51] the extreme tail end but um biggest
[00:37:55] 4-day percent declines in forward
[00:37:56] returns
[00:37:59] US versus international stocks this is
[00:38:01] starting to change international theme
[00:38:03] is going to continue dramatic
[00:38:04] outperformance in 2025 those of you who
[00:38:06] are with us in 2024 know that and have
[00:38:09] benefited from it uh that's going to
[00:38:11] persist over time as the dollar trends
[00:38:13] lower over time in fits and starts total
[00:38:16] returns you can see here emerging
[00:38:19] markets almost double
[00:38:21] The SNP
[00:38:23] LNG spurs biggest Gulf Coast pipeline
[00:38:26] boom in 18 years.
[00:38:32] Cyclicals versus defensive starting to
[00:38:34] tick up there. Realized correlation has
[00:38:37] gone low. That will pick up in the first
[00:38:40] quarter of next year.
[00:38:43] Uh this is average annual return spammer
[00:38:46] or French value based on
[00:38:49] backward looking what they're saying
[00:38:51] prospectively is based on what's
[00:38:53] happened in the recent past. Uh small
[00:38:56] value will be the largest performer
[00:38:59] large growth
[00:39:01] uh will will underperform by 400 basis
[00:39:04] points a year prospectively.
[00:39:10] This talks about fiscal impulse.
[00:39:14] The average December tends to pick up
[00:39:16] after the 15th.
[00:39:18] We'll see if that persists into year
[00:39:20] end.
[00:39:24] This is fund strat talking about the
[00:39:26] normal cycle of 2026. We just covered it
[00:39:29] in the presidential cycle which implies
[00:39:32] um
[00:39:35] fourth quarter weakness into the fall
[00:39:37] followed by year-end rally. This should
[00:39:40] look more like um
[00:39:43] uh kind of continuation sideways than
[00:39:46] weakness into the fall. So, we'll see
[00:39:48] how that goes.
[00:39:56] Expectation for rising bond yields are
[00:39:58] the highest since April 2022. I would
[00:40:00] take the other side of that.
[00:40:05] private equity, private credit still the
[00:40:07] most likely source of a credit event. We
[00:40:09] actually agree with consensus on that.
[00:40:12] Profit expectations most bullish since
[00:40:14] August 2021.
[00:40:16] Uh August 2021, if you know, um
[00:40:21] market short-term topped
[00:40:24] at the end of 2021, so we're not quite
[00:40:27] at an extreme there.
[00:40:32] allocation to stocks plus commodities
[00:40:34] highest since February 2022. Not yet
[00:40:36] extreme there.
[00:40:41] She talks about the OpenAI sprawling
[00:40:43] network circular deals.
[00:40:48] Transport companies have materially
[00:40:49] underperformed to the most extreme level
[00:40:52] since 2000. What did they do over the
[00:40:54] next 5 years? Dramatic outperformance.
[00:40:56] That helps the Boeings of the world. We
[00:40:59] would have loved to have UPS if they
[00:41:01] would change the CEO already. Um
[00:41:13] Kevin Walsh becomes favorite for next
[00:41:14] bed chair. Uh yeah, I would say that if
[00:41:20] if uh Wars is chosen, who I said on
[00:41:25] Vanney is a Hawk in Dove's clothing,
[00:41:29] uh I think you have a chance of a 15%
[00:41:33] correction in 2026 versus a 10 or 11%.
[00:41:37] Um I think he's the wrong pick. I think
[00:41:40] he's going to be another Powell who will
[00:41:41] be belligerent always.
[00:41:45] You know,
[00:41:48] I mean, look, there's there's a very
[00:41:51] strong aspect of the inflation calls
[00:41:53] over the last 5 years where you could
[00:41:55] say always wrong, never in doubt. I
[00:41:57] think he's moderated in recent months
[00:42:02] and he has a chance to go out as a
[00:42:04] champion if he does one more cut and get
[00:42:07] away with the murder that he caused. a
[00:42:09] lot of banks, a lot of people by missing
[00:42:11] it. It's no inflation. Then he had to go
[00:42:13] too fast, too aggressive.
[00:42:18] Uh I I think he's got a chance to win,
[00:42:20] but the point is
[00:42:23] Wars will be the same thing. He's going
[00:42:25] to say, "I'll do whatever you say." And
[00:42:27] then he's going to get in and he's going
[00:42:29] to be king and he's going to do whatever
[00:42:30] he wants. And he's an academic.
[00:42:35] And um
[00:42:37] I think the market is underestimating
[00:42:40] that risk right now. Uh
[00:42:44] the bond market will love it because
[00:42:46] it'll feel that the independence is
[00:42:48] intact. The equity market I think will
[00:42:51] suffer from it in the short term which
[00:42:52] will help us. But,
[00:42:55] uh, that's what I would that that that
[00:42:57] could be the biggest
[00:42:59] kind of mix in 2026 to watch out for cuz
[00:43:03] there's a lot of pressure around Trump
[00:43:05] to put in
[00:43:07] Wars
[00:43:09] because I think Wars can be controlled
[00:43:13] uh, versus Hasset is going to be more
[00:43:15] dovish and you know the the perception
[00:43:18] is is more inclined to do what Trump has
[00:43:24] been
[00:43:25] a proponent of since the day he was born
[00:43:28] as a real estate guy, which is lower
[00:43:30] rates. So, uh
[00:43:34] I think that
[00:43:39] we do if we ever want to bring debt to
[00:43:42] GDP down,
[00:43:44] I think we have to run growth hotter
[00:43:46] than normal, which is means inflation is
[00:43:49] going to run above trend, aka 3% is the
[00:43:52] new 2%.
[00:43:54] And like post World War II where we
[00:43:57] brought debt to GDP down from 120 down
[00:43:59] to 53
[00:44:02] by 1957 or 63 by 1957. Uh we have an
[00:44:07] opportunity to do that with
[00:44:10] Hasset and much less opportunity to do
[00:44:13] it with WH and all you have to do is go
[00:44:17] back to the tape and the guy's been
[00:44:19] hawkish his entire career. Now all of a
[00:44:21] sudden he wants a job. He's tired of
[00:44:23] being stuck in academia, unable to get a
[00:44:25] job. So now he wants a big job. So he's
[00:44:28] saying he'll do whatever he's going to
[00:44:29] do. But I'm telling you, once he's in,
[00:44:32] he is the dovish clothes come off and
[00:44:34] he's going to be a hawk at the wrong
[00:44:35] time. And it's not going to be good
[00:44:37] because uh in a
[00:44:40] failed attempt
[00:44:42] to help the bond markets, he's going to
[00:44:44] effectively destroy them. So um next
[00:44:48] week, I'll tell you how I really feel.
[00:44:50] All right. wage growth e eases running
[00:44:53] close to prepandemic trend. That's good
[00:44:54] to see.
[00:44:57] And what else? Anything else super
[00:44:59] important here.

[00:49:13] in 2026.
[00:49:15] Uh you can read this, but this is coming
[00:49:18] and we will play that in a massive way
[00:49:20] with Stanley and with Gener. Bank of
[00:49:23] America says the Fed's T bill buying can
[00:49:25] help lower 10-year yields. This is what
[00:49:28] I was talking about a few weeks ago on
[00:49:29] the big money show when I I was getting
[00:49:33] uh mansplained how the Fed handles twist
[00:49:37] and uh in actuality Bessant has has
[00:49:41] explained how the Treasury is going to
[00:49:43] be involved uh in controlling the long
[00:49:46] end of the curve but um it is what it
[00:49:49] is. Fed Governor Christopher Waller says
[00:49:52] rates could be cut by as much as a full
[00:49:55] point. Amen. Hallelujah. Lifting off and
[00:49:58] looking good stock market and sentime
[00:50:00] results. Here is our article of the
[00:50:02] week. On Tuesday, we put out a summary
[00:50:05] of the monthly Bank of America global
[00:50:06] fund manager survey. This month surveyed
[00:50:08] 238 institutional managers with 368
[00:50:13] 64 billion assets under management. You
[00:50:16] can tell a lot of people are on
[00:50:17] vacation. Here are the five key points.
[00:50:19] Fund manager sentiment based on cash
[00:50:21] levels, equity allocation, and global
[00:50:22] growth expectations rose to 7.4 4 from
[00:50:25] last month's 6.4, the highest level
[00:50:27] since July of 2021. So, getting a little
[00:50:29] frothier when they were despondent. Uh,
[00:50:31] two, global growth expectations are now
[00:50:33] the most optimistic since August 2021,
[00:50:35] rising a net 18%. Uh, strong global
[00:50:39] economy from last month's net 3%.
[00:50:41] However, while economic expectations
[00:50:42] continue to catch up to stock prices,
[00:50:44] they are only slightly above neutral and
[00:50:46] well below prior periods of froth. Three
[00:50:51] fund managers average cash level fell to
[00:50:53] a record low of 3.3% down from last
[00:50:55] month's 3.7%. There have been nine
[00:50:57] instances since 1998 when cash levels
[00:51:00] dropped below 3.6% with global stocks
[00:51:02] falling an average of 2% in the
[00:51:04] following months. So we're seeing some a
[00:51:06] little bit of chop here. Makes sense.
[00:51:08] Four fund managers continue to neglect
[00:51:10] the energy sector with allocations still
[00:51:11] a net 26% underweight and nearly two
[00:51:15] standard deviations below the average of
[00:51:16] the past 20 years making it the most
[00:51:18] underweight equity sector. When the
[00:51:21] rubber band gets stretched the mean
[00:51:23] reversion becomes inevitable. If you
[00:51:25] were with us during 2020 we uh
[00:51:28] absolutely made a killing on buying
[00:51:31] Exxon at $33 when oil went negative and
[00:51:35] uh we are at a situation similar. The
[00:51:37] only difference this time is I don't
[00:51:39] want the play the price sensitive plays.
[00:51:41] I don't think they've come down enough
[00:51:43] relative to the price of oil. Uh I want
[00:51:45] to play the derivative plays uh and the
[00:51:48] servicesers and we'd like that through
[00:51:49] national oil well Varco and more on the
[00:51:52] gas side with com stock than the oil uh
[00:51:56] side. So five managers have also left
[00:51:59] cons consumer staples four dead with
[00:52:02] allocation falling four percentage
[00:52:04] points to a net 20% underweight making
[00:52:06] it the second most underweight sector as
[00:52:08] volatility picks up in a midterm
[00:52:10] presidential cycle and money comes off
[00:52:13] the sidelines in search of yield. We
[00:52:15] expect staples to move back into vogue
[00:52:17] in a hurry
[00:52:19] uh 100%.
[00:52:22] You know, we we often do an article in
[00:52:24] December uh entitled the last shall be
[00:52:28] first. This time will be no different.
[00:52:30] The last is defensives and staples and
[00:52:33] healthc care in 2025. They are probably
[00:52:35] going to be amongst the best performers
[00:52:37] in 2026 and you will benefit. Boeing
[00:52:41] update. Boeing has come a long way from
[00:52:43] earlier this year when the uninvestable
[00:52:45] was the consensus call and merely
[00:52:47] mentioning the stock earned double
[00:52:49] takes. It is remarkable what happens
[00:52:52] when you put a leader with a true
[00:52:53] hands-on engineering background in
[00:52:55] charge of a company building some of the
[00:52:56] most complex machines on the planet. And
[00:52:58] not just any engineer. Kelly Ortberg is
[00:53:01] a true one of one of a kind with a long
[00:53:03] track record of turning an engineer
[00:53:06] first culture into massive shareholder
[00:53:08] value. At Rockwell Collins, he doubled
[00:53:10] sales in six years and more than
[00:53:12] quadrupled shareholder quadrupled
[00:53:15] shareholder value before selling the
[00:53:17] business at a nice premium to United
[00:53:19] Technologies in 2019. We have long
[00:53:21] flagged Ortberg as a true home run hire
[00:53:24] and key catalyst in the Boeing
[00:53:25] turnaround. And so far, he has proven to
[00:53:27] be the exact medicine the company
[00:53:29] needed. The Boeing thesis has always
[00:53:31] been a simple one for us. This is a
[00:53:33] national champion and proxy for US
[00:53:35] manufacturing that operates in a growing
[00:53:37] duopoly backed by a $636 billion
[00:53:40] backlog. A backs stop like that provides
[00:53:43] a long and forgiving runway for
[00:53:45] management to fix self-inflicted wounds,
[00:53:47] plenty of those, and work its way back
[00:53:49] on track.
[00:53:51] It certainly helps to have the world's
[00:53:52] greatest salesman and ultimate closer in
[00:53:55] the White House with a Boeing order
[00:53:57] increasingly serving as the price of
[00:53:59] admission in US trade negotiations. At
[00:54:02] this point, Boeing owes him a custom
[00:54:04] trophy. And if his pitch to sell
[00:54:06] beautiful Boeing planes has been
[00:54:08] impressive, just wait until Intel chip
[00:54:10] sales start next. So, greatest salesman
[00:54:12] in the history of Boeing. Of course,
[00:54:15] while piling on blockbuster orders makes
[00:54:17] for great headlines, demand has never
[00:54:19] been Boeing's problem. The entire story
[00:54:21] has come down to production. Deliver
[00:54:23] more airplanes, generate more cash. It's
[00:54:26] really that simple. As Kelly Orberg
[00:54:28] applies his playbook of operational
[00:54:30] excellence and whips Boeing back into
[00:54:31] shape, we expect that to translate into
[00:54:34] the long awaited and coveted greater
[00:54:36] than 10 billion of annual free cash flow
[00:54:39] target that the market still fails to
[00:54:41] appreciate. The way we see it,
[00:54:42] turbulence is in the rearview mirror.
[00:54:45] Smooth skies ahead. Kelly Ortberg, CNBC
[00:54:48] Post earnings, giving a great highlevel
[00:54:50] update on the state of the turnaround
[00:54:52] and how the administration's dealmaking
[00:54:54] is booking Boeing demand deep into the
[00:54:57] next decade. You should listen into
[00:54:59] that. We've highlighted the key from the
[00:55:01] most recent earnings report. You can
[00:55:02] read by the stars and the circles, but
[00:55:05] here are the 10 key points. Number one,
[00:55:07] for the first time since Q4 of 2023,
[00:55:09] Boeing generated positive free cash flow
[00:55:12] coming in at 238 million compared to a
[00:55:14] quarterly outflow of 1.96 billion last
[00:55:18] year.
[00:55:21] The improvement came from a higher
[00:55:22] commercial deliveries and better working
[00:55:24] capital both year and sequentially.
[00:55:26] Since the earnings call, management has
[00:55:28] updated fullear guidance and now expects
[00:55:30] an outflow of $2 billion versus the
[00:55:32] prior 2.5 billion.
[00:55:36] as the 700 million DOJ payment was
[00:55:39] pushed into 2026. Looking ahead, they
[00:55:42] expect to generate low positive
[00:55:43] singledigit billions in 2026, a major
[00:55:46] year-on-year step forward, and still
[00:55:48] view the path to more than 10 billion
[00:55:49] over the next few years is very
[00:55:50] achievable. Two, commercial airplane
[00:55:53] deliveries reached 160 for the quarter,
[00:55:55] up 38% year-onear, and the highest
[00:55:57] quarterly total since 2018. By August of
[00:56:00] this year, Boeing had already surpassed
[00:56:02] last year's fullear delivery count.
[00:56:04] Stronger deliveries lifted the
[00:56:05] commercial segment to 11.1 billion in
[00:56:08] revenue, up 49% year-on-year. The
[00:56:10] commercial backlog now stands at 535
[00:56:12] billion and includes more than 5,900
[00:56:14] airplanes with both the 737 and 787 sold
[00:56:18] firm into the next decade. Three. After
[00:56:20] stabilizing production at 38 per month
[00:56:22] and meeting all required KPIs, Boeing
[00:56:25] jointly agreed with the FAA in October
[00:56:27] to increase the 737 max output to 42 per
[00:56:29] month. Management expects the to exit
[00:56:32] the firm firmly at 42 per month rate and
[00:56:34] sees no supply chain constraints that
[00:56:36] would prevent further increases. Any
[00:56:38] production hikes beyond 42 per month
[00:56:40] will occur in increments of five no
[00:56:42] sooner than 6 months apart. And we'll
[00:56:44] use the exact same review process with
[00:56:47] the F FAA. Four. The 787 program
[00:56:51] continued to stabilize production at
[00:56:53] seven per month with management
[00:56:54] expecting to finish the year at eight
[00:56:55] per month and to move to 10 next year.
[00:56:57] South Carolina site expansion which
[00:56:59] effectively doubles the manufacturing
[00:57:01] footprint is aimed at supporting rates
[00:57:03] above 10 with current market demand
[00:57:04] allowing for rates in the teens.
[00:57:06] Management does expect some supply chain
[00:57:08] constraints specifically around seat
[00:57:10] certifications and noted that progress
[00:57:12] is being made with targeted actions
[00:57:14] underway with suppliers. Five. The
[00:57:16] defense, space, and security segment
[00:57:17] generated 6.9 billion in revenue for the
[00:57:20] quarter, up 25% year-onear from 5.54.
[00:57:23] Boeing booked 9 billion in orders from
[00:57:25] the segment, bringing the backlog to a
[00:57:27] record 76 billion. Management continues
[00:57:30] to make progress, de-risking development
[00:57:32] programs and improving profitability
[00:57:33] with quarterly operating margins at 1.7%
[00:57:36] compared to negative 43.1% last year.
[00:57:39] There have been no changes so far in
[00:57:41] 2025 for the defense business. A welcome
[00:57:43] change after more than 13 billion in
[00:57:45] changes over the past 5 years and
[00:57:47] management maint remains confident that
[00:57:49] the segment can return to historical
[00:57:51] performance level. Six, the global
[00:57:54] services segment delivered quarterly
[00:57:56] revenue of 5.4 billion, up 10%
[00:57:58] year-on-year from 4.9 billion. The
[00:58:00] segment booked 8 billion in orders
[00:58:02] during the quarter, bringing the
[00:58:03] year-to- date booktoill ratio to 1.2 and
[00:58:06] pushing backlog to about 25 billion.
[00:58:09] Profitability remains strong with
[00:58:10] operating margins of 17.5% up 50 basis
[00:58:13] points year-on-year and both the
[00:58:15] commercial and government business
[00:58:16] businesses again delivering doubledigit
[00:58:19] margins. Seven management recorded a 4.9
[00:58:21] billion charge tied to the updated 777
[00:58:25] X certification timeline which increased
[00:58:27] quarterly loss per share by $645. While
[00:58:30] there are no major technical issues with
[00:58:32] the airplane or its engine,
[00:58:33] authorization began, the next major
[00:58:35] phase of certification flight testing
[00:58:36] has been delayed, pushing the expected
[00:58:38] first delivery to 2027 instead of 2026.
[00:58:40] Management noted that demand for the
[00:58:42] aircraft remains strong and that they
[00:58:43] view the 777X as the company's next
[00:58:45] flagship.
[00:58:47] With the charge serving has a
[00:58:49] conservative estimate that could allow
[00:58:50] them to beat the updated timeline. The
[00:58:52] program is expected to be a free cash
[00:58:54] flow headwind of about 2 billion in 2026
[00:58:56] with improvements in 2027 and cash flow
[00:58:59] neutrality by 2028 followed by positive
[00:59:01] contributions thereafter. eight cash
[00:59:02] investments in marketable securities
[00:59:04] stood at 23 billion at the quarter end
[00:59:06] with management expects to rise about 28
[00:59:09] to about 28 billion now that both
[00:59:14] Jeepson and Spirit transactions have
[00:59:16] closed.
[00:59:18] Boeing also maintains access to 10
[00:59:20] billion in undrawn credit facilities
[00:59:22] with strengthening the balance sheet and
[00:59:24] supporting the investment grade rating
[00:59:25] as a top priority against consolidated
[00:59:27] debt of 53 billion. Nine. During the
[00:59:29] call, management had guided for the
[00:59:31] Jeeppes deal to close during Q4 and for
[00:59:34] the Spirit deal deal to close shortly
[00:59:35] thereafter. Both transactions are now
[00:59:37] complete with the 10.55
[00:59:40] billion allcash jeep deal closing in
[00:59:43] early November and the 8.3 billion
[00:59:45] Spirit acquisition closing in early
[00:59:47] December. Management noted that no other
[00:59:49] M&A is a focus at the moment. and 10.
[00:59:51] After more than 3,000 hours of lab
[00:59:53] testing and analysis, Boeing has a final
[00:59:55] set of design changes to permanently
[00:59:57] address the engine anti-ICE issue for
[00:59:59] the 7377
[01:00:00] and 73710. Both aircraft are expected to
[01:00:03] receive certification in 2026 with the
[01:00:05] process expected to be straightforward.
[01:00:07] So, here are the earnings call. We
[01:00:09] highlighted the important parts. You can

[01:00:18] consult your psychic or financial
[01:00:19] advisor before doing any anything.
[01:00:23] Moving on.
[01:00:27] Estee Lauder update.
[01:00:29] Here are earnings. Let's go through the
[01:00:31] highlight reel with number one coming in
[01:00:34] at Estee Lauder reported Q1 revenue of
[01:00:38] 3.48
[01:00:41] billion up 4% year-on-ear ahead of
[01:00:43] consensus by $98 million. Organic growth
[01:00:46] was 3%. A massive sequential
[01:00:48] acceleration from the 13% decline in Q4.
[01:00:50] Adjusted EPS of 32 cents also beat
[01:00:52] expectations by 14 cents and more than
[01:00:54] doubled versus the prior year period.
[01:00:56] Mainland China surprised to the upside
[01:00:59] in Q1 with revenue up 9% to 532 million
[01:01:04] as consumer sentiment continued to
[01:01:06] rebound. Estee ladder significant
[01:01:08] outperformed the prestige beauty market
[01:01:10] in China with retail sales growing at
[01:01:12] double-digit pace versus high
[01:01:13] singledigit growth for the industry. The
[01:01:15] company gained share across every
[01:01:16] category, marking five of the past six
[01:01:19] quarters of prestige beauty share gains
[01:01:22] led by seven brands posting doubledigit
[01:01:24] growth and Leil Labo delivering nearly
[01:01:27] tripledigit growth. Three, the America
[01:01:30] saw net sales decline 2% to 1.17 billion
[01:01:33] pressured by ongoing challenges in
[01:01:35] department stores and softness at
[01:01:36] certain retailers with elevated
[01:01:38] inventory levels. That said, Estee
[01:01:39] Lauder has maintained prestige beauty
[01:01:42] share per year to date with meaningful
[01:01:44] volumedriven share gains in the US. This
[01:01:46] was led by the Estee Lauder brand, which
[01:01:48] gained share across skincare, makeup,
[01:01:50] and fragrance for the brand's third
[01:01:52] consecutive quarter of overall gains.
[01:01:54] Four, profitability continued to improve
[01:01:57] with adjusted gross margins of 73.3%.
[01:02:00] Up 60 basis percent uh 60 basis points
[01:02:03] year-on-year from 72.7%
[01:02:05] for the full year. Management continues
[01:02:06] to expect gross margins to be flat to
[01:02:08] modestly positive versus 74% in 2025
[01:02:12] while noting meaningful upside potential
[01:02:14] remains the most important metric in the
[01:02:15] estee turnaround. Adjusted operating
[01:02:17] margins expanded by 300 basis points in
[01:02:20] Q1 to 7.3% ahead of expectations.
[01:02:22] Management expects operating margins to
[01:02:24] improve sequentially throughout the year
[01:02:26] with fullear guidance of 9.4 to 9.9% as
[01:02:30] the business works its way back toward
[01:02:31] solid double-digit margins over time.
[01:02:34] Five profit recovery and growth plan
[01:02:36] continues to perform well with
[01:02:37] management expecting to be substantially
[01:02:38] completed in fiscal year 27 and the
[01:02:41] majority of the full rate benefits
[01:02:42] realized in the same year. The program
[01:02:44] is expected to result in 1.2 to 1.6
[01:02:46] billion of restructuring and related
[01:02:49] charges with 697 million incurred to
[01:02:51] date and delivered annual gross benefits
[01:02:53] of 800 million to a billion dollars.
[01:02:57] This at this point SA Louderder has
[01:02:58] approved incentives representing more
[01:03:00] than 70% of the expected gross benefits
[01:03:03] and over 50% of the anticipated charges
[01:03:06] and nearly 60% of the projected net
[01:03:08] reduction in position. Six management
[01:03:11] continues to lean into higher growth,
[01:03:13] higher margin digital channels,
[01:03:14] launching several brands on Amazon's
[01:03:16] premium beauty store across the US,
[01:03:18] Canada, Japan, the UK, and Mexico. The
[01:03:20] company also expanded global
[01:03:22] distribution on Tik Tok shop with brands
[01:03:26] such as Mac, Clinique, and Dr. Jart,
[01:03:29] debuting
[01:03:30] during the quarter, and announced a new
[01:03:32] partnership with Spotify aimed at
[01:03:34] modernizing and scaling the DTC business
[01:03:36] and building a best-in-class omni
[01:03:37] channel platform. This accelerated push
[01:03:40] drove global online organic sales to
[01:03:42] double digit growth, up from mid-s
[01:03:44] single digits in Q4, performing the
[01:03:45] broader prestige beauty market in the
[01:03:47] online channel. Seven travel retail has
[01:03:50] begun to recover and show improving
[01:03:52] momentum with air traffic in the key
[01:03:54] highan market up 14% supporting strong
[01:03:58] demand and driving double-digit growth
[01:03:59] for during golden week. Importantly,
[01:04:01] inventory levels remain materially lower
[01:04:04] than a year ago, leaving the business
[01:04:06] far better right-sized relative to
[01:04:07] retail demand. Management continues to
[01:04:10] expect global travel retail to return to
[01:04:12] modest growth for the full year and
[01:04:13] plans to double down on the segment in
[01:04:15] the west and in the Americas where
[01:04:16] exposure is lower driven by distribution
[01:04:19] expansion and consumerf facing
[01:04:20] investments. Eight capex decline 32%
[01:04:23] year-on-year to 96 million during the
[01:04:25] quarter as management continues to
[01:04:27] prioritize higher return on invested uh
[01:04:30] ROI investments with fullear capex
[01:04:32] expected to run at 4% of projected
[01:04:34] sales. The focus remains on high ROI.
[01:04:36] Consumer facing incentives with
[01:04:38] investment in this area up 4% during the
[01:04:40] quarter during 14 net freestanding
[01:04:44] stores which management
[01:04:46] expects to drive meaningful improvement
[01:04:48] in returns over time. Nine. The fullear
[01:04:51] tariff related headwind is expected to
[01:04:52] be about 100 million impact to
[01:04:54] profitability with management continuing
[01:04:55] to leverage available trade programs and
[01:04:57] further optimize the regional
[01:04:58] manufacturing footprint to bring
[01:04:59] production closer to the consumer. These
[01:05:01] actions are expected to offset more than
[01:05:03] half the imp uh anticipated tariff
[01:05:05] impact. While management continues to
[01:05:07] evaluate additional PRGP initiatives and
[01:05:10] potential pricing actions and 10
[01:05:12] management reaffirmed the fiscal year
[01:05:14] 2026 outlook calling for net sales
[01:05:16] growth of 2 to 5% and organic growth of
[01:05:18] 0 to 3% versus expected prestige beauty
[01:05:21] industry growth of 2 to 3%. Adjusted
[01:05:23] operating margins are set to expand for
[01:05:25] the first time in four years, driving
[01:05:27] fullear adjusted EPS of 187 to 207
[01:05:29] versus 151 last year, representing 27 to
[01:05:33] 37 24 to 37% earnings growth. We love
[01:05:37] the sound of that. Uh here are the keys
[01:05:40] from the earnings call
[01:05:43] and um
[01:05:46] some additional commentary. Fear and
[01:05:48] greed at neutral 51
[01:05:51] active managers a little bit overweight.
[01:05:54] Uh first and foremost by the way we are
[01:05:57] opening up again. We want to get
[01:05:58] everyone in that new position.

[01:06:56] opinion, not advice. See terms. Do
[01:06:59] whatever you want,
[01:07:01] however that goes. Retail earnings
[01:07:03] estimates and revisions. Uh retail sales
[01:07:06] top 30 weights in the last 60 days
[01:07:08] revised up for next year by 3 3.06%.
[01:07:11] 06%. Uh transports earnings top 30
[01:07:16] weights all also revised up but by 19
[01:07:19] basis points for 2026. So earnings going
[01:07:21] up. Uh today we saw core CPI come in
[01:07:24] lower than expected, CPI come in lower
[01:07:27] than expected. We'll see as the data
[01:07:29] continues to come out in coming weeks.
[01:07:32] Uh earnings growth for forward multiple
[01:07:36] at 22.5. You back out the MAG 7. If
[01:07:39] you're not in the MAG 7, it probably
[01:07:40] drops down to 18 or 17. Much more
[01:07:42] reasonable. And earnings growth for the
[01:07:44] S&P for next year. Uh double digits with
[01:07:48] 309 per share in the S&P 500. All right,
[01:07:52] so the podcast is over. Now we're going
[01:07:54] to move on to the ask me anything
[01:07:57] questions. And uh we got quite a few
[01:08:00] good ones. So for those of you who enjoy
[01:08:01] that, stick around. We're going to start
[01:08:03] with Kyle M.
[01:08:06] Um,
[01:08:08] we covered Generrack and Advanced Auto
[01:08:10] Parts. We're excited about both of them,
[01:08:11] so we won't belabor that. Victor Lynn,
[01:08:14] uh, appreciate it. SLB, we've covered
[01:08:17] that a million times. We like it. We
[01:08:19] just like National Oil Well Varco
[01:08:20] better. Um, Monsanto,
[01:08:24] we don't like we that we've covered that
[01:08:28] a million times. Um, it's fine, but we
[01:08:30] don't we don't like it that much. Allan
[01:08:33] asks, "Do you reinvest dividends or take
[01:08:35] the cash?" I always take the cash and
[01:08:37] then I can proactively reinvest in the
[01:08:39] same stock if it's at a reasonable
[01:08:40] valuation, but more likely than not, if
[01:08:42] it's up a lot, I'll put it in something
[01:08:44] that's just getting started. Tim D,
[01:08:46] thoughts on Dualingo? I covered that
[01:08:48] before. Great product going to get wiped
[01:08:49] out probably by AI. Chris Williamson,
[01:08:53] can you look at path? UIP path looks
[01:08:55] good here. This is a software play. This
[01:08:57] is going to be another problem most
[01:08:59] likely with AI, but let's take a quick
[01:09:02] look there. Um,
[01:09:16] free cash flows leveled off.
[01:09:19] Revenues, margins have leveled off. So,
[01:09:22] it's a broken growth story is basically
[01:09:24] what you have here. Um,
[01:09:28] let's just take a quick look at a couple
[01:09:30] of things that are usually.
[01:09:39] So, it's training at 8.5 billion.
[01:09:53] All right, let's take a look at some of
[01:09:54] the financials here. First off, let's
[01:09:56] just see what they do. I mean, the key
[01:09:58] thing here is you better be a software
[01:10:00] expert and understand how
[01:10:03] uh end to end automation a range of
[01:10:05] robotic process US internationally blah
[01:10:09] blah blah
[01:10:11] tenant platform cloud automation cloud
[01:10:13] infrastructure.
[01:10:15] All right, let's take a look at the
[01:10:16] financials.
[01:10:25] revenues are down
[01:10:31] from 1.8 down to 1.4. So, complete
[01:10:34] broken growth story.
[01:10:38] Uh, let's just see here. Balance sheet
[01:10:42] looks healthy.
[01:10:48] Free cash flow is okay.
[01:10:55] Let's see what they're doing to the
[01:10:57] share account.
[01:11:01] So, look at this.
[01:11:10] Look at these filthy pigs.
[01:11:14] Number one, look at stockbased comp.
[01:11:16] half a billion dollars in 2022.
[01:11:21] And at the same time,
[01:11:24] the share count is going through the
[01:11:27] roof from 152 million to 546 million.
[01:11:33] Look, they created their own funeral. I
[01:11:35] I don't like I I won't do business with
[01:11:37] people like this. If they're going to
[01:11:39] just
[01:11:42] disrespect the owners of the business
[01:11:44] and deletute the hell out of them and
[01:11:45] pay themselves massive stock breaks comp
[01:11:48] before they generate any cash I you know
[01:11:50] and now it's a broken growth story and
[01:11:52] they got all these shares outstanding
[01:11:54] you can have it sold to you. I mean
[01:11:56] maybe the thing on a trading basis can
[01:11:58] this go higher absolutely but the
[01:12:00] culture is there. They're a bunch of
[01:12:02] pigs. Uh, Phipe Andrew Pinkos,
[01:12:06] can you please take a look at Paraggo?
[01:12:10] This thing is a value trap.
[01:12:14] If you want to buy a generic, buy Tea.
[01:12:25] We've said no about this stock a million
[01:12:27] times. At some point, we'll be wrong,
[01:12:30] but there's no signs of growth or
[01:12:31] recovery.
[01:12:33] Um,
[01:12:47] so I got 400 million of cash, 600
[01:12:50] million of receivables, and they've got
[01:12:55] 1.1 billion of debt. So that's not
[01:12:58] terrible. Their cash flow is
[01:13:02] 256 million. That's fine. Low return on
[01:13:06] invested capital business
[01:13:10] and probably a pretty steady share
[01:13:13] count, but the revenues aren't going
[01:13:14] anywhere. They've been doing 4 billion a
[01:13:16] year forever.
[01:13:17] No change there. Are they buying in
[01:13:20] stock? Nope. But they're not issuing it
[01:13:23] either.
[01:13:25] Um it's just a dog. I I I I don't I
[01:13:29] don't think you're really going to get
[01:13:31] much more hurt here. Uh you have to
[01:13:34] understand the story. Like how are they
[01:13:36] going to differentiate themselves a
[01:13:39] little bit? Maybe they have some
[01:13:40] non-generic stuff starting up. But uh
[01:13:43] I've looked at this one a million times.
[01:13:45] Maybe now it's time to take another look
[01:13:46] because the price is down a lot. But um
[01:14:00] not for me.
[01:14:02] Brad Jay, what do you think of CarMax?
[01:14:06] Wonder if it's that Brad Jay. I doubt
[01:14:08] he'd be asking about CarMax, though.
[01:14:12] All right, let's see.
[01:14:15] I I don't like the used car business.
[01:14:17] business. I like the new car business
[01:14:18] right now, but I'll bet you it's going
[01:14:21] to work for those of you who can't get
[01:14:24] enough of it.
[01:14:28] Looks like revenues, margins, and uh
[01:14:31] free cash flow is kind of turning the
[01:14:33] corner a little bit.
[01:14:43] See what the balance sheet looks like.
[01:14:48] 204 million in cash, 151 in receivables,
[01:14:53] 16 billion of debt.
[01:14:56] Now that I wonder if that how much of
[01:14:58] that is inventory financing versus
[01:15:02] actual
[01:15:05] and that looks
[01:15:08] that might be floor leases or something
[01:15:11] like that. I'd have to I'd have to take
[01:15:13] a closer look at that. Let's take a look
[01:15:15] at free cash flow
[01:15:17] picking back up. Income statement
[01:15:23] hasn't shown any signs of recovery.
[01:15:25] Let's see.
[01:15:30] Still pretty soft.
[01:15:45] buying in the shares.
[01:15:48] I don't like the business, but I think
[01:15:49] it works here. So, have at it, Brad.
[01:15:55] If that's the real Brad J and you make
[01:15:58] money on this, I want I want you to sign
[01:16:01] my book when I see you in January.
[01:16:03] That's that's what I want. Uh JP, hey
[01:16:07] Tom, longtime listener. I've been very
[01:16:08] successful following the investing
[01:16:10] technique Hedge Fund Tips has taught.
[01:16:11] Thank you for all you share.
[01:16:13] Uh blah blah blah blah blah
[01:16:17] been reading a lot lately about
[01:16:18] automakers definitively coming to build
[01:16:20] out expanding hybrid offerings beginning
[01:16:21] January 2027. When do you think the
[01:16:23] market starts pricing in accelerated
[01:16:25] earnings growth for Cooper Standard? It
[01:16:27] already has. The stock moved well ahead
[01:16:29] of earnings. So now it's consolidating
[01:16:31] until they actually show them the
[01:16:33] earnings which they which they will in
[01:16:34] 2026 and 2027 for sure. Uh so uh yeah
[01:16:39] it's up 7x
[01:16:42] uh before they were even earning any
[01:16:44] material money. So uh market's already
[01:16:48] price pric pricing in accelerated
[01:16:50] earnings growth. Now they deliver more
[01:16:51] than expected and the thing is going to
[01:16:53] fly. Um
[01:16:56] fizer if you listen to our last when we
[01:16:58] announced that position we alluded to
[01:17:00] what we do but we won't get into any
[01:17:02] more details as for the benefit of
[01:17:03] clients only. Jack Hazard.
[01:17:07] Uh, can you tell Goose starting to
[01:17:11] selling super high-end hunting gear?
[01:17:15] Can you tell Goose to start selling
[01:17:16] super high-end hunting gear?
[01:17:22] Um,
[01:17:28] okay. Uh, maybe we'll see. Uh,
[01:17:30] interested in your thoughts on Maai.
[01:17:34] I think that's a Chinese liquor company.
[01:17:37] M
[01:17:39] O U
[01:17:41] T AI.
[01:17:45] I I told you I
[01:17:49] um
[01:17:51] it's probably fine. I I just won't buy
[01:17:52] any other Chinese companies other than
[01:17:54] Baba or Tencent. Mike
[01:17:57] Inman and I I've gone into it for a
[01:18:01] multitude of reasons. Uh, thank you for
[01:18:03] all your value listening for six months.
[01:18:06] Turned on to you from a good friend.
[01:18:07] Well, thank you very much. Oh, by the
[01:18:09] way, we didn't acknowledge all the
[01:18:11] people sending in pictures for the
[01:18:12] merch. Uh, by the way, um,
[01:18:17] a lot of you have listened to the
[01:18:19] podcast, made money off the ideas, and
[01:18:22] you call and you give us money to invest
[01:18:23] at Great Hill Capital, and we're very
[01:18:25] grateful for that. Some of you will
[01:18:26] never be able to uh, reciprocate the
[01:18:29] value, and and we're a-ok okay with
[01:18:31] that. We love just giving value, putting
[01:18:33] out good in the world, and we're going
[01:18:34] to continue to do that. If you want to
[01:18:36] reciprocate, uh my suggestion is share
[01:18:40] it. Share the if you're getting value
[01:18:42] and making money off of what we're doing
[01:18:43] for you, share it with one person you
[01:18:46] care about that loves the markets. An
[01:18:47] easy way to do that is to wear the
[01:18:49] merch, get a hat, get a mug. People will
[01:18:52] ask you questions, and uh it's an easy
[01:18:55] way to say, "Well, go ahead and listen
[01:18:56] in for a week or two and see what you
[01:18:58] think." And then some of you have been
[01:19:00] generous enough to send in your pictures
[01:19:01] and show to the hedge fund tips
[01:19:03] community. And I want to acknowledge
[01:19:05] Drew Burn who is a consistent supporter
[01:19:08] for many, many years. Uh and he sent in
[01:19:12] his picture. It looks like he's in
[01:19:13] Scotland or Ireland there on a golf
[01:19:15] course. And um uh that's him with his
[01:19:19] hat. And many of you have sent in
[01:19:21] incredible pictures. And keep them
[01:19:22] coming guys. People want to see other
[01:19:24] people in the community and we're very
[01:19:26] very grateful for that.
[01:19:28] Um K okay can you take a look at energy
[01:19:31] play KRO and give your thoughts you got
[01:19:34] it thank you for sharing and uh your
[01:19:37] question Kronos
[01:19:40] yeah I think you got one here my friend
[01:19:42] is this is defense
[01:19:48] um
[01:19:52] I think I'm going to like this and
[01:19:55] you're a quick quick learner
[01:19:57] Mike Inman.
[01:20:00] Well, okay. So, they still have a free
[01:20:02] cash flow problem. So, you're not out of
[01:20:04] the woods yet, partner.
[01:20:06] But
[01:20:19] let's take a look at the financials.
[01:20:27] Titanium oxide dioxide pigments.
[01:20:34] Oh, paints, coatings, plastic, paper,
[01:20:36] fiber, ceramics, foods, cosmetics,
[01:20:39] pharmaceuticals,
[01:20:41] a products. Okay.
[01:20:44] Yeah.
[01:20:48] Still has a four 4% dividend yield while
[01:20:50] you wait.
[01:20:53] Let's take a look, partner.
[01:21:00] Why do they only have $27 million of
[01:21:02] cash?
[01:21:27] And it's not seasonal either. They just
[01:21:29] literally have $27 million of cash.
[01:21:32] Receivables have been pretty consistent
[01:21:34] at 330.
[01:21:37] The debt is 626 million.
[01:21:42] Uh well, now you know why the stock is
[01:21:44] down.
[01:21:52] What else do they have for assets here?
[01:22:00] Inventory restricted cash.
[01:22:09] Geez,
[01:22:11] I don't like this balance sheet, man. I
[01:22:14] think they'll find their way out of it,
[01:22:15] but you got to figure out how much
[01:22:18] untapped credit they have to get through
[01:22:20] this soft spot. Whatever is causing
[01:22:22] that, find out why they have such a soft
[01:22:24] spot.
[01:22:29] But
[01:22:36] last couple of quarters, they're having
[01:22:38] problems with their free cash flow.
[01:22:50] Don't like that. Let's see. Revenues
[01:22:55] seem okay.
[01:22:59] Interest expense has gone up a lot. So,
[01:23:01] look, it's trading like it's, you know,
[01:23:03] people are, it's not at $4 because
[01:23:07] people think it's
[01:23:09] definitely staying in business. Um,
[01:23:15] my bet would be that it will, but this
[01:23:16] is not a guaranteed thing.
[01:23:43] Revenues are okay.
[01:23:46] This business has been struggling for a
[01:23:47] while. This is a really lowquality
[01:23:49] business. I would call this a trading
[01:23:50] vehicle that you might catch a lucky
[01:23:52] double here, but it's too much risk for
[01:23:54] me. So, I'm going to pass and I'm going
[01:23:57] to be wrong and I'm going to watch you
[01:23:58] make a double. But Buffett always said,
[01:24:02] "Rule number one is don't lose money.
[01:24:03] Rule number two is don't forget rule
[01:24:05] number one." And the good news is when
[01:24:08] God was handing out FOMO jeans, fear of
[01:24:10] missing out jeans, he forgot Tom Hayes.
[01:24:12] So I hope you get a double and triple
[01:24:14] and I miss it. I'll be perfectly happy
[01:24:16] cheering for you. Uh JT investor asked
[01:24:20] for Kyle Marine, the egg company.
[01:24:24] It's usually pretty cyclical business.
[01:24:26] So it's a little bit off of its highs.
[01:24:29] Uh probably not for me.
[01:24:33] There's no real dislocation yet. Let's
[01:24:35] see what the
[01:24:38] free c record free cash flow. You've had
[01:24:40] a record stock price, record revenues.
[01:24:50] I like them before they're doing great,
[01:24:53] not after they're doing great.
[01:25:01] I I just um
[01:25:16] I just I just don't think you are I
[01:25:18] think this is tends to be a cyclical
[01:25:21] business. Everything seems to be going
[01:25:23] well right now and
[01:25:28] Let's see what happened to the share
[01:25:30] count. They must have done an
[01:25:30] acquisition. No,
[01:25:34] I just don't think you're getting enough
[01:25:35] of a
[01:25:38] discount. And I think you're buying when
[01:25:41] all the stars are already aligned. Even
[01:25:43] though you're getting a little discount,
[01:25:44] you're not getting enough. It's not It's
[01:25:45] not what we do here. Jimmy L.
[01:25:48] Uh
[01:25:56] yeah, Jimmy, go back to our article. We
[01:25:58] explained all that. Tim B,
[01:26:03] could you take a look at Brightar
[01:26:05] Lottery BRSL?
[01:26:10] This is like um
[01:26:22] I have no interest in this. Uh thanks
[01:26:25] for the question, Gregory.
[01:26:28] Let's see.
[01:26:32] All right. Here's a whole 10-page
[01:26:34] question about whether the election
[01:26:36] cycle still works. No one cares. We
[01:26:39] underwrite companies on an individual
[01:26:41] basis. If two filters, number one is if
[01:26:45] JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy
[01:26:47] the entire company with one catch,
[01:26:50] they'd be the debt financing, I'd have
[01:26:51] to be the equity financing with 100% of
[01:26:54] my net worth. So, if it works, the
[01:26:56] equity slug is small. I make 20x on my
[01:26:59] money. If it doesn't work, I'm applying
[01:27:00] as a greeter for Walmart. Uh, if we
[01:27:03] wouldn't do that deal, we won't be we
[01:27:05] won't buy even one share. Second filter
[01:27:08] is if I was to walk into the board of
[01:27:11] directors and offer to buy the entire
[01:27:12] company at the price that it was quoted
[01:27:14] in the public markets today, would they
[01:27:16] call security because they thought I was
[01:27:18] out of my mind to make such a low offer?
[01:27:21] If the answer is no, they would
[01:27:23] entertain the offer. We won't do the
[01:27:25] deal. So, doesn't meet these criteria,
[01:27:28] we are not interested.
[01:27:30] Uh this is Rahul wants to invest. Uh
[01:27:34] we'll be in touch. Uh, Rid Ridawan
[01:27:38] from Singapore. Avid listener since
[01:27:40] 2021. Nova Nordist, we've covered a
[01:27:42] million times. Not for us here. I think
[01:27:45] it's okay for you. We've covered that
[01:27:48] quite a bit. And I think you're probably
[01:27:51] okay here, but um I think it's going to
[01:27:55] take a little while to build that base.
[01:27:57] Sagar Kanaka.
[01:28:01] Uh oh. H I
[01:28:06] Oh, am I?
[01:28:13] Huh?
[01:28:26] Negative free cash flow. Revenues seem
[01:28:28] okay.
[01:28:42] Healthc care solutions products and
[01:28:44] healthcare services
[01:28:48] surgical supplies.
[01:28:52] Huh.
[01:28:59] And here comes the balance sheet. Let's
[01:29:01] see, ladies and gentlemen, they have $32
[01:29:04] million in cash and they have
[01:29:09] $22 in receivables and they have
[01:29:14] $1.8 billion of debt.
[01:29:25] How do they have 2.4 billion in current
[01:29:27] liabilities? We got to just
[01:29:33] Yeah,
[01:29:46] 2.4 billion in debt with 32 million of
[01:29:49] cash.
[01:29:50] It's trading like it's going out of
[01:29:52] business because it potentially is. Um
[01:30:02] gosh, how did they screw this up?
[01:30:08] Oh, they issued 3.2 billion in debt.
[01:30:14] H
[01:30:17] still doing this kind of revenue. Did
[01:30:19] they do an equity offering? Is that why
[01:30:20] the stock got smashed? No.
[01:30:26] still paying themselves out. Stockbased
[01:30:28] comp
[01:31:03] I don't know. I mean, this is it's worth
[01:31:06] looking. Look,
[01:31:08] here's what I can tell you. If they
[01:31:10] don't go bankrupt, you will get a 10
[01:31:13] bagger plus. So, size it accordingly.
[01:31:16] It's like a uh it's like an option.
[01:31:21] And if they do go bankrupt, you lose all
[01:31:24] your money. So, you know, you put a 2%
[01:31:26] position, it adds 20%
[01:31:30] uh or you lose 2%. I mean, it's not the
[01:31:32] worst a asymmetry, but um I got to I I I
[01:31:38] got to do more work on this one. This is
[01:31:40] super risky, but I think I I I actually
[01:31:43] think it'll work. Uh, but the fact that
[01:31:46] you could lose all your money means we
[01:31:48] won't be putting clients in this anytime
[01:31:49] soon. But I'm going to look at it a
[01:31:51] little bit more closely. It's a coin
[01:31:52] flip hedge. You get 10 tails, you lose
[01:31:56] one. I kind of like that. But um, all
[01:32:00] right, Carl
[01:32:02] uh, wants to do the 5 million. Okay, we
[01:32:04] will call you. Andrew
[01:32:13] wants to know about Sienna. I think take
[01:32:16] the money and run
[01:32:44] Matt,
[01:32:50] obviously a new listener. Matthew asks,
[01:32:53] "Can you take a look at QXO Inc.? It's a
[01:32:56] Brad Jacobs company which does building
[01:32:58] supplies." Yes, I've heard of it. you
[01:33:00] happen to own a s ton of stock uh from
[01:33:03] 12 and $13, but thank you for that and
[01:33:06] welcome to the podcast. Uh in the
[01:33:08] meantime, he's asking about HQY.
[01:33:27] Yeah. I mean, look, it's
[01:33:29] a lot of this good news. It's it's it's
[01:33:31] running on all cylinders. A lot of the
[01:33:33] good news is priced in. It could go
[01:33:34] higher. It's not for us. We like it. We
[01:33:36] like stocks when no one wants them, not
[01:33:37] when everyone wants them. Victor
[01:33:39] Funheller,
