[0.719s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.879s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.279s] 297th videocast podcast for the week
[7.919s] ending June 26, 2025. Got a lot of great
[11.519s] stuff to cover this week. But as always,
[13.92s] family first. Uh Annie Espar, the uh
[17.199s] Spanish Olympian, invited Mimi to have
[19.199s] dinner on the pool deck with the Spanish
[20.88s] national team after their game on
[22.32s] Sunday. And Annabelle spent the weekend
[24.24s] in Northern California at Superfinals
[26.08s] where her team got silver. And then she
[28.64s] came home to an incredible article
[30.56s] tribute by Swim Swam. So excited for
[34.16s] that headline. Annabelle Hayes adds to
[36.16s] nationally best times in six events at
[37.92s] SCS Novad June uh age group
[40.719s] championship. So that was pretty cool.
[43.6s] Uh what else we got here? That was the
[45.92s] article. That&#39;s me in front of Fox. That
[48.64s] is on set at the Big Money Show, Jackie
[52.64s] D&#39;Angelus.
[54.32s] Uh that is Charlie Gasparino, Cheryl
[57.68s] Cassone, of course. Um
[62.0s] here&#39;s the article. Another terrific
[64.239s] performance for 10-year-old Annabal
[65.519s] Hayes at the SCS Nova June age group
[68.159s] championships. Hayes set personal best
[70.24s] to win the 50 freestyle 2890 200 free
[73.52s] 21542 50 backstroke 3331 100 back 10972
[79.84s] 50 butterfly 30.82 82 and 200 individual
[83.28s] medley, 229 87 in the girls portion of
[85.68s] the meet. In the 10 and under girls age
[87.92s] group this season, Hayes is now the
[90.56s] fastest times in each of those events.
[92.96s] Hayes was a big reason Irvine Nova
[94.64s] Aquatics easily won the combined girls
[96.159s] team titles. That&#39;s very kind. All
[97.84s] right, so that&#39;s in front of the New
[99.52s] York Stock Exchange. Never gets old.
[101.68s] That&#39;s in front of the CNBC booth. Uh
[104.479s] that&#39;s with Brad Smith over at Yahoo.
[108.0s] Uh had a fun time there. This is the
[110.0s] control booth where they produce while
[111.6s] it&#39;s going on live. Uh that&#39;s with Josh
[114.72s] Lipton, one of the hosts at Yahoo. Uh
[118.0s] that&#39;s also in front of the studio there
[120.159s] at Yahoo. That&#39;s on set with Stuart Vney
[123.28s] and John Castamus Titis. He&#39;s a
[125.28s] billionaire uh oil guy and uh
[128.72s] supermarket guy in New York City. You
[130.8s] know, Gristitis
[132.8s] uh outside Fox again. And finally, this
[136.48s] is on set. You can see the
[138.0s] teleprompterss on Varnian Co. and that&#39;s
[142.319s] that. So, first off, want to thank
[145.04s] Christian Dagger, Payton Jennings for
[148.48s] having me on with Stuart Vanney. Thank
[151.04s] you. We&#39;re going to listen in here.
[152.959s] Check out futures, please. Uh, the
[154.8s] market still looking favorably on the
[156.72s] ceasefire deal and its continuation. Dow
[158.959s] up to 80, NASDAQ up 211. Tom Hayes with
[162.239s] me this morning. I want to start with
[163.68s] the oil price down again this morning.
[166.0s] Last time we checked it was $66 a
[168.239s] barrel. I would suggest that that&#39;s a
[170.4s] help to inflation down the road. Is it?
[172.8s] There&#39;s no question about it. This is
[174.319s] the major component to inflation. And
[176.8s] the Saudis are going to continue to
[178.319s] pump. They don&#39;t want sanctions. They
[179.76s] want to be helpful. The Russians are
[181.2s] going to continue to pump. They need
[182.56s] income. Oil is going to stay down. It&#39;s
[185.44s] so funny. Everyone was all up in arms
[187.2s] about the Straits of Hormuz. It&#39;s never
[189.2s] been shut down in all of these different
[192.159s] battles, the Gulf War, etc. It&#39;s never
[194.239s] been shut down. Oil&#39;s going to stay low.
[196.0s] Inflation&#39;s going to stay low. Powell is
[198.4s] going to have to move because the
[200.159s] natives are getting restless. You think
[201.92s] he&#39;s got to lower rates? Look, you got
[203.92s] Why do Musky lower rates? Okay,
[205.92s] Wallers&#39;s come out, Goulsby&#39;s come out,
[208.64s] Bowman&#39;s come out, everyone&#39;s come out
[210.879s] saying, listen, this is a temporary tax
[214.159s] if anything. It&#39;s even in their summary
[216.08s] of economic projections that it&#39;s going
[217.92s] to be temporary. And by the same same
[220.4s] token, their projections 1.4% 4% real
[223.76s] GDP. If if GDP is going to be that low,
[226.08s] he should have done 50 basis points in
[227.76s] June. He&#39;s got to go. If it&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s
[230.4s] going to try to push it off to
[231.519s] September, and that&#39;ll probably be okay.
[233.599s] But now you got more and more people
[234.879s] coming out. Maybe we get a surprise in
[236.879s] July. Um, how low could the price of oil
[240.4s] go? I was going to ask you that, but I I
[242.879s] really need to know. Can you get back
[245.04s] into the 50s? And will American drillers
[248.0s] drill and pump if it&#39;s in the $50 barrel
[250.48s] range? it, you know, at 50 it&#39;s it&#39;s a
[253.519s] little tougher for them to pump
[255.36s] aggressively with rates at this rate. Uh
[258.88s] if rates start to come down, we could
[260.72s] see some pumping in the 50s for sure.
[262.56s] And that would keep oil low for a long
[264.32s] time. But Powell&#39;s got to move. All
[265.6s] right, let&#39;s talk stocks for just one
[266.96s] moment. If we get the big beautiful tax
[269.12s] break, okay, if we get that, if we get a
[271.12s] rate cut by the Federal Reserve, if we
[273.28s] get the ceasefire holding in the Middle
[275.36s] East, does the market rally
[277.52s] significantly? Listen, we are going to
[280.16s] new highs. I told your audience a few
[281.919s] weeks ago, we&#39;re going to new highs this
[284.08s] summer, probably before August. I&#39;ll
[286.16s] tell you what&#39;s what&#39;s going on.
[287.68s] Institutional sentiment is at near COVID
[291.199s] lows still. Can you imagine that? With
[293.04s] markets near near-time highs,
[294.639s] institutional sentiment, you saw from
[296.0s] Bank of America and the fund manager
[297.44s] survey, uh, near great financial crisis
[299.84s] lows. The markets climb a wall of worry.
[302.479s] These people are going to be forced in.
[304.24s] We&#39;re going to get new highs in July.
[306.24s] Stay with me for the hour, please. Tom
[307.919s] Hayes, thanks very much indeed. All up.
[310.72s] Let&#39;s have a look at the energy
[312.0s] companies with oil so down so much.
[314.24s] We&#39;re at $65 a barrel for oil. All of
[316.96s] the energy stocks are down. And you&#39;re
[318.56s] going to cover them for us, Taylor. I
[320.08s] mean, when was the last time that 72
[322.24s] hours ago we took out an, you know,
[325.039s] adversaries nuclear arsenal in the
[327.039s] Middle East and oil falls $12 a barrel.
[330.16s] This is crazy world. Um, but look, so
[332.88s] the oil companies were up a little bit
[334.24s] yesterday because look, they could all
[335.52s] make money at 50 55 for break even. So
[337.84s] when oil&#39;s at 80, great. Now that oil is
[340.08s] back to $65 a barrel, a little bit less
[342.8s] profitable for them to pump. So again,
[344.639s] they fall along with the price of oil.
[346.32s] Tom, you made the point that they can&#39;t.
[347.84s] They&#39;ve never closed the straight of
[349.36s] Hormuz. And they&#39;re not going to do it
[351.12s] now. No, absolutely not. And you could
[353.28s] get oil below 60 bucks a barrel. I think
[355.759s] you could. If rates come down, it
[357.84s] becomes more and more profitable for
[359.28s] them to pump at lower levels. But until,
[361.919s] you know, Chair Powell has been a little
[363.919s] bit belligerent, you know, the natives
[365.759s] are saying, &quot;Let&#39;s cut into July.&quot; And
[366.96s] he says, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; All right, let&#39;s
[368.639s] have a look at the defense stocks, too.
[370.24s] I believe they&#39;re mostly down, but
[371.919s] that&#39;s Taylor. That&#39;s because of the
[373.199s] ceasefire. Yes, exactly. So, we talked
[375.28s] yesterday about traditional defense that
[377.12s] was up as we were waiting for the
[378.56s] escalation and then traditional defense
[380.319s] that is down as we&#39;ve sort of gotten the
[382.08s] deescalation. Also, don&#39;t forget cyber
[384.56s] security defense as well is another uh
[386.639s] role in this. Not along uh with
[388.88s] traditional defense as people were
[390.319s] waiting for maybe a hack that could come
[392.16s] to the grid. Again, that hasn&#39;t come
[394.08s] yet. Bitcoin&#39;s back to 105,000 bucks of
[397.52s] coin. Uh we&#39;re close to a record, right?
[400.4s] Like 110 112 is a record. Look, this is
[403.12s] a classic risk on, right? This is a
[404.96s] market trying to figure out do we like
[406.8s] gold? Do we like dollar? Do we like
[408.4s] Bitcoin? How does Bitcoin fit in a
[410.0s] portfolio if it&#39;s risk on? Um so again
[412.639s] just another um sort of classic risk on
[415.199s] play today with the market following
[416.639s] stocks to some degree too. Yes. Dow&#39;s up
[418.4s] 300. Uh Fiser now they&#39;re a fintech
[420.639s] financial technology company. What are
[422.319s] they? Oh they&#39;re partnering with
[423.68s] Mastercard. That&#39;s important to adopt
[426.639s] stable coin. FIUSD is the Fiser&#39;s token
[431.039s] and they want to have it all across
[433.12s] Mastercard products. So they want to
[434.96s] allow customers to smoothly transition
[436.72s] from fiat currencies to the stable coin.
[440.0s] They want merchants to also get paid if
[442.16s] they wish in this stable coin instead of
[444.24s] a dollar or fiat. Basically saying that
[446.639s] they want stable coins to be ubiquous
[449.44s] across continents and across currencies.
[452.0s] So that they think the stable coin again
[454.319s] is this new okay currency if you will.
[457.68s] Tom, I thought the stable coin was bad
[460.08s] for Mastercard and Visa. It&#39;s it&#39;s an
[462.479s] uncertain period. Here&#39;s how I would
[464.0s] hedge it. St. I gave your audience a
[465.919s] stock called PayPal in the in the
[468.08s] high50s. It&#39;s now in the low7s. They are
[470.88s] the sixth largest issuer of stable
[473.52s] coins. So if you like the fee business,
[475.36s] PayPal&#39;s got 450 million users. If you
[478.0s] like the stable coin business, they&#39;re
[479.28s] the sixth largest issuer. That&#39;s the way
[480.96s] to kind of hedge your risk until we get
[482.4s] more clarity of how this is going to
[483.599s] play out for Visa and Mastercard. I
[485.039s] would not be a buyer of Visa or
[486.24s] Mastercard here. I think I got the
[487.84s] point. Okay, I love it. Then we got Uber
[490.879s] and Whimo. They&#39;ve launched their robo
[492.72s] taxi service in Atlanta. Okay, what do
[495.12s] we know about that? Ste, I keep giving
[497.039s] you these little nuggets, these good
[498.8s] stories, and you keep refusing to ride
[500.96s] in an autonomous vehicle. I don&#39;t go
[503.12s] anywhere where they&#39;ve got them. We
[504.24s] don&#39;t have them in New York. Well,
[505.52s] they&#39;re coming eventually, but yes, the
[507.52s] news today is that um they are going to
[509.84s] be opening up in Atlanta. So, starting
[512.24s] today, you open up your Uber app, you
[514.159s] can either get an Uber X or an Uber
[516.159s] Comfort, and you may get paired up with
[518.959s] a fully autonomous Whimo, and they drive
[521.12s] those Jaguar Pacer cars, but you can opt
[523.839s] out if you end up not wanting that. You
[525.6s] can cancel it and switch to a nonf fully
[527.68s] autonomous ride as well. But basically
[530.0s] all around downtown as well. Okay. Okay.
[531.68s] Okay. Okay. I got the message on this
[533.36s] one. One of these days, why are ro are
[536.08s] robo taxes such a a life a god sa a
[538.8s] lifesaver for uh Tesla and the rest of
[541.279s] them. It&#39;s a big deal. But let me tell
[542.72s] you something. You can&#39;t make this stuff
[544.16s] up. Elon Musk puts a couple cars on the
[546.959s] road in Austin with drivers in the
[549.04s] autonomous cars. He gets tens of
[550.88s] billions of dollars of e equity cap
[552.72s] value. Whimo&#39;s been going for years.
[555.279s] Google gets zero value for Whimo. It&#39;s
[557.92s] already working. Everyone&#39;s driving
[559.36s] around with no drivers. It&#39;s great. Zero
[561.839s] value attributed to to Whimo and Google
[564.08s] stock. All right, I&#39;ll move on.
[565.76s] Microsoft. Oh, Microsoft just hit an
[568.16s] all-time high and we got some more drama
[570.32s] between Microsoft and Open AI. What&#39;s
[572.72s] the What is it now? There is, you know,
[574.48s] there was a great story that um, you
[576.8s] know, co enterprise customers are having
[579.519s] a harder time deciding to switch on over
[581.76s] to the Microsoft copilot AI. One
[584.24s] executive said the chat GPT is so fun
[587.279s] that um, the co-pilot is sort of losing
[590.48s] out in ground to chat GPT from
[592.72s] enterprise customers. One executive said
[594.959s] chat GPT is fun. The co-pilot from
[597.839s] Microsoft is useful, but really only
[600.32s] within the other suite of Microsoft
[602.08s] products. So again, this is chat GPT
[604.16s] going up against the biggie, your
[606.72s] Microsoft. Um, and I did Microsoft as if
[611.04s] I own I know you like it. It Tom
[613.279s] probably doesn&#39;t know this, but I&#39;ve
[614.72s] owned Microsoft throughout the uh the 17
[617.279s] years that this show&#39;s been on the air
[619.04s] and I owned it before I even joined Fox
[621.92s] and that&#39;s a long time ago. That&#39;s
[623.44s] impressive. Talk about compounding. This
[625.279s] business has compounded their capital at
[627.6s] double digits for for decades now. Get a
[629.6s] winner and stay with it. I love it. As
[631.04s] long as it stays winning, of course. Uh
[632.64s] Amazon, I&#39;m interested in this even
[634.24s] though I don&#39;t do delivery. Uh they&#39;ve
[636.32s] expanded their same day delivery service
[638.959s] where now. Yeah. So, they&#39;re going to be
[640.64s] investing about $4 billion to triple
[643.12s] their delivery network by 2026. They&#39;re
[645.519s] expanding same day and next day delivery
[647.76s] to now more than 4,000 smaller cities.
[650.56s] You don&#39;t just have to be in a big city.
[652.24s] You can be in a smaller city and still
[653.839s] get this service. And they don&#39;t have an
[656.0s] exact amount of new facilities, but they
[657.92s] said with each new facility that they
[659.44s] bring, it will create on average about
[661.76s] 170 new jobs. Got it. Thanks very much.
[663.839s] We&#39;ll see you on the Big Money Show
[665.04s] 12:00 noon. Tom, you got a couple of
[666.8s] stock picks. You&#39;re starting with
[668.48s] advanced auto parts. That&#39;s not You
[671.04s] know, I&#39;m used to these these huge gains
[673.44s] that you get in technology companies.
[675.2s] That&#39;s not very sexy. Advanced auto
[677.2s] parts. Okay, here&#39;s what I love to do,
[678.64s] Steu. I&#39;m known on Wall Street as
[680.079s] Turnaround Tom. I like to buy
[681.68s] highquality companies when they&#39;re
[683.12s] marked down. These two stocks I&#39;m going
[684.959s] to talk about are marked down twothirds.
[686.959s] Okay, they&#39;re great businesses. Shane O
[688.72s] Kelly&#39;s coming into Advanced Auto Parts.
[690.32s] Average car on the road is 13 and a half
[692.079s] years. Uh they&#39;ve mismanaged it. He&#39;s
[694.56s] deleveraged the balance sheet. Closed
[696.079s] down 500 unprofitable. Is it double?
[698.56s] This is going to Advanced Auto Parts
[700.48s] could triple over the next 3 to 5 years.
[702.56s] Their margins have bottomed out at 2 and
[704.24s] a half%. They&#39;re going to seven. Last
[706.079s] time they were uh uh high single digits,
[708.24s] the stock traded at $150. Yeah. Okay.
[710.48s] Show me Show me Estee Lauder. Limited
[712.72s] time here. Okay, you like it. Where&#39;s it
[714.64s] going? At 79. Where&#39;s it going? It&#39;s
[716.399s] going to 100 plus in the short term.
[718.959s] Talking about a year or less and then
[720.72s] beyond that, this thing could be a
[722.0s] double from here. Turn around, Tom. You
[723.519s] got it. Thanks very much indeed. Uh,
[725.279s] coming up, President Trump has always
[727.36s] pushed for America first. Watch. Yes,
[730.959s] sir. Tom Hayes with me putting I&#39;m
[733.92s] putting Boeing on the screen. I think
[735.68s] that&#39;s the only defense stock that&#39;s up
[737.92s] and you&#39;re going to tell me why it&#39;s up.
[739.68s] Yeah, no question. We gave it to your
[741.04s] audience, by the way, a couple months
[742.399s] ago at 135 when no one wanted it. It&#39;s
[744.72s] up at 203. But there were these
[746.8s] multi-tonon bombs that were dropped and
[748.8s] decimated Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions over
[751.6s] the weekend. Boeing makes those bunker
[754.079s] bunker buster bombs. They make the GPU
[757.04s] 57. That&#39;s absolutely right. 30,000.
[759.279s] Yeah. And did they work or not? They
[760.959s] they work like nobody&#39;s business. And
[763.519s] Boeing&#39;s back to 200 bucks a share. All
[765.36s] right. Thanks very much, Tom. Coming up,
[767.12s] Trump&#39;s United States. So rates down. No
[769.76s] to the socialist and you&#39;re not gonna
[771.36s] get out of Christ. John Katamatitis, I
[773.76s] don&#39;t care what you say. You&#39;re all
[774.8s] right. Thanks for joining us. Thank you
[776.32s] very much. All right. And Tom, uh,
[778.0s] thanks for being with us for the hour.
[779.12s] Do appreciate that. Thank you. Still
[780.639s] ahead
[782.8s] and we&#39;re back. Then we&#39;re going to talk
[785.76s] about had to chance to go down to the
[788.0s] New York Stock Exchange. Want to thank
[789.36s] Mel Montana and Kristen Scher will
[792.399s] listen in here. So, with all this data
[795.2s] and the S&amp;P 500 within striking distance
[797.92s] of an all-time high, I do want to bring
[799.519s] in Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and
[800.959s] managing member at Greyhill Capital.
[802.88s] Thomas, welcome. Thanks for having me,
[804.56s] Kristen. Great to have you on the show.
[806.0s] I think last time you were here, we had
[807.92s] seen a lot of volatility in the markets.
[810.48s] You were bullish. Are you bullish today?
[812.88s] We continue to be bullish. We we have
[814.88s] some tailwinds here, Kristen. First off,
[817.12s] the ceasefire. I mean, Iran&#39;s nuclear
[819.36s] ambitions were completely decimated over
[821.36s] the weekend. Uh Boeing bunker bombs
[824.16s] absolutely decimated the the the the
[826.16s] sites. Uh then you&#39;ve got the big
[828.32s] beautiful tax bill. Donald Trump,
[829.92s] President Trump says no vacations until
[832.639s] we get it done. That&#39;s going to be very
[834.16s] very constructive in terms of tax cuts.
[836.399s] Uh and then we can get on with growth
[838.0s] and deregulation. We went from tariffs
[839.76s] and wars to growth and deregulation.
[842.24s] That&#39;s that&#39;s a very positive thing. Uh
[844.24s] and then finally, the natives are
[845.6s] getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three
[847.279s] dissenters come out against Chair
[849.279s] Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh,
[852.079s] and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re
[853.76s] going to see more to follow. And, and I
[855.199s] think the reason is very simple. Uh, you
[857.36s] and I are paying an extra $600 billion a
[860.399s] year in interest payments, which is
[861.839s] entirely unnecessary with inflation
[864.079s] where it is. Uh and 72 million
[866.88s] millennials who are desperately trying
[868.399s] to start their lives in family formation
[870.56s] can&#39;t afford a home largely because of
[873.279s] one man focused on his legacy worried
[876.32s] about becoming Arthur Burns and the
[878.8s] conditions of the economy and the
[880.959s] population are nothing like the the
[883.04s] period that Arthur Burns was in power as
[885.68s] Fed chair. So these are the three key
[887.44s] tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing
[889.12s] there Jerome Powell obviously the head
[891.04s] of the Federal Reserve driving the path
[892.88s] forward for interest rates. He has said
[894.959s] multiple times Thomas that he wants to
[896.72s] take this wait and see approach that he
[898.399s] does anticipate that inflation will rise
[900.959s] due to tariffs. So what is your response
[903.279s] to that if in fact inflation does rise
[906.639s] in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy
[909.12s] if if his predict look the Fed mandate
[912.24s] they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent.
[914.8s] He is now prediction dependent. Jay
[917.36s] Powell is so certain that inflation is
[920.16s] going to rise. But if you look at his
[921.839s] summary of economic pro projections, he
[924.48s] acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s
[927.12s] like a one-time tax. Also, if you look
[929.6s] at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real
[932.24s] GDP at 1.4%.
[934.959s] If he believes in his own predict
[936.88s] predictions, he should have cut 50 basis
[939.279s] points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it
[940.959s] both ways. I think this is uh one of the
[943.519s] first times in history we&#39;re seeing the
[944.959s] Fed being prediction dependent versus
[947.6s] data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I
[949.6s] think the pressure is on because you
[951.44s] know if you look at the average age of a
[953.36s] person buying their starter home it&#39;s
[954.8s] been pushed back you know five some odd
[956.959s] years because he got transitory wrong
[958.56s] and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time
[960.48s] to get it right and this is a chance to
[962.8s] preserve his legacy and you know what if
[965.199s] he is right he can always hike 25 basis
[967.6s] points. It&#39;s much easier to quell
[968.8s] inflation than it is to deal with
[970.16s] deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very,
[971.92s] very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that
[974.24s] infamous uh transitory word, right? The
[977.12s] one that you referenced there that many
[978.48s] of us do remember when it comes to the
[979.92s] path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re
[981.6s] bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what
[983.759s] do you like in this market? Yeah, I
[985.759s] think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble
[987.839s] here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going
[989.12s] to push to new highs this summer. No
[990.72s] question about it. But if you just buy
[991.839s] the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be
[993.199s] a little disappointed. You got to look
[994.959s] under the surface for the things that
[996.56s] haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at
[997.92s] earnings growth, so the magnificent 493
[1000.639s] first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7
[1003.6s] first quarter 27% earnings growth that
[1006.639s] will decelerate by first quarter of next
[1009.04s] year to 10.2%.
[1011.279s] The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this
[1013.759s] the market uh went from negative
[1015.839s] earnings growth last year is going to be
[1017.519s] 10.3%
[1019.04s] by first quarter of next year. So
[1020.48s] basically what you have is 493 stocks
[1023.279s] earnings going up. multiple is much
[1025.36s] lower and the seven earnings growth
[1029.12s] basically collapsing and the multiple
[1030.799s] still high. So you want to look under
[1032.079s] the surface the 493. I got one for you
[1033.839s] that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee
[1035.52s] Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay.
[1038.0s] And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the
[1039.199s] floor of the stock exchange quite a bit.
[1040.799s] Yeah, they completely screwed things up.
[1042.559s] Okay. But turnaround Tom loves
[1044.16s] turnaround stories. Great businesses
[1045.679s] when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of
[1047.919s] what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021
[1051.28s] to 2024 the COVID policy in China was
[1054.16s] pretty rough. They have 30% of their
[1055.84s] revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that
[1058.64s] was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of
[1060.799s] that. They did maintain 99% of their
[1064.559s] share in China. So as China is now
[1067.52s] starting to recover, they&#39;re going to
[1068.64s] get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in
[1070.64s] the premium brand category in skincare
[1073.6s] and in cosmetics across the world. Um,
[1077.12s] you know, and they have more than one
[1078.4s] brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and
[1079.84s] people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly
[1081.52s] old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot;
[1083.6s] First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup.
[1085.84s] I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll
[1088.08s] tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too
[1089.919s] young for All right. Estee Lauder.
[1091.6s] They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart
[1093.6s] for the young kids, the Korean stuff.
[1095.12s] They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got
[1096.64s] They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands
[1098.32s] for over a century, and they&#39;re going to
[1100.16s] continue to do the same. They&#39;re going
[1101.76s] to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re
[1104.799s] reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new
[1107.039s] CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded
[1110.0s] on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075
[1113.12s] right now. This can be a double over the
[1115.039s] next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality
[1117.039s] business. This is compounded capital at
[1119.039s] double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to
[1121.039s] continue to do so. Everyone wants to
[1122.72s] look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah.
[1124.08s] We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed.
[1126.0s] Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a
[1127.44s] hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want,
[1128.799s] which I I always have to bring you one
[1130.559s] that that makes people a little bit uh
[1132.64s] uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they
[1135.12s] got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s
[1137.76s] eating their lunch. Uh and they brought
[1139.84s] in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s
[1142.0s] been turning the business around. He
[1143.36s] came from HD Supply, 77 billion business
[1145.919s] at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid
[1148.72s] down some debt, sold off uh closed 500
[1151.2s] unprofitable stores, started cleaned up.
[1154.08s] Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s
[1156.32s] opening a hundred new stores in those
[1158.559s] areas where he&#39;s number one and two in
[1160.48s] the market, which is 75% of the stores
[1162.4s] now. Consolidating distribution centers
[1164.4s] to get the pro the parts to the
[1166.4s] professionals quickly. Margins are going
[1168.24s] to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next
[1171.039s] couple years. Last time margins were
[1172.64s] that high, the stock traded about $150.
[1175.52s] It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think
[1177.36s] that could be a double to a triple over
[1179.919s] the next three to four years. So I do
[1181.6s] want to ask holistically. Obviously, it
[1183.36s] sounds like the Fed could be a risk to
[1185.28s] the downside if they are late on
[1187.52s] lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of
[1189.76s] where we go from here, if you are
[1191.12s] bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P
[1193.2s] 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question.
[1196.4s] In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a
[1198.4s] lot of time with that because I&#39;m not
[1200.08s] correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I
[1202.16s] look at discreet businesses, but I think
[1203.76s] we can, you know, history says when you
[1205.679s] have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12
[1207.76s] months out after you rise 20% as we have
[1211.12s] been in the last couple months, the
[1212.08s] market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So,
[1214.559s] I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a
[1218.08s] realistic expectation. Uh probably
[1220.08s] towards the end of the year this year,
[1221.52s] maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable
[1224.08s] expectation, but new highs and then we
[1226.4s] get into some fall volatility and then
[1228.24s] probably year-end uh year- end rally.
[1230.24s] All right. Uh we like to see a lot of
[1231.6s] green on the screen down here on the
[1233.039s] floor of the stock exchange. Thomas
[1234.799s] Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at
[1236.4s] Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you.
[1238.64s] Thank you for having me.
[1242.4s] And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure
[1244.88s] to be on Yahoo for the full hour as
[1248.24s] well. Uh here are the highlight clips
[1250.32s] with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor
[1255.28s] Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie
[1258.159s] Hyman who accused me of being an
[1260.24s] optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can
[1263.84s] listen in here.
[1266.24s] All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas
[1267.36s] Hayes as well as chairman and managing
[1269.039s] member of Great Hill Capital here with
[1270.88s] us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you
[1272.159s] in here. I bet you Tom, there are some
[1275.12s] viewers who are watching this and
[1277.039s] they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold
[1278.32s] on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian
[1280.64s] nuclear facilities over the weekend.
[1282.24s] President Trump is is dropping 30,000
[1285.12s] pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires
[1289.039s] missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m
[1292.0s] looking at the popular averages and you
[1293.52s] see green across the screen. That might
[1295.679s] be surprising to some people. Does it
[1297.6s] surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of
[1300.159s] sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh,
[1303.039s] if the great Art Cashion used to say,
[1306.159s] uh, you you sell the risk of war, you
[1308.88s] buy the first attack. Uh what you have
[1311.28s] here though and what we heard this
[1312.96s] afternoon from sources was that this was
[1315.44s] a call-in retaliation attack to save
[1318.159s] face and once we knew the magnitude of
[1320.4s] the meaning by that do you mean that
[1322.08s] that Iran was given cut or advanced
[1323.84s] notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s
[1325.6s] correct. It was advanced notice. It was
[1326.96s] symbolic so they can go back to their
[1328.24s] people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and
[1330.159s] then come to the table. So it&#39;s either
[1331.44s] going to be a negotiation or a regime
[1333.28s] change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what
[1335.12s] we do know is this is very very
[1336.88s] constructive for the region. This has
[1338.24s] been a long time coming. They were
[1339.919s] completely decimated. It was completely
[1341.52s] by surprise over the weekend. There was
[1343.36s] no ambiguity about the message. You will
[1345.36s] not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s
[1348.159s] going to it would take them so so long
[1349.76s] and so much money to rebuild. So the
[1351.12s] market loves this. And uh the Saudis are
[1354.159s] going to continue to pump. The Russians
[1355.76s] are going to continue to pump to avoid
[1357.84s] sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low.
[1360.799s] That&#39;s the key thing for for President
[1362.48s] Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so
[1364.559s] we can get some of these tax cuts done
[1366.08s] and we can deal with the big beautiful
[1367.6s] bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it.
[1370.559s] Tom, very quickly, I just want your take
[1372.32s] here. This big beautiful bill, the tax
[1374.159s] bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money
[1375.44s] manager, as a guy who has to think
[1377.039s] through what to buy and what to sell.
[1378.88s] How do you think through that? Yeah, I
[1380.48s] think number one, what&#39;s under
[1382.24s] reportported is what the bill unfunds.
[1384.0s] And if you look at what it unfunds and
[1386.0s] and a lot of climate stuff is taken out,
[1387.679s] which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with
[1389.2s] the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible
[1392.24s] than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The
[1394.159s] only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120%
[1396.0s] debt to GDP is through growth and we
[1398.32s] need tax cuts. We need deregulation.
[1399.919s] That is happening. Uh and uh and and
[1402.64s] things are constructive. I love the low
[1404.559s] bar that is set going into earnings
[1406.48s] season. They they they took down
[1408.08s] earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to
[1410.48s] 4.9.
[1412.08s] So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global
[1414.159s] liquidity. You know, people wonder like
[1415.919s] why have international stocks
[1417.84s] outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s
[1419.679s] treated best. There are 15 cuts around
[1422.0s] the world uh last month alone. Okay,
[1425.12s] which is the biggest amount since uh
[1426.96s] since during during co uh so so and zero
[1431.12s] from the US. So I think what you&#39;re
[1432.799s] going to see is you start to see some
[1434.159s] division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby
[1436.799s] today. You had Bowman today now coming
[1438.72s] out kind of against Powell. I think the
[1441.52s] Fed wants to be more dovish. I think
[1443.12s] global uh M2 money supply you look is at
[1445.36s] record highs after flatlining since
[1447.2s] 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be
[1448.799s] constructive about here. A lot of growth
[1450.799s] coming, a lot of deregulatory policies.
[1453.279s] Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we
[1454.96s] got through kind of the worst of the
[1456.88s] tariff. We got through the kind of the
[1458.64s] worst of the geopolitical here over the
[1460.559s] weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are
[1462.48s] are are on track. Animal spirits are
[1465.12s] coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in
[1466.64s] here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with
[1467.6s] that. Is it a shrug for the market, the
[1469.12s] tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I
[1472.0s] think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as
[1473.919s] being optimistic, you know, 70% of the
[1475.919s] time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s
[1477.039s] what happens with the stock market. Uh
[1478.799s] haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists.
[1480.72s] So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the
[1482.799s] bright side of things and and you know
[1484.08s] what, based on the data right now,
[1485.84s] there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about.
[1487.52s] All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service
[1489.52s] yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer
[1491.76s] launching the program with 20 cars that
[1494.159s] will still be occupied by employees to
[1496.4s] monitor with each ride costing a flat
[1498.72s] fee of $4.20.
[1501.2s] CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will
[1503.12s] likely expand the service based on its
[1505.919s] performance. Tom, what do you make of
[1507.6s] it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look
[1509.76s] over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean,
[1511.279s] the car business has deteriorated uh
[1513.84s] since his involvement in politics. Uh
[1515.919s] however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a
[1518.08s] quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of
[1520.72s] thousands of road taxis, if not
[1522.799s] millions, by the end of the year. That
[1525.12s] is a bold statement. if he gets anywhere
[1527.52s] close to it, uh maybe today&#39;s move is an
[1530.0s] underestimation. However, uh if we look
[1532.64s] at the car business, uh that&#39;s another
[1534.559s] story. And uh and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s a
[1536.799s] trade-off. You&#39;re always betting when
[1538.48s] you pay the valuation that you do for
[1540.08s] Tesla, you&#39;re always betting on the man.
[1542.08s] And he&#39;s delivered for many many years
[1544.08s] and and the followers want to continue
[1545.84s] to bet on him. So, this is a step in the
[1548.24s] right direction. Uh robo taxis could be
[1551.039s] gamechanging, but it remains to be seen.
[1553.6s] If you have drivers in the car, it&#39;s not
[1555.12s] a robo taxi. Joey, bring you in. Halting
[1558.24s] a sales slide in the US. They talk about
[1560.48s] an aging lineup, a model delays, pricing
[1562.96s] blunders, but what do you make of it? I
[1564.64s] think rule number one is they should
[1566.08s] probably get rid of the other 12
[1567.279s] managers. Uh then they could be lean and
[1569.6s] more efficient. Look, that&#39;s a tough
[1570.96s] business. We are in the uh we have a
[1573.2s] business uh that supplies the ceiling
[1576.559s] systems around the windows, the fluid
[1578.4s] transfer systems. I&#39;d rather be an ARMS
[1580.24s] dealer because what&#39;s going to happen uh
[1582.32s] is uh Bessant&#39;s going to be successful
[1584.48s] with bringing rates down modestly this
[1586.159s] summer. That&#39;s going to bring down
[1587.12s] financing rates for cars, but it&#39;s going
[1588.88s] to be a race to the bottom. There&#39;s
[1590.159s] going to be a huge amount of supply.
[1591.84s] Their margins are going to continue to
[1593.279s] go down. The OEMs, the suppliers of the
[1595.76s] parts are going to want be the ones that
[1597.36s] do well because we&#39;ve got average car on
[1599.36s] the road is 13.5 years. There&#39;s a huge
[1601.84s] pent up replacement cycle. We just need
[1604.159s] to see the incentives and we need to see
[1605.84s] the financing rates come down and
[1607.52s] they&#39;re going to start to do huge huge
[1609.039s] volumes. The question is what are the
[1610.559s] margins of the Stellantis, the Ford and
[1612.48s] the GM going to be? I don&#39;t want to be
[1614.4s] in that business. All right. Uh Julie
[1616.48s] bringing you back.
[1618.12s] [Music]
[1625.279s] Well, it&#39;s a big noisy universal stocks
[1627.2s] out there. Welcome to Goodbye or
[1628.799s] Goodbye. Our goal here to help cut
[1630.799s] through that noise to navigate the best
[1632.48s] moves to your portfolio. Today we&#39;re
[1634.64s] dissecting valuations and I&#39;m here with
[1637.039s] Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman
[1639.2s] and managing member. You&#39;re bullish on
[1641.2s] Alberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going
[1642.88s] to start. We&#39;re going to go through the
[1643.919s] reasons why you like this thing, which
[1645.6s] by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you
[1648.0s] know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind
[1650.4s] of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk
[1651.279s] through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy.
[1652.88s] So let&#39;s go through the points. First
[1654.24s] point, huge operating leverage. Yeah,
[1656.559s] this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium
[1658.96s] producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost.
[1660.64s] They&#39;re one of the largest lithium
[1662.08s] producers. So right now, lithium prices
[1665.12s] go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re
[1667.12s] at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell
[1669.76s] into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t
[1671.919s] want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s
[1673.52s] really not the story here. As the price
[1675.84s] turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years,
[1677.919s] even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years.
[1680.32s] This has been going every 5 to 8 years.
[1682.24s] the cycle. The amount of operating
[1684.0s] leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as
[1686.32s] prices go up is astounding. And in the
[1688.48s] short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity
[1690.799s] to to ride through that trough while
[1693.039s] their competitors will fall away at the
[1694.48s] wayside. All right. Second reason you
[1696.159s] say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth.
[1698.32s] Yeah. Uh so the EV story is
[1700.88s] predominantly a China story. China has
[1703.36s] 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in
[1705.76s] leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural
[1708.48s] subsidized market that&#39;s going to
[1710.24s] continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the
[1711.76s] government. US by uh by contrast only
[1714.24s] has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not
[1716.559s] the source of the actual growth for
[1718.64s] lithium. Uh it is energy storage
[1721.76s] systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have
[1724.159s] uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses
[1726.559s] to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030.
[1729.6s] Albamaro is going to be the key
[1730.96s] beneficiary of that growth. Final reason
[1733.279s] you say to pile into this one, dividend
[1735.6s] aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising
[1737.279s] the dividend every single year for 30
[1740.08s] years plus. That makes them a dividend
[1741.76s] aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet,
[1744.64s] $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market
[1747.76s] is expected to rebalance by 2026. And
[1751.039s] when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you
[1752.64s] know, the stock is down materially. We
[1754.32s] do turnarounds. My nickname is
[1755.84s] turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to
[1758.08s] 5year play. Uh this stock from current
[1761.12s] levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh
[1764.0s] could go back up to $150 once the cycle
[1766.48s] returns and the operating leverage uh
[1768.559s] benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield
[1771.52s] at current low levels. So, you&#39;re
[1772.96s] getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s
[1774.48s] below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock
[1777.039s] in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue
[1778.559s] to increase the dividend every single
[1780.64s] year, similar to what Buffett did with
[1782.559s] Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more
[1784.96s] dividends than his basis every single
[1786.72s] year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later.
[1789.039s] All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s
[1790.24s] the thing. So, viewers are watching this
[1791.679s] right now. before they commit capital,
[1793.919s] what are some downside risks they need
[1795.44s] to think about here? Yeah, I think uh
[1797.12s] the biggest downside risk would be if
[1799.279s] the Chinese government did an about face
[1801.36s] and they said we&#39;re no longer going to
[1802.72s] subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a
[1805.12s] very low probability, but but some of
[1807.36s] that demand is from the unnatural
[1809.039s] subsidies and that government initiative
[1810.799s] that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we
[1813.12s] think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic
[1815.12s] consumption uh plan for 2030. They want
[1818.24s] 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I
[1821.36s] don&#39;t see that happening, but that would
[1822.48s] be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your
[1824.24s] buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t
[1825.84s] like. And I like this one. I like this
[1827.12s] one because people have very strong
[1828.96s] feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan.
[1831.36s] Let&#39;s go through those these reasons.
[1832.48s] Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83,
[1835.679s] it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9
[1839.6s] billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh
[1843.36s] 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re
[1846.0s] effectively look if you believe in
[1847.919s] Palunteer and they certainly do have a
[1849.84s] defensible moat they&#39;re going to do
[1851.52s] great things. The pro the question is
[1854.0s] how much of those great things that
[1855.52s] they&#39;re going to do over the next decade
[1857.44s] are you already paying for today?
[1860.24s] Current valuations you would have to
[1862.88s] grow revenue at a 50% compound annual
[1867.44s] growth rate for the next 10 years to
[1870.799s] justify the current valuation. All
[1874.24s] right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s
[1876.08s] too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So
[1878.48s] 50% of the stock, a little more than
[1880.24s] that, is owned by retail investors. If
[1882.559s] that sentiment turns, like we saw with
[1884.24s] the meme stocks, whether it was AMC,
[1886.48s] high valuation, not really on the basis
[1888.08s] of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc.
[1890.72s] When they fall, they fall fast. When
[1892.24s] they exit, they exit all at once. So you
[1894.0s] have some risk there. And a final point
[1895.76s] here, the reason you say avoid it,
[1897.44s] aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no
[1899.76s] question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data
[1902.24s] bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got
[1904.32s] AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies
[1906.159s] coming into uh the the the
[1909.919s] arena. Uh I would say another red flag
[1912.72s] has been the insider selling $125
[1915.039s] million in the last 30 days alone. The
[1917.44s] chief technology offers officer selling
[1919.6s] like it like his pants are on fire. I
[1921.2s] mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120
[1923.36s] million house, I don&#39;t know what he
[1924.96s] needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells
[1927.279s] me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of
[1928.64s] itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh
[1930.559s] is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh
[1932.96s] and increased the share count by 4x over
[1935.76s] the last six years. So even if they
[1937.84s] continue to do that, if they keep
[1939.279s] issuing stocks to to management in
[1941.6s] abundant amounts, uh what do you what
[1944.24s] what is your slice of the pie going to
[1946.08s] look like if you buy today and they add
[1947.84s] and they forex the share count again
[1949.6s] over the next five to six years? Now
[1951.279s] before turnaround, Tom, I let you go.
[1953.2s] The last thing I need to know though,
[1954.559s] where could you be wrong? What what are
[1955.84s] some upside risks I need to think about?
[1957.84s] I think the biggest risk uh they
[1960.159s] certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a
[1963.44s] defensible product. They have a mode
[1965.12s] around their product. Um the biggest
[1967.6s] risk would be is if the defense
[1969.279s] department decided to double government
[1971.36s] spending on defense, which given the
[1973.679s] budget talks, given the the initiative
[1975.36s] of this administration is probably a
[1977.519s] lower probability, but not a
[1978.88s] non-existent probability. With
[1980.64s] everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend,
[1982.32s] uh nothing is out of the question. In
[1983.84s] which case, Palanteer would be a
[1985.6s] beneficiary. government would spending
[1987.36s] it would go up, their contracts would
[1988.559s] probably go up. And we should know the
[1989.76s] stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah,
[1991.76s] it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It
[1994.0s] was up around, last I checked, 480% over
[1997.039s] the past 12 months. What a run. But
[1998.96s] there it is. Portfolio recommendations
[2000.64s] by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so
[2004.08s] much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as
[2005.84s] well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.
[2007.519s] More market domination right on their
[2009.36s] side.
[2011.57s] [Music]
[2013.919s] And Tom Hay still here with me. thoughts
[2015.76s] on all this, Tom, as we&#39;re counting down
[2017.12s] to the close here? Yeah. Well, first and
[2019.279s] foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict
[2021.039s] in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried
[2022.48s] about closing the the straight of
[2024.0s] Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even,
[2026.24s] which is remarkable, by the way, that it
[2028.0s] has never happened. It&#39;s never closed.
[2030.159s] Markets climb a wall of worry. You know,
[2031.84s] I looked at the most recent Bank of
[2033.76s] America global fund manager survey, the
[2035.679s] sophisticated half a trillion dollars,
[2037.6s] 222 managers. They are still nearly as
[2041.039s] pessimistic as they were during the co
[2042.96s] lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were
[2045.76s] during the great financial. I mean,
[2047.519s] those are the pros. What about the
[2048.72s] retail investors? Well, look, retail
[2050.72s] investors, oddly enough, have been right
[2052.879s] since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the
[2054.56s] dips when the institutions have been
[2055.919s] hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been
[2057.52s] making all the money. And I think that
[2058.96s] trend uh is going to persist with
[2061.28s] sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top
[2063.359s] when sentiment is that pessimistic. And
[2065.2s] that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push
[2066.24s] to new highs uh before the end of the
[2068.399s] summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get
[2070.079s] into some fall normal chop, normal
[2072.32s] volatility before the end of the year
[2073.76s] rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings
[2076.639s] driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar
[2078.079s] down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to
[2081.599s] step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump.
[2083.359s] Market&#39;s going to like that. Global
[2085.2s] liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh
[2088.96s] Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the
[2091.52s] world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit
[2093.52s] of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby,
[2097.2s] uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead
[2099.92s] of, uh, remaining too restrictive like
[2102.0s] Powell has been talking about. They
[2103.359s] probably lay that out in Jackson Hole.
[2105.44s] So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of
[2107.2s] good things. Look, we just went through
[2108.72s] the end of the world tariff war. We just
[2110.88s] went through the end of the world
[2112.24s] possible World War II type of situation.
[2114.56s] Uh, and these companies keep chugging
[2117.04s] along. GDP now estimates. What quickly,
[2119.76s] what worries you? What would be on your
[2121.28s] list of worries on your radar? downside
[2123.599s] risk. Uh downside risk would be if
[2127.28s] President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly
[2130.0s] the tariff negotiations were going and
[2132.48s] he did the hard stop on July 9th and you
[2136.32s] know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we
[2138.0s] were in April. The probability is that
[2139.76s] very very low. We&#39;ve got an election
[2141.44s] coming up in, you know, next year. I
[2144.16s] don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll
[2145.599s] threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit
[2147.04s] of volatility on the way up, but on
[2149.04s] balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time
[2150.96s] to be constructive, but selectively
[2152.48s] constructive. And that is I think which
[2154.64s] Ed Yardenni referenced is the
[2156.88s] unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times.
[2159.76s] There&#39;s a tremendous amount of
[2160.96s] opportunity and underexposure
[2163.599s] in those in those stocks. Stay
[2165.28s] selectively constructive, by the way.
[2166.96s] Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up,
[2168.56s] Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman
[2170.4s] and managing member still with me.
[2172.0s] Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you
[2173.52s] make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said
[2175.119s] selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you
[2176.8s] what&#39;s really interesting today. Small
[2179.119s] caps outperform tech outperform the S&amp;P
[2182.079s] 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are
[2184.88s] playing the catch-up trade. You got some
[2186.56s] short covering today. Record short
[2188.96s] interest in small caps right now. I
[2190.64s] think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful
[2192.64s] trade for the second half of this year
[2194.8s] as people realize, wait, they short,
[2196.56s] they sold in the whole record $1
[2198.16s] trillion of equity sold the beginning of
[2199.92s] April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been
[2202.24s] forced in, forced in, forced in. Now
[2204.88s] they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away
[2206.56s] from me. How am I going to catch up on
[2208.24s] performance? The only way you can catch
[2209.599s] up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you
[2211.839s] want to be buying small caps. Uh
[2213.599s] certainly some exposure to
[2215.04s] international, even though international
[2216.56s] has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that
[2218.4s] type of thing on these risk-on days.
[2220.24s] We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The
[2221.68s] shorts become the first buyers and then
[2223.28s] you get this positive constructive
[2224.72s] cycle. And if you want some uh valuation
[2227.2s] relief, small caps is the place to find
[2228.96s] it. and midcaps. You started to see
[2230.4s] flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really
[2232.0s] interesting to see that today. I&#39;m
[2233.119s] paying close attention to that. Uh
[2234.56s] Jared, I want to bring you here. All
[2236.56s] right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I
[2238.16s] want to get your thoughts as well um on
[2239.839s] the Fed because I as I was talking there
[2241.76s] with Mike. You heard from Pal last week.
[2244.24s] Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how
[2245.76s] this tariff inflation is going to play
[2247.28s] out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for
[2249.04s] it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is
[2251.2s] it going to be sellers and producers or
[2252.72s] some combination?&quot; And the message
[2254.56s] should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut,
[2256.48s] but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re
[2257.599s] expecting this year. Well, I thought
[2259.119s] they were supposed to be data dependent.
[2260.8s] It sounds to me like he&#39;s being
[2262.48s] prediction dependent because he is
[2264.4s] predicting that inflation is coming in
[2266.88s] the coming months and in the meantime
[2268.96s] he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive
[2270.88s] and who has to foot that $600 billion of
[2273.04s] extra interest expense? You and I do as
[2275.04s] the tax. Is it your opinion they should
[2276.96s] be cutting now? I think they should have
[2278.64s] gone 25 basis points this month.
[2280.8s] Obviously, there was no probability of
[2282.4s] them doing so. Uh but now you start to
[2284.72s] see some of these people descent. Okay.
[2287.28s] uh three people now in the last few
[2288.72s] days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and
[2291.44s] Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we
[2294.32s] got to refinance. And millennials, which
[2296.4s] is uh 72 million people trying to start
[2298.88s] a family, family formation, mortgage
[2300.96s] rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home
[2304.56s] builders. They&#39;re not risking that
[2305.92s] you&#39;re seeing in in building permits.
[2307.839s] It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much
[2309.44s] easier if he&#39;s right about his
[2311.28s] predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got
[2312.96s] real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he
[2316.24s] believes his own predictions, he should
[2317.68s] be cutting 50 basis points, not saying,
[2319.76s] &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go
[2321.599s] up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike
[2323.52s] said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set
[2325.52s] the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another
[2327.119s] couple months, and he&#39;ll have his
[2328.24s] meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s
[2330.48s] when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two
[2332.0s] cuts, which is Goldilocks because we
[2333.599s] don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike
[2335.119s] alluded to because that implies bad
[2336.88s] things. You should be cutting. You have
[2339.04s] powerful people in your corner, of
[2340.24s] course. The president, I believe, I
[2341.599s] think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank
[2343.359s] you, sir. Thank you.
[2345.599s] Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re
[2347.04s] a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to
[2348.32s] decide what to buy and what to sell.
[2349.92s] What What did you make of what you heard
[2351.359s] there? I liked what Brian said. Brian,
[2353.04s] what what do you think is going to turn
[2354.96s] around the volumes at CarMax? Is this
[2356.88s] just an interest rate play? Because uh
[2359.119s] you you choose industry leaders. I do
[2361.44s] turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom.
[2363.28s] So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts
[2365.359s] uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to
[2367.2s] say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re
[2369.2s] making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have
[2370.72s] our little niche business just with the
[2372.8s] uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two
[2374.96s] because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us
[2376.64s] everywhere else. Uh but is that is that
[2379.28s] how you think about CarMax? Because the
[2380.88s] average car on the road is 13.5 years.
[2383.28s] The volume should be booming, right? I I
[2385.2s] mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if
[2387.359s] if people are going to drive it to 15
[2388.88s] years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly
[2390.48s] business. But uh what what makes the
[2392.64s] what moves the needle on that one?
[2394.96s] Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know,
[2399.2s] the, uh, transaction volumes in both
[2403.04s] used cars and new cars have been, uh,
[2405.76s] have been slowed by the high retail
[2408.16s] prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes,
[2410.4s] Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing
[2412.48s] member for hanging out with me today for
[2414.56s] the show. Final thoughts on selectively
[2416.48s] constructive. I like that. Yeah,
[2417.599s] selectively. Look, if we look at
[2418.88s] earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is
[2423.68s] going to decelerate from 27% earnings
[2426.4s] growth in the first quarter this year to
[2428.16s] 10.2 in the first quarter next year.
[2430.4s] Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from
[2433.52s] negative last year to 10.3%
[2436.72s] first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re
[2438.56s] paying lower multiple for more earnings
[2440.64s] growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a
[2443.04s] higher multiple for declining earnings
[2445.04s] growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of
[2447.119s] opportunities. You just got to look
[2448.24s] under the surface. And as we saw today,
[2450.4s] never bet against America. Look under
[2452.4s] the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there.
[2453.68s] Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll
[2455.44s] do it. And we&#39;re back. And then on the
[2460.0s] big money show also for the full hour as
[2462.48s] with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank
[2464.16s] him for putting me on as company, which
[2466.48s] means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is
[2468.8s] a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want
[2472.56s] to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way
[2474.8s] is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh
[2477.92s] producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg,
[2480.8s] Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and
[2483.04s] Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see
[2485.52s] Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in
[2488.8s] here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh
[2490.88s] President Trump was very happy to
[2492.319s] announce that he got the other countries
[2494.0s] to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s
[2497.44s] winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah.
[2499.28s] Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those
[2501.119s] negotiations when you just drop 30,000
[2503.2s] pound bunker busters on Iran and was
[2505.28s] successful in quelling their nuclear
[2507.68s] ambitions. So, I think it was very very
[2509.52s] successful. I think President Trump has
[2510.88s] wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought
[2512.16s] them along and now he closed the deal as
[2514.4s] he&#39;s done over and over and over.
[2516.8s] Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for
[2518.48s] many that we need more intelligence to
[2520.24s] to make sure that we did obliterate
[2523.2s] those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you
[2524.88s] know, owning Boeing owning Boeing
[2527.2s] stocks, if you understand what those
[2528.8s] bunker busters do, these are not surface
[2530.72s] missiles that, you know, they go deep
[2533.119s] down and and remember, they&#39;ve been
[2534.64s] planning for this for how many years?
[2536.64s] Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go
[2538.64s] 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was
[2541.68s] talking about these these bunker busters
[2543.52s] 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there
[2545.76s] anybody in there while they were
[2546.96s] dropping the bombs after? No, I know.
[2548.56s] But was there anybody in there while
[2549.599s] they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t
[2550.8s] know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll
[2552.24s] tell you that. reporting that and it
[2554.319s] takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the
[2555.76s] tech sector higher. You can agree or
[2558.319s] disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah.
[2559.92s] Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just
[2561.76s] Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players,
[2563.76s] it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to
[2565.28s] see industrial companies become more
[2567.599s] productive. You&#39;re going to see
[2568.72s] companies across all sectors become more
[2570.56s] productive. I mean, when we talk about
[2572.24s] the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that
[2574.72s] we have right now, whether it&#39;s the
[2576.48s] ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals,
[2578.4s] whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with
[2579.839s] the permanent tax cuts coming, uh
[2582.24s] there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be
[2583.92s] constructive about. And what&#39;s really
[2585.839s] beautiful is sentiment is still so low.
[2588.72s] If you looked at the Bank of America
[2590.079s] fund manager survey last week, it was
[2592.24s] near COVID low levels. What does that
[2594.72s] mean? As more trade deals come out, as
[2596.72s] more good news, which part of the trade
[2598.079s] deals are good though, the
[2600.48s] or the put the genie model. We have a we
[2602.8s] have a BB block and we will go into that
[2604.8s] in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you
[2606.96s] always shephering the cats. Thank you.
[2608.8s] Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish
[2611.2s] on the trade deal front. Make your case.
[2614.319s] Yeah, listen, the mark market
[2615.92s] participants now have confidence in this
[2618.0s] administration&#39;s level of kind of
[2620.0s] rational behavior when it comes to the
[2622.24s] economy and when it comes to markets.
[2623.599s] Look, we have an election next year. uh
[2625.839s] we saw we pushed it to a certain level.
[2628.16s] But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he
[2629.92s] Trump always comes out with a huge ask.
[2632.24s] Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He
[2633.92s] he kind of punches you in the face and
[2635.52s] then he offers you an ice pack and and
[2637.119s] you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh
[2639.359s] and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing
[2640.64s] with the negotiation here. What we have
[2642.56s] right now is still some $300 billion
[2645.04s] coming in from tariffs just at the 10%
[2647.359s] level. If he had started at 10%, where
[2649.599s] would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay,
[2651.599s] so he started big. 10% looks like a
[2654.0s] deal. And what we have to focus on is
[2656.72s] non-tariff barriers. He wants markets
[2659.359s] opened everywhere for US businesses to
[2661.76s] expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a
[2663.52s] core part that people are less focused
[2665.2s] on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%.
[2667.28s] They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re
[2668.96s] going to be pleasantly surprised by the
[2671.359s] amount of fairness in bilateral trade
[2674.319s] moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody
[2676.8s] sober in Washington right now because
[2678.72s] they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors?
[2680.4s] Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s
[2681.839s] no question about it. We got to get
[2682.96s] spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell
[2684.72s] you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue
[2688.48s] is not really spending because you can&#39;t
[2690.16s] austere your way down to, you know, 50%
[2693.119s] debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going
[2695.119s] to do it when you&#39;re this far past is
[2697.52s] growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend
[2699.68s] these tax cuts. We got to continue with
[2701.52s] deregulation. In 19 The last time we had
[2704.48s] 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we
[2708.56s] were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we
[2711.28s] did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew
[2714.16s] massively above trend and inflation ran
[2718.319s] a little bit above trend. If the world
[2719.92s] was destroyed because of World War II,
[2721.599s] we were the only You had rebuilding.
[2723.119s] Yeah. We were the only game in town. I
[2724.72s] mean, we have a different economy right
[2726.0s] now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3%
[2728.8s] growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So,
[2730.56s] remember that. So, you do have to have
[2732.16s] some austerity here. And there&#39;s no
[2733.68s] austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl,
[2735.599s] to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing
[2737.599s] the natives are getting restless at the
[2739.04s] Fed. Three people came out against
[2740.48s] Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers.
[2743.76s] He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing
[2746.24s] us $600 billion a year in interest
[2748.16s] payments. You know who is destroying is
[2750.0s] the millennials. 72 million people
[2752.16s] trying to start families, housing
[2754.0s] formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it
[2755.839s] with bas
[2757.839s] not on the table. Listen, Bessant can
[2762.4s] issue shortterm and buy in the long long
[2765.52s] end of the curve. Do an operation twist
[2767.119s] like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly
[2770.079s] what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to
[2771.92s] artificially keep the 10-year, but it
[2774.64s] just it you cannot finance long-term
[2778.0s] long-term your your your liabil
[2779.839s] long-term liabilities with short-term
[2781.359s] debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just
[2783.359s] say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve
[2785.04s] seen this playbook before in so many
[2786.72s] blue cities across the country. It
[2788.56s] doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a
[2790.24s] colleague a couple weeks ago when I was
[2791.76s] on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in
[2794.0s] Miami. He moved his hedge fund business
[2795.68s] down to Miami about when Delasio was in.
[2798.24s] He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York
[2800.319s] and London were the center of the world.
[2802.319s] Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless
[2804.96s] we change the policies and what what do
[2806.72s] those two jurisdictions have in common?
[2808.96s] Business friendly policies, business
[2811.04s] friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re
[2812.4s] going to get more of the same. I got I
[2814.72s] was there recently. Thank you for being
[2817.28s] with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s
[2819.04s] always great to see you.&quot; coming up
[2822.319s] and we&#39;re back. And then I had the
[2824.8s] pleasure to join Brad Smith today on
[2827.92s] Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give
[2830.72s] you the best clips. Uh want to thank
[2833.52s] Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne
[2836.319s] Reed will listen in now just after the
[2838.56s] opening bill. We appreciate it.
[2841.28s] On Wall Street, strategists see AI and
[2843.599s] economic data replacing tariffs and the
[2845.599s] tax bill as the big focus for investors
[2847.68s] going forward. Barclay strategist
[2849.68s] expecting more gains for stocks with AI
[2851.599s] driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve
[2853.52s] got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill
[2855.04s] Capital Chairman and managing member.
[2856.72s] Thomas, great to have you here on set
[2858.4s] with us today. Great to be with you,
[2859.68s] Brad. Absolutely. I I had to try and
[2861.2s] squeeze your question in with our
[2862.88s] previous guest, Dan Ives. But I got to
[2864.48s] know as well, since you are also very
[2866.96s] closely tracking this space in AI, how
[2869.44s] are you looking at AI and how it&#39;s
[2870.8s] playing into the broader market rally
[2872.88s] right now? Yeah, look, I think Dan is
[2875.52s] spot on. the demand uh exceeds supply by
[2878.319s] 10 to one and that that&#39;s the issue with
[2879.92s] Nvidia right now. They their business
[2882.24s] model depends on the kindness of
[2883.68s] strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has
[2886.4s] limited their revenue growth each
[2888.079s] quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all
[2890.0s] they can fulfill. So for the next phase
[2892.16s] of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see
[2894.96s] those fabs get finished by Taiwan and
[2897.119s] semiconductor to increase capacity and I
[2899.839s] think the dark horse that no one&#39;s
[2901.119s] paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a
[2902.319s] stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph
[2906.16s] in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this
[2908.88s] week. And I think part of that is Lip
[2910.64s] Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the
[2912.72s] other part is they&#39;re the only game in
[2914.319s] town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready
[2916.64s] to spike the football and the touchdown.
[2918.24s] There are there are chips being tested
[2919.92s] on their fabs and I think if they can be
[2922.48s] a part of that supply solution to Nvidia
[2925.359s] and others, uh, that could be kind of a
[2927.68s] dark horse. So while you see maybe
[2929.119s] Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it
[2931.839s] right, it could be meaningful. You know,
[2934.16s] that also raises a similar question that
[2935.76s] we had brought up in our previous
[2936.88s] conversation with regard to how many of
[2938.559s] those chips will able will be able to be
[2940.559s] shipped to other parts of the world if
[2943.04s] so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel
[2945.119s] get to this point has really been
[2946.64s] prioritized at bringing up and scaling
[2948.88s] up production here in the US. Yeah.
[2951.52s] Well, I I think once they get that
[2953.599s] production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the
[2955.359s] limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I
[2957.839s] don&#39;t think they need to be
[2958.96s] bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to
[2960.48s] be so much unlimited demand that anyone
[2962.559s] that can produce, even second tier,
[2964.4s] that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just
[2965.68s] be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way,
[2968.559s] that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they
[2970.319s] are the leader of mediocre chips. And
[2972.16s] and and by the way, as they bring this
[2973.76s] capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did
[2976.079s] unbelievable things at Cadence Designs.
[2977.92s] That was a multi multi multibagger. No
[2980.16s] one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it.
[2981.92s] They&#39;re going to be part of the
[2982.96s] solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia.
[2984.559s] It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s
[2986.64s] going to help boring, normal businesses
[2989.2s] that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan
[2992.24s] alluded to, which is going to be huge,
[2993.839s] which no one&#39;s looking at right now.
[2995.04s] Right now, you think AI, you think, you
[2996.8s] know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you
[2999.44s] think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries
[3001.44s] are also going to be real businesses.
[3003.2s] what needs to continue to take place or
[3005.52s] transpire within business spending
[3008.16s] towards AI to really continue to allow
[3011.2s] the AI trade to to keep its foothold on
[3014.48s] this market and be the the kind of core
[3016.4s] barometer of the investment psyche if
[3018.64s] you will. Yeah. That you know it&#39;s
[3020.24s] really interesting because you see the
[3022.559s] Mag 7 and and there&#39;s like a good news
[3025.28s] is they&#39;re benefiting from the AI trade.
[3027.119s] The bad news is their earnings growth is
[3029.599s] collapsing because they are doing all
[3031.44s] this capex. So Q1 of this year earnings
[3034.319s] growth of Mag 7 was 27%. Q1 of next year
[3037.599s] 2026 earnings growth is going to be 10.2
[3040.64s] but the multiples have not really
[3042.4s] compressed. Then you take the
[3044.319s] unmagnificent 493 all the boring
[3046.4s] companies that are going to benefit from
[3047.839s] these technologies in terms of
[3049.44s] implementation.
[3050.96s] Their earnings growth was negative. It&#39;s
[3052.8s] going to be 10.3% and the multiple is
[3055.52s] meaningfully lower. So I think there&#39;s a
[3057.52s] lot of uh unexpected AI opportunities.
[3061.28s] If you take Brad Jacobs for instance, he
[3063.28s] does all these rollups QXO where he buys
[3066.079s] boring businesses, building supply
[3067.839s] companies, etc., and he goes in and he
[3070.079s] doubles Ibida with technology. He&#39;s a
[3072.559s] huge implement of these technologies in
[3075.52s] boring businesses. GXO Logistics,
[3078.0s] they&#39;re one of the first businesses
[3080.079s] using humanoid robots to help move the
[3083.44s] stuff in the different distribution
[3085.44s] centers and warehouses. So, it&#39;s pretty
[3087.04s] wild. I&#39;ve got Brad Jacobs&#39;s book on my
[3088.88s] desk. Thank you for sending that, Brad,
[3090.24s] by the way. from one Brad to another.
[3091.839s] Just lastly on this topic here, because
[3093.68s] we&#39;re going to discuss a range of topics
[3095.28s] throughout the morning here, but as you
[3097.2s] think through the leaders of the tech
[3099.76s] rally right now versus the rotation that
[3102.24s] we could see, names that have been
[3103.599s] underappreciated, where are those parts
[3105.68s] of that trade? Yeah, I think you know
[3108.72s] the market&#39;s going to continue to push
[3110.079s] higher for the next four weeks. Why?
[3111.52s] Partially because of global liquidity is
[3113.599s] back at an all-time high. Partially
[3115.119s] because earnings expectations are really
[3117.119s] low. they&#39;ve taken him down from 9.3% to
[3119.76s] 4.9%.
[3121.359s] Uh so that&#39;s going to drive the bus. Mag
[3123.92s] 7 is kind of back up to the top of the
[3125.839s] range despite earnings growth
[3128.24s] deceleration. So I do think as you kind
[3131.2s] of stabilize after we make those new
[3132.64s] highs and everyone gets euphoric and
[3134.16s] tech&#39;s got to push it up because of the
[3135.68s] weight in the indices. I think that
[3137.52s] second half of the year where you&#39;re
[3138.96s] going to benefit is uh the unmagnificent
[3141.76s] 493. But it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m looking
[3144.559s] at today uh small caps are outperforming
[3147.839s] the NASDAQ. So Russell 2000
[3149.68s] outperforming the NASDAQ, outperforming
[3151.28s] the Dow Jones, outperforming the S&amp;P
[3153.04s] 500. That is the the small cap index is
[3156.559s] the most shorted in history right now.
[3159.92s] And these are the type of companies that
[3161.359s] benefit from these technologies. And uh
[3163.52s] and I think you&#39;re going to see the back
[3164.64s] half a big surprise in the 493 in small
[3167.68s] caps in companies that will be
[3169.28s] beneficiaries of the great things that
[3171.2s] the Nvidia of the world are providing.
[3172.96s] All right, Thomas, we got a lot more to
[3174.48s] discuss here. You&#39;re with us all
[3175.68s] morning. We&#39;ve got much more on Catalyst
[3178.24s] as well here. Markets action, of course,
[3180.72s] some of your top picks for the round two
[3182.4s] of the NBA draft as well. If you want,
[3184.24s] you&#39;re watching Market Catalyst. We got
[3185.599s] a lot to get to. Stay tuned.
[3190.4s] Still here with me, we&#39;ve got Thomas
[3191.839s] Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and
[3193.68s] Managing Member here. So, as we think
[3196.079s] about the SLR, of course, as we&#39;re
[3199.359s] hearing from Fed Chair Jal, who was
[3201.04s] commenting on it during his two-day
[3202.72s] stint on Capitol Hill, both discussing
[3205.44s] with the House Financial Services
[3206.72s] Committee and then additionally with uh
[3208.48s] the Senate yesterday here, this question
[3210.88s] came up. The SLR was supposed to act as
[3213.2s] a backs stop to riskbased capital
[3215.2s] requirements. Too often the SLR acts as
[3217.599s] a binding requirement for US banks. They
[3219.599s] went on to ask, would you agree that
[3221.44s] adjusting the SLR would free up capital
[3223.359s] for banks to invest more in treasury
[3225.359s] markets and other low-risk assets that
[3227.52s] would be beneficial to families and
[3228.96s] businesses across the country? And on
[3231.599s] net he agreed. So what is the
[3233.92s] significance of that? What should bank
[3235.76s] expect from this point forward? This is
[3238.4s] the biggest news of the summer, okay?
[3240.16s] And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what
[3242.88s] it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own
[3245.28s] a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going
[3246.64s] to have to post capital against it. So,
[3248.079s] they can do that. They can get the
[3249.68s] yield. And banks preference, they tend
[3252.4s] to buy on the short end of the curve.
[3253.839s] So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does
[3256.559s] that really help in in the argument
[3258.8s] people make, well, what&#39;s the difference
[3259.839s] if if Powell cuts because the 10-year
[3262.16s] yield dictates the the mortgage rates.
[3264.48s] Um, what happens is they can issue
[3266.72s] shortterm and do an operation twist like
[3269.28s] they did in 2012. Besson can do it at
[3271.2s] the Treasury and buy in the longer end
[3273.52s] of the curve, which could bring down the
[3276.64s] 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points.
[3280.8s] If that happens, you could see a 30-year
[3283.599s] fixed rate mortgage by the end of this
[3285.599s] year in the high fives, below 6%. Once
[3289.839s] that happens, the demand for housing is
[3292.079s] going to be off the charts because
[3293.2s] basically Powell has delayed the dreams
[3295.68s] of 72 million millennials by
[3297.839s] artificially holding rates 200 basis
[3300.319s] points above inflation. Highly
[3303.04s] restrictive. And you see the average uh
[3306.24s] age of a new home purchase has gone up
[3308.96s] so much since Powell has has been 38
[3311.52s] now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late
[3314.079s] to start a family. It becomes late to
[3315.68s] have kids. So, a whole generation has
[3317.28s] been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if
[3320.4s] and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed
[3324.4s] chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame
[3326.96s] duck for the rest of his term because
[3328.8s] the market will start to price. And
[3330.24s] let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure.
[3332.16s] Very dovish. The market will begin to
[3334.079s] price in 200 basis points of cuts in
[3336.16s] 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero
[3339.44s] power from that point forward. So when
[3341.28s] he says the end of September, he&#39;s
[3342.72s] basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or
[3345.44s] I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to
[3346.72s] move in July or you got to move in
[3348.24s] September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow
[3349.76s] Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out
[3352.0s] even if you want to stay in the chair
[3353.119s] for six more months. That&#39;s really
[3354.48s] interesting. Uh Thomas, you&#39;re sticking
[3356.16s] with us for much more to break down
[3358.079s] throughout this hour. Next, all of
[3360.319s] markets action ahead. Stay tuned. You&#39;re
[3361.839s] watching Market Catalysts.
[3364.88s] Kattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation
[3366.88s] there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick.
[3369.44s] First up, Kratos Defense and Security
[3371.599s] Solutions. Not one we talk about all the
[3373.2s] time, but they are offering nearly 13
[3374.96s] million shares of its common stock
[3376.72s] today. Worth roughly $500 million. The
[3379.92s] technology company plans to use the
[3381.599s] proceeds for expansion of its existing
[3384.24s] national security programs, new
[3385.92s] acquisitions, and to pay down debt and
[3388.24s] expenses. Shares are falling after the
[3390.16s] announcement. I want to bring in Thomas
[3391.599s] Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital
[3393.119s] Chairman and managing member here. Uh
[3395.44s] shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about
[3396.96s] 1.8% here. Where does this company fit
[3400.0s] within the broader kind of defense
[3402.24s] mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve
[3404.319s] seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s
[3406.24s] dilutive. So, the shares are down a
[3408.319s] little bit. The good news is they
[3409.839s] couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh,
[3411.359s] which is what bankers tend to do. Uh, 5%
[3413.839s] of GDP spending coming out of NATO for
[3416.48s] all these nations. So, uh, good good
[3418.319s] time to go out with an equity offering
[3419.76s] for a defense company. Unmanned systems,
[3422.319s] satellite business, missile defense.
[3424.319s] It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what
[3425.76s] everyone&#39;s been focused on this week.
[3427.359s] They raised a half a billion dollars.
[3429.119s] They can grow, they can expand, and
[3430.799s] they&#39;re going to benefit from the
[3431.76s] trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark
[3433.44s] raising its price target to $48 from 40.
[3436.88s] They maintain their buy rating on this
[3438.64s] stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly
[3440.72s] what this means in terms of how that
[3443.119s] funding and how that uh capital gets
[3445.599s] infused into the business and put to
[3447.2s] work as well for some of those scaling
[3448.96s] efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking
[3450.64s] Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting
[3452.72s] third quarter estimates that beat the
[3454.319s] streets estimates of both the top and
[3456.0s] bottom lines here. The electrical
[3458.0s] equipment producer saw revenue jump over
[3460.319s] 20% year-over-year. The company, which
[3462.799s] makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales
[3465.2s] top $1 billion in the latest quarter.
[3468.0s] And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the
[3469.44s] upside right now by about 6% here,
[3472.4s] sending the shares up above 300 305 now
[3475.76s] dollars a share right now intraday here,
[3477.76s] Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this
[3479.68s] is a preview of coming attractions. I
[3481.359s] think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning
[3483.359s] season with very low expectations.
[3485.44s] Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you
[3487.119s] remember the Bank of America fund
[3488.48s] manager survey from last week,
[3490.4s] institutional managers have lower
[3492.24s] sentiment that they did than they did
[3493.76s] during the COVID lows. And even going
[3495.599s] back to the great financial, it&#39;s
[3496.96s] starting to come off the bottom. But you
[3498.799s] don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is
[3500.96s] that low among, you know, 222 managers
[3503.599s] they serve surveyed with a half a
[3505.2s] trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re
[3506.64s] playing catch-up and and companies like
[3508.319s] Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re
[3510.24s] going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really
[3511.68s] interesting. Uh the chairman, president,
[3513.44s] and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net
[3515.839s] sales, expanded our adjusted operating
[3517.76s] profit and adjusted operating profit
[3519.76s] margin, and increased their adjusted
[3521.44s] diluted earnings per share, generated
[3523.76s] strong cash flow, allocated capital
[3525.599s] effectively. That kind of hits on all
[3526.96s] the check boxes that investors are
[3528.319s] looking for going into this report. So
[3529.76s] we want to see these beats and we want
[3531.2s] to see the the raised guidance and
[3532.72s] that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme
[3534.319s] in coming weeks. Absolutely. And finally
[3536.16s] here, McCormack beating expectations for
[3538.48s] its second quarter. McCormack also
[3540.319s] reiterated its full year 2025 guidance
[3542.72s] with the company&#39;s CEO saying they have
[3544.64s] quote robust plans to mitigate current
[3546.799s] tariff related costs. That&#39;s despite
[3548.96s] several potential headwinds for the
[3550.4s] consumer staple market, including
[3552.079s] dietary changes, trade uncertainty, and
[3554.559s] inflation. You&#39;re taking a look at
[3555.92s] shares of McCormack higher by about 5.3%
[3558.559s] on the back of these results. We were
[3559.839s] talking in the break about how much I
[3561.119s] take pride in in my own seasonings and
[3563.359s] the cooking of the proteins necessarily.
[3565.92s] Uh you got to have a little flavor in
[3567.359s] there. Yeah, there&#39;s no question about
[3568.64s] it. And I&#39;m looking at, you know, I look
[3570.96s] at sectors, they call me turnaround
[3572.319s] time, I like to buy businesses that are
[3573.599s] out of favor. I&#39;m looking at consumer
[3575.359s] staples and defensives and I&#39;m you&#39;re
[3576.88s] seeing a lot in that group, whether it&#39;s
[3578.48s] Craft Hind, there was some recent news
[3580.16s] out Mills, Hormeell. Uh these are all
[3583.2s] kind of left for dead stock. So, you
[3584.799s] know, you seeing McCormick&#39;s earnings,
[3586.64s] this might be a preview of coming
[3587.76s] attractions for some of those that have
[3589.04s] kind of been uh uh unfavored of late or
[3592.4s] unseasoned of late. Uh and uh maybe
[3595.52s] coming through this earning season, they
[3596.96s] they start to get interesting,
[3597.92s] particularly when volatility picks up in
[3599.44s] the fall and money moves a little bit
[3601.119s] more defensively. So, keep your eye on
[3603.52s] consumer staples, uh packaged products
[3606.319s] and and the like. If it wasn&#39;t so hot
[3608.24s] outside, I&#39;d be ready to go outside in
[3609.76s] season with some McCormick, but it&#39;s
[3611.2s] pretty uh it&#39;s pretty toasty, so I don&#39;t
[3612.72s] need to be by the grill. Thomas, stick
[3614.48s] around. We&#39;ve got more here. You can
[3615.92s] scan the QR code below to track the best
[3617.52s] and worst performing stocks with Yahoo
[3619.2s] Finance&#39;s trending tickers page. All
[3621.52s] your markets action straight ahead. Stay
[3623.119s] tuned. You&#39;re watching Market Catalyst
[3626.079s] into the conversation because you did
[3627.44s] not mince words on the Fed&#39;s role within
[3630.16s] this earlier. So given what we&#39;re seeing
[3632.64s] transpire within the housing market
[3634.0s] right now, to what extent is that the
[3635.44s] Fed, to what extent is that also just a
[3637.76s] byproduct of people needing to figure
[3640.559s] out, okay, how much home can they
[3642.48s] afford? The the affordability issue and
[3644.799s] then the number of people that are also
[3646.48s] just still sitting on their homes
[3648.48s] because they got locked in at very good
[3650.0s] rates. Well, that&#39;s the problem. I mean,
[3651.599s] you run rates 200 basis points above
[3654.24s] inflation, you have unintended
[3655.839s] consequences. Number one,
[3657.2s] unaffordability for the 72 millennials
[3659.28s] who want to start a family. And number
[3660.96s] two is all these baby boomers that want
[3662.72s] to get out of their equity, but they&#39;re
[3664.0s] not going to sell a $2 million house,
[3665.52s] take out a million dollar equity, and
[3666.96s] then go into a 7% mortgage when they&#39;re
[3668.88s] in a 3% mortgage. So, I think the name
[3670.88s] of the game this summer is that the SLR
[3674.319s] is going to bring down the 10-year
[3675.839s] Treasury, 30 to 70 basis points. You&#39;re
[3678.64s] going to see 30-year fixed rate go below
[3681.2s] 6%. And at that level, I think you&#39;re
[3683.599s] going to see a huge amount of inventory.
[3685.04s] And then you look at the home builders,
[3686.64s] okay, who wants to risk capital building
[3688.96s] massive amounts of starter homes at 7%
[3691.44s] and have them sit in inventory? They
[3693.2s] can&#39;t make the investment and and this
[3695.599s] is the unintended consequence of one guy
[3698.48s] trying to protect his legacy and not be
[3700.079s] Arthur Burns. And the conditions of the
[3702.319s] economy are not and the demographics are
[3704.24s] nothing like they were in the 70s. Uh so
[3707.359s] they&#39;ve got to move and if they don&#39;t
[3708.96s] move, we&#39;re going to get a shadow Fed
[3710.559s] and that&#39;s going to move the market and
[3712.0s] he can just sit in the desk for seven
[3713.44s] months until he leaves. I mean, it&#39;s not
[3714.799s] fun being Fed Chair Jerome Pal because
[3716.64s] you are the face of the decisions that a
[3719.28s] body of people and Fed governors make
[3721.839s] within that committee. You know what, in
[3723.52s] fairness, you had autopilot in December
[3725.839s] 2018. You remember that crashed the S&amp;P
[3728.16s] 20% until Minutian came in and fixed it.
[3730.559s] You had transitory. So, listen, I mean,
[3733.599s] his legacy is his legacy. He&#39;s got a
[3735.28s] chance to do it right and go out a
[3736.64s] winner like Seinfeld. And he&#39;s missing
[3738.559s] the boat. So, he&#39;s got July. Let&#39;s see
[3740.48s] what happens in the next few weeks and
[3741.839s] he can be an absolute champion and help
[3743.76s] 72 million millennials get their
[3745.28s] families started and get in new houses,
[3746.72s] help the home builders. And by the way,
[3748.559s] it&#39;s 16 housing is 16.2% of GDP. You
[3752.0s] know how many jobs that creates that are
[3753.76s] being held up by this artificially
[3756.559s] restrictive environment. Claire, last
[3758.72s] word goes to you. What does this mean
[3760.0s] for the homebuilders? What are we
[3761.28s] hearing on the stronger Treasury
[3763.04s] auctions that took place the week prior
[3764.72s] to that as well? So what is the the
[3767.52s] larger implications that traders and
[3769.119s] investors are thinking through in their
[3770.48s] mindset? The most important thing here
[3772.0s] is the tax cuts. Okay. So we&#39;ve gone
[3773.839s] from bombing and tariffs to growth and
[3775.76s] deregulation. And growth is a function
[3777.76s] of the tax cuts uh as Brett is alluding
[3780.4s] to. It&#39;s a little bit stimulative here
[3782.319s] and and you can kind of talk a little
[3784.319s] bit more about that in in detail. I
[3786.64s] would just say uh so that&#39;s critical.
[3788.48s] So, you know, if tax rates were to go
[3790.559s] up, uh it&#39;s going to impact earnings.
[3792.48s] It&#39;s going to have a negative impact on
[3793.68s] the economy, hiring growth, the whole
[3795.039s] thing. So, that&#39;s not going to happen.
[3796.48s] We&#39;ve got uh the Treasury doing what
[3798.319s] they&#39;re doing with the SLR. We&#39;ve got
[3799.839s] the tax cuts coming in and animal
[3802.16s] spirits coming back because man
[3804.48s] management can plan. They can start to
[3807.2s] forecast, kind of understand the rules,
[3809.28s] whereas the first half of the year,
[3810.64s] everyone was uncertain. So, uh, Brett,
[3813.2s] how do you handicap this get getting
[3815.68s] done by July 4th or no vacation, no one
[3818.559s] goes home locking them in a room? You&#39;ve
[3820.24s] been through this process many times.
[3822.079s] Does this look any different or is this
[3823.52s] just the normal back and forth and
[3824.799s] eventually they get something done?
[3826.24s] Yeah, I mean, it does look like the
[3827.44s] normal process of back and forth. Um
[3829.599s] it&#39;s just that they are the the next Fed
[3832.72s] chair could be might look like in terms
[3835.2s] of commentary that we could hear hear
[3837.68s] from that person and a and almost shadow
[3839.68s] fed because that person wouldn&#39;t be
[3841.44s] going in until May 2026, but we&#39;d get
[3843.359s] more inclination through what they&#39;re
[3845.44s] willing to talk about openly and
[3846.96s] publicly and policy could be one of
[3849.359s] those one of those areas where the Fed
[3851.52s] typically will not comment on that and
[3853.599s] try to be apolitical. yet you would have
[3856.0s] someone who would be put forward in
[3857.76s] their name and have pretty much open
[3859.92s] season to say whatever they want leading
[3861.68s] up to that point. I I think it&#39;s less
[3863.119s] what they say and more who they are. So,
[3865.44s] you know, if Hassid&#39;s the guy, I I think
[3867.119s] the market starts to discount that
[3868.4s] pretty darn quick and that&#39;s going to
[3869.599s] have long-term implications in terms of
[3871.039s] refinancing the debt, the cost of the
[3872.48s] debt, etc. Uh but I have one last
[3874.799s] question for you, Brett. What what what
[3876.64s] do you think as the bill stands right
[3878.88s] now? uh what do you think that adds or
[3882.0s] detracts from GDP in the short term over
[3884.559s] the next 12 months if it went through
[3885.92s] today as is incremental benefit or uh
[3890.0s] drag? Yeah, it would be about about 40
[3892.72s] basis points positive. Wow. Um you know
[3895.2s] depending on how where you put some of
[3897.44s] the scoring um but yeah on on a from a
[3900.0s] deficit from fiscal impulse perspective
[3901.76s] 30 to 40 basis points positive for sure
[3904.24s] relative to trend. And so, you know,
[3906.319s] that&#39;s if trend is the Fed&#39;s trend is
[3908.88s] 18, you know, you&#39;re looking at 2-1. Our
[3910.88s] forecast is around 2% next year. Um, but
[3913.599s] again, a lot remains to be be seen. Fed
[3916.4s] chair, that&#39;s a whole different uh whole
[3918.4s] different whole different that&#39;s another
[3920.559s] hour. I think the the next one the next
[3922.799s] Fed chair, you know, you have to be
[3924.16s] careful as as you alluded to. You know,
[3926.24s] if if the market loses confidence that
[3928.96s] the Fed is independent, then your long
[3932.72s] end is going to is going to be a serious
[3934.96s] problem and it doesn&#39;t matter what how
[3936.48s] much you cut in the front end. Brethren,
[3938.24s] thanks so much for taking the time here.
[3939.44s] Joining us in studio, Thomas, thanks for
[3941.2s] staying with us for the conversation as
[3942.799s] well. You stick around, we&#39;ve got much
[3944.64s] more ahead. The brands that they own. I
[3946.48s] mean, this is a company we&#39;re talking
[3947.76s] about that not only has the swoosh, they
[3950.0s] also have, of course, as you were
[3951.2s] mentioning this new partnership with
[3952.48s] SKIMS. They&#39;ve been leading into some of
[3953.92s] those collaborations. And then
[3955.599s] additionally, they&#39;ve got Jordan Brand,
[3957.039s] which they&#39;ve leaned into. Oh yeah,
[3958.72s] don&#39;t forget Converse as well, where
[3960.48s] they just had one of their stars win the
[3962.4s] NBA Finals. So, all of these things
[3964.319s] considered here, they&#39;ve got different
[3965.68s] levers that they can pull. And my
[3967.28s] goodness, I don&#39;t know if you had the
[3969.2s] the Air Jordan 1&#39;s when they first came
[3970.96s] out, Thomas, but uh they&#39;re about to hit
[3973.44s] Jordan 40 right now, which is
[3976.88s] my Listen, the most important thing
[3979.039s] they&#39;ve got is Scotty Sheffler. You know
[3980.559s] it, I know it, everyone knows it. I love
[3982.72s] a great turnaround story. You know, you
[3984.16s] were going through all those negative
[3985.359s] points, Brooke, and all the analysts are
[3987.2s] so negative in the whole uh you know,
[3989.359s] trying to get past this. Yeah, it
[3990.72s] reminds me of other than that, how was
[3992.079s] the play, Mrs. Lincoln? But I love when
[3994.079s] when the market&#39;s so pessimistic. They
[3996.0s] did screw their their wholesalers to say
[3999.599s] it. They&#39;ve got to rebuild those
[4000.88s] relationships. They&#39;re going to uh you
[4003.44s] know, my nickname on the street is
[4004.72s] turnaround Tom. I would love to buy a
[4006.64s] lot of Nike. I should be buying a lot of
[4008.64s] Nike at these levels. I really hope it
[4010.64s] goes down a lot after earnings and maybe
[4012.319s] that&#39;ll be a new position, but um you
[4014.96s] know, I&#39;m betting on another turnaround
[4016.4s] specialist, Bracken Daryl, over at VF
[4018.4s] Corp. He&#39;s got his work cut out for him.
[4020.0s] He&#39;s going to turn that business. So, I
[4021.28s] I don&#39;t know if I want to be
[4022.319s] overexposed, but man, fresh capital. Uh
[4026.16s] if this thing is lower, I&#39;d probably be
[4028.0s] inclined to buy it with a 3 to 5 year
[4029.68s] view. Are you talking about a low below
[4031.76s] what we&#39;ve already seen? I think they
[4033.2s] struck 52 earlier. Yeah, I&#39;d love to see
[4035.599s] it approach that level. If it did, I&#39;
[4037.839s] I&#39;d be inclined like at some point you
[4039.92s] got to stop watching and step into the
[4041.52s] ring. Uh you look through I think the
[4044.0s] turnaround is going to be slower than
[4045.44s] the optimists think, but I think it&#39;s
[4047.119s] going to be certain. This is a this is a
[4048.72s] company of winners. They they they hire
[4050.64s] the best. They get the best athletes
[4052.4s] using their stuff. They got to get back
[4053.76s] to winning, and they will get back to
[4056.16s] winning, and they&#39;ve got to rebuild
[4057.359s] those relationships. So maybe we&#39;ll see
[4059.119s] some signs of that tonight. Uh I don&#39;t I
[4061.68s] don&#39;t anticipate it&#39;s going to flush out
[4063.28s] to the level that that would attract me.
[4065.119s] it probably we&#39;re at the stage where
[4066.96s] you&#39;re going to see some good news would
[4068.079s] be my expectation because expectations
[4069.839s] are so darn low. Yeah. And I do want to
[4071.68s] point out I still have Thomas Hayes,
[4073.359s] Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing
[4075.28s] member with me here. And as we&#39;re taking
[4077.44s] a look at shares of Black Rockck,
[4078.559s] they&#39;re up by about 1% here on the day.
[4080.96s] Is this really expected to move the dial
[4083.44s] longer term here? Why does it make sense
[4085.92s] for Black Rockck to do this? Yeah, I I
[4088.88s] think they&#39;re doing it because they can.
[4090.88s] Okay, it&#39;s a huge market. the idea is to
[4094.0s] democratize private equity. But you see
[4096.88s] they follow the trends. You know, first
[4098.88s] Larry Frink said uh Bitcoin was no good
[4102.0s] and then the thing took off and then he
[4103.839s] started offering it to the public with
[4105.12s] the ETFs etc. So I I do think that
[4108.159s] there&#39;s going to be a place this is
[4109.679s] going to be promoted by a lot of uh
[4111.44s] financial advisors. This is going to be
[4112.96s] a part of the portfolio. The beauty of
[4114.56s] private equity and private credit which
[4116.4s] have become so popular is that you have
[4120.239s] uh no marktomarket. So, it&#39;s perceived
[4122.88s] low volatility because they mark the
[4124.96s] assets what what we used to say during
[4126.96s] the great financial crisis, marked to
[4128.319s] make believe or mark to whatever. And
[4130.719s] you never really see a mark until the
[4132.64s] asset is worth zero until it&#39;s fully
[4134.799s] marked down. So, in a in a bull market
[4136.88s] like this, everything&#39;s marked up.
[4138.239s] Everyone&#39;s happy. There&#39;s no volatility.
[4139.92s] You don&#39;t see that daily volatility.
[4141.359s] Retail loves that. Institutions,
[4143.279s] institutional consultants love not
[4145.359s] having the volatility. They love their
[4146.96s] sharp ratios when they come in the
[4148.64s] 25-year-old with their clipboard. uh uh
[4151.359s] but when you take the marks the marks
[4153.759s] are big. So I I think there&#39;s going to
[4155.6s] be a place for this in in a lot of 401ks
[4158.64s] and and for a lot of retail investors
[4160.159s] are going to try their hand but as you
[4161.679s] move into a recessionary type of period
[4163.6s] these are the assets that you want to be
[4165.359s] careful of. Yeah I was taking a look at
[4166.799s] one of the charts from Torston Paulo
[4168.719s] chief economist saying private equity as
[4170.319s] a percentage of public equity market
[4172.0s] 2003 3.8% 2024 8.8% 8%. That&#39;s some of
[4176.08s] the growth here that we&#39;ve seen. Tom,
[4177.199s] it&#39;s been great to have you here on set
[4178.719s] with us. Thomas Hayes, who is uh of
[4181.04s] Great Hill Capital and taking some time
[4183.04s] here in New York with us. Thank you so
[4184.719s] much. Thanks for having me. That&#39;s it
[4185.759s] for Market Catalyst, everyone. I&#39;m Brad
[4187.199s] Smith. Thank you for watching. We&#39;ve got
[4188.56s] more Yahoo.
[4190.96s] And we&#39;re back. And then I want to thank
[4195.04s] Alexander Oapovich for including me in
[4197.52s] his article uh on the Wall Street
[4199.84s] Journal. And finally, uh, guess who is
[4203.28s] on CNBC this morning is Alex Chris from
[4208.32s] PayPal. They teamed up with the Big 10
[4211.04s] and Big 12 to enable payments to student
[4214.56s] athletes. Wait till you hear this
[4216.56s] interview. We&#39;re going to listen in now.
[4218.159s] Are there exactly 22 teams? Is that
[4220.48s] more? It&#39;s like the S&amp;P 500. Yeah. uh to
[4224.239s] enable college athletic departments to
[4226.239s] pay their student athletes directly
[4228.8s] through the financial platform. Uh this
[4231.12s] comes after the landmark June6 court
[4233.199s] ruling that allows schools to directly
[4235.76s] compensate uh student athletes starting
[4237.84s] on July 4th or July 1st. July 4th just
[4241.199s] comes out, doesn&#39;t it? Joining us now to
[4243.12s] make the announcement first on CNBC
[4245.04s] PayPal CEO Alex Chris uh and Big 12
[4248.8s] Commissioner uh Brent Yormack and
[4251.12s] Venmo&#39;s involved. I want to go back to
[4253.52s] college and u and get involved. Be an
[4255.84s] athlete. Yeah. Oh, that&#39;s right. You
[4257.76s] have to be an athlete. That cuts me out.
[4259.36s] Who wants to talk about how this came
[4261.12s] together? I guess I&#39;ll start. Um, first
[4263.44s] of all, thanks for having us. You&#39;re
[4264.719s] welcome. And I&#39;ll also start by saying
[4266.32s] there&#39;s never been a better time than
[4267.6s] right now for collegiate athletics for
[4269.12s] all the right reasons. And there was a
[4271.12s] landmark uh settlement recently uh where
[4273.679s] for the first time starting in uh July
[4276.08s] 1, we&#39;ll be revenue sharing with our
[4278.159s] student athletes. And um it does usher
[4281.52s] in uh a new age for collegiate athletics
[4284.4s] and our student athletes and we&#39;re
[4286.0s] incredibly excited about it. Uh over the
[4288.8s] last 14 months uh we&#39;ve been on an
[4291.28s] incredible journey with PayPal trying to
[4293.04s] find out where they could enter the
[4294.64s] ecosystem and with Revshare um and how
[4298.96s] ubiquitous PayPal and Venmo are in the
[4301.679s] on campuses and and in collegiate
[4303.76s] athletics lives of our student athletes.
[4306.56s] it made incredible sense uh to have them
[4309.76s] partner with us as we pay our student
[4311.6s] athletes. Um you know, when you think
[4314.32s] about PayPal and Venmo, um the the first
[4317.52s] and second most popular mobile payment
[4320.159s] apps in the US, there&#39;s 400 million uh
[4323.6s] customers globally when you think of
[4325.199s] consumers and merchants. Um so it just
[4328.719s] made so much sense given how they
[4331.199s] already infuse campus life. Uh I was
[4334.48s] given a number the other day. There&#39;s
[4336.0s] 19.8 million student athletes across the
[4338.96s] country and almost half currently use
[4340.719s] Venmo and we needed a platform and a
[4344.08s] partner that was safe and reliable. Um,
[4347.12s] and we found it with PayPal and Venmo.
[4348.8s] And Alex, I want to thank you and your
[4350.32s] entire team for all your hard work and
[4352.64s] for being on this journey with us. And
[4354.88s] it&#39;s a great day today for the Big 12,
[4357.04s] our student athletes, our campuses, the
[4359.52s] families of our student athletes. So,
[4362.0s] thank you so much. Well, I appreciate it
[4364.0s] and again, tremendous partnership. Uh,
[4366.0s] and as you said, it&#39;s this is now an
[4368.239s] opportunity to distribute funds to
[4370.239s] students, but that&#39;s not something that
[4371.52s] schools know how to do, but it&#39;s
[4373.199s] something that PayPal does every day.
[4374.88s] And so, our ability to distribute funds,
[4376.96s] our ability to now give students in the
[4380.239s] wallet that they use every day, right?
[4382.0s] Again, over half of college students
[4384.0s] already using Venmo. You know, I didn&#39;t
[4385.36s] think about it, though. It probably
[4386.48s] would have been an administrative
[4387.6s] nightmare for each of these schools to
[4388.96s] figure out how to pay these students.
[4390.239s] This is this is what we do. And so our
[4391.76s] ability to move money, distribute these
[4393.36s] funds, not only the revshare, but then
[4395.44s] ultimately NIL deals as well. Uh, and
[4397.76s] then, you know, this money is going into
[4399.199s] wallets that college students use every
[4400.88s] day. It&#39;s what their parents are putting
[4402.56s] money in for. It&#39;s what they&#39;re
[4404.08s] splitting the the pizza at lunch with
[4405.92s] their teammates for, and they&#39;ll soon be
[4408.4s] able to to make payments on their
[4409.679s] tuition as well. So, how does this work?
[4411.36s] Do you pay them to do these services, or
[4413.679s] is this like a branding opportunity for
[4415.84s] you to be able to say that you&#39;re doing
[4417.36s] this? It&#39;s a fully integrated
[4419.199s] partnership. Um that benefits obviously
[4421.679s] the brand of PayPal and Venmo, but also
[4423.92s] the conferences. Um they&#39;re not a
[4427.04s] vendor, they&#39;re a true partner and they
[4428.8s] will be in the ecosystem. And today
[4430.4s] obviously we&#39;re announcing um you know
[4433.04s] conference participation. But I would
[4435.84s] imagine that over time um this
[4438.719s] partnership will be infused throughout
[4440.8s] campuses all across the country. So that
[4443.28s] means you&#39;re not paying them. It&#39;s a
[4444.64s] partnership and they get something out
[4445.76s] of it too. What&#39;s that? You&#39;re not
[4447.04s] paying them to do it. We&#39;re not paying.
[4449.04s] No. And think of think about the
[4450.08s] partnership where you get the branding.
[4451.84s] And and on top of that, Neil, so think
[4453.36s] about the branding. Not only is this for
[4454.56s] college students on campus, but think of
[4456.4s] all the alumni that have come come to
[4458.239s] these amazing Big 12 schools. You know,
[4460.0s] we have we&#39;ll be offering Venmo debit
[4463.52s] cards just
[4466.08s] for anyone for anyone on campus, any
[4468.64s] alumni that can come in, sign up.
[4471.199s] Absolutely. Colorado. They&#39;re right.
[4473.52s] They&#39;re right there for you. We&#39;ve got
[4474.64s] them for every one of the schools to be
[4476.96s] able to allow a student to be able to
[4479.199s] come in, an alumni to be able to come
[4480.96s] in. This is great branding for us. And
[4482.48s] again, this is the financial instrument
[4484.8s] for the next generation and we even have
[4487.199s] one at the conference level um which
[4489.12s] we&#39;re excited about. But it&#39;s a great
[4491.28s] day for the student athletes and I am
[4493.6s] sure other conferences are going to
[4495.04s] embrace this opportunity. I was told
[4496.56s] last night the ACC is up next. So,
[4498.96s] you&#39;re going to see this program roll
[4501.199s] out across campuses uh throughout this
[4504.0s] country and I think it&#39;s the right thing
[4505.52s] to do. And again, did you go to them or
[4507.679s] did they come to you? Well, that&#39;s a
[4510.0s] great question. Um, you know, when I
[4512.32s] came on board at the Big 12, I wanted to
[4515.92s] try to create some meaningful strategic
[4517.6s] partnerships that could integrate what
[4521.36s] the schools are doing with the
[4522.56s] conference and go into the marketplace
[4524.719s] with a real good business solution. and
[4526.88s] we started talking 14 months ago. Um, it
[4530.08s] wasn&#39;t we weren&#39;t intending to land
[4531.679s] where we did today, but it was it&#39;s a
[4533.679s] great brand. Alex had just taken over.
[4535.92s] Um, they were looking to reimagine and
[4537.6s] reinvent their business, no different
[4538.96s] than we are. I mean, you&#39;ve got the
[4539.92s] demographic that everybody wants people
[4542.239s] at the start of their career. It&#39;s a
[4543.28s] young, very coveted demographic. That&#39;s
[4544.96s] a great point. And, um, they&#39;re already
[4548.0s] culturally relevant and connecting with
[4549.84s] that demographic. So, that was ideal for
[4551.92s] us. Um, but it&#39;s a very strategic
[4554.0s] partnership and I think you&#39;re going to
[4555.199s] see us do more and more things like this
[4556.8s] where campuses and the conference come
[4559.36s] together and provide great brands with
[4561.6s] solutions like we have here with PayPal
[4563.6s] and uh you&#39;re probably psyched. You&#39;ll
[4566.48s] get everybody. Who else who else would
[4569.199s] uh would compete with you with with
[4570.8s] other colleges? Well, look, we we will
[4574.48s] we are the best way to distribute the
[4576.239s] funds. And what&#39;s important is you need
[4577.92s] to have the wallet that the college
[4579.679s] students are using. They&#39;re not going to
[4580.88s] be adopting new new tools and technology
[4583.12s] as they&#39;re sitting there. They&#39;re
[4584.4s] already using Venmo. They&#39;re already
[4585.84s] using PayPal. Their parents are already
[4587.36s] using it. The ecosystem exists now. We
[4590.0s] get to work with our our critical
[4592.0s] partners here and be able to make it
[4593.36s] work. So, this it was a natural
[4595.199s] partnership. Uh it&#39;s a lot of work to
[4597.199s] make these come together. And I can&#39;t
[4598.64s] thank Brad and his team enough for for
[4600.8s] being able to pull all these schools
[4602.0s] together and make this happen. But
[4603.679s] again, this is we&#39;re we&#39;re very very
[4605.44s] excited about this. And it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
[4607.36s] new day for college athletics and and uh
[4609.84s] and for PayPal as well. I bet you can
[4612.239s] get some good seats.
[4615.52s] Alex can sit wherever he wants. I like
[4617.92s] that. We&#39;re going to make that happen,
[4619.199s] Phil. I like that. I promise you. That&#39;s
[4621.36s] amazing. Um the whole It&#39;s just
[4624.08s] mindboggling how quickly things are
[4625.679s] changing. I can&#39;t believe, you know,
[4627.28s] that that PayPal, which is now
[4629.36s] ubiquitous and has spawned so many
[4631.12s] great, you know, founders and
[4632.8s] entrepreneurs and now it&#39;s now the Big
[4635.12s] 12. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s just culturally
[4638.719s] it&#39;s just a major factor in all of our
[4640.719s] lives, isn&#39;t it? And and athletes
[4642.88s] getting paid, no one would have ever
[4644.239s] thought it is. And look, I I I joined 18
[4646.0s] months ago. One of the biggest questions
[4648.0s] we had was, can you grow Venmo? And you
[4650.88s] know, you&#39;re starting to see it now in
[4652.159s] in the results. We grew revenue over 20%
[4654.4s] last quarter. We&#39;ve got our pay with
[4656.64s] Venmo up 50%, our debit card up 40%. And
[4660.08s] partnerships like this just enable us to
[4661.92s] to reach our customers. I&#39;ve been with
[4663.36s] PayPal for a very long time. I got Vimmo
[4665.84s] too. Now every time I go to pay with um
[4669.76s] PayPal, it asks me if I want to do the
[4671.52s] pay now pay later option instead of just
[4674.239s] paying right you know I now pay later
[4676.719s] instead of just paying now for
[4677.92s] everything. How much of your business is
[4679.36s] that? That new kind of idea of get it
[4682.96s] now pay for it later. Yeah. Look, and
[4684.719s] it&#39;s connected to to the younger
[4686.0s] demographic. We are finding more and
[4687.6s] more college students and younger
[4688.96s] demographic wanting to pay with debit
[4690.48s] and buy now pay later as their credit
[4692.0s] option. And so our pay later, buy now
[4694.159s] pay later uh product is growing very
[4696.239s] quickly. Uh and it&#39;s becoming we grew
[4698.64s] 20% over 20% last quarter in buy now pay
[4701.28s] later. And so uh it&#39;s becoming the way
[4703.84s] that people want to spend. They don&#39;t
[4705.28s] want credit cards as as often. They want
[4707.36s] debit and buy now pay later. and they
[4709.04s] can come to.
[4710.88s] And we&#39;re back. And quote of the week,
[4714.48s] Charlie Munger, a lot of people with
[4715.92s] high IQs are terrible investors because
[4717.76s] they&#39;ve got terrible temperaments. Uh,
[4722.08s] cool is the name of the game. Patience
[4724.32s] buy high quality businesses when they&#39;re
[4726.0s] temporarily marked down and sit on your
[4728.159s] hands or go play golf. The secret to
[4730.32s] success is to do the unc to do the
[4732.719s] common thing uncommonly well. Everyone
[4735.52s] invests. Very few people do it well
[4737.76s] because they&#39;re always chasing the shiny
[4739.6s] object. They&#39;re always sucked into the
[4741.44s] action, always chasing headline stocks,
[4744.159s] following the herd, and eventually
[4745.84s] leading to slaughter.
[4751.04s] Moving along, let&#39;s get down to the
[4753.92s] data. Uh here we are. We&#39;ve got um
[4758.88s] this is from Bank of America. Let&#39;s get
[4762.159s] this going here. There we go. Maybe I
[4765.44s] can do it this way. Yes. Okay. Net debt
[4768.0s] to market cap and US debt to GDP. This
[4771.36s] is pretty interesting. It shows that
[4773.12s] while the country&#39;s balance sheet is
[4776.0s] near historic
[4778.159s] uh historically bad, corporate balance
[4781.92s] sheet S&amp;P 500 net debt to market cap is
[4785.92s] at record good. Okay. So debt to market
[4790.08s] cap is around 10% whereas debt to GDP is
[4793.28s] around 120%. I would not have guessed
[4795.84s] that for the S&amp;P. That&#39;s pretty amazing.
[4798.4s] Here&#39;s from Fundstrat. Uh non-commercial
[4801.28s] futures percentage open interest. So
[4804.08s] this is back to contrarian buy levels
[4806.719s] what we saw near COVID lows which is
[4808.96s] unbelievable. We talked about the
[4810.88s] sentiment uh today with Brad Smith. Uh
[4813.76s] these are just still not numbers you see
[4815.28s] near top. So we&#39;re going to run higher.
[4817.44s] uh total money market funds still 7%.
[4820.239s] When uh rates come down, all that money
[4823.12s] is going to be forced back into
[4824.56s] equities. They&#39;re right now just sitting
[4826.239s] sitting out collecting four and a half
[4828.239s] 5%.
[4832.4s] That game is going to be over. They&#39;re
[4835.199s] going to be forced back out on the risk
[4836.56s] curve. Uh US dollar bare market is a 20
[4840.08s] to 40% bare market just getting started.
[4843.04s] Uh dollar continues to weaken over time.
[4845.04s] We probably get short-term bounce. Bull
[4847.52s] bear indicator not yet at extreme.
[4849.36s] Gasoline prices below average for the
[4851.28s] past four years. That&#39;s not
[4852.64s] inflationary. Jay Powell weaker summer
[4855.84s] performance that could be we might have
[4858.32s] had a pull forward on the correction
[4860.64s] this year. So I wouldn&#39;t be too uh
[4863.76s] skittish yet. And I think even August,
[4865.76s] September, October is more going to be
[4867.44s] like sideways chop than a than another
[4869.44s] big crash. Uh and then we&#39;re going to
[4871.92s] end a year higher. uh Raymond James,
[4876.08s] it&#39;s going to be more of a rotation. Uh
[4877.84s] I mean, if you&#39;re just in indices, then
[4879.6s] yeah, maybe worry a little bit, but if
[4881.199s] you&#39;re in uh the right stocks, you
[4883.679s] probably actually it&#39;ll be the opposite.
[4885.76s] When the indices are doing weak, those
[4887.6s] will start to do better.
[4890.159s] Uh moving along, this is from Kelly
[4892.88s] O&#39;Grady, who I knew very well at uh when
[4895.76s] she was at Fox Business. She&#39;s now at
[4897.28s] CNBC News. She asked the best question
[4899.6s] of the entire conference with the Fed.
[4903.28s] Um,
[4908.159s] so here&#39;s what she said and uh this is
[4911.04s] some coahones and I give her a lot of
[4912.639s] credit. You spent years talking about
[4914.639s] how you&#39;re data dependent. Be more
[4916.239s] direct. Now you&#39;re making decisions
[4918.0s] looking forward. Doesn&#39;t the data you&#39;re
[4919.76s] seeing today indicate there should be a
[4921.199s] rate cut? And then she says, uh, why
[4924.719s] wouldn&#39;t it be why wouldn&#39;t it be better
[4927.12s] to have rates that are more neutral as
[4929.199s] the economy heads into this period of
[4931.36s] very high uncertainty? You said the
[4933.52s] inflation data is in a good place. We
[4936.48s] don&#39;t know how tariffs impact things.
[4938.4s] When you cut rates in December, there
[4941.44s] was still the whatif of tariffs. So,
[4944.96s] what made you feel comfortable cutting
[4947.36s] when inflation was higher and still the
[4949.76s] uncertainty of tariffs than where it is
[4951.92s] today and you didn&#39;t cut today? I mean,
[4954.159s] talk about the the question of the hour.
[4956.96s] Good for Kelly. Uh, that was awesome.
[4959.84s] Uh, more shelter disinflation likely in
[4962.4s] the pipeline. I think as rates go down,
[4964.56s] usually when you think of rates going
[4965.84s] down, prices go up. I think this is
[4967.6s] going to be the exact opposite this
[4969.199s] cycle. What&#39;s going to happen is a lot
[4971.52s] of homes are going to hit the market
[4973.44s] that have been trapped in 3% mortgages
[4975.84s] with millions of equity that are all
[4978.159s] going to hit the market at once and make
[4980.48s] homes more affordable. Share of
[4982.88s] Democrats and Republicans who expect
[4984.4s] stock to go up in the next 6 months. No
[4987.44s] Democrats, lots of Republicans. Uh
[4990.08s] median down payment falls for the first
[4991.92s] time in nearly two years. US metros
[4995.52s] where you can buy a luxury home for less
[4997.04s] than a million is now down to seven was
[4999.12s] at 35.
[5002.0s] Japan&#39;s core in thanks to Jay uh Japan&#39;s
[5005.28s] core inflation hits highest level since
[5007.76s] January 2023 putting pressure on BOJ to
[5010.8s] raise rates carry trade unwind. Uh
[5013.04s] you&#39;ll see more pressure on MAG 7 in the
[5015.199s] fall.
[5017.44s] uh Lenar&#39;s gross margin on home sales
[5020.8s] for second quarter uh again lowest
[5023.679s] levels in six years that&#39;s going to
[5026.48s] continue. Uh the arms dealers will do
[5029.52s] well. They are going to continue to have
[5030.96s] margin compression. Oil prices must rise
[5033.52s] significantly to hit stocks durably. Uh
[5036.4s] they&#39;re at low levels. I wouldn&#39;t hold
[5038.32s] your breath on that. International value
[5040.0s] stocks are outperforming this year by a
[5042.0s] wide margin.
[5043.679s] Uh Iran&#39;s oil exports mostly go to
[5047.199s] China. It was interesting that Trump
[5048.8s] said that Iran can still export to
[5052.159s] China,
[5056.4s] wanting to get Iran to the table and
[5058.32s] wanting to get uh China&#39;s deal inked up.
[5063.84s] Real S&amp;P 500 in index versus conflicts.
[5067.679s] You can see these conflicts over the
[5069.199s] last uh 150 years and how the S&amp;P trends
[5074.0s] up over time. Weak US dollar
[5076.0s] environments create positive returns for
[5078.0s] financial markets and risky assets. What
[5081.04s] are the biggest beneficiaries when the
[5082.8s] dollar index falls 10%. Emerging
[5085.04s] markets, equity, we&#39;ve been talking
[5086.4s] about that for ages. Annual realized and
[5088.96s] bottom up consensus EPS growth
[5091.199s] estimates. What&#39;s going to be the
[5092.639s] biggest? Again, this continues to be
[5095.04s] updated. uh Russell by far 2025 18%
[5099.76s] earnings growth relative to the S&amp;P of
[5101.84s] seven. Uh next year 37% earnings growth
[5105.04s] relative to the S&amp;P of 14. Concentration
[5108.56s] of S&amp;P market cap in earnings and the 10
[5111.12s] largest inst index cont constituents. Uh
[5115.44s] 10 largest constituents make up 38% of
[5117.84s] the market cap but only 30% of the
[5119.84s] earnings and that amount of earnings is
[5122.08s] declining. This shows a cyclical
[5126.239s] uh move for the dollar over the last 50
[5129.44s] years. It runs in about uh six or
[5132.08s] sevenyear cycles. You can see here we
[5134.56s] are at the top of the cycle and should
[5136.32s] be headed down for another three
[5138.159s] consecutive years for the US dollar.
[5140.639s] Defensive sectors influence at 35year
[5143.84s] low. Some of S&amp;P 500 defensive sector
[5147.04s] weights, consumer staples, energy,
[5149.84s] healthcare, and utilities. Make of this
[5152.48s] what you will, but we argue that a
[5153.92s] thematic rotation is a better route to
[5155.679s] defensive allocations. I would say this
[5158.159s] is pointing back to 2000
[5161.12s] levels, 2001, which we&#39;ve covered a lot,
[5163.92s] which implies you want to start to get
[5165.52s] exposure to staples. We touched on it
[5167.04s] with Brad. Some of these defensive
[5169.04s] stocks like the Hormelas, like the
[5170.719s] Baxters, uh, in in healthcare, etc.,
[5174.08s] like the Crown Castles, they are going
[5176.08s] to start to do well. that probably
[5177.36s] begins uh right now in the third quarter
[5180.0s] after earnings. Once you make new highs
[5181.679s] in the market and volatility starts in
[5184.0s] August, these defenses are going to
[5185.44s] start to spike up. Returns are highest
[5187.92s] when multiples are lowest, but otherwise
[5189.76s] matter little
[5192.88s] and that&#39;s where we are with our basket
[5194.8s] of stocks with low valuations and uh
[5197.84s] turning around massively. Rate cut
[5200.56s] expectations are now off the charts. I
[5204.159s] think it was 85% for September. for now
[5206.48s] and even 25% for July which is new.
[5209.52s] Lowest positioning in net non-commercial
[5212.239s] futures lowest positioning in 12 months
[5215.199s] to equities. So again that&#39;s not what
[5217.36s] you see at tops. I think we&#39;re going to
[5218.719s] push higher and just force maximum pain
[5220.88s] from all the l all the people who sold
[5223.52s] in the hole in April. Uh market implied
[5226.32s] US recession probability indicator is
[5229.04s] average. Uh foreign treasuries holdings
[5232.239s] may re remain near record. Everyone said
[5234.719s] they were going to sell all our
[5235.76s] treasuries. It&#39;s actually at a record
[5237.679s] high. 25 25 2025 total returns. US
[5241.84s] stocks 2.1%, international stocks 15.9.
[5246.0s] That&#39;s probably uh couple points now. I
[5248.8s] think US is up 4% and international is
[5251.44s] like 15. But we came into that with that
[5254.0s] minority view. Everyone said, you know,
[5255.92s] oh whatever. Gave me a lot of for
[5258.719s] it. Well, it&#39;s worked. Uh Charlie
[5261.84s] Bleello, US office to residential
[5263.92s] conversions are about to explode from a
[5265.92s] trickle today to a flood in 2027. Empty
[5268.719s] office towers to apartments, condos,
[5270.8s] hotels, future commercial real estate is
[5272.56s] going to look very different. Um
[5280.08s] you know, I pounded the hell out of the
[5281.679s] table two years ago for those of you who
[5283.92s] are real estate investors to buy office
[5285.52s] in San Francisco. And those guys have
[5287.92s] made an absolute killing like like
[5291.04s] insane money. I wish that was my game.
[5293.36s] Well, I don&#39;t wish that&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t
[5294.88s] have made as much money doing that, but
[5296.56s] you&#39;d if by real estate terms, you would
[5299.12s] have made a massive absolutely amount of
[5303.44s] money.
[5305.28s] So, um, so now I think if they&#39;re all
[5308.719s] converting to apartments, the the way to
[5310.96s] play it is buy BNC office and sit on
[5314.159s] your hands because eventually all the
[5316.08s] office is going to get spped up.
[5317.84s] Converted to a glut of apartments, those
[5320.48s] guys are going to lose and the ones that
[5322.0s] are left holding actual office are going
[5323.6s] to make a fortune. Onethird of baby
[5325.84s] boomers say they&#39;ll never sell.
[5328.719s] Good luck with that. The word never is
[5330.719s] usually right before they do. biggest
[5332.4s] inflow into energy. Once that once the
[5334.48s] supply hits the markets and price start
[5336.159s] getting bid and and hit the air pocket
[5338.32s] and they start to get fear of loss that
[5340.159s] all of their millions of equity that
[5341.52s] they work their whole life for are
[5343.44s] evaporating, they&#39;re all going to hit
[5344.639s] the market at once. Biggest inflow to
[5346.719s] energy funds since October 23. Short
[5349.44s] interest has risen in 2025 year to date.
[5353.679s] Uh so that that&#39;s more fuel. Shorts are
[5357.28s] the first buyers as we push to new
[5358.719s] highs. They&#39;re all going to be forced
[5359.92s] in. All the people waiting for the
[5361.84s] retest we&#39;ve talked about over the last
[5363.6s] week got absolutely monkey hammered. US
[5366.8s] household assets and liabilities total
[5368.8s] assets 179 trillion total liabilities
[5372.239s] 19. Everyone&#39;s balance sheet is good.
[5374.8s] Corporations people the only balance
[5376.56s] sheets that&#39;s bad is the US government.
[5379.28s] Equity ownership across wealth
[5381.12s] distribution
[5383.28s] 43% in the top 100 36% in the top sorry
[5387.679s] in the top 1% 36% in the so 10% own 79%
[5393.36s] of equities next 40% own 19% and the
[5397.36s] bottom 50% own 1% economists raise China
[5400.56s] growth exports outlook for 2025
[5404.96s] um
[5407.679s] what is this. Oh, K Schiller. Oh, home
[5412.239s] prices month.
[5418.88s] Yeah, a lot of markets starting to get
[5420.32s] hit, particularly Florida and Texas.
[5422.239s] That&#39;s usually where it starts. Market
[5424.32s] concentration is a global phenomenon.
[5426.48s] Top constituents by part market share.
[5429.199s] UK equities heavily weighted towards the
[5431.199s] top 10 stocks as well.
[5435.199s] Uh
[5437.12s] once a diverse index S&amp;P 500 is now
[5439.52s] around 50% growth weight of value growth
[5442.08s] plus fang mag 7 blend.
[5445.44s] Yeah, that&#39;s what you always see before
[5447.52s] reversals. It was the same thing in
[5449.12s] 1999. Dividend changes
[5454.88s] 5%. We&#39;ll skip that one. The high if
[5458.239s] higher in May and June, the rest of the
[5459.76s] year does very well. So when we&#39;ve seen
[5462.0s] conditions like this on average 12
[5464.239s] months out up 14.8%.
[5468.239s] Uh USM2 money supply is now up
[5475.28s] 4
[5477.76s] 5%
[5480.08s] year on year.
[5482.88s] Slightly below the historical average
[5485.679s] growth rate but that&#39;s because we had
[5487.28s] such a big boom in 2000. But uh we&#39;ve
[5490.719s] talked about global M2 money supply
[5492.96s] which is now well at record highs. This
[5496.159s] is a critical chart here
[5499.12s] uh showing emerging markets just now
[5501.92s] breaking out of this long cup and handle
[5504.32s] which implies a measured move of at
[5507.04s] least uh 12 points. So 59 for starters.
[5511.679s] And then at that point, you&#39;re breaking
[5513.04s] out to new all-time highs and you get a
[5514.8s] bigger cup and you&#39;re looking more like
[5517.679s] uh move from 32 to 60 28 plus 60 you&#39;re
[5523.6s] looking at a move to 88. We&#39;re at 47.
[5527.04s] So a basic double uh if you have a
[5529.52s] little patience with emerging markets
[5531.199s] over the next couple few years. Summer
[5533.6s] rally could should continue. We agree.
[5536.719s] Major cities with declining home price
[5539.199s] growth 35%.
[5541.28s] It&#39;s happening. We told you. And it&#39;s
[5543.6s] it&#39;s going to continue. Uh it&#39;s going to
[5545.679s] be just the exact opposite. Once they
[5547.76s] cut rates, prices are actually going to
[5549.44s] come down. Uh just a supply dump all at
[5552.8s] once. Magnificent 7 or Magnificent me.
[5556.0s] Uh you can see even now with all this
[5558.719s] huge rally year to date, you still have
[5561.04s] these majors that are down materially
[5564.56s] like Google, Amazon, Tesla, Apple. Uh
[5568.239s] Magnificent 7 is still flat. Maybe this
[5570.88s] week it it just went barely positive 1%
[5573.84s] 2% but um that&#39;s it back to the top of
[5577.44s] the range at probably another couple
[5579.36s] weeks of push through suck everyone in
[5581.199s] and then they&#39;ll they&#39;ll be weak again
[5582.719s] in the fall. US new single family homes
[5585.84s] month supply.
[5588.08s] So supply is going up. Uh all we need is
[5591.84s] rates coming down and the game is on.
[5593.92s] Institutional clients net buying of
[5595.6s] tech. So they&#39;re all chasing up now. uh
[5598.48s] they&#39;ll get monkey hammered in the fall.
[5600.639s] US stock valuations at a 75-y year high
[5603.52s] to the relative to the rest of the
[5604.96s] world. You want to have international
[5606.719s] exposure and you want to have it
[5608.239s] quickly. We haven&#39;t seen anything like
[5609.52s] that since when? Since 20201, which
[5612.32s] we&#39;ve covered what what outperformed
[5614.0s] next international small caps and value.
[5617.52s] What&#39;s not in this excess right here is
[5620.56s] value plays. That&#39;s when Buffett got
[5622.719s] rich in 2000 when they put him on the
[5624.639s] cover and said as Buffett lost his
[5626.32s] touch, he was buying Proctor and Gamble.
[5628.56s] Everyone else was buying Amazon. Amazon
[5630.56s] was down 90% the next two years. All of
[5633.04s] his stocks were up. Active strategies
[5635.6s] gaining over during select major draw
[5638.4s] down. US accounts for a quarter of
[5640.48s] global GDP but 2/3 of the MCI world
[5644.08s] index. That&#39;s a type of divergence that
[5645.76s] you can get rich on. think you know
[5647.84s] pause this listen again look at the
[5650.08s] table and figure it out. Next chart,
[5653.679s] monetary aggregates M1 leads 12 months.
[5657.28s] China and uh nominal GDP. You can see
[5660.32s] Chinese money supply has been going
[5662.239s] straight up in the last 6 months. GDP
[5665.12s] will follow a big year for apartment
[5667.52s] buildings in big buildings. US multif
[5670.32s] family units completed by units per
[5672.239s] building. So offices are converting into
[5675.04s] apartments. Uh multif family units,
[5678.4s] rearview mirror, everyone looks in the
[5680.0s] rearview mirror. There&#39;s going to be a
[5681.12s] glut of apartments. Uh, that&#39;s not where
[5683.76s] you want to be. You want to be probably
[5685.92s] an office that no one wants in my
[5687.76s] opinion. World gas demand rises to a
[5690.08s] record. Uh, God love you. Comtock
[5693.199s] resources and range resources.
[5696.4s] Uh,
[5698.08s] there we go. Cumulative utility scale
[5700.56s] better. So, that&#39;s going to continue
[5702.0s] with the whole AI stuff. US continuing
[5704.56s] claims going way up. Apparently,
[5706.48s] Powell&#39;s not looking at this data. He&#39;s
[5708.8s] too busy predicting other data with his
[5710.88s] crystal ball that&#39;s worked so well.
[5713.12s] Autopilot and transitory box office
[5717.28s] growth year to date through June 26th.
[5720.639s] Uh it&#39;s actually cooking. And you know
[5723.199s] who&#39;s benefiting from that more than
[5724.8s] anyone else? Disney, baby. How do you
[5727.04s] like them apples? The media distributor
[5729.679s] gauge you Walt Disney Company is kicking
[5732.639s] ass 11.4% 4% in May over YouTube over
[5737.44s] NBC Universal over Paramount over
[5739.92s] Netflix. Uh Neielson&#39;s aggregated view
[5743.28s] of total usage by media company. Disney
[5746.48s] baby number one. How do you like them
[5748.4s] apples? Zero credit attributed to the
[5750.96s] stock. It&#39;s just getting started. China
[5754.239s] building a mega-sized consumer economy.
[5756.719s] Premiere says they&#39;re doing more
[5759.04s] consumer stimulus. We&#39;ll talk about
[5760.88s] that.
[5762.0s] uh six agencies announced financial
[5764.48s] support to boost and expand consumption
[5767.84s] in China. This was published this
[5769.92s] morning from Brendan Ahern uh over at uh
[5773.76s] Kb
[5775.36s] ETF.
[5778.0s] uh quote 19 measures to quote combine
[5780.719s] the implementation of the strategy of
[5782.32s] expanding domestic demand with deepening
[5784.639s] the structural reform of the financial
[5786.56s] supply side, increase the investment in
[5788.4s] financial resources provided by
[5790.48s] consumption and improve the level of
[5792.4s] financial services for consumer demand.
[5795.36s] Is China going through a consumption res
[5797.679s] revival? Its 618 festival is one sign of
[5801.6s] it. The annual shopping festival&#39;s gross
[5803.679s] merchandise value surged by 15.2% 2%
[5807.36s] from last year to an estimated 855.6 6
[5810.88s] billion yuan 100 billion19 billion US
[5814.159s] dollars according to retail data
[5816.08s] provider Cinton shoppers spent on
[5818.32s] consumer electronics as well as beauty
[5819.92s] and pet care products with certain
[5821.84s] consumer products receiving a boost in
[5823.76s] sales from Beijing&#39;s trade-in subsidy
[5825.84s] program stimulus ladies and gentlemen
[5828.0s] while the festival started with a bang
[5830.56s] okay 618 shopping festival with
[5833.84s] sustained brand growth Tao and T- mall
[5839.36s] City bank. After that, Alibaba stock
[5841.92s] could surge another 50% after
[5844.239s] Blockbuster 618 festival. Investors are
[5848.0s] most positive on emerging market in two
[5849.92s] years. HSBC survey says opinion follows
[5852.88s] trend. China tech firms ramp up M&amp;A
[5855.52s] deals with the blessing of Beijing. The
[5857.52s] game is back on, ladies and gentlemen.
[5859.36s] European car sales rise as demand for
[5861.84s] plug-in hybrids soarses. Where does
[5864.0s] Cooper Standard make the most money off
[5865.92s] of hybrids? Hybrid cars once derided and
[5868.96s] pop and dismissed have become popular.
[5871.76s] More parts per car for Cooper standard.
[5874.239s] US new re vehicle sales set to rise 2.5%
[5877.52s] in June. Report says highlights from
[5880.8s] report. North American light vehicle
[5882.4s] production outlook has increased by
[5884.4s] 434,000 units for 2025.
[5888.639s] Do the math, ladies and gentlemen.
[5890.239s] That&#39;s uh if Cooper does about half of
[5893.76s] that, that&#39;s 200,000 units by $150 a
[5897.199s] car. Uh that goes straight to the bottom
[5899.84s] line effectively. 2025 forecast was also
[5902.8s] raised by 248,000 units for light
[5905.119s] vehicle sales.
[5907.119s] Uh that&#39;s from S&amp;P. Second Fed official
[5910.08s] indicates support for faster rate cuts.
[5912.48s] Uh this was Bowman, Waller, Goulsby.
[5916.56s] They&#39;re all going against Powell.
[5918.32s] Federal Reserve releases plan to relax
[5920.239s] key bank capital rule. I covered this
[5922.239s] with uh Brad
[5924.88s] Smith and I&#39;ve been telling you guys it
[5926.639s] was coming for the last few months. The
[5929.28s] supplemental leverage ratio, they&#39;re
[5931.84s] going to reduce capital requirements to
[5933.44s] bank. Huge demand for treasuries going
[5935.04s] to bring down 10-year yield 30 to 70
[5936.88s] bips. 30-year fixed mortgage will be
[5939.04s] below six before the end of the year.
[5940.88s] Real estate boom will be on. Stanley
[5943.04s] Black &amp; Decker, GenerRack,
[5945.52s] QXO all going to be beneficiary. US
[5948.4s] treasuries face stable coin driven
[5950.56s] demand surge as supply looms. Fiserve to
[5953.6s] offer own stable coin partners with
[5956.08s] PayPal and circle. White House says
[5958.639s] decision on nominating next Fed chair
[5961.119s] not imminent. We covered that with Brad.
[5963.36s] You can take our view on that. Intense
[5966.239s] heat to push biggest US grids power used
[5969.44s] to 12-year high. Natural gas com stock
[5972.4s] new renewables get reality check as gas
[5974.4s] demand returns to growth. Insatiable
[5976.8s] search for compute power could drive
[5978.639s] another commodity boom
[5981.52s] same as 20 2001 to 2007. Summer gas
[5984.96s] prices haven&#39;t been this low since 2021.
[5987.76s] Existing home price sales rose in May.
[5990.08s] Economists expected a drop. Uh China
[5993.92s] going through consumption. There we go.
[5996.4s] QXO won&#39;t raise its offer for GMS after
[5999.36s] report of Home Depot bid. GXO two huge
[6002.8s] announcements
[6004.719s] announces the completion of the
[6006.08s] regulatory review of Winkitin
[6008.32s] acquisition and raises full year 2025
[6011.199s] guidance. So they got that approved. Um
[6015.04s] so now they can start to integrate.
[6016.48s] That&#39;s going to be huge for GXO. They
[6018.159s] also got an incredible new CEO from DHL,
[6020.8s] which is the number one uh logistics
[6023.44s] company in the world uh right ahead of
[6025.44s] GXO. So, they got their best person uh
[6028.08s] off to the races. Goldman and City see
[6030.08s] Europe&#39;s economy powering stock higher
[6032.639s] rally and time for a makeover Estee
[6035.679s] Lauder um
[6038.88s] update. So, each week we try to cover
[6041.44s] one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in
[6043.199s] previous podcast videocast. As you can
[6045.6s] see here, cash flow is starting to
[6047.52s] recover, but it&#39;s still iffy. Margins
[6049.36s] are starting to recover. That&#39;s actually
[6051.119s] real. A lot of good things beginning to
[6054.0s] happen. Key thing here, which Jeff
[6056.719s] wasn&#39;t able to circle, is you can see
[6059.28s] that over the past decade, the return on
[6061.119s] invested capital has been in the high
[6062.8s] teens to low 20s consistently until uh
[6067.04s] 2023. And this is coincident with the
[6070.48s] drop off in sales in China from 2021 to
[6073.36s] 2024. those are starting to recover. I
[6077.28s] think we&#39;re going to see a quicker
[6078.48s] recovery because it&#39;s not baked into the
[6080.719s] outlook uh the China recovery. The
[6082.96s] beauty is during the draw down is that
[6086.08s] they did not lose much share in China.
[6088.8s] They kept about 99% of the share that
[6090.8s] they had. They have number one uh share
[6093.6s] globally for premium skincare and
[6096.159s] cosmetics. That&#39;s not going to change.
[6098.48s] And for those of you who don&#39;t know,
[6099.76s] they cover a lot of brands. It&#39;s not
[6101.52s] just Estee Lauder. It&#39;s MAC. It&#39;s
[6103.92s] Clinique. It&#39;s Dr. Jart for the young
[6106.0s] kids love the Korean stuff. Um,
[6109.52s] it&#39;s Aveda. It&#39;s uh, it&#39;s more than you
[6112.32s] know. And they&#39;ve been buying and
[6113.52s] selling brands for 75 plus years, and
[6116.239s] they&#39;ll continue to do that. Similar to
[6117.76s] VF Corp, similar to Dagio. Last month,
[6120.56s] we put out a quick update following
[6121.92s] Estee Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings, but had not
[6123.92s] yet published a full deep dive. After
[6126.08s] falling below $50 a share at the April
[6128.32s] lows, the stock has been on a tear,
[6129.92s] rallying more than 50% off the bottom.
[6132.239s] Just this week, Deutsche Bank turned
[6133.679s] bullish on the turnaround story and
[6134.96s] issued a street high price of $95. We
[6137.28s] thought now would be a good time to
[6138.48s] revisit the name. Estee Lauder founded
[6140.639s] in 1946,
[6143.119s] is the global leader in premium beauty
[6145.04s] products with a portfolio of over 20
[6147.119s] best-in-class iconic brands. Estee
[6149.199s] Lauder is basically to make up what and
[6151.28s] beauty what Diagio is to alcohol. Both
[6153.199s] are about as premium as it gets. The
[6155.199s] stock was never a huge position for us
[6156.8s] like Alibaba. It is largely a bet on the
[6158.88s] recovery of the Chinese middle class.
[6160.32s] And just like poker, we prefer positions
[6163.119s] with plenty of outs and few offer more
[6165.199s] outs than Baba. So while Estee Lauder
[6167.36s] may not be the everything business that
[6168.96s] Alibaba is, it still offers what we
[6171.04s] believe is a highly attractive
[6172.32s] riskreward setup. SA Lauder&#39;s roller
[6174.639s] coaster story over the past few years
[6176.239s] goes like this. When their prior CEO
[6178.32s] Fabriio Freda took the helm in 2009, his
[6180.8s] top priority was international
[6182.08s] expansion, aiming to generate over 60%
[6184.239s] of overall sales from international
[6186.32s] markets. That bet proved highly
[6187.76s] successful over the next decade, but
[6189.6s] also opened the door to significant
[6191.199s] overexposure to certain markets,
[6192.8s] especially China and travel retail.
[6199.04s] From fiscal year 2018 to 2021,
[6202.88s] China&#39;s share of total revenue jumped
[6204.56s] from just 13% to 36%. At one point, a
[6209.28s] single customer in China was responsible
[6210.88s] for 42% of the region sales. Management
[6213.679s] clearly bit off uh more than they could
[6215.44s] chew. And when the music stopped in
[6217.28s] 2022, Estee Lauder paid the price.
[6219.76s] Shares fell from nearly $375 to below
[6222.639s] $50 this past April, effectively wiping
[6225.28s] out more than a decade of gains. Now,
[6227.119s] this is exactly the kind of situation
[6228.719s] that earned me the nickname Turnaround
[6230.4s] Tom. As Buffett says, great investment
[6232.8s] opportunities come around when excellent
[6234.639s] companies are surrounded by unusual
[6236.32s] circumstances that cause the stock to be
[6238.48s] misappraised. That is the guiding light
[6241.44s] of our entire company at Great Hill
[6244.48s] Capital. That is the theme of everything
[6246.32s] we do is great investment opportunities
[6248.88s] come around when excellent companies are
[6250.48s] surrounded by unusual circumstances that
[6252.4s] cause the stock to be misappraised. We
[6254.56s] benefit from that misappraisal. This
[6256.719s] could not be a more accurate description
[6258.88s] of Estee Lauder. At the end of the day,
[6260.88s] this is a company that is as high
[6262.239s] quality and durable as they come,
[6264.0s] working its way of a once in a
[6265.36s] hundredyear event, yet priced as if it
[6267.28s] is in permanent decline, and people will
[6268.8s] never spend money on makeup again. Oh,
[6270.8s] and by the way, it&#39;s kind of the reverse
[6272.239s] GLP. As people lose weight, they buy
[6273.84s] more makeup, not less. We are more than
[6276.88s] happy to take the other side of that
[6278.56s] trade, and that&#39;s because we see the
[6280.08s] bulk of it, Estee Lauder&#39;s challenges as
[6282.159s] cyclical, not structural, with all signs
[6284.56s] pointing to a bottoming and nearterm
[6287.04s] recovery. The name of the game with
[6288.88s] Estee Lauder turnaround is margin
[6290.639s] expansion. Gross margins fell nearly 500
[6292.8s] basis points, peaked to trough,
[6294.159s] bottoming in fiscal year 2024 at 71.7%
[6298.56s] as management worked through excess
[6300.159s] inventories and write-offs. The good
[6302.0s] news is the gross margins have now
[6303.44s] posted three consecutive quarters of 300
[6305.6s] basis point gains with current guidance
[6308.719s] calling for 73.5%
[6310.96s] for fiscal year 2025 and an expected
[6313.76s] return to the historical mid70s range by
[6316.08s] fiscal year 2027.
[6318.8s] Operating margins are where the crux of
[6320.88s] the turnaround really is. SA Lauder has
[6323.28s] historically delivered mid to high teen
[6325.44s] EBIT margins but in 2024 these bottomed
[6328.32s] out at just over 10%. Management is
[6330.4s] working to restore EBIT margins to a
[6332.0s] solid double-digit level over the next
[6333.6s] few years. And the with the profit
[6336.159s] recovery growth plan expected to
[6337.84s] generate 800 million to a billion in
[6339.6s] annual growth savings and the full run
[6341.679s] rate benefits anticipated by fiscal year
[6344.4s] 2027. Green shoots across the businesses
[6347.28s] continue to point toward a return to
[6349.6s] growth in 2026, which will allow
[6351.6s] operating leverage to really kick in and
[6353.6s] get SA Ladder back to making more money
[6355.6s] than they know what to do with. At the
[6357.119s] same time, you have a new CEO who is a
[6359.199s] proven winner in the industry, a push
[6360.8s] into higher margin digital channels like
[6363.28s] Amazon and Tik Tok and China working its
[6366.159s] way towards becoming a mega-sized
[6368.0s] consumption economy. We think over the
[6370.8s] next few years this is a double from
[6372.48s] current levels. Until then, we are happy
[6374.08s] to sit on our hands and wait. Now,
[6375.92s] here&#39;s an in-depth breakdown of Estee
[6377.52s] Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings. Uh, as the CEO
[6380.56s] said, quote, &quot;Return to sales growth in
[6382.88s] fiscal 2026.&quot; You should go through this
[6386.08s] line by line. We&#39;ve outlined the gross
[6388.239s] margin expansion expanded 310 basis
[6391.199s] points to 75%
[6393.84s] uh in the quarter. Uh achieved prestige
[6397.84s] beauty share gains for fiscal 2025. By
[6401.28s] the way, 10 years ago, prestige was 33%
[6404.8s] of all uh category purchases. Now it&#39;s
[6407.679s] 40%. This is a huge play on the emerging
[6410.159s] market middle class expansion. Um,
[6413.52s] they&#39;ll be one of the pure
[6414.96s] beneficiaries.
[6418.719s] On trend, commercial invocations, 10 new
[6422.0s] freestanding stores, Tik Tok shop. Okay,
[6425.6s] all this stuff you can look at.
[6429.52s] Let&#39;s just scroll down for now to the 10
[6431.76s] key points.
[6442.639s] can see the improvement in China.
[6449.199s] All right, 10 key points. Number one,
[6450.8s] after sales declined 10% in fiscal year
[6452.8s] 2023 and 2% in 2024 and with guidance
[6455.119s] calling for another 8 to 9% in fiscal
[6457.44s] 2025, management remains confident in a
[6459.76s] return to growth by fiscal year 2026.
[6462.08s] Gross margins bottomed in fiscal year
[6463.84s] 2024 at 71.7 below the 5-year average of
[6466.96s] approximately 74, but have rebounded for
[6469.44s] three consecutive quarters with gains of
[6470.96s] over 300 basis points. Fiscal year 2025
[6473.76s] guidance calls for 73.5% and management
[6476.239s] continues to target a return to the
[6478.4s] historical mid70s by fiscal year 2027.
[6481.04s] Three, management also remains confident
[6482.8s] in restoring operating margins to solid
[6484.96s] double digits over the next few years as
[6486.639s] a return to sales growth allows
[6488.4s] operating leverage to kick in. Margins
[6490.0s] bottomed in fiscal year 2024 at just
[6491.92s] over 10% well below the company&#39;s
[6493.52s] historical mid to high teens EBIT
[6495.76s] levels. Green shoots are emerging across
[6497.44s] the businesses with market share gains
[6499.119s] showing up in the US, China and Japan.
[6502.159s] In the US Q3 marked the first quarter in
[6504.32s] years with share gains driven by growth
[6506.8s] in three of four categories skincare,
[6509.52s] makeup and hair and 10 brands that held
[6511.679s] or gained shared led by Clinique which
[6514.4s] has now posted 11 consecutive quarters
[6516.96s] of gains in China. Estee Lauder gained
[6519.28s] share across all four brand categories
[6521.28s] and eight brands, making it the third
[6522.96s] quarter of share gains in the last four.
[6525.52s] And Japan Q3 marked the fourth straight
[6528.56s] quarter of market share growth.
[6532.56s] Tariffs are not expected to have a
[6535.04s] material impact on fiscal year 2025
[6537.36s] profitability. Estee Lauder has the
[6538.8s] lowest exposure in the industry thanks
[6540.719s] to its nine manufacturing sites
[6542.4s] worldwide. Over 75%
[6545.28s] of what is sold in the US is sourced
[6547.119s] from the US or Canada and is protected
[6548.96s] on the USMCA agreement. 25% of what is
[6551.84s] sold in China is currently sourced from
[6553.44s] the US. But management aims to reduce
[6555.119s] this to less than 10% and has already
[6557.44s] mitigated north of 40% of the initial
[6559.36s] tariff impacts. Travel retail which is
[6561.84s] at its peak accounted for mid to high
[6563.679s] 20% of total sales thanks to shrink in
[6566.8s] in the low teens as a share of sales.
[6569.44s] Management is intentionally diversifying
[6571.44s] away from volatile travel retail
[6573.199s] significantly reducing inventories and
[6574.719s] de-risisking the segment outside of
[6576.4s] travel retail which declined 28% in Q3
[6579.04s] and is expected to see another steep
[6580.88s] drop in Q4. Estee Lauder delivered
[6583.28s] sequential acceleration in global retail
[6585.679s] sales growth. Seven management remains
[6587.84s] on track with the expanded profit
[6589.6s] recovery growth plan PRGP which is
[6592.639s] expected to generate 800 million to a
[6594.639s] billion in annual growth savings with
[6596.639s] full run rate benefits anticipated by
[6598.4s] 2027. As of Q3, management has approved
[6600.8s] initiatives to eliminate over 2600 net
[6603.36s] positions with 85% expected to be
[6606.159s] completed by the end of 2025 and has
[6608.0s] already reduced middle management roles
[6609.6s] by 20% year-over-year. Aid Estee Ladder
[6612.8s] continues to lean into higher growth,
[6614.159s] higher margin digital channels with
[6616.0s] online organic sales up mid single
[6618.239s] digits in Q3. This includes 12 brands
[6620.48s] now available through Amazon prem
[6622.08s] premium beauty stores as well as
[6623.92s] momentum on Tik Tok shop helping digital
[6626.639s] channels reach 28% of total sales in
[6630.0s] 2024.
[6631.92s] That&#39;s up from just 13% in 2018. At the
[6635.679s] same time, exposure to department stores
[6637.44s] has been significantly reduced as a
[6638.96s] share of overall sales. Nine capital
[6641.119s] expenditures totaled 395 million, 3.62%
[6643.6s] 62% of sales in the 9 months ended Q3
[6646.4s] down 44% from 72 million in the prior
[6650.159s] year period. Construction of the new
[6651.6s] factory in Japan had pushed capex as a
[6653.6s] percentage of sales to around 6% in
[6655.28s] recent years above the historical
[6656.48s] average of 4 to 5%. But spending is now
[6658.719s] expected to remain lower as management
[6660.159s] shifts focus to higher return on
[6661.76s] invested capital projects and allocate
[6665.119s] capex towards consumerf facing
[6667.199s] initiatives rather than capacity and
[6669.04s] capabilities. 10. In the first few weeks
[6671.52s] of Q4, management has continued to see
[6673.679s] strong retail momentum in the US, even
[6676.56s] stronger trends in China and positive
[6678.88s] momentum in UK across other emerging
[6682.48s] mark and across other emerging markets.
[6685.52s] Uh here&#39;s the earnings call transcript.
[6687.679s] You can go through the green highlights
[6689.04s] we put here at hedge funips.com. Just
[6692.0s] scroll down to popular post. It&#39;ll
[6693.679s] probably be the number one or two most
[6696.159s] popular post for the next 24 hours. Uh
[6699.84s] you can see the questions from analysts,
[6701.36s] the responses. This gives you the nuance
[6703.199s] and the granularity you need to have an
[6705.199s] edge uh if you&#39;re going to do this
[6708.239s] seriously.
[6710.4s] Moving along,
[6713.199s] there&#39;s a lot there.
[6716.08s] I don&#39;t have my normal mouse this week,
[6718.08s] so bear with me.
[6721.599s] That&#39;s a little better.
[6725.44s] Here&#39;s
[6730.32s] an article from Morning Star. Estee
[6732.08s] Lauder is rise to ride poised to ride
[6734.88s] the beauty premiumization tailwinds.
[6738.0s] Very similar story to Diagio leader in
[6740.56s] uh products scale cost advantage blah
[6742.8s] blah blah 20 years middle class
[6744.56s] consumers global upgrade from mass brand
[6746.56s] shorter lead time digital platforms. Uh
[6749.52s] bottom line is they talk about ample
[6751.679s] liquidity and they talk about a price
[6754.239s] target of $125
[6756.48s] fair value currently trading at 75 up
[6759.92s] from 50. So um we like that story or
[6765.44s] that take.
[6769.76s] Uh fear and greed still not yet at uh
[6772.08s] euphoric levels. National Association of
[6774.56s] Active Investment Managers getting up

[6792.08s] the second half in our view. This view
[6793.76s] is based on what has already taken place
[6795.119s] in 2025 as well as much of the data
[6797.599s] we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on the
[6799.04s] podcast video cast coupled with our
[6800.96s] proprietary methods of expressing and

[6872.56s] So, we&#39;re past that period a year where
[6874.4s] they take down guidance. Now, they&#39;re
[6875.84s] starting to take it back up. Um,
[6880.639s] economic data, again, same stuff we&#39;ve
[6883.119s] covered about employment, about uh,
[6886.159s] housing, etc. And now on to the ask me
[6889.52s] anything questions. We have quite a few
[6891.119s] this week. If you like the ask me
[6893.199s] anything, stick around. If not, we&#39;ll
[6894.96s] see you next week. Same time, back in
[6897.36s] California, though. Uh, and here&#39;s
[6899.92s] question number one from Mike S.
[6902.159s] Thoughts on Clorox. Mike, we covered
[6903.84s] that a couple weeks ago. It&#39;s fine. Not
[6906.08s] the highest and best use for us, but uh,
[6908.32s] decent company at a good price. Not
[6910.48s] thrilled about the CEO. Maybe they&#39;ll
[6912.159s] change her out. Theo Dumont, many thanks
[6914.88s] for all the lessons. Best of you and
[6916.0s] your family. Why did Etsy do a convert?
[6918.719s] They wanted to be as non-dilutive as
[6920.32s] they could and not pay high interest.
[6922.719s] So, uh, I kind of like that play. Uh,
[6925.199s] that&#39;s a new client inquiry. Tom Jones,
[6928.88s] uh, love the podcast. Keep up the great
[6930.48s] work. What are your thoughts on Shu
[6932.08s] Steve Madden? Let&#39;s take a look.
[6939.199s] S H O O
[6959.52s] H
[6961.76s] I haven&#39;t heard anyone talk about Steve
[6963.36s] Madden forever.
[6990.4s] I mean, just you just want to you just
[6992.32s] want to understand how they&#39;re going to
[6993.36s] turn around free cash flow here. I mean,
[6995.119s] I&#39;ll take a quick look at the balance
[6996.4s] sheet. Looks okay. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t like
[6998.48s] it. It&#39;s it&#39;s not the type of business
[7000.48s] that I&#39;d be involved in, but I think
[7001.84s] you&#39;re going to be fine with it. And I
[7003.199s] think it&#39;s pretty good uh analysis and
[7005.76s] worth understanding their competitive
[7007.52s] moat. Uh let&#39;s just take a look at their
[7010.08s] balance sheet before we do anything else
[7013.199s] if that&#39;s okay. It&#39;s probably worth
[7015.28s] looking into further. Yeah, I I would
[7018.56s] take a I would take a good look at it.
[7020.239s] It looks generally okay. So, good work
[7022.239s] on that one. Uh, Drew,
[7027.44s] usually ask a question about a company.
[7028.96s] This week, I wanted a chance to say
[7030.159s] thank you. Uh, that&#39;s kind of you. Uh,
[7032.48s] this is from Drew Robinson. I&#39;ve been
[7034.48s] listening to your podcast.
[7037.76s] Start to finish every week since senior
[7039.36s] year of college. Between my young
[7041.04s] investment careers, beginning my young
[7042.96s] investment careers during Zer when
[7044.32s] everyone, including myself, was chasing
[7045.679s] shiny objects. I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d
[7047.119s] be right now if I not found this
[7048.32s] podcast. Thank you for sharing your hard
[7049.599s] work with your loyal listeners. Every
[7051.119s] week I share the pod with everyone I
[7052.639s] know and we&#39;ll continue to do it. Well,
[7054.08s] thank you for that. That is the number
[7055.44s] one way you can say thank you. If you
[7057.44s] can&#39;t afford to be a client, share it
[7059.199s] with uh one or two people you care about
[7061.04s] that love the markets. Uh he said, &quot;PS,
[7063.599s] let&#39;s just say the golf course this
[7064.8s] weekend isn&#39;t ready for me in my new
[7067.119s] hedge fund tips golf hat picture coming
[7069.119s] soon.&quot; All right. I love it. We&#39;ll get
[7070.4s] you up on the website. By the way, uh
[7073.119s] we&#39;ve got some new pictures up on the
[7075.599s] website of uh people that were kind
[7078.159s] enough. We&#39;ve had like pictures to
[7081.679s] orders I would say uh you know very very
[7086.32s] small amount of pictures but they&#39;re
[7087.679s] starting to trickle in I guess as the
[7089.599s] products come in and people feel
[7091.679s] confident doing it. Even if you want to
[7093.36s] go anonymous you can just you know put
[7096.159s] first name and last initial or whatever.
[7098.159s] Uh let&#39;s see those have been around.
[7100.96s] There&#39;s some guys we covered last week.
[7104.639s] Oh here&#39;s a new one. Uh
[7107.599s] Steven Jatish down at the Wildwood uh
[7110.4s] New Jersey Shore. Patrick, I think we
[7112.239s] covered. So, we got a lot of new ones
[7114.0s] coming in. Excited for that. Uh those of
[7116.8s] you who want the swag, just go to hedge
[7118.56s] fun tips, click on the merch store. Uh
[7121.04s] that&#39;s cool. All right, moving along.
[7124.4s] Thanks for that kind email, by the way.
[7126.239s] We&#39;ll look forward to get your picture
[7127.52s] up on the site. Simon
[7131.28s] Staz
[7133.119s] Staz Stazz
[7135.599s] uh Americ
[7136.88s] [Music]
[7143.04s] was suggested by big short guys as long
[7145.52s] yesterday. Well, I worked for Cornwell,
[7147.36s] so I don&#39;t know that they&#39;re in that. Um
[7150.32s] I think m miners as a general rule of
[7153.119s] thumb other than Albamaro are crap. um
[7157.52s] businesses even when the price of
[7159.36s] whatever they&#39;re mining goes up, they
[7160.639s] find a way to lose money. It&#39;s just a
[7162.239s] terrible business. ARG.TO
[7189.199s] All right.
[7192.88s] All right. Cash flows are recovering,
[7194.48s] revenues are recovering, margins are
[7196.4s] recovering. So, they&#39;re in the circular
[7199.119s] mo secular move here, but I think
[7200.8s] they&#39;re towards the top of the range.
[7202.239s] What do they mine?
[7205.52s] you know, these guys that are always
[7207.52s] bearish all the time and then the market
[7210.0s] makes new highs and they&#39;re forced to
[7211.28s] buy something. They always buy these
[7212.639s] pieces of that wind up doing
[7214.56s] nothing for them. So, what do these guys
[7216.48s] do? Uh, copper and
[7220.08s] copper concentrates in Chile. I mean,
[7222.719s] this is this is like too hard pile
[7225.52s] gamble and win maybe gamble and lose
[7228.159s] likely hard pass for me. Um,
[7233.28s] okay.
[7235.44s] John Wicker, love the pod. Thoughts on
[7238.48s] General Mills? I think this is in the
[7240.08s] group that&#39;s going to start to get bid
[7241.52s] in the fall. Uh, along with the Hormells
[7244.639s] and um
[7249.199s] I just don&#39;t think this has come down
[7251.04s] enough for me to get interested yet. At
[7252.8s] 40, I&#39;d probably be a buyer.
[7255.76s] Um,
[7265.119s] yeah, you just want to see some recovery
[7266.88s] in margins and revenues before you go
[7268.8s] crazy. Unless it gets down to 40, then
[7270.48s] you can kind of pull a J Powell and
[7272.88s] predict the recovery. But, uh, I I like
[7275.44s] it below 45. I don&#39;t like it here and I
[7277.84s] may never get it. So, we&#39;ll just wait on
[7279.92s] that or do nothing. More likely do
[7281.84s] nothing. Uh Jimmy Jones.
[7287.04s] Uh
[7295.76s] yeah, Hormemell is just a defensive spot
[7297.599s] in our portfolio with the margin of
[7299.36s] safety. He&#39;s talking about the interim
[7300.719s] CEO. Yeah, I wish they had their final
[7302.4s] CEO, but he&#39;ll fix things up. The
[7304.56s] business will start to turn. They&#39;ll get
[7305.76s] a hot shot in there. So, it might take a
[7307.28s] little longer, but in the meantime, you
[7308.639s] got a nice dividend and it&#39;s fine. I
[7310.8s] mean, could I see myself selling out of
[7313.52s] Hormeell and buying uh Craft Hines?
[7316.48s] Possibly. They&#39;re both kind of the same
[7318.639s] characteristic, but they&#39;re both going
[7320.0s] to basically do the same thing when that
[7321.679s] group turns. And that and same as
[7323.36s] General Mills. Those just have a a
[7325.36s] bigger upside than General Mills or or
[7327.679s] Campbell for that matter. Campbell&#39;s
[7329.36s] kind of a dog. Um all right, Jason Zen,
[7333.04s] Global Payments. We&#39;ve covered this one,
[7334.8s] Jason, a million times. We just don&#39;t
[7336.239s] like the business. Um,
[7338.639s] so I&#39;ll leave it at that. I think you&#39;re
[7341.199s] going to be okay on this, but uh I just
[7344.239s] forget what was the thing from the work
[7346.0s] I did a while back. I think it had to do
[7348.4s] with the
[7351.199s] opacity of the portfolio of the assets
[7353.44s] that they held or the margin
[7355.599s] compression, but there was something I
[7356.96s] didn&#39;t like about it. I think it works
[7358.4s] as a trade here. Uh, I understand why
[7361.119s] you&#39;re interested in here. Free cash
[7362.639s] flow is going fine. Margins are going
[7364.32s] fine. Starting to recover. I&#39;ve just
[7366.88s] never liked this business from a quality
[7368.719s] standpoint. I&#39;d rather be in PayPal, but
[7371.44s] uh I think it&#39;s going to work for you.
[7374.08s] So, good work on that.
[7377.28s] Uh Chuck.
[7383.119s] Okay.
[7385.679s] Uh here&#39;s Daniel Estz sent uh
[7390.8s] Tele Performance TEP.
[7398.4s] It&#39;s a French company.
[7405.84s] Free cash flow is going through the
[7407.28s] roof. Revenue is going through the roof.
[7409.04s] Margins are starting to recover. Return
[7411.119s] on capital has been spotty.
[7414.159s] uh business has been around for a long
[7416.56s] time if I&#39;m not mistaken.
[7420.88s] Founded in 1910
[7426.88s] uh digital business services company
[7430.0s] operates specialized services segments,
[7434.32s] customer acquisition services, business
[7436.159s] process management, blah blah blah. They
[7438.56s] do a million things. Uh, seems like a
[7441.679s] company that&#39;s been pretty nimble over
[7443.199s] the years in adjusting to environments.
[7446.48s] Um, balance sheet. Let&#39;s take a look.
[7458.8s] Million dollar cash.
[7465.36s] Good
[7467.28s] statement.
[7470.719s] had some big growth. They must have done
[7472.239s] an acquisition
[7476.239s] good.
[7481.92s] Balance sheet
[7485.52s] generally looks okay.
[7498.96s] I mean it&#39;s generating
[7502.159s] a return on capital that&#39;s probably I
[7505.44s] don&#39;t know if we have weighted average
[7506.8s] cost of capital here.
[7510.32s] No.
[7511.599s] probably below its cost of capital.
[7536.48s] Yeah, look, I think this one is
[7538.56s] definitely definitely warrants doing
[7540.88s] some work. I mean, it&#39;s just going to be
[7542.48s] really understanding what is the
[7544.08s] competitive mode on all the businesses
[7545.679s] that they&#39;re doing. Why is the stock
[7547.599s] down so much? Uh, and um uh what&#39;s the
[7551.52s] turnaround story? But it&#39;s cheap. It
[7553.36s] looks like it&#39;s starting to grow again.
[7555.44s] Balance sheet seems okay. Check when
[7557.44s] they have to refinance everything. And I
[7558.96s] think you&#39;re on to something, Daniel. Uh
[7561.28s] moving along
[7579.76s] David Burgerer, Marriott Vacation.
[7583.44s] Uh yeah, I don&#39;t like that business, but
[7588.08s] they they run in cycles and when they
[7590.079s] make money, they mint it.
[7593.44s] Uh
[7599.44s] yeah. Ah,
[7602.88s] I don&#39;t love this business anyway. I
[7605.119s] would just say,
[7610.0s] &quot;Yeah, I think you&#39;re right, but I&#39;m not
[7612.96s] going to participate in this. I just I
[7614.8s] just don&#39;t like the business. It&#39;s too
[7616.159s] cyclical for my taste. It&#39;s just not a
[7619.28s] clear.&quot; In other words, I&#39;m not getting
[7620.96s] enough upside relative to the risk.
[7624.88s] But I do think you&#39;re going to be right.
[7627.599s] Uh I would just watch. The balance sheet
[7631.679s] doesn&#39;t look great. $5 billion of debt,
[7633.679s] $200 million of cash. Not ideal. That
[7636.96s] That&#39;s what I&#39;d be worried about. It&#39;s
[7638.32s] never generated a good return on
[7639.679s] invested capital. So, this is more of a
[7641.44s] trading vehicle than a own forever
[7643.92s] vehicle.
[7645.679s] Uh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t love it, Dave, but I
[7648.079s] think it&#39;s going to work for you. Just
[7649.84s] be careful on the balance sheet side.
[7661.28s] Um, uh, that&#39;s a client inquiry.
[7666.56s] Brendan Garvey, Hallebertton.
[7669.599s] I think I said Hallebertton was fine a
[7671.84s] few weeks ago. If you have to be in it,
[7673.52s] that I&#39;d probably choose that or
[7674.96s] Slumber.
[7676.8s] Um, I don&#39;t like it enough, but I think
[7680.079s] I think it&#39;ll work here. And we covered
[7681.92s] that in more detail back then.
[7685.52s] Another client inquiry, Patrick Kelly.
[7691.84s] Thank you for the continued hard work
[7693.119s] that you put in the weekly podcast. It&#39;s
[7695.04s] always fun to come home Thursday nights
[7697.36s] knowing that I don&#39;t have to flip
[7698.48s] through five streaming services looking
[7699.92s] for something to watch. I would be
[7701.679s] grateful if you could take a look at
[7702.88s] Robert Half. Company&#39;s got really beat
[7704.719s] up. Long history navigating challenging
[7706.48s] environments.
[7708.079s] Uh retired 23% of stocks. Clean balance
[7711.679s] sheet.
[7713.36s] Uh okay. Robert Half. I think this is a
[7715.76s] staffing business.
[7717.84s] All
[7719.36s] right. I
[7736.88s] All right. So,
[7739.28s] their revenues and cash flow are not
[7741.04s] turning yet.
[7744.079s] Uh, what does their balance sheet look
[7746.239s] like?
[7752.56s] So, in these, you just got to go do the
[7754.239s] work and find out what&#39;s the plan to
[7755.84s] turn it around, and then you wait to see
[7757.76s] some signs of the plan working. Uh, but
[7761.28s] yeah, this this is a kind of adorable
[7763.36s] business. It probably bounces back, you
[7766.159s] know, $70, $75 range. It&#39;s 40. It&#39;s not
[7770.48s] a high, it&#39;s not a great use of capital
[7772.4s] for us. Uh, and you definitely need to
[7775.599s] start to see some recovery and
[7778.239s] understanding of the turnaround plan.
[7780.88s] But let&#39;s just see if you got waiting
[7782.56s] time to do it.
[7786.239s] Yeah, very
[7789.599s] very dimminimous debt. So, I think
[7792.159s] you&#39;re probably okay here. Uh, I don&#39;t
[7794.4s] love it and you should probably listen
[7795.92s] into, you know, four to eight of the
[7797.599s] last calls, find out what they&#39;re doing
[7799.119s] to turn the thing around. Uh
[7806.4s] Rob Sarnataro,
[7808.44s] [Music]
[7811.04s] great show, informative yet very
[7812.719s] entertaining. My question is, what
[7814.32s] factors do you consider if a stock hits
[7816.079s] your expected target price while still
[7817.52s] in the short-term tax window? Sell and
[7819.119s] face the tax consequences or hold and
[7821.44s] risk uh downturn. Uh you know, usually
[7824.8s] we&#39;re not getting into a stock unless
[7826.32s] it&#39;s a double or triple plus. Uh, and
[7828.88s] those usually take more than 12 months,
[7830.56s] but on occasion, you&#39;ve seen it here,
[7832.32s] whether it was Vernado or others,
[7833.92s] Rolls-Royce, where they they go double
[7837.119s] or triple quicker than we anticipated.
[7838.88s] It&#39;s inside the 12-month window, and if
[7840.48s] it exceeds our target, we take the
[7841.92s] profits and eat the ordinary uh capital
[7844.48s] gains because uh, you know, we we buy
[7848.239s] things with a margin of safety and we
[7849.599s] sell them when they&#39;re at excess price
[7851.199s] and we just stick to our discipline. But
[7853.04s] the good news is our average holding
[7854.88s] period is three years. So, that&#39;s that&#39;s
[7856.4s] rarely a factor. Some take happen
[7858.8s] faster, some some uh take a little
[7861.28s] longer, but on average around three
[7862.96s] years. Uh, hey Tom, what are your
[7865.119s] thoughts on Craft Hind? Uh, yeah, we
[7867.199s] like it. We covered that last week or
[7868.96s] the week before.
[7870.88s] Uh, Leaf Foster,
[7874.719s] uh, BME in the UK, did you do any more
[7877.679s] work? No, I said it was worth you doing
[7879.599s] more work. I&#39;m not interested in it, but
[7881.84s] uh uh I thought it was worth you
[7886.4s] starting to do research if you like it.
[7888.48s] In other words, it passed the sniff
[7891.84s] test. Let me just double check this one.
[7905.199s] Yeah, I think I specifically said I
[7907.28s] don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s uh
[7908.719s] supermarket and that&#39;s a terrible
[7910.239s] business, but let me just double check.
[7913.28s] Uh
[7918.56s] yeah, I would never get into the grocery
[7920.0s] store business. I do think this one&#39;s
[7921.76s] going to be okay. Let me just double
[7923.04s] check the balance sheet and I think it&#39;s
[7925.119s] going to probably work for you. But I
[7926.48s] would I like that in airlines, you&#39;d
[7929.84s] really have to put a gun to my head and
[7931.44s] be like the last of five things I&#39;m
[7932.96s] allowed to buy for me to consider no
[7934.719s] matter how how good the numbers are.
[7936.719s] Like you could send me a million Chinese
[7938.159s] stocks if they&#39;re not named Alibaba or
[7939.84s] 10-centent. Like I&#39;m just not buying
[7941.44s] them. Um
[7944.56s] because the odds are against you in
[7946.32s] certain industries and certain
[7947.599s] countries. So you really have to have
[7949.28s] such a spectacular deal that you can
[7952.32s] make money if everything goes wrong. uh
[7954.88s] because in those areas it often does. So
[7958.4s] here I think the issue that you&#39;re going
[7960.0s] to have to deal with balance sheets a
[7962.48s] little leverage but it&#39;s not crazy.
[7965.36s] Um
[7971.199s] yeah let&#39;s see the margins
[7980.56s] margins are improving. I again I think
[7983.04s] you&#39;re okay if you understand the
[7984.48s] business. If you live in the UK and do
[7986.4s] that work, I think you&#39;re probably worth
[7988.079s] exploring it. That that just tends to be
[7989.76s] a garbage business. It reminds me of
[7991.44s] Tesco at Buffett got bagged in. Uh hi
[7994.4s] Tom, longtime listener. Thanks for all
[7995.92s] you do while I&#39;m kind of undervalued
[7998.159s] relative large cap. You think increasing
[8000.96s] influence abundance of private equity
[8002.48s] has structurally reshaped the p negative
[8004.96s] way. Best take in private. No, that&#39;s a
[8008.079s] load of It small caps are going to
[8010.159s] fly. Um, stop overthinking it. On to
[8013.679s] next. Marco Stalari.
[8017.679s] Uh, first question ever. Uh,
[8021.679s] about gold and the euro
[8024.96s] hunting. Hi,
[8026.88s] military ship builder nuclear carriers.
[8031.119s] Ah, hi. All right, let&#39;s take a look at
[8034.079s] that. Marco,
[8039.44s] I think you might be speaking my love
[8041.04s] language, my man. I think it&#39;s late,
[8042.8s] though. This thing&#39;s already up
[8046.079s] 60% off its lows. Uh, as a general view,
[8058.8s] no, I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s just turned
[8061.44s] negative free cash flow. stocks up,
[8064.88s] anticipating a turnaround that hasn&#39;t
[8066.639s] happened yet. Uh, this is the kind of
[8068.48s] stock I&#39;d love to see go back down to
[8070.159s] 160 or 150 and then just buy every share
[8072.719s] once I see a little turn turn in free
[8074.56s] cash flow, but there&#39;s no upside here.
[8076.96s] The fundamentals have gotten worse and
[8078.88s] the price has gone up. Not not
[8081.199s] interested yet, but I generally like the
[8083.28s] business, Marco, and congratulations on
[8085.28s] your first question. Thank you for your
[8086.8s] support, Liam Cook. Uh, thanks for all
[8089.599s] you do for the podcast.
[8092.719s] uh listener for six months. Wish I&#39;d
[8094.32s] have started listening earlier.
[8095.44s] Currently holding one small cap. Cooper
[8097.36s] Standard. Uh would you want more
[8099.28s] exposure in a portfolio? 12 stocks.
[8101.119s] Yeah, we have more. I mean uh Cooper
[8104.239s] Standard is a small cap. We have a
[8106.639s] little Canadian goose. We have um
[8110.48s] Comtock has been a big big run uh mover
[8113.599s] for us. Three or 4x already. That was a
[8117.28s] small cap. I don&#39;t know if it still is.
[8118.56s] I guess it still is. Uh that&#39;s more than
[8120.719s] enough small cap exposure. Um
[8125.52s] BF Corp is like a small to mid.
[8129.84s] Uh
[8134.079s] okay.
[8138.239s] Brandon, that&#39;s a new client. Want to
[8141.28s] become a new client. Uh Barrett, new
[8144.639s] client.
[8146.639s] Anton.
[8149.36s] Okay. Looking at buying gun dealers in
[8151.84s] healthc care, not the soldiers.
[8158.0s] Might want to look at
[8161.92s] GXI.
[8176.159s] Uh hard pass, huge negative free cash
[8179.199s] flow,
[8181.04s] margins declining.
[8183.28s] What is this thing do?
[8186.48s] Critical packaging and delivery systems.
[8190.239s] Yeah, not yet. I want to see more of a
[8191.92s] turn before I get interested in that.
[8194.16s] Anton from Denmark, but thanks for the
[8195.84s] question. Adrien Smith.
[8201.599s] So, I started half position in QXO the
[8204.0s] end of April with the intention of
[8205.12s] adding to it over the coming months.
[8206.479s] Since then, it&#39;s up around 85% in less
[8208.639s] than two months. Obviously, not going to
[8210.16s] complain about that, but was only able
[8212.08s] to get a half position. What do you do
[8213.359s] when a position gets away from you
[8214.8s] before you can make a meaningful
[8216.719s] position? Uh, nothing. And number one,
[8220.0s] and usually I put the whole position on
[8221.599s] it at once or at least, you know, 80
[8224.0s] 90%. If it goes lower, I add more. If it
[8225.92s] goes higher, I have what I have and
[8227.359s] that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t chase up. Uh, thank
[8230.0s] you for your great content invaluable as
[8232.639s] uh for growth as an investor. Well,
[8234.319s] you&#39;re welcome and good question. Uh, CK
[8237.28s] Patel,
[8238.96s] love your podcast. Would like to find
[8241.519s] out your thoughts on uh B2Bwi.
[8245.28s] Uh, I think we covered this one. I don&#39;t
[8247.359s] like this business.
[8252.0s] Bath and Body Works.
[8255.04s] No, it it&#39;s probably fine. Let me take a
[8257.76s] look at the fundamentals here.
[8272.88s] Cash flows never recovered to peak.
[8274.96s] Revenues
[8278.16s] margins are kind of I mean what what&#39;s
[8280.8s] the motivation here? You want to write
[8282.16s] from 25 to 50? I I wouldn&#39;t chase that.
[8284.639s] I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any I don&#39;t
[8286.88s] think that&#39;s a great business. I don&#39;t
[8288.0s] think it has a great moat. I think it&#39;s
[8289.599s] like a fad that runs in cycles and
[8291.76s] eventually goes out of business. John
[8294.24s] Francis
[8295.76s] Porsche, you Porsche people. All right.
[8299.519s] Uh no, I I won&#39;t buy any OEMs no matter
[8302.639s] how cheap they are. uh even Ferrari
[8305.04s] which has done well.
[8313.28s] Okay, and that&#39;s it. We&#39;ll be back next
[8315.76s] week. Same time, same place. In the
[8317.359s] meantime, make it a great one. Bye for
[8319.359s] now.
