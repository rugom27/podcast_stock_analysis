**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Ceasefire in the Middle East
- Potential tax cuts
- Dissent among Fed members
- Low institutional sentiment
- Global liquidity at record highs

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is poised to push to new highs this summer, driven by a V-shaped recovery and global liquidity. The Fed is expected to become more dovish, leading to rate cuts. Selectively constructive approach is key, focusing on undervalued opportunities outside the Magnificent Seven.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Oil Price | $66 a barrel | Helpful to inflation down the road. The Saudis and Russians are going to continue to pump. Oil is going to stay down. Inflation's going to stay low. |
| Institutional Sentiment | Near COVID lows | Institutional sentiment is at near COVID lows still. With markets near near-time highs, institutional sentiment, you saw from Bank of America and the fund manager survey, uh, near great financial crisis lows. The markets climb a wall of worry. These people are going to be forced in. |
| Global M2 Money Supply | Record Highs | Global M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there's a lot to be constructive about here. |
| US Debt to GDP | 120% | The only way we're going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. |
| Non-commercial futures percentage open interest | Contrarian buy levels | This is back to contrarian buy levels what we saw near COVID lows which is unbelievable. We talked about the sentiment uh today with Brad Smith. Uh these are just still not numbers you see near top. So we're going to run higher. |
| Emerging Markets | Breaking out of long cup and handle | This is a critical chart here uh showing emerging markets just now breaking out of this long cup and handle which implies a measured move of at least uh 12 points. So 59 for starters. And then at that point, you're breaking out to new all-time highs and you get a bigger cup and you're looking more like uh move from 32 to 60 28 plus 60 you're looking at a move to 88. We're at 47. So a basic double uh if you have a little patience with emerging markets over the next couple few years. |

## Risks & Contrarian Flags
- ⚠️ A downside risk would be if President Trump didn't like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th.
- ⚠️ Biggest downside risk for Albemarle would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we're no longer going to subsidize our green initiative.

## Technical Takeaways
Small caps are outperforming, indicating a risk-on environment. The Magnificent Seven are back to the top of their range. US stock valuations are at a 75-year high relative to the rest of the world, suggesting international exposure is warranted.
