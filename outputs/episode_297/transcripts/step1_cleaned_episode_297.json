That is on set at the Big Money Show, Jackie D&#39;Angelus. Uh that is Charlie Gasparino, Cheryl Cassone, of course. That&#39;s in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Never gets old. That&#39;s in front of the CNBC booth. Uh that&#39;s with Brad Smith over at Yahoo. Uh had a fun time there. This is the control booth where they produce while it&#39;s going on live.

He&#39;s a billionaire uh oil guy and uh supermarket guy in New York City. You know, Gristitis uh outside Fox again. And finally\n\nthe market still looking favorably on the ceasefire deal and its continuation. Dow up to 280, NASDAQ up 211. Oil price down again this morning. Last time we checked it was $66 a barrel. That&#39;s a help to inflation down the road. This is the major component to inflation. And the Saudis are going to continue to pump. They don&#39;t want sanctions. They want to be helpful. The Russians are going to continue to pump. They need income. Oil is going to stay down. Everyone was all up in arms about the Straits of Hormuz. It&#39;s never been shut down in all of these different battles, the Gulf War, etc. It&#39;s never been shut down. Oil&#39;s going to stay low. Inflation&#39;s going to stay low. Powell is going to have to move because the natives are getting restless. Wallers&#39;s come out, Goulsby&#39;s come out, Bowman&#39;s come out, everyone&#39;s come out saying, listen, this is a temporary tax if anything. It&#39;s even in their summary of economic projections that it&#39;s going to be temporary. And by the same same token, their projections 1.4% 4% real GDP. If if GDP is going to be that low, he should have done 50 basis points in June. He&#39;s got to go. He&#39;s going to try to push it off to September, and that&#39;ll probably be okay. But now you got more and more people coming out. Maybe we get a surprise in July. How low could the price of oil go? Can you get back into the 50s? And will American drillers drill and pump if it&#39;s in the $50 barrel range? At 50 it&#39;s a little tougher for them to pump aggressively with rates at this rate. Uh if rates start to come down, we could see some pumping in the 50s for sure. And that would keep oil low for a long time. But Powell&#39;s got to move. If we get the big beautiful tax break, okay, if we get that, if we get a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, if we get the ceasefire holding in the Middle East, does the market rally significantly? We are going to new highs. We&#39;re going to new highs this summer, probably before August. Institutional sentiment is at near COVID lows still. With markets near near-time highs, institutional sentiment, you saw from Bank of America and the fund manager survey, uh, near great financial crisis lows. The markets climb a wall of worry. These people are going to be forced in. We&#39;re going to get new highs in July. All of the energy stocks are down. We&#39;re at $65 a barrel for oil. The oil companies were up a little bit yesterday because look, they could all make money at 50 55 for break even. So when oil&#39;s at 80, great. Now that oil is back to $65 a barrel, a little bit less profitable for them to pump. So again, they fall along with the price of oil. You could get oil below 60 bucks a barrel. If rates come down, it becomes more and more profitable for them to pump at lower levels. But until, you know, Chair Powell has been a little bit belligerent, you know, the natives are saying, &quot;Let&#39;s cut into July.&quot; And he says, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; Let&#39;s have a look at the defense stocks, too. I believe they&#39;re mostly down, but that&#39;s because of the ceasefire. We talked yesterday about traditional defense that was up as we were waiting for the escalation and then traditional defense that is down as we&#39;ve sort of gotten the deescalation. Also, don&#39;t forget cyber security defense as well is another uh role in this. Bitcoin&#39;s back to 105,000 bucks of coin. We&#39;re close to a record, right? Like 110 112 is a record. This is a classic risk on, right? This is a market trying to figure out do we like gold? Do we like dollar? Do we like Bitcoin? How does Bitcoin fit in a portfolio if it&#39;s risk on? Dow&#39;s up 300. Fiser now they&#39;re a fintech financial technology company. They&#39;re partnering with Mastercard to adopt stable coin. FIUSD is the Fiser&#39;s token and they want to have it all across Mastercard products. So they want to allow customers to smoothly transition from fiat currencies to the stable coin. They want merchants to also get paid if they wish in this stable coin instead of a dollar or fiat. Basically saying that they want stable coins to be ubiquous across continents and across currencies. So that they think the stable coin again is this new okay currency if you will. I thought the stable coin was bad for Mastercard and Visa. It&#39;s an uncertain period. Here&#39;s how I would hedge it. I gave your audience a stock called PayPal in the in the high50s. It&#39;s now in the low7s. They are the sixth largest issuer of stable coins. So if you like the fee business, PayPal&#39;s got 450 million users. If you like the stable coin business, they&#39;re the sixth largest issuer. That&#39;s the way to kind of hedge your risk until we get more clarity of how this is going to play out for Visa and Mastercard. I would not be a buyer of Visa or Mastercard here. Uber and Whimo. They&#39;ve launched their robo taxi service in Atlanta. Elon Musk puts a couple cars on the road in Austin with drivers in the autonomous cars. He gets tens of billions of dollars of e equity cap value. Whimo&#39;s been going for years. Google gets zero value for Whimo and Google stock. Microsoft just hit an all-time high and we got some more drama between Microsoft and Open AI.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nPayPal&#39;s got 450 million users.

That&#39;s the way to kind of hedge your risk until we get more clarity of how this is going to play out for Visa and Mastercard. I would not be a buyer of Visa or Mastercard here.\n\nUber and Whimo. They&#39;ve launched their robo taxi service in Atlanta. You open up your Uber app, you can either get an Uber X or an Uber Comfort, and you may get paired up with a fully autonomous Whimo, and they drive those Jaguar Pacer cars, but you can opt out if you end up not wanting that. You can cancel it and switch to a nonf fully autonomous ride as well. \n\nElon Musk puts a couple cars on the road in Austin with drivers in the autonomous cars. He gets tens of billions of dollars of e equity cap value. Whimo&#39;s been going for years. Google gets zero value for Whimo. It&#39;s already working. Everyone&#39;s driving around with no drivers. It&#39;s great. Zero value attributed to to Whimo and Google stock.\n\nMicrosoft just hit an all-time high and we got some more drama between Microsoft and Open AI. enterprise customers are having a harder time deciding to switch on over to the Microsoft copilot AI. One executive said the chat GPT is so fun that um, the co-pilot is sort of losing out in ground to chat GPT from enterprise customers. One executive said chat GPT is fun. The co-pilot from Microsoft is useful, but really only within the other suite of Microsoft products. So again, this is chat GPT going up against the biggie, your Microsoft. \n\nAmazon, they&#39;ve expanded their same day delivery service where now. They&#39;re going to be investing about $4 billion to triple their delivery network by 2026. They&#39;re expanding same day and next day delivery to now more than 4,000 smaller cities.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAdvanced auto parts. Okay, here&#39;s what I love to do, Steu. I&#39;m known on Wall Street as Turnaround Tom. I like to buy highquality companies when they&#39;re marked down. These two stocks I&#39;m going to talk about are marked down twothirds. Okay, they&#39;re great businesses. Shane O Kelly&#39;s coming into Advanced Auto Parts. Average car on the road is 13 and a half years. Uh they&#39;ve mismanaged it. He&#39;s deleveraged the balance sheet. Closed down 500 unprofitable. Is it double? This is going to Advanced Auto Parts could triple over the next 3 to 5 years. Their margins have bottomed out at 2 and a half%. They&#39;re going to seven. Last time they were uh uh high single digits, the stock traded at $150. Yeah. Okay. Show me Show me Estee Lauder. Limited time here. Okay, you like it. Where&#39;s it going? At 79. Where&#39;s it going? It&#39;s going to 100 plus in the short term. Talking about a year or less and then beyond that, this thing could be a double from here. Turn around, Tom.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nTom Hayes with me putting I&#39;m putting Boeing on the screen. I think that&#39;s the only defense stock that&#39;s up and you&#39;re going to tell me why it&#39;s up. Yeah, no question. We gave it to your audience, by the way, a couple months ago at 135 when no one wanted it. It&#39;s up at 203. But there were these multi-tonon bombs that were dropped and decimated Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions over the weekend. Boeing makes those bunker bunker buster bombs. They make the GPU 57. That&#39;s absolutely right. 30,000. Yeah. And did they work or not? They they work like nobody&#39;s business. And Boeing&#39;s back to 200 bucks a share. All right.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nSo, with all this data and the S&amp;P 500 within striking distance of an all-time high, I do want to bring in Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and managing member at Greyhill Capital. Thomas, welcome. Thanks for having me, Kristen. Great to have you on the show. I think last time you were here, we had seen a lot of volatility in the markets. You were bullish. Are you bullish today? We continue to be bullish. We we have some tailwinds here, Kristen. First off, the ceasefire. I mean, Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions were completely decimated over the weekend. Uh Boeing bunker bombs absolutely decimated the the the the sites. Uh then you&#39;ve got the big beautiful tax bill. Donald Trump, President Trump says no vacations until we get it done. That&#39;s going to be very very constructive in terms of tax cuts. Uh and then we can get on with growth and deregulation. We went from tariffs and wars to growth and deregulation. That&#39;s that&#39;s a very positive thing.

Uh and then finally\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely.

McCormack also reiterated its full year 2025 guidance with the company&#39;s CEO saying they have quote robust plans to mitigate current tariff related costs. That&#39;s despite several potential headwinds for the consumer staple market, including dietary changes, trade uncertainty, and inflation. You&#39;re taking a look at shares of McCormack higher by about 5.3% on the back of these results. We were talking in the break about how much I take pride in in my own seasonings and the cooking of the proteins necessarily. Uh you got to have a little flavor in there. Yeah, there&#39;s no question about it. And I&#39;m looking at, you know, I look at sectors, they call me turnaround time, I like to buy businesses that are out of favor. I&#39;m looking at consumer staples and defensives and I&#39;m you&#39;re seeing a lot in that group, whether it&#39;s Craft Hind, there was some recent news out Mills, Hormeell. Uh these are all kind of left for dead stock. So, you know, you seeing McCormick&#39;s earnings, this might be a preview of coming attractions for some of those that have kind of been uh uh unfavored of late or unseasoned of late. Uh and uh maybe coming through this earning season, they they start to get interesting, particularly when volatility picks up in the fall and money moves a little bit more defensively. So, keep your eye on consumer staples, uh packaged products and and the like. If it wasn&#39;t so hot outside, I&#39;d be ready to go outside in season with some McCormick, but it&#39;s pretty uh it&#39;s pretty toasty, so I don&#39;t need to be by the grill. Thomas, stick around. We&#39;ve got more here. You can scan the QR code below to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance&#39;s trending tickers page. All your markets action straight ahead. Stay tuned. You&#39;re watching Market Catalyst into the conversation because you did not mince words on the Fed&#39;s role within this earlier. So given what we&#39;re seeing transpire within the housing market right now, to what extent is that the Fed, to what extent is that also just a byproduct of people needing to figure out, okay, how much home can they afford? The the affordability issue and then the number of people that are also just still sitting on their homes because they got locked in at very good rates. Well, that&#39;s the problem. I mean, you run rates 200 basis points above inflation, you have unintended consequences. Number one, unaffordability for the 72 millennials who want to start a family. And number two is all these baby boomers that want to get out of their equity, but they&#39;re not going to sell a $2 million house, take out a million dollar equity, and then go into a 7% mortgage when they&#39;re in a 3% mortgage. So, I think the name of the game this summer is that the SLR is going to bring down the 10-year Treasury, 30 to 70 basis points. You&#39;re going to see 30-year fixed rate go below 6%. And at that level, I think you&#39;re going to see a huge amount of inventory. And then you look at the home builders, okay, who wants to risk capital building massive amounts of starter homes at 7% and have them sit in inventory? They can&#39;t make the investment and and this is the unintended consequence of one guy trying to protect his legacy and not be Arthur Burns. And the conditions of the economy are not and the demographics are nothing like they were in the 70s. Uh so they&#39;ve got to move and if they don&#39;t move, we&#39;re going to get a shadow Fed and that&#39;s going to move the market and he can just sit in the desk for seven months until he leaves. I mean, it&#39;s not fun being Fed Chair Jerome Pal because you are the face of the decisions that a body of people and Fed governors make within that committee. You know what, in fairness, you had autopilot in December 2018. You remember that crashed the S&amp;P 20% until Minutian came in and fixed it. You had transitory. So, listen, I mean, his legacy is his legacy. He&#39;s got a chance to do it right and go out a winner like Seinfeld. And he&#39;s missing the boat. So, he&#39;s got July. Let&#39;s see what happens in the next few weeks and he can be an absolute champion and help 72 million millennials get their families started and get in new houses, help the home builders. And by the way, it&#39;s 16 housing is 16.2% of GDP. You know how many jobs that creates that are being held up by this artificially restrictive environment. Claire, last word goes to you. What does this mean for the homebuilders? What are we hearing on the stronger Treasury auctions that took place the week prior to that as well? So what is the the larger implications that traders and investors are thinking through in their mindset? The most important thing\n\nthe name of the game this summer is that the SLR is going to bring down the 10-year Treasury, 30 to 70 basis points. You&#39;re going to see 30-year fixed rate go below 6%. And at that level, I think you&#39;re going to see a huge amount of inventory. And then you look at the home builders, okay, who wants to risk capital building massive amounts of starter homes at 7% and have them sit in inventory? They can&#39;t make the investment and and this is the unintended consequence of one guy trying to protect his legacy. The conditions of the economy are not and the demographics are nothing like they were in the 70s. So, they&#39;ve got to move and if they don&#39;t move, we&#39;re going to get a shadow Fed and that&#39;s going to move the market. You had autopilot in December 2018. You remember that crashed the S&P 20% until Minutian came in and fixed it. You had transitory. So, listen, I mean, his legacy is his legacy. He&#39;s got a chance to do it right and go out a winner. He&#39;s missing the boat. So, he&#39;s got July. Let&#39;s see what happens in the next few weeks and he can be an absolute champion and help 72 million millennials get their families started and get in new houses, help the home builders. And by the way, it&#39;s 16 housing is 16.2% of GDP. You know how many jobs that creates that are being held up by this artificially restrictive environment.\n\nthe tax cuts. Okay. So we&#39;ve gone from bombing and tariffs to growth and deregulation. And growth is a function of the tax cuts uh as Brett is alluding to. It&#39;s a little bit stimulative here and and you can kind of talk a little bit more about that in in detail. I would just say uh so that&#39;s critical. So, you know, if tax rates were to go up, uh it&#39;s going to impact earnings. It&#39;s going to have a negative impact on the economy, hiring growth, the whole thing. So, that&#39;s not going to happen. We&#39;ve got uh the Treasury doing what they&#39;re doing with the SLR. We&#39;ve got the tax cuts coming in and animal spirits coming back because man management can plan. They can start to forecast, kind of understand the rules, whereas the first half of the year, everyone was uncertain. So, uh, Brett, how do you handicap this get getting done by July 4th or no vacation, no one goes home locking them in a room? You&#39;ve been through this process many times. Does this look any different or is this just the normal back and forth and eventually they get something done? Yeah, I mean, it does look like the normal process of back and forth. Um it&#39;s just that they are the the next Fed chair could be might look like in terms of commentary that we could hear hear from that person and a and almost shadow fed because that person wouldn&#39;t be going in until May 2026, but we&#39;d get more inclination through what they&#39;re willing to talk about openly and publicly and policy could be one of those one of those areas where the Fed typically will not comment on that and try to be apolitical. yet you would have someone who would be put forward in their name and have pretty much open season to say whatever they want leading up to that point. I I think it&#39;s less what they say and more who they are. So, you know, if Hassid&#39;s the guy, I I think the market starts to discount that pretty darn quick and that&#39;s going to have long-term implications in terms of refinancing the debt, the cost of the debt, etc. Uh but I have one last question for you, Brett. What what what do you think as the bill stands right now? uh what do you think that adds or detracts from GDP in the short term over the next 12 months if it went through today as is incremental benefit or uh drag? Yeah, it would be about about 40 basis points positive. Wow. Um you know depending on how where you put some of the scoring um but yeah on on a from a deficit from fiscal impulse perspective 30 to 40 basis points positive for sure relative to trend. And so, you know, that&#39;s if trend is the Fed&#39;s trend is 18, you know, you&#39;re looking at 2-1. Our forecast is around 2% next year. Um, but again, a lot remains to be be seen. Fed chair, that&#39;s a whole different uh whole different whole different that&#39;s another hour. I think the the next one the next Fed chair, you know, you have to be careful as as you alluded to. You know, if if the market loses confidence that the Fed is independent, then your long end is going to is going to be a serious problem and it doesn&#39;t matter what how much you cut in the front end. Brethren, thanks so much for taking the time here. Joining us in studio, Thomas, thanks for staying with us for the conversation as well. You stick around, we&#39;ve got much more ahead.### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nThe brands that they own. I mean, this is a company we&#39;re talking about that not only has the swoosh, they also have, of course, as you were mentioning this new partnership with SKIMS. They&#39;ve been leading into some of those collaborations. And then additionally, they&#39;ve got Jordan Brand, which they&#39;ve leaned into. Oh yeah, don&#39;t forget Converse as well, where they just had one of their stars win the NBA Finals. So, all of these things considered here, they&#39;ve got different levers that they can pull. And my goodness, I don&#39;t know if you had the the Air Jordan 1&#39;s when they first came out, Thomas, but uh they&#39;re about to hit Jordan 40 right now, which is my Listen, the most important thing they&#39;ve got is Scotty Sheffler. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. I love a great turnaround story. You know, you were going through all those negative points, Brooke, and all the analysts are so negative in the whole uh you know, trying to get past this. Yeah, it reminds me of other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln? But I love when when the market&#39;s so pessimistic. They did screw their their wholesalers to say it. They&#39;ve got to rebuild those relationships. They&#39;re going to uh you know, my nickname on the street is turnaround Tom. I would love to buy a lot of Nike. I should be buying a lot of Nike at these levels. I really hope it goes down a lot after earnings and maybe that&#39;ll be a new position, but um you know, I&#39;m betting on another turnaround specialist, Bracken Daryl, over at VF Corp. He&#39;s got his work cut out for him. He&#39;s going to turn that business. So, I I don&#39;t know if I want to be overexposed, but man, fresh capital. Uh if this thing is lower, I&#39;d probably be inclined to buy it with a 3 to 5 year view. Are you talking about a low below what we&#39;ve already seen? I think they struck 52 earlier. Yeah, I&#39;d love to see it approach that level. If it did, I&#39; I&#39;d be inclined like at some point you got to stop watching and step into the ring. Uh you look through I think the turnaround is going to be slower than the optimists think, but I think it&#39;s going to be certain. This is a this is a company of winners. They they they hire the best. They get the best athletes using their stuff. They got to get back to winning, and they will get back to winning, and they&#39;ve got to rebuild those relationships. So maybe we&#39;ll see some signs of that tonight. Uh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t anticipate it&#39;s going to flush out to the level that that would attract me. it probably we&#39;re at the stage where you&#39;re going to see some good news would be my expectation because expectations are so darn low. Yeah. And I do want to point out I still have Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member with me here. And as we&#39;re taking a look at shares of Black Rockck, they&#39;re up by about 1% here on the day. Is this really expected to move the dial longer term here? Why does it make sense for Black Rockck to do this? Yeah, I I think they&#39;re doing it because they can. Okay, it&#39;s a huge market. the idea is to democratize private equity. But you see they follow the trends. You know, first Larry Frink said uh Bitcoin was no good and then the thing took off and then he started offering it to the public with the ETFs etc. So I I do think that there&#39;s going to be a place this is going to be promoted by a lot of uh financial advisors. This is going to be a part of the portfolio. The beauty of private equity and private credit which have become so popular is that you have uh no marktomarket. So, it&#39;s perceived low volatility because they mark the assets what what we used to say during the great financial crisis, marked to make believe or mark to whatever. And you never really see a mark until the asset is worth zero until it&#39;s fully marked down. So, in a in a bull market like this, everything&#39;s marked up. Everyone&#39;s happy. There&#39;s no volatility. You don&#39;t see that daily volatility. Retail loves that. Institutions, institutional consultants love not having the volatility. They love their sharp ratios when they come in the 25-year-old with their clipboard. uh uh but when you take the marks the marks are big. So I I think there&#39;s going to be a place for this in in a lot of 401ks and and for a lot of retail investors are going to try their hand but as you move into a recessionary type of period these are the assets that you want to be careful of. Yeah I was taking a look at one of the\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAnd I do want to point out I still have Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member with me here.

That's some of the growth here that we've seen.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ncharts from Torsten Slok, chief economist, saying private equity as a percentage of public equity market 2003 3.8% 2024 8.8%. That's some of the growth here that we've seen.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nI want to thank Alexander Osipovich for including me in his article uh on the Wall Street Journal.\n\nguess who is on CNBC this morning is Alex Chris from PayPal. They teamed up with the Big 10 and Big 12 to enable payments to student athletes. We&#39;re going to listen in now. Are there exactly 22 teams? Is that more? It&#39;s like the S&amp;P 500. to enable college athletic departments to pay their student athletes directly through the financial platform. Uh this comes after the landmark June6 court ruling that allows schools to directly compensate uh student athletes starting on July 4th or July 1st. Joining us now to make the announcement first on CNBC PayPal CEO Alex Chris uh and Big 12 Commissioner uh Brent Yormack and Venmo&#39;s involved. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nUm they&#39;re already culturally relevant and connecting with that demographic. So, that was ideal for us. Um, but it&#39;s a very strategic partnership and I think you&#39;re going to see us do more and more things like this where campuses and the conference come together and provide great brands with solutions like we have here with PayPal and uh you&#39;re probably psyched. You&#39;ll get everybody. Who else who else would uh would compete with you with with other colleges? Well, look, we we will we are the best way to distribute the funds. And what&#39;s important is you need to have the wallet that the college students are using.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquestions  we had was, can you grow Venmo? And you know, you&#39;re starting to see it now in in the results. We grew revenue over 20% last quarter. We&#39;ve got our pay with Venmo up 50%, our debit card up 40%. And partnerships like this just enable us to to reach our customers. I&#39;ve been with PayPal for a very long time. I got Vimmo too. Now every time I go to pay with um PayPal, it asks me if I want to do the pay now pay later option instead of just paying right you know I now pay later instead of just paying now for everything. How much of your business is that? That new kind of idea of get it now pay for it later. Yeah. Look, and it&#39;s connected to to the younger demographic. We are finding more and more college students and younger demographic wanting to pay with debit and buy now pay later as their credit option. And so our pay later, buy now pay later uh product is growing very quickly. Uh and it&#39;s becoming we grew 20% over 20% last quarter in buy now pay later. And so uh it&#39;s becoming the way that people want to spend. They don&#39;t want credit cards as as often. They want debit and buy now pay later.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nand they can come to. And we&#39;re back. And quote of the week, Charlie Munger, a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they&#39;ve got terrible temperaments. Uh, cool is the name of the game. Patience buy high quality businesses when they&#39;re temporarily marked down and sit on your hands or go play golf. The secret to success is to do the unc to do the common thing uncommonly well. Everyone invests. Very few people do it well because they&#39;re always chasing the shiny object. They&#39;re always sucked into the action, always chasing headline stocks, following the herd, and eventually leading to slaughter.\n\nWe grew revenue over 20% last quarter.

The secret to success is to do the unc to do the common thing uncommonly well. Everyone invests. Very few people do it well because they're always chasing the shiny object. They're always sucked into the action, always chasing headline stocks, following the herd, and eventually leading to slaughter.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nMoving along , let's get down to the data. Uh here we are. We've got um this is from Bank of America. Let's get this going here. There we go. Maybe I can do it this way. Yes. Okay. Net debt to market cap and US debt to GDP. This is pretty interesting. It shows that while the country's balance sheet is near historic uh historically bad, corporate balance sheet S&P 500 net debt to market cap is at record good. Okay. So debt to market cap is around 10% whereas debt to GDP is around 120%. I would not have guessed that for the S&P. That's pretty amazing. Here's from Fundstrat. Uh non-commercial futures percentage open interest. So this is back to contrarian buy levels what we saw near COVID lows which is unbelievable. We talked about the sentiment uh today with Brad Smith. Uh these are just still not numbers you see near top. So we're going to run higher. uh total money market funds still 7%. When uh rates come down, all that money is going to be forced back into equities. They're right now just sitting sitting out collecting four and a half 5%. That game is going to be over. They're going to be forced back out on the risk curve. Uh US dollar bare market is a 20 to 40% bare market just getting started. Uh dollar continues to weaken over time. We probably get short-term bounce. Bull bear indicator not yet at extreme. Gasoline prices below average for the past four years. That's not inflationary. Jay Powell weaker summer performance that could be we might have had a pull forward on the correction this year. So I wouldn't be too uh skittish yet. And I think even August, September, October is more going to be like sideways chop than a than another big crash. Uh and then we're going to end a year higher. uh Raymond James, it's going to be more of a rotation. Uh I mean, if you're just in indices, then yeah, maybe worry a little bit, but if you're in uh the right stocks, you probably actually it'll be the opposite. When the indices are doing weak, those will start to do better. Uh\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNet debt to market cap and US debt to GDP. It shows that while the country&#39;s balance sheet is near historic uh historically bad, corporate balance sheet S&P 500 net debt to market cap is at record good. Debt to market cap is around 10% whereas debt to GDP is around 120%. I would not have guessed that for the S&P. Non-commercial futures percentage open interest is back to contrarian buy levels what we saw near COVID lows which is unbelievable. Total money market funds still 7%. US dollar bare market is a 20 to 40% bare market just getting started. Bull bear indicator not yet at extreme. Gasoline prices below average for the past four years. Jay Powell weaker summer performance that could be we might have had a pull forward on the correction this year. Raymond James, it&#39;s going to be more of a rotation.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmore shelter disinflation likely in the pipeline. I think as rates go down, usually when you think of rates going down, prices go up. I think this is going to be the exact opposite this cycle. What&#39;s going to happen is a lot of homes are going to hit the market that have been trapped in 3% mortgages with millions of equity that are all going to hit the market at once and make homes more affordable. \n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nInternational value stocks are outperforming this year by a wide margin. Uh Iran&#39;s oil exports mostly go to China. It was interesting that Trump said that Iran can still export to China, wanting to get Iran to the table and wanting to get uh China&#39;s deal inked up. Real S&P 500 in index versus conflicts. You can see these conflicts over the last uh 150 years and how the S&P trends up over time. Weak US dollar environments create positive returns for financial markets and risky assets. What are the biggest beneficiaries when the dollar index falls 10%. Emerging markets, equity, we&#39;ve been talking about that for ages. Annual realized and bottom up consensus EPS growth estimates. What&#39;s going to be the biggest? Again, this continues to be updated. uh Russell by far 2025 18% earnings growth relative to the S&P of seven. Uh next year 37% earnings growth relative to the S&P of 14. Concentration of S&P market cap in earnings and the 10 largest inst index cont constituents. Uh 10 largest constituents make up 38% of the market cap but only 30% of the earnings and that amount of earnings is declining. This shows a cyclical uh move for the dollar over the last 50 years. It runs in about uh six or sevenyear cycles. You can see here we are at the top of the cycle and should be headed down for another three consecutive years for the US dollar. Defensive sectors influence at 35year low. Some of S&amp;P 500 defensive sector weights, consumer staples, energy, healthcare, and utilities. Make of this what you will, but we argue that a thematic rotation is a better route to defensive allocations. I would say this is pointing back to 2000 levels, 2001, which we&#39;ve covered a lot, which implies you want to start to get exposure to staples. We touched on it with Brad. Some of these defensive stocks like the Hormelas, like the Baxters, uh, in in healthcare, etc., like the Crown Castles, they are going to start to do well. that probably begins uh right now in the third quarter after earnings. Once you make new highs in the market and volatility starts in August, these defenses are going to start to spike up. Returns are highest when multiples are lowest, but otherwise matter little and that&#39;s where we are with our basket of stocks with low valuations and uh turning around massively. Rate cut expectations are now off the charts. I think it was 85% for September. for now and even 25% for July which is new. Lowest positioning in net non-commercial futures lowest positioning in 12 months to equities. So again that&#39;s not what you see at tops. I think we&#39;re going to push higher and just force maximum pain from all the l all the people who sold in the hole in April. Uh market implied US recession probability indicator is average. Uh foreign treasuries holdings may re remain near record. Everyone said they were going to sell all our treasuries. It&#39;s actually at a record high. 25 25 2025 total returns. US stocks 2.1%, international stocks 15.9. That&#39;s probably uh couple points now. I think US is up 4% and international is like 15. But we came into that with that minority view. Everyone said, you know, oh whatever. Gave me a lot of for it. Well, it&#39;s worked. Uh Charlie Bleello, US office to residential conversions are about to explode from a trickle today to a flood in 2027. Empty office towers to apartments, condos, hotels, future commercial real estate is going to look very different. Um you know, I pounded the hell out of the table two years ago for those of you who were real estate investors to buy office in San Francisco. And those guys have made an absolute killing like like insane money. I wish that was my game. Well, I don&#39;t wish that&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t have made as much money doing that, but you&#39;d if by real estate terms, you would have made a massive absolutely amount of money. So, um, so now I think if they&#39;re all converting to apartments, the the way to play it is buy BNC office and sit on your hands because eventually all the office is going to get spped up. Converted to a glut of apartments, those guys are going to lose and the ones that are left holding actual office are going to make a fortune. Onethird of baby boomers say they&#39;ll never sell. Good luck with that. The word never is usually right before they do. biggest inflow into energy. Once that once the supply hits the markets and price start getting bid and and hit the air pocket and they start to get fear of loss that all of their millions of equity that they work their whole life for are evaporating, they&#39;re all going to hit the market at once. Biggest inflow to energy funds since October 23. Short interest has risen in 2025 year to date. Uh so that that&#39;s more fuel. Shorts are the first buyers as we push to new highs. They&#39;re all going to be forced in. All the people waiting for the retest we&#39;ve talked about over the last week got absolutely monkey hammered. US household assets and liabilities total assets 179 trillion total liabilities 19. Everyone&#39;s balance sheet is good. Corporations people the only balance sheets that&#39;s bad is the US government. Equity ownership across wealth distribution 43% in the top 100 36% in the top sorry in the top 1% 36% in the so 10% own 79% of equities next 40% own 19% and the bottom 50% own 1% economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025 um what is this. Oh, K Schiller. Oh, home prices month. Yeah, a lot of markets starting to get hit, particularly Florida and Texas. That&#39;s usually where it starts. Market concentration is a global phenomenon. Top constituents by part market share. UK equities heavily weighted towards the top 10 stocks as well. Uh once a diverse index S&amp;P 500 is now around 50% growth weight of value growth plus fang mag 7 blend. Yeah, that&#39;s what you always see before reversals. It was the same thing in 1999. Dividend changes 5%. We&#39;ll skip that one. The high if higher in May and June, the rest of the year does very well. So when we&#39;ve seen conditions like this on average 12 months out up 14.8%. Uh USM2 money supply is now up 4 5% year on year. Slightly below the historical average growth rate but that&#39;s because we had such a big boom in 2000. But uh we&#39;ve talked about global M2 money supply which is now well at record highs. This is a critical chart here uh showing emerging markets just now breaking out of this long cup and handle which implies a measured move of at least uh 12 points. So 59 for starters. And then at that point, you&#39;re breaking out to new all-time highs and you get a bigger cup and you&#39;re looking more like uh move from 32 to 60 28 plus 60 you&#39;re looking at a move to 88. We&#39;re at 47. So a basic double uh if you have a little patience with emerging markets over the next couple few years. Summer rally could should continue. We agree.

As you can see here, cash flow is starting to recover, but it&#39;s still iffy. Margins are starting to recover. That&#39;s actually real. A lot of good things beginning to happen. Key thing here, which Jeff wasn&#39;t able to circle, is you can see that over the past decade, the return on invested capital has been in the high teens to low 20s consistently until uh 2023. And this is coincident with the drop off in sales in China from 2021 to 2024. those are starting to recover. I think we&#39;re going to see a quicker recovery because it&#39;s not baked into the outlook uh the China recovery. The beauty is during the draw down is that they did not lose much share in China. They kept about 99% of the share that they had. They have number one uh share globally for premium skincare and cosmetics. That&#39;s not going to change. And for those of you who don&#39;t know, they cover a lot of brands. It&#39;s not just Estee Lauder. It&#39;s MAC. It&#39;s Clinique. It&#39;s Dr. Jart for the young kids love the Korean stuff. Um, it&#39;s Aveda. It&#39;s uh, it&#39;s more than you know. And they&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for 75 plus years, and they&#39;ll continue to do that. Similar to VF Corp, similar to Dagio. Last month, we put out a quick update following Estee Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings, but had not yet published a full deep dive. After falling below $50 a share at the April lows, the stock has been on a tear, rallying more than 50% off the bottom. Just this week, Deutsche Bank turned bullish on the turnaround story and issued a street high price of $95. We thought now would be a good time to revisit the name. Estee Lauder founded in 1946, is the global leader in premium beauty products with a portfolio of over 20 best-in-class iconic brands. Estee Lauder is basically to make up what and beauty what Diagio is to alcohol. Both are about as premium as it gets. The stock was never a huge position for us like Alibaba. It is largely a bet on the recovery of the Chinese middle class. And just like poker, we prefer positions with plenty of outs and few offer more outs than Baba. So while Estee Lauder may not be the everything business that Alibaba is, it still offers what we believe is a highly attractive riskreward setup. SA Lauder&#39;s roller coaster story over the past few years goes like this. When their prior CEO Fabriio Freda took the helm in 2009, his top priority was international expansion, aiming to generate over 60% of overall sales from international markets. That bet proved highly successful over the next decade, but also opened the door to significant overexposure to certain markets, especially China and travel retail. From fiscal year 2018 to 2021, China&#39;s share of total revenue jumped from just 13% to 36%. At one point, a single customer in China was responsible for 42% of the region sales. Management clearly bit off uh more than they could chew. And when the music stopped in 2022, Estee Lauder paid the price. Shares fell from nearly $375 to below $50 this past April, effectively wiping out more than a decade of gains. Now, this is exactly the kind of situation that earned me the nickname Turnaround Tom. As Buffett says, great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. That is the guiding light of our entire company at Great Hill Capital. That is the theme of everything we do is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. We benefit from that misappraisal. This could not be a more accurate description of Estee Lauder. At the end of the day, this is a company that is as high quality and durable as they come, working its way of a once in a hundredyear event, yet priced as if it is in permanent decline, and people will never spend money on makeup again. Oh, and by the way, it&#39;s kind of the reverse GLP. As people lose weight, they buy more makeup, not less. We are more than happy to take the other side of that trade, and that&#39;s because we see the bulk of it, Estee Lauder&#39;s challenges as cyclical, not structural, with all signs pointing to a bottoming and nearterm recovery. The name of the game with Estee Lauder turnaround is margin expansion. Gross margins fell nearly 500 basis points, peaked to trough, bottoming in fiscal year 2024 at 71.7% as management worked through excess inventories and write-offs. The good news is the gross margins have now posted three consecutive quarters of 300 basis point gains with current guidance calling for 73.5% for fiscal year 2025 and an expected return to the historical mid70s range by fiscal year 2027. Operating margins are where the crux of the turnaround really is. SA Lauder has historically delivered mid to high teen EBIT margins but in 2024 these bottomed out at just over 10%. Management is working to restore EBIT margins to a solid double-digit level over the next few years. And the with the profit recovery growth plan expected to generate 800 million to a billion in annual growth savings and the full run rate benefits anticipated by fiscal year 2027. Green shoots across the businesses continue to point toward a return to growth in 2026, which will allow operating leverage to really kick in and get SA Ladder back to making more money than they know what to do with. At the same time, you have a new CEO who is a proven winner in the industry, a push into higher margin digital channels like Amazon and Tik Tok and China working its way towards becoming a mega-sized consumption economy. We think over the next few years this is a double from current levels. Until then, we are happy to sit on our hands and wait. Now, here&#39;s an in-depth breakdown of Estee Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings. Uh, as the CEO said, quote, &quot;Return to sales growth in fiscal 2026.&quot; You should go through this line by line. We&#39;ve outlined the gross margin expansion expanded 310 basis points to 75% uh in the quarter. Uh achieved prestige beauty share gains for fiscal 2025. By the way, 10 years ago, prestige was 33% of all uh category purchases. Now it&#39;s 40%. This is a huge play on the emerging market middle class expansion. Um, they&#39;ll be one of the pure beneficiaries. On trend, commercial invocations, 10 new freestanding stores, Tik Tok shop. Okay, all this stuff you can look at. Let&#39;s just scroll down for now to the 10 key points. can see the improvement in China. All right, 10 key points. Number one, after sales declined 10% in fiscal year 2023 and 2% in 2024 and with guidance calling for another 8 to 9% in fiscal 2025, management remains confident in a return to growth by fiscal year 2026. Gross margins bottomed in fiscal year 2024 at 71.7 below the 5-year average of approximately 74, but have rebounded for three consecutive quarters with gains of over 300 basis points. Fiscal year 2025 guidance calls for 73.5% and management continues to target a return to the historical mid70s by fiscal year 2027. Three, management also remains confident in restoring operating margins to solid double digits over the next few years as a return to sales growth allows operating leverage to kick in. Margins bottomed in fiscal year 2024 at just over 10% well below the company&#39;s historical mid to high teens EBIT levels. Green shoots are emerging across the businesses with market share gains showing up in the US, China and Japan. In the US Q3 marked the first quarter in years with share gains driven by growth in three of four categories skincare, makeup and hair and 10 brands that held or gained shared led by Clinique which has now posted 11 consecutive quarters of gains in China. Estee Lauder gained share across all four brand categories and eight brands, making it the third quarter of share gains in the last four. And Japan Q3 marked the fourth straight quarter of market share growth. Tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on fiscal year 2025 profitability. Estee Lauder has the lowest exposure in the industry thanks to its nine manufacturing sites worldwide. Over 75% of what is sold in the US is sourced from the US or Canada and is protected on the USMCA agreement. 25% of what is sold in China is currently sourced from the US. But management aims to reduce this to less than 10% and has already mitigated north of 40% of the initial tariff impacts. Travel retail which is at its peak accounted for mid to high 20% of total sales thanks to shrink in in the low teens as a share of sales. Management is intentionally diversifying away from volatile travel retail significantly reducing inventories and de-risisking the segment outside of travel retail which declined 28% in Q3 and is expected to see another steep drop in Q4. Estee Lauder delivered sequential acceleration in global retail sales growth. Seven management remains on track with the expanded profit recovery growth plan PRGP which is expected to generate 800 million to a billion in annual growth savings with full run rate benefits anticipated by 2027. As of Q3, management has approved initiatives to eliminate over 2600 net positions with 85% expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and has already reduced middle management roles by 20% year-over-year. Aid Estee Ladder continues to lean into higher growth, higher margin digital channels with online organic sales up mid single digits in Q3. This includes 12 brands now available through Amazon prem premium beauty stores as well as momentum on Tik Tok shop helping digital channels reach 28% of total sales in 2024. That&#39;s up from just 13% in 2018. At the same time, exposure to department stores has been significantly reduced as a share of overall sales. Nine capital expenditures totaled 395 million, 3.62% 62% of sales in the 9 months ended Q3 down 44% from 72 million in the prior year period. Construction of the new factory in Japan had pushed capex as a percentage of sales to around 6% in recent years above the historical average of 4 to 5%. But spending is now expected to remain lower as management shifts focus to higher return on invested capital projects and allocate capex towards consumerf facing initiatives rather than capacity and capabilities. 10. In the first few weeks of Q4, management has continued to see strong retail momentum in the US, even stronger trends in China and positive momentum in UK across other emerging mark and across other emerging markets. Uh here&#39;s the earnings call transcript. You can go through the green highlights we put here at hedge funips.com. Just scroll down to popular post.

Estee Lauder is rise to ride poised to ride the beauty premiumization tailwinds. Very similar story to Diagio leader in uh products scale cost advantage blah blah blah 20 years middle class consumers global upgrade from mass brand shorter lead time digital platforms.

So, we&#39;re past that period a year where they take down guidance. Now, they&#39;re starting to take it back up. Um, economic data, again, same stuff we&#39;ve covered about employment, about uh, housing, etc. And now on to the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions . We have quite a few this week. If you like the\n\nThoughts on Clorox. Mike, we covered that a couple weeks ago. It's fine. Not the highest and best use for us, but uh, decent company at a good price. Not thrilled about the CEO. Maybe they'll change her out. Why did Etsy do a convert? They wanted to be as non-dilutive as they could and not pay high interest. So, uh, I kind of like that play. What are your thoughts on Shu Steve Madden? Let's take a look. S H O O H I haven't heard anyone talk about Steve Madden forever. I mean, just you just want to you just want to understand how they're going to turn around free cash flow here. I mean, I'll take a quick look at the balance sheet. Looks okay. I don't I don't like it. It's it's not the type of business that I'd be involved in, but I think you're going to be fine with it. And I think it's pretty good uh analysis and worth understanding their competitive moat.\n\nSimon Staz Staz Stazz uh Americ [Music] was suggested by big short guys as long yesterday. Well, I worked for Cornwell, so I don&#39;t know that they&#39;re in that. Um I think m miners as a general rule of thumb other than Albamaro are crap. um businesses even when the price of whatever they&#39;re mining goes up, they find a way to lose money. It&#39;s just a terrible business. ARG.TO All right. All right. Cash flows are recovering, revenues are recovering, margins are recovering. So, they&#39;re in the circular mo secular move here, but I think they&#39;re towards the top of the range. What do they mine? you know, these guys that are always bearish all the time and then the market makes new highs and they&#39;re forced to buy something. They always buy these pieces of that wind up doing nothing for them. So, what do these guys do? Uh, copper and copper concentrates in Chile. I mean, this is this is like too hard pile gamble and win maybe gamble and lose likely hard pass for me. Um, okay. John Wicker, love the pod. Thoughts on General Mills? I think this is in the group that&#39;s going to start to get bid in the fall. Uh, along with the Hormells and um I just don&#39;t think this has come down enough for me to get interested yet. At 40, I&#39;d probably be a buyer. Um, yeah, you just want to see some recovery in margins and revenues before you go crazy. Unless it gets down to 40, then you can kind of pull a J Powell and predict the recovery. But, uh, I I like it below 45. I don&#39;t like it here and I may never get it. So, we&#39;ll just wait on that or do nothing. More likely do nothing. Uh Jimmy Jones. Uh yeah, Hormemell is just a defensive spot in our portfolio with the margin of safety. He&#39;s talking about the interim CEO. Yeah, I wish they had their final CEO, but he&#39;ll fix things up. The business will start to turn. They&#39;ll get a hot shot in there. So, it might take a little longer, but in the meantime, you got a nice dividend and it&#39;s fine. I mean, could I see myself selling out of Hormeell and buying uh Craft Hines? Possibly. They&#39;re both kind of the same characteristic, but they&#39;re both going to basically do the same thing when that group turns. And that and same as General Mills. Those just have a a bigger upside than General Mills or or Campbell for that matter. Campbell&#39;s kind of a dog. Um all right, Jason Zen, Global Payments. We&#39;ve covered this one, Jason, a million times. We just don&#39;t like the business. Um, so I&#39;ll leave it at that. I think you&#39;re going to be okay on this, but uh I just forget what was the thing from the work I did a while back. I think it had to do with the opacity of the portfolio of the assets that they held or the margin compression, but there was something I didn&#39;t like about it. I think it works as a trade here. Uh, I understand why you&#39;re interested in here. Free cash flow is going fine. Margins are going fine. Starting to recover. I&#39;ve just never liked this business from a quality standpoint. I&#39;d rather be in PayPal, but uh I think it&#39;s going to work for you. So, good work on that. Uh Chuck. Okay. Uh here&#39;s Daniel Estz sent uh Tele Performance TEP. It&#39;s a French company. Free cash flow is going through the roof. Revenue is going through the roof. Margins are starting to recover. Return on capital has been spotty. uh business has been around for a long time if I&#39;m not mistaken. Founded in 1910 uh digital business services company operates specialized services segments, customer acquisition services, business process management, blah blah blah. They do a million things. Uh, seems like a company that&#39;s been pretty nimble over the years in adjusting to environments. Um, balance sheet. Let&#39;s take a look. Million dollar cash. Good statement. had some big growth. They must have done an acquisition good. Balance sheet generally looks okay. I mean it&#39;s generating a return on capital that&#39;s probably I don&#39;t know if we have weighted average cost of capital here. No. probably below its cost of capital. Yeah, look, I think this one is definitely definitely warrants doing some work. I mean, it&#39;s just going to be really understanding what is the competitive mode on all the businesses that they&#39;re doing. Why is the stock down so much? Uh, and um uh what&#39;s the turnaround story? But it&#39;s cheap. It looks like it&#39;s starting to grow again. Balance sheet seems okay. Check when they have to refinance everything. And I think you&#39;re on to something, Daniel. Uh\n\nI'd rather be in PayPal, but uh I think it's going to work for you. So, good work on that. Uh Chuck. Okay.

Uh\n\nBrendan Garvey, Hallebertton. I think I said Hallebertton was fine a few weeks ago. If you have to be in it, that I&#39;d probably choose that or Slumber. Um, I don&#39;t like it enough, but I think I think it&#39;ll work here. And we covered that in more detail back then. Robert Half. I think this is a staffing business. All right. I All right. So, their revenues and cash flow are not turning yet. Uh, what does their balance sheet look like? So, in these, you just got to go do the work and find out what&#39;s the plan to turn it around, and then you wait to see some signs of the plan working. Uh, but yeah, this this is a kind of adorable business. It probably bounces back, you know, $70, $75 range. It&#39;s 40. It&#39;s not a high, it&#39;s not a great use of capital for us. Uh, and you definitely need to start to see some recovery and understanding of the turnaround plan. But let&#39;s just see if you got waiting time to do it. Yeah, very very dimminimous debt. So, I think you&#39;re probably okay here. Uh, I don&#39;t love it and you should probably listen into, you know, four to eight of the last calls, find out what they&#39;re doing to turn the thing around. Uh, hey Tom, what are your thoughts on Craft Hind? Uh, yeah, we like it. We covered that last week or the week before. Uh, Leaf Foster, uh, BME in the UK, did you do any more work? No, I said it was worth you doing more work. I&#39;m not interested in it, but uh uh I thought it was worth you starting to do research if you like it. In other words, it passed the sniff test. Let me just double check this one. Yeah, I think I specifically said I don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s uh supermarket and that&#39;s a terrible business, but let me just double check. Uh yeah, I would never get into the grocery store business. I do think this one&#39;s going to be okay. Let me just double check the balance sheet and I think it&#39;s going to probably work for you. But I would I like that in airlines, you&#39;d really have to put a gun to my head and be like the last of five things I&#39;m allowed to buy for me to consider no matter how how good the numbers are. Like you could send me a million Chinese stocks if they&#39;re not named Alibaba or 10-centent. Like I&#39;m just not buying them. Um because the odds are against you in certain industries and certain countries. So you really have to have such a spectacular deal that you can make money if everything goes wrong. uh because in those areas it often does. So here I think the issue that you&#39;re going to have to deal with balance sheets a little leverage but it&#39;s not crazy. Um yeah let&#39;s see the margins margins are improving. I again I think you&#39;re okay if you understand the business. If you live in the UK and do that work, I think you&#39;re probably worth exploring it. That that just tends to be a garbage business. It reminds me of Tesco at Buffett got bagged in. Uh hi Tom, longtime listener. Thanks for all you do while I&#39;m kind of undervalued relative large cap. You think increasing influence abundance of private equity has structurally reshaped the p negative way. Best take in private. No, that&#39;s a load of It small caps are going to fly. Um, stop overthinking it. On to next. Marco Stalari. Uh, first question ever. Uh, about gold and the euro hunting. Hi, military ship builder nuclear carriers. Ah, hi. All right, let&#39;s take a look at that. Marco, I think you might be speaking my love language, my man. I think it&#39;s late, though. This thing&#39;s already up 60% off its lows. Uh, as a general view, no, I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s just turned negative free cash flow. stocks up, anticipating a turnaround that hasn&#39;t happened yet. Uh, this is the kind of stock I&#39;d love to see go back down to 160 or 150 and then just buy every share once I see a little turn turn in free cash flow, but there&#39;s no upside here. The fundamentals have gotten worse and the price has gone up. Not not interested yet, but I generally like the business, Marco, and congratulations on your first question. Thank you for your support, Liam Cook. Uh, thanks for all you do for the podcast. uh listener for six months. Wish I&#39;d have started listening earlier. Currently holding one small cap. Cooper Standard. Uh would you want more exposure in a portfolio? 12 stocks. Yeah, we have more. I mean uh Cooper Standard is a small cap. We have a little Canadian goose. We have um Comtock has been a big big run uh mover for us. Three or 4x already. That was a small cap. I don&#39;t know if it still is. I guess it still is. Uh that&#39;s more than enough small cap exposure. Um BF Corp is like a small to mid. Uh okay. Brandon, that&#39;s a new client. Want to become a new client. Uh Barrett, new client. Anton. Okay. Looking at buying gun dealers in healthc care, not the soldiers. Might want to look at GXI. Uh hard pass, huge negative free cash flow, margins declining. What is this thing do?

So, I started half position in QXO the end of April with the intention of adding to it over the coming months. Since then, it&#39;s up around 85% in less than two months. Obviously, not going to complain about that, but was only able to get a half position. What do you do when a position gets away from you before you can make a meaningful position? Uh, nothing. And number one, and usually I put the whole position on it at once or at least, you know, 80 90%. If it goes lower, I add more. If it goes higher, I have what I have and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t chase up. Uh, thank you for your great content invaluable as uh for growth as an investor. Well, you&#39;re welcome and good question. Uh, CK Patel, love your podcast.

Cash flows never recovered to peak. Revenues margins are kind of I mean what what&#39;s the motivation here? You want to write from 25 to 50? I I wouldn&#39;t chase that. I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great business. I don&#39;t think it has a great moat. I think it&#39;s like a fad that runs in cycles and eventually goes out of business. John Francis Porsche, you Porsche people. All right. Uh no, I I won&#39;t buy any OEMs no matter how cheap they are. uh even Ferrari which has done well. Okay, and that&#39;s it. We&#39;ll be back next week. Same time, same place.

Uh and then we can get on with growth and deregulation. We went from tariffs and wars to growth and deregulation. That&#39;s that&#39;s a very positive thing. Uh and then finally\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmore shelter disinflation likely in the pipeline. I think as rates go down, usually when you think of rates going down, prices go up. I think this is going to be the exact opposite this cycle. What&#39;s going to happen is a lot of homes are going to hit the market that have been trapped in 3% mortgages with millions of equity that are all going to hit the market at once and make homes more affordable. \n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nInternational value stocks are outperforming this year by a wide margin. Uh Iran&#39;s oil exports mostly go to China. It was interesting that Trump said that Iran can still export to China, wanting to get Iran to the table and wanting to get uh China&#39;s deal inked up. Real S&P 500 in index versus conflicts. You can see these conflicts over the last uh 150 years and how the S&P trends up over time. Weak US dollar environments create positive returns for financial markets and risky assets. What are the biggest beneficiaries when the dollar index falls 10%. Emerging markets, equity, we&#39;ve been talking about that for ages. Annual realized and bottom up consensus EPS growth estimates. What&#39;s going to be the biggest? Again, this continues to be updated. uh Russell by far 2025 18% earnings growth relative to the S&P of seven. Uh next year 37% earnings growth relative to the S&P of 14. Concentration of S&P market cap in earnings and the 10 largest inst index cont constituents. Uh 10 largest constituents make up 38% of the market cap but only 30% of the earnings and that amount of earnings is declining. This shows a cyclical uh move for the dollar over the last 50 years. It runs in about uh six or sevenyear cycles. You can see here we are at the top of the cycle and should be headed down for another three consecutive years for the US dollar. Defensive sectors influence at 35year low. Some of S&amp;P 500 defensive sector weights, consumer staples, energy, healthcare, and utilities. Make of this what you will, but we argue that a thematic rotation is a better route to defensive allocations. I would say this is pointing back to 2000 levels, 2001, which we&#39;ve covered a lot, which implies you want to start to get exposure to staples. We touched on it with Brad. Some of these defensive stocks like the Hormelas, like the Baxters, uh, in in healthcare, etc., like the Crown Castles, they are going to start to do well. that probably begins uh right now in the third quarter after earnings. Once you make new highs in the market and volatility starts in August, these defenses are going to start to spike up. Returns are highest when multiples are lowest, but otherwise matter little and that&#39;s where we are with our basket of stocks with low valuations and uh turning around massively. Rate cut expectations are now off the charts. I think it was 85% for September. for now and even 25% for July which is new. Lowest positioning in net non-commercial futures lowest positioning in 12 months to equities. So again that&#39;s not what you see at tops. I think we&#39;re going to push higher and just force maximum pain from all the l all the people who sold in the hole in April. Uh market implied US recession probability indicator is average. Uh foreign treasuries holdings may re remain near record. Everyone said they were going to sell all our treasuries. It&#39;s actually at a record high. 25 25 2025 total returns. US stocks 2.1%, international stocks 15.9. That&#39;s probably uh couple points now. I think US is up 4% and international is like 15. But we came into that with that minority view. Everyone said, you know, oh whatever. Gave me a lot of for it. Well, it&#39;s worked. Uh Charlie Bleello, US office to residential conversions are about to explode from a trickle today to a flood in 2027. Empty office towers to apartments, condos, hotels, future commercial real estate is going to look very different. Um you know, I pounded the hell out of the table two years ago for those of you who were real estate investors to buy office in San Francisco. And those guys have made an absolute killing like like insane money. I wish that was my game. Well, I don&#39;t wish that&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t have made as much money doing that, but you&#39;d if by real estate terms, you would have made a massive absolutely amount of money. So, um, so now I think if they&#39;re all converting to apartments, the the way to play it is buy BNC office and sit on your hands because eventually all the office is going to get spped up. Converted to a glut of apartments, those guys are going to lose and the ones that are left holding actual office are going to make a fortune. Onethird of baby boomers say they&#39;ll never sell. Good luck with that. The word never is usually right before they do. biggest inflow into energy. Once that once the supply hits the markets and price start getting bid and and hit the air pocket and they start to get fear of loss that all of their millions of equity that they work their whole life for are evaporating, they&#39;re all going to hit the market at once. Biggest inflow to energy funds since October 23. Short interest has risen in 2025 year to date. Uh so that that&#39;s more fuel. Shorts are the first buyers as we push to new highs. They&#39;re all going to be forced in. All the people waiting for the retest we&#39;ve talked about over the last week got absolutely monkey hammered. US household assets and liabilities total assets 179 trillion total liabilities 19. Everyone&#39;s balance sheet is good. Corporations people the only balance sheets that&#39;s bad is the US government. Equity ownership across wealth distribution 43% in the top 100 36% in the top sorry in the top 1% 36% in the so 10% own 79% of equities next 40% own 19% and the bottom 50% own 1% economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025 um what is this. Oh, K Schiller. Oh, home prices month. Yeah, a lot of markets starting to get hit, particularly Florida and Texas. That&#39;s usually where it starts. Market concentration is a global phenomenon. Top constituents by part market share. UK equities heavily weighted towards the top 10 stocks as well. Uh once a diverse index S&amp;P 500 is now around 50% growth weight of value growth plus fang mag 7 blend. Yeah, that&#39;s what you always see before reversals. It was the same thing in 1999. Dividend changes 5%. We&#39;ll skip that one. The high if higher in May and June, the rest of the year does very well. So when we&#39;ve seen conditions like this on average 12 months out up 14.8%. Uh USM2 money supply is now up 4 5% year on year. Slightly below the historical average growth rate but that&#39;s because we had such a big boom in 2000. But uh we&#39;ve talked about global M2 money supply which is now well at record highs. This is a critical chart here uh showing emerging markets just now breaking out of this long cup and handle which implies a measured move of at least uh 12 points. So 59 for starters. And then at that point, you&#39;re breaking out to new all-time highs and you get a bigger cup and you&#39;re looking more like uh move from 32 to 60 28 plus 60 you&#39;re looking at a move to 88. We&#39;re at 47. So a basic double uh if you have a little patience with emerging markets over the next couple few years. Summer rally could should continue. We agree. Major cities with declining home price growth 35%. It&#39;s happening. We told you. And it&#39;s it&#39;s going to continue. Uh it&#39;s going to be just the exact opposite. Once they cut rates, prices are actually going to come down. Uh just a supply dump all at once.\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nMagnificent 7 or Magnificent me. Uh you can see even now with all this huge rally year to date, you still have these majors that are down materially like Google, Amazon, Tesla, Apple. Uh Magnificent 7 is still flat. Maybe this week it it just went barely positive 1% 2% but um that&#39;s it back to the top of the range at probably another couple weeks of push through suck everyone in and then they&#39;ll they&#39;ll be weak again in the fall. US new single family homes month supply. So supply is going up. Uh all we need is rates coming down and the game is on. Institutional clients net buying of tech. So they&#39;re all chasing up now. uh they&#39;ll get monkey hammered in the fall. US stock valuations at a 75-y year high to the relative to the rest of the world. You want to have international exposure and you want to have it quickly. We haven&#39;t seen anything like that since when? Since 20201, which we&#39;ve covered what what outperformed next international small caps and value. What&#39;s not in this excess right",
    "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\nThat&#39;s me in front of Fox. That is on set at the Big Money Show, Jackie D&#39;Angelus. Uh that is Charlie Gasparino, Cheryl Cassone, of course. That&#39;s in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Never gets old. That&#39;s in front of the CNBC booth. Uh that&#39;s with Brad Smith over at Yahoo. Uh had a fun time there. This is the control booth where they produce while it&#39;s going on live. Uh that&#39;s with Josh Lipton, one of the hosts at Yahoo. Uh that&#39;s also in front of the studio there at Yahoo. That&#39;s on set with Stuart Vney and John Castamus Titis. He&#39;s a billionaire uh oil guy and uh supermarket guy in New York City. You know, Gristitis uh outside Fox again. And finally\n\nthe market still looking favorably on the ceasefire deal and its continuation. Dow up to 280, NASDAQ up 211. Oil price down again this morning. Last time we checked it was $66 a barrel. That&#39;s a help to inflation down the road. This is the major component to inflation. And the Saudis are going to continue to pump. They don&#39;t want sanctions. They want to be helpful. The Russians are going to continue to pump. They need income. Oil is going to stay down. Everyone was all up in arms about the Straits of Hormuz. It&#39;s never been shut down in all of these different battles, the Gulf War, etc. It&#39;s never been shut down. Oil&#39;s going to stay low. Inflation&#39;s going to stay low. Powell is going to have to move because the natives are getting restless. Wallers&#39;s come out, Goulsby&#39;s come out, Bowman&#39;s come out, everyone&#39;s come out saying, listen, this is a temporary tax if anything. It&#39;s even in their summary of economic projections that it&#39;s going to be temporary. And by the same same token, their projections 1.4% 4% real GDP. If if GDP is going to be that low, he should have done 50 basis points in June. He&#39;s got to go. He&#39;s going to try to push it off to September, and that&#39;ll probably be okay. But now you got more and more people coming out. Maybe we get a surprise in July. How low could the price of oil go? Can you get back into the 50s? And will American drillers drill and pump if it&#39;s in the $50 barrel range? At 50 it&#39;s a little tougher for them to pump aggressively with rates at this rate. Uh if rates start to come down, we could see some pumping in the 50s for sure. And that would keep oil low for a long time. But Powell&#39;s got to move. If we get the big beautiful tax break, okay, if we get that, if we get a rate cut by the Federal Reserve, if we get the ceasefire holding in the Middle East, does the market rally significantly? We are going to new highs. We&#39;re going to new highs this summer, probably before August. Institutional sentiment is at near COVID lows still. With markets near near-time highs, institutional sentiment, you saw from Bank of America and the fund manager survey, uh, near great financial crisis lows. The markets climb a wall of worry. These people are going to be forced in. We&#39;re going to get new highs in July. All of the energy stocks are down. We&#39;re at $65 a barrel for oil. The oil companies were up a little bit yesterday because look, they could all make money at 50 55 for break even. So when oil&#39;s at 80, great. Now that oil is back to $65 a barrel, a little bit less profitable for them to pump. So again, they fall along with the price of oil. You could get oil below 60 bucks a barrel. If rates come down, it becomes more and more profitable for them to pump at lower levels. But until, you know, Chair Powell has been a little bit belligerent, you know, the natives are saying, &quot;Let&#39;s cut into July.&quot; And he says, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; Let&#39;s have a look at the defense stocks, too. I believe they&#39;re mostly down, but that&#39;s because of the ceasefire. We talked yesterday about traditional defense that was up as we were waiting for the escalation and then traditional defense that is down as we&#39;ve sort of gotten the deescalation. Also, don&#39;t forget cyber security defense as well is another uh role in this. Bitcoin&#39;s back to 105,000 bucks of coin. We&#39;re close to a record, right? Like 110 112 is a record. This is a classic risk on, right? This is a market trying to figure out do we like gold? Do we like dollar? Do we like Bitcoin? How does Bitcoin fit in a portfolio if it&#39;s risk on? Dow&#39;s up 300. Fiser now they&#39;re a fintech financial technology company. They&#39;re partnering with Mastercard to adopt stable coin. FIUSD is the Fiser&#39;s token and they want to have it all across Mastercard products. So they want to allow customers to smoothly transition from fiat currencies to the stable coin. They want merchants to also get paid if they wish in this stable coin instead of a dollar or fiat. Basically saying that they want stable coins to be ubiquous across continents and across currencies. So that they think the stable coin again is this new okay currency if you will. I thought the stable coin was bad for Mastercard and Visa. It&#39;s an uncertain period. Here&#39;s how I would hedge it. I gave your audience a stock called PayPal in the in the high50s. It&#39;s now in the low7s. They are the sixth largest issuer of stable coins. So if you like the fee business, PayPal&#39;s got 450 million users. If you like the stable coin business, they&#39;re the sixth largest issuer. That&#39;s the way to kind of hedge your risk until we get more clarity of how this is going to play out for Visa and Mastercard. I would not be a buyer of Visa or Mastercard here. Uber and Whimo. They&#39;ve launched their robo taxi service in Atlanta. Elon Musk puts a couple cars on the road in Austin with drivers in the autonomous cars. He gets tens of billions of dollars of e equity cap value. Whimo&#39;s been going for years. Google gets zero value for Whimo and Google stock. Microsoft just hit an all-time high and we got some more drama between Microsoft and Open AI.\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And",

Uh and then we can get on with growth and deregulation. We went from tariffs and wars to growth and deregulation. That&#39;s that&#39;s a very positive thing. Uh and then\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nThey maintain their buy rating on this stock here.

And\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfinally  here, McCormack beating expectations for its second quarter. McCormack also reiterated its full year 2025 guidance with the company&#39;s CEO saying they have quote robust plans to mitigate current tariff related costs. That&#39;s despite several potential headwinds for the consumer staple market, including dietary changes, trade uncertainty, and inflation. You&#39;re taking a look at shares of McCormack higher by about 5.3% on the back of these results. We were talking in the break about how much I take pride in in my own seasonings and the cooking of the proteins necessarily. Uh you got to have a little flavor in there. Yeah, there&#39;s no question about it. And I&#39;m looking at, you know, I look at sectors, they call me turnaround time, I like to buy businesses that are out of favor. I&#39;m looking at consumer staples and defensives and I&#39;m you&#39;re seeing a lot in that group, whether it&#39;s Craft Hind, there was some recent news out Mills, Hormeell. Uh these are all kind of left for dead stock. So, you know, you seeing McCormick&#39;s earnings, this might be a preview of coming attractions for some of those that have kind of been uh uh unfavored of late or unseasoned of late. Uh and uh maybe coming through this earning season, they they start to get interesting, particularly when volatility picks up in the fall and money moves a little bit more defensively. So, keep your eye on consumer staples, uh packaged products and and the like. If it wasn&#39;t so hot outside, I&#39;d be ready to go outside in season with some McCormick, but it&#39;s pretty uh it&#39;s pretty toasty, so I don&#39;t need to be by the grill. Thomas, stick around. We&#39;ve got more here. You can scan the QR code below to track the best and worst performing stocks with Yahoo Finance&#39;s trending tickers page. All your markets action straight ahead. Stay tuned. You&#39;re watching Market Catalyst into the conversation because you did not mince words on the Fed&#39;s role within this earlier. So given what we&#39;re seeing transpire within the housing market right now, to what extent is that the Fed, to what extent is that also just a byproduct of people needing to figure out, okay, how much home can they afford? The the affordability issue and then the number of people that are also just still sitting on their homes because they got locked in at very good rates. Well, that&#39;s the problem. I mean, you run rates 200 basis points above inflation, you have unintended consequences. Number one, unaffordability for the 72 millennials who want to start a family. And number two is all these baby boomers that want to get out of their equity, but they&#39;re not going to sell a $2 million house, take out a million dollar equity, and then go into a 7% mortgage when they&#39;re in a 3% mortgage. So, I think the name of the game this summer is that the SLR is going to bring down the 10-year Treasury, 30 to 70 basis points. You&#39;re going to see 30-year fixed rate go below 6%. And at that level, I think you&#39;re going to see a huge amount of inventory. And then you look at the home builders, okay, who wants to risk capital building massive amounts of starter homes at 7% and have them sit in inventory? They can&#39;t make the investment and and this is the unintended consequence of one guy trying to protect his legacy and not be Arthur Burns. And the conditions of the economy are not and the demographics are nothing like they were in the 70s. Uh so they&#39;ve got to move and if they don&#39;t move, we&#39;re going to get a shadow Fed and that&#39;s going to move the market and he can just sit in the desk for seven months until he leaves. I mean, it&#39;s not fun being Fed Chair Jerome Pal because you are the face of the decisions that a body of people and Fed governors make within that committee. You know what, in fairness, you had autopilot in December 2018. You remember that crashed the S&amp;P 20% until Minutian came in and fixed it. You had transitory. So, listen, I mean, his legacy is his legacy. He&#39;s got a chance to do it right and go out a winner like Seinfeld. And he&#39;s missing the boat. So, he&#39;s got July. Let&#39;s see what happens in the next few weeks and he can be an absolute champion and help 72 million millennials get their families started and get in new houses, help the home builders. And by the way, it&#39;s 16 housing is 16.2% of GDP. You know how many jobs that creates that are being held up by this artificially restrictive environment. Claire, last word goes to you. What does this mean for the homebuilders? What are we hearing on the stronger Treasury auctions that took place the week prior to that as well? So what is the the larger implications that traders and investors are thinking through in their mindset? The most important thing\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ncharts from Torsten Slok, chief economist, saying private equity as a percentage of public equity market 2003 3.8% 2024 8.8%.

I think that&#39;s the only defense stock that&#39;s up and you&#39;re going to tell me why it&#39;s up. Yeah, no question. We gave it to your audience, by the way, a couple months ago at 135 when no one wanted it. It&#39;s up at 203. But there were these multi-tonon bombs that were dropped and decimated Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions over the weekend. Boeing makes those bunker bunker buster bombs. They make the GPU 57. That&#39;s absolutely right. 30,000. Yeah. And did they work or not? They they work like nobody&#39;s business. And Boeing&#39;s back to 200 bucks a share. All right.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nSo, with all this data and the S&amp;P 500 within striking distance of an all-time high, I do want to bring in Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair and managing member at Greyhill Capital. Thomas, welcome. Thanks for having me, Kristen. Great to have you on the show. I think last time you were here, we had seen a lot of volatility in the markets. You were bullish. Are you bullish today? We continue to be bullish. We we have some tailwinds here, Kristen. First off, the ceasefire. I mean, Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions were completely decimated over the weekend. Uh Boeing bunker bombs absolutely decimated the the the the sites. Uh then you&#39;ve got the big beautiful tax bill. Donald Trump, President Trump says no vacations until we get it done. That&#39;s going to be very very constructive in terms of tax cuts. Uh and then we can get on with growth and deregulation. We went from tariffs and wars to growth and deregulation. That&#39;s that&#39;s a very positive thing. Uh and then\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there.

Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And\n\nthe tax cuts. Okay. So we&#39;ve gone from bombing and tariffs to growth and deregulation. And growth is a function of the tax cuts uh as Brett is alluding to. It&#39;s a little bit stimulative here and and you can kind of talk a little bit more about that in in detail. I would just say uh so that&#39;s critical. So, you know, if tax rates were to go up, uh it&#39;s going to impact earnings. It&#39;s going to have a negative impact on the economy, hiring growth, the whole thing. So, that&#39;s not going to happen. We&#39;ve got uh the Treasury doing what they&#39;re doing with the SLR. We&#39;ve got the tax cuts coming in and animal spirits coming back because man management can plan. They can start to forecast, kind of understand the rules, whereas the first half of the year, everyone was uncertain. So, uh, Brett, how do you handicap this get getting done by July 4th or no vacation, no one goes home locking them in a room? You&#39;ve been through this process many times. Does this look any different or is this just the normal back and forth and eventually they get something done? Yeah, I mean, it does look like the normal process of back and forth. Um it&#39;s just that they are the the next Fed chair could be might look like in terms of commentary that we could hear hear from that person and a and almost shadow fed because that person wouldn&#39;t be going in until May 2026, but we&#39;d get more inclination through what they&#39;re willing to talk about openly and publicly and policy could be one of those one of those areas where the Fed typically will not comment on that and try to be apolitical. yet you would have someone who would be put forward in their name and have pretty much open season to say whatever they want leading up to that point. I I think it&#39;s less what they say and more who they are. So, you know, if Hassid&#39;s the guy, I I think the market starts to discount that pretty darn quick and that&#39;s going to have long-term implications in terms of refinancing the debt, the cost of the debt, etc. Uh but I have one last question for you, Brett. What what what do you think as the bill stands right now? uh what do you think that adds or detracts from GDP in the short term over the next 12 months if it went through today as is incremental benefit or uh drag? Yeah, it would be about about 40 basis points positive. Wow. Um you know depending on how where you put some of the scoring um but yeah on on a from a deficit from fiscal impulse perspective 30 to 40 basis points positive for sure relative to trend. And so, you know, that&#39;s if trend is the Fed&#39;s trend is 18, you know, you&#39;re looking at 2-1. Our forecast is around 2% next year. Um, but again, a lot remains to be be seen. Fed chair, that&#39;s a whole different uh whole different whole different that&#39;s another hour. I think the the next one the next Fed chair, you know, you have to be careful as as you alluded to. You know, if if the market loses confidence that the Fed is independent, then your long end is going to is going to be a serious problem and it doesn&#39;t matter what how much you cut in the front end. Brethren, thanks so much for taking the time here. Joining us in studio, Thomas, thanks for staying with us for the conversation as well. You stick around, we&#39;ve got much more ahead.### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nThe brands that they own. I mean, this is a company we&#39;re talking about that not only has the swoosh, they also have, of course, as you were mentioning this new partnership with SKIMS. They&#39;ve been leading into some of those collaborations. And then additionally, they&#39;ve got Jordan Brand, which they&#39;ve leaned into. Oh yeah, don&#39;t forget Converse as well, where they just had one of their stars win the NBA Finals. So, all of these things considered here, they&#39;ve got different levers that they can pull. And my goodness, I don&#39;t know if you had the the Air Jordan 1&#39;s when they first came out, Thomas, but uh they&#39;re about to hit Jordan 40 right now, which is my Listen, the most important thing they&#39;ve got is Scotty Sheffler. You know it, I know it, everyone knows it. I love a great turnaround story. You know, you were going through all those negative points, Brooke, and all the analysts are so negative in the whole uh you know, trying to get past this. Yeah, it reminds me of other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln? But I love when when the market&#39;s so pessimistic. They did screw their their wholesalers to say it. They&#39;ve got to rebuild those relationships. They&#39;re going to uh you know, my nickname on the street is turnaround Tom. I would love to buy a lot of Nike. I should be buying a lot of Nike at these levels. I really hope it goes down a lot after earnings and maybe that&#39;ll be a new position, but um you know, I&#39;m betting on another turnaround specialist, Bracken Daryl, over at VF Corp. He&#39;s got his work cut out for him. He&#39;s going to turn that business. So, I I don&#39;t know if I want to be overexposed, but man, fresh capital. Uh if this thing is lower, I&#39;d probably be inclined to buy it with a 3 to 5 year view. Are you talking about a low below what we&#39;ve already seen? I think they struck 52 earlier. Yeah, I&#39;d love to see it approach that level. If it did, I&#39; I&#39;d be inclined like at some point you got to stop watching and step into the ring. Uh you look through I think the turnaround is going to be slower than the optimists think, but I think it&#39;s going to be certain. This is a this is a company of winners. They they they hire the best. They get the best athletes using their stuff. They got to get back to winning, and they will get back to winning, and they&#39;ve got to rebuild those relationships. So maybe we&#39;ll see some signs of that tonight. Uh I don&#39;t I don&#39;t anticipate it&#39;s going to flush out to the level that that would attract me. it probably we&#39;re at the stage where you&#39;re going to see some good news would be my expectation because expectations are so darn low. Yeah. And I do want to point out I still have Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member with me here. And as we&#39;re taking a look at shares of Black Rockck, they&#39;re up by about 1% here on the day. Is this really expected to move the dial longer term here? Why does it make sense for Black Rockck to do this? Yeah, I I think they&#39;re doing it because they can. Okay, it&#39;s a huge market. the idea is to democratize private equity. But you see they follow the trends. You know, first Larry Frink said uh Bitcoin was no good and then the thing took off and then he started offering it to the public with the ETFs etc. So I I do think that there&#39;s going to be a place this is going to be promoted by a lot of uh financial advisors. This is going to be a part of the portfolio. The beauty of private equity and private credit which have become so popular is that you have uh no marktomarket. So, it&#39;s perceived low volatility because they mark the assets what what we used to say during the great financial crisis, marked to make believe or mark to whatever. And you never really see a mark until the asset is worth zero until it&#39;s fully marked down. So, in a in a bull market like this, everything&#39;s marked up. Everyone&#39;s happy. There&#39;s no volatility. You don&#39;t see that daily volatility. Retail loves that. Institutions, institutional consultants love not having the volatility. They love their sharp ratios when they come in the 25-year-old with their clipboard. uh uh but when you take the marks the marks are big. So I I think there&#39;s going to be a place for this in in a lot of 401ks and and for a lot of retail investors are going to try their hand but as you move into a recessionary type of period these are the assets that you want to be careful of. Yeah I was taking a look at one of the\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAnd I do want to point out I still have Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member with me here.

That's some of the growth here that we've seen.\n\nActive strategies gaining over during select major draw down. US accounts for a quarter of global GDP but 2/3 of the MCI world index. That&#39;s a type of divergence that you can get rich on. think you know pause this listen again look at the table and figure it out. \n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNext chart, monetary aggregates M1 leads 12 months. China and uh nominal GDP. You can see Chinese money supply has been going straight up in the last 6 months. GDP will follow a big year for apartment buildings in big buildings. US multif family units completed by units per building. So offices are converting into apartments. Uh multif family units, rearview mirror, everyone looks in the rearview mirror. There&#39;s going to be a glut of apartments. Uh, that&#39;s not where you want to be. You want to be probably an office that no one wants in my opinion. World gas demand rises to a record. Uh, God love you. Comtock resources and range resources. Uh, there we go. Cumulative utility scale better. So, that&#39;s going to continue with the whole AI stuff. US continuing claims going way up. Apparently, Powell&#39;s not looking at this data. He&#39;s too busy predicting other data with his crystal ball that&#39;s worked so well. Autopilot and transitory box office growth year to date through June 26th. Uh it&#39;s actually cooking. And you know who&#39;s benefiting from that more than anyone else? Disney, baby. How do you like them apples? The media distributor gauge you Walt Disney Company is kicking ass 11.4% 4% in May over YouTube over NBC Universal over Paramount over Netflix. Uh Neielson&#39;s aggregated view of total usage by media company. Disney baby number one. How do you like them apples? Zero credit attributed to the stock. It&#39;s just getting started. China building a mega-sized consumer economy. Premiere says they&#39;re doing more consumer stimulus. We&#39;ll talk about that. uh six agencies announced financial support to boost and expand consumption in China. This was published this morning from Brendan Ahern uh over at uh Kb ETF. uh quote 19 measures to quote combine the implementation of the strategy of expanding domestic demand with deepening the structural reform of the financial supply side, increase the investment in financial resources provided by consumption and improve the level of financial services for consumer demand. Is China going through a consumption res revival? Its 618 festival is one sign of it.

As you can see here, cash flow is starting to recover, but it&#39;s still iffy. Margins are starting to recover. That&#39;s actually real. A lot of good things beginning to happen. Key thing here, which Jeff wasn&#39;t able to circle, is you can see that over the past decade, the return on invested capital has been in the high teens to low 20s consistently until uh 2023. And this is coincident with the drop off in sales in China from 2021 to 2024. those are starting to recover. I think we&#39;re going to see a quicker recovery because it&#39;s not baked into the outlook uh the China recovery. The beauty is during the draw down is that they did not lose much share in China. They kept about 99% of the share that they had. They have number one uh share globally for premium skincare and cosmetics. That&#39;s not going to change. And for those of you who don&#39;t know, they cover a lot of brands. It&#39;s not just Estee Lauder. It&#39;s MAC. It&#39;s Clinique. It&#39;s Dr. Jart for the young kids love the Korean stuff. Um, it&#39;s Aveda. It&#39;s uh, it&#39;s more than you know. And they&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for 75 plus years, and they&#39;ll continue to do that. Similar to VF Corp, similar to Dagio. Last month, we put out a quick update following Estee Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings, but had not yet published a full deep dive. After falling below $50 a share at the April lows, the stock has been on a tear, rallying more than 50% off the bottom. Just this week, Deutsche Bank turned bullish on the turnaround story and issued a street high price of $95. We thought now would be a good time to revisit the name. Estee Lauder founded in 1946, is the global leader in premium beauty products with a portfolio of over 20 best-in-class iconic brands. Estee Lauder is basically to make up what and beauty what Diagio is to alcohol. Both are about as premium as it gets. The stock was never a huge position for us like Alibaba. It is largely a bet on the recovery of the Chinese middle class. And just like poker, we prefer positions with plenty of outs and few offer more outs than Baba. So while Estee Lauder may not be the everything business that Alibaba is, it still offers what we believe is a highly attractive riskreward setup. SA Lauder&#39;s roller coaster story over the past few years goes like this. When their prior CEO Fabriio Freda took the helm in 2009, his top priority was international expansion, aiming to generate over 60% of overall sales from international markets. That bet proved highly successful over the next decade, but also opened the door to significant overexposure to certain markets, especially China and travel retail. From fiscal year 2018 to 2021, China&#39;s share of total revenue jumped from just 13% to 36%. At one point, a single customer in China was responsible for 42% of the region sales. Management clearly bit off uh more than they could chew. And when the music stopped in 2022, Estee Lauder paid the price. Shares fell from nearly $375 to below $50 this past April, effectively wiping out more than a decade of gains. Now, this is exactly the kind of situation that earned me the nickname Turnaround Tom. As Buffett says, great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. That is the guiding light of our entire company at Great Hill Capital. That is the theme of everything we do is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. We benefit from that misappraisal. This could not be a more accurate description of Estee Lauder. At the end of the day, this is a company that is as high quality and durable as they come, working its way of a once in a hundredyear event, yet priced as if it is in permanent decline, and people will never spend money on makeup again. Oh, and by the way, it&#39;s kind of the reverse GLP. As people lose weight, they buy more makeup, not less. We are more than happy to take the other side of that trade, and that&#39;s because we see the bulk of it, Estee Lauder&#39;s challenges as cyclical, not structural, with all signs pointing to a bottoming and nearterm recovery. The name of the game with Estee Lauder turnaround is margin expansion. Gross margins fell nearly 500 basis points, peaked to trough, bottoming in fiscal year 2024 at 71.7% as management worked through excess inventories and write-offs. The good news is the gross margins have now posted three consecutive quarters of 300 basis point gains with current guidance calling for 73.5% for fiscal year 2025 and an expected return to the historical mid70s range by fiscal year 2027. Operating margins are where the crux of the turnaround really is. SA Lauder has historically delivered mid to high teen EBIT margins but in 2024 these bottomed out at just over 10%. Management is working to restore EBIT margins to a solid double-digit level over the next few years. And the with the profit recovery growth plan expected to generate 800 million to a billion in annual growth savings and the full run rate benefits anticipated by fiscal year 2027. Green shoots across the businesses continue to point toward a return to growth in 2026, which will allow operating leverage to really kick in and get SA Ladder back to making more money than they know what to do with. At the same time, you have a new CEO who is a proven winner in the industry, a push into higher margin digital channels like Amazon and Tik Tok and China working its way towards becoming a mega-sized consumption economy. We think over the next few years this is a double from current levels. Until then, we are happy to sit on our hands and wait. Now, here&#39;s an in-depth breakdown of Estee Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings. Uh, as the CEO said, quote, &quot;Return to sales growth in fiscal 2026.&quot; You should go through this line by line. We&#39;ve outlined the gross margin expansion expanded 310 basis points to 75% uh in the quarter. Uh achieved prestige beauty share gains for fiscal 2025. By the way, 10 years ago, prestige was 33% of all uh category purchases. Now it&#39;s 40%. This is a huge play on the emerging market middle class expansion. Um, they&#39;ll be one of the pure beneficiaries. On trend, commercial invocations, 10 new freestanding stores, Tik Tok shop. Okay, all this stuff you can look at. Let&#39;s just scroll down for now to the 10 key points. can see the improvement in China. All right, 10 key points. Number one, after sales declined 10% in fiscal year 2023 and 2% in 2024 and with guidance calling for another 8 to 9% in fiscal 2025, management remains confident in a return to growth by fiscal year 2026. Gross margins bottomed in fiscal year 2024 at 71.7 below the 5-year average of approximately 74, but have rebounded for three consecutive quarters with gains of over 300 basis points. Fiscal year 2025 guidance calls for 73.5% and management continues to target a return to the historical mid70s by fiscal year 2027. Three, management also remains confident in restoring operating margins to solid double digits over the next few years as a return to sales growth allows operating leverage to kick in. Margins bottomed in fiscal year 2024 at just over 10% well below the company&#39;s historical mid to high teens EBIT levels. Green shoots are emerging across the businesses with market share gains showing up in the US, China and Japan. In the US Q3 marked the first quarter in years with share gains driven by growth in three of four categories skincare, makeup and hair and 10 brands that held or gained shared led by Clinique which has now posted 11 consecutive quarters of gains in China. Estee Lauder gained share across all four brand categories and eight brands, making it the third quarter of share gains in the last four. And Japan Q3 marked the fourth straight quarter of market share growth. Tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on fiscal year 2025 profitability. Estee Lauder has the lowest exposure in the industry thanks to its nine manufacturing sites worldwide. Over 75% of what is sold in the US is sourced from the US or Canada and is protected on the USMCA agreement. 25% of what is sold in China is currently sourced from the US. But management aims to reduce this to less than 10% and has already mitigated north of 40% of the initial tariff impacts. Travel retail which is at its peak accounted for mid to high 20% of total sales thanks to shrink in in the low teens as a share of sales. Management is intentionally diversifying away from volatile travel retail significantly reducing inventories and de-risisking the segment outside of travel retail which declined 28% in Q3 and is expected to see another steep drop in Q4. Estee Lauder delivered sequential acceleration in global retail sales growth. Seven management remains on track with the expanded profit recovery growth plan PRGP which is expected to generate 800 million to a billion in annual growth savings with full run rate benefits anticipated by 2027. As of Q3, management has approved initiatives to eliminate over 2600 net positions with 85% expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and has already reduced middle management roles by 20% year-over-year. Aid Estee Ladder continues to lean into higher growth, higher margin digital channels with online organic sales up mid single digits in Q3. This includes 12 brands now available through Amazon prem premium beauty stores as well as momentum on Tik Tok shop helping digital channels reach 28% of total sales in 2024. That&#39;s up from just 13% in 2018. At the same time, exposure to department stores has been significantly reduced as a share of overall sales. Nine capital expenditures totaled 395 million, 3.62% 62% of sales in the 9 months ended Q3 down 44% from 72 million in the prior year period. Construction of the new factory in Japan had pushed capex as a percentage of sales to around 6% in recent years above the historical average of 4 to 5%. But spending is now expected to remain lower as management shifts focus to higher return on invested capital projects and allocate capex towards consumerf facing initiatives rather than capacity and capabilities. 10. In the first few weeks of Q4, management has continued to see strong retail momentum in the US, even stronger trends in China and positive momentum in UK across other emerging mark and across other emerging markets. Uh here&#39;s the earnings call transcript. You can go through the green highlights we put here at hedge funips.com. Just scroll down to popular post. It&#39;ll probably be the number one or two most popular post for the next 24 hours. Uh you can see the\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nHere's an article from Morning Star. Estee Lauder is rise to ride poised to ride the beauty premiumization tailwinds. Very similar story to Diagio leader in uh products scale cost advantage blah blah blah 20 years middle class consumers global upgrade from mass brand shorter lead time digital platforms. Uh bottom line is they talk about ample liquidity and they talk about a price target of $125 fair value currently trading at 75 up from 50. So um we like that story or that take.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nTechnology estimates, earnings, estimates, and revisions. Top 30 weights last 60 days up 1.31% this year, up 64 basis points for next year. Consumer services, uh, communication services, same story, up 1.59 for this year, up 1.75 for next. So, we're past that period a year where they take down guidance. Now, they're starting to take it back up. Um, economic data, again, same stuff we've covered about employment, about uh, housing, etc.",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\nthe name of the game this summer is that the SLR is going to bring down the 10-year Treasury, 30 to 70 basis points. You&#39;re going to see 30-year fixed rate go below 6%. And at that level, I think you&#39;re going to see a huge amount of inventory. And then you look at the home builders, okay, who wants to risk capital building massive amounts of starter homes at 7% and have them sit in inventory? They can&#39;t make the investment and and this is the unintended consequence of one guy trying to protect his legacy. The conditions of the economy are not and the demographics are nothing like they were in the 70s. So, they&#39;ve got to move and if they don&#39;t move, we&#39;re going to get a shadow Fed and that&#39;s going to move the market. You had autopilot in December 2018. You remember that crashed the S&P 20% until Minutian came in and fixed it. You had transitory. So, listen, I mean, his legacy is his legacy. He&#39;s got a chance to do it right and go out a winner. He&#39;s missing the boat. So, he&#39;s got July. Let&#39;s see what happens in the next few weeks and he can be an absolute champion and help 72 million millennials get their families started and get in new houses, help the home builders. And by the way, it&#39;s 16 housing is 16.2% of GDP. You know how many jobs that creates that are being held up by this artificially restrictive environment.\n\nguess who is on CNBC this morning is Alex Chris from PayPal. They teamed up with the Big 10 and Big 12 to enable payments to student athletes. We&#39;re going to listen in now. Are there exactly 22 teams? Is that more? It&#39;s like the S&amp;P 500. to enable college athletic departments to pay their student athletes directly through the financial platform. Uh this comes after the landmark June6 court ruling that allows schools to directly compensate uh student athletes starting on July 4th or July 1st. Joining us now to make the announcement first on CNBC PayPal CEO Alex Chris uh and Big 12 Commissioner uh Brent Yormack and Venmo&#39;s involved. \n### MISCELLANEOUS\nUm they&#39;re already culturally relevant and connecting with that demographic. So, that was ideal for us. Um, but it&#39;s a very strategic partnership and I think you&#39;re going to see us do more and more things like this where campuses and the conference come together and provide great brands with solutions like we have here with PayPal and uh you&#39;re probably psyched. You&#39;ll get everybody. Who else who else would uh would compete with you with with other colleges? Well, look, we we will we are the best way to distribute the funds. And what&#39;s important is you need to have the wallet that the college students are using.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquestions  we had was, can you grow Venmo? And you know, you&#39;re starting to see it now in in the results. We grew revenue over 20% last quarter. We&#39;ve got our pay with Venmo up 50%, our debit card up 40%. And partnerships like this just enable us to to reach our customers. I&#39;ve been with PayPal for a very long time. I got Vimmo too. Now every time I go to pay with um PayPal, it asks me if I want to do the pay now pay later option instead of just paying right you know I now pay later instead of just paying now for everything. How much of your business is that? That new kind of idea of get it now pay for it later. Yeah. Look, and it&#39;s connected to to the younger demographic. We are finding more and more college students and younger demographic wanting to pay with debit and buy now pay later as their credit option. And so our pay later, buy now pay later uh product is growing very quickly. Uh and it&#39;s becoming we grew 20% over 20% last quarter in buy now pay later. And so uh it&#39;s becoming the way that people want to spend. They don&#39;t want credit cards as as often. They want debit and buy now pay later.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nand they can come to. And we&#39;re back. And quote of the week, Charlie Munger, a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they&#39;ve got terrible temperaments. Uh, cool is the name of the game. Patience buy high quality businesses when they&#39;re temporarily marked down and sit on your hands or go play golf. The secret to success is to do the unc to do the common thing uncommonly well. Everyone invests. Very few people do it well because they&#39;re always chasing the shiny object. They&#39;re always sucked into the action, always chasing headline stocks, following the herd, and eventually leading to slaughter.\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nrate but that&#39;s because we had such a big boom in 2000. But uh we&#39;ve talked about global M2 money supply which is now well at record highs. This is a critical chart here uh showing emerging markets just now breaking out of this long cup and handle which implies a measured move of at least uh 12 points. So 59 for starters. And then at that point, you&#39;re breaking out to new all-time highs and you get a bigger cup and you&#39;re looking more like uh move from 32 to 60 28 plus 60 you&#39;re looking at a move to 88. We&#39;re at 47. So a basic double uh if you have a little patience with emerging markets over the next couple few years. Summer rally could should continue. We agree. Major cities with declining home price growth 35%. It&#39;s happening. We told you. And it&#39;s it&#39;s going to continue. Uh it&#39;s going to be just the exact opposite. Once they cut rates, prices are actually going to come down. Uh just a supply dump all at once.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nMagnificent 7 or Magnificent me. Uh you can see even now with all this huge rally year to date, you still have these majors that are down materially like Google, Amazon, Tesla, Apple. Uh Magnificent 7 is still flat. Maybe this week it it just went barely positive 1% 2% but um that&#39;s it back to the top of the range at probably another couple weeks of push through suck everyone in and then they&#39;ll they&#39;ll be weak again in the fall. US new single family homes month supply. So supply is going up. Uh all we need is rates coming down and the game is on. Institutional clients net buying of tech. So they&#39;re all chasing up now. uh they&#39;ll get monkey hammered in the fall. US stock valuations at a 75-y year high to the relative to the rest of the world. You want to have international exposure and you want to have it quickly. We haven&#39;t seen anything like that since when? Since 20201, which we&#39;ve covered what what outperformed next international small caps and value. What&#39;s not in this excess right\n\nEstee Lauder delivered sequential acceleration in global retail sales growth.

Uh, seems like a company that's been pretty nimble over the years in adjusting to environments. Um, balance sheet. Let's take a look. Million dollar cash. Good statement. had some big growth. They must have done an acquisition good. Balance sheet generally looks okay. I mean it's generating a return on capital that's probably I don't know if we have weighted average cost of capital here. No. probably below its cost of capital. Yeah, look, I think this one is definitely definitely warrants doing some work. I mean, it's just going to be really understanding what is the competitive mode on all the businesses that they're doing. Why is the stock down so much? Uh, and um uh what's the turnaround story?

    "### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nthe natives are getting restless. You&#39;ve seen three dissenters come out against Chair Powell, with Bowman, with Goulsby, uh, and with Waller. And I think you&#39;re going to see more to follow. And, and I think the reason is very simple. Uh, you and I are paying an extra $600 billion a year in interest payments, which is entirely unnecessary with inflation where it is. Uh and 72 million millennials who are desperately trying to start their lives in family formation can&#39;t afford a home largely because of one man focused on his legacy worried about becoming Arthur Burns and the conditions of the economy and the population are nothing like the the period that Arthur Burns was in power as Fed chair. So these are the three key tailwinds and we you&#39;re referencing there Jerome Powell obviously the head of the Federal Reserve driving the path forward for interest rates. He has said multiple times Thomas that he wants to take this wait and see approach that he does anticipate that inflation will rise due to tariffs. So what is your response to that if in fact inflation does rise in the months ahead? Look it&#39;s very easy if if his predict look the Fed mandate they&#39;re supposed to be data dependent. He is now prediction dependent. Jay Powell is so certain that inflation is going to rise. But if you look at his summary of economic pro projections, he acknowledges it&#39;s a temporary bump. It&#39;s like a one-time tax. Also, if you look at his predictions, he&#39;s showing real GDP at 1.4%. If he believes in his own predict predictions, he should have cut 50 basis points in June. So, you can&#39;t have it both ways. I think this is uh one of the first times in history we&#39;re seeing the Fed being prediction dependent versus data dependent and that&#39;s a risk and I think the pressure is on because you know if you look at the average age of a person buying their starter home it&#39;s been pushed back you know five some odd years because he got transitory wrong and he got autopilot wrong. So it&#39;s time to get it right and this is a chance to preserve his legacy and you know what if he is right he can always hike 25 basis points. It&#39;s much easier to quell inflation than it is to deal with deflation and unemployment. That&#39;s very, very costly. Yeah. September 2022, that infamous uh transitory word, right? The one that you referenced there that many of us do remember when it comes to the path forward for Fed policy. So, you&#39;re bullish, you see tailwinds. Thomas, what do you like in this market? Yeah, I think uh I think you&#39;ve got to be nimble here because we are pushing. We&#39;re going to push to new highs this summer. No question about it. But if you just buy the indices, I think you&#39;re going to be a little disappointed. You got to look under the surface for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. If you look at earnings growth, so the magnificent 493 first quarter 27 uh the magnificent 7 first quarter 27% earnings growth that will decelerate by first quarter of next year to 10.2%. The unmagnificent 493 the rest of this the market uh went from negative earnings growth last year is going to be 10.3% by first quarter of next year. So basically what you have is 493 stocks earnings going up. multiple is much lower and the seven earnings growth basically collapsing and the multiple still high. So you want to look under the surface the 493. I got one for you that you&#39;re going to love. Yes. Estee Lauder. I know Estee Lauder. Well, okay. And we&#39;ve seen them down here on the floor of the stock exchange quite a bit. Yeah, they completely screwed things up. Okay. But turnaround Tom loves turnaround stories. Great businesses when they&#39;re marked down. Uh part of what hurt them was in fairness 2000 2021 to 2024 the COVID policy in China was pretty rough. They have 30% of their revenues out of China. Uh as bad as that was and the stock&#39;s down 2/3 because of that. They did maintain 99% of their share in China. So as China is now starting to recover, they&#39;re going to get that tailwind. They&#39;re number one in the premium brand category in skincare and in cosmetics across the world. Um, you know, and they have more than one brand. Sometimes I say Estee Lauder and people go, &quot;Oh, isn&#39;t that just mostly old ladies, you know, blah blah blah.&quot; First off, it&#39;s it&#39;s phenomenal makeup. I They do well with my clientele. I&#39;ll tell you that. Okay. Well, you&#39;re too young for All right. Estee Lauder. They&#39;ve got MAC. They&#39;ve got Dr. Jart for the young kids, the Korean stuff. They&#39;ve got Clinique. They&#39;ve got They&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for over a century, and they&#39;re going to continue to do the same. They&#39;re going to pivot. Um uh they&#39;ve got a margin re reaceleration plan. They&#39;ve got a new CEO in place. Uh Deutsch Bank upgraded on Monday to 90 bucks. Stocks are 7075 right now. This can be a double over the next 3 to 5 years. We love high quality business. This is compounded capital at double digits for decades. It&#39;s going to continue to do so. Everyone wants to look and feel good, right? Yeah. Yeah. We will be watching Estee Lauder indeed. Anything else, Tom? Yeah. I&#39;ve got a hairy one that no one&#39;s going to want, which I I always have to bring you one that that makes people a little bit uh uneasy. Advanced Auto Parts. Okay, they got it completely wrong. O&#39;Reilly&#39;s eating their lunch. Uh and they brought in a new CEO named Shane O Kelly. He&#39;s been turning the business around. He came from HD Supply, 77 billion business at Home Depot. He sold off Canada, paid down some debt, sold off uh closed 500 unprofitable stores, started cleaned up. Now he&#39;s starting to reexpand. He&#39;s opening a hundred new stores in those areas where he&#39;s number one and two in the market, which is 75% of the stores now. Consolidating distribution centers to get the pro the parts to the professionals quickly. Margins are going to expand from 2% to 7 12% over the next couple years. Last time margins were that high, the stock traded about $150. It&#39;s only $50 right now. So we think that could be a double to a triple over the next three to four years. So I do want to ask holistically. Obviously, it sounds like the Fed could be a risk to the downside if they are late on lowering rates, Thomas. But in terms of where we go from here, if you are bullish, what is your target for the S&amp;P 500? Yeah. Uh, that&#39;s a good question. In terms of the S&amp;P 500, I don&#39;t spend a lot of time with that because I&#39;m not correlated as much to the S&amp;P 500. I look at discreet businesses, but I think we can, you know, history says when you have this type of V-shaped recovery, 12 months out after you rise 20% as we have been in the last couple months, the market&#39;s up on average another 20%. So, I think 7,000 in sometime in 2026 is a realistic expectation. Uh probably towards the end of the year this year, maybe 65 6600 would be a reasonable expectation, but new highs and then we get into some fall volatility and then probably year-end uh year- end rally. All right. Uh we like to see a lot of green on the screen down here on the floor of the stock exchange. Thomas Hayes, he&#39;s a chair managing member at Grey Hill Capital. Thomas, thank you. Thank you for having me. And we&#39;re back. Then I had the pleasure to be on Yahoo for the full hour as well. Uh here are the highlight clips with Josh Lipton. Want to thank Taylor Cloier Smith, Josh Lipton, and Julie Hyman who accused me of being an optimist, guilty as charged. Uh you can listen in here. All right, let&#39;s bring in here Thomas Hayes as well as chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital here with us as well. Thomas, I want to bring you in here. I bet you Tom, there are some viewers who are watching this and they&#39;re saying, &quot;Hold on a second. Hold on a second.&quot; So the US strikes Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend. President Trump is is dropping 30,000 pound bombs. Then today, Iran fires missiles at a US base in Qatar. And I&#39;m looking at the popular averages and you see green across the screen. That might be surprising to some people. Does it surprise you, Tom? Uh, this is a case of sell the rumor, buy the news. Okay. Uh, if the great Art Cashion used to say, uh, you you sell the risk of war, you buy the first attack. Uh what you have here though and what we heard this afternoon from sources was that this was a call-in retaliation attack to save face and once we knew the magnitude of the meaning by that do you mean that that Iran was given cut or advanced notice? That&#39;s correct. Right. That&#39;s correct. It was advanced notice. It was symbolic so they can go back to their people. We don&#39;t take anything uh and then come to the table. So it&#39;s either going to be a negotiation or a regime change. We don&#39;t know yet. But but what we do know is this is very very constructive for the region. This has been a long time coming. They were completely decimated. It was completely by surprise over the weekend. There was no ambiguity about the message. You will not have nuclear weapons. Uh and uh it&#39;s going to it would take them so so long and so much money to rebuild. So the market loves this. And uh the Saudis are going to continue to pump. The Russians are going to continue to pump to avoid sanctions. So uh oil prices stay low. That&#39;s the key thing for for President Trump. That keeps inflation lowered so we can get some of these tax cuts done and we can deal with the big beautiful bill. Ben, thank you. Appreciate it. Tom, very quickly, I just want your take here. This big beautiful bill, the tax bill. I&#39;m just curious as a money manager, as a guy who has to think through what to buy and what to sell. How do you think through that? Yeah, I think number one, what&#39;s under reportported is what the bill unfunds. And if you look at what it unfunds and and a lot of climate stuff is taken out, which is why Elon Musk wasn&#39;t happy with the bill. Um, it&#39;s it&#39;s more responsible than advertised. It&#39;s not perfect. The only way we&#39;re going to get out of 120% debt to GDP is through growth and we need tax cuts. We need deregulation. That is happening. Uh and uh and and things are constructive. I love the low bar that is set going into earnings season. They they they took down earnings from 9.3% earnings growth to 4.9. So there&#39;s a lot and a lot of global liquidity. You know, people wonder like why have international stocks outperformed. It&#39;s money goes where it&#39;s treated best. There are 15 cuts around the world uh last month alone. Okay, which is the biggest amount since uh since during during co uh so so and zero from the US. So I think what you&#39;re going to see is you start to see some division here. Waller uh you had Goulsby today. You had Bowman today now coming out kind of against Powell. I think the Fed wants to be more dovish. I think global uh M2 money supply you look is at record highs after flatlining since 2022. So, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about here. A lot of growth coming, a lot of deregulatory policies. Uh, animal spirits want to go. So, we got through kind of the worst of the tariff. We got through the kind of the worst of the geopolitical here over the weekend. Now, it&#39;s like companies are are are on track. Animal spirits are coming back. Uh, Julie, bring me back in here. I&#39;m listening to you agree with that. Is it a shrug for the market, the tax bill? I I think at this point, uh, I think Julie&#39;s right and and as far as being optimistic, you know, 70% of the time, you&#39;re right. That&#39;s what that&#39;s what happens with the stock market. Uh haven&#39;t met too many wealthy pessimists. So, uh it&#39;s paid to to look at the bright side of things and and you know what, based on the data right now, there&#39;s a lot to be constructive about. All right. Company&#39;s robo taxi service yesterday. Electric vehicle manufacturer launching the program with 20 cars that will still be occupied by employees to monitor with each ride costing a flat fee of $4.20. CEO Elon Musk says that Tesla will likely expand the service based on its performance. Tom, what do you make of it? Well, it&#39;s like a magician. Look over here. It&#39;s the illusion. I mean, the car business has deteriorated uh since his involvement in politics. Uh however, if he&#39;s right, I I just saw a quote from him. Uh we expect hundreds of thousands of road taxis, if not millions, by the end of the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAlberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play. Uh this stock from current levels, it&#39;s trading around $55, $60. uh could go back up to $150 once the cycle returns and the operating leverage uh benefits and you&#39;re locking in a yield at current low levels. So, you&#39;re getting a high yield on the stock. It&#39;s below 3%. But, uh not only will you lock in that high yield, but they&#39;ll continue to increase the dividend every single year, similar to what Buffett did with Coca-Cola in 1989, and he gets more dividends than his basis every single year, uh you know, 20, 30 years later. All right, turn around, Tom. But here&#39;s the thing. So, viewers are watching this right now. before they commit capital, what are some downside risks they need to think about here? Yeah, I think uh the biggest downside risk would be if the Chinese government did an about face and they said we&#39;re no longer going to subsidize our green initiative. It&#39;s a very low probability, but but some of that demand is from the unnatural subsidies and that government initiative that&#39;s going to continue. Uh and we think it&#39;s part of the of their domestic consumption uh plan for 2030. They want 70% internal domestic consumption. So, I don&#39;t see that happening, but that would be a risk. All right, so that&#39;s your buy. Let&#39;s move to the name you don&#39;t like. And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven. I love they&#39;ve brought the bar down low for Q2 earnings. 4.9% easy to step over. You don&#39;t even have to jump. Market&#39;s going to like that. Global liquidity, M2 money supply. Uh, 15 F uh Fed uh F 15 central bank cuts around the world. Fed, by the way, now a little bit of dissension. three, Bowman, Goulsby, uh, Waller looking for cuts, uh, instead of, uh, remaining too restrictive like Powell has been talking about. They probably lay that out in Jackson Hole. So, what&#39;s not to love? There&#39;s a lot of good things. Look, we just went through the end of the world tariff war. We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in\nthe whole record $1 trillion of equity sold the beginning of April. They&#39;ve continued to have to been forced in, forced in, forced in. Now they&#39;re like, &quot;The market&#39;s gotten away from me. How am I going to catch up on performance? The only way you can catch up is to buy the lagards.&quot; So you you want to be buying small caps. Uh certainly some exposure to international, even though international has outperformed. And we&#39;re seeing that type of thing on these risk-on days. We&#39;re seeing the short covering. The shorts become the first buyers and then you get this positive constructive cycle. And if you want some uh valuation relief, small caps is the place to find it. and midcaps. You started to see flows come into midcaps. So, it&#39;s really interesting to see that today. I&#39;m paying close attention to that. Uh Jared, I want to bring you here. All right, Tom, back to you. Actually, I want to get your thoughts as well um on the Fed because I as I was talking there with Mike. You heard from Pal last week. Pal saying, &quot;Listen, I got to see how this tariff inflation is going to play out. I got to see who&#39;s going to pay for it. Is it going to be Tom and Josh? Is it going to be sellers and producers or some combination?&quot; And the message should be I&#39;m not in any rush to cut, but I&#39;m curious what what you&#39;re expecting this year. Well, I thought they were supposed to be data dependent. It sounds to me like he&#39;s being prediction dependent because he is predicting that inflation is coming in the coming months and in the meantime he&#39;s 200 basis points too restrictive and who has to foot that $600 billion of extra interest expense? You and I do as the tax. Is it your opinion they should be cutting now? I think they should have gone 25 basis points this month. Obviously, there was no probability of them doing so. Uh but now you start to see some of these people descent. Okay. uh three people now in the last few days. Goulsby, Waller, uh and and Bowman. Uh he&#39;s got to move because we got to refinance. And millennials, which is uh 72 million people trying to start a family, family formation, mortgage rates at 7.25%, 7%. It&#39;s holding up home builders. They&#39;re not risking that you&#39;re seeing in in building permits. It&#39;s time to go. You know, it&#39;s much easier if he&#39;s right about his predictions, which by the way, he&#39;s got real GDP in the SEP at 1.4. if he believes his own predictions, he should be cutting 50 basis points, not saying, &quot;I&#39;m predicting inflation is going to go up. It&#39;s a one-time tax, just like Mike said, it&#39;s time to go.&quot; So, they&#39;ll set the stage. He&#39;ll push it off another couple months, and he&#39;ll have his meeting in in Jackson Hole, and that&#39;s when he&#39;ll lay it out, and we&#39;ll get two cuts, which is Goldilocks because we don&#39;t want more than two cuts like Mike alluded to because that implies bad things. You should be cutting. You have powerful people in your corner, of course. The president, I believe, I think so. Around Tom&#39;s corner. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Tom, you were listening closely. You&#39;re a portfolio manager. You&#39;ve got to decide what to buy and what to sell. What What did you make of what you heard there? I liked what Brian said. Brian, what what do you think is going to turn around the volumes at CarMax? Is this just an interest rate play? Because uh you you choose industry leaders. I do turnarounds. My name is Turnaround Tom. So, we&#39;ll talk about Advanced Auto Parts uh outside. I&#39;m sure you have a lot to say about that. But Shane O Kelly, we&#39;re making a bet on Shane. We&#39;re gonna have our little niche business just with the uh uh markets where we&#39;re one and two because O&#39;Reilly&#39;s decimated us everywhere else. Uh but is that is that how you think about CarMax? Because the average car on the road is 13.5 years. The volume should be booming, right? I I mean and you&#39;re also hedged because if if people are going to drive it to 15 years, you&#39;re going to get the O&#39;Reilly business. But uh what what makes the what moves the needle on that one? Well, uh, as you&#39;re familiar, you know, the, uh, transaction volumes in both used cars and new cars have been, uh, have been slowed by the high retail prices. Big thanks to Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman, managing member for hanging out with me today for the show. Final thoughts on selectively constructive. I like that. Yeah, selectively. Look, if we look at earnings, uh, by Q1 of 2026, Mag 7 is going to decelerate from 27% earnings growth in the first quarter this year to 10.2 in the first quarter next year. Unmagnificent 493 accelerating from negative last year to 10.3% first quarter next year. So, you&#39;re paying lower multiple for more earnings growth in the 493. You&#39;re paying a higher multiple for declining earnings growth in the MAG 7. There&#39;s a lot of opportunities. You just got to look under the surface. And as we saw today, never bet against America. Look under the hood. Tom, we&#39;ll leave it there. Thank you, sir. Appreciate it. That&#39;ll do it.### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP And we&#39;re back. And then on the big money show also for the full hour as with Stu Vney, by the way. Want to thank him for putting me on as company, which means you&#39;re on the full hour, which is a big honor. Uh, and the full hour. Want to thank Madison Myrtto, who by the way is a swimmer. She swam at Penn State uh producer and booker. Uh Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Shell Cassone, and Charlie Gasparino was on. Was fun to see Charlie. Um and we&#39;re going to listen in here. Let&#39;s start with NATO. Uh President Trump was very happy to announce that he got the other countries to pay up 5% of GDP. Um and so he&#39;s winning on multiple fronts here. Yeah. Yeah. It&#39;s a lot easier to go into those negotiations when you just drop 30,000 pound bunker busters on Iran and was successful in quelling their nuclear ambitions. So, I think it was very very successful. I think President Trump has wanted this for a while. He&#39;s brought them along and now he closed the deal as he&#39;s done over and over and over. Charlie, you have uh covered Trump for many that we need more intelligence to to make sure that we did obliterate those sites. Well, I&#39;ll tell you, you know, owning Boeing owning Boeing stocks, if you understand what those bunker busters do, these are not surface missiles that, you know, they go deep down and and remember, they&#39;ve been planning for this for how many years? Fair, fair, fair point. But but they go 35 uh floors deep. President Trump was talking about these these bunker busters 30,000 lbs. They go down. Was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs after? No, I know. But was there anybody in there while they were dropping the bombs? We don&#39;t know. We didn&#39;t give them notice. I&#39;ll tell you that. reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward. Barclay strategist expecting more gains for stocks with AI driving earnings. Joining me now, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. Thomas, great to have you here\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKattos, we&#39;ll get the pronunciation there. Kratos Acuity and McCormick. First up, Kratos Defense and Security Solutions. Not one we talk about all the time, but they are offering nearly 13 million shares of its common stock today. Worth roughly $500 million. The technology company plans to use the proceeds for expansion of its existing national security programs, new acquisitions, and to pay down debt and expenses. Shares are falling after the announcement. I want to bring in Thomas Hayes, who is the Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member here. Uh shares right now, they&#39;re lower by about 1.8% here. Where does this company fit within the broader kind of defense mindset among investors from what you&#39;ve seen? Yeah. Well, the bad news is it&#39;s dilutive. So, the shares are down a little bit. The good news is they couldn&#39;t have timed it any better. Uh, 5% of GDP spending coming out of NATO for all these nations. So, uh, good good time to go out with an equity offering for a defense company. Unmanned systems, satellite business, missile defense. It&#39;s kind of the sweet spot of what everyone&#39;s been focused on this week. They raised a half a billion dollars. They can grow, they can expand, and they&#39;re going to benefit from the trends. Yeah, it seems like benchmark raising its price target to $48 from 40. They maintain their buy rating on this stock here. Uh, and we&#39;ll see exactly what this means in terms of how that funding and how that uh capital gets infused into the business and put to work as well for some of those scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nAnd I do want to point out I still have Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member with me here. And as we're taking a look at shares of Black Rockck, they're up by about 1% here on the day. Is this really expected to move the dial longer term here? Why does it make sense for Black Rockck to do this? Yeah, I I think they're doing it because they can. Okay, it's a huge market. the idea is to democratize private equity. But you see they follow the trends. You know, first Larry Frink said uh Bitcoin was no good and then the thing took off and then he started offering it to the public with the ETFs etc. So I I do think that there's going to be a place this is going to be promoted by a lot of uh financial advisors. This is going to be a part of the portfolio. The beauty of private equity and private credit which have become so popular is that you have uh no marktomarket. So, it's perceived low volatility because they mark the assets what what we used to say during the great financial crisis, marked to make believe or mark to whatever. And you never really see a mark until the asset is worth zero until it's fully marked down. So, in a in a bull market like this, everything's marked up. Everyone's happy. There's no volatility. You don't see that daily volatility. Retail loves that. Institutions, institutional consultants love not having the volatility. They love their sharp ratios when they come in the 25-year-old with their clipboard. uh uh but when you take the marks the marks are big. So I I think there's going to be a place for this in in a lot of 401ks and and for a lot of retail investors are going to try their hand but as you move into a recessionary type of period these are the assets that you want to be careful of.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nYeah I was taking a look at one of the charts from  Torston Paulo chief economist saying private equity as a percentage of public equity market 2003 3.8% 2024 8.8% 8%. That's some of the growth here that we've seen.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ncharts from Torsten Slok, chief economist, saying private equity as a percentage of public equity market 2003 3.8% 2024 8.8%. That's some of the growth here that we've seen.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nI want to thank Alexander Osipovich for including me in his article uh on the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWe grew revenue over 20% last quarter. We've got our pay with Venmo up 50%, our debit card up 40%. And partnerships like this just enable us to to reach our customers. \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nCharlie Munger, a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they've got terrible temperaments. Uh, cool is the name of the game. Patience buy high quality businesses when they're temporarily marked down and sit on your hands or go play golf. The secret to success is to do the unc to do the common thing uncommonly well. Everyone invests. Very few people do it well because they're always chasing the shiny object. They're always sucked into the action, always chasing headline stocks, following the herd, and eventually leading to slaughter.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nMoving along , let's get down to the data. Uh here we are. We've got um this is from Bank of America. Let's get this going here. There we go. Maybe I can do it this way. Yes. Okay. Net debt to market cap and US debt to GDP. This is pretty interesting. It shows that while the country's balance sheet is near historic uh historically bad, corporate balance sheet S&P 500 net debt to market cap is at record good. Okay. So debt to market cap is around 10% whereas debt to GDP is around 120%. I would not have guessed that for the S&P. That's pretty amazing. Here's from Fundstrat. Uh non-commercial futures percentage open interest. So this is back to contrarian buy levels what we saw near COVID lows which is unbelievable. We talked about the sentiment uh today with Brad Smith. Uh these are just still not numbers you see near top. So we're going to run higher. uh total money market funds still 7%. When uh rates come down, all that money is going to be forced back into equities. They're right now just sitting sitting out collecting four and a half 5%. That game is going to be over. They're going to be forced back out on the risk curve. Uh US dollar bare market is a 20 to 40% bare market just getting started. Uh dollar continues to weaken over time. We probably get short-term bounce. Bull bear indicator not yet at extreme. Gasoline prices below average for the past four years. That's not inflationary. Jay Powell weaker summer performance that could be we might have had a pull forward on the correction this year. So I wouldn't be too uh skittish yet. And I think even August, September, October is more going to be like sideways chop than a than another big crash. Uh and then we're going to end a year higher. uh Raymond James, it's going to be more of a rotation. Uh I mean, if you're just in indices, then yeah, maybe worry a little bit, but if you're in uh the right stocks, you probably actually it'll be the opposite. When the indices are doing weak, those will start to do better. Uh\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmore shelter disinflation likely in the pipeline. I think as rates go down, usually when you think of rates going down, prices go up. I think this is going to be the exact opposite this cycle. What&#39;s going to happen is a lot of homes are going to hit the market that have been trapped in 3% mortgages with millions of equity that are all going to hit the market at once and make homes more affordable. \n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nInternational value stocks are outperforming this year by a wide margin. Uh Iran&#39;s oil exports mostly go to China. It was interesting that Trump said that Iran can still export to China, wanting to get Iran to the table and wanting to get uh China&#39;s deal inked up. Real S&P 500 in index versus conflicts. You can see these conflicts over the last uh 150 years and how the S&P trends up over time. Weak US dollar environments create positive returns for financial markets and risky assets. What are the biggest beneficiaries when the dollar index falls 10%. Emerging markets, equity, we&#39;ve been talking about that for ages. Annual realized and bottom up consensus EPS growth estimates. What&#39;s going to be the biggest? Again, this continues to be updated. uh Russell by far 2025 18% earnings growth relative to the S&P of seven. Uh next year 37% earnings growth relative to the S&P of 14. Concentration of S&P market cap in earnings and the 10 largest inst index cont constituents. Uh 10 largest constituents make up 38% of the market cap but only 30% of the earnings and that amount of earnings is declining. This shows a cyclical uh move for the dollar over the last 50 years. It runs in about uh six or sevenyear cycles. You can see here we are at the top of the cycle and should be headed down for another three consecutive years for the US dollar. Defensive sectors influence at 35year low. Some of S&amp;P 500 defensive sector weights, consumer staples, energy, healthcare, and utilities. Make of this what you will, but we argue that a thematic rotation is a better route to defensive allocations. I would say this is pointing back to 2000 levels, 2001, which we&#39;ve covered a lot, which implies you want to start to get exposure to staples. We touched on it with Brad. Some of these defensive stocks like the Hormelas, like the Baxters, uh, in in healthcare, etc., like the Crown Castles, they are going to start to do well. that probably begins uh right now in the third quarter after earnings. Once you make new highs in the market and volatility starts in August, these defenses are going to start to spike up. Returns are highest when multiples are lowest, but otherwise matter little and that&#39;s where we are with our basket of stocks with low valuations and uh turning around massively. Rate cut expectations are now off the charts. I think it was 85% for September. for now and even 25% for July which is new. Lowest positioning in net non-commercial futures lowest positioning in 12 months to equities. So again that&#39;s not what you see at tops. I think we&#39;re going to push higher and just force maximum pain from all the l all the people who sold in the hole in April. Uh market implied US recession probability indicator is average. Uh foreign treasuries holdings may re remain near record. Everyone said they were going to sell all our treasuries. It&#39;s actually at a record high. 25 25 2025 total returns. US stocks 2.1%, international stocks 15.9. That&#39;s probably uh couple points now. I think US is up 4% and international is like 15. But we came into that with that minority view. Everyone said, you know, oh whatever. Gave me a lot of for it. Well, it&#39;s worked. Uh Charlie Bleello, US office to residential conversions are about to explode from a trickle today to a flood in 2027. Empty office towers to apartments, condos, hotels, future commercial real estate is going to look very different. Um you know, I pounded the hell out of the table two years ago for those of you who were real estate investors to buy office in San Francisco. And those guys have made an absolute killing like like insane money. I wish that was my game. Well, I don&#39;t wish that&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t have made as much money doing that, but you&#39;d if by real estate terms, you would have made a massive absolutely amount of money. So, um, so now I think if they&#39;re all converting to apartments, the the way to play it is buy BNC office and sit on your hands because eventually all the office is going to get spped up. Converted to a glut of apartments, those guys are going to lose and the ones that are left holding actual office are going to make a fortune. Onethird of baby boomers say they&#39;ll never sell. Good luck with that. The word never is usually right before they do. biggest inflow into energy. Once that once the supply hits the markets and price start getting bid and and hit the air pocket and they start to get fear of loss that all of their millions of equity that they work their whole life for are evaporating, they&#39;re all going to hit the market at once. Biggest inflow to energy funds since October 23. Short interest has risen in 2025 year to date. Uh so that that&#39;s more fuel. Shorts are the first buyers as we push to new highs. They&#39;re all going to be forced in. All the people waiting for the retest we&#39;ve talked about over the last week got absolutely monkey hammered. US household assets and liabilities total assets 179 trillion total liabilities 19. Everyone&#39;s balance sheet is good. Corporations people the only balance sheets that&#39;s bad is the US government. Equity ownership across wealth distribution 43% in the top 100 36% in the top sorry in the top 1% 36% in the so 10% own 79% of equities next 40% own 19% and the bottom 50% own 1% economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025 um what is this. Oh, K Schiller. Oh, home prices month. Yeah, a lot of markets starting to get hit, particularly Florida and Texas. That&#39;s usually where it starts. Market concentration is a global phenomenon. Top constituents by part market share. UK equities heavily weighted towards the top 10 stocks as well. Uh once a diverse index S&amp;P 500 is now around 50% growth weight of value growth plus fang mag 7 blend. Yeah, that&#39;s what you always see before reversals. It was the same thing in 1999. Dividend changes 5%. We&#39;ll skip that one. The high if higher in May and June, the rest of the year does very well. So when we&#39;ve seen conditions like this on average 12 months out up 14.8%. Uh USM2 money supply is now up 4 5% year on year. Slightly below the historical average growth rate but that&#39;s because we had such a big boom in 2000. But uh we&#39;ve talked about global M2 money supply which is now well at record highs. This is a critical chart here uh showing emerging markets just now breaking out of this long cup and handle which implies a measured move of at least uh 12 points. So 59 for starters. And then at that point, you&#39;re breaking out to new all-time highs and you get a bigger cup and you&#39;re looking more like uh move from 32 to 60 28 plus 60 you&#39;re looking at a move to 88. We&#39;re at 47. So a basic double uh if you have a little patience with emerging markets over the next couple few years. Summer rally could should continue. We agree. Major cities with declining home price growth 35%. It&#39;s happening. We told you. And it&#39;s it&#39;s going to continue. Uh it&#39;s going to be just the exact opposite. Once they cut rates, prices are actually going to come down. Uh just a supply dump all at once.\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nMagnificent 7 or Magnificent me. Uh you can see even now with all this huge rally year to date, you still have these majors that are down materially like Google, Amazon, Tesla, Apple. Uh Magnificent 7 is still flat. Maybe this week it it just went barely positive 1% 2% but um that&#39;s it back to the top of the range at probably another couple weeks of push through suck everyone in and then they&#39;ll they&#39;ll be weak again in the fall. US new single family homes month supply. So supply is going up. Uh all we need is rates coming down and the game is on. Institutional clients net buying of tech. So they&#39;re all chasing up now. uh they&#39;ll get monkey hammered in the fall. US stock valuations at a 75-y year high to the relative to the rest of the world. You want to have international exposure and you want to have it quickly. We haven&#39;t seen anything like that since when? Since 20201, which we&#39;ve covered what what outperformed next international small caps and value. What&#39;s not in this excess right\n\nActive strategies gaining over during select major draw down. US accounts for a quarter of global GDP but 2/3 of the MCI world index. That&#39;s a type of divergence that you can get rich on. think you know pause this listen again look at the table and figure it out. \n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNext chart, monetary aggregates M1 leads 12 months. China and uh nominal GDP. You can see Chinese money supply has been going straight up in the last 6 months. GDP will follow a big year for apartment buildings in big buildings. US multif family units completed by units per building. So offices are converting into apartments. Uh multif family units, rearview mirror, everyone looks in the rearview mirror. There&#39;s going to be a glut of apartments. Uh, that&#39;s not where you want to be. You want to be probably an office that no one wants in my opinion. World gas demand rises to a record. Uh, God love you. Comtock resources and range resources. Uh, there we go. Cumulative utility scale better. So, that&#39;s going to continue with the whole AI stuff. US continuing claims going way up. Apparently, Powell&#39;s not looking at this data. He&#39;s too busy predicting other data with his crystal ball that&#39;s worked so well. Autopilot and transitory box office growth year to date through June 26th. Uh it&#39;s actually cooking. And you know who&#39;s benefiting from that more than anyone else? Disney, baby. How do you like them apples? The media distributor gauge you Walt Disney Company is kicking ass 11.4% 4% in May over YouTube over NBC Universal over Paramount over Netflix. Uh Neielson&#39;s aggregated view of total usage by media company. Disney baby number one. How do you like them apples? Zero credit attributed to the stock. It&#39;s just getting started.

Goldman and City see Europe&#39;s economy powering stock higher rally and time for a makeover Estee Lauder um update. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nSo, each week we try to cover one to two companies we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast videocast. As you can see here, cash flow is starting to recover, but it&#39;s still iffy. Margins are starting to recover. That&#39;s actually real. A lot of good things beginning to happen. Key thing here, which Jeff wasn&#39;t able to circle, is you can see that over the past decade, the return on invested capital has been in the high teens to low 20s consistently until uh 2023. And this is coincident with the drop off in sales in China from 2021 to 2024. those are starting to recover. I think we&#39;re going to see a quicker recovery because it&#39;s not baked into the outlook uh the China recovery. The beauty is during the draw down is that they did not lose much share in China. They kept about 99% of the share that they had. They have number one uh share globally for premium skincare and cosmetics. That&#39;s not going to change. And for those of you who don&#39;t know, they cover a lot of brands. It&#39;s not just Estee Lauder. It&#39;s MAC. It&#39;s Clinique. It&#39;s Dr. Jart for the young kids love the Korean stuff. Um, it&#39;s Aveda. It&#39;s uh, it&#39;s more than you know. And they&#39;ve been buying and selling brands for 75 plus years, and they&#39;ll continue to do that. Similar to VF Corp, similar to Dagio. Last month, we put out a quick update following Estee Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings, but had not yet published a full deep dive. After falling below $50 a share at the April lows, the stock has been on a tear, rallying more than 50% off the bottom. Just this week, Deutsche Bank turned bullish on the turnaround story and issued a street high price of $95. We thought now would be a good time to revisit the name. Estee Lauder founded in 1946, is the global leader in premium beauty products with a portfolio of over 20 best-in-class iconic brands. Estee Lauder is basically to make up what and beauty what Diagio is to alcohol. Both are about as premium as it gets. The stock was never a huge position for us like Alibaba. It is largely a bet on the recovery of the Chinese middle class. And just like poker, we prefer positions with plenty of outs and few offer more outs than Baba. So while Estee Lauder may not be the everything business that Alibaba is, it still offers what we believe is a highly attractive riskreward setup. SA Lauder&#39;s roller coaster story over the past few years goes like this. When their prior CEO Fabriio Freda took the helm in 2009, his top priority was international expansion, aiming to generate over 60% of overall sales from international markets. That bet proved highly successful over the next decade, but also opened the door to significant overexposure to certain markets, especially China and travel retail. From fiscal year 2018 to 2021, China&#39;s share of total revenue jumped from just 13% to 36%. At one point, a single customer in China was responsible for 42% of the region sales. Management clearly bit off uh more than they could chew. And when the music stopped in 2022, Estee Lauder paid the price. Shares fell from nearly $375 to below $50 this past April, effectively wiping out more than a decade of gains. Now, this is exactly the kind of situation that earned me the nickname Turnaround Tom. As Buffett says, great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. That is the guiding light of our entire company at Great Hill Capital. That is the theme of everything we do is great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. We benefit from that misappraisal. This could not be a more accurate description of Estee Lauder. At the end of the day, this is a company that is as high quality and durable as they come, working its way of a once in a hundredyear event, yet priced as if it is in permanent decline, and people will never spend money on makeup again. Oh, and by the way, it&#39;s kind of the reverse GLP. As people lose weight, they buy more makeup, not less. We are more than happy to take the other side of that trade, and that&#39;s because we see the bulk of it, Estee Lauder&#39;s challenges as cyclical, not structural, with all signs pointing to a bottoming and nearterm recovery. The name of the game with Estee Lauder turnaround is margin expansion. Gross margins fell nearly 500 basis points, peaked to trough, bottoming in fiscal year 2024 at 71.7% as management worked through excess inventories and write-offs. The good news is the gross margins have now posted three consecutive quarters of 300 basis point gains with current guidance calling for 73.5% for fiscal year 2025 and an expected return to the historical mid70s range by fiscal year 2027. Operating margins are where the crux of the turnaround really is. SA Lauder has historically delivered mid to high teen EBIT margins but in 2024 these bottomed out at just over 10%. Management is working to restore EBIT margins to a solid double-digit level over the next few years. And the with the profit recovery growth plan expected to generate 800 million to a billion in annual growth savings and the full run rate benefits anticipated by fiscal year 2027. Green shoots across the businesses continue to point toward a return to growth in 2026, which will allow operating leverage to really kick in and get SA Ladder back to making more money than they know what to do with. At the same time, you have a new CEO who is a proven winner in the industry, a push into higher margin digital channels like Amazon and Tik Tok and China working its way towards becoming a mega-sized consumption economy. We think over the next few years this is a double from current levels. Until then, we are happy to sit on our hands and wait. Now, here&#39;s an in-depth breakdown of Estee Lauder&#39;s Q3 earnings. Uh, as the CEO said, quote, &quot;Return to sales growth in fiscal 2026.&quot; You should go through this line by line. We&#39;ve outlined the gross margin expansion expanded 310 basis points to 75% uh in the quarter. Uh achieved prestige beauty share gains for fiscal 2025. By the way, 10 years ago, prestige was 33% of all uh category purchases. Now it&#39;s 40%. This is a huge play on the emerging market middle class expansion. Um, they&#39;ll be one of the pure beneficiaries. On trend, commercial invocations, 10 new freestanding stores, Tik Tok shop. Okay, all this stuff you can look at. Let&#39;s just scroll down for now to the 10 key points. can see the improvement in China. All right, 10 key points. Number one, after sales declined 10% in fiscal year 2023 and 2% in 2024 and with guidance calling for another 8 to 9% in fiscal 2025, management remains confident in a return to growth by fiscal year 2026. Gross margins bottomed in fiscal year 2024 at 71.7 below the 5-year average of approximately 74, but have rebounded for three consecutive quarters with gains of over 300 basis points. Fiscal year 2025 guidance calls for 73.5% and management continues to target a return to the historical mid70s by fiscal year 2027. Three, management also remains confident in restoring operating margins to solid double digits over the next few years as a return to sales growth allows operating leverage to kick in. Margins bottomed in fiscal year 2024 at just over 10% well below the company&#39;s historical mid to high teens EBIT levels. Green shoots are emerging across the businesses with market share gains showing up in the US, China and Japan. In the US Q3 marked the first quarter in years with share gains driven by growth in three of four categories skincare, makeup and hair and 10 brands that held or gained shared led by Clinique which has now posted 11 consecutive quarters of gains in China. Estee Lauder gained share across all four brand categories and eight brands, making it the third quarter of share gains in the last four. And Japan Q3 marked the fourth straight quarter of market share growth. Tariffs are not expected to have a material impact on fiscal year 2025 profitability. Estee Lauder has the lowest exposure in the industry thanks to its nine manufacturing sites worldwide. Over 75% of what is sold in the US is sourced from the US or Canada and is protected on the USMCA agreement. 25% of what is sold in China is currently sourced from the US. But management aims to reduce this to less than 10% and has already mitigated north of 40% of the initial tariff impacts. Travel retail which is at its peak accounted for mid to high 20% of total sales thanks to shrink in in the low teens as a share of sales. Management is intentionally diversifying away from volatile travel retail significantly reducing inventories and de-risisking the segment outside of travel retail which declined 28% in Q3 and is expected to see another steep drop in Q4. Estee Lauder delivered sequential acceleration in global retail sales growth. Seven management remains on track with the expanded profit recovery growth plan PRGP which is expected to generate 800 million to a billion in annual growth savings with full run rate benefits anticipated by 2027. As of Q3, management has approved initiatives to eliminate over 2600 net positions with 85% expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and has already reduced middle management roles by 20% year-over-year. Aid Estee Ladder continues to lean into higher growth, higher margin digital channels with online organic sales up mid single digits in Q3. This includes 12 brands now available through Amazon prem premium beauty stores as well as momentum on Tik Tok shop helping digital channels reach 28% of total sales in 2024. That&#39;s up from just 13% in 2018. At the same time, exposure to department stores has been significantly reduced as a share of overall sales. Nine capital expenditures totaled 395 million, 3.62% 62% of sales in the 9 months ended Q3 down 44% from 72 million in the prior year period. Construction of the new factory in Japan had pushed capex as a percentage of sales to around 6% in recent years above the historical average of 4 to 5%. But spending is now expected to remain lower as management shifts focus to higher return on invested capital projects and allocate capex towards consumerf facing initiatives rather than capacity and capabilities. 10. In the first few weeks of Q4, management has continued to see strong retail momentum in the US, even stronger trends in China and positive momentum in UK across other emerging mark and across other emerging markets. Uh here&#39;s the earnings call transcript. You can go through the green highlights we put here at hedge funips.com. Just scroll down to popular post. It&#39;ll probably be the number one or two most popular post for the next 24 hours. Uh you can see the",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nquestions  we had was, can you grow Venmo? And you know, you&#39;re starting to see it now in in the results. We grew revenue over 20% last quarter. We&#39;ve got our pay with Venmo up 50%, our debit card up 40%. And partnerships like this just enable us to to reach our customers. I&#39;ve been with PayPal for a very long time. I got Vimmo too. Now every time I go to pay with um PayPal, it asks me if I want to do the pay now pay later option instead of just paying right you know I now pay later instead of just paying now for everything. How much of your business is that? That new kind of idea of get it now pay for it later. Yeah. Look, and it&#39;s connected to to the younger demographic. We are finding more and more college students and younger demographic wanting to pay with debit and buy now pay later as their credit option. And so our pay later, buy now pay later uh product is growing very quickly. Uh and it&#39;s becoming we grew 20% over 20% last quarter in buy now pay later. And so uh it&#39;s becoming the way that people want to spend. They don&#39;t want credit cards as as often. They want debit and buy now pay later.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nand they can come to. And we&#39;re back. And quote of the week, Charlie Munger, a lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they&#39;ve got terrible temperaments. Uh, cool is the name of the game. Patience buy high quality businesses when they&#39;re temporarily marked down and sit on your hands or go play golf. The secret to success is to do the unc to do the common thing uncommonly well. Everyone invests. Very few people do it well because they&#39;re always chasing the shiny object.

They're always sucked into the action, always chasing headline stocks, following the herd, and eventually leading to slaughter.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nMoving along , let's get down to the data. Uh here we are. We've got um this is from Bank of America. Let's get this going here. There we go. Maybe I can do it this way. Yes. Okay. Net debt to market cap and US debt to GDP. This is pretty interesting. It shows that while the country's balance sheet is near historic uh historically bad, corporate balance sheet S&P 500 net debt to market cap is at record good. Okay. So debt to market cap is around 10% whereas debt to GDP is around 120%. I would not have guessed that for the S&P. That's pretty amazing. Here's from Fundstrat. Uh non-commercial futures percentage open interest. So this is back to contrarian buy levels what we saw near COVID lows which is unbelievable. We talked about the sentiment uh today with Brad Smith. Uh these are just still not numbers you see near top. So we're going to run higher. uh total money market funds still 7%. When uh rates come down, all that money is going to be forced back into equities. They're right now just sitting sitting out collecting four and a half 5%. That game is going to be over. They're going to be forced back out on the risk curve. Uh US dollar bare market is a 20 to 40% bare market just getting started. Uh dollar continues to weaken over time. We probably get short-term bounce. Bull bear indicator not yet at extreme. Gasoline prices below average for the past four years. That's not inflationary. Jay Powell weaker summer performance that could be we might have had a pull forward on the correction this year. So I wouldn't be too uh skittish yet. And I think even August, September, October is more going to be like sideways chop than a than another big crash. Uh and then we're going to end a year higher. uh Raymond James, it's going to be more of a rotation. Uh I mean, if you're just in indices, then yeah, maybe worry a little bit, but if you're in uh the right stocks, you probably actually it'll be the opposite. When the indices are doing weak, those will start to do better. Uh",

    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nmore shelter disinflation likely in the pipeline. I think as rates go down, usually when you think of rates going down, prices go up. I think this is going to be the exact opposite this cycle. What&#39;s going to happen is a lot of homes are going to hit the market that have been trapped in 3% mortgages with millions of equity that are all going to hit the market at once and make homes more affordable. \n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nInternational value stocks are outperforming this year by a wide margin. Uh Iran&#39;s oil exports mostly go to China. It was interesting that Trump said that Iran can still export to China, wanting to get Iran to the table and wanting to get uh China&#39;s deal inked up. Real S&P 500 in index versus conflicts. You can see these conflicts over the last uh 150 years and how the S&P trends up over time. Weak US dollar environments create positive returns for financial markets and risky assets. What are the biggest beneficiaries when the dollar index falls 10%. Emerging markets, equity, we&#39;ve been talking about that for ages. Annual realized and bottom up consensus EPS growth estimates. What&#39;s going to be the biggest? Again, this continues to be updated. uh Russell by far 2025 18% earnings growth relative to the S&P of seven. Uh next year 37% earnings growth relative to the S&P of 14. Concentration of S&P market cap in earnings and the 10 largest inst index cont constituents. Uh 10 largest constituents make up 38% of the market cap but only 30% of the earnings and that amount of earnings is declining. This shows a cyclical uh move for the dollar over the last 50 years. It runs in about uh six or sevenyear cycles. You can see here we are at the top of the cycle and should be headed down for another three consecutive years for the US dollar. Defensive sectors influence at 35year low. Some of S&amp;P 500 defensive sector weights, consumer staples, energy, healthcare, and utilities. Make of this what you will, but we argue that a thematic rotation is a better route to defensive allocations. I would say this is pointing back to 2000 levels, 2001, which we&#39;ve covered a lot, which implies you want to start to get exposure to staples. We touched on it with Brad. Some of these defensive stocks like the Hormelas, like the Baxters, uh, in in healthcare, etc., like the Crown Castles, they are going to start to do well. that probably begins uh right now in the third quarter after earnings. Once you make new highs in the market and volatility starts in August, these defenses are going to start to spike up. Returns are highest when multiples are lowest, but otherwise matter little and that&#39;s where we are with our basket of stocks with low valuations and uh turning around massively. Rate cut expectations are now off the charts. I think it was 85% for September. for now and even 25% for July which is new. Lowest positioning in net non-commercial futures lowest positioning in 12 months to equities. So again that&#39;s not what you see at tops. I think we&#39;re going to push higher and just force maximum pain from all the l all the people who sold in the hole in April. Uh market implied US recession probability indicator is average. Uh foreign treasuries holdings may re remain near record. Everyone said they were going to sell all our treasuries. It&#39;s actually at a record high. 25 25 2025 total returns. US stocks 2.1%, international stocks 15.9. That&#39;s probably uh couple points now. I think US is up 4% and international is like 15. But we came into that with that minority view. Everyone said, you know, oh whatever. Gave me a lot of for it. Well, it&#39;s worked. Uh Charlie Bleello, US office to residential conversions are about to explode from a trickle today to a flood in 2027. Empty office towers to apartments, condos, hotels, future commercial real estate is going to look very different. Um you know, I pounded the hell out of the table two years ago for those of you who were real estate investors to buy office in San Francisco. And those guys have made an absolute killing like like insane money. I wish that was my game. Well, I don&#39;t wish that&#39;s I wouldn&#39;t have made as much money doing that, but you&#39;d if by real estate terms, you would have made a massive absolutely amount of money. So, um, so now I think if they&#39;re all converting to apartments, the the way to play it is buy BNC office and sit on your hands because eventually all the office is going to get spped up. Converted to a glut of apartments, those guys are going to lose and the ones that are left holding actual office are going to make a fortune. Onethird of baby boomers say they&#39;ll never sell. Good luck with that. The word never is usually right before they do. biggest inflow into energy. Once that once the supply hits the markets and price start getting bid and and hit the air pocket and they start to get fear of loss that all of their millions of equity that they work their whole life for are evaporating, they&#39;re all going to hit the market at once. Biggest inflow to energy funds since October 23. Short interest has risen in 2025 year to date. Uh so that that&#39;s more fuel. Shorts are the first buyers as we push to new highs. They&#39;re all going to be forced in. All the people waiting for the retest we&#39;ve talked about over the last week got absolutely monkey hammered. US household assets and liabilities total assets 179 trillion total liabilities 19. Everyone&#39;s balance sheet is good. Corporations people the only balance sheets that&#39;s bad is the US government. Equity ownership across wealth distribution 43% in the top 100 36% in the top sorry in the top 1% 36% in the so 10% own 79% of equities next 40% own 19% and the bottom 50% own 1% economists raise China growth exports outlook for 2025 um what is this. Oh, K Schiller. Oh, home prices month. Yeah, a lot of markets starting to get hit, particularly Florida and Texas. That&#39;s usually where it starts. Market concentration is a global phenomenon. Top constituents by part market share. UK equities heavily weighted towards the top 10 stocks as well. Uh once a diverse index S&amp;P 500 is now around 50% growth weight of value growth plus fang mag 7 blend. Yeah, that&#39;s what you always see before reversals. It was the same thing in 1999. Dividend changes 5%. We&#39;ll skip that one. The high if higher in May and June, the rest of the year does very well. So when we&#39;ve seen conditions like this on average 12 months out up 14.8%. Uh USM2 money supply is now up 4 5% year on year. Slightly below the historical average growth rate but that&#39;s because we had such a big boom in 2000. But uh we&#39;ve talked about global M2 money supply which is now well at record highs. This is a critical chart here uh showing emerging markets just now breaking out of this long cup and handle which implies a measured move of at least uh 12 points. So 59 for starters.

Consumer services, uh, communication services, same story, up 1.59 for this year, up 1.75 for next. So, we&#39;re past that period a year where they take down guidance. Now, they&#39;re starting to take it back up. Um, economic data, again, same stuff we&#39;ve covered about employment, about uh, housing, etc. And now on to the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\n\nBrendan Garvey, Hallebertton. I think I said Hallebertton was fine a few weeks ago. If you have to be in it, that I&#39;d probably choose that or Slumber. Um, I don&#39;t like it enough, but I think I think it&#39;ll work here. And we covered that in more detail back then. Robert Half. I think this is a staffing business. All right. I All right. So, their revenues and cash flow are not turning yet. Uh, what does their balance sheet look like? So, in these, you just got to go do the work and find out what&#39;s the plan to turn it around, and then you wait to see some signs of the plan working. Uh, but yeah, this this is a kind of adorable business. It probably bounces back, you know, $70, $75 range. It&#39;s 40. It&#39;s not a high, it&#39;s not a great use of capital for us. Uh, and you definitely need to start to see some recovery and understanding of the turnaround plan. But let&#39;s just see if you got waiting time to do it. Yeah, very very dimminimous debt. So, I think you&#39;re probably okay here. Uh, I don&#39;t love it and you should probably listen into, you know, four to eight of the last calls, find out what they&#39;re doing to turn the thing around. Uh, hey Tom, what are your thoughts on Craft Hind? Uh, yeah, we like it. We covered that last week or the week before. Uh, Leaf Foster, uh, BME in the UK, did you do any more work? No, I said it was worth you doing more work. I&#39;m not interested in it, but uh uh I thought it was worth you starting to do research if you like it. In other words, it passed the sniff test. Let me just double check this one. Yeah, I think I specifically said I don&#39;t like it because it&#39;s uh supermarket and that&#39;s a terrible business, but let me just double check. Uh yeah, I would never get into the grocery store business. I do think this one&#39;s going to be okay. Let me just double check the balance sheet and I think it&#39;s going to probably work for you. But I would I like that in airlines, you&#39;d really have to put a gun to my head and be like the last of five things I&#39;m allowed to buy for me to consider no matter how how good the numbers are. Like you could send me a million Chinese stocks if they&#39;re not named Alibaba or 10-centent. Like I&#39;m just not buying them. Um because the odds are against you in certain industries and certain countries. So you really have to have such a spectacular deal that you can make money if everything goes wrong. uh because in those areas it often does. So here I think the issue that you&#39;re going to have to deal with balance sheets a little leverage but it&#39;s not crazy. Um yeah let&#39;s see the margins margins are improving. I again I think you&#39;re okay if you understand the business. If you live in the UK and do that work, I think you&#39;re probably worth exploring it. That that just tends to be a garbage business. It reminds me of Tesco at Buffett got bagged in. Uh hi Tom, longtime listener. Thanks for all you do while I&#39;m kind of undervalued relative large cap. You think increasing influence abundance of private equity has structurally reshaped the p negative way. Best take in private. No, that&#39;s a load of It small caps are going to fly. Um, stop overthinking it. On to next. Marco Stalari. Uh, first question ever. Uh, about gold and the euro hunting. Hi, military ship builder nuclear carriers. Ah, hi. All right, let&#39;s take a look at that. Marco, I think you might be speaking my love language, my man. I think it&#39;s late, though. This thing&#39;s already up 60% off its lows. Uh, as a general view, no, I don&#39;t like it. It&#39;s just turned negative free cash flow. stocks up, anticipating a turnaround that hasn&#39;t happened yet. Uh, this is the kind of stock I&#39;d love to see go back down to 160 or 150 and then just buy every share once I see a little turn turn in free cash flow, but there&#39;s no upside here. The fundamentals have gotten worse and the price has gone up. Not not interested yet, but I generally like the business, Marco, and congratulations on your first question. Thank you for your support, Liam Cook. Uh, thanks for all you do for the podcast. uh listener for six months. Wish I&#39;d have started listening earlier. Currently holding one small cap. Cooper Standard. Uh would you want more exposure in a portfolio? 12 stocks. Yeah, we have more. I mean uh Cooper Standard is a small cap. We have a little Canadian goose. We have um Comtock has been a big big run uh mover for us. Three or 4x already. That was a small cap. I don&#39;t know if it still is. I guess it still is. Uh that&#39;s more than enough small cap exposure. Um BF Corp is like a small to mid. Uh okay. Brandon, that&#39;s a new client. Want to become a new client. Uh Barrett, new client. Anton. Okay. Looking at buying gun dealers in healthc care, not the soldiers. Might want to look at GXI. Uh hard pass, huge negative free cash flow, margins declining. What is this thing do? Critical packaging and delivery systems. Yeah, not yet. I want to see more of a turn before I get interested in that. Anton from Denmark, but thanks for the question. Adrien Smith. So, I started half position in QXO the end of April with the intention of adding to it over the coming months. Since then, it&#39;s up around 85% in less than two months. Obviously, not going to complain about that, but was only able to get a half position. What do you do when a position gets away from you before you can make a meaningful position? Uh, nothing. And number one, and usually I put the whole position on it at once or at least, you know, 80 90%. If it goes lower, I add more. If it goes higher, I have what I have and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t chase up. Uh, thank you for your great content invaluable as uh for growth as an investor. Well, you&#39;re welcome and good question. Uh, CK Patel, love your podcast. Would like to find out your thoughts on uh B2Bwi. Uh, I think we covered this one. Bath and Body Works. No, it it&#39;s probably fine. Let me take a look at the fundamentals here. Cash flows never recovered to peak. Revenues margins are kind of I mean what what&#39;s the motivation here? You want to write from 25 to 50? I I wouldn&#39;t chase that. I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great business. I don&#39;t think it has a great moat. I think it&#39;s like a fad that runs in cycles and eventually goes out of business. John Francis Porsche, you Porsche people. All right. Uh no, I I won&#39;t buy any OEMs no matter how cheap they are. uh even Ferrari which has done well. Okay, and that&#39;s it. We&#39;ll be back next week. Same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one.",
    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions . We have quite a few this week. If you like the\n\nThoughts on Clorox. Mike, we covered that a couple weeks ago. It's fine. Not the highest and best use for us, but uh, decent company at a good price. Not thrilled about the CEO. Maybe they'll change her out. Why did Etsy do a convert? They wanted to be as non-dilutive as they could and not pay high interest. So, uh, I kind of like that play. What are your thoughts on Shu Steve Madden? Let's take a look. S H O O H I haven't heard anyone talk about Steve Madden forever. I mean, just you just want to you just want to understand how they're going to turn around free cash flow here. I mean, I'll take a quick look at the balance sheet. Looks okay. I don't I don't like it. It's it's not the type of business that I'd be involved in, but I think you're going to be fine with it. And I think it's pretty good uh analysis and worth understanding their competitive moat.\n\nSimon Staz Staz Stazz uh Americ [Music] was suggested by big short guys as long yesterday. Well, I worked for Cornwell, so I don&#39;t know that they&#39;re in that. Um I think m miners as a general rule of thumb other than Albamaro are crap. um businesses even when the price of whatever they&#39;re mining goes up, they find a way to lose money. It&#39;s just a terrible business. ARG.TO All right. All right. Cash flows are recovering, revenues are recovering, margins are recovering. So, they&#39;re in the circular mo secular move here, but I think they&#39;re towards the top of the range. What do they mine? you know, these guys that are always bearish all the time and then the market makes new highs and they&#39;re forced to buy something. They always buy these pieces of that wind up doing nothing for them. So, what do these guys do? Uh, copper and copper concentrates in Chile. I mean, this is this is like too hard pile gamble and win maybe gamble and lose likely hard pass for me. Um, okay. John Wicker, love the pod. Thoughts on General Mills? I think this is in the group that&#39;s going to start to get bid in the fall. Uh, along with the Hormells and um I just don&#39;t think this has come down enough for me to get interested yet. At 40, I&#39;d probably be a buyer. Um, yeah, you just want to see some recovery in margins and revenues before you go crazy. Unless it gets down to 40, then you can kind of pull a J Powell and predict the recovery. But, uh, I I like it below 45. I don&#39;t like it here and I may never get it. So, we&#39;ll just wait on that or do nothing. More likely do nothing. Uh Jimmy Jones. Uh yeah, Hormemell is just a defensive spot in our portfolio with the margin of safety. He&#39;s talking about the interim CEO. Yeah, I wish they had their final CEO, but he&#39;ll fix things up. The business will start to turn. They&#39;ll get a hot shot in there. So, it might take a little longer, but in the meantime, you got a nice dividend and it&#39;s fine. I mean, could I see myself selling out of Hormeell and buying uh Craft Hines? Possibly. They&#39;re both kind of the same characteristic, but they&#39;re both going to basically do the same thing when that group turns. And that and same as General Mills. Those just have a a bigger upside than General Mills or or Campbell for that matter. Campbell&#39;s kind of a dog. Um all right, Jason Zen, Global Payments. We&#39;ve covered this one, Jason, a million times. We just don&#39;t like the business. Um, so I&#39;ll leave it at that. I think you&#39;re going to be okay on this, but uh I just forget what was the thing from the work I did a while back. I think it had to do with the opacity of the portfolio of the assets that they held or the margin compression, but there was something I didn&#39;t like about it. I think it works as a trade here. Uh, I understand why you&#39;re interested in here. Free cash flow is going fine. Margins are going fine. Starting to recover. I&#39;ve just never liked this business from a quality standpoint. I&#39;d rather be in PayPal, but uh I think it&#39;s going to work for you. So, good work on that. Uh Chuck. Okay. Uh here&#39;s Daniel Estz sent uh Tele Performance TEP. It&#39;s a French company. Free cash flow is going through the roof. Revenue is going through the roof. Margins are starting to recover. Return on capital has been spotty. uh business has been around for a long time if I&#39;m not mistaken. Founded in 1910 uh digital business services company operates specialized services segments, customer acquisition services, business process management, blah blah blah. They do a million things. Uh, seems like a company that&#39;s been pretty nimble over the years in adjusting to environments. Um, balance sheet. Let&#39;s take a look. Million dollar cash. Good statement. had some big growth. They must have done an acquisition good. Balance sheet generally looks okay. I mean it&#39;s generating a return on capital that&#39;s probably I don&#39;t know if we have weighted average cost of capital here. No. probably below its cost of capital. Yeah, look, I think this one is definitely definitely warrants doing some work. I mean, it&#39;s just going to be really understanding what is the competitive mode on all the businesses that they&#39;re doing. Why is the stock down so much? Uh, and um uh what&#39;s the turnaround story? But it&#39;s cheap. It looks like it&#39;s starting to grow again. Balance sheet seems okay. Check when they have to refinance everything. And I think you&#39;re on to something, Daniel. Uh\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nAnton. Okay. Looking at buying gun dealers in healthc care, not the soldiers. Might want to look at GXI. Uh hard pass, huge negative free cash flow, margins declining. What is this thing do? Critical packaging and delivery systems. Yeah, not yet.

Are there exactly 22 teams? Is that more? It&#39;s like the S&amp;P 500. to enable college athletic departments to pay their student athletes directly through the financial platform. Uh this comes after the landmark June6 court ruling that allows schools to directly compensate uh student athletes starting on July 4th or July 1st. Joining us now to make the announcement first on CNBC PayPal CEO Alex Chris uh and Big 12 Commissioner uh Brent Yormack and Venmo&#39;s involved.",
      "conference come together and provide great brands with solutions like we have here with PayPal and uh you&#39;re probably psyched. You&#39;ll get everybody. Who else who else would uh would compete with you with with other colleges? Well, look, we we will we are the best way to distribute the funds. And what&#39;s important is you need to have the wallet that the college students are using. They&#39;re not going to be adopting new new tools and technology as they&#39;re sitting there. They&#39;re already using Venmo. They&#39;re already using PayPal. Their parents are already using it.",
      "connecting with that demographic. So, that was ideal for us.

      "Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member. You&#39;re bullish on Alberl Tom. So that&#39;s where we&#39;re going to start. We&#39;re going to go through the reasons why you like this thing, which by the way, it hasn&#39;t had a rough, you know, year year to date. It&#39;s been kind of rough, but we&#39;re going to walk through why. You say this one&#39;s a buy. So let&#39;s go through the points. First point, huge operating leverage. Yeah, this is a big deal. So they&#39;re a lithium producer. They&#39;re the lowest cost. They&#39;re one of the largest lithium producers. So right now, lithium prices go in five to eight year cycles. We&#39;re at the trough of the cycle. Kind of fell into the EV narrative that people don&#39;t want EVs anymore. But that&#39;s that&#39;s really not the story here. As the price turns, as it does every 5 to 8 years, even pre-Ess, we&#39;re talking 40 years. This has been going every 5 to 8 years. the cycle. The amount of operating leverage that Albamaro has to benefit as prices go up is astounding. And in the short term, they&#39;ve got ample liquidity to to ride through that trough while their competitors will fall away at the wayside. All right. Second reason you say this one&#39;s a buy demand growth. Yeah. Uh so the EV story is predominantly a China story. China has 60% of the EV market. They&#39;re growing in leaps and bounds. This is an unnatural subsidized market that&#39;s going to continue. It&#39;s an initiative of the government. US by uh by contrast only has 10% of the EV market. But that&#39;s not the source of the actual growth for lithium. Uh it is energy storage systems. Okay, that&#39;s expected to have uh demand from 1.2 million metric tonses to 3.2 million metric tonses by 2030. Albamaro is going to be the key beneficiary of that growth. Final reason you say to pile into this one, dividend aristocrat. Yeah, they&#39;ve been raising the dividend every single year for 30 years plus. That makes them a dividend aristocrat. Uh stable balance sheet, $3.1 billion of liquidity. Uh the market is expected to rebalance by 2026. And when they rebalance, it&#39;s it&#39;s, you know, the stock is down materially. We do turnarounds. My nickname is turnaround Tom. So this is going a 3 to 5year play.

We just went through the end of the world possible World War II type of situation. Uh, and these companies keep chugging along. GDP now estimates. What quickly, what worries you? What would be on your list of worries on your radar? downside risk. Uh downside risk would be if President Trump didn&#39;t like how quickly the tariff negotiations were going and he did the hard stop on July 9th and you know we&#39;re back to, you know, where we were in April. The probability is that very very low. We&#39;ve got an election coming up in, you know, next year. I don&#39;t think he&#39;s going to do that. He&#39;ll threaten it. So you&#39;ll have a little bit of volatility on the way up, but on balance it&#39;s it&#39;s continues to be time to be constructive, but selectively constructive. And that is I think which Ed Yardenni referenced is the unmagnificent 493 trading at 18 times. There&#39;s a tremendous amount of opportunity and underexposure in those in those stocks. Stay selectively constructive, by the way. Thank you, Tom. While we&#39;re wrapping up, Tom Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and managing member still with me. Thoughts on today&#39;s moves? What do you make of them, Tom? Well, uh, you said selectively constructive. I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s really interesting today. Small caps outperform tech outperform the S&P 500. I make it. It&#39;s risk on. People are playing the catch-up trade. You got some short covering today. Record short interest in small caps right now. I think that&#39;s going to be a meaningful trade for the second half of this year as people realize, wait, they short, they sold in"

      "And I like this one. I like this one because people have very strong feelings about it. Palunteer, not a fan. Let&#39;s go through those these reasons. Well, stocks overvalued. Yeah, look, 83, it&#39;s $324 billion market cap on $3.9 billion of sales. Uh 83 times sales, uh 200 something times earnings. So you&#39;re effectively look if you believe in Palunteer and they certainly do have a defensible moat they&#39;re going to do great things. The pro the question is how much of those great things that they&#39;re going to do over the next decade are you already paying for today? Current valuations you would have to grow revenue at a 50% compound annual growth rate for the next 10 years to justify the current valuation. All right. Bullet point number two. So it&#39;s too rich. The second reason. Yeah. So 50% of the stock, a little more than that, is owned by retail investors. If that sentiment turns, like we saw with the meme stocks, whether it was AMC, high valuation, not really on the basis of current fundamentals, GameStop, etc. When they fall, they fall fast. When they exit, they exit all at once. So you have some risk there. And a final point here, the reason you say avoid it, aggressive competition. Yeah, there&#39;s no question. uh you&#39;ve got uh a data bricks, you&#39;ve got Microsoft, you&#39;ve got AWS, you&#39;ve got all these companies coming into uh the the the arena. Uh I would say another red flag has been the insider selling $125 million in the last 30 days alone. The chief technology offers officer selling like it like his pants are on fire. I mean, unless the guy wants to buy $120 million house, I don&#39;t know what he needs all that cash for. So, uh it tells me maybe it&#39;s gotten a little ahead of itself. The other thing I don&#39;t like uh is that they&#39;ve diluted their owners uh and increased the share count by 4x over the last six years. So even if they continue to do that, if they keep issuing stocks to to management in abundant amounts, uh what do you what what is your slice of the pie going to look like if you buy today and they add and they forex the share count again over the next five to six years? Now before turnaround, Tom, I let you go. The last thing I need to know though, where could you be wrong? What what are some upside risks I need to think about? I think the biggest risk uh they certainly have a quality product. It&#39;s a defensible product. They have a mode around their product. Um the biggest risk would be is if the defense department decided to double government spending on defense, which given the budget talks, given the the initiative of this administration is probably a lower probability, but not a non-existent probability. With everything we&#39;ve seen over the weekend, uh nothing is out of the question. In which case, Palanteer would be a beneficiary. government would spending it would go up, their contracts would probably go up. And we should know the stock has been a monster, Tom. Yeah, it&#39;s up about 85% this year already. It was up around, last I checked, 480% over the past 12 months. What a run. But there it is. Portfolio recommendations by Alamar. Avoid Palunteer. Thank you so much, Tom. Thank you for the viewers as well for watching. Goodbye. Goodbye.",

Goodbye.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWell, first and foremost, every time there&#39;s a conflict in the Middle East, everyone&#39;s worried about closing the the straight of Hormuz. It&#39;s never happened. Not even, which is remarkable, by the way, that it has never happened. It&#39;s never closed. Markets climb a wall of worry. You know, I looked at the most recent Bank of America global fund manager survey, the sophisticated half a trillion dollars, 222 managers. They are still nearly as pessimistic as they were during the co lows. nearly as pessimistic as they were during the great financial. I mean, those are the pros. What about the retail investors? Well, look, retail investors, oddly enough, have been right since COVID. They&#39;ve been buying all the dips when the institutions have been hiding under the table and they&#39;ve been making all the money. And I think that trend uh is going to persist with sentiment like this. Markets don&#39;t top when sentiment is that pessimistic. And that&#39;s why I think we&#39;re going to push to new highs uh before the end of the summer. Then we&#39;ll probably fall get into some fall normal chop, normal volatility before the end of the year rally. Uh, but it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s earnings driven.

    "NVDA": [
      "the demand uh exceeds supply by 10 to one and that that&#39;s the issue with Nvidia right now. They their business model depends on the kindness of strangers. So Taiwan semiconductor has limited their revenue growth each quarter to 4 billion because that&#39;s all they can fulfill. So for the next phase of Nvidia&#39;s growth uh you need to see those fabs get finished by Taiwan and semiconductor to increase capacity and I think the dark horse that no one&#39;s paying attention to. We&#39;ve seen a stealth rally in, you know, Intel 45 mph in the slow lane. Uh, 10% plus this week. And I think part of that is Lip Bhutan is is cutting staff. I think the other part is they&#39;re the only game in town with fabs at the 10 yard line ready to spike the football and the touchdown. There are there are chips being tested on their fabs and I think if they can be a part of that supply solution to Nvidia and others, uh, that could be kind of a dark horse. So while you see maybe Nvidia double, if if Intel gets it right, it could be meaningful. You know, that also raises a similar question that we had brought up in our previous conversation with regard to how many of those chips will able will be able to be shipped to other parts of the world if so much of the money that&#39;s helped Intel get to this point has really been prioritized at bringing up and scaling up production here in the US. Yeah. Well, I I think once they get that production set, I think the sky&#39;s is the limit as far as global demand. Uh, and I don&#39;t think they need to be bestin-class. I think there&#39;s going to be so much unlimited demand that anyone that can produce, even second tier, that&#39;s a weird call to say, &quot;Hey, just be mediocre.&quot; By the way, by the way, that&#39;s my base case with Intel is they are the leader of mediocre chips. And and and by the way, as they bring this capacity online with Lip Bhutan, he did unbelievable things at Cadence Designs. That was a multi multi multibagger. No one&#39;s better. He&#39;s going to fix it. They&#39;re going to be part of the solution. It&#39;s going to help Nvidia. It&#39;s going to help Intel, etc. And it&#39;s going to help boring, normal businesses that implement AI, uh, which Dan Dan alluded to, which is going to be huge, which no one&#39;s looking at right now. Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses.",
      "reporting that and it takes, you know, Charlie, that&#39;s the tech sector higher. You can agree or disagree with me. Jump in here. Yeah. Well, I I think look, it&#39;s not just Nvidia, it&#39;s not just the AI players, it&#39;s the beneficiaries. You&#39;re going to see industrial companies become more productive. You&#39;re going to see companies across all sectors become more productive. I mean, when we talk about the roaring 2020s and the tailwinds that we have right now, whether it&#39;s the ceasefire, whether it&#39;s the trade deals, whether it&#39;s the big beautiful bill with the permanent tax cuts coming, uh there&#39;s a lot of lot of things to be constructive about. And what&#39;s really beautiful is sentiment is still so low. If you looked at the Bank of America fund manager survey last week, it was near COVID low levels. What does that mean? As more trade deals come out, as more good news, which part of the trade deals are good though, the or the put the genie model. We have a we have a BB block and we will go into that in depth my friend. Okay, we&#39;ll get you always shephering the cats. Thank you. Coming up, Tom, you seem pretty bullish on the trade deal front. Make your case. Yeah, listen, the mark market participants now have confidence in this administration&#39;s level of kind of rational behavior when it comes to the economy and when it comes to markets. Look, we have an election next year. uh we saw we pushed it to a certain level. But what people don&#39;t keep in mind, he Trump always comes out with a huge ask. Okay, that&#39;s the way he negotiates. He he kind of punches you in the face and then he offers you an ice pack and and you&#39;re happy you got the ice pack. Uh and that&#39;s basically what we&#39;re seeing with the negotiation here. What we have right now is still some $300 billion coming in from tariffs just at the 10% level. If he had started at 10%, where would we get? We&#39;d have nothing. Okay, so he started big. 10% looks like a deal. And what we have to focus on is non-tariff barriers. He wants markets opened everywhere for US businesses to expand. And I think that&#39;s going to be a core part that people are less focused on. Uh they&#39;re focused on the 10%. They&#39;re focused on on that. They&#39;re going to be pleasantly surprised by the amount of fairness in bilateral trade moving forward. Okay. Charlie, anybody sober in Washington right now because they&#39;re spending like drunken sailors? Yeah, it&#39;s it&#39;s out of control. There&#39;s no question about it. We got to get spending under control. But I&#39;ll tell you what, at 120% debt to GDP, the issue is not really spending because you can&#39;t austere your way down to, you know, 50% debt to GDP. The only way you&#39;re going to do it when you&#39;re this far past is growth. Okay? So, we&#39;ve got to extend these tax cuts. We got to continue with deregulation. In 19 The last time we had 120% debt to GDP was 1948. By 1958, we were at 53% debt to GDP. You know how we did it? We didn&#39;t cut spending. We grew massively above trend and inflation ran a little bit above trend. If the world was destroyed because of World War II, we were the only You had rebuilding. Yeah. We were the only game in town. I mean, we have a different economy right now. I think we&#39;re lucky when we get 3% growth right now. Yeah. Okay. So, remember that. So, you do have to have some austerity here. And there&#39;s no austerity in this. I mean, but Cheryl, to answer your question, you&#39;re seeing the natives are getting restless at the Fed. Three people came out against Powell. That 2% is costing us taxpayers. He&#39;s 2% too restrictive. That&#39;s costing us $600 billion a year in interest payments. You know who is destroying is the millennials. 72 million people trying to start families, housing formation, family formation. Can&#39;t do it with bas not on the table. Listen, Bessant can issue shortterm and buy in the long long end of the curve. Do an operation twist like 2012. he&#39;s been doing is exactly what Janet Yellen&#39;s been doing to artificially keep the 10-year, but it just it you cannot finance long-term long-term your your your liabil long-term liabilities with short-term debt. It leads to bankruptcy. Can I just say one thing? I don&#39;t I mean, we&#39;ve seen this playbook before in so many blue cities across the country. It doesn&#39;t work. I was talking to a colleague a couple weeks ago when I was on my way to Dubai. Uh he lives in Miami. He moved his hedge fund business down to Miami about when Delasio was in. He goes, &quot;When I was your age, New York and London were the center of the world. Today, it&#39;s Miami and Dubai. And unless we change the policies and what what do those two jurisdictions have in common? Business friendly policies, business friendly regulations. Detroit, we&#39;re going to get more of the same. I got I was there recently. Thank you for being with us. We really appreciate it. It&#39;s always great to see you.&quot; coming up and we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith today on Yahoo for two hours. Uh we&#39;ll only give you the best clips. Uh want to thank Justin Oliver, Brad Smith, and Cheyenne Reed will listen in now just after the opening bill. We appreciate it. On Wall Street, strategists see AI and economic data replacing tariffs and the tax bill as the big focus for investors going forward.

      "Nvidia.

Right now, you think AI, you think, you know, Mag 7, you think Palunteer, you think Nvidia, but the big beneficiaries are also going to be real businesses. what needs to continue to take place or transpire within business spending towards AI to really continue to allow the AI trade to to keep its foothold on this market and be the the kind of core barometer of the investment psyche if you will. Yeah. That you know it&#39;s really interesting because you see the Mag 7 and and there&#39;s like a good news is they&#39;re benefiting from the AI trade. The bad news is their earnings growth is collapsing because they are doing all this capex. So Q1 of this year earnings growth of Mag 7 was 27%. Q1 of next year 2026 earnings growth is going to be 10.2 but the multiples have not really compressed. Then you take the unmagnificent 493 all the boring companies that are going to benefit from these technologies in terms of implementation. Their earnings growth was negative. It&#39;s going to be 10.3% and the multiple is meaningfully lower. So I think there&#39;s a lot of uh unexpected AI opportunities. If you take Brad Jacobs for instance, he does all these rollups QXO where he buys boring businesses, building supply companies, etc., and he goes in and he doubles Ibida with technology. He&#39;s a huge implement of these technologies in boring businesses. GXO Logistics, they&#39;re one of the first businesses using humanoid robots to help move the stuff in the different distribution centers and warehouses. So, it&#39;s pretty wild. I&#39;ve got Brad Jacobs&#39;s book on my desk. Thank you for sending that, Brad, by the way. from one Brad to another. Just lastly on this topic here, because we&#39;re going to discuss a range of topics throughout the morning here, but as you think through the leaders of the tech rally right now versus the rotation that we could see, names that have been underappreciated, where are those parts of that trade? Yeah, I think you know the market&#39;s going to continue to push higher for the next four weeks. Why? Partially because of global liquidity is back at an all-time high. Partially because earnings expectations are really low. they&#39;ve taken him down from 9.3% to 4.9%. Uh so that&#39;s going to drive the bus. Mag 7 is kind of back up to the top of the range despite earnings growth deceleration. So I do think as you kind of stabilize after we make those new highs and everyone gets euphoric and tech&#39;s got to push it up because of the weight in the indices. I think that second half of the year where you&#39;re going to benefit is uh the unmagnificent 493. But it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m looking at today uh small caps are outperforming the NASDAQ. So Russell 2000 outperforming the NASDAQ, outperforming the Dow Jones, outperforming the S&amp;P 500. That is the the small cap index is the most shorted in history right now. And these are the type of companies that benefit from these technologies. And uh and I think you&#39;re going to see the back half a big surprise in the 493 in small caps in companies that will be beneficiaries of the great things that the Nvidia of the world are providing. All right, Thomas, we got a lot more to discuss here. You&#39;re with us all morning. We&#39;ve got much more on Catalyst as well here. Markets action, of course, some of your top picks for the round two of the NBA draft as well. If you want, you&#39;re watching Market Catalyst. We got a lot to get to. Stay tuned. Still here with me, we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital Chairman and Managing Member here. So, as we think about the SLR, of course, as we&#39;re hearing from Fed Chair Jal, who was commenting on it during his two-day stint on Capitol Hill, both discussing with the House Financial Services Committee and then additionally with uh the Senate yesterday here, this question came up. The SLR was supposed to act as a backs stop to riskbased capital requirements. Too often the SLR acts as a binding requirement for US banks. They went on to ask, would you agree that adjusting the SLR would free up capital for banks to invest more in treasury markets and other low-risk assets that would be beneficial to families and businesses across the country? And on net he agreed. So what is the significance of that? What should bank expect from this point forward? This is the biggest news of the summer, okay? And maybe of 2025. Effectively, what it&#39;s going to do is enable banks to own a ton of treasuries. They&#39;re not going to have to post capital against it. So, they can do that. They can get the yield. And banks preference, they tend to buy on the short end of the curve. So, in terms of mortgage rates, how does that really help in in the argument people make, well, what&#39;s the difference if if Powell cuts because the 10-year yield dictates the the mortgage rates. Um, what happens is they can issue shortterm and do an operation twist like they did in 2012. Besson can do it at the Treasury and buy in the longer end of the curve, which could bring down the 10-year yield by 30 to 70 basis points. If that happens, you could see a 30-year fixed rate mortgage by the end of this year in the high fives, below 6%. Once that happens, the demand for housing is going to be off the charts because basically Powell has delayed the dreams of 72 million millennials by artificially holding rates 200 basis points above inflation. Highly restrictive. And you see the average uh age of a new home purchase has gone up so much since Powell has has been 38 now. It&#39;s 38. And and that becomes late to start a family. It becomes late to have kids. So, a whole generation has been hurt by wrong-minded policy. And if and when uh Trump announces a shadow Fed chair, Powell immediately becomes a lame duck for the rest of his term because the market will start to price. And let&#39;s just say it&#39;s Kevin Hasset. Sure. Very dovish. The market will begin to price in 200 basis points of cuts in 2026 immediately. Powell will have zero power from that point forward. So when he says the end of September, he&#39;s basically saying time to move or I&#39;m or I&#39;m going to go with this. You got to move in July or you got to move in September or I&#39;m announcing the shadow Fed and you&#39;re you&#39;re effectively out even if you want to stay in the chair for six more months."

    "ACUITY": [
      "scaling efforts. Here, we&#39;re also tracking Acuity this morning. Acuity reporting third quarter estimates that beat the streets estimates of both the top and bottom lines here. The electrical equipment producer saw revenue jump over 20% year-over-year. The company, which makes smart lighting fixtures, saw sales top $1 billion in the latest quarter. And shares, they&#39;re ripping to the upside right now by about 6% here, sending the shares up above 300 305 now dollars a share right now intraday here, Thomas. Yeah, no question. I mean, this is a preview of coming attractions. I think we&#39;re going into this Q2 earning season with very low expectations. Sentiment is still in the gutter. If you remember the Bank of America fund manager survey from last week, institutional managers have lower sentiment that they did than they did during the COVID lows. And even going back to the great financial, it&#39;s starting to come off the bottom. But you don&#39;t top in markets when sentiment is that low among, you know, 222 managers they serve surveyed with a half a trillion dollars of assets. So they&#39;re playing catch-up and and companies like Acuity, you deliver the numbers, you&#39;re going to get bit up. Yeah, it was really interesting. Uh the chairman, president, and CEO Neil Ash saying that we grew net sales, expanded our adjusted operating profit and adjusted operating profit margin, and increased their adjusted diluted earnings per share, generated strong cash flow, allocated capital effectively. That kind of hits on all the check boxes that investors are looking for going into this report. So we want to see these beats and we want to see the the raised guidance and that&#39;s going to continue to be the theme in coming weeks. Absolutely. And",
      "Absolutely. And\nfinally  here, McCormack beating expectations for its second quarter. McCormack also reiterated its full year 2025 guidance with the company&#39;s CEO saying they have quote robust plans to mitigate current tariff related costs. That&#39;s despite several potential headwinds for the consumer staple market, including dietary changes, trade uncertainty, and inflation. You&#39;re taking a look at shares of McCormack higher by about 5.3% on the back of these results. We were talking in the break about how much I take pride in in my own seasonings and the cooking of the proteins necessarily. Uh you got to have a little flavor in there. Yeah, there&#39;s no question about it. And I&#39;m looking at, you know, I look at sectors, they call me turnaround time, I like to buy businesses that are out of favor. I&#39;m looking at consumer staples and defensives and I&#39;m you&#39;re seeing a lot in that group, whether it&#39;s Craft Hind, there was some recent news out Mills, Hormeell. Uh these are all kind of left for dead stock. So, you know, you seeing McCormick&#39;s earnings, this might be a preview of coming attractions for some of those that have kind of been uh uh unfavored of late or unseasoned of late. Uh and uh maybe coming through this earning season, they they start to get interesting, particularly when volatility picks up in the fall and money moves a little bit more defensively. So, keep your eye on consumer staples, uh packaged products and and the like. If it wasn&#39;t so hot outside, I&#39;d be ready to go outside in season with some McCormick, but it&#39;s pretty uh it&#39;s pretty toasty, so I don&#39;t need to be by the grill.

The the affordability issue and then the number of people that are also just still sitting on their homes because they got locked in at very good rates. Well, that&#39;s the problem. I mean, you run rates 200 basis points above inflation, you have unintended consequences. Number one, unaffordability for the 72 millennials who want to start a family. And number two is all these baby boomers that want to get out of their equity, but they&#39;re not going to sell a $2 million house, take out a million dollar equity, and then go into a 7% mortgage when they&#39;re in a 3% mortgage. So, I think the name of the game this summer is that the SLR is going to bring down the 10-year Treasury, 30 to 70 basis points. You&#39;re going to see 30-year fixed rate go below 6%. And at that level, I think you&#39;re going to see a huge amount of inventory. And then you look at the home builders, okay, who wants to risk capital building massive amounts of starter homes at 7% and have them sit in inventory? They can&#39;t make the investment and and this is the unintended consequence of one guy trying to protect his legacy and not be Arthur Burns.

And by the way, it&#39;s 16 housing is 16.2% of GDP. You know how many jobs that creates that are being held up by this artificially restrictive environment. Claire, last word goes to you.

McCormack also reiterated its full year 2025 guidance with the company&#39;s CEO saying they have quote robust plans to mitigate current tariff related costs. That&#39;s despite several potential headwinds for the consumer staple market, including dietary changes, trade uncertainty, and inflation. You&#39;re taking a look at shares of McCormack higher by about 5.3% on the back of these results. We were talking in the break about how much I take pride in in my own seasonings and the cooking of the proteins necessarily. Uh you got to have a little flavor in there. Yeah, there&#39;s no question about it. And I&#39;m looking at, you know, I look at sectors, they call me turnaround time, I like to buy businesses that are out of favor.

Um, I don&#39;t like it enough, but I think I think it&#39;ll work here. And we covered that in more detail back then. Another client inquiry, Patrick Kelly. Thank you for the continued hard work that you put in the weekly podcast. It&#39;s always fun to come home Thursday nights knowing that I don&#39;t have to flip through five streaming services looking for something to watch. I would be grateful if you could take a look at Robert Half. Company&#39;s got really beat up. Long history navigating challenging environments. Uh retired 23% of stocks. Clean balance sheet. Uh okay. Robert Half. I think this is a staffing business. All right. I All right. So, their revenues and cash flow are not turning yet. Uh, what does their balance sheet look like?"

      "Uh Rob Sarnataro, [Music] great show, informative yet very entertaining. My question is, what factors do you consider if a stock hits your expected target price while still in the short-term tax window? Sell and face the tax consequences or hold and risk uh downturn. Uh you know, usually we&#39;re not getting into a stock unless it&#39;s a double or triple plus. Uh, and those usually take more than 12 months, but on occasion, you&#39;ve seen it here, whether it was Vernado or others, Rolls-Royce, where they they go double or triple quicker than we anticipated. It&#39;s inside the 12-month window, and if it exceeds our target, we take the profits and eat the ordinary uh capital gains because uh, you know, we we buy things with a margin of safety and we sell them when they&#39;re at excess price and we just stick to our discipline. But the good news is our average holding period is three years. So, that&#39;s that&#39;s rarely a factor. Some take happen faster, some some uh take a little longer, but on average around three years. Uh, hey Tom, what are your thoughts on Craft Hind? Uh, yeah, we like it. We covered that last week or the week before. Uh, Leaf Foster, uh, BME in the UK, did you do any more work? No, I said it was worth you doing more work. I&#39;m not interested in it, but uh uh I thought it was worth you starting to do research if you like it."

Looking at buying gun dealers in healthc care, not the soldiers. Might want to look at GXI. Uh hard pass, huge negative free cash flow, margins declining. What is this thing do? Critical packaging and delivery systems. Yeah, not yet. I want to see more of a turn before I get interested in that. Anton from Denmark, but thanks for the question. Adrien Smith. So, I started half position in QXO the end of April with the intention of adding to it over the coming months. Since then, it&#39;s up around 85% in less than two months. Obviously, not going to complain about that, but was only able to get a half position. What do you do when a position gets away from you before you can make a meaningful position? Uh, nothing. And number one, and usually I put the whole position on it at once or at least, you know, 80 90%. If it goes lower, I add more. If it goes higher, I have what I have and that&#39;s it. I don&#39;t chase up. Uh, thank you for your great content invaluable as uh for growth as an investor.",

Cash flows never recovered to peak. Revenues margins are kind of I mean what what&#39;s the motivation here? You want to write from 25 to 50? I I wouldn&#39;t chase that. I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a great business. I don&#39;t think it has a great moat. I think it&#39;s like a fad that runs in cycles and eventually goes out of business."
