Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips WITH TOM HAYES. I'M Tom Hayes and this is your 312th videocast podcast for the week ending October 8th, 2025. We got a lot to cover this week, but as always, family first. Super excited for Mimi this morning. They announced the 2025 USA Water Polo Junior Olympics. All Americans announced. This is the top 24 uh uh water polo players in the country in her age bracket. 14 and under girls, she's 13, so she's first year. Uh so they have first team, second team, honorable mention, 24 total picks from around the country. Mimi in her first year as 14U got honorable mention which is just amazing uh and bodess very very well for her second year uh to to move up the ranks. So really really proud of her was her idea to move out to California. She's making every bit of the opportunity and just getting started. So super proud of you, Mimi. Uh, and while Mimi was up in Santa Barbara with Caitlyn for water polo games this weekend, uh, Annabelle and I did Cars and Coffee at the club. Uh, this picture right here is in front of, uh, uh, David Lee's Ferrari. Uh, David Lee is one of the top Ferrari collectors in the United States. Like a 70 or 100 million dollar personal collection. Um he's on Jay Leno Garage show uh very frequently and this 1964 Ferrari 250 GT Luso Competicion uh is one of four in the United States. So it was super excited to uh see that and uh all the other cars and participate etc. This was at the local MAC. Mac is owned by Estee Lauder. They just signed a deal with Chris Jenner of the Kardashians, who is now the spokeswoman for this particular product for for Mac. So, they are booming and that could explain. This was at the Air Show in Huntington Beach uh at uh my friend Kenny Bennett's house. Uh thanks for including me in that. Um, and then Mimi. Uh, we got a couple quick goals here. Okay, here's the first one with Mimi. Look at that pass from Leila, the goalie. And then Mimi just puts it away. Super excited there. And then here's the second one, which was I think was a five meter. Yep, there's Mimi. Boom. Throwing a little heat skip shot action. Uh, so super excited for that. Uh, here are some picture. I couldn't get the video uploaded, but just look at the formation of these planes during the air show 531. And they held this. I'd like to thank Christian Dagger and Payton Jennings for having me on Varnney and Co. Fox Business this week to talk to Stu. We're going to listen in here. >> Record highs at the close yesterday, moving up a little bit more this morning. Dow up 70, NASDAQ up 50. Thomas Hayes joins me. Uh Tom, some people on this program have called this the market situation. They've called it a melt up. You don't agree with that, do you? >> Well, you know, Warren Buffett once said, "Be fearful when others are greedy." We have built a little bit of cash going into earnings season. You know, there are a few billionaires making the rounds on on TV, telling you we're going to have a meltup after a 40% rally off the bottoms. These are the same billionaires that were telling you to sell in the hole in early April after we were down 20% because we were going to have a meltdown. There's a little bit of froth in the AI trade. Uh first off, you've got record call buying. 40 million contracts per day for the last 20 consecutive sessions. The last time we had that was late 2021, early 2022. It didn't end well. I'm not calling for a major correction. I think we're going to get a little consolidation in earnings. Uh capex as a percentage of free cash flow for the hyperscalers is now 60% up from 10% just a few years ago. That's impacting margins and earnings growth. And finally, uh MAG 7 earnings growth this quarter for the first time is going to have it was 32% last quarter uh last year. This quarter it's going to be less than 15%. This quarter I think people are are not really ready for that. The multiples haven't contracted. So we expect a few bumps in coming weeks followed by a year-end rally still. >> Okay. Um why do you like Diagio? I know that's on your list of things to buy, but it's a it's a liquor company, a wine and beer and liquor company, and we're we're all drinking less. Why do you like that stock? >> Yeah. Well, we like to buy straw hats in winter and sell them in summer when everyone wants them. Uh, you know, I think people are going to need a couple drinks if their AI stocks get hit in coming weeks. Uh, but really, uh, this is a recovery play. They've had a hangover from COVID. They overstocked in CO. Uh, Dagio benefits from the premiumization. To your point, people are drinking less, but they're drinking better. They've got Guinness. They've got Johnny Walker. They've got Captain Morgan. management is targeting $3 billion of free cash flow for the first year since COVID. They're returning to growth. Sales are growing. They're non-alcoholic business is growing 40%. Uh and they're holding market share in in all their markets. So, we like this story as a defensive play to get you through a little short-term volatility over over the next few months. >> Right, Tom? You've got 15 seconds to tell me why you like Estee Lauder. That's all you got. Go. Estee Lauder, Clinique, Mac, Avita, Estee Lauder. They just did a partnership with Chris Jenner. This is another turnaround story from Turnaround Tom. Margins are up to 74% because they've shifted a lot of that travel retail to online e-commerce. Their e-commerce business is 31% of sales, up from 20%. So, let's put some makeup on and let's make it happen. >> You You tried, but you went way over your allotted time frame. We'll let you go. Thomas Hayes, thanks very much indeed. Okay. And we're back. And of course, thanks to the great Stuart Vanney. And I'd like to thank Alli Thompson for having me on the Schwab Network today with Nicole Pedalites. We're going to listen in here. >> Jay Hayes is with me, chairman, managing member, Great Hill Capital. Joining me taking a look. We've seen all four of the major averages hitting some records over the last week or so. How do you feel about that? Because it was more than 30 records for the S&P 500 closing on Monday. um amazing year. What do you think is happening here? >> Well, Nicole, thanks for having me and uh as you know on your station, I've been one of the more bullish guests for many many months and uh and we were aggressive aggressive buyers in the hole in April. uh and have ridden this entire rally. And and what we've seen in the last few days is a few famous billionaires making the rounds after a 40% rally off the bottom now calling for a meltup beyond. Uh I think people need to be cautious and keep in mind these were the same billionaires making the rounds in early April when the market was down 20% telling you to get out of your stocks because we were going to have a further meltdown. So opinion follows trend. Uh this is the first time in a long time that we've been a little bit cautious. Uh nothing crazy, but we have raised a little cash. We follow Warren Buffett's maxim be fearful when others are greedy. And right now we're in an information vacuum going into earnings. And I think some of the things that we're going to see in earnings, Nicole, uh may create opportunities uh to to get some stocks a bit cheaper. uh prior to year end when we uh recover and probably have a year-end rally, but I I do expect some volatility in coming weeks as earning season begins. >> Do you change the strategy at all from a more bullish strategy to something that's a little more cautious? >> Yeah, I mean, we did it by raising a little bit of cash, nothing crazy. We have some put spreads on indices as a hedge, very small percentage of equity in the portfolio. And then we're predominantly long with the rest of the positions that are not fully valued. But we we look at a few different things, Nicole. First and foremost, uh and many of your uh audience are into options. Well, we have record call buying. 40 million contracts per day for the last 20 days, 20 sessions. Uh the last time we saw anything close to that type of volume was very late 2021 and early 2022. and that preceded a pretty aggressive draw down in equities. We're not calling for an aggressive draw down in equities. We are calling for some short-term volatility with this froth. The other thing that we're looking at, Nicole, that gives us some caution is capex as a percentage of free cash flow among the hyperscalers is now at 60%. Some people call that bullish. That's up from 10% just a handful of years. What we're finding is it's crowding out. Number one, earnings growth is decelerating aggressively. Uh because of this margins are getting impacted and the ability to buy back stock is getting impacted. So what we're going to see in this earning season, which is one of the reasons we're cautious, is with the MAG 7, their earnings growth has more than have in the last 12 months. So this quarter last year MAG7 earnings growth was 32%. This quarter it will be below 15%. Uh you know and and that's okay except for the fact that the multiples on the MAG 7 have not contracted commensurate with the dramatic deceleration in earnings growth. So we're coming up against the law of large numbers. uh guidance will have to be sensational uh in the face of decelerating earnings growth in order for there to be zero impact in this earning season. And and that's why we want to raise a little cash and be in an opportunity to buy prior to year end where when we regain strength. But those are those are some of the reasons that we're a little cautious, have a little bit of cash on the sideline after being so bullish for so long, which has worked out very well. Let's talk about the names you like here. Estee Lauder and Dagio. Tell us a little bit about those two names. And when you do picks, are you thinking 10 20% over a year or a year and a half? I mean, tell us where you think they're headed and why. >> Yeah, I I think that's fair. So, the one thing you can note about these is they're both defensive stocks. These are consumer staples. And um the last time staples have traded this low on a relative valuation to the S&P 500 relative performance was in the early 2000s, 20201. And if you remember, Nicole, well, you're probably too young, but uh if you remember, there were covers uh all over the place, whether it was Baronss, whether it was Fortune saying, "Has Warren Buffett lost his touch?" Because while everyone was chasing global crossing and chasing Cisco and chasing the the uh pets.com of the day, Warren Buffett was buying boring defensive stocks like Proctor and Gamble, like Disney, things that no one wanted during the tech boom. And over the subsequent four years when the NASDAQ corrected 80 to 90% from 2000 to 2003, Warren Buffett was actually had record performance 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 because he was accumulating all these defensive boring stocks when no one wanted them. And I think that's a similar situation. I don't think we're going to get any type of correction like that with the NASDAQ because there's free cash flow. Uh back in 2000 there there was a lot less free cash flow. Uh but owning some of these defensives is going to serve you well because they're so cheap. Uh Dagio for instance is just getting out of its COVID hangover. Uh their um Spirits company, high-end spirits company, Guinness, Johnny Walker, Captain Morgan, Smeirnoff, etc. Uh you know, if people's AI stocks get hit a little bit here, they're going to need a few drinks. But more seriously, management's targeting three billion of free cash flow. They've done uh going for 625 million in cost cuts. They're finally after a few years postcoid hangover returning to growth. Sales are rising again after the COVID hangover. Their non-alcoholic beverage business is growing at 40% and they're holding market share percentages in all their key markets. So that's that's on Dagio. Uh we our average holding period is 3 to 5 years, Nicole. So on on any of these type of stocks like Dagio, we're looking for a double over 3 to 5 years. As it relates to Estee Lauder, one of the best uh aggregators of high-end skincare brands and and personal care brands. They've got Estee Lauder Clinique. MAC MAC just did a partnership with Chris Jenner is sponsoring that brand of the Kardashians. Avida, Dr. Jart for the young people. My daughters used Dr. Jart. Another turnaround story, they got hurt because they were so concentrated in travel retail. If you think about the stores and the airports, etc. That obviously got crushed during COVID. They've moved now. They've got 31% of their business online, up from 20%, their margins are increasing dramatically. They're returning to growth this year, 2 to 5% uh organic sales growth and management targeting 1 to 1.1 billion of operating cash flow. So, we love these turnaround stories as potential doubles over the next 3 to four years, and we think the time is right when when no one wants them. >> Potential doubles. We like to hear that. Thomas J. Hayes, chairman, managing member, Great Hill Capital. Thank you so much for being with us. >> Moving along, uh, quote of the week from Buffett. Our eyes are placed in the front because it's more important to look ahead than to look back. A lot of people get faked out by recency bias extrapolating what's happened in the recent past will persist. We're going to talk about some of that. Buffett, we don't have to be smarter than the rest. We need to be more disciplined than the rest. And then finally, want to thank all the folks that have been tons of folks have been placing orders for the hats and the mugs and the uh hoodies, which are incredible, and the t-shirts and the golf shirts. Um, and uh, all everyone who's been sending in all these amazing photos, just keep it up. We get in a lot more orders than photos. Do send the photos so people can see you're part of the community. And the reason we do that again is not for the six or seven bucks that we make on a hat. Is if you're getting value from this podcast, and I know so many of you are, I appreciate all the incredible testimonials that you put in each week uh, under the YouTube videos and everywhere else. Um it's so that we can keep doing this for non-clients because we're growing and the way we grow is if you're getting value, share it with one or two uh people that you know that would benefit from this. I can't tell you the number of clients who have come in um from just referrals of people that have been longtime listeners and maybe couldn't afford to come in and then uh one thing leads to the next leads to the next. So, I'm very very grateful for all of you sharing and that's why we continue to do this every week and leave it all out on the field and give you as much value in as short a period of time. Well, I don't know about short short period of time these things tend to run, but uh we stay for all the ask me anything questions and uh we're very very grateful. So, uh let's get down to some data. Uh this from Dietrich over at Carson. New highs in October are a good sign. uh it implies a strong fourth quarter. We're not averse to that viewpoint. Uh actually that would be our preference. Uh but we have raised a little bit of cash going into the earning season for the reasons we described with Stu. And you'll also see on the website later today, I did a longer version of what I did Stu with Stu on Schwab Network. I will try to squeeze it into this podcast uh if they get it posted in time. Otherwise, you can find it at hedgefundtips.com. By the way, while you're at hedge funips.com, click on terms. Uh, this is all opinion, not advice. Talk to your financial adviser, etc. And then finally, for those of you who read the article of the week this morning, we are closing out our uh fourth quarter raise for $1 million accounts um uh on October 11th. So, three more days. This is the last time to come in at the million-doll level for 2025. We will not be opening up again to small accounts until early 2026. The $5 million plus accounts and beyond can come in whenever they want. Uh and you do so by clicking on money management. Uh fill in your information here and then um we will call you back to see if it's a fit. uh not a not a solicitation. Talk with your psychic, financial advisor, whoever you need to consult with uh and uh before we have that conversation is fine. Moving along, consumer staples to the S&P 500 ratio of relative performance is the lowest since 2000. This is a four three four times in a 100redyear opportunity which is why we were talking about our holdings uh Diagio and Estee Lauder. For those of you who don't think Estee Lauder is a consumer staple uh you do not have enough women in your life this is not a discretionary expense. This is a necessity. Uh whether it's Estee Lauder Clinique prescript prescriptives Mac Dr. Jart, Avita, etc. Next, this is the data from Goldman Sachs which we talked about um with regard to with regard to call volume over the last 20 sessions was 40 contracts 40 million contracts per day. We haven't seen anything close to this since late 2021 to early 2022. Uh where there was a pullback in the high-flying stocks. And that's why you're seeing staples. there's such a high-flying um exuberance right now in the market that okay so this is the period that Buffett was buying all of the consumer staples whether it was uh you know conservative stocks whether it was Proctor and Gamble whether it was Coke whether it was Disney while everyone was chasing the highf flyers with with reckless abandon in uh he was buying these and over the next four years when the NASDAQ was down 80 to 90% uh he had among his best four years ever while the market was crashing the defenses were going up. So when you get these opportunities to buy defensives, whether it's healthcare, whether it's staples, we take advantage and you will see across the portfolios that you have the proper exposure in both healthcare and defensives and obviously other uh risk beneficiaries, but not these that are going to get hit the most as we go into earnings season. Here is domestic sales versus international sales. Um, foreign versus domestic sales. So again, you're getting back to an extreme not since seen since 2010. Uh, here is probabilities favor stocks higher. That's looking into the fourth quarter thesis from Ryan Dietrich. I think we get some short-term bumps before that, but I do see some strength into year end. Uh, and we've been pretty consistent about that. Here is the US housing affordability index remains low. We have not seen housing affordability this low since 2006 through 2008. and it looks like it's putting in that same type of inverse bottom uh before housing became very affordable. And we've had a thesis that um as rates come down, there's going to be an enormous amount of supply that hits the market all at once. And why is that? It's because what you're seeing is a number one case shiller drop. Number two, the bids are no longer coming in above ask. they're coming in below ask. And once you see if you've got a couple million dollars of equity in your house that you paid, you know, a hundred thousand for in 1975 or 1981 and now it's worth three or four million bucks. Uh if your neighbor who listed their house at you know 35 is now once you see a comp where a 35 ass becomes 29 you panic and you say if you know and these are 65 75 year old people kids are out of the house they don't need six bedrooms um and you see that type of marktomarket it's just like the stock market they panic and they all hit at once because they want to get out while the getting's good out of fear that all of that equity is going to evaporate and they need that money and they don't need the house. So, I think that's something to keep in mind in coming years as rates come down is normally when rates come down, house prices go up. Why it's different this time is you have to consider what age is all of that equity? What is the average age of the person that all of that equity is trapped in? And it's a lot of boomers that don't need the house and do need the money. Um and uh and they want to hold out for the last penny until you start to see these marktomarket comps panic them into the market all at once to take what they can get and that's where the affordability starts to happen. Uh how much of the S&P 500 is related to AI stocks? 46%. Uh large tech companies are tying their fortunes to open AI. This chart from the Financial Times kind of speaks to the circularity of some of the deals. We've seen Nvidia giving money to their clients and investing in their clients and that money comes back to Nvidia as the form of chips. A lot of circular shenanigans starting to happen. Uh it doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad thing, but it is something that you see towards the top. I think it's speaking volumes that in the face of the skepticism around some of these circular deals that Jensen Wong is out making the rounds. Uh did an hour on CNBC yesterday, an hour on CNBC today. If business is so good, why do you need to be on, you know, doing two hours kind of defending the position of all that stuff? So that dos protestth uh maybe a little too much. So just keep it in mind. Here's a note. Nvidia has announced strategic partnerships. The open AI these announcements has sparked investor debate around the nature of the deals and the extent to which Nvidia's equity investments could be recycled by investees as GPU spending recognized by Nvidia as circular revenue. The sustainability of OpenAI's infrastructure spending will increasingly depend on equity and debt financing. Given OpenAI's public comments on planned infrastructure investments, self-built data centers, uh, with Nvidia GPU, Stargate funding, Oracle contracts, we believe it will increasingly need to rely on equity debt raises worth up to $75 billion in 2026 alone. Thus far, these projects, such as Oracle's $18 billion debt raise to support Open AI, appear to be gaining strong market traction. We view potential quote unquote circular revenue from strategic investments as potentially dilutive to Nvidia's multiple. As with any strategic investment in a customer which is not self- financing, we believe investors will focus on the fundamentals of that customer. When equity investment comes from a supplier, we believe additional scrutiny is warranted given the circular nature of the revenue because the investor's dual role as investor supplier. It's a shell game. If you're in New York City, uh, and you see these guys, they turn the buckets upside down for the tourists and they have the three shells and they have the marble in the one shell and they move their hands really quickly and hope you don't notice where the marble is. Uh, it's no different. This is just higher stakes shell game. AI related firms have issued a record $141 billion this year. Uh, when the ducks are quacking, feed them. That's exactly what's happening. When strate strategic targets are less than the S&P at the end of Q3, Q4 is almost always positive. I think that's probably the case this year. I think we're down then up. Households of all ages enjoy more liquidity, less debt. Household balance sheets very strong. Overhang in liquid assets to net worth keeps economy afloat. You'll see more and more HELOC start to come in. This is the chart that I referenced in terms of uh hyperscalers capital spending now exceeding 60% of free cash flow. This is up from 10% uh just a number of years ago. This is impacting margins and it's impacting earnings growth. And that's why we're seeing the deceleration from 32% uh third quarter of 2024 to what will be less than 15% uh third quarter 2025 I aka having in earnings growth and yet the multiple has so far held up. We think that multiple should start to reduce on the basis of the information that's coming out in the next handful of weeks. Uh attractive healthcare valuations. This is in line with our staples thesis. The time to buy these was uh in these instances like 2020, like uh 200 going into 2008, like 2000, same thing. healthcare and staples. Same type of theme, same type of opportunity. Restaurant index nearing multi-year support. Well, they're calling this a violation. I'm calling it an opportunity. That's the one area that we've wanted to take advantage of some of the dislocation and have yet to uh as of the time of this podcast. We are looking at a number of restaurants. As beef prices come down, some of these restaurants are going to boom. Uh, so we're going to try to figure out if there's a way to get exposure and fit it into the portfolio, but we don't want to get too diluted. So, we're not in a pound the table rush, but uh, we do see opportunity in some of the beaten down restaurant stocks. International outperforming US stocks in 2025. Um, this was the same type of scenario we saw during the internet bubble. uh as international started to outperform the internet bubble started to wind down. Uh same thing with the nifty50 in 1966 the previous decade from 1958 to 1966 uh was all tech all the time all US all the time and that started to deflate from 66 to 73. Note that the bull market even though some air was let out of the nifty50 the bull market continued to 1973. So for another 7 years even though the bubble was deflating the other stocks were picking up the slack. Number of US listed companies in secular decline. Uh this is a function of Sarbain Oxley that needs to be unwound. That was a knee-jerk reaction to the tech wreck in the early 2000s. Uh it's kept more pe companies private. It's uh disappointing and hopefully the Trump administration will roll back Sarbain Oxley and you'll see this number from 7,000 public companies in 1998 to 2,000, maybe move back up to 6,000. Here is a chart from Seth Goldening to the same thing. staples relative to the S&P 500, cheapest since 2000. That's why we have our Dagios, that's why we have our Estee Lauder. That's why we have our Hormells, uh, Baxers on the Healthcare. So, these are all, you can't give them away right now. Uh, that will change very, very quickly as some error comes out of the AI trade. Here is the data on the earnings. You can see Magnificent 7 Q3 of 2024, 32% earnings growth. Um and now that this will be the first and the other thing is like people almost don't believe it because it was you know 50% in Q1 in 2024 35 32 31 28 28 so last quarter 28% earnings growth for the max 7 makes sense that the multiple is still over 30 times 33 times for the basket but this is going to be the first quarter where they collapse and they collapse down to 14% and it's people are going to wake up and say, "Wait a second. These circular deals, why is Jensen out, you know, pitching every single day?" It's because this, ladies and gentlemen, is the name of the game. Uh, a huge deceleration in earnings growth. People are starting to see all investment, no return on that investment, no imminent return on that investment. So, guidance will have to be absolutely spectacular uh for the multiple to stay where it is with the earnings growth having. I don't see that happening which is why we've uh raised a little bit of cash in um and are ready to deploy in coming weeks and then we'll see the unmagnificent 493 international some of these left for dead sectors staples healthcare energy materials uh small caps all start to get the bid from these overvalued areas. More good news for Q4. So this is Carson. Homeowner equity is at its highest it's been since the late 1950s. Higher than the great financial crisis. Uh 2006, 2007, 2008. Higher than the 70s. So um this is what you have to keep in mind. All this equity is going to hit the market at once. And that's why as rates go down, supply price prices prices are actually going to go down, which will be the first time, which is counterintuitive. Uh healthc care sector, uh two-day rate of change, so it's starting to recover here. Uh transports looks like it's breaking out of this long-term cup and handle. You know, it's funny. We've continued to look at UPS non-stop. We want to invest in UPS. We think UPS will be great. Uh, and I couldn't figure out why I was not pulling the trigger for so long. Uh, and um, the conclusion that I drew, uh, and it just hit me like a ton of bricks is because the CEO and she was a phenomenal uh, CFO for Home Depot for many, many years. I don't think she's a good CEO and we won't be making any investment in um UPS until she retires. She retired from Home Depot in 2020 at 63. She was on the board of UPS and they recruited her or she became CEO of UPS. Uh she's now 68. So, there is more than adequate reason for her wanting to step down, go off into the sunset, but until the board actually pulls the trigger on that. Uh, we're a pass. It's not to say the stock can't go up with her as the CEO. I think it can. I think it's ready to go up, but I think the catalyst would be a new CEO. And if we saw that, we'd be inclined to pounce um where we could. But, um, that's one that I continue to want to get involved in. and and now uh after doing more work on it understand why I haven't and uh what will be the thing that makes me want to do that. That's number one. Number two is I really don't want two logistics plays because we have GXO so we're kind of already exposed there and there's no value of having a 30 stock portfolio. You're not going to outperform with more than 15 stocks. The math just doesn't work and we prefer to keep it between 8 to 12 per per client but um when we can. Here's the transport seasonality. So, yeah, UPS will probably fly here, but so will our GXO. The seasonality favors transports, but should help Boeing uh as well. Uh here we got 17 uh this is key. 17% of home sellers dropped their asking price in the month of August. This is in line with my thesis for the supply hitting the market. As prices get dropped, uh, you start to get bad mark tom markets. As you start to get bad mark to markets, more people hit the market all at once and, um, the affordability is going to go up and no one expects it. Uh, S&P 500 realized stock correlation is now back to very low levels. which favors stock pickers. That's from Goldman Sachs. About 60% of the items in the CPI basket show at least a 3% price increase. Uh this is the impact of the short-term tariff bump. Here is the length and severity of bare and subsequent bull markets. So you can see here um the number of months of the average bull market and we are in early days because this bull market started in 2022 after a 20% correction. This is probably the most important chart I've saw this week uh of the Russell 2000 for macro charts. And what you're seeing here is the small caps breaking out of a long-term consolidation period aka cup and handle. But you can see here going back 40 some odd years. Every time it breaks out the the type of moves that you have uh can be staggering. And we're just now breaking out. So after some maybe short-term consolidation into year end we should see a lot of strength in small caps which we love. Uh equal weighted same story just breaking out I think cap weighted getting ready for a rest and that's where money will go. S&P 2 Russell 2000 versus the S&P 500 breaking out after a long-term base and consolidation that's going to continue. Here's the cap weighted S&P 500 aka the MAG7 index I like to call it. Um you can see here the divergence with skew uh now breaking down. This tends to imply a catchup or a catch down of the S&P 500. We shall see. I think I think there will be some some chop which is why we have some cash on the sidelines but not all cash on the sidelines obviously because we have exposure for those type of companies that will do well if we get some short-term chop and as the money rotates out of the indices aka mag 7 uh our stocks will be beneficiaries u so that's why we have modest amounts of cash not massive amounts of cash. Uh because what we own will actually show strength in a period where the general indices show um volatility, which again sounds counterintuitive, but the sign of a great investor is usually one that can hold two conflicting thoughts in mind at the same time and still take proper action. And that's a very rare combination. Uh Barkclay's indicator suggests more gains ahead. Okay, I think that's right over the intermediate term. I think it's probably uh incorrect in the short term, but we shall see. Uh economic activity running along trend, no sign of deterioration, typical of a recession. We agree. I think the general economy is doing great. It's going to continue to do great. Here's more on uh Q4 seasonality. Agreed. But um you also have to keep in mind that this year has not followed the normal seasonal path uh with a lot of the losses being pulled into April versus September or October. Uh and a lot of the gains now being drawn into September whereas September is usually weak. So whether we get the same type of Q4 strength uh remains to be seen. That's equity positioning. Russell 2K versus S&P funding. Energy is the most underweight sector versus history. Latest long only sector exposure as the zcore versus history as of August 2025. So these again staples materials health care energy is is uh is some opportunity in our view. overweight health care from underweight. Let's see here. Health care has been purged by long onlyies. Uh going back to levels not seen since the great financial crisis in 2009. That's time to be buyer, not a seller. Healthcare relative forward price to earnings ratio is the lowest it's been in more than 40 years. Um, you can see here that's the forward PE versus the S&P 500 now trading at 7 times the multiple. So, call it 16 times versus 23 times give or take. Uh, and you haven't seen that literally. The last time you saw that was in the COVID lows. You bought healthcare, you made a fortune. 2009 lows, same thing. And then going back to 1993 lows on track for a record year in healthcare. M&A Henry hub natural. By the way, these two charts, you got to put labels on it. Uh demand for what? Henry Hub natural gas price and NX futures price starting to get bid. That's helpful for comtock. Energy consumption hitting records. That's going to help comtock. It's going to help natural oil. Well, Varco Nov um forward GDP now estimate for Q3 going up that's positive to see 3.8% 8% corporate insider corporate insider buy to sell ratio for healthcare. Uh you can see this dip in healthcare and insiders have been buying it like nobody's business and that's historically been a good time to buy. Biotech now breaking out of this long multi-year base. We own X a basket of biotech XBI. So, we're excited. Uh the short interest is um it's what they call epic squeeze loading, meaning the short interest has never been higher at these lows. You haven't seen this since 2020. And then you had 175% move in the XBI in one year after it came off the boil. This is a super important chart from Trend Labs. Um pay close attention. And this is in line with our healthcare theme. We own XBI. Uh we own Baxter in that space. And I think all of them are are pointing to the exact same thing. Fed rate cuts non-recessionary. Boom. We've covered this 17% 12 months later. How you get to that 17 may be another story. Uh equal weight and so on. So that's some data for the week. Let's go through the headlines. FOMO bills as Alibaba extends $250 billion AI fueled comeback. Uh there you go. So just as everyone's getting excited and some of the big names are chasing up after it's up 3x off the bottom. Uh expect a rest. That's just exactly what's going to happen. Uh and I hope it pulls back 20 points, get all the Johnny come lately out. Uh and then the final move uh parabolic move uh a lot higher. Alibaba's AAP hits 400 million users with new AI ranking feature in local services push. Alibaba's Quen technology lead sets up inhouse robot AI team. World Bank raises China growth forecast to 4.8% despite US trade tensions. Uh emerging markets roar back with biggest stock rally in 15 years. This surprised everyone except for the incredible viewers of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. You guys were prepared for this. This was a table pounding theme in late 2024. Foreign investors I China once again, but capital controls and policy risk keep them on edge. This is what we call climbing the wall of worry. They are screwed. They are behind the eightball.

Uh, that's a lot of energy they're going to need for that. Uh, PayPal's Honey to integrate with Chat GPT and other AIS for shopping assistance. So, this has been positive for uh, PayPal this week. The other thing you need to know is Alex Chris has a long-term relationship with um with the um with Altman from Open AI from the World Coin days which was Altman's last project uh and Alex Chris's uh days both at PayPal and prior to that at into it. So I could see a lot more announcements coming forward potentially between PayPal and OpenAI similar to what we saw from Etsy and Open AI which is uh aka Chat GPT which is very very promising. PayPal unleashes the power of retail media for small business enabling them to join billiondoll advertising boom. This is such a high margin business. When Amazon did this on their platform, it was gamechanging for margins and revenues and earnings. Intel to reveal tech details on forthcoming PC chip. One thing I will say about Jensen Wong is that he was very positive on Intel in his hour uh talk with Jim Kramer yesterday on CNBC. So, that's positive to see. energy companies to spend $50 billion on US pipelines as they tap into natural gas boom that helps our comm stock.

That game is just getting started which will benefit Generrack and Stanley Black & Decker and QXO which we're going to talk about today. Exclusive Trump considering significant tax relief for US vehicle production. Senator says, "By the way, a bunch of you have asked about the Novel Fire, which put out the aluminum plant which affects 40% of Ford's production. Uh it's no wonder that Cooper Standard has been down in the last few days. And the answer is it'll get resolved when it gets resolved. It doesn't change the underlying thesis. It just pushes it forward. So, you know, do you want to sell it at 32 thinking it could go to 25 before it goes to 80? Yeah, you could play that game. Number one, you're going to pay a lot of taxes. Number two, if you're wrong, uh, and they say, "Hey, we got aluminum from somewhere else or the plant's going to get back online faster than expected," then you sold at 28 and, uh, the stocks at 40 one morning pre-market and you're screwed. So, you know, if you can't take a little short-term volatility, you shouldn't even be doing this, you know, in this game. Um, the key is what is the value of the underlying business and whether that's delayed four months or not is completely immaterial to the long-term thesis. So, you just ride it out. Uh, and don't focus on things you can't control. Uh, you can't predict when fires are going to come in aluminum plants. You can't predict when they're going to get it back online. You can't predict where they're going to get the supply otherwise. But I can tell you for damn sure, Ford is working day and night to get new sources of aluminum. And I can guarantee you they're going to find new sources of aluminum uh at whatever price to keep the production up because the demand is there. But um, in the meantime, people shoot first, ask questions later. And um uh that's that. The 2025 box office is headed for its best co postcoid hall as winter releases heat up. We love that for Disney um which has been consolidating but uh quite up a lot off of its lows. Uh biotech stocks are up. The sector is looking better than it has in years. That's from Baron.

Uh Goldman's Ken says S&P 500 firms to beat low earnings bar. We agree expectations are 78% for this quarter. They will beat. The question is what is the composition of those beats? Is it concentrated in the 493 or is it concentrated in the seven? Uh no matter how you slice it, having your earnings growth and keeping the same multiple is usually not a formula for good things to come. Uh article of the week, breaking the ice stock market and sentiment results. Uh Canada Goose update. I mean, look at this. First off, you know, we're excited that the stock's up so much, but we're more excited that the cash flow is at record highs, record high cash flow, and the stock is still down some 70% off of its peak in 2018. Record revenues, record free cash flow. Can't give away the stock. Formula for a turnaround time special. Yeah, we're already up a lot, but I think it's early days. Uh, so let's go through some of the updates. As the saying goes, by the way, if you're listening and you can't see this, I feel sorry for you because if you can visual, first off, I don't feel sorry for you because a lot of you are super busy and the only way you can participate is to listen while you walk or run or play golf or whatever you do. Uh, and that's great. I would just say you would get 50% more value if you could view it on YouTube uh and see all of this stuff and uh so if you if you imagine the amount of value that you've got just listening imagine the amount of value extra value you would have gotten by being able to see all these data charts and all these things and understanding it because when you see what I'm looking at right here and you see the stock price you see that there's still as as great as we've done with this it's hasn't even begun. Um, as the saying goes, if public markets don't value a business properly, an acquirer eventually will. Sure enough, Canada Goose reportedly found itself on the receiving end of multiple private takeover bids, valuing the company at roughly 1.4 billion or $14 a share. Management has since publicly declined the takeover speculation, noting they have no intention of being taken private. Thank God. Hallelujah. That is music to our ears, and we're happy the board came to its senses. That's because despite what feels like a huge move off the bottom, doubling from April lows, we didn't get involved in the stock for a 50% gain. Frankly, a private buyout at those levels would have been highway robbery robbery relative to the potential we continue to see over the next couple of years. Thankfully, Goose is led by a CEO and chairman from the founding family who owns 39.5% of the company. With that kind of skin in the game, management tends to respect shareholder equity and think beyond tomorrow's newspaper. Exactly why we invested in a company of this caliber to begin with. At the end of the day, this is a name that went from a flashy growth story to a left for dead value story when we initiated. And we believe it has all the right pieces to return to that growth story as management executes its turnaround plan and gets a little help from the ongoing China recovery and pivot toward consumption. Over the past few quarters, we have seen management execute the turnaround exactly as promised and then some. The name of the game with the goose turnaround starts with reducing exposure to wholesale and leaning into high margin DTC stores which have grown from 29% of total revenues in 2017 to nearly 74% in the past fiscal year. With that shift comes a far more attractive margin profile as DTC typically commands mid70% margins compared with mid to high 40% margins for wholesale. The long-term fiscal year 2028 target remains 80% DTC mix which management expects will deliver gross margin margins consistently north of 70%. There is no doubt Goose is well on its way toward both DTC mix. Gross margins and free cash flow are all at record highs, supported by cleaned up inventories and a strong balance sheet. These are all the signs we want to see in any turnaround. And for that alone, the market has already rewarded us handsomely. But the next leg of the turnaround is where the real upside lies. And if successful, it is where we continue to see 3 to 4x potential come into play. Right now, when most people think of of Canada Goose, they think of thousand plus luxury parkas. Management is working overtime to change that narrative, turning Goose from a one-time purchase winter only luxury parker brand into an allseason 365day relevant brand. They have already doubled the mix and update of updated and brand new styles bringing more novelty than ever. Whether it's rain jackets, eyewear, shoes, or warm weather clothing, Canada Goose now has it. Most importantly, consumers can't get enough with apparel not only becoming the fastest growing category, but also driving stronger growth in core outerwear. Turning Goose into a four season brand is not only a massive opportunity to grow and scale the business, it also opens the door for significant operating leverage and margin expansion. Hence the exact reason we continue to see these supported takeout supposed takeout bids of $14 per share as an insult to the opportunity this stock offers. Here's a great Wall Street Journal article from a few weeks ago breaking down Canada Goose's four season strategy. You can go through that. We think as the market starts to sniff out the luxury comeback, especially as the Chinese consumers open their wallets and pivot towards consumption, this is a stock that will get bid. Couple that with the start of a Fed easing cycle, and this is exactly the type of luxury name we want exposure to, expecting it to be a big winner over the next several years. So, here's Q1 earnings breakdown. You can go through that on hedge funips.com. Uh 10 key points. Number one, Canada Goose reported Q1 revenue of 107.8 million, up 22.4% year-over-year and beating street estimates by 11.1 million, a 16.7% upside surprise. How you doing? Number two, direct to consumer, DTC continues to be a standout with DTC revenue up 24% to 78.1 million driven by 14.8% 8% comp store sales growth led by strength in mainland China and North America. Most importantly, DTC now represents nearly 73% of overall revenue compared to just 29% in 2017, which comes with a far more attractive margin profile. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of positive DTC comp sales growth with Q1 store conversion rates also higher year-over-year in every single region. Three, gross margins continued to benefit from the push into DTC rising 61.4% 4% from 59.7% the prior year period plus 170 basis points driven by margin expansion from the company's European manufacturing facility pricing product and channel mix had minimal impact during the quarter implying that even with record production newness nearly doubling the mix of new items these additions remain accretive to the overall margin profile four SGNA expenses came in at 224.9 million during this quarter up nearly 50% % year-on-year from 149.5 million in the prior year period. This was primarily driven by a one-time financial award of 44 million resulting from a resolution of an arbitration with a former supplier. Excluding the one-time charge, SGNA was up 16% year-over-year, well below overall revenue growth, representing a 850 basis points improvement as a percentage of revenue. Management continues to focus on expense management and staying lean, and they expect this will drive significant EBIT margin expansion over time. Five, the wholesale segment, which has faced significant pressure over the past couple years, down 16.5% during fiscal year 2025. As Goose focuses on DTC expansion, posted revenue growth of 11.9% to uh $17.9 million. Management expects the segment to maintain stable performance for the full year with the orderbook response remaining strong and continuing to grow. Over the long term, management still views the channel as important for the brand and a meaningful growth opportunity. Six, during the quarter, management launched the spring summer 2025 collection designed to make offerings more seasonally relevant and also introduced the second snow goose capsule. Both campaigns drove strong consumer engagement lifts in earned media and follower growth. clear signals that the campaigns landed with Goose introducing more newness than ever before. Apparel has become the company's fastest growing category while also boosting revenue growth in core outerwear products and increasing overall basket size. Management still has several campaign drops scheduled, including a fall snow goose capsule 7. At the end of the quarter, net debt stood at 541 million compared to 765 million in the prior year period, reducing net leverage to 1.8 times from 2.8 times. The improvement was driven by lower borrowings from credit facilities, strong operating cash flow, and a higher cash balance, which now stands at $180 million or 13% of the company's overall market cap. Eight. Canada Goose continues to clean up its inventory position, reducing it to 439 million, down 9% year-over-year, driven by higher demand and proactive inventory management. This marks the seventh consecutive quarter of year-on-year inventory declines with Q1 inventory turns rising 2.9 times from8 times last fiscal year. Nine, Canada Goose remains largely immune to tariffs with 75% of its units manufactured in Canada and nearly all meeting USMCA requirements for European products that are exposed. management is paying modestly higher tariffs but still expects the fullear impact to be minimal. And 10 can Canada Goose's total permanent store count now stands at 76 with two net new stores added during the quarter. Management expects continues to expect total net store openings to exceed fiscal year 2025 levels for the full year. You can go through the earnings call highlights here. We underlined all the important things for you. And on to the QXO update. A few weeks ago, Brad Jacobs fielded investor questions at a conference laying out the QXO playbook and how he plans to build a $50 billion plus powerhouse within the 800 billion building products distribution industry. As we've said time and time again, and especially after spending time with Brad himself and seeing his acuity firsthand, there has never been a CEO more consistent at creative massive creating massive shareholder value at scale. What separates Brad from the rest is that he's obsessed with value creation. He feeds off of it. He's the type of leader who works seven days a week and never lets up. Leaders like that run circles around everyone else. Just as you'd expect, his track record speaks for itself. An investment in XPO when he first got involved would have been a 50 bagger. 1 million became 50 million bucks. United Rentals would have been a 200 bagger. 1 million became 200 million. Together, investing alongside Jacobs across his companies would have generated more than a 300x return. So, if you bet a million on Brad, you made 300 million bucks. These are the type of CEOs Buffett talks about. And when you find them, you bet on them. Both GXO and QXO, we've done exactly that. So, not only is this one of our favorite levered arms dealer plays on housing, it's also a bet on one of the best jockeyies out there. Below, we've highlighted the Q&A and key points since completing the Beacon acquisition in late April. Number one, every senior leader has material skin in the game at QXO with management team on board collectively and board collectively owning 35% of total equity and compensation directly tied to shareholder return targets that must outperform the S&P 500. Two, management is rolling out a digital pricing platform aimed at addressing $200 million of pricing leakage caused by undisiplined discounting and inefficiencies at legacy beacon. three. Though the total head count is largely unchanged, management has flattened the organization structure from nine lay layers to four, removing 250 mid-level and senior roles and replacing them with frontline resources, including 100 salespeople, truck drivers, warehouse associates, and executives in procurement and technology. Not only is this expected to drive stronger topline growth and win share, but it has also resulted in a more efficient cost structure. Four, inventory availability has already improved dramatically thanks to automated re replenishment and forecasting. About 4% of SKUs drive nearly 80% of sales, and before the acquisition, many of these fast-moving SKUs were frequently out of stock. Five, QXO has embedded AI into its quoting, routing, and sales workflows already driving double-digit productivity gains. So you can go through we've highlighted all the key things and general market neutral on the fear and greed. Uh National Association of Active Investment Managers kind of neutral to high ex high highish exposure and um uh we are uh officially open to smaller accounts at Great Hill Capital uh starting at $1 million. This final opening for 2025 will conclude earlier than normal on October 11th. So, if you're coming in in 2025 with the small account size of a million dollars, um you need to reach out right away. Uh otherwise, um uh it won't be till sometime early 2026 at the earliest. Uh for $5 million plus accounts, you can come in whenever you want. Not a solicitation. All this is opinion, not advice. Utilities top 30 weights um earnings estimates are down 27 basis points for 2026 in the last 60 days. REITs uh down 181 B 1.81% in the last 60 days. Uh economic data not much this week with the shutdown by the way that's something to keep a close eye on. GDP tends to get hit uh I think it's 10 basis points uh per week per shutdown. So if it's a month it's a half a percent of GDP. Um and then it makes it back once it reopens for the most part. But uh keep that in mind. Uh so that might be something else lurking in the background. Uh, leaving that aside, we're ready to get on to the ask me anything questions, which I'm excited. We've got a lot of great ones. Um, let's start with Jack Z. Glad to see our Baba bet finally taking off. Uh, it's up triple. I don't know about finally taking off, but um I'm sorry. Well, two and a half. Okay, not triple, but two and a half. Well, off the lows, it's up triple. Our basis is 82. So, um, okay. Could you please take a look at G PRK and let me know your thoughts? I think he's saying G Oh, Geopark. Really? I thought he was doing green brick. Geop park. Never heard of it. Well, the stock price is pretty consistently down with revenues being down. free cash flow generally being down. What do they do for oil and natural gas? Yeah, I I don't want to do oil and natural gas, small oil and natural gas companies. I mean, other than ones that I have absolute confidence with like Combtock Resources, um, $600 million of debt. So, the balance sheet's okay. Yeah, you got to figure out the cost of production here and and and decide whether this is a good investment if oil prices stay a lot lower. Looks like they did a deal here. I mean, balance sheet cash flow looks okay. You might have a play here. I'm I'm not going to I'm not going to say no. It's not something we would do, but I do think that you might be on to something. Where do they do this? I think it's international, Bogotaa, oil, natural gas in Chile, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Latin America. Um, find out what their cost of production is. If it's competitive, maybe you got something there. It's an international play. Um, yeah, I mean, it's not bad. Not something we would do, but it seems okay. It seems worth doing more research if you really wanted to get involved. Here's from Tim D. Amber ANF. We keep getting this question and we continue to say no. N O not doing it. Not interested. This was a 30 bagger from the COVID lows. Now it's come back 25% and everyone wants to buy it. Hard pass. Um, these things are so cyclical. This has always been a garbage business and, uh, this time will be no different. Uh, next week I will tell you how I really feel about it. Um, all right. That's a client request. I will get back to you. Sorry about that. Brad, uh, new client request. Bradley Jerrell, thoughts on Colgate. I love it. This is one of the greatest compounders of all time. It's a defensive um I'd like to get it a little lower. I mean, if you can get it below 70 between 70 and 75, I think you're better long term. But yeah, I I think at 70 at at $70, I would consider it as a position for Great Hill Capital, but I probably would pass just because I don't think it's going to be a double from 70 anytime soon. So, uh, but if you just want to collect a div, just be patient on that one. Hopefully, it comes down lower. John L, how do you think about stockbased compensation when it comes to valuation? Well, if they're diluting the hell out of me and it's not a it's not a creative and they're not delivering or every time they gain they give it all to themselves, uh, they're scumbags and I move on. But if the interests are aligned and they're becoming partners and I'm making more and more money, I want them to have as much stock as possible. So, uh, it's a balance, but um, uh, you know, Brad Jacobs tends to do it well. A lot of people don't do it well. Like Alibaba was doing it poorly for a while. Now they've moved to more cash comp. I'm happy with that. Um, you know, it's like anything else. I I I like them to give a lot of stock when the stock is trading at 40 times. I like to give very little stock when it's trading at, you know, eight times and and it's in the hole. But, um, I generally prefer a cash mix with stock. I want them to have some stock, but I don't want them to give away the whole pie. Um, but you do have to retain the best people. So, it's a blend. At the end of the day, I've seen companies where they just keep increasing the share count and giving massive amounts of stockbased comp and I avoid those like the plague. Um, but if they're generating a lot of cash and buying in stock on the other side at reasonable prices, then it then it makes sense. This is from Eduardo Gonzalez. Love what you do. Followed you for five years when you were pounding the table on buying banks during COVID and all the amazing calls over the year. will one day become a small client. Thank you once again. Uh what about FEMA? FEMSA. Is that FMX? Is that Coca-Cola FEMA? FMX. Okay. Okay. Yeah, this is a Coca-Cola bottler. Uh, the bottlers are generally so so businesses. You really want a huge discount. I don't think the discount is enough for this. Uh, he wants to bet on Mexico, EWW. Um, I mean, it it basically looks like the same chart. What about Walmart, Mexico? I I've just never found any success investing in Mexico even, you know, just uh you know, maybe we'll look at Walmart, Mexico. I Mexico is not a priority for me for international investing. So, I I would just pass. Uh Jeffrey, I talked to you this morning. Uh Eric So he's saying that we've talked about this is from Eric Anan. Okay. Anonymous I guess. Um he says that you know we've had international flavors and fragrances on uh a bunch of AMAs which we've liked it. Um, what about GI VN? All right, let's pull it up here. G I V N. So he's like, "Why isn't this one better? I just know international flavors and fragrances better. just take a look at through here and give you my thoughts. I I I think you're probably okay with GIVN. I my preference would be IFFF just because I know the company for many many years. Um 4.1 billion in debt. See how much cash they have. They must have done a big deal here. Yeah, free cash flow is picking up. Uh, how much cash? So, I got 381 of cash with 2.4 billion of receivables and they have 4.2 billion of debt. Yeah, look, you're probably not wrong. It's it's G. Uh, Givodin is probably okay as well, but my preference would be IFFF if I was going to get involved, which we're not at the moment. Um, Albert Rudell, uh, just ordered the mug and cap. Thank you. Wear it. Don't just order it. We don't make much money on these things. That's not why we're doing them. wear them and use them in public so people ask you what is hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes and they plug in and we can deliver some value for them as well and I know you will do that Albert um hope you'll be kind enough to take a picture of it with me when you attend the money show in Sarasota in December. Yes I will. Of course I will. Looking forward to meeting you. I'll be speaking at the Money Show in Sarasota in December. Anyone that wants to come that will be great. Uh Comcast will formally spin off their cable and digital properties new company Universal Studios D uh dividend buybacks for stock 52- week low. I just don't love the business. I think you're going to be okay with it. This has been cheap for a while. Um, I for me it's a pass. I I we've covered this multiple times. I I just don't like it. I think you might be right, but I I don't think there's enough upside relative to the downside and maybe some of the potentially secular changes that are coming in that industry. Uh, CIVI. All right, let's see here. This is a I think we've covered this one last week. I think these are the low lives who have completely decimated shareholder value ongoingly for decades. And somehow people keep giving them money to incinerate. Yeah, they 5x the share count in five years. Free cash flow is okay. 725 million in receivables. How much debt? 5 billion of debt with 69 million of cash and 725 million of receivables. I don't know. This is just a a history of shareholder wealth destruction. If you can tell me they changed the CEO in the last 5 years and it's going to be better maybe. Where are they based? Is this what is this a Perian play? Colorado Perian Basin. Yeah. Uh, this is a pass for me. I don't know why you'd want to be in something that hairy. Um, Nicholas Nicholas, you hi Tom. Thank you for all you do for us regular retail investors. Would you still be putting new clients in Cooper Standard at these levels? Uh while Cox Automotive forecast says 2026 auto sales to drop down to 15.5, the recent aluminum fire affects Ford seems like it's created an entry point for those of you who missed the initial move. Uh no, I don't buy up period. So we run separately managed accounts. When money comes in, we put them in those eight or 12 opportunities that we believe are just leaving the station. This is up, you know, 67x uh for us. I mean, it would have to pull back to the low 20s for us to put new money to work, even though we think it's going tremendously higher because, you know, a company that goes up 7x uh, you know, and maybe potentially over time 20 20x plus has embedded risks commensurate with that. So, I'm not going to buy it when it has an, you know, after it's up 67x with an expected value from current levels at, you know, 2 3 4x uh with the same embedded risks, um, and cyclicality. So, no. Um, but in the 20s, maybe I would put new money to work. Uh it's just that because we bought it so low, we have this embedded margin of safety that we can weather a lot of hits, whether it's a factory, whether it's, you know, a couple quarters of bad autoar, etc., we're perfectly fine. But if I put a new client in at 33 and it goes to 20 before it goes to 100, that's just a bad use. But if someone's basis is $10 and it goes to 20 before it goes to 100, it's not not that big of a deal. So, um, the answer is we believe it's going a lot higher. Is it for new money at these levels? No. It's a huddle stock. Okay, for all you crypto people, we will hodddle this thing a lot higher, but um uh it's um it would have to come down a lot more, which we don't anticipate uh for it to be a new money position. There are just too much other great opportunities that are going to be doubles and triples over the next few years that are just starting. Uh, Simon, thoughts on London Stock Exchange Group. All right, so it's down a third. I don't I don't see an easy double in this. So for us, we wouldn't be getting involved. Does that mean it won't work? I think it probably will. Let's take a look at the financials. I mean, you can make 50% in it probably, for sure. I'd like you to figure out before you do anything, why has the return on invested capital collapsed in the last few years, and what's going to bring it back? because you know you can get a much better return on invested capital just in an S&P index than you can in this stock. So how are they going to recover that so that you're back to getting double digit return on invested capital and making it worth your while in being in this stock? But uh so this is not the type of thing for me but these tend to have kind of regional moes. Um not that interesting for me though. I need to make a double or triple. not going to be in that stock anytime soon. Uh Patty Napman. Hey Tom, thanks for the merch messages. Oh, I I sent him a video. When people order merchandise, I send them a personalized video. Uh wear the cap proudly when it arrives and send some photos. Thanks for all the highly entertaining, informative info and well-directed banter on your podcast. Love it. Uh investing should be enjoyable and you certainly make it that. I appreciate that. Thank you. Can you let me know what you think of Vollex? Uh Nathaniel Rothschild for coffee when in London. Okay, let's see. Uh yeah, I will be in London in early November. Uh but let's look at V LX. I will say Patty, welcome to the podcast. We do not buy things near all new all-time highs. Uh that said, what did these guys do? You know, we would be buying this thing maybe when it was getting flushed out in April, but more likely somewhere. We we would have probably bought this at 57. It would have gone down to 24 and then up to 480. And so we would have bought at 57. We would have been buying like till our hands bled at 25 which would bring our basis down to you know 30 mid30s uh and then ride it all the way up. Uh that that would be our style buying it up here. I mean you could squeeze out the last you're picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. I can see the business is improving but um this is not the time to be a buyer. sells power and connectivity integrated PCB assembly box. Yeah, copper. I I mean, all this should work. Maybe it will work. I'd rather play natural gas. I understand why you're doing it. It's smart. I just, you know, it's not just buying a great business, which this looks like it is at the right time. It's what and when are you what are you paying for it and when are you buying it? And I don't think this is the right time to be buying it. Um, all right, cool. Uh, Joey P FMC trading like it's going out of business. Um, yeah, we've covered this one. We're kind of fine with this one. I mean, the issue here, free cash flows turned negative. Again, that's not ideal. And the other thing I think was the balance sheet, 3 billion of receivables, 3.2 billion of debt, free cash flow. Why did this free cash flow go negative? What's going on quarterly here? Yeah. Yeah, you just have to get comfortable like how are they going to turn around these revenues? And I think part of it is just the A cycle. Yeah. I mean, there's a bunch in this space. So, yeah. FMC. I I I I like this one. I'm I'm I'm I I kind of like this one. So, um, that's all I have to say. I like it. Okay, that's new client. Uh, I will get back to Robert. I've been listening to you. Uh, Robert, hey, Tom, I've been listening to you for over three years and made lots of money. You are a wealth of information for us little guys with small accounts for now, but with your information, hope to be a client soon. Sincerely, Bobby G. Uh, all right, Bobby G. Well, thank you for the nice note. I appreciate that. We'll be here when you're ready. Um, okay. Laura Buchanan says, "Such thank you for Thank you, Thomas, for such a valuable podcast for free. It's truly appreciated. Uh, you have a wonderful family and you're truly blessed. Yes, I do and I am and thank you very much. I appreciate that. Uh, could you please share your thoughts on pizza? Oh, by the way, Caitlyn uh surprised me this week. Uh, she she uh she put on a new pair of sneakers and she was wearing bright hot pink Vans that she picked up when she went to Atlanta. Uh, and I was like, "Good job. you're contributing to our earnings power because we are owners in that business. So, uh, so that was excited to to see and they look awesome on her. So, uh, Caitlyn rocking the Vans. Um, could you please share your thoughts on PZZA? Papa John 6 Papa John recently announced plans to open 650 restaurants in India over the next decade. Technically, some analysts see an inverse head and shoulders pattern. We don't give a about that. Forget that nonsense. Uh, close to breaking the neckline. That's a joke. Uh, all right. The reason I don't like PZA is because they basically threw out their founder who was the rock star. And you know, these guys who think they're smarter than the founders are usually wrong. Um, let's see what the numbers say if they got a competent operator in there. All right. So, this is you're you're basically buying the growth story in the future. Yeah, their margins are probably Yeah. compressing with ingredient costs. Uh revenues have basically been flat for a while. So, India would be good because I know Domino's was a monster over there. Uh let's take a look here at the balance sheet. 35 million of cash. Is that right? 100 million of receivables. any debt. $700 million of debt. Is that up or down? Yeah, that's up. They added a couple hundred. So, they get rid of the founder. They add $200 million of debt. Actually, more than that. They probably added 400 million since 2020. Wow. So, they they they get rid of the founder who built the whole damn thing. They double the debt. They the cash recedes, the receivables stay flat, the revenues decline, free cash flow. Let's see how much stock they gave themselves. Well, they brought it down. That's good. Uh, I think you're probably okay with this one, Laura. It's certainly worth doing a lot more work on. Um, so I would give you the go-ahhead to start your research. Go listen to the last eight calls, read the last five to six annual reports, start to draw comparisons between what they said was going to happen and what actually happened. and uh understand who is the CEO and what is their track record of success. Um and maybe you got a shot. I kind of like this. I kind of like this. So good good job. Pete Bass continue to like and enjoy your podcast and recommend to investing friends. Thank you for that. Appreciate that. Uh, could you take a look at Micro Cap? Manolet partners on the London Stock Exchange. Okay, Micro Cap. We don't do many of these. Mano.L. Oh, here's a here's a beauty. All right. M A N O revenues are recovering. Free cash flow is recovering. What do they do? Litigation finance. I hate this stuff. I really hate this stuff. It's almost as bad as owning a liquor company. But all right. Uh all right. Balance sheet looks okay. What are they doing here in terms of uh I don't know. I mean, if you can get comfort around the predictability of the litigation finance business, have at it. Um there is a niche. I know some people make money in this doing it privately. uh it's not my cup of tea. So, you really have to study the industry and understand it and uh figure out how they're going to grow it, but not my cup of tea, so I'm going to pass. Um, but it's an interesting find and pretty clever that you brought it to my attention. I I can't find anything wrong other than I don't like the business, but uh doesn't mean you won't make money from it. [Music] Professor Tom, you Jimmy Jones, you've recently stated you think Baba could uh go over 300 bucks. Should Baba become China's first trillion dollar company would be worth 40 $430 a share? What would take you to rate it higher? Uh your podcast means a lot. Yeah, I won't I probably won't be around at $430 a share or I'll have like 10 or 15% of our original position left if it goes that high. I I don't know that it will. I don't know if the cycle will last that long. It depends how long it takes. I mean, if it gets to, you know, $250 in the next uh 6 months, then there's a shot it could go to 400 within 3 years before the cycle ends in China. But um you know, we're going to probably mostly be out lower than $430 a share. And if and if we're at 430, you know, we've got 10 to 20% of the original shares that we had. Samir, I already talked to you. David Uh yeah, David, I called you already and you have set up your app. Jason, you're already in. Okay, Les Edelman, have you talked about leg? Is this legged and plat? Yeah, we're we're we're good with it. We generally like it. There's a little leverage, so you could lose all your money, but I think they'll make it through this cycle and this will be a multibagger. This is a furniture play on the housing recovery and lower rates. Uh so it's not without risk. It's it's just like Cooper Standard when we got involved. So you'd have to really do a lot of work on the debt. When is it mature? What's their cash flow? Uh Shahar L super appreciate everything you do. What do you think about ICR? 390 million in cash, 2.7 billion of receivables. How much debt? 3.4 billion. What's the free cash flow? 900. About a bill. What's the income statement? It's growing. It's a little off. Why Why are they stalling? What are they doing to reignite growth would be a key question? Uh added a lot of shares in 2022. Was that a deal that they did? Probably. Revenues jumped. Okay. turn on capital has diminished since they did the deal. So, it's probably a dumb deal for an older CEO to keep his job a few more years is my guess. Uh clinical research, commercialization services, various stages of the clinical process, phase one through four clinical studies. Uh yeah, this could be a this could be a possibility. Um I would say it's worth doing a lot more work on Shahara. So it kind of checks all the initial boxes that I would deploy resources to to research it. Uh Dava, this is thanks for this is from um Nikolai Johnson. Thanks for the great podcast. Been listening to it for years and I've recommended to several friends. Thank you very much. That is the best way to say thanks. Uh, could you give me Well, second best, you could become a a client with $50 million, but if you can't do that, just tell a friend. Uh, could you give me your thoughts on Indava? We keep covering this one and keep passing. Let's see if anything's changed. Yeah. Well, there's a reason we kept passing. Everyone wanted us to buy it at 30. It's now down to nine. I mean, at this point, it's solveny risk. I I have always passed because I didn't know whether their software had any actual moat and I had no way of discerning whether they had an actual moat. Um and it appears that they don't technology services. [Music] Let's see if they'll live another day until they figure out what they want to be when they grow up. 81 million of cash. This is why we don't do a lot of software or technology because you can just get disintermediated very quickly. And now with AI more quickly than ever. 250 million of debt, 81 million of cash, 230 of receivables. So I mean you you just have to understand do some channel checks understand what is their competitive advantage and how can they maintain the moat or is the moat permanently breached and on that basis um yeah potentially take a punt at it. I mean it's getting cheaper. I I'd be willing to do some work on it. I don't think we'll ever do anything with it though because we have no edge. Um, some things are cheap for a reason. Martin Mayor MGM MGM. I don't think there's enough margin of safety or upside relative to the leverage on their balance sheet. So, I'll just leave it at that. Might be fine, but not for me. Edgar Abbro, loyal listener for the past three years. Really appreciate all the work. Uh he's talking about option uh uh structuring. Yeah, that's exclusive for our clients um on Bax Horell and Varco. Uh so um so that's that. Uh Ethan W. Helmet Aerospace is three to five year outlook. Yeah, I think that's probably going to be a good one. H uh not at these levels though. Are you crazy? No, I'm kidding. Ethan, thank you for the question. We're We're not We don't buy anything up like this. This This is up 20x in the last four years. I' I'd be looking to short this thing. Uh HWM. I I I'm not going to short this, but I just want to see if it actually sets up as a decent short. Uh free cash flows flat. Revenues are flat. Yeah, it it doesn't really set up as a short, but it's definitely not a long for me. Uh let's see. three billion of debt, 500 billion of cash. Now, I I can't find any good reason to short it, but I'm certainly not going long after 20x on this um in this type of business. No, great company, terrible price. John Reio, don't need to be greedy since I had you look at pool corp before a few weeks ago. Found another one. Look at match. Uh we have talked about it a million times. Beaten down. Yeah, match continues to look cheap and continues to do nothing. Uh maybe it's starting to percolate a little bit, but I don't know what the growth story is there. So you'd have to figure that out because we've continued to look at it and continued to pass. Um yeah, I mean everything about it has said that it should work. I just don't have confidence. This is one of Barry Diller's companies and his stuff has just been not doing well for a while. So, I'm going to just take a pass on that one. Even though mentally, this is just instinct after years. It's I I don't find me four or five growth drivers and send it in as an AOA AMA next week and I'll revisit it because I can't find anything financially wrong. And the last six times I've covered it, I've said the same thing. I can't find anything financially wrong, but I also just don't understand what the mode is and whether it's uh growing or receding. Um Mick Anderson is asking what uh do you consider stories about Chinese ADRs being delist delisted as valid or likely? Less and less that those were the uh narratives that false narratives that got everyone out of the stock at the lows. Uh we own a bunch in Hong Kong and we own uh also a decent amount in the US. Certainly the options that we had were US, but we took profits on those around 6x for the most part. Um, so most of our stock exposure is Hong Kong. I think it's very, very low probability. I think there's no chance of Trump doing a deal with China and delisting their stocks. So, uh, that's why that narrative is off the table, but not impossible, but not probable. It's why you don't own one stock. Um, okay. That's a client. Client. Another new client. Uh, you Under Armour has dropped further from when you said to pass on it last time. Is now the time? No, it's never the time. Uh, that business has been destroyed. Um, if you can't sell sneakers with Tom Brady promoting them, you you're done. Uh, this when it was run by its founder and he was focused, there was no one like it and there was nothing like it. He lost his way, started buying vineyards, doing all kinds of crazy stuff, getting distracted, and I think it's just uh not for me. You can get dead cat bounces. I I just think it's been mismanaged and uh probably destroyed beyond repair. But um I hope he proves me wrong because he was one of the best CEOs for a short period. Uh and then uh he wasn't. So that's that. Uh we'll be back next week, back to our normal time on Thursday next week. Uh in the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
