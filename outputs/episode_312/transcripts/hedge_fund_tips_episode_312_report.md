**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautious → 6/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆☆

- Record call buying indicates excessive froth.
- MAG 7 earnings growth is decelerating.
- Hyperscalers' capex is impacting margins and earnings growth.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
Hayes anticipates short-term market volatility due to earnings season and overbought conditions, followed by a year-end rally. He favors defensive sectors like consumer staples and healthcare, as well as small caps and international stocks, which he believes will outperform the overvalued MAG 7. He also sees potential in beaten-down restaurant stocks and energy.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Consumer Staples to S&P 500 Relative Performance | Lowest since 2000 | This is a four three four times in a 100redyear opportunity which is why we were talking about our holdings uh Diagio and Estee Lauder. |
| MAG 7 Earnings Growth | Expected to be below 15% this quarter, down from 32% last year | People are starting to see all investment, no return on that investment, no imminent return on that investment. So, guidance will have to be absolutely spectacular uh for the multiple to stay where it is with the earnings growth having. |
| Call Volume | 40 million contracts per day for the last 20 sessions | We haven't seen anything close to this since late 2021 to early 2022. Uh where there was a pullback in the high-flying stocks. And that's why you're seeing staples. |
| Hyperscalers Capital Spending | 60% of free cash flow, up from 10% a few years ago | This is impacting margins and it's impacting earnings growth. |
| Homeowner Equity | Highest since the late 1950s | All this equity is going to hit the market at once. And that's why as rates go down, supply price prices prices are actually going to go down, which will be the first time, which is counterintuitive. |
| Russell 2000 | Breaking out of a long-term consolidation period | After some maybe short-term consolidation into year end we should see a lot of strength in small caps which we love. |
