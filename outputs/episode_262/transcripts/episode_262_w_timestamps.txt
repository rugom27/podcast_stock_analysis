[69.92s] existing ones those are the new ones for
[71.96s] those of you who are new to the
[73.56s] podcast uh this is related to a holding

[79.32s] Daryl which is a turnaround uh they call
[81.479s] me turnaround Tom for the new folks out
[84.479s] there uh and he&#39;s turning that company
[86.88s] around just like he did with Logitech
[89.159s] which was a six bagger after he came in
[91.759s] after the stock was down 82% same thing
[94.68s] came in with the stock down more than
[96.24s] 80% starting to turn it around already
[99.2s] ran up to $20 consolidating and will
[102.32s] move higher over time this is uh dinner
[106.2s] with my buddies from Fox that&#39;s Kenny
[108.36s] pocari you all know Michael Lee of
[111.04s] course he grew up in the same town that
[112.68s] we have our house in Connecticut there&#39;s
[114.52s] Mark teer you see every morning on
[117.439s] mornings with Maria and vanney as well
[120.52s] and I call him AJ Adam Johnson we had a
[124.0s] great time at uh catch sake which uh I
[128.039s] know from as the maritime Hotel back in
[131.599s] the day but uh but they&#39;ve changed over
[134.64s] and it was
[136.08s] delicious um other than the fact they
[138.2s] had no anchovies inside joke then I got
[141.12s] to go to the Al Smith dinner last week
[143.56s] which was absolutely so much fun ran
[146.64s] into so many people and uh just an
[150.4s] incredible time that was Donald Trump
[152.2s] telling jokes the other candidate uh was
[154.64s] a no-show which uh is the first time in
[157.48s] 40 years I think both candidates haven&#39;t
[159.599s] show shown up so uh not an ideal
[162.28s] situation but uh turned out to be a
[164.319s] great night those are some photos there
[167.239s] and I don&#39;t know exactly what happened
[169.0s] but uh maybe because I&#39;ve been to a
[170.48s] number of them before that was with
[172.08s] Cardinal Ean I got my picture up there I
[173.959s] don&#39;t know where the pictures are they
[175.12s] took pictures I don&#39;t know where they
[176.56s] posted them I haven&#39;t really Googled for
[178.12s] them yet but um
[182.04s] uh that that was a just a phenomenal
[183.879s] time so I got to sit next to
[187.68s] um uh Mary Higgins Clark granddaughter
[192.72s] was at my table and her partner we had a
[195.519s] really fun time and her father and uh
[198.799s] got to
[199.959s] meet um Paul singer from Elliot
[203.319s] management he was at the table right
[204.799s] next to me and uh the uh Vice chair of
[209.799s] Alibaba by the way uh Mike Evans
[212.599s] president of global uh so had had a few
[215.599s] nice words with him uh and uh pitch Paul
[219.439s] singer on Intel so we&#39;ll see what
[220.92s] happens if he shows up look in in a
[223.879s] handful of the uh uh positions we&#39;ve put
[227.319s] on whether it was crown castle Etc we
[229.64s] seem to put them on and the activists
[231.239s] seem to come invariably uh you know one
[235.28s] or two months later so uh so maybe we&#39;ll
[238.12s] uh we&#39;ll get a partner in Intel it&#39;s
[239.76s] certainly makes a lot of sense from my
[241.0s] point of view uh then we had that&#39;s a
[245.159s] little premature there we had uh uh was
[249.519s] on vanney and Company yesterday want to
[252.959s] thank Preston misel Christian dagger and
[255.48s] Stu Varney for having me on we discussed
[259.079s] before after Boeing earnings and before
[262.759s] the vote what to do if they voted for
[266.08s] the union package what to do if they
[267.96s] voted against the union package package
[270.199s] and we did exactly what we advised um
[273.639s] after the fact and uh also talked about
[278.28s] the uh
[279.68s] potential areas that will benefit if uh
[283.68s] the polls are right and uh Trump becomes
[286.72s] the next president and I don&#39;t say that
[288.44s] with any partisanship I say that with uh
[290.6s] betting odds which we&#39;re going to talk
[291.96s] about and some of the internal polling
[294.039s] data that I have access to uh and other
[297.08s] things that uh that I have information
[299.08s] on that seem to be pointing towards for
[301.639s] sure the
[302.759s] executive uh and in some instances
[305.8s] pointing to a sweep which uh would be
[308.6s] less good for equities believe it or not
[311.08s] so uh we&#39;re hoping for a split
[313.16s] government which would uh probably mean
[316.44s] a republican executive Republican Senate
[319.36s] and Democratic house I think that&#39;s a
[321.12s] good scenario for the markets uh
[323.36s] obviously Anything could happen but we
[325.56s] just need to deal objectively with how
[327.4s] we can make money from it and leave the
[330.08s] uh emotionalism and uh idealism to the
[333.72s] polit political pundants and uh people
[336.08s] who care about that stuff we&#39;re on this
[337.759s] podcast and you&#39;re on this podcast to
[339.319s] make money not to make uh uh political
[342.319s] viewpoints so with that said let&#39;s get
[344.639s] back to money here we go is we&#39;re going
[346.56s] to open the market in about 12 13
[348.84s] minutes some red ink today down 250 on
[351.24s] the Dow down 94 on the NASDAQ Tom hay is
[354.36s] back with us this morning rising
[356.24s] interest rates that&#39;s what&#39;s hurting the
[358.36s] market tell me why why are rates Rising
[361.08s] like they are well I think the treasury
[362.96s] market is starting to price in progrowth
[365.8s] Pro bus policies and that implies that
[368.96s] maybe the FED won&#39;t have to cut quite as
[371.12s] much progrowth Pro business policies you
[373.44s] bet that&#39;s a trump presidency that&#39;s a
[374.919s] trump presidency for sure and the
[376.479s] treasury market is reacting to that
[377.8s] you&#39;re 424 on the tenure now yeah no
[380.16s] question about it uh there&#39;s another
[382.0s] Factor so other people would say the
[383.599s] Skeptics would say oh there&#39;s going to
[384.88s] be deficit spending but actually during
[386.72s] the last Trump Administration the
[388.16s] 10-year yield was between
[390.199s] 1.30 and 3.20 so that that old dog don&#39;t
[394.36s] hunt as far as that argument goes the
[396.4s] other thing to keep in mind is
[398.0s] seasonally over the last 10 years
[400.319s] October happens to be the worst month of
[403.28s] the year for bonds November is the best
[405.72s] month of the year for bonds so you want
[407.16s] to sell the rumor buy the news after the
[409.72s] election you want to be buying bonds if
[411.36s] you think Trump&#39;s going to win the
[412.72s] election what should you be buying on
[414.479s] the stock market right now well this is
[416.199s] a controversial one uh first off Boeing
[419.8s] okay they just reported they missed
[421.84s] earnings this morning this was a kitchen
[423.72s] sync quarter for the new CEO he came
[426.16s] from Rockwell Collins under his tenure
[428.599s] the stock over a decade went up 4X this
[430.84s] guy&#39;s going to turn around the company
[432.52s] they have the union vote today here&#39;s my
[434.879s] suggestion if the union votes against
[437.639s] the pay package I.E the strike continues
[440.4s] wait till to drops 5% buy some Boeing
[443.08s] stock if they vote Yes the Stock&#39;s going
[445.08s] to go up buy some stock Industrials are
[447.319s] going to do well defense spending is
[449.039s] going to do well well this is a stock
[450.639s] that did exceptionally well so
[451.8s] Industrials small caps did exceptionally
[454.24s] well under Trump uh Emerging Markets did
[456.72s] exceptionally well consumer
[457.879s] discretionary did ex exceptionally well
[459.8s] I&#39;ll tell you what didn&#39;t do well that
[461.12s] everyone thinks is the Trump trade is
[463.0s] energy stocks energy stocks did not do
[465.24s] well under Trump because there was a lot
[466.72s] of Supply prices were low margins were
[468.759s] less for energy companies that&#39;s
[470.319s] fascinating good stuff Tom Hayes thanks
[471.96s] for joining us we&#39;ll see you again soon
[473.28s] thanks for all right the
[474.84s] camp and we&#39;re back on to the next and
[478.599s] then this morning
[480.52s] I was in lovely Connecticut and uh you
[483.4s] know at like
[485.039s] 11:20 uh a.m. I got an email can you be
[488.199s] on at 12 so after a very quick shave and
[493.0s] a uh very quick put the suit on and very
[496.52s] quick put my uh uh studio uh in in order
[501.08s] I was happy to do so and I got a chance
[503.199s] to talk about
[505.599s] the
[507.759s] um the uh the the Boeing vote and the
[513.08s] union and the implications and Tesla and
[515.599s] a whole lot more so we&#39;re going to
[516.64s] listen uh first off I want to thank
[519.599s] Jenna Jenna damasus uh for thinking of
[523.12s] me and having me on the show Dad so
[525.48s] again this taale of Two Worlds we want
[526.92s] to pursue this a little bit more we got
[528.399s] trah heider here of Zen media the CEO
[531.04s] there uh Thomas Hay&#39;s back with us the
[532.959s] chairman of managing partner great Hill
[534.44s] capital thas on Boeing if you&#39;ll indulge
[536.959s] me a little bit on this that this idea
[538.88s] that workers reject a 35% pay hike now
[542.68s] the devil&#39;s in the details I&#39;m not aware
[544.48s] of all the details that&#39;s a big pay hike
[546.76s] to turn down I&#39;m I&#39;m just wondering if
[548.92s] you&#39;re a corporate boss anywhere else
[550.68s] let&#39;s say of a large Union Workforce
[552.959s] does that get you
[555.24s] nervous yeah Neil I think the IMA the
[558.36s] union for Boeing workers may be
[560.399s] overplaying their hand here uh so far
[563.44s] they&#39;re they&#39;re paying the workers $250
[565.44s] a week to strike these are six figure
[567.399s] jobs they&#39;ve already gone grew about $41
[570.959s] million they only have $300 million
[574.12s] total and Boeing workers are only 6% of
[577.279s] the Union so basically you&#39;ve seen a
[579.72s] situation where they&#39;ve eroded 133% of
[582.519s] the Union&#39;s assets 530,000 members in
[585.68s] just a handful of weeks within 31.5
[588.88s] weeks they will be down to0 of assets
[591.88s] they started at 300 they&#39;re down to 260
[594.6s] Boeing on the other hand can tap the
[596.6s] public markets anytime they want and
[598.2s] raise 10 billion 20 billion and wait
[600.399s] this thing out for 10 months 20 months
[602.839s] if need be and I think from an investor
[605.6s] standpoint Neil we just have to step
[607.44s] back they&#39;ve got a half a trillion
[609.72s] dollar backlog over the next 10 years
[612.959s] they they&#39;ve got to deliver uh thousands
[615.36s] of planes 6200 plane backlogs so
[618.16s] Boeing&#39;s going to be just fine look we
[620.12s] were in the market adding to our
[621.44s] position like crazy this morning we did
[623.48s] think 35% was extremely generous uh
[627.04s] Boeing started at 25% the union wanted
[629.519s] 40% Boeing came up to 35% they&#39;re
[632.24s] rejecting I think some of these workers
[634.16s] are going to find themselves as part of
[635.56s] the next 177,000 worker cut that Boeing
[638.68s] recently announced they had to do and
[640.639s] they may be overplaying they&#39;re they&#39;re
[642.2s] looking for a 40% raise but they may get
[644.959s] 100% pay
[647.639s] reduction yeah we forget about that 10%
[650.16s] of the workforce 17,000 you&#39;re Point who
[652.0s] are going to lose their jobs and more uh
[654.48s] could happen after this we&#39;ll see how
[655.88s] that plays out uh Shaman now back to the
[658.2s] the better story of the day and that is
[659.76s] Tesla uh the stock is soaring about 20%
[663.44s] it surprised a lot of folks on the
[664.959s] upside and put the Magnificent back in
[667.12s] the Magnificent 7 I guess but not all of
[669.639s] them are going along for the ride what
[671.76s] do you make of the significance of what
[673.72s] Tesla
[675.04s] reported I&#39;m thrilled Neil and I will
[677.639s] tell you I&#39;m am bullish uh on both
[679.639s] Boeing and Tesla going through very
[682.04s] different challenges but you know
[684.04s] they&#39;ve got very interesting leaders at
[685.92s] the helm so I look at that and one of my
[688.12s] fun hacks is actually look at LinkedIn
[690.76s] and see what employees are saying and
[692.8s] you can really see the energy in Tesla
[696.32s] employees you know they shipped their 7
[698.6s] millionth uh vehicle recently and so I
[701.639s] think it&#39;s to be expected I do not bet
[704.32s] against um Elon Musk I think he knows
[707.12s] what he&#39;s doing and you can just see how
[709.24s] excited the people are and so much of
[711.72s] this does come down to people and and
[715.16s] Vibes you know if I me a lot musk I&#39;m
[717.76s] excited too because I I I I&#39;m I&#39;m the
[720.519s] world&#39;s richest human being I I&#39;d be
[722.839s] happy in dancing on stages myself but
[724.959s] leaving that aside uh you know Thomas
[726.56s] I&#39;m curious about uh Tesla what is
[729.24s] remarkable here is that the government
[731.92s] guarantees and checks you get to buy an
[734.639s] EV they&#39;ve shrunk considerably and so a
[737.56s] lot of those Tesla sales are what they
[739.399s] call naked sales in other words without
[741.519s] any benefits or or any you know uh
[745.079s] government incentives here what do you
[746.72s] make of
[747.92s] that well speaking of naked Neil uh the
[751.04s] naked short sellers got hammered this
[752.839s] morning that&#39;s for sure in the Tesla
[754.519s] stock so you never want to bet against
[756.0s] Elon Musk I think look I think that&#39;s
[758.24s] the idea of a government subsidy they
[759.92s] want to promote a specific ideology a
[762.6s] specific method a specific technology so
[764.839s] they have to subsidize it because it&#39;s
[766.6s] uneconomic in the nent years and now
[769.399s] that it&#39;s gain gaining mainstream
[771.6s] adoption it&#39;s it is getting a leg of its
[774.199s] its own you don&#39;t see it across all the
[776.399s] car manufacturers you know I&#39;ve always
[778.0s] been skeptical I&#39;ve said I&#39;m not sure
[779.44s] people want EVS but I do think they want
[781.68s] Teslas there&#39;s something special about
[784.199s] Tesla when it comes to EVs and I think
[786.04s] that&#39;s going to continue as he rolls out
[788.12s] refreshed models uh more affordable
[790.639s] models for the masses I think uh I think
[792.68s] he&#39;s got
[793.88s] legs um let me pursue that with you sham
[797.079s] and what it might say about technology
[799.48s] because one thing that&#39;s been you know
[801.6s] beneath the surfaces we used to have
[803.36s] those seven tech stocks I I&#39;ll throw
[805.72s] Tesla into that camp it&#39;s more than an
[807.519s] automaker um and and all the others in
[810.44s] the S&amp;P 500 now it&#39;s the S&amp;P 493 that
[814.48s] are doing quite well um as are the the
[817.48s] tech stock so how do you play that going
[821.199s] forward yeah you know I think listen and
[823.959s] I apologize for anyone who gets this
[825.92s] song stuck in their head but it&#39;s like
[827.8s] you know the grease is a word it&#39;s a
[829.519s] feeling that&#39;s that&#39;s AI right that&#39;s
[832.639s] automation that song&#39;s been playing in
[834.639s] my head all day but that&#39;s really what
[836.519s] we&#39;re seeing and so I&#39;m really bullish I
[838.56s] mean I&#39;m bullish on uh you know we
[841.279s] haven&#39;t even seen this but but meta and
[844.279s] uh you know just look at look at all the
[846.44s] things that it takes to power that AI
[848.6s] right so you&#39;re talking semiconductors
[850.24s] you&#39;re talking supply chain you&#39;re
[851.839s] talking manufacturing I&#39;m very excited I
[854.199s] think this year ends really on a high
[857.279s] note you know sha I&#39;m old enough to
[859.959s] remember that song There&#39;s no way in
[861.639s] heck that you can be uh or Tom that guy
[864.56s] in the box next year but we&#39;ll see
[866.839s] because uh you know Greece and just
[869.16s] buying Tech is the word um guys thank
[871.24s] you both very much do appreciate it
[873.36s] again we&#39;ll follow this sort of
[875.04s] disperate Direction on these two key
[876.8s] stocks but I thought we&#39;d zero in on
[878.56s] these folks because maybe that is
[880.199s] emblematic of this Market they&#39;re the
[882.12s] gainers and they&#39;re the losers uh Robert
[884.279s] kosaki says uh the stocks themselves are
[887.36s] getting a little pricey at these levels
[889.44s] here as well as Neil Cavuto so here we
[892.68s] go and we&#39;re back and then finally on
[897.399s] Sunday night I got to be on bloom
[899.04s] Bloomberg Radio Bloomberg uh Asia with
[902.36s] Doug Kisner again thanks to Doug and
[904.759s] Juan Torres for having me on here we
[907.199s] talked a lot about different
[908.56s] implications of the election but more
[910.16s] than that we got to talk about Asia
[912.12s] China and Alibaba here we go us now is
[915.639s] Thomas Hayes he is the chairman at Great
[917.88s] Hill Capital joining us from here in New
[920.12s] York City Tom thanks for making time to
[922.24s] chat with us you and I were talking a
[924.6s] little while ago about the fact that
[926.16s] there seems to be powerful me momentum
[928.48s] right now happening for the US Equity
[930.0s] Market I think the S&amp;P 500 closed Friday
[933.04s] at yet another record we have seen six
[935.72s] straight weeks of gains is this a little
[938.199s] concerning to you a little bit
[940.56s] particularly because of the seasonality
[942.319s] dug so this is the seventh time in the
[945.04s] last decade the S&amp;P has been up six
[947.079s] weeks in a row and it&#39;s basically a coin
[949.399s] flip based on history whether we get a a
[951.759s] seventh up week this week about 5050 so
[955.839s] we&#39;ll see what happens but I think what
[957.519s] you&#39;re seeing here Doug is a combination
[960.519s] of complacency plus liquidity uh most
[965.319s] Central Bank Cuts in the month of
[967.519s] September that we&#39;ve seen since 2020 and
[970.36s] prior to that 2009 and then you couple
[973.839s] that with if you look at betting odds if
[975.92s] if you place any weight on betting odds
[978.6s] potentially uh the market may be pricing
[981.079s] in a a shift to slightly more Pro bus
[984.959s] policy whether premature or not it seems
[987.8s] to be telling the story particularly
[989.519s] when the Market&#39;s going up and uh
[991.639s] earnings came in a little bit lighter
[993.759s] than expected so far so stocks are up
[997.399s] yields are down by and large and we had
[1000.04s] rapael bask saying at the end of last
[1001.88s] week he&#39;s not in a rush to lower
[1003.399s] interest rates do you think the FED may
[1005.68s] be a little concerned here put aside for
[1008.759s] the moment the labor market put aside
[1010.68s] for a moment this decline that we have
[1013.04s] seen in the rate of inflation is the Fed
[1015.12s] perhaps a little concerned about easy
[1017.88s] financial conditions
[1020.24s] well you know they have shifted to a
[1023.6s] dual-sided risk and the labor market uh
[1027.64s] as low as the unemployment rate is it is
[1030.839s] showing some signs of weakness now are
[1033.24s] we guaranteed getting six consecutive
[1036.199s] Cuts in a row the Market&#39;s been a little
[1037.919s] bit too optimistic so I&#39;m not sure if
[1041.12s] November is a foregone conclusion I
[1043.24s] think the Market&#39;s pricing in 225 uh
[1045.88s] basis point Cuts but maybe we only get
[1048.0s] one I think that&#39;s perfectly fine given
[1050.039s] the current conditions um you know the
[1053.08s] other thing that I&#39;ve really had my eye
[1054.799s] on Doug is last month we got a record
[1059.0s] move out of bonds a two standard
[1062.0s] deviation move out of bonds and you got
[1064.76s] to look back all the way to 2001 to 2003
[1069.88s] to see that level of move and and uh if
[1073.0s] you remember and I think you&#39;ve been you
[1074.4s] were around back then Doug uh you you
[1077.96s] had uh a a an unprecedented rally
[1081.44s] following that in small caps versus
[1085.039s] large caps in value versus growth and in
[1089.0s] Emerging Markets versus developed
[1091.12s] markets three trades that very few
[1093.799s] people are uh confidently positioned for
[1097.48s] right now I want to change gears talk a
[1100.559s] little bit about the other side of the
[1102.12s] world the Asia Pacific and the week
[1103.799s] ahead markets in Asia are gearing up for
[1106.32s] what is likely to be the busiest week of
[1108.4s] new listings in more than 2 years
[1111.08s] particularly it&#39;s China it&#39;s India it&#39;s
[1113.32s] Japan what does it say to you that uh
[1116.919s] developing markets um are in the process
[1119.64s] of raising a lot more Capital yeah the
[1122.159s] game is back on Animal Spirits are
[1124.08s] coming in the Chinese government has
[1126.44s] flipped on the dime uh yes uh investors
[1130.0s] want more yes investors are skeptical
[1133.12s] after a two-year Beatdown and yes they
[1136.12s] are going to get more because why
[1138.84s] because you can&#39;t be half pregant
[1140.6s] they&#39;ve already turned the corner they
[1142.44s] are going full bore they will do more
[1145.24s] and then they will do more and then they
[1147.12s] will do more and the Chinese government
[1149.44s] the game is back on we&#39;re going to see
[1151.24s] more fiscal stimulus uh coupled with the
[1154.4s] monetary stimulus coupled with back
[1156.48s] stopping the property market and when
[1158.6s] that happens massive flows and I think
[1161.96s] uh you mentioned Japan there you know
[1163.96s] some of these emerging markets that have
[1165.799s] been the beneficiary of emerging market
[1168.72s] flows out of China like Japan like India
[1174.0s] that have gotten a little bit heated I
[1176.08s] think we&#39;re going to see a little bit of
[1177.36s] weakness in those markets as money
[1179.44s] slowly and more confidently over time
[1182.6s] moves back into China particularly the
[1185.2s] most high quality companies in China uh
[1188.559s] and uh and the IPO Market tell the Slate
[1191.44s] that you mentioned tells you everything
[1192.919s] you need to know about confidence uh
[1195.6s] recovering and starting to rebuild so
[1198.12s] are you a buyer of risk Assets in China
[1200.72s] right now yes uh our one of our largest
[1203.799s] positions is Alibaba this has been like
[1206.48s] watching paint dry has been dead money
[1208.48s] for us for a year uh we spent every red
[1211.88s] day buying more stock people looked at
[1213.72s] us like we had three heads but here&#39;s
[1215.84s] the fact Doug you can buy Alibaba today
[1218.96s] for the same price it was 10 years ago
[1222.679s] the only difference is the revenues are
[1224.52s] up, 1300% and the earnings in cash flow
[1227.24s] are up 650 so what else do you want to
[1229.64s] talk about I mean we see it as one of
[1231.76s] the greatest Price is what you pay value
[1234.84s] is what you get and in terms of the cash
[1237.0s] generated they generate 20 to 25 billion
[1239.559s] doar a year in cash they got 80 billion
[1242.24s] of cash on the balance sheet they&#39;ve got
[1244.559s] uh a piece of basically every AI startup
[1248.24s] in China they give them credits for
[1250.28s] compute power in their Cloud business in
[1252.679s] exchange for Equity I mean if you wanted
[1254.6s] to play an AI ETF in China it&#39;s called
[1257.08s] Alibaba and that&#39;s got got zero Credit
[1259.559s] in the price right now uh couple that
[1262.039s] with AI with the cloud and with the
[1264.6s] consumer coming back with the fiscal
[1267.28s] stimulus it&#39;s the toll it&#39;s the Tollgate
[1269.28s] for China so uh we like that position
[1271.48s] and we love the valuation at high single
[1273.72s] digits down from historic multiples of
[1275.96s] 20 25 times and they&#39;ll come back over
[1278.679s] time let&#39;s talk about the US
[1280.72s] presidential election we&#39;re a little
[1282.24s] more than two weeks away from November
[1284.4s] 5th obviously it&#39;s a critical day or
[1287.44s] will be uh how are you feeling about the
[1290.0s] election and what would uh Trump
[1292.279s] presidency mean versus uh Harris
[1295.559s] presidency for the business environment
[1297.4s] in the US yeah it seems like the market
[1301.24s] is starting to price in slightly more
[1304.039s] Pro business policy which implies a
[1306.72s] trump win that&#39;s evidenced in the data
[1309.08s] in the uh in some of the polling data
[1311.48s] and certainly in some of the betting
[1313.64s] data in some of the betting pools that
[1315.64s] you look at it&#39;s starting to favor a
[1317.919s] trump win I think betting on the basis
[1321.679s] of who&#39;s elected is a Fool&#39;s errand if
[1324.4s] you recall um when Trump got elected
[1328.2s] everyone said China stocks were going to
[1329.799s] do horribly from 2016 to 2018 China
[1333.48s] stocks did better than they&#39;ve done in
[1335.44s] years uh and then when Biden was in they
[1337.88s] thought China was going to do great it
[1339.279s] did horribly the worst it&#39;s done in a
[1341.44s] decade uh furthermore everyone said when
[1343.799s] Trump would get elected energy stocks
[1345.52s] would go to the Moon uh the exact
[1347.64s] opposite happened when you have more
[1348.96s] drilling the price goes down and the
[1350.76s] stocks went down with it a lot of Supply
[1353.36s] uh was not good for energy stocks under
[1355.279s] Trump so I think that what the the ideal
[1359.84s] outcome from a stock market standpoint
[1362.159s] Doug is just a split government so
[1364.48s] whether uh Trump is elected or Harris is
[1367.6s] elected in the executive branch so long
[1369.799s] as you have a different party in either
[1371.88s] the house or the Senate the market loves
[1374.36s] gridlock and empirically the market does
[1376.72s] best with a split government so that&#39;s
[1379.039s] that&#39;s what I think we want to be
[1380.72s] focused on as Market participants in the
[1382.88s] next few weeks okay so if you&#39;re reading
[1385.679s] the data properly or at least these
[1388.0s] indicators that you&#39;re looking at right
[1390.24s] now and there is a higher probability of
[1392.12s] a trump
[1393.4s] Administration do you really believe
[1395.84s] that additional tariffs are pro business
[1399.0s] well look I I&#39;ve seen some studies on uh
[1401.84s] the impact if Trump actually put forth
[1405.52s] the 60% tariffs on China the data that
[1409.279s] I&#39;ve looked at implies that that would
[1411.6s] only reduce Chinese GDP by
[1415.24s] 1% so uh we would
[1418.52s] potentially uh in the short term bear
[1420.96s] the brunt of the higher prices however
[1423.96s] uh as some of his selected potential
[1426.84s] treasury secretaries and trade
[1429.159s] negotiators in his uh formative
[1431.96s] Administration have implied that is the
[1435.44s] ask it is open to negotiation and Trump
[1438.799s] has said as much we just want to do a
[1441.0s] deal so he&#39;ll hit them hard bring them
[1443.039s] back to the table and try to get a
[1445.159s] pragmatic outcome as we saw in the early
[1448.679s] part of the administration from prior to
[1451.12s] covid uh that he did have some success
[1453.84s] in doing that and the subsequent
[1455.559s] Administration actually followed through
[1458.0s] and kept the tariffs he put in place uh
[1461.159s] active during the uh during the Biden
[1463.36s] Administration so I think it&#39;s more of a
[1466.12s] let&#39;s get to the table but uh first I&#39;m
[1468.48s] going to bop you and then I&#39;m going to
[1470.039s] you know hand you an ice pack to help uh
[1472.32s] uh heal together and make something that
[1474.559s] works for both parties and I think we&#39;ll
[1477.0s] see a
[1478.08s] pragmatic uh move after the initial
[1481.08s] shock Factor all right we&#39;ll leave it

[1674.799s] um uh which reminds me of opinion not
[1679.039s] advice as always uh we don&#39;t know your
[1682.039s] financial situation we deal exclusively
[1683.88s] with accredited investors and qualified
[1686.12s] institutions so talk to your financial
[1689.48s] adviser before doing anything go to
[1691.12s] hedge fund tips.com click on trades
[1694.36s] opinion not advice here we go the
[1696.64s] current high level of Market
[1698.12s] concentration suggests the equal weight
[1701.0s] S&amp;P will outperform the aggregate index
[1703.6s] by an annualized 8 percentage points
[1707.24s] over the next decade
[1708.799s] what does that imply well if the
[1711.72s] heaviest weights and the heaviest
[1713.72s] earnings in the rearview mirror have
[1715.96s] been the mag 7 and these Cycles are
[1719.64s] correct which we believe they are and by
[1721.32s] the way this points to exactly what
[1723.039s] again 2001 2002 to 2007 same exact
[1726.519s] situation uh where what outperforms
[1729.24s] small caps Emerging Markets Industrials
[1732.32s] financials value over growth and uh so
[1736.279s] on and that&#39;s where we want to uh be and
[1740.399s] that&#39;s where we are and that&#39;s where
[1741.44s] we&#39;re positioned and we had a fun day in
[1743.12s] the market buying Boeing this morning
[1744.76s] buying some uh reloading on the
[1747.08s] long-dated Baba options we never touched
[1749.72s] a single share and we didn&#39;t add shares
[1752.44s] because our basis is so much lower
[1755.399s] because of all the uh beautiful
[1757.12s] opportunities that XI jingping gave us
[1759.6s] over the last 12 months uh so we don&#39;t
[1762.32s] buy up but we were able to reload on all
[1764.96s] the options that we took off at huge
[1767.039s] profits um uh uh on the initial Spike
[1770.44s] and this is the scenario notice no one
[1773.679s] is talking about David teer they were
[1775.399s] all talking about David terer when they
[1776.88s] were tripping over themselves to buy
[1778.679s] Alibaba at 118 now at 95 96 97 98 no one
[1784.799s] wants it everyone forgets he said God
[1787.519s] willing we get a pullback I&#39;m going to
[1789.679s] load up again and break my position
[1791.76s] limits again uh because they&#39;ll do more
[1794.72s] and do more and do more which I
[1796.159s] reiterated on Doug Kisner
[1798.559s] uh uh show on Bloomberg this over the
[1802.12s] weekend
[1803.679s] so there it is this is probably the most
[1806.159s] important chart you can understand for
[1807.559s] the next 7 to nine years this will be
[1809.96s] our Guiding Light for that period and we
[1812.2s] are positioned to take advantage Uh
[1814.279s] current a aggregate valuation metrics
[1816.559s] you see the S&amp;P 500 22 times where is
[1819.6s] value energy some energy 13 times
[1822.12s] financials 16 uh uh communication
[1826.48s] Services then health care there&#39;s some
[1829.6s] opportunities and so
[1834.799s] on uh there we go another chart that&#39;s
[1838.24s] telling us the same thing equal weight
[1839.76s] outperform which means mag 7 should
[1842.08s] underperform which has been the case
[1843.96s] since the summer when we took off our
[1846.84s] Amazon and most of our uh all of our
[1849.919s] Google uh Etc so there may be
[1853.039s] opportunities to reload on some of those
[1855.559s] um but uh there there have been plenty
[1858.48s] of other things to do uh earnings
[1860.48s] actually coming down in the last week so
[1862.279s] we&#39;re keeping an eye on this what does
[1863.519s] that imply with the heaviest weights
[1865.84s] being mag 7 that&#39;s a reasonable amount
[1868.48s] coming out of Mag 7 it may be a
[1870.72s] temporary slowdown but you have to keep
[1872.679s] an eye on this if you&#39;re index
[1874.76s] overweighted and not buying discret
[1876.88s] companies you&#39;re going to get hit the
[1881.24s] worst and the opportunity to make many
[1883.919s] doubles under the surface is riper than
[1886.72s] it&#39;s ever been and uh we&#39;re excited to
[1889.799s] to uh have gotten everyone to take
[1891.919s] advantage of of some of the things that
[1893.279s] have happened the last few days and uh
[1895.32s] may happen in the coming few days before
[1897.6s] the election and um we&#39;ll be very
[1899.96s] excited for that it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s
[1901.919s] basically like everyone who came in in
[1904.44s] Fall of 2022 and then March of
[1907.559s] 2023 I mean it was just uh Christmas
[1910.84s] time and uh and I think the same exact
[1913.159s] thing is happening right now and you&#39;re
[1914.799s] seeing it in your accounts with the work
[1916.519s] that we&#39;re doing on a daily basis to get
[1918.6s] you guys well positioned and it&#39;s it&#39;s
[1920.48s] super exciting and it&#39;s got to be super
[1922.2s] exciting for you for all the names that
[1923.96s] you see coming in that we haven&#39;t even
[1925.88s] begun to talk about yet so uh this is a
[1929.679s] S&amp;P earnings growth shows the green line
[1932.88s] remember this was negative last quarter
[1935.32s] the UNM magnificent 493 and two quarters
[1938.24s] ago this blue line which was the
[1939.679s] Magnificent 7 was at 50% now it&#39;s at Mid
[1942.72s] teens and the other one is ramping up
[1945.08s] and and next quarter Q4 is going to be
[1948.24s] the first uh coming out party for the
[1951.799s] unmagnify to hit double digit earnings
[1954.72s] growth baby we&#39;ve been talking about it
[1956.679s] and here we go so we are positioned for
[1960.0s] Sunshine uh 28 times Magnificent Seven
[1964.799s] earnings uh multiple versus 18 times
[1968.039s] equal weight that&#39;s where we find the
[1969.72s] opportunity to make Moola buyback
[1972.919s] authorizations have surged 21% year-to
[1975.519s] date I don&#39;t love that ladies and
[1977.399s] gentlemen that&#39;s the one thing I like
[1978.76s] about the Chinese that I can&#39;t stand
[1980.639s] about the American CEOs is the Chinese
[1983.799s] CEOs buy stock like crazy when their
[1986.32s] stock has been decimated and they know
[1988.039s] the intrinsic value the American CEOs
[1990.76s] buy stock when it&#39;s at all-time highs so
[1992.96s] they can dump their shares out in the
[1994.44s] market and absorb them with shareholders
[1996.24s] money I do not like that and uh and I
[1999.159s] won&#39;t participate it when I see that
[2000.96s] I&#39;ll I&#39;ll leave it to uh the retail
[2003.36s] people to be soing up that excess Supply
[2006.08s] from the CEOs dumping on their head CEO
[2008.799s] confidence has rebounded in recent
[2010.519s] quarters these are the type of things
[2012.279s] you see at recoveries at the beginning
[2015.159s] of bull cycles not at the end you can
[2017.639s] look back to uh 19 early 1990s after the
[2021.399s] recession you had CEO recovery 2001 to
[2024.88s] 2002 again over and over every single
[2027.96s] week if you guys learn that you&#39;re going
[2029.72s] to make fortunes that&#39;s just how it
[2031.36s] works 2009 same story and here we go
[2035.12s] ladies and gentlemen just coming off the
[2037.399s] mat which means more investment more
[2039.639s] excitement where do you get prices what
[2041.279s] you pay values what you get where do you
[2043.0s] get the most value for dollar well it&#39;s
[2044.559s] not the US you can see the multiples
[2046.519s] here it&#39;s not Japan uh Europe is where
[2050.2s] you start to see value emerging ma
[2052.119s] markets Big Value United Kingdom bigger
[2055.0s] value biggest value China China which by
[2059.44s] the way did better than anything else
[2061.76s] under Trump not under Biden so everyone
[2064.72s] thinking Trump with his 60% Bluster
[2067.359s] tarff s talk it&#39;s nonsense he wants to
[2070.24s] cut a deal and he will cut a deal and
[2073.24s] then he&#39;ll let China alone and uh and
[2076.44s] that&#39;s exactly what the world needs uh
[2078.52s] Mutual cooperation but no one taking
[2080.44s] advantage of of the other party and
[2082.44s] everyone wins so average small business
[2084.839s] credit card utilization rates have
[2086.28s] surpassed 2019 levels and are
[2088.48s] approaching a decade level high so
[2090.839s] that&#39;s good credit
[2092.399s] expansion forward pees you can see
[2095.599s] between Mega uh uh um uh magnificent 7
[2101.04s] followed by that&#39;s the pink line then
[2104.72s] orange I know lot a lot of you guys love
[2106.56s] to listen to this podcast while you run
[2108.52s] or or bike or golf if you can view it
[2112.48s] you get more value by seeing the charts
[2114.44s] but if you can only listen uh maybe look
[2117.04s] at it later uh that&#39;s great too I want I
[2119.839s] want to give you guys as much value as I
[2121.32s] possibly can in hopefully the shortest
[2123.52s] amount of time possible although there&#39;s
[2126.24s] just too much to cover uh forward PE
[2130.56s] ratios this is the US value at 17.2
[2135.0s] versus the all country World index xus
[2139.16s] is at 13.6 so there&#39;s a lot of value
[2141.8s] available around the world if you know
[2144.0s] how to seek it out and that&#39;s what we do
[2145.52s] day in and day out corporate insiders
[2147.4s] are cashing out right here you can see
[2150.52s] selling is pretty high near the
[2154.52s] 2021 uh early 2021 levels the market did
[2157.92s] rally till the end of 2021 so that&#39;s
[2160.0s] also something to keep in mind on a
[2161.599s] lagged basis corporate margin PE cor
[2165.0s] corporate margins are near all-time
[2166.92s] highs and are not yet showing signs of
[2169.04s] letting up so this is a positive thing
[2171.839s] uh unemployment rate we covered retail
[2174.599s] sales post solid gain in September
[2176.48s] showing a continued strong economy uh
[2179.48s] the beneficiaries were miscellaneous
[2181.2s] store retailers remember consumer
[2183.4s] discretionary pounding the table
[2185.079s] clothing and clothing accessories let&#39;s
[2186.8s] hope VF Corp falls into that bucket and
[2189.359s] Goose uh health and personal care Food
[2193.56s] Services in drinking places I still
[2195.079s] haven&#39;t found a restaurant yet uh got my
[2198.2s] eye on cracker bar not probably not
[2200.44s] going to do anything with that food and
[2202.24s] Beverages and what did poorly gas
[2204.44s] stations Furniture Electronics and
[2207.0s] Appliances Philadelphia fed
[2208.88s] Manufacturing Index going up uh
[2211.56s] manufacturing new orders going up
[2213.48s] remember we&#39;ve been in a Great
[2215.119s] Depression for manufacturing for Two
[2217.119s] Plus years it&#39;s starting to recover
[2219.24s] that&#39;s the next phase of the recovery um
[2222.359s] and Emerging Markets currencies
[2224.92s] outperform when global trade recovers
[2227.56s] and global trade has been recovering and
[2229.359s] it&#39;s just the beginning for emerging
[2230.68s] market currencies despite the short-term
[2233.359s] counter Trend rally in US dollar and in
[2237.76s] treasury yields we&#39;re going to talk a
[2239.88s] lot about that as we go forward on to
[2243.88s] home bu Builder sentiment starting to
[2245.68s] tick up uh China one-year Prime loan
[2249.52s] rate collapsing they continue to cut
[2251.839s] rates which is fantastic China Cuts
[2254.079s] Benchmark lending rates as easing push
[2256.24s] to boost economy continues uh China
[2259.079s] industrial production is now ticking up
[2261.8s] actually GDP came in slightly better
[2264.119s] than expected at 4.6% for the quarter
[2267.96s] industrial production absolutely
[2270.28s] skyrocketing off the mat in China
[2272.64s] industrial production you can see pimp
[2275.44s] Co says private credit is overvalued
[2277.68s] complacency spreads you think uh that&#39;s
[2280.92s] what said with uh
[2284.56s] utmost sarcasm sentiment is optimistic
[2287.839s] but not euphoric you know it&#39;s
[2293.72s] uh it is that time of year when you
[2296.92s] should get some Cho and we finally saw
[2298.56s] some this week um but I do think if the
[2304.4s] pro business PR growth policy candidate
[2308.72s] continues to pull and bet well in the
[2312.52s] betting markets um people are going to
[2315.839s] be very nervous to to sell too much
[2318.599s] stock ahead of that if it&#39;s super close
[2321.64s] is where I think you&#39;re going to see a
[2324.119s] little bit of trepidation going into the
[2326.56s] election uh and a little bit of
[2328.48s] choppiness but if it is as
[2330.8s] runaway as it appears right now which
[2333.16s] again I think is way too early to draw
[2334.92s] any conclusions but the TR friend is
[2337.76s] your
[2338.76s] friend uh you know it&#39;s going to be
[2342.079s] really hard to see these dips not get
[2344.44s] bought um so uh what did we have
[2353.119s] here okay so we had the biggest inflow
[2355.4s] followed by the biggest outflow so
[2357.2s] that&#39;s the retail people getting chopped
[2359.04s] up if you remember when Baba was at
[2360.96s] 11718 we said now they&#39;ve got to beat
[2363.599s] the stuffing out of these late Johnny
[2365.56s] come Lys who wouldn&#39;t buy it six in the
[2367.52s] 60s with us now they&#39;re they&#39;re tripping
[2369.76s] over themselves to get it at
[2371.88s] 11718 sold to you on the options we kept
[2374.68s] the stock and now in the high 90s we&#39;ve
[2376.88s] been adding back long-dated options and
[2378.76s] option spreads like it&#39;s going out of
[2380.52s] style uh and same thing Boeing I mean my
[2383.599s] fingers are you know we&#39;re busy when um
[2386.76s] my 10 key reads for Thursday gets posted
[2389.96s] on Twitter at 8:00 pm at night and I
[2391.96s] start the podcast at 8:30 so I&#39;ve been
[2395.16s] busier than a one arm paper hanger let&#39;s
[2396.88s] put it that way all right private
[2398.8s] clients bought mun dividends and utility
[2401.839s] ETFs uh just in time for yields to blow
[2404.599s] out this week so there you go uh the B
[2407.119s] and bear indicator is stretch but it&#39;s
[2409.119s] not at an extreme yet which is why we
[2411.04s] keep muddling higher uh profits matter
[2414.04s] more than politics at the end of the day
[2417.24s] the earnings growth was the key as we
[2419.68s] all know uh we&#39;ve got uh on the lowend
[2423.0s] 133% earnings growth expectations for
[2425.119s] 2025 it&#39;s between 13 to 15 has probably
[2427.68s] come down to 14 but we have not seen
[2429.64s] guidance from the major companies yet so
[2432.079s] let&#39;s uh not hold our breath let&#39;s see
[2434.079s] what happens and uh well not the Bas Cas
[2439.76s] tax cut oh yeah if the tax cut and jobs
[2443.599s] Act expires would represent the largest
[2446.56s] tax rise in history I think that&#39;s what
[2448.48s] the Market&#39;s a little bit relieved about
[2450.119s] which is why you&#39;ve seen a consistent
[2452.119s] rally throughout September and
[2456.24s] October in anticipation of uh good
[2459.2s] things happening and maybe that not
[2461.56s] expiring maybe that getting extended
[2463.72s] would be a very positive thing uh
[2466.28s] consumer sectors have fared better under
[2468.119s] Republicans so that would be uh consumer
[2471.16s] discretionary Consumer
[2473.2s] Staples
[2474.92s] uh net international migration has
[2478.599s] rebounded sharply following the end of
[2480.88s] the pandemic uh you think but actually
[2485.4s] if you go back it&#39;s kind of interesting
[2487.52s] because the last time we had this spike
[2490.16s] in net International immigration was
[2492.68s] when 20012 2002 uh which sets the stage
[2497.28s] for all the good things that we&#39;re
[2498.48s] talking about in the areas that we&#39;re
[2500.2s] positioned consumer industrial stocks
[2502.8s] sectors are the most labor
[2506.52s] intensive um consumer discretionary
[2508.8s] Industrials that would work those would
[2510.76s] do exceptionally well under the Trump
[2513.0s] trade if you remember in the Trump
[2515.68s] Administration uh the
[2518.04s] average people did a lot better than the
[2521.16s] people with assets and since uh uh the
[2526.599s] pandemic basically if you had assets I.E
[2529.64s] real estate and or equities you made a
[2532.56s] fortune and if you didn&#39;t uh you got
[2535.88s] smoked because you were forced to pay
[2539.28s] taxation material taxation without
[2541.96s] representation in the form of inflation
[2545.599s] inflation is a tax on the poor or
[2547.559s] brought to you by your government policy
[2550.48s] makers when they want to run inflation
[2553.44s] hot because they want to spend without
[2556.24s] collecting revenues and um and that&#39;s
[2559.4s] exactly what&#39;s taking place so uh in the
[2562.8s] administration before the current
[2564.16s] Administration what we started to see
[2566.0s] was massive wage growth among the
[2568.76s] working class uh and people were getting
[2571.72s] ahead and uh and that would be
[2573.559s] consistent with Industrials consumer
[2576.28s] discretionary Etc uh versus only the
[2579.72s] white collar sectors of tech making all
[2582.16s] the money Financial Services Etc uh
[2584.92s] China has accelerated purchasing semi
[2586.839s] manufacturing equipment since the semi
[2588.599s] extort band in 2022 to develop its own
[2592.96s] capacity and they&#39;re succeeding so a lot
[2595.4s] of this front-loaded stuff is now going
[2597.24s] to be felt by those companies that
[2599.52s] looked to be um impenetrable and that
[2603.76s] everyone chased the shiny object so
[2605.76s] we&#39;ll see how that plays out in coming
[2607.28s] quarters estimated stimulus is just a
[2609.76s] fraction of total cap capex so we see
[2612.8s] the capex estimates moving forward this
[2615.44s] game is just beginning that&#39;s going to
[2617.48s] accelerate that&#39;s going to be helpful
[2618.72s] for earnings you also have the reshoring
[2620.64s] trend and Manufacturing depending on the
[2622.96s] uh Administration that gets in in a in a
[2626.0s] handful of uh well it&#39;s a couple
[2628.68s] handfuls of days uh 10 years of
[2631.839s] underinvestment in US manufacturing this
[2634.04s] is just getting started so you want to
[2635.96s] take advantage of companies and sectors
[2638.92s] that will benefit from a mass recovery
[2642.2s] uh that&#39;s building that&#39;s construction
[2644.24s] that&#39;s uh Industrials that&#39;s you name it
[2647.44s] you know real stuff type of companies
[2649.4s] the type of companies that boomed small
[2651.64s] businesses like
[2653.319s] crazy uh mentions of reshoring near
[2656.72s] all-time highs I mean this is completely
[2658.92s] off the charts stuff is old we&#39;ve had
[2661.92s] basically
[2663.079s] no um non-residential fixed assets
[2667.359s] spending basically peaked in the 50s
[2671.119s] collapsed in the late 70s early 80 early
[2675.079s] 90s and uh is has just started to
[2678.359s] recover so there&#39;s going to be a lot of
[2680.079s] capb backs and uh spending fixed assets
[2683.8s] small cap sales growth highly correlated
[2686.24s] with capex growth so as this recovers
[2689.52s] and Manufacturing recovers what does
[2691.92s] best small caps uh which we&#39;re excited
[2695.559s] about uh much more more so than large
[2698.119s] caps uh historical Guide to the
[2704.44s] election okay presidential election year
[2707.04s] so the year before the election is the
[2708.599s] best the election year is second best
[2711.319s] the year after the election is just fine
[2713.76s] and then the midterm years are the worst
[2715.52s] so keep that in mind uh Democratic
[2718.2s] presidential split so this is a bunch of
[2723.44s] uh okay year after the election post
[2726.04s] World War II Market stronger returns
[2727.839s] when the same party remained in control
[2730.72s] well we&#39;ll see if that happens it&#39;s not
[2733.44s] pointing to that right now so we&#39;ll keep
[2735.2s] an eye open to it uh in election years
[2737.88s] small caps typically sell off in October
[2740.599s] which happened and then rally in
[2741.8s] November December that not only happens
[2743.92s] in election years where small caps rally
[2746.04s] like crazy in November and December that
[2748.16s] happens in every year if you look at
[2749.4s] Cooper sard stock it it has its biggest
[2751.8s] moves often times in November and
[2753.559s] December along with small caps and yes
[2756.4s] we were in the market buying more
[2759.2s] CPS uh in election years that doesn&#39;t
[2762.24s] mean you should I&#39;m just telling you
[2764.44s] that&#39;s what we were doing opinion not
[2766.24s] advice in election years small caps
[2768.88s] typically underperform large caps and
[2771.68s] outperform the
[2773.8s] following following the election through
[2776.76s] year end look at this chart with small
[2780.079s] caps in November and December October
[2782.319s] week November December through the roof
[2785.2s] uh very exciting times
[2787.44s] so far so good with a 5% earnings beat
[2789.88s] Led Led by financials that they&#39;re
[2791.24s] talking about earnings season so
[2793.559s] far
[2796.64s] uh using rate pressure to translate by
[2799.64s] the way you know they&#39;re talking about
[2801.319s] falling interest rate U mortgage rates
[2803.28s] that&#39;s not happening yet this is a
[2805.839s] counter Trend rally I&#39;m telling you that
[2808.0s] right now that um we&#39;re going to talk
[2811.16s] about October is the worst month of the
[2813.0s] year for bonds November is the best
[2815.319s] month so as we talked about with Stu
[2818.76s] vanney Stuart vanney sell the rumor
[2822.48s] selling bonds October bu the news in
[2825.72s] November yields will compress mortgage
[2828.04s] rates will go back
[2829.96s] down improving sentiment suggests re
[2832.359s] accelerating EPS growth in Q4 in line
[2834.92s] with consensus so this was a trough Q3
[2838.2s] kind of layo earnings followed by Q4
[2841.599s] should be back up to uh big time growth
[2846.0s] positive reaction to beats most positive
[2848.28s] reactions to beats since second quarter
[2850.96s] of
[2851.88s] 2012 so that has not been the case up
[2855.0s] till now and now people are getting
[2856.72s] optimistic when companies beat they
[2858.559s] really drive them up so that&#39;s really
[2860.44s] good uh and not only have beats out
[2862.92s] perform but
[2864.16s] misses uh haven&#39;t gone down as much
[2866.92s] which is consistent with a bull
[2870.839s] market uh this is from Bank of America a
[2873.48s] tax hike to 28% from 21% is expected to
[2876.599s] be a a 5% hit to EPS that&#39;s the Harris
[2879.839s] Administration proposal so that would
[2882.64s] imply the S&amp;P goes down uh a tax cut to
[2885.96s] 15% from 21% could be an estimated 4%
[2889.04s] benefit to S&amp;P 500 EPS uh I would bet
[2894.319s] zero on that happening but uh you never
[2896.599s] know if you get a sweep which I I
[2899.48s] wouldn&#39;t bet on either but um I don&#39;t
[2902.839s] know people that are much smarter in
[2904.079s] politics than I am seem awfully
[2905.92s] confident but
[2907.599s] uh you know I I would
[2912.44s] not make any major economic decisions on
[2915.319s] the basis of that speculation
[2917.119s] geographical sales
[2918.839s] exposure this shows
[2921.28s] that North American based companies have
[2923.96s] still have 71% exposure in the
[2926.8s] US
[2928.359s] um and then 29% the rest of the world
[2931.4s] European companies have only 21% in the
[2933.96s] US Japanese 15 and Asian countries are
[2937.52s] getting all which makes sense but
[2939.2s] actually is it&#39;s nice to see it
[2943.319s] colorcoded uh here we go an investment
[2946.4s] year in
[2948.2s] 2025 looks priced the recent discount to
[2953.2s] S&amp;P PE multiple reflects concerns over
[2957.24s] Parks over earning and a lack of
[2959.68s] conviction in long-term streaming
[2961.4s] profits so what they&#39;re saying here is
[2965.28s] the Disney premium versus discount to
[2968.76s] the S&amp;P 500 forward PE ratio and the one
[2972.92s] thing you&#39;ll notice is in those rare
[2975.04s] instances when Disney was trading at
[2977.76s] such a multiple discount to the SNP
[2983.52s] preceded monster Allstar rallies in
[2986.48s] Disney we love Disney we own Disney
[2990.28s] we uh buy Disney we visit Disney we
[2994.799s] everything Disney so happy Disney we
[2998.2s] expect a
[2999.44s] reacceleration of experiences and by the
[3002.4s] way I me talk about the most nonsense
[3005.2s] announcement that they made they made a
[3006.839s] few announcements this week number one
[3009.0s] uh they&#39;re going to let you cut the line
[3011.0s] uh I guess they have another way to cut
[3013.319s] the line without getting the special uh
[3015.76s] one-on-one
[3017.119s] tours uh so basically they&#39;re going to
[3020.04s] collect more revenues doing that they&#39;re
[3022.44s] raising the annual ticket prices and
[3024.599s] they announced that they&#39;re going to
[3026.16s] announce that they&#39;re going to announce
[3028.04s] sometime in 26 who they&#39;re going to
[3030.24s] announce as the successor to Bob Iger
[3032.72s] which means uh you can take the mantle
[3035.119s] of leadership from his cold dead hands
[3037.16s] because he&#39;s not going
[3038.799s] anywhere he realized that the minute you
[3041.599s] retire uh and you get in the back of the
[3043.76s] car there&#39;s no one in the front to hit
[3045.319s] the gas so and your phone stops ringing
[3048.799s] so he decided uh uh yeah I&#39;m going to
[3051.079s] hang out to this until death so uh so
[3053.76s] that&#39;s not a horrible thing Iger will be
[3055.4s] fine uh until eventually they push him
[3058.28s] out but um for now it&#39;s great we expect
[3060.96s] a re acceleration of experiences
[3063.2s] operating income growth
[3065.079s] in fiscal year 2026 as part of U cruise
[3069.599s] ship startup cost flip to
[3071.64s] profits so you can see uh Parks
[3074.88s] including cruises total experiences just
[3078.119s] super duper re acceleration out to
[3081.24s] fiscal year
[3083.16s] 2026 2027 2028 off the chart
[3087.16s] and then you see operating income from
[3090.599s] Disney&#39;s entertainment assets saw
[3093.079s] meaningful earnings growth in fiscal
[3094.559s] year 2024 led by Falling streaming
[3097.72s] losses so they went break even on
[3099.76s] streaming and all of a sudden the
[3101.24s] operating income is booming and no one&#39;s
[3104.48s] giving the them any credit as a matter
[3106.28s] of fact the the stock right now is just
[3108.319s] basically priced for the experiences and
[3110.24s] the products and you get all the
[3112.559s] entertainment for free including ESPN
[3114.64s] Disney the movies the Hulu etc etc etc
[3118.48s] And yet when you look out a couple years
[3120.52s] you see $19 billion of operating income
[3122.92s] that had zero value ascribe to it so uh
[3126.079s] what else you want to talk about this is
[3127.92s] price is what you pay value is what you
[3129.559s] get uh quote we see improving DTC
[3132.88s] profitability as the primary driver of
[3135.04s] entertainment growth ahead this is from
[3138.64s] Morgan Stanley by the way now that
[3141.04s] streaming has reached profitability
[3142.559s] Disney is focused on managing down okay
[3145.359s] so that&#39;s that uh US Government bond
[3147.559s] yield another counter Trend rally we
[3150.24s] will show you the seasonality behind
[3152.52s] that dollar counter Trend rally we will
[3154.72s] show you the seasonality behind that uh
[3157.28s] corporate sentiment indicators tracking
[3158.92s] at a record level so far this earning
[3160.52s] season what is that consistent with it&#39;s
[3162.64s] consistent with the beginning of
[3164.079s] recoveries not the tops and uh you could
[3167.4s] see here in 2011 and if you look back to
[3169.68s] the early 2000s was a similar story
[3172.76s] Chinese consumers will respond to
[3174.52s] incentives what you saw was incentives
[3176.88s] in household appliances recently and
[3179.559s] what did you see sales of household
[3181.64s] appliances went through the roof expect
[3184.24s] to see more of that in retail and with
[3186.96s] Alibaba as the toll taker of the retail
[3190.04s] business in China to quote my friend in
[3193.72s] Dubai uh who I&#39;m GNA go out and see
[3196.359s] sometime in
[3198.4s] q1
[3200.0s] um they&#39;ll take advantage car sales in
[3202.599s] China in September were the highest for
[3205.16s] 2024
[3208.119s] uh so that&#39;s that what do we have here
[3211.28s] this
[3214.2s] is oh the big major events coming up in
[3216.88s] the next few weeks you have October
[3219.319s] payrolls in the first Friday
[3221.88s] of uh that would be not first Friday of
[3226.88s] November for October that&#39;s before the
[3229.68s] next fomc meeting so that&#39;s going to be
[3231.4s] a critical volatility day uh first
[3234.52s] Friday of November
[3237.16s] uh then you have the US elections then
[3239.28s] you have the fomc then you have October
[3241.76s] CPI and then you have Nvidia earnings
[3244.0s] the third week of November so a lot of
[3245.64s] big volatility days and as you can see
[3248.0s] here breath continues to broaden the
[3250.28s] advanced decline line for the S&amp;P 500
[3252.88s] skyrocketing midcap skyrocketing small
[3255.319s] cap skyrocketing this is a good thing
[3257.92s] and overall margins are at highs next
[3261.28s] 12-month profit margin
[3263.799s] 13.6% highest ever is unbelievable
[3267.72s] insiders are selling into the strength
[3269.64s] as we talked about so um I&#39;d be
[3273.64s] cognizant where that uh is rampant and
[3278.04s] stay away and we&#39;ve talked about that in
[3280.359s] many past weeks the combined property
[3282.68s] losses from Helen and Milton are likely
[3284.52s] amongst the top 10 hurricanes since
[3287.64s] World War II uh we haven&#39;t seen anything
[3291.319s] like that since
[3294.0s] 2017 with Harvey and
[3300.079s] and
[3301.799s] Maria okay I guess Harvey and Maria and
[3304.68s] if you recall we covered a few weeks ago
[3307.4s] there was a total loss of
[3309.44s] 623,000 cars total loss which led to the
[3314.079s] highest SAA SAR of the cycle which led
[3318.04s] to $146 stock price for Cooper standard
[3322.76s] on $719 of earnings so this is not at
[3326.92s] that levels of Ian but it&#39;s close I
[3329.92s] think we&#39;re going to see a decent amount
[3331.4s] of car loss and you
[3333.799s] saw um the GM earnings they had a big
[3337.359s] amount of pull forward in US truck
[3340.96s] production in the most recent
[3343.64s] quarter uh so that bodess well for
[3346.64s] Cooper standard it&#39;s all about volume
[3348.92s] and uh this could be a contributing
[3351.0s] factor to help into a
[3353.64s] yearend uh rally with small cap which
[3356.72s] would potentially make this uh one of
[3359.2s] the most incredible uh situations that
[3362.2s] we could think of so uh
[3364.599s] BuyBacks corporate clients hit record
[3366.88s] highs in
[3368.96s] June well above
[3371.72s] Trend rolling four-week average Trends
[3374.48s] by market cap large cap inflows since
[3376.64s] April are up midcaps have been down
[3380.88s] small caps have been up the past 3
[3383.72s] weeks uh we covered large caps midcaps
[3388.68s] are just turning up now
[3392.2s] recently small cap inflows since June
[3396.4s] have been pretty
[3398.76s] solid US Financial conditions turning up
[3402.76s] fiveyear uh inflation break evens are
[3405.24s] back to
[3406.92s] 2.2 and change it looks like
[3409.92s] 2.25 so that&#39;s pretty good uh that&#39;s
[3412.799s] inflation expectations which the FED
[3414.44s] watch very closely we talked about the
[3416.76s] low valuations
[3418.44s] xus uh which implies International which
[3420.88s] implies what 2002 to 2007 who will win
[3423.359s] the presidential election here is Ki
[3426.359s] this is one of the
[3427.799s] betting um things that everyone goes to
[3431.119s] it&#39;s showing 59 Trump 41 Cala I mean
[3434.24s] this stuff can be misleading so don&#39;t
[3435.76s] get faked out but the market it feels
[3438.48s] like the market is pricing in this this
[3440.28s] outcome and we just need to be cognizant
[3442.359s] of it uh irrespective of which side
[3444.559s] you&#39;re on politically it makes no
[3445.839s] difference here we are on the side of
[3447.76s] making money uh by by following a solid
[3451.039s] framework and being patient and playing
[3453.039s] the time Arbitrage game non-financial
[3455.4s] corporate business net interest payment
[3456.799s] near record lows this shows corporate
[3458.68s] balance sheets are doing
[3460.24s] great
[3465.4s] um corporate client buybacks on track
[3468.039s] for record year S&amp;P company tax rate has
[3471.28s] declined over the past several decades
[3473.0s] you can see that here I mean this is
[3475.039s] really really low
[3476.799s] uh seasonal okay we&#39;re going to cover
[3479.44s] that in the uh article of the week
[3481.2s] markets are pricing in fewer fed cuts
[3483.92s] that is a function of good economic data
[3487.0s] I think we&#39;re still going to get the
[3488.72s] November 25 we&#39;ll see about the December
[3492.68s] uh wouldn&#39;t surprise me either way but
[3495.2s] uh lot lot of things in the works now so
[3497.319s] we&#39;ll see what happens Eurozone consumer
[3499.2s] confidence has been going straight up
[3501.52s] that&#39;s a good thing uh us beige book
[3504.28s] activity same thing you see at at every
[3506.52s] recovery you have the first initial
[3508.24s] rally off the death nail like we did in
[3510.599s] 2020 big rally and then you just check
[3512.72s] back and say hello before the next move
[3514.68s] up very similar to the mid uh 885 decade
[3518.72s] off of the last steep tightening cycle
[3521.599s] we saw from 80 to 82 you had that Spike
[3525.039s] and then you had this test back and then
[3526.64s] you had a continued recovery through the
[3529.0s] early 90s when you had a mild recession
[3532.079s] and um so this implies several more
[3534.799s] years of Runway I was talking to a
[3536.52s] friend uh over the I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
[3539.52s] remember when but it was about um you
[3543.68s] know the average recession you get a
[3545.2s] recession every 4.1 years you have to
[3547.72s] keep in mind we have had two in the last
[3550.359s] four years which does imply I.E 2022 two
[3554.559s] qus of uh negative GDP growth and that&#39;s
[3557.599s] what positioned us perfectly in the
[3560.079s] trough of 2022 when we were pounding the
[3562.52s] table to buy in the hole and everyone
[3564.24s] else was selling in the hole for
[3566.079s] recession and I contined to say I
[3567.68s] remember this was on Charles Payne show
[3569.28s] everyone&#39;s preparing for a recession we
[3570.88s] just had in the rearview mirror we had
[3572.88s] two quarters of negative GDP growth in
[3574.88s] 2022 look it up that&#39;s a technical
[3577.079s] recession whether the government wanted
[3578.52s] to label it or not is I do I could care
[3580.92s] less um you know what what&#39;s that old
[3583.72s] thing if it looks like uh it probably is
[3586.44s] anyway I&#39;ll leave that to you uh and
[3589.4s] then 20120 so 2020 we had a recession
[3592.0s] 2022 we had a recession which implies
[3594.4s] we&#39;re not due for another 8 years if you
[3596.359s] take four years on a another six years
[3598.52s] if you take every four years on average
[3601.16s] 2000 it would have been 2004 but we had
[3603.52s] it pulled forward in
[3605.2s] 2022 uh and then the next one would be
[3607.839s] uh 2028 so that
[3610.319s] implies uh at least another four years
[3612.72s] from
[3613.839s] here so
[3617.319s] um latest us Bond selloff Echoes the one
[3621.079s] after the 1995 fed cut we&#39;ve been making
[3624.119s] the case for a long time that this was a
[3626.44s] midcycle cut just like 1995 which is why
[3629.72s] I&#39;m in the camp that um we may wind up
[3634.16s] with a higher terminal rate than
[3636.64s] everyone thinks uh everyone thinks it
[3639.079s] has to go down to three or two and a
[3641.4s] half to get to inflation I think
[3643.24s] inflation is going to run higher like we
[3645.96s] did post World War II uh three three and
[3648.88s] a half maybe four in a band of 2 and a
[3651.52s] half to four uh to bring down debt to
[3654.44s] GDP ratio inflate away
[3656.76s] uh like we&#39;ve always done and um this is
[3662.119s] very very interesting here
[3665.599s] because
[3667.44s] the so I&#39;m going to show you what
[3671.52s] happened two times number one was
[3676.799s] 1995 the last time you had this midcycle
[3679.0s] cut and you saw this fake out counter
[3681.44s] Trend rally in yields right after the
[3683.44s] first cut
[3686.599s] where yields Rose 50 basis points so
[3689.96s] here we are this is the long Bond I
[3691.96s] think this is the 30-year
[3694.799s] 1995 so you had the same
[3697.359s] collapse in bonds spike in yields into
[3701.0s] the first cut and then you rally higher
[3704.319s] and then you get these check backs and
[3706.319s] consolidations checkback and
[3708.559s] consolidation
[3710.799s] before moving moving higher in bonds
[3714.039s] lower in yields over the insu
[3716.64s] years so that&#39;s the 1995 story but then
[3720.24s] you look here at te treasury Futures put
[3723.68s] call skew and we&#39;ve covered skew on
[3727.16s] Equity options for quite some time uh
[3730.279s] and and particularly in recent weeks and
[3732.2s] and have talked quite a lot but skew on
[3735.96s] treasuries
[3737.319s] I.E
[3739.119s] purchasing options one and two standard
[3741.44s] deviations out for huge moves has never
[3744.68s] been
[3746.4s] uh bigger than it is right now and the
[3748.4s] last time it got this extended meaning
[3751.96s] people were short treasuries was
[3755.319s] September of 2023 when we were pounding
[3758.599s] the table to buy bonds and that yields
[3762.119s] were going to compress and that was the
[3763.839s] Peak at 5% 10-year Treasury and sure
[3767.0s] enough there is your September
[3769.68s] 2023 with a a 107 low here on this uh
[3774.16s] 30-year Bond and uh straight up rally
[3777.4s] pretty much ever since now a little
[3779.48s] consolidation before we make the next
[3781.559s] move higher uh here is a survey from
[3785.44s] Alpine macro did you overweight buy
[3787.52s] Chinese stocks based on beijing&#39;s latest
[3789.24s] policy changes and the vast majority
[3792.0s] were saying yes due to a tactical
[3795.0s] upgrade um uh the ones who said no said
[3798.76s] they were waiting for a bigger package
[3801.16s] and then there was a group that said yes
[3803.2s] expecting major reating we&#39;re kind of in
[3805.4s] the ladder Camp expecting a major
[3807.359s] reating over time do the math which is
[3811.039s] code for opinion follows Trend China May
[3813.44s] raise the quota on special purpose
[3815.0s] municipal bonds we we covered that in
[3816.92s] recent weeks it&#39;ll be about $859 billion
[3819.52s] dollar of stimulus just shy of a
[3821.64s] trillion US Dollars over the next three
[3823.72s] years uh that will be more than enough
[3826.16s] here&#39;s another poll oh that&#39;s the Ki
[3828.359s] poll then you&#39;ve got um
[3833.359s] predicted uh continuing claims have
[3836.16s] pushed higher this is a very important
[3838.039s] number to watch if uh this is reflected
[3840.599s] in the jobs report the first Friday you
[3842.559s] can be assured that in November the 95%
[3845.799s] odds that are currently in for 25 basis
[3847.68s] point cut will be
[3849.96s] fulfilled uh initial came down but
[3852.76s] that&#39;s uh very noisy from week to week
[3855.119s] and it was coming off an enormous spike
[3857.559s] in September and that&#39;s that for the uh
[3860.88s] charts of the week Disney World
[3862.76s] Disneyland launch new pass to skip long
[3864.64s] lines for a heft price we like Hefty
[3867.079s] prices as
[3868.64s] owners um 400 bucks a day that&#39;s really
[3873.039s] cheap

[3880.559s] them Alibaba Cloud&#39;s AI technology
[3883.119s] Sparks breakthrough in RNA virus
[3886.079s] Discovery so all these things that we&#39;re
[3887.559s] not getting paid for yet which we will
[3889.16s] in the future Intel to sell minority
[3891.44s] stake in Altera for 17 billion Oh I
[3894.079s] thought they were going out of business
[3895.16s] oh yeah that they selling off this tiny
[3896.559s] part of their business for $17 billion
[3898.44s] by the way so it&#39;s all part of a bigger
[3900.359s] turnaround plan Amazon exec tells
[3903.0s] employees to quit if they don&#39;t want to
[3904.359s] work five days a week in the office
[3906.559s] commercial continues to come back he
[3908.72s] made a fiser a household name Wall
[3911.119s] Street wants more so you got starboard
[3913.079s] value in uh fizer now that&#39;s going to be
[3916.64s] a heavy LIF but we keep our eyes on it
[3918.44s] that one could be interesting it&#39;s just
[3920.279s] there&#39;s nothing we really want to sell
[3921.52s] to put in its place but uh we will
[3923.48s] continue to keep an eye on that um uh
[3926.359s] this shows that spending is the problem
[3928.839s] not taxes so if the polls and uh betting
[3932.4s] odds are correct and musk comes in and
[3935.64s] does this spending cut program you know
[3938.72s] the thing about musk is all the things
[3940.64s] that people say are impossible and can&#39;t
[3942.68s] be done he finds a way to do to do it so
[3945.599s] on that basis if he could actually
[3947.2s] normalize spending then we could keep
[3948.839s] tax rates low and it would be the
[3950.92s] formula for an absolute boom less
[3953.68s] regulation less spending
[3956.599s] uh more money in the hands of private
[3959.319s] business owners who know how to allocate
[3961.119s] much better than government bureaucrats

[4039.2s] hour before the event these are the
[4041.039s] nicest people I&#39;ve ever met and uh it&#39;s
[4043.599s] funny I went back the next morning and I
[4045.68s] looked at the stock I said this thing is
[4047.0s] perfect I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s great uh
[4050.799s] and I just said I&#39;d just like it to come
[4052.319s] down a little bit lower and sure enough
[4053.92s] the next day um some activist came in
[4057.799s] and the stock shot up 8% so we&#39;ll keep
[4059.559s] an eye on that one if it comes back down
[4061.279s] quite a bit uh we&#39;d be interested in
[4063.559s] taking a look uh all the Staples are a
[4066.0s] little bit elevated right now so I&#39;d
[4067.599s] want I&#39;d want a opportunity to buy it
[4069.559s] cheaper but he&#39;s got a great group of
[4070.88s] Brands spun out of
[4073.119s] J&amp;J um
[4075.64s] in all Band-Aid brand uh all the
[4079.319s] consumer products from Legacy J&amp;J which
[4081.359s] is pretty exciting and I think he&#39;s
[4083.799s] generally doing a great job uh us
[4086.799s] continues to surprise to the upside
[4088.44s] that&#39;s from yardeni that&#39;s the economic
[4090.279s] uh surprise index which we&#39;ve covered
[4092.24s] crisis at Boeing and Intel are a
[4093.799s] National Emergency not only are they a
[4096.12s] national emergency but the national
[4097.799s] government is going to back stop them so
[4100.159s] that&#39;s why we continue to add on
[4102.0s] weakness for both of these companies uh
[4104.839s] and I think they&#39;re be enormous
[4106.239s] opportunities Boeing is a duopoly which
[4108.679s] we covered a million times and Intel the
[4112.0s] government has no choice but to prop up
[4113.96s] their Foundry business just like they
[4115.48s] propped up Elon musk&#39;s uh EV business
[4119.359s] because it was an initiative of the uh
[4121.719s] US government to subsidize it until it
[4124.239s] became profitable on its own which we
[4126.279s] also covered ironically on Neil Kabuto
[4129.08s] today and they will do the exact same
[4131.56s] thing to
[4133.96s] Intel until they get get their
[4135.679s] foundaries and can compete with Taiwan
[4137.759s] semiconductor and so everyone chasing
[4140.08s] all these uh guys who design chips they
[4145.08s] are completely worthless without the
[4147.159s] people that make the chips Taiwan
[4149.359s] semiconductor and soon to be Intel
[4151.88s] insiders are selling into the great bull
[4153.4s] market of 2024 we covered uh with steady
[4156.679s] sales new vehicle inventory begins to
[4158.359s] look and feel normal uh getting back to
[4161.56s] 2019 levels which means what we are
[4164.0s] going to start to get more and more
[4165.88s] incentives and more and more price
[4168.319s] reductions and more and more interest
[4170.44s] rate reductions from the fed and the
[4172.44s] game is going to hum for Cooper standard
[4176.719s] opinion the stock market is ready for
[4178.759s] its melt up as investors ignore growing
[4181.839s] risks uh who&#39;s this
[4191.839s] from uh
[4197.199s] Ed yard Denny okay Intel plans to form
[4200.679s] Foundry alliance with Samsung so they&#39;re
[4202.679s] basically three major foundaries in the
[4204.76s] world Samsung Taiwan semiconductor and
[4208.64s] Intel that Alliance is a good thing not
[4211.56s] a bad thing GM stock had its best day
[4213.8s] since 2020 after the auto America tops
[4216.88s] wall Street&#39;s third quarter expectations
[4219.12s] and raises guidance he talked about the
[4220.92s] pull forward in truck production so
[4222.6s] that&#39;s all good for Cooper standard uh
[4225.36s] China stock market could enjoy instant
[4227.04s] Boost from two trillion Yuan fund says
[4229.52s] Think
[4230.36s] Tank says the fund would enhance the
[4232.6s] stability of the capital market and
[4233.84s] promote steady growth so all these
[4235.96s] things are happening in the background
[4238.239s] and all the people who bought up at 120
[4240.239s] are puking at 95 just before it goes to
[4243.28s] 140 and Beyond Traders enthusiasm for
[4245.92s] stocks return to levels seen just before
[4248.36s] 10% drop last year that&#39;s from City Bank
[4252.08s] um always wrong never in doubt but
[4255.52s] certainly plausible America is primed
[4257.88s] for a home renovation resurgent with
[4261.32s] rates coming down that benefits Stanley
[4263.64s] Black and&amp; Decker that benefits gener uh
[4266.76s] that benefits uh a lot of lot of great
[4269.84s] companies that have been left behind
[4273.239s] Disney is going to cost more to visit
[4275.36s] Disney World for the holidays next year
[4279.92s] um so you
[4282.28s] know instead of buying the tickets buy
[4284.52s] the stock feds daily says she doesn&#39;t
[4287.28s] see reasons to stop cutting rates we
[4289.76s] agree uh Insider selling soures to
[4292.4s] three-year highs in the US while China
[4295.28s] buyback surg to record at lows this is
[4298.719s] the kind of Divergence so what do we
[4300.679s] want to do we want to buy the stock that
[4302.8s] us insiders are selling and here he has
[4304.44s] the chart of Nvidia with all the Insider
[4308.159s] sales um it&#39;s just funny I mean they&#39;re
[4310.719s] almost perfect they sell at these Peaks
[4313.56s] they don&#39;t sell in the hole they sell
[4315.239s] sell at the Peaks to the retail
[4316.84s] announced stockit splits they stop
[4318.84s] selling down here they sell at the Peaks
[4320.719s] you&#39;re going to see a ton of stock
[4321.76s] dumped on heads in the next few weeks
[4324.0s] and on and on and on Europe&#39;s rate Cuts
[4326.36s] will lift stocks where to find Value the
[4328.92s] massive flooring company says the
[4330.32s] housing market will get better next year
[4332.0s] that&#39;s from Mohawk
[4333.8s] Industries uh Boeing workers reject a
[4337.239s] $23,000 pay raise what comes next half
[4340.28s] of them get fired and then the strike
[4342.0s] gets done Tail of Two Cities stock
[4344.32s] market incent this shows TLT seasonality
[4348.6s] over the past 20 years it shows that uh
[4352.48s] this is October is the worst month for
[4354.76s] bonds meaning yields rise November is
[4357.84s] the best Bond uh month for bonds prices
[4361.56s] rise yields
[4363.4s] fall uh so expect to see the same
[4367.56s] thing uh okay update regarding the union
[4370.84s] workers rejected the 35% pay raise in
[4373.719s] bonuses expect Boeing to announce
[4375.36s] another round of layoffs in the next two
[4376.88s] days and raise $10 billion plus of
[4378.88s] capital to starve out or weight out the
[4380.76s] union facts the union head earns 330,000
[4383.52s] a year 33,000 Boeing Strikers are
[4386.04s] getting paid $250 a week with no
[4387.96s] salaries many of which have normally six
[4390.4s] figure incomes this is costing the union
[4393.679s] $8.25 million per week the union started
[4396.48s] with $300 million of assets it has been
[4398.88s] depleted for 5 weeks which is 8.25 * 5
[4402.8s] is 41 million this implies the the IMA
[4405.639s] has less than 260 million left the
[4408.04s] problem is there are 530,000 members of
[4410.239s] the IM Union so Boeing workers only
[4413.199s] represent 6% of this Union&#39;s member and
[4415.56s] they have already depleted 133% of the
[4417.52s] total assets in 5 weeks if you were the
[4419.84s] other 500,000 nonbing members who had
[4422.639s] contributed dues for years how
[4424.88s] comfortable would you be to see your
[4426.28s] reserves dwindling into the abyss the
[4428.48s] only reason you contribute is so that
[4430.239s] money is there if you go on a strike
[4431.96s] they pay you uh $250 a week while you&#39;re
[4434.6s] on the strike but if Boeing uses up all
[4436.32s] the money you get nothing and they get
[4439.239s] nothing so meanwhile the strike is
[4441.08s] costing Boeing a billion dollars a month
[4442.8s] they can raise 1010 billion in a minute
[4445.08s] and wait them out for 10 months or if
[4446.639s] they raise $20 billion in a combination
[4448.6s] of debt and Equity wait them out for
[4450.52s] over a year and a half by the way for
[4452.639s] everyone worried about delution if they
[4454.239s] raised $20 billion of all Equity
[4456.239s] tomorrow which they wouldn&#39;t it would
[4457.8s] only take the share count back to 2014
[4460.48s] levels they have repurchased billions of
[4462.92s] dollars of stock over the last decade
[4464.639s] meanwhile
[4465.56s] the union cannot go raise money in the
[4467.679s] public markets at the drop of a hat they
[4469.76s] rely on contributions from working union
[4473.239s] members 6% of whom are not working the
[4476.32s] union will cease to exist in 31.5 weeks
[4479.56s] just over half of a year as 6% of the
[4482.159s] union members from Boeing will have
[4483.719s] burned through 100% of the cash in
[4487.719s] addition to the union being unable to
[4489.639s] compete with Boeing on a waiting game
[4491.52s] due to their inability to raise 10
[4493.08s] billion in the public markets overnight
[4495.199s] the workers who are not receiving
[4496.719s] salaries and getting paid $250 a week by
[4499.199s] the union are running desperately behind
[4501.96s] on their mortgages car payments and
[4504.159s] other bills many who have now rejected a
[4506.84s] 35% pay raise plus bonuses will find
[4509.84s] themselves with a 100% pay loss as the
[4512.84s] next round of 177,000 cuts is imminent
[4516.12s] so that&#39;s the story
[4518.639s] there um covered that Tale of Two
[4523.159s] Cities the themes here here um mags 493
[4528.84s] great unmagnify out before mag 7 with a
[4532.76s] progrowth White House small caps
[4534.52s] outperform large caps values outperform
[4536.28s] growth Emerging Markets outperform
[4538.199s] developed markets uh money coming in out
[4541.04s] of bonds and
[4543.199s] into so we covered this the last time
[4546.44s] that this much money came out of
[4548.719s] bonds uh October 2024 two standard
[4551.76s] deviations worth was 20
[4556.08s] 2002 2001 2002 2003 and what happened
[4559.199s] over the next seven years well you had
[4562.04s] um small caps have the biggest rally one
[4564.639s] of their biggest rallies in history over
[4566.36s] the next few years uh emerging markets
[4569.239s] and then China had their biggest of all
[4571.56s] time
[4573.159s] so that&#39;s that we covered and then
[4575.6s] seasonality where are we are we here
[4578.36s] which would be uh S&amp;P seasonal composite
[4582.679s] since 1928 the bottom go is in on
[4586.6s] October
[4589.76s] 20 7th and then you start to
[4593.239s] Rally uh into year end could be
[4599.76s] there and this is another seasonal
[4602.08s] composite during election years where
[4603.679s] you get a little bit more weakness into
[4605.56s] the end of October and then you rally
[4606.96s] into the end of the year either way this
[4608.4s] Mor of the story is rallying to the end
[4609.8s] of the year uh fear and greed is still
[4611.92s] not an extreme greed neither is a
[4614.92s] Association of active investment
[4616.92s] managers uh retail earnings top 30
[4620.76s] weights uh estimate revisions in the
[4623.0s] last 60 days were down
[4625.44s] 1.7% transports were also down
[4629.719s] 1.62% estimates down for
[4632.6s] 2025 uh from 277 to 275 so keeping an
[4636.719s] eye on that I think that will bounce up
[4638.28s] after we get through the middle of
[4640.6s] earning
[4643.48s] season uh uh we covered
[4647.32s] that and now okay so now we&#39;re on to the
[4650.96s] ask me anything questions the podcast is
[4652.88s] officially over uh but many of you like
[4655.32s] to stick around for the ask me anything
[4659.32s] questions which we&#39;re going to get to
[4661.04s] right
[4662.36s] now
[4664.44s] so this comes
[4667.44s] from Aaron L hey Tom always look forward
[4670.48s] to weekly podcast video cast was hoping
[4672.12s] you could take a look at PBF energy PBF
[4674.84s] interested to hear your thoughts thanks
[4676.44s] okay Alan thanks for sending that in
[4678.719s] let&#39;s look at
[4688.92s] PBF okay so it&#39;s up 10x but it&#39;s dropped
[4691.6s] 50% from the peak after being up
[4694.92s] 20x uh let&#39;s
[4701.8s] see PBF
[4704.96s] look I I think Energy&#39;s going to
[4706.719s] actually get a rally
[4709.239s] but uh so you know revenues are down
[4712.0s] they&#39;re just recovering cash flow I
[4714.88s] think there are higher and better uses
[4716.4s] it&#39;s not bad but I I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t
[4718.12s] buy it here um leave it at that that&#39;s
[4720.48s] just from a lot of experience Sam R
[4722.96s] thoughts on ADM stock Archer Danel
[4725.76s] Midland let&#39;s take a
[4727.76s] look do like exposure in
[4731.239s] a
[4732.84s] uh probably not yet but let&#39;s take a
[4737.84s] look I mean long term you&#39;re fine but I
[4740.48s] think they&#39;re probably better ENT entry
[4749.12s] points revenues are down a bit
[4766.92s] shrink this a little bit yeah there we
[4774.48s] go free cash flows cut in half since
[4780.8s] 2021 let&#39;s
[4783.8s] see yeah I think it&#39;s okay I just think
[4786.28s] it&#39;s a not yet story it&#39;s close story
[4789.92s] but not yet
[4791.44s] story um
[4799.52s] and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s uh 20 bucks
[4802.8s] away or 10 bucks or five bucks I it&#39;s
[4805.679s] just not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a fat pitch
[4810.08s] down the middle for me yet
[4812.719s] uh
[4814.719s] Sagar kanak
[4817.44s] kanakia hi Tom hope you&#39;re well was just
[4819.56s] listening to Boeing earnings call CFO
[4821.44s] mentioned specifically DSS division
[4823.36s] expect margins to be negative
[4825.239s] fix Parts development programs I
[4826.8s] understand building has a huge lack
[4828.639s] backlock uh strike will
[4830.96s] cause sufficient company profitability
[4833.239s] once turns to ship this thing is going
[4834.8s] to Mint cash once the stri the the
[4837.719s] workers come back on it take a few
[4839.76s] months to get back on to full production
[4842.44s] but there&#39;s nothing to really think
[4843.719s] about here in my view uh Paul
[4847.199s] girz hey Tom hope as well rereading some
[4850.04s] of Buffett&#39;s letters wanted to share a
[4851.36s] quote from the 1987 Le letter that&#39;s
[4853.719s] relative to Alibaba quote the speed at
[4856.28s] which a business&#39;s success is recognized
[4858.639s] furthermore is not that important as
[4860.8s] long as the company&#39;s intrinsic value is
[4862.88s] increasing at a satisfactory rate in
[4865.88s] fact delayed recognition can be an
[4867.679s] advantage it may give us the chance to
[4869.92s] buy more of a good thing at a bargain
[4871.84s] price that has certainly been the case
[4873.639s] with Alibaba and now with Boeing uh so
[4876.88s] we&#39;re pretty excited about that he says
[4878.32s] you preached this concept countless
[4879.84s] times but I figured it would be a great
[4881.12s] reminder for us listeners as Alibaba
[4882.84s] takes a breather smart listeners have
[4884.679s] been and will continue to take advantage
[4887.28s] thanks again for all you&#39;ve taught us
[4888.56s] Paul gir well thank you Paul that was a
[4890.56s] very nice thing to
[4892.719s] share
[4903.36s] uh ET Naman asks can you look at
[4911.28s] Theo
[4913.0s] see V a l e
[4923.76s] o
[4939.04s] e all right so this company does uh
[4945.88s] powertrain lighting driver assistance
[4947.92s] thermal cameras lar radar I mean lar
[4950.4s] companies are a train wreck I really
[4951.76s] would not do that um but let me just see
[4954.84s] the company&#39;s financials real
[4958.639s] quick
[4962.56s] um I mean right now the only people that
[4964.96s] sell EV cars effectively is Tesla and
[4968.6s] they don&#39;t use lar they probably should
[4970.88s] but they don&#39;t
[4972.96s] um Leo
[4997.48s] let me see
[4999.92s] this sell systems for automakers in
[5005.44s] assistance powert train systems thermal
[5007.12s] system okay so it&#39;s an auto part
[5010.08s] supplier parking and driving assistance
[5013.0s] uh Radars connectivity
[5015.679s] shortterm
[5017.679s] flywheels fuel consumption enhanced
[5019.96s] driving
[5021.0s] Comfort uh I think that I think this is
[5023.44s] a this is just a Cooper standard Story
[5025.56s] part two volumes are the name of the
[5027.199s] game probably less operating leverage
[5028.8s] than Cooper standard but uh maybe a
[5031.48s] little healthier let&#39;s take a look here
[5039.6s] it&#39;s interesting though their revenues
[5040.88s] have been flat since
[5043.239s] 2017 so they didn&#39;t really have that big
[5046.0s] dip and Rise so you&#39;re not going
[5049.04s] to let see
[5053.04s] here Ro I is mid single digits it&#39;s
[5057.4s] not been uh that great of a business but
[5061.96s] let&#39;s take a look
[5064.679s] what&#39;s the book cash
[5072.239s] flow yeah I I mean I think this one
[5075.12s] might
[5076.32s] be beaten down because you know it&#39;s
[5080.36s] French number one and number two uh all
[5084.119s] these Auto Part suppliers have all
[5085.8s] gotten hit just the basket I think this
[5088.52s] one&#39;s worth doing some work on um so
[5092.6s] good work good find uh but not without
[5095.199s] risk so now you got to do the real work
[5097.0s] and get on you know dozen or so
[5100.119s] conference calls look at the that&#39;s
[5102.4s] presentation establish a short thesis as
[5104.8s] to why are people short and getting out
[5107.159s] and then what is your Edge to why you
[5109.199s] should be getting in when everyone else
[5110.52s] is getting out Vincent sent more uh hey
[5114.6s] Tom I know you already own Cooper
[5116.76s] standard curious to hear your thoughts
[5117.96s] on aptive probably the same
[5120.8s] thing a
[5140.96s] TV yeah margin starting to re accelerate
[5144.159s] it a PB
[5155.44s] yeah I think that this one also warrants
[5158.119s] some work
[5166.52s] uh electrical safety technology solution
[5169.719s] commercial miricle markets signal and
[5172.199s] Power
[5174.56s] Solutions engineer component products
[5177.239s] yeah look these are all going to work
[5178.44s] when Cooper works I just think that the
[5180.36s] the operating leverage per unit of
[5182.679s] dollar at risk is is greatest with that
[5185.48s] one but uh I think that you know you
[5187.92s] could you could have a basket of it too
[5190.4s] Muhammad OT taibi appreciate the podcast
[5193.88s] I appreciate you listening uh can you
[5195.96s] please tell me your daily routine how
[5197.679s] you get
[5199.04s] productive uh also opinion on accidental
[5203.159s] looks good for the next five years so I
[5205.719s] don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a question or an
[5206.96s] assertion that you think it looks good
[5208.44s] for 5 years
[5210.96s] um uh first off thank you for listening
[5215.56s] and my daily routine
[5218.8s] um depends on the day yeah I think
[5222.239s] they&#39;re better things to do than oxy but
[5224.239s] um people get faked out because they
[5226.159s] think Buffett&#39;s buying so much but he&#39;s
[5227.84s] actually B exercising a ton of warrants
[5230.6s] he got for debt financing when they did
[5232.36s] a big deal in 2019 he got all these
[5234.8s] warrants they were completely worthless
[5236.88s] in 2020 and and then once they got back
[5240.04s] in the money he&#39;s been exercising it for
[5242.0s] stock before they expire so um so don&#39;t
[5246.04s] mistake that to Natural buying near the
[5248.32s] highs uh it&#39;s a completely different
[5250.48s] story he has a lower basis so um daily
[5255.159s] routine I read I mean the first two
[5256.96s] hours of every day I basically read um
[5261.239s] then I go through all of our
[5263.48s] portfolio uh then I look for opportunity
[5266.44s] I mean it it really just depends on the
[5267.92s] day I exercise do push-ups do crunches
[5271.52s] uh walk on the
[5272.84s] treadmill watch CNBC and Fox Business
[5279.84s] um and work my ass off that&#39;s what I
[5282.6s] like to do
[5284.8s] so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have to think
[5287.48s] about getting productive I am
[5288.56s] immediately productive uh you know old
[5291.719s] Basics write down a to-do list the night
[5293.719s] before check it off during the day uh
[5296.76s] read read read most important thing is
[5298.48s] reading and learning and um there you go
[5303.119s] that is for
[5307.0s] [Music]
[5309.48s] uh that is for a client uh that came in
[5313.679s] late okay well we&#39;re closed out for this
[5316.44s] quarter um first thanks for a very good
[5319.679s] podcast what are your thoughts on super
[5321.119s] micro
[5322.719s] computer uh not interested but I&#39;ll just
[5325.4s] take a quick look for
[5328.239s] you okay so it went up 100x and now it&#39;s
[5332.28s] falling 60% so everyone&#39;s excited to buy
[5335.199s] it up only
[5337.159s] 40x uh this is not for
[5340.32s] me I don&#39;t care if they make cancer
[5343.08s] cures I&#39;m not
[5347.239s] interested I think we covered this one
[5349.28s] last week anyway but thank you for the
[5350.679s] question Anders uh and welcome to the
[5352.6s] podcast I can tell you&#39;re probably
[5354.6s] newer um and uh we&#39;re grateful to have
[5357.44s] you on board and hope you learn some
[5359.84s] stuff over the next couple of years Kyle
[5362.76s] Burns can you take a look at DNA and let
[5364.6s] me know if you&#39;d considered it
[5365.56s] undervalued with enough margin of safety
[5367.6s] I look at it every two weeks and I
[5369.28s] continue to say no I mean you&#39;re betting
[5372.44s] on it should work like fiser should work
[5376.44s] but you&#39;re betting on them coming up
[5378.159s] with like a cancer vaccine which if they
[5379.84s] do it&#39;ll be aund bagger and if it and if
[5382.4s] they don&#39;t it&#39;ll just languish there so
[5386.36s] um I can&#39;t I&#39;m not in the predict
[5389.04s] predicting Market uh we still have a big
[5391.88s] position in biotech as a basket which
[5394.04s] which we believe is going to continue to
[5395.44s] benefit from lower and lower rates over
[5396.96s] the next two years and go parabolic uh
[5399.8s] and we&#39;re happy to participate that way
[5401.6s] in a basket but guessing what things are
[5404.239s] going to get approved or not approved or
[5406.0s] thinking we have a a scientific Edge and
[5408.56s] gambling on it uh absolutely uh hard
[5413.719s] pass okay that&#39;s
[5420.52s] another Philipe Andrew Pinko says do you
[5423.32s] have any book Rec mination for
[5424.84s] recommendations for better understanding
[5426.159s] free cash flow and solvency analysis
[5427.76s] especially in the context of turnaround
[5429.119s] situations love to die deeper bu
[5431.88s] confidence up blah blah blah keep
[5433.719s] advocating your podcast among my circle
[5436.44s] thanks for sharing all right so first
[5438.28s] off thank you for sharing it with your
[5439.96s] friends and your Social Circle if you&#39;re
[5441.6s] getting value from this the number one
[5443.32s] compliment you could pay is share it
[5444.639s] with one or two people you know and love
[5446.719s] who love markets and would benefit from
[5448.84s] this information the more people you
[5451.239s] share it with the longer I&#39;m going to do
[5452.719s] it for free for non-client
[5455.04s] and um happy to continue to do that
[5458.239s] because of people like you Philip uh
[5461.239s] start with security analysis uh by
[5463.56s] Benjamin Graham and then the intelligent
[5465.639s] investor by Benjamin Graham and then
[5468.119s] read the CFA books if you haven&#39;t done
[5470.0s] that yet and uh that&#39;ll be a good
[5472.6s] starting point and then you need you
[5474.119s] know a decade or two of experience also
[5476.52s] helps Kate howls
[5491.239s] no okay TI
[5507.0s] Tom rates continue on the decline and
[5510.0s] business cycle broadly ticks up as
[5511.76s] expected will reach
[5514.04s] as a segment reversed or downward long
[5515.96s] course or at least stabilized oh they&#39;ve
[5517.48s] already stabilized if you&#39;re in the
[5518.679s] right ones I mean we bought crown castle
[5521.88s] in the 90s and it&#39;s up you know got up
[5523.8s] to like 115 120 now I think it&#39;s 110
[5527.4s] that&#39;s just getting started that&#39;s
[5528.639s] another one we got into right before
[5530.239s] Paul singer got into it at Elliott with
[5532.679s] his activist
[5534.52s] campaign
[5535.56s] [Music]
[5539.56s] um yeah the ones you pose here are lower
[5543.32s] quality reach so I wouldn&#39;t be in those
[5545.92s] we we went with the high quality we did
[5547.36s] verado when no one wanted it we made a
[5549.159s] quick double we got out it&#39;s it&#39;s
[5551.679s] continue to be fine I think that will
[5553.4s] continue to work uh we&#39;re just playing
[5555.88s] it through crown castle we don&#39;t need to
[5557.96s] dig down deep because you&#39;re never going
[5559.639s] to you know when you look at cim I think
[5562.48s] that&#39;s Chimera you&#39;re never going to
[5564.8s] understand what&#39;s in the portfolios of
[5566.32s] these tiny little companies with
[5567.84s] mortgage back
[5569.119s] Securities
[5571.32s] um it&#39;s funny we were talking about this
[5573.88s] at dinner the other night with the fox
[5576.239s] boys uh what&#39;s
[5579.56s] n
[5581.76s] n NL is the best one in terms of
[5584.88s] mortgage back Securities they&#39;ve already
[5587.36s] recovered um I really don&#39;t want to mess
[5590.119s] with the WPC mpw and cim they might work
[5593.0s] as trades but like you&#39;re just kind of
[5595.679s] gambling and
[5596.64s] [Music]
[5599.6s] winning oh WP carry all right I&#39;ll take
[5602.36s] a look at that one for you I think
[5604.28s] that&#39;s uh that&#39;s a higher quality
[5609.0s] one
[5610.76s] PC I knew Chimera back in the day they
[5614.239s] had really good management I don&#39;t know
[5615.48s] if it&#39;s still the
[5616.88s] same uh net leas
[5619.36s] properties Self
[5627.4s] Storage all right
[5630.08s] financial analysis
[5643.92s] balance
[5658.0s] sheet cash flow
[5670.0s] and
[5677.119s] snapshots 5.8% I mean w up carry is
[5680.639s] probably
[5682.28s] okay
[5687.04s] um mpw what&#39;s that
[5693.84s] a medical properties
[5700.239s] trust you got to be careful with those I
[5702.719s] mean you&#39;re you&#39;re guessing and you&#39;ll
[5704.119s] probably be right I mean that&#39;s takes a
[5706.679s] huge amount of work to get confidence in
[5708.44s] that I I just look Reit had their big
[5713.6s] decline whatever it was when we were
[5715.92s] talking about verado okay that&#39;s when we
[5718.32s] were buyers and what we like to do is
[5721.679s] get huge sector
[5724.199s] locations and then buy the highest
[5727.44s] quality companies in those so in 2020
[5731.36s] when energy was trading negative we
[5733.239s] weren&#39;t buying corizo oil and gas we
[5736.04s] were buying Exxon Mobile in the 20s we
[5738.76s] were buying uh the the best companies
[5743.0s] Chevron uh uh ocidental that type of
[5746.04s] stuff in the 20s forado buying in the
[5748.4s] hole I mean I remember you guys like we
[5752.56s] anyway buying in 18 buying again at 12
[5756.44s] uh and then it just shot from 15 to 30
[5759.4s] overnight and took a double and sure
[5761.679s] enough it keeps going but you know
[5764.84s] it&#39;s you got to book some gains every
[5767.08s] now and then and we had to take a gain
[5769.239s] so same thing with Boston properties
[5771.159s] that&#39;s what you want to buy you buy the
[5772.6s] highest quality when it&#39;s when the whole
[5775.4s] sector is in the hole that&#39;s how you
[5776.679s] make money China in the hole what did we
[5778.48s] do we bought the highest quality thing
[5780.92s] so X on mobile in the 20s okay and the
[5784.239s] thing just completely doubled and it
[5785.88s] continued to go up so anyway uh I don&#39;t
[5789.48s] like to dig down second and third tier
[5792.239s] unless it&#39;s a really special situation
[5794.08s] like Cooper standard I just wait for
[5796.52s] super fat pitches the whole thing got
[5799.119s] shellacked like China and then just buy
[5801.04s] the highest quality where you have say
[5803.119s] if this sector is going to remain alive
[5805.04s] this will be the winner and you you then
[5808.119s] you can lean into it you can&#39;t lean into
[5810.639s] like what&#39;s the point of having a 100
[5812.36s] position 1% position
[5814.84s] uh and you know half of them don&#39;t work
[5817.36s] and then the other half make five like
[5819.4s] just get the best quality so you can put
[5822.199s] some size into eight or 10 12 companies
[5825.0s] and sleep well at night like Disney like
[5827.239s] Boeing like in I don&#39;t have to stay up
[5830.28s] at night thinking about these companies
[5832.119s] it&#39;s just a Time Arbitrage some are
[5834.159s] going to double and triple in a year or
[5835.56s] two some are going to take three to five
[5837.56s] years and overbalance on average over
[5840.28s] the portfolio it takes them three years
[5842.44s] and we just rinse and repeat over and
[5844.04s] over and over and we get a kicker with
[5846.56s] our option expression derivative
[5849.119s] overlays and um you know it just works
[5852.88s] and that&#39;s why you saw all these
[5855.119s] beautiful people that I acknowledged at
[5857.0s] the beginning of the call uh want to be
[5858.88s] a part of it and we&#39;re very grateful and
[5860.92s] we will continue to work Non-Stop and be
[5863.44s] productive every day on their behalf and
[5866.36s] uh so on all right so here&#39;s a guy who&#39;s
[5869.28s] got the Cooper standard of China again
[5873.56s] don&#39;t want to deal with these lowquality
[5874.92s] companies in China because half of them
[5876.639s] are you know wind up having crap
[5879.239s] numbers and um I&#39;m just not going to
[5882.0s] take country and Company risk this is
[5884.52s] this is a train wreck forget it um I&#39;m
[5887.199s] sure the numbers look good I just don&#39;t
[5888.92s] know if the numbers are correct uh let&#39;s
[5891.96s] just see
[5893.56s] here that is new client
[5906.84s] uh okay last question Roy nkuzi love the
[5910.679s] podcast thoughts on the US coal Market
[5912.52s] specifically ticker
[5916.76s] AMR coal
[5927.48s] market so it&#39;s
[5931.92s] up 200% % since
[5936.199s] 2020 and because it&#39;s pulled back
[5940.159s] to
[5941.92s] 100% we are now excuse me
[5947.84s] 200x yeah it&#39;s up 200x since 2020 and
[5951.599s] now it&#39;s pulled back to 100x and we&#39;re
[5953.639s] going to look at it okay I will
[5956.88s] entertain that let&#39;s take a look
[5977.239s] AMR all right so cash flow is coming
[5980.44s] down after peaking revenues are coming
[5982.48s] down margins are coming down and the
[5984.56s] Stock&#39;s up 100x uh for me it&#39;s a hard
[5987.4s] pass I&#39;ll stick with my natural gas Comm
[5990.719s] stock resources hopefully I&#39;ll run into
[5994.52s] my quote unquote
[5996.04s] partner Jerry Jones in early November
[5998.56s] when I&#39;m at the Cowboys game so uh and
[6001.599s] uh shake his hand that would be fun if I
[6004.119s] come back with a Jerry Jones picture for
[6005.719s] the podcast that would that would be
[6007.119s] something else anyway with that said I
[6008.96s] want to thank everyone for tuning in so
