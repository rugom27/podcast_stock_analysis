welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 262nd podcast video cast for the week ending October 24th 2024 family first then we&#39;ll get down to business uh thanks for joining us this is Mimi with Maggie stefins training over in California Annabelle is number one for her age in the nation oh excuse me that&#39;s Annabelle uh and that&#39;s Mimi Annabel&#39;s number one for her age in the nation for backstroke again for the fourth year in a row and Mimi is crushing it in water polo and is loving training with USA Women&#39;s Water Polo Olympic Captain Maggie stefin so really proud of both of them and uh this was Annabelle&#39;s results came in number one for 100 back this past weekend ah and there are my new Vans ladies and gentlemen uh VF Corp here we go uh these are super cool they&#39;re the same ones as the old ones I had in white and green now these are in all green I I think they put out cool stuff but what do I know uh moving along so that&#39;s the existing ones those are the new ones for those of you who are new to the podcast uh this is related to a holding we have called VF Corp with Brack and Daryl which is a turnaround uh they call me turnaround Tom for the new folks out there uh and he&#39;s turning that company around just like he did with Logitech which was a six bagger after he came in after the stock was down 82% same thing came in with the stock down more than 80% starting to turn it around already ran up to $20 consolidating and will move higher over time this is uh dinner with my buddies from Fox that&#39;s Kenny pocari you all know Michael Lee of course he grew up in the same town that we have our house in Connecticut there&#39;s Mark teer you see every morning on mornings with Maria and vanney as well and I call him AJ Adam Johnson we had a great time at uh catch sake which uh I know from as the maritime Hotel back in the day but uh but they&#39;ve changed over and it was delicious um other than the fact they had no anchovies inside joke then I got to go to the Al Smith dinner last week which was absolutely so much fun ran into so many people and uh just an incredible time that was Donald Trump telling jokes the other candidate uh was a no-show which uh is the first time in 40 years I think both candidates haven&#39;t show shown up so uh not an ideal situation but uh turned out to be a great night those are some photos there and I don&#39;t know exactly what happened but uh maybe because I&#39;ve been to a number of them before that was with Cardinal Ean I got my picture up there I don&#39;t know where the pictures are they took pictures I don&#39;t know where they posted them I haven&#39;t really Googled for them yet but um uh that that was a just a phenomenal time so I got to sit next to um uh Mary Higgins Clark granddaughter was at my table and her partner we had a really fun time and her father and uh got to meet um Paul singer from Elliot management he was at the table right next to me and uh the uh Vice chair of Alibaba by the way uh Mike Evans president of global uh so had had a few nice words with him uh and uh pitch Paul singer on Intel so we&#39;ll see what happens if he shows up look in in a handful of the uh uh positions we&#39;ve put on whether it was crown castle Etc we seem to put them on and the activists seem to come invariably uh you know one or two months later so uh so maybe we&#39;ll uh we&#39;ll get a partner in Intel it&#39;s certainly makes a lot of sense from my point of view uh then we had that&#39;s a little premature there we had uh uh was on vanney and Company yesterday want to thank Preston misel Christian dagger and Stu Varney for having me on we discussed before after Boeing earnings and before the vote what to do if they voted for the union package what to do if they voted against the union package package and we did exactly what we advised um after the fact and uh also talked about the uh potential areas that will benefit if uh the polls are right and uh Trump becomes the next president and I don&#39;t say that with any partisanship I say that with uh betting odds which we&#39;re going to talk about and some of the internal polling data that I have access to uh and other things that uh that I have information on that seem to be pointing towards for sure the executive uh and in some instances pointing to a sweep which uh would be less good for equities believe it or not so uh we&#39;re hoping for a split government which would uh probably mean a republican executive Republican Senate and Democratic house I think that&#39;s a good scenario for the markets uh obviously Anything could happen but we just need to deal objectively with how we can make money from it and leave the uh emotionalism and uh idealism to the polit political pundants and uh people who care about that stuff we&#39;re on this podcast and you&#39;re on this podcast to make money not to make uh uh political viewpoints so with that said let&#39;s get back to money here we go is we&#39;re going to open the market in about 12 13 minutes some red ink today down 250 on the Dow down 94 on the NASDAQ Tom hay is back with us this morning rising interest rates that&#39;s what&#39;s hurting the market tell me why why are rates Rising like they are well I think the treasury market is starting to price in progrowth Pro bus policies and that implies that maybe the FED won&#39;t have to cut quite as much progrowth Pro business policies you bet that&#39;s a trump presidency that&#39;s a trump presidency for sure and the treasury market is reacting to that you&#39;re 424 on the tenure now yeah no question about it uh there&#39;s another Factor so other people would say the Skeptics would say oh there&#39;s going to be deficit spending but actually during the last Trump Administration the 10-year yield was between 1.30 and 3.20 so that that old dog don&#39;t hunt as far as that argument goes the other thing to keep in mind is seasonally over the last 10 years October happens to be the worst month of the year for bonds November is the best month of the year for bonds so you want to sell the rumor buy the news after the election you want to be buying bonds if you think Trump&#39;s going to win the election what should you be buying on the stock market right now well this is a controversial one uh first off Boeing okay they just reported they missed earnings this morning this was a kitchen sync quarter for the new CEO he came from Rockwell Collins under his tenure the stock over a decade went up 4X this guy&#39;s going to turn around the company they have the union vote today here&#39;s my suggestion if the union votes against the pay package I.E the strike continues wait till to drops 5% buy some Boeing stock if they vote Yes the Stock&#39;s going to go up buy some stock Industrials are going to do well defense spending is going to do well well this is a stock that did exceptionally well so Industrials small caps did exceptionally well under Trump uh Emerging Markets did exceptionally well consumer discretionary did ex exceptionally well I&#39;ll tell you what didn&#39;t do well that everyone thinks is the Trump trade is energy stocks energy stocks did not do well under Trump because there was a lot of Supply prices were low margins were less for energy companies that&#39;s fascinating good stuff Tom Hayes thanks for joining us we&#39;ll see you again soon thanks for all right the camp and we&#39;re back on to the next and then this morning I was in lovely Connecticut and uh you know at like 11:20 uh a.m. I got an email can you be on at 12 so after a very quick shave and a uh very quick put the suit on and very quick put my uh uh studio uh in in order I was happy to do so and I got a chance to talk about the um the uh the the Boeing vote and the union and the implications and Tesla and a whole lot more so we&#39;re going to listen uh first off I want to thank Jenna Jenna damasus uh for thinking of me and having me on the show Dad so again this taale of Two Worlds we want to pursue this a little bit more we got trah heider here of Zen media the CEO there uh Thomas Hay&#39;s back with us the chairman of managing partner great Hill capital thas on Boeing if you&#39;ll indulge me a little bit on this that this idea that workers reject a 35% pay hike now the devil&#39;s in the details I&#39;m not aware of all the details that&#39;s a big pay hike to turn down I&#39;m I&#39;m just wondering if you&#39;re a corporate boss anywhere else let&#39;s say of a large Union Workforce does that get you nervous yeah Neil I think the IMA the union for Boeing workers may be overplaying their hand here uh so far they&#39;re they&#39;re paying the workers $250 a week to strike these are six figure jobs they&#39;ve already gone grew about $41 million they only have $300 million total and Boeing workers are only 6% of the Union so basically you&#39;ve seen a situation where they&#39;ve eroded 133% of the Union&#39;s assets 530,000 members in just a handful of weeks within 31.5 weeks they will be down to0 of assets they started at 300 they&#39;re down to 260 Boeing on the other hand can tap the public markets anytime they want and raise 10 billion 20 billion and wait this thing out for 10 months 20 months if need be and I think from an investor standpoint Neil we just have to step back they&#39;ve got a half a trillion dollar backlog over the next 10 years they they&#39;ve got to deliver uh thousands of planes 6200 plane backlogs so Boeing&#39;s going to be just fine look we were in the market adding to our position like crazy this morning we did think 35% was extremely generous uh Boeing started at 25% the union wanted 40% Boeing came up to 35% they&#39;re rejecting I think some of these workers are going to find themselves as part of the next 177,000 worker cut that Boeing recently announced they had to do and they may be overplaying they&#39;re they&#39;re looking for a 40% raise but they may get 100% pay reduction yeah we forget about that 10% of the workforce 17,000 you&#39;re Point who are going to lose their jobs and more uh could happen after this we&#39;ll see how that plays out uh Shaman now back to the the better story of the day and that is Tesla uh the stock is soaring about 20% it surprised a lot of folks on the upside and put the Magnificent back in the Magnificent 7 I guess but not all of them are going along for the ride what do you make of the significance of what Tesla reported I&#39;m thrilled Neil and I will tell you I&#39;m am bullish uh on both Boeing and Tesla going through very different challenges but you know they&#39;ve got very interesting leaders at the helm so I look at that and one of my fun hacks is actually look at LinkedIn and see what employees are saying and you can really see the energy in Tesla employees you know they shipped their 7 millionth uh vehicle recently and so I think it&#39;s to be expected I do not bet against um Elon Musk I think he knows what he&#39;s doing and you can just see how excited the people are and so much of this does come down to people and and Vibes you know if I me a lot musk I&#39;m excited too because I I I I&#39;m I&#39;m the world&#39;s richest human being I I&#39;d be happy in dancing on stages myself but leaving that aside uh you know Thomas I&#39;m curious about uh Tesla what is remarkable here is that the government guarantees and checks you get to buy an EV they&#39;ve shrunk considerably and so a lot of those Tesla sales are what they call naked sales in other words without any benefits or or any you know uh government incentives here what do you make of that well speaking of naked Neil uh the naked short sellers got hammered this morning that&#39;s for sure in the Tesla stock so you never want to bet against Elon Musk I think look I think that&#39;s the idea of a government subsidy they want to promote a specific ideology a specific method a specific technology so they have to subsidize it because it&#39;s uneconomic in the nent years and now that it&#39;s gain gaining mainstream adoption it&#39;s it is getting a leg of its its own you don&#39;t see it across all the car manufacturers you know I&#39;ve always been skeptical I&#39;ve said I&#39;m not sure people want EVS but I do think they want Teslas there&#39;s something special about Tesla when it comes to EVs and I think that&#39;s going to continue as he rolls out refreshed models uh more affordable models for the masses I think uh I think he&#39;s got legs um let me pursue that with you sham and what it might say about technology because one thing that&#39;s been you know beneath the surfaces we used to have those seven tech stocks I I&#39;ll throw Tesla into that camp it&#39;s more than an automaker um and and all the others in the S&amp;P 500 now it&#39;s the S&amp;P 493 that are doing quite well um as are the the tech stock so how do you play that going forward yeah you know I think listen and I apologize for anyone who gets this song stuck in their head but it&#39;s like you know the grease is a word it&#39;s a feeling that&#39;s that&#39;s AI right that&#39;s automation that song&#39;s been playing in my head all day but that&#39;s really what we&#39;re seeing and so I&#39;m really bullish I mean I&#39;m bullish on uh you know we haven&#39;t even seen this but but meta and uh you know just look at look at all the things that it takes to power that AI right so you&#39;re talking semiconductors you&#39;re talking supply chain you&#39;re talking manufacturing I&#39;m very excited I think this year ends really on a high note you know sha I&#39;m old enough to remember that song There&#39;s no way in heck that you can be uh or Tom that guy in the box next year but we&#39;ll see because uh you know Greece and just buying Tech is the word um guys thank you both very much do appreciate it again we&#39;ll follow this sort of disperate Direction on these two key stocks but I thought we&#39;d zero in on these folks because maybe that is emblematic of this Market they&#39;re the gainers and they&#39;re the losers uh Robert kosaki says uh the stocks themselves are getting a little pricey at these levels here as well as Neil Cavuto so here we go and we&#39;re back and then finally on Sunday night I got to be on bloom Bloomberg Radio Bloomberg uh Asia with Doug Kisner again thanks to Doug and Juan Torres for having me on here we talked a lot about different implications of the election but more than that we got to talk about Asia China and Alibaba here we go us now is Thomas Hayes he is the chairman at Great Hill Capital joining us from here in New York City Tom thanks for making time to chat with us you and I were talking a little while ago about the fact that there seems to be powerful me momentum right now happening for the US Equity Market I think the S&amp;P 500 closed Friday at yet another record we have seen six straight weeks of gains is this a little concerning to you a little bit particularly because of the seasonality dug so this is the seventh time in the last decade the S&amp;P has been up six weeks in a row and it&#39;s basically a coin flip based on history whether we get a a seventh up week this week about 5050 so we&#39;ll see what happens but I think what you&#39;re seeing here Doug is a combination of complacency plus liquidity uh most Central Bank Cuts in the month of September that we&#39;ve seen since 2020 and prior to that 2009 and then you couple that with if you look at betting odds if if you place any weight on betting odds potentially uh the market may be pricing in a a shift to slightly more Pro bus policy whether premature or not it seems to be telling the story particularly when the Market&#39;s going up and uh earnings came in a little bit lighter than expected so far so stocks are up yields are down by and large and we had rapael bask saying at the end of last week he&#39;s not in a rush to lower interest rates do you think the FED may be a little concerned here put aside for the moment the labor market put aside for a moment this decline that we have seen in the rate of inflation is the Fed perhaps a little concerned about easy financial conditions well you know they have shifted to a dual-sided risk and the labor market uh as low as the unemployment rate is it is showing some signs of weakness now are we guaranteed getting six consecutive Cuts in a row the Market&#39;s been a little bit too optimistic so I&#39;m not sure if November is a foregone conclusion I think the Market&#39;s pricing in 225 uh basis point Cuts but maybe we only get one I think that&#39;s perfectly fine given the current conditions um you know the other thing that I&#39;ve really had my eye on Doug is last month we got a record move out of bonds a two standard deviation move out of bonds and you got to look back all the way to 2001 to 2003 to see that level of move and and uh if you remember and I think you&#39;ve been you were around back then Doug uh you you had uh a a an unprecedented rally following that in small caps versus large caps in value versus growth and in Emerging Markets versus developed markets three trades that very few people are uh confidently positioned for right now I want to change gears talk a little bit about the other side of the world the Asia Pacific and the week ahead markets in Asia are gearing up for what is likely to be the busiest week of new listings in more than 2 years particularly it&#39;s China it&#39;s India it&#39;s Japan what does it say to you that uh developing markets um are in the process of raising a lot more Capital yeah the game is back on Animal Spirits are coming in the Chinese government has flipped on the dime uh yes uh investors want more yes investors are skeptical after a two-year Beatdown and yes they are going to get more because why because you can&#39;t be half pregant they&#39;ve already turned the corner they are going full bore they will do more and then they will do more and then they will do more and the Chinese government the game is back on we&#39;re going to see more fiscal stimulus uh coupled with the monetary stimulus coupled with back stopping the property market and when that happens massive flows and I think uh you mentioned Japan there you know some of these emerging markets that have been the beneficiary of emerging market flows out of China like Japan like India that have gotten a little bit heated I think we&#39;re going to see a little bit of weakness in those markets as money slowly and more confidently over time moves back into China particularly the most high quality companies in China uh and uh and the IPO Market tell the Slate that you mentioned tells you everything you need to know about confidence uh recovering and starting to rebuild so are you a buyer of risk Assets in China right now yes uh our one of our largest positions is Alibaba this has been like watching paint dry has been dead money for us for a year uh we spent every red day buying more stock people looked at us like we had three heads but here&#39;s the fact Doug you can buy Alibaba today for the same price it was 10 years ago the only difference is the revenues are up, 1300% and the earnings in cash flow are up 650 so what else do you want to talk about I mean we see it as one of the greatest Price is what you pay value is what you get and in terms of the cash generated they generate 20 to 25 billion doar a year in cash they got 80 billion of cash on the balance sheet they&#39;ve got uh a piece of basically every AI startup in China they give them credits for compute power in their Cloud business in exchange for Equity I mean if you wanted to play an AI ETF in China it&#39;s called Alibaba and that&#39;s got got zero Credit in the price right now uh couple that with AI with the cloud and with the consumer coming back with the fiscal stimulus it&#39;s the toll it&#39;s the Tollgate for China so uh we like that position and we love the valuation at high single digits down from historic multiples of 20 25 times and they&#39;ll come back over time let&#39;s talk about the US presidential election we&#39;re a little more than two weeks away from November 5th obviously it&#39;s a critical day or will be uh how are you feeling about the election and what would uh Trump presidency mean versus uh Harris presidency for the business environment in the US yeah it seems like the market is starting to price in slightly more Pro business policy which implies a trump win that&#39;s evidenced in the data in the uh in some of the polling data and certainly in some of the betting data in some of the betting pools that you look at it&#39;s starting to favor a trump win I think betting on the basis of who&#39;s elected is a Fool&#39;s errand if you recall um when Trump got elected everyone said China stocks were going to do horribly from 2016 to 2018 China stocks did better than they&#39;ve done in years uh and then when Biden was in they thought China was going to do great it did horribly the worst it&#39;s done in a decade uh furthermore everyone said when Trump would get elected energy stocks would go to the Moon uh the exact opposite happened when you have more drilling the price goes down and the stocks went down with it a lot of Supply uh was not good for energy stocks under Trump so I think that what the the ideal outcome from a stock market standpoint Doug is just a split government so whether uh Trump is elected or Harris is elected in the executive branch so long as you have a different party in either the house or the Senate the market loves gridlock and empirically the market does best with a split government so that&#39;s that&#39;s what I think we want to be focused on as Market participants in the next few weeks okay so if you&#39;re reading the data properly or at least these indicators that you&#39;re looking at right now and there is a higher probability of a trump Administration do you really believe that additional tariffs are pro business well look I I&#39;ve seen some studies on uh the impact if Trump actually put forth the 60% tariffs on China the data that I&#39;ve looked at implies that that would only reduce Chinese GDP by 1% so uh we would potentially uh in the short term bear the brunt of the higher prices however uh as some of his selected potential treasury secretaries and trade negotiators in his uh formative Administration have implied that is the ask it is open to negotiation and Trump has said as much we just want to do a deal so he&#39;ll hit them hard bring them back to the table and try to get a pragmatic outcome as we saw in the early part of the administration from prior to covid uh that he did have some success in doing that and the subsequent Administration actually followed through and kept the tariffs he put in place uh active during the uh during the Biden Administration so I think it&#39;s more of a let&#39;s get to the table but uh first I&#39;m going to bop you and then I&#39;m going to you know hand you an ice pack to help uh uh heal together and make something that works for both parties and I think we&#39;ll see a pragmatic uh move after the initial shock Factor all right we&#39;ll leave it there Tom thank you so much Thomas Hayes is Chairman at Great Hill Capital joining us here on the Daybreak Asia podcast thank you Doug Thomas thank you and we&#39;re back and then finally want to thank chabuk U and Amanda for including me in their article on the markets and the Trump trade and what will work if in fact the polls are correct

uh to watch the Cowboys game in early November in their box so very excited for that um uh which reminds me of opinion not advice as always uh we don&#39;t know your financial situation we deal exclusively with accredited investors and qualified institutions so talk to your financial adviser before doing anything go to hedge fund tips.com click on trades opinion not advice here we go the current high level of Market concentration suggests the equal weight S&amp;P will outperform the aggregate index by an annualized 8 percentage points over the next decade what does that imply well if the heaviest weights and the heaviest earnings in the rearview mirror have been the mag 7 and these Cycles are correct which we believe they are and by the way this points to exactly what again 2001 2002 to 2007 same exact situation uh where what outperforms small caps Emerging Markets Industrials financials value over growth and uh so on and that&#39;s where we want to uh be and that&#39;s where we are and that&#39;s where we&#39;re positioned and we had a fun day in the market buying Boeing this morning buying some uh reloading on the long-dated Baba options we never touched a single share and we didn&#39;t add shares because our basis is so much lower because of all the uh beautiful opportunities that XI jingping gave us over the last 12 months uh so we don&#39;t buy up but we were able to reload on all the options that we took off at huge profits um uh uh on the initial Spike and this is the scenario notice no one is talking about David teer they were all talking about David terer when they were tripping over themselves to buy Alibaba at 118 now at 95 96 97 98 no one wants it everyone forgets he said God willing we get a pullback I&#39;m going to load up again and break my position limits again uh because they&#39;ll do more and do more and do more which I reiterated on Doug Kisner uh uh show on Bloomberg this over the weekend so there it is this is probably the most important chart you can understand for the next 7 to nine years this will be our Guiding Light for that period and we are positioned to take advantage Uh current a aggregate valuation metrics you see the S&amp;P 500 22 times where is value energy some energy 13 times financials 16 uh uh communication Services then health care there&#39;s some opportunities and so on uh there we go another chart that&#39;s telling us the same thing equal weight outperform which means mag 7 should underperform which has been the case since the summer when we took off our Amazon and most of our uh all of our Google uh Etc so there may be opportunities to reload on some of those um but uh there there have been plenty of other things to do uh earnings actually coming down in the last week so we&#39;re keeping an eye on this what does that imply with the heaviest weights being mag 7 that&#39;s a reasonable amount coming out of Mag 7 it may be a temporary slowdown but you have to keep an eye on this if you&#39;re index overweighted and not buying discret companies you&#39;re going to get hit the worst and the opportunity to make many doubles under the surface is riper than it&#39;s ever been and uh we&#39;re excited to to uh have gotten everyone to take advantage of of some of the things that have happened the last few days and uh may happen in the coming few days before the election and um we&#39;ll be very excited for that it&#39;s like you know it&#39;s basically like everyone who came in in Fall of 2022 and then March of 2023 I mean it was just uh Christmas time and uh and I think the same exact thing is happening right now and you&#39;re seeing it in your accounts with the work that we&#39;re doing on a daily basis to get you guys well positioned and it&#39;s it&#39;s super exciting and it&#39;s got to be super exciting for you for all the names that you see coming in that we haven&#39;t even begun to talk about yet so uh this is a S&amp;P earnings growth shows the green line remember this was negative last quarter the UNM magnificent 493 and two quarters ago this blue line which was the Magnificent 7 was at 50% now it&#39;s at Mid teens and the other one is ramping up and and next quarter Q4 is going to be the first uh coming out party for the unmagnify to hit double digit earnings growth baby we&#39;ve been talking about it and here we go so we are positioned for Sunshine uh 28 times Magnificent Seven earnings uh multiple versus 18 times equal weight that&#39;s where we find the opportunity to make Moola buyback authorizations have surged 21% year-to date I don&#39;t love that ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s the one thing I like about the Chinese that I can&#39;t stand about the American CEOs is the Chinese CEOs buy stock like crazy when their stock has been decimated and they know the intrinsic value the American CEOs buy stock when it&#39;s at all-time highs so they can dump their shares out in the market and absorb them with shareholders money I do not like that and uh and I won&#39;t participate it when I see that I&#39;ll I&#39;ll leave it to uh the retail people to be soing up that excess Supply from the CEOs dumping on their head CEO confidence has rebounded in recent quarters these are the type of things you see at recoveries at the beginning of bull cycles not at the end you can look back to uh 19 early 1990s after the recession you had CEO recovery 2001 to 2002 again over and over every single week if you guys learn that you&#39;re going to make fortunes that&#39;s just how it works 2009 same story and here we go ladies and gentlemen just coming off the mat which means more investment more excitement where do you get prices what you pay values what you get where do you get the most value for dollar well it&#39;s not the US you can see the multiples here it&#39;s not Japan uh Europe is where you start to see value emerging ma markets Big Value United Kingdom bigger value biggest value China China which by the way did better than anything else under Trump not under Biden so everyone thinking Trump with his 60% Bluster tarff s talk it&#39;s nonsense he wants to cut a deal and he will cut a deal and then he&#39;ll let China alone and uh and that&#39;s exactly what the world needs uh Mutual cooperation but no one taking advantage of of the other party and everyone wins so average small business credit card utilization rates have surpassed 2019 levels and are approaching a decade level high so that&#39;s good credit expansion forward pees you can see between Mega uh uh um uh magnificent 7 followed by that&#39;s the pink line then orange I know lot a lot of you guys love to listen to this podcast while you run or or bike or golf if you can view it you get more value by seeing the charts but if you can only listen uh maybe look at it later uh that&#39;s great too I want I want to give you guys as much value as I possibly can in hopefully the shortest amount of time possible although there&#39;s just too much to cover uh forward PE ratios this is the US value at 17.2 versus the all country World index xus is at 13.6 so there&#39;s a lot of value available around the world if you know how to seek it out and that&#39;s what we do day in and day out corporate insiders are cashing out right here you can see selling is pretty high near the 2021 uh early 2021 levels the market did rally till the end of 2021 so that&#39;s also something to keep in mind on a lagged basis corporate margin PE cor corporate margins are near all-time highs and are not yet showing signs of letting up so this is a positive thing uh unemployment rate we covered retail sales post solid gain in September showing a continued strong economy uh the beneficiaries were miscellaneous store retailers remember consumer discretionary pounding the table clothing and clothing accessories let&#39;s hope VF Corp falls into that bucket and Goose uh health and personal care Food Services in drinking places I still haven&#39;t found a restaurant yet uh got my eye on cracker bar not probably not going to do anything with that food and Beverages and what did poorly gas stations Furniture Electronics and Appliances Philadelphia fed Manufacturing Index going up uh manufacturing new orders going up remember we&#39;ve been in a Great Depression for manufacturing for Two Plus years it&#39;s starting to recover that&#39;s the next phase of the recovery um and Emerging Markets currencies outperform when global trade recovers and global trade has been recovering and it&#39;s just the beginning for emerging market currencies despite the short-term counter Trend rally in US dollar and in treasury yields we&#39;re going to talk a lot about that as we go forward on to home bu Builder sentiment starting to tick up uh China one-year Prime loan rate collapsing they continue to cut rates which is fantastic China Cuts Benchmark lending rates as easing push to boost economy continues uh China industrial production is now ticking up actually GDP came in slightly better than expected at 4.6% for the quarter industrial production absolutely skyrocketing off the mat in China industrial production you can see pimp Co says private credit is overvalued complacency spreads you think uh that&#39;s what said with uh utmost sarcasm sentiment is optimistic but not euphoric you know it&#39;s uh it is that time of year when you should get some Cho and we finally saw some this week um but I do think if the pro business PR growth policy candidate continues to pull and bet well in the betting markets um people are going to be very nervous to to sell too much stock ahead of that if it&#39;s super close is where I think you&#39;re going to see a little bit of trepidation going into the election uh and a little bit of choppiness but if it is as runaway as it appears right now which again I think is way too early to draw any conclusions but the TR friend is your friend uh you know it&#39;s going to be really hard to see these dips not get bought um so uh what did we have here okay so we had the biggest inflow followed by the biggest outflow so that&#39;s the retail people getting chopped up if you remember when Baba was at 11718 we said now they&#39;ve got to beat the stuffing out of these late Johnny come Lys who wouldn&#39;t buy it six in the 60s with us now they&#39;re they&#39;re tripping over themselves to get it at 11718 sold to you on the options we kept the stock and now in the high 90s we&#39;ve been adding back long-dated options and option spreads like it&#39;s going out of style uh and same thing Boeing I mean my fingers are you know we&#39;re busy when um my 10 key reads for Thursday gets posted on Twitter at 8:00 pm at night and I start the podcast at 8:30 so I&#39;ve been busier than a one arm paper hanger let&#39;s put it that way all right private clients bought mun dividends and utility ETFs uh just in time for yields to blow out this week so there you go uh the B and bear indicator is stretch but it&#39;s not at an extreme yet which is why we keep muddling higher uh profits matter more than politics at the end of the day the earnings growth was the key as we all know uh we&#39;ve got uh on the lowend 133% earnings growth expectations for 2025 it&#39;s between 13 to 15 has probably come down to 14 but we have not seen guidance from the major companies yet so let&#39;s uh not hold our breath let&#39;s see what happens and uh well not the Bas Cas tax cut oh yeah if the tax cut and jobs Act expires would represent the largest tax rise in history I think that&#39;s what the Market&#39;s a little bit relieved about which is why you&#39;ve seen a consistent rally throughout September and October in anticipation of uh good things happening and maybe that not expiring maybe that getting extended would be a very positive thing uh consumer sectors have fared better under Republicans so that would be uh consumer discretionary Consumer Staples uh net international migration has rebounded sharply following the end of the pandemic uh you think but actually if you go back it&#39;s kind of interesting because the last time we had this spike in net International immigration was when 20012 2002 uh which sets the stage for all the good things that we&#39;re talking about in the areas that we&#39;re positioned consumer industrial stocks sectors are the most labor intensive um consumer discretionary Industrials that would work those would do exceptionally well under the Trump trade if you remember in the Trump Administration uh the average people did a lot better than the people with assets and since uh uh the pandemic basically if you had assets I.E real estate and or equities you made a fortune and if you didn&#39;t uh you got smoked because you were forced to pay taxation material taxation without representation in the form of inflation inflation is a tax on the poor or brought to you by your government policy makers when they want to run inflation hot because they want to spend without collecting revenues and um and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s taking place so uh in the administration before the current Administration what we started to see was massive wage growth among the working class uh and people were getting ahead and uh and that would be consistent with Industrials consumer discretionary Etc uh versus only the white collar sectors of tech making all the money Financial Services Etc uh China has accelerated purchasing semi manufacturing equipment since the semi extort band in 2022 to develop its own capacity and they&#39;re succeeding so a lot of this front-loaded stuff is now going to be felt by those companies that looked to be um impenetrable and that everyone chased the shiny object so we&#39;ll see how that plays out in coming quarters estimated stimulus is just a fraction of total cap capex so we see the capex estimates moving forward this game is just beginning that&#39;s going to accelerate that&#39;s going to be helpful for earnings you also have the reshoring trend and Manufacturing depending on the uh Administration that gets in in a in a handful of uh well it&#39;s a couple handfuls of days uh 10 years of underinvestment in US manufacturing this is just getting started so you want to take advantage of companies and sectors that will benefit from a mass recovery uh that&#39;s building that&#39;s construction that&#39;s uh Industrials that&#39;s you name it you know real stuff type of companies the type of companies that boomed small businesses like crazy uh mentions of reshoring near all-time highs I mean this is completely off the charts stuff is old we&#39;ve had basically no um non-residential fixed assets spending basically peaked in the 50s collapsed in the late 70s early 80 early 90s and uh is has just started to recover so there&#39;s going to be a lot of capb backs and uh spending fixed assets small cap sales growth highly correlated with capex growth so as this recovers and Manufacturing recovers what does best small caps uh which we&#39;re excited about uh much more more so than large caps uh historical Guide to the election okay presidential election year so the year before the election is the best the election year is second best the year after the election is just fine and then the midterm years are the worst so keep that in mind uh Democratic presidential split so this is a bunch of uh okay year after the election post World War II Market stronger returns when the same party remained in control well we&#39;ll see if that happens it&#39;s not pointing to that right now so we&#39;ll keep an eye open to it uh in election years small caps typically sell off in October which happened and then rally in November December that not only happens in election years where small caps rally like crazy in November and December that happens in every year if you look at Cooper sard stock it it has its biggest moves often times in November and December along with small caps and yes we were in the market buying more CPS uh in election years that doesn&#39;t mean you should I&#39;m just telling you that&#39;s what we were doing opinion not advice in election years small caps typically underperform large caps and outperform the following following the election through year end look at this chart with small caps in November and December October week November December through the roof uh very exciting times so far so good with a 5% earnings beat Led Led by financials that they&#39;re talking about earnings season so far uh using rate pressure to translate by the way you know they&#39;re talking about falling interest rate U mortgage rates that&#39;s not happening yet this is a counter Trend rally I&#39;m telling you that right now that um we&#39;re going to talk about October is the worst month of the year for bonds November is the best month so as we talked about with Stu vanney Stuart vanney sell the rumor selling bonds October bu the news in November yields will compress mortgage rates will go back down improving sentiment suggests re accelerating EPS growth in Q4 in line with consensus so this was a trough Q3 kind of layo earnings followed by Q4 should be back up to uh big time growth positive reaction to beats most positive reactions to beats since second quarter of 2012 so that has not been the case up till now and now people are getting optimistic when companies beat they really drive them up so that&#39;s really good uh and not only have beats out perform but misses uh haven&#39;t gone down as much which is consistent with a bull market uh this is from Bank of America a tax hike to 28% from 21% is expected to be a a 5% hit to EPS that&#39;s the Harris Administration proposal so that would imply the S&amp;P goes down uh a tax cut to 15% from 21% could be an estimated 4% benefit to S&amp;P 500 EPS uh I would bet zero on that happening but uh you never know if you get a sweep which I I wouldn&#39;t bet on either but um I don&#39;t know people that are much smarter in politics than I am seem awfully confident but uh you know I I would not make any major economic decisions on the basis of that speculation geographical sales exposure this shows that North American based companies have still have 71% exposure in the US um and then 29% the rest of the world European companies have only 21% in the US Japanese 15 and Asian countries are getting all which makes sense but actually is it&#39;s nice to see it colorcoded uh here we go an investment year in 2025 looks priced the recent discount to S&amp;P PE multiple reflects concerns over Parks over earning and a lack of conviction in long-term streaming profits so what they&#39;re saying here is the Disney premium versus discount to the S&amp;P 500 forward PE ratio and the one thing you&#39;ll notice is in those rare instances when Disney was trading at such a multiple discount to the SNP preceded monster Allstar rallies in Disney we love Disney we own Disney we uh buy Disney we visit Disney we everything Disney so happy Disney we expect a reacceleration of experiences and by the way I me talk about the most nonsense announcement that they made they made a few announcements this week number one uh they&#39;re going to let you cut the line uh I guess they have another way to cut the line without getting the special uh one-on-one tours uh so basically they&#39;re going to collect more revenues doing that they&#39;re raising the annual ticket prices and they announced that they&#39;re going to announce that they&#39;re going to announce sometime in 26 who they&#39;re going to announce as the successor to Bob Iger which means uh you can take the mantle of leadership from his cold dead hands because he&#39;s not going anywhere he realized that the minute you retire uh and you get in the back of the car there&#39;s no one in the front to hit the gas so and your phone stops ringing so he decided uh uh yeah I&#39;m going to hang out to this until death so uh so that&#39;s not a horrible thing Iger will be fine uh until eventually they push him out but um for now it&#39;s great we expect a re acceleration of experiences operating income growth in fiscal year 2026 as part of U cruise ship startup cost flip to profits so you can see uh Parks including cruises total experiences just super duper re acceleration out to fiscal year 2026 2027 2028 off the chart and then you see operating income from Disney&#39;s entertainment assets saw meaningful earnings growth in fiscal year 2024 led by Falling streaming losses so they went break even on streaming and all of a sudden the operating income is booming and no one&#39;s giving the them any credit as a matter of fact the the stock right now is just basically priced for the experiences and the products and you get all the entertainment for free including ESPN Disney the movies the Hulu etc etc etc And yet when you look out a couple years you see $19 billion of operating income that had zero value ascribe to it so uh what else you want to talk about this is price is what you pay value is what you get uh quote we see improving DTC profitability as the primary driver of entertainment growth ahead this is from Morgan Stanley by the way now that streaming has reached profitability Disney is focused on managing down okay so that&#39;s that uh US Government bond yield another counter Trend rally we will show you the seasonality behind that dollar counter Trend rally we will show you the seasonality behind that uh corporate sentiment indicators tracking at a record level so far this earning season what is that consistent with it&#39;s consistent with the beginning of recoveries not the tops and uh you could see here in 2011 and if you look back to the early 2000s was a similar story Chinese consumers will respond to incentives what you saw was incentives in household appliances recently and what did you see sales of household appliances went through the roof expect to see more of that in retail and with Alibaba as the toll taker of the retail business in China to quote my friend in Dubai uh who I&#39;m GNA go out and see sometime in q1 um they&#39;ll take advantage car sales in China in September were the highest for 2024 uh so that&#39;s that what do we have here this is oh the big major events coming up in the next few weeks you have October payrolls in the first Friday of uh that would be not first Friday of November for October that&#39;s before the next fomc meeting so that&#39;s going to be a critical volatility day uh first Friday of November uh then you have the US elections then you have the fomc then you have October CPI and then you have Nvidia earnings the third week of November so a lot of big volatility days and as you can see here breath continues to broaden the advanced decline line for the S&amp;P 500 skyrocketing midcap skyrocketing small cap skyrocketing this is a good thing and overall margins are at highs next 12-month profit margin 13.6% highest ever is unbelievable insiders are selling into the strength as we talked about so um I&#39;d be cognizant where that uh is rampant and stay away and we&#39;ve talked about that in many past weeks the combined property losses from Helen and Milton are likely amongst the top 10 hurricanes since World War II uh we haven&#39;t seen anything like that since 2017 with Harvey and and Maria okay I guess Harvey and Maria and if you recall we covered a few weeks ago there was a total loss of 623,000 cars total loss which led to the highest SAA SAR of the cycle which led to $146 stock price for Cooper standard on $719 of earnings so this is not at that levels of Ian but it&#39;s close I think we&#39;re going to see a decent amount of car loss and you saw um the GM earnings they had a big amount of pull forward in US truck production in the most recent quarter uh so that bodess well for Cooper standard it&#39;s all about volume and uh this could be a contributing factor to help into a yearend uh rally with small cap which would potentially make this uh one of the most incredible uh situations that we could think of so uh BuyBacks corporate clients hit record highs in June well above Trend rolling four-week average Trends by market cap large cap inflows since April are up midcaps have been down small caps have been up the past 3 weeks uh we covered large caps midcaps are just turning up now recently small cap inflows since June have been pretty solid US Financial conditions turning up fiveyear uh inflation break evens are back to 2.2 and change it looks like 2.25 so that&#39;s pretty good uh that&#39;s inflation expectations which the FED watch very closely we talked about the low valuations xus uh which implies International which implies what 2002 to 2007 who will win the presidential election here is Ki this is one of the betting um things that everyone goes to it&#39;s showing 59 Trump 41 Cala I mean this stuff can be misleading so don&#39;t get faked out but the market it feels like the market is pricing in this this outcome and we just need to be cognizant of it uh irrespective of which side you&#39;re on politically it makes no difference here we are on the side of making money uh by by following a solid framework and being patient and playing the time Arbitrage game non-financial corporate business net interest payment near record lows this shows corporate balance sheets are doing great um corporate client buybacks on track for record year S&amp;P company tax rate has declined over the past several decades you can see that here I mean this is really really low uh seasonal okay we&#39;re going to cover that in the uh article of the week markets are pricing in fewer fed cuts that is a function of good economic data I think we&#39;re still going to get the November 25 we&#39;ll see about the December uh wouldn&#39;t surprise me either way but uh lot lot of things in the works now so we&#39;ll see what happens Eurozone consumer confidence has been going straight up that&#39;s a good thing uh us beige book activity same thing you see at at every recovery you have the first initial rally off the death nail like we did in 2020 big rally and then you just check back and say hello before the next move up very similar to the mid uh 885 decade off of the last steep tightening cycle we saw from 80 to 82 you had that Spike and then you had this test back and then you had a continued recovery through the early 90s when you had a mild recession and um so this implies several more years of Runway I was talking to a friend uh over the I don&#39;t I don&#39;t remember when but it was about um you know the average recession you get a recession every 4.1 years you have to keep in mind we have had two in the last four years which does imply I.E 2022 two qus of uh negative GDP growth and that&#39;s what positioned us perfectly in the trough of 2022 when we were pounding the table to buy in the hole and everyone else was selling in the hole for recession and I contined to say I remember this was on Charles Payne show everyone&#39;s preparing for a recession we just had in the rearview mirror we had two quarters of negative GDP growth in 2022 look it up that&#39;s a technical recession whether the government wanted to label it or not is I do I could care less um you know what what&#39;s that old thing if it looks like uh it probably is anyway I&#39;ll leave that to you uh and then 20120 so 2020 we had a recession 2022 we had a recession which implies we&#39;re not due for another 8 years if you take four years on a another six years if you take every four years on average 2000 it would have been 2004 but we had it pulled forward in 2022 uh and then the next one would be uh 2028 so that implies uh at least another four years from here so um latest us Bond selloff Echoes the one after the 1995 fed cut we&#39;ve been making the case for a long time that this was a midcycle cut just like 1995 which is why I&#39;m in the camp that um we may wind up with a higher terminal rate than everyone thinks uh everyone thinks it has to go down to three or two and a half to get to inflation I think inflation is going to run higher like we did post World War II uh three three and a half maybe four in a band of 2 and a half to four uh to bring down debt to GDP ratio inflate away uh like we&#39;ve always done and um this is very very interesting here because the so I&#39;m going to show you what happened two times number one was 1995 the last time you had this midcycle cut and you saw this fake out counter Trend rally in yields right after the first cut where yields Rose 50 basis points so here we are this is the long Bond I think this is the 30-year 1995 so you had the same collapse in bonds spike in yields into the first cut and then you rally higher and then you get these check backs and consolidations checkback and consolidation before moving moving higher in bonds lower in yields over the insu years so that&#39;s the 1995 story but then you look here at te treasury Futures put call skew and we&#39;ve covered skew on Equity options for quite some time uh and and particularly in recent weeks and and have talked quite a lot but skew on treasuries I.E purchasing options one and two standard deviations out for huge moves has never been uh bigger than it is right now and the last time it got this extended meaning people were short treasuries was September of 2023 when we were pounding the table to buy bonds and that yields were going to compress and that was the Peak at 5% 10-year Treasury and sure enough there is your September 2023 with a a 107 low here on this uh 30-year Bond and uh straight up rally pretty much ever since now a little consolidation before we make the next move higher uh here is a survey from Alpine macro did you overweight buy Chinese stocks based on beijing&#39;s latest policy changes and the vast majority were saying yes due to a tactical upgrade um uh the ones who said no said they were waiting for a bigger package and then there was a group that said yes expecting major reating we&#39;re kind of in the ladder Camp expecting a major reating over time do the math which is code for opinion follows Trend China May raise the quota on special purpose municipal bonds we we covered that in recent weeks it&#39;ll be about $859 billion dollar of stimulus just shy of a trillion US Dollars over the next three years uh that will be more than enough here&#39;s another poll oh that&#39;s the Ki poll then you&#39;ve got um predicted uh continuing claims have pushed higher this is a very important number to watch if uh this is reflected in the jobs report the first Friday you can be assured that in November the 95% odds that are currently in for 25 basis point cut will be fulfilled uh initial came down but that&#39;s uh very noisy from week to week and it was coming off an enormous spike in September and that&#39;s that for the uh charts of the week Disney World Disneyland launch new pass to skip long lines for a heft price we like Hefty prices as owners um 400 bucks a day that&#39;s really cheap uh compared to the tours but uh good for them Alibaba Cloud&#39;s AI technology Sparks breakthrough in RNA virus Discovery so all these things that we&#39;re not getting paid for yet which we will in the future Intel to sell minority stake in Altera for 17 billion Oh I thought they were going out of business oh yeah that they selling off this tiny part of their business for $17 billion by the way so it&#39;s all part of a bigger turnaround plan Amazon exec tells employees to quit if they don&#39;t want to work five days a week in the office commercial continues to come back he made a fiser a household name Wall Street wants more so you got starboard value in uh fizer now that&#39;s going to be a heavy LIF but we keep our eyes on it that one could be interesting it&#39;s just there&#39;s nothing we really want to sell to put in its place but uh we will continue to keep an eye on that um uh this shows that spending is the problem not taxes so if the polls and uh betting odds are correct and musk comes in and does this spending cut program you know the thing about musk is all the things that people say are impossible and can&#39;t be done he finds a way to do to do it so on that basis if he could actually normalize spending then we could keep tax rates low and it would be the formula for an absolute boom less regulation less spending uh more money in the hands of private business owners who know how to allocate much better than government bureaucrats and continue to be Off to the Races China GDP annual growth rate again that came in at 4.6 topping expectations of 4.5 uh China&#39;s home sales gain momentum as beijing&#39;s support revives confidence uh China capital inflow jumps in September as F shift to Yuan Chinese share BuyBacks hit record high as Beijing steps up support why am I not logged in 33 billion in BuyBacks so far in 2024 ah here we go share BuyBacks have soared in main mainland China this year I mean look at this stuff uh is absolutely incredible off the charts and just the beginning literally off the chart here we&#39;ve never seen anything like it China Cuts key lending rates to support growth starboard reportedly takes big stake in Tylen all maker Ken VI by the way I met the CEO of Ken view at uh at the El Smith dinner and talked to him and his lovely wife for literally a half hour before the event these are the nicest people I&#39;ve ever met and uh it&#39;s funny I went back the next morning and I looked at the stock I said this thing is perfect I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s great uh and I just said I&#39;d just like it to come down a little bit lower and sure enough the next day um some activist came in and the stock shot up 8% so we&#39;ll keep an eye on that one if it comes back down quite a bit uh we&#39;d be interested in taking a look uh all the Staples are a little bit elevated right now so I&#39;d want I&#39;d want a opportunity to buy it cheaper but he&#39;s got a great group of Brands spun out of J&amp;J um in all Band-Aid brand uh all the consumer products from Legacy J&amp;J which is pretty exciting and I think he&#39;s generally doing a great job uh us continues to surprise to the upside that&#39;s from yardeni that&#39;s the economic uh surprise index which we&#39;ve covered crisis at Boeing and Intel are a National Emergency not only are they a national emergency but the national government is going to back stop them so that&#39;s why we continue to add on weakness for both of these companies uh and I think they&#39;re be enormous opportunities Boeing is a duopoly which we covered a million times and Intel the government has no choice but to prop up their Foundry business just like they propped up Elon musk&#39;s uh EV business because it was an initiative of the uh US government to subsidize it until it became profitable on its own which we also covered ironically on Neil Kabuto today and they will do the exact same thing to Intel until they get get their foundaries and can compete with Taiwan semiconductor and so everyone chasing all these uh guys who design chips they are completely worthless without the people that make the chips Taiwan semiconductor and soon to be Intel insiders are selling into the great bull market of 2024 we covered uh with steady sales new vehicle inventory begins to look and feel normal uh getting back to 2019 levels which means what we are going to start to get more and more incentives and more and more price reductions and more and more interest rate reductions from the fed and the game is going to hum for Cooper standard opinion the stock market is ready for its melt up as investors ignore growing risks uh who&#39;s this from uh Ed yard Denny okay Intel plans to form Foundry alliance with Samsung so they&#39;re basically three major foundaries in the world Samsung Taiwan semiconductor and Intel that Alliance is a good thing not a bad thing GM stock had its best day since 2020 after the auto America tops wall Street&#39;s third quarter expectations and raises guidance he talked about the pull forward in truck production so that&#39;s all good for Cooper standard uh China stock market could enjoy instant Boost from two trillion Yuan fund says Think Tank says the fund would enhance the stability of the capital market and promote steady growth so all these things are happening in the background and all the people who bought up at 120 are puking at 95 just before it goes to 140 and Beyond Traders enthusiasm for stocks return to levels seen just before 10% drop last year that&#39;s from City Bank um always wrong never in doubt but certainly plausible America is primed for a home renovation resurgent with rates coming down that benefits Stanley Black and&amp; Decker that benefits gener uh that benefits uh a lot of lot of great companies that have been left behind Disney is going to cost more to visit Disney World for the holidays next year um so you know instead of buying the tickets buy the stock feds daily says she doesn&#39;t see reasons to stop cutting rates we agree uh Insider selling soures to three-year highs in the US while China buyback surg to record at lows this is the kind of Divergence so what do we want to do we want to buy the stock that us insiders are selling and here he has the chart of Nvidia with all the Insider sales um it&#39;s just funny I mean they&#39;re almost perfect they sell at these Peaks they don&#39;t sell in the hole they sell sell at the Peaks to the retail announced stockit splits they stop selling down here they sell at the Peaks you&#39;re going to see a ton of stock dumped on heads in the next few weeks and on and on and on Europe&#39;s rate Cuts will lift stocks where to find Value the massive flooring company says the housing market will get better next year that&#39;s from Mohawk Industries uh Boeing workers reject a $23,000 pay raise what comes next half of them get fired and then the strike gets done Tail of Two Cities stock market incent this shows TLT seasonality over the past 20 years it shows that uh this is October is the worst month for bonds meaning yields rise November is the best Bond uh month for bonds prices rise yields fall uh so expect to see the same thing uh okay update regarding the union workers rejected the 35% pay raise in bonuses expect Boeing to announce another round of layoffs in the next two days and raise $10 billion plus of capital to starve out or weight out the union facts the union head earns 330,000 a year 33,000 Boeing Strikers are getting paid $250 a week with no salaries many of which have normally six figure incomes this is costing the union $8.25 million per week the union started with $300 million of assets it has been depleted for 5 weeks which is 8.25 * 5 is 41 million this implies the the IMA has less than 260 million left the problem is there are 530,000 members of the IM Union so Boeing workers only represent 6% of this Union&#39;s member and they have already depleted 133% of the total assets in 5 weeks if you were the other 500,000 nonbing members who had contributed dues for years how comfortable would you be to see your reserves dwindling into the abyss the only reason you contribute is so that money is there if you go on a strike they pay you uh $250 a week while you&#39;re on the strike but if Boeing uses up all the money you get nothing and they get nothing so meanwhile the strike is costing Boeing a billion dollars a month they can raise 1010 billion in a minute and wait them out for 10 months or if they raise $20 billion in a combination of debt and Equity wait them out for over a year and a half by the way for everyone worried about delution if they raised $20 billion of all Equity tomorrow which they wouldn&#39;t it would only take the share count back to 2014 levels they have repurchased billions of dollars of stock over the last decade meanwhile the union cannot go raise money in the public markets at the drop of a hat they rely on contributions from working union members 6% of whom are not working the union will cease to exist in 31.5 weeks just over half of a year as 6% of the union members from Boeing will have burned through 100% of the cash in addition to the union being unable to compete with Boeing on a waiting game due to their inability to raise 10 billion in the public markets overnight the workers who are not receiving salaries and getting paid $250 a week by the union are running desperately behind on their mortgages car payments and other bills many who have now rejected a 35% pay raise plus bonuses will find themselves with a 100% pay loss as the next round of 177,000 cuts is imminent so that&#39;s the story there um covered that Tale of Two Cities the themes here here um mags 493 great unmagnify out before mag 7 with a progrowth White House small caps outperform large caps values outperform growth Emerging Markets outperform developed markets uh money coming in out of bonds and into so we covered this the last time that this much money came out of bonds uh October 2024 two standard deviations worth was 20 2002 2001 2002 2003 and what happened over the next seven years well you had um small caps have the biggest rally one of their biggest rallies in history over the next few years uh emerging markets and then China had their biggest of all time so that&#39;s that we covered and then seasonality where are we are we here which would be uh S&amp;P seasonal composite since 1928 the bottom go is in on October 20 7th and then you start to Rally uh into year end could be there and this is another seasonal composite during election years where you get a little bit more weakness into the end of October and then you rally into the end of the year either way this Mor of the story is rallying to the end of the year uh fear and greed is still not an extreme greed neither is a Association of active investment managers uh retail earnings top 30 weights uh estimate revisions in the last 60 days were down 1.7% transports were also down 1.62% estimates down for 2025 uh from 277 to 275 so keeping an eye on that I think that will bounce up after we get through the middle of earning season uh uh we covered that and now okay so now we&#39;re on to the ask me anything questions the podcast is officially over uh but many of you like to stick around for the ask me anything questions which we&#39;re going to get to right now so this comes from Aaron L hey Tom always look forward to weekly podcast video cast was hoping you could take a look at PBF energy PBF interested to hear your thoughts thanks okay Alan thanks for sending that in let&#39;s look at PBF okay so it&#39;s up 10x but it&#39;s dropped 50% from the peak after being up 20x uh let&#39;s see PBF look I I think Energy&#39;s going to actually get a rally but uh so you know revenues are down they&#39;re just recovering cash flow I think there are higher and better uses it&#39;s not bad but I I don&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t buy it here um leave it at that that&#39;s just from a lot of experience Sam R thoughts on ADM stock Archer Danel Midland let&#39;s take a look do like exposure in a uh probably not yet but let&#39;s take a look I mean long term you&#39;re fine but I think they&#39;re probably better ENT entry points revenues are down a bit shrink this a little bit yeah there we go free cash flows cut in half since 2021 let&#39;s see yeah I think it&#39;s okay I just think it&#39;s a not yet story it&#39;s close story but not yet story um and I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s uh 20 bucks away or 10 bucks or five bucks I it&#39;s just not it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a fat pitch down the middle for me yet uh Sagar kanak kanakia hi Tom hope you&#39;re well was just listening to Boeing earnings call CFO mentioned specifically DSS division expect margins to be negative fix Parts development programs I understand building has a huge lack backlock uh strike will cause sufficient company profitability once turns to ship this thing is going to Mint cash once the stri the the workers come back on it take a few months to get back on to full production but there&#39;s nothing to really think about here in my view uh Paul girz hey Tom hope as well rereading some of Buffett&#39;s letters wanted to share a quote from the 1987 Le letter that&#39;s relative to Alibaba quote the speed at which a business&#39;s success is recognized furthermore is not that important as long as the company&#39;s intrinsic value is increasing at a satisfactory rate in fact delayed recognition can be an advantage it may give us the chance to buy more of a good thing at a bargain price that has certainly been the case with Alibaba and now with Boeing uh so we&#39;re pretty excited about that he says you preached this concept countless times but I figured it would be a great reminder for us listeners as Alibaba takes a breather smart listeners have been and will continue to take advantage thanks again for all you&#39;ve taught us Paul gir well thank you Paul that was a very nice thing to share uh ET Naman asks can you look at Theo see V a l e o e all right so this company does uh powertrain lighting driver assistance thermal cameras lar radar I mean lar companies are a train wreck I really would not do that um but let me just see the company&#39;s financials real quick um I mean right now the only people that sell EV cars effectively is Tesla and they don&#39;t use lar they probably should but they don&#39;t um Leo let me see this sell systems for automakers in assistance powert train systems thermal system okay so it&#39;s an auto part supplier parking and driving assistance uh Radars connectivity shortterm flywheels fuel consumption enhanced driving Comfort uh I think that I think this is a this is just a Cooper standard Story part two volumes are the name of the game probably less operating leverage than Cooper standard but uh maybe a little healthier let&#39;s take a look here it&#39;s interesting though their revenues have been flat since 2017 so they didn&#39;t really have that big dip and Rise so you&#39;re not going to let see here Ro I is mid single digits it&#39;s not been uh that great of a business but let&#39;s take a look what&#39;s the book cash flow yeah I I mean I think this one might be beaten down because you know it&#39;s French number one and number two uh all these Auto Part suppliers have all gotten hit just the basket I think this one&#39;s worth doing some work on um so good work good find uh but not without risk so now you got to do the real work and get on you know dozen or so conference calls look at the that&#39;s presentation establish a short thesis as to why are people short and getting out and then what is your Edge to why you should be getting in when everyone else is getting out Vincent sent more uh hey Tom I know you already own Cooper standard curious to hear your thoughts on aptive probably the same thing a TV yeah margin starting to re accelerate it a PB yeah I think that this one also warrants some work uh electrical safety technology solution commercial miricle markets signal and Power Solutions engineer component products yeah look these are all going to work when Cooper works I just think that the the operating leverage per unit of dollar at risk is is greatest with that one but uh I think that you know you could you could have a basket of it too Muhammad OT taibi appreciate the podcast I appreciate you listening uh can you please tell me your daily routine how you get productive uh also opinion on accidental looks good for the next five years so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a question or an assertion that you think it looks good for 5 years um uh first off thank you for listening and my daily routine um depends on the day yeah I think they&#39;re better things to do than oxy but um people get faked out because they think Buffett&#39;s buying so much but he&#39;s actually B exercising a ton of warrants he got for debt financing when they did a big deal in 2019 he got all these warrants they were completely worthless in 2020 and and then once they got back in the money he&#39;s been exercising it for stock before they expire so um so don&#39;t mistake that to Natural buying near the highs uh it&#39;s a completely different story he has a lower basis so um daily routine I read I mean the first two hours of every day I basically read um then I go through all of our portfolio uh then I look for opportunity I mean it it really just depends on the day I exercise do push-ups do crunches uh walk on the treadmill watch CNBC and Fox Business um and work my ass off that&#39;s what I like to do so I don&#39;t I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have to think about getting productive I am immediately productive uh you know old Basics write down a to-do list the night before check it off during the day uh read read read most important thing is reading and learning and um there you go that is for [Music] uh that is for a client uh that came in late okay well we&#39;re closed out for this quarter um first thanks for a very good podcast what are your thoughts on super micro computer uh not interested but I&#39;ll just take a quick look for you okay so it went up 100x and now it&#39;s falling 60% so everyone&#39;s excited to buy it up only 40x uh this is not for me I don&#39;t care if they make cancer cures I&#39;m not interested I think we covered this one last week anyway but thank you for the question Anders uh and welcome to the podcast I can tell you&#39;re probably newer um and uh we&#39;re grateful to have you on board and hope you learn some stuff over the next couple of years Kyle Burns can you take a look at DNA and let me know if you&#39;d considered it undervalued with enough margin of safety I look at it every two weeks and I continue to say no I mean you&#39;re betting on it should work like fiser should work but you&#39;re betting on them coming up with like a cancer vaccine which if they do it&#39;ll be aund bagger and if it and if they don&#39;t it&#39;ll just languish there so um I can&#39;t I&#39;m not in the predict predicting Market uh we still have a big position in biotech as a basket which which we believe is going to continue to benefit from lower and lower rates over the next two years and go parabolic uh and we&#39;re happy to participate that way in a basket but guessing what things are going to get approved or not approved or thinking we have a a scientific Edge and gambling on it uh absolutely uh hard pass okay that&#39;s another Philipe Andrew Pinko says do you have any book Rec mination for recommendations for better understanding free cash flow and solvency analysis especially in the context of turnaround situations love to die deeper bu confidence up blah blah blah keep advocating your podcast among my circle thanks for sharing all right so first off thank you for sharing it with your friends and your Social Circle if you&#39;re getting value from this the number one compliment you could pay is share it with one or two people you know and love who love markets and would benefit from this information the more people you share it with the longer I&#39;m going to do it for free for non-client and um happy to continue to do that because of people like you Philip uh start with security analysis uh by Benjamin Graham and then the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham and then read the CFA books if you haven&#39;t done that yet and uh that&#39;ll be a good starting point and then you need you know a decade or two of experience also helps Kate howls no okay TI Tom rates continue on the decline and business cycle broadly ticks up as expected will reach as a segment reversed or downward long course or at least stabilized oh they&#39;ve already stabilized if you&#39;re in the right ones I mean we bought crown castle in the 90s and it&#39;s up you know got up to like 115 120 now I think it&#39;s 110 that&#39;s just getting started that&#39;s another one we got into right before Paul singer got into it at Elliott with his activist campaign [Music] um yeah the ones you pose here are lower quality reach so I wouldn&#39;t be in those we we went with the high quality we did verado when no one wanted it we made a quick double we got out it&#39;s it&#39;s continue to be fine I think that will continue to work uh we&#39;re just playing it through crown castle we don&#39;t need to dig down deep because you&#39;re never going to you know when you look at cim I think that&#39;s Chimera you&#39;re never going to understand what&#39;s in the portfolios of these tiny little companies with mortgage back Securities um it&#39;s funny we were talking about this at dinner the other night with the fox boys uh what&#39;s n n NL is the best one in terms of mortgage back Securities they&#39;ve already recovered um I really don&#39;t want to mess with the WPC mpw and cim they might work as trades but like you&#39;re just kind of gambling and [Music] winning oh WP carry all right I&#39;ll take a look at that one for you I think that&#39;s uh that&#39;s a higher quality one PC I knew Chimera back in the day they had really good management I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s still the same uh net leas properties Self Storage all right financial analysis balance sheet cash flow and snapshots 5.8% I mean w up carry is probably okay um mpw what&#39;s that a medical properties trust you got to be careful with those I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re guessing and you&#39;ll probably be right I mean that&#39;s takes a huge amount of work to get confidence in that I I just look Reit had their big decline whatever it was when we were talking about verado okay that&#39;s when we were buyers and what we like to do is get huge sector locations and then buy the highest quality companies in those so in 2020 when energy was trading negative we weren&#39;t buying corizo oil and gas we were buying Exxon Mobile in the 20s we were buying uh the the best companies Chevron uh uh ocidental that type of stuff in the 20s forado buying in the hole I mean I remember you guys like we anyway buying in 18 buying again at 12 uh and then it just shot from 15 to 30 overnight and took a double and sure enough it keeps going but you know it&#39;s you got to book some gains every now and then and we had to take a gain so same thing with Boston properties that&#39;s what you want to buy you buy the highest quality when it&#39;s when the whole sector is in the hole that&#39;s how you make money China in the hole what did we do we bought the highest quality thing so X on mobile in the 20s okay and the thing just completely doubled and it continued to go up so anyway uh I don&#39;t like to dig down second and third tier unless it&#39;s a really special situation like Cooper standard I just wait for super fat pitches the whole thing got shellacked like China and then just buy the highest quality where you have say if this sector is going to remain alive this will be the winner and you you then you can lean into it you can&#39;t lean into like what&#39;s the point of having a 100 position 1% position uh and you know half of them don&#39;t work and then the other half make five like just get the best quality so you can put some size into eight or 10 12 companies and sleep well at night like Disney like Boeing like in I don&#39;t have to stay up at night thinking about these companies it&#39;s just a Time Arbitrage some are going to double and triple in a year or two some are going to take three to five years and overbalance on average over the portfolio it takes them three years and we just rinse and repeat over and over and over and we get a kicker with our option expression derivative overlays and um you know it just works and that&#39;s why you saw all these beautiful people that I acknowledged at the beginning of the call uh want to be a part of it and we&#39;re very grateful and we will continue to work Non-Stop and be productive every day on their behalf and uh so on all right so here&#39;s a guy who&#39;s got the Cooper standard of China again don&#39;t want to deal with these lowquality companies in China because half of them are you know wind up having crap numbers and um I&#39;m just not going to take country and Company risk this is this is a train wreck forget it um I&#39;m sure the numbers look good I just don&#39;t know if the numbers are correct uh let&#39;s just see here that is new client uh okay last question Roy nkuzi love the podcast thoughts on the US coal Market specifically ticker AMR coal market so it&#39;s up 200% % since 2020 and because it&#39;s pulled back to 100% we are now excuse me 200x yeah it&#39;s up 200x since 2020 and now it&#39;s pulled back to 100x and we&#39;re going to look at it okay I will entertain that let&#39;s take a look AMR all right so cash flow is coming down after peaking revenues are coming down margins are coming down and the Stock&#39;s up 100x uh for me it&#39;s a hard pass I&#39;ll stick with my natural gas Comm stock resources hopefully I&#39;ll run into my quote unquote partner Jerry Jones in early November when I&#39;m at the Cowboys game so uh and uh shake his hand that would be fun if I come back with a Jerry Jones picture for the podcast that would that would be something else anyway with that said I want to thank everyone for tuning in so grateful that you come and join me every week we&#39;ll be back next week same time I think same place in the meantime make it a great one bye for now oh [Music] p [Music] [Music]
