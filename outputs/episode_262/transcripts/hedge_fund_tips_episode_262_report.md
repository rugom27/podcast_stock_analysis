**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on small caps, emerging markets, industrials, financials, and value stocks over growth stocks. He is pounding the table on Alibaba and Boeing, and sees a buying opportunity in Disney. He believes the market is pricing in a Trump win and a split government, which is ideal for the stock market.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Market is pricing in pro-growth policies.
- Seasonality favors buying bonds in November.
- Small caps, Emerging Markets, Industrials, financials, value over growth will outperform.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is in the early stages of a bull cycle, with strong economic data and improving sentiment. The FED may not cut rates as much as the market expects, and inflation may run higher than expected. A split government is the ideal outcome for the stock market.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| China GDP Growth | 4.6% | China's GDP came in slightly better than expected, indicating a recovery in the Chinese economy. |
| US Unemployment Rate | Low, but showing signs of weakness | The labor market is still strong, but there are some signs of weakness, which could lead the FED to cut rates. |
| Corporate Margins | Near all-time highs | Corporate margins are near all-time highs and are not yet showing signs of letting up, which is a positive sign for the economy. |
| Treasury Futures Put Call Skew | Extended | People were short treasuries. Last time it got this extended was September of 2023 when we were pounding the table to buy bonds and that yields were going to compress and that was the Peak at 5% 10-year Treasury and sure enough. |
