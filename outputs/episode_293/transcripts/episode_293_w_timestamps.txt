[0.719s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.879s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.64s] 293rd videocast podcast for the week
[8.24s] ending May 29th, 2025. Got a lot to
[11.44s] cover today, but as always, family
[13.84s] first. So, Mimi completed her first year
[16.48s] at 68 Water Polo Academy and can&#39;t wait
[18.72s] to return in the fall. Annabelle swam in
[20.96s] the Speedo Grand Challenge where she
[22.64s] discovered a new best event, the 200 IM
[26.56s] uh individual medalley. She won the 200
[28.64s] IM at the meet with a time of
[31.719s] 23129, beating some nationally ranked
[34.239s] 12y olds and smashing her own Nova team
[37.2s] record by
[39.32s] 2.73 seconds. Uh so this was Irvine Nova
[42.879s] Aquatics uh congratulating her. Super
[45.52s] proud. Great job. Awesome as always. Uh
[49.52s] did some channel checks at Irvine
[51.2s] Spectrum. We went to see obviously uh
[54.16s] sent the kids to see Lilo and Stitch on
[57.44s] Memorial Day. So, they got to contribute
[59.6s] to Walt Disney&#39;s earnings uh which we
[62.32s] own a significant stake in. And uh
[65.28s] Caitlyn and I saw Mission Impossible.
[67.28s] First time in a movie theater for a long
[68.96s] time. Really enjoyed that.
[70.64s] Unfortunately, that&#39;s paramount and we
[72.32s] don&#39;t own any, but we just simply
[73.92s] enjoyed the show. I was surprised
[76.32s] because we got out of the movie theater.
[78.0s] It was like 9:00 on Monday night and I
[81.2s] walked by Vans and Vans was packed and
[83.84s] maybe this has something to do with it.
[86.0s] These low profofiles. Two of the girls
[88.479s] were buying these. That&#39;s a new product.
[91.2s] And then this I haven&#39;t heard anything
[92.96s] about, but I almost bought these. And I
[95.68s] may go back and get these brown ones. Um
[98.799s] already have three pairs of Vans in my
[100.32s] closet, but they&#39;re called the Curran. C
[102.72s] U R E N. And I thought these were super
[106.24s] cool.
[108.04s] Um, so yeah, I might have to go back and
[110.479s] get those. Uh, you can see here more of
[112.88s] a crowd doing my channel checks. Uh,
[115.04s] this is my wall of flags. When I go to
[117.6s] special golf courses, I like to buy a
[119.52s] flag. And this week I or last week, I
[122.719s] got to play Emirates Golf Club in Dubai.
[126.56s] Absolutely incredible time with my host,
[128.879s] Phillip. Uh, we&#39;ll show you some
[130.56s] pictures there in Ah, there they are.
[132.72s] Okay. Uh, that&#39;s Phillip in the middle.
[136.0s] The Emirates Golf Club was truly
[138.239s] spectacular. It was a little warm this
[140.319s] time of year, but uh it was good to work
[142.4s] up off some of those beautiful breakfast
[145.12s] buffets and and lovely dinners, etc. Uh
[148.4s] David and I are wearing the hedge fund
[150.08s] tipped hats. Uh and uh Philip informed
[153.28s] me, he&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, you know, it is
[155.92s] close to summertime in Dubai. Black is
[158.48s] not the most reflective color.&quot; He was
[161.2s] smart enough to wear a white hat. That&#39;s
[163.12s] part of the city in the background
[164.56s] there. Super cool time of my life. Then
[167.84s] I went on a mini tour the last day. Went
[170.16s] to the top of the Burj Khalifa which is
[172.4s] on top of the Dubai Mall is at the
[174.879s] bottom. The Dubai Mall is uh nothing
[177.36s] like I&#39;ve ever seen before. I kind of
[179.44s] joke now people say how was Dubai? I
[181.519s] said well the streets are paved in gold
[183.519s] and the opportunities are unlimited. Uh
[186.4s] and uh that&#39;s the the model in the base.
[189.36s] And then uh oh and then um I did a a
[193.28s] presentation for the
[195.56s] YPO.
[197.08s] Um shout out to my friend Adam Johnson
[200.0s] who was on Fox Business all the time. He
[202.879s] introduced me to Craig Bridgeman who
[204.64s] asked me to do a presentation to the
[206.959s] Dubai YPO group. And then a couple of
[210.159s] the members uh that&#39;s Craig, that&#39;s his
[212.48s] wife. Uh that is
[215.68s] uh Amin Malmuk. He&#39;s doing an incredible
[220.0s] um it&#39;s like a live streaming commerce
[222.72s] site. He went to Harvard Business
[224.0s] School. He worked for Amazon before. And
[226.48s] then Abdullah M. uh Alisram hosted us at
[230.959s] the arts club. We&#39;re very very grateful
[233.12s] that for that. I&#39;ll see you when you&#39;re
[234.4s] in California. Uh just an incredible
[237.36s] time. They they just kept bringing
[239.2s] courses and courses and we were sharing
[241.519s] business anecdotes, talking markets,
[243.68s] just a wonderful uh dinner. And then um
[247.04s] I guess more pictures from the top of
[248.879s] the Burj Khalifa. Uh yeah, like a kid, I
[253.28s] was excited. This is the mall. It&#39;s the
[254.959s] most unbelievable thing. I brought my
[258.079s] host, uh Philip&#39;s incredible wife,
[260.079s] Tammy, uh chocolates from Seas Candies.
[263.68s] And in the US, you know, you can kind of
[266.4s] get them different places, but really
[268.24s] you you mostly get them either in
[270.08s] airports or in the state of California.
[272.32s] Buffett owns it, obviously. Warren
[274.4s] Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway, they had
[276.24s] tried to expand into other states in the
[278.24s] past, but there was this special feeling
[280.4s] in California. So, they just stayed
[281.919s] concentrated in California. So, when I
[283.52s] go places, you know, I I I sometimes try
[286.479s] to bring people seas because it&#39;s not
[288.0s] something they can get every day and
[289.36s] it&#39;s a really spectacular uh
[292.6s] candy. And uh so so
[296.8s] uh they were they were so hospitable.
[299.44s] Number one, Tammy brought my bought my
[302.52s] daughter&#39;s Dubai chocolate and not just
[304.88s] any Dubai chocolate, the best Dubai
[306.72s] chocolate and like six different
[308.24s] variations. It was just unbelievable.
[310.32s] Brought it home, by the way. Traveled
[312.0s] perfectly in my golf case in the cargo
[314.24s] cargo section of the plane. Uh came
[316.32s] back, wasn&#39;t melted at all. I guess it
[318.639s] gets pretty cold down there.
[321.0s] Um so, uh so yeah, I brought seized
[324.88s] candies and thinking like, wow, this is
[327.039s] something they can&#39;t get in Dubai. And
[328.8s] of course, I&#39;m in this mall, which I&#39;ve
[330.639s] never seen anything like it in my life.
[332.88s] Four stories, like probably goes for a
[335.759s] mile. Every possible highest end
[338.479s] everything you could ever imagine, every
[340.56s] brand under LVMH, every Hermes, etc. And
[343.6s] then as I&#39;m walking to the entrance to
[345.6s] the Burj Khalifa to get to the top of
[347.84s] the tower for my tour, like any good
[349.84s] tourist, uh, what do I see? Seas,
[353.36s] candies. I mean, you can&#39;t make this
[355.12s] stuff up. So, of course, I had to text
[357.919s] Philip and say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I thought it
[360.16s] was a special gift, but apparently
[362.08s] there&#39;s nothing you cannot get in
[364.72s] Dubai.&quot; So, uh that was an eyeopening
[368.16s] experience. That&#39;s a special market that
[370.639s] I got to go to and and see all the local
[373.52s] merchants. Uh really got the girls some
[376.08s] really cool stuff there. Thanks for
[378.24s] Charlotte for putting that all together.
[379.919s] Was a special special time. Also,
[381.759s] pictures are starting to roll in from
[383.68s] all the amazing amount of support and
[385.6s] orders we&#39;ve gotten for the hedge fun
[387.68s] tips merch. The golf polo is actually
[389.44s] very popular. Uh, and the hats and
[392.24s] actually everything, the mugs, the
[393.68s] t-shirts. Uh, so here&#39;s the first few
[396.0s] pictures. Obviously, we were wearing our
[397.84s] hats. Then, uh, uh, Rob Klopper, I think
[401.12s] I covered last week, John uh, Janick,
[405.199s] Jim Gelb, Cork Snyder. If you remember
[408.16s] Cork, I went to go speak to his students
[410.639s] in uh uh Westminster High School.
[416.36s] Uh anyway, uh he&#39;s the AP stats teacher
[421.44s] and uh uh he got a t-shirt. Looking good
[424.4s] there, Cork. And he&#39;s doing this long
[426.24s] bicycle ride this weekend uh for
[428.639s] charity. So, good luck with that. I&#39;m
[430.56s] sure you&#39;ll be great. Uh and that is it
[435.28s] on the pictures. Let&#39;s get down to
[438.52s] business. First and foremost,
[442.08s] uh had the pleasure to join Jared
[445.84s] Blickery and Sydney Freed on Yahoo
[448.84s] Finance. Uh stocks in translation, a 20
[452.479s] minute uh kind of podcast back and
[456.56s] forth. Lot of really good points covered
[459.039s] here about Moes, about themes, about
[461.28s] companies, etc. Want to especially thank
[464.56s] Taylor Smith Cloier for having me on.
[467.36s] We&#39;re gonna listen in here.
[471.199s] Welcome to Stocks and Translation
[472.639s] broadcasting from the New York Stock
[474.08s] Exchange. I&#39;m Jared Blickery, your host.
[475.919s] And with me as always is the voice of
[477.599s] the people, Sydney Frerieded. First,
[479.36s] please like, subscribe, and comment on
[480.96s] Stocks and Translation on Spotify, Apple
[483.12s] Music, Amazon, or YouTube. And today we
[485.36s] are welcoming back Tom Hayes. He is the
[487.52s] chairman and manager of Great Hill
[489.599s] Capital. He is a veteran value investor
[491.68s] with over two decades of experience
[493.44s] spotting market turnarounds in tech,
[495.52s] banks, energy, and now housing. And
[498.0s] today we&#39;re going to be talking about
[499.28s] the great value renaissance. A phrase
[501.52s] coined many moons and shows ago. Our
[503.759s] word of the day is moat. Designed to
[506.0s] keep out invading armies and today they
[508.319s] repel competitors. So which castle is
[510.639s] Tom investing in? And this episode is
[512.959s] brought to you by the number 7.5. as in
[515.519s] years. That&#39;s how long Realtor.com says
[518.08s] it will take America to build enough
[519.919s] homes to finally close in the housing
[522.24s] gap and fix the housing shortage. And
[524.56s] Tom has some stock picks to potentially
[526.32s] make it worth your while. So before we
[528.48s] dig in, Tom, uh let&#39;s talk about the
[530.16s] most recent market action. You&#39;re a
[531.839s] value investor. You like the booms and
[533.68s] the bust, and we just had one. What are
[536.0s] you swimming in here? I call it the big
[538.32s] beautiful dislocation. You had uh $1.2
[541.519s] two trillion dollars of forced sales in
[544.0s] the hole from hedge funds and CTAs at
[545.92s] the beginning of April. And then
[547.36s] President Trump put out his tweet, &quot;Now
[548.8s] is a good time to buy stocks and the
[550.48s] market&#39;s up.&quot; And did you uh not only
[552.72s] did we, we were buying, we did a
[554.24s] conference call for our clients the day
[555.76s] before because people were really
[557.36s] worried, right? There it looked like
[558.64s] there was no B. And we went company by
[560.8s] company. We went through balance sheet.
[562.8s] We went through uh income statement. We
[564.8s] went through free cash flow. And what we
[566.32s] saw with invariably was all these
[568.48s] metrics are going up. What&#39;s going down?
[570.16s] the price based on based on the
[572.0s] short-term noise. Long-term, they&#39;ve got
[574.0s] the moes in the business. Even if the
[575.6s] worst case scenario tariff scenario came
[578.24s] to pass, these would be the biggest
[580.16s] players and they&#39;d pick up share from
[581.68s] the smaller players that were hit the
[583.04s] hardest. And that&#39;s why a moat is so
[585.44s] critical. You know, this leads to our
[587.839s] word of the day. Thank you for that,
[589.04s] Tom. Perfect segue. A moat is a
[591.44s] longlasting competitive advantage. Uh
[594.0s] so, so think a castle moat like a
[596.0s] safeguard uh to a firm&#39;s profits. So
[598.32s] Warren Buffett hunts these kinds of
[599.839s] corporate defenses and we have a few
[601.76s] oracle quotes now to set the mood here.
[604.0s] In 1991 he gave a lecture in front of
[606.08s] Notre Dame and he said the most
[607.76s] important thing in evaluating businesses
[609.92s] is figuring out how big the moat is
[612.32s] around the business and what you love is
[614.399s] big capital and a big moat. So is that
[617.68s] what we&#39;re seeing here in some of the
[619.519s] names that you&#39;re looking at and who has
[621.12s] them? There&#39;s no question. I mean
[622.48s] sometimes you have a monopolistic moat
[624.88s] like Boeing has a duopoly with Airbus.
[627.04s] That was not a hard one to figure out.
[628.64s] It dropped down to $129
[631.04s] uh in the most recent sell-off. Uh it&#39;s
[633.44s] very simple. If you want to go to
[634.56s] Airbus, that&#39;s fine. You just have to
[635.92s] wait 20 years for your next plane. So,
[637.519s] that&#39;s an easy one. Then you have brand
[639.279s] modes like Buffett invested a lot in
[641.519s] Coca-Cola in 1989, 1990. Uh now his
[645.12s] dividends each year are bigger than his
[647.12s] original basis because they keep
[648.8s] increasing the dividends. It has that
[650.48s] brand mode. It has the distribution
[652.079s] mode. So, we look for businesses like
[654.079s] that. uh and and brand modes and we&#39;re
[656.56s] going to talk about a few few names like
[658.399s] the Stanley&#39;s, like the DeWalts, like uh
[660.64s] some of those companies in the housing
[662.16s] sector that um people have been using
[664.48s] these tools for generations upon
[666.16s] generations and they&#39;re not going to go
[667.68s] to the second best because they don&#39;t
[669.279s] last uh and they don&#39;t have that same
[671.12s] type of brand uh credibility. So, it
[673.76s] sort of sounds like if you have a
[675.839s] popular brand or it&#39;s a popular company,
[677.76s] you have a moat. But that doesn&#39;t feel
[679.44s] right. Like is any famous stock have a
[683.279s] mode or no? That&#39;s not how it works.
[686.079s] Well, I look Apple I was gonna say Apple
[689.92s] Apple has a brand mode. It has an
[691.36s] ecosystem mode. It kind of built that
[693.2s] monopolistic app store which they
[694.88s] continue to to throw arrows and he
[696.72s] continues to create relationships with
[698.32s] administrations and the arrows keep
[699.92s] hitting the wall. Uh that&#39;s protecting
[702.0s] the moat and Tim Cook has done an
[703.6s] incredible job at protecting that moat.
[705.92s] Proctor and Gamble for years had moes
[708.0s] around Tide. That&#39;s been kind of diluted
[710.72s] a little bit with the Kirklands of the
[712.48s] world, etc. So, you have to constantly
[714.64s] be on top of the moat. You have to
[716.16s] constantly analyze the moat. But, uh,
[718.959s] but the key is to start with a business
[720.32s] that has a mode because if the mode is
[721.68s] there, you&#39;re marginous and you buy it
[723.2s] at the right time. If the mode is there,
[726.0s] uh, you can you can make it through
[727.68s] tougher times, the cyclical downturns,
[730.16s] and you come out stronger because in
[731.92s] cyclical downturns, the smaller players
[734.32s] with the weaker moes go out of business
[736.16s] and you pick up share. I want to get
[738.32s] back to a name you mentioned a couple
[739.839s] minutes ago, Stanley Black &amp; Decker,
[741.92s] because this hit my list Monday morning.
[743.68s] We had, and we&#39;re taping this the week
[745.6s] after the latest tariff dant, and um,
[748.32s] that morning I was looking pre-market at
[750.72s] all the companies in the S&amp;P 500, who
[752.56s] was leading. Stanley&#39;s at the top of the
[754.399s] list. It&#39;s like 12 15%. I hadn&#39;t looked
[756.32s] at this stock in years. What&#39;s going on
[758.16s] there? Uh they have an absolute moat and
[761.12s] they&#39;re highly correlated to the home
[763.6s] building industry. Okay. So they have
[766.32s] DeWalt. Okay. They have Stanley, they
[768.639s] have Craftsman, they have Black &amp;
[770.72s] Decker. So if you think about
[771.92s] construction, if you think about
[773.519s] projects, if you think about lower
[775.36s] interest rates, which spurs the the
[777.279s] former, uh uh it&#39;s a huge leverage play
[782.079s] on the recovery of construction, which
[784.24s] is going to h come in the back half of
[785.6s] the year. And that&#39;s the back half of
[787.12s] the show and the back half of the show.
[789.68s] Uh one of you know, everyone&#39;s focused
[791.839s] on the Fed. Uh what they need to be
[794.24s] focused on is what Besson is going to do
[796.88s] uh with capital requirements with banks,
[799.279s] the SLR. So he&#39;s going to and the SLR
[802.639s] the liquidity ratio. Exactly. So what
[806.24s] the the case they&#39;re making is
[808.24s] government backs stop securities i.e.
[810.24s] treasuries, mortgage back securities
[812.16s] shouldn&#39;t be counted differently because
[813.839s] there&#39;s no credit risk. And if they
[815.68s] agree to that, which is common sense
[817.279s] because if there becomes credit risk,
[818.639s] then we got a lot more to worry about
[819.92s] than bank capital ratios. Um that will
[823.36s] enable banks to hold a lot more. And
[824.88s] they&#39;re going to hold a ton on the short
[827.04s] end of the curve, which the Treasury
[829.92s] then can then use those proceeds. If you
[832.0s] remember 2012, I know Sydney&#39;s out. I
[834.48s] mean, this goes back to Basel 3. That&#39;s
[835.92s] what it I mean, doesn&#39;t this remind you
[837.279s] of Basel 3? No, it reminds me of Basel
[839.12s] 3. All right. We&#39;re on the same page.
[841.519s] So, so they can use those short-term
[842.959s] proceeds uh to reinvest on the long end
[845.68s] of the curve, which is expected to bring
[848.0s] 10-year treasuries down 30 to 70 basis
[850.639s] points, which means a 30-year fix for
[852.399s] the for the woman on the street. 30-year
[854.48s] fixed rate below six. When that happens,
[856.88s] boom times. Boom time. I We know that
[859.279s] President Trump wants lower mortgage
[861.199s] rates. And so part of that is I&#39;m asking
[863.519s] is that part of the Mara Lago accords?
[865.279s] Because there are more there&#39;s more to
[866.639s] it than just that there&#39;s other
[868.16s] countries buying US century bonds.
[870.16s] That&#39;s 100-year bonds to bring down
[872.0s] long-term interest rates. But I hadn&#39;t
[874.079s] really I I hadn&#39;t read that particular
[876.56s] facet before. So that&#39;s interesting.
[878.24s] Yeah. Uh the Mara Lago accord was was
[880.24s] predominantly uh rumored in the first
[883.12s] quarter of this year which was a
[884.32s] currency reset like you saw in Reagan&#39;s
[886.56s] second term. I I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s
[888.639s] fully on the table yet. Uh it&#39;s it&#39;s
[891.04s] implicitly on the table because as China
[893.199s] does a deal. So China knew the tariffs
[895.04s] were coming. So what did they do ahead
[896.399s] of time? They just devalued their
[897.839s] currency by 20%. Tariffs were kind of in
[900.56s] that same neighborhood. And as the deal
[902.399s] is set, part of the deal is going to be
[904.0s] get your currency back to normal. That
[905.839s] balances out trade. So there there&#39;s
[907.839s] implicit. Will there be an explicit
[909.6s] meeting where you have eight parties
[911.199s] together and they uniformly devalue the
[914.0s] dollar? Breton Woods. Exactly. Um uh
[917.68s] Plaza Accord. The answer is we don&#39;t
[920.399s] know. But the trend of the dollar is
[923.199s] right now you&#39;re going to have a counter
[924.399s] trend bounce because everyone was
[925.76s] bullish on the dollar. Now that the
[927.12s] dollar&#39;s fallen a lot, everyone&#39;s
[928.48s] bearish. So you get a count get a
[930.56s] counter trend uh bounce. But the trend
[932.959s] intermediate trend is down. That&#39;s going
[934.959s] to help earnings. that&#39;s going to help
[936.639s] all the things that we&#39;re talking about
[937.92s] here with everything going on right now.
[940.639s] We still don&#39;t have, you know, a lot of
[942.56s] solid trade deals. How are you thinking
[945.44s] about the market in terms of, you know,
[947.839s] companies with a moat in terms of
[949.759s] sectors? What do you like? Uh, you know,
[952.56s] we&#39;re seeing stocks come back to where
[954.399s] they were like a month ago before a lot
[956.32s] of this happened. 500 positive on the
[958.0s] Exactly. So, what what are you liking
[960.0s] right now as still as we&#39;re navigating
[961.839s] this uncertainty? Yeah, I think if you
[963.92s] look at equal weight versus cap weighted
[966.759s] S&amp;P, the valuation for equal weight is
[969.44s] one standard deviation below its
[971.12s] long-term average, which which in
[973.44s] English means it&#39;s cheap. Okay. On a
[975.36s] multiple basis, 493 is cheap. 493 is
[977.759s] cheap. So, you have to continue to look
[979.199s] there for the Stanley Black &amp; Deckers,
[981.199s] which are part of that 493. Uh I think
[983.6s] we&#39;re going to talk about a couple other
[985.04s] uh housing stocks as well. Um there&#39;s
[987.839s] just a lot to do. the the companies that
[989.759s] were most impacted by tariffs, which by
[993.759s] the way was Boeing, uh, or the fear of
[996.32s] the worst case, that&#39;s where you&#39;re
[997.759s] going to find your biggest opportunity.
[999.839s] I think the Mag 7 will rebound, a
[1002.959s] tradable rebound, but we can&#39;t overlook
[1005.68s] the fact that their earnings power has
[1008.16s] decelerated from 33% down to 16% and
[1011.519s] maybe a little bit lower. And that&#39;s
[1012.88s] part of the reason you&#39;ve seen what
[1014.16s] they&#39;ve done because when you think
[1015.199s] about tariffs, like how does that really
[1017.36s] affect Google when they&#39;re not in China,
[1019.839s] you know, uh, and so on. So, so they&#39;ve
[1022.399s] come down relative to their earnings
[1023.92s] power. The amount of capex that they
[1025.439s] have to spend to stay competitive to
[1027.28s] keep share has impacted their earnings
[1029.199s] has also crowded out their ability to
[1030.64s] buy back tons of stock. Uh, whereas the
[1032.88s] 493 announced record buybacks in the
[1036.079s] first quarter in the face of all this
[1037.439s] uncertainty, 665 billion. Um, talk to me
[1040.88s] about China real quick before we go to
[1042.64s] break. We&#39;ve talked about Alibaba in the
[1045.199s] la the last time we were here. That is,
[1047.12s] you know, it came up, it came down, but
[1048.96s] it&#39;s it&#39;s held on. What do you like
[1050.48s] about China now? Uh, what I like is that
[1055.08s] Xi after enough of social unrest and 25%
[1059.44s] uh youth unemployment got his act
[1061.28s] together about a year ago. Xi gets it.
[1064.0s] Xi Jinping got his act together. Uh, has
[1067.039s] done massive stimulus. he&#39;s now helping
[1068.88s] his country versus hurting his country,
[1070.64s] you know, soldering them in their
[1071.84s] apartments. That didn&#39;t work. Uh, and
[1074.0s] people got tired of it after 3 years.
[1075.76s] So, uh, you&#39;re seeing global M2 money
[1078.88s] supply start to hockey stick. And a good
[1081.36s] portion of global M2 money supply is
[1083.84s] China&#39;s new stimulus which started in
[1086.0s] the last 12 months. He&#39;s committed to
[1088.08s] taking the c country to 70% consumption
[1092.4s] like the rest of the developed world. Uh
[1095.12s] Alibaba&#39;s got 40% of the e-commerce
[1097.28s] market. They are a toll taker for
[1099.679s] domestic consumption. So they&#39;re going
[1101.36s] to benefit from that. They&#39;re going to
[1103.039s] benefit from being the number one player
[1104.96s] in AI. They have a piece of all the AI
[1107.12s] startups because as the number one cloud
[1108.88s] provider, new startup comes in, they
[1110.64s] say, &quot;We need compute power.&quot; They say,
[1112.4s] &quot;No problem. I got you covered. I&#39;ll
[1114.4s] give it to you for free.&quot; And we&#39;ll take
[1116.799s] a piece of your business and a peek at
[1118.24s] your business, too. We&#39;re going to take
[1119.44s] a peek and a piece. Uh we&#39;re going to
[1121.039s] get equity. So you have equity in all
[1122.88s] the Chinese AI startups. Some are going
[1124.64s] to be thousand baggers and some are
[1126.24s] going to be zeros. Uh Alibaba takes a
[1128.799s] piece. Alibaba takes a piece. It&#39;s the
[1130.88s] granddaddy. It&#39;s like the c It&#39;s like
[1132.48s] the casino owner versus the blackjack
[1134.559s] player. They get a piece of all the
[1136.08s] action on the retail on the AI and their
[1138.64s] models are outperforming Open AI. Their
[1140.799s] models are outperforming DeepSeek. Their
[1142.96s] international e-commerce is growing at
[1144.799s] 40%. They got $80 billion of cash on
[1147.2s] their balance sheet. They&#39;re generating
[1148.559s] $20 billion of free cash flow. What else
[1150.32s] do you want to know? Yeah, as long as
[1152.32s] Jack Ma doesn&#39;t get Mo Greens. Yeah,
[1154.4s] that&#39;s bad. Um, oh, and by the way, Ant
[1157.039s] Financial, the Chinese tech crisis
[1159.12s] started with the pulling of the Ant
[1160.76s] Financial, it was supposed to be the
[1162.48s] biggest IPO ever. It&#39;s going to happen
[1164.08s] in the next 12 months, and we own 35% of
[1166.48s] that as owners of Alibaba. We own the
[1169.2s] stock shares in Hong Kong, 9988. You can
[1172.72s] uh switch out your US shares if you&#39;re
[1174.559s] worried about D-listing. I think it&#39;s a
[1176.32s] lot of noise, but as a fiduciary, I want
[1178.64s] to protect my investors. Sure. Uh we own
[1181.44s] we still own derivatives in the US
[1183.12s] because we can&#39;t replicate them in Hong
[1184.64s] Kong and we&#39;re willing to assume that
[1186.16s] risk. Wait, how do you um how do you
[1188.559s] move shares from international to US
[1191.12s] listed? Depends on your uh custodian,
[1193.84s] but you can call them and they&#39;ll just
[1195.36s] swap out because there&#39;s no currency
[1196.72s] risk. It&#39;s 8 to1 peg to the dollar. So
[1198.559s] you&#39;ll get eight eight more shares per
[1200.799s] every one US ADR, but it&#39;s the effective
[1203.36s] same slice of the pie. All right, hold
[1205.6s] that thought. We need to take a short
[1206.799s] break. But coming up, we&#39;re going to be
[1208.4s] talking housing stocks again and a
[1210.32s] runway battle to turn heads as well as
[1213.08s] [Music]
[1219.72s] profits. This episode is brought to you
[1221.919s] by the number 7.5. That is the number of
[1224.64s] years that realtor.com estimates it&#39;s
[1227.12s] going to take America to build enough
[1228.96s] homes to fix the housing shortage. So,
[1231.28s] it&#39;s a big gap, Tom. And you say it&#39;s a
[1233.52s] big opportunity and I&#39;m wondering how
[1235.44s] you&#39;re screening for opportunities here.
[1237.12s] We already talked about Stanley and the
[1238.64s] mode and all that. What else you got?
[1240.72s] Well, look, when you have the gold rush,
[1242.32s] who made the most money? Was it the
[1243.679s] people looking at pigs and shovels,
[1245.36s] right? Uh in war, you don&#39;t want to be
[1247.6s] betting on the the waring factions. You
[1249.28s] want to be betting on the arms dealers.
[1250.72s] So, that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to be doing
[1251.919s] with the housing sector. So the DH uh
[1255.52s] the the Hortons, the uh the pties, the
[1258.24s] KB homes, all the home builders, it&#39;s
[1260.48s] going to be a race to the bottom because
[1261.76s] what&#39;s going to take place uh is a
[1263.84s] couple of things. One, number one, we&#39;re
[1265.679s] opening up federal land. Okay, we&#39;ve got
[1267.52s] hundreds of millions of acres if we open
[1269.679s] up uh like 1% of it will have enough
[1272.24s] land, it&#39;s like a half a million uh
[1275.12s] acres will be enough
[1277.08s] to enough land to bridge the deficit. 1%
[1280.96s] of the federal federally owned lands,
[1282.799s] which is a huge swath. Which is a huge
[1284.559s] swath. Okay. Uh so we&#39;re short four to 7
[1288.64s] million houses. Like you said, it&#39;s
[1290.24s] going to take 7.5 years to do that. Um
[1292.88s] and effectively what you&#39;re going to see
[1294.96s] is a race, a race by the home builders.
[1297.679s] I don&#39;t want to be in that race because
[1299.12s] once that happens, once supply picks up,
[1301.28s] it&#39;s a pricing compression. But if
[1303.76s] you&#39;re doing the builders, the tools for
[1305.52s] the builders, the Stanley Black &amp; Deck
[1307.039s] or the construction, the part suppliers
[1309.28s] like QXO, I think we&#39;re going to talk
[1310.96s] about or what goes outside now that you
[1312.72s] got the electrical grid down every
[1314.32s] single uh month or so in some of the
[1316.72s] hurricane ridden states. Uh and the
[1318.96s] demand on the power grid, which is an
[1320.559s] aging power grid, you need a generator.
[1322.32s] And if you need a generator, the Kleenex
[1324.0s] of generators is called Generex. 75% of
[1326.64s] the market, the game is just getting
[1328.32s] started there. So, those are our three
[1330.4s] arms dealers for home building. That&#39;s
[1333.12s] to to come in a massive scale in the
[1335.52s] next 3 to 5 years. Oh, and by the way,
[1337.44s] you got 72 million millennials, 45
[1339.919s] million people between age 30 and 40 who
[1342.32s] need homes. Sydney knows she&#39;s nodding
[1344.24s] in her head. Listen, it&#39;s like there
[1346.799s] it&#39;s like it feels like the American
[1348.24s] dream is slowly slipping away in that
[1350.24s] sense. I I have a question though. Do
[1351.84s] you recommend in terms of these kind of
[1353.28s] tool companies that you go straight for
[1355.2s] these single stock names or you go to
[1357.039s] like an ETF so you&#39;re just covering all
[1358.96s] your bases? Uh my clients pay me to
[1362.08s] outperform so I don&#39;t go to you&#39;re not
[1364.32s] going to an ETF.
[1366.799s] I mean you could you could buy XHP and
[1369.679s] participate uh uh in a beta sense but if
[1372.88s] you want an alpha sense you got to do
[1374.32s] some work and say where am I going to
[1376.08s] get the most return for the same amount
[1377.76s] of money. And that&#39;s what we try to do
[1379.039s] every single day when we get to work.
[1380.4s] And I love it. It&#39;s like a treasure hunt
[1381.76s] every single day. Said Warren Buffett.
[1383.76s] You mentioned a couple names. What&#39;s
[1385.039s] your favorite story of all the names
[1386.48s] that you&#39;ve ticked through so far? Uh my
[1388.48s] favorite jockey. I like to bet on
[1390.48s] jockeyies because I&#39;m turnaround Tom. Uh
[1392.96s] is uh Brad Jacobs. Okay. If you got QXO
[1397.2s] Brad Jacobs wrote a book called How to
[1399.36s] Make a Few Billion. It was a useful book
[1401.6s] because he actually made a few billion
[1403.12s] dollars. Um, if you got involved with
[1405.44s] him in 1997 when he invested in United
[1409.039s] Rentals, you made 79 times your money.
[1412.24s] So 1 million became 79. If you got
[1414.64s] involved when he put 150 million in XPO
[1417.679s] Logistics in 2009,
[1420.4s] uh, you made like 160 times your money.
[1422.72s] 1 million became 160 million. So now
[1424.799s] he&#39;s going to do the home building
[1426.88s] supply sector. He started with Beacon
[1429.2s] Roofing. Uh, this is a non-discretionary
[1431.679s] expense. Sydney, you&#39;ll figure this out
[1433.28s] when you get your starter home on
[1434.799s] federal land with an endangered elk in
[1436.799s] your backyard free of charge. That when
[1440.24s] your roof leaks, you don&#39;t think about
[1442.4s] should I buy it like you think about
[1443.84s] should I buy a pink iPhone or a white
[1445.52s] iPhone. You just call the person and you
[1447.2s] say fix it. I don&#39;t like water in my
[1448.799s] living room. So Beacon roofing is his
[1450.799s] first one. He paid 10 times IBIDA, a
[1452.64s] little bit rich, but he&#39;s going to
[1453.6s] double Ibida. Why? Because that&#39;s what
[1455.36s] Brad Jacobs does. He brings in
[1457.2s] technology. He creates efficiencies. He
[1459.679s] doubles IBIDA. That&#39;s his platform
[1461.84s] company. Then he&#39;s going to roll up 10%
[1464.0s] of the industry. It&#39;s an 800 billion
[1465.84s] dollar industry. He&#39;s going to get 50
[1467.279s] to$80 billion. How much is he now? Uh
[1469.6s] he&#39;s got 10 billion with Beacon. Okay.
[1471.279s] And this was just announced. So he&#39;s
[1472.799s] going to do another 78x. The stock is
[1474.96s] probably going to do another 10x the way
[1477.279s] because it doesn&#39;t account for the
[1478.72s] technology and the the special magic
[1480.4s] that Brad Jacobs makes. He&#39;s a money
[1482.24s] maker. This guy earns for his
[1484.24s] shareholders. And here&#39;s the beauty. He
[1485.76s] put 150 million in QXO. He just put a
[1488.32s] billion dollars of his own money in QXO.
[1491.36s] So in in XPO he put put 150. In this one
[1494.159s] he put a billion. Uh we think you know
[1496.96s] this is one you tuck away for 5 to seven
[1498.72s] years you probably wind up with a 678
[1500.64s] bagger from these levels. Kind of
[1502.159s] reminds me of Wayne Heisinga. Yeah.
[1504.08s] Yeah. Three companies in the Fortune 500
[1506.48s] over his lifetime which is substantial.
[1508.32s] Well and they were rollups by the way.
[1509.679s] And by the way wouldn&#39;t be surprised me.
[1512.159s] I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to get Brad on my
[1513.679s] podcast. uh if uh if that was a model
[1516.64s] name by the way. Uh it&#39;s called Hedge
[1517.84s] Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. It&#39;s number
[1519.6s] one in the hedge fund category which is
[1521.679s] the narrow niche, but we&#39;ve been doing
[1523.44s] it for 5 years and people seem to like
[1525.12s] it. Tom, I need a I need an invitation
[1527.36s] over here. Oh, you can come on anytime
[1529.2s] you want. Yeah, come on. Hedge funds. I
[1532.0s] have I have a different question for
[1533.36s] you. Are you invested in REITs? And I&#39;m
[1536.24s] going to define that for anyone who
[1537.6s] doesn&#39;t know. REITs are real estate
[1539.44s] investment trusts companies that own,
[1541.44s] operate, or finance income producing
[1543.84s] real estate. Yes, we own one REIT. It&#39;s
[1546.64s] called Crown Castle. They&#39;re one of the
[1548.4s] biggest uh owners of cell phone towers.
[1551.76s] They just sold off their fiber business.
[1553.44s] They got uh billions of dollars for
[1555.36s] that. They use that to pay down debt.
[1557.12s] They have the legacy 40,000 towers that
[1559.44s] are just cash machines. Basically
[1561.039s] require no uh maintenance. It&#39;s like an
[1563.44s] owning an ATM. Every time someone use
[1565.039s] it, you make a fee. It&#39;s the exact same
[1567.12s] thing with these towers. So now it&#39;s
[1568.559s] just going to be a cash machine. They&#39;ll
[1570.4s] buy back shares. They&#39;ll buy more legacy
[1572.32s] type towers and uh and these tend to be
[1574.799s] interest rate sensitive. So when rates
[1576.4s] come down, as we said, Besson&#39;s going to
[1578.0s] work his magic the second half. REITs
[1580.08s] will go up. Crown Castle will be a
[1581.679s] beneficiary. As far as real estate
[1583.6s] rates, uh there are none at attractive
[1586.96s] enough levels at this juncture. We we
[1589.36s] were big buyers of Vornnado in the hole
[1591.039s] if you remember during that big uh mini
[1593.2s] banking crisis. We thought it would take
[1595.12s] three years to double. Uh it took six
[1597.44s] months to double and we got out. So uh
[1599.44s] that one sometimes they take longer than
[1601.12s] expected like Alibaba. Sometimes they
[1603.2s] happen faster than expected like
[1604.559s] Vornnado. But uh the key is the
[1606.88s] framework is sound. Does the business
[1608.96s] have a moat? And are we buying it with a
[1610.559s] large enough margin to safety? All
[1612.32s] right. We&#39;re going to stick with the
[1613.84s] entrepreneurial vibe here because
[1615.44s] today&#39;s runway showdown is all about
[1617.6s] valuedriven CEOs. Two chiefs struting
[1620.24s] the catwalk with distinct approaches to
[1622.32s] turning opportunity into profit. First
[1624.799s] down the runway is the serial
[1626.48s] entrepreneur dressed in relaxed business
[1628.72s] casual, confidently investing in under
[1631.039s] the radar cash flowing small businesses
[1633.52s] like storage units and car washes.
[1635.84s] Quiet, consistent, and profitable. Close
[1638.48s] behind though is the turnaround
[1639.919s] specialist, sleeves rolled up, toolkit
[1641.76s] ready, eager to repair and revive
[1643.6s] neglected industrials, retailers, and
[1645.799s] manufacturers. Tom, which value pays off
[1648.4s] more reliably, the steady entrepreneur
[1650.72s] building a portfolio from the ground up
[1652.88s] or the specialist who sees gold where
[1654.72s] others only see rust? Well, I think it&#39;s
[1657.6s] I think it&#39;s a question of scale, right?
[1659.36s] You can make a tremendous amount of
[1660.799s] money buying uh small um businesses that
[1665.44s] are kind of defra fragmented businesses.
[1668.48s] Roll them up, get synergies. Uh whether
[1670.96s] you do it with car washes, whether you
[1672.32s] do it with laundromats, etc. Uh people
[1674.48s] do that. But if you want scale and you
[1677.52s] want control of capital, you need to be
[1679.36s] in bigger businesses. And that&#39;s what we
[1681.12s] try to do in the public markets. Uh the
[1683.36s] beauty, you know, I get approached with
[1685.12s] private deals all the time. And there
[1686.399s] are plenty of private deals. Most of
[1687.6s] them are betting on the future. You
[1689.039s] know, we&#39;re guessing who&#39;s going to cure
[1690.32s] cancer, who&#39;s going to be the AI leader.
[1692.08s] I don&#39;t like to guess on the future. I
[1693.6s] like to bet on sure things, okay? And I
[1695.6s] want a business that&#39;s I&#39;m like Gordon
[1696.96s] Gecko.
[1698.64s] I want to bet on businesses that have
[1701.12s] operated through many cycles, many
[1703.12s] downturns, and operated through and have
[1704.96s] a big enough moat, a strong enough
[1706.72s] balance sheet that I know they&#39;re going
[1708.0s] to recover just back to the mean. They
[1709.679s] don&#39;t need to be a home run. Doubles or
[1711.36s] triples over two to three years. and you
[1713.279s] compound that with large amounts of
[1715.2s] capital, it beats, you know, grinding
[1717.679s] and and and uh getting synergies from a
[1720.399s] handful of laundromats or orever as an
[1722.6s] entrepreneur. Um, but I will say Brad
[1726.48s] Jacobs does a combination of that. So,
[1728.32s] he has his platform company. He gets the
[1730.32s] public market multiple. you get a higher
[1733.039s] multiple in the public markets and then
[1734.88s] he uses that currency and his ability to
[1736.96s] raise capital in in public markets to
[1739.919s] buy defragmented businesses, smaller
[1742.399s] scale businesses and tuck them into his
[1744.24s] platform company and that&#39;s how he&#39;s
[1746.0s] created so much wealth for so many
[1747.36s] people over the years. That&#39;s great.
[1749.279s] Tom, I want to switch gears here a
[1751.12s] little more personal and advice driven.
[1753.2s] Okay, so you study the markets kind of
[1755.52s] day in and day out. I want you to share
[1758.159s] with me with us. Yeah. Like what&#39;s the
[1760.72s] one thing that you think that everyone
[1763.279s] needs to know about the market that
[1765.6s] either they&#39;re misunderstanding or is
[1767.919s] sometimes misrepresented?
[1770.559s] I think the number one thing like
[1772.48s] anything in life is to be consistent. So
[1774.88s] if you&#39;re just buying the overall
[1776.64s] indices like a VTI, Vanguard total
[1779.679s] market uh or an S&amp;P 500, buy it every
[1783.44s] single month a fixed amount. Okay? And
[1785.44s] the months that you really don&#39;t want to
[1787.039s] buy it, where your stomach is
[1788.08s] turnurning, you&#39;re afraid you&#39;re going
[1789.039s] to lose your job, whatever it happens to
[1790.559s] be, those are the months you should buy
[1791.84s] double because uh when you buy down, you
[1794.559s] get more shares and over time that
[1796.48s] compounds materially. So dollar cost
[1798.24s] averaging, that&#39;s kind of your base. You
[1800.159s] know, put the majority of your money to
[1802.32s] compound that way. And then when you
[1803.679s] have excess wealth, you start to take
[1805.44s] some of that and you want it to be a
[1806.799s] little bit more aggressive and you put
[1808.159s] it in different buckets and you hire
[1809.919s] different managers like Tom Hayes, you
[1811.84s] hire uh uh you know maybe a private
[1814.399s] equity manager, maybe maybe a venture
[1816.799s] capital fund, etc. Uh and you diversify
[1819.44s] with that excess. But start with the
[1820.799s] basics. Get the compounding machine
[1822.399s] going because it&#39;s the eighth wonder of
[1824.08s] the world. Uh and um it&#39;s it&#39;s created
[1826.88s] more wealth. This beautiful amazing the
[1829.76s] ninth wonder right here behind us.
[1831.6s] Exactly. Guess what? That is all the
[1833.039s] time we have. Really appreciate you
[1834.32s] stopping by. And this will do it for
[1835.919s] this latest episode of Stocks in
[1837.679s] Translation.
[1841.679s] And we&#39;re back. And then I had the
[1844.399s] pleasure to I don&#39;t know how they got my
[1846.799s] number. Uh it uh Bloomberg Dubai reached
[1852.0s] out to me on LinkedIn literally a day or
[1855.44s] two after I landed and asked me to go on
[1857.52s] Bloomberg Dubai. And I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, I
[1858.96s] was just in your city. I would have been
[1860.24s] happy to do it in person. So, I did did
[1862.48s] the remote interview. Unfortunately,
[1864.48s] we&#39;re not going to play it because
[1866.0s] little did I know the interview was in
[1869.12s] Arabic. Uh, so I&#39;m joking with all my
[1872.24s] friends and saying, you know, one week
[1874.24s] in Dubai and I already speak Arabic. So,
[1876.08s] they gave me the questions in English
[1877.919s] and apparently as I was talking, they
[1880.32s] talk over you in Arabic for the local
[1882.72s] audience. And um, and that was that. But
[1885.52s] that was a fun experience. Then I want
[1887.679s] to thank Chabuk Ou for having me in his
[1889.919s] Reuters article this week and the quotes
[1892.88s] of the week. Know what you own and know
[1896.399s] why you own it. Peter Lynn and this was
[1900.08s] a great example we have seen. It&#39;s so
[1902.399s] interesting. So many people I think got
[1904.96s] shaken out that maybe bought Boeing at
[1907.519s] 150 and got shaken out last month when
[1909.36s] it went to 129 and we were on Varnney
[1912.64s] saying bye bye bye like crazy and
[1914.88s] loading the boat with options and
[1916.64s] spreads and all the different things.
[1918.64s] Well the stock has moved now almost you
[1921.6s] know it&#39;s moved 80 points 80 plus points
[1924.399s] got up to like 85 points in a matter of
[1926.64s] four weeks. Many of those options were
[1928.72s] up many multiples uh serious amounts of
[1931.6s] money in short period of time. Uh we
[1933.84s] actually harvested millions upon
[1935.44s] millions of dollars of options in uh
[1937.679s] Boeing today, this morning into
[1940.799s] strength. We sell into strength. We buy
[1943.12s] into weakness. Uh however, we have not
[1946.399s] sold one single share of Boeing. Okay,
[1950.24s] that is a long-term holding for us. We
[1952.72s] do think it&#39;s moved very far very very
[1955.679s] quickly and we wanted to lock in some of
[1957.44s] those profits. Um uh you can joke in
[1960.64s] coming weeks when it keeps going higher
[1962.32s] and say Tom got it wrong. But uh the
[1965.2s] clients who saw the amount of multiples
[1967.76s] on those options will say I&#39;m so glad he
[1970.24s] took profits. So uh there we go. But we
[1974.159s] we no change in view. It&#39;s just at some
[1976.48s] point you got to ring the register. And
[1978.64s] uh that was just a lot of money money in
[1981.039s] a very very short period of time. So uh
[1984.08s] Charlie Mer, it&#39;s remarkable how much
[1986.08s] long-term advantage people like us have
[1988.96s] gotten by trying to be consistently not
[1992.2s] stupid instead of trying to be very
[1995.399s] intelligent. And you know, I look at
[1997.519s] some of the questions that come in and
[1998.96s] we&#39;ve got a lot of great AMAs this week.
[2001.6s] Um and uh this is a mug from my friends.
[2004.559s] Thank you very much. Love this. my
[2006.159s] favorite color, by the way, other than
[2007.679s] of course hedge fund tips black.
[2013.519s] But
[2015.24s] um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s I
[2019.64s] think you know it goes back to Buffett
[2022.0s] saying about how sometimes the 130 IQ
[2024.24s] crushes the 160 because the 160 focused
[2026.96s] on so many unimportant factors and all
[2029.279s] these different variations and
[2030.679s] secondguing and if you get to you know
[2033.44s] kind of first principles what are the
[2035.36s] two or three things that may make 80% of
[2037.6s] the difference with any investment
[2039.519s] opportunity and any particular theme
[2041.44s] that you&#39;re in and you stick to it and
[2043.44s] you know what you own. It&#39;s really just
[2045.679s] avoiding the stupid things, chasing the
[2047.84s] shiny objects where you&#39;re going to get
[2049.2s] that outperformance over uh a reasonable
[2052.159s] amount of time. And um and that&#39;s what
[2054.72s] this is all about is is trying to uh
[2057.2s] avoid stupid things and and uh basic
[2060.8s] things, things that you can understand
[2062.8s] that have durable modes that you can buy
[2064.639s] them when they&#39;re down. And this is uh
[2066.879s] speaking segue right into Benjamin
[2068.96s] Graham. great company is not a great
[2071.28s] investment if you take pay too much for
[2073.919s] the stock. Okay? Uh you know buying
[2077.44s] Boeing at 211 still a great investment a
[2080.639s] lot different than buying it at 150 or
[2082.56s] 160 uh but it still has a lot of upside
[2085.52s] in it.
[2086.76s] So it&#39;s
[2090.04s] um you know it it&#39;s just getting great
[2093.919s] businesses when people are panicking.
[2095.599s] You know, it&#39;s it, you know, right now
[2096.96s] what&#39;s super exciting, I keep getting
[2098.8s] all these texts from literally people I
[2101.44s] golf with like, what about SMR and all
[2104.64s] this stuff because Nuclear was in the
[2106.32s] news this week and look, we played we
[2109.52s] had a derivative play and a multibagger
[2111.599s] in
[2112.68s] Rolls-Royce Holdings. They had SMRs. We
[2115.76s] were playing the engine servicing uh
[2117.44s] hours and got a multibagger in that
[2119.119s] quicker than we thought. Sold a little
[2121.52s] early, but you know, we&#39;re not
[2123.68s] complaining. Uh, that one was a good one
[2126.16s] and a quick one. Um, but that&#39;s, you
[2129.359s] know, that&#39;s 10 years off. So, the
[2131.839s] simple answer to everyone getting all
[2133.28s] hyped up about nuclear because why it
[2135.2s] was in the headlines this week, uh, is
[2138.079s] when everyone stops talking about
[2140.16s] nuclear again in three or four months,
[2143.28s] uh, you look amongst the rubble and you
[2144.96s] see what makes sense for the next five
[2146.48s] years. And, and that&#39;s really the way
[2148.32s] that you you want to look think about
[2150.8s] these things. Here&#39;s some sloomer notes.
[2157.8s] Um, okay. Here&#39;s the S&amp;P
[2162.04s] 500. You know, it&#39;s it could be up
[2164.88s] against resistance here. But on the flip
[2166.88s] side, you look at some of this
[2169.64s] and this this has upside and it&#39;s hard
[2172.8s] to say that uh when you look at the
[2175.52s] fundamentals, it&#39;s trading at 21 times,
[2178.16s] 12 month, 19 times forward, but I think
[2182.48s] that guidance is a little light because
[2184.4s] of the tariff uncertainty and we&#39;re
[2185.92s] going to get some real resolution in
[2187.92s] four weeks or less. Number one, you had
[2189.839s] the vote yesterday or the the the courts
[2192.8s] rule it illegal. um that will be
[2195.359s] overturned. I I think what people
[2197.04s] underestimate is, you know, most people
[2199.359s] spend their life trying to avoid winding
[2201.44s] up in a courtroom. Donald Trump uh uh
[2204.48s] has basically uh built a career out of
[2208.0s] winning in courtrooms. I mean, for the
[2210.0s] most part, he embraces going to court
[2213.68s] and uh loves to slug it out and loves
[2216.72s] long-term uncertainty, the exact
[2219.44s] opposite of most of mo any uh rational
[2222.32s] counterparty. So, I I wouldn&#39;t bet
[2224.96s] against him on this getting it
[2226.4s] overturned, but there&#39;s something here
[2228.88s] from a technical perspective, and I
[2230.72s] don&#39;t want to put a lot of weight on
[2231.839s] that. That just looks like this thing
[2233.52s] wants to push higher, even if in the
[2235.28s] short term we got to consolidate in this
[2237.119s] range uh for a little bit and maybe
[2240.24s] maybe check back. But, uh I think I
[2243.92s] think as we get resolution, estimates
[2245.839s] are going to start going up and and
[2247.359s] people are going to be surprised. And
[2248.56s] then you got all these poor bastards
[2250.16s] that were shorting down here and sold in
[2252.48s] the whole record for hedge funds and
[2254.32s] CTAs. It&#39;s it&#39;s uh you know and and we
[2258.48s] we did just get this kind of like
[2261.2s] pullback
[2262.8s] uh on the
[2263.96s] daily
[2266.599s] here. On the weekly, it looks like we
[2270.16s] could have some more upside. So yes,
[2272.079s] things that have gone and made us an
[2274.24s] enormous amount of money in a short
[2275.599s] period of time like those options uh for
[2278.0s] for for one. We did harvest some
[2280.16s] profits. Now we&#39;re sitting on some cash
[2282.68s] because they made so many multiples. Uh
[2286.0s] but we&#39;ll find things to do right now. I
[2288.079s] mean there there I I don&#39;t think we
[2290.32s] going to have to wait a lot. You know,
[2291.68s] you look at small caps, there&#39;s a ton to
[2293.359s] do there. Uh you look at sentiment is
[2295.68s] not fully stretched. I I do think we
[2297.359s] push higher and I do think we&#39;re going
[2298.64s] to get that money to work uh very very
[2300.88s] quickly. It&#39;s there&#39;s no problem putting
[2302.56s] new money to work uh in in some of these
[2305.28s] pockets that we love that uh are just
[2307.76s] now starting to take off. Uh MCI Europe,
[2312.32s] UK, I
[2317.4s] mean Tokyo&#39;s kind of been sideways
[2320.839s] for a year and a half now.
[2325.28s] Hang Sang is recovering here. A little
[2328.32s] bit of chop the last few days or so, but
[2331.599s] the direction is up. We&#39;re going to
[2333.68s] share a chart in our uh pod charts this
[2336.96s] week that&#39;s going to blow your mind in
[2338.4s] terms of multiples, in terms of growth
[2340.16s] estimates, etc. 30-year yield went back
[2342.88s] to the top of the range. We&#39;re not
[2344.32s] worried about that. We discussed the SLR
[2346.24s] with the Yahoo
[2348.44s] segment. 10-year yield, middle of the
[2350.64s] range. This is going down this summer
[2352.48s] with the SLR. probably back to the
[2354.64s] bottom end of the range if not break
[2356.56s] through but definitely I think we could
[2358.72s] see 375 360 which means 5.9% mortgage
[2362.64s] which means off to the races on the
[2364.16s] housing theme uh next year. So here
[2366.8s] we&#39;re up to this resistance level on the
[2368.64s] 10-year yield. Maybe it goes to the top
[2371.04s] again. I doubt it. Uh I think we&#39;re I
[2374.24s] think we&#39;re a little overbought there on
[2375.839s] yields. Dollar index well down to the
[2378.64s] bottom of the range. Do we break down to
[2380.64s] 95 or do we have a counter trend bounce
[2382.88s] up here? I don&#39;t know. But we did get
[2385.04s] that minor counter trend that we were
[2386.56s] looking at and started to roll back
[2388.0s] over. Maybe we finally break through.
[2390.079s] That&#39;s going to help earnings in the
[2391.2s] second half. Going to help international
[2393.2s] uh going to help China, etc. Euro, look
[2395.839s] at this. This was on no one&#39;s bingo card
[2398.0s] except for the loyal, incredible,
[2399.599s] amazing listeners and clients uh of the
[2402.64s] podcast. Very excited for you. Uh euros
[2406.64s] is moving, man. Uh, Canadian dollar, how
[2409.52s] you doing, Looney? Uh, may maybe we&#39;re
[2412.079s] going to be your uh uh Trump keeps
[2414.96s] saying uh Canada, our 51st state. Maybe
[2418.32s] we&#39;ll be uh Canada&#39;s uh
[2422.76s] um second through 51st uh um province.
[2428.72s] Who knows? Uh it&#39;s not the right way to
[2431.44s] say it, but you get the point. I&#39;m
[2433.2s] joking. Uh okay. Then we got uh the
[2436.64s] commodity index kind of flatlining
[2438.88s] there. This is it&#39;s good to go through
[2440.72s] some gold. It looks like it&#39;s topped in
[2442.64s] the short
[2443.48s] term. It&#39;s good to go through these. Dr.
[2446.0s] Copper kind of gives us an indication of
[2447.92s] China starting to recover here. Copper
[2450.24s] has a PhD in economics as it relates to
[2452.32s] the economy. It&#39;s going up. The economy
[2454.96s] is recovering. That&#39;s largely driven by
[2456.64s] China. A lot of voices saying crude
[2460.359s] going excuse me below
[2462.92s] 50. Um, we&#39;ll look at some of this. I
[2467.04s] again, I think there&#39;s stuff to do in
[2468.88s] the energy space. I mean, comtock keeps
[2470.8s] going up. That&#39;s our exposure. Uh,
[2473.04s] that&#39;s been a
[2475.56s] now 300%. Let&#39;s see. Nine. So, between 8
[2480.8s] and 9 and it&#39;s at 25 now. So, three plus
[2485.599s] bagger in a short period of time.
[2487.839s] That&#39;ll probably check back a little
[2489.44s] bit, but it&#39;s going higher.
[2493.68s] So, we love our multiaggers, whether
[2496.2s] they&#39;re options or
[2498.839s] stocks, and we like them better in
[2501.04s] stocks because then the options are
[2502.72s] multi multis. Uh
[2505.4s] crude, it looks like it&#39;s trying to put
[2507.68s] in a bottom
[2510.04s] here. I&#39;m happy with just having com,
[2513.04s] but uh we&#39;ve got some AMA questions
[2515.52s] about servicesers that I like. We
[2517.599s] haven&#39;t pulled the trigger on any of
[2519.04s] them.
[2521.88s] Um, see any of these other
[2525.16s] names. Nvidia will be be back up to the
[2528.24s] top of the range there. I think they&#39;re
[2530.48s] going to be rangebound for a little
[2531.76s] while because with, you know, the the
[2534.079s] key thing with Nvidia is not a demand
[2536.8s] problem. It&#39;s a supply problem. And I I
[2538.48s] went into a lot of detail on it on the
[2540.4s] Arabic call. So, if you speak Arabic,
[2543.2s] uh, check that out.
[2546.56s] But the
[2548.359s] excess supply capacity from TSMC and
[2552.4s] possibly Intel uh I I would say
[2555.2s] probably, but let&#39;s just say possibly uh
[2558.079s] won&#39;t be online until mid of 2026. So,
[2560.8s] they&#39;re going to be stuck at plus 4
[2562.079s] billion revenues a quarter, which is
[2563.44s] going to bring their revenue growth rate
[2564.8s] down from a peak of 400% down to below
[2568.079s] 50%. the multiple will probably get down
[2570.72s] to the low 20s before mid next year uh
[2574.16s] which might actually be a time to buy it
[2577.04s] uh before that excess supply comes on
[2579.2s] and they can really juice the earnings.
[2582.079s] Uh looks like some of these
[2583.52s] semiconductors are wanting to
[2586.52s] bottom. The Mag 7 has kind of been stuck
[2589.44s] here. Apple stuck in the range. Google
[2592.64s] and we we&#39;ve said that you know the
[2595.04s] earnings growth has decelerated in
[2596.96s] those. I think they probably trade back
[2598.8s] to the top of the range into midsummer
[2601.44s] and then uh and then we&#39;ll have some
[2603.28s] profit taking. Uh what else do we like
[2610.04s] here? Consumer discretionary is a spot
[2612.8s] to start to look. Consumer
[2615.079s] confidence has come back. We saw the
[2617.44s] numbers last
[2619.24s] week. Couple staples. Colgate might be
[2622.24s] worth taking a quick look at. Lot of lot
[2625.76s] of amazing things still to do. I got to
[2628.079s] take a look at
[2631.4s] Amgen. What else we got? Uh these are
[2634.96s] Canadian
[2638.599s] banks. I just don&#39;t feel like a lot of
[2640.88s] these EMP companies. If you look at
[2643.44s] Suncor, they just haven&#39;t come down
[2645.28s] relative to the price of the commodity.
[2647.119s] So, I don&#39;t get the leverage on the ups
[2648.72s] if the price goes back up. That&#39;s why I
[2650.48s] loved Comtock so much. Uh let&#39;s take a
[2654.4s] look at 30-year yield and 10-year. We
[2657.359s] talked about
[2658.68s] that weekly chart. Dollar looks like
[2661.839s] it&#39;s breaking down. There was the
[2663.359s] counter trend rally we were telling you
[2665.04s] is going to happen. It happened. Now it
[2667.52s] looks like it&#39;s breaking down. That will
[2668.88s] be good for earnings the second half.
[2670.72s] Let&#39;s see. Albamaro. This is from
[2673.92s] Morning Star put this out a couple days
[2676.88s] ago uh with a fair value estimate of
[2680.24s] $200. If you sleep on Albamaro, I really
[2683.68s] feel sorry for you. I think this is
[2685.599s] going to be a big name. We&#39;ve talked
[2686.88s] about it. It&#39;s a dividend aristocrat.
[2689.119s] It&#39;s raised the dividend every year for
[2691.119s] the last 30 years throughout all the
[2693.839s] normal cyclical peaks and troughs of the
[2697.44s] lithium price cycle. Supply demand is
[2700.88s] expected to we had thought mid 2026. I
[2704.079s] think this note is calling for it to
[2706.88s] even happen sooner. uh you know this is
[2710.8s] like if if everything goes wrong in our
[2712.88s] view again all this is opinion not
[2714.96s] advice do your own research consult your
[2717.119s] advisor click on terms on hedge
[2719.359s] funips.com
[2721.359s] um but um you know I if we&#39;re wrong
[2725.2s] about this we think it&#39;s a double if
[2726.72s] we&#39;re right this could be uh you know 34
[2730.48s] bagger from here with you know options
[2732.72s] doing 5x plus and all kinds of good
[2735.52s] stuff so um so that&#39;s that. Let&#39;s get
[2740.079s] down to our data of the week. I was
[2742.48s] talking to some friends and um I just
[2746.079s] said don&#39;t count Lip Bhan out. This is
[2748.96s] not a guy you want to bet against. You
[2751.119s] know, if we&#39;re wrong on the fab business
[2752.88s] and he totally screws it up, we&#39;ll still
[2754.64s] get a double on the legacy business. And
[2757.04s] if we&#39;re right, I mean, this guy got in
[2760.16s] uh Cadence Designs. Look at Cadence. is
[2763.119s] a really
[2764.68s] interesting software design uh
[2767.52s] semiconductor software
[2771.16s] design software used to design
[2773.8s] semiconductors and the stock had been
[2776.0s] basically dead money
[2778.2s] for 15 years when he got involved except
[2782.319s] it had fallen 90% right before he got
[2784.88s] involved. So dead money and a 90% drop.
[2788.56s] You know, not dissimilar from
[2794.52s] Intel. Intel has been dead money for 25
[2798.64s] years. Okay, it&#39;s the same price it was
[2801.2s] in 2000. Uh it&#39;s dropped from a recent
[2806.0s] peak of about 75%. Lip Bhutan&#39;s getting
[2809.28s] involved. when he did it with Cadence
[2812.319s] uh the stock was a 100 bagger over the
[2815.64s] next 24 years I&#39;m sorry over the next 14
[2820.079s] years rather from 2009 to 2023 100
[2823.119s] baggers so if you put in a million bucks
[2824.48s] you made 100 million bucks that&#39;s not
[2825.76s] going to happen in Intel but I do think
[2829.359s] if we&#39;re if he gets the fabs right and
[2831.92s] catches a couple lucky breaks which this
[2833.92s] guy has a tendency to do I do think it
[2836.079s] could be a four or five bagger and your
[2838.16s] downside&#39;s largely predicted if they
[2839.92s] liquidated the whole thing today.
[2841.44s] Trading at about book. Uh I kind of like
[2845.119s] it. I love betting on the right
[2846.72s] jockeyies and we&#39;ll talk a little bit
[2848.079s] about VFC Corp
[2849.64s] today. New vehicle sales forecast for
[2852.24s] April. The headline for this was like,
[2853.68s] &quot;Oh, it&#39;s going to be terrible.&quot; Look,
[2856.92s] sequentially they&#39;re expecting it to be
[2859.119s] down month after a record pull forward
[2862.56s] from tariffs in March. But that&#39;s not
[2865.119s] the right way to measure it. The right
[2866.72s] way to measure it is to look at April
[2868.4s] 2024 to April 2025. And April 2024 was
[2872.56s] pretty good and we&#39;re going to be up on
[2875.119s] April
[2876.2s] 2024 even after we up
[2880.04s] 4.6% even after h pulling forward a
[2884.48s] couple hundred,000 vehicles in March uh
[2887.44s] to uh you know did 1.58 in March. So you
[2890.8s] can say, oh, they&#39;re down 12% month-
[2893.119s] on-month, but they they pulled forward a
[2895.28s] few hundred grand and they&#39;re still up
[2897.119s] yearon year. So it shows the underlying
[2899.44s] strength of demand. This is the
[2901.44s] multiples. These are uh companies uh
[2904.88s] friends friends in Dubai sent over uh uh
[2907.52s] from a Chinese sellside
[2909.64s] bank all major kind of discretionary
[2912.64s] companies in China and
[2917.16s] their PE on forward earnings and you
[2920.88s] could see here all of these companies
[2924.839s] Alibaba you know Maitan has a low PE
[2927.72s] pendu duo but Pendu is a train wreck
[2930.319s] that was down big this week we had told
[2932.24s] you for a year that their numbers were
[2934.24s] either unreliable or unsustainable. That
[2936.48s] proved to be true this week. Uh but Bob
[2938.8s] has a nine times 2026 earnings. I mean
[2941.359s] with with low double digit earnings
[2944.48s] growth, all the outs that we&#39;ve talked
[2946.319s] about, this is just unbelievable. Um so
[2949.599s] cheap market, cheapest in the market
[2951.599s] with accelerating earnings growth, top a
[2954.559s] cheapest AI play, most advanced lang
[2956.72s] large language model, uh leader in
[2959.2s] cloud, leader in middle class uh
[2962.359s] recovery and China&#39;s government now was
[2965.359s] a headwind is now a massive tailwind.
[2967.2s] and they want to get everyone spending
[2968.559s] their $20 trillion of savings. And if
[2970.8s] they all start consuming, uh, Alibaba
[2973.2s] picks up 40 cents of every dollar spent
[2975.68s] on e-commerce in China. It is a toll
[2978.28s] taker. Inbound foreign visitors
[2980.72s] recovered to
[2982.359s] 84.5% of the 2019 level last year. uh in
[2987.8s] China you can see
[2990.44s] here this
[2992.599s] is staples are resilient discretionary
[2996.079s] is still a little bit weak but the
[2997.44s] government&#39;s working on that real estate
[3000.16s] trading goods drive growth uh so they&#39;ve
[3003.359s] had the vouchers etc so you see office
[3006.359s] appliances cultural and office
[3008.24s] appliances
[3010.76s] up first quarter of
[3014.2s] 2025 over first quarter of 2024 big
[3017.44s] time. Sports and recreational articles
[3019.44s] up big 25% telecom equipment up big 26%
[3025.2s] furniture up
[3027.079s] 18% appliances and audio video up 19%.
[3030.8s] So the government stimulus and vouchers
[3033.119s] are starting to work to spur
[3034.72s] consumption. It&#39;s early days and uh
[3037.76s] Alibaba is going to get the bulk of
[3039.44s] that. S&amp;P 500 debt at record lows. This
[3043.2s] chart blew my mind. Government debt is
[3045.839s] at record highs. US debt to GDP uh
[3050.68s] 120%. S&amp;P net debt to market cap is at
[3055.88s] 10%. Down from its peak before the great
[3059.359s] financial crisis at 65%. Look at this
[3062.88s] ladies and gentlemen. They have so much
[3065.28s] room to lever up. It&#39;s insane. And when
[3067.68s] Bessant gives him the green light this
[3069.359s] summer with the SLR and brings rates
[3071.68s] down, you are going to see uh huge huge
[3076.2s] refinancings, borrowings, deals,
[3078.72s] everything happen all at
[3083.4s] once. US
[3085.48s] equities rolling 10-year return now 13%
[3089.119s] was negative -3% in
[3091.24s] 2009. So we can stay up at these levels
[3094.24s] for a pronounced period of time. Uh in
[3097.04s] this case it was about 20 years once it
[3100.16s] got up to that level from 46 to looks
[3102.88s] like about early 60s. Then from
[3106.52s] 85
[3108.119s] through
[3110.119s] 2003 and then we just got up there in
[3112.559s] like
[3113.88s] 200 18. Probably goes for another five,
[3117.76s] six years. Uh and that&#39;s just the way
[3120.4s] the cycle goes. Um, you could see here
[3122.8s] in the total asset class quilt of
[3126.04s] returns, gold has had two strong years.
[3130.24s] I wouldn&#39;t count on that recurring. The
[3132.559s] last two last time you had gold do this
[3134.72s] well two years in a row was 2010. In
[3137.599s] 2011, the following year it dropped to
[3141.52s] the bottom of the quilt. And then the
[3143.2s] year after that in 2013, it was the
[3145.92s] worst performer with negative 27%.
[3149.119s] So, um, uh, everyone&#39;s asking me about
[3152.72s] gold. It&#39;s the time to be probably
[3155.04s] taking some profits off the table. XLV,
[3158.319s] healthc care versus S&amp;P 500 since Trump
[3160.96s] election. Uh, you can see here, huge
[3164.88s] draw down in healthcare. I think that&#39;s
[3167.52s] probably going to be the new area of
[3169.68s] huge opportunity relative to risk. Uh so
[3173.04s] we currently have exposure to that
[3174.96s] through
[3176.48s] um the biotech basket of biotech with
[3179.119s] the XBI that will be doing starting to
[3182.64s] recover massively as it did in uh Trump
[3186.52s] 1.0 and
[3189.72s] um a few other Baxter I think some of
[3192.8s] these medical device are going to
[3194.16s] finally start to catch a bid after all
[3196.0s] the smoke clears.
[3199.0s] Uh here is housing
[3203.319s] forecasting average annual starts to 1.5
[3206.24s] million this decade. So you can see it
[3209.04s] has been clawing back got hurt a little
[3211.839s] bit and now is reacelerating. That&#39;s
[3213.599s] going to help our Stanley Black &amp; Decker
[3216.64s] Generrack and um QXO themes. QXO is up a
[3220.8s] lot in a short period of time early
[3223.44s] basis $13. I think it got up to 17 or 18
[3227.2s] already and and the story is just
[3229.119s] getting started. So that&#39;s moved a lot
[3230.72s] in a short period of time. Earnings
[3232.72s] resilience supports V-shaped recovery.
[3235.68s] You can see estimates holding
[3238.599s] up. China now more popular worldwide
[3241.52s] than the US. Net global perception of
[3244.079s] select countries where negative values
[3245.52s] dictate negative perceptions and
[3246.88s] positive percentage indicate positive
[3248.88s] perceptions. So, it appears since
[3253.64s] 2023 was a
[3255.88s] peak. Uh, that&#39;s interesting. I wonder
[3259.2s] where this table is from. Uh,
[3263.48s] note to Jeff, make sure you always try
[3266.24s] to include the source on these. Um, that
[3269.359s] looks like it&#39;s The Economist, which
[3271.76s] tends to have a little bit of a bias.
[3274.319s] Uh, so they&#39;re saying Russia&#39;s
[3276.0s] improving. All right, we&#39;re going to
[3277.839s] toss this one out. Next is uh
[3280.88s] front-loaded tax cuts, backloaded
[3283.04s] spending
[3284.119s] cuts, preliminary house
[3286.76s] reconcil reconciliation package, fiscal
[3289.44s] effects versus current
[3290.839s] policy.
[3292.839s] Um, look, all we want to make sure is
[3295.28s] that bonus depreciation gets slid back
[3297.44s] in. Uh, and if that&#39;s the case, that&#39;ll
[3299.839s] be really, really good for business. One
[3301.92s] China one-year uh loan prime rate
[3304.64s] continues to go down. easing continues
[3307.119s] aggressively. That&#39;s a good thing to
[3309.04s] see. China business confidence is at a
[3311.44s] record in May
[3313.559s] 2025. You can see here growth
[3315.839s] expectations have now shot through the
[3317.52s] roof. You haven&#39;t seen these levels in
[3320.28s] years. Um interest rates coming off of
[3323.88s] 5,000year lows. Rate cycles last for
[3326.4s] decades. So, you know, you saw in the
[3328.72s] 1800s it would go up, spike up, come
[3330.88s] back down, spike up, come back down.
[3334.119s] uh everyone&#39;s looking with recency bias
[3337.2s] after the 30s when it spiked up it just
[3339.28s] kept going up that doesn&#39;t mean it has
[3341.52s] to happen and I and I think it probably
[3343.359s] won&#39;t happen because of the demography
[3346.0s] in the global world in the in the
[3348.079s] developed world is more deflationary
[3350.24s] than
[3351.48s] inflationary so um I think this would be
[3354.72s] a range more like the 1800s than a spike
[3358.559s] like you saw from 30 to uh 1980 but you
[3362.64s] We&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it goes. Uh
[3364.48s] short-term rates are going down. That&#39;s
[3366.4s] what I can be pretty pretty darn
[3368.24s] confident about. Housing supply rises to
[3370.799s] highest level in five years. So, that&#39;s
[3373.2s] going to start to bring down prices,
[3375.76s] make things more affordable. Florida
[3377.44s] being the leading indicator, Texas being
[3379.119s] the leading indicator. People are
[3380.4s] starting to dump. Uh credit downgrades
[3383.28s] haven&#39;t had lasting effects on stocks.
[3386.079s] 12 months later, uh, they&#39;re up in 20%
[3391.359s] on the 2023 downgrade and 18% in the
[3395.119s] 2011 downgrade. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s kind
[3397.2s] of comical that these agencies are still
[3399.28s] in business after what they did during
[3400.799s] the housing crisis, uh, giving AAA
[3403.2s] ratings to the mortgage back securities,
[3405.2s] but, uh, you know, they&#39;re still around
[3407.44s] and up to the same old shenanigans. I
[3410.319s] understand the risks have have increased
[3412.4s] and it&#39;s a good way to put the uh
[3414.48s] government officials on alert. So
[3416.559s] hopefully they&#39;ll take the proper action
[3418.0s] in coming months uh and and we&#39;ll see
[3420.64s] how that goes. But I I I think the name
[3422.4s] of the game is going to be uh that no
[3424.88s] one&#39;s pricing in is growing our way out
[3428.0s] of this problem. And I think with the
[3430.2s] deregulation and uh a lot of the
[3432.559s] policies that are coming into play uh
[3434.559s] and housing tends to lead the economy.
[3436.4s] So, if they do get the rates down and
[3438.16s] they do get the lands open and you do
[3440.079s] see a tremendous amount of building and
[3441.839s] production,
[3443.72s] um that&#39;s going to be enormous for the
[3446.24s] economy, enormous for growth. Uh and
[3450.0s] then you get people moving into houses
[3451.599s] that they own versus they rent. Then
[3453.599s] they start fixing things, they start
[3455.2s] buying furniture, they start buying
[3456.96s] appliances, and and it&#39;s game on. So, I
[3460.0s] I&#39;m very bullish about growing our way
[3462.0s] out of it versus cutting our way out of
[3463.76s] it, but um we&#39;ll see how it plays out.
[3466.4s] Putting US credit downgrades in context,
[3470.4s] uh you can kind of see it
[3472.76s] visually on that
[3475.079s] chart. Inventory frontloading delays,
[3477.599s] tariff induced price
[3479.88s] pressures, difference between April
[3482.16s] wholesale inventory growth and 12-month
[3484.079s] average. So you can see some durable
[3486.079s] goods, home furnishings, chemicals got
[3488.4s] pushed forward. Autos got a little bit
[3490.16s] pushed forward. Durables long-term
[3492.72s] dollar sentiment sour to worst on
[3494.96s] record. That&#39;s kind of why we were
[3496.64s] calling for that counter trend bounce.
[3498.48s] We&#39;ll see if we get any more in the
[3499.92s] counter trend, but it looks like it
[3501.28s] wants to break lower. So uh so that&#39;ll
[3503.28s] be good for a lot of our thesis that we
[3505.04s] came into the year with when everyone
[3507.04s] was convinced the dollar was going
[3508.64s] higher, not lower. Toyota revs up sales
[3511.359s] of RAV 4 hybrids in the US. That&#39;s good
[3514.319s] for Cooper. Uh they make a lot more per
[3517.839s] vehicle on the hybrids than on the ICE
[3521.76s] and even more on the hybrids than the
[3524.799s] EVs, which EVs they make more than the
[3527.359s] ICEs as well. Year-to- date repurchase
[3530.96s] authorizations have now spiked from
[3533.559s] 665 billion to 711 billion, record
[3537.44s] all-time high. The relentless bid in the
[3539.52s] market continues. quarterly buyback
[3542.839s] executions. Uh again, announcements have
[3545.44s] exceeded executions, but executions are
[3547.599s] up there. Truck tonnage index versus S&amp;P
[3550.76s] 500. So, the S&amp;P 500 has gone up
[3554.4s] materially. Truck tonnage has kind of
[3556.96s] been flat, so we do want to keep an eye
[3558.799s] on that. Firsttime home buyers, share of
[3561.44s] home purchases,
[3563.44s] uh well below the 20-year average of
[3565.599s] 35%. It&#39;s less than 20. It&#39;s about 24%
[3569.359s] need rates to come down. Share of home
[3571.44s] built homes built under 1500 square f
[3574.16s] foot. We&#39;ve been talking about this
[3575.76s] would be the case since 2023. Look
[3578.24s] what&#39;s happened since. It&#39;s gone from
[3580.079s] 17% to 22%. This is going to be the
[3583.359s] whole game moving forward is smaller
[3585.599s] size, massive numbers, huge volumes.
[3588.24s] Helps the arms dealers, not the waring
[3591.04s] faction. armed dealers, meaning Building
[3592.799s] Supply, the Stanley&#39;s, the uh
[3595.599s] Generracks, the QXO&#39;s, the LVM, the
[3598.88s] LVMH, the uh KB Homes, the Pies. They&#39;re
[3601.68s] going to be a race to the bottom.
[3602.799s] They&#39;re they&#39;re going to be putting on
[3604.88s] massive supply on the market at lower
[3606.88s] and lower margins after they&#39;re going to
[3608.48s] have to offer incentives. Same thing&#39;s
[3610.079s] going to happen with the car dealers.
[3611.359s] That&#39;s why you want to be in the arms
[3612.72s] dealing business versus the waring
[3614.72s] factions. AI capex growth is continuing
[3617.04s] to run at a very strong rate.
[3627.0s] um co
[3634.04s] disruption. Yeah. So you can see here
[3638.72s] uh this
[3645.079s] is China policy and you can see the
[3648.559s] easing policy stance has has started to
[3652.88s] be the most aggressive uh since the 2016
[3657.76s] to 2018 period when the Chinese stock or
[3662.079s] hang and China tech went parabolic. from
[3665.68s] 2016 to
[3667.24s] 2018. Uh this is the most easing policy
[3671.599s] you&#39;ve seen in China since that period.
[3673.359s] So I do think we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going
[3675.44s] to continue to see follow through in
[3677.839s] China techn equities and most
[3679.88s] importantly Alibaba. Also uh exhibit 20
[3683.839s] from Goldman Sachs ETF flow tracker
[3685.92s] suggest the national team has been
[3688.0s] buying to support the market in China.
[3691.04s] cumulative flows to top five NT holding
[3694.0s] China A shares. You can see that in R&amp;B
[3698.88s] uh as the market recovers, they&#39;ve been
[3700.88s] massive buyers and that&#39;s going to
[3702.64s] continue as well just like the Japanese
[3704.799s] did. Median S&amp;P 500 short interest as a
[3707.839s] percentage of market
[3709.24s] cap. So short interest is pretty
[3711.92s] elevated here. It&#39;s record short
[3713.839s] interest in small caps. Those are going
[3715.599s] to be the next rip your face off rally.
[3717.52s] If you missed the general market uh rip
[3720.16s] your face off rally, that&#39;s where it&#39;s
[3722.319s] coming next. Dollar can fall again
[3725.52s] showing the overvalue of the dollar.
[3727.2s] Equity put call ratio gets down to these
[3729.76s] levels from elevated levels. You see
[3731.839s] continued good things in the equity
[3734.48s] markets. Tariffs may not hit every stock
[3737.4s] equally. Um we don&#39;t even know if
[3740.559s] tariffs are going to be a thing. I mean,
[3742.88s] I I would bet they are. I think it&#39;s
[3744.48s] going to be the 10% across the board.
[3746.0s] But an interesting court decision for
[3748.079s] sure. Whether he can just declare a
[3750.16s] random emergency and uh tariff anyone he
[3753.44s] wants in the name of whatever he wants
[3755.359s] is now in question. It will be
[3758.839s] fought. I would say more than a coin
[3761.2s] flip he wins. But at least it&#39;s now in
[3764.72s] question which is kind of interesting
[3766.559s] because so many of the companies have
[3769.28s] adjusted to the prospected of of
[3771.599s] tariffs. We heard VF Corp and they&#39;re
[3773.599s] like, &quot;We&#39;ll just come out stronger and
[3775.119s] here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to do it.&quot; And so
[3776.96s] imagine if there wind up being no
[3779.359s] tariffs and they take all the actions to
[3781.28s] absorb the extra hundred million, $150
[3783.76s] million of costs and then that just goes
[3785.839s] straight to the bottom line. That, you
[3787.44s] know, that&#39;s that&#39;s a rosy scenario
[3789.2s] that&#39;s not in any models right now, but
[3791.2s] like if that happened, talk about growth
[3793.599s] exceeding expectations. Um 60-day loan
[3797.839s] delinquency rate. So this is a bare uh
[3802.319s] wet dream chart. It&#39;s showing prime auto
[3805.319s] loans are uh moving up to
[3809.72s] 2019 levels and subprime auto loans are
[3815.079s] accelerating in a big way. Um you know
[3819.599s] it is what it is. I mean
[3823.24s] it&#39;s question is it&#39;s the percent of
[3826.16s] outstanding. question is what percent is
[3828.64s] outstanding relative to past periods
[3831.119s] when rates were zero now the rates are
[3833.68s] so high what is the magnitude of the
[3836.319s] total portfolio and the answer is
[3838.16s] probably smaller but um have to get some
[3840.88s] data to burden ourselves with the facts
[3842.559s] on that one relative valuations are
[3844.16s] depressed across key sectors says UK 12
[3847.359s] month forward PE
[3849.079s] ratio in consumer staples UK that&#39;s
[3852.559s] interesting
[3855.4s] thing, energy materials, of course, dry
[3858.72s] powder buying the
[3860.92s] dip, weekly change in money market funds
[3863.92s] versus the S&amp;P
[3865.559s] 500. So, you see the last time you saw
[3868.319s] this dip was April 2024. You had a
[3871.28s] continued rally for the all the way
[3873.28s] through mid July. I think that&#39;s
[3875.599s] probably the base case. I think we do
[3878.079s] probably persist higher in for the next
[3880.559s] month and a half, two or so, two months
[3883.28s] before we get a little bit of rest bit
[3885.039s] in the fall. Um TSA pass through numbers
[3888.799s] good, which is kind of interesting
[3890.24s] because uh most of the airline stocks
[3893.2s] have been left for dead. There might be
[3894.72s] some things to do there. How higher
[3896.48s] rates could impact stocks? Different
[3899.28s] equity investment scenarios on the
[3900.72s] 10-year yield. Minimal impact where we
[3903.839s] are.
[3906.48s] Uh if you get
[3908.28s] higher issue for rate sensitives and low
[3912.359s] quality. Okay, that&#39;s interesting. Uh
[3915.68s] what is
[3917.96s] this
[3921.799s] city? What is this? Economic surprise
[3924.16s] index turning positive. Japanese yield
[3927.039s] sore. We&#39;ve told you this is this is
[3929.44s] continued pressure on MAG 7. The carry
[3931.76s] trade unwind will persist as inflation
[3934.0s] ticks up in Japan. they continue to
[3936.64s] tighten. As they continue to tighten,
[3938.64s] the the yen gets stronger relative to
[3940.64s] the dollar. Uh uh the carry trade is no
[3944.0s] longer costfree capital and most of that
[3946.16s] hot money was in the most crowded trade,
[3948.319s] which was the MAG 7, which is why I
[3950.319s] don&#39;t think you can expect a lot more
[3951.76s] after it trades after that basket trades
[3953.839s] to the top end of the range. And I think
[3955.599s] you can expect a ton from the other 493
[3958.079s] where there&#39;s opportunities where they
[3959.359s] were hit by tariffs, fear of the worst,
[3961.359s] and wind up with something less. And uh
[3963.44s] and that&#39;s where you get the divergence
[3965.52s] between expectations and reality. And
[3967.44s] you get the forced just as you got the
[3969.52s] forced structural selling, you get the
[3970.96s] forced structural buying as we&#39;ve we&#39;ve
[3972.799s] gotten a taste of in the last six weeks.
[3975.039s] Bloomberg dollar gauge hit 16-month low.
[3978.559s] I mean, unbelievable. Everyone was like,
[3980.559s] you&#39;re totally wrong on the dollar. And
[3983.0s] boom, completely rolled over. We
[3986.559s] remember all the charts we went over
[3988.16s] after the election goes up, Trump 1.0, 0
[3992.0s] and then it rolls over after the
[3993.76s] inauguration. That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s
[3995.88s] happened. Uh one month S&amp;P return versus
[4000.24s] change in the 10-year
[4003.16s] yields, rates rising, rates falling,
[4006.88s] zcore, okay, delinquency rate, credit
[4009.68s] card loans, and all commercial banks.
[4011.92s] So, you know, you look at credit card
[4014.72s] loans, I mean, it&#39;s below average. So,
[4016.72s] you look at those subprime auto loans.
[4019.52s] So yeah, we saw that a little bit last
[4021.44s] year in Dollar General and Dollar Tree
[4023.44s] and the lowest of the low end, but in
[4027.0s] aggregate delinquencies are below
[4029.2s] average. So, you know, they peaked a
[4031.28s] little bit and now they&#39;ve come back in.
[4033.44s] Seven US companies make up more than the
[4035.92s] next big five countries in the
[4039.96s] MSCI all world country index
[4043.64s] combined. The problem is is they no
[4045.839s] longer make up that much more of the
[4047.599s] earnings. And that&#39;s the divergence. And
[4049.839s] that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing a constant um
[4053.28s] leakage and a and a and persistent, you
[4056.24s] know, historically there had been a
[4057.92s] persistent bid. Now there&#39;s a persistent
[4059.599s] dribble uh away from those and I think
[4062.319s] that that continues even if they make it
[4064.319s] back to the top of the range. 90% of
[4066.48s] companies in the MCI outperformed MAG 7
[4070.16s] over the past three months. This is what
[4072.64s] we&#39;ve been calling for and that&#39;s what&#39;s
[4074.4s] taking place. market share of the 10
[4075.92s] largest S&amp;P 500 stocks uh at different
[4078.96s] peaks 38% versus 19%. What&#39;s valuable is
[4082.16s] when they actually measure it against
[4083.76s] percentage of the S&amp;P earnings and it&#39;s
[4088.319s] no longer uh they no longer command that
[4091.799s] waiting of earnings relative to weight
[4095.2s] and that&#39;s why the divergence has
[4096.719s] created a weight and that&#39;s why they&#39;ve
[4098.159s] dramatically underperformed this year.
[4099.6s] Consensus change in forward 12-month
[4101.92s] earnings per share. China Tech 100 ex
[4105.44s] consensus uh forward earnings per share
[4108.88s] has gone parabolic over the last three
[4111.44s] months up and US tech has gone down.
[4115.279s] Okay, look at the change in earnings
[4117.759s] expectations for China tech versus US
[4119.6s] tech. US tech going down, China going
[4121.839s] up.
[4123.359s] um number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing
[4126.719s] uh annual
[4128.92s] guidance. So you can see here everyone
[4132.319s] says they all pulled guidance. It&#39;s not
[4133.92s] the case. They pulled guidance during
[4136.0s] COVID. They did not pull guidance uh
[4140.0s] anywhere near that much in the last with
[4142.799s] the tariff uncertainty. China by far has
[4145.279s] the largest share of the global
[4147.04s] e-commerce market in terms of percent.
[4150.239s] They have
[4153.239s] 55% share of global online retail sales
[4156.88s] last year. US had 20% and who has the
[4161.44s] largest share of China e-commerce is
[4163.44s] Alibaba with 40%. Not to have a piece of
[4166.319s] that I think is uh is going to prove to
[4169.44s] I think not owning Alibaba in the next
[4171.759s] 24 months is probably going to have
[4175.56s] bigger career risk for most managers
[4179.6s] than owning too much mag 7 which has
[4182.88s] gotten shellacked. Um so let&#39;s see how
[4185.679s] that plays out. Buy the dip is back.
[4188.4s] Average S&amp;P 500 return in session
[4191.52s] following a down day. uh look at the US
[4194.32s] Treasury yield
[4201.159s] curve. Oh, this is interesting. Uh this
[4204.0s] is from Cali Cox over at Rit Holtz.
[4206.32s] Historically, odds of gains increase
[4207.92s] with holding period. So, if you hold
[4209.36s] stocks for a day, your average your odds
[4212.48s] of being up or 51%. If you hold them for
[4214.8s] three months, your odds are 66%. If you
[4216.96s] hold them for 10 years, your odds are
[4218.4s] 93%. If you own stocks for 20 years,
[4221.04s] your odds are 100%. Uh, US first home
[4224.96s] buyers are now older than ever. So, uh,
[4228.719s] repeat buyers average age 61, first-time
[4231.92s] home buyers average age 38. That is
[4235.36s] really high, which tells us we&#39;ve got a
[4237.36s] lot of pent-up demand ahead of us. uh
[4240.239s] houses will get smaller, prices will go
[4242.719s] down, supply will go up, rates will come
[4245.679s] down, all the so the way to play it is
[4248.96s] play the derivative. Don&#39;t play the
[4251.36s] primary. And uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s what
[4253.92s] we&#39;ve been talking about for many months
[4255.84s] now. For foreigners, US dollar weakness
[4258.32s] compounds the pain of US equities
[4260.96s] falling. So all those
[4263.32s] folks crowded into MAG 7 that got
[4266.08s] smashed, they also got smashed because
[4269.12s] while their equities fell 25%, they were
[4272.239s] all crowded into mag 7, the currency
[4274.719s] fell another 10% on top of it. So they
[4277.36s] they&#39;ve just been smoked.
[4280.84s] Um emerging market relative earnings are
[4284.159s] historically depressed. 12 month forward
[4287.36s] earnings relative to the US, more upside
[4289.44s] potential, limited downside risk. We
[4291.12s] haven&#39;t seen this since when? Early
[4292.88s] 2000s, which we&#39;ve talked about forever.
[4295.28s] Same thing with trailing EPS to world
[4298.36s] GDP. Again, levels we saw in the early
[4301.84s] 2000s, which led to the biggest rally in
[4303.92s] the shortest amount of time in
[4305.32s] international value versus grow
[4307.36s] international value versus growth, small
[4309.28s] versus large,
[4310.84s] etc. Mag 7 free cash flow growth X
[4314.4s] Nvidia yearon year is now 111%.
[4318.8s] uh you haven&#39;t seen this type of
[4321.12s] negative free cash flows since or
[4323.44s] falling free cash flow since 2021 and
[4325.84s] 2022 which is why I don&#39;t think that
[4327.52s] basket&#39;s getting much higher than the
[4328.96s] top of the range and the other 493 are
[4331.36s] going to pick up some slack. Healthcare
[4333.84s] market cap is a percentage of S&amp;P 500.
[4336.48s] This reminds me an awful
[4338.44s] lot of when energy fell from 9% of the
[4343.28s] S&amp;P 500 down to 3% in 2020 when we were
[4347.199s] buying Exxon Mobile handover fist at $33
[4351.199s] when oil went negative in 2020. Now it&#39;s
[4354.4s] healthc care hasn&#39;t been this low as a
[4356.8s] percentage since 2001 and since 2011. We
[4360.88s] got to we got to figure out I mean we&#39;ve
[4363.92s] got good healthc care exposure but we
[4365.52s] got to find some more opportunity
[4366.88s] because those type of divergences are
[4369.12s] generational opportunities. Uh Goldman
[4371.6s] Sachs social media economic sentiment
[4376.76s] index relative to University of Michigan
[4380.08s] consumer sentiments. We did see the CB
[4382.719s] consumer confidence actually catch up
[4384.8s] this week. So that&#39;s a little sale. UK
[4387.36s] retail sales X auto starting to pick up.
[4389.76s] That&#39;s good to see. In chi, gxo has a
[4392.48s] huge exposure to uh UK
[4395.32s] retail or UK business. In China today,
[4398.64s] it makes sense to borrow to buy back
[4401.36s] shares. China 10-year government bond
[4403.84s] yield minus MCI China index dividend
[4406.56s] yield. This is the same situation that
[4408.719s] caused the Japanese government to be
[4410.56s] buying massive amounts of equities uh
[4413.199s] which caused the Japanese stock market
[4414.8s] to recover a few years back. And now the
[4418.56s] same situation is set up in
[4422.12s] China.
[4423.64s] Um, very very interesting. Again, going
[4426.64s] back to that 2016 situation where 2016
[4430.48s] to 2018 you had a straight up parabolic
[4433.04s] rally just like 2009 to
[4435.48s] 2011. You you can just see it over and
[4437.92s] over. So we we&#39;re set positioned very
[4441.6s] well there. S&amp;P 500 average
[4444.76s] realized stock correlation picked up a
[4448.159s] little bit. US to Europe trade is still
[4453.32s] alive. US pensions are modeled to sell
[4455.84s] $19 billion of stock for month and
[4458.04s] rebalancing. That&#39;s this
[4460.44s] month. Ranks in the 89th percentile
[4463.04s] amongst all buy and sell estimates in
[4464.8s] absolute dollar value going back to
[4467.64s] 2000. That&#39;s from Seth
[4471.08s] Golden. Road to reshoring may be bumpier
[4473.6s] than expected. That&#39;s
[4478.28s] correct. Natural gas trading above 370
[4481.04s] on the July contract. It&#39;s going to be a
[4482.4s] long hot summer. We agree. Go comps.go.
[4485.6s] More clues the bulls are in charge.
[4487.12s] That&#39;s from uh Ryan Dietrich over at
[4489.199s] Carson. S&amp;P performance after May is up
[4492.96s] 5% or greater. 12 months out is up on
[4495.6s] average 19.9. Six months out is up on
[4498.56s] average 6.4. Bull markets last longer
[4501.28s] than you think. We&#39;re only 60 months in.
[4504.719s] Uh 2009 recovery, we saw 131 months. 87
[4508.48s] recovery, we saw 148 months. Uh and so
[4513.08s] on. Investor pessimism tracking
[4515.679s] identical to prior major recovery
[4517.719s] rallies. Total equity flows one month.
[4521.199s] You can see the draw down here is
[4522.88s] coincident with many troughs and the
[4526.64s] rallies when it turns green tend to
[4528.32s] persist for many months. So we&#39;re at the
[4529.92s] beginning of
[4530.84s] that. What is the taco trade acronym
[4533.6s] that stands for Trump always chickens
[4534.96s] out? I look I think this is a stupid way
[4537.12s] to phrase it because
[4542.679s] ultimately you want him acting
[4545.04s] rationally when the facts are not
[4546.88s] favorable for forward prospects. And
[4549.28s] that&#39;s what he&#39;s shown that he&#39;s going
[4551.44s] to do uh in the face of positions taken
[4555.76s] that were initial offerings in a
[4559.6s] negotiating stance that caused excessive
[4563.08s] volatility. Uh created huge opportunity
[4565.679s] for us. So we&#39;re grateful. But uh I can
[4568.159s] understand how people would get upset
[4570.239s] that sold in the hole and now it&#39;s
[4571.76s] recovered on them. But
[4573.88s] um we weren&#39;t we were concerned that it
[4577.84s] was an extreme position. But as we you
[4580.64s] know I I continue to go back to that
[4583.04s] special call I did for clients when we
[4585.6s] went through company by company. I said
[4587.28s] look now&#39;s the if you&#39;re if you&#39;re
[4588.64s] putting more money in now&#39;s the time.
[4590.159s] This is like man-made. Started with a
[4592.8s] tweet could end with a tweet. Look at
[4594.0s] the cash flows. Look at the earnings.
[4595.199s] Look at the revenues. Let&#39;s rock and
[4596.4s] roll. We can buy them on sale. And so
[4598.88s] many of you came in and uh and did that.
[4601.76s] And there&#39;s still a great enough pocket
[4605.44s] of stocks to still do that now that
[4608.84s] um it&#39;s pretty exciting. Anyway, JP
[4611.44s] Morgan sees record outperformance by
[4613.12s] European stocks again on no one&#39;s bingo
[4615.76s] card. Those of you who are listeners uh
[4618.0s] in the fourth quarter took advantage of
[4619.6s] all this stuff beating up
[4622.52s] renewables starting to perform. That&#39;s
[4624.719s] interesting.
[4625.8s] Healthcare healthc care price to book at
[4628.4s] one times versus 1.7 times historical
[4631.04s] average. that&#39;s consistent with the
[4632.239s] waiting being so low. So, we got to
[4633.679s] start to dig into healthcare a little
[4635.04s] bit more. Uh price to operating cash
[4637.52s] flow at one times versus 1.5 times
[4640.12s] historical average. Uh forward PE at8
[4643.199s] times versus 1.1 times historical
[4646.04s] average. Yeah, healthcare. Similar story
[4649.28s] with
[4651.32s] energy price to
[4653.48s] book at the low end of the range. Price
[4656.719s] to operating cash flow low end of the
[4659.12s] range towards the minimum. I mean this
[4661.76s] is Yeah. Yeah. Energy and health care.
[4665.199s] We probably need a little
[4668.04s] more. We might be okay on on on
[4671.12s] healthcare, but yeah, we got to keep
[4673.239s] digging. Rolling four-week average
[4675.52s] trends by client
[4679.4s] type. Hedge funds still underweight,
[4682.719s] still forced buyers.
[4685.44s] I wanted to go through. My goodness,
[4687.92s] we&#39;re going we got so much stuff to
[4689.6s] cover here.
[4691.4s] Um I guess we&#39;ll just do this one. We
[4693.84s] were going to go through the whole
[4694.56s] commodities basket. Maybe we&#39;ll do that
[4695.92s] next week if we have more time. Um you
[4699.04s] can just see commercials is a smart
[4700.8s] money when they&#39;re getting long. They&#39;re
[4703.12s] they&#39;re the longest that they&#39;ve been
[4705.199s] since 2018. You&#39;ve been putting in this
[4708.08s] long base. I think bonds are going to
[4709.76s] get bid bigly this summer and uh part of
[4713.28s] it will be the SLR. Um you know you saw
[4716.4s] continuing claims today maybe the Fed
[4718.159s] will do a cut or so. You couple that
[4720.56s] too. Uh again the positioning is such
[4724.4s] hedge funds are short in the whole this
[4726.4s] is always a formula for massive rip your
[4728.56s] face off rallies. So yields are going
[4731.04s] down. It&#39;s consistent with the housing
[4733.28s] theme. It&#39;s consistent with everything
[4734.56s] we&#39;ve talked about international versus
[4736.08s] US dollar weaker etc. Goldman Sachs
[4738.88s] expects stronger yuan to boost Chinese
[4740.64s] stocks. We agree. We&#39;ve just we&#39;ve been
[4742.64s] saying that for over a year. Ali and
[4744.64s] it&#39;s happened. Alibaba&#39;s new instant
[4746.56s] commerce portal m passes 40 million
[4748.96s] daily orders. Uh by the way, you didn&#39;t
[4752.0s] even know you own
[4753.64s] that. The amount of stuff that we own as
[4756.32s] owners of Alibaba, which aren&#39;t credited
[4758.08s] in the stock yet, is just mindboggling.
[4760.0s] I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my
[4761.44s] whole career. Al Alibaba chairman Joe
[4763.679s] Sai says company on good path after
[4765.92s] years of setbacks. Uh Goldman Sachs edge
[4769.679s] head funds cut magnificent 7 bought
[4771.76s] China stocks. China&#39;s policy rebalancing
[4774.8s] toward consumption. Kin Kiu Jin
[4778.12s] says Intel CEO Lip Bhutan has a long
[4781.36s] track record in the chip industry. Now
[4782.88s] he needs a big customer. He will get
[4784.64s] that big customer. Not because he&#39;s
[4786.239s] necessarily the best. I&#39;m not saying
[4788.239s] Intel is going to be better than Taiwan
[4789.679s] Semiconductor. because he&#39;s going to be
[4791.44s] in a duopoly and there&#39;s only two games
[4793.199s] in town and they&#39;re going to they&#39;re
[4795.12s] going to prop up uh you know like we
[4797.92s] they&#39;re going to prop up Intel like we
[4799.52s] can at Bernie and make a bunch of chips.
[4801.36s] They will be the king of the inferior
[4803.199s] chips but the amount of demand is so
[4805.76s] unlimited that the crumbs are going to
[4807.679s] be enormous and based on where it&#39;s
[4809.52s] priced those crumbs are going to have a
[4811.76s] monstrous effect and operating leverage
[4814.56s] straight to the bottom line and into the
[4816.48s] price of the stock. Toyota goes all
[4818.56s] hybrid with its bestselling US vehicle.
[4821.12s] Toyota sales hit second monthly high on
[4824.719s] US tariff rush. Honda CEO is all about
[4827.679s] hybrids now that EV adoption is pushed
[4829.76s] back five to six years. Lilo and or Lilo
[4833.36s] and Stitch Mission Impossible Fuel
[4835.36s] Memorial Day record. Lilo and Stitch is
[4837.6s] Disney. Bernstein says US Gas Super
[4840.159s] Cycle is coming. We love it, baby.
[4842.32s] Comtock and range resources. My
[4844.96s] goodness, that thing. I&#39;ve had that
[4846.239s] thing since 2018. It&#39;s unbelievable. Now
[4850.719s] basis 410 dropped to 160 during COVID
[4855.04s] and um and it&#39;s getting up there. I
[4858.239s] think you know 5560 we got to start to
[4860.88s] take some off on a 410 basis. Uh Boeing
[4864.88s] stock has been surging. Here&#39;s why it&#39;s
[4866.56s] become a FOMO play. So sold to you. We
[4869.28s] we took multibaggers on the options. We
[4871.52s] kept every single share of stock. We
[4873.36s] will be riding that higher but I think
[4875.12s] it&#39;s gone very far very fast in a short
[4877.12s] period of time and sometimes you just
[4878.4s] got to book a huge win. Bessant sees
[4880.56s] easing capital rule on treasuries this
[4882.48s] summer. How you doing? SLR, we&#39;ve been
[4884.48s] talking about it. Get ready. New home
[4886.64s] sales unexpectedly surge despite high
[4888.56s] mortgage rate as builders lower prices
[4890.96s] again. Waring fashions versus arm
[4893.28s] dealers. Play the arms dealers, not the
[4894.88s] waring factions. A building boom on
[4896.56s] federal land. It just might work.
[4899.12s] Everyone wants more housing. The
[4900.4s] government needs to make sure it gets
[4901.6s] built and the government will. Emerging
[4903.76s] markets, this government will emerging
[4905.679s] markets said to see the next bull run as
[4907.6s] the sell the US narrative gains
[4911.48s] ground.
[4913.159s] Um I think everyone has this view that
[4916.639s] it&#39;s either or like if you think
[4920.84s] international stocks are going to
[4922.56s] outperform then you think US stocks are
[4924.88s] going to do bad or US has lost its way.
[4927.199s] No, US has just pulled forward a ton of
[4929.52s] gains. They now needs to consolidate.
[4932.44s] Uh international and emerging markets
[4935.6s] have been left for dead. Now they have
[4937.04s] to catch up. I mean it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
[4939.04s] complicated. You don&#39;t have to make it
[4940.32s] ideological. Just deal unbiased with the
[4943.36s] facts. Where is the opportunity? Do you
[4946.08s] you know does it mean you like one form
[4947.92s] of government over another? No. Look,
[4950.4s] well, clearly I like capitalism over
[4952.719s] communism all day long, but the prices
[4955.12s] have gotten so cheap in China that
[4958.92s] you
[4960.44s] look, don&#39;t have exposure to it. It&#39;s
[4962.96s] okay. We&#39;ll we&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t have
[4964.88s] exposure to energy in 2020 when managers
[4967.84s] were getting fired if they owned an oil
[4970.159s] stock at the lows and then two years
[4972.639s] later they were buying it at the highs
[4974.639s] because they also had career risk. I
[4976.48s] mean it just the market in the short
[4978.96s] term is a voting machine based on
[4981.0s] emotion. In the long term it is a
[4983.44s] weighing machine based on fundamentals.
[4985.52s] Leave all the ideology, leave all the
[4987.44s] emotions, leave all the on the
[4989.36s] sideline and focus on the numbers. You
[4992.639s] know the only reason you put a dollar
[4994.4s] into an investment is because you expect
[4996.48s] to get multiple dollars at some point in
[4999.04s] the future. So you have to be careful.
[5000.719s] What are you paying for today&#39;s dollars
[5002.88s] and what are you paying for the future
[5004.48s] dollars? You know, so many people bring
[5006.32s] me great
[5007.639s] companies that are going to do every all
[5010.8s] the miraculous things that they say
[5012.239s] they&#39;re going to do. The problem is they
[5014.159s] are priced today as if all of those
[5016.4s] miraculous things already happened. And
[5018.32s] these people are making bets that
[5019.76s] they&#39;re going to double price for what
[5021.28s] hasn&#39;t even happened that will happen.
[5023.44s] But you&#39;re already paying for what&#39;s
[5025.04s] going to happen. Therefore, if 10% less
[5028.4s] happens, the stock&#39;s down 70%. And
[5030.48s] that&#39;s what happens over and over. And
[5032.0s] that&#39;s why we continue to say avoid
[5034.48s] shiny objects and focus on things that
[5038.0s] you can put massive amounts of money to
[5039.679s] work and sleep like a baby at night
[5041.6s] because they&#39;re in a cyclical trough or
[5043.199s] they&#39;re temporarily impaired.
[5044.56s] Highquality businesses that are
[5046.159s] temporarily misappraised over and over,
[5048.719s] rinse and repeat. Take your doubles and
[5050.32s] triples onto the next and live a happy
[5053.44s] life and play a lot of golf. What else
[5054.88s] can I tell you? Um, moving on. Healthc
[5058.08s] care stocks are so bad they&#39;re good.
[5059.679s] What to buy now? All right, Ben
[5061.76s] Levenson, tell me what to buy now. Let&#39;s
[5063.52s] see what he&#39;s
[5064.6s] got. Ben&#39;s telling me to buy the Healthc
[5067.52s] Care Spider ETF. All right, we have the
[5069.8s] biotech. Uh, he&#39;s he&#39;s leaning towards
[5073.199s] United
[5074.36s] Healthcare. Um, he&#39;s probably right on
[5077.92s] that. Humanana. Okay. In the targets,
[5081.04s] Danaher. Yeah, kind of like that. Uh,
[5084.4s] Gilead, maybe. Abby, probably. I like
[5088.719s] this article. Look, Barren is awesome.
[5090.4s] Ben Leonson&#39;s a legend. He&#39;s put out a
[5092.639s] lot of good stuff. So, that&#39;s a good
[5093.76s] starting point. Why value investing has
[5095.84s] worked better outside the
[5097.639s] US. Good article in Morning
[5101.88s] Star. And that&#39;s now
[5107.48s] changing. What are they talking about
[5109.52s] here? International
[5111.32s] value. Alibaba is the number one waiting
[5113.84s] in the international value and growth
[5116.0s] index.
[5124.159s] Okay. Beyond Europe, this is a good
[5125.679s] article. Pull that up at Morning Star.
[5128.0s] Investors pile into ETFs at records pace
[5130.719s] despite market turmoil. US exchange
[5133.28s] traded funds have collected some 437
[5135.36s] billion in new assets so far this year.
[5138.4s] They bought the dip just like they did
[5140.08s] in COVID. Advanced Auto Park Parts stock
[5143.36s] source
[5144.76s] 55% guidance is holding up in the face
[5147.12s] of tariffs. So, uh, they&#39;re executing on
[5150.48s] everything they said. They delevered the
[5151.92s] balance sheet. They shut the
[5152.8s] unprofitable stores. They consolidated
[5155.04s] the the distribution hubs. And now
[5156.88s] they&#39;re opening up new stores in the
[5158.719s] areas where they&#39;re number one and two,
[5160.159s] and it&#39;s working. Oh, and by the way,
[5162.0s] another dog has started to rise from the
[5164.96s] dead like a phoenix from the ashes.
[5166.639s] Canada goose sales up unexpectedly rise
[5169.52s] as luxury spending holds up. High-end
[5172.239s] coats posted a 7.4% increase in fourth
[5175.92s] quarter sales ahead of consensus
[5177.679s] estimates for a slight drop in the stock
[5179.199s] is now starting to rip. Clean up to
[5181.52s] comeback stock market and sentiment
[5182.96s] results. Advanced auto parts and vans.
[5186.679s] Um so you can see AAP is coming off the
[5191.36s] mat now. We&#39;ll just quickly go through
[5194.32s] some of the key points. You can read the
[5196.159s] full article at hedge
[5197.639s] funfundtips.com. It is
[5199.639s] entitled Cleanup to come back and that&#39;s
[5202.56s] kind of the story with both vans and
[5204.4s] with advanced auto parts. Love the
[5206.48s] title, Jeff. Good job. And
[5211.0s] um so let&#39;s just go through some of the
[5213.44s] key points here. First pro segment which
[5216.48s] makes up 60% of advanced auto parts
[5218.4s] sales continues to perform well posting
[5220.8s] low singledigit growth for the third
[5223.679s] straight quarter and delivering eight
[5225.04s] consecutive weeks of positive US pro
[5226.8s] comp sales. That momentum has continued
[5228.8s] into Q2 with strength sustained through
[5230.719s] the first four weeks. Supply chain
[5232.4s] consolidation continues to progress
[5234.0s] reducing the network from 38 varied
[5235.6s] distribution centers to 12 large
[5237.04s] distribution centers operating on a
[5239.04s] unified warehouse system. Look this this
[5242.56s] is what he said he was going to do. This
[5244.0s] is what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s just doing it a
[5245.44s] little faster than expected. C
[5249.56s] uh completed storefront footprint
[5252.88s] optimization in March, well ahead of the
[5254.639s] original mid2025 guidance. Cash expenses
[5256.8s] for the plan are now 150 million for the
[5258.48s] full year, down from $200 million
[5260.48s] estimates. Transfer sales related to
[5262.239s] store closures were strong, primarily in
[5264.159s] the pro segment. Vance Auto Part is
[5266.32s] entering a new phase of store expansion,
[5268.239s] opening a 100 new stores in the next
[5270.159s] three years. That is not the sign of a
[5271.679s] company that&#39;s going out of business.
[5272.719s] That&#39;s a sign of a company that&#39;s just
[5274.0s] getting started. Store concentration and
[5275.92s] density have increased with 75% of the
[5278.0s] footprint in markets where Advanced Auto
[5280.159s] Parts holds the number one or number two
[5281.76s] position. Operating margins for the full
[5283.44s] year are still expected to be between
[5285.199s] two to 3%. Q2 is tracking in line with
[5287.44s] the state range with further gains
[5289.28s] expected in the second half. Most
[5290.639s] importantly, Advanced Auto Parts remains
[5292.56s] well on track to meet its 2027 target of
[5296.12s] 7% operating margins. All major company
[5300.159s] KPIs continue to improve. Store
[5301.92s] availability rose to the mid 90% up 200
[5304.239s] basis points. DC labor productivity
[5306.159s] increased by low double digit percent
[5307.679s] versus fiscal year 2024. Time to serve
[5310.48s] improved by 10 minutes down to 40
[5313.239s] minutes.
[5315.719s] Okay. Total exposure of advanced auto
[5318.159s] parts to China is only 10%. Management
[5320.719s] reaffirmed it fullear guidance of 8.4
[5322.8s] billion to 8.6 billion in net sales.
[5325.88s] uh.5 to 1.5 comp sales growth, 2 to 3%
[5330.719s] operating margins, and 150 to 250 in
[5332.96s] adjusted diluted earnings per share.
[5335.52s] This is, you know, it&#39;s starting to
[5337.12s] reacelerate. That&#39;s what you want to
[5338.8s] see.
[5340.6s] Uh do-it-yourself is showing signs of
[5343.04s] stabilization. So, you can go through
[5344.32s] all the details here. And then Vans
[5347.44s] looked a lot worse than it actually was,
[5349.36s] or VF Corp rather. Vans is where the
[5351.6s] pressure is. They&#39;re still generating
[5352.639s] free cash flow. Cash flow is going to be
[5354.719s] up yearon year. That&#39;s the name of the
[5356.239s] game. They have the runway. Bracken is
[5358.04s] delivering. Um, okay. So, Vans was the
[5361.44s] big hit. Down 20% year-on-year compared
[5364.159s] to an 8% decline in the prior quarter.
[5366.239s] 60% of the decline, however, was due to
[5368.96s] deliberate cleanup efforts, including
[5370.8s] closing 8% of global van stores and
[5372.719s] reducing exposure to unproductive value
[5374.56s] channels, 35% along with inventory
[5376.8s] normalization in China contributing
[5378.8s] another 25%. These headwinds are
[5380.56s] expected to fade sequentially and fully
[5382.56s] lapsed by Q4 of this year. So this game
[5385.76s] is over. Adjusted for these actions,
[5388.239s] revenue would have been down high single
[5389.84s] digits. More importantly, these efforts
[5391.84s] drove significant gross margin
[5393.36s] improvement in vans. This is exactly
[5395.199s] what he did at Logitech. He increased
[5397.679s] gross margin by 900 basis points during
[5400.4s] his tenure and you had a a 28 bagger in
[5404.239s] his last turnaround deal. If you put in
[5406.96s] a million dollars when Bracken got
[5408.88s] involved in 2013, you got $28 million
[5413.199s] out when he left. So, you can see here
[5416.08s] in 2013, he got in, the stock was down
[5418.32s] over 85% and went straight from $5 to
[5421.719s] $131. We&#39;re going to see something like
[5424.08s] this in VF Corp. This guy is going to
[5426.8s] turn it around. It&#39;s just when it turns
[5429.199s] when it I can&#39;t emphasize this enough.
[5432.239s] when these things turn, it it starts to
[5434.96s] happen overnight. So,
[5437.76s] um, so it&#39;s it&#39;s a long time. It&#39;s like
[5440.08s] when you drive by when they&#39;re building
[5441.36s] a skyscraper. You drive by every week
[5443.28s] for a year and it looks like they&#39;re
[5444.96s] making no progress because all the
[5446.32s] progress is
[5447.4s] going on building the strong foundation
[5450.4s] beneath the surface. So, when you look
[5451.84s] from street level, you&#39;re like, there&#39;s
[5453.52s] no building. Like, what the hell is
[5455.12s] going on? But meanwhile, they&#39;re, you
[5457.04s] know, 30 levels down building that
[5459.44s] foundation, laying the foundation. And
[5460.96s] once that foundation is in place, you
[5462.56s] see 50 stories go up in a matter of
[5464.48s] months uh because the foundation has
[5466.639s] already been set. The same is the case
[5468.32s] Northace grew at 4 point 4% uh yearon
[5472.4s] year driven by 9% growth in global DTC.
[5474.96s] All regions contribute with double
[5476.32s] digits gains in America&#39;s and EMA.
[5479.36s] Outerware was the standout while
[5481.04s] footwear continued to grow across all
[5482.639s] regions. success management successfully
[5484.8s] delivered on the initial $300 million
[5486.96s] gross cost savings target. Plans to
[5489.04s] achieve 500 to 600 million in net
[5490.8s] operating expansion plus 10% margins by
[5493.76s] fiscal year 2028. So he&#39;s doing the
[5495.92s] exact same playbook that he did at
[5497.76s] Logitech when the stock was down 82%.
[5500.719s] Adjusted gross margins reached 53% up
[5503.52s] 560 basis points year-on-year. You don&#39;t
[5506.48s] see margin expansion of 560 basis points
[5509.44s] in a business that&#39;s doing poorly. While
[5511.52s] adjusted operating margins incre
[5513.199s] improved by 400 basis points, management
[5515.36s] reduced debt by 1.8 billion during the
[5517.76s] year, a 26% year-on-year decline, ending
[5520.8s] the quarter with 4.1 times net leverage,
[5522.8s] down a full turn, remains on track to
[5524.4s] reach 2.5 by fiscal year 2028. Net debt
[5527.36s] now stands at 4.94. Less than 2% of
[5530.639s] total US imports are sourced from China.
[5534.08s] Management estimates the annual ghost
[5535.52s] tariff impact current 10% rates to be
[5537.6s] about 150 million but expects to fully
[5539.44s] mitigate this through cost actions and
[5541.44s] optimized sourcing. Um new products
[5544.08s] advance continued to see strong demand.
[5546.08s] Super low pro launched in Q4 sold out
[5548.4s] its top two styles almost immediately.
[5550.4s] Management expects continued momentum
[5552.8s] throughout the year with back to school
[5554.32s] and holiday season starting to see
[5555.84s] influence on the new global brand
[5558.08s] president Sun Cho who came from
[5561.159s] Lululemon. Timberland&#39;s continued
[5563.12s] strength with sales up 13% year-on-year.
[5564.96s] Strong DTC growth combined with fewer
[5566.88s] discounts drove significantly higher
[5568.56s] margins for Q20 for fiscal year 2026.
[5572.159s] Management expects free cash flow to
[5573.84s] improve from
[5575.56s] 313 million include excluding profits
[5578.8s] from one-time non-core asset sales while
[5581.52s] also anticipating fullear operating
[5583.52s] margin expansion. Inventory reduction
[5586.159s] continues to pro progress down 4%
[5588.0s] year-on-year, though it would have been
[5589.44s] higher during the quarter without
[5590.719s] accelerated product shipments into the
[5592.32s] US during the 90-day tariff pause
[5602.36s] window. All right, so you can go through
[5604.639s] the highlighted parts. Um, Morning Star
[5608.0s] put out an article after earnings uh
[5610.48s] saying fair value is $40 a share.
[5614.239s] They&#39;re obviously being very
[5615.44s] conservative, but uh optimistic relative
[5618.239s] to consensus. Uh we think it&#39;s going to
[5620.4s] be a lot more with Bracken and um could
[5623.6s] be a very very many multibaggers. Canada
[5626.48s] Goose the free cash flow is going
[5628.0s] through the roof. The stock is starting
[5629.44s] to rebound up almost double off the lows
[5632.239s] and just be so you can go through some
[5635.12s] of the details
[5637.0s] here and what&#39;s happening uh on all
[5639.92s] fronts. They&#39;re executing on exactly
[5641.679s] what they said they were going to do. uh
[5643.76s] sentiment is improving to 65 but it&#39;s
[5646.239s] nowhere near extreme levels so there&#39;s
[5647.84s] probably some more upside uh and I think
[5650.56s] uh in on balance into July uh we remain
[5654.96s] pretty damn constructive so uh biotech
[5657.92s] earnings I think this is going to be an
[5659.44s] area of opportunity this has been slow
[5662.32s] coming but when it&#39;s when it comes in
[5664.159s] this group it comes all at once and the
[5665.679s] last big move by the way was in a
[5667.84s] similar period to what we&#39;ve been
[5670.32s] talking about Um, with China 2016 to
[5675.36s] 2018 off the lows, more than double in
[5677.36s] the index
[5678.6s] index, 150% move in a year and a half. I
[5682.159s] think we&#39;re kind of set up for something
[5683.6s] like that right now with all the
[5685.04s] pessimism around the group. Uh, and uh,
[5687.84s] we&#39;ll be very excited to see that
[5689.36s] finally start to manifest, but so
[5692.719s] earnings are down across, but that&#39;s
[5694.48s] kind of Oh, one of the
[5697.32s] things there was a chart showing
[5702.32s] the number
[5706.679s] of anyway the number of biotech
[5710.76s] stocks now trading. Let&#39;s see
[5714.76s] here. I got to I got to actually pull
[5717.28s] this one
[5718.12s] up. All right. So, here&#39;s the chart I
[5720.639s] want to show you on biotech that we
[5722.719s] missed in the earlier. Biotech trading
[5725.44s] below cash are at an all-time high. The
[5727.6s] number of biotechs trading below cash
[5729.04s] has spiked since year end 2024 and
[5732.08s] reached an all-time high of 133 in March
[5735.4s] 2025. Uh number of biotechs trading
[5737.92s] below cash on a percentage basis. More
[5739.92s] than 20% of biotechs are trading below
[5742.32s] cash i.e. liquidation value uh percent
[5745.679s] of biotech
[5747.48s] subcache. I mean this is unbelievable.
[5749.92s] This is another generational thing.
[5751.76s] Sentiment has gotten so extreme. We
[5754.4s] should probably have more exposure here
[5756.239s] because this this type of stuff happens
[5757.92s] once in a
[5759.159s] career. Um, so, uh, thanks for Stephen
[5762.0s] for sending that over. Appreciate
[5764.679s] it. All right, we got
[5767.719s] that. Oh, insider buying in VF
[5770.88s] Corporation. Brack and Daryl Abishek
[5773.6s] Dalmia and Richard Karuchi uh CEO, COO
[5777.679s] and director collectively purchased a
[5779.52s] total of
[5780.44s] $185,000 shares of VF Corp with prices
[5783.44s] ranging from 1173 to 1205 per share. The
[5786.239s] total out-of- pocket cost for these
[5787.679s] purchases was $2.2 million. So while
[5790.719s] everyone was selling down from 29 down
[5793.36s] to 12 on tariff fears and the people who
[5795.92s] have the most perfect information were
[5797.44s] buying every share they could get a hold
[5798.96s] of as were
[5800.44s] we.
[5803.239s] Um okay as far as data the big thing
[5806.4s] tomorrow is going to be
[5809.08s] the core PCE and PCE. Trump met with
[5813.36s] Powell today and said I want rates
[5814.96s] lower. Trump said um you know pound
[5817.119s] sand. Let&#39;s see what the inflation
[5819.04s] numbers look like tomorrow. Maybe
[5821.119s] there&#39;ll be some additional pressure,
[5822.4s] especially after these employment
[5824.639s] numbers today were a little bit weak. Uh
[5826.8s] continuing claims were higher than
[5828.6s] expected and
[5833.08s] um initial jobless claims were higher
[5835.6s] than expected,
[5840.679s] etc. Earnings estimates are holding up
[5843.04s] at 265 and 300. I think they&#39;re going to
[5845.92s] actually reacelerate. Most people are
[5847.52s] calling for the opposite. We&#39;ll see what
[5849.679s] happens. With that said, we&#39;re done with
[5851.92s] the podcast part of the podcast. We&#39;re
[5853.679s] now moving on to the ask me anything
[5855.52s] questions. And I have to warn you, we
[5857.36s] have more questions than I&#39;ve ever seen.
[5861.199s] So stay for as long or as short as you&#39;d
[5863.84s] like. But there are a lot of good
[5865.119s] questions and a lot of good companies
[5866.719s] that we&#39;re going to discuss. So stick
[5868.639s] around if you can. And if not, we&#39;ll see
[5870.56s] you next week, same time, same place.
[5872.8s] I&#39;m in California for the next few
[5874.719s] weeks. So excited. uh before going back
[5876.719s] to New York the end of June. Uh so let&#39;s
[5880.639s] see
[5882.119s] here. Ah that&#39;s the problem. I need to
[5885.04s] get to the
[5886.44s] inbox. All
[5901.639s] right. Uh okay. So Joe Cook asks, &quot;Happy
[5905.36s] Thursday. Thanks for everything you
[5906.48s] share on Leaps and Baba and then Ant
[5909.84s] Group has an IPO. Will that be good,
[5911.44s] bad, or indifferent for Leaps holders?&quot;
[5913.6s] Uh what may or may not happen with
[5915.679s] LEAPS? Uh look, LEAPS, you have a you
[5918.4s] know any options held in the US, you
[5920.4s] have a risk. It&#39;s a risk we&#39;re willing
[5921.76s] to take because we have so much stock.
[5923.36s] Even if the options go to zero, we&#39;re
[5925.199s] going to make enough bags on the stock
[5927.76s] that it will more than make up for it.
[5929.6s] But if you only own options, then you&#39;re
[5931.36s] just being a gambler. And you know, you
[5933.52s] still have D-listing risk. You still
[5935.44s] have uh all that. As it relates to Ant,
[5938.639s] we own 35% of the equity in Ant. So
[5943.36s] um that will just acrue to the value of
[5946.719s] Baba which should push the value andor
[5949.199s] price of we own the stock in Hong Kong
[5952.48s] 9988 up and uh commensurately the uh
[5957.719s] Baba shares andor options related to the
[5961.44s] shares in the US to the extent that they
[5963.52s] stay listed. We have made progress on
[5965.92s] the talks with China. Therefore, I do
[5968.159s] believe that it&#39;s un it continues to be
[5970.639s] unlikely that it&#39;s delisted, but it&#39;s
[5972.48s] not zero risk, which is why we pushed
[5974.08s] all of our shares into Hong Kong as a
[5976.28s] hedge. Uh, and that&#39;s that. But the ant
[5979.92s] factor is not an issue as it relates to
[5982.159s] that. It should be a net
[5985.32s] positive. Okay, next one. Thank you for
[5988.8s] the question.
[5994.08s] Nick Davies asked me to play golf in the
[5996.4s] UK. I don&#39;t have any plans to go to
[5998.48s] London, but I might have to go to
[6000.239s] Portugal this August. So, uh, in which
[6003.04s] case, um, I&#39;ll probably find a way to
[6005.119s] slip through based on the courses that
[6006.719s] you listed in your email because they&#39;re
[6008.96s] once in a lifetime courses. Uh, okay.
[6011.84s] AMA question for podcast. Love the cast.
[6014.32s] Tune in every week. Wonder if you take a
[6016.08s] look at Lionel Basil. I like the whole
[6018.159s] group. I think we covered it last week,
[6020.32s] so I&#39;m going to spend two seconds on it,
[6022.0s] but the short answer is it&#39;s definitely
[6025.119s] warrants a deep look. We don&#39;t have any
[6027.28s] position and probably don&#39;t intend to,
[6030.0s] but we do have some position in, uh,
[6033.119s] related companies. So, um, this one I
[6036.719s] think we didn&#39;t get excited about
[6038.159s] because cash flow hasn&#39;t really
[6039.52s] confirmed anything other than prices
[6041.36s] down for a reason, but I do think that&#39;s
[6043.6s] at a cyclical trough and you&#39;re probably
[6045.44s] spot on there.
[6047.96s] Um, okay. Got
[6051.4s] Nick, Evore, FMC, and Dow. Same thing.
[6055.84s] We&#39;ve covered these. We like them both.
[6058.32s] Uh, definitely weren&#39;t
[6060.119s] doing more work, but I think this these
[6062.719s] groups are going to start to recover
[6064.159s] abruptly. Chemical and A related
[6068.199s] names. Um, Dow I was less confident in
[6071.92s] than
[6072.76s] FMC, but let&#39;s just take a quick look.
[6077.36s] I think Dow might have a little more
[6078.96s] trouble.
[6081.159s] Let&#39;s Yeah, Dow&#39;s still negative cash
[6083.679s] flow, free cash flow. So, I want to see
[6085.36s] that start to inflect, but
[6087.719s] FMC looks a lot more promising if I
[6091.719s] recall. Yeah, they&#39;re cash flow
[6094.08s] positive. They&#39;re they&#39;re in just in a
[6095.76s] cyclical trough. I I kind of like that
[6097.76s] one. So, good work. Uh let&#39;s move on to
[6100.96s] the next one. Tom Florence. What other
[6104.88s] energy names besides CRK are interesting
[6107.04s] to
[6108.04s] you?
[6109.73s] [Music]
[6111.239s] Um, none yet. They haven&#39;t come down
[6114.0s] commensurate to the price. So, we&#39;ll
[6116.0s] keep looking. I think we&#39;re more
[6117.44s] interested in the servicesers. There&#39;s
[6119.04s] going to be a question on Hallebertton
[6120.719s] if gun to our head if we had to buy
[6122.56s] something more than that. Bottom line is
[6124.96s] I don&#39;t need to own everything. I, you
[6126.56s] know, when I size a position, we&#39;re
[6128.08s] we&#39;re we&#39;re trying to own 8 to 12
[6130.0s] companies in a portfolio. So if we got
[6132.719s] exposure, we&#39;re already, you know, if
[6135.119s] it&#39;s an 8 to 10% position, we&#39;re already
[6137.119s] overweight. And then because it&#39;s gone
[6139.04s] up three bags, it&#39;s making a bigger and
[6140.88s] bigger weight on the portfolio. So we
[6143.199s] have enough energy exposure. We&#39;re not
[6144.639s] in a rush. And that&#39;s that&#39;s a you know
[6147.04s] I got a portfolio in today and they aed
[6151.36s] or last week they aed the portfolio in
[6154.679s] and there were like a hundred different
[6157.28s] positions in the portfolio like you know
[6160.56s] it&#39;s so guys do your work on a handful
[6165.44s] of companies and just own a concentrated
[6168.08s] portfolio of things that you know
[6169.52s] backwards, forwards, upside down and
[6170.96s] sideways. You can&#39;t be competent in that
[6174.08s] many things and that&#39;s
[6177.08s] that you don&#39;t have to be involved in
[6179.6s] everything. If you get a handful of good
[6182.159s] decisions, you&#39;re going to do extremely
[6184.32s] well and know everything about it. So
[6186.96s] just ignore the noise, own a handful of
[6189.679s] good companies and you&#39;ll be very very
[6191.28s] happy.
[6195.239s] Okay, trades and then how
[6198.76s] to Okay, so York is asking questions
[6201.52s] about trading. So York, you&#39;re obviously
[6203.44s] brand new, younger kid in college
[6206.32s] looking for uh trading
[6213.56s] advice. Puzzled by VF Corp&#39;s move up
[6216.4s] only on disclosure of inside buying. I
[6218.32s] mean, $2.5 million is serious buying
[6220.4s] when the stock&#39;s down that much and you
[6221.92s] see insiders write a check from their
[6223.84s] own pockets of multi-million dollars.
[6226.239s] That&#39;s that&#39;s pretty important. So, uh,
[6229.6s] why why were banks surprised? Banks
[6231.6s] weren&#39;t surprised to see anything. The
[6233.04s] market saw that as a vote of confidence
[6234.56s] for management. The underlying stock
[6237.199s] price got too despondent in the short
[6240.48s] term relative to the underlying
[6241.92s] fundamentals, which haven&#39;t really
[6243.199s] changed. And uh, and that was the move.
[6245.84s] So, uh, I think you&#39;re overthinking
[6247.36s] that, York, but it&#39;s a great question
[6248.96s] and and there&#39;s your answer. Uh,
[6251.119s] Lachland
[6252.199s] Neo, thoughts on CK Hutchinson Holdings,
[6256.92s] uh, triple01
[6271.08s] HK. Let&#39;s see.
[6291.88s] H generating a lot of
[6294.52s] cash, low multiple. What do they do for
[6297.119s] a living? Let&#39;s see here.
[6319.8s] Industrials investment holding company
[6323.119s] ports and ports related services
[6324.719s] infrastructure telecom mainland China
[6332.32s] 5% yield. I mean, this is the problem
[6335.199s] and this is why there basically only a
[6337.36s] handful of companies will ever would
[6339.04s] ever consider owning in
[6342.6s] China on on p. There&#39;s going to be so
[6345.119s] many companies on paper that look
[6346.96s] incredible in China that turn out to be
[6348.639s] disasters. I I I don&#39;t think this is
[6350.88s] where you want to play. I think you
[6352.239s] basically want to own Alibaba or
[6354.0s] 10-centent. The reason I didn&#39;t like
[6355.6s] 10-centent is I don&#39;t like the gaming
[6357.04s] business. The government generally hates
[6358.96s] it. They&#39;re allowing it to happen right
[6360.719s] now just because they need China tech to
[6362.639s] recovery recover. But their fundamental
[6364.719s] view is that it&#39;s a bad thing for
[6366.48s] society and eventually they&#39;re going to
[6368.0s] come after it once they have the runway
[6370.0s] to do it. So Baba has the most outs most
[6372.0s] opportunities and the most things that
[6373.28s] government wants to promote right now.
[6374.719s] So just keep it simple. Mirror don&#39;t
[6377.84s] take country and company risk. You&#39;re
[6380.0s] taking country risk with China. It&#39;s a
[6381.92s] communist government. So you don&#39;t want
[6383.44s] to take country and company.
[6386.159s] Baba, as goes Baba, so goes China. So,
[6388.96s] you know what I said when Baba was down
[6391.04s] in the 60s and 80s is we&#39;re buying it
[6393.199s] because as as bad as Xihinping&#39;s
[6396.48s] decisions have been around uh policy and
[6399.679s] around its actions towards uh Alibaba,
[6402.719s] it&#39;s mutually assured destruction. If he
[6405.119s] destroys Baba, he destroys himself and
[6406.8s] he&#39;ll be carried out on a stretcher by
[6408.56s] another Tianan square. So, he blinked.
[6410.639s] He blinked a year past what we thought
[6412.4s] he would blink. he could take a lot more
[6413.92s] pain than we anticipated. But sure
[6415.76s] enough, as you saw social protests uh
[6418.239s] going up in terms of instances on the
[6420.48s] chart, which we tracked every single
[6421.84s] week. Uh eventually he finally blinked
[6424.159s] when he realized his power was at stake.
[6425.84s] So now he&#39;s full throttle because he
[6427.52s] realizes he&#39;s got to take things to the
[6429.36s] promised land and he doesn&#39;t want 20%
[6430.96s] unemployment among 25year-olds who are
[6432.96s] educated and angry. So he flipped it. He
[6435.679s] started massive stimulus. It&#39;s now c
[6437.679s] catching traction and it&#39;s going to be
[6439.44s] straight up over the next two years.
[6441.719s] Milan
[6447.239s] Kersner, high turnaround Tom. I&#39;ve been
[6449.52s] following you for three years now and
[6450.639s] shared your podcast with me with with my
[6452.0s] family members. Just want to say thank
[6453.119s] you for your amazing podcast. Well,
[6454.4s] thank you. More I listen, more I realize
[6456.08s] you&#39;re you&#39;re a Buffett in the making.
[6458.56s] Okay, there will only be one Buffett.
[6460.32s] So, very kind words. Uh but no one&#39;s in
[6463.92s] that category at all. Uh I&#39;m unique in
[6466.56s] what I do with turnarounds. is probably
[6468.0s] closer to what he did when he was
[6469.199s] running outside money with partnerships
[6470.96s] than what he did uh once he had a
[6472.719s] permanent capital vehicle, but um
[6475.199s] grateful for the kind words. Generous
[6477.04s] with your time and share your knowledge
[6478.32s] for free. I&#39;ll be a future client of
[6480.32s] yours soon. Thank you, Tom from Canet.
[6482.159s] Okay, no question there. Well, Milan, I
[6484.159s] think you&#39;re going to be a client sooner
[6485.36s] than you know. Very grateful for the
[6486.96s] kind words and it&#39;s nice to hear that
[6488.4s] because we put a lot of work into these
[6490.4s] every single week. Uh Jim Jeff, thanks
[6494.32s] for your time. Listen to the podcast and
[6495.84s] shared with friends for years. Thank
[6497.04s] you. By the way, if you&#39;re not a client
[6498.8s] and you don&#39;t do any business with us,
[6500.48s] that&#39;s absolutely fine and great. We&#39;re
[6502.48s] we&#39;re happy to deliver this value. The
[6504.32s] only thing we do ask is if you are
[6506.0s] getting value and you think this would
[6507.44s] benefit anyone in your sphere, friends
[6509.28s] and family who love the markets, please
[6511.6s] share the free podcast with them. They
[6513.84s] will get value. Pay it forward and good
[6516.56s] things will happen. So, very grateful
[6519.119s] for that. Um, feel like we talked about
[6522.08s] this back in October 2023. What do you
[6523.76s] think about IFF after its slump back
[6525.84s] towards the 5year low? I have been
[6528.48s] looking at it. I&#39;ll be honest. I&#39;m not
[6530.4s] going to I&#39;m not going to say anything
[6532.88s] one way or another. We don&#39;t own any
[6534.239s] shares yet, but um it&#39;s one that we are
[6540.04s] exploring because it does have a moat in
[6542.92s] its own little niche and uh it&#39;s in a
[6547.44s] cyclical
[6548.52s] trough and it&#39;s got runway. Uh, and we
[6553.119s] just want to have a little more clarity
[6555.28s] with the turnaround
[6558.679s] plan and make sure it&#39;s a a temporary
[6561.36s] versus a permanent impairment. But I
[6562.88s] think you&#39;re spot on with that one.
[6564.08s] Absolutely think you&#39;re spot on with
[6565.679s] that one and uh warrants much further
[6568.32s] work.
[6572.36s] Goran story
[6575.719s] chick this week I started position what
[6578.08s] seems to be an emerging turnaround story
[6579.92s] Cleveland cliffs because their dominant
[6582.48s] position US automotive industry
[6584.719s] electrical AI transformers will benefit
[6587.199s] for increased domestic auto production
[6590.639s] uh cost cutting steps another turnaround
[6592.96s] stories
[6594.639s] uh all right let&#39;s take a look I don&#39;t
[6596.719s] really like this name but let&#39;s take a
[6598.92s] look historically I It just tends to
[6602.239s] chronically
[6613.08s] fail. You&#39;re probably going to be right.
[6615.119s] I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re going to be right
[6616.0s] from $8 or $4,
[6618.04s] but it is a cyclical stock. Let me just
[6620.719s] see if it&#39;s got the runway and it&#39;s not
[6622.639s] going to risk getting stopped
[6624.679s] out. Yeah. No, not for me. This needs to
[6628.56s] change. I need to see some positive free
[6631.04s] cash flow and evidence of a turnaround,
[6633.52s] not a gamble on a turnaround. Let me
[6635.28s] just see. Maybe maybe they&#39;ve done that
[6636.88s] on a quarterly
[6639.8s] basis. No, there&#39;s still negative free
[6642.32s] cash flow. I I don&#39;t like it yet, but
[6645.44s] I&#39;ll keep an eye on it and I like the
[6647.04s] way you&#39;re thinking, but uh too early
[6648.719s] for
[6649.56s] me. All right, next. Tim
[6654.199s] Sanders, thanks for sharing your
[6655.92s] insights on the stock market. Always
[6657.119s] appreciate. Love to get your thoughts on
[6658.159s] Builder as a potential housing recovery
[6659.76s] play. Uh yeah, let&#39;s take a look. BLR. I
[6663.84s] feel like we did this one
[6677.0s] recently. Yeah, revenues and cash flow
[6679.52s] still going down consistent with the
[6681.199s] price as are margins. Let&#39;s take a look
[6684.4s] here.
[6691.159s] Yeah, this is not for me. I mean, this
[6693.76s] is this is
[6694.84s] one I mean, this has already had a 200
[6697.679s] bag, so the fact that it&#39;s down
[6703.239s] 50%. I mean, if you get it perfect,
[6706.32s] you&#39;re going to get a double, uh, but
[6708.159s] you might get hurt. This this is a
[6709.679s] momentum this is a broken momentum stock
[6711.76s] at this point and I&#39;m not seeing trends
[6715.679s] start to move back in a positive
[6717.199s] direction after 200 bags. I&#39;m going to
[6718.96s] just pass for now. Play it better
[6720.96s] through Brad Jacobs. You know, you&#39;re
[6723.52s] buying
[6724.92s] Brad at the beginning stages of growth
[6727.44s] down here and not the ending stages
[6729.04s] after you&#39;ve had a run up. So, it&#39;s
[6730.96s] probably a good business. Let me just
[6732.639s] take a look
[6735.159s] here. It it there&#39;s just not enough
[6737.28s] margin of safety. If I could be down 50%
[6739.76s] or up a double, I I don&#39;t like that one
[6741.92s] to one. I need to be, you know, down 30%
[6744.4s] or up 3 4x for me to risk real capital.
[6748.8s] And this is just not giving me the
[6750.32s] riskreward that I&#39;m looking for right
[6751.679s] now. And I don&#39;t see a reaceleration of
[6753.76s] trends yet. Uh, and historically, it
[6756.239s] hasn&#39;t been a great business. So, I&#39;m
[6757.599s] going to just leave that one there. Uh,
[6760.48s] theme is right, execution, expression is
[6763.04s] wrong. How do you feel about Campbell
[6764.4s] versus Hormell? Uh, I don&#39;t like
[6766.48s] Campbell. We covered
[6770.119s] that. Uh Frank
[6793.32s] Brown rocket mortgages. Yeah, I think
[6796.48s] this is better quality than United
[6798.639s] Wholesale Mortgage Corp. Let me just
[6800.8s] take a look at
[6806.199s] it. You You definitely can win on this
[6809.28s] when the game comes back. So, it&#39;s
[6811.679s] consistent with the
[6813.239s] theme.
[6820.28s] Uh yeah, it hasn&#39;t turned yet, but it
[6823.119s] will. This is just a gamble on the
[6824.719s] theme, a leverage gamble on the theme. I
[6826.32s] think that one&#39;s probably the better
[6827.599s] play than you, United Wholesale Mortgage
[6830.239s] Corp. So, you&#39;re probably right there,
[6832.159s] Frank. I don&#39;t love it. I&#39;d rather just
[6833.679s] play it through the way I have it
[6834.8s] expressed than, you know, focus on that.
[6838.4s] Um,
[6863.199s] Yeah. So, this guy&#39;s talking about, you
[6865.04s] know, cash on the sidelines is not an
[6867.199s] indicator because when you take the cash
[6869.04s] to buy stock, the seller gets the cash.
[6870.96s] But you&#39;re missing the whole point. The
[6872.8s] point is
[6875.239s] that when risk appetite is on, the
[6878.4s] seller then takes that cash and
[6879.88s] reinvested in in more stock and there on
[6885.08s] balance more risk exposure is taken in
[6887.92s] across all asset classes and the asset
[6891.04s] class of money markets is diminished
[6894.4s] which is the measurement that we&#39;re
[6896.0s] referring to. So um and then you take
[6900.239s] another step in terms of margin that is
[6903.679s] being drawn which is also at lower
[6905.599s] levels which is also uh a sign of risk
[6909.599s] aversion that has a lot of capacity left
[6912.32s] to be uh much more buying power that
[6916.92s] then there&#39;s a lot less margin drawn and
[6920.96s] higher cash balances than you would
[6922.719s] ordinarily see any time near where at
[6925.92s] levels you see closer to bottoms than
[6927.599s] you see closer to tops is the right way
[6930.0s] to interpret it. But thank you for the
[6932.56s] question. Welcome to the podcast. On to
[6935.199s] the next. Rory McMullen, what&#39;s your
[6937.76s] opinion on SMR play? So
[6941.0s] headlines, price goes up, everyone
[6943.76s] chases Chinese shiny object. I would say
[6947.96s] um it&#39;s fine for now. It&#39;ll probably go
[6950.88s] higher.
[6952.719s] get interested when everyone forgets
[6954.32s] about it and it drops 30 40% and that&#39;s
[6957.04s] not the way I would play
[6961.32s] um small modular re reactors. I&#39;d play
[6965.28s] it with bigger companies. I like their
[6967.679s] CEO buying balance sheet looks okay. BY
[6971.599s] that&#39;s from Eric Klein. B Y O
[6985.4s] N
[6988.76s] beyond negative free cash flow,
[6991.199s] collapsing revenues, collapsing margins.
[6994.0s] What do you like about this
[6995.56s] again? What does this thing do?
[7004.239s] What is this? A website of the former
[7006.159s] Bed Bath and Beyond or something? I have
[7007.76s] no idea what this is. Beyond Inc.
[7010.0s] Where&#39;s the website? Let&#39;s see what they
[7012.28s] do. Yeah, Bed Bath and Beyond. So, okay.
[7014.88s] So, they bankrupted the the the brick
[7017.44s] and mortars. Now, they have a
[7019.4s] website. Um, look, on a chart basis, it
[7022.32s] looks cyclical. It probably recovers,
[7024.88s] but on a fundamental basis, I can&#39;t put
[7028.4s] money to work here. I&#39;m not seeing any
[7030.08s] signs of a turnaround
[7031.56s] yet.
[7038.119s] Um, balance sheets probably clean
[7040.719s] because they went through bankruptcy.
[7042.32s] Let&#39;s
[7044.679s] see. Or at least the parent did. Let&#39;s
[7047.88s] see. Cash
[7051.0s] 159. Long-term debt zero. Yeah. So, this
[7055.159s] is new co, I guess.
[7067.04s] and free cash flow negative for three
[7069.48s] years. I don&#39;t know. This is a trading
[7071.92s] vehicle. This is not a good quality
[7076.199s] business. Revenues have been declining
[7078.84s] for six years. They can&#39;t even blame it
[7081.36s] on COVID. Oh, they had a peak, okay, in
[7084.56s] 2021 and then they&#39;ve cut in half. I
[7086.639s] mean, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re certain
[7088.719s] that this is the bottom, take a trading
[7090.56s] punt at it, but I I wouldn&#39;t touch it.
[7094.199s] Um, River, unless you clear, unless
[7096.639s] they&#39;ve laid out a turnaround plan, that
[7098.08s] makes an awful lot of sense and they&#39;re
[7100.239s] credible managers. I just I don&#39;t see
[7102.719s] it. River
[7107.0s] Rahhei been sharing with as many friends
[7109.84s] and family, but it&#39;s remarkable how many
[7112.0s] scare people get scared of two-hour
[7113.84s] podcast, video cast. So don&#39;t listen to
[7116.08s] two hours, listen to a half hour, get
[7118.0s] 25% of the value. What can I tell you?
[7120.32s] Listen to 10 minutes, get, you know, 5%
[7122.8s] of the value. Completely up to you. I
[7124.56s] give more than is expected of me. Uh so
[7127.679s] you could take or or leave as much as
[7129.679s] you want. But um anyway, listen to
[7132.32s] listening to your podcast for two hours
[7133.76s] every week has saved me years of work
[7135.599s] being closer to retirement. Appreciate
[7137.199s] all you do. So you&#39;re the one that
[7138.719s] benefits and the other ones that can
[7140.239s] take two. Look, I&#39;m condensing 80 to 100
[7142.8s] hours plus of manh hours worth of work
[7145.52s] per week into one or two hours. So, you
[7147.44s] decide if that&#39;s valuable to you. Uh,
[7149.76s] you know, uh, and, uh, and you know,
[7152.48s] based on the numbers that thousands upon
[7155.04s] thousands of people have found that
[7156.239s] that&#39;s valuable and, um, and we&#39;re we&#39;re
[7159.52s] glad to do it. But, you know, we&#39;d we&#39;d
[7161.84s] love to do 10 minute or 20 minute
[7163.679s] podcast. You&#39;re just not going to get
[7165.04s] any value. Uh, and it&#39;s kind of a waste
[7167.199s] of everyone&#39;s time. So fact of the
[7169.28s] matter is if you want results it takes
[7170.96s] time and it takes effort and there&#39;s no
[7172.48s] shortcuts. So the people looking for
[7173.84s] shortcuts go follow some trading guru
[7176.48s] blow up your account in six months and
[7178.239s] then two years from now you can come
[7180.08s] back after you missed one of the
[7181.36s] greatest opportunities to buy high
[7182.719s] quality businesses at low prices and you
[7184.96s] can learn it and four years from now
[7186.719s] you&#39;ll be a decent investor.
[7189.32s] Um, okay. So, his question is, can you
[7191.76s] take a look at Civvy?
[7197.96s] CIVI cash
[7202.36s] flow cash flow positive. What do these
[7205.04s] guys do? Guess is their
[7208.44s] energy. EMP lowquality EMP. Let&#39;s see.
[7220.239s] These type of guys scare the hell out of
[7223.04s] me. When you see a stock that&#39;s split
[7226.08s] adjusted from $5,000 down to six and
[7228.32s] then it&#39;s 10 bags. This is a this is
[7230.719s] scumbaggery at its finest. Anyone who
[7232.719s] did this kind of stuff to stock is it&#39;s
[7236.48s] it&#39;s just a maybe they&#39;ve changed
[7239.04s] management, maybe they&#39;ve done this or
[7240.719s] that, but for me, they don&#39;t get a
[7241.92s] second chance. Anyone that does that
[7244.48s] that type of value destruction to owners
[7247.52s] is
[7248.679s] uh belongs in the wall of shame and
[7251.28s] should never work as a public company
[7252.8s] CEO. So now it looks like they&#39;re
[7254.88s] recovering revenues. They&#39;re recovering
[7256.4s] cash. I&#39;m just not going to take a bet.
[7258.159s] Maybe it&#39;s if it&#39;s brand new management
[7260.4s] and the management is from a credible
[7262.239s] places, then fine, have at it.
[7264.32s] Understand the assets. Maybe it&#39;s a
[7265.76s] great opportunity. For me, I I don&#39;t
[7267.84s] like to play in those lowquality EMP
[7269.52s] names. It&#39;s just too
[7272.4s] I mean, with with with Comtock, I&#39;m
[7275.28s] betting with a proven winner. Like, I
[7277.52s] don&#39;t have to think about it. I And I&#39;m
[7279.28s] betting Perry Puer. I bought it
[7280.639s] basically at the same stock price that
[7282.08s] Jerry Jones owns 70% of the company. I
[7284.32s] don&#39;t have to think a lot. I mean, only
[7286.4s] the public markets can give you that
[7287.84s] opportunity. In the private markets,
[7289.36s] he&#39;d have 80,000 promotes ahead of me
[7291.599s] before I&#39;ve even made a dollar. Uh, the
[7293.84s] price would never get that lower because
[7295.44s] the offering would be so highly valued
[7297.92s] based on his name and his track record
[7299.76s] of success. That&#39;s why what I do is the
[7302.239s] greatest job in the world. It is nothing
[7304.08s] comes close. I see private market deals
[7306.4s] all there&#39;s nothing like what we do in
[7308.159s] the public markets. We benefit from the
[7310.719s] short-term voting machine of euphoria
[7312.719s] and dispondency and the price movements
[7314.96s] that that diverge dramatically from
[7317.44s] underlying intrinsic value. There&#39;s
[7319.52s] literally no game like it in the world.
[7322.199s] Um so that said, uh let&#39;s go to Theo
[7325.84s] Dmont.
[7327.84s] Theo Dumont, uh, Petershill
[7336.28s] Partners.
[7340.599s] Okay,
[7344.76s] Peter
[7347.239s] Shill. Okay, UK equity, that&#39;s kind of
[7350.8s] interesting to me. Cash flows declined
[7353.679s] along with stock price. Revenues are
[7356.639s] dimminimous. What? What the hell is this
[7359.08s] thing? Private equity firm. No way.
[7362.0s] Private equity firms are made up of
[7363.76s] sellside investment bank exelside
[7365.84s] investment bankers
[7369.4s] who historically have figured out a way
[7372.32s] to extract value versus trade value.
[7375.44s] It&#39;s nothing wrong with it. It&#39;s just in
[7377.199s] their DNA. They&#39;re extractors, not
[7379.04s] creators. And I just don&#39;t like the
[7381.04s] cultural fit. you know, ne never have I
[7383.28s] heard I invested alongside a sellside
[7386.08s] investment banker and got rich. I mean,
[7387.76s] it&#39;s just it&#39;s
[7390.159s] uh let&#39;s just pass on that. I appreciate
[7392.32s] the on paper you were right, but I&#39;ve
[7395.199s] been to this movie before. They will do
[7397.599s] well, you will not. Bob Atkins, I
[7400.08s] enjoyed your weekly video cast for
[7401.44s] months and appreciate your insight. Love
[7402.96s] that you put your family first. Admire
[7404.32s] that quality. Thoughts on Hallebertton
[7406.08s] as a drilling play? I think if I had to
[7407.76s] add another energy play gun to my head,
[7411.199s] which I don&#39;t, uh, this would probably
[7413.679s] be the first place I&#39;d look. And the
[7415.28s] second place I would look is, um,
[7418.32s] slumberj. I think that&#39;s the way to play
[7420.159s] it because if oil prices stay low, kind
[7422.719s] of like MLPS,
[7425.96s] but MLPS, you don&#39;t have a similar
[7428.44s] upside. Again, these just haven&#39;t come
[7430.719s] down enough for me to get excited. But I
[7432.239s] think Hallebertton&#39;s probably a better
[7433.679s] play. I think the cash flow is fine.
[7436.639s] think the revenues are fine. I I like
[7438.4s] it. I like it, Bob. Good. Good one. All
[7441.08s] right. Next.
[7445.32s] Um Jimmy Jones, Oscar Health. That&#39;s uh
[7448.719s] Kushner&#39;s brothers promote. Let&#39;s see.
[7452.0s] See, R. I think they&#39;re doing some
[7454.08s] interesting things there, but it&#39;s still
[7455.44s] like a speculative. Oh, no. They&#39;re now
[7457.92s] generating a ton of cash. Okay. Well,
[7459.84s] that&#39;s good. Um OSCR
[7470.32s] I mean, was this a spa? This might be
[7474.639s] It&#39;s funny. I was talking with some
[7476.239s] super incredibly smart people in Dubai
[7478.32s] and we were we&#39;re trying to brainstorm
[7480.84s] like quote unquote what&#39;s uninvestable
[7483.44s] now. And it&#39;s like quote unquote failed
[7486.48s] spacks. Like anything that was a spack
[7488.159s] has a stigma attached to it. Now, I
[7490.4s] think this might have been
[7493.32s] one. Um, this one you just really have
[7496.0s] to understand the business cuz like it&#39;s
[7497.76s] very hard to break into health care as a
[7502.119s] startup. Offers health plans to
[7504.08s] individuals, families,
[7505.48s] employers, health care system
[7511.0s] engagement. Enterprise value is 1.64
[7514.239s] billion. What are they doing in terms of
[7516.8s] business?
[7519.44s] It&#39;s a lot of cash they
[7530.52s] have, great balance
[7539.88s] sheet, billion dollars of free cash
[7542.159s] flow. Geez. All right. So, this is one I
[7545.44s] got to look at and understand the
[7547.04s] business cuz this is this is like a too
[7550.159s] hard pile, but it&#39;s kind of interesting
[7552.4s] given the players that are involved and
[7554.719s] how low the valuation&#39;s got. So, um so I
[7557.92s] think on the surface you&#39;re right, but
[7560.08s] now you got to really dig in and
[7561.36s] understand the business.
[7571.239s] Uh all right. So, uh, Agathan Rex, thank
[7575.76s] you for the long
[7580.76s] five-page analysis
[7585.0s] of carry trade and petro dollars and all
[7588.48s] that stuff, but there&#39;s nothing about
[7590.4s] that that gives me anything actionable
[7592.0s] about buying a piece of a business and
[7593.599s] making money on it. So, I&#39;m not going to
[7595.199s] spend time on it. This that&#39;s for some
[7597.4s] macro
[7598.92s] podcast pontificating about things that
[7601.44s] may or may not happen that have zero
[7603.28s] value on how we invest. Chris Booker
[7606.32s] Brooker uh Doc Martens docs. Yeah, I&#39;m
[7610.159s] seeing a lot of these stores pop up
[7611.599s] around here. Was that Fashion Island
[7622.599s] today? Dr. Martins
[7631.0s] plc. Wow, look at
[7633.88s] that. Revenues are down, cash flow is
[7636.84s] up.
[7644.36s] Docs, huh? Look at this thing.
[7650.0s] Why is this
[7665.8s] so see I hate these plays even like
[7668.8s] Crocs I can&#39;t stand because it&#39;s it&#39;s
[7670.56s] like a it&#39;s a bet on a fad persisting
[7673.52s] for longer than 12 to 24 months. It&#39;s
[7675.76s] why like VF Corp you got a lot of outs.
[7678.239s] this you&#39;re just betting on like are you
[7680.639s] at the end of the fad the beginning
[7682.159s] because it&#39;s cyclical. Doc Martens were
[7683.76s] big when I was young then no one would
[7685.199s] wear them for 20 years you know and it
[7687.44s] just keeps coming back.
[7694.28s] Um market cap 557 million
[7699.079s] pounds. What is
[7701.48s] the Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on here.
[7709.28s] Revenue is declining a little
[7712.44s] bit. What&#39;s happening to share account
[7716.84s] here? Share account&#39;s coming
[7721.48s] down. Balance sheet 140 million. How
[7725.52s] much
[7726.679s] debt? 300. It&#39;s kind of
[7729.8s] okay. Enterprise
[7733.96s] value 1.4. 4 billion. What kind of cash
[7737.28s] flow
[7749.639s] again? All right. Yeah, I just want to
[7752.0s] understand how sales are going to
[7753.88s] reacelerate.
[7758.679s] Um, but generally it&#39;s worth exploring
[7761.36s] and understanding the turnaround plan.
[7763.119s] How are they going to reacelerate sales
[7765.159s] cuz it looks okay. I I I I I&#39;ll probably
[7768.639s] never wind up in it just because you&#39;re
[7770.159s] betting on one brand and the the fads
[7773.119s] are too hard to predict. But you might
[7776.56s] have a decent enough margin of safety if
[7778.32s] you do the work. So,
[7780.599s] um, there you go.
[7783.239s] Uh, new client inquiry. Matt in
[7786.84s] NC
[7788.599s] says, &quot;Just a comment, no question. Why
[7790.96s] I need Tom Hayes managing my account? I
[7792.639s] work in a taxable account. I was going
[7793.84s] to have realized gains from all the
[7795.04s] successes I&#39;ve had using Tom&#39;s advice.&quot;
[7797.119s] Well, it&#39;s opinion, not advice.
[7799.72s] [Music]
[7801.0s] Um, so I thought I would get smart and
[7803.76s] sell my Advanced Auto Parts stock and
[7806.56s] options on 58.25 for $32 per share to
[7809.28s] actualize an offsetting loss with a plan
[7811.199s] to simply buy it back in one month on
[7813.159s] 692025. After all, this has been dead
[7815.679s] money for years. Also, just to be quote
[7817.44s] safe, I set a price at $34, figuring if
[7819.84s] it jumped, I&#39;d simply get back in and
[7821.36s] accept the wash sale. But, of course,
[7823.04s] the price gapped up from 32 to 44. Now,
[7825.599s] it&#39;s over 50, by the way. uh and marked
[7828.079s] open 521 up to 48 in a day and I missed
[7832.159s] the 50% move. Can&#39;t wait to hit the
[7834.56s] million-dollar mark and fork my money
[7836.48s] over to Tom. Avoid acting on bad ideas
[7838.639s] like this one. Thanks for all you do,
[7840.32s] avid listener now about four to five
[7841.84s] years. Yeah, man. It&#39;s Look, I
[7844.0s] appreciate that&#39;s very kind and you&#39;re
[7845.599s] right. I mean, I give you a tremendous
[7848.48s] amount of value, but at the end of the
[7849.679s] day, the intangible that makes all the
[7852.0s] difference is not knowing it
[7852.96s] intellectually. It&#39;s like it&#39;s knowing
[7856.079s] your strengths and weaknesses. It&#39;s like
[7857.76s] no one calls me up and they say, &quot;Hey,
[7859.84s] Tom Hayes is a great investor and he
[7862.159s] knows everything about business and
[7863.8s] financials. Let&#39;s call him up to be the
[7866.079s] CEO of a multi-billion dollar company.
[7868.079s] Maybe he can operate the whole
[7869.28s] business.&quot; It&#39;s like that&#39;s not, you
[7871.36s] know,
[7873.28s] uh you got to know your strengths and
[7876.719s] it&#39;s like the intangible, the ice in the
[7878.88s] veins, the turnaround time, the knowing
[7880.239s] what you own. It&#39;s like you can
[7881.92s] understand that intellectually, but you
[7883.36s] either have it genetically or you don&#39;t.
[7885.119s] And like 99.9% of the people like I&#39;m a
[7889.04s] genetic defect. Like God gave most
[7891.679s] people a FOMO gene. Fear of missing out.
[7893.92s] They got to be involved in everything
[7895.28s] because their neighbors getting rich on
[7896.88s] this. Their neighbor&#39;s getting I I
[7898.32s] didn&#39;t get the gene. Like you know the
[7901.76s] guy next to me could make 17 billion
[7904.079s] dollars on Bitcoin in a week. I&#39;d just
[7906.88s] be super happy for him. I wouldn&#39;t be
[7908.48s] like, &quot;Oh, I should have bought
[7909.44s] Bitcoin.&quot; Listen, that&#39;s not what I do.
[7911.28s] It&#39;s like, you know, it&#39;s like a
[7913.119s] professional hockey player. It&#39;s like,
[7915.199s] why why didn&#39;t I make 80 million as a
[7919.119s] professional basketball player instead
[7920.48s] of 8 million as a professional hockey
[7921.84s] player? It&#39;s just not what you&#39;re
[7922.8s] genetically designed to do. So, um, you
[7927.04s] kind of acknowledging that is is smart.
[7929.28s] And that&#39;s 99% of the people. Honestly,
[7931.52s] the smartest people in the world are not
[7934.56s] the the the the people like me. It&#39;s the
[7937.04s] people who build businesses, sell them
[7940.8s] for hundreds of millions or billions of
[7942.4s] dollars, and then hire a guy like me to
[7945.28s] grow it for them, and they sit on the
[7946.88s] beach, and they play golf, and they they
[7948.4s] enjoy their life, and they don&#39;t have to
[7949.76s] think about this. This is 247 thing. You
[7952.0s] got to be thinking about all the time. I
[7954.48s] mean, and and in order to do it and do
[7956.48s] it well, you have to love it. And you
[7958.4s] have to be a genetic defect that is
[7961.119s] actually wired to do well from this type
[7963.04s] of business. Because what makes most
[7964.88s] businesses work and most entrepreneurs
[7966.719s] rich is the exact opposite of what makes
[7969.28s] one successful in this business. In the
[7971.28s] real world, as an entrepreneur, you get
[7973.679s] paid for massive action equals massive
[7975.599s] results. Fail fast, keep going. Fail
[7977.76s] fast, keep going. Fail fast, keep going.
[7979.52s] In the investing business, it is exactly
[7981.44s] the opposite.
[7983.119s] thoughtful, diligent work, make a couple
[7985.599s] smart decisions, sit on your hands and
[7988.159s] have the discipline not to get faked out
[7990.56s] uh until you realize intrinsic value.
[7992.4s] Why? Because you know the underlying
[7993.679s] business, you know the trends, you&#39;ve
[7994.96s] done the work, etc. And that&#39;s just like
[7997.36s] just very few people are genetically
[7998.88s] wired that way. So, uh the value is in
[8001.76s] understanding it intellectually and then
[8003.44s] being extra smart like Matt and saying,
[8005.92s] you know what, I&#39;m going to go build a
[8007.119s] fortune, build a build a couple
[8008.48s] businesses. You know why so many people
[8010.48s] get rich in real estate? Yes, it&#39;s t tax
[8012.48s] tax advantage, but more than that, they
[8014.32s] can&#39;t sell. They don&#39;t have daily
[8015.52s] liquidity. If they get a headline that
[8016.96s] says pending sales are down, they can&#39;t
[8018.48s] flip out of 16 apartment buildings. They
[8020.8s] just have to hold through it until the
[8022.56s] next cycle and then they hit the window
[8024.079s] and they, you know, make many times
[8025.84s] their money because they are forced
[8027.76s] holders versus easy sellers in the in
[8030.88s] the euphoria and dispondency of the
[8032.4s] voting machine that is the stock market.
[8034.159s] So, uh, really brilliant insight there
[8036.719s] and you&#39;ll be there faster than you
[8038.639s] know. Max Hughes, what do you think of
[8042.199s] ADM? Archer Daniels
[8044.679s] Midland. I think I&#39;ve been looking at
[8046.8s] this one a little bit. I think you&#39;re
[8048.079s] probably right there. If I&#39;m not
[8049.599s] mistaken, this is a dividend aristocrat
[8051.92s] and we&#39;re at the bottom of the cycle
[8053.44s] like the
[8055.639s] FMC&#39;s. We were going to go through
[8057.599s] commodities. We don&#39;t have enough time.
[8060.04s] Um, yeah, I just want to see a little
[8062.4s] bit of improvement on the free cash flow
[8066.639s] before we go hand over fist. But I think
[8069.119s] you got a decent enough margin of safety
[8071.199s] here and it&#39;s a good enough durable
[8072.88s] business that
[8077.32s] um I mean if you got if you got blessed
[8080.079s] and could get it with a threehandle, you
[8081.84s] should try to do that. I&#39;d be in no rush
[8083.76s] to jump here and I&#39;m totally happy to
[8085.679s] miss this one and I probably will, but I
[8088.719s] think you&#39;re generally spot on. I just
[8091.36s] cautious on that free cash flow. Let me
[8093.76s] just see what the balance sheet looks
[8096.44s] like. I mean, businesses have been
[8098.56s] around for decades. It&#39;s just a question
[8099.84s] of runway. So, the balance sheets a
[8101.52s] little weaker than it was. Let&#39;s take a
[8104.079s] look at the
[8105.88s] debt. Yeah, they&#39;ll probably still be
[8108.32s] okay, though. It&#39;s just never been an
[8110.88s] extraordinary business. But I Yeah, I
[8114.239s] think with something like this, you put
[8115.44s] a $40 alert. If you get a 30 high30
[8118.239s] handle, you probably buy a little bit
[8120.0s] and start to do the work uh and start to
[8122.88s] do the work in the
[8124.36s] meantime. I think you&#39;re generally
[8126.32s] right. The question is what at what
[8128.4s] point and when and is it the highest and
[8130.96s] best use of capital? And I think for me,
[8132.96s] it&#39;s not the highest and best use of
[8134.32s] capital. Hi Tom, love all your videos.
[8136.239s] Watching everything you posters.
[8137.44s] Appreciate sharing your knowledge. Uh,
[8139.599s] new
[8141.159s] core steel stocks generally suck. Um, I
[8145.199s] think we even covered this last week. I
[8148.079s] don&#39;t think it&#39;s come down enough. Just
[8150.159s] a simple answer for my appetite.
[8154.32s] these things the these are the
[8156.239s] definition of not
[8160.04s] only I mean it&#39;s the best in the
[8163.239s] bunch but I mean I don&#39;t think relative
[8167.52s] to the way revenues margins and cash
[8169.76s] flow have fallen I don&#39;t think the stock
[8171.52s] has fallen enough yet so I&#39;m going to
[8173.04s] pass and if it gets lower I&#39;ll revisit
[8176.599s] it Dennis
[8179.96s] Amato have been listening to your
[8181.679s] podcast for the last couple months
[8182.719s] believe your
[8184.76s] value has
[8187.32s] been value approach is quite sound. I
[8190.159s] think you&#39;ve stated a couple times that
[8191.28s] you&#39;re beginning to look for ways to
[8192.24s] play energy. Was wondering what you
[8193.439s] think of
[8194.519s] Halmerick and Payne HP. Yeah, I&#39;ve
[8197.92s] looked at this one.
[8199.8s] Um I think this falls into the
[8202.319s] Hallebertton category, but Hallebertton
[8204.16s] is a better
[8207.719s] play, higher quality.
[8215.2s] Yeah, I think on this one you want to
[8216.88s] kind of start to see
[8218.599s] that cash flow
[8221.8s] turn. Yeah, I I think you just want
[8226.439s] to you&#39;re probably okay with this one. I
[8229.12s] I would rather see you in Hallebertton
[8231.599s] to be honest with
[8235.719s] you. This is unreal.
[8239.639s] Frank Penbert, hardest lesson you&#39;ve
[8242.08s] ever learned in your investing career.
[8243.28s] Don&#39;t chase shiny objects. Payton
[8251.24s] Hops, love your deep value approach in a
[8253.76s] world of cookie cut investments. When it
[8255.439s] comes to com resources, you called the
[8257.12s] relative bottom. What signals are you
[8258.399s] looking for to start eyeing an exit
[8259.92s] reducing your position? How much does
[8261.599s] the Ukraine Russia war ending or tariff
[8264.399s] trade deals change the future demand of
[8266.399s] natural gas? I that&#39;s excuse me
[8269.359s] that&#39;s noise I can&#39;t I have no control
[8272.399s] over I could care less about that as far
[8274.319s] as the intrinsic value of the stock
[8275.84s] we&#39;ve covered it in the past uh proven
[8278.639s] plus unproven 15 years of unproved
[8281.359s] reserves that&#39;s not recorded on the
[8282.88s] balance sheet PV10 is the only thing
[8284.96s] reported to the SEC the answer is a lot
[8287.359s] higher it&#39;s been a triple I think it
[8289.76s] could
[8291.08s] probably almost double from here
[8296.12s] Um, so that means it&#39;ll probably be when
[8299.92s] all is said and done at least a 56
[8304.84s] bagger. All right, next.
[8308.84s] Um, Han
[8318.599s] Jancock. All right. So, he&#39;s saying,
[8320.719s] &quot;Should I buy QXO now that it&#39;s run from
[8323.04s] 13 to 18 or whatever it is? You say you
[8325.359s] never buy on on green days.&quot; Uh, hope
[8328.08s] you don&#39;t hate abstract questions. I do
[8330.0s] hate abstract questions. We&#39;re here to
[8331.359s] make the listeners money, but I
[8333.519s] appreciate you sending the question. The
[8335.439s] answer is I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know.
[8337.04s] Like, uh, new money in today. Am I
[8340.12s] buying QXO up, you know, 50% in a month?
[8345.2s] Probably not. I&#39;m probably going to look
[8346.639s] for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet.
[8348.24s] And maybe if it gets back to 15, put
[8350.8s] some money to work there. But
[8353.96s] um yeah, look, if you&#39;re okay buying it
[8356.319s] at 18 and it goes to 10 before it goes
[8358.479s] to 80, then you should buy it today.
[8361.88s] Um so I don&#39;t have a good answer for
[8364.16s] you, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice
[8365.519s] today. Let&#39;s just put it that way. Cork
[8370.28s] Snider, start my bike ride from San
[8372.8s] Francisco to San Diego for mental health
[8375.28s] May 30th. got a large sponsorship for
[8377.2s] the cause in Tevaarmacies. What are your
[8379.28s] thoughts on that? Teva is a
[8383.319s] generic. That business has been
[8385.399s] decimated and I think it&#39;s finally
[8387.76s] recovering after all the lawsuits and
[8389.439s] everything else. Um, it&#39;s up a lot
[8391.92s] already, but it probably has more room
[8394.0s] to run. It&#39;s not my first choice of
[8396.16s] highest and best used, but I think it&#39;s
[8397.92s] higher uh and maybe materially higher 3
[8401.12s] to 5 years from now if you&#39;re going to
[8403.359s] play generics. And this falls into
[8405.76s] healthcare bucket. This is probably a
[8408.56s] decent spot to start. So, good one,
[8411.479s] Cork. Uh, good luck. And then,
[8417.479s] uh, Nick Hill Jane Vistry Group UK Home
[8423.93s] [Music]
[8425.479s] Builder. Let&#39;s take a look.
[8444.64s] Yeah, I think this checks a lot of
[8446.0s] boxes, but again, I&#39;d rather
[8449.24s] play the arms dealers than the waring
[8452.8s] factions cuz their
[8455.319s] margins this is I mean this is probably
[8459.12s] fine. Let me just check the balance
[8460.8s] sheet
[8472.439s] here. Yeah, I I think you&#39;re
[8482.12s] okay. I think decent play. It&#39;s a good
[8485.2s] find. Just get a little comfortable with
[8487.12s] the turnaround story and you&#39;re fine.
[8489.6s] So, nice find
[8491.16s] there. I&#39;d rather play the home
[8493.2s] builders, but the home the building
[8496.08s] suppliers, but as far as that goes. It
[8498.72s] checks enough boxes. I like it. Thanks
[8501.2s] for
[8501.96s] sharing. Well done on the money show.
[8504.24s] Really nice presentations, keynote. Nice
[8506.24s] work, team. All the update. Big kudos.
[8508.72s] Thank you.
[8511.56s] Uh, if you could only pick one of Brad
[8514.24s] Jacobs businesses gun to your head,
[8515.68s] would you go for GXO or QXO? Uh,
[8518.64s] probably QXO. I think GXO is probably a
[8521.28s] triple or
[8525.479s] quadruple. I&#39; I&#39;d say no. I would say
[8528.72s] it&#39;s probably a triple from here,
[8531.439s] whereas QXO from where we bought it is
[8533.68s] probably a seven bagger. Uh, it&#39;ll just
[8537.04s] take longer. So,
[8539.359s] uh, guns not to my head. I don&#39;t have to
[8541.12s] pick one. That&#39;s why I own
[8542.92s] both. And, uh, I&#39;m happy with that
[8545.76s] decision.
[8547.72s] Quack, should the J Japan bond market be
[8550.72s] something to worry about? Well, we were
[8552.16s] talking about that all last year. So,
[8553.84s] you&#39;re a little late on that because the
[8556.24s] draw down in MAG 7 as a result of that
[8558.56s] already happened. Now, they&#39;re going to
[8560.08s] bounce back to the top of the range. So,
[8561.68s] yeah, continue to keep an eye on that.
[8563.28s] But
[8564.68s] um it all it predominantly is going to
[8567.6s] affect is the high concentration in mag
[8569.68s] 7 which it already has. Uh Sebastio
[8573.72s] Pinero, my name is Sebastio. I&#39;m a huge
[8576.08s] Portuguese fan of yours. That&#39;s great
[8577.359s] because I&#39;m half Portuguese and uh own
[8579.92s] some land over there. You once responded
[8581.359s] to a comment of mine about the great
[8583.359s] golf courses here in Portugal and I was
[8584.96s] very glad to learn about your connection
[8586.16s] to my country. Sending you this message
[8587.84s] to ask you about Sovice Energy and
[8590.479s] Biomarin. Ooh, he&#39;s sneaking in too with
[8592.96s] all
[8593.88s] that sweet talk. All right, you&#39;re going
[8597.04s] to get away with it, my man. My
[8599.359s] Portuguese brother here. Uh, so the
[8603.28s] problem with Sovous is it&#39;s a lower
[8604.88s] quality
[8606.439s] EMP. For me, it&#39;s not the highest and
[8609.04s] best use. It hasn&#39;t come down enough
[8610.72s] relative to the operating leverage and
[8612.72s] probably the leverage in the balance
[8614.08s] sheet. Uh, so no, I wouldn&#39;t play that
[8616.72s] one.
[8617.96s] um it&#39;ll probably be okay, but for me it
[8620.96s] hasn&#39;t come down enough relative to the
[8622.399s] low quality of a business it is. Uh
[8624.96s] which can catch cyclical turns.
[8627.2s] Biomarine I think is a better play. You
[8629.359s] just have to understand the pipeline
[8630.72s] well enough, but um I do think you want
[8634.08s] to get some. We don&#39;t do individual
[8636.88s] names in biotech, but this is more of an
[8639.76s] established farmer
[8641.88s] company. Kind of looks like Biogen a
[8644.88s] little bit.
[8646.359s] Um, I think this is one that&#39;s on our
[8650.439s] target that if we did go into an
[8653.12s] individual farmer stock, this would be
[8655.52s] high on the
[8656.68s] list. Just it takes a lot of work on the
[8659.2s] pipeline and everything else to get
[8661.6s] confidence, but I think you&#39;re
[8662.8s] definitely on the right track and
[8665.56s] um probably do fine with that. That
[8668.08s] could be a double for you.
[8670.439s] Um,
[8671.96s] next, Adam
[8688.84s] Dyer. All right. He&#39;s asking all about
[8691.04s] the SLR, rates, currencies, all this
[8693.359s] stuff. It&#39;s nonsense. Pick a business
[8694.8s] that generates free cash flow that&#39;s
[8696.479s] growing. The weaker dollar will be a
[8698.399s] tailwind. related to your question, but
[8700.16s] Adam, you&#39;re complicating things and
[8701.92s] focusing on the things that don&#39;t matter
[8703.52s] and not enough time on the things that
[8705.12s] do matter. The underlying business, the
[8707.12s] free cash flow, the revenue growth. Stop
[8709.12s] worrying about all the macro noise that
[8711.28s] you can&#39;t. Yeah, we have a view that
[8712.8s] rates might do this and the dollar might
[8714.399s] do that, but it&#39;s unrelated to the the
[8717.84s] equities.
[8719.52s] The equities are
[8724.12s] trading the micro kind of gives us the
[8726.96s] view of the macro, not the macro giving
[8728.72s] us the view of the micro. It starts with
[8731.2s] the business. It starts with the bottoms
[8733.04s] up and then you say, well, why did the
[8734.64s] price get so derated and then you start
[8737.12s] to see, well, it&#39;s because of this
[8738.479s] condition and this condition. Well, are
[8740.24s] those conditions at an extreme enough
[8741.6s] levels that they could inflect and and
[8744.08s] create a an unnatural tailwind for the
[8746.96s] business which is naturally improving?
[8749.04s] Yes. So, that would be a double
[8751.68s] tailwind, but the business has to have
[8753.68s] an intrinsic tailwind and that stuff is
[8755.6s] just kind of noise that takes you out of
[8757.52s] the field. Um, QXO launch. Okay, so he&#39;s
[8761.52s] asking about the offering. Here&#39;s the
[8762.72s] bottom line. All you need to know about
[8764.399s] QXO because people keep asking me about
[8766.319s] the
[8769.64s] offering. Brad Jacobs put $150 million
[8772.479s] of his own money at QXO when it was in
[8774.8s] the hole. Okay.
[8777.0s] QXO
[8778.76s] 2000, not
[8780.68s] QXO,
[8782.2s] XPO
[8785.319s] 2011. I don&#39;t know if it was 2009 or
[8787.68s] 2011. It doesn&#39;t matter. Bottom line is
[8790.24s] stock was an 80 bagger or 160 bagger
[8793.12s] depending when he put it in. I think it
[8794.319s] was 2011 whatever. Okay. He&#39;s put in
[8798.479s] $900 million of his own
[8802.6s] money before I did. Okay. So any follow
[8806.479s] on
[8807.72s] offerings he
[8810.12s] thinks are
[8813.319s] beneficial at the price and for the
[8815.6s] reasons and in the structure that he&#39;s
[8817.52s] done. he thinks that his 900 million
[8820.08s] investment will be better off in the
[8822.08s] future than it is today by doing the
[8825.52s] offering. So on that basis, considering
[8828.0s] he&#39;s got meaningfully more skin in the
[8830.319s] game than I do, uh, and he&#39;s got a
[8833.359s] proven track record of doing this five,
[8835.28s] four, five times, um, I&#39;m supportive of
[8839.84s] any offerings that he does at the right
[8841.84s] price, especially when the stocks move
[8843.76s] so much in such a short period of time,
[8845.28s] it&#39;s already absorbed it and they&#39;re
[8846.56s] going to use that thing for creative
[8847.84s] acquis acquisitions now that they have a
[8849.84s] platform company and they did it in the
[8853.359s] convert. I I like how he did it. I like
[8856.24s] why he did it. But as far as what do I
[8857.76s] have to worry about, uh he&#39;s got 900
[8860.24s] He&#39;s got, you know, 800 million more
[8862.8s] reasons to worry than I do. Uh and um
[8867.12s] you know,
[8869.0s] so I would just trust the process with
[8871.439s] Brad Jacobs and not overthink that. This
[8873.68s] is not some scumbag that&#39;s paying
[8875.52s] getting paid a million dollars and
[8877.12s] sucking a million dollars of options out
[8879.52s] of the company and has no net worth and
[8881.439s] is just a salesman running a company.
[8883.52s] This is a guy who is a principal
[8885.52s] investor alongside with us and happens
[8887.84s] to have opera operating prowess and a
[8890.88s] history of creating wealth for his
[8892.24s] owners, namely himself as the biggest
[8894.479s] owner and all the other folks that are
[8897.359s] lucky enough to ride along with him and
[8898.96s] let him do all the work and make us tons
[8900.64s] of money. So, uh, for me, I&#39;m 100%
[8903.439s] supportive of that. Longtime listener,
[8905.6s] this is Martin
[8909.8s] Griswaski Grias
[8914.28s] Suski Global
[8916.6s] Payments. No. Lower quality than
[8921.479s] PayPal. This thing has always had hair.
[8924.56s] I don&#39;t like it as much. I think it&#39;s
[8928.88s] probably works. Let&#39;s just take a look
[8930.88s] at some of the financials. I would stick
[8933.04s] with PayPal.
[8945.359s] I forget what the hair was in this
[8947.479s] business. Something I&#39;ve hated about it
[8950.0s] from the
[8951.72s] past. Software solutions.
[8963.52s] Yeah,
[8965.319s] I I don&#39;t think this has as much of a
[8968.24s] margin of safety. Let me just take a
[8970.0s] look here.
[8997.12s] 15 billion of debt, two billion of
[9000.12s] cash. It&#39;s a lot more leverage than
[9004.92s] uh it&#39;s never really compounded money at
[9007.76s] a decent clip. This is a lower quality
[9010.399s] business. I I I don&#39;t want to own this
[9011.84s] relative to if that&#39;s the choice, you
[9013.76s] own PayPal. There&#39;s no question. It&#39;s
[9015.359s] not even in the same neighborhood. Like
[9017.359s] could you make a a trade off of this
[9020.319s] lowquality business for a double? Maybe,
[9023.04s] but PayPal&#39;s a whole different game,
[9025.359s] whole different leadership, whole
[9026.88s] different plan, whole different
[9029.08s] stronghold. Um,
[9031.88s] okay. Uh, Griffin Brown, hope you had a
[9035.2s] great trip. Have you ever built a
[9036.319s] position based off a listener&#39;s idea?
[9039.16s] Um, not yet, but a lot of good ideas are
[9042.479s] coming in, so could could happen sooner
[9045.359s] rather than later.
[9052.92s] Sada. What is this? A beating down chip
[9069.72s] play sensors central
[9073.479s] resolutions
[9077.16s] performance.
[9079.08s] Um, so this is like a chip autoplay.
[9082.88s] kind of like this one for a double. Let
[9084.64s] me just make sure you&#39;re going to be in
[9086.12s] business. Take a look at the balance
[9088.08s] sheet
[9099.64s] here. Generating free cash with balance
[9103.72s] sheet. $600 million of
[9107.0s] cash. $3 billion of debt. They brought
[9110.08s] it down a little bit.
[9115.72s] Um yeah, look, I think if you can
[9118.319s] understand the
[9121.24s] business, understand how this topline
[9123.76s] number is going to
[9127.96s] reacelerate. Share counts coming down. I
[9130.24s] I think you&#39;re probably okay
[9132.12s] there. Got to understand it a little bit
[9134.399s] better, but I think you&#39;re I think
[9135.52s] you&#39;re on track there.
[9138.04s] Um good good one, Griffin.
[9143.52s] Daniel
[9146.84s] Garner from a Money Show Miami follower.
[9150.72s] Hey Tom. Uh, French luxury
[9153.319s] LVMH. Yeah, this is a high quality
[9155.68s] business. Let&#39;s just take a look here.
[9172.479s] I mean, this this is definitely
[9174.0s] compounder. It&#39;s not for me, but I think
[9178.08s] if you own this
[9181.24s] thing for a
[9183.479s] while and you&#39;re not worried about short
[9186.56s] term, I think long term you&#39;re going to
[9187.92s] make good money with
[9190.52s] this. I have to produce for my investors
[9194.56s] in a reasonable amount of time, 24, 36
[9197.6s] months, meaningful production. And I
[9200.24s] think this is going to be a longer term
[9201.92s] play from these levels, but
[9206.04s] um I think it&#39;s a good
[9208.439s] business and will continue to be a good
[9210.8s] business. So cash flows kind of been
[9213.319s] flat for the last 3 four years after
[9217.12s] spiking a lot in COVID. They&#39;ve been
[9218.56s] able to retain those levels. Margins
[9220.96s] seem
[9235.56s] okay. This is all blocked out. Let me
[9238.24s] just see if I can get rid of net debt.
[9258.8s] the cash flow is totally
[9261.399s] recovered. Let&#39;s take a look
[9265.64s] here. These got hit with China.
[9271.0s] So revenue peaked, it declined. Let&#39;s
[9274.8s] take a look at quarterly. See if it&#39;s
[9276.24s] starting to come
[9277.56s] back. It&#39;s been managed well because
[9279.92s] despite the revenue
[9282.2s] decline. Yes. So 3Q. What? Where the
[9285.52s] hell? Hold on for a
[9290.6s] second. Okay. The quarterly is not
[9292.88s] active. All right.
[9296.28s] ROIC cash flow.
[9305.12s] And what a balance
[9308.12s] sheet. Well, 42 billion of debt, net
[9311.28s] debt. All right. 42 billion. 14 billion
[9313.52s] of
[9318.92s] cash. Take a look at the share account.
[9337.84s] Yeah, I don&#39;t think you really go wrong
[9339.76s] with this.
[9352.04s] Um, I think you&#39;re right, Daniel. I
[9354.56s] think it&#39;s great. I think it&#39;s a good
[9356.0s] price. A great business at a good price.
[9358.72s] I tend to like good businesses at great
[9361.12s] prices. So, you know, Buffett evolved. I
[9363.92s] have not, you know, but when Buffett was
[9365.92s] managing outside money in his
[9367.12s] partnerships, he like he liked, you
[9368.72s] know, good businesses at great prices.
[9370.88s] And then, you know, he says that uh
[9373.28s] Munger convinced Munger didn&#39;t convince
[9375.359s] him to do anything. He was always always
[9377.439s] running the show. And what what changed
[9379.84s] was not Munger whispering in his ear
[9382.0s] because Munger was whispering in his
[9383.359s] ears when they were both running
[9384.56s] partnerships. What changed was he went
[9386.8s] from having um uh outside partnerships
[9390.08s] where he had to produce outsized returns
[9392.24s] in a relatively short period of time, 24
[9394.56s] 36 months to a permanent capital vehicle
[9396.88s] where he had free float coming in every
[9398.72s] single month, more than he could
[9400.0s] possibly invest. And uh he wanted to be
[9402.64s] in long-term compounders that he could
[9404.08s] just set and forget. And if they, you
[9405.84s] know, like uh BYD he bought in 2019 had,
[9409.359s] you know, five 50 to 80% draw downs
[9412.16s] before 2020 when it went up 12x in one
[9414.56s] month and then the IRRa over 11 years
[9416.479s] made sense. If you&#39;re managing outside
[9417.92s] money, you can&#39;t do that. So, um I think
[9420.479s] if you&#39;re just buying this as an
[9421.84s] individual and you&#39;re not accountable to
[9423.359s] anyone but yourself and you&#39;re, you
[9425.28s] know, 50 or younger, like, yeah, this
[9427.84s] thing&#39;s going to compound over time and
[9429.439s] it&#39;s going to benefit from the China
[9430.8s] recovery. And I think this is a
[9432.56s] no-brainer. I mean, uh, I absolutely
[9435.52s] love the idea and, uh, uh, well
[9439.08s] done.
[9442.04s] Okay, got that. We&#39;re done. We&#39;ll be
[9445.84s] back next week. Same time, same place.
[9447.6s] In the meantime, make it a great one.
[9449.2s] Bye for now.
