## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
Hayes believes the market is poised to move higher, driven by deregulation, a recovery in housing, and easing capital rules. He anticipates a weaker dollar, benefiting international markets and China. He sees potential for a significant rally in small caps and emerging markets. He expects rates to go down this summer with the SLR.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| S&P 500 Debt | Record Lows | Companies have so much room to lever up. When Bessant gives them the green light this summer with the SLR and brings rates down, you are going to see huge huge refinancings, borrowings, deals, everything happen all at once. |
| China Business Confidence | Record High (May 2025) | Growth expectations have now shot through the roof. You haven't seen these levels in years. |
| US Equities Rolling 10-Year Return | 13% | So we can stay up at these levels for a pronounced period of time. |
| Healthcare Market Cap as % of S&P 500 | Lowest since 2001 and 2011 | Those type of divergences are generational opportunities. |

## Featured Company Deep Dives
### Alibaba – High Conviction
Alibaba is poised to benefit from China's economic recovery, government stimulus, and its leading position in e-commerce and AI. Xi Jinping is now helping his country versus hurting his country. Alibaba is a toll taker for domestic consumption.

**Key Metrics:**
- 40% of China's e-commerce market
- Leader in AI
- $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet
- $20 billion of free cash flow

**Valuation / Target:** N/A
**Action:** Buy

### QXO – High Conviction
QXO is set to benefit from the home building boom, driven by Brad Jacobs' leadership and his strategy of rolling up the home building supply sector. Brad Jacobs is a money maker. This guy earns for his shareholders.

**Key Metrics:**
- Brad Jacobs' track record of creating wealth
- Roll-up strategy in an $800 billion industry
- Jacobs put a billion dollars of his own money in QXO

**Valuation / Target:** 6-7-8 bagger from these levels

### Intel – Medium Conviction
Intel is a turnaround story led by Lip Bhutan. If he gets the fabs right and catches a couple lucky breaks which this guy has a tendency to do I do think it could be a four or five bagger and your downside's largely predicted if they liquidated the whole thing today.
