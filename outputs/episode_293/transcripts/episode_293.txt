Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 293rd videocast podcast for the week ending May 29th, 2025. Got a lot to cover today, but as always, family first. So, Mimi completed her first year at 68 Water Polo Academy and can&#39;t wait to return in the fall. Annabelle swam in the Speedo Grand Challenge where she discovered a new best event, the 200 IM uh individual medalley. She won the 200 IM at the meet with a time of 23129, beating some nationally ranked 12y olds and smashing her own Nova team record by 2.73 seconds. Uh so this was Irvine Nova Aquatics uh congratulating her. Super proud. Great job. Awesome as always. Uh did some channel checks at Irvine Spectrum. We went to see obviously uh sent the kids to see Lilo and Stitch on Memorial Day. So, they got to contribute to Walt Disney&#39;s earnings uh which we own a significant stake in. And uh Caitlyn and I saw Mission Impossible. First time in a movie theater for a long time. Really enjoyed that. Unfortunately, that&#39;s paramount and we don&#39;t own any, but we just simply enjoyed the show. I was surprised because we got out of the movie theater. It was like 9:00 on Monday night and I walked by Vans and Vans was packed and maybe this has something to do with it. These low profofiles. Two of the girls were buying these. That&#39;s a new product. And then this I haven&#39;t heard anything about, but I almost bought these. And I may go back and get these brown ones. Um already have three pairs of Vans in my closet, but they&#39;re called the Curran. C U R E N. And I thought these were super cool. Um, so yeah, I might have to go back and get those. Uh, you can see here more of a crowd doing my channel checks. Uh, this is my wall of flags. When I go to special golf courses, I like to buy a flag. And this week I or last week, I got to play Emirates Golf Club in Dubai. Absolutely incredible time with my host, Phillip. Uh, we&#39;ll show you some pictures there in Ah, there they are. Okay. Uh, that&#39;s Phillip in the middle. The Emirates Golf Club was truly spectacular. It was a little warm this time of year, but uh it was good to work up off some of those beautiful breakfast buffets and and lovely dinners, etc. Uh David and I are wearing the hedge fund tipped hats. Uh and uh Philip informed me, he&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, you know, it is close to summertime in Dubai. Black is not the most reflective color.&quot; He was smart enough to wear a white hat. That&#39;s part of the city in the background there. Super cool time of my life. Then I went on a mini tour the last day. Went to the top of the Burj Khalifa which is on top of the Dubai Mall is at the bottom. The Dubai Mall is uh nothing like I&#39;ve ever seen before. I kind of joke now people say how was Dubai? I said well the streets are paved in gold and the opportunities are unlimited. Uh and uh that&#39;s the the model in the base. And then uh oh and then um I did a a presentation for the YPO. Um shout out to my friend Adam Johnson who was on Fox Business all the time. He introduced me to Craig Bridgeman who asked me to do a presentation to the Dubai YPO group. And then a couple of the members uh that&#39;s Craig, that&#39;s his wife. Uh that is uh Amin Malmuk. He&#39;s doing an incredible um it&#39;s like a live streaming commerce site. He went to Harvard Business School. He worked for Amazon before. And then Abdullah M. uh Alisram hosted us at the arts club. We&#39;re very very grateful that for that. I&#39;ll see you when you&#39;re in California. Uh just an incredible time. They they just kept bringing courses and courses and we were sharing business anecdotes, talking markets, just a wonderful uh dinner. And then um I guess more pictures from the top of the Burj Khalifa. Uh yeah, like a kid, I was excited. This is the mall. It&#39;s the most unbelievable thing. I brought my host, uh Philip&#39;s incredible wife, Tammy, uh chocolates from Seas Candies. And in the US, you know, you can kind of get them different places, but really you you mostly get them either in airports or in the state of California. Buffett owns it, obviously. Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway, they had tried to expand into other states in the past, but there was this special feeling in California. So, they just stayed concentrated in California. So, when I go places, you know, I I I sometimes try to bring people seas because it&#39;s not something they can get every day and it&#39;s a really spectacular uh candy. And uh so so uh they were they were so hospitable. Number one, Tammy brought my bought my daughter&#39;s Dubai chocolate and not just any Dubai chocolate, the best Dubai chocolate and like six different variations. It was just unbelievable. Brought it home, by the way. Traveled perfectly in my golf case in the cargo cargo section of the plane. Uh came back, wasn&#39;t melted at all. I guess it gets pretty cold down there. Um so, uh so yeah, I brought seized candies and thinking like, wow, this is something they can&#39;t get in Dubai. And of course, I&#39;m in this mall, which I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my life. Four stories, like probably goes for a mile. Every possible highest end everything you could ever imagine, every brand under LVMH, every Hermes, etc. And then as I&#39;m walking to the entrance to the Burj Khalifa to get to the top of the tower for my tour, like any good tourist, uh, what do I see? Seas, candies. I mean, you can&#39;t make this stuff up. So, of course, I had to text Philip and say, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I thought it was a special gift, but apparently there&#39;s nothing you cannot get in Dubai.&quot; So, uh that was an eyeopening experience. That&#39;s a special market that I got to go to and and see all the local merchants. Uh really got the girls some really cool stuff there. Thanks for Charlotte for putting that all together. Was a special special time. Also, pictures are starting to roll in from all the amazing amount of support and orders we&#39;ve gotten for the hedge fun tips merch. The golf polo is actually very popular. Uh, and the hats and actually everything, the mugs, the t-shirts. Uh, so here&#39;s the first few pictures. Obviously, we were wearing our hats. Then, uh, uh, Rob Klopper, I think I covered last week, John uh, Janick, Jim Gelb, Cork Snyder. If you remember Cork, I went to go speak to his students in uh uh Westminster High School. Uh anyway, uh he&#39;s the AP stats teacher and uh uh he got a t-shirt. Looking good there, Cork. And he&#39;s doing this long bicycle ride this weekend uh for charity. So, good luck with that. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be great. Uh and that is it on the pictures. Let&#39;s get down to business. First and foremost, uh had the pleasure to join Jared Blickery and Sydney Freed on Yahoo Finance. Uh stocks in translation, a 20 minute uh kind of podcast back and forth. Lot of really good points covered here about Moes, about themes, about companies, etc. Want to especially thank Taylor Smith Cloier for having me on. We&#39;re gonna listen in here. Welcome to Stocks and Translation broadcasting from the New York Stock Exchange. I&#39;m Jared Blickery, your host. And with me as always is the voice of the people, Sydney Frerieded. First, please like, subscribe, and comment on Stocks and Translation on Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon, or YouTube. And today we are welcoming back Tom Hayes. He is the chairman and manager of Great Hill Capital. He is a veteran value investor with over two decades of experience spotting market turnarounds in tech, banks, energy, and now housing. And today we&#39;re going to be talking about the great value renaissance. A phrase coined many moons and shows ago. Our word of the day is moat. Designed to keep out invading armies and today they repel competitors. So which castle is Tom investing in? And this episode is brought to you by the number 7.5. as in years. That&#39;s how long Realtor.com says it will take America to build enough homes to finally close in the housing gap and fix the housing shortage. And Tom has some stock picks to potentially make it worth your while. So before we dig in, Tom, uh let&#39;s talk about the most recent market action. You&#39;re a value investor. You like the booms and the bust, and we just had one. What are you swimming in here? I call it the big beautiful dislocation. You had uh $1.2 two trillion dollars of forced sales in the hole from hedge funds and CTAs at the beginning of April. And then President Trump put out his tweet, &quot;Now is a good time to buy stocks and the market&#39;s up.&quot; And did you uh not only did we, we were buying, we did a conference call for our clients the day before because people were really worried, right? There it looked like there was no B. And we went company by company. We went through balance sheet. We went through uh income statement. We went through free cash flow. And what we saw with invariably was all these metrics are going up. What&#39;s going down? the price based on based on the short-term noise. Long-term, they&#39;ve got the moes in the business. Even if the worst case scenario tariff scenario came to pass, these would be the biggest players and they&#39;d pick up share from the smaller players that were hit the hardest. And that&#39;s why a moat is so critical. You know, this leads to our word of the day. Thank you for that, Tom. Perfect segue. A moat is a longlasting competitive advantage. Uh so, so think a castle moat like a safeguard uh to a firm&#39;s profits. So Warren Buffett hunts these kinds of corporate defenses and we have a few oracle quotes now to set the mood here. In 1991 he gave a lecture in front of Notre Dame and he said the most important thing in evaluating businesses is figuring out how big the moat is around the business and what you love is big capital and a big moat. So is that what we&#39;re seeing here in some of the names that you&#39;re looking at and who has them? There&#39;s no question. I mean sometimes you have a monopolistic moat like Boeing has a duopoly with Airbus. That was not a hard one to figure out. It dropped down to $129 uh in the most recent sell-off. Uh it&#39;s very simple. If you want to go to Airbus, that&#39;s fine. You just have to wait 20 years for your next plane. So, that&#39;s an easy one. Then you have brand modes like Buffett invested a lot in Coca-Cola in 1989, 1990. Uh now his dividends each year are bigger than his original basis because they keep increasing the dividends. It has that brand mode. It has the distribution mode. So, we look for businesses like that. uh and and brand modes and we&#39;re going to talk about a few few names like the Stanley&#39;s, like the DeWalts, like uh some of those companies in the housing sector that um people have been using these tools for generations upon generations and they&#39;re not going to go to the second best because they don&#39;t last uh and they don&#39;t have that same type of brand uh credibility. So, it sort of sounds like if you have a popular brand or it&#39;s a popular company, you have a moat. But that doesn&#39;t feel right. Like is any famous stock have a mode or no? That&#39;s not how it works. Well, I look Apple I was gonna say Apple Apple has a brand mode. It has an ecosystem mode. It kind of built that monopolistic app store which they continue to to throw arrows and he continues to create relationships with administrations and the arrows keep hitting the wall. Uh that&#39;s protecting the moat and Tim Cook has done an incredible job at protecting that moat. Proctor and Gamble for years had moes around Tide. That&#39;s been kind of diluted a little bit with the Kirklands of the world, etc. So, you have to constantly be on top of the moat. You have to constantly analyze the moat. But, uh, but the key is to start with a business that has a mode because if the mode is there, you&#39;re marginous and you buy it at the right time. If the mode is there, uh, you can you can make it through tougher times, the cyclical downturns, and you come out stronger because in cyclical downturns, the smaller players with the weaker moes go out of business and you pick up share. I want to get back to a name you mentioned a couple minutes ago, Stanley Black &amp; Decker, because this hit my list Monday morning. We had, and we&#39;re taping this the week after the latest tariff dant, and um, that morning I was looking pre-market at all the companies in the S&amp;P 500, who was leading. Stanley&#39;s at the top of the list. It&#39;s like 12 15%. I hadn&#39;t looked at this stock in years. What&#39;s going on there? Uh they have an absolute moat and they&#39;re highly correlated to the home building industry. Okay. So they have DeWalt. Okay. They have Stanley, they have Craftsman, they have Black &amp; Decker. So if you think about construction, if you think about projects, if you think about lower interest rates, which spurs the the former, uh uh it&#39;s a huge leverage play on the recovery of construction, which is going to h come in the back half of the year. And that&#39;s the back half of the show and the back half of the show. Uh one of you know, everyone&#39;s focused on the Fed. Uh what they need to be focused on is what Besson is going to do uh with capital requirements with banks, the SLR. So he&#39;s going to and the SLR the liquidity ratio. Exactly. So what the the case they&#39;re making is government backs stop securities i.e. treasuries, mortgage back securities shouldn&#39;t be counted differently because there&#39;s no credit risk. And if they agree to that, which is common sense because if there becomes credit risk, then we got a lot more to worry about than bank capital ratios. Um that will enable banks to hold a lot more. And they&#39;re going to hold a ton on the short end of the curve, which the Treasury then can then use those proceeds. If you remember 2012, I know Sydney&#39;s out. I mean, this goes back to Basel 3. That&#39;s what it I mean, doesn&#39;t this remind you of Basel 3? No, it reminds me of Basel 3. All right. We&#39;re on the same page. So, so they can use those short-term proceeds uh to reinvest on the long end of the curve, which is expected to bring 10-year treasuries down 30 to 70 basis points, which means a 30-year fix for the for the woman on the street. 30-year fixed rate below six. When that happens, boom times. Boom time. I We know that President Trump wants lower mortgage rates. And so part of that is I&#39;m asking is that part of the Mara Lago accords? Because there are more there&#39;s more to it than just that there&#39;s other countries buying US century bonds. That&#39;s 100-year bonds to bring down long-term interest rates. But I hadn&#39;t really I I hadn&#39;t read that particular facet before. So that&#39;s interesting. Yeah. Uh the Mara Lago accord was was predominantly uh rumored in the first quarter of this year which was a currency reset like you saw in Reagan&#39;s second term. I I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s fully on the table yet. Uh it&#39;s it&#39;s implicitly on the table because as China does a deal. So China knew the tariffs were coming. So what did they do ahead of time? They just devalued their currency by 20%. Tariffs were kind of in that same neighborhood. And as the deal is set, part of the deal is going to be get your currency back to normal. That balances out trade. So there there&#39;s implicit. Will there be an explicit meeting where you have eight parties together and they uniformly devalue the dollar? Breton Woods. Exactly. Um uh Plaza Accord. The answer is we don&#39;t know. But the trend of the dollar is right now you&#39;re going to have a counter trend bounce because everyone was bullish on the dollar. Now that the dollar&#39;s fallen a lot, everyone&#39;s bearish. So you get a count get a counter trend uh bounce. But the trend intermediate trend is down. That&#39;s going to help earnings. that&#39;s going to help all the things that we&#39;re talking about here with everything going on right now. We still don&#39;t have, you know, a lot of solid trade deals. How are you thinking about the market in terms of, you know, companies with a moat in terms of sectors? What do you like? Uh, you know, we&#39;re seeing stocks come back to where they were like a month ago before a lot of this happened. 500 positive on the Exactly. So, what what are you liking right now as still as we&#39;re navigating this uncertainty? Yeah, I think if you look at equal weight versus cap weighted S&amp;P, the valuation for equal weight is one standard deviation below its long-term average, which which in English means it&#39;s cheap. Okay. On a multiple basis, 493 is cheap. 493 is cheap. So, you have to continue to look there for the Stanley Black &amp; Deckers, which are part of that 493. Uh I think we&#39;re going to talk about a couple other uh housing stocks as well. Um there&#39;s just a lot to do. the the companies that were most impacted by tariffs, which by the way was Boeing, uh, or the fear of the worst case, that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to find your biggest opportunity. I think the Mag 7 will rebound, a tradable rebound, but we can&#39;t overlook the fact that their earnings power has decelerated from 33% down to 16% and maybe a little bit lower. And that&#39;s part of the reason you&#39;ve seen what they&#39;ve done because when you think about tariffs, like how does that really affect Google when they&#39;re not in China, you know, uh, and so on. So, so they&#39;ve come down relative to their earnings power. The amount of capex that they have to spend to stay competitive to keep share has impacted their earnings has also crowded out their ability to buy back tons of stock. Uh, whereas the 493 announced record buybacks in the first quarter in the face of all this uncertainty, 665 billion. Um, talk to me about China real quick before we go to break. We&#39;ve talked about Alibaba in the la the last time we were here. That is, you know, it came up, it came down, but it&#39;s it&#39;s held on. What do you like about China now? Uh, what I like is that Xi after enough of social unrest and 25% uh youth unemployment got his act together about a year ago. Xi gets it. Xi Jinping got his act together. Uh, has done massive stimulus. he&#39;s now helping his country versus hurting his country, you know, soldering them in their apartments. That didn&#39;t work. Uh, and people got tired of it after 3 years. So, uh, you&#39;re seeing global M2 money supply start to hockey stick. And a good portion of global M2 money supply is China&#39;s new stimulus which started in the last 12 months. He&#39;s committed to taking the c country to 70% consumption like the rest of the developed world. Uh Alibaba&#39;s got 40% of the e-commerce market. They are a toll taker for domestic consumption. So they&#39;re going to benefit from that. They&#39;re going to benefit from being the number one player in AI. They have a piece of all the AI startups because as the number one cloud provider, new startup comes in, they say, &quot;We need compute power.&quot; They say, &quot;No problem. I got you covered. I&#39;ll give it to you for free.&quot; And we&#39;ll take a piece of your business and a peek at your business, too. We&#39;re going to take a peek and a piece. Uh we&#39;re going to get equity. So you have equity in all the Chinese AI startups. Some are going to be thousand baggers and some are going to be zeros. Uh Alibaba takes a piece. Alibaba takes a piece. It&#39;s the granddaddy. It&#39;s like the c It&#39;s like the casino owner versus the blackjack player. They get a piece of all the action on the retail on the AI and their models are outperforming Open AI. Their models are outperforming DeepSeek. Their international e-commerce is growing at 40%. They got $80 billion of cash on their balance sheet. They&#39;re generating $20 billion of free cash flow. What else do you want to know? Yeah, as long as Jack Ma doesn&#39;t get Mo Greens. Yeah, that&#39;s bad. Um, oh, and by the way, Ant Financial, the Chinese tech crisis started with the pulling of the Ant Financial, it was supposed to be the biggest IPO ever. It&#39;s going to happen in the next 12 months, and we own 35% of that as owners of Alibaba. We own the stock shares in Hong Kong, 9988. You can uh switch out your US shares if you&#39;re worried about D-listing. I think it&#39;s a lot of noise, but as a fiduciary, I want to protect my investors. Sure. Uh we own we still own derivatives in the US because we can&#39;t replicate them in Hong Kong and we&#39;re willing to assume that risk. Wait, how do you um how do you move shares from international to US listed? Depends on your uh custodian, but you can call them and they&#39;ll just swap out because there&#39;s no currency risk. It&#39;s 8 to1 peg to the dollar. So you&#39;ll get eight eight more shares per every one US ADR, but it&#39;s the effective same slice of the pie. All right, hold that thought. We need to take a short break. But coming up, we&#39;re going to be talking housing stocks again and a runway battle to turn heads as well as [Music] profits. This episode is brought to you by the number 7.5. That is the number of years that realtor.com estimates it&#39;s going to take America to build enough homes to fix the housing shortage. So, it&#39;s a big gap, Tom. And you say it&#39;s a big opportunity and I&#39;m wondering how you&#39;re screening for opportunities here. We already talked about Stanley and the mode and all that. What else you got? Well, look, when you have the gold rush, who made the most money? Was it the people looking at pigs and shovels, right? Uh in war, you don&#39;t want to be betting on the the waring factions. You want to be betting on the arms dealers. So, that&#39;s what we&#39;re going to be doing with the housing sector. So the DH uh the the Hortons, the uh the pties, the KB homes, all the home builders, it&#39;s going to be a race to the bottom because what&#39;s going to take place uh is a couple of things. One, number one, we&#39;re opening up federal land. Okay, we&#39;ve got hundreds of millions of acres if we open up uh like 1% of it will have enough land, it&#39;s like a half a million uh acres will be enough to enough land to bridge the deficit. 1% of the federal federally owned lands, which is a huge swath. Which is a huge swath. Okay. Uh so we&#39;re short four to 7 million houses. Like you said, it&#39;s going to take 7.5 years to do that. Um and effectively what you&#39;re going to see is a race, a race by the home builders. I don&#39;t want to be in that race because once that happens, once supply picks up, it&#39;s a pricing compression. But if you&#39;re doing the builders, the tools for the builders, the Stanley Black &amp; Deck or the construction, the part suppliers like QXO, I think we&#39;re going to talk about or what goes outside now that you got the electrical grid down every single uh month or so in some of the hurricane ridden states. Uh and the demand on the power grid, which is an aging power grid, you need a generator. And if you need a generator, the Kleenex of generators is called Generex. 75% of the market, the game is just getting started there. So, those are our three arms dealers for home building. That&#39;s to to come in a massive scale in the next 3 to 5 years. Oh, and by the way, you got 72 million millennials, 45 million people between age 30 and 40 who need homes. Sydney knows she&#39;s nodding in her head. Listen, it&#39;s like there it&#39;s like it feels like the American dream is slowly slipping away in that sense. I I have a question though. Do you recommend in terms of these kind of tool companies that you go straight for these single stock names or you go to like an ETF so you&#39;re just covering all your bases? Uh my clients pay me to outperform so I don&#39;t go to you&#39;re not going to an ETF. I mean you could you could buy XHP and participate uh uh in a beta sense but if you want an alpha sense you got to do some work and say where am I going to get the most return for the same amount of money. And that&#39;s what we try to do every single day when we get to work. And I love it. It&#39;s like a treasure hunt every single day. Said Warren Buffett. You mentioned a couple names. What&#39;s your favorite story of all the names that you&#39;ve ticked through so far? Uh my favorite jockey. I like to bet on jockeyies because I&#39;m turnaround Tom. Uh is uh Brad Jacobs. Okay. If you got QXO Brad Jacobs wrote a book called How to Make a Few Billion. It was a useful book because he actually made a few billion dollars. Um, if you got involved with him in 1997 when he invested in United Rentals, you made 79 times your money. So 1 million became 79. If you got involved when he put 150 million in XPO Logistics in 2009, uh, you made like 160 times your money. 1 million became 160 million. So now he&#39;s going to do the home building supply sector. He started with Beacon Roofing. Uh, this is a non-discretionary expense. Sydney, you&#39;ll figure this out when you get your starter home on federal land with an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge. That when your roof leaks, you don&#39;t think about should I buy it like you think about should I buy a pink iPhone or a white iPhone. You just call the person and you say fix it. I don&#39;t like water in my living room. So Beacon roofing is his first one. He paid 10 times IBIDA, a little bit rich, but he&#39;s going to double Ibida. Why? Because that&#39;s what Brad Jacobs does. He brings in technology. He creates efficiencies. He doubles IBIDA. That&#39;s his platform company. Then he&#39;s going to roll up 10% of the industry. It&#39;s an 800 billion dollar industry. He&#39;s going to get 50 to$80 billion. How much is he now? Uh he&#39;s got 10 billion with Beacon. Okay. And this was just announced. So he&#39;s going to do another 78x. The stock is probably going to do another 10x the way because it doesn&#39;t account for the technology and the the special magic that Brad Jacobs makes. He&#39;s a money maker. This guy earns for his shareholders. And here&#39;s the beauty. He put 150 million in QXO. He just put a billion dollars of his own money in QXO. So in in XPO he put put 150. In this one he put a billion. Uh we think you know this is one you tuck away for 5 to seven years you probably wind up with a 678 bagger from these levels. Kind of reminds me of Wayne Heisinga. Yeah. Yeah. Three companies in the Fortune 500 over his lifetime which is substantial. Well and they were rollups by the way. And by the way wouldn&#39;t be surprised me. I&#39;m I&#39;m trying to get Brad on my podcast. uh if uh if that was a model name by the way. Uh it&#39;s called Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. It&#39;s number one in the hedge fund category which is the narrow niche, but we&#39;ve been doing it for 5 years and people seem to like it. Tom, I need a I need an invitation over here. Oh, you can come on anytime you want. Yeah, come on. Hedge funds. I have I have a different question for you. Are you invested in REITs? And I&#39;m going to define that for anyone who doesn&#39;t know. REITs are real estate investment trusts companies that own, operate, or finance income producing real estate. Yes, we own one REIT. It&#39;s called Crown Castle. They&#39;re one of the biggest uh owners of cell phone towers. They just sold off their fiber business. They got uh billions of dollars for that. They use that to pay down debt. They have the legacy 40,000 towers that are just cash machines. Basically require no uh maintenance. It&#39;s like an owning an ATM. Every time someone use it, you make a fee. It&#39;s the exact same thing with these towers. So now it&#39;s just going to be a cash machine. They&#39;ll buy back shares. They&#39;ll buy more legacy type towers and uh and these tend to be interest rate sensitive. So when rates come down, as we said, Besson&#39;s going to work his magic the second half. REITs will go up. Crown Castle will be a beneficiary. As far as real estate rates, uh there are none at attractive enough levels at this juncture. We we were big buyers of Vornnado in the hole if you remember during that big uh mini banking crisis. We thought it would take three years to double. Uh it took six months to double and we got out. So uh that one sometimes they take longer than expected like Alibaba. Sometimes they happen faster than expected like Vornnado. But uh the key is the framework is sound. Does the business have a moat? And are we buying it with a large enough margin to safety? All right. We&#39;re going to stick with the entrepreneurial vibe here because today&#39;s runway showdown is all about valuedriven CEOs. Two chiefs struting the catwalk with distinct approaches to turning opportunity into profit. First down the runway is the serial entrepreneur dressed in relaxed business casual, confidently investing in under the radar cash flowing small businesses like storage units and car washes. Quiet, consistent, and profitable. Close behind though is the turnaround specialist, sleeves rolled up, toolkit ready, eager to repair and revive neglected industrials, retailers, and manufacturers. Tom, which value pays off more reliably, the steady entrepreneur building a portfolio from the ground up or the specialist who sees gold where others only see rust? Well, I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s a question of scale, right? You can make a tremendous amount of money buying uh small um businesses that are kind of defra fragmented businesses. Roll them up, get synergies. Uh whether you do it with car washes, whether you do it with laundromats, etc. Uh people do that. But if you want scale and you want control of capital, you need to be in bigger businesses. And that&#39;s what we try to do in the public markets. Uh the beauty, you know, I get approached with private deals all the time. And there are plenty of private deals. Most of them are betting on the future. You know, we&#39;re guessing who&#39;s going to cure cancer, who&#39;s going to be the AI leader. I don&#39;t like to guess on the future. I like to bet on sure things, okay? And I want a business that&#39;s I&#39;m like Gordon Gecko. I want to bet on businesses that have operated through many cycles, many downturns, and operated through and have a big enough moat, a strong enough balance sheet that I know they&#39;re going to recover just back to the mean. They don&#39;t need to be a home run. Doubles or triples over two to three years. and you compound that with large amounts of capital, it beats, you know, grinding and and and uh getting synergies from a handful of laundromats or orever as an entrepreneur. Um, but I will say Brad Jacobs does a combination of that. So, he has his platform company. He gets the public market multiple. you get a higher multiple in the public markets and then he uses that currency and his ability to raise capital in in public markets to buy defragmented businesses, smaller scale businesses and tuck them into his platform company and that&#39;s how he&#39;s created so much wealth for so many people over the years. That&#39;s great. Tom, I want to switch gears here a little more personal and advice driven. Okay, so you study the markets kind of day in and day out. I want you to share with me with us. Yeah. Like what&#39;s the one thing that you think that everyone needs to know about the market that either they&#39;re misunderstanding or is sometimes misrepresented? I think the number one thing like anything in life is to be consistent. So if you&#39;re just buying the overall indices like a VTI, Vanguard total market uh or an S&amp;P 500, buy it every single month a fixed amount. Okay? And the months that you really don&#39;t want to buy it, where your stomach is turnurning, you&#39;re afraid you&#39;re going to lose your job, whatever it happens to be, those are the months you should buy double because uh when you buy down, you get more shares and over time that compounds materially. So dollar cost averaging, that&#39;s kind of your base. You know, put the majority of your money to compound that way. And then when you have excess wealth, you start to take some of that and you want it to be a little bit more aggressive and you put it in different buckets and you hire different managers like Tom Hayes, you hire uh uh you know maybe a private equity manager, maybe maybe a venture capital fund, etc. Uh and you diversify with that excess. But start with the basics. Get the compounding machine going because it&#39;s the eighth wonder of the world. Uh and um it&#39;s it&#39;s created more wealth. This beautiful amazing the ninth wonder right here behind us. Exactly. Guess what? That is all the time we have. Really appreciate you stopping by. And this will do it for this latest episode of Stocks in Translation. And we&#39;re back. And then I had the pleasure to I don&#39;t know how they got my number. Uh it uh Bloomberg Dubai reached out to me on LinkedIn literally a day or two after I landed and asked me to go on Bloomberg Dubai. And I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, I was just in your city. I would have been happy to do it in person. So, I did did the remote interview. Unfortunately, we&#39;re not going to play it because little did I know the interview was in Arabic. Uh, so I&#39;m joking with all my friends and saying, you know, one week in Dubai and I already speak Arabic. So, they gave me the questions in English and apparently as I was talking, they talk over you in Arabic for the local audience. And um, and that was that. But that was a fun experience. Then I want to thank Chabuk Ou for having me in his Reuters article this week and the quotes of the week. Know what you own and know why you own it. Peter Lynn and this was a great example we have seen. It&#39;s so interesting. So many people I think got shaken out that maybe bought Boeing at 150 and got shaken out last month when it went to 129 and we were on Varnney saying bye bye bye like crazy and loading the boat with options and spreads and all the different things. Well the stock has moved now almost you know it&#39;s moved 80 points 80 plus points got up to like 85 points in a matter of four weeks. Many of those options were up many multiples uh serious amounts of money in short period of time. Uh we actually harvested millions upon millions of dollars of options in uh Boeing today, this morning into strength. We sell into strength. We buy into weakness. Uh however, we have not sold one single share of Boeing. Okay, that is a long-term holding for us. We do think it&#39;s moved very far very very quickly and we wanted to lock in some of those profits. Um uh you can joke in coming weeks when it keeps going higher and say Tom got it wrong. But uh the clients who saw the amount of multiples on those options will say I&#39;m so glad he took profits. So uh there we go. But we we no change in view. It&#39;s just at some point you got to ring the register. And uh that was just a lot of money money in a very very short period of time. So uh Charlie Mer, it&#39;s remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid instead of trying to be very intelligent. And you know, I look at some of the questions that come in and we&#39;ve got a lot of great AMAs this week. Um and uh this is a mug from my friends. Thank you very much. Love this. my favorite color, by the way, other than of course hedge fund tips black. But um you know it&#39;s it&#39;s I think you know it goes back to Buffett saying about how sometimes the 130 IQ crushes the 160 because the 160 focused on so many unimportant factors and all these different variations and secondguing and if you get to you know kind of first principles what are the two or three things that may make 80% of the difference with any investment opportunity and any particular theme that you&#39;re in and you stick to it and you know what you own. It&#39;s really just avoiding the stupid things, chasing the shiny objects where you&#39;re going to get that outperformance over uh a reasonable amount of time. And um and that&#39;s what this is all about is is trying to uh avoid stupid things and and uh basic things, things that you can understand that have durable modes that you can buy them when they&#39;re down. And this is uh speaking segue right into Benjamin Graham. great company is not a great investment if you take pay too much for the stock. Okay? Uh you know buying Boeing at 211 still a great investment a lot different than buying it at 150 or 160 uh but it still has a lot of upside in it. So it&#39;s um you know it it&#39;s just getting great businesses when people are panicking. You know, it&#39;s it, you know, right now what&#39;s super exciting, I keep getting all these texts from literally people I golf with like, what about SMR and all this stuff because Nuclear was in the news this week and look, we played we had a derivative play and a multibagger in Rolls-Royce Holdings. They had SMRs. We were playing the engine servicing uh hours and got a multibagger in that quicker than we thought. Sold a little early, but you know, we&#39;re not complaining. Uh, that one was a good one and a quick one. Um, but that&#39;s, you know, that&#39;s 10 years off. So, the simple answer to everyone getting all hyped up about nuclear because why it was in the headlines this week, uh, is when everyone stops talking about nuclear again in three or four months, uh, you look amongst the rubble and you see what makes sense for the next five years. And, and that&#39;s really the way that you you want to look think about these things. Here&#39;s some sloomer notes. Um, okay. Here&#39;s the S&amp;P 500. You know, it&#39;s it could be up against resistance here. But on the flip side, you look at some of this and this this has upside and it&#39;s hard to say that uh when you look at the fundamentals, it&#39;s trading at 21 times, 12 month, 19 times forward, but I think that guidance is a little light because of the tariff uncertainty and we&#39;re going to get some real resolution in four weeks or less. Number one, you had the vote yesterday or the the the courts rule it illegal. um that will be overturned. I I think what people underestimate is, you know, most people spend their life trying to avoid winding up in a courtroom. Donald Trump uh uh has basically uh built a career out of winning in courtrooms. I mean, for the most part, he embraces going to court and uh loves to slug it out and loves long-term uncertainty, the exact opposite of most of mo any uh rational counterparty. So, I I wouldn&#39;t bet against him on this getting it overturned, but there&#39;s something here from a technical perspective, and I don&#39;t want to put a lot of weight on that. That just looks like this thing wants to push higher, even if in the short term we got to consolidate in this range uh for a little bit and maybe maybe check back. But, uh I think I think as we get resolution, estimates are going to start going up and and people are going to be surprised. And then you got all these poor bastards that were shorting down here and sold in the whole record for hedge funds and CTAs. It&#39;s it&#39;s uh you know and and we we did just get this kind of like pullback uh on the daily here. On the weekly, it looks like we could have some more upside. So yes, things that have gone and made us an enormous amount of money in a short period of time like those options uh for for for one. We did harvest some profits. Now we&#39;re sitting on some cash because they made so many multiples. Uh but we&#39;ll find things to do right now. I mean there there I I don&#39;t think we going to have to wait a lot. You know, you look at small caps, there&#39;s a ton to do there. Uh you look at sentiment is not fully stretched. I I do think we push higher and I do think we&#39;re going to get that money to work uh very very quickly. It&#39;s there&#39;s no problem putting new money to work uh in in some of these pockets that we love that uh are just now starting to take off. Uh MCI Europe, UK, I mean Tokyo&#39;s kind of been sideways for a year and a half now. Hang Sang is recovering here. A little bit of chop the last few days or so, but the direction is up. We&#39;re going to share a chart in our uh pod charts this week that&#39;s going to blow your mind in terms of multiples, in terms of growth estimates, etc. 30-year yield went back to the top of the range. We&#39;re not worried about that. We discussed the SLR with the Yahoo segment. 10-year yield, middle of the range. This is going down this summer with the SLR. probably back to the bottom end of the range if not break through but definitely I think we could see 375 360 which means 5.9% mortgage which means off to the races on the housing theme uh next year. So here we&#39;re up to this resistance level on the 10-year yield. Maybe it goes to the top again. I doubt it. Uh I think we&#39;re I think we&#39;re a little overbought there on yields. Dollar index well down to the bottom of the range. Do we break down to 95 or do we have a counter trend bounce up here? I don&#39;t know. But we did get that minor counter trend that we were looking at and started to roll back over. Maybe we finally break through. That&#39;s going to help earnings in the second half. Going to help international uh going to help China, etc. Euro, look at this. This was on no one&#39;s bingo card except for the loyal, incredible, amazing listeners and clients uh of the podcast. Very excited for you. Uh euros is moving, man. Uh, Canadian dollar, how you doing, Looney? Uh, may maybe we&#39;re going to be your uh uh Trump keeps saying uh Canada, our 51st state. Maybe we&#39;ll be uh Canada&#39;s uh um second through 51st uh um province. Who knows? Uh it&#39;s not the right way to say it, but you get the point. I&#39;m joking. Uh okay. Then we got uh the commodity index kind of flatlining there. This is it&#39;s good to go through some gold. It looks like it&#39;s topped in the short term. It&#39;s good to go through these. Dr. Copper kind of gives us an indication of China starting to recover here. Copper has a PhD in economics as it relates to the economy. It&#39;s going up. The economy is recovering. That&#39;s largely driven by China. A lot of voices saying crude going excuse me below 50. Um, we&#39;ll look at some of this. I again, I think there&#39;s stuff to do in the energy space. I mean, comtock keeps going up. That&#39;s our exposure. Uh, that&#39;s been a now 300%. Let&#39;s see. Nine. So, between 8 and 9 and it&#39;s at 25 now. So, three plus bagger in a short period of time. That&#39;ll probably check back a little bit, but it&#39;s going higher. So, we love our multiaggers, whether they&#39;re options or stocks, and we like them better in stocks because then the options are multi multis. Uh crude, it looks like it&#39;s trying to put in a bottom here. I&#39;m happy with just having com, but uh we&#39;ve got some AMA questions about servicesers that I like. We haven&#39;t pulled the trigger on any of them. Um, see any of these other names. Nvidia will be be back up to the top of the range there. I think they&#39;re going to be rangebound for a little while because with, you know, the the key thing with Nvidia is not a demand problem. It&#39;s a supply problem. And I I went into a lot of detail on it on the Arabic call. So, if you speak Arabic, uh, check that out. But the excess supply capacity from TSMC and possibly Intel uh I I would say probably, but let&#39;s just say possibly uh won&#39;t be online until mid of 2026. So, they&#39;re going to be stuck at plus 4 billion revenues a quarter, which is going to bring their revenue growth rate down from a peak of 400% down to below 50%. the multiple will probably get down to the low 20s before mid next year uh which might actually be a time to buy it uh before that excess supply comes on and they can really juice the earnings. Uh looks like some of these semiconductors are wanting to bottom. The Mag 7 has kind of been stuck here. Apple stuck in the range. Google and we we&#39;ve said that you know the earnings growth has decelerated in those. I think they probably trade back to the top of the range into midsummer and then uh and then we&#39;ll have some profit taking. Uh what else do we like here? Consumer discretionary is a spot to start to look. Consumer confidence has come back. We saw the numbers last week. Couple staples. Colgate might be worth taking a quick look at. Lot of lot of amazing things still to do. I got to take a look at Amgen. What else we got? Uh these are Canadian banks. I just don&#39;t feel like a lot of these EMP companies. If you look at Suncor, they just haven&#39;t come down relative to the price of the commodity. So, I don&#39;t get the leverage on the ups if the price goes back up. That&#39;s why I loved Comtock so much. Uh let&#39;s take a look at 30-year yield and 10-year. We talked about that weekly chart. Dollar looks like it&#39;s breaking down. There was the counter trend rally we were telling you is going to happen. It happened. Now it looks like it&#39;s breaking down. That will be good for earnings the second half. Let&#39;s see. Albamaro. This is from Morning Star put this out a couple days ago uh with a fair value estimate of $200. If you sleep on Albamaro, I really feel sorry for you. I think this is going to be a big name. We&#39;ve talked about it. It&#39;s a dividend aristocrat. It&#39;s raised the dividend every year for the last 30 years throughout all the normal cyclical peaks and troughs of the lithium price cycle. Supply demand is expected to we had thought mid 2026. I think this note is calling for it to even happen sooner. uh you know this is like if if everything goes wrong in our view again all this is opinion not advice do your own research consult your advisor click on terms on hedge funips.com um but um you know I if we&#39;re wrong about this we think it&#39;s a double if we&#39;re right this could be uh you know 34 bagger from here with you know options doing 5x plus and all kinds of good stuff so um so that&#39;s that. Let&#39;s get down to our data of the week. I was talking to some friends and um I just said don&#39;t count Lip Bhan out. This is not a guy you want to bet against. You know, if we&#39;re wrong on the fab business and he totally screws it up, we&#39;ll still get a double on the legacy business. And if we&#39;re right, I mean, this guy got in uh Cadence Designs. Look at Cadence. is a really interesting software design uh semiconductor software design software used to design semiconductors and the stock had been basically dead money for 15 years when he got involved except it had fallen 90% right before he got involved. So dead money and a 90% drop. You know, not dissimilar from Intel. Intel has been dead money for 25 years. Okay, it&#39;s the same price it was in 2000. Uh it&#39;s dropped from a recent peak of about 75%. Lip Bhutan&#39;s getting involved. when he did it with Cadence uh the stock was a 100 bagger over the next 24 years I&#39;m sorry over the next 14 years rather from 2009 to 2023 100 baggers so if you put in a million bucks you made 100 million bucks that&#39;s not going to happen in Intel but I do think if we&#39;re if he gets the fabs right and catches a couple lucky breaks which this guy has a tendency to do I do think it could be a four or five bagger and your downside&#39;s largely predicted if they liquidated the whole thing today. Trading at about book. Uh I kind of like it. I love betting on the right jockeyies and we&#39;ll talk a little bit about VFC Corp today. New vehicle sales forecast for April. The headline for this was like, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s going to be terrible.&quot; Look, sequentially they&#39;re expecting it to be down month after a record pull forward from tariffs in March. But that&#39;s not the right way to measure it. The right way to measure it is to look at April 2024 to April 2025. And April 2024 was pretty good and we&#39;re going to be up on April 2024 even after we up 4.6% even after h pulling forward a couple hundred,000 vehicles in March uh to uh you know did 1.58 in March. So you can say, oh, they&#39;re down 12% month- on-month, but they they pulled forward a few hundred grand and they&#39;re still up yearon year. So it shows the underlying strength of demand. This is the multiples. These are uh companies uh friends friends in Dubai sent over uh uh from a Chinese sellside bank all major kind of discretionary companies in China and their PE on forward earnings and you could see here all of these companies Alibaba you know Maitan has a low PE pendu duo but Pendu is a train wreck that was down big this week we had told you for a year that their numbers were either unreliable or unsustainable. That proved to be true this week. Uh but Bob has a nine times 2026 earnings. I mean with with low double digit earnings growth, all the outs that we&#39;ve talked about, this is just unbelievable. Um so cheap market, cheapest in the market with accelerating earnings growth, top a cheapest AI play, most advanced lang large language model, uh leader in cloud, leader in middle class uh recovery and China&#39;s government now was a headwind is now a massive tailwind. and they want to get everyone spending their $20 trillion of savings. And if they all start consuming, uh, Alibaba picks up 40 cents of every dollar spent on e-commerce in China. It is a toll taker. Inbound foreign visitors recovered to 84.5% of the 2019 level last year. uh in China you can see here this is staples are resilient discretionary is still a little bit weak but the government&#39;s working on that real estate trading goods drive growth uh so they&#39;ve had the vouchers etc so you see office appliances cultural and office appliances up first quarter of 2025 over first quarter of 2024 big time. Sports and recreational articles up big 25% telecom equipment up big 26% furniture up 18% appliances and audio video up 19%. So the government stimulus and vouchers are starting to work to spur consumption. It&#39;s early days and uh Alibaba is going to get the bulk of that. S&amp;P 500 debt at record lows. This chart blew my mind. Government debt is at record highs. US debt to GDP uh 120%. S&amp;P net debt to market cap is at 10%. Down from its peak before the great financial crisis at 65%. Look at this ladies and gentlemen. They have so much room to lever up. It&#39;s insane. And when Bessant gives him the green light this summer with the SLR and brings rates down, you are going to see uh huge huge refinancings, borrowings, deals, everything happen all at once. US equities rolling 10-year return now 13% was negative -3% in 2009. So we can stay up at these levels for a pronounced period of time. Uh in this case it was about 20 years once it got up to that level from 46 to looks like about early 60s. Then from 85 through 2003 and then we just got up there in like 200 18. Probably goes for another five, six years. Uh and that&#39;s just the way the cycle goes. Um, you could see here in the total asset class quilt of returns, gold has had two strong years. I wouldn&#39;t count on that recurring. The last two last time you had gold do this well two years in a row was 2010. In 2011, the following year it dropped to the bottom of the quilt. And then the year after that in 2013, it was the worst performer with negative 27%. So, um, uh, everyone&#39;s asking me about gold. It&#39;s the time to be probably taking some profits off the table. XLV, healthc care versus S&amp;P 500 since Trump election. Uh, you can see here, huge draw down in healthcare. I think that&#39;s probably going to be the new area of huge opportunity relative to risk. Uh so we currently have exposure to that through um the biotech basket of biotech with the XBI that will be doing starting to recover massively as it did in uh Trump 1.0 and um a few other Baxter I think some of these medical device are going to finally start to catch a bid after all the smoke clears. Uh here is housing forecasting average annual starts to 1.5 million this decade. So you can see it has been clawing back got hurt a little bit and now is reacelerating. That&#39;s going to help our Stanley Black &amp; Decker Generrack and um QXO themes. QXO is up a lot in a short period of time early basis $13. I think it got up to 17 or 18 already and and the story is just getting started. So that&#39;s moved a lot in a short period of time. Earnings resilience supports V-shaped recovery. You can see estimates holding up. China now more popular worldwide than the US. Net global perception of select countries where negative values dictate negative perceptions and positive percentage indicate positive perceptions. So, it appears since 2023 was a peak. Uh, that&#39;s interesting. I wonder where this table is from. Uh, note to Jeff, make sure you always try to include the source on these. Um, that looks like it&#39;s The Economist, which tends to have a little bit of a bias. Uh, so they&#39;re saying Russia&#39;s improving. All right, we&#39;re going to toss this one out. Next is uh front-loaded tax cuts, backloaded spending cuts, preliminary house reconcil reconciliation package, fiscal effects versus current policy. Um, look, all we want to make sure is that bonus depreciation gets slid back in. Uh, and if that&#39;s the case, that&#39;ll be really, really good for business. One China one-year uh loan prime rate continues to go down. easing continues aggressively. That&#39;s a good thing to see. China business confidence is at a record in May 2025. You can see here growth expectations have now shot through the roof. You haven&#39;t seen these levels in years. Um interest rates coming off of 5,000year lows. Rate cycles last for decades. So, you know, you saw in the 1800s it would go up, spike up, come back down, spike up, come back down. uh everyone&#39;s looking with recency bias after the 30s when it spiked up it just kept going up that doesn&#39;t mean it has to happen and I and I think it probably won&#39;t happen because of the demography in the global world in the in the developed world is more deflationary than inflationary so um I think this would be a range more like the 1800s than a spike like you saw from 30 to uh 1980 but you We&#39;ll we&#39;ll see how it goes. Uh short-term rates are going down. That&#39;s what I can be pretty pretty darn confident about. Housing supply rises to highest level in five years. So, that&#39;s going to start to bring down prices, make things more affordable. Florida being the leading indicator, Texas being the leading indicator. People are starting to dump. Uh credit downgrades haven&#39;t had lasting effects on stocks. 12 months later, uh, they&#39;re up in 20% on the 2023 downgrade and 18% in the 2011 downgrade. I mean, it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of comical that these agencies are still in business after what they did during the housing crisis, uh, giving AAA ratings to the mortgage back securities, but, uh, you know, they&#39;re still around and up to the same old shenanigans. I understand the risks have have increased and it&#39;s a good way to put the uh government officials on alert. So hopefully they&#39;ll take the proper action in coming months uh and and we&#39;ll see how that goes. But I I I think the name of the game is going to be uh that no one&#39;s pricing in is growing our way out of this problem. And I think with the deregulation and uh a lot of the policies that are coming into play uh and housing tends to lead the economy. So, if they do get the rates down and they do get the lands open and you do see a tremendous amount of building and production, um that&#39;s going to be enormous for the economy, enormous for growth. Uh and then you get people moving into houses that they own versus they rent. Then they start fixing things, they start buying furniture, they start buying appliances, and and it&#39;s game on. So, I I&#39;m very bullish about growing our way out of it versus cutting our way out of it, but um we&#39;ll see how it plays out. Putting US credit downgrades in context, uh you can kind of see it visually on that chart. Inventory frontloading delays, tariff induced price pressures, difference between April wholesale inventory growth and 12-month average. So you can see some durable goods, home furnishings, chemicals got pushed forward. Autos got a little bit pushed forward. Durables long-term dollar sentiment sour to worst on record. That&#39;s kind of why we were calling for that counter trend bounce. We&#39;ll see if we get any more in the counter trend, but it looks like it wants to break lower. So uh so that&#39;ll be good for a lot of our thesis that we came into the year with when everyone was convinced the dollar was going higher, not lower. Toyota revs up sales of RAV 4 hybrids in the US. That&#39;s good for Cooper. Uh they make a lot more per vehicle on the hybrids than on the ICE and even more on the hybrids than the EVs, which EVs they make more than the ICEs as well. Year-to- date repurchase authorizations have now spiked from 665 billion to 711 billion, record all-time high. The relentless bid in the market continues. quarterly buyback executions. Uh again, announcements have exceeded executions, but executions are up there. Truck tonnage index versus S&amp;P 500. So, the S&amp;P 500 has gone up materially. Truck tonnage has kind of been flat, so we do want to keep an eye on that. Firsttime home buyers, share of home purchases, uh well below the 20-year average of 35%. It&#39;s less than 20. It&#39;s about 24% need rates to come down. Share of home built homes built under 1500 square f foot. We&#39;ve been talking about this would be the case since 2023. Look what&#39;s happened since. It&#39;s gone from 17% to 22%. This is going to be the whole game moving forward is smaller size, massive numbers, huge volumes. Helps the arms dealers, not the waring faction. armed dealers, meaning Building Supply, the Stanley&#39;s, the uh Generracks, the QXO&#39;s, the LVM, the LVMH, the uh KB Homes, the Pies. They&#39;re going to be a race to the bottom. They&#39;re they&#39;re going to be putting on massive supply on the market at lower and lower margins after they&#39;re going to have to offer incentives. Same thing&#39;s going to happen with the car dealers. That&#39;s why you want to be in the arms dealing business versus the waring factions. AI capex growth is continuing to run at a very strong rate. um co disruption. Yeah. So you can see here uh this is China policy and you can see the easing policy stance has has started to be the most aggressive uh since the 2016 to 2018 period when the Chinese stock or hang and China tech went parabolic. from 2016 to 2018. Uh this is the most easing policy you&#39;ve seen in China since that period. So I do think we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to continue to see follow through in China techn equities and most importantly Alibaba. Also uh exhibit 20 from Goldman Sachs ETF flow tracker suggest the national team has been buying to support the market in China. cumulative flows to top five NT holding China A shares. You can see that in R&amp;B uh as the market recovers, they&#39;ve been massive buyers and that&#39;s going to continue as well just like the Japanese did. Median S&amp;P 500 short interest as a percentage of market cap. So short interest is pretty elevated here. It&#39;s record short interest in small caps. Those are going to be the next rip your face off rally. If you missed the general market uh rip your face off rally, that&#39;s where it&#39;s coming next. Dollar can fall again showing the overvalue of the dollar. Equity put call ratio gets down to these levels from elevated levels. You see continued good things in the equity markets. Tariffs may not hit every stock equally. Um we don&#39;t even know if tariffs are going to be a thing. I mean, I I would bet they are. I think it&#39;s going to be the 10% across the board. But an interesting court decision for sure. Whether he can just declare a random emergency and uh tariff anyone he wants in the name of whatever he wants is now in question. It will be fought. I would say more than a coin flip he wins. But at least it&#39;s now in question which is kind of interesting because so many of the companies have adjusted to the prospected of of tariffs. We heard VF Corp and they&#39;re like, &quot;We&#39;ll just come out stronger and here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to do it.&quot; And so imagine if there wind up being no tariffs and they take all the actions to absorb the extra hundred million, $150 million of costs and then that just goes straight to the bottom line. That, you know, that&#39;s that&#39;s a rosy scenario that&#39;s not in any models right now, but like if that happened, talk about growth exceeding expectations. Um 60-day loan delinquency rate. So this is a bare uh wet dream chart. It&#39;s showing prime auto loans are uh moving up to 2019 levels and subprime auto loans are accelerating in a big way. Um you know it is what it is. I mean it&#39;s question is it&#39;s the percent of outstanding. question is what percent is outstanding relative to past periods when rates were zero now the rates are so high what is the magnitude of the total portfolio and the answer is probably smaller but um have to get some data to burden ourselves with the facts on that one relative valuations are depressed across key sectors says UK 12 month forward PE ratio in consumer staples UK that&#39;s interesting thing, energy materials, of course, dry powder buying the dip, weekly change in money market funds versus the S&amp;P 500. So, you see the last time you saw this dip was April 2024. You had a continued rally for the all the way through mid July. I think that&#39;s probably the base case. I think we do probably persist higher in for the next month and a half, two or so, two months before we get a little bit of rest bit in the fall. Um TSA pass through numbers good, which is kind of interesting because uh most of the airline stocks have been left for dead. There might be some things to do there. How higher rates could impact stocks? Different equity investment scenarios on the 10-year yield. Minimal impact where we are. Uh if you get higher issue for rate sensitives and low quality. Okay, that&#39;s interesting. Uh what is this city? What is this? Economic surprise index turning positive. Japanese yield sore. We&#39;ve told you this is this is continued pressure on MAG 7. The carry trade unwind will persist as inflation ticks up in Japan. they continue to tighten. As they continue to tighten, the the yen gets stronger relative to the dollar. Uh uh the carry trade is no longer costfree capital and most of that hot money was in the most crowded trade, which was the MAG 7, which is why I don&#39;t think you can expect a lot more after it trades after that basket trades to the top end of the range. And I think you can expect a ton from the other 493 where there&#39;s opportunities where they were hit by tariffs, fear of the worst, and wind up with something less. And uh and that&#39;s where you get the divergence between expectations and reality. And you get the forced just as you got the forced structural selling, you get the forced structural buying as we&#39;ve we&#39;ve gotten a taste of in the last six weeks. Bloomberg dollar gauge hit 16-month low. I mean, unbelievable. Everyone was like, you&#39;re totally wrong on the dollar. And boom, completely rolled over. We remember all the charts we went over after the election goes up, Trump 1.0, 0 and then it rolls over after the inauguration. That&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened. Uh one month S&amp;P return versus change in the 10-year yields, rates rising, rates falling, zcore, okay, delinquency rate, credit card loans, and all commercial banks. So, you know, you look at credit card loans, I mean, it&#39;s below average. So, you look at those subprime auto loans. So yeah, we saw that a little bit last year in Dollar General and Dollar Tree and the lowest of the low end, but in aggregate delinquencies are below average. So, you know, they peaked a little bit and now they&#39;ve come back in. Seven US companies make up more than the next big five countries in the MSCI all world country index combined. The problem is is they no longer make up that much more of the earnings. And that&#39;s the divergence. And that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing a constant um leakage and a and a and persistent, you know, historically there had been a persistent bid. Now there&#39;s a persistent dribble uh away from those and I think that that continues even if they make it back to the top of the range. 90% of companies in the MCI outperformed MAG 7 over the past three months. This is what we&#39;ve been calling for and that&#39;s what&#39;s taking place. market share of the 10 largest S&amp;P 500 stocks uh at different peaks 38% versus 19%. What&#39;s valuable is when they actually measure it against percentage of the S&amp;P earnings and it&#39;s no longer uh they no longer command that waiting of earnings relative to weight and that&#39;s why the divergence has created a weight and that&#39;s why they&#39;ve dramatically underperformed this year. Consensus change in forward 12-month earnings per share. China Tech 100 ex consensus uh forward earnings per share has gone parabolic over the last three months up and US tech has gone down. Okay, look at the change in earnings expectations for China tech versus US tech. US tech going down, China going up. um number of S&amp;P 500 companies issuing uh annual guidance. So you can see here everyone says they all pulled guidance. It&#39;s not the case. They pulled guidance during COVID. They did not pull guidance uh anywhere near that much in the last with the tariff uncertainty. China by far has the largest share of the global e-commerce market in terms of percent. They have 55% share of global online retail sales last year. US had 20% and who has the largest share of China e-commerce is Alibaba with 40%. Not to have a piece of that I think is uh is going to prove to I think not owning Alibaba in the next 24 months is probably going to have bigger career risk for most managers than owning too much mag 7 which has gotten shellacked. Um so let&#39;s see how that plays out. Buy the dip is back. Average S&amp;P 500 return in session following a down day. uh look at the US Treasury yield curve. Oh, this is interesting. Uh this is from Cali Cox over at Rit Holtz. Historically, odds of gains increase with holding period. So, if you hold stocks for a day, your average your odds of being up or 51%. If you hold them for three months, your odds are 66%. If you hold them for 10 years, your odds are 93%. If you own stocks for 20 years, your odds are 100%. Uh, US first home buyers are now older than ever. So, uh, repeat buyers average age 61, first-time home buyers average age 38. That is really high, which tells us we&#39;ve got a lot of pent-up demand ahead of us. uh houses will get smaller, prices will go down, supply will go up, rates will come down, all the so the way to play it is play the derivative. Don&#39;t play the primary. And uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been talking about for many months now. For foreigners, US dollar weakness compounds the pain of US equities falling. So all those folks crowded into MAG 7 that got smashed, they also got smashed because while their equities fell 25%, they were all crowded into mag 7, the currency fell another 10% on top of it. So they they&#39;ve just been smoked. Um emerging market relative earnings are historically depressed. 12 month forward earnings relative to the US, more upside potential, limited downside risk. We haven&#39;t seen this since when? Early 2000s, which we&#39;ve talked about forever. Same thing with trailing EPS to world GDP. Again, levels we saw in the early 2000s, which led to the biggest rally in the shortest amount of time in international value versus grow international value versus growth, small versus large, etc. Mag 7 free cash flow growth X Nvidia yearon year is now 111%. uh you haven&#39;t seen this type of negative free cash flows since or falling free cash flow since 2021 and 2022 which is why I don&#39;t think that basket&#39;s getting much higher than the top of the range and the other 493 are going to pick up some slack. Healthcare market cap is a percentage of S&amp;P 500. This reminds me an awful lot of when energy fell from 9% of the S&amp;P 500 down to 3% in 2020 when we were buying Exxon Mobile handover fist at $33 when oil went negative in 2020. Now it&#39;s healthc care hasn&#39;t been this low as a percentage since 2001 and since 2011. We got to we got to figure out I mean we&#39;ve got good healthc care exposure but we got to find some more opportunity because those type of divergences are generational opportunities. Uh Goldman Sachs social media economic sentiment index relative to University of Michigan consumer sentiments. We did see the CB consumer confidence actually catch up this week. So that&#39;s a little sale. UK retail sales X auto starting to pick up. That&#39;s good to see. In chi, gxo has a huge exposure to uh UK retail or UK business. In China today, it makes sense to borrow to buy back shares. China 10-year government bond yield minus MCI China index dividend yield. This is the same situation that caused the Japanese government to be buying massive amounts of equities uh which caused the Japanese stock market to recover a few years back. And now the same situation is set up in China. Um, very very interesting. Again, going back to that 2016 situation where 2016 to 2018 you had a straight up parabolic rally just like 2009 to 2011. You you can just see it over and over. So we we&#39;re set positioned very well there. S&amp;P 500 average realized stock correlation picked up a little bit. US to Europe trade is still alive. US pensions are modeled to sell $19 billion of stock for month and rebalancing. That&#39;s this month. Ranks in the 89th percentile amongst all buy and sell estimates in absolute dollar value going back to 2000. That&#39;s from Seth Golden. Road to reshoring may be bumpier than expected. That&#39;s correct. Natural gas trading above 370 on the July contract. It&#39;s going to be a long hot summer. We agree. Go comps.go. More clues the bulls are in charge. That&#39;s from uh Ryan Dietrich over at Carson. S&amp;P performance after May is up 5% or greater. 12 months out is up on average 19.9. Six months out is up on average 6.4. Bull markets last longer than you think. We&#39;re only 60 months in. Uh 2009 recovery, we saw 131 months. 87 recovery, we saw 148 months. Uh and so on. Investor pessimism tracking identical to prior major recovery rallies. Total equity flows one month. You can see the draw down here is coincident with many troughs and the rallies when it turns green tend to persist for many months. So we&#39;re at the beginning of that. What is the taco trade acronym that stands for Trump always chickens out? I look I think this is a stupid way to phrase it because ultimately you want him acting rationally when the facts are not favorable for forward prospects. And that&#39;s what he&#39;s shown that he&#39;s going to do uh in the face of positions taken that were initial offerings in a negotiating stance that caused excessive volatility. Uh created huge opportunity for us. So we&#39;re grateful. But uh I can understand how people would get upset that sold in the hole and now it&#39;s recovered on them. But um we weren&#39;t we were concerned that it was an extreme position. But as we you know I I continue to go back to that special call I did for clients when we went through company by company. I said look now&#39;s the if you&#39;re if you&#39;re putting more money in now&#39;s the time. This is like man-made. Started with a tweet could end with a tweet. Look at the cash flows. Look at the earnings. Look at the revenues. Let&#39;s rock and roll. We can buy them on sale. And so many of you came in and uh and did that. And there&#39;s still a great enough pocket of stocks to still do that now that um it&#39;s pretty exciting. Anyway, JP Morgan sees record outperformance by European stocks again on no one&#39;s bingo card. Those of you who are listeners uh in the fourth quarter took advantage of all this stuff beating up renewables starting to perform. That&#39;s interesting. Healthcare healthc care price to book at one times versus 1.7 times historical average. that&#39;s consistent with the waiting being so low. So, we got to start to dig into healthcare a little bit more. Uh price to operating cash flow at one times versus 1.5 times historical average. Uh forward PE at8 times versus 1.1 times historical average. Yeah, healthcare. Similar story with energy price to book at the low end of the range. Price to operating cash flow low end of the range towards the minimum. I mean this is Yeah. Yeah. Energy and health care. We probably need a little more. We might be okay on on on healthcare, but yeah, we got to keep digging. Rolling four-week average trends by client type. Hedge funds still underweight, still forced buyers. I wanted to go through. My goodness, we&#39;re going we got so much stuff to cover here. Um I guess we&#39;ll just do this one. We were going to go through the whole commodities basket. Maybe we&#39;ll do that next week if we have more time. Um you can just see commercials is a smart money when they&#39;re getting long. They&#39;re they&#39;re the longest that they&#39;ve been since 2018. You&#39;ve been putting in this long base. I think bonds are going to get bid bigly this summer and uh part of it will be the SLR. Um you know you saw continuing claims today maybe the Fed will do a cut or so. You couple that too. Uh again the positioning is such hedge funds are short in the whole this is always a formula for massive rip your face off rallies. So yields are going down. It&#39;s consistent with the housing theme. It&#39;s consistent with everything we&#39;ve talked about international versus US dollar weaker etc. Goldman Sachs expects stronger yuan to boost Chinese stocks. We agree. We&#39;ve just we&#39;ve been saying that for over a year. Ali and it&#39;s happened. Alibaba&#39;s new instant commerce portal m passes 40 million daily orders. Uh by the way, you didn&#39;t even know you own that. The amount of stuff that we own as owners of Alibaba, which aren&#39;t credited in the stock yet, is just mindboggling. I&#39;ve never seen anything like it in my whole career. Al Alibaba chairman Joe Sai says company on good path after years of setbacks. Uh Goldman Sachs edge head funds cut magnificent 7 bought China stocks. China&#39;s policy rebalancing toward consumption. Kin Kiu Jin says Intel CEO Lip Bhutan has a long track record in the chip industry. Now he needs a big customer. He will get that big customer. Not because he&#39;s necessarily the best. I&#39;m not saying Intel is going to be better than Taiwan Semiconductor. because he&#39;s going to be in a duopoly and there&#39;s only two games in town and they&#39;re going to they&#39;re going to prop up uh you know like we they&#39;re going to prop up Intel like we can at Bernie and make a bunch of chips. They will be the king of the inferior chips but the amount of demand is so unlimited that the crumbs are going to be enormous and based on where it&#39;s priced those crumbs are going to have a monstrous effect and operating leverage straight to the bottom line and into the price of the stock. Toyota goes all hybrid with its bestselling US vehicle. Toyota sales hit second monthly high on US tariff rush. Honda CEO is all about hybrids now that EV adoption is pushed back five to six years. Lilo and or Lilo and Stitch Mission Impossible Fuel Memorial Day record. Lilo and Stitch is Disney. Bernstein says US Gas Super Cycle is coming. We love it, baby. Comtock and range resources. My goodness, that thing. I&#39;ve had that thing since 2018. It&#39;s unbelievable. Now basis 410 dropped to 160 during COVID and um and it&#39;s getting up there. I think you know 5560 we got to start to take some off on a 410 basis. Uh Boeing stock has been surging. Here&#39;s why it&#39;s become a FOMO play. So sold to you. We we took multibaggers on the options. We kept every single share of stock. We will be riding that higher but I think it&#39;s gone very far very fast in a short period of time and sometimes you just got to book a huge win. Bessant sees easing capital rule on treasuries this summer. How you doing? SLR, we&#39;ve been talking about it. Get ready. New home sales unexpectedly surge despite high mortgage rate as builders lower prices again. Waring fashions versus arm dealers. Play the arms dealers, not the waring factions. A building boom on federal land. It just might work. Everyone wants more housing. The government needs to make sure it gets built and the government will. Emerging markets, this government will emerging markets said to see the next bull run as the sell the US narrative gains ground. Um I think everyone has this view that it&#39;s either or like if you think international stocks are going to outperform then you think US stocks are going to do bad or US has lost its way. No, US has just pulled forward a ton of gains. They now needs to consolidate. Uh international and emerging markets have been left for dead. Now they have to catch up. I mean it&#39;s not it&#39;s not complicated. You don&#39;t have to make it ideological. Just deal unbiased with the facts. Where is the opportunity? Do you you know does it mean you like one form of government over another? No. Look, well, clearly I like capitalism over communism all day long, but the prices have gotten so cheap in China that you look, don&#39;t have exposure to it. It&#39;s okay. We&#39;ll we&#39;ll be fine. Don&#39;t have exposure to energy in 2020 when managers were getting fired if they owned an oil stock at the lows and then two years later they were buying it at the highs because they also had career risk. I mean it just the market in the short term is a voting machine based on emotion. In the long term it is a weighing machine based on fundamentals. Leave all the ideology, leave all the emotions, leave all the on the sideline and focus on the numbers. You know the only reason you put a dollar into an investment is because you expect to get multiple dollars at some point in the future. So you have to be careful. What are you paying for today&#39;s dollars and what are you paying for the future dollars? You know, so many people bring me great companies that are going to do every all the miraculous things that they say they&#39;re going to do. The problem is they are priced today as if all of those miraculous things already happened. And these people are making bets that they&#39;re going to double price for what hasn&#39;t even happened that will happen. But you&#39;re already paying for what&#39;s going to happen. Therefore, if 10% less happens, the stock&#39;s down 70%. And that&#39;s what happens over and over. And that&#39;s why we continue to say avoid shiny objects and focus on things that you can put massive amounts of money to work and sleep like a baby at night because they&#39;re in a cyclical trough or they&#39;re temporarily impaired. Highquality businesses that are temporarily misappraised over and over, rinse and repeat. Take your doubles and triples onto the next and live a happy life and play a lot of golf. What else can I tell you? Um, moving on. Healthc care stocks are so bad they&#39;re good. What to buy now? All right, Ben Levenson, tell me what to buy now. Let&#39;s see what he&#39;s got. Ben&#39;s telling me to buy the Healthc Care Spider ETF. All right, we have the biotech. Uh, he&#39;s he&#39;s leaning towards United Healthcare. Um, he&#39;s probably right on that. Humanana. Okay. In the targets, Danaher. Yeah, kind of like that. Uh, Gilead, maybe. Abby, probably. I like this article. Look, Barren is awesome. Ben Leonson&#39;s a legend. He&#39;s put out a lot of good stuff. So, that&#39;s a good starting point. Why value investing has worked better outside the US. Good article in Morning Star. And that&#39;s now changing. What are they talking about here? International value. Alibaba is the number one waiting in the international value and growth index. Okay. Beyond Europe, this is a good article. Pull that up at Morning Star. Investors pile into ETFs at records pace despite market turmoil. US exchange traded funds have collected some 437 billion in new assets so far this year. They bought the dip just like they did in COVID. Advanced Auto Park Parts stock source 55% guidance is holding up in the face of tariffs. So, uh, they&#39;re executing on everything they said. They delevered the balance sheet. They shut the unprofitable stores. They consolidated the the distribution hubs. And now they&#39;re opening up new stores in the areas where they&#39;re number one and two, and it&#39;s working. Oh, and by the way, another dog has started to rise from the dead like a phoenix from the ashes. Canada goose sales up unexpectedly rise as luxury spending holds up. High-end coats posted a 7.4% increase in fourth quarter sales ahead of consensus estimates for a slight drop in the stock is now starting to rip. Clean up to comeback stock market and sentiment results. Advanced auto parts and vans. Um so you can see AAP is coming off the mat now. We&#39;ll just quickly go through some of the key points. You can read the full article at hedge funfundtips.com. It is entitled Cleanup to come back and that&#39;s kind of the story with both vans and with advanced auto parts. Love the title, Jeff. Good job. And um so let&#39;s just go through some of the key points here. First pro segment which makes up 60% of advanced auto parts sales continues to perform well posting low singledigit growth for the third straight quarter and delivering eight consecutive weeks of positive US pro comp sales. That momentum has continued into Q2 with strength sustained through the first four weeks. Supply chain consolidation continues to progress reducing the network from 38 varied distribution centers to 12 large distribution centers operating on a unified warehouse system. Look this this is what he said he was going to do. This is what he&#39;s doing. He&#39;s just doing it a little faster than expected. C uh completed storefront footprint optimization in March, well ahead of the original mid2025 guidance. Cash expenses for the plan are now 150 million for the full year, down from $200 million estimates. Transfer sales related to store closures were strong, primarily in the pro segment. Vance Auto Part is entering a new phase of store expansion, opening a 100 new stores in the next three years. That is not the sign of a company that&#39;s going out of business. That&#39;s a sign of a company that&#39;s just getting started. Store concentration and density have increased with 75% of the footprint in markets where Advanced Auto Parts holds the number one or number two position. Operating margins for the full year are still expected to be between two to 3%. Q2 is tracking in line with the state range with further gains expected in the second half. Most importantly, Advanced Auto Parts remains well on track to meet its 2027 target of 7% operating margins. All major company KPIs continue to improve. Store availability rose to the mid 90% up 200 basis points. DC labor productivity increased by low double digit percent versus fiscal year 2024. Time to serve improved by 10 minutes down to 40 minutes. Okay. Total exposure of advanced auto parts to China is only 10%. Management reaffirmed it fullear guidance of 8.4 billion to 8.6 billion in net sales. uh.5 to 1.5 comp sales growth, 2 to 3% operating margins, and 150 to 250 in adjusted diluted earnings per share. This is, you know, it&#39;s starting to reacelerate. That&#39;s what you want to see. Uh do-it-yourself is showing signs of stabilization. So, you can go through all the details here. And then Vans looked a lot worse than it actually was, or VF Corp rather. Vans is where the pressure is. They&#39;re still generating free cash flow. Cash flow is going to be up yearon year. That&#39;s the name of the game. They have the runway. Bracken is delivering. Um, okay. So, Vans was the big hit. Down 20% year-on-year compared to an 8% decline in the prior quarter. 60% of the decline, however, was due to deliberate cleanup efforts, including closing 8% of global van stores and reducing exposure to unproductive value channels, 35% along with inventory normalization in China contributing another 25%. These headwinds are expected to fade sequentially and fully lapsed by Q4 of this year. So this game is over. Adjusted for these actions, revenue would have been down high single digits. More importantly, these efforts drove significant gross margin improvement in vans. This is exactly what he did at Logitech. He increased gross margin by 900 basis points during his tenure and you had a a 28 bagger in his last turnaround deal. If you put in a million dollars when Bracken got involved in 2013, you got $28 million out when he left. So, you can see here in 2013, he got in, the stock was down over 85% and went straight from $5 to $131. We&#39;re going to see something like this in VF Corp. This guy is going to turn it around. It&#39;s just when it turns when it I can&#39;t emphasize this enough. when these things turn, it it starts to happen overnight. So, um, so it&#39;s it&#39;s a long time. It&#39;s like when you drive by when they&#39;re building a skyscraper. You drive by every week for a year and it looks like they&#39;re making no progress because all the progress is going on building the strong foundation beneath the surface. So, when you look from street level, you&#39;re like, there&#39;s no building. Like, what the hell is going on? But meanwhile, they&#39;re, you know, 30 levels down building that foundation, laying the foundation. And once that foundation is in place, you see 50 stories go up in a matter of months uh because the foundation has already been set. The same is the case Northace grew at 4 point 4% uh yearon year driven by 9% growth in global DTC. All regions contribute with double digits gains in America&#39;s and EMA. Outerware was the standout while footwear continued to grow across all regions. success management successfully delivered on the initial $300 million gross cost savings target. Plans to achieve 500 to 600 million in net operating expansion plus 10% margins by fiscal year 2028. So he&#39;s doing the exact same playbook that he did at Logitech when the stock was down 82%. Adjusted gross margins reached 53% up 560 basis points year-on-year. You don&#39;t see margin expansion of 560 basis points in a business that&#39;s doing poorly. While adjusted operating margins incre improved by 400 basis points, management reduced debt by 1.8 billion during the year, a 26% year-on-year decline, ending the quarter with 4.1 times net leverage, down a full turn, remains on track to reach 2.5 by fiscal year 2028. Net debt now stands at 4.94. Less than 2% of total US imports are sourced from China. Management estimates the annual ghost tariff impact current 10% rates to be about 150 million but expects to fully mitigate this through cost actions and optimized sourcing. Um new products advance continued to see strong demand. Super low pro launched in Q4 sold out its top two styles almost immediately. Management expects continued momentum throughout the year with back to school and holiday season starting to see influence on the new global brand president Sun Cho who came from Lululemon. Timberland&#39;s continued strength with sales up 13% year-on-year. Strong DTC growth combined with fewer discounts drove significantly higher margins for Q20 for fiscal year 2026. Management expects free cash flow to improve from 313 million include excluding profits from one-time non-core asset sales while also anticipating fullear operating margin expansion. Inventory reduction continues to pro progress down 4% year-on-year, though it would have been higher during the quarter without accelerated product shipments into the US during the 90-day tariff pause window. All right, so you can go through the highlighted parts. Um, Morning Star put out an article after earnings uh saying fair value is $40 a share. They&#39;re obviously being very conservative, but uh optimistic relative to consensus. Uh we think it&#39;s going to be a lot more with Bracken and um could be a very very many multibaggers. Canada Goose the free cash flow is going through the roof. The stock is starting to rebound up almost double off the lows and just be so you can go through some of the details here and what&#39;s happening uh on all fronts. They&#39;re executing on exactly what they said they were going to do. uh sentiment is improving to 65 but it&#39;s nowhere near extreme levels so there&#39;s probably some more upside uh and I think uh in on balance into July uh we remain pretty damn constructive so uh biotech earnings I think this is going to be an area of opportunity this has been slow coming but when it&#39;s when it comes in this group it comes all at once and the last big move by the way was in a similar period to what we&#39;ve been talking about Um, with China 2016 to 2018 off the lows, more than double in the index index, 150% move in a year and a half. I think we&#39;re kind of set up for something like that right now with all the pessimism around the group. Uh, and uh, we&#39;ll be very excited to see that finally start to manifest, but so earnings are down across, but that&#39;s kind of Oh, one of the things there was a chart showing the number of anyway the number of biotech stocks now trading. Let&#39;s see here. I got to I got to actually pull this one up. All right. So, here&#39;s the chart I want to show you on biotech that we missed in the earlier. Biotech trading below cash are at an all-time high. The number of biotechs trading below cash has spiked since year end 2024 and reached an all-time high of 133 in March 2025. Uh number of biotechs trading below cash on a percentage basis. More than 20% of biotechs are trading below cash i.e. liquidation value uh percent of biotech subcache. I mean this is unbelievable. This is another generational thing. Sentiment has gotten so extreme. We should probably have more exposure here because this this type of stuff happens once in a career. Um, so, uh, thanks for Stephen for sending that over. Appreciate it. All right, we got that. Oh, insider buying in VF Corporation. Brack and Daryl Abishek Dalmia and Richard Karuchi uh CEO, COO and director collectively purchased a total of $185,000 shares of VF Corp with prices ranging from 1173 to 1205 per share. The total out-of- pocket cost for these purchases was $2.2 million. So while everyone was selling down from 29 down to 12 on tariff fears and the people who have the most perfect information were buying every share they could get a hold of as were we. Um okay as far as data the big thing tomorrow is going to be the core PCE and PCE. Trump met with Powell today and said I want rates lower. Trump said um you know pound sand. Let&#39;s see what the inflation numbers look like tomorrow. Maybe there&#39;ll be some additional pressure, especially after these employment numbers today were a little bit weak. Uh continuing claims were higher than expected and um initial jobless claims were higher than expected, etc. Earnings estimates are holding up at 265 and 300. I think they&#39;re going to actually reacelerate. Most people are calling for the opposite. We&#39;ll see what happens. With that said, we&#39;re done with the podcast part of the podcast. We&#39;re now moving on to the ask me anything questions. And I have to warn you, we have more questions than I&#39;ve ever seen. So stay for as long or as short as you&#39;d like. But there are a lot of good questions and a lot of good companies that we&#39;re going to discuss. So stick around if you can. And if not, we&#39;ll see you next week, same time, same place. I&#39;m in California for the next few weeks. So excited. uh before going back to New York the end of June. Uh so let&#39;s see here. Ah that&#39;s the problem. I need to get to the inbox. All right. Uh okay. So Joe Cook asks, &quot;Happy Thursday. Thanks for everything you share on Leaps and Baba and then Ant Group has an IPO. Will that be good, bad, or indifferent for Leaps holders?&quot; Uh what may or may not happen with LEAPS? Uh look, LEAPS, you have a you know any options held in the US, you have a risk. It&#39;s a risk we&#39;re willing to take because we have so much stock. Even if the options go to zero, we&#39;re going to make enough bags on the stock that it will more than make up for it. But if you only own options, then you&#39;re just being a gambler. And you know, you still have D-listing risk. You still have uh all that. As it relates to Ant, we own 35% of the equity in Ant. So um that will just acrue to the value of Baba which should push the value andor price of we own the stock in Hong Kong 9988 up and uh commensurately the uh Baba shares andor options related to the shares in the US to the extent that they stay listed. We have made progress on the talks with China. Therefore, I do believe that it&#39;s un it continues to be unlikely that it&#39;s delisted, but it&#39;s not zero risk, which is why we pushed all of our shares into Hong Kong as a hedge. Uh, and that&#39;s that. But the ant factor is not an issue as it relates to that. It should be a net positive. Okay, next one. Thank you for the question. Nick Davies asked me to play golf in the UK. I don&#39;t have any plans to go to London, but I might have to go to Portugal this August. So, uh, in which case, um, I&#39;ll probably find a way to slip through based on the courses that you listed in your email because they&#39;re once in a lifetime courses. Uh, okay. AMA question for podcast. Love the cast. Tune in every week. Wonder if you take a look at Lionel Basil. I like the whole group. I think we covered it last week, so I&#39;m going to spend two seconds on it, but the short answer is it&#39;s definitely warrants a deep look. We don&#39;t have any position and probably don&#39;t intend to, but we do have some position in, uh, related companies. So, um, this one I think we didn&#39;t get excited about because cash flow hasn&#39;t really confirmed anything other than prices down for a reason, but I do think that&#39;s at a cyclical trough and you&#39;re probably spot on there. Um, okay. Got Nick, Evore, FMC, and Dow. Same thing. We&#39;ve covered these. We like them both. Uh, definitely weren&#39;t doing more work, but I think this these groups are going to start to recover abruptly. Chemical and A related names. Um, Dow I was less confident in than FMC, but let&#39;s just take a quick look. I think Dow might have a little more trouble. Let&#39;s Yeah, Dow&#39;s still negative cash flow, free cash flow. So, I want to see that start to inflect, but FMC looks a lot more promising if I recall. Yeah, they&#39;re cash flow positive. They&#39;re they&#39;re in just in a cyclical trough. I I kind of like that one. So, good work. Uh let&#39;s move on to the next one. Tom Florence. What other energy names besides CRK are interesting to you? [Music] Um, none yet. They haven&#39;t come down commensurate to the price. So, we&#39;ll keep looking. I think we&#39;re more interested in the servicesers. There&#39;s going to be a question on Hallebertton if gun to our head if we had to buy something more than that. Bottom line is I don&#39;t need to own everything. I, you know, when I size a position, we&#39;re we&#39;re we&#39;re trying to own 8 to 12 companies in a portfolio. So if we got exposure, we&#39;re already, you know, if it&#39;s an 8 to 10% position, we&#39;re already overweight. And then because it&#39;s gone up three bags, it&#39;s making a bigger and bigger weight on the portfolio. So we have enough energy exposure. We&#39;re not in a rush. And that&#39;s that&#39;s a you know I got a portfolio in today and they aed or last week they aed the portfolio in and there were like a hundred different positions in the portfolio like you know it&#39;s so guys do your work on a handful of companies and just own a concentrated portfolio of things that you know backwards, forwards, upside down and sideways. You can&#39;t be competent in that many things and that&#39;s that you don&#39;t have to be involved in everything. If you get a handful of good decisions, you&#39;re going to do extremely well and know everything about it. So just ignore the noise, own a handful of good companies and you&#39;ll be very very happy. Okay, trades and then how to Okay, so York is asking questions about trading. So York, you&#39;re obviously brand new, younger kid in college looking for uh trading advice. Puzzled by VF Corp&#39;s move up only on disclosure of inside buying. I mean, $2.5 million is serious buying when the stock&#39;s down that much and you see insiders write a check from their own pockets of multi-million dollars. That&#39;s that&#39;s pretty important. So, uh, why why were banks surprised? Banks weren&#39;t surprised to see anything. The market saw that as a vote of confidence for management. The underlying stock price got too despondent in the short term relative to the underlying fundamentals, which haven&#39;t really changed. And uh, and that was the move. So, uh, I think you&#39;re overthinking that, York, but it&#39;s a great question and and there&#39;s your answer. Uh, Lachland Neo, thoughts on CK Hutchinson Holdings, uh, triple01 HK. Let&#39;s see. H generating a lot of cash, low multiple. What do they do for a living? Let&#39;s see here. Industrials investment holding company ports and ports related services infrastructure telecom mainland China 5% yield. I mean, this is the problem and this is why there basically only a handful of companies will ever would ever consider owning in China on on p. There&#39;s going to be so many companies on paper that look incredible in China that turn out to be disasters. I I I don&#39;t think this is where you want to play. I think you basically want to own Alibaba or 10-centent. The reason I didn&#39;t like 10-centent is I don&#39;t like the gaming business. The government generally hates it. They&#39;re allowing it to happen right now just because they need China tech to recovery recover. But their fundamental view is that it&#39;s a bad thing for society and eventually they&#39;re going to come after it once they have the runway to do it. So Baba has the most outs most opportunities and the most things that government wants to promote right now. So just keep it simple. Mirror don&#39;t take country and company risk. You&#39;re taking country risk with China. It&#39;s a communist government. So you don&#39;t want to take country and company. Baba, as goes Baba, so goes China. So, you know what I said when Baba was down in the 60s and 80s is we&#39;re buying it because as as bad as Xihinping&#39;s decisions have been around uh policy and around its actions towards uh Alibaba, it&#39;s mutually assured destruction. If he destroys Baba, he destroys himself and he&#39;ll be carried out on a stretcher by another Tianan square. So, he blinked. He blinked a year past what we thought he would blink. he could take a lot more pain than we anticipated. But sure enough, as you saw social protests uh going up in terms of instances on the chart, which we tracked every single week. Uh eventually he finally blinked when he realized his power was at stake. So now he&#39;s full throttle because he realizes he&#39;s got to take things to the promised land and he doesn&#39;t want 20% unemployment among 25year-olds who are educated and angry. So he flipped it. He started massive stimulus. It&#39;s now c catching traction and it&#39;s going to be straight up over the next two years. Milan Kersner, high turnaround Tom. I&#39;ve been following you for three years now and shared your podcast with me with with my family members. Just want to say thank you for your amazing podcast. Well, thank you. More I listen, more I realize you&#39;re you&#39;re a Buffett in the making. Okay, there will only be one Buffett. So, very kind words. Uh but no one&#39;s in that category at all. Uh I&#39;m unique in what I do with turnarounds. is probably closer to what he did when he was running outside money with partnerships than what he did uh once he had a permanent capital vehicle, but um grateful for the kind words. Generous with your time and share your knowledge for free. I&#39;ll be a future client of yours soon. Thank you, Tom from Canet. Okay, no question there. Well, Milan, I think you&#39;re going to be a client sooner than you know. Very grateful for the kind words and it&#39;s nice to hear that because we put a lot of work into these every single week. Uh Jim Jeff, thanks for your time. Listen to the podcast and shared with friends for years. Thank you. By the way, if you&#39;re not a client and you don&#39;t do any business with us, that&#39;s absolutely fine and great. We&#39;re we&#39;re happy to deliver this value. The only thing we do ask is if you are getting value and you think this would benefit anyone in your sphere, friends and family who love the markets, please share the free podcast with them. They will get value. Pay it forward and good things will happen. So, very grateful for that. Um, feel like we talked about this back in October 2023. What do you think about IFF after its slump back towards the 5year low? I have been looking at it. I&#39;ll be honest. I&#39;m not going to I&#39;m not going to say anything one way or another. We don&#39;t own any shares yet, but um it&#39;s one that we are exploring because it does have a moat in its own little niche and uh it&#39;s in a cyclical trough and it&#39;s got runway. Uh, and we just want to have a little more clarity with the turnaround plan and make sure it&#39;s a a temporary versus a permanent impairment. But I think you&#39;re spot on with that one. Absolutely think you&#39;re spot on with that one and uh warrants much further work. Goran story chick this week I started position what seems to be an emerging turnaround story Cleveland cliffs because their dominant position US automotive industry electrical AI transformers will benefit for increased domestic auto production uh cost cutting steps another turnaround stories uh all right let&#39;s take a look I don&#39;t really like this name but let&#39;s take a look historically I It just tends to chronically fail. You&#39;re probably going to be right. I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re going to be right from $8 or $4, but it is a cyclical stock. Let me just see if it&#39;s got the runway and it&#39;s not going to risk getting stopped out. Yeah. No, not for me. This needs to change. I need to see some positive free cash flow and evidence of a turnaround, not a gamble on a turnaround. Let me just see. Maybe maybe they&#39;ve done that on a quarterly basis. No, there&#39;s still negative free cash flow. I I don&#39;t like it yet, but I&#39;ll keep an eye on it and I like the way you&#39;re thinking, but uh too early for me. All right, next. Tim Sanders, thanks for sharing your insights on the stock market. Always appreciate. Love to get your thoughts on Builder as a potential housing recovery play. Uh yeah, let&#39;s take a look. BLR. I feel like we did this one recently. Yeah, revenues and cash flow still going down consistent with the price as are margins. Let&#39;s take a look here. Yeah, this is not for me. I mean, this is this is one I mean, this has already had a 200 bag, so the fact that it&#39;s down 50%. I mean, if you get it perfect, you&#39;re going to get a double, uh, but you might get hurt. This this is a momentum this is a broken momentum stock at this point and I&#39;m not seeing trends start to move back in a positive direction after 200 bags. I&#39;m going to just pass for now. Play it better through Brad Jacobs. You know, you&#39;re buying Brad at the beginning stages of growth down here and not the ending stages after you&#39;ve had a run up. So, it&#39;s probably a good business. Let me just take a look here. It it there&#39;s just not enough margin of safety. If I could be down 50% or up a double, I I don&#39;t like that one to one. I need to be, you know, down 30% or up 3 4x for me to risk real capital. And this is just not giving me the riskreward that I&#39;m looking for right now. And I don&#39;t see a reaceleration of trends yet. Uh, and historically, it hasn&#39;t been a great business. So, I&#39;m going to just leave that one there. Uh, theme is right, execution, expression is wrong. How do you feel about Campbell versus Hormell? Uh, I don&#39;t like Campbell. We covered that. Uh Frank Brown rocket mortgages. Yeah, I think this is better quality than United Wholesale Mortgage Corp. Let me just take a look at it. You You definitely can win on this when the game comes back. So, it&#39;s consistent with the theme. Uh yeah, it hasn&#39;t turned yet, but it will. This is just a gamble on the theme, a leverage gamble on the theme. I think that one&#39;s probably the better play than you, United Wholesale Mortgage Corp. So, you&#39;re probably right there, Frank. I don&#39;t love it. I&#39;d rather just play it through the way I have it expressed than, you know, focus on that. Um, Yeah. So, this guy&#39;s talking about, you know, cash on the sidelines is not an indicator because when you take the cash to buy stock, the seller gets the cash. But you&#39;re missing the whole point. The point is that when risk appetite is on, the seller then takes that cash and reinvested in in more stock and there on balance more risk exposure is taken in across all asset classes and the asset class of money markets is diminished which is the measurement that we&#39;re referring to. So um and then you take another step in terms of margin that is being drawn which is also at lower levels which is also uh a sign of risk aversion that has a lot of capacity left to be uh much more buying power that then there&#39;s a lot less margin drawn and higher cash balances than you would ordinarily see any time near where at levels you see closer to bottoms than you see closer to tops is the right way to interpret it. But thank you for the question. Welcome to the podcast. On to the next. Rory McMullen, what&#39;s your opinion on SMR play? So headlines, price goes up, everyone chases Chinese shiny object. I would say um it&#39;s fine for now. It&#39;ll probably go higher. get interested when everyone forgets about it and it drops 30 40% and that&#39;s not the way I would play um small modular re reactors. I&#39;d play it with bigger companies. I like their CEO buying balance sheet looks okay. BY that&#39;s from Eric Klein. B Y O N beyond negative free cash flow, collapsing revenues, collapsing margins. What do you like about this again? What does this thing do? What is this? A website of the former Bed Bath and Beyond or something? I have no idea what this is. Beyond Inc. Where&#39;s the website? Let&#39;s see what they do. Yeah, Bed Bath and Beyond. So, okay. So, they bankrupted the the the brick and mortars. Now, they have a website. Um, look, on a chart basis, it looks cyclical. It probably recovers, but on a fundamental basis, I can&#39;t put money to work here. I&#39;m not seeing any signs of a turnaround yet. Um, balance sheets probably clean because they went through bankruptcy. Let&#39;s see. Or at least the parent did. Let&#39;s see. Cash 159. Long-term debt zero. Yeah. So, this is new co, I guess. and free cash flow negative for three years. I don&#39;t know. This is a trading vehicle. This is not a good quality business. Revenues have been declining for six years. They can&#39;t even blame it on COVID. Oh, they had a peak, okay, in 2021 and then they&#39;ve cut in half. I mean, I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re certain that this is the bottom, take a trading punt at it, but I I wouldn&#39;t touch it. Um, River, unless you clear, unless they&#39;ve laid out a turnaround plan, that makes an awful lot of sense and they&#39;re credible managers. I just I don&#39;t see it. River Rahhei been sharing with as many friends and family, but it&#39;s remarkable how many scare people get scared of two-hour podcast, video cast. So don&#39;t listen to two hours, listen to a half hour, get 25% of the value. What can I tell you? Listen to 10 minutes, get, you know, 5% of the value. Completely up to you. I give more than is expected of me. Uh so you could take or or leave as much as you want. But um anyway, listen to listening to your podcast for two hours every week has saved me years of work being closer to retirement. Appreciate all you do. So you&#39;re the one that benefits and the other ones that can take two. Look, I&#39;m condensing 80 to 100 hours plus of manh hours worth of work per week into one or two hours. So, you decide if that&#39;s valuable to you. Uh, you know, uh, and, uh, and you know, based on the numbers that thousands upon thousands of people have found that that&#39;s valuable and, um, and we&#39;re we&#39;re glad to do it. But, you know, we&#39;d we&#39;d love to do 10 minute or 20 minute podcast. You&#39;re just not going to get any value. Uh, and it&#39;s kind of a waste of everyone&#39;s time. So fact of the matter is if you want results it takes time and it takes effort and there&#39;s no shortcuts. So the people looking for shortcuts go follow some trading guru blow up your account in six months and then two years from now you can come back after you missed one of the greatest opportunities to buy high quality businesses at low prices and you can learn it and four years from now you&#39;ll be a decent investor. Um, okay. So, his question is, can you take a look at Civvy? CIVI cash flow cash flow positive. What do these guys do? Guess is their energy. EMP lowquality EMP. Let&#39;s see. These type of guys scare the hell out of me. When you see a stock that&#39;s split adjusted from $5,000 down to six and then it&#39;s 10 bags. This is a this is scumbaggery at its finest. Anyone who did this kind of stuff to stock is it&#39;s it&#39;s just a maybe they&#39;ve changed management, maybe they&#39;ve done this or that, but for me, they don&#39;t get a second chance. Anyone that does that that type of value destruction to owners is uh belongs in the wall of shame and should never work as a public company CEO. So now it looks like they&#39;re recovering revenues. They&#39;re recovering cash. I&#39;m just not going to take a bet. Maybe it&#39;s if it&#39;s brand new management and the management is from a credible places, then fine, have at it. Understand the assets. Maybe it&#39;s a great opportunity. For me, I I don&#39;t like to play in those lowquality EMP names. It&#39;s just too I mean, with with with Comtock, I&#39;m betting with a proven winner. Like, I don&#39;t have to think about it. I And I&#39;m betting Perry Puer. I bought it basically at the same stock price that Jerry Jones owns 70% of the company. I don&#39;t have to think a lot. I mean, only the public markets can give you that opportunity. In the private markets, he&#39;d have 80,000 promotes ahead of me before I&#39;ve even made a dollar. Uh, the price would never get that lower because the offering would be so highly valued based on his name and his track record of success. That&#39;s why what I do is the greatest job in the world. It is nothing comes close. I see private market deals all there&#39;s nothing like what we do in the public markets. We benefit from the short-term voting machine of euphoria and dispondency and the price movements that that diverge dramatically from underlying intrinsic value. There&#39;s literally no game like it in the world. Um so that said, uh let&#39;s go to Theo Dmont. Theo Dumont, uh, Petershill Partners. Okay, Peter Shill. Okay, UK equity, that&#39;s kind of interesting to me. Cash flows declined along with stock price. Revenues are dimminimous. What? What the hell is this thing? Private equity firm. No way. Private equity firms are made up of sellside investment bank exelside investment bankers who historically have figured out a way to extract value versus trade value. It&#39;s nothing wrong with it. It&#39;s just in their DNA. They&#39;re extractors, not creators. And I just don&#39;t like the cultural fit. you know, ne never have I heard I invested alongside a sellside investment banker and got rich. I mean, it&#39;s just it&#39;s uh let&#39;s just pass on that. I appreciate the on paper you were right, but I&#39;ve been to this movie before. They will do well, you will not. Bob Atkins, I enjoyed your weekly video cast for months and appreciate your insight. Love that you put your family first. Admire that quality. Thoughts on Hallebertton as a drilling play? I think if I had to add another energy play gun to my head, which I don&#39;t, uh, this would probably be the first place I&#39;d look. And the second place I would look is, um, slumberj. I think that&#39;s the way to play it because if oil prices stay low, kind of like MLPS, but MLPS, you don&#39;t have a similar upside. Again, these just haven&#39;t come down enough for me to get excited. But I think Hallebertton&#39;s probably a better play. I think the cash flow is fine. think the revenues are fine. I I like it. I like it, Bob. Good. Good one. All right. Next. Um Jimmy Jones, Oscar Health. That&#39;s uh Kushner&#39;s brothers promote. Let&#39;s see. See, R. I think they&#39;re doing some interesting things there, but it&#39;s still like a speculative. Oh, no. They&#39;re now generating a ton of cash. Okay. Well, that&#39;s good. Um OSCR I mean, was this a spa? This might be It&#39;s funny. I was talking with some super incredibly smart people in Dubai and we were we&#39;re trying to brainstorm like quote unquote what&#39;s uninvestable now. And it&#39;s like quote unquote failed spacks. Like anything that was a spack has a stigma attached to it. Now, I think this might have been one. Um, this one you just really have to understand the business cuz like it&#39;s very hard to break into health care as a startup. Offers health plans to individuals, families, employers, health care system engagement. Enterprise value is 1.64 billion. What are they doing in terms of business? It&#39;s a lot of cash they have, great balance sheet, billion dollars of free cash flow. Geez. All right. So, this is one I got to look at and understand the business cuz this is this is like a too hard pile, but it&#39;s kind of interesting given the players that are involved and how low the valuation&#39;s got. So, um so I think on the surface you&#39;re right, but now you got to really dig in and understand the business. Uh all right. So, uh, Agathan Rex, thank you for the long five-page analysis of carry trade and petro dollars and all that stuff, but there&#39;s nothing about that that gives me anything actionable about buying a piece of a business and making money on it. So, I&#39;m not going to spend time on it. This that&#39;s for some macro podcast pontificating about things that may or may not happen that have zero value on how we invest. Chris Booker Brooker uh Doc Martens docs. Yeah, I&#39;m seeing a lot of these stores pop up around here. Was that Fashion Island today? Dr. Martins plc. Wow, look at that. Revenues are down, cash flow is up. Docs, huh? Look at this thing. Why is this so see I hate these plays even like Crocs I can&#39;t stand because it&#39;s it&#39;s like a it&#39;s a bet on a fad persisting for longer than 12 to 24 months. It&#39;s why like VF Corp you got a lot of outs. this you&#39;re just betting on like are you at the end of the fad the beginning because it&#39;s cyclical. Doc Martens were big when I was young then no one would wear them for 20 years you know and it just keeps coming back. Um market cap 557 million pounds. What is the Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on here. Revenue is declining a little bit. What&#39;s happening to share account here? Share account&#39;s coming down. Balance sheet 140 million. How much debt? 300. It&#39;s kind of okay. Enterprise value 1.4. 4 billion. What kind of cash flow again? All right. Yeah, I just want to understand how sales are going to reacelerate. Um, but generally it&#39;s worth exploring and understanding the turnaround plan. How are they going to reacelerate sales cuz it looks okay. I I I I I&#39;ll probably never wind up in it just because you&#39;re betting on one brand and the the fads are too hard to predict. But you might have a decent enough margin of safety if you do the work. So, um, there you go. Uh, new client inquiry. Matt in NC says, &quot;Just a comment, no question. Why I need Tom Hayes managing my account? I work in a taxable account. I was going to have realized gains from all the successes I&#39;ve had using Tom&#39;s advice.&quot; Well, it&#39;s opinion, not advice. [Music] Um, so I thought I would get smart and sell my Advanced Auto Parts stock and options on 58.25 for $32 per share to actualize an offsetting loss with a plan to simply buy it back in one month on 692025. After all, this has been dead money for years. Also, just to be quote safe, I set a price at $34, figuring if it jumped, I&#39;d simply get back in and accept the wash sale. But, of course, the price gapped up from 32 to 44. Now, it&#39;s over 50, by the way. uh and marked open 521 up to 48 in a day and I missed the 50% move. Can&#39;t wait to hit the million-dollar mark and fork my money over to Tom. Avoid acting on bad ideas like this one. Thanks for all you do, avid listener now about four to five years. Yeah, man. It&#39;s Look, I appreciate that&#39;s very kind and you&#39;re right. I mean, I give you a tremendous amount of value, but at the end of the day, the intangible that makes all the difference is not knowing it intellectually. It&#39;s like it&#39;s knowing your strengths and weaknesses. It&#39;s like no one calls me up and they say, &quot;Hey, Tom Hayes is a great investor and he knows everything about business and financials. Let&#39;s call him up to be the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company. Maybe he can operate the whole business.&quot; It&#39;s like that&#39;s not, you know, uh you got to know your strengths and it&#39;s like the intangible, the ice in the veins, the turnaround time, the knowing what you own. It&#39;s like you can understand that intellectually, but you either have it genetically or you don&#39;t. And like 99.9% of the people like I&#39;m a genetic defect. Like God gave most people a FOMO gene. Fear of missing out. They got to be involved in everything because their neighbors getting rich on this. Their neighbor&#39;s getting I I didn&#39;t get the gene. Like you know the guy next to me could make 17 billion dollars on Bitcoin in a week. I&#39;d just be super happy for him. I wouldn&#39;t be like, &quot;Oh, I should have bought Bitcoin.&quot; Listen, that&#39;s not what I do. It&#39;s like, you know, it&#39;s like a professional hockey player. It&#39;s like, why why didn&#39;t I make 80 million as a professional basketball player instead of 8 million as a professional hockey player? It&#39;s just not what you&#39;re genetically designed to do. So, um, you kind of acknowledging that is is smart. And that&#39;s 99% of the people. Honestly, the smartest people in the world are not the the the the people like me. It&#39;s the people who build businesses, sell them for hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, and then hire a guy like me to grow it for them, and they sit on the beach, and they play golf, and they they enjoy their life, and they don&#39;t have to think about this. This is 247 thing. You got to be thinking about all the time. I mean, and and in order to do it and do it well, you have to love it. And you have to be a genetic defect that is actually wired to do well from this type of business. Because what makes most businesses work and most entrepreneurs rich is the exact opposite of what makes one successful in this business. In the real world, as an entrepreneur, you get paid for massive action equals massive results. Fail fast, keep going. Fail fast, keep going. Fail fast, keep going. In the investing business, it is exactly the opposite. thoughtful, diligent work, make a couple smart decisions, sit on your hands and have the discipline not to get faked out uh until you realize intrinsic value. Why? Because you know the underlying business, you know the trends, you&#39;ve done the work, etc. And that&#39;s just like just very few people are genetically wired that way. So, uh the value is in understanding it intellectually and then being extra smart like Matt and saying, you know what, I&#39;m going to go build a fortune, build a build a couple businesses. You know why so many people get rich in real estate? Yes, it&#39;s t tax tax advantage, but more than that, they can&#39;t sell. They don&#39;t have daily liquidity. If they get a headline that says pending sales are down, they can&#39;t flip out of 16 apartment buildings. They just have to hold through it until the next cycle and then they hit the window and they, you know, make many times their money because they are forced holders versus easy sellers in the in the euphoria and dispondency of the voting machine that is the stock market. So, uh, really brilliant insight there and you&#39;ll be there faster than you know. Max Hughes, what do you think of ADM? Archer Daniels Midland. I think I&#39;ve been looking at this one a little bit. I think you&#39;re probably right there. If I&#39;m not mistaken, this is a dividend aristocrat and we&#39;re at the bottom of the cycle like the FMC&#39;s. We were going to go through commodities. We don&#39;t have enough time. Um, yeah, I just want to see a little bit of improvement on the free cash flow before we go hand over fist. But I think you got a decent enough margin of safety here and it&#39;s a good enough durable business that um I mean if you got if you got blessed and could get it with a threehandle, you should try to do that. I&#39;d be in no rush to jump here and I&#39;m totally happy to miss this one and I probably will, but I think you&#39;re generally spot on. I just cautious on that free cash flow. Let me just see what the balance sheet looks like. I mean, businesses have been around for decades. It&#39;s just a question of runway. So, the balance sheets a little weaker than it was. Let&#39;s take a look at the debt. Yeah, they&#39;ll probably still be okay, though. It&#39;s just never been an extraordinary business. But I Yeah, I think with something like this, you put a $40 alert. If you get a 30 high30 handle, you probably buy a little bit and start to do the work uh and start to do the work in the meantime. I think you&#39;re generally right. The question is what at what point and when and is it the highest and best use of capital? And I think for me, it&#39;s not the highest and best use of capital. Hi Tom, love all your videos. Watching everything you posters. Appreciate sharing your knowledge. Uh, new core steel stocks generally suck. Um, I think we even covered this last week. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s come down enough. Just a simple answer for my appetite. these things the these are the definition of not only I mean it&#39;s the best in the bunch but I mean I don&#39;t think relative to the way revenues margins and cash flow have fallen I don&#39;t think the stock has fallen enough yet so I&#39;m going to pass and if it gets lower I&#39;ll revisit it Dennis Amato have been listening to your podcast for the last couple months believe your value has been value approach is quite sound. I think you&#39;ve stated a couple times that you&#39;re beginning to look for ways to play energy. Was wondering what you think of Halmerick and Payne HP. Yeah, I&#39;ve looked at this one. Um I think this falls into the Hallebertton category, but Hallebertton is a better play, higher quality. Yeah, I think on this one you want to kind of start to see that cash flow turn. Yeah, I I think you just want to you&#39;re probably okay with this one. I I would rather see you in Hallebertton to be honest with you. This is unreal. Frank Penbert, hardest lesson you&#39;ve ever learned in your investing career. Don&#39;t chase shiny objects. Payton Hops, love your deep value approach in a world of cookie cut investments. When it comes to com resources, you called the relative bottom. What signals are you looking for to start eyeing an exit reducing your position? How much does the Ukraine Russia war ending or tariff trade deals change the future demand of natural gas? I that&#39;s excuse me that&#39;s noise I can&#39;t I have no control over I could care less about that as far as the intrinsic value of the stock we&#39;ve covered it in the past uh proven plus unproven 15 years of unproved reserves that&#39;s not recorded on the balance sheet PV10 is the only thing reported to the SEC the answer is a lot higher it&#39;s been a triple I think it could probably almost double from here Um, so that means it&#39;ll probably be when all is said and done at least a 56 bagger. All right, next. Um, Han Jancock. All right. So, he&#39;s saying, &quot;Should I buy QXO now that it&#39;s run from 13 to 18 or whatever it is? You say you never buy on on green days.&quot; Uh, hope you don&#39;t hate abstract questions. I do hate abstract questions. We&#39;re here to make the listeners money, but I appreciate you sending the question. The answer is I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. Like, uh, new money in today. Am I buying QXO up, you know, 50% in a month? Probably not. I&#39;m probably going to look for the things that haven&#39;t moved yet. And maybe if it gets back to 15, put some money to work there. But um yeah, look, if you&#39;re okay buying it at 18 and it goes to 10 before it goes to 80, then you should buy it today. Um so I don&#39;t have a good answer for you, but it wouldn&#39;t be my first choice today. Let&#39;s just put it that way. Cork Snider, start my bike ride from San Francisco to San Diego for mental health May 30th. got a large sponsorship for the cause in Tevaarmacies. What are your thoughts on that? Teva is a generic. That business has been decimated and I think it&#39;s finally recovering after all the lawsuits and everything else. Um, it&#39;s up a lot already, but it probably has more room to run. It&#39;s not my first choice of highest and best used, but I think it&#39;s higher uh and maybe materially higher 3 to 5 years from now if you&#39;re going to play generics. And this falls into healthcare bucket. This is probably a decent spot to start. So, good one, Cork. Uh, good luck. And then, uh, Nick Hill Jane Vistry Group UK Home [Music] Builder. Let&#39;s take a look. Yeah, I think this checks a lot of boxes, but again, I&#39;d rather play the arms dealers than the waring factions cuz their margins this is I mean this is probably fine. Let me just check the balance sheet here. Yeah, I I think you&#39;re okay. I think decent play. It&#39;s a good find. Just get a little comfortable with the turnaround story and you&#39;re fine. So, nice find there. I&#39;d rather play the home builders, but the home the building suppliers, but as far as that goes. It checks enough boxes. I like it. Thanks for sharing. Well done on the money show. Really nice presentations, keynote. Nice work, team. All the update. Big kudos. Thank you. Uh, if you could only pick one of Brad Jacobs businesses gun to your head, would you go for GXO or QXO? Uh, probably QXO. I think GXO is probably a triple or quadruple. I&#39; I&#39;d say no. I would say it&#39;s probably a triple from here, whereas QXO from where we bought it is probably a seven bagger. Uh, it&#39;ll just take longer. So, uh, guns not to my head. I don&#39;t have to pick one. That&#39;s why I own both. And, uh, I&#39;m happy with that decision. Quack, should the J Japan bond market be something to worry about? Well, we were talking about that all last year. So, you&#39;re a little late on that because the draw down in MAG 7 as a result of that already happened. Now, they&#39;re going to bounce back to the top of the range. So, yeah, continue to keep an eye on that. But um it all it predominantly is going to affect is the high concentration in mag 7 which it already has. Uh Sebastio Pinero, my name is Sebastio. I&#39;m a huge Portuguese fan of yours. That&#39;s great because I&#39;m half Portuguese and uh own some land over there. You once responded to a comment of mine about the great golf courses here in Portugal and I was very glad to learn about your connection to my country. Sending you this message to ask you about Sovice Energy and Biomarin. Ooh, he&#39;s sneaking in too with all that sweet talk. All right, you&#39;re going to get away with it, my man. My Portuguese brother here. Uh, so the problem with Sovous is it&#39;s a lower quality EMP. For me, it&#39;s not the highest and best use. It hasn&#39;t come down enough relative to the operating leverage and probably the leverage in the balance sheet. Uh, so no, I wouldn&#39;t play that one. um it&#39;ll probably be okay, but for me it hasn&#39;t come down enough relative to the low quality of a business it is. Uh which can catch cyclical turns. Biomarine I think is a better play. You just have to understand the pipeline well enough, but um I do think you want to get some. We don&#39;t do individual names in biotech, but this is more of an established farmer company. Kind of looks like Biogen a little bit. Um, I think this is one that&#39;s on our target that if we did go into an individual farmer stock, this would be high on the list. Just it takes a lot of work on the pipeline and everything else to get confidence, but I think you&#39;re definitely on the right track and um probably do fine with that. That could be a double for you. Um, next, Adam Dyer. All right. He&#39;s asking all about the SLR, rates, currencies, all this stuff. It&#39;s nonsense. Pick a business that generates free cash flow that&#39;s growing. The weaker dollar will be a tailwind. related to your question, but Adam, you&#39;re complicating things and focusing on the things that don&#39;t matter and not enough time on the things that do matter. The underlying business, the free cash flow, the revenue growth. Stop worrying about all the macro noise that you can&#39;t. Yeah, we have a view that rates might do this and the dollar might do that, but it&#39;s unrelated to the the equities. The equities are trading the micro kind of gives us the view of the macro, not the macro giving us the view of the micro. It starts with the business. It starts with the bottoms up and then you say, well, why did the price get so derated and then you start to see, well, it&#39;s because of this condition and this condition. Well, are those conditions at an extreme enough levels that they could inflect and and create a an unnatural tailwind for the business which is naturally improving? Yes. So, that would be a double tailwind, but the business has to have an intrinsic tailwind and that stuff is just kind of noise that takes you out of the field. Um, QXO launch. Okay, so he&#39;s asking about the offering. Here&#39;s the bottom line. All you need to know about QXO because people keep asking me about the offering. Brad Jacobs put $150 million of his own money at QXO when it was in the hole. Okay. QXO 2000, not QXO, XPO 2011. I don&#39;t know if it was 2009 or 2011. It doesn&#39;t matter. Bottom line is stock was an 80 bagger or 160 bagger depending when he put it in. I think it was 2011 whatever. Okay. He&#39;s put in $900 million of his own money before I did. Okay. So any follow on offerings he thinks are beneficial at the price and for the reasons and in the structure that he&#39;s done. he thinks that his 900 million investment will be better off in the future than it is today by doing the offering. So on that basis, considering he&#39;s got meaningfully more skin in the game than I do, uh, and he&#39;s got a proven track record of doing this five, four, five times, um, I&#39;m supportive of any offerings that he does at the right price, especially when the stocks move so much in such a short period of time, it&#39;s already absorbed it and they&#39;re going to use that thing for creative acquis acquisitions now that they have a platform company and they did it in the convert. I I like how he did it. I like why he did it. But as far as what do I have to worry about, uh he&#39;s got 900 He&#39;s got, you know, 800 million more reasons to worry than I do. Uh and um you know, so I would just trust the process with Brad Jacobs and not overthink that. This is not some scumbag that&#39;s paying getting paid a million dollars and sucking a million dollars of options out of the company and has no net worth and is just a salesman running a company. This is a guy who is a principal investor alongside with us and happens to have opera operating prowess and a history of creating wealth for his owners, namely himself as the biggest owner and all the other folks that are lucky enough to ride along with him and let him do all the work and make us tons of money. So, uh, for me, I&#39;m 100% supportive of that. Longtime listener, this is Martin Griswaski Grias Suski Global Payments. No. Lower quality than PayPal. This thing has always had hair. I don&#39;t like it as much. I think it&#39;s probably works. Let&#39;s just take a look at some of the financials. I would stick with PayPal. I forget what the hair was in this business. Something I&#39;ve hated about it from the past. Software solutions. Yeah, I I don&#39;t think this has as much of a margin of safety. Let me just take a look here. 15 billion of debt, two billion of cash. It&#39;s a lot more leverage than uh it&#39;s never really compounded money at a decent clip. This is a lower quality business. I I I don&#39;t want to own this relative to if that&#39;s the choice, you own PayPal. There&#39;s no question. It&#39;s not even in the same neighborhood. Like could you make a a trade off of this lowquality business for a double? Maybe, but PayPal&#39;s a whole different game, whole different leadership, whole different plan, whole different stronghold. Um, okay. Uh, Griffin Brown, hope you had a great trip. Have you ever built a position based off a listener&#39;s idea? Um, not yet, but a lot of good ideas are coming in, so could could happen sooner rather than later. Sada. What is this? A beating down chip play sensors central resolutions performance. Um, so this is like a chip autoplay. kind of like this one for a double. Let me just make sure you&#39;re going to be in business. Take a look at the balance sheet here. Generating free cash with balance sheet. $600 million of cash. $3 billion of debt. They brought it down a little bit. Um yeah, look, I think if you can understand the business, understand how this topline number is going to reacelerate. Share counts coming down. I I think you&#39;re probably okay there. Got to understand it a little bit better, but I think you&#39;re I think you&#39;re on track there. Um good good one, Griffin. Daniel Garner from a Money Show Miami follower. Hey Tom. Uh, French luxury LVMH. Yeah, this is a high quality business. Let&#39;s just take a look here. I mean, this this is definitely compounder. It&#39;s not for me, but I think if you own this thing for a while and you&#39;re not worried about short term, I think long term you&#39;re going to make good money with this. I have to produce for my investors in a reasonable amount of time, 24, 36 months, meaningful production. And I think this is going to be a longer term play from these levels, but um I think it&#39;s a good business and will continue to be a good business. So cash flows kind of been flat for the last 3 four years after spiking a lot in COVID. They&#39;ve been able to retain those levels. Margins seem okay. This is all blocked out. Let me just see if I can get rid of net debt. the cash flow is totally recovered. Let&#39;s take a look here. These got hit with China. So revenue peaked, it declined. Let&#39;s take a look at quarterly. See if it&#39;s starting to come back. It&#39;s been managed well because despite the revenue decline. Yes. So 3Q. What? Where the hell? Hold on for a second. Okay. The quarterly is not active. All right. ROIC cash flow. And what a balance sheet. Well, 42 billion of debt, net debt. All right. 42 billion. 14 billion of cash. Take a look at the share account. Yeah, I don&#39;t think you really go wrong with this. Um, I think you&#39;re right, Daniel. I think it&#39;s great. I think it&#39;s a good price. A great business at a good price. I tend to like good businesses at great prices. So, you know, Buffett evolved. I have not, you know, but when Buffett was managing outside money in his partnerships, he like he liked, you know, good businesses at great prices. And then, you know, he says that uh Munger convinced Munger didn&#39;t convince him to do anything. He was always always running the show. And what what changed was not Munger whispering in his ear because Munger was whispering in his ears when they were both running partnerships. What changed was he went from having um uh outside partnerships where he had to produce outsized returns in a relatively short period of time, 24 36 months to a permanent capital vehicle where he had free float coming in every single month, more than he could possibly invest. And uh he wanted to be in long-term compounders that he could just set and forget. And if they, you know, like uh BYD he bought in 2019 had, you know, five 50 to 80% draw downs before 2020 when it went up 12x in one month and then the IRRa over 11 years made sense. If you&#39;re managing outside money, you can&#39;t do that. So, um I think if you&#39;re just buying this as an individual and you&#39;re not accountable to anyone but yourself and you&#39;re, you know, 50 or younger, like, yeah, this thing&#39;s going to compound over time and it&#39;s going to benefit from the China recovery. And I think this is a no-brainer. I mean, uh, I absolutely love the idea and, uh, uh, well done. Okay, got that. We&#39;re done. We&#39;ll be back next week. Same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] out.
