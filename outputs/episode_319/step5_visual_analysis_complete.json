Uh and as always, let's start with family first, then we'll get down to business. Got to spend some great time with the fam at the beach this weekend after being gone so much in November. We had a great weekend at the beach together riding bikes. And that's the girls at the playground. Uh there's Mimi and Annabelle. There's Caitlyn with Lucky, our dog. So really special time. Uh then this morning I had the privilege to join the great Stu Vney on Fox Business thanks to Payton Jennings. We're going to listen in here. The only guy pre-market that is Dow up 100, NASDAQ up 103. Same again. Tom Hayes is with me. Do you see any pullbacks greater than 10% in the next 6 months? I don't think so, Stu. You know, on average since 1928, you get a 20% pullback every 3 and 1/2 years. We have had three in the last 5 years. So, we've pulled forward a lot. We're suffering from recency bias. We think another one is coming. I think more modest. You know, you get a normal 10% correction every 13 months on average. That's realistic. Maybe you go 13, 14, 15% uh midyear correction, but I wouldn't expect that 20% that everyone's looking for. I think we've got a strong economy. We've got an easing Fed. We've got 316 central bank rate cuts this year. A lot of liquidity and quantitative tightening is ending in December. So 10% corrections normal. 1520 maybe not so much. Okay. Meta is buying chips from Google. Is this a breaking point in the AI chip market? I think this is close to a deepseek moment. And what's important about this is the TPUs, tensor processing units are cheaper and they take up less energy. And most importantly, they are outside Nvidia's ecosystem, which tells you costs are going to come down. the monopoly may be going away for Nvidia and you're seeing that in the market cap of Google almost 4 trillion the market cap of Nvidia down to 4 trillion so they're almost par pu and everyone knows Gemini 3 was trained on these TPU chips and it's faster sharper and deeper reasoning than open AI so uh a lot to be interested in here moving forward okay here's the question which a lot of people are asking especially at this time of here is do you have any reason to believe that stocks will go down and stay down for a period of years? See, I remember the 1970s which were awful for stock market investors. Is there any chance we'll get the same thing this time? Stocks down, stay down. What do"

We've seen it in recent weeks with the Core Weeaves, with the Palunteers, and with the Nvidias. Uh you knew it was coming. Most people were blindsided and um what was the six and a half percent pullback in the S&P that we had been calling for which is called a secondary correction. On average in years you get 15% corrections or more and then reach all-time highs. The secondary correction averages 6.5%. That's exactly where we were intraday last Thursday. Is it over? I'm not sure. We still have a little bit of hedge on uh but as you know we were putting more money to work and um the names that we're putting money to work we don't really care what happens with the general indices because we're just grateful to buy them at the current prices. Um if the Fed cut happens as is 85% expected probably the most pain is in the rear view mirror. I think you'll probably get one more scare before the December 10th meeting. Maybe a retest, maybe a cut through just to really mess with people. Uh but if that cut goes through, should be okay from there. Uh stuff is old, we're due for a reinvestment cycle. That's capex that helps cyclicals. Weaker dollar equals EPS tailwind. We estimate for every 10% drop in the US dollar represents about a 3 percentage point boost to S&P earnings. We're seeing that in estimates for next year go up to 308 from 305. So that's positive. Uh on track for a record year in healthc care M&A. So that's gone"

That meant the rest of the business, whether ESPN, DTC, the studio assets, or the linear networks, was essentially being thrown in as a free flyer. So, you can see here experiences uh 11% Kagger sports operating income and the entertainment operating income is really starting to take off. At the time, Mr. market had assigned these segments close to zero value simply because Disney hit a few bumps and took its eye off the ball. But with a 1000year plus operating history and a long record of navigating cycles, we were more than willing to take the other side. With a margin of safety that large with a margin of safety that large and a business this durable, it didn't take rocket science to see the value. We expected that once I returned, he would write the ship and get these segments back on track so Disney could get back to doing what it does best. In the meantime, the experiences segment would buy the company time to work through the hiccups, build out its next growth engine, DTC, and squeeze the remaining juice out of the linear networks. Fast forward today, and our original thesis remains firmly intact. The only difference is that those same businesses once written off as having zero value have come roaring back and are stronger than ever. DTC just posted 1.3 billion of operating income and is on track for 10% operating margins in fiscal year 2026 after posting a $4 billion loss only three years ago. The film slate is the strongest it has been in years with the studio delivering four one plus billion dollar releases over the past two years while no other studio delivered a single one. Again, none of this required a stroke of genius. It simply required knowing what we owned, understanding the cycles, and recognizing that sentiment swings to extremes and eventually reverts to the mean. So, it should be no surprise that our confidence continues to grow with or without Mr. Market's manic reaction in the short term. We continue to see Disney as one of the most durable businesses with some of the strongest IP on the planet. As a double-digit earnings compounder that lets us sleep like a baby at night, Disney remains a no-brainer. And sooner or later the market will come around to that reality.

Um, but if we got some rug pull from the Fed uh and break through this, you know, that's where the 6147 comes into play.
