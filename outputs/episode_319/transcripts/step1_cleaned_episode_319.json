  "cleaned_transcript": "### MISCELLANEOUS\n...then we'll get\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI had the privilege to join the great Stu Vney on Fox Business. Do you see any pullbacks greater than 10% in the next 6 months? I don't think so, Stu. You know, on average since 1928, you get a 20% pullback every 3 and 1/2 years. We have had three in the last 5 years. So, we've pulled forward a lot. We're suffering from recency bias. We think another one is coming. I think more modest. You know, you get a normal 10% correction every 13 months on average. That's realistic. Maybe you go 13, 14, 15% uh midyear correction, but I wouldn't expect that 20% that everyone's looking for. I think we've got a strong economy. We've got an easing Fed. We've got 316 central bank rate cuts this year. A lot of liquidity and quantitative tightening is ending in December. So 10% corrections normal. 1520 maybe not so much. Okay. Meta is buying chips from Google. Is this a breaking point in the AI chip market? I think this is close to a deepseek moment. And what's important about this is the TPUs, tensor processing units are cheaper and they take up less energy. And most importantly, they are outside Nvidia's ecosystem, which tells you costs are going to come down. the monopoly may be going away for Nvidia and you're seeing that in the market cap of Google almost 4 trillion the market cap of Nvidia down to 4 trillion so they're almost par pu and everyone knows Gemini 3 was trained on these TPU chips and it's faster sharper and deeper reasoning than open AI so uh a lot to be interested in here moving forward okay here's the question which a lot of people are asking especially at this time of\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nStu Vney on Fox Business thanks to Payton Jennings. We're going to listen in here. The only guy pre-market that is Dow up 100, NASDAQ up 103. Same again. Tom Hayes is with me. Do you see any pullbacks greater than 10% in the next 6 months? I don't think so, Stu. You know, on average since 1928, you get a 20% pullback every 3 and 1/2 years. We have had three in the last 5 years. So, we've pulled forward a lot.

See, I remember the 1970s which were awful for stock market investors. Is there any chance we'll get the same thing this time? Stocks down, stay down. What do you think? Zero chance. The average age of the millennials is 34. And historically, when you have the bulk of your population at that age, this is when they start fmation, housing formation, they make babies, they spend money, you tend to have boom times, and that's going to continue for at least another 5 to seven years. Uh so we remain constructive. You have progrowth policies. You have an accommodative Fed that is coming into power. Uh we've heard the rumblings about the new picks for 2026. Uh and you have an easing cycle just beginning. So any weakness now, we've got an 85% chance baked in of a cut in December. I think you want to get through that Fed meeting and ensure that cut is in place and then you can start to get uh put some money to work and put it to work selectively. Okay. We're very glad to have you on the show right before Thanksgiving and we hope you're right. Tom Hayes, see you again soon. You have a good Thanksgiving. We'll see you later. Happy Thanksgiving. Take a look. I've got And we're back. Uh, and on to our\n\nZero chance. The average age of the millennials is 34. And historically, when you have the bulk of your population at that age, this is when they start fmation, housing formation, they make babies, they spend money, you tend to have boom times, and that's going to continue for at least another 5 to seven years. Uh so we remain constructive. You have progrowth policies. You have an accommodative Fed that is coming into power. Uh we've heard the rumblings about the new picks for 2026. Uh and you have an easing cycle just beginning. So any weakness now, we've got an 85% chance baked in of a cut in December. I think you want to get through that Fed meeting and ensure that cut is in place and then you can start to get uh put some money to work and put it to work selectively. \n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nEveryone has the brain power to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you're susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds altogether. And I can't emphasize this enough. The smart people know uh, the entrepreneurs who made money in the real world know that action is the name of the game in the real world. That's what made them rich. Inaction is the name of the game in the investment world. Uh and that's why they hire me to do it for them because uh they became rich through massive action and that's the opposite of what gets you incredible results in the markets. So\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nquotes of the week , uh, from the great Peter Lynch. Everyone has the brain power to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you're susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds altogether. And I can't emphasize this enough. The smart people know uh, the entrepreneurs who made money in the real world know that action is the name of the game in the real world. That's what made them rich. Inaction is the name of the game in the investment world. Uh and that's why they hire me to do it for them because uh they became rich through massive action and that's the opposite of what gets you incredible results in the markets. So\n\nmoving along , uh Bruce Greenwald, there are no bad days in the market. When the market is down, you've got bargains. And it's lovely to think of what you are buying at low prices. When the market is up, the bargains have been gone, but you're rich. So, that's the way it works.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlet's get down to data . How often does the stock market decline? A 1% drop happens 50 to 60 times a year. A 3% drop happens seven or eight times a year. 5% pullbacks happen three to four times a year. 10% drops happen every 13 months. A lot of people forget that. They think it's, oh my goodness, this is the end of the world. No, it's the end of 13 months. basically on average since 1928. Uh 15% drop happens every two years. A 20% drop happens every 3 and a half years. I touched on that with Stu today. Basically, um we've had three of those 20% in the last 5 years. We've pulled forward 10 years of 20% drops, which is why I don't think we're going to see a bigger correction in the near term. There's a lot of recency bias. every everyone looking for what just happened is usually when it doesn't. We had it in 20 uh 2020, 2022, and 2025 in April. Uh and a 25% drop every 5 to 7 years. So that's the average since 1928.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwe've had three of those 20% in the last 5 years. We've pulled forward 10 years of 20% drops, which is why I don't think we're going to see a bigger correction in the near term. There's a lot of recency bias. every everyone looking for what just happened is usually when it doesn't. We had it in 20 uh 2020, 2022, and 2025 in April. Uh and a 25% drop every 5 to 7 years. So that's the average since 1928.\n\nHere is  oil prices adjusted for money supply. As you can see, we are the cheapest in the oil patch since it went negative in 2020. Prior to that was 2014, which was the one of the biggest oil depressions we've seen in our lifetime. And then prior to that was 992000, right before you had a six, seven-year commodity bull run. So, we've got our exposure there. Uh, as we've discussed with National Oil Well, Varco and Commtock is already taken off. Um, uh, National Oil Oil Varco is starting to take off. Here's the flow of funds. uh tend to start to see some strength in the month end, which we're seeing in tech. Uh 30-year mortgage rate. Let's see. Uh that is inverted to existing home sales. Okay, mortgage rates are coming down. Uh let's see. 4.03 on the 10-year if we get that Fed cut, which is 85% odds right now. Uh we could see that 6% just below 6% mortgage before year end. Let's see. Uh China 3% of MSCI all world index US 65%. That's kind of crazy when you consider the um uh GDP of each country being so close. This is going to play catch-up in a material way. Emerging markets at secular turning point versus the US. We haven't seen anything like this since this is one standard deviation below the mean. We haven't seen anything like this since 2000. Generational opportunity uh prior to that in the 80s when you had a huge uh bull run in emerging markets in the early 90s while the US was in a recession by the way and uh going all the way back to the late60s opportunity of a lifetime. So we started to see emerging markets outperformance 2 to1 this year. It is early days in that trend. We will benefit from Baba. By the way, um some of you have said like, \"Oh, there aren't a lot of people in Alibaba.\" What you're missing is that most institutional managers own Baba or at least some of their position. I think we own 90% of our position uh in the Hong Kong shares 9988. So you're not going to see it on their US filings because US filings is not representative of the portfolio. It's representative of those positions in the portfolio that are required to be reported on the list provided by the SEC. So your portfolio is scrubbed against a predefined list of securities from the SEC and what's remaining is what gets reported. And that's why you don't see it from a lot of managers that are now in it. Um, and you won't see the magnitude because it's it's held in Hong Kong. Uh, US Midcap's trading at PE of 15 times versus the S&P at 22 times. Again, you have to go all the way back to 20201 when everyone was chasing the concentrated stocks. They got their asses handed to them and for the next few years you dramatically outperform small caps, midcaps, international value. Same setup today. US stock market breath of the market is low right now. That's starting to turn around. Uh don't fight the Fed. global central bank policy uh 24-month cumulative 316 global central bank cuts uh as of November 2025 which tops August 2010 which was the last time there was this much liquidity in the system post great financial crisis. We didn't even come close during COVID and you know what happened with the market. So, a lot of gas and liquidity in the tank. S&P 500 debt at record lows, government debt near record highs. So, um balance sheets are super super healthy on the private sector side. Uh meaningfully unhealthy on the public sector side. Breath hasn't been this narrow since the tech bubble. again pointing to a normalization of weights and you're seeing signs of some of those stocks come in and come in materially. Uh tech makes up 50% of the S&P versus 40% in 2000. So, you know, again, if you chase what's crowded, you're going to get hurt. We've seen it in recent weeks with the Core Weeaves, with the Palunteers, and with the Nvidias. Uh you knew it was coming. Most people were blindsided and um what was the six and a half percent pullback in the S&P that we had been calling for which is called a secondary correction. On average in years you get 15% corrections or more and then reach all-time highs. The secondary correction averages 6.5%. That's exactly where we were intraday last Thursday. Is it over? I'm not sure. We still have a little bit of hedge on uh but as you know we were putting more money to work and um the names that we're putting money to work we don't really care what happens with the general indices because we're just grateful to buy them at the current prices. Um if the Fed cut happens as is 85% expected probably the most pain is in the rear view mirror. I think you'll probably get one more scare before the December 10th meeting. Maybe a retest, maybe a cut through just to really mess with people. Uh but if that cut goes through, should be okay from there. Uh stuff is old, we're due for a reinvestment cycle. That's capex that helps cyclicals. Weaker dollar equals EPS tailwind. We estimate for every 10% drop in the US dollar represents about a 3 percentage point boost to S&P earnings. We're seeing that in estimates for next year go up to 308 from 305. So that's positive. Uh on track for a record year in healthc care M&A. So that's gone straight through the roof and the stocks are now starting to follow despite having record low performance since 2000 to the S&P 500. uh near record low waiting in the S&P 500 and record low multiple uh PE multiple relative to the S&P 500. All formulas for massive generational inflections, which is why we added another position in healthcare, uh which we will disclose. Uh we're getting close to everyone being fully invested and we'll disclose it at some point in the future along with our restaurant uh well food consumer discretionary business. We'll leave it at that. um clients know what it is from the ones who can look in their portfolio uh and see and the most people we've been been able to find some room for it. If you haven't, we've told you what it was and uh and you can get some on your own if you if you were in a cash account and didn't have any room. uh but you've received a Christmas gift gift card so that you could do your own due diligence on our newest position. So, uh pretty excited on that front. Dividends should contribute more than over last year's ZERP environment. Dividend payers, there are three areas I wanted to cover this morning for Vney, but we didn't have time. The key was be selective. Healthc care uh we we just covered consumer discretionary. We had the biggest cut on record, two standard deviations below the mean. Uh and that's creating massive opportunities. The common denominator between our two new holdings is they are massive uh if not the highest dividend payers in their respective sectors. uh and dividend payers will be massive beneficiaries of the ongoing easing cycle. Remember number one 316 cuts globally. Number two, quantitative tightening uh discontinues on December 1st, meaning uh quantitative easing is probably on the table in coming months. And three, we are at the early stages of our easing cycle getting back to the neutral rate of 3% or lower. Next, oh, so here's what you see. From 1936 to 2013, the dividend provided 39% of the total return of the S&P 500. During the zero interest rate policy, when uh tech and Momo stocks outperformed 2014 to 2024, dividends only provided 16% of the total return. Get ready for a reversion back to dividend payers dramatic outperformance. And if you look across our positions, we got a quite a quite a few of them that are going to benefit from this situation. Uh low expectations, consensus, long-term growth forecast near a record low. That was evidenced in the question that Stuart posed to me. Could stocks stay down for 10 years? And uh I that was off-the cuff question that he asked and I gave an off-the cuff answer. The thing that I would add is that what he was calling for, namely or asking if we could have uh 10 years where stocks don't go nowhere like the 70s. We just had it from 2000 to 2012. Uh there were basically no net returns in the stock market to get back up to the watermark and then it broke out and continued. So, uh, I think that's more of a mid 2030s to mid 2040s story. Uh, and I think we've got at least, you know, six, seven, eight years of super gas left in the tank right now. Uh, long only exposure to consumer dress discretionary is low versus history. This is a generational opportunity, which is why we added some exposure with the new position there. And uh in years where small cap profits growth is outpacing large cap profits growth and accelerating, small caps have outperformed 75% of the time and by an average of 9 percentage points. That's the story for next year. Non-farm payrolls. The upturn in payrolls in September was mostly due to imprecise seasonal adjustments. Non-farm seasonal was the most generous for September on record due to very very different previous years. Okay. Wall of worry. Which worry do equities overcome first? AI capex mania and the credit undercurrent. Valuations remain stretched. Fed still leaning hawkish. Repo market stress. Liquidity tightens. US election watch sentiment risk ahead. Crypto deleveraging positioning for rebound. Private credit and early signs of strain. Breath breakdown concentration at extremes. K-shaped economy and divergent consumers. data blackout and policy blind spot. So, you can go through those one by one. Just pause your video player. Number of stocks lagging 10% behind the S&P 500 year to date. We are at near a record not seen since 1999. So, something to keep in mind if you were overweight. The most highly concentrated stocks, [Music] percent of stocks raising earnings guidance. This is up to 37 or 38%. So that's a positive thing. We're seeing it in the overall number. Analysts expect S&P 500 margins to expand to 15.5% by the end of 2027, which would be an all-time high. Rare to see multiples compress when margins expand. We agree. November and December performance by day. So, we're seeing some end of November strength and then maybe some chop in the middle of December and finish up strong. Small caps tend to outperform in December, by the way. Um, here we got put volume at levels near historic uh points where where you see rebounds. Uh, whether Thursday was it or not, it did meet the number that we had been calling for when everyone was super bulled up in in October and we kept saying going to get a 6 and a half% correction. uh we got it or pullback. Uh is that all? I think that's going to be dependent on the Fed. But if we get more, it will be concentrated in those names that have already been hit the hardest. Um namely um the highf flyers. Uh so it won't affect you uh nearly as much. And if it doesn't happen, you're already positioned and taking advantage of the any year-end strength. How large could cloud international revenue be? Alibaba cloud is undergoing rapid international expansion in Asia, Europe, Latin America, tapping AI compute, sovereign AI demand with increasing capex build up into higher data center density internationally. 900 of Ali cloud's nodes are located overseas versus 2,300 nodes located in China and sticky multi-year revenue growth outlook. We estimate international to contribute 1/4 of Alibaba cloud's external revenue by fiscal year 28 estimate from mids single digit in fiscal year 2025 growing at high double digits from 25 to 28 kagger uh on the back of one full stack AI plus cloud hyperscaler offerings two accelerating data center buildout globally three its international pricing premium measured by Quen token relative to domestic and four targeted sector clients, five global enterprise client win. So this is pretty exciting bullcase here. 76% upside on our revised bullcase implied valuation of $280 US per share of uh Baba and 271 in Hong Kong 9988. Scarcity value of China's AI full stack exposure, exponential growth in inference, and everything we've been talking about. So, I love this note. Uh, we don't have a source here. Uh, Goldman Sachs. Okay, great. There's your source. Goldman Sachs with a $280 price target on Baba. Opinion follows trend. These were part of the uninvestable camp just a short year and a half ago. Now, they're climbing on board. Uh, it will overshoot that target. Uh, and when everyone is all in at 300 plus, we will be helping them out with our shares. But for the time being, enjoy the ride and get some popcorn. Mostly fair winds. Global cruise industry has been steadily growing except for pandemic years. That's going to help Disney. Russell 2000 relative to Russell 1000 seasonal pattern since 1979. Ah, here it is the data. Okay. Small cap outperformance from mid December through March. This is from Yale Hirs over at Stock Traders Almanac. The best part of the year for small caps tends to be mid December through March. Uh so that's that extreme fear here. So that's what what you're seeing with the bounce. Uh let's see revenue growth. Public companies history favors above average returns even over one-year periods, especially when you don't have a recession. That's from Carson. There are 37% more home sellers than buyers. You lower rates a little bit. They're going to clamor in. New home price now lower than existing home price. Haven't seen that since 1982. The last time you had an aggressive hike and then a easing cycle uh and then it took off after that. So I think we're setting the stage for another bull market there. Uh discretionary investors are implicitly pricing that earnings growth is about to drop sharply and turn negative. Um except that's not happening and they're going to be pleasantly surprised. Maybe it'll be because of the $2,000 checks from Trump if the Supreme Court does something silly with tariffs. But uh more likely than not, the consumer is stronger than anticipated. Uh Magnificent 7 free cash flow growth has turned negative. Uh that's uh what we've been calling for. China bulls 30% in two years. Uh we forecast Chinese equities to rise 30% over the next two years is from Goldman Sachs driven by low teen trend profit growth and moderate PE expansion. Uh we agree Alibaba will be the big beneficiary of that. Meat prices coming down on the bacon side with lean hogs also coming down on feeder and on um live cattle contracts. Michigan consumer sentiment index lowest since uh the COVID lows prior to that the 1980 vulkar tightening cycle very similar history rhymes doesn't repeat to the Powell tightening and easing cycle uh is this still a contrarian signal University of Michigan consumer sentiment index S&P average forward 12-month returns when you have the lowest 5% of consumer readings 12-month returns are up 18.7%. We are in the lowest 5% right now. Prime Book percent of total US net exposure. Healthcare biotech just getting started. Health healthcare XBiotech just getting started. Biotech has been off the charts. Our XBI is crushing it. Uh super grateful. That one took a long time, couple of years, but now we're getting paid like it's going out of style. So, we're excited to see that. Uh, valuation rally contracts in periods above the median EPS growth and accommodative monetary policy. So forward 12 uh PE 12-month rate of change in greater than median EPS growth plus accommodative Fed policy uh 91% chance of retaining the high multiples is what they're basically implying consumer price index is right at the mean which has been 3% since 1915. more cuts coming. They're expecting a move to 3% on the Fed funds rate by July 2026. That would be amazing. Earnings are expected to remain strong. Yeah, as I said, $38. That's up from 305. Earnings growth year-on-year mag 7 versus other $493. That's current forward is going to they're going to be parry pursue and the multiple spread is huge. We like to play those type of divergences. Uh pockets of momentum chasing have reversely uh pockets of momentum chasing have reversed sharply. Performance of a basket of stocks with the most net call volume in the previous week. So remember all those calls I said record for 23. None of those got paid. They all got smoked the last minute in November. Uh there's still a decent amount of volume in December, but nothing like November, which is why I think we might get one more scare. Uh but we shall see. Policy stimulus index is as low as it was since 2000 2001 and then it turned up. So we'll see what happens there. valuations become less stretched as you move down the S&P 500. So, uh, based on waiting, the S&P is at 22 times. Basically, the top 10 weights are at 27 and a half times, but the bottom 10 weights are at 14.8 times. That's where you're finding some bargains. Uh, speculative short ETF volume. Uh, you know, it's at the level where you could be bottoming here. It could also get a little higher and, you know, have one more leg down. Um, I I think you're guessing. I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if we have one more leg down. Uh I I'm agnostic to either way. I'm positioned fine irrespective of of the outcome. Um but there's an awful lot of confidence in that cut and I think maybe you get a little shakiness ahead of the meeting. percent of large cap mutual funds expect 245 billion in M&A supply in 2026. So that's talking to animal spirits. We had 73% corrections so far in 2025. This is from Fundstrat with the one 21.4% intrayear correction, the third in 5 years when that should be only happening once every three and a half years. So I think we pulled forward a lot of the pain. Um short ETF volume really extreme which points to potentially uh Thursday having been the bottom. We we will see median S&P 500 carries above average short interest. So there's still a lot of pessimism there. average equity fund flow by calendar month over the past decade excluding US election years. Uh December is the largest. So just keep that in mind.\n\n\n\nfree cash flow growth has turned negative. China bulls 30% in two years. Uh we forecast Chinese equities to rise 30% over the next two years is from Goldman Sachs driven by low teen trend profit growth and moderate PE expansion. Uh we agree Alibaba will be the big beneficiary of that. Meat prices coming down on the bacon side with lean hogs also coming down on feeder and on um live cattle contracts. Michigan consumer sentiment index lowest since uh the COVID lows prior to that the 1980 vulkar tightening cycle very similar history rhymes doesn't repeat to the Powell tightening and easing cycle uh is this still a contrarian signal University of Michigan consumer sentiment index S&P average forward 12-month returns when you have the lowest 5% of consumer readings 12-month returns are up 18.7%. We are in the lowest 5% right now. Prime Book percent of total US net exposure. Healthcare biotech just getting started. Health healthcare XBiotech just getting started. Biotech has been off the charts. Our XBI is crushing it. Policy stimulus index is as low as it was since 2000 2001 and then it turned up.

Um but there's an awful lot of confidence in that cut and I think maybe you get a little shakiness ahead of the meeting. percent of large cap mutual funds expect 245 billion in M&A supply in 2026. So that's talking to animal spirits. We had 73% corrections so far in 2025. This is from Fundstrat with the one 21.4% intrayear correction, the third in 5 years when that should be only happening once every three and a half years. So I think we pulled forward a lot of the pain. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nUm short ETF volume really extreme which points to potentially uh Thursday having been the bottom. We we will see median S&P 500 carries above average short interest. So there's still a lot of pessimism there. average equity fund flow by calendar month over the past decade excluding US election years. Uh December is the largest. So just keep that in mind. And finally , what else do we have? Top 1,00 universe by market cap percentage of stocks with greater greater than 10% draw down over the past six months. 66% of the top 10,000 stocks are down more than 10%. Uh which no Morgan Stanley is pointing out is a lot of damage. The damage under the surface is notable. Healthcare had the most earnings beach since 2021. That is a key another key reason that we uh added another major position in healthcare uh in the last week and a half plus. And let's see here. Uh, driven tightness, ESS driven tightness and China mine suspensions have reduced inventory days and pushed lithium prices higher. As I told you, we took all the profits on our Albamaro spreads at three and between three and 4x across the board and um kept 100% of the stock. So, we often do that when one of our names has a parabolic move and um you know, we know the stock is going to pull back and consolidate for six months before it takes the next leg leg higher or at least we we know that's a risk. So, we'll take the multibag on the spreads andor the straight options. Uh lock that down and then just ride out the consolidation with the stock until we get to uh predetermined intrinsic value. uh you know down down the road. We did that with Boeing, we did that with uh Generrack, we did that with um a lot of the stocks where the you know uh BABA uh between six and 7X on those option spreads. That was a huge huge hit for us this year. Uh but we we still keep 100% of the stock because they're not anywhere near uh full intrinsic value. Okay, this next one, energy storage to account for 44% of global lithium demand growth in 2025 estimated nearly 30% of total lithium demand. So you can see here electric vehicles largely driven by China uh and energy storage systems picking up huge amounts of demand over the over the coming years. uh OpenAI estimated balance sheet total cost of cloud compute negative200 billion revenue positive 200 billion uh so you can get a sense of what's happening there downloads attributed to developer okay the dominance of Google Meta and open AI has declined in favor of smaller and unaffiliated developers and recently Chinese models Deep Seek and Quen.

Okay. So, uh getting their groove back,\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nstock market and sentiment results . Disney update. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we've discussed in previous podcast vida video casts and or own for clients including personally. Uh Disney posted another solid quarter earlier this month and closed out what was by all measures a very strong fiscal year 2025. Revenue rose 3% to 94.4 4 billion for the full year.

Even more importantly, guidance points to continued strength in the year ahead. Exactly the signs we want to see in any turnaround. Rather than focusing on the fundamentals that actually move the needle, the market chose to fixate on a few short-term one-offheadlines  from cruise pre-opening expenses to theatrical timing that created tough comps. Of course, that kind of quarterly choppiness has zero bearing on our long-term thesis or the strength of the turnaround, which is why we view the market's reaction as complete silly season. That brings us back to why we own the name in the first place. When we originally built our position, we essentially underwrote Disney at a level where we were praying for, excuse me, where we were paying for the experiences segment alone. Parks, cruises, and consumer products together generated close to $10 billion of operating income. and we believed were worth close to $80 per share on a standalone basis. That meant the rest of the business, whether ESPN, DTC, the studio assets, or the linear networks, was essentially being thrown in as a free flyer. So, you can see here experiences uh 11% Kagger sports operating income and the entertainment operating income is really starting to take off. At the time, Mr. market had assigned these segments close to zero value simply because Disney hit a few bumps and took its eye off the ball. But with a 1000year plus operating history and a long record of navigating cycles, we were more than willing to take the other side. With a margin of safety that large with a margin of safety that large and a business this durable, it didn't take rocket science to see the value. We expected that once I returned, he would write the ship and get these segments back on track so Disney could get back to doing what it does best. In the meantime, the experiences segment would buy the company time to work through the hiccups, build out its next growth engine, DTC, and squeeze the remaining juice out of the linear networks. Fast forward today, and our original thesis remains firmly intact. The only difference is that those same businesses once written off as having zero value have come roaring back and are stronger than ever. DTC just posted 1.3 billion of operating income and is on track for 10% operating margins in fiscal year 2026 after posting a $4 billion loss only three years ago. The film slate is the strongest it has been in years with the studio delivering four one plus billion dollar releases over the past two years while no other studio delivered a single one. Again, none of this required a stroke of genius. It simply required knowing what we owned, understanding the cycles, and recognizing that sentiment swings to extremes and eventually reverts to the mean. So, it should be no surprise that our confidence continues to grow with or without Mr. Market's manic reaction in the short term. We continue to see Disney as one of the most durable businesses with some of the strongest IP on the planet. As a double-digit earnings compounder that lets us sleep like a baby at night, Disney remains a no-brainer. And sooner or later the market will come around to that reality. So here are the key points from the earnings breakdown and the you can go through at hedge funips.com. And by the way, while you're at hedge funip.com, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Here are the 10 key points. Number one, DTC posted another strong quarter with revenue up 8% to $6.25 25 billion and operating income up 39% to 352 million point uh 5.6% EBIT margins that brings fullear operating income to 1.3 billion compared with 143 million last year and initial guidance of 1 billion. Management expects DTC to reach 10% operating margins for the full year and sees sustained double-digit topline growth ahead as the segment takes the baton as Disney's next growth engine with significant room for further margin expansion still to come. Number two, the experiences segment. Disney's breadandbut business posted 6% growth in Q4 to 8.77 billion and delivered record Q4 operating income of 1.9 billion, up 13% year-onear. For the full year, the segment generated 3.16 billion in revenue, up 6%, and a record 10 billion in operating income, up 8%, accounting for just under 60% of the company's total operating income. Management expects another strong year ahead for experiences, guiding to a high singledigit operating income growth with domestic bookings already up 3% in the first quarter and up for the full year, showing no signs of a weakening consumer. Three, the sports segment posted 17.67 billion in revenue for the full year flat yearon-year, while operating income grew 20% to 2.88 billion, coming in 7 percentage points ahead of prior guidance. The new ESPN full DTC service and enhanced ESPN app are off to a strong start with 80% of ESPN subscribers opting for the trio bundle that includes Disney Plus and Hulu. A very positive sign for meaningfully reduced churn. Four, Disney's big bet on cruises continues to pay off with demand remaining very high uh and new capacity filling as quickly as they can bring it online. Utilization has held in line with historical levels despite a 60% increase in capacity. Disney has two new ships launching in coming months, bringing the fleet to eight ships with five additional ships scheduled beyond 2026 that are expected to be meaningful contributors to Experienc's growth in the years ahead. By the way, this is their highest return on invested capital business. While management doesn't break out crises separately, cruises separately, they continue to highlight the segments highly attractive margins and the highest guest satisfaction ratings across the company, which provides significant pricing power. Management sees the upcoming slate as the strongest in years, led by Zootopia 2 and Avatar Fire and Ash in 2025, and followed by The Mandalorian and Grou Toy Story 5 and the liveaction Moana and Avengers Doomsday in 2026. Disney has already cleared four billion at the global box office for the fourth consecutive year and has produced four 1 billion plus films over the past two years, while no other studio has delivered a single one. Disney generated 18.1 billion in operating cash flow for the full year with free cash flow reaching 10.77 billion up 18% yearonear and a record high for fiscal year 2026. Management expects operating cash flow of 19 billion which includes 1.7 billion tax impact that had been previously deferred. Backing that out, operating cash flow would grow 28% yearonear. Management remains confident in strong free cash flow going forward as investment levels begin to taper. Seven, subscriber growth came in better than expected with total Disney Plus and Hulu subscriptions reaching 196 million, an increase of 12.4 million sequentially, driven mainly by higher wholesale Hulu subscriptions. Disney Plus added 3.8 million subscribers organically, up 3% sequentially with average revenue per user up 2% to $84. Eight management is doubling planned share repurchases for fiscal year 2026. Doubling planned share repurchases, bringing total buybacks to $7 billion and is also increasing the cash dividend to $1.50 per share, up 50% year-on-year with a 1.5% yield. Nine, Disney continues to invest heavily in the experiences segment with expansion projects underway at every theme park. Five additional cruise ships scheduled for launch beyond fiscal year 2026. And a new theme park plan for Abu Dhabi. Fullear capex for 2025 came in at 8 billion, up from 5.4 billion in the prior year and is expected to rise to 9 billion in fiscal year 2026. Most importantly, the returns on invested capital for the segment remain highly attractive and reached record highs earlier this year. 10. management's Q1 guidance came in weaker than expected due to a handful of one-time expenses, including 90 million in pre-opening costs for cruises, 60 million in dry dock expenses, theatrical slate timing, and lower political advertising revenue for the full year. Management still expected to deliver doubledigit adjusted EPS and reiterated confidence in double-digit EPS growth for fiscal year 2027. Here are the earnings call highlights. We uh started the most important things from the earnings call transcript and on to Alibaba. Okay, what a long way we have come ladies and gentlemen. So Alibaba just reported his quarter. We've highlighted some of the key points and here are the 10 key points. Number one, the cloud segment posted its fastest growth in more than three years. accelerating to 34% year-onear to $5.6 billion compared with 26% in the prior quarter. Adjusted Ibida rose 35% to $56 million with margins holding steady at 9% on improved operating efficiency. Alibaba cloud remains the market leader, holding 35.8% 8% share of China's AI cloud market, larger than the combined total of the second through fourth largest providers and continues to take share in both the hybrid cloud and financial cloud markets with more developers and enterprises increasingly seeking full stack AI providers. A key advantage for Alibaba, demand is out now outpacing the pace at which the company can add new servers. Unbelievable. two AI related product revenue posted tripledigit growth for the ninth straight quarter and now accounts for more than 20% of the cloud segment's external revenue. Alibaba's flagship AI model Quen 3 ranks among global leaders across multiple benchmarks with the newly launched Quen app already surpassing 10 million downloads in the first week. As of the end of October, more than 180,000 derivative models had been built on the Quen family on hugging face, more than two times the second largest player. Three, over the past four quarters, management has developed a 16.9 billion in capex toward AI and cloud infrastructure as part of Alibaba's three-year 53 billion capex plan. Given current demand for commute, compute and AI management won't rule out further scaling capex, suggesting the $53 billion target may end up being on the small side. Four, the China e-commerce group which includes Tao, T- Mall, Lime, Fliggy posted 16% revenue growth to $18.6 6 billion with customer management revenue up 10% driven by higher take rate added software service fee 60 basis point introduced last September and increasing penetration in Quan zun Thai Alibaba's marketing and ads platform segment adjusted IBI e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i e i decreased 76% to 1.5 billion primarily due to increased quick commerce Mer investments excluding the losses from quick commerce. China e-commerce adjusted Ibida would have grown at a mid singledigit rate for the quarter. 88 VIP members, Alibaba's highest spending customers and its closest equivalent to Amazon Prime grew by double digits during the quarter and now exceed 56 million subscriptions. Five. Alibaba's Quickcommerce segment posted 60% revenue growth to 3.2 2 billion supported by the accelerating onboarding of T- mall brands which now total 3500. Most importantly, unit economic losses have been reduced by 50% compared with levels seen in July and August driven by higher average order size up double digits and improved scale efficiencies while narrowing UE uh losses. management noted that both user retention and purchase frequency have exceeded expectations with order share holding stable and gross merchandise volume share steady to trending higher. Management believes this quarter marks the peak of investment intensity for the P platform and expects significant scaling down of investment next quarter. Instant commerce is still expected to deliver 140 billion in incremental annual gross merchandise volume within 3 years. Six profitability in the current period remained under pressure due to ongoing investments mainly in quick commerce with adjusted IBIDA down 78% year-on-year to 1.27 billion and expected to fluctuate in the near-term sales and marketing expenses year-to- date risen to 24% of revenue compared with 13.4% at this point last year driven by intense competition in the segment seven. Alibaba's strong balance sheet gives us plenty of confidence in the ramped up investment cycle into quick commerce and AI plus cloud with cash and other liquid investments totaling 80.6 6 billion, 21.5% of the market cap and a net cash position of 41.1 billion. 8 management repurchased 2 million shares during the quarter for a total of 253 million, bringing year-to- date repurchases to $1.1 billion with 19.1 billion remaining in the authorization effective through March 2027. This is exactly what we want to see from management. Last year when the stock was at $80 and below, they were consistently repurchasing 4 to5 billion per quarter. Now the stock is significantly higher and capital has better uses. They have rightly pulled back on buybacks. The total sharebased compensation also decreased 20% year-on-year to $467 during the quarter. Another positive sign. Nine free cash flow for the quarter was an outflow of 3.1 billion, bringing year-to- date free cash flow to an outflow of 5.7 billion. in line with expectations as Alibaba invests into the quickcommerce business and AI plus cloud infrastructure. And 10, Alibaba AIDC, the international business, delivered 10% year-on-year revenue growth to 4.89 billion and for the first time posted adjusted EBIDA profit of 23 million driven by substantially improved unit economics in the AliExpress choice business and stronger operating efficiency. So, we started the key points in the earnings call. You can review that at hedge funips.com. Fear and greed index down to 14 extreme fear. That's why you're seeing more buying follow through.

We took the opposite side. Now it's going to break through four on the downside. 30-year yield went up here. We had a counter trend bounce that we talked about. Now it's rolling back over. And the dollar looks like it's going to break this counter trend move yet again and start to weaken once more. Here's the resistance line on the weekly chart and here it is on the daily chart. So, expect the dollar to reverse lower in coming months, euro to reverse higher in coming months. Uh, all my friends with the Canadian looney, here's your support. You're going back up, not down. \n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n\nSome other charts here. You can see all the pain in the tech stocks. Oracle, Nvidia, Google's been the outlier. Netflix breaking the trend line. Meta getting smacked after earnings. Disney showing support here. Um, and I think that was all that we needed to cover from this book. And then there was another essay louder here. Huge move off the bottom. Almost doubled. Now it's been consolidating, ready to move next next target 125. And I think we've got them all. Okay, so that's that. Couple other charts. This is the daily as of today. It's right at the 6774 level. If it could push through that and and move to new highs, we're we're off to races. It looks that way. Um, but if we got some rug pull from the Fed uh and break through this, you know, that's where the 6147 comes into play. I'd assign that like a 30% uh probably like a 20% probability, 80% probability we stay above this recent low and uh push to new highs in 2026. But this is not completely off the table yet. covered the yields. Semiconductor index trying to make a move off that low. That was a pretty big move down. Uh we'll see if it holds.

Nike's earnings are going up by the way. G Chipotle down pretty meaningful down and alt is up. Okay. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\n economic data there's not much PPI came in lower than expected. That's good for the Fed. uh earnings as I said up to 308. So now let's get on to the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions . We've got a lot and then we'll get you to your turkeys and your football games. Jake at Primac uh is asking about FMC, the gift that keeps giving. A lot of people want to bottom uh catch a falling knife on this one. Look, I mean this stock is pricing in bankruptcy. I think that bankruptcy is uh not the greater probability. It is a probability but not the greater probability. So you flip a coin three times, you're going to wind up okay. You flip it once. Let's see here. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. So, you got 2.8 billion in cash and receivables, 3.2 billion in debt, and uh that's that cash flow turned negative. Let's see what it is for the last 12 months. Yeah, negative half a bill. So that's that's what's got everyone worried. Uh that and the fact that revenues won't turn around yet on a sequential basis. They're showing some lines, some signs of hope. Share count stayed pretty steady. Historically, it had been a high return on capital business. So, you know, you're effectively playing. I mean, this is this is the type of stock you throw in your personal portfolio. You size it. If you're right, you treat it, you want to treat this one like, you know, a $13 call option with without an expiration date. Because if you're right and this thing works back to normalized volumes, you get an 8 to 10 bagger. If you're wrong, you're at zero. Um, we can't do that with uh meaningful amounts of money. Uh certainly not for clients. Take that kind of risk. But I do think there's probably some opportunity here uh if you're willing to size it appropriately relative to the risk. But this is the whole a basket. The business has been around since 1883. I think you're probably uh gonna wind up making really good money over the next few years, but it's not a risk I can take across the board, but it is a risk that I would uh explore on a sized correctly basis in a speculative bucket of a personal portfolio. So, hope that's helpful. York uh bourgeoa He wants to play Sprouts, UNFI, and GO as a play on GLP1s. I don't like any supermarket business, so pass. We'll save you some Thanksgiving time on that one. Uh, Revenant Arian, what is your 10-year outlook on Baba? I don't have one. We'll be out probably in three to four years from now. uh at uh 4x off our initial basis. We already made six to 7x on the options and call it a day. So um that's that. Stain at longtime follower and listener happily sharing your podcast among friends and financial colleagues. Thank you very much. uh besides already having a nice position comtock and national oilco I was looking at APA Apache it's the same trade so I'm not sure why you would even want it either you know lean into what you've done the work on um this will work it'll absolutely work fine we've covered that one a million times on the podcast thank you for the question and thank you for sharing Sprouts Farmers Market why is everyone bringing this thing up is this getting promoted on social or something oh absolutely Not that. This one's done. Supermarkets are Okay, let me just put it in English. Supermarkets are Don't ever buy them. If you get caught in one of these moves, get the hell out because there's nothing to bases. There's a low margin, terrible business. And uh it's kind of like the airlines. You can catch cycles here and there, but uh on balance, good luck. ZTS. This is a broken momentum stock. I don't like this. Um, for years and years and years, everything about this looks great. Okay. And for years and years and years, I've been hearing about animal health, animal insurance, animal this, animal that, veterinary rollups, all this It never works because the second you get a recession, the dog starves. So, uh, I'm going to just pass. Maybe you can get another puff out of this cigar, but, uh, it's not for me. Tim D, Target thoughts. I think I think you can probably buy it here. Um, yeah. I mean, if it goes to 70 or 60 before it goes back to 140, so what? I I think you can probably buy it here. We've covered that a million times. I don't have to look at it. Will G, uh, been a listener for a few years now. Thank you very much. Share it with friends and family every chance I get. Appreciate that. Uh uh used to listen to the pod each week when I walked or worked out. Per your advice, I've begun watching it instead and have gained so much more value for that. I thank you. You're welcome. Uh curious on your thoughts on AMRZ Amrize spin-off from Wholesome's North American business this past June. Largest cement producer in the US. One of the largest roofing suppliers as well. AMRZ I think you're a little late on this move. See, looks like the revenue's been flat for a while. Uh, I think it's a little early to tell on this. I'd rather play Brad Jacobs QXO. It's got a lot of free cash flow though. It's trading at 27 times earnings 20 times. Okay. I think it's okay. I think they're better plays in the building supply um sector, but um probably worth doing some more work on. Thanks for sending that in. Tim Kwin, hey Tom, what's your view on Jack? CEO recently bought some shares. Yeah, I think this one's going to be okay. Uh, we've been looking in the restaurant area. We did come across this one. We didn't act on this one, but I think you're probably okay with that. Let me just take a look at the balance sheet. I mean, this one's obviously not without risk, but I think you'll have massive upside. I'd probably put this in the your FMC speculative PA bucket and treat it like a $18 option versus a stock. It could go to zero, but if you're right, you make five bags on it. Um 140 in cash and receivables. 1.6 billion in debt. The the key is the leverage. They just haven't been able to get out of their way with sales either. I don't I don't love it, but I think you can make a good amount of money with it. So, um, let me see here. Let me see how many shares he bought. Might just be token or is it real? He bought $86,000 worth of stock. That's kind of a joke. I mean, it's better than zero, but you know. Okay, Bill Mcgru, longtime listener. Love the pod. Tell all my friends what do you think about Wirehouser. Thank you for telling all your friends. That has been that's what's kept this thing growing is your word of mouth. There's no sign of a turnaround yet. I'd be more interested at 1750 than I am at 22. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. I mean, all you're betting is can they make it through the cycle. So, they're burning cash, but they can make it through this cycle, I think. Yeah, they're they're they'll I think they'll manage. Um I think you're okay. I'd like it in the high teens if I could wait, but he may not get it. Eric F. Oh, everyone keeps asking about Fever Tree. I think you're late on that, partner.

Uh, Nova Nordisk, thanks for great content. Buying back stock AI tech enhanced drug development. Yeah, I mean look, uh, t### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhere is  I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about this right yet, but there's an oral drug GLP-1 in phase two uh, that they don't have. Uh, I think the $30 $40 range, if you can get it, you get it. You may not be able to get it. If you buy it here and it goes to $30, buy more. Uh, I'm not in a rush to get this one. This one's a broken Momo stock, so it's going to take some time to rebuild a base and to rebuild the confidence. That doesn't mean the fundamentals aren't sound. I think it's generally fine, if not good. But, uh, they're kind of monopoly on the weight losses in the rearview mirror despite having a lot of other good drugs. So, would I buy it here? Yeah. Would I like it better at 40 or 30? A lot more. Um, I'm in no rush to take any action on this one, but we've covered that one pretty much every week. And I continue to say the same exact thing. Jackson Matthews, Novo. Same story. You can buy it here. Just be ready to buy it lower. Theo DJardan Aker Solutions. You got to send me a ticker, partner. If it's not a US stock, I'm going to assume this is what you're talking about. No, not for me. Next. Jim D. Uh, Jim, I can't answer that question. Hope that's helpful. You can reverse engineer that response. FND. Not yet. soon. I like it in the high 40s. I don't know if you get that, but this is not going to rebound like overnight. Oscar Slater, long time listener, first- time caller. Thank you. Uh oh. Uh, Pinterest B I N S I don't even know why this thing exists, but let's see what the financials tell me. P I N S H record free cash flow. Ah They have increased the share count a little bit more than I like. I don't like that tendency, but we're starting to generate a lot of cash. broken growth story. I think between 20 and 25, you could probably start to build a long-term position, but you got to do a lot more work. I I don't really understand the business, so it wouldn't be something for me, but on the financial basis, you know, it's like Zoom and some of these other left for dead things. You probably get a puff out of it, and there's no reason not to like it other than it's a hard business to understand and predict. uh watching some of your old episodes from 2022, came across your episode where you were looking at Carvana when it was sub $10. You ended up saying, \"I'm more bullish on new car sales versus new car sales right now, but at the share price this low, I have to start considering a company like Carvana.\" Uh, did you ever wind up a billing position? No, I did not. Um, that was a speculative gamble. That would be something you put in a personal account. You can't put other people's money in that. Milan Kersner been following your podcast. That's a complicated story because one fund controlled most of the stock along with the owners. So, if one of those two blew up or had uh margin calls, the the whole story, it would have been over overnight. And that's why I couldn't put meaningful money in it. Oh, it worked. They were able to manage their way through, but those guys can get taken. You know, rule number one is don't ever get taken out on a stretcher. Both the fund and the principles were very close to be taken out on a stretcher. So, yes, it was attractive, but it could have also been a zero. And um uh rule number one is don't lose money. Rule number two, don't lose don't don't forget rule number one. And if I had to do it all over again, I'd make the exact same decision. Uh, and here I am five years later or three years later, not on a stretcher. Uh, not with all the roadkill that happened, all the tech businesses, all the VC businesses that went to zero, uh, that no one writes about, no one talks about because those people are all now Walmart greeters. So, um, that's that. Milan Kersner, been following your podcast for over four years now from Canada. Look forward to hearing your market take on every Thursday. Thank you very much for that loyal support. I'm very grateful for that. Uh family topic every week was wondering if you could take a look at Trans Ocean rig and share your thoughts on it. Yeah, rig is lower quality. I'd rather do national oil well Varco but um I think rig will work. Uh, the problem I had with Rig, I think they were pigs on stock and deluded their owners at certain points in their history, which I really don't like. They might have had to do it to survive, but I don't like that they even put themselves in a position to have to do it. So, I'm very unforgiving when it comes to uh lack of respect to to the equity. And uh yeah, they're still doing it. The share count's up 50%. So, a hard pass cuz the underlying business could double and if they double the share count, it doesn't help you. Uh, yeah, and they're they're giving a lot of it to themselves. So, they're they're animals here. Uh, hard pass. Doesn't mean the stock won't go up when the when the whole group turns. Um, and Kristoff is asking about PayPal and he's worried about stockbased comp and CA cash flow and he's wrong. And I'm going to show you why. So, just so you know, we gleefully have been buying a lot more in the market. Um, revenues continue to grow. Share count has collapsed from 1.2 billion down to 986 million. They're buying stock when the price is low. That's what we like to see from management. And what's happened to stockbased compensation? It has also declined from 1.4 billion 5 years ago down to 1.1. I'm not saying that's the greatest thing ever. I'm just saying that it's on the right trend. Share count's going down and stockbased comp is going down at the exact same time. and free cash flow has been robust five to six to7 billion per year. So um so that's that you're overthinking it because the price is down and you think that you know something that you don't. The po the point is this next move will take all these weak sisters out and then the next move will be straight to 100 and then beyond. I told you guys the max pain would be to take it down to 49, take it below this low and get absolutely everyone out. I don't know whether it'll go that low before it rebounds. I think we're probably closer to the end of the pain than the beginning, but uh this would be max pain. We would back up the truck and uh see you at 150. But uh for now I'll leave it to these guys. Next is from Joel Sarah Bransky. Yeah, he's talking about margin decline in the hyperscalers. We agree. Paul Wy, hey buddy. one of the best putters in Southern California. Thanks for taking the time and effort putting into the program each week. Your perspective and recommendations help us better prepared informed investors. Lionel Basil LYB. Okay. He's asking about the dividend. I wouldn't be buying it for the dividend. I would just assume they're going to cut the dividend and then if you still want to buy the stock, you're probably right. Let's take a look here. All right. So, the problem we have\n\nTrans Ocean rig and share your thoughts on it. Yeah, rig is lower quality. I'd rather do national oil well Varco but um I think rig will work. Uh, the problem I had with Rig, I think they were pigs on stock and deluded their owners at certain points in their history, which I really don't like.

He's asking about the dividend. I wouldn't be buying it for the dividend. I would just assume they're going to cut the dividend and then if you still want to buy the stock, you're probably right. Let's take a look here. All right. So, the problem we have here is  that we're not yet showing signs of recovery really in free cash flow or in revenues. But if we can get comfort around the balance sheet, I think this is one you could probably take a flyer on. Talk about I mean the revenues have been almost cut in half. Talk about a cyclical business. So you got 10 billion of debt. You got two billion of cash, three billion of receivables. What you really need to know is when does each tranch mature? Uh but in the meantime, you still have 730 million of free cash flow. and management that has been buying in stock and giving themselves a lot of stock at the same time. So, uh I think you're okay with this one. Uh as far as the dividend, let's see what the dividend is. It's just leverage. I mean, that the market's afraid of their ability to refinance. Um, dividend yield is 11%. I wouldn't be surprised if that got cut in half, but that would actually be positive for the stock. So, I would say I kind of like it here. I like it. I I kind of like it here. you know, 40 to 47 48. Uh, I think you're probably okay and I kind of like the pick. So, uh, there you go, Paul. Good one. Uh, next is Thomas Bar says, \"Hey Tom, thanks for all you do. Of all the financial experts in the media, your methodology makes the most sense by far. Buffett would be proud.\" Thank you for that. That's a kind compliment. When when you own companies with significant margin of safety as you do, do you expect them to still significantly outperform even if the MAG 7 see a magnific massive selloff in 1999 to 2000? So many small cap and midcap consumer discretionary companies saw their stock price bottom and then rally all through 2000 to 2001 despite the broader index collapsing. Uh yes, they will outperform on a relative basis. If everything goes down, they'll go down less. But as you saw with Buffett buying the things that no one wanted, kind of like what we've been doing this year, uh, when the others got hit, his actually went up as the indices were collapsing. We think that'll be a similar situation. Aluminina we've looked at a bunch of times. Uh, I think we're at the point where you can probably step in. Icon had gotten in too early and he got hurt. I think this was a problem with China and that is kind of rearview mirror stuff at this point. Uh does look like an inflection here. Let's just take a look. Reason I think we didn't do anything with this. Yeah, genetic solutions. Yeah, I think this one's okay. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. Yeah. Cash flow. Yeah, I mean this falls under like medical devices healthcare. You're probably okay here. It's come up a lot off the bottom, but I think you could buy pullbacks on this one. You just really have to understand their competitive advantage, and we could never get comfortable around it, but I generally think you're okay there. Uh, Jimmy Jones, UTF for dividend income. That's not for me. No. Pass. Uh, Goran. Uh, Goran, I can't answer that question. You can read into that what you want. Maybe give you a little edge, but I'm not answering that one yet.

This is a good This is a good pick for sure. Um, it's it's a low compounder, but it's it's a compounder nonetheless. And if I can buy it at 2014 prices with more revenues, more cash flow margins are a little bit compressed. Those look like they're reacelerating. I I think you're okay. I think I like this one. Good idea. Um, Michael Gibbon. Okay, that's for investing. Robert, uh, that's for investing. Okay,\n\nthat we're not yet showing signs of recovery really in free cash flow or in revenues.

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nlet's get down to data . How often does the stock market decline? A 1% drop happens 50 to 60 times a year. A 3% drop happens seven or eight times a year. 5% pullbacks happen three to four times a year. 10% drops happen every 13 months. A lot of people forget that. They think it's, oh my goodness, this is the end of the world. No, it's the end of 13 months. basically on average since 1928. Uh 15% drop happens every two years. A 20% drop happens every 3 and a half years. I touched on that with Stu today. Basically, um we've had three of those 20% in the last 5 years. We've pulled forward 10 years of 20% drops, which is why I don't think we're going to see a bigger correction in the near term. There's a lot of recency bias. every everyone looking for what just happened is usually when it doesn't. We had it in 20 uh 2020, 2022, and 2025 in April. Uh and a 25% drop every 5 to 7 years. So that's the average since 1928.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwe've had three of those 20% in the last 5 years. We've pulled forward 10 years of 20% drops, which is why I don't think we're going to see a bigger correction in the near term. There's a lot of recency bias. every everyone looking for what just happened is usually when it doesn't. We had it in 20 uh 2020, 2022, and 2025 in April. Uh and a 25% drop every 5 to 7 years. So that's the average since 1928.\n\nHere is  oil prices adjusted for money supply. As you can see, we are the cheapest in the oil patch since it went negative in 2020. Prior to that was 2014, which was the one of the biggest oil depressions we've seen in our lifetime. And then prior to that was 992000, right before you had a six, seven-year commodity bull run. So, we've got our exposure there. Uh, as we've discussed with National Oil Well, Varco and Commtock is already taken off. Um, uh, National Oil Oil Varco is starting to take off. Here's the flow of funds. uh tend to start to see some strength in the month end, which we're seeing in tech. Uh 30-year mortgage rate. Let's see. Uh that is inverted to existing home sales. Okay, mortgage rates are coming down. Uh let's see. 4.03 on the 10-year if we get that Fed cut, which is 85% odds right now. Uh we could see that 6% just below 6% mortgage before year end. Let's see. Uh China 3% of MSCI all world index US 65%. That's kind of crazy when you consider the um uh GDP of each country being so close. This is going to play catch-up in a material way. Emerging markets at secular turning point versus the US. We haven't seen anything like this since this is one standard deviation below the mean. We haven't seen anything like this since 2000. Generational opportunity uh prior to that in the 80s when you had a huge uh bull run in emerging markets in the early 90s while the US was in a recession by the way and uh going all the way back to the late60s opportunity of a lifetime. So we started to see emerging markets outperformance 2 to1 this year. It is early days in that trend. We will benefit from Baba. By the way, um some of you have said like, \"Oh, there aren't a lot of people in Alibaba.\" What you're missing is that most institutional managers own Baba or at least some of their position. I think we own 90% of our position uh in the Hong Kong shares 9988. So you're not going to see it on their US filings because US filings is not representative of the portfolio. It's representative of those positions in the portfolio that are required to be reported on the list provided by the SEC. So your portfolio is scrubbed against a predefined list of securities from the SEC and what's remaining is what gets reported. And that's why you don't see it from a lot of managers that are now in it. Um, and you won't see the magnitude because it's it's held in Hong Kong. Uh, US Midcap's trading at PE of 15 times versus the S&P at 22 times. Again, you have to go all the way back to 20201 when everyone was chasing the concentrated stocks. They got their asses handed to them and for the next few years you dramatically outperform small caps, midcaps, international value. Same setup today. US stock market breath of the market is low right now. That's starting to turn around. Uh don't fight the Fed. global central bank policy uh 24-month cumulative 316 global central bank cuts uh as of November 2025 which tops August 2010 which was the last time there was this much liquidity in the system post great financial crisis. We didn't even come close during COVID and you know what happened with the market. So, a lot of gas and liquidity in the tank. S&P 500 debt at record lows, government debt near record highs. So, um balance sheets are super super healthy on the private sector side. Uh meaningfully unhealthy on the public sector side. Breath hasn't been this narrow since the tech bubble. again pointing to a normalization of weights and you're seeing signs of some of those stocks come in and come in materially. Uh tech makes up 50% of the S&P versus 40% in 2000. So, you know, again, if you chase what's crowded, you're going to get hurt. We've seen it in recent weeks with the Core Weeaves, with the Palunteers, and with the Nvidias. Uh you knew it was coming. Most people were blindsided and um what was the six and a half percent pullback in the S&P that we had been calling for which is called a secondary correction. On average in years you get 15% corrections or more and then reach all-time highs. The secondary correction averages 6.5%. That's exactly where we were intraday last Thursday. Is it over? I'm not sure. We still have a little bit of hedge on uh but as you know we were putting more money to work and um the names that we're putting money to work we don't really care what happens with the general indices because we're just grateful to buy them at the current prices. Um if the Fed cut happens as is 85% expected probably the most pain is in the rear view mirror. I think you'll probably get one more scare before the December 10th meeting. Maybe a retest, maybe a cut through just to really mess with people. Uh but if that cut goes through, should be okay from there. Uh stuff is old, we're due for a reinvestment cycle. That's capex that helps cyclicals. Weaker dollar equals EPS tailwind. We estimate for every 10% drop in the US dollar represents about a 3 percentage point boost to S&P earnings. We're seeing that in estimates for next year go up to 308 from 305. So that's positive. Uh on track for a record year in healthc care M&A. So that's gone straight through the roof and the stocks are now starting to follow despite having record low performance since 2000 to the S&P 500. uh near record low waiting in the S&P 500 and record low multiple uh PE multiple relative to the S&P 500. All formulas for massive generational inflections, which is why we added another position in healthcare, uh which we will disclose. Uh we're getting close to everyone being fully invested and we'll disclose it at some point in the future along with our restaurant uh well food consumer discretionary business. We'll leave it at that. um clients know what it is from the ones who can look in their portfolio uh and see and the most people we've been been able to find some room for it. If you haven't, we've told you what it was and uh and you can get some on your own if you if you were in a cash account and didn't have any room. uh but you've received a Christmas gift gift card so that you could do your own due diligence on our newest position. So, uh pretty excited on that front. Dividends should contribute more than over last year's ZERP environment. Dividend payers, there are three areas I wanted to cover this morning for Vney, but we didn't have time. The key was be selective. Healthc care uh we we just covered consumer discretionary. We had the biggest cut on record, two standard deviations below the mean. Uh and that's creating massive opportunities. The common denominator between our two new holdings is they are massive uh if not the highest dividend payers in their respective sectors. uh and dividend payers will be massive beneficiaries of the ongoing easing cycle. Remember number one 316 cuts globally. Number two, quantitative tightening uh discontinues on December 1st, meaning uh quantitative easing is probably on the table in coming months. And three, we are at the early stages of our easing cycle getting back to the neutral rate of 3% or lower. Next, oh, so here's what you see. From 1936 to 2013, the dividend provided 39% of the total return of the S&P 500. During the zero interest rate policy, when uh tech and Momo stocks outperformed 2014 to 2024, dividends only provided 16% of the total return. Get ready for a reversion back to dividend payers dramatic outperformance. And if you look across our positions, we got a quite a quite a few of them that are going to benefit from this situation. Uh low expectations, consensus, long-term growth forecast near a record low. That was evidenced in the question that Stuart posed to me. Could stocks stay down for 10 years? And uh I that was off-the cuff question that he asked and I gave an off-the cuff answer. The thing that I would add is that what he was calling for, namely or asking if we could have uh 10 years where stocks don't go nowhere like the 70s. We just had it from 2000 to 2012. Uh there were basically no net returns in the stock market to get back up to the watermark and then it broke out and continued. So, uh, I think that's more of a mid 2030s to mid 2040s story. Uh, and I think we've got at least, you know, six, seven, eight years of super gas left in the tank right now. Uh, long only exposure to consumer dress discretionary is low versus history. This is a generational opportunity, which is why we added some exposure with the new position there. And uh in years where small cap profits growth is outpacing large cap profits growth and accelerating, small caps have outperformed 75% of the time and by an average of 9 percentage points. That's the story for next year. Non-farm payrolls. The upturn in payrolls in September was mostly due to imprecise seasonal adjustments. Non-farm seasonal was the most generous for September on record due to very very different previous years. Okay. Wall of worry. Which worry do equities overcome first? AI capex mania and the credit undercurrent. Valuations remain stretched. Fed still leaning hawkish. Repo market stress. Liquidity tightens. US election watch sentiment risk ahead. Crypto deleveraging positioning for rebound. Private credit and early signs of strain. Breath breakdown concentration at extremes. K-shaped economy and divergent consumers. data blackout and policy blind spot. So, you can go through those one by one. Just pause your video player. Number of stocks lagging 10% behind the S&P 500 year to date. We are at near a record not seen since 1999. So, something to keep in mind if you were overweight. The most highly concentrated stocks, [Music] percent of stocks raising earnings guidance. This is up to 37 or 38%. So that's a positive thing. We're seeing it in the overall number. Analysts expect S&P 500 margins to expand to 15.5% by the end of 2027, which would be an all-time high. Rare to see multiples compress when margins expand. We agree. November and December performance by day. So, we're seeing some end of November strength and then maybe some chop in the middle of December and finish up strong. Small caps tend to outperform in December, by the way. Um, here we got put volume at levels near historic uh points where where you see rebounds. Uh, whether Thursday was it or not, it did meet the number that we had been calling for when everyone was super bulled up in in October and we kept saying going to get a 6 and a half% correction. uh we got it or pullback. Uh is that all? I think that's going to be dependent on the Fed. But if we get more, it will be concentrated in those names that have already been hit the hardest. Um namely um the highf flyers. Uh so it won't affect you uh nearly as much. And if it doesn't happen, you're already positioned and taking advantage of the any year-end strength. How large could cloud international revenue be? Alibaba cloud is undergoing rapid international expansion in Asia, Europe, Latin America, tapping AI compute, sovereign AI demand with increasing capex build up into higher data center density internationally. 900 of Ali cloud's nodes are located overseas versus 2,300 nodes located in China and sticky multi-year revenue growth outlook. We estimate international to contribute 1/4 of Alibaba cloud's external revenue by fiscal year 28 estimate from mids single digit in fiscal year 2025 growing at high double digits from 25 to 28 kagger uh on the back of one full stack AI plus cloud hyperscaler offerings two accelerating data center buildout globally three its international pricing premium measured by Quen token relative to domestic and four targeted sector clients, five global enterprise client win. So this is pretty exciting bullcase here. 76% upside on our revised bullcase implied valuation of $280 US per share of uh Baba and 271 in Hong Kong 9988. Scarcity value of China's AI full stack exposure, exponential growth in inference, and everything we've been talking about. So, I love this note. Uh, we don't have a source here. Uh, Goldman Sachs. Okay, great. There's your source. Goldman Sachs with a $280 price target on Baba. Opinion follows trend. These were part of the uninvestable camp just a short year and a half ago. Now, they're climbing on board. Uh, it will overshoot that target. Uh, and when everyone is all in at 300 plus, we will be helping them out with our shares. But for the time being, enjoy the ride and get some popcorn. Mostly fair winds. Global cruise industry has been steadily growing except for pandemic years. That's going to help Disney. Russell 2000 relative to Russell 1000 seasonal pattern since 1979. Ah, here it is the data. Okay. Small cap outperformance from mid December through March. This is from Yale Hirs over at Stock Traders Almanac. The best part of the year for small caps tends to be mid December through March. Uh so that's that extreme fear here. So that's what what you're seeing with the bounce. Uh let's see revenue growth. Public companies history favors above average returns even over one-year periods, especially when you don't have a recession. That's from Carson. There are 37% more home sellers than buyers. You lower rates a little bit. They're going to clamor in. New home price now lower than existing home price. Haven't seen that since 1982. The last time you had an aggressive hike and then a easing cycle uh and then it took off after that. So I think we're setting the stage for another bull market there. Uh discretionary investors are implicitly pricing that earnings growth is about to drop sharply and turn negative. Um except that's not happening and they're going to be pleasantly surprised. Maybe it'll be because of the $2,000 checks from Trump if the Supreme Court does something silly with tariffs. But uh more likely than not, the consumer is stronger than anticipated. Uh Magnificent 7 free cash flow growth has turned negative. Uh that's uh what we've been calling for. China bulls 30% in two years. Uh we forecast Chinese equities to rise 30% over the next two years is from Goldman Sachs driven by low teen trend profit growth and moderate PE expansion. Uh we agree Alibaba will be the big beneficiary of that. Meat prices coming down on the bacon side with lean hogs also coming down on feeder and on um live cattle contracts. Michigan consumer sentiment index lowest since uh the COVID lows prior to that the 1980 vulkar tightening cycle very similar history rhymes doesn't repeat to the Powell tightening and easing cycle uh is this still a contrarian signal University of Michigan consumer sentiment index S&P average forward 12-month returns when you have the lowest 5% of consumer readings 12-month returns are up 18.7%. We are in the lowest 5% right now. Prime Book percent of total US net exposure. Healthcare biotech just getting started. Health healthcare XBiotech just getting started. Biotech has been off the charts. Our XBI is crushing it. Uh super grateful. That one took a long time, couple of years, but now we're getting paid like it's going out of style. So, we're excited to see that. Uh, valuation rally contracts in periods above the median EPS growth and accommodative monetary policy. So forward 12 uh PE 12-month rate of change in greater than median EPS growth plus accommodative Fed policy uh 91% chance of retaining the high multiples is what they're basically implying consumer price index is right at the mean which has been 3% since 1915. more cuts coming. They're expecting a move to 3% on the Fed funds rate by July 2026. That would be amazing. Earnings are expected to remain strong. Yeah, as I said, $38. That's up from 305. Earnings growth year-on-year mag 7 versus other $493. That's current forward is going to they're going to be parry pursue and the multiple spread is huge. We like to play those type of divergences. Uh pockets of momentum chasing have reversely uh pockets of momentum chasing have reversed sharply. Performance of a basket of stocks with the most net call volume in the previous week. So remember all those calls I said record for 23. None of those got paid. They all got smoked the last minute in November. Uh there's still a decent amount of volume in December, but nothing like November, which is why I think we might get one more scare. Uh but we shall see. Policy stimulus index is as low as it was since 2000 2001 and then it turned up. So we'll see what happens there. valuations become less stretched as you move down the S&P 500. So, uh, based on waiting, the S&P is at 22 times. Basically, the top 10 weights are at 27 and a half times, but the bottom 10 weights are at 14.8 times. That's where you're finding some bargains. Uh, speculative short ETF volume. Uh, you know, it's at the level where you could be bottoming here. It could also get a little higher and, you know, have one more leg down. Um, I I think you're guessing. I mean, it wouldn't surprise me if we have one more leg down. Uh I I'm agnostic to either way. I'm positioned fine irrespective of of the outcome. Um but there's an awful lot of confidence in that cut and I think maybe you get a little shakiness ahead of the meeting. percent of large cap mutual funds expect 245 billion in M&A supply in 2026. So that's talking to animal spirits. We had 73% corrections so far in 2025. This is from Fundstrat with the one 21.4% intrayear correction, the third in 5 years when that should be only happening once every three and a half years. So I think we pulled forward a lot of the pain. Um short ETF volume really extreme which points to potentially uh Thursday having been the bottom. We we will see median S&P 500 carries above average short interest. So there's still a lot of pessimism there. average equity fund flow by calendar month over the past decade excluding US election years. Uh December is the largest. So just keep that in mind.\n\n\n\nfree cash flow growth has turned negative. China bulls 30% in two years. Uh we forecast Chinese equities to rise 30% over the next two years is from Goldman Sachs driven by low teen trend profit growth and moderate PE expansion.

We we will see median S&P 500 carries above average short interest. So there's still a lot of pessimism there. average equity fund flow by calendar month over the past decade excluding US election years. Uh December is the largest. So just keep that in mind. And finally , what else do we have? Top 1,00 universe by market cap percentage of stocks with greater greater than 10% draw down over the past six months. 66% of the top 10,000 stocks are down more than 10%. Uh which no Morgan Stanley is pointing out is a lot of damage. The damage under the surface is notable. Healthcare had the most earnings beach since 2021. That is a key another key reason that we uh added another major position in healthcare uh in the last week and a half plus. And let's see here. Uh, driven tightness, ESS driven tightness and China mine suspensions have reduced inventory days and pushed lithium prices higher. As I told you, we took all the profits on our Albamaro spreads at three and between three and 4x across the board and um kept 100% of the stock. So, we often do that when one of our names has a parabolic move and um you know, we know the stock is going to pull back and consolidate for six months before it takes the next leg leg higher or at least we we know that's a risk. So, we'll take the multibag on the spreads andor the straight options.

So that that's a big move over the next few years. Uh here's a different view of the Russell. Same type of chart on the shorter term basis that we're seeing on the longer term basis. Uh this is a long building base that we've had in small caps and now is ready to break out. Same with uh EPHA now breaking out relative performance the S&P emerging market index.

Look at this base that has been building as this breaks out.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\n\nHere's the European index again looking to find it find a new high. Uh, and I think Hang Sang, what a monster move we've had here. Uh, but we got more to go. Here's some support at 24847. We'll see if we have to hit that before making the next leg higher. Uh, here is  the more daily. It's broken out retest and that tends to move higher from there. Uh, after retesting 10-year yield, everyone was calling for it to break through five. We took the opposite side. Now it's going to break through four on the downside. 30-year yield went up here. We had a counter trend bounce that we talked about. Now it's rolling back over. And the dollar looks like it's going to break this counter trend move yet again and start to weaken once more. Here's the resistance line on the weekly chart and here it is on the daily chart. So, expect the dollar to reverse lower in coming months, euro to reverse higher in coming months. Uh, all my friends with the Canadian looney, here's your support.

And then there was another essay louder here. Huge move off the bottom. Almost doubled. Now it's been consolidating, ready to move next next target 125. And I think we've got them all. Okay, so that's that. Couple other charts. This is the daily as of today. It's right at the 6774 level. If it could push through that and and move to new highs, we're we're off to races. It looks that way. Um, but if we got some rug pull from the Fed uh and break through this, you know, that's where the 6147 comes into play. I'd assign that like a 30% uh probably like a 20% probability, 80% probability we stay above this recent low and uh push to new highs in 2026. But this is not completely off the table yet. covered the yields. Semiconductor index trying to make a move off that low. That was a pretty big move down. Uh we'll see if it holds.

The uh one of the director bought 70,000 shares uh for a million bucks. And uh let's see what were the\n\nearnings this week . I actually clicked off those tabs while those come up. Let's see those are probably yesterday. I think we had the reason I want to cover them is because yeah consumer staples I think they were down 50 basis points and consumer discretionary a lot of opportunity in both of these sectors. uh 2026 estimates down 41 basis points. The stocks are down a lot more. Let's see where the biggest drops were. Clorox, the the recent low in Clorox was probably generational buy. That's slow steady money, but that that's a compounder. Uh constellations probably washed out. Craftind's probably washed out. target probably probably going to find a bottom here. And that's that. Let's take a look at discretionary top 30 weights revisions up 17 basis points for next year. And let's take a look here. Tesla had a big downgrade. Donald Starbucks.

That's good for the Fed. uh earnings as I said up to 308. So now let's get on to the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions . We've got a lot and then we'll get you to your turkeys and your football games. Jake at Primac uh is asking about FMC, the gift that keeps giving. A lot of people want to bottom uh catch a falling knife on this one. Look, I mean this stock is pricing in bankruptcy. I think that bankruptcy is uh not the greater probability. It is a probability but not the greater probability. So you flip a coin three times, you're going to wind up okay. You flip it once. Let's see here. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. So, you got 2.8 billion in cash and receivables, 3.2 billion in debt, and uh that's that cash flow turned negative. Let's see what it is for the last 12 months. Yeah, negative half a bill. So that's that's what's got everyone worried. Uh that and the fact that revenues won't turn around yet on a sequential basis. They're showing some lines, some signs of hope. Share count stayed pretty steady. Historically, it had been a high return on capital business. So, you know, you're effectively playing. I mean, this is this is the type of stock you throw in your personal portfolio. You size it. If you're right, you treat it, you want to treat this one like, you know, a $13 call option with without an expiration date. Because if you're right and this thing works back to normalized volumes, you get an 8 to 10 bagger. If you're wrong, you're at zero. Um, we can't do that with uh meaningful amounts of money. Uh certainly not for clients. Take that kind of risk. But I do think there's probably some opportunity here uh if you're willing to size it appropriately relative to the risk. But this is the whole a basket. The business has been around since 1883. I think you're probably uh gonna wind up making really good money over the next few years, but it's not a risk I can take across the board, but it is a risk that I would uh explore on a sized correctly basis in a speculative bucket of a personal portfolio. So, hope that's helpful. York uh bourgeoa He wants to play Sprouts, UNFI, and GO as a play on GLP1s. I don't like any supermarket business, so pass. We'll save you some Thanksgiving time on that one.

AMRZ I think you're a little late on this move. See, looks like the revenue's been flat for a while. Uh, I think it's a little early to tell on this. I'd rather play Brad Jacobs QXO. It's got a lot of free cash flow though. It's trading at 27 times earnings 20 times. Okay. I think it's okay.

Uh, Nova Nordisk, thanks for great content. Buying back stock AI tech enhanced drug development. Yeah, I mean look, uh, t### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhere is  I don't want to spend a lot of time talking about this right yet, but there's an oral drug GLP-1 in phase two uh, that they don't have. Uh, I think the $30 $40 range, if you can get it, you get it. You may not be able to get it. If you buy it here and it goes to $30, buy more. Uh, I'm not in a rush to get this one. This one's a broken Momo stock, so it's going to take some time to rebuild a base and to rebuild the confidence. That doesn't mean the fundamentals aren't sound. I think it's generally fine, if not good. But, uh, they're kind of monopoly on the weight losses in the rearview mirror despite having a lot of other good drugs. So, would I buy it here? Yeah. Would I like it better at 40 or 30? A lot more. Um, I'm in no rush to take any action on this one, but we've covered that one pretty much every week. And I continue to say the same exact thing. Jackson Matthews, Novo. Same story. You can buy it here. Just be ready to buy it lower. Theo DJardan Aker Solutions. You got to send me a ticker, partner. If it's not a US stock, I'm going to assume this is what you're talking about. No, not for me. Next. Jim D. Uh, Jim, I can't answer that question. Hope that's helpful. You can reverse engineer that response. FND. Not yet. soon. I like it in the high 40s. I don't know if you get that, but this is not going to rebound like overnight. Oscar Slater, long time listener, first- time caller. Thank you. Uh oh. Uh, Pinterest B I N S I don't even know why this thing exists, but let's see what the financials tell me. P I N S H record free cash flow. Ah They have increased the share count a little bit more than I like. I don't like that tendency, but we're starting to generate a lot of cash. broken growth story. I think between 20 and 25, you could probably start to build a long-term position, but you got to do a lot more work. I I don't really understand the business, so it wouldn't be something for me, but on the financial basis, you know, it's like Zoom and some of these other left for dead things. You probably get a puff out of it, and there's no reason not to like it other than it's a hard business to understand and predict. uh watching some of your old episodes from 2022, came across your episode where you were looking at Carvana when it was sub $10. You ended up saying, \"I'm more bullish on new car sales versus new car sales right now, but at the share price this low, I have to start considering a company like Carvana.\" Uh, did you ever wind up a billing position? No, I did not. Um, that was a speculative gamble. That would be something you put in a personal account. You can't put other people's money in that. Milan Kersner been following your podcast. That's a complicated story because one fund controlled most of the stock along with the owners. So, if one of those two blew up or had uh margin calls, the the whole story, it would have been over overnight. And that's why I couldn't put meaningful money in it. Oh, it worked. They were able to manage their way through, but those guys can get taken. You know, rule number one is don't ever get taken out on a stretcher. Both the fund and the principles were very close to be taken out on a stretcher. So, yes, it was attractive, but it could have also been a zero. And um uh rule number one is don't lose money. Rule number two, don't lose don't don't forget rule number one. And if I had to do it all over again, I'd make the exact same decision. Uh, and here I am five years later or three years later, not on a stretcher. Uh, not with all the roadkill that happened, all the tech businesses, all the VC businesses that went to zero, uh, that no one writes about, no one talks about because those people are all now Walmart greeters. So, um, that's that. Milan Kersner, been following your podcast for over four years now from Canada. Look forward to hearing your market take on every Thursday. Thank you very much for that loyal support. I'm very grateful for that. Uh family topic every week was wondering if you could take a look at Trans Ocean rig and share your thoughts on it. Yeah, rig is lower quality. I'd rather do national oil well Varco but um I think rig will work. Uh, the problem I had with Rig, I think they were pigs on stock and deluded their owners at certain points in their history, which I really don't like. They might have had to do it to survive, but I don't like that they even put themselves in a position to have to do it. So, I'm very unforgiving when it comes to uh lack of respect to to the equity. And uh yeah, they're still doing it. The share count's up 50%. So, a hard pass cuz the underlying business could double and if they double the share count, it doesn't help you. Uh, yeah, and they're they're giving a lot of it to themselves. So, they're they're animals here. Uh, hard pass. Doesn't mean the stock won't go up when the when the whole group turns. Um, and Kristoff is asking about PayPal and he's worried about stockbased comp and CA cash flow and he's wrong. And I'm going to show you why. So, just so you know, we gleefully have been buying a lot more in the market. Um, revenues continue to grow. Share count has collapsed from 1.2 billion down to 986 million. They're buying stock when the price is low. That's what we like to see from management. And what's happened to stockbased compensation? It has also declined from 1.4 billion 5 years ago down to 1.1. I'm not saying that's the greatest thing ever. I'm just saying that it's on the right trend. Share count's going down and stockbased comp is going down at the exact same time. and free cash flow has been robust five to six to7 billion per year. So um so that's that you're overthinking it because the price is down and you think that you know something that you don't. The po the point is this next move will take all these weak sisters out and then the next move will be straight to 100 and then beyond. I told you guys the max pain would be to take it down to 49, take it below this low and get absolutely everyone out. I don't know whether it'll go that low before it rebounds. I think we're probably closer to the end of the pain than the beginning, but uh this would be max pain. We would back up the truck and uh see you at 150. But uh for now I'll leave it to these guys. Next is from Joel Sarah Bransky. Yeah, he's talking about margin decline in the hyperscalers. We agree. Paul Wy, hey buddy. one of the best putters in Southern California. Thanks for taking the time and effort putting into the program each week. Your perspective and recommendations help us better prepared informed investors. Lionel Basil LYB. Okay. He's asking about the dividend. I wouldn't be buying it for the dividend. I would just assume they're going to cut the dividend and then if you still want to buy the stock, you're probably right. Let's take a look here. All right. So, the problem we have\n\nTrans Ocean rig and share your thoughts on it. Yeah, rig is lower quality.

He's asking about the dividend. I wouldn't be buying it for the dividend. I would just assume they're going to cut the dividend and then if you still want to buy the stock, you're probably right. Let's take a look here. All right. So, the problem we have here is  that we're not yet showing signs of recovery really in free cash flow or in revenues. But if we can get comfort around the balance sheet, I think this is one you could probably take a flyer on. Talk about I mean the revenues have been almost cut in half. Talk about a cyclical business. So you got 10 billion of debt. You got two billion of cash, three billion of receivables. What you really need to know is when does each tranch mature? Uh but in the meantime, you still have 730 million of free cash flow. and management that has been buying in stock and giving themselves a lot of stock at the same time. So, uh I think you're okay with this one. Uh as far as the dividend, let's see what the dividend is. It's just leverage. I mean, that the market's afraid of their ability to refinance. Um, dividend yield is 11%. I wouldn't be surprised if that got cut in half, but that would actually be positive for the stock. So, I would say I kind of like it here. I like it. I I kind of like it here. you know, 40 to 47 48. Uh, I think you're probably okay and I kind of like the pick. So, uh, there you go, Paul. Good one. Uh, next is Thomas Bar says, \"Hey Tom, thanks for all you do. Of all the financial experts in the media, your methodology makes the most sense by far. Buffett would be proud.\" Thank you for that. That's a kind compliment. When when you own companies with significant margin of safety as you do, do you expect them to still significantly outperform even if the MAG 7 see a magnific massive selloff in 1999 to 2000? So many small cap and midcap consumer discretionary companies saw their stock price bottom and then rally all through 2000 to 2001 despite the broader index collapsing. Uh yes, they will outperform on a relative basis. If everything goes down, they'll go down less. But as you saw with Buffett buying the things that no one wanted, kind of like what we've been doing this year, uh, when the others got hit, his actually went up as the indices were collapsing. We think that'll be a similar situation. Aluminina we've looked at a bunch of times. Uh, I think we're at the point where you can probably step in. Icon had gotten in too early and he got hurt. I think this was a problem with China and that is kind of rearview mirror stuff at this point. Uh does look like an inflection here. Let's just take a look. Reason I think we didn't do anything with this. Yeah, genetic solutions. Yeah, I think this one's okay. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. Yeah. Cash flow. Yeah, I mean this falls under like medical devices healthcare. You're probably okay here. It's come up a lot off the bottom, but I think you could buy pullbacks on this one. You just really have to understand their competitive advantage, and we could never get comfortable around it, but I generally think you're okay there. Uh, Jimmy Jones, UTF for dividend income. That's not for me. No. Pass. Uh, Goran. Uh, Goran, I can't answer that question. You can read into that what you want. Maybe give you a little edge, but I'm not answering that one yet.

This is a good This is a good pick for sure. Um, it's it's a low compounder, but it's it's a compounder nonetheless. And if I can buy it at 2014 prices with more revenues, more cash flow margins are a little bit compressed. Those look like they're reacelerating. I I think you're okay. I think I like this one. Good idea. Um, Michael Gibbon. Okay, that's for investing. Robert, uh, that's for investing. Okay,\n\nthat we're not yet showing signs of recovery really in free cash flow or in revenues.

      "the segment seven. Alibaba's strong balance sheet gives us plenty of confidence in the ramped up investment cycle into quick commerce and AI plus cloud with cash and other liquid investments totaling 80.6 6 billion, 21.5% of the market cap and a net cash position of 41.1 billion. 8 management repurchased 2 million shares during the quarter for a total of 253 million, bringing year-to- date repurchases to $1.1 billion with 19.1 billion remaining in the authorization effective through March 2027. This is exactly what we want to see from management. Last year when the stock was at $80 and below, they were consistently repurchasing 4 to5 billion per quarter.

      "Emerging markets outperformance 2 to1 this year. It is early days in that trend. We will benefit from Baba. By the way, um some of you have said like, \"Oh, there aren't a lot of people in Alibaba.\" What you're missing is that most institutional managers own Baba or at least some of their position. I think we own 90% of our position uh in the Hong Kong shares 9988. So you're not going to see it on their US filings because US filings is not representative of the portfolio. It's representative of those positions in the portfolio that are required to be reported on the list provided by the SEC. So your portfolio is scrubbed against a predefined list of securities from the SEC and what's remaining is what gets reported. And that's why you don't see it from a lot of managers that are now in it. Um, and you won't see the magnitude because it's it's held in Hong Kong. Uh, US Midcap's trading at PE of 15 times versus the S&P at 22 times. Again, you have to go all the way back to 20201 when everyone was chasing the concentrated stocks.\ninternational revenue be? Alibaba cloud is undergoing rapid international expansion in Asia, Europe, Latin America, tapping AI compute, sovereign AI demand with increasing capex build up into higher data center density internationally. 900 of Ali cloud's nodes are located overseas versus 2,300 nodes located in China and sticky multi-year revenue growth outlook.

So this is pretty exciting bullcase here. 76% upside on our revised bullcase implied valuation of $280 US per share of uh Baba and 271 in Hong Kong 9988. Scarcity value of China's AI full stack exposure, exponential growth in inference, and everything we've been talking about. So, I love this note. Uh, we don't have a source here. Uh, Goldman Sachs. Okay, great. There's your source. Goldman Sachs with a $280 price target on Baba. Opinion follows trend. These were part of the uninvestable camp just a short year and a half ago. Now, they're climbing on board. Uh, it will overshoot that target. Uh, and when everyone is all in at 300 plus, we will be helping them out with our shares. But for the time being, enjoy the ride and get some popcorn.\nChina bulls 30% in two years. Uh we forecast Chinese equities to rise 30% over the next two years is from Goldman Sachs driven by low teen trend profit growth and moderate PE expansion. Uh we agree Alibaba will be the big beneficiary of that. Meat prices coming down on the bacon side with lean hogs also coming down on feeder and on um live cattle contracts.

Management remains confident in strong free cash flow going forward as investment levels begin to taper. Seven, subscriber growth came in better than expected with total Disney Plus and Hulu subscriptions reaching 196 million, an increase of 12.4 million sequentially, driven mainly by higher wholesale Hulu subscriptions. Disney Plus added 3.8 million subscribers organically, up 3% sequentially with average revenue per user up 2% to $84. Eight management is doubling planned share repurchases for fiscal year 2026.

For the full year, the segment generated 3.16 billion in revenue, up 6%, and a record 10 billion in operating income, up 8%, accounting for just under 60% of the company's total operating income.

Three, the sports segment posted 17.67 billion in revenue for the full year flat yearon-year, while operating income grew 20% to 2.88 billion, coming in 7 percentage points ahead of prior guidance. The new ESPN full DTC service and enhanced ESPN app are off to a strong start with 80% of ESPN subscribers opting for the trio bundle that includes Disney Plus and Hulu. A very positive sign for meaningfully reduced churn. Four, Disney's big bet on cruises continues to pay off with demand remaining very high uh and new capacity filling as quickly as they can bring it online. Utilization has held in line with historical levels despite a 60% increase in capacity. Disney has two new ships launching in coming months, bringing the fleet to eight ships with five additional ships scheduled beyond 2026 that are expected to be meaningful contributors to Experienc's growth in the years ahead. By the way, this is their highest return on invested capital business. While management doesn't break out crises separately, cruises separately, they continue to highlight the segments highly attractive margins and the highest guest satisfaction ratings across the company, which provides significant pricing power. Management sees the upcoming slate as the strongest in years, led by Zootopia 2 and Avatar Fire and Ash in 2025, and followed by The Mandalorian and Grou Toy Story 5 and the liveaction Moana and Avengers Doomsday in 2026. Disney has already cleared four billion at the global box office for the fourth consecutive year and has produced four 1 billion plus films over the past two years, while no other studio has delivered a single one.

Parks, cruises, and consumer products together generated close to $10 billion of operating income. and we believed were worth close to $80 per share on a standalone basis. That meant the rest of the business, whether ESPN, DTC, the studio assets, or the linear networks, was essentially being thrown in as a free flyer. So, you can see here experiences uh 11% Kagger sports operating income and the entertainment operating income is really starting to take off. At the time, Mr. market had assigned these segments close to zero value simply because Disney hit a few bumps and took its eye off the ball. But with a 1000year plus operating history and a long record of navigating cycles, we were more than willing to take the other side. With a margin of safety that large with a margin of safety that large and a business this durable, it didn't take rocket science to see the value. We expected that once I returned, he would write the ship and get these segments back on track so Disney could get back to doing what it does best. In the meantime, the experiences segment would buy the company time to work through the hiccups, build out its next growth engine, DTC, and squeeze the remaining juice out of the linear networks. Fast forward today, and our original thesis remains firmly intact. The only difference is that those same businesses once written off as having zero value have come roaring back and are stronger than ever. DTC just posted 1.3 billion of operating income and is on track for 10% operating margins in fiscal year 2026 after posting a $4 billion loss only three years ago. The film slate is the strongest it has been in years with the studio delivering four one plus billion dollar releases over the past two years while no other studio delivered a single one. Again, none of this required a stroke of genius. It simply required knowing what we owned, understanding the cycles, and recognizing that sentiment swings to extremes and eventually reverts to the mean. So, it should be no surprise that our confidence continues to grow with or without Mr. Market's manic reaction in the short term. We continue to see Disney as one of the most durable businesses with some of the strongest IP on the planet. As a double-digit earnings compounder that lets us sleep like a baby at night, Disney remains a no-brainer. And sooner or later the market will come around to that reality. So here are the key points from the earnings breakdown and the you can go through at hedge funips.com.",
      "ESPN subscribers opting for the trio bundle that includes Disney Plus and Hulu. A very positive sign for meaningfully reduced churn. Four, Disney's big bet on cruises continues to pay off with demand remaining very high uh and new capacity filling as quickly as they can bring it online. Utilization has held in line with historical levels despite a 60% increase in capacity. Disney has two new ships launching in coming months, bringing the fleet to eight ships with five additional ships scheduled beyond 2026 that are expected to be meaningful contributors to Experienc's growth in the years ahead. By the way, this is their highest return on invested capital business. While management doesn't break out crises separately, cruises separately, they continue to highlight the segments highly attractive margins and the highest guest satisfaction ratings across the company, which provides significant pricing power. Management sees the upcoming slate as the strongest in years, led by Zootopia 2 and Avatar Fire and Ash in 2025, and followed by The Mandalorian and Grou Toy Story 5 and the liveaction Moana and Avengers Doomsday in 2026. Disney has already cleared four billion at the global box office for the fourth consecutive year and has produced four 1 billion plus films over the past two years, while no other studio has delivered a single one. Disney generated 18.1 billion in operating cash flow for the full year with free cash flow reaching 10.77 billion up 18% yearonear and a record high for fiscal year 2026.",

Doubling planned share repurchases, bringing total buybacks to $7 billion and is also increasing the cash dividend to $1.50 per share, up 50% year-on-year with a 1.5% yield. Nine, Disney continues to invest heavily in the experiences segment with expansion projects underway at every theme park. Five additional cruise ships scheduled for launch beyond fiscal year 2026. And a new theme park plan for Abu Dhabi. Fullear capex for 2025 came in at 8 billion, up from 5.4 billion in the prior year and is expected to rise to 9 billion in fiscal year 2026. Most importantly, the returns on invested capital for the segment remain highly attractive and reached record highs earlier this year. 10. management's Q1 guidance came in weaker than expected due to a handful of one-time expenses, including 90 million in pre-opening costs for cruises, 60 million in dry dock expenses, theatrical slate timing, and lower political advertising revenue for the full year. Management still expected to deliver doubledigit adjusted EPS and reiterated confidence in double-digit EPS growth for fiscal year 2027.",

So, you got 2.8 billion in cash and receivables, 3.2 billion in debt, and uh that's that cash flow turned negative. Let's see what it is for the last 12 months. Yeah, negative half a bill. So that's that's what's got everyone worried. Uh that and the fact that revenues won't turn around yet on a sequential basis. They're showing some lines, some signs of hope. Share count stayed pretty steady. Historically, it had been a high return on capital business. So, you know, you're effectively playing. I mean, this is this is the type of stock you throw in your personal portfolio. You size it. If you're right, you treat it, you want to treat this one like, you know, a $13 call option with without an expiration date. Because if you're right and this thing works back to normalized volumes, you get an 8 to 10 bagger. If you're wrong, you're at zero. Um, we can't do that with uh meaningful amounts of money. Uh certainly not for clients. Take that kind of risk. But I do think there's probably some opportunity here uh if you're willing to size it appropriately relative to the risk. But this is the whole a basket. The business has been around since 1883. I think you're probably uh gonna wind up making really good money over the next few years, but it's not a risk I can take across the board, but it is a risk that I would uh explore on a sized correctly basis in a speculative bucket of a personal portfolio.

It could go to zero, but if you're right, you make five bags on it. Um 140 in cash and receivables. 1.6 billion in debt. The the key is the leverage. They just haven't been able to get out of their way with sales either. I don't I don't love it, but I think you can make a good amount of money with it. So, um, let me see here. Let me see how many shares he bought. Might just be token or is it real? He bought $86,000 worth of stock. That's kind of a joke. I mean, it's better than zero, but you know. Okay, Bill Mcgru, longtime listener. Love the pod. Tell all my friends what do you think about Wirehouser. Thank you for telling all your friends. That has been that's what's kept this thing growing is your word of mouth. There's no sign of a turnaround yet. I'd be more interested at 1750 than I am at 22. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. I mean, all you're betting is can they make it through the cycle. So, they're burning cash, but they can make it through this cycle, I think. Yeah, they're they're they'll I think they'll manage. Um I think you're okay. I'd like it in the high teens if I could wait, but he may not get it. Eric F. Oh, everyone keeps asking about Fever Tree. I think you're late on that, partner. They make selzer water. Yeah, wait for a quarter where revenues actually start to inflect. Let's just see here. Yeah, not yet. It's not really showing signs of inflection yet. At 500, I'd take another look. I don't know if you'll get it. Robert's asking about Proctor and Gamble. I don't know what software it is, but you can get any screencast type thing. Um,"

I think they're better plays in the building supply um sector, but um probably worth doing some more work on. Thanks for sending that in. Tim Kwin, hey Tom, what's your view on Jack?

Ah They have increased the share count a little bit more than I like. I don't like that tendency, but we're starting to generate a lot of cash. broken growth story. I think between 20 and 25, you could probably start to build a long-term position, but you got to do a lot more work.

I would just assume they're going to cut the dividend and then if you still want to buy the stock, you're probably right. Let's take a look here. All right. So, the problem we have here is  that we're not yet showing signs of recovery really in free cash flow or in revenues. But if we can get comfort around the balance sheet, I think this is one you could probably take a flyer on. Talk about I mean the revenues have been almost cut in half. Talk about a cyclical business. So you got 10 billion of debt. You got two billion of cash, three billion of receivables. What you really need to know is when does each tranch mature? Uh but in the meantime, you still have 730 million of free cash flow. and management that has been buying in stock and giving themselves a lot of stock at the same time. So, uh I think you're okay with this one. Uh as far as the dividend, let's see what the dividend is. It's just leverage. I mean, that the market's afraid of their ability to refinance. Um, dividend yield is 11%. I wouldn't be surprised if that got cut in half, but that would actually be positive for the stock. So, I would say I kind of like it here. I like it. I I kind of like it here. you know, 40 to 47 48. Uh, I think you're probably okay and I kind of like the pick. So, uh, there you go, Paul. Good one."

I'd rather do national oil well Varco but um I think rig will work. Uh, the problem I had with Rig, I think they were pigs on stock and deluded their owners at certain points in their history, which I really don't like. They might have to do it to survive, but I don't like that they even put themselves in a position to have to do it. So, I'm very unforgiving when it comes to uh lack of respect to to the equity. And uh yeah, they're still doing it. The share count's up 50%. So, a hard pass cuz the underlying business could double and if they double the share count, it doesn't help you."

      "hard pass. Doesn't mean the stock won't go up when the when the whole group turns. Um, and Kristoff is asking about PayPal and he's worried about stockbased comp and CA cash flow and he's wrong. And I'm going to show you why. So, just so you know, we gleefully have been buying a lot more in the market. Um, revenues continue to grow. Share count has collapsed from 1.2 billion down to 986 million. They're buying stock when the price is low. That's what we like to see from management. And what's happened to stockbased compensation? It has also declined from 1.4 billion 5 years ago down to 1.1. I'm not saying that's the greatest thing ever. I'm just saying that it's on the right trend. Share count's going down and stockbased comp is going down at the exact same time. and free cash flow has been robust five to six to7 billion per year. So um so that's that you're overthinking it because the price is down and you think that you know something that you don't. The po the point is this next move will take all these weak sisters out and then the next move will be straight to 100 and then beyond. I told you guys the max pain would be to take it down to 49, take it below this low and get absolutely everyone out."

And if I can buy it at 2014 prices with more revenues, more cash flow margins are a little bit compressed. Those look like they're reacelerating. I I think you're okay. I think I like this one.
