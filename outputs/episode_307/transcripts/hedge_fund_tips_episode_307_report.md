# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode Not applicable
### Not applicable

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on small caps, midcaps, and international stocks, particularly Chinese equities like Alibaba. He believes the Magnificent 7 are overvalued and their earnings growth is decelerating, while the unmagnificent 493 offer better value with accelerating earnings growth. He is also bullish on housing-related stocks, particularly building suppliers, as well as regional banks and PayPal. He sees a potential for significant upside in Intel due to government support and a strong turnaround leader. He is bearish on Nvidia at current levels, citing supply constraints and valuation concerns. He is also bearish on FuboTV and Cava.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Constructive, favoring small caps, midcaps, and international. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Earnings growth reacceleration in the unmagnificent 493.
- Potential for Fed rate cuts to boost interest rate sensitive sectors.
- Undervaluation of Chinese equities and potential for foreign capital to return.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a shift in leadership from the Magnificent 7 to the unmagnificent 493. Earnings growth is decelerating in the MAG7 while accelerating in the 493. Fed rate cuts will disproportionately benefit interest rate sensitive sectors like housing and small caps. Chinese equities are undervalued and poised for a rally driven by domestic and eventually foreign capital.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| S&P 493 Earnings Growth | Accelerating from negative to positive | This is the key divergence that people haven't dialed into yet. You want to go for accelerating at half the multiple. |
| MAG7 Earnings Growth | Decelerating from 30%+ to single digits | You're paying 33 times still for declining earnings growth. |
| China Allocations in Active Funds Globally | 6.5%, near historical lows | Missed the entire rally. Unbelievable. They are going to be chasing when Alibaba's 250 and 300. |
| US Light Vehicle Inventory | Low, below pre-pandemic levels | Gives reason to think new vehicle sales will rise in the next few years. |

## Featured Company Deep Dives
### Alibaba – High Conviction
Alibaba is a proxy for Chinese AI and the toll taker of the middle-class recovery and pivot toward consumption. The stock is undervalued and poised for a rally driven by domestic and eventually foreign capital.

**Key Metrics:**
- Cloud revenue accelerated to 26% year-over-year.
- AI related product revenue posted triple-digit growth for the eighth straight quarter.
- China e-commerce accelerated 10% topline growth.
- Trades at 17 times earnings with analysts now pricing in 31.2% earnings growth for next year.

**Valuation / Target:** Target $250-300 when foreign capital capitulates.
**Action:** Buy

### Intel – High Conviction
Intel is a dark horse in the AI game and is poised for a turnaround due to government support, a strong turnaround leader (Lip Boutan), and the need for diversified chip manufacturing capacity. Downside protected, upside unlimited.

**Key Metrics:**
- Government support and funding for the Arizona 18A node.
- Lip Boutan's track record of turning around Cadence Design Systems.

Disney is back to doing what it does best, creating blockbuster hits. Record free cash flow and subscriber growth. The company's three-year target of sustaining doubledigit earnings growth through 2027 remains firmly intact.

**Key Metrics:**
- Adjusted EPS crushed expectations at 1.61, well above the 1.45, up 16% year-on-year earnings growth.
