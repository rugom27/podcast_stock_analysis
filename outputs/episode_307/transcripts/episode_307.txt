Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 307th videocast podcast for the week ending September 4th, 2025. A lot of great stuff to cover this week, but as always, family first and then we'll get down to data. Here we go. Uh this is a picture with the family and our friends Wallace and Laura at the the club. There was a a luau thing over there, so that was a lot of fun. Then, oh, by the way, uh was uh super excited. I was actually able to pull it off, ladies and gentlemen, and win the second flight club championship, uh uh out in Connecticut. Um, by the way, all three brackets were hard fought. The first match I was able to pull out on 18. The second match I was able to pull out on the 17th hole and the final match on the 17th hole. The final match was was ugly. Uh it wasn't our our best showings, but uh uh being a little less bad was enough to to pull it out. And that's with the little trophy there um for that flight 729 index. And um pretty surprising. And I I think the Caddies I mean if anyone had actually taken me in the bracket they could retire from catting because I think the odds were 30 to1 uh against but um very grateful to do that and um my competitors made made me work for every single stroke and uh just a great group of guys. Uh, want to thank John Miller for sending me this amazing Fiori Golf gear. Uh, John is uh the former CEO of Swisser International who had a multibag performance doing that. Now he's involved with this uh and um friend of Mike's. And this is just high quality stuff. And what's cool about this, I'm wearing it now. These colors are like no other. They they sit up whereas, you know, most golf shirts are just flappy and they sit down. Um, very cool stuff. Young guy in Ventura doing this. So, fiorigolf.com. Thank you, John. Um, then I want to see what else we got here. Oh, that was at Yahoo right after the podcast last week. Uh, their studios, always a great time. That's it on the pictures. Uh, then I want to thank everyone for continuing to vote for Animal Hayes for youth athlete of the year. You can go to uh we'll put this link uh on hedge funips.com for both the videocast post and the podcast post. like we did last week. Um, and every single vote counts. Just do the free votes. I know they ask you for other votes and everything, but uh vote uh early and vote often as as much as you can. She's doing a great job. She's first in the category. This closes out in a few hours, so uh let's not take anything for granted and keep pushing her forward to uh I guess what will be the final week. So, pretty excited about that. Uh then I want to thank Taylor Smith Cloier uh for having me on Yahoo Finance with Miles Uland. We're going to listen in here. >> Time ever. Our next guest noting that while August and September have tended to be weaker and more volatile months in the calendar, anybody still waiting for another major correction this year likely to be disappointed. Here to discuss this and more is Thomas Hayes. He's great Hill Capital's chairman and managing member. So Tom, let's just start um let's start away from maybe the overall look at markets and something you flagged in your note that we've talked about this summer, but I want to, you know, to kind of double click on, which is the most shorted stocks like the meme trade, things everyone hates. If you pull up screeners, you can do a three different ways, but some of those most shorted names. Um, I mean it's intuitive, you know, short squeezes happen all the time, but like we have seen some of those names be real market leader stocks have doubled, tripled. What does that say to you about sentiment in this market and how has that really evolved um, you know, just over the last couple of months? >> Yeah, this is uh, this is the keep your job trade because basically you had $1 trillion of equity sold in the whole April 7th. Managers simply haven't caught up. They've been skeptical the entire rally, most hated V-shaped rally. And uh what we get trapped into as investors is recency bias. We think what's happened in the recent past is going to happen again. Uh on average the last 100 years we've had 20% corrections every 3.5 years. We've had three of those in the last 5 years. So everyone's like when's the next one coming? Uh the next one is not coming. Three to not coming soon. >> Um >> 3 to 5% dips from now through the year end. You want to be a buyer. uh managers are going to be buyers, but they can't chase what's already up. They can't chase mag 7 and catch their benchmarks. What they have to do is chase the lagards. And you know what, Chair Powell's about face kind of on Friday has paved the way that this trade can really really work into year end because it's concentrated in small caps and midcaps. Can I think where you really get screwed honestly as a manager is if you're chasing indices and day-to-day ticks. I mean what what we did we did a conference call with our clients on uh literally on April 7th and we went through every single portfol port portfolio company by company and assumed the worstc case scenario with tariffs. They were pricing in beyond the worst case scenario and I said listen I have never asked anyone to send in money period y >> uh and and there was one other time I did which was the fall of 2022 and I said if you're going to send in money now's the time. Uh, and at that time we were buying tech which was you couldn't give away Google, you couldn't give away Amazon. >> We did the exact same thing and my clients stepped up and we bought everything because >> if the worst is priced in and you know what you own on a company by company basis and solveny risk is off the table. So maybe you get a couple quarters of margin compression, you've got to be a buyer there. There's no way to outperform if you don't take advantage of uh dislocations. Otherwise, you have efficient market theory, right? >> And and and then there's no then there's no room for an active manager. So when when it's raining, you you got to roll. You got to just put out the umbrella and go by. >> All right. There you go. Um all right, let's talk about a name you do like. Uh Intel. >> So I'm just curious what you make of this whole situation cuz there's there's two tracks. You've got the fundamental like what's going on with the company? Can Lip Boutan turn this thing around? And now the government's, you know, 9.9% passive equity holder. >> Yeah. So >> allegedly passive, >> um >> formally passive, let's say. >> So we can get have the ideological argument, should the government be a stakeholder? Should they not? Should the taxpayers be a stakeholder? Should they not? The fact of the matter is they took our money. We should get something. Okay. So, so now existential risk is off the table, which means if I'm a potential client, we saw Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia's growth deceleration, massive growth deceleration in terms of sales growth. It's not for lack of demand, it's for lack of supply. That 18A node in Arizona is going to get done. And on the back of the government's uh investment, you saw who uh Masayoshi son softbank said, "Oh, government's in. I'm in. Here's $2 billion. Let's go." I believe Intel can be an advanced chip designer. And then lastly, you're betting on the jockey. Lip Boutan is a rockstar. He came into Cadence Design Systems when the stock was down 86%. Over the next 14 years, if you had invested with him, you got a 68 bagger. $1 million became $68 million. I'm not saying that's going to happen with Intel, but if they get this fab right, uh, you know, here's the thing. AMD, >> Nvidia, >> uh, Vago, all of them, they are designers, arm holdings. They design, they don't produce. So, they rely on the kindness of strangers. If Taiwan semiconductor goes away tomorrow, they are out of business. They desperately need Intel to succeed. And once Intel succeeds, where are they going to direct their orders? If they want an ear in Washington, they're going to direct them to Intel. If they want to spread their risk, they're going to direct them to Intel. It's going to be a monopoly. Let's call it a duopoly. It's going to be a very good thing. And Lip Banan's going to be a hero. All right, Tom, stick with me. All right, time now for some of today's trending tickers. Still here with me is Great Hill Capitals Thomas Hayes. We're taking a look at Tesla, Snowflake, and Amazon. So, let's start with Tesla. The EV makers troubles in Europe continuing to add up. Tesla EV registrations a proxy for sales on the continent down 40.2% in Europe compared to a year ago. You see the stock here down about 1%. Uh and I guess as we think about this kind of name, Tom, it's just like for Tesla, uh there's the Elon piece of it and now the Elon part feels like it's moved on and now we're just talking about like are sales growing at any rate? Like what's the fundamental story here for how many people are going to buy Teslas and all the places they sell them? Yeah, I mean down 40%. Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln? I mean, holy cow. Uh, I will say he's doing some innovative things. He's got that Y Tesla Y L coming out in China, which is a three row Tesla. That should help offset the competition, but competing with BYD, they're beasts. I mean, this was Charlie Munger and and Buffett's uh kind of soul China play for a decade. It took a decade to work and then it was like a 20 bagger in two years. Um, and and they they can perform. They are very very competitive on features. So I think Elon is now getting close to sleeping on the factory floor again and he's going to innovate and he's going to catch back up. Uh he puts out a good product. I just bought one, brand new one for my wife. I'm not an EV guy. She wanted one. I was like, "All right, I'm the last of the party. You know, maybe it's over." But but uh it does some incredible things and now you can talk to Grock and and if you look at some of Grock can get pretty nasty on different settings. So uh a lot of fun there. So, look, I think the the story with Musk is he will paint a picture of the future with the humanoid robots, with the full self-driving to buy him enough time to fix what's broken. And historically, he's done that over and over and over. And sooner or later, he fix what's broken. What? So, if he if he broke the brand a little bit, if he fell asleep on innovation and refreshing the designs a little bit, he'll get there. The guy knows how to do it. >> All right. Uh let's take a look at shares of Snowflake. that stock uh up double digit percentages at last check. I think up as much as 20% during today's trading session up >> saw MongoDB. I mean, welcome to crazy town. Only only in today's market can you trade at 25 times sales, lose money like crazy, and be worth $80 billion. I mean, you know, what else do you want to talk about? But look, it's part of the AI theme. They were left for dead. Now they're now people are like, well, maybe they're not dead. And they they perform better. They grew their customer base by about 10%. Their retention was 125%. Uh, so some positive things are happening there. So price is what you pay, value is what you get. A lot of great things happening. Is it worth 80 billion? I'm I don't know. Not with my money, but for someone it makes a lot of sense. >> And I'm just curious, Tom, from your perspective, um, both as a consumer and an investor, how you've looked at this really consolidating phase within media and consolidating around the tech players. I mean, YouTube now kind of is TV. Uh, Amazon now has all the major sports just about in their ecosystem. Um, and it's, you know, we're kind of back to this place where it's like, well, what did you think was going to happen? I mean, the biggest companies were probably going to be getting getting the biggest mind share. Yeah. >> It feels like it's a duopoly, but Netflix is the producer of content and Amazon is the reseller of content. It's almost like to to a lesser extent, Amazon is almost to a to a lesser extent given up on producing their own and they'll just resell. And I find myself, I'm like, why do I have so many subscriptions inside of Prime? I used to have them outside of Prime, but I got tired of like clicking all over the Roku 80 different directions. I was like, I just buy them all. The HBO's in the Prime, the uh Peacock Soon will be in the Prime, etc. So, um, look, I it's it's nice to see that Amazon continues to add value to Prime members and continues to get people into their ecosystem and continues to innovate, but it's a juggernaut. And, uh, this is just one more play. I think there are a lot of left for dead uh uh cable channels per se that are like small public companies that are going to get consolidated into the bigger players and seeing NBC Universal spin out of uh Comcast and some of the channels there. So, it'll be very interesting to see how this evolves. You see success now with Disney Plus profitability, what they're doing with ESPN. So, everyone said, well, you know, it was it was all about numbers first, then I was like, oh my gosh, we have to make money. What about that? Uh and then and now now like Disney Plus is making money. Um some of these other stations I think as they get consolidated and you get economies of scales on bigger platforms, they'll be able to make money and and there's a lot of tremendous uh valuable content out there. I love what Amazon's doing here and I think it'll be good for the industry. >> It's not very millennial with me, but I'll tell you what I have. I have cable. It's great. >> Exactly. Only one. >> Turn on the TV. There's everything's there. Fantastic service. Someone should really look into that. >> Yeah. I tell you we could it could all the bundling that's happening. We're we're going to write wind up right back where we started. >> I am a happy customer. Um all right that you like any ways that you've positioned or I guess maybe just sort of a macro view on the sector and how it feeds into some other trades. >> Yeah. Um two things I would say if I'm going to play banks tomorrow I'd be playing regional banks. I'd be playing the small caps. I think there's more upside there. I think there's going to be a lot of refinancing happening. If you look at earnings growth of small caps, 35% next year trading at 17 times versus large cap or S&P 500, 13% earnings growth next year trading at 22 times. Uh so that's helpful. Our biggest financial position, believe it or not, is PayPal. It's been left for dead. Uh Alex Chris came from into it. He ran the small business division. Had a huge multibagger there. Uh he's doing some innovative things at PayPal. They're generating record free cash, buying record amounts of shares back, uh doing a lot of stuff with Venmo, with PayPal. Their transaction margin is expanding. So, I like the innovation uh in the international aspect. They're one of the top stable coin issuers. Most people don't know that about PayPal. So, they're on the cutting edge, believe it or not. And 435 million users around the world. So, it's very hard to destroy that when you're generating that kind of free cash flow. So, we're playing it in a non-traditional way at the moment. But, I do see the M&A story. I do see the banking story, but I play it on the smaller bank side to the point that he was making about the deals. >> You know, uh, David, it's me now is Thomas Hayes, Great Hill Capital chairman and managing member. Tom, a record day on uh, Wall Street. We're seeing that the S&P 500 closed above 6,500 for the first time. Uh, in a lot of talk about Nvidia, which has been really the news of the day. Yeah. your biggest takeaways from where this market's at and Nvidia, we're seeing a record without Nvidia actually in the green. >> Exactly. I think get ready for that theme to continue. I think the lagards are going to continue to outperform as we've seen kind of in the last four weeks. A lot of the most shorted stocks have outperformed. Small caps and midcaps are starting to take the mantle. The unmagnificent 493 are starting to get bid now. Why? Because the unmagnificent 493 earnings growth is starting to reacelerate from flatline to negative levels just about a year ago, whereas the MAG 7 earnings power is actually decelerating from 33%. This coming quarter will be the first quarter it could be below 10%. So you've had multiple contraction on the 493 that's going to start to expand as earnings grow. You've had multiple expansion on the Magnificent 7 that's going to start to contract a little bit as earnings decelerate. And you saw with Nvidia uh the big story there was data center deceleration GPUs for the first time compute the core part of data centers decelerated sequentially 34.1 billion to 33.8 8 billion that was masked by networking, but the streets a little cautious on that and it was a little bit offset by maybe Trump allows him to do a modified blackwell into China. So the stock held up after after the disappointment from earnings, but we have to keep a close eye on that because that China is a huge figure and the revenue deceleration from 300% growth rate down to 50% growth rate in a year or so is pretty abrupt >> and it's not much of a dip that we saw today. I mean 8/10 of a percent, but investors do tend to retail investors at least buy the dip when Nvidia goes down. So it'll be interesting what happens there. But I also uh we were also talking uh earlier about Intel as well and and and sort of the Intel component to this as well. What's your theory there? >> Well, the issue for Nvidia, the the negative sequential growth is not for lack of demand. They're putting out a great product. They've got unlimited backlog demand. They have a supply bottleneck. They're dependent on the kindness of strangers. If Taiwan semiconductor ceases to exist or can't give them the allocation, which is the case right now, they're in a lot of trouble. So, what they need, the best thing that could ever happen to Nvidia is that the Intel deal succeeds and the Arizona 18A node gets online next year to start to produce more capacity of advanced chips for Nvidia. There's unlimited demand. So, what is good for Intel will be good for Nvidia. Obviously, Taiwan Semiconductors investing in the US as well to increase capacity. But the reason for that deceleration is the their growth, their revenue growth every quarter is capped at about $4 billion. You're seeing that every quarter. Uh that's that's not from Nvidia's orders. That's from Taiwan Semiconductor saying this is all the growth that we can give you and that's why you've seen that growth rate decline. >> What I've been surprised is the leadership that we've seen in this market. I mean we have seen year to date. We're looking at industrials that's in the green. Industrials is actually the leader communication services tech utilities all those touch points that really have to do with AI with tech with manufacturing as well. >> Yeah, you've got the reshoring theme coming back. I think now that rates are coming down, you're going to see a whole level of new leadership start to come up. Housing has been left for dead. All the building suppliers, all the ancillary players, autos have been left for dead. The average car on the road is 13.5 years. Now Trump is getting you. We've got the steel, we've got the lowcost energy, we've got production going in the US. Uh US sellthrough has been at depressed levels for the last few years. It's starting to reacelerate. People need cars. You lower rates, they're going to get cars. Incentives are going up. So I think uh a lot of lagards now will become leaders and we're going to see some real opportunity into year end in small caps and midcaps where you can get double the earnings growth for a much lower multiple. >> So is it the rate cuts that is going to propel this market forward? Yes, I think it's going to propel the uh uh rising of stocks under the surface. I I think you could see a period of subdued performance for the Mag 7 and outsized performance for the unmagnificent 493. Doesn't mean they'll do bad. The Magnificent 7 just means they'll do less well. And the ones that have been lagards, like you saw this year, last year industrials not so good. This year they're the top leader. The last shall be first. I think we're going to see that in all the interest rate sensitive sectors, the cyclicals, the small caps, the midcaps that people have been afraid to bid, but now that the economy is kind of accelerating, we saw in some of the GP GDP numbers, uh they will be good buys, >> some catchup that we'll be watching. Uh Tom Hayes, thanks so much for joining us for this past hour. >> Thank you. >> And we're back. Uh then I had the opportunity to join Soore Financially with Kai Hoffman. He's got a podcast over there. They do mostly do metals and macro stuff, but uh this is my second time joining. He's got a great uh audience, and I want to thank him. We'll listen in here. We are witnessing a dramatic shift in the financial markets as we speak. Gold, silver are breaking out. Gold is trading at an all-time high, but we have to figure out like what changed in the macro landscape that now the precious metals are moving, the S&P 500 is retreating, the dollar is retreating ever so slightly, but it is having an impact and bond yields are dropping as well. So, what has changed? Was it just a speech by Jerome Powell and Jackson Hall, or is there more to it? And I've invited a fantastic guest to discuss. His name is Tom Hayes. He's the chairman of Great Hill Capital, also the the publisher, the editor, the host of a fantastic podcast called Hedge Fund Tips. Go check it out on YouTube as well. We'll link to it below. And we'll try to make sense of what is going on in the markets. Are we looking at a traumatic shift in the markets or is this just a blip on the radar screen and maybe just something more micro? Maybe just the precious metals. Maybe I'm too focused. Maybe I'm too much in my own bubble. So, I'm curious what Tom has to say about that. Before I switch over to my guest, hit that like and subscribe button. It helps us out tremendously and we much much appreciate it. Did I mention it's free? A must have. So, thanks so much for doing that. Now, everybody else, oh, Tom, thank you so much for joining us. It's good to see you. I hope you had a great summer. >> Uh, thanks for having me, Kai. Uh, yeah, we did have a great summer and uh, super happy to be here with you. >> Yeah, really looking forward to catching up. A lot has happened. It feels like in the last 10 days, it seems like the floodgates have opened. A, I'm super busy on workwise, but also the markets are reacting, responding. I don't think it's just the end of the summer. I think there's more to it. What is your like assessment of the economy and the financial markets right now, Tom? >> Well, I think uh you know, you referenced gold and silver. We don't spend a lot of time on that. We're equity managers. But I will say that Powell's acknowledgment of his duel mandate and the kind of cracks in the labor market and the recognition of those and not being so uh systematically focused exclusively on 2% inflation was was very very positive. And then I think a little bit of what you may be seeing today was the after uh Friday headline about the tariffs may be voted illegal. Uh, President Trump loves has has spent his career in court. He will litigate this to the end. He will appeal it until the cows come home and the tariffs will ultimately go through. Um, I think if I had to have a view on metals, I'd be less sanguin than the market is right now. uh I'd be more inclined to be focused on the uh unmagnificent 493 some of the left for dead parts of equity markets like small cap some opportunities in in international I think that's where you're going to see doubles and triples and quadruples I think uh uh to expect that uh in gold and silver from these levels is a is a bit ambitious. >> No, it it it is I don't see $9,000 in gold for example next week. Um, and we'll get maybe to some sectors that are still undervalued in your opinion here in a second, but we do have to stay uh on on the macro side for a second because President Fed Governor Chris Waller also brought up jumbo cuts uh last week. It was uh >> yes, >> it was it was mentioned. >> Curious like a what is your interpretation of a jumbo cut? Is it 50 basis points? Is it 100 basis points? And uh why it seems like the market is reacting to it. Well, we are going to know if we're getting a jumbo cut on Friday because that's when we get the jobs report for August. That's what everyone's focused on. If that comes in a lot weaker and with considering the revisions that we've gotten in recent reports, uh it's not out of the question that that could come in weaker, uh then 50 basis points is on the table. I think Trump has got Powell surrounded at this point. Powell has made the proactive shift, so he's not going to get caught sideways. uh he's done on his own valition to shift shift that talk. But when you look at Waller, when you look at Bowman, they're going to push through Mirram before the SE September meeting. And Lisa Cook, I mean, you know, the one thing that she's been missing in all of her thou dost protest has been uh I'm innocent. She's been saying you have no right to fire me. You're a bad man for firing me. But she's not said that I'm uh innocent. So if she's out then, you know, right now we're at the most dissenters in three decades. You add that to the fold. Uh and effectively, you know, a a a larger than 25 basis point cut could be a reality, but the data definitely has to support it. The data has supported a 25 basis points uh sequence for for many many months when you consider how restrictive the Fed is in terms of uh being you know 150 basis points over the rate of inflation. Uh they're they're going to move. The question is how much? My bet would be 2 to 325 bips cuts before the end of the year. More likely two. But if that employment date is weak on Friday, everything's on the table. >> Yeah. No, and that's that's exactly what everybody's looking for, I guess, but some sectors and and maybe coming back to gold, and we don't have to be this doesn't have to be a gold discussion, but it's often that gold predicts stuff that's supposed to happen in the future, and now gold is rallying, hitting 3500. Maybe it is pricing in a two rate cut already. Maybe it's pricing in negative data based on what you just said, like all the revisions um that we've seen for like May, June as well. Um, why isn't the S&P 500 rallying if it expects or if the if gold expects 500 or 50 basis points or a jumbo cut? >> I haven't found gold to be a useful predictor of anything other than people's interest in buying gold. But, uh, leaving that aside, I would say uh, copper is probably a better economic indicator than gold, although it's been less reliable in recent in recent years. I think the number one predictor of uh, of expectations is um, is earnings. You know, earnings are the name of the game. You know, markets don't go up by accident. Over time, they're a short-term voting machine based on emotions and headlines and expectations. In the long term, they're a weighing machine based on fundamentals. And the fact of the matter is, uh, what we're seeing is kind of a divergence that people haven't quite dialed into yet. And that divergence is the Magnificent 7 that everyone is still crowded into. Uh slowly a little bit of air coming out. Uh has had aggressively decelerating earnings growth rates from 30 plus percent to 33% a year ago to this quarter will be the first quarter where in aggregate the MAG7 earns somewhere between you know uh high single digits to low double digits call it 9 to 13% earnings growth. uh for this quarter. While the unmagnificent 493, the Left for Dead stocks that people haven't been paying as much attention to, uh is now accelerating from negative earnings growth last year to four, five, 6% and by a year from now when MAG7's at 10%, Unmagnificent 7 will be at 493. Why is that important? because you're paying 33 times still for declining earnings growth, whereas you could pay, you know, 16 17 times for accelerating earnings growth. And that's your arbitrage. If you want to make a lot of money in a reasonable amount of time over the next one, two, three years, uh, skate to where the puck is going, not looking in the rearview mirror to where the puck has already been. >> Yeah. No, it's uh, it's interesting like you've been talking about Nvidia and Nvidia put out solid earnings, although data center demand seemed to be down. I'm not an expert on Nvidia by any means, but uh it seems like growth is slowing a little bit, although three to four trillion dollars in uh investments into AI and chip. Doesn't sound like uh it's nothing, right? How is that going to be split up? Let's discuss that. Like what are the prospects of others? Because I want to talk about Intel with you as well. Um how's the three to four trillion being split up here? Look the this was the first quarter sequential negative growth in data center GPU okay the compute part of data center GPU compute that everyone the AI dream is built upon was actually negative sequentially the category was positive sequentially because it was masked by ne networking which no one cares about it's not you it's not a useful indicator As for the, you know, anticipating uh the AI perspectively, I would say uh that doesn't make Nvidia a bad company. It doesn't make uh make it a a bad situation. What it what what Nvidia suffers from is the same thing that AMD, ARM Holdings, all the rest of them, Broadcom, uh uh they are designers that rely on the kindness of strangers for their business to exist. And the kindness of strangers is singular, not plural. It's right now it's called Taiwan Semiconductor. And you'll see the revenue growth on a sequential basis quarterly going back, you know, a dozen quarters has been about $4 billion revenue growth per quarter. That's not because the demand stopped at 4 billion growth. It's because the supply stopped. Taiwan Semiconductor has limited Nvidia's allocation to 4 billion of growth. So the law of large numbers dictates when the denominator gets larger uh and you have the same revenue growth on the top line your revenue growth declines considerably and that's exactly what happened down from you know 300 400% revenue growth to on track for 50%. Which you know any other business would say this is the greatest thing that's ever happened to us but um when you're on that downward trajectory that's a problem. So the dark horse in the AI game that no one's talking about is Intel and Intel. Uh the better Intel does, the better the government deal with the Intel does uh the better it is for Nvidia, ARM Holdings, AMD because their growth is limited by capacity, the ability to supply to meet the overwhelming demand that they have. and that 18A node in uh Arizona that that uh that is going to be completed that they're going to be able to produce advanced chips on and interestingly enough right as the US government was funding with the 9 billion plus the two billion grant all of the sudden Masayoshi's son of SoftBank comes in and he says oh I want to put in two billion dollars also because I believe Intel can play a major role in manufacturing advanced chips. So, you know, here you've got one that's trading at liquidation value. If they if they liquidated Intel today and did nothing more, you'd get 22 23 bucks a share. And if uh half of what they say is going to work, you wind up with 80, 100 or more per share. If they completely destroy the fab business, like I don't know, the build, you know, I can't imagine how they could do it now with the government back stop, but let's just say that business goes away and they just focus on the legacy business. It's probably worth 40 45 bucks. So you know downside protected uns upside unlimited you got the biggest winner running the turnaround in Lip Bhutan he came into Cadence Design Systems his last company when the stock was down 86% familiar situation as it relates to Intel and over the next 14 years he turned the thing around and if you had put a million dollars in Cadence uh design systems when he became CEO 14 years later you had $68 million. So 68 bagger. This guy is no joke. He's a miracle worker and he's going to do great things at Intel. Not a 68 bagger, but if you get a three, four, five bagger in a reasonable amount of time, uh it's something that you're not going to see per se in an Nvidia which is trading at, you know, four four and a half trillion dollars. So what are we going to have a five bagger and it's going to be 80% of the US economy? Like you know, grow up. Like let let's do a little bit of math. Pull out the crayons. I could explain this. You know, if our glo if our economy is 30 trill, you know, 25 trillion, how much can Nvidia be? And my sixth grader will be like, probably not a whole lot more. Maybe double, dad. Maybe every 50 cents out of every dollar we're going to spend is on Nvidia. But I doubt it, Dad. We have to like eat and food and clothes and shelter and all that stuff. But people don't think like that. They chase the shiny objects until the until the momentum runs out and, you know, the trap door opens and they say, "What happened?" you know, they missed by 1% and the stock is down 50 and people can't understand why. >> Yeah. Well, have you seen the prices of the latest GPUs, the 50 series? It's insane. So, it is it feels like half the economy if you have to spend half your household budget on a graphics card. >> Um, but real quick on the topic of Intel, maybe there's a lesson to be learned here. Like what where did Intel go wrong? Like there they were a powerhouse just a couple years ago or maybe four years ago. Like I remember trying to buy uh parts for a computer that I've been building and Intel was everywhere. They had the greatest gaming chip. Where did they took take the wrong turn here? >> Yeah. It's the normal entropy. You know, they got big, fat, and happy. And they spent times in committee meetings and they had all this middle management that passes paper back and forth to justify their existence versus innovating uh staying competitive, staying hungry. It's uh complacency set in and they got the the others their competitors ate their lunch. So um the beauty is with Lit Bhutan that culture has been gutted. Uh he's been firing so many people and taking the fat out of the middle and uh focused on you know writing tickets actually doing business actually innovating actually staying competitive actually being hungry and um you know it starts from the top. It was there was a cancer at the top. it's been uh extricated and now we've got a winner at the helm with uh unbelievable blue skies uh and now they got the backs stop the existential risk is off the table with the implicit backs stop of the US government and it is a national security decision and it was the right decision I'm not saying that uh Donald Trump should take equity stakes in Lockheed Martin they're doing just fine they don't need government money but Intel did need that vote of confidence uh the money is helpful to ensure that these nodes get completed and the advanced chip production can start in the United States. And once that happens, you know, if you're a chip designer and you want to diversify your risk from Taiwan Semi, you're going to start putting chips into Intel. If you want an ear in Washington, you're probably going to start putting your orders through Intel. As long as Intel can deliver the quality, which they will, uh um it's it's going to be off to the races because no one's even close. They're they're at the 10 yard line and they almost got, you know, stopped right before the end zone. Instead, they got a little tailwind from the government to push them over the end zone. They're going to spike the football and people are going to say, "What happened?" And you're going to have five, six, seven bagger in Intel and uh you know, Nvidia is not going to go up nearly as much from these levels. Not because it's not a great business, not because there's unbelievable demand, not because there's not going to be robots. There are, all those great things are going to happen. The question is how much of that is already priced into one stock versus the other stock. And as you know, Kai, you know, Amazon.com was making bold promises in 2000. And uh all of the things that they promised came true and a lot more. The problem was people were already paying for those things to come through 15 years later, which did come true at the prices they were paying in 2000. So what did they have to endure over the next two years even as the fundamentals of the business continue to improve? A 90% draw down. And and I'm not calling for that at all on any of these mag seven stocks. I think they'll be fine. I just think they're going to do less well in the next couple of years than they have done in the last couple of years. uh that doesn't mean they won't do well less well. I'll bet the fundamentals continue to improve. The question is did the price get ahead of itself and are there better ways better uh returns for your dollar uh looking elsewhere uh before people start to look in those pockets that that uh exist great opportunity. >> Yeah, absolutely. No, it makes total sense. And you brought the the or the meme of a tush push uh to to my to my mind. So uh just pushing That is Oh, you don't? Okay. It's a football analogy. Like Philadelphia Eagles are famous for it where they place a couple players behind the quarterback and push him into the end zone. >> Love it. >> Cuz they got stopped short and uh now the quarterback's being pushed in, but uh they're using his tushi to push him in. So that's why it's a tush push. So no, really interesting uh analogies here, but uh I I understand where you're coming from on Intel. Um maybe just one last like really short followup. um is just the the topic of nationalization and the government really stepping in. We've seen it in other sectors, MP materials getting grants at least or or also direct investments from the government. What what is your take on it? Like what what what is your opinion, your two cents on uh government stepping in? >> Look, it's a national security issue. I mean, if if uh if in the event China took over Taiwan, which is not going to happen anytime soon, but if it did, uh Nvidia's out of business, AMD's out of business, arm holdings out of business, all the designers are out of business, they design everything, they produce nothing, and um and we're toast. And then China has all the chips they can put into weaponry, they can put into whatever they want, out compete us all day long. So, if we're not doing this, so this is like, you know, I'm not calling it I'm not saying we're at war, but if that were to happen, we're toast. So, uh, you know, if you look back to World War II, if you are were a factory owner and you were producing furniture or, you know, kitchen tables or cars or whatever, yeah, you know what? You retrofitted your factories and you started producing weapons, okay? Because we needed them for the war. So, this is not like uh we're going to pick winners and losers. This is like we have no choice. Intel's the one at the 10 yard line. Let's give them the tush push as you said. Push them across the end zone through the through the center there. Get get them up the middle and uh and get it done. And and that's that's what we're talking about here. This is not like should we, shouldn't we? There's there's not a choice here. I mean, unless the government's going to start from scratch, they got it's going to take them four or five years to do what where Intel is today ready to go. They've made all the investment. I mean, look, Gellzinger, he's no lip boutan, but I will say he's probably not as bad as advertised. He was they let him do what he did. He was near the finish line. The board the the price got of the stock went down because the sell side couldn't wait five more minutes. So, he got kicked to the curb. So, it is what it is. Uh, you know, out of every negative comes a positive. the positive is Lip Bhutan is is a proven huge winner. Gellzinger, you know, was uh was a mentee of Andy Grove. So, he he knew his stuff, but um you know, Intel's now set up for for great things. And it's not again, it's not the government picking winners and losers. It's the government having no choice. And it is national security. And it is something they need to be involved in. And and we as taxpayers, if we're going to give Intel something 11 billion, why do we get nothing? Why do we get, you know, because because we didn't because the government didn't plan ahead. They should get 11 billion of our dollars and we get nothing. No, the go we as the taxpayers are now going to get a five bagger. It's going to reduce our deficits. And again, this is opinion, not advice. Maybe we don't get a five bagger. Maybe we get a two bagger. Maybe we get a 10 bagger. I have no idea. But I think the upside is much greater than anyone is uh considering at the moment. >> Perfect. No, Tom, appreciate that point of view here. And uh I just found my YouTube title, the tush push for Intel. >> Yes, I love it. I love it. >> Fantastic. Um but let's zoom back out again. Let's come back to the the Fed cuts because there's another topic I want to discuss with you is the housing market in general as big US economic impact or factor in the US economy. Um, I I feel like there's a false sense of hope a little bit in the housing market and I'm curious what your take on that is because the second we talk about a Fed rate cut, everybody talks about cheaper mortgage rates and maybe making housing affordable again. Do you agree with that statement? Like what is your take on the housing market right now, Tom? >> Uh, unequivocally. You know, there's this whole narrative, oh, we cut rates last year and mortgage rates went up, therefore the Fed fund rate has nothing to do with it. That's complete nonsense because what you're what you're going to see happen is something that you haven't seen in a long time. Okay? People have a short memory. And what you're going to start to see happen once we get another 50 basis points, maybe 75 basis points, is something called option ARMS, okay? Which are priced off of short rates. And what it is is a teaser rate where they say for seven years you pay interest only of you know whatever it is 100 200 bips above Fed funds rate. So you could have you know 5% interest only 5 and a half% interest only for seven years. If you're betting rates are going to go down further. That's a good thing. You can refinance it. If you're betting rates are going to go up higher you're betting well I'm going to be out of the house anyway. You know say Levie. So uh uh that's the that's the short end of the curve affects the five and sevenyear option arms and that game has not even started yet and with Bull Bill Py at the helm that they are going to bring that game back. That's number one. Number two, you have $35 trillion of home equity locked in people's houses. Okay, for anyone sleeping under a rock, uh just take a look and see what's happened to house prices over the last four years. people are stuck. They have high rates. They can't trade out of them, but they've got trillions of equity lock. And if you get rates down into the fives uh for HELOCs, for 30-year fixed mortgages, which we will, uh you are going to see the the option arm game come back for people buying new homes. You're going to see the heliloc game come back for people who own homes. And that's going to be a massive stimulus in the US economy that people cannot even comprehend that's going to take place. St lending standards are going to go down a little bit. Credit is going to expand. Household balance sheets are the healthiest they've been in decades. We got plenty of room for credit expansion and for an expansionary cycle. And then you take the four million home deficit because we've underbuilt for the last decade and a half. You take the 72 million millennials aged 34 who are trying to start families family formation, housing formation, haven't been able to afford. And then you got over the weekend the possibility of Trump declaring a national emergency for housing. What does that mean? Is he going to take your house and give it to someone who can't afford a house? No. He's going to open up federal lands till the cows come home. And by the way, there's more than enough federal lands in actually metropolitan areas. People think it's only in super rural areas where you buy a new house and you get a free elk. That's not the case. Uh the case is that we need, you know, 500,000 acres and he can do that easily. Once he declares a federal uh a federal emergency, he can automatically open up those lands and that's going to create unbelievable opportunity for the homebuilders to do massive volumes uh and supply the unmet needs and um and and that fundamentally is not going to drive house prices up as everyone thinks when rates come down prices are going to go up more. It's actually going to drive uh um house prices down because number one, you're gonna have increased supply and number two, all the 60 and 70 year olds living in sevenbedroom houses that uh and indoor pools that don't need that anymore that want to downsize to a town home just because they don't want to maintain it all. Uh those are going to hit the market like nobody's business. So, we're going to see a ton of supply of existing homes, a ton of supply of new homes once we get that 30-year fix below six and once the option arm game ticks up and then a huge stimulus in the economy with the heliloc. And no one's really talking about option arms and no one's talking about helocks and no one's really talking about a 30-year fixed mortgage below 6%. Those thing three things are going to happen I'm going to say within the next six to 12 months and you are not going to believe what happens to the housing industry which by the way Trump talks about reshoring Trump talks about manufacturing. One of the best things we manufacture in America when we get the policy right is houses and it's 16% of GDP creates a ton of highpaying jobs it creates all the type of jobs that Trump wants to see and it's just getting started. So, if you don't have a Now, would I play the the homebuilders when the supply is going to be massively coming online and it's going to be a race to the bottom and incentives and price? No. I'd play the arms dealers, the building suppliers like Brad Jacobs, QXO, who just uh did their first acquisition. It's a roll up of building supplies uh of Beacon Roofing. He's going to be doing a lot of add-on and he's one of the greatest uh wealth creators for shareholders whether it was United Rentals, XPO, uh GXO, uh Waste Connections. He he's done it over and over for shareholders, made them billions upon billions of dollars and obviously made himself billions of dollars in the meantime. Uh the ancillary plays like Stanley Black & Decker is a housing play. Generrack is a housing play. play what's going to benefit from massive new supply of homes, not the ones producing it because they're going to have to they're going to be fighting on price and their margins are actually going to compress. >> Could you clarify from maybe me personally, maybe some of the audience member, what what what's HELOC? >> HELOC is a home equity line of credit. So, let's say you borrowed a million dollars on your house and uh in 2019, precoid it was worth 1.5 million. Well, unless you know you live in a really uh not ideal area, your house is now worth $3 million. Okay? And if you live in California, it's probably worth $5 million. Okay? And uh you have all of that equity, the difference between what you owe and what the house is worth trapped. Okay? It's phantom equity that was created because house prices went up due to some of the policies that were put in place during COVID. And um so you say, "Well, I can sell the house and if I sell the house for, let's call it $5 million and I owe $1 million, I get $4 million of profits, right? I pay off the loan." Or you can borrow against it when rates become attractive. So, if you can borrow against that $4 million of equity, maybe you don't have to move and you take $2 million out at five or 6% and now you can use that to start a business, to buy a car, to um, you know, buy a boat, to, you know, uh, spend as you like because now you can access that without actually selling the house and moving. I mean, this is a a big thing that we saw in the early 2000s. I think the governors the governors and the rails on this will be a lot more stringent than they were in the early 2000s so we don't wind up with another situation like that. But considering where household balance sheets are and the amount of untapped equity uh this is going to be massively stimulatory for coming years as uh as the Fed gets its policy normalized. >> Fantastic Tom. Really really great insights. I have maybe to end the conversation I got a couple rapid fire questions for you. just yes or no or higher or lower usually is what how we call the game. Uh probably should record a jingle or something for it, but um but by the end of the year um let's go through it. S&P 500 higher or lower? >> Um incrementally higher uh probably a little bit of uh bumpiness in you know September and October and results higher. >> Yeah, I should have started with the macro data but macro inflation higher or lower? um potentially a short-term bump and uh uh lower by the end of the year and certainly into the first quarter next year. A lot lower. unemployment rate >> higher >> higher uh dollar Dixie >> counter trend bounce lower over the the trend I can't tell you in the next three months but I can say over the next two years the dollar will be lower >> 10-year yield >> uh we're going to see a three handle at some point in the next six months I think it goes down to 375 at some point >> fantastic Tom that's all we time for it. Really appreciate you joining us. Like, where can we send our audience to follow more of your work? >> Uh, you know, we're pretty uh Tik Tok famous, official hedge fund tips. Uh, Twitter or Xedgefund Tips or just go to hedge funips.com, you'll find the podcast, you'll find contact uh everything is there. And YouTube, just put in hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes and you'll find everything. >> Fantastic, Tom. Really appreciate your time. It's great to catch up with you again and let's do that again soon. Uh we can't wait maybe before the end of the year we'll do a catchup episode just to recap the year and try to give a bit of an outlook of what we should be expecting in 2026. So thanks so much for joining us and uh everybody else thanks so much for tuning in to SOAR financially. Phenomenal episode. We dove a little deeper on Intel because it's a topic we haven't discussed much here on sore financially and also the national interest of the US investing into Intel and what the ramifications might be and whether it was necessary and Tom highlighted as well. It's an interesting investment opportunity. Curious if you think the same way let us know down below. And of course many other factors weighing on the economy right now as well. Friday will be key non-farm payrolls report coming out. So we'll be watching that very closely while we're on the road. And uh in the meantime, don't forget to hit that like and subscribe button. It helps us out tremendously. Helps with the nasty algorithm here on YouTube. So, thanks so much for that and we much much appreciate you. Thank you so much. Take care. [Music] And we're back. Uh then I want to thank Johan Cherion and Saiita Roy for having me in their Reuters article. And on to the quotes of the week. The big money is not in the buying or the selling but in the waiting. That's from Charlie Munger. We talk every so often about we are in the time arbitrage business. When you buy high quality businesses when they're temporarily impaired in price and you do it with low to no leverage, uh your time arbitrage is your advantage. you can be patient while you watch the fundamentals knowing that they're executing on the turnaround plan uh and uh not uh distracted by short-term voting machine, the emotional prices that you see on a day-to-day basis, but focused on the long-term weighing machine and knowing that it will get to you fully valued and knowing where you're getting out before you even get in. All wars are fought before the first shot is fired. And um and and that's that's the game we play here. And then Buffett uh compounding that those sentiments, look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy. Profit from folly rather than participate in it. This is critically important. Uh this is the uh basis of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes podcast and we try to re-emphasize that point on a weekly basis. Want to thank all of my incredible supporters of uh that which is you uh for listening in every week. Hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. You've made it the number one podcast in the hedge fund category. You can see that over at Feedspot. And we've stayed there for a long time and we're grateful and we don't take that for granted. Um and then also that's partially because you know quite a few of you um uh have become clients and we're very grateful for that. Um uh we had a client today that started with uh three or so and it and it moved uh it grew and and now they're upgrading to 50 and then 100 and and we're seeing that over and over and over and it's just growing because uh the value and the community and the results are the name of the game. Uh, so whether you're a 50 or a hundred million dollar client, a $5 million client, a $1 million client, which we're going to be opening in the next couple of weeks for the October 1st opening uh trade service, or you're just a loyal listener that uh is is growing your account, but every week you say, "You know what? I'm going to uh support this in the way that I can." And you share it with one friend or family member that you think could benefit that loves markets. That's the greatest compliment you can pay to us is sharing with your friends and family. And we put out this merch because people ask for it. But the merch is great because when you wear it, people ask you about it and that's helped to grow this. And as we continue to grow as we have been because of your generous sharing. Uh we're going to continue to do this for a very very long time. As long as we keep seeing growth, we're going to keep putting this out and we're going to keep growing. So, you know, you wear your hat, you you wear your mug, people ask you about it, please tell them, help them out, deliver the value, and these pictures. When you get your gear, take a picture, send it to info@hedgefundtips.com, and we'll get you up on the site. You know, all the pictures. We got a new one from father and son Cameron F and Don F. Uh they're out in Chicago. Great looking picture. You can go through those and uh we've had far more orders than we have had pictures. We've had a lot of pictures, but do send in your pictures. Let's get you up on the website. Now, down to business and data, which I love. Um, here is the chart of the day. This is from Funstrat uh Funst Strat's chart of the day. We're we're going to go through a lot of charts today uh as we do every week. Getting getting the data out and uh delivering as much value as we can and hopefully the shortest amount of time that we can. This shows when the cuts started in September 1998 and then you saw this year end surge into 1999. Similar to 2024 when they cut in September, you had come off the bottom. You were consolidating ahead of the meeting and then you had a year-end surge into 2025. Uh and and what he's trying to imply here is that as we get more cuts, we could see that type of year-end surge. Um I think it's a useful analog. I think that the surge is going to be more felt in individual names versus the quote unquote MAG7 index index aka S&P 500 which is why we underwrite each company. Uh it's basically private equity in the public markets. If we wouldn't buy 100% of the company with 100% of our net worth as the equity, you know, assuming JP Morgan would finance 100% of the debt for take private, uh why would we buy one share, which we wouldn't? So, that's how we underwrite it. And number two, how we underwrite uh buying a new a share of a business or a piece of ownership in the business um is if we were to offer to take the company private at the price it was quoted in the market to the board of directors, they would call security and have us escorted out of the building. That is critical. The answer must be yes. Okay. And if we had offered to take Alibaba private at $60 and change, the high, you know, 60s and 70s, uh, where we were just buying every share we could get under the sun to bring our basis down, which we ultimately did across the board down to $82, um, would they have us removed from the building by security? And the answer is of course they would because they were in the market buying shares handover fist which is what we like to see from management. And yes, it's doubled off the bottom. And uh if uh if if our analysis is correct, which we believe it will, it's got a chance to double again. So we're super duper excited about that one. Um and so on and so forth. similar with Cooper Standard now almost a it's like a seven to eight bagger and again uh we believe can double again and beyond. So pretty excited about that. Speaking of Cooper Standard, new car sales in 2025 uh are going up. So you can see in August 23 24 25 same thing in July the numbers continue to move in our favor despite the conservative industry estimates. Moving on Alibaba cloud year-on-year revenue growth. So what's important about this chart? You can see it was kind of anemic 2023 four and 5%. And now it's just started to go parabolic with the AI product revenue, the compute demand from 7% growth to 13% growth to 18% growth to 26% growth. This is exactly what the chart looks like for AWS, Amazon Web Services about six or seven years ago when the digitization of the US business was happening. China has always been five to six years behind in terms of basic cloud service digitization. Now you add the AI tailwind to that and the tripledigit growth of the AI products for eight consecutive quarters and you start to see something like this. This has been our core thesis since the beginning has been the cloud business now coupled with the AI business becoming the next AWS and Asia and we are now seeing this play out in real time. And if you go back and look at uh Amazon stock during this period, you can have a preview of coming attractions as it relates to Alibaba. Uh S&P price to sales ratio last 12 months. So look, it's trading at 3.25 sales compared to uh the 2000 peak when it was trading at, you know, 2.8 time sales. So it's elevated. It's related to a handful of 78 stocks which have started to come in a little bit. So keep your eye on that. If you're overweight S&P indexes or MAG7 exclusively, um the odds are not in your favor. Let's just put it that way. Doesn't mean it can't go to six times sales, but why would you play around risking that hoping you're not going to be the bag holder when you could buy businesses that have an enormous margin of safety that'll be doubles and triples over the next few years and you can sleep like a baby at night. Speaking of which, Shanghai Composite breaking out to a new 10-year high. That was on no one's bingo card coming into this year except those incredible, amazing viewers uh and supporters of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. You guys have been patient. You guys are being rewarded and it's early days. Chinese stocks versus US stocks uh outperformance year-to date. It's not even in the same ballpark. US market index versus China Morning Star China index uh outperformance by 34 some odd percent. Year to date S&P uh excuse me over a 12 month period from September of last year to September of this year. S&P 500 after 75% of stocks in three of four cyclical sectors exceeded the 200day moving average. Uh, this looks like a tech uh a technical analyst who's gone completely off the rails. I don't know what signal this gives you other than um a lot of green dots on a very long-term chart, but the uh the punchline is supposed to be that's bullish. And uh we generally agree with the constructive stance but tend to be more nuanced in where we're selecting uh and and willing to take uh put allocations and take uh concentrated wellressearched risk. Uh business and financial highlights total revenue. So, this excludes the two businesses that they sold, which we'll cover in the article of the week, which kind of skewed the headline numbers. The actual numbers, total revenue were up, was up 10% yearonear. That's unbelievable for that big of a business. The e-commerce was up 10%, the cloud intelligence was up 26% yearonear. Uh, Alibaba International up 19% yearonear. Uh, that's the e-commerce international business. Super exciting. China's monthly average turnover heads for record high. Uh estimates are exceedingly optimistic moving forward. They've continued to go up as we said in the first half year when they were taking them down. We said we'll get through this period when they take down and then they'll backend load and they're starting to go up next. 19 new all-time highs in 2025. Um, lot of room for to run there before the end of the year. Monthly return stats for S&P 500 1964 to 2024, obviously September historically has been the worst, but you've had periods where you're up 9% and down 12%. Um, so I think when you have such a big correction in the recent rear view mirror to expect another significant correction um is the wrong framework to to to think about. I think 3 to 5% pullback would be correct in the indices uh and in individual names we underwrite. It's funny. I had a client saying like, "Hey, I'm sending more money and is this the right time to put money to work?" I said, "It's never the right or perfect time to put work, but let's go through some of the things that we're going to put money to work in." You know, we're not buying Palunteer at a 100 times sales and when the market corrects, they're going to correct, you know, market corrects 3 to 5%, they correct 30 or 40%. We're buying businesses that are already trading with enormous margin of safety. So if anything actually goes right, i.e. you get a Fed cut and uh debt can be refinanced and all that stuff, these things can move up even if the market's weak. And there's so many things to put money to work to. like we were busier than one hour paper hangers this week and um uh and and and without any anxiety of putting money to work at the wrong time because we put money to work as it comes in in those opportunities that we believe are just leaving the station not already cruising at 30,000 ft. And there are a number of them to put massive amounts of money uh to work right now that are not going to be available in two or three or four months because they will have left the station. So uh very excited about that. In September, the S&P decline 56% of the time on average by 1.17%. Uh hedge funds exposure to cyclical versus defensive sectors is low versus history. Uh this is usually just a function of rates. This was the end of an easing cycle. The money went straight in from 11 to 2014. Um, and now that we're starting an easing cycle, expect similar results. China stocks best performing region year to date yet remain near lows versus China bonds. In other words, early days, ladies and gentlemen. GDP growth rate uh came in at 3.3% for Q2 2025. uh forward operating earnings per share estimates continue to go up, not down. Breath trades outperform with Fed rate cuts. So what does that mean? It means breath expands on the back of Fed cuts, which tomorrow's job report will confirm whether we're getting zero, 25, or 50 basis points of cuts in a couple of weeks. uh if the jobs report is very weak and or the unemployment rate rises it's 25 to 50% irrespective of inflation numbers pro uh coming coming in the short term uh if it meets or exceeds expectations the market will start to price uh 0 to 25 basis points in September but I think 25 is a pretty much foregone conclusion at this point after the Jackson Hole pivot markets are now expecting six cuts by 2026, followed by rate hikes from 2028. Um, interesting. Which would take the Fed funds rate down to 2.97 5-year arms on that basis. I mean, you could see 499 and housing will be booming. Uh this is critically important from uh I think this is from Cali Cox. Uh S&P 493 earnings growth is accelerating. Look at this guys. Look at MAG7 actual earnings growth in Q3 of 2023. It was the peak earnings growth of 56%. Then it dropped to 50. Then it dropped to 36. Then it dropped to 31. Then it dropped to 25. And this quarter, Q3 2025, it's looking like consensus is 13.5% and it will drop down to 10% by the first quarter of next year and stabilize in the low to mid teens. On the flip side, the unmnificent 493 are, you know, were negative uh sick 10% in 2023. Then they bumped up uh slowly to single digits. 4.7% this quarter will move up to 10% by Q2 of next year, 14% by the back half of next year. And the multiple is dramatically lower. Accelerating earnings growth, decelerating earnings growth. One is trading at twice the multiple of the other. You want to go for accelerating at half the multiple. Uh here is consumer staples versus the S&P 500. Looks like it's it's all-time lows. I think there's ponies in this pile. This chart is being used as a way to say the economy is good. Discretionary versus staples is uh breaking out. I I think they can actually both do well. I think there's enough opportunity in Staples defensives that a couple of them are going to start to work. uh and consumer discretionary which no one wanted uh just a couple of months ago has begun to work and will continue to see follow through. I think also that's a function of as I referenced um I think it was last week with um $35 trillion of untapped equity in people's homes as rates come down will be accessed through HELOCs refinancing high interest debt in credit cards at lower rates through HELOCs etc. Um this shows bull markets percentage change and trading days. As you can see we are still on the a very low uh amount of percentage returns for this current bull market as well as days um duration in this bull market i.e. earlier days than most people think. Chinese equities and emerging market equities are starting to see a lot of flows. Opinion follows trend. Uh long short gross net leverage uh is kind of subdued net leverage still. They're behind the benchmark. This is why that they've continued to buy every dip. Long short ratio, same story. Industrials is the most overweight versus history. Energy is the most underweight versus history. So industrials have led the year. If you were on the podcast last year, you know that's what we were pounding the table on. Um I think energy again we love commto stock albeit our initial basis is much lower um towards the eights and nines but uh we we were able to confidently put some new money to work at these levels recently uh on the pullback. We like that. We like national oil well varco and that's kind of enough energy exposure without getting such sensitivity to the price of a barrel of crude funds exposure to cheap stocks within the index is well below average. This is where the opportunity is and we are taking full advantage. Uh 70% of funds own each mag seven stock XTesla. Talk about a crowded trade. These people are going to get shellacked on a relative basis. The average non-MAG7 stock is more than 20% underweight and held by just 12% of funds. There's your opportunity. And I can't emphasize this enough, ladies and gentlemen. When easing begins, dividend paying stocks, high dividend yield is still cheap and under underowned. This is the lowest valuation of dividend paying stocks that we've seen since 2001. And there you had the easing cycle begin and they just went parabolic for the next halfozen years. I think we're going to see the same thing. Dividend yield is neglected by active managers. Um massive underweight. So that starts to favor the value stocks along the Stanley Black & Deckers uh and many of the other stocks we've discussed and owned over the last year. Active investors have moved closer to the benchmark since early 2023. They're all crowded into the same stocks. They're all screwed. Generational wealth happens over decades, not months or even years. I love this chart. Uh Warren Buffett's net worth by age, 90% came after age 65. Um and if you go back and look at his net worth in the 40s, uh age 40s, it was only like $25 million by the way, 25, 30, then it jumped up to 40, which I mean in those in those years dollars was a lot of money. Um, but if you think about the ability to compound money, and he added to that the ability to control massive amounts of capital, this is where it all happens. It's a snowball. If you read his book, The Snowball, it's it's insane. So, you know, if you're 33 and you're only worth a couple million bucks, have no fear. By by the time you're in your 40s, you could be worth, you know, 15, 20, 25, 30. And then uh if you keep working, which will be a temptation for you not to, but if you keep compounding and and follow proven principles, uh maybe you too can can have some type of serious compounding outcomes. The other catch is you got to live to age 95 to do it. Uh healthcare and biotech share of equity fund sector assets. Uh we got to do more here and we will do more here. um these type of opportunities just don't exist that often. So um we need more exposure to healthcare. We have the exposure to biotech. We have some exposure to healthcare. I mean in an 8 to12 position I guess two positions is enough but I keep I keep digging under the rocks to find the next best opportunities. Pharma, Biotech, and Life Sciences earnings revision. Breath is growing. S&P performance following 100day rallies of 25%. 3 months later, it's still up another 6% on average. That kind of shows you. Look at the short interest in energy. Uh these people are going to get shellacked at some point. I love this. Uh that's from uh Allstar Charts, I guess. average size of new single family homes sold. So, if you recall, I've been saying not every 30s something year old starter home needs to have an indoor pool in a movie theater. They don't need to be 6,000 7,000 square ft. And sure enough, we are getting back to and I said, "Think Levittown. We're going to get massive supply of smaller homes." That is starting to happen. The average square footage has dropped now 15% in the last 9 years. The precise relationship is that every 1% increase in total vehicles sold is associated with a statistically significant 1.2% increase in domestic production. This is going millions of units annual data from 1968 to 2024. That's a good find. from Jeff. Chart of the day. Equities resilient over summer. We got that from Raymond James. New vehicle sales recovery will take beyond 2025. This from Morning Star. So dealers have good growth runway. This is music to my ears. Look at this chart, ladies and gentlemen. This is Morning Star projecting at 20 2.5 million units. US light vehicle inventory is now not back to where it will likely settle after the pandemic. Low inventory along with leasing still below 2019 levels. That's a function of rates which is changing this month. Gives reason to think new vehicle sales will rise in the next few years years. Many consumers who bought in 2020 to 2023 during poor availability may not have purchased the exact vehicle they wanted. So they could return to the market early. Still much higher interest rates than in recent years and high prices are holding consumers back. That's coming down through incentives and lower rates. But take a look at this ladies and gentlemen. They've got 15.8 for this year, 16.1 for next year. That's going to be huge cash flow positive in earnings for Cooper and enable them to refinance which is going to add more earnings. Then 166 in 2027 almost 17 at 2028. At 17 these guys are going to earn so much money 89 $10 plus uh per share and then apply whatever multiple 10 20 times. Super exciting. Hybrid gaining share in 2025. This is key. It's gone from 2% 14 years ago to 12.4%. Remember, their cost per vehicle almost doubles over internal combustion when you add hybrids. That's Cooper Standard. Musling into Europe's car market, Chinese brands. China's onshore streak of in streak of in outflows. So, China's onshore stock ETFs end streak of outflows. They've been negative for months and months and now turning positive. revenue and EPS surprises versus misses. So you had 391 revenue and 407 EPS positive surprises in the S&P 500 with 90% reporting. This just shows the divergence between growth and value in the zer period. This is going to reverse aggressively and abruptly and uh we're excited to see to see that Russell 2000 on the verge of a breakout here. Large speculators uh net position they're super short. This is breaking out. We love to see that. dollar cycle. Stocks rise when Fed cuts rates outside recessions. You don't get recessions with 3.3% GDP. So, expect to see stocks rise. Here's the period that we are stuck in right now. Maybe a bump up in September, little weakness in early October, and then year- end rally. This was one of the best 100 day rallies ever since 1928. That's from Carson. And for those of you who've been around, you know, on April 7th, we did that special call for clients and a lot of them took massive advantage of and uh even the ones that didn't uh benefited because we were buying everything we could uh using a little margin in the hole to to take advantage. So, uh, next, a really good August is worry in September. Average down 2.3%. Okay, no big deal. Uh, AI investment in consumer spending contributions to GDP. AI is going up, consumption was going down. Okay. Summer deal summer deal hall is highest since record-breaking 2021. This game is just getting started. Annual earnings growth for hyperscalers. This is unreal, guys. uh Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, Oracle again 45% in 2023. Uh consensus for next year around 10%. Breath is starting to expand. That's positive. Uh extreme bullishness, we're not quite there to the top of the band. So again, okay, China allocations in active funds globally at the peak when the market peaked was 15%. Uh now it's down to 6.5% which is a low we haven't seen in decades. This is the 15th percentile. So as price continues to go up, opinion will follow a trend and you will see panic buying into Chinese equities among the biggest weight being Ali as we like to say effing baba. uh downside risk to non-farm payrolls over the coming months that will keep the Fed in the game. Seasonal composite for the four-year election cycle. This is really interesting. So far, it's followed. This is post-election year is a good year. Uh midterm election year tends to be sideways choppy. This means the indices do poorly next year and under the surface is where the money is made and then after the election everything goes up. So, we will be positioned all along the way. uh CTA positioning in US equities. They were in the hole in April. Now they've been chasing up. But if you look back, they have after they chase up, the market tends to continue to go up for some time. MSCI World excluding US stock price index divided by S&P stock price index versus trade weighted dollar. All this says in English from Jim Paulson, who's one of the best, is that weaker dollar equals stronger international performance. A theme that we've been pounding the table on for over a year plus. Historically, a symmetry in declines and recoveries. So, here's where we are. Long way to run. Investment grade credit spreads well below 100 basis points which which speaks to long runway for equities as long as credit spreads stay subdued. Realize correlations have dropped which is good for stock pickers. Cyclicals versus defensive flows. We got that net buying of small caps starting to go through the roof. Second largest ever buying of small caps since uh for over a decade and a half. Good to see. US job gains have slowed marketkedly in recent months. This is key. This is what the Fed's looking at and finally waking up to. Chinese stocks and yuan moved in tandem so far this year. Go back a year ago when we said that the key indicator is going to be stronger yuan. And here's what we have happening in concert. A big summer rally is usually bullish. Rest of year average up another two and a half%. Our estimate of underlying job growth has plummeted. I think that's Goldman Sachs. Yep. Uh medium age of owner occupied housing now is 40 years old. It's gone up dramatically. Compliments of the Fed, but maybe they're get they're getting it back now. Mortgage applications for refinancing anemic. This is going to go straight up in the next two years. Um job openings versus unemployed persons. That's now converging again. Small caps ready to break out. Transports ready to break out. China margin trades surged to record high. Game is on. Average loan rate slowly declining from 25-year highs. Like to see that. And GDP now estimate at 3% for Q3. Home ownership rate is subdued. That's going to change shortly. And that's that lot of data this week. Holy cow. Good job. Uh, okay. Alibaba. Now, some news. Uh, Alibaba creates AI chip to help China fill the Nvidia void. What did they think would happen with the stupid embargo? We took them from being dependent to now being independent by necessity. And uh that's going to prove to be a very bad decision over time, but good if we own Alibaba stock. Alibaba's AI revenue surge triggers $50 billion stock rally, eighth consecutive quarter of tripledigit revenue growth for AI related products. A 23 trillion cash pile holds the key for Chinese stocks. Bull run. Alibaba stock gets a boost. Wall Street sees an AI winner. Notice the lady who wrote 132 negative consecutive articles on Alibaba and China while the stock was between $60 and $80 is nowhere to be found now that it has doubled. Z has no choice but to love Chinese stocks. Why? Equity returns will likely be the key to fund retirement in an aging society. So he has to juice the market to avoid unrest. China stock and yuan rally spurs hopes of virtuous feedback loop. Early days, ladies and gentlemen. Goldman's top Asia banker says China stock rally has room to run. These are all the same schmucks who told you that they were uninvestable at $60 and $70. New York. Oh, uh, China's EV deliveries rebound, buoied by cheaper new models. Uh, Japan, US near deal to bring lower auto tariffs into effect. Uh, car industry calls for EU to copy China and include hybrids in E emissions push. That will be good. Hybrids are good for Cooper Standard. Uh, EVs are second best. ICEs are third best. Our whole model when we got into it was based on IC's which is the lowest cost per vehicle. So all of this has been whipped cream and we're seeing it reflected in the price of the stock. EV deals are booming ahead of tax credit expiration. Trump weighs declaring national housing emergency. Bessant says that is interesting because that will enable him to open massive federal lands. Uh, and by the time they sue him to stop it, the home builders will have already built all the homes. Uh, and they're also, uh, looking at this, which was really interesting, how the Trump administration could lower mortgage rates and bypass the Treasury market entirely. Um, don't count that possibility out. That would be mind-boggling. A weak August jobs report will tee up the Fed to reduce interest rates. A worse one may spur even more cuts. Economists expect another tepid US jobs report supporting rate cut. Fed Governor Waller eyes multiple rate cuts. Other officials are less certain. Aka frontr runner for Fed share. Equal weight S&P 500 sees longest winning streak since 2021. A midseptember rate cut expectations. Companies reap cash savings from Trump's new tax law. Healthc care stocks are priced at panic levels. It's time to buy. We agree. We have exposure. We want to find even more. Small cap stocks are rallying again. This time it's real. I love it. And article of the week, the capitulation rally, stock market and sentiment results. Each week we try to cover one to two companies we've discussed in previous video casts uh and or own for clients including personally. So here we go. Alibaba reported what we could call the greatest earnings miss of all time last week with topline revenues of 34.5 billion up 2% yearon-year falling 910 million short and adjusted EPS of 2.06 06 coming in 10 cents less than expected. However, to call this corner a miss is extremely misleading. Topline revenue estimates didn't fully account for the $ 1.7 billion sale of supermarket Sun Art and $1 billion sale of department store in time. Two perpetual loss generating brickandmortar businesses that we were offloaded but included in last year's quarterly numbers. Excluding those, Alibaba delivered 10% revenue growth for the quarter. the fastest growth in two years. Looking at the bottom line, increased investment in instant commerce continued to pressure margins down 14% year-onear as management maintained its pledge of $7 billion in subsidies and investments. Excluding those instant commerce investments, China e-commerce and overall IBIDA both expanded year-on-year. For those worried about headline numbers miss, may we offer you the world's smallest violin. In reality, we viewed this quarter as a validation of our core thesis, which has always been that Alibaba is number one, a proxy for Chinese AI, and two, the toll taker of the middle class recovery and pivot toward consumption. Both growth engines were on full display. Cloud revenue accelerated to its fastest clip in over 3 years, up 26% year-over-year to 4.66 66 billion with all signs pointing to a 30% growth on the horizon and continued expansion on top of Alibaba's 40% leading market share. At the same time, AI related product revenue posted tripledigit revenue growth for the eighth straight quarter. China e-commerce accelerated 10% topline growth to 19.55 billion with customer management revenues expected to continue accelerating on their double-digit clip. and 88 VIP members, posting double-digit growth to 53 million members. Meanwhile, Alibaba has already reached industry-leading scale and market share within four months of launching Tao Instant Commerce with monthly customers reaching 300 million and daily orders peaking at 120 million. All with the long-term expectation of delivering 140 billion of incremental e-commerce gross merchandise value within three years. On top of that, Alibaba International Commerce posted 19% growth to 4.85 billion and 98% year-on-year improvement in adjusted IBIDA to a loss of just 8 million as the segment eyes its first ever quarter of profitability expected in the next earnings report. So, while headlines fixate on an earnings miss, the reality of this quarter is that the growth engines were as long-term shareholders care about. AI, cloud, e-commerce, and international are all shooting the lights out. The best part about all of this is that despite what feels like a big move by doubling off the lows, we continue to believe the train has only started to leave the station. These strengthening fundamentals are only in the early innings of reaceleration. And as we like to say, you can only hold the beach ball underwater for so long. The game is on. Meanwhile, we continue to hear about how the rally in Chinese equities is liquiditydriven and lack strengthening fundamentals. While cash certainly does make bull markets, in the case of Alibaba, writing off this rally as lacking fundamentals is just flatout wrong. That's not to say that the return of domestic flows isn't a big deal. It certainly is. There are over $23 trillion of household bank deposits in mainland China sitting on the sidelines, 7 trillion of which is excess savings and considered above trend, beginning to pile into equity markets. Domestic flows have been a key catalyst and something that has been on our radar since Alibaba's inclusion in the southbound connect last year. A move that gave over 200 million mainland investors access to the Amazon of China for the first time with analysts forecasting over $20 billion of potential flows. Flows via the Southbound Stock Connect continue to show strength and room for further upside with total ownership through the program at 8.68% 68% of Alibaba shares outstanding compared to 11% for 10 cent and 14% for Xiaomi. But really, this is only part of the story. What's not being talked about enough and why we call this the most hated rally is just how few global investors actually own it. Coming into this year, positioning was near historical lows after 2024 marked not only the third straight year of net outflows from China, but also the highest ever recorded outflows of foreign direct investment. I love it. Selling in the hole. They are going to be chasing when Alibaba's 250 and 300. Perhaps the most striking stat that highlights how ignored China despite being the second largest economy in the world continues to be is the MCI allc country world index which is which has 64.43% exposure to the US aka MAG7 versus a mere 3.15% to China. that quote uninvestable narrative surrounding Chinese equities left many managers structurally underweight even as valuations reached generational lows. We were happy to take the other side of that trade and have been pounding the table for years. We may have been a little early, but so far that contrarian bet has paid off well. The hang sang has surged 27% year-to date, more than 3.2 times the S&P 500's gain. Meanwhile, managers have missed nearly all of that rally with global equity flows year-to- date still an outflow of nearly 11 billion. While we are just starting to see headlines of foreign flows returning in recent weeks, overall allocations have barely even come off the mat. Allocations remain at just 6.5% in the 15th overall percentile and well below the 15% we saw when China was all anyone wanted to talk about just a few years ago. Look at this. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. Missed the entire rally. China allocations in active funds globally. You can't make this up. Even with this recent move in Alibaba, the stock still trades at just 17 times earnings with analysts now pricing in 31.2% earnings growth for next year. So listen to this. Mag 7 trades 33 times earnings with growth decelerating to 10%. Alibaba trades at 17 times and I don't even know if that number is right. It might be less than that. 17 times earnings with analyst pricing in 31% earnings growth. So triple the earnings growth for half the multiple and accelerating earnings growth. Um, investors can't find that sort of value in any country not called China. And the fact of the matter is that money eventually finds its way to where it's treated best. Matters can managers can only ignore clear value for so long until it hits them over the head. That's why we expect the next leg of the rally will likely be fueled by foreign capital capitulating into a market they spent years avoiding and on the backs of underweight managers trying to keep their jobs. The uninvestable narrative has already been proven wrong. And every day that prices climb higher, the cost of staying underweight grows. As we say, the cherry on top will be the long- aaited Trump Xi handshake, which will serve as a green light, not just for a return of foreign flows, but in our view, the start of Chinese equity euphoria. When everyone finally embraces the trade we've been building for years, that is when we will rotate out searching for the next uninvestable opportunity. Until then, here's everything you need to know about Alibaba's Q1 earnings. We've gone through it, underlined, highlighted, starred, the most important points. 10 key points. The cloud segment posted its fastest growth in over 3 years, 26%. IBIDA also rose 26% to 412 million, 8.8% margin. Management expects continued acceleration over the next few quarters with all signs pointing to 30% plus topline growth as Alibaba extends its lead as China's number one cloud infrastructure provider holding and expanded 40 expanding 40% market share. Number two, AI related product revenue posted tripledigit growth for the eighth consecutive quarter, now making it more than 20% of the cloud segment's external revenue. This proves that growth is not simply due to a small base and that Alibaba's AI investments are delivering tangible results. Its upgraded Quen models remain among the world's top performing large language models and continue to gain traction overseas. Reports also suggest Alibaba is working on a new AI chip to rival Nvidia's lineup, potentially outperforming the H20, further strengthening its position as China's top full stack AI and cloud leader. Three, Alibaba's newly organized China e-commerce group, which includes Tao, T-Mo, Elme, Fleigley reported 10% year-on-year revenue growth to 19.55 billion. Adjusted EBA fell 21% year-on-year to 5.36 billion as heavier investments in instant commerce weighed on near-term profitability. Though excluding these investments, profitability would have improved year-on-year. Management is already seeing strong synergies from instant commerce with Tao app monthly active users rising 25% and daily orders hitting record levels record levels customer management revenue increased 10% supported by last year's 6% software service fee and stronger advertising demand as traffic expanded CMR growth is expected to sustain double-digit increases in coming quarters another key driver was continued doubledigit growth in 88 VIP memberships Alibaba's highest spending customers and its equivalent of Amazon Prime now exceeding 53 million members. Four, Tao Instant Commerce launched at the end of April drove a 12% year-on-year increase in quick e-commerce revenue to $2 billion. Alibaba now serves 300 million monthly customers up 200% from the pre-launch levels with daily orders peaking at 120 million, averaging 80 million and active riders increasing to 2 million. Scale was the company's first goal and results have already exceeded management expectations as Alibaba now leads in both food delivery to home orders and merchant supply. The next step is efficiency with management aiming to reduce unit economic losses by half over the next two months while holding 80 million daily orders with the long-term goal of achieving industryleading margins. Most importantly, Instant Commerce is expected to deliver $140 billion in incremental gross merchandise value annually within 3 years, representing an 11% increase in traditional e-commerce GMV. AIDC, Alibaba International Commerce, delivered 19% year-on-year revenue growth, reaching 4.85 billion. Management's top priority remains improving operating efficiency, resulting in a 98% year-on-year improvement in adjusted EBID to a loss of just 8 million, all while sustaining growth. management believes profitability will continue to improve with all signs pointing to AITC reporting its first ever profitable quarter and upcoming earnings report as the company works towards profitability at scale for one of its largest business segments. Six as expected free cash flow was an outflow of 2.63 billion as management continues to invest 53 billion over the next three years in AI and cloud infrastructure and 7 billion in instant commerce driving quarterly capex to move to more than three times last year's le level. Uh, I'm actually a proponent of this. I I think that when the stock was at 60 to 80, they were doing what they needed to do, which was buy every effing share available on the public markets and taking in the float. And now, because you can't you couldn't get a better return on capital than that. And now that the stock price has doubled, the best return on, you know, if you look at um you know, if you look at, you know, what was a six six or seven times multiple and the earnings yield, which is, you know, one divided by seven versus now at 17 times, the return they can get investing that capital in the business versus buying in shares is greater, which is ultimately going to help the share price more than buying in stock at this level. Um, and they're doing the exact perfect thing with capital allocation. Super happy to see um management repurchased 7 million ads during the quarter for 815 million at an average price of 116. Buyback dry powder remains significant at 19.3 billion. While this reflects a material slowdown, unlike many Western companies that often erode shareholder value, Alibaba's management actually considers share price when executing repurchases as long-term shareholders. This is exactly what we want to see. Eight, Alibaba ended the quarter with cash and other liquid investments of 81.7 billion. A net cash position just under 50 billion representing 15% of its current market cap. The strong net cash position serves as backdrop and gives us all the confidence we need as management ramps up capex over the next few years. Nine, the total stockbased compensation, which Alibaba used to hand out like candy. Total just 495 million during the quarter, down 14% year-on-year. Management has shifted toward a higher portion of long-term cash incentives, a change we have long preferred. 10. Revenue from the other segments fell 28% year-onear primarily reflecting the sale of Sun Art and in time included in last year's results for Shipo, Alibaba Health and AAP all posted revenue gains and improved operating results with management targeting break even for these loss making segments within one to two years. Okay, that's the note. You can read the key points of the transcript. onto Disney. Look at this. Record free cash flow for Disney. Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen. I love it. I love it. I love it. So, um, and share counting to come down. All right, let's go through the key points from Disney. Yes, it's come up a lot lot off the bottom and no, it's nowhere near done with its move. 10 key points. Revenue was 23.6 billion, up 2% year-on-year, just shy of consensus. Adjusted EPS crushed expectations at 1.61, well above the 1.45, up 16% year-on-year earnings growth. Awesome. Two, direct to consumer delivered another strong corner, rising 6% year-on-year to 6.18 billion. Adjusting for the prior year inclusion of Disney Plus, Hot Star streaming revenue would have grown 9%. Most importantly, profitability continues to improve with operating income reaching 346 million, 5.6% EBIT margin compared to 19 million loss last year. The strength led management to raise its fullear operating income target for the segment to 1.3 billion from 1 billion implying at least 325 million in Q4 operating income. The long-term goal remains achieving doubledigit direct to consumer margins with f further upside expected once that milestone is launched. Domestic parks, Disney's breadandbut business and the company's largest EBIT contributor 36% of total continues to shine. The segment delivered 6.4 4 billion in revenue, up 10% year-on-year, and 1.7 billion in operating income, up 22% year-on-year, despite concerns over increased competition. Following the opening of Epic Universe in May, Walt Disney World just posted its largest Q3 revenues ever. Per capita spending rose 8% year-on-year, the highest growth rate in over two years, supported by strong attendance. management raised fullear experiences operating income growth guidance to 8% the high end of the prior range positioning the business to exit the year at record high EBIT growth levels four Disney delivered strong results across its film slate with Lilo or Lilo and Stitch surpassing $1 billion at global box office making marking Disney's fourth billion dollar film in just over a year the film is now the second largest merchandise franchise ever behind only Mickey Mouse with merchandise revenue up more than 70% year-over-year year and a sequel already in development. Management reins confident in the upcoming slate for 2025 and 2026 which includes Zootopia 2, Avatar Fire and Ash, Star Wars Mandalorian and Grou, Toy Story 5, a liveaction Moana and Avengers Doomsday. Disney is back to doing what it does best, creating blockbuster hits. Five Disney's cruise division continues to perform exceptionally well with recent launch of Disney Treasure off to a strong start. Two additional ships are set to de debut this year, expanding the fleet to eight. Occupancy rates and forward bookings remain strong with 2026 already more than halfway booked and newer ships performing even better. This high margin segment remains a key driver of management multi-year double-digit earnings growth outlook through 2027. Six, management continues to execute on its turbocharged investment in experiences with 30 billion committed to domestic parks and the largest wave of global expansions in Disney's history. Year-to- date capex has climbed to 6.1 billion, up from 3.9 billion at this point last year. Most importantly, returns on invested capital for the segment remain highly attractive and reached record highs as of Q27. Year-to- date free cash flow stands at 7.52 billion, up nearly three billion from the LA same time last year, pushing trailing 12 month free cash flow to a record 11.5 billion. Operating cash flow reached 13.63 billion year to date with management reiterating fullear guidance of 17 billion raised from the initial 15 billion at the start of the year. Looking ahead, management expects to see positive cash tax benefits from the one big beautiful bill, providing another boost to cash flow heading into 2026.8. Disney officially launched its long- aaited direct to consumer ESPN offering, giving fans direct access to ESPN's full suite of networks and services for the first time. Alongside the launch, management announced a non-binding agreement with the NFL to acquire NFL Network and other media assets in exchange for a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Bob Iger called the deal one of the most important steps ESPN has taken since 1987. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the next calendar year and is projected to be 5 cents accretive before purchase accounting in its first full year post close. 9 management once raised once again raised fullear guidance. Now expecting adjusted EPDS of 5.85 for the full year, $585 above prior 5.75 and consensus 5.77. This reflects an 18% year-on-year earnings growth, effectively doubling management's initial fullear outlook of high singledigit growth. Most importantly, the company's three-year target of sustaining doubledigit earnings growth through 2027 remains firmly intact. 10 subscriber growth remains solid with total Disney Plus and Hulu subscriptions reaching 183 million, up 2.6 million sequentially looking ahead to Q4. Management expects over 10 million net subscriber additions driven primarily by Hulu following the expanded Charter distribution deal. So, you can go through the earnings call for the top things to pay attention to. We've highlighted it for you. Uh, fear and greed, elevated, not extreme. National Association of Active Investment Managers, uh, backing off a little bit. Uh, top 30 weights of consumer discretionary sector earnings revisions last 60 days were up next year, uh, by 79 basis points or, uh, 8/10en of 1%. Consumer staples for next year down 35 basis points, top 30 weights in the last 60 days. Uh consensus for tomorrow is uh 75,000 jobs added and an increase to 4.3% unemployment rate. Okay, with that said, let's move on to the ask me anything questions. Those of you who um like those, stick around. Those of you uh for who uh prefer just the podcast, thank you for tuning in. We'll be back next week, same time, same place. Uh first question, first off, I just want to read this from um Cameron and Don. You saw their pictures on the website. They sent in the hat. They said they've been loyal listeners for the p of the podcast for the last three years with much success. Thank you so much for that. We watch the podcast every Thursday and review it with each other on Friday. Recommend it to all our family and friends. Thank you so much for that. That means a lot. Appreciate all the analysis and that work that goes into these podcasts. We both have had much success on the value stock recommendations and it's a nice alternative to all the tech stock picks that are so popular right now. If you if you're ever in Chicago and want to get in around a golf at one of the top clubs, hit me up. Uh you can count on that. If I'm in Chicago, I'll be hitting you up for that. Uh thank you so much. Next, Albert Ruddle Tom, I voted for your daughter for athlete of the year. Thank you, Albert. Please vote again and please tell your friends. Uh I hope you'll share the good news to all of us if she wins. Quick question on Etsy. It hit a 52- week high on August 13th and has fallen. I'm looking to add more. Uh not sure why the large drop. Think it's because of the uh dimminimus exemption, but thought the majority of sales are domestic, not foreign. Thanks in advance for my question. Uh look forward to seeing you at the money show in Sarasota in December. Fantastic. I'll see you there. Um same thing. We're we're buying a ton of Etsy this week. It it is I think related to the Dominus but as we had shared in the past uh and to your point short-term voting machine based on emotion long-term weighing machine based on fundamentals so no issues there just created huge opportunity for us on Tuesday and throughout the week. Uh Hank Douglas appreciate the constant wisdom and your willingness to share idea thoughts on the market. Uh I take every opportunity to spread the good word. Thank you very much. Share it with friends and family. I was wondering if you take a look at Fubo TV. I'd be happy to. We've looked at this one a few times. I love the product. I use the product. Uh I just I just think it's a tough business. Um let's take a look. So Fubo TV, uh for those of you who don't know, is like a competitor to YouTube TV. I mean, it looks like it's turning the corner a little bit. If I'm not mistaken, the balance sheet was a disaster, though. I am mistaken. Balance sheets fine. Um, yeah, this is the thing that I have problem with. I mean, what is wrong with these human beings that they've increased the share count from 4.5 million 7 years ago to 319 million shares? It's like every time they do better, revenues go up and all this stuff. They double the share count and these are uh complete animals that I want nothing to do with in terms of business. Like you're destroying your shareholders, your pigs and um you deserve to die. Other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln? So, on to the next. But I do agree with your analysis of the product and the fundamentals, but they're pigs. They're they're absolutely fiscally financially reckless. They have no respect for owners and uh therefore they're dead to me. But um next next week I'm going to tell you how I really feel about it. Uh let's see. We covered that. Rick Richard, uh what about Cava? What about Cava? I get a lot of questions on cava. I eat cava when I'm in the city. And I will just say that uh history is littered with a bunch of dead salad sellers. And whether it's Chopped or uh multitude of others, they just never seem to work out because Americans like cheeseburgers. They've always have. They always will. It's never going to change. and Cava although it's in the early days of its growth story price is what you pay value is what you get and uh for this you know you've got an enterprise value of 7 billion and and an IBIDA of 125 million so 56 times IBIDA give or I I I'm I'm just cuffing that right now but I It's it's not ideal. So I think that I think the play here is you have to break down the store unit economics. So, okay, enterprise value to ibida 41 times, but it's a growth story and they're expanding. Um, yeah, this one is tough one. I hate guessing about the future. And I also hate the fact that they started out and they wouldn't do steak because they wanted to have like this falafel Everyone loves steak. Everyone loves steak. Everyone loves cheeseburgers. Chicken, third choice. Um, they should probably add shrimp, by the way. But there's a lot of places you can get salads. And people like Mediterranean, but they don't like it every day. Like Chipotle, the beauty of Chipotle was people would eat that a few times a week. You're not gonna eat cava a few times a week. The other one that's uh sucking wind is sweet green. Um let's just see here. Cava, it's not even doing a billion in revenues. Is that right? Huh? All right. share count from a million to 114 million in two years. 118 million diluted. I understand that during a growth story, but I don't know where that's going to end. So, I hope these are not a bunch of pigs like the Fubo people that are going to destroy huge value for owners. I don't get that sense. Let's look at free cash flow here. See, this is, you know, it's turning in the right direction. The problem with this is it's speculative and you want to say this is the next Chipotle and I want to say salad never really works. It's never really durable. Name one franchise that sells salad that's worked and it's too nichy to be large scale. Like Mexican is large scale. Burgers are large scale. Pizza is large scale. Mediterranean healthy small scale. And um I mean all right so look it's got a $70 billion enterprise value. I'm sorry 7 billion. Where the hell is this? All right, 7.6 billion enterprise value on 125 million of IBIDA. Let's take a look at CMG, which you're all praying and hoping that it becomes like they have a 58 billion enterprise value. So, call it eight times the enterprise value. But they have IBIDA of 2.34 billion. So they have give or take 20 times the IBIDA and only eight times the enterprise value. uh albeit the growth trajectory rate is slower, but I'm willing to bet that they're not destroying the share count at Chipotle the way that they are at Cava. They're actually taking the share count down. So, Chipotle, I mean, if you look, it's not going to become a $60 billion enterprise business because not that many people like Middle Eastern salad, okay? Or Mediterranean salad, but they have all this weird flavors. I like it. I like it once a month, maybe twice a month. Chipotle I could eat once a week. I don't, but I could. Uh, so it's not going to become a $60 billion enterprise business. If you're lucky, if you're absolutely lucky, it becomes a 20 20 billion enterprise business. But it has to grow so much relative to where it is to grow into that. And I think you're giving too much credit from where it is to where it's going. And for that reason, I'm out on to the next. But I I was happy to go through that mental exercise with you because I do keep looking at Cava and I do keep passing on it and now I understand why. Jordan proccous thoughts on OPY. I hope. All right. Well, first of all, welcome to the podcast, Jordan. Uh, I can tell you are new, but uh I will take a look at your offering here. Uh, I was good friends with the guy who started Oenheimer Capital. Um, [Music] Chuck Bernie, brilliant guy, smart guy, passed away, was a big supporter of the Manhattan Institute, New York Post, a lot of good good things. was a member of Mont Pellerin Society, Milton Freriedman. He managed money for Milton Freriedman, managed money for Alan Greenspan, if you can imagine. How cool is that? anyway and was married to good friend Betsy McCoy, former Lieutenant Governor of New York. And they came to our wedding and danced in our living room for the wedding party in Connecticut, which was amazing. All right, on to the next. Uh, let's take a look here. Oppenheimer. So, Oenheimer's growing revenues again. Deal business is back on. Free cash flow. It's negative. Why is that? Balance sheet looks great. Middle Market investment bank brokerage planning financial mutual fund accounts. Yeah. Um, I don't have a great answer for you, but I'm just not a buyer of this business. Um, I'll put it simply that is the CEO about us. Robert Loenthal. [Music] Rob serves as a co-head of investment banking. Okay. So, I'm sure Rob is a great guy and he's running a great business and he's, you know, generating good earnings. The problem is I will never ever buy a business that's run by an investment banker. And the reason is is the mentality of an investment banker is very transactionoriented. It's it's not long-term valueoriented. Okay. And as a matter of fact, just see something here. [Music] Yeah, they've kept the share count pretty reasonable. Look, um I think this could be the exception to my rule, but I'm not willing to bet against it because more often than not, I'm right. Um, so I see your analysis. I understand why you're thinking the way that you're thinking. I would not be a buyer of this stock at these levels. Carl Johnson, thanks for a great podcast. Keep up the great work. Already recommended to several friends. Thank you very much. What do you think about TTEC Holdings? [Music] Wow. [Music] Okay. So, the first thing we want to do with this is check for solveny risk. Revenues are down a lot off the uh COVID peaks. Cash flow is negative. Got 85 million of cash and about a billion dollars of debt. Not great. Revenues are declining. Share count steady. What do they do? [Music] Customer [Music] experience company that designs, builds and operates technology enabled consumer experiences across digital live interaction channels. customer service CRM artificial intelligence data driven omni channel customer care it's a lot of words I still don't know what the hell they do proving every process journey and every outcome. What the hell does that mean? If I can figure out what the hell they do, uh, I might be interested in the stock. But for now, I literally cannot. Um, paying down debt. Yeah. The problem with these technology businesses, you really have to understand if they've been disintermediated because the moes are so narrow in the tech business subscale. But I do think this one warrants some serious analysis. So start um I think it's extremely speculative. Um but I'm going to I'm going to put it on the list to uh do some work on for sure. Stephen Gualtieri, thank you for all your great content. How the expiration diminish affect Etsy? We covered that. Chad Lumborn, thank you for all your content and generosity. My question is intuitive surgical. Okay, that's checks the healthc care box. I think longterm it's fine. I don't think it's come down enough cash flow revenues and it may never. This is a great business at a decent price but not a great price. Yeah, I don't think you're going to go wrong with this long term. I mean, I'd love to see it in the 300s, and I probably never will, but if I do, I'd be a lot more interested than I am at these levels. Jackson Matthews, he wants to go from compliance to investments. um he's a CFP. Uh my best suggestion is go to YouTube hedge fund tips and then search University of Bristol. I did an hour on how to do that and that should answer most of your questions. Michael Costa Hannes Brands. Um, I just don't like this one even though I think it's going to work. I mean, free cash flow is going in the wrong direction. Revenues have been left for dead. Margins are going up and balance sheet. Not not good. Two billion of debt. They paid down a bunch. 200 million of cash. That's your problem with the stock. I think you just got to chart out all the maturities when they come due. What match it to the cash flow. see what their plan is to reacelerate growth and uh in the meantime it's a trading vehicle. It probably works for a trade, but I'm going to just pass a on that one. Cole Fleshman, let's see. Canadian CP. Well, Buffett said he's not buying more railroads. I'm probably not buying more railroads. Um and certainly not in a stock that hasn't even come down. So, I'm going to pass on that. Just do a quick look at it. Make sure I'm not missing anything extraordinary. Yeah, it's doing fine. Flatlining. Return on investor returns have been crap. Uh, pass. Okay. Next. Flower Foods from Dan Darren Flo 2:45. What time is it? 12:00. Okay. Wow. Huh. Yeah, this is just in a hated group. What do they have? Wonderbread, Nature's Own Bake House. So, a lot of bread, tasty cake, carb city, huh? I'd rather be in protein city with Horell. But, uh, what is is this a dividend payer? Dividend yield 6.8%. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. These are going to come back into favor, ladies and gentlemen. Dividend payers are going to come back into favor. But this is a problem if this is true. $5 million of cash. What's the account receivables are? 330 million. What does the debt look like? A billion. All right. You got to see how much is current. Nothing. All right. This is a whole solvency trade. If if if you can feel comfortable that they're going to remain solvent based on when the debt matures, what coupons they're paying on it now, what you expect they'll pay on in the future, what free cash flow looks like, perspectively, it's pretty steady. Then maybe you have something. For me, there's not enough upside relative to the downside. For that reason, I'm out. This is becoming a client. Okay. Kune. K N I N Swiss company. [Music] logistics services. It's only with one logistics company we're playing and that's GXO Logistics. So, it's kind of hald again. Dividend yield. This is probably okay, but it's no way as good as GXO. What the hell? Oh, that's cash. Okay. Wait a minute. They must have sold something here. I don't really like that drop off. What's happened to earnings? I mean, it's have because earnings have I'mma pass on this. Let's see. The hell's the share count? Yeah, not not for me. Next. Norm, that's for client T. Tim D. Thoughts on Chipotle? Not not not yet. Great business. A lot of the key executives I know, not for me at the moment, but at some price 100%. Uh, Glob. This is from Quac. This looks like a falling knife right now. H technology services, AI studios network, blockchain business hacking, again we try to avoid this type of stuff because it's it's very hard to understand their moat. Um this is a broken growth stock and they tend to take years to build bases. So I'm not eager for this one. I will just take a quick look. On a financial basis, I don't really see anything wrong with it. on a moat basis, I have no real edge. So, I'd have to study it a lot more. I just think it this broke so many people because it was a multiagger and now that it's come down, I I think you're going to probably find some buyers around 50 bucks, but it's going to take an awful long time to build a new group of owners, provided the moat is durable. I might take a look at this. But again, these are both businesses that you really better be damn sure that they can protect the moat. Otherwise, you got nothing. Tim D, CMG. We covered Jason Sanchez. Path. Wow. Co darling from $90 down to 10. Market's telling you whatever they do is no longer useful. Let's see if that's true. Free cash flows flatlined. Margins are declining. Revenues are slowly growing. End to end automation, robotic process solutions, software, robots. Again, it's just understanding the mo and and like even if you're in the industry and you know this stuff backward and forward, this could be disintermediated in five minutes. And right right now it seems like the market's saying it is um still growing revenues though. They've slowed down the share count but like it's tripled in five years. stockbased comp. I mean, half a billion dollars in 2022. Absolute pigs. Um, I think the story here is you got to learn the business and be damn sure that they're not going to be dis intermediated for free by AI. But, uh, again, this one will go on the list for path to take a look at. Good work. Daniel Borman. Hey Tom, love your podcast. Regular listener. I started sharing with my friends and colleagues. Thank you for that. What are your thoughts on latest court confirmation that Trump overstepped his authority on tariffs and that they would be rendered void in on October 14th? Presumably the market doesn't have this priced in that would go in effect presumably surprise to the upside for next earnings. What do you think? I think Trump loves being in court and he tends to win in court. So, and if he doesn't, he'll figure out how to have Congress do it. So, I wouldn't bet on tariffs going away. Oscar, we've covered this one a bunch of times in past. [Music] Free cash flow going, revenue is growing. There's nothing not to love. I just don't understand. health plans to individuals I I don't have an edge on this type of business so 4 billion negative IBIDA this is not I voted for super athlete of a daughter Annabelle thank you so much Yeah, I don't really have an edge here. I can't tell why buying my insurance through Oscar is better than buying it anywhere else. Um, you know, you had a similar thing with Lemonade in the PNC space. Just seems like their revenues have been declining since the COVID peak. issued themselves a lot of shares. Growing huge though, top line here, they must have done an acquisition or something. Uh, I think we got to do a little bit of work on this, but I doubt we're ever going to do anything with it. But thank you, Alfredo. compenserve. Uh, why not play two parties? That's not the way we roll. We've covered five serve a few times. It's fine. It's just not for us. How do you like grab? It's from Robert Wartanian. We've covered that one. Uh I don't like the food delivery business. Period. [Music] I I just don't like the business. I'm going to pass. Chris Brooker, largest brick maker in the UK. IBS at IB, largest brick maker in the UK. [Music] That's a business I can understand. Free cash flow turning positive. Revenues turning back up. You know, 124 million of debt, 11 million of cash. Revenu's declining because of housing. I get it. Oh, let's see what the receivables are. 47 million. I don't think this has come down enough relative to the tenuous nature of the balance sheet. I think you're close to a low. I don't know if you got it exactly, but I think it's pretty good. Uh not something I'd be pounding the table for with a balance sheet like that for a maximum upside of a double. It's not that exciting to me. But I think a good idea overall. Sable offshore co corp. This is a special situation play based on a legal decision. We don't do that. Um but creative idea, just not what we do. Cam K, I found that you when you make decisions on the basis of things you can't control, they wind up controlling you and that's not a position I want to be in. Cam K, huge fan and appreciate the regular quotes. Uh, African cell tower companies. Cell tower companies. IHS. Try to only give me one ticker per [Music] HTWSF. [Music] [Music] [Music] I mean, here's the here's the bottom line. My experience is this all looks great. It's it's like it's just Africa is where money goes to die. Okay? I I've met one guy who builds airports in Africa and he's made a lot of money. Uh you know, Exxon and the oil companies go to Africa, they make money. Everyone else goes to Africa, they see a couple elephants and they lose all their money. So everything about these looks great financially. The problem is is you have governments that could take the assets. You have all kinds of things. So for me, I'm just not willing to take that kind of risk there. And that doesn't mean these won't be hundred baggers or 10 baggggers or five baggggers. It's just uh rule number one is don't lose money. Rule number two is don't don't forget rule number one. Why why risk what you have and need for what you don't have and don't need? I.e. I don't need to take a 5x upside 100% downside bet in Africa when I can find all the three to five baggers I want in the developed markets and sleep like a baby at night. So, for that reason, I'm out. Has nothing to do with your ideas being good or bad. I think they're good. I just I just don't want to take that risk because I'm always guessing what some third world government is going to decide that they want to do one day when they wake up and they realize they need money to maintain the peace. So, IFFF, uh, we've covered this is from, uh, Tim Wang. Um, covered this over and over. Uh, I think this one's fine. I think we should probably, you know, I think this is one we should potentially own. But, uh, we don't, but um, again, I'll reiterate, I like it. Scott's Miracle Grow we've covered. We like that. That's from Michael Costa. Lucy Broadfoot asks about BME. H [Music] [Music] All right. So, they got a billion of long-term debt, 200 million of cash. Free cash flow is 780. Uh, I like this idea. I really like this idea. Let me see here. Retails general merchandise products and groceries. This is a tough business, but Oh, this looks like a uh algae knockoff. I mean, Buffy got bagged doing UK retailer, Tesco or whatever it was. I kind of like this, Lucy. All right, thanks for sending it in, Chris Shaw. It's another client coming in October. All right, Chris York Bourgeoa asks, "Thanks to you. I've started to study for my CFA in February. Very grateful for that. You've shared both in your positions but in your advice for young people also. I also read the Graham books as well as random walk and similar books between your podcast uploads which has helped me a lot. Simple question. Can you really chalk most significant market locations up to greed or is it ignorance or both? Um I think it's most up to fear and career risk. So most managers don't want to own anything that's down in the short term because they they basically are closet indexers hugging the benchmark trying to keep their jobs and then they're in the asset gathering sales business. Um so it's mostly fear where you get the opportunities not greed. Greed is where you sell into and greed is what causes most people to buy at or near the tops because they see their neighbors making money on names after they're already up 10x and they wind up becoming the bag holders. So, um that's the answer to that question. Also looking for your which is a function of envy which is what Charlie talked as the uh worst vice and it's just a cycle that repeats. Also looking for your opinion on how to present yourself in any kind of business environment. What do you wear? Uh I think the general rule of thumb is uh better to be overdressed than to be underdressed. You could always take your jacket and tie off, but I I'm old school. I think if you're talking about someone's money, you should be serious because it's a serious matter. Um that's an coming in October. Adam No. Okay. So, with that said, we'll be back next week. Same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
