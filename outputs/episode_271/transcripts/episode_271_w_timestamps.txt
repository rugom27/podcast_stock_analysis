[0.719s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.399s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.879s] 271st videoast podcast for the week
[8.559s] ending December 24th 2024 happy

[30.48s] family first and here&#39;s some pictures of
[32.8s] me and Annabelle with pepper and lucky
[35.6s] on the pier there absolutely
[38.48s] gorgeous uh day and then I got a little
[41.52s] bit of golf in it&#39;s nice to swing a golf
[43.879s] club in the middle of December the
[45.84s] swings coming back strong very excited
[49.079s] about that love the new club and those
[51.44s] of you who come out to visit we&#39;re going
[53.039s] to get to play absolutely incredible
[55.32s] that&#39;s with Mimi again pepper and lucky
[58.879s] so uh so that&#39;s that also wanted to
[62.28s] cover uh quotes of the week here from
[65.84s] Peter Lynch the worst thing you can do
[68.24s] is invest in companies you know nothing
[70.759s] about unfortunately buying stocks on
[73.759s] ignorance is still a popular American
[77.4s] Pastime uh you know and you&#39;re seeing it
[80.04s] more and more lately that&#39;s going to
[82.24s] change very soon but uh in the meantime
[85.479s] just sit back uh and pray to God you did
[89.04s] not get
[90.64s] uh fomo jeans because that&#39;s what&#39;ll get
[93.28s] you in trouble so let&#39;s go through some
[95.68s] of the uh economic data of the week
[98.24s] we&#39;re going to do an abbreviated session
[100.0s] we might get this one under an hour here
[101.88s] for Christmas Eve let&#39;s see if we can
[103.68s] pull it off I always say that and then
[105.68s] it&#39;s two hours every single week but uh
[108.24s] China&#39;s oneye bond yields tumble below
[110.52s] 1% not what we want to see but uh
[114.24s] exactly what you see right before every
[117.24s] major rally in China&#39;s stock
[122.399s] so you saw it in 2009 monster rally you
[126.32s] saw it in
[127.56s] 2016 monster rally 2018 you saw it in uh
[131.8s] 20 monster rally so we&#39;re going to see
[134.48s] it again here this is going to turn up
[136.04s] in 2025 and we are going to be smiling
[138.879s] so wide we could eat a banana sideways
[141.44s] uh so that&#39;s that here&#39;s manufacturing
[145.519s] PMI uh started to turn up Philly fed
[148.8s] manufacturing still turning down so
[150.519s] that&#39;s just a regional survey Bank of
[152.84s] Japan UA hints at chance of later rate
[156.92s] hike sending Yen lower they have no
[159.4s] choice when you look at the Japanese
[160.959s] data inflation is going up they are
[163.72s] going to have to hike uh and we saw a
[167.159s] preview of coming attractions in August
[170.2s] when they did that what got monkey
[172.44s] Hammer smashed people have such a short
[175.48s] memory is mag 7 all mag 7 is is a
[180.12s] levered play on the carry trade when the
[182.64s] carry trade unwinds those 37% weightings
[186.64s] in the S&amp;P are going to change very
[190.08s] quickly ladies and gentlemen uh doesn&#39;t
[192.48s] mean the businesses are bad doesn&#39;t mean
[194.48s] anything they&#39;re still going to generate
[196.12s] cash what it does mean is they&#39;ll be
[198.4s] R-rated in accordance with the cost of
[201.04s] capital that is financing the
[203.36s] aberrational valuations and we don&#39;t
[205.799s] want to be there when that day happens
[208.12s] China May set highest budget deficit in
[211.239s] decades so they&#39;re going to 4% GDP
[214.36s] everyone says they&#39;re not doing enough
[216.2s] we covered last week repeatedly China is
[219.4s] in the uh most easy financial conditions
[222.68s] that they&#39;ve been since
[224.92s] 2016 right before a monster rally and
[227.36s] then prior to that uh 2020
[230.28s] 2016 then 2009 and then going back to
[233.56s] 200000 which again all preceded monster
[236.879s] rallies in Chinese equities uh we
[239.84s] covered a bunch of these charts last
[241.84s] week we got the bounce that we were
[243.72s] looking for people were running for the
[245.319s] hills we said it&#39;s going to take a
[246.599s] couple days and we&#39;re going right back
[248.12s] up and we showed you 10 indicators and
[250.28s] that&#39;s exactly what happened small is
[252.64s] greater than large cap expectations rise
[255.68s] uh to the highest since May of
[258.68s] 2021 um small cap will outperform the
[262.24s] large cap we&#39;re going to cover some some
[263.84s] data as to why we believe this is true
[266.96s] and you saw inclinations of that back in
[270.44s] the early 2000s as well which is when
[272.28s] they outperformed retail sales ladies
[274.479s] and gentlemen look what led the way
[277.36s] bigly motor vehicle and auto parts
[280.039s] dealers and what&#39;s beautiful is it&#39;s
[282.36s] happening right according to plan people
[285.16s] are moving down the Spectrum they&#39;re
[287.479s] buying smaller
[290.72s] cars but they&#39;re buying larger quantity
[293.199s] and that is beautiful for Cooper
[295.8s] standard because whether the car is
[298.12s] small or large you still got to seal the
[300.039s] windows and doors and you got to uh
[302.08s] transfer fluid and uh uh Fuel and all
[304.88s] those wonderful beautiful things that
[306.68s] Cooper standard does Nvidia versus super
[310.039s] micro if you remember super micro was
[312.44s] the same type of parabolic chart uh it&#39;s
[315.8s] uh absolutely completely collapsed went
[318.68s] from one uh so it went from 10 to 120
[321.88s] and 120 back to 20 had a dead cat bounce
[325.759s] here this will go back below 20 and it
[328.4s] doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re the same type of
[329.919s] businesses it doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s going
[331.6s] to happen necessarily these analoges
[333.96s] don&#39;t mean much but you do have to be
[335.8s] cognizant of what you&#39;re dealing with
[337.8s] 10-year treasury yield versus TLT so you
[341.28s] can see this broad massive Divergence we
[343.88s] haven&#39;t seen
[345.52s] since uh
[348.56s] 2020 and then uh 2018 which we talk
[352.4s] about a lot then 2010 and what happened
[355.56s] in all of these instances is we saw big
[358.039s] rallies in Treasure Ines compressions of
[361.12s] yields just another way to look at it
[362.919s] here&#39;s another useless analog but it
[365.52s] puts things in perspective so you can be
[369.08s] cognizant of your surroundings uh this
[371.72s] is NVIDIA versus Cisco stock prices you
[374.8s] could see what it looked like in
[377.8s] 1999 when it shot up from you know 10
[380.56s] bucks to 80 bucks and then collapsed uh
[384.0s] you know it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind of odd
[386.52s] though the charts do look eerily similar
[388.599s] you had this first move
[390.12s] a check back a little consolidation then
[392.319s] you put in this top then you do a check
[394.759s] back then you do another one I mean I it
[397.16s] doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s going to happen
[398.919s] I certainly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to
[399.919s] have a tech wreck I do think we&#39;re going
[401.8s] to have a tech
[403.639s] underperformance uh and
[406.84s] um uh just keep it on your screens
[409.68s] because Cisco was the exact same type of
[412.12s] exciting narrative and uh we we know how
[415.599s] that worked and it&#39;s taken you know 25
[418.4s] years it still has not gotten back to
[420.12s] the same
[422.52s] levels this is for macro
[425.599s] charts uh this is put volume on the TLT
[429.68s] hasn&#39;t peaked this much since 2011 right
[433.039s] before you got a big rally in bonds and
[436.36s] then when went again
[440.039s] 2018 when uh managers and hedge funds
[443.56s] were a record short which we&#39;ve
[444.919s] referenced many times so you see this
[446.84s] much put volume with everyone&#39;s so
[448.44s] certain that yields are going to 5%
[451.199s] guarantee uh as close to a guarantee as
[453.479s] you can get in life that bonds are going
[455.68s] to Rally in the first quarter of
[458.0s] 20125 and uh what whatever the reason
[461.84s] we&#39;ll see but um oh it&#39;s interesting I
[465.599s] wanted to I didn&#39;t quite put it
[469.68s] in uh there was an article
[473.8s] about waste in the New York Post and um
[479.639s] Ron Paul listed or Rand Paul listed all
[483.56s] these pet peeve projects he wanted to
[485.24s] get rid of one was I think they spent a
[487.36s] million dollars determining whether mice
[491.159s] uh sought out
[493.599s] cocaine uh more if they were lonely mice
[496.72s] or not lonely mice you know your
[498.36s] taxpayer put to work your taxpayer funds
[501.36s] put to work uh uh you know unbelievable
[505.12s] but they&#39;re going to cut all this
[506.12s] nonsense that is going to be bullish and
[508.879s] it doesn&#39;t mean me they&#39;re going to cut
[510.28s] 2 trillion it just means that the
[513.0s] perception around the fiscal
[515.599s] recklessness is going to be changed and
[518.399s] once the perception changes you will see
[521.8s] a big change in uh the the way the bonds
[526.12s] trade okay this here is the current
[530.0s] General business condition conditions
[532.48s] diffusion index for New York and you can
[535.32s] see here it&#39;s just now peaked above the
[538.44s] zero line which which is what you see in
[541.0s] expansions like you saw in 2009 coming
[544.2s] from below back to above like you saw in
[547.56s] 201516 after that uh last China debacle
[551.16s] before the uh huge China rally in 2016
[554.519s] to 2018 saw it during covid saw it in
[558.32s] 2001 so this is expansionary rail rail
[561.519s] car loadings turning up this is a key
[563.839s] indicator this is something that we were
[565.76s] showing last week uh performance before
[568.2s] and after daily losing streaks lasting 9
[571.48s] days or greater so here we are looking
[574.839s] uh uh 60 days out um back to New highs
[579.2s] this is pretty uh straightforward Santa
[581.88s] comes later in December we&#39;re starting
[583.48s] to see Santa uh kick into gear today
[586.399s] which is pretty exciting and uh how the
[589.92s] seasonally bullish Santa Claus rally
[591.519s] period could foreshadow the future and
[594.32s] you see that when you have those
[596.92s] positive returns in the last week of
[600.44s] December it usually bodess well to a
[603.68s] positive uh uh January effect and then a
[606.839s] positive next year which we&#39;re on board
[609.56s] with although we&#39;ll have more uh
[611.279s] slightly more volatility next year if
[613.64s] Santa should fail to call Bears may come
[616.6s] to Broad and wall so if he doesn&#39;t show
[619.0s] up that tends to be a
[620.6s] negative
[623.079s] um but all these are guidelines not
[625.92s] guarantees small cap still trading at a
[628.24s] lower than average pre premium to the
[629.839s] S&amp;P 500 we&#39;re going to see some some
[632.399s] data on that today on the catchup with
[634.92s] small caps this is a list of beaten down
[639.76s] stocks that uh could outperform next
[642.88s] year this was an article
[646.36s] by market watch as a matter of fact
[649.12s] let&#39;s just pull that up
[650.959s] here and uh from
[655.76s] evercore an image in the new tab all
[659.04s] right so this is like a shopping list
[661.76s] ladies and
[663.48s] gentlemen and what they&#39;re looking for
[668.68s] here
[670.36s] is talks about small
[673.959s] caps uh and talking
[678.639s] about stocks are trade tax losers Poise
[682.44s] to bounds so this is all the tax losers
[684.839s] and what you saw this year is anything
[687.279s] that wasn&#39;t up on the year just got
[689.36s] pounded
[690.44s] relentlessly in December and when that
[693.92s] calendar turns you&#39;re going to see a lot
[696.519s] of people want to put these stocks on
[698.12s] their books so you know you got Nike you
[700.8s] got Intel that&#39;s going to be awesome for
[703.079s] us next year uh crown castle that&#39;s all
[706.0s] rates we&#39;re going to cover that today
[707.639s] which we love backer is going to be a
[709.88s] monster next year Healthcare we covered
[711.92s] last week um see if there are any on
[715.519s] here so Nike we don&#39;t have yet we want
[718.12s] we want to uh
[720.079s] we&#39;re happy with VF courp but um I think
[722.959s] that&#39;s going to start to show signs of a
[725.0s] turnaround as well uh Etsy we already
[728.079s] have that&#39;s moved up a a bit but uh we
[730.639s] think that&#39;ll continue gxo I love this
[733.079s] opportunity here and know I have some
[735.24s] new money coming in from existing
[736.92s] clients this week we&#39;re also opening up
[739.76s] uh a few days early for q1 we&#39;re going
[742.32s] to talk about why uh later in this call
[746.079s] but the setup for these some of these to
[747.76s] buy gxo now down the hole like this
[750.199s] because the deal didn&#39;t go through thank
[751.92s] God the deal didn&#39;t go through if we had
[753.76s] gotten taken out at 70 or 80 I would
[755.88s] have been pissed this thing&#39;s going to
[757.16s] be a lot higher over the next three
[758.8s] years uh there&#39;s excess Supply that
[761.199s] they&#39;re still working through since
[762.68s] covid but gxo is going to be the winner
[765.399s] as all the small players get smoked and
[767.88s] get gobbled up so we&#39;re pretty excited
[769.88s] about that Yeti we keep getting as ask
[772.199s] me anything questions uh um we keep
[775.68s] looking at it we haven&#39;t done anything
[777.399s] yet there
[779.399s] uh AIS not for me Advanced Auto Part
[782.0s] starting to move up we love that in
[785.079s] 2025
[786.8s] uh and Sun Run I don&#39;t know I keep
[790.24s] looking at I keep looking at these uh
[792.72s] there&#39;s going to be two or three solar
[795.16s] stocks that do exceptionally well next
[796.88s] year uh and we&#39;re probably going to be
[799.92s] perfectly happy not to participate but
[802.12s] we continue to keep an open mind for
[804.92s] green stocks which did well under Trump
[807.36s] one which did terribly under Biden which
[811.04s] goes against everything that everyone
[812.8s] would think is true China onshore buying
[815.839s] of Hong Kong stocks hits record uh guess
[818.959s] what were the two record stocks that
[820.8s] were being accumulated at the end of
[822.639s] this year was this China bank and
[825.639s] Alibaba so uh that southbound connects
[828.44s] continues to build weak breath might not
[831.32s] be a bad thing here&#39;s the signals after
[834.199s] 10 days more of decliners is greater
[835.959s] than advancers in the past 40 years
[837.8s] which we just had from D Ryan Dietrich
[840.88s] over at Carson and what we see is in
[845.36s] what you know one month uh the average
[848.519s] return or the average is negative 910 of
[852.279s] 1% median is half a percent
[854.88s] up uh 3 months up 1.2% median up 3.2 6
[860.16s] months up 9% median 3.7% average up 12
[864.44s] months 17.9% average 17.3 so the
[868.519s] implication is from these signals 17 up
[871.36s] 17% a year out that seems a little rich
[875.16s] but wouldn&#39;t shock me uh uh you know
[879.36s] presidential cycle we covered the desial
[881.759s] cycle last last week um we&#39;re more in
[885.32s] the 8 to 12% for the indices and
[888.639s] dramatic outperformance for under the
[890.8s] indices but um we&#39;ll keep an open mind
[894.079s] for that people already front loading
[896.16s] possible
[897.639s] tariffs um
[900.68s] yeah that&#39;s silly season we&#39;ll see how
[902.92s] that plays out uh us pce price index
[906.199s] came in lower than expected uh there are
[908.959s] some articles about what they would have
[910.72s] done with that Dot Plot had they seen
[912.24s] this number ahead of time we&#39;ll see
[914.12s] inflation expectations coming down
[916.44s] monopolies monopolizing returns and
[918.32s] market cap here&#39;s market cap of S&amp;P 500
[921.32s] versus uh uh
[924.48s] unmagnify so these things have really
[927.279s] really gotten away
[930.0s] um and we&#39;ll see if that door closes
[931.759s] either by the unmagnify up or the
[934.759s] Magnificent catching down I think it&#39;s
[936.519s] going to be the UNM magnificent catching
[938.079s] up uh Bull and Bear indicator still
[940.399s] suppressed so that doesn&#39;t you know
[942.48s] that&#39;s not what you see at tops what you
[944.8s] see at tops is 8 to 10 extreme
[946.68s] bullishness we&#39;re not there yet although
[948.639s] we do have over allocations of equity
[951.92s] allocations
[954.16s] um here we have debt allocation at 19%
[959.16s] as a percentage of Holdings so that&#39;s
[960.48s] near record lows I think that&#39;s going to
[962.279s] be an opportunity in
[966.36s] 2025 I think TLT is going to get bid I
[969.24s] think uh CCI as a result of that is
[971.68s] going to get bid all the reats are going
[973.04s] to get bid this shows government
[976.0s] spending from the CBO and Wells Fargo
[978.92s] what is mandatory what is discretionary
[981.759s] and what is net
[984.079s] interest uh mandatory is 4.1 trillion
[987.079s] which is 14.5% of GDP P that&#39;s Social
[989.72s] Security
[991.279s] Medicare Medicaid income Security
[994.48s] Programs other discretionary is
[998.279s] non-defense and defense that&#39;s about 1.8
[1000.759s] trillion net interest is 949 billion
[1005.519s] so uh here&#39;s the mandatory
[1009.48s] spending shows all the benefits to give
[1011.72s] you an idea Canada retail sales month-
[1014.759s] on- Monon for vehicles was also off the
[1017.279s] charts just like us which which is
[1019.16s] interesting because the us we seed well
[1022.6s] maybe some of that was replacement from
[1024.36s] the hurricanes in Florida but when you
[1027.319s] see that although there are a lot of
[1029.64s] Canadians in Florida that&#39;s for sure uh
[1032.52s] so maybe there was a little bump on that
[1034.839s] uh natural
[1036.6s] gas moving up on the cold swell so we
[1039.959s] love that for Comstock S&amp;P 500 RIS
[1043.4s] premium people view this as a negative
[1046.4s] for equities CU it&#39;s at the lowest level
[1048.52s] in 25 years except what happened when
[1052.0s] the risk premium got this low what
[1054.799s] people are missing about this Equity
[1056.4s] risk premium is it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of
[1060.28s] the valuations of the top seven stocks
[1063.76s] so the last time you had Equity risk
[1065.96s] premium this this low was the last time
[1068.96s] that you saw dramatic outperformance of
[1070.799s] value small caps in Emerging Markets uh
[1073.76s] and the concentrated stocks like the
[1076.559s] cisos of the world get smoked which you
[1078.96s] can see here from 2001 to 2003 and
[1081.559s] that&#39;s when the quote unquote 493
[1084.08s] equivalent back then just took off like
[1086.36s] nobody&#39;s business small caps took off
[1088.48s] like nobody&#39;s business Emerging Markets
[1090.6s] took off like nobody&#39;s business so
[1092.12s] everything points back to 2021 2022 in
[1095.32s] case we haven&#39;t mentioned that enough in
[1096.6s] the last 6 weeks it&#39;s been a
[1099.08s] historically bad few weeks for Value
[1101.08s] versus growth again you get that type of
[1104.039s] thing in
[1105.6s] 2001 uh and you got a bit of it in 2020
[1108.96s] which was an unbelievable year uh so
[1111.96s] this is where you make hate while the
[1114.039s] while the sun shines and the sun is
[1115.76s] coming up uh from the East right now
[1118.64s] property prices are climbing again
[1120.84s] Apartments commercial property offices
[1124.12s] not so much commercial real estate
[1126.36s] Finance rebounds so uh those properties
[1129.32s] are starting to get financed that was
[1130.84s] part of that ver vernado thesis which
[1133.08s] which uh hit our fair value much quicker
[1137.0s] than expected uh a is picking back up
[1140.72s] that&#39;ll be a theme in 2025 as well IPOs
[1144.44s] is magnificent 7 AM Mania so again I&#39;m
[1147.08s] not calling for anything I&#39;m just trying
[1149.12s] to represent
[1152.919s] cognizance for you guys to think
[1157.0s] about um and this shows the equivalent
[1161.52s] rallies in oil in the early 2000s
[1164.48s] remember Commodities Emerging Markets it
[1166.72s] shows us home prices during that same
[1169.2s] period the housing bubble it shows the
[1171.84s] NASDAQ in the 9s and what they&#39;re
[1173.64s] showing here is the Magnificent 7 is way
[1178.679s] more
[1185.12s] extreme than the NASDAQ 100 bubble of
[1188.6s] the late 90s and the Nik bubble of the
[1191.84s] late 80s and the gold bubble of the 70s
[1194.159s] and the nifty50 of the late 60s before
[1197.28s] the 73 crash
[1199.64s] uh conference board us leading index
[1201.799s] month on month that&#39;s uh turning
[1204.88s] positive again like we saw in 2009 so
[1207.96s] and in
[1210.799s] 2001 Japan CPI this is what I was
[1213.559s] referring to their inflation is going up
[1215.4s] they will have to hike and all the mag s
[1218.44s] is right now is a levered uh carry trade
[1222.679s] that&#39;s where all the carry they borrow
[1224.84s] at zero and they invested in US risk
[1227.84s] assets and they benefit from the
[1229.799s] appreciation of the dollar relative to
[1231.799s] the Yen and they benefit from the free
[1234.2s] money it&#39;s a riskless trade until it
[1236.88s] becomes what do they say risk-free
[1239.799s] return until you get return free risk
[1242.72s] and that shifts quicker than you know
[1245.08s] and everyone gets a margin call on the
[1246.48s] same day and they you got a preview of
[1248.32s] coming attractions in early August it&#39;s
[1250.08s] just people forgot and they went right
[1251.64s] back to doing the exact same thing so um
[1254.64s] usually what happens if they didn&#39;t get
[1256.24s] the lesson the first time they get it uh
[1258.08s] in space the second time so here&#39;s more
[1261.6s] Japanese CPI turning
[1265.559s] up China May set the highest budget
[1268.72s] deficit in decades 4% of GDP everyone&#39;s
[1272.12s] still bearish uh this is going to be a
[1276.279s] this this has a 2025 literally has a
[1279.679s] chance to be
[1282.96s] um I think probably the best year of my
[1285.84s] career we&#39;ll I mean I you know take it
[1288.96s] with a grain of salt but I haven&#39;t seen
[1291.32s] so many things lining up in the way and
[1295.64s] and it looked like there was a chance it
[1297.08s] could do it in Q4 and then Trump got
[1299.08s] elected and so we had to go through that
[1301.159s] same uh
[1303.2s] inauguration election everything that&#39;s
[1305.799s] worthwhile gets smacked after the
[1307.72s] inauguration it all goes off the charts
[1310.08s] when no one expects it and everyone gets
[1311.919s] completely position the wrong way as
[1313.48s] they&#39;re doing right now I mean we&#39;re
[1315.2s] going to look at a chart of something
[1316.6s] called fcoin which is going parabolic
[1319.4s] and it tells you everything you need to
[1320.799s] know I I&#39;m not exaggerating that is the
[1322.84s] name of the quote unquote investment so
[1326.559s] uh China May said okay so that&#39;s the
[1328.32s] budget deficit that&#39;s called fiscal
[1330.039s] spending ladies and gentlemen here&#39;s
[1331.919s] value back to the 50-day moving average
[1334.36s] completely oversold and you see it at
[1337.36s] these levels this is going to rip right
[1338.84s] after the calendar turns uh this is
[1341.6s] Larry Williams via Seth golden General
[1344.36s] Road maack for 2025 this guy&#39;s pretty
[1346.679s] good uh he&#39;s he&#39;s he&#39;s um his timing
[1350.0s] Cycles have worked really well over the
[1351.679s] last four years I always pay attention
[1353.159s] to him he&#39;s gotten a lot of stuff also
[1355.32s] wrong over the years which we all uh uh
[1358.4s] make mistakes that&#39;s part of the game
[1360.44s] but um he&#39;s right more often than he&#39;s
[1362.6s] wrong and that&#39;s the name of the game as
[1364.159s] well uh so he&#39;s he&#39;s pointing to
[1366.52s] continued weakness into February and
[1368.64s] then a rally into March and April we&#39;ll
[1371.0s] see I mean my general base case is
[1374.44s] that we should be strong into the
[1376.84s] inauguration
[1378.6s] a lot of new stuff will start to work
[1380.159s] into the inauguration and then the old
[1382.0s] stuff I think you you are going to see
[1384.0s] some profit taking in the mag 7 uh
[1387.64s] either after the calendar turns or after
[1390.279s] the inauguration as we get the rotation
[1392.36s] playing out Santa Claus rally begins
[1395.36s] what do we have
[1397.32s] here okay so the average average return
[1400.039s] up a half a percent so that&#39;s kind of
[1402.039s] kicking into gear today I
[1404.799s] see uh oh okay that&#39;s why the numbers
[1408.24s] start stop moving the Market&#39;s closed
[1410.36s] it&#39;s uh 1:00 in New York and uh 10:40 in
[1414.559s] the morning here uh Euro areas GDP seen
[1419.159s] growing less
[1422.84s] strongly okay so that&#39;s that and this in
[1426.2s] case you forgot this is showing asset
[1430.64s] class return since
[1432.76s] 1801 ladies and gentlemen if you had put
[1436.96s] $1 in stocks in
[1440.72s] 1801 uh your average return would have
[1442.919s] been about 7% a year compounded and that
[1445.279s] turned into
[1446.559s] 2.3 million $1 into 2.3 million
[1450.36s] unbelievable bonds $1
[1453.48s] became
[1455.919s] 2,100 so same dollar do you want 2,100
[1460.039s] or do you want 2.3 million it&#39;s not even
[1463.36s] close T bills that&#39;s why you want an
[1465.64s] equity manager not a bond manager t-
[1469.279s] bills uh $1 became
[1472.88s] $245 gold gold guys you
[1477.32s] can&#39;t people can&#39;t get enough gold right
[1479.919s] now right everyone wants gold we&#39;ve been
[1482.12s] saying good luck with that $1 became $4
[1486.72s] so if you buy gold now in
[1490.88s] 220 years you will have six if you buy
[1494.24s] $4 worth of gold you&#39;ll have $16 worth
[1497.6s] in2 200
[1499.64s] 20 years so uh have at it if that&#39;s
[1502.44s] interesting to you and the dollar has
[1504.2s] been the worst performing investment so
[1505.919s] if you&#39;re sitting with dollars in the
[1507.76s] bank account and not invested in
[1509.679s] equities you are losing like nobody&#39;s
[1512.0s] business so
[1514.36s] um so that&#39;s that weak breath might not
[1517.72s] be a bad thing uh we covered that chart
[1521.679s] that was from Ryan dri this
[1524.24s] is next seven days
[1528.84s] down okay so that&#39;s
[1532.2s] positive from 1950 the average is 1.3%
[1536.559s] for the Santa Claus rally zag breath
[1541.0s] rust this is from a guy named Grant
[1543.0s] hawkridge a lot of talk about the breath
[1545.76s] thrust and it looks like it&#39;s going to
[1547.08s] be happening here has crossed the 10day
[1549.76s] count begins will Santa bring a breath
[1551.399s] thrust with him so uh when breath
[1554.96s] quickly recovers from oversold
[1556.64s] conditions calculated using a 10 day uh
[1559.6s] exponential moving average of the number
[1562.24s] of advancing stocks on the N NYSC
[1564.279s] divided by the total number of stocks in
[1565.799s] the NYC a Buy Signal occurs when the
[1567.679s] indicator moves from below 04 to above 6
[1571.799s] within 10 trading days or less uh
[1574.679s] signals rare the average
[1577.32s] gain uh when you get this signal which
[1580.159s] we&#39;ll know in a few days uh the S&amp;P 500
[1583.36s] has always been higher six months later
[1585.279s] with an average gain of 16.2%
[1589.08s] so uh you know there you go hope for a
[1592.2s] breath thrust in then zag Marty Z was a
[1595.679s] legend by the way hope for aw breath
[1597.72s] thrust uh last week when we said this
[1600.88s] thing was going to take you
[1602.44s] know a couple of days and it did it
[1605.559s] didn&#39;t really get its footing until
[1608.84s] Monday um we pointed to the pmo by all
[1612.559s] and the pmo SPX hadn&#39;t hit zero it&#39;s now
[1615.0s] hit zero this thing&#39;s turning up we&#39;re
[1617.2s] off to the races
[1620.32s] and the National Association of active
[1622.76s] investment managers came down everything
[1624.679s] set up correctly merging stocks emerging
[1628.0s] market stocks wobble since Donald
[1630.159s] Trump&#39;s election they did the exact same
[1632.679s] thing in 2016 2017 and then took off
[1635.96s] after the inauguration China&#39;s fiscal
[1637.6s] stimulus has been conservative in recent
[1639.36s] years this is now
[1642.08s] accelerating uh dating sites we&#39;ve been
[1644.76s] getting a lot of ask me anything
[1646.12s] questions about match you know you got
[1648.52s] an activist including Elliot and
[1650.24s] starboard super smart guys but even now
[1653.12s] they&#39;re saying you know after all the
[1655.279s] things that they&#39;ve asked them to do
[1656.44s] about trimming costs attracting new
[1658.399s] users setting up
[1659.88s] Innovation uh he said if it fails to
[1663.6s] deliver quote We Believe changes must be
[1665.919s] considered including for match itself to
[1668.32s] go private once again and then they
[1670.12s] they&#39;ll just dividend out the cash to
[1671.64s] themselves so uh but you can see the
[1673.559s] trends here and the problem is is Tinder
[1676.679s] lot a lot lost a lot of users Badu has
[1680.039s] lost a lot of users bumbles uh Grinders
[1683.64s] H hinges going upwards but it&#39;s just too
[1687.039s] small
[1688.799s] so that&#39;s what we need to see to want to
[1691.919s] get involved in match it&#39;s like yeah
[1694.799s] revenues have been super flat that&#39;s
[1696.76s] probably from Price raises while they&#39;re
[1698.44s] losing clients is there stabilization of
[1701.679s] users or an acceleration of users that&#39;s
[1704.559s] when we want to get in when the stocks
[1706.36s] down 80% and uh the fundamentals are
[1708.88s] actually beginning to improve and is not
[1710.64s] yet reflected I don&#39;t quite see that
[1713.36s] just yet churn rate of the largest US
[1716.679s] companies has increased the average
[1718.48s] company tenure on S&amp;P 500 Index 7year
[1722.48s] rolling average and what this says the
[1725.36s] implication from the Financial Times
[1729.84s] article is that the company seeks cease
[1732.32s] to exist I think the opposite is true I
[1736.159s] think the problem is is private Equity
[1739.32s] has been allocated too much money
[1741.679s] because they Mark to make make believe
[1743.559s] they don&#39;t have to mark to Market so
[1745.72s] pension managers like the even marks
[1749.039s] because they get to keep their jobs
[1750.559s] because they don&#39;t have to mark to
[1751.519s] Market every day and um so you&#39;ve gotten
[1754.919s] all this private Equity money and all
[1756.559s] they can do with it is continue to take
[1759.64s] companies private off the exchanges then
[1763.0s] lever them up and then refloat them back
[1766.2s] on the exchanges and candidly destroy a
[1769.84s] lot of them that they over lever in the
[1771.559s] interim so that&#39;s kind of why You See It
[1773.64s] trending down but I think a lot of this
[1776.279s] trend has a lot to do with um private
[1780.12s] equities involvement the other thing
[1782.32s] that it has to do with you can see here
[1784.279s] when it really collapsed is after
[1785.84s] sarbanes Oxley you had lower highs uh
[1789.679s] that
[1790.48s] destroyed the capital formation business
[1793.519s] in the US and the ability for smaller
[1795.44s] companies to list earlier like we had
[1797.279s] had historically
[1798.679s] hopefully Trump one could not get that
[1800.64s] done I know cudow was working on it uh
[1803.559s] hopefully Trump 2 can reverse some of
[1806.0s] the uh bad aspects of sarbanes Oxley
[1808.84s] that will enable more smaller companies
[1810.88s] to lift quickly and reduce public
[1813.36s] company costs and
[1815.12s] compliance uh leverage loans defaults
[1818.2s] climb to four-year
[1820.36s] high so that&#39;s something to keep in mind
[1823.0s] a lot of crappy loans out there that you
[1825.159s] have to keep in mind C Conference board
[1828.36s] consumer confidence turned down this
[1831.159s] week which was kind of interesting uh
[1833.76s] consumer expectations turned down so you
[1836.84s] know regardless of what side of the
[1838.48s] aisle you&#39;re on uh little surprise there
[1841.399s] for people
[1845.039s] to keep in mind uh that
[1849.0s] um I think people are in the show me
[1851.399s] State of Mind initial exuberance and now
[1853.64s] it&#39;s like show me China car production
[1856.639s] share went from 1% to 39% in the last 20
[1861.279s] years us went from 15% down to 3% asleep
[1866.0s] at the wheel while we&#39;re having Union
[1868.799s] fights they&#39;re producing cars and eating
[1872.6s] our lunch so um Japan doesn&#39;t face that
[1877.039s] they&#39;ve been able to keep share Europe
[1879.08s] is collapsing they used to have 35%
[1881.2s] share they dropped to about 133% share
[1884.12s] so um continue to make it hard for
[1887.12s] manufacturing to get energy continue to
[1889.84s] over regulate continue
[1892.159s] to
[1895.08s] uh do things that are against the the
[1899.639s] idea of staying competitive and you&#39;re
[1901.24s] going to see more and more of these type
[1903.32s] of things although I think the next four
[1905.72s] years is going to arrest this at least
[1909.48s] temporarily uh until the trend resumes
[1912.76s] sentiment for healthc care stocks is
[1914.679s] washed out we spent a whole two hours on
[1917.039s] this last week you can see another
[1919.2s] visualization you can see the 12mth
[1921.2s] forward PE
[1922.6s] ratio uh this is like shooting ducks in
[1925.96s] the barrel so whether it&#39;s xbi which we
[1929.279s] love and own whether it&#39;s Baxter which
[1931.559s] we love here and own which we covered
[1933.36s] last week uh again you know for those of
[1935.96s] you who&#39;ve been around we spend 80% of
[1938.159s] the time on the ones that haven&#39;t let
[1940.159s] left the station and less than 20% of
[1943.12s] the time you&#39;re lucky if you get 10 or
[1944.679s] 20% a week uh celebrating winners that
[1948.399s] that doesn&#39;t provide if you take care of
[1951.639s] the downside the upside takes care of
[1953.48s] itself and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done
[1955.32s] since day one and I think people have
[1957.24s] found that extremely valuable so if
[1960.399s] you&#39;re not looking in the health care
[1962.2s] sector you&#39;re missing an enormous
[1964.32s] opportunity in
[1967.84s] 2025 uh high yield Bond volume so this
[1971.96s] is just ramping up high yield
[1974.36s] refinancings are going to accelerate
[1977.44s] because they&#39;re priced off the shorter
[1978.96s] end of the curve expect to see big stuff
[1981.36s] in q1 and
[1983.2s] Q2 uh and I think uh Cooper standard
[1986.12s] will have an opportunity to refinance a
[1987.919s] lot at lower levels especially if and
[1990.399s] when they report free cash flow positive
[1993.0s] in the fourth quarter which they should
[1995.12s] be able to with a November SAR
[1997.84s] annualized at
[1999.44s] 16.5 and estimates for the industry at
[2002.519s] 16.3 which we covered last week
[2004.84s] conservatively they could generate $4 of
[2006.84s] earnings if those conservative estimates
[2008.6s] are correct about industry volumes
[2010.48s] because everything after 15.8 goes
[2013.159s] straight to the bottom line and that&#39;s
[2014.6s] why we got involved with the trade when
[2016.48s] it was below 153 because of the
[2018.72s] operating leverage in the business it&#39;s
[2020.519s] just magnificent so yield curve has
[2024.559s] uninverted and stayed uninverted uh
[2028.0s] world&#39;s top automobile manufactured by
[2030.08s] sales I mean look what&#39;s happened to
[2032.12s] America and now you&#39;re going to have
[2034.0s] Nissan and Honda combined so effectively
[2036.84s] other than Suzuki which I I thought they
[2039.12s] made water skis I didn&#39;t even know they
[2041.0s] made cars uh jet skis rather
[2046.48s] um Stanis General Motors and Ford fall
[2050.0s] to the bottom of the list Hyundai motor
[2051.919s] and Kia who filled the need with the
[2054.2s] smaller cars is eating their lunch uh
[2056.639s] and Toyota is number one here are the
[2060.159s] top all-time favorite Christmas movies
[2063.359s] this is from Deutsche Bank uh Home Alone
[2066.44s] di hard love Love Actually It&#39;s a
[2068.839s] Wonderful Life elf National Lampoons
[2071.32s] Christmas Vacation might have to roll
[2073.159s] that out tonight on Christmas Eve
[2075.0s] National lamp Lampoon Christmas Vacation
[2077.119s] with the girls expose them to what real
[2079.919s] comedy is with Chevy Chase uh that&#39;ll be
[2083.2s] pretty awesome I will probably get out
[2085.52s] voted and wind up watching Home Alone
[2087.56s] too but
[2090.119s] uh such as
[2093.119s] life moving on after lagging for most of
[2096.48s] the second half 20 24 big Tech and mag 7
[2099.24s] have outperformed the average stock in
[2100.64s] December so this was just a CA change
[2103.0s] that came after the election a
[2105.04s] short-term thing we saw the exact same
[2107.32s] thing in 2016 after the election and
[2109.72s] before the
[2112.839s] inauguration no way to hedge against
[2115.119s] that short-term move you just get it all
[2117.359s] on the back end in q1 and two Q2 gains
[2120.119s] of next
[2121.16s] year if you try to hedge you you create
[2124.92s] unnecessary tax events and then if
[2126.72s] someone else gets elected
[2128.48s] uh you&#39;re completely on the wrong side
[2130.04s] twice you created tax liability and you
[2133.44s] missed the upside so you know you just
[2135.68s] have to ride it through the beauty is
[2137.72s] you all get you always get back to the
[2140.599s] expected Trend uh it&#39;s just delayed to
[2143.28s] you know in this case a couple of months
[2144.92s] and then this will catch back up huge
[2147.56s] and uh be very exciting net profit
[2149.64s] margins continue to accelerate this is
[2153.079s] from fax set via Seth golden and expect
[2157.92s] margins net profit margins go from 12
[2161.0s] 12% this year to 13% next year so that&#39;s
[2164.28s] you know expanding margins is the
[2166.0s] mother&#39;s milk I mean earnings and
[2167.599s] margins is the name of the game here&#39;s
[2169.8s] from Zack tan who has been a longtime
[2172.8s] follower and um multiple time caller uh
[2177.96s] he posted on VF Corp he says I
[2180.28s] understand the oah effect of Kim
[2181.4s] cardashian
[2182.48s] resulting in the uh The North Face and
[2186.319s] skims collaboration selling out within
[2188.599s] minutes but did you know that Vans
[2190.52s] offthe wall had two releases last week
[2192.68s] and it sold out quickly as well uh
[2195.48s] they&#39;ve collaborated with Street Wear
[2197.119s] label rooted in
[2198.96s] B bike
[2202.319s] culture
[2203.839s] so these look cool by the way I mean out
[2206.76s] here in California I&#39;m you know seven
[2208.8s] blocks from the beach we walk there all
[2210.28s] the time uh everyone wears Vans and and
[2213.76s] now I actually fit in I was like the
[2215.2s] only guy wearing my green I&#39;ve got the
[2217.079s] green stands and I got the the low comfy
[2220.839s] cush and I got the same ones in white
[2223.88s] with green so I got green all green and
[2226.8s] I got the white with green um but
[2229.8s] everyone wears these and these are super
[2232.319s] popular um I mean even the golf pro
[2234.96s] wears Vans it&#39;s mindboggling uh at the
[2237.24s] country club like every everyone out
[2239.359s] here so I&#39;m excited to go back to New
[2242.04s] York in early January for to do a few
[2244.64s] days of media to walk down Fifth Avenue
[2247.319s] and see if it&#39;s actually spreading
[2249.119s] Beyond Orange County
[2250.88s] California uh because uh it looks like
[2253.8s] it the Stock&#39;s up a lot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s
[2255.8s] really moving in the right direction
[2257.76s] this is from Charlie Bello talking about
[2260.16s] new highs this is the average returns
[2264.44s] you see the bulk of them are 0 to 10 10
[2268.68s] to 20 20 to 30 and you can get a sense
[2271.839s] of the bell curve of returns since
[2274.92s] 1928 here&#39;s Emerging Markets
[2278.48s] total returns relative to the us so you
[2281.96s] can see Emerging Markets
[2283.68s] outperformed uh in the 80s and 90s us uh
[2288.319s] outperformed in 95 to 98 and then in 2
[2293.2s] to 2010 Emerging Markets crushed the US
[2297.2s] for a decade and then in uh then us
[2301.48s] crushed emerging markets for the next
[2303.88s] decade and I think you&#39;re going to start
[2305.599s] to see Emerging Markets crush the US
[2307.52s] once again for the next uh handful of
[2309.839s] years uh S&amp;P 500 waiting of the top 10
[2313.359s] Holdings this is going all the way back
[2316.28s] and you know you saw these peaks in 1980
[2320.2s] we know what happened next 2000 we know
[2322.56s] what happened next uh 2020 we did see
[2327.16s] the big Tech correction in
[2330.0s] 2022 I think we could see something in
[2333.16s] that line not the
[2335.24s] 1999 uh type but something maybe a
[2338.72s] little bit more mild than
[2340.839s] 2022 but definitely an underperformance
[2343.4s] and a consolidation in 2025 in my view
[2346.92s] Apple price to sales ratio this is kind
[2349.079s] of interesting as well uh Apple&#39;s
[2352.04s] trading at 10 times sales with like I I
[2354.119s] haven&#39;t even looked at it lately but
[2355.56s] probably 5% earnings growth um forget
[2358.839s] about the PE multiple relative to you
[2361.4s] know the PEG
[2362.44s] ratio
[2364.359s] um so this is all multiple expansion and
[2368.56s] this is all financed by the week Yen and
[2372.16s] I could talk about this on TV and and
[2374.079s] they would give me 2 seconds because no
[2375.68s] one wants to hear about this it&#39;s too
[2377.56s] complicated
[2379.319s] but I think the most important thing you
[2382.04s] have to pay attention to in
[2384.48s] 2025 is the Japanese Yen and as you see
[2389.319s] that appreciate I as the bank of Japan
[2394.56s] tries to raise rates because they&#39;re
[2395.92s] going to be forced to from
[2399.4s] or uh you start to see the Yen going up
[2402.8s] every perent the Yen moves up I would
[2404.96s] say the mag s basket&#39;s going to move
[2406.92s] down 2% if not more because there&#39;s just
[2409.48s] so much leverage the amount that they&#39;re
[2411.0s] borrowing to buy these mag seven stocks
[2413.44s] and you&#39;re just seeing it in the
[2414.4s] multiple expansion so if you think it&#39;s
[2416.0s] like ah us exceptionalism blah blah blah
[2418.359s] yeah there there&#39;s that
[2422.24s] but tell me that continues to hold true
[2425.56s] when the carry trade unwind and I&#39;ll
[2428.24s] tell you good luck with that idea uh
[2431.64s] here&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million
[2434.52s] to a billion in the last two weeks so uh
[2438.44s] this this is not the environment where
[2440.28s] high quality businesses that are marked
[2442.119s] down
[2443.0s] outperform uh this is when people want
[2446.119s] fart coin so God bless them uh when the
[2448.96s] calendar flips good luck uh AMC
[2452.64s] entertainment same type of thing we saw
[2454.72s] what happens when people chase that
[2456.28s] stuff it doesn&#39;t end
[2461.079s] well Peter Lynch second quote the most
[2463.68s] important organ in the body as far as
[2465.359s] the stock market is concerned is the
[2466.76s] guts not the head anyone can acquire
[2468.68s] knowhow for analyzing stocks that&#39;s from
[2470.92s] Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why you know
[2472.28s] people always ask me why do you why do
[2473.76s] you share so many of your secrets blah
[2475.28s] blah blah and I said I could I could
[2478.48s] number
[2480.0s] one I share a lot but I don&#39;t share
[2482.48s] everything number two
[2485.88s] uh I could could give 100% of the
[2489.079s] Playbook every single week and write a
[2492.28s] book step by step and at the end of the
[2494.92s] day it couldn&#39;t be replicated because of
[2498.079s] the intangible of understanding the
[2500.64s] emotions of the market and the only way
[2502.0s] you get that uh and you get the pattern
[2504.839s] recognition and you get the ice in your
[2506.76s] veins one one is it&#39;s genetic that&#39;s
[2509.119s] just period so you have to be part of
[2511.119s] this 1% of oddballs that that are just
[2513.72s] wired this way and number
[2516.079s] two uh
[2518.119s] um it&#39;s experience you know it&#39;s it&#39;s
[2521.04s] just experience and I&#39;ll be uh I&#39;ll be
[2525.4s] it&#39;s it&#39;s the only business it&#39;s like
[2527.119s] age you get better with age I mean
[2528.76s] Buffett if you look at Buffett&#39;s net
[2530.48s] worth I think his biggest gains happened
[2534.2s] between like percentage gains happened
[2537.079s] between age like 70 and 90 or something
[2540.839s] along those lines so because you it&#39;s
[2544.76s] just as money compounds knowledge
[2546.44s] compounds so so um so that&#39;s that moving
[2550.72s] along materials are the worst performer
[2552.28s] in the S&amp;P 500 what 2025 holds for this
[2555.559s] beaten down
[2556.92s] sector I want to just jump ahead
[2561.4s] here
[2563.24s] to reiterate that with
[2566.44s] facts so okay Tech has priced in 23%
[2571.839s] expected earnings growth for next year
[2574.64s] they&#39;ve priced in a lot of that with the
[2576.2s] valuation healthare is priced in none of
[2578.559s] that the multiples compressed they&#39;re
[2580.599s] going to grow earnings at about 21 20.6%
[2584.44s] next year so we got to we got to get
[2586.44s] even I mean we got a big position in xbi
[2589.28s] we&#39;ve got baxer maybe maybe I&#39;ll get try
[2592.119s] to find one more uh industrial is going
[2594.96s] to grow 19% we&#39;ve got plenty of exposure
[2597.319s] to that Stanley Black and&amp; Decker gener
[2600.4s] the whole you know Boeing is rocking and
[2602.559s] rolling uh Cooper standard so we&#39;re good
[2605.359s] there materials we got stock which is
[2608.92s] technically it&#39;s it&#39;s not really in that
[2611.48s] bucket but it is uh and albam Maro so we
[2615.319s] got some exposure there maybe want a
[2616.839s] little more com services so these are
[2619.44s] all going to out earn the S&amp;P
[2621.44s] 500 uh
[2624.119s] and God by the way there are there are a
[2626.839s] number of chemical and plastic stocks
[2629.04s] that I am just salivating chomping at
[2633.0s] the bid at as well there&#39;s a lot to do
[2636.04s] in the material space
[2638.0s] as soon as this calendar clicks which is
[2639.72s] why I&#39;m opening up early so that people
[2642.96s] that have been reaching out that are
[2644.48s] getting their applications done get
[2646.119s] approved by gen one we can put money to
[2647.839s] work right away and not miss this uh by
[2650.52s] waiting till after the
[2651.88s] inauguration so that is
[2657.4s] that all
[2664.599s] right uh let&#39;s see
[2672.48s] okay xlb began this is from
[2677.599s] bti XL xlb began that&#39;s the materials
[2681.079s] ETF began trading in 1998 and over that
[2684.559s] time there have only been 14 other days
[2687.52s] when the RSI was below 20 as it just hit
[2691.04s] uh last Thursday average returns 15 days
[2694.04s] later were up 5.5% with only one failure
[2697.44s] this is from Jonathan krinsky that&#39;s
[2699.52s] bdig history says to step in here and
[2702.4s] look for at least some tactical upside
[2704.0s] reversion meanwhile since 1990 the S&amp;P
[2707.04s] material sectors had never been down for
[2709.72s] consecutive years see the table below
[2711.72s] the sector Advanced over 10% last year
[2714.16s] before heading for negative returns in
[2715.64s] 2024 it&#39;s also worth noting that its
[2718.52s] average annual return following a down
[2721.16s] year has been
[2723.4s] 20.43% since 1990 with only one year up
[2728.28s] less than 10% said krinsky this is this
[2731.359s] is key guys how this didn&#39;t make it to
[2734.559s] my pod charts list is beyond me but at
[2738.599s] least we got it
[2741.96s] um look at this so we just have a
[2745.76s] negative return the following year 21%
[2748.48s] 22% in 2000 it was only up 1% the the
[2751.96s] rest of the market was getting monkey
[2753.64s] hammered and it was still a positive
[2755.68s] 2022 34 4% 20 2008 by the way 20 2002
[2760.88s] what is that right after uh 2003
[2765.44s] rather it was up
[2769.4s] 34.76 per in 2003 2009 45% 2012 I mean
[2775.2s] this and
[2777.319s] materials where&#39;s my notebook I gotta
[2780.96s] get even more exposure and I got the
[2782.8s] names I already have the names I just
[2784.359s] got to find the space and not get too
[2786.68s] over
[2788.44s] Overexposed materials and Healthcare I I
[2791.079s] mean I&#39;m doing this stuff this is part
[2793.28s] of my process I went through so many
[2795.92s] stocks this weekend and I played so much
[2798.16s] golf that&#39;s that&#39;s my idea of fun stocks
[2801.28s] and golf in that order uh all
[2806.0s] right Intel gets a much needed
[2815.64s] win okay
[2821.68s] okay fin Lo down billions so they got
[2824.319s] their grants which we know uh 8 billion
[2826.8s] bucks there&#39;s one more piece of good
[2828.079s] news for Intel as it comes to a close
[2829.52s] the company&#39;s second generation discret
[2832.599s] graphics cards appear to be a hit at
[2835.0s] least compared to its inaugural effort
[2837.04s] Intel put a ton of work over the past
[2838.48s] two years fixing the Myriad of problems
[2839.88s] that plagued entry into the market and
[2842.2s] it now appears to have a winner on its
[2845.16s] hands The Verge report on Tuesday that
[2847.72s] Intel&#39;s b580 graphics cards which is
[2850.079s] priced at$ 249 and generally outperforms
[2852.28s] the price of your options from both
[2854.52s] Nvidia and AMD is selling out at
[2857.76s] retailers selling out like Vans like
[2861.24s] Intel B 580 chip
[2865.04s] unbelievable um a quick look on Amazon
[2868.119s] shows that ship dates for the card have
[2870.16s] slipped to January it&#39;s currently sold
[2872.44s] out on New Egg I don&#39;t even know what
[2874.839s] new egg is but those of you who are into
[2876.68s] that that stuff do uh spokesperson told
[2879.8s] The Verge that demand for the b580 has
[2882.24s] been high and many retailers have sold
[2884.319s] out of their initial stock the company
[2886.319s] expects to provide weekly replenishments
[2888.44s] of The Limited Edition version that it
[2890.24s] sells
[2891.96s] directly so there you go ladies and
[2894.2s] gentlemen I&#39;m telling you kelinger
[2897.28s] actually did everything that he said he
[2898.8s] was going to do the market just couldn&#39;t
[2900.64s] wait and the board members didn&#39;t want
[2902.16s] to lose their 300 grand for showing up
[2904.119s] for four meetings a year so uh they had
[2906.92s] to can him but the the the the process
[2909.88s] is set in place he did his five nodes in
[2913.04s] four years he did all that stuff and uh
[2915.64s] and we&#39;re going to get the benefits of
[2916.96s] it so uh us natural gas consumption
[2920.16s] reaches new highs driven by electric
[2922.559s] power sector so that&#39;s com stock fed&#39;s
[2925.64s] favorite inflation Gates cools to
[2927.559s] slowest Pace since May that was Friday
[2930.4s] after they revised the Dot Plot not
[2932.24s] before Boeing wins $36 billion deal from
[2934.72s] Turkey trumping airb
[2937.28s] yeeha ladies and Gentlemen The Game&#39;s
[2939.0s] back on from 137 to 180 in the blink of
[2941.72s] an eye and why it&#39;s going to keep
[2944.28s] crocking is because no one is talking
[2946.359s] about it and no one&#39;s talking about it
[2948.28s] because no one bought it at 137 when we
[2950.4s] were pounding the table 160 150 130
[2954.16s] couldn&#39;t buy enough it&#39;s it&#39;s very very
[2958.28s] very very big I think in terms of
[2961.88s] stock it&#39;s in Baba neighborhood and in
[2966.16s] terms of options is even more so that&#39;s
[2968.44s] going to continue to
[2969.88s] work
[2971.52s] um China shorter yield syn to two decade
[2975.359s] low as Bond fever uh blows we covered
[2978.319s] this chart and why that&#39;s actually good
[2980.119s] news not bad news Alibaba splits AI team
[2982.4s] to sharpen consumer and business so
[2984.599s] they&#39;re focusing on both markets and
[2987.079s] dominating from Nike to Intel CEO
[2989.92s] departures at us companies hit a record
[2991.92s] this year that&#39;s turnaround City ladies
[2994.2s] and gentlemen I love it all you can just
[2996.799s] look for you know Boeing Kelly ortberg
[3000.28s] we love Intel we&#39;re going to find out
[3002.119s] that&#39;ll be the next Catalyst in the
[3003.599s] stock Starbucks we missed but it&#39;s fine
[3007.359s] Nike is going to be another winner
[3010.839s] Pelon uh
[3012.839s] Kohl&#39;s and WWE International hard pass
[3016.48s] all right so that&#39;s white Weight
[3018.079s] Watchers dividend stocks are primed for
[3019.799s] a comeback in 20125 we couldn&#39;t agree
[3024.2s] more a lot of our stocks fall in that
[3026.4s] buck it Nike unveils its new CEO
[3029.04s] turnaround plan I think that&#39;s going to
[3031.64s] work but we&#39;re we&#39;re happy with uh
[3033.48s] betting on Bracken Neil Cavuto leaving
[3036.44s] Fox News after 28 years he says I got to
[3039.92s] do what I love to do this guy was the
[3043.4s] definition of class uh he was a very
[3046.52s] balanced journalist he was a super
[3050.72s] highquality human being um I had become
[3054.72s] started to become a regular on his show
[3056.799s] in the last four or five months uh and
[3059.52s] really enjoyed that and really loved he
[3061.76s] didn&#39;t he often did remote guests it was
[3064.4s] rare he would do in person and the fact
[3066.599s] that I got to do in person with him
[3068.16s] every you know three four weeks was
[3070.96s] really an honor and I really enjoyed and
[3072.92s] he would give me a lot of time he&#39;d give
[3074.44s] me like seven minutes 7 to 10 minutes
[3077.16s] and really Grill and try to get the
[3079.359s] information I I&#39;m really going to miss
[3081.2s] that uh Gonna Miss watching him gonna
[3084.16s] miss being on his show think that uh
[3087.68s] you&#39;re probably going to hear more from
[3089.44s] Neil Cavuto I don&#39;t know what his next
[3091.4s] chapter is but I&#39;m sure it will be uh
[3094.28s] something you know phenomenal just like
[3096.68s] his last chapter 28 years is a long time
[3099.119s] to do anything and uh you know
[3102.119s] congratulations to him on a really
[3106.04s] unusually successful career over many
[3109.72s] decades you know it&#39;s one thing to make
[3112.04s] it for 6 months or 12 months and have 5
[3114.28s] minutes of fame when you get out two
[3116.68s] years three years five years uh and in
[3119.799s] his case 28 years there&#39;s some
[3121.799s] durability about what you&#39;re doing
[3123.599s] there&#39;s some value that you&#39;re bringing
[3125.559s] and in a super competitive atmosphere uh
[3129.24s] he brought it and continuously delivered
[3132.4s] and I&#39;m just grateful to even have
[3134.64s] gotten to know him for the short number
[3136.799s] of months that uh we had been connected

[3177.839s] I thought this was going to be a short
[3179.16s] episode all right uh that&#39;s going to be
[3182.2s] good for banks all right Rond says
[3184.319s] holding back China in the chips race is
[3185.96s] a Fool&#39;s errand we actually agree with
[3188.48s] cooler than expected PC with the FED do
[3191.44s] plot had been different uh it doesn&#39;t
[3194.0s] matter they can adjust it incoming
[3195.559s] meetings the key is they didn&#39;t blink
[3198.04s] they&#39;ve got a 100 bips of cuts in
[3201.119s] everything works on a lagged effect I
[3202.68s] think they&#39;ll probably wait till at
[3203.88s] least March and that&#39;s just fine hedge
[3206.24s] fun pile into trades dollar Yen will
[3209.319s] rise as high as 165 so this is exactly
[3213.16s] when you want to take the other side
[3215.28s] when hedge funds are all crowded into
[3217.2s] one boat short Yen long dollar they&#39;re
[3220.28s] going to get their faces ripped off and
[3222.0s] that&#39;s going to happen in q1 and Q2 one
[3224.64s] growth stock down 44% to buy right now
[3227.4s] guess what it is Disney ladies and
[3229.44s] gentlemen couldn&#39;t give it away in the
[3231.16s] 80s everyone wants it up here it&#39;s just
[3233.48s] beginning on to the next this fed
[3235.68s] crushed the stock Market where to find
[3237.599s] the best value now this is from Jacob
[3243.359s] sonshine
[3247.0s] uh okay pure value ETF trades at 10
[3249.96s] times 12 Monon forward earnings well
[3252.079s] below the 22 uh times pure
[3255.4s] growth oh now may be a time to play
[3258.359s] catchup a broad group of value stocks
[3260.92s] tracked by sentiment Trader senior
[3262.52s] analyst Jason goord is he&#39;s worth a
[3265.44s] follow on um X is near its lowest level
[3269.96s] versus growth in over two decades the
[3273.16s] last time relative prices were at these
[3276.119s] levels in was in the early 2000s value
[3279.599s] stocks went on to outperform growth in
[3281.92s] the coming years there is more evidence
[3284.319s] that a skew towards value and away from
[3285.76s] growth makes sense now more than ever
[3288.68s] before
[3292.37s] [Music]
[3295.119s] um and they&#39;re talking about so you got
[3297.68s] it
[3299.24s] uh he&#39;s talking about margin
[3304.24s] expansion and how the pure value ETF
[3308.359s] grows earnings at a 177% clip next year
[3311.92s] relative to growth which is also going
[3315.24s] to grow earnings at 177% next year the
[3317.44s] difference is is one is trading at 10
[3319.04s] times and one&#39;s trading at 2022 times so
[3322.28s] one&#39;s a 2.2 Peg and one&#39;s a one peg and
[3325.96s] when you can can buy a basket out of one
[3328.119s] peg with earnings growth it&#39;s a formula
[3330.079s] for Success great article by Jacob sonin
[3332.88s] shine good dude and great journalist uh
[3336.799s] Baba officially launches operations in
[3339.24s] Morocco marking the first stop in Africa
[3342.96s] ladies and gentlemen whole new continent
[3345.599s] whole new opportunity just getting
[3347.72s] started small cap stocks get hit again
[3350.4s] be
[3351.4s] patient
[3353.28s] and I&#39;m looking for the quote here
[3362.48s] all
[3363.319s] right third Corner okay Wall Street
[3368.079s] analyst forecast profit for small cap
[3370.2s] companies to increase
[3371.68s] 16% ahead of the 15% growth analyst
[3374.44s] predict for larger companies and small
[3375.96s] caps are significantly cheaper S&amp;P 600
[3378.44s] trades at 15 times next year&#39;s profit
[3380.72s] compared to 22 times for the S&amp;P 500
[3383.559s] listen ladies and gentlemen price is
[3385.4s] what you pay value is what you get so
[3387.68s] you can buy value at 10 times with 177%
[3391.039s] earnings growth or you can buy growth at
[3393.799s] 22 times with 17% earnings growth or you
[3396.359s] can buy small caps at um 15 times with
[3401.28s] uh 16% earnings growth or you can buy
[3404.079s] the S&amp;P with 177% for 22 times and and
[3408.92s] pric is what you pay value is what you
[3410.119s] get then if you get into Emerging
[3411.72s] Markets like Baba you know and you get
[3414.24s] things trading at 8 n times his lows
[3416.88s] opportunities of a sentury then you&#39;re
[3418.72s] off to the races and it&#39;s all going to
[3420.44s] go back to I think the name of the game
[3423.0s] is going to be yes you going to have the
[3424.559s] inauguration you&#39;re going to have all
[3425.68s] that stuff uh but you&#39;re also going to
[3428.359s] have the bank of Japan and if you keep
[3430.0s] your eye on those two things a lot of
[3431.599s] great things are going to happen in a
[3433.0s] very short amount of time and the
[3435.24s] question is are you going to be
[3436.559s] positioned for it uh this contrarian
[3439.119s] investor says the tech bubble&#39;s getting
[3440.72s] s scary here&#39;s his game plan you know
[3443.119s] this is a sensationalist thing that he&#39;s
[3446.24s] calling for a 50% correction in the mag
[3448.24s] 7 I think that&#39;s going to be wrong as
[3450.599s] well
[3457.16s] um but
[3461.4s] um you know he takes you know he&#39;s
[3463.72s] comparing the AI bubble to the new
[3465.24s] economy bubble to the covid
[3469.88s] uh bubble
[3472.0s] Etc
[3474.039s] uh I think it again I think it&#39;s just
[3476.64s] going to be a more
[3479.799s] subdued normalization than what you saw
[3482.92s] in 2022 in Tech and it could just mean
[3485.24s] they grind sideways and consolidate but
[3487.24s] more likely than not I think we&#39;ll see
[3488.799s] some of them pull back a bit uh CEOs
[3492.16s] quitting we covered Chinese investors by
[3494.359s] record amounts of Hong Kong stocks via
[3496.44s] the stock link this is what we covered
[3498.64s] Mainland Traders bought $778 billion
[3502.319s] Hong Kong dollars of stocks Alibaba and
[3505.16s] Bank of China were the most bought
[3507.559s] shares that is going to continue here&#39;s
[3510.52s] the chart ladies and gentlemen you
[3512.24s] haven&#39;t seen anything like that since
[3513.599s] 2020 and they ried from 2020 to
[3517.119s] 2022 and then uh uh you can&#39;t see back
[3520.88s] to 16 but you can see that it was up
[3522.839s] there and um and then we got the big
[3525.64s] rally into
[3526.88s] 2018 so that is a new buyer that&#39;s come
[3530.16s] in and it&#39;s new it&#39;s only it&#39;s been less
[3532.039s] than a
[3533.0s] year Munich Reed Scoops up Park Avenue
[3535.72s] Tower for half a billion so the
[3537.16s] commercial game is back on for the high
[3538.88s] level the year of the ugly shoe what&#39;s
[3541.24s] next for on Deckers and Crocs so these
[3543.319s] ones outperformed while um Nike and vans
[3549.799s] uh Vans underperformed the beginning of
[3551.92s] the year and has really started to come
[3553.64s] back I think Vans has some incredible
[3556.079s] looking shoes and uh all the clients out
[3558.92s] there you know exactly how incredible
[3561.48s] they are in person uh I&#39;m sure you all
[3564.559s] got your boxes by now
[3566.76s] and uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty
[3569.28s] exciting if you see if you see people
[3572.359s] walking around in
[3574.599s] green uh low comfy cush uh shoes they&#39;re
[3580.24s] probably a decamillionaire senta
[3582.16s] millionaire or billionaire there never
[3584.48s] before has fans had more
[3588.0s] decamillionaires senta millionaires and
[3589.92s] billionaires walking around in green
[3592.44s] Vans shoes than uh in the month of
[3595.359s] December after we uh let loose our our
[3597.839s] holiday gifts so um so the next time you
[3600.96s] see someone in green Vans just be like
[3603.24s] hm I wonder if that&#39;s a centimillionaire
[3604.88s] or a billionaire it&#39;s uh it&#39;s one of
[3606.72s] great Hill capital&#39;s clients is wearing
[3608.64s] vans so after years of going big
[3611.799s] American car buyers are downsizing to
[3613.92s] smaller ones we talked about that a year
[3616.119s] and a half ago that was going to happen
[3618.64s] they weren&#39;t going to get away with this
[3620.079s] selling above MSRP controlling Supply if
[3623.319s] they didn&#39;t provide the supply others
[3625.079s] would and now we&#39;re getting the volumes
[3626.76s] we&#39;re getting the incentives we&#39;re
[3627.92s] getting the inventories it&#39;s going to be
[3629.64s] an exciting exciting year busted thieves
[3631.96s] baffled by new laws in California that
[3634.359s] makes shoplifting a felony uh and what&#39;s
[3637.799s] so exciting is so this is Seal Beach
[3641.039s] Police Department in Orange County it&#39;s
[3642.52s] probably about 10 15 minutes away and
[3648.76s] um uh I guess when they were in the back
[3651.4s] of the police car talking to each other
[3654.52s] the one girl said to the other
[3657.799s] new laws stealing is a felony they
[3661.44s] don&#39;t play around here in Orange County
[3663.76s] so yeah this is Orange County
[3666.76s] bch they don&#39;t play lamented the alleged
[3670.44s] thief and that&#39;s right I mean it&#39;s uh
[3673.039s] there are a couple towns here in Orange
[3675.64s] County that uh don&#39;t play games I happen
[3678.64s] to live in one of them and uh and you
[3681.2s] can just see the reflected it&#39;s a big
[3683.039s] contrast between where they actually
[3684.68s] have rule of law and where they don&#39;t uh
[3686.88s] one you can walk around to the beach you
[3688.559s] can let your kids walk the dogs wherever
[3691.119s] and not worry about it and the others uh
[3693.319s] you never know what you&#39;re going to get
[3694.64s] so all right why the dogs of the Dow
[3697.119s] just might deliver in 2025 that&#39;s Al
[3700.16s] root uh the dogs for this year that&#39;s
[3703.24s] the thesis that you take the highest
[3705.52s] yielding stock five highest yielding
[3707.319s] stocks at the end of the year and they
[3709.039s] tend to outperform the next year so
[3710.88s] Verizon Chevron amen Johnson and Johnson
[3713.48s] MK Coca-Cola IBM Cisco McDonald&#39;s
[3715.96s] Proctor and Gamble I think uh I think
[3718.319s] Johnson John I think these Healthcare
[3719.799s] ones are really interesting Johnson
[3721.44s] Johnson Amgen MK look I think oil is
[3724.599s] bottoming out here I don&#39;t love the
[3726.279s] valuations enough to get super involved
[3728.319s] I think chevron&#39;s going to be right uh
[3730.68s] Coca-Cola is getting interesting and
[3732.24s] Pepsi I I think that&#39;s
[3734.119s] overdone uh haven&#39;t looked at IBM CIS
[3738.599s] Cisco probably McDonald&#39;s I got to just
[3741.599s] see how much that&#39;s come in and Proctor
[3743.0s] and Gamble I mean I&#39;ve had my eye on all
[3744.64s] these even Verizon to a lesser extent so
[3747.359s] I think that&#39;s interesting um 3M was on
[3750.599s] the list remember we took that thing
[3752.599s] straight up and booked our profits by
[3754.96s] the way it hasn&#39;t moved much since we
[3756.72s] booked our profits it hasn&#39;t moved much
[3758.44s] in half a year so we&#39;re pretty happy
[3761.559s] with that one if that one ever came back
[3762.92s] down we would reconsider getting
[3764.24s] involved again but that was a nice win
[3766.119s] portfolio manager names Chinese and
[3767.76s] European stocks promising strong returns
[3769.96s] despite Market uncertainty he&#39;s talking
[3771.92s] about the stimulus he&#39;s talking uh first
[3774.44s] off they they did in November a 5year
[3777.52s] stimulus totaling 10 trillion Yuan 1.3
[3781.64s] trillion us now they&#39;re doing this $400
[3785.0s] billion uh direct stimulus for straight
[3787.76s] to Consumers China moles record $411
[3791.119s] billion special bonds uh for money will
[3794.079s] fund consumer subsidies this will be the
[3796.4s] first consumption driven direct stimulus
[3800.68s] in the pockets ladies and gentlemen and
[3803.0s] yet people are sleep at the wheel has
[3806.24s] gotten bit a little bit in the last
[3807.64s] couple of days on that basis but nowhere
[3809.96s] near what&#39;s going to take place plan
[3812.039s] special bonds amidst vows to
[3815.72s] spend okay so Chinese plan special bonds
[3820.039s] amid vows to spend so they&#39;re getting
[3822.359s] serious this is from Brendan Ahern first
[3826.76s] support the expansion of domestic
[3829.72s] demand mainland China had a media had a
[3833.16s] significant coverage of the National
[3835.039s] Financial work conference conclusion and
[3837.4s] subsequent Ministry of Finance release
[3839.76s] stating quote more proactive fiscal
[3843.52s] policies should be implemented the
[3845.88s] positive release outlines six areas of
[3847.559s] focus for 2025 and the first one and the
[3850.039s] fact that the first one are
[3852.64s] key I&#39;m doing The Bold and underline
[3855.559s] through mof&#39;s website as they used uh
[3859.319s] bold on the first bullet a clear
[3861.44s] indication they are telling us something
[3863.559s] not to be missed here&#39;s the first bu
[3865.72s] bullet quote First support the expansion
[3868.88s] of domestic demand expanding pensions
[3871.52s] and medical insurance were included
[3873.119s] remember that China&#39;s high saving rate
[3875.2s] is driven by the lack of social safety
[3876.72s] net the goal is to vigorously the goal
[3879.119s] is to quote vigorously boost
[3883.52s] consumption vigorously boost consumption
[3886.64s] so that&#39;s that ignore it at your own
[3888.799s] Peril China to ramp up fiscal support
[3891.279s] for consumption next year and article of
[3893.839s] the week the crown stock market and
[3896.2s] sentiment results so each week we cover
[3899.72s] one to two stocks we&#39;ve discussed in
[3901.2s] previous podcast video cast and or own
[3903.48s] for clients personally this week we&#39;re
[3904.839s] going to cover crown castle the number
[3907.76s] one thing you need to know about crown
[3909.119s] castle is that like all other REITs it
[3911.88s] trades with interest rates when the
[3913.76s] 10year yield goes down all REITs benefit
[3916.079s] including crown castle in the chart
[3918.64s] below you can find crown castle in black
[3920.64s] and red that&#39;s right
[3922.72s] here uh overlaid with TLT the 10 20-year
[3926.4s] treasury ETF in
[3928.319s] blue that&#39;s right here and the re index
[3933.2s] in purple that&#39;s right here as bond
[3936.2s] yields have fallen yields went up REITs
[3939.44s] have fallen as their plays on yields
[3941.44s] right now the dividend yield on crown
[3943.68s] castle is
[3945.599s] 6.9% stock is down from 180 down to 90
[3950.279s] it got as low as
[3951.68s] 78 uh we had been pounding the table it
[3954.52s] rallied to 120 it&#39;s back to 90 We&#39;ll add
[3957.52s] more which we&#39;ve been doing and this
[3959.559s] thing will be back to New highs in a few
[3961.799s] years we&#39;ll collect a 7% dividend in the
[3964.16s] meantime which by the way they&#39;ll raise
[3966.039s] so our yield on cap on principal will
[3968.52s] even get higher and uh they finally got
[3971.839s] W rid of the Dead weight fiber business
[3973.839s] which we&#39;re going to talk about now uh
[3976.319s] we have made the case for bonds getting
[3977.88s] bid yields going down in 2025 hedge
[3980.359s] funds and large Traders red line at the
[3982.16s] bottom down here uh have not been
[3984.76s] positioned this short 10year treasury
[3986.359s] since September 2018 that was right over
[3988.559s] here which preceded a major rally in
[3990.64s] bonds right here commercials the true
[3993.079s] smart money green line at the bottom
[3995.119s] right here uh are near record long they
[3999.48s] haven&#39;t been this long since September
[4002.16s] 2018 right before huge rally in in bonds
[4006.2s] compression in yields commercials are
[4007.839s] always early and mostly right we can
[4010.68s] debate the reasons why bonds will get
[4012.16s] bid from positive to negative fiscal
[4014.52s] responsibility Doge okay uh flight to
[4018.079s] safety geopolitical uncertainty less
[4020.279s] issuance due to higher tax receipts
[4024.039s] these are just guesses positioning tells
[4026.16s] me a lot more than predicting the quote
[4028.359s] Best
[4029.88s] Catalyst someone of course with no skin
[4032.92s] in the game reached out to me saying
[4034.92s] quote CCI is down because they&#39;re only
[4037.24s] getting 8 billion for the fiber business
[4039.64s] end quote this is utter nonsense
[4042.119s] disposing the money losing fiber
[4043.72s] business will leave behind a cash flow
[4045.799s] machine that requires little maintenance
[4047.92s] with lower cap X spend moving forward
[4050.319s] they should pay someone to take it off
[4052.24s] their hands never mind get 8 billion
[4054.839s] that&#39;s whipped cream CCI is down because
[4057.2s] every read is down every read is down
[4058.96s] because bonds are temporarily down just
[4061.039s] like they were after Trump got elected
[4062.92s] in 2016 just like they got bid in 2017
[4066.4s] every read is temporarily down end of
[4068.839s] story here&#39;s this daily CCI with TLT
[4072.52s] overlay effectively the exact same
[4076.0s] chart the blue line is TLT the red and
[4079.24s] black is uh CCI nothing to do with fiber
[4083.92s] disposition it&#39;s been doing the exact
[4086.039s] same damn thing before the new thing was
[4088.92s] announced in case we haven&#39;t mentioned
[4090.96s] it enough in the last few weeks the same
[4093.039s] thing happened after president Trump was
[4094.72s] elected in November 2016 bonds and REITs
[4098.0s] and CCI sold off after the inauguration
[4100.799s] in January 2017 they all rallied sell
[4103.92s] the rumor bu the news election crash
[4107.679s] inauguration rally straight up almost uh
[4111.64s] 70% move
[4115.4s] in less than a year after the
[4117.759s] inauguration here&#39;s the 2016 to 2017 Cal
[4122.159s] calendar flip with CCI and bonds TLT and

[4140.88s] congratulate the existing clients who
[4142.4s] have been with us for a while you could
[4144.4s] not be better positioned for what is
[4146.96s] about to take place in coming weeks and
[4149.0s] months before and after the inauguration
[4151.56s] we&#39;ve been hard at work getting you
[4153.4s] ready for what it what is about to
[4154.96s] happen those of you who watch the last
[4156.96s] few weeks podcast video cast have a
[4159.159s] sample idea of what I&#39;m referring to a
[4162.4s] sample idea in light of this imminent
[4164.88s] Outlook we will be reopening to smaller
[4167.279s] accounts the $1 million plus accounts
[4169.44s] for q1 a few days earlier than normal
[4172.92s] due to the rare conditions now in place
[4175.359s] to put money to work very attractively
[4178.64s] existing clients know we have been busy
[4180.719s] at work taking advantage over the past
[4183.159s] week due to demand from longtime
[4185.64s] listeners of the podcast who understand
[4187.319s] what is setting up per our recent
[4189.239s] podcast video cast as well as new
[4191.12s] referrals that we&#39;ve received we&#39;ve
[4193.279s] already begun Fielding in for new
[4196.28s] clients this week and sending them out
[4198.44s] the paperwork we are doing this so that
[4201.44s] those who are a mutual fit can begin
[4203.84s] deploying Capital as early as January
[4206.76s] 2nd after their applications are
[4209.0s] approved you may enter in your info here
[4213.159s] uh uh this is a hyperlink where you
[4216.36s] enter your contact information on
[4217.76s] hedgefund
[4218.88s] tips.com again all of this is opinion
[4221.4s] not advice uh all this check with your
[4224.56s] financial advis not a solicitation etc
[4227.6s] etc uh do what&#39;s in you you feel is in
[4230.36s] your interest uh but when you enter that
[4233.04s] information you&#39;ll be able to be among
[4234.44s] the first callbacks we will close this
[4236.88s] opening for q1 well before the
[4239.239s] inauguration on January 20th uh as we
[4242.48s] expect to be fully positioned across the
[4244.32s] board well
[4245.56s] beforehand um probably a lot well
[4248.199s] beforehand so those that I&#39;m talking to
[4249.92s] this week are going to be uh in good
[4252.04s] shape larger $5 to10 million accounts
[4255.6s] can access open enrollment here and back
[4258.44s] to CCI so look the reason I start with
[4261.96s] the long-term chart is you can see crown
[4264.04s] castle is a story of Corrections
[4266.6s] followed by recoveries Corrections
[4268.239s] followed up by recoveries early 2000s uh
[4271.64s] 2008 2009 etc etc etc this time will be
[4275.239s] no different and you can see the um
[4281.08s] revenues per share continue to climb the
[4284.239s] cash flow per share funds from
[4286.4s] operations Steady As She Goes The Last
[4288.719s] Five Years slow recovery earnings same
[4291.36s] type of things so there was a little dip
[4293.12s] after covid it will recover you&#39;re going
[4295.56s] to get rid of some of that burn from the
[4297.159s] fiber business now that they&#39;re dumping
[4298.719s] it they&#39;ll pay down some debt bring down
[4300.4s] interest costs uh here are 10 key points
[4303.679s] from the earnings call The Organic
[4306.48s] Revenue growth of
[4308.199s] 5.2% uh Tower segment growth of
[4311.48s] 4.3% 25% growth in small Sal segment
[4315.56s] maintain the full year outlook for
[4317.08s] adjusted e eida and affo wireless data
[4321.08s] usage surpassed 100 trillion megabytes
[4324.92s] uh in last year so the demand continues
[4327.76s] to grow uh supporting their optimistic
[4330.28s] view on future growth uh expected
[4333.719s] Consolidated organic Revenue growth of
[4335.48s] approximately 5% for 2024 including 4.5%
[4338.48s] towers and 10% in small cells plans to
[4341.4s] add 11 to 13,000 new small cell nodes in
[4344.32s] 2024
[4346.239s] uh indicating continued expansion strong
[4348.36s] financial position with company raising
[4350.12s] 1.25 billion in long-term debt reducing
[4352.56s] leverage to 5.5 times net debt to eidon
[4355.32s] now they&#39;re getting another $8 billion
[4356.96s] from the sale of the fiber money losing
[4358.92s] fiber business uh strategic cancellation
[4362.36s] of 7,000 low yielding nodes expected to
[4364.719s] save approximately $800 million in
[4366.639s] future cap X ongoing digitization of the
[4369.48s] tower portfolio to enhance marketable
[4372.239s] space visibility and improve customer
[4373.96s] service efficiency so
[4377.6s] um so they&#39;re talking about the sale of
[4379.96s] 18 billion 8 billion they&#39;ve blown $19
[4383.639s] billion of capital over the years into
[4385.44s] this stupid money losing business so
[4387.12s] they&#39;re now cutting their losses and
[4389.0s] getting on with it um and now they can
[4392.08s] return to operating their highquality
[4393.88s] Tower portfolio and return greater
[4396.199s] amounts of shares to cashh Holders Buy
[4398.239s] in float reduce the debt uh many
[4401.56s] investors have long pushed for Crown to
[4403.159s] dispose of the fiber assets namely
[4405.159s] Elliot
[4407.44s] management moving
[4411.36s] along that makes the firm more
[4413.36s] attractive sell Crown&#39;s Tower business
[4415.719s] is 68% of 2023 Revenue it&#39;s fantastic
[4419.12s] 40,000 Towers minimal capital investment
[4421.48s] to drive growing
[4423.239s] cash uh this business entails Wireless
[4426.08s] carriers leasing space on the towers to
[4427.84s] install antennas and other communication
[4429.8s] equipment to power their networks
[4431.159s] organic Revenue growth is driven by a
[4432.719s] fixed annual escalator of roughly 3 % in
[4435.96s] addition to carriers adding new
[4437.36s] equipment to incremental or existing
[4438.92s] Towers which they do to improve or
[4441.52s] maintain their Network cost associated
[4443.44s] with operating the towers are largely
[4444.88s] fixed leading to meaningful operating
[4446.719s] leverage we love operating leverage guys
[4449.12s] that is a theme across most of our
[4452.0s] portfolio and driving profitability on
[4454.44s] new Revenue growth barriers belief
[4457.04s] carriers will need to continue expanding
[4458.719s] infrastructured be necessary part of
[4460.36s] larger Communications Network um
[4465.56s] so they had said that they were
[4468.04s] skeptical about the firm&#39;s ability to
[4469.679s] earn sufficient Returns on its fiber
[4471.92s] investment well now that&#39;s no longer a
[4473.96s] problem um fiber is a noote business
[4477.199s] they&#39;re getting rid of it they were just
[4478.679s] struggling to earn their weighted Lo uh
[4480.6s] weighted at cost of capital that&#39;s now
[4483.6s] gone they&#39;re going just going to be
[4485.88s] focused predominantly on the Legacy
[4488.04s] Tower business and the economics are
[4491.0s] pretty amazing cost 200 to 300,000 to
[4494.4s] construct it
[4495.679s] Tower um and the name of the game is
[4498.679s] having multiple tenants on each
[4501.239s] Tower which gives you huge return so for
[4505.6s] instance American Tower states that the
[4507.239s] average Tower is 275,000 to construct
[4510.04s] generates 20,000 of annual revenue for
[4512.76s] the first tenant with 12,000 of annual
[4515.36s] operating expenses generating a poor
[4517.28s] return on investment of only
[4519.04s] 3% yet when adding a second and third
[4522.4s] tenant these returns jump to 133% and 20
[4525.0s] 4% as annual revenue scales to 50,000
[4528.12s] and 80,000 so
[4531.28s] net uh 68,000 on a 275 that&#39;s a great
[4535.84s] return on invested Capital uh as
[4537.96s] operating expenses only increase
[4539.679s] marginally the crown castle has a tency
[4542.56s] rational ratio of 2.5 tenants per Tower
[4546.28s] as of 2023 with an average annual
[4549.639s] revenue per tenant of nearly
[4551.88s] 38,000 so you&#39;re looking at70
[4555.32s] 6 plus uh
[4558.679s] 19 so 95,000 on a 250 to 275,000
[4564.639s] investor uh investment back out
[4567.679s] operating uh or or management cost of
[4570.199s] 12,000 that is a sick return on invested
[4572.52s] Capital that&#39;s now going to be their
[4573.8s] primary business and the the um uh the
[4578.0s] fiber business is no longer going to
[4579.52s] suck up all those profits which is a
[4581.239s] name which is huge this is going to be a
[4583.92s] literal C cash machine and then you talk
[4587.36s] about the moat of the the regular Towers
[4589.639s] the switching costs are high because
[4591.28s] they can disrupt their service which
[4594.28s] would uh crush them and that&#39;s why you
[4596.76s] see Crown Castle&#39;s churn has averaged
[4599.04s] only
[4599.92s] 1.5% annually since 2019 so you see some
[4604.12s] of these
[4605.04s] notes um site rental revenues went up in
[4608.28s] Q3 adjusted eido went up affo went up
[4612.0s] and you can see it by segment Market
[4614.239s] we&#39;re at a period of fear fear and greed
[4616.719s] is at 30% now we&#39;re coming possibly to
[4619.76s] that zag breath thrust uh just as
[4622.88s] managers are getting out pretty exciting
[4625.6s] stuff I will be on Fox Business uh
[4628.28s] Varney and Company at 1100 a.m. on
[4631.44s] Thursday 11:00 a.m. eastern tune in to
[4634.639s] Fox Business looking forward to that and
[4636.92s] I&#39;ll be on Yahoo Finance on Friday looks
[4639.639s] like 10:40 a.m. so you can tune into
[4644.0s] that earnings consumer discretionary top
[4647.4s] 30 weights revised up in the last 60
[4651.04s] days by 11 basis points Staples were
[4654.76s] revised down by
[4658.52s] 2.76% let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any lumpy
[4661.6s] culprit in this or if it&#39;s just an
[4663.96s] aggregate they were revised down Target
[4667.28s] uh got revised down more than
[4669.92s] 10% uh let&#39;s see if there are any other
[4672.48s] lumpy culprits in this thing
[4677.84s] Target and Hershey Hershey we&#39;ve got our
[4680.159s] eye on so those are basically the two
[4682.84s] culprits a little Archer Daniels
[4686.32s] Midland and uh Estee louder that&#39;s
[4689.679s] obviously priced at these
[4692.0s] levels Dollar General man I think that&#39;s
[4694.719s] a buy I got to be honest with you let me
[4696.76s] just leave it at that um gotta find rum
[4700.84s] the pro the overlap the key is
[4705.239s] you know the beauty of for my clients is
[4707.639s] that I have effectively zero correlation
[4709.719s] to the S&amp;P 500 because we buy individual
[4712.76s] businesses most managers you hire
[4715.32s] they&#39;re just closet indexers and they
[4717.84s] charge you a lot to mimic what you could
[4720.92s] get in an index fund and what happens
[4723.88s] when you&#39;re buying uncorrelated
[4726.32s] businesses to the SCP number one you&#39;re
[4727.92s] diversifying your exposure but number
[4731.08s] two the returns are so lumpy like you
[4734.48s] you go sideways to slightly up for a
[4737.239s] while and then you just have these years
[4739.36s] where it&#39;s off the chart ridiculous
[4742.32s] unbelievable outcomes that no one can
[4745.12s] even blow blows their mind away and then
[4747.639s] the first call in January is
[4749.76s] congratulations don&#39;t expect the same
[4751.56s] thing again take expectations down and
[4753.44s] work day and night to exceed them uh
[4756.36s] again but I think I think 2025 is
[4759.44s] setting up to be one of those like
[4762.56s] pretty awesome situations but
[4767.76s] um it it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing how all these
[4770.52s] things are pointing to it let&#39;s take a
[4772.08s] look at some economic data nothing here
[4774.76s] new that we haven&#39;t covered uh here was
[4778.12s] the earnings growth by sector again
[4780.76s] Healthcare Industrials materials got to
[4783.44s] pay attention to those next
[4785.56s] year and
[4788.0s] um let&#39;s move on to the ask me anything
[4791.8s] question so for those of you who just
[4794.159s] like the podcast um again Merry
[4796.96s] Christmas Happy New Year we&#39;ll see you
[4798.8s] back next week for those of you who
[4801.12s] loveely ask me anything questions and
[4802.679s] get value from that we&#39;re going to start
[4804.56s] right now Martin Young
[4806.92s] [Music]
[4808.08s] says if Cooper standard manufacturers
[4810.48s] mostly outside the US Will trump tariff
[4812.88s] propose hurt them us autom
[4815.52s] manufacturers thanks blah blah blah so
[4818.159s] that&#39;s from Martin
[4819.28s] Yang um well just look back to the last
[4823.08s] time Trump was in office uh the stock
[4825.719s] was with tariff threats with all that
[4828.36s] stuff which is what he ran
[4830.48s] on
[4832.88s] um Cooper standard was trading at $146 a
[4836.6s] share so that tells you most of what you
[4839.48s] need to know it&#39;s not some outside risk
[4841.88s] but you
[4843.4s] can&#39;t plan for what you don&#39;t know that
[4846.04s] you don&#39;t know what you can do is buy a
[4847.8s] business with I mean right now it&#39;s
[4849.32s] trading as if um the tariffs are going
[4851.8s] to be horrible and it&#39;s and it&#39;s not
[4853.6s] because of that it&#39;s trading as if the
[4855.88s] tariffs are going to be horrible because
[4858.199s] no one&#39;s going to believe it until the
[4860.199s] earnings spet turns on from the volumes
[4863.719s] which is a 2025 story on 16.3 I think
[4867.28s] they can earn four $4 plus and so put a
[4870.6s] 10 or 20 times multiple on it you decide
[4872.92s] and then it will start pricing in $8 a
[4875.639s] share and it&#39;ll start pricing in more
[4878.12s] than that and that&#39;s probably you know
[4880.0s] when we&#39;ll be uh slowly exiting uh at
[4883.6s] some multiple of eight times earnings uh
[4886.719s] $8 of earnings at 10 to 20 times and um
[4891.12s] call it a day and those are lifechanging
[4893.84s] events so we&#39;re excited to be
[4896.719s] participating in it moving
[4900.719s] along
[4904.199s] um all right we
[4907.56s] got Christopher
[4911.6s] Wallace thanks for the great continuing
[4914.04s] education on stock market investing
[4915.96s] you&#39;re welcome your approach is truly
[4917.48s] valuable thank you perhaps you can help
[4919.6s] me solve this riddle as you Buffett fan
[4921.6s] and share a lot of common ground with
[4922.76s] Burk share and your approach Burk share
[4924.4s] has been buying up shares as serious and
[4925.76s] owns a third of the company now that
[4927.88s] caused me to do some due diligence
[4929.199s] before attempting to follow them in I&#39;m
[4931.159s] sorry to say I cannot get to what their
[4932.76s] thesis is revenues declining streaming
[4934.44s] music spaces plenty of competition I see
[4936.6s] little mo annual cash flows been
[4938.4s] declining since 2020 when I apply your
[4941.08s] approach I come up with a pass any light
[4943.4s] that you can shed I come come up at the
[4945.08s] past two number one is you don&#39;t know
[4947.44s] who&#39;s buying it sometimes it&#39;s the
[4949.199s] lieutenants sometimes it&#39;s Buffett at
[4951.08s] this stage it&#39;s mostly the lieutenant I
[4953.239s] have zero interest in Sirius this is a
[4955.12s] cigar butt and um I want a higher
[4957.96s] quality business than that Dustin
[4959.8s] Dickerson thanks for sharing your
[4961.639s] investing
[4964.36s] knowledge uh with
[4966.4s] us like buffin and Munger have over the
[4968.84s] years truly a givers mentality uh okay
[4972.12s] thank you Dustin appreciate that
[4973.76s] question for you on Baba&#39;s repurchases
[4975.719s] are they using other means to repurchase
[4977.32s] shares other than open market
[4980.92s] repurchases uh know used employee Banks
[4983.6s] to help them reduce large amounts
[4984.88s] instead of open market
[4987.36s] purchases didn&#39;t seem like Baba used all
[4989.8s] Bond proceeds his past quarter
[4991.199s] repurchase yeah look you won&#39;t know the
[4995.08s] magnitude of anything till they report
[4997.159s] number one number two who cares I mean
[4999.32s] at the end of the day they bought in a
[5001.76s] ton of stock they&#39;re going to continue
[5003.96s] to buy stock they&#39;re also going to
[5006.239s] invest where they can get a higher
[5007.8s] return on Capital than their weighted
[5010.04s] average cost of capital they&#39;re going to
[5011.679s] continue to do that I&#39;d rather they stop
[5013.76s] doing BuyBacks and find those parts of
[5015.4s] the business that are generating 20 25%
[5018.12s] return on Capital and put all the excess
[5019.719s] money there uh versus just buying in
[5022.32s] stock and I think buying in stock was
[5023.92s] all there was to do when everything was
[5025.44s] going down now that the economy is
[5027.84s] recovering and the stimulus is coming
[5030.28s] they got to be positioned to uh uh not
[5033.96s] only retain their part of the pi the pi
[5036.28s] is probably going to grow 30% and if
[5038.719s] they can keep share you&#39;re going to get
[5040.239s] multiples of that in terms of returns so
[5042.48s] I wouldn&#39;t worry about that you got the
[5043.719s] stock connect happening they&#39;ve got cash
[5046.159s] to buy in stock they&#39;ve done it
[5047.719s] opportunistically they&#39;ll continue to do
[5049.44s] it opportunistically but you want some
[5053.159s] confidence that they&#39;re actually
[5054.44s] reinvesting capital in the business
[5056.0s] because they see growth and I think
[5057.679s] that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to start to see
[5058.92s] in coming quarters is um better higher
[5062.56s] and better uses return on Capital than
[5064.8s] just simple uh simple BuyBacks man bani
[5068.8s] hope you had a Merry Christmas
[5070.04s] relatively warmer weather did not ruin
[5071.88s] it for your family yeah it&#39;s just
[5073.44s] horrible with all these palm trees and
[5075.08s] sunshine you know we try to do our best
[5076.96s] to to get through it but uh you know
[5079.52s] it&#39;s it&#39;s not easy what is the best
[5081.36s] place for natural gas commitment of
[5083.08s] Traders uh just go to the cftc website
[5085.679s] they publish it every
[5087.76s] Friday uh or the other services finviz

[5093.92s] Tom thanks thank you for the podcast I
[5095.159s] share it with a lot of people I&#39;m
[5096.6s] interested in your opinion about a
[5098.36s] company called Danos Corp DAC that&#39;s
[5101.8s] from youv all
[5105.84s] shw
[5110.84s] okay da a
[5127.239s] I think someone gave this to us last
[5128.84s] week you know here&#39;s a stock that&#39;s up
[5130.44s] from
[5132.0s] $215 to
[5134.36s] $80 uh got to 95 now it&#39;s pulled back to
[5137.239s] 80 and you&#39;re interested so H you missed
[5140.719s] it okay so maybe it goes up more let&#39;s
[5143.88s] take a look at the
[5145.6s] business uh I forget this fomo guys
[5149.119s] don&#39;t send me stocks that are up 40x off
[5151.36s] the low send me stocks when they&#39;re in
[5152.719s] the hole and I&#39;ll tell you if it makes
[5155.0s] sense to take a punt by solvency risk
[5158.08s] analysis and getting Comfort if they&#39;re
[5160.119s] not going out of business and the
[5161.239s] revenues and cash flow are doing okay
[5164.119s] and it&#39;s a temporary impairment that&#39;s
[5165.719s] where you make a dry bulk these things
[5167.56s] are no thank you uh hard pass on
[5172.119s] shipping companies for the most part
[5174.159s] unless it&#39;s the best operator in the
[5175.679s] business Etc and even then you got to
[5177.8s] get the cyclical timing perfect and it&#39;s
[5179.719s] just a train wreck to incinerate money
[5182.36s] uh at a healthy clip Drew burn uh next
[5185.48s] time I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel by
[5186.96s] the way I&#39;m not getting on you you
[5189.8s] having the courage to send in that
[5191.159s] question probably just helped you know
[5193.92s] several hundred or seven, people had a
[5196.92s] similar idea just stay away even if I&#39;m
[5199.84s] wrong and the thing doubles in the next
[5201.679s] 12 months the following 12 months it&#39;ll
[5203.44s] be down 80% so don&#39;t lose sleep and uh
[5207.239s] just extract the
[5210.44s] um fomo Gene from your repertoire Drew
[5214.639s] burn grateful for your thoughts on trip
[5217.04s] advisor as the current
[5219.32s] valuation uh thanks for all your
[5221.119s] fantastic content 2024 Merry Christmas
[5222.88s] and the best of you and your uh thank
[5224.36s] you drew Merry Christmas to you thank
[5225.84s] you for your years of continued
[5228.28s] unwavering support I appreciate
[5231.48s] that trip
[5234.04s] advisor is not my bag but I think it&#39;s
[5237.0s] like okay from a financial standpoint we
[5239.239s] get this one every few
[5240.88s] weeks and uh We&#39;ve not done anything
[5244.52s] with it and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve missed
[5246.88s] anything some of these actually go out
[5248.88s] of business like
[5251.239s] um the hell was that other one that was
[5253.6s] popular so this thing&#39;s gone down with
[5255.88s] cash flow margin continue to decline
[5258.04s] revenues are going up I don&#39;t love this
[5261.52s] I I don&#39;t like these businesses I don&#39;t
[5263.119s] think they I mean when you put in Google
[5265.119s] anything it&#39;s
[5268.08s] like I I see what you&#39;re saying here but
[5270.6s] I mean we got like record travel let&#39;s
[5272.36s] see what&#39;s happening with Expedia the
[5274.199s] higher quality my guess is this is down
[5277.0s] because they&#39;re no longer relevant yeah
[5278.88s] look at ESP speedia breaking out to new
[5281.08s] highs um what&#39;s the other one I don&#39;t
[5284.76s] even know
[5286.08s] so ah I know it&#39;s you know you&#39;re
[5290.36s] looking at this thing saying is there
[5292.199s] one more puff in it and I&#39;m
[5295.8s] saying smoking is hazardous to your
[5298.88s] health they probably did an acquisition
[5301.32s] here to try to that&#39;s what all see do
[5304.719s] when they&#39;re trying to keep their job
[5306.44s] they do unnecessary bad Acquisitions to
[5309.239s] make it look like the business is
[5310.8s] growing and incinerate shareholder
[5319.92s] money I mean the balance Sheet&#39;s good
[5322.119s] enough if you want I mean it&#39;s
[5323.44s] definitely beaten down if you want to
[5325.119s] take a punt and hope for the best but
[5327.48s] when the industry is going
[5329.28s] up and they can&#39;t find their way to the
[5331.52s] coffee machine it&#39;s usually not a good
[5334.28s] sign let&#39;s see what happened to shares
[5337.36s] outstanding I mean they&#39;re not deluding
[5339.04s] it that
[5343.44s] much this is a trade my man this is not
[5346.159s] going to be a long-term thing it might
[5347.88s] be a good
[5349.92s] trade
[5351.56s] um I&#39;ll leave it at that I understand
[5354.119s] how you got there okay so Sarah Jacobs
[5357.76s] love your podcast learn so much about
[5359.36s] adopting good investment framework
[5360.92s] during one of your October podcasts you
[5362.48s] be Fen your album marrow I&#39;d like to
[5363.88s] know this a company you&#39;re considering
[5365.639s] leaning into more and lium surplus may
[5368.52s] impact the company&#39;s profitability over
[5369.84s] the next one to three years do you think
[5371.32s] there&#39;s a good quality business will
[5372.52s] recover over time uh yeah I uh leaning
[5376.32s] into I mean I want to get more materials
[5378.639s] exposure so yeah I&#39;d probably put new
[5380.32s] money to work
[5381.88s] here um and yes it is going to take a
[5385.52s] couple years to work through but I think
[5387.239s] a lot of that&#39;s priced in I mean the
[5388.6s] stock on 66% it&#39;s a durable business
[5391.679s] over many decades I think you know we
[5394.44s] covered a a really we didn&#39;t cover it
[5396.639s] briefly we did a whole article on it and
[5398.719s] we talked about how the West EV demand
[5402.44s] has slown down slowed down and the China
[5406.48s] is like the whole EV market and it keeps
[5408.32s] growing so uh I kind of like it here I
[5411.0s] like materials I like I like everything
[5412.76s] about it so
[5414.6s] um yeah hope that helps Jimmy
[5421.96s] Jones another question about Baba backs
[5424.4s] wrong question question is return on
[5426.159s] invested Capital if they can get a
[5427.52s] better return on invested Capital now
[5430.199s] that they have business segments growing
[5431.719s] like opening up Morocco
[5433.96s] International um uh the splitting the
[5437.92s] cloud consumer and business and um they
[5442.36s] arrested the decline in share from pindu
[5445.28s] Duo and Teemu uh and they did all that
[5448.08s] stuff with investment that&#39;s what they
[5449.36s] should be doing because they&#39;ll get you
[5451.0s] know if they buy in if they use a third
[5453.6s] of the cash to buy in 10% of the float
[5456.36s] it&#39;s not going to move the needle as
[5457.88s] much as investing in 25% return on
[5460.679s] Capital segments of their business so I
[5463.04s] hope that slows down they bought in
[5464.48s] enough stock and uh I hope they&#39;re
[5467.0s] telling a story about how they&#39;re
[5468.56s] deploying at 20% plus
[5471.159s] returns that&#39;s what I hired them for by
[5473.32s] the way an idiot could go in and buy
[5474.679s] back the stock I&#39;m looking for someone
[5476.36s] that can reignite growth and it seems
[5479.52s] like the segments are starting to do
[5481.04s] that one by one hey Tom hope you&#39;re
[5483.36s] doing great Carl Z metatech Leading Edge
[5486.76s] technology and iare mother
[5489.44s] company
[5492.119s] uh super interesting stuff asml wouldn&#39;t
[5496.199s] be able to produce their machines
[5497.48s] without them okay so this is called Carl
[5501.119s] Ze
[5527.36s] okay stocks down with cash flow revenues
[5530.4s] have been flat the last two years
[5532.04s] margins are declining
[5548.88s] stock&#39;s down 80%
[5551.8s] 75% this looks like a broken momentum
[5554.96s] stock
[5560.719s] um let&#39;s see here
[5580.239s] balance
[5583.04s] sheet I can&#39;t be right 22
[5586.92s] million how much debt 400 I got $20
[5590.84s] million of cash according to this you
[5593.32s] got better double check this and uh $445
[5598.36s] million of debt no bueno uh this is
[5601.76s] toast if they don&#39;t do something they&#39;ll
[5603.44s] do something something but
[5607.36s] uh $178 million of free cash
[5622.52s] flow all right you&#39;re going to have to
[5624.56s] just figure out when all their debt
[5626.56s] comes due how much it is to service it a
[5629.84s] percentage of free cash flow I I mean
[5632.4s] this is a solvency thing
[5634.32s] I don&#39;t love it to be honest with you
[5636.44s] this
[5637.199s] one I don&#39;t love it I think it it goes
[5639.6s] lower and by the way even if it bounces
[5641.88s] chances are you know bounces up to 80
[5644.119s] you&#39;ll have another chance to buy it at
[5645.52s] 60 once it&#39;s stabilized and the
[5647.159s] fundamentals are better so I wouldn&#39;t I
[5649.4s] wouldn&#39;t rush into this I I like your
[5651.4s] analysis and how you got there I&#39;m just
[5653.4s] not in a in a rush uh some very cheap
[5656.76s] automakers Mazda 7261 could you look at
[5659.92s] the stock I don&#39;t buy oems I think
[5663.0s] they&#39;re just garbage
[5664.88s] businesses
[5666.56s] um they&#39;re going to be a race to the
[5668.679s] bottom in margins Cooper standards going
[5671.0s] to benefit I want picks and shovels let
[5673.8s] all
[5675.679s] the gold prospectors go broke we&#39;ll sell
[5678.639s] them the shovels and that&#39;s basically
[5680.28s] what these Mazda and uh Honda and
[5684.76s] um or Nissan and Etc so yeah it&#39;s cheap
[5689.08s] it&#39;s cheap for a reason because labor
[5691.4s] Parts uh race to the bottom uh not
[5694.639s] interested Ford&#39;s been cheap for 25
[5697.239s] years U Max M
[5702.52s] toall asking about gxo no change in gxo
[5706.119s] just going to take a couple years
[5707.88s] basically an oligopoly they&#39;ll roll up
[5709.92s] all the uh smaller businesses the next
[5713.08s] Catalyst there is a new CEO they
[5714.88s] announced two things at once one the CEO
[5716.6s] is retiring two No Deal why people
[5719.0s] wanted to deal is beyond me this is a
[5721.44s] great business let&#39;s just look at the
[5723.719s] numbers one more time for fun maybe
[5725.6s] we&#39;ll do this
[5726.88s] one maybe I shouldn&#39;t do it and maybe
[5729.159s] we&#39;ll do it next week but um bottom line
[5732.719s] is the stocks falling much much more
[5735.28s] than the free cash flow revenues
[5738.36s] continue to grow working off all the
[5740.84s] excess uh Warehouse capacity in the
[5743.719s] industry uh this thing is
[5746.08s] fine
[5750.8s] so we&#39;re we&#39;re very comfortable being in
[5754.639s] the market on this one I&#39;ll leave it at
[5756.28s] that and uh that&#39;s it so we&#39;ll be back
[5760.28s] next time uh next week we will be yeah
[5765.32s] we will be same place uh in sunny
[5768.92s] California uh back to our normal
[5771.32s] Thursday I believe unless that&#39;s New
[5773.36s] Year&#39;s or New Year&#39;s Eve then we&#39;ll move
