  "cleaned_transcript": "### MISCELLANEOUS\nwe're going to have an incredible 2025 and we're going to talk a little bit about why today\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nhere from Peter Lynch the worst thing you can do is invest in companies you know nothing about unfortunately buying stocks on ignorance is still a popular American Pastime uh you know and you&#39;re seeing it more and more lately that&#39;s going to change very soon but uh in the meantime just sit back uh and pray to God you did not get uh fomo jeans because that&#39;s what&#39;ll get you in trouble so let&#39;s go through some of the uh economic data of the week we&#39;re going to do an abbreviated session we might get this one under an hour here for Christmas Eve let&#39;s see if we can pull it off I always say that and then it&#39;s two hours every single week but uh China&#39;s oneye bond yields tumble below 1% not what we want to see but uh exactly what you see right before every major rally in China&#39;s stock so you saw it in 2009 monster rally you saw it in 2016 monster rally 2018 you saw it in uh 20 monster rally so we&#39;re going to see it again here this is going to turn up in 2025 and we are going to be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways uh so that&#39;s that here&#39;s manufacturing PMI uh started to turn up Philly fed manufacturing still turning down so that&#39;s just a regional survey Bank of Japan UA hints at chance of later rate hike sending Yen lower they have no choice when you look at the Japanese data inflation is going up they are going to have to hike uh and we saw a preview of coming attractions in August when they did that what got monkey Hammer smashed people have such a short memory is mag 7 all mag 7 is is a levered play on the carry trade when the carry trade unwinds those 37% weightings in the S&P are going to change very quickly ladies and gentlemen uh doesn&#39;t mean the businesses are bad doesn&#39;t mean anything they&#39;re still going to generate cash what it does mean is they&#39;ll be R-rated in accordance with the cost of capital that is financing the aberrational valuations and we don&#39;t want to be there when that day happens China May set highest budget deficit in decades so they&#39;re going to 4% GDP everyone says they&#39;re not doing enough we covered last week repeatedly China is in the uh most easy financial conditions that they&#39;ve been since 2016 right before a monster rally and then prior to that uh 2020 2016 then 2009 and then going back to 200000 which again all preceded monster rallies in Chinese equities uh we covered a bunch of these charts last week we got the bounce that we were looking for people were running for the hills we said it&#39;s going to take a couple days and we&#39;re going right back up and we showed you 10 indicators and that&#39;s exactly what happened small is greater than large cap expectations rise uh to the highest since May of 2021 um small cap will outperform the large cap we&#39;re going to cover some some data as to why we believe this is true and you saw inclinations of that back in the early 2000s as well which is when they outperformed retail sales ladies and gentlemen look what led the way bigly motor vehicle and auto parts dealers and what&#39;s beautiful is it&#39;s happening right according to plan people are moving down the Spectrum they&#39;re buying smaller cars but they&#39;re buying larger quantity and that is beautiful for Cooper standard because whether the car is small or large you still got to seal the windows and doors and you got to uh transfer fluid and uh uh Fuel and all those wonderful beautiful things that Cooper standard does Nvidia versus super micro if you remember super micro was the same type of parabolic chart uh it&#39;s uh absolutely completely collapsed went from one uh so it went from 10 to 120 and 120 back to 20 had a dead cat bounce here this will go back below 20 and it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re the same type of businesses it doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s going to happen necessarily these analoges don&#39;t mean much but you do have to be cognizant of what you&#39;re dealing with 10-year treasury yield versus TLT so you can see this broad massive Divergence we haven&#39;t seen since uh 2020 and then uh 2018 which we talk about a lot then 2010 and what happened in all of these instances is we saw big rallies in Treasure Ines compressions of yields just another way to look at it here&#39;s another useless analog but it puts things in perspective so you can be cognizant of your surroundings uh this is NVIDIA versus Cisco stock prices you could see what it looked like in 1999 when it shot up from you know 10 bucks to 80 bucks and then collapsed uh you know it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind of odd though the charts do look eerily similar you had this first move a check back a little consolidation then you put in this top then you do a check back then you do another one I mean I it doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s going to happen I certainly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have a tech wreck I do think we&#39;re going to have a tech underperformance uh and um uh just keep it on your screens because Cisco was the exact same type of exciting narrative and uh we we know how that worked and it&#39;s taken you know 25 years it still has not gotten back to the same levels this is for macro charts uh this is put volume on the TLT hasn&#39;t peaked this much since 2011 right before you got a big rally in bonds and then when went again 2018 when uh managers and hedge funds were a record short which we&#39;ve referenced many times so you see this much put volume with everyone&#39;s so certain that yields are going to 5% guarantee uh as close to a guarantee as you can get in life that bonds are going to Rally in the first quarter of 20125 and uh what whatever the reason we&#39;ll see but um oh it&#39;s interesting I wanted to I didn&#39;t quite put it in uh there was an article about waste in the New York Post and um Ron Paul listed or Rand Paul listed all these pet peeve projects he wanted to get rid of one was I think they spent a million dollars determining whether mice uh sought out cocaine uh more if they were lonely mice or not lonely mice you know your taxpayer put to work your taxpayer funds put to work uh uh you know unbelievable but they&#39;re going to cut all this nonsense that is going to be bullish and it doesn&#39;t mean me they&#39;re going to cut 2 trillion it just means that the perception around the fiscal recklessness is going to be changed and once the perception changes you will see a big change in uh the the way the bonds trade okay this\n\nyou know 25 years it still has not gotten back to the same levels this is for macro charts uh this is put volume on the TLT hasn&#39;t peaked this much since 2011 right before you got a big rally in bonds and then when went again 2018 when uh managers and hedge funds were a record short which we&#39;ve referenced many times so you see this much put volume with everyone&#39;s so certain that yields are going to 5% guarantee uh as close to a guarantee as you can get in life that bonds are going to Rally in the first quarter of 20125 and uh what whatever the reason we&#39;ll see but um\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the current General business condition conditions diffusion index for New York and you can see here it&#39;s just now peaked above the zero line which which is what you see in expansions like you saw in 2009 coming from below back to above like you saw in 201516 after that uh last China debacle before the uh huge China rally in 2016 to 2018 saw it during covid saw it in 2001 so this is expansionary rail rail car loadings turning up this is a key indicator this is something that we were showing last week uh performance before and after daily losing streaks lasting 9 days or greater so here we are looking uh uh 60 days out um back to New highs this is pretty uh straightforward Santa comes later in December we&#39;re starting to see Santa uh kick into gear today which is pretty exciting and uh how the seasonally bullish Santa Claus rally period could foreshadow the future and you see that when you have those positive returns in the last week of December it usually bodess well to a positive uh uh January effect and then a positive next year which we&#39;re on board with although we&#39;ll have more uh slightly more volatility next year if Santa should fail to call Bears may come to Broad and wall so if he doesn&#39;t show up that tends to be a negative um but all these are guidelines not guarantees small cap still trading at a lower than average pre premium to the S&P 500 we&#39;re going to see some some data on that today on the catchup with small caps this is a list of beaten down stocks that uh could outperform next year this was an article by market watch as a matter of fact let&#39;s just pull that up here and uh from evercore an image in the new tab all right so this is like a shopping list ladies and gentlemen and what they&#39;re looking for\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the current General

relentlessly in December and when that calendar turns you&#39;re going to see a lot of people want to put these stocks on their books so you know you got Nike you got Intel that&#39;s going to be awesome for us next year uh crown castle that&#39;s all rates we&#39;re going to cover that today which we love backer is going to be a monster next year Healthcare we covered last week um see if there are any on here so Nike we don&#39;t have yet we want we want to uh we&#39;re happy with VF courp but um I think that&#39;s going to start to show signs of a turnaround as well uh Etsy we already have that&#39;s moved up a a bit but uh we think that&#39;ll continue gxo I love this opportunity here and know I have some new money coming in from existing clients this week we&#39;re also opening up uh a few days early for q1 we&#39;re going to talk about why uh later in this call but the setup for these some of these to buy gxo now down the hole like this because the deal didn&#39;t go through thank God the deal didn&#39;t go through if we had gotten taken out at 70 or 80 I would have been pissed this thing&#39;s going to be a lot higher over the next three years uh there&#39;s excess Supply that they&#39;re still working through since covid but gxo is going to be the winner as all the small players get smoked and get gobbled up so we&#39;re pretty excited about that Yeti we keep getting as\n\ntalks about small caps uh and talking about stocks are trade tax losers Poise to bounds so this is all the tax losers and what you saw this year is anything that wasn&#39;t up on

about that Yeti we keep getting as\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\n\nuh um we keep looking at it we haven&#39;t done anything yet there uh AIS not for me Advanced Auto Part starting to move up we love that in 2025 uh and Sun Run I don&#39;t know I keep looking at I keep looking at these uh there&#39;s going to be two or three solar stocks that do exceptionally well next year uh and we&#39;re probably going to be perfectly happy not to participate but we continue to keep an open mind for green stocks which did well under Trump one which did terribly under Biden which goes against everything that everyone would think is true China onshore buying of Hong Kong stocks hits record uh guess what were the two record stocks that were being accumulated at the end of this year was this China bank and Alibaba so uh that southbound connects continues to build weak breath might not be a bad thing here&#39;s the signals after 10 days more of decliners is greater than advancers in the past 40 years which we just had from D Ryan Dietrich over at Carson and what we see is in what you know one month uh the average return or the average is negative 910 of 1% median is half a percent up uh 3 months up 1.2% median up 3.2 6 months up 9% median 3.7% average up 12 months 17.9% average 17.3 so the implication is from these signals 17 up 17% a year out that seems a little rich but wouldn&#39;t shock me uh uh you know presidential cycle we covered the desial cycle last last week um we&#39;re more in the 8 to 12% for the indices and dramatic outperformance for under the indices but um we&#39;ll keep an open mind for that people already front loading possible tariffs um yeah that&#39;s silly season we&#39;ll see how that plays out uh us pce price index came in lower than expected uh there are some articles about what they would have done with that Dot Plot had they seen this number ahead of time we&#39;ll see inflation expectations coming down monopolies monopolizing returns and market cap here&#39;s market cap of S&P 500 versus uh uh unmagnify so these things have really really gotten away um and we&#39;ll see if that door closes either by the unmagnify up or the Magnificent catching down I think it&#39;s going to be the UNM magnificent catching up uh Bull and Bear indicator still suppressed so that doesn&#39;t you know that&#39;s not what you see at tops what you see at tops is 8 to 10 extreme bullishness we&#39;re not there yet although we do have over allocations of equity allocations um here we have debt allocation at 19% as a percentage of Holdings so that&#39;s near record lows I think that&#39;s going to be an opportunity in 2025 I think TLT is going to get bid I think uh CCI as a result of that is going to get bid all the reats are going to get bid this shows government spending from the CBO and Wells Fargo what is mandatory what is discretionary and what is net interest uh mandatory is 4.1 trillion which is 14.5% of GDP P that&#39;s Social Security Medicare Medicaid income Security Programs other discretionary is non-defense and defense that&#39;s about 1.8 trillion net interest is 949 billion so uh here&#39;s the mandatory spending shows all the benefits to give you an idea Canada retail sales month- on- Monon for vehicles was also off the charts just like us which which is interesting because the us we seed well maybe some of that was replacement from the hurricanes in Florida but when you see that although there are a lot of Canadians in Florida that&#39;s for sure uh so maybe there was a little bump on that uh natural gas moving up on the cold swell so we love that for Comstock S&P 500 RIS premium people view this as a negative for equities CU it&#39;s at the lowest level in 25 years except what happened when the risk premium got this low what people are missing about this Equity risk premium is it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of the valuations of the top seven stocks so the last time you had Equity risk premium this this low was the last time that you saw dramatic outperformance of value small caps in Emerging Markets uh and the concentrated stocks like the cisos of the world get smoked which you can see here from 2001 to 2003 and that&#39;s when the quote unquote 493 equivalent back then just took off like nobody&#39;s business small caps took off like nobody&#39;s business Emerging Markets took off like nobody&#39;s business so everything points back to 2021 2022 in case we haven&#39;t mentioned that enough in the last 6 weeks it&#39;s been a historically bad few weeks for Value versus growth again you get that type of thing in 2001 uh and you got a bit of it in 2020 which was an unbelievable year uh so this is where you make hate while the while the sun shines and the sun is coming up uh from the East right now property prices are climbing again Apartments commercial property offices not so much commercial real estate Finance rebounds so uh those properties are starting to get financed that was part of that ver vernado thesis which which uh hit our fair value much quicker than expected uh a is picking back up that&#39;ll be a theme in 2025 as well IPOs is magnificent 7 AM Mania so again I&#39;m not calling for anything I&#39;m just trying to represent cognizance for you guys to think about um and this shows the equivalent rallies in oil in the early 2000s remember Commodities Emerging Markets it shows us home prices during that same period the housing bubble it shows the NASDAQ in the 9s and what they&#39;re showing\n\nmaybe there was a little bump on that uh natural gas moving up on the cold swell so we love that for Comstock S&amp;P 500 RIS premium people view this as a negative for equities CU it&#39;s at the lowest level in 25 years except what

than the NASDAQ 100 bubble of the late 90s and the Nik bubble of the late 80s and the gold bubble of the 70s and the nifty50 of the late 60s before the 73 crash   Japan CPI this is what I was referring to their inflation is going up they will have to hike and all the mag s is right now is a levered uh carry trade that&#39;s where all the carry they borrow at zero and they invested in US risk assets and they benefit from the appreciation of the dollar relative to the Yen and they benefit from the free money it&#39;s a riskless trade until it becomes what do they say risk-free return until you get return free risk and that shifts quicker than you know and everyone gets a margin call on the same day and they you got a preview of coming attractions in early August it&#39;s just people forgot and they went right back to doing the exact same thing so   China May set the highest budget deficit in decades 4% of GDP everyone&#39;s still bearish   this is Larry Williams via Seth golden General Road maack for 2025 this guy&#39;s pretty good   his timing Cycles have worked really well over the last four years I always pay attention to him he&#39;s gotten a lot of stuff also wrong over the years which we all   make mistakes that&#39;s part of the game but   he&#39;s right more often than he&#39;s wrong and that&#39;s the name of the game as well   so he&#39;s pointing to continued weakness into February and then a rally into March and April we&#39;ll see I mean my general base case is that we should be strong into the inauguration a lot of new stuff will start to work into the inauguration and then the old stuff I think you you are going to see some profit taking in the mag 7   Euro areas GDP seen growing less strongly  if you had put $1 in stocks in 1801   your average return would have been about 7% a year compounded and that turned into 2.3 million $1 into 2.3 million unbelievable bonds $1 became 2,100 so same dollar do you want 2,100 or do you want 2.3 million it&#39;s not even close T bills that&#39;s why you want an equity manager not a bond manager t- bills   $1 became $245 gold gold guys you can&#39;t people can&#39;t get enough gold right now right everyone wants gold we&#39;ve been saying good luck with that $1 became $4 so if you buy gold now in 220 years you will have six if you buy $4 worth of gold you&#39;ll have $16 worth in2 200 20 years so   have at it if that&#39;s interesting to you and the dollar has been the worst performing investment so if you&#39;re sitting with dollars in the bank account and not invested in equities you are losing like nobody&#39;s business so    this is from a guy named Grant hawkridge a lot of talk about the breath thrust and it looks like it&#39;s going to be happening here has crossed the 10day count begins will Santa bring a breath thrust with him so   when breath quickly recovers from oversold conditions calculated using a 10 day   exponential moving average of the number of advancing stocks on the N NYSC divided by the total number of stocks in the NYC a Buy Signal occurs when the indicator moves from below 04 to above 6 within 10 trading days or less   signals rare the average gain   when you get this signal which we&#39;ll know in a few days   the S&amp;P 500 has always been higher six months later with an average gain of 16.2% so   you know there you go hope for a breath thrust in then zag Marty Z was a legend by the way hope for aw breath thrust   we pointed to the pmo by all and the pmo SPX hadn&#39;t hit zero it&#39;s now hit zero this thing&#39;s turning up we&#39;re off to the races and the National Association of active investment managers came down everything set up correctly merging stocks emerging market stocks wobble since Donald Trump&#39;s election they did the exact same thing in 2016 2017 and then took off after the inauguration China&#39;s fiscal stimulus has been conservative in recent years this is now accelerating\n\nthe dollar has been the worst performing investment so if you&#39;re sitting with dollars in the bank account and not invested in equities you are losing like nobody&#39;s business so um so that&#39;s that weak breath might not be a bad thing uh we covered that chart that was from Ryan dri this is next seven days down okay so that&#39;s positive from 1950 the average is 1.3% for the Santa Claus rally zag breath rust this is from a guy named Grant hawkridge a lot of talk about the breath thrust and it looks like it&#39;s going to be happening here has crossed the 10day count begins will Santa bring a breath thrust with him so uh when breath quickly recovers from oversold conditions calculated using a 10 day uh exponential moving average of the number of advancing stocks on the N NYSC divided by the total number of stocks in the NYC a Buy Signal occurs when the indicator moves from below 04 to above 6 within 10 trading days or less uh signals rare the average gain uh when you get this signal which we&#39;ll know in a few days uh the S&P 500 has always been higher six months later with an average gain of 16.2% so uh you know there you go hope for a breath thrust in then zag Marty Z was a legend by the way hope for aw breath thrust uh last week when we said this thing was going to take you know a couple of days and it did it didn&#39;t really get its footing until Monday um we pointed to the pmo by all and the pmo SPX hadn&#39;t hit zero it&#39;s now hit zero this thing&#39;s turning up we&#39;re off to the races and the National Association of active investment managers came down everything set up correctly merging stocks emerging market stocks wobble since Donald Trump&#39;s election they did the exact same thing in 2016 2017 and then took off after the inauguration China&#39;s fiscal stimulus has been conservative in recent years this is now accelerating\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nyou know you got an activist including Elliot and starboard super smart guys but even now they&#39;re saying you know after all the things that they&#39;ve asked them to do about trimming costs attracting new users setting up Innovation uh he said if it fails to deliver quote We Believe changes must be considered including for match itself to go private once again and then they they&#39;ll just dividend out the cash to themselves so uh but you can see the trends here and the problem is is Tinder lot a lot lost a lot of users Badu has lost a lot of users bumbles uh Grinders H hinges going upwards but it&#39;s just too small so that&#39;s what we need to see to want to get involved in match it&#39;s like yeah revenues have been super flat that&#39;s probably from Price raises while they&#39;re losing clients is there stabilization of users or an acceleration of users that&#39;s when we want to get in when the stocks down 80% and uh the fundamentals are actually beginning to improve and is not yet reflected I don&#39;t quite see that just yet churn rate of the largest US companies has increased the average company tenure on S&P 500 Index 7year rolling average and what this says the implication from the Financial Times article is that the company seeks cease to exist I think the opposite is true I think the problem is is private Equity has been allocated too much money because they Mark to make make believe they don&#39;t have to mark to Market so pension managers like the even marks because they get to keep their jobs because they don&#39;t have to mark to Market every day and um so you&#39;ve gotten all this private Equity money and all they can do with it is continue to take companies private off the exchanges then lever them up and then refloat them back on the exchanges and candidly destroy a lot of them that they over lever in the interim so that&#39;s kind of why You See It trending down but I think a lot of this trend has a lot to do with um private equities involvement the other thing that it has to do with you can see here when it really collapsed is after sarbanes Oxley you had lower highs uh that destroyed the capital formation business in the US and the ability for smaller companies to list earlier like we had had historically hopefully Trump one could not get that done I know cudow was working on it uh hopefully Trump 2 can reverse some of the uh bad aspects of sarbanes Oxley that will enable more smaller companies to lift quickly and reduce public company costs and compliance ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS leverage loans defaults climb to four-year high so that&#39;s something to keep in mind a lot of crappy loans out there that you have to keep in mind C Conference board consumer confidence turned down this week which was kind of interesting uh consumer expectations turned down so you know regardless of what side of the aisle you&#39;re on uh little surprise there for people to keep in mind uh that um I think people are in the show me State of Mind initial exuberance and now it&#39;s like show me China car production share went from 1% to 39% in the last 20 years us went from 15% down to 3% asleep at the wheel while we&#39;re having Union fights they&#39;re producing cars and eating our lunch so um Japan doesn&#39;t face that they&#39;ve been able to keep share Europe is collapsing they used to have 35% share they dropped to about 133% share so um continue to make it hard for manufacturing to get energy continue to over regulate continue to uh do things that are against the the idea of staying competitive and you&#39;re going to see more and more of these type of things although I think the next four years is going to arrest this at least temporarily uh until the trend resumes sentiment for healthc care stocks is washed out we spent a whole two hours on this last week you can see another visualization you can see the 12mth forward PE ratio uh this is like shooting ducks in the barrel so whether it&#39;s xbi which we love and own whether it&#39;s Baxter which we love here and own which we covered last week uh again you know for those of you who&#39;ve been around we spend 80% of the time on the ones that haven&#39;t let left the station and less than 20% of the time you&#39;re lucky if you get 10 or 20% a week uh celebrating winners that that doesn&#39;t provide if you take care of the downside the upside takes care of itself and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done since day one and I think people have found that extremely valuable so if you&#39;re not looking in the health care sector you&#39;re missing an enormous opportunity in 2025 ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES high yield Bond volume so this is just ramping up high yield refinancings are going to accelerate because they&#39;re priced off the shorter end of the curve expect to see big stuff in q1 and Q2 uh and I think uh Cooper standard will have an opportunity to refinance a lot at lower levels especially if and when they report free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter which they should be able to with a November SAR annualized at 16.5 and estimates for the industry at 16.3 which we covered last week conservatively they could generate $4 of earnings if those conservative estimates are correct about industry volumes because everything after 15.8 goes straight to the bottom line and that&#39;s why we got involved with the trade when it was below 153 because of the operating leverage in the business it&#39;s just magnificent so yield curve has uninverted and stayed uninverted uh world&#39;s top automobile manufactured by sales I mean look what&#39;s happened to America and now you&#39;re going to have Nissan and Honda combined so effectively other than Suzuki which I I thought they made water skis I didn&#39;t even know they made cars uh jet skis rather um Stanis General Motors and Ford fall to the bottom of the list Hyundai motor and Kia who filled the need with the smaller cars is eating their lunch uh and Toyota is number one here are the top all-time favorite Christmas movies this is from Deutsche Bank uh Home Alone di hard love Love Actually It&#39;s a Wonderful Life elf National Lampoons Christmas Vacation might have to roll that out tonight on Christmas Eve National lamp Lampoon Christmas Vacation with the girls expose them to what real comedy is with Chevy Chase uh that&#39;ll be pretty awesome I will probably get out voted and wind up watching Home Alone too but uh such as life moving on after lagging for most of the second half 20 24 big Tech and mag 7 have outperformed the average stock in December so this was just a CA change that came after the election a short-term thing we saw the exact same thing in 2016 after the election and before the inauguration no way to hedge against that short-term move you just get it all on the back end in q1 and two Q2 gains of next year if you try to hedge you you create unnecessary tax events and then if someone else gets elected uh you&#39;re completely on the wrong side twice you created tax liability and you missed the upside so you know you just have to ride it through the beauty is you all get you always get back to the expected Trend uh it&#39;s just delayed to you know in this case a couple of months and then this will catch back up huge and uh be very exciting net profit margins continue to accelerate this is from fax set via Seth golden and expect margins net profit margins go from 12 12% this year to 13% next year so that&#39;s you know expanding margins is the mother&#39;s milk I mean earnings and margins is the name of the game here&#39;s from Zack tan who has been a longtime follower and um multiple time caller uh he posted on VF Corp he says I understand the oah effect of Kim cardashian resulting in the uh The North Face and skims collaboration selling out within minutes but did you know that Vans offthe wall had two releases last week and it sold out quickly as well uh they&#39;ve collaborated with Street Wear label rooted in B bike culture so these look cool by the way I mean out here in California I&#39;m you know seven blocks from the beach we walk there all the time uh everyone wears Vans and and now I actually fit in I was like the only guy wearing my green I&#39;ve got the green stands and I got the the low comfy cush and I got the same ones in white with green so I got green all green and I got the white with green um but everyone wears these and these are super popular um I mean even the golf pro wears Vans it&#39;s mindboggling uh at the country club like every everyone out here so I&#39;m excited to go back to New York in early January for to do a few days of media to walk down Fifth Avenue and see if it&#39;s actually spreading Beyond Orange County California uh because uh it looks like it the Stock&#39;s up a lot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really moving in the right direction this is from Charlie Bello talking about new highs this is the average returns you see the bulk of them are 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 and you can get a sense of the bell curve of returns since 1928 here&#39;s Emerging Markets total returns relative to the us so you can see Emerging Markets outperformed uh in the 80s and 90s us uh outperformed in 95 to 98 and then in 2 to 2010 Emerging Markets crushed the US for a decade and then in uh then us crushed emerging markets for the next decade and I think you&#39;re going to start to see Emerging Markets crush the US once again for the next uh handful of years ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS S&P 500 waiting of the top 10 Holdings this is going all the way back and you know you saw these peaks in 1980 we know what happened next 2000 we know what happened next uh 2020 we did see the big Tech correction in 2022 I think we could see something in that line not the 1999 uh type but something maybe a little bit more mild than 2022 but definitely an underperformance and a consolidation in 2025 in my view Apple price to sales ratio this is kind of interesting as well uh Apple&#39;s trading at 10 times sales with like I I haven&#39;t even looked at it lately but probably 5% earnings growth um forget about the PE multiple relative to you know the PEG ratio ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES um so this is all multiple expansion and this is all financed by the week Yen and I could talk about this on TV and and they would give me 2 seconds because no one wants to hear about this it&#39;s too complicated but I think the most important thing you have to pay attention to in 2025 is the Japanese Yen and as you see that appreciate I as the bank of Japan tries to raise rates because they&#39;re going to be forced to from or uh you start to see the Yen going up every perent the Yen moves up I would say the mag s basket&#39;s going to move down 2% if not more because there&#39;s just so much leverage the amount that they&#39;re borrowing to buy these mag seven stocks and you&#39;re just seeing it in the multiple expansion so if you think it&#39;s like ah us exceptionalism blah blah blah yeah there there&#39;s that but tell me that continues to hold true when the carry trade unwind and I&#39;ll tell you good luck with that idea uh here&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million to a billion in the last two weeks so uh this this is not the environment where high quality businesses that are marked down outperform uh this is when people want fart coin so God bless them uh when the calendar flips good luck ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK AMC entertainment same type of thing we saw what happens when people

along\n\nmaterials are the worst performer in the S&amp;P 500 what 2025 holds for this beaten down sector I want to just jump ahead here to reiterate that with facts so okay Tech has priced in 23% expected earnings growth for next year they&#39;ve priced in a lot of that with the valuation healthare is priced in none of that the multiples compressed they&#39;re going to grow earnings at about 21 20.6% next year so we got to we got to get even I mean we got a big position in xbi we&#39;ve got baxer maybe maybe I&#39;ll get try to find one more uh industrial is going to grow 19% we&#39;ve got plenty of exposure to that Stanley Black and&amp; Decker gener the whole you know Boeing is rocking and rolling uh Cooper standard so we&#39;re good there materials we got stock which is technically it&#39;s it&#39;s not really in that bucket but it is uh and albam Maro so we got some exposure there maybe want a little more com services so these are all going to out earn the S&amp;P 500 uh and God by the way there are there are a number of chemical and plastic stocks that I am just salivating chomping at the bid at as well there&#39;s a lot to do in the material space as soon as this calendar clicks which is why I&#39;m opening up early so that people that have been reaching out that are getting their applications done get approved by gen one we can put money to work right away and not miss this uh by waiting till after the inauguration so that is that all right uh let&#39;s see okay xlb began this is from bti XL xlb began that&#39;s the materials ETF began trading in 1998 and over that time there have only been 14 other days when the RSI was below 20 as it just hit uh last Thursday average returns 15 days later were up 5.5% with only one failure this is from Jonathan krinsky that&#39;s bdig history says to step in here and look for at least some tactical upside reversion meanwhile since 1990 the S&amp;P material sectors had never been down for consecutive years see the table below the sector Advanced over 10% last year before heading for negative returns in 2024 it&#39;s also worth noting that its average annual return following a down year has been 20.43% since 1990 with only one year up less than 10% said krinsky this is this is key guys how this didn&#39;t make it to my pod charts list is beyond me but at least we got it um look at this so we just have a negative return the following year 21% 22% in 2000 it was only up 1% the the rest of the market was getting monkey hammered and it was still a positive 2022 34 4% 20 2008 by the way 20 2002 what is that right after uh 2003 rather it was up 34.76 per in 2003 2009 45% 2012 I mean this and materials where&#39;s my notebook I gotta get even more exposure and I got the names I already have the names I just got to find the space and not get too over Overexposed materials and Healthcare I I mean I&#39;m doing this stuff this is part of my process I went through so many stocks this weekend and I played so much golf that&#39;s that&#39;s my idea of fun stocks and golf in that order uh all right Intel gets a much needed win okay okay fin Lo down billions so they got their grants which we know uh 8 billion bucks there&#39;s one more piece of good news for Intel as it comes to a close the company&#39;s second generation discret graphics cards appear to be a hit at least compared to its inaugural effort Intel put a ton of work over the past two years fixing the Myriad of problems that plagued entry into the market and it now appears to have a winner on its hands The Verge report on Tuesday that Intel&#39;s b580 graphics cards which is priced at$ 249 and generally outperforms the price of your options from both Nvidia and AMD is selling out at retailers selling

CONTINUED ---\n\nmore evidence that a skew towards value and away from growth makes sense now more than ever before [Music] um and they&#39;re talking about so you got it uh he&#39;s talking about margin expansion and how the pure value ETF grows earnings at a 177% clip next year relative to growth which is also going to grow earnings at 177% next year the difference is is one is trading at 10 times and one&#39;s trading at 2022 times so one&#39;s a 2.2 Peg and one&#39;s a one peg and when you can can buy a basket out of one peg with earnings growth it&#39;s a formula for Success great article by Jacob sonin shine good dude and great journalist uh Baba officially launches operations in Morocco marking the first stop in Africa ladies and gentlemen whole new continent whole new opportunity just getting started small cap stocks get hit again be patient and I&#39;m looking for the quote here all right third Corner okay Wall Street analyst forecast profit for small cap companies to increase 16% ahead of the 15% growth analyst predict for larger companies and small caps are significantly cheaper S&amp;P 600 trades at 15 times next year&#39;s profit compared to 22 times for the S&amp;P 500 listen ladies and gentlemen price is what you pay value is what you get so you can buy value at 10 times with 177% earnings growth or you can buy growth at 22 times with 17% earnings growth or you can buy small caps at um 15 times with uh 16% earnings growth or you can buy the S&amp;P with 177% for 22 times and and pric is what you pay value is what you get then if you get into Emerging Markets like Baba you know and you get things trading at 8 n times his lows opportunities of a sentury then you&#39;re off to the races and it&#39;s all going to go back to I think the name of the game is going to be yes you going to have the inauguration you&#39;re going to have all that stuff uh but you&#39;re also going to have the bank of Japan and if you keep your eye on those two things a lot of great things are going to happen in a very short amount of time and the question is are you going to be positioned for it uh this contrarian investor says the tech bubble&#39;s getting s scary here&#39;s his game plan you know this is a sensationalist thing that he&#39;s calling for a 50% correction in the mag 7 I think that&#39;s going to be wrong as well um but um you know he takes you know he&#39;s comparing the AI bubble to the new economy bubble to the covid uh bubble Etc uh I think it again I think it&#39;s just going to be a more subdued normalization than what you saw in 2022 in Tech and it could just mean they grind sideways and consolidate but more likely than not I think we&#39;ll see some of them pull back a bit uh CEOs quitting we covered Chinese investors by record amounts of Hong Kong stocks via the stock link this is what we covered Mainland Traders bought $778 billion Hong Kong dollars of stocks Alibaba and Bank of China were the most bought shares that is going to continue here&#39;s the chart ladies and gentlemen you haven&#39;t seen anything like that since 2020 and they ried from 2020 to 2022 and then uh uh you can&#39;t see back to 16 but you can see that it was up there and um and then we got the big rally into 2018 so that is a new buyer that&#39;s come in and it&#39;s new it&#39;s only it&#39;s been less than a year Munich Reed Scoops up Park Avenue Tower for half a billion so the commercial game is back on for the high level the year of the ugly shoe what&#39;s next for on Deckers and Crocs so these ones outperformed while um Nike and vans uh Vans underperformed the beginning of the year and has really started to come back I think Vans has some incredible looking shoes and uh all the clients out there you know exactly how incredible they are in person uh I&#39;m sure you all got your boxes by now and uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s pretty exciting if you see if you see people walking around in green uh low comfy cush uh shoes they&#39;re probably a decamillionaire senta millionaire or billionaire there never before has fans had more decamillionaires senta millionaires and billionaires walking around in green Vans shoes than uh in the month of December after we uh let loose our our holiday gifts so um so the next time you see someone in green Vans just be like hm I wonder if that&#39;s a centimillionaire or a billionaire it&#39;s uh it&#39;s one of great Hill capital&#39;s clients is wearing vans so after years of going big American car buyers are downsizing to smaller ones we talked about that a year and a half ago that was going to happen they weren&#39;t going to get away with this selling above MSRP controlling Supply if they didn&#39;t provide the supply others would and now we&#39;re getting the volumes we&#39;re getting the incentives we&#39;re getting the inventories it&#39;s going to be an exciting exciting year busted thieves baffled by new laws in California that makes shoplifting a felony uh and what&#39;s so exciting is so this is Seal Beach Police Department in Orange County it&#39;s probably about 10 15 minutes away and um uh I guess when they were in the back of the police car talking to each other the one girl said to the other new laws stealing is a felony they don&#39;t play around here in Orange County so yeah this is Orange County bch they don&#39;t play lamented the alleged thief and that&#39;s right I mean it&#39;s uh there are a couple towns here in Orange County that uh don&#39;t play games I happen to live in one of them and uh and you can just see the reflected it&#39;s a big contrast between where they actually have rule of law and where they don&#39;t uh one you can walk around to the beach you can let your kids walk the dogs wherever and not worry about it and the others uh you never know what you&#39;re going to get so all right why the dogs of the Dow just might deliver in 2025 that&#39;s Al root uh the dogs for this year that&#39;s the thesis that you take the highest yielding stock five highest yielding stocks at the end of the year and they tend to outperform the next year so Verizon Chevron amen Johnson and Johnson MK Coca-Cola IBM Cisco McDonald&#39;s Proctor and Gamble I think uh I think Johnson John I think these Healthcare ones are really interesting Johnson Johnson Amgen MK look I think oil is bottoming out here I don&#39;t love the valuations enough to get super involved I think chevron&#39;s going to be right uh Coca-Cola is getting interesting and Pepsi I I think that&#39;s overdone uh haven&#39;t looked at IBM CIS Cisco probably McDonald&#39;s I got to just see how much that&#39;s come in and Proctor and Gamble I mean I&#39;ve had my eye on all these even Verizon to a lesser extent so I think that&#39;s interesting um 3M was on the list remember we took that thing straight up and booked our profits by the way it hasn&#39;t moved much since we booked our profits it hasn&#39;t moved much in half a year so we&#39;re pretty happy with that one if that one ever came back down we would reconsider getting involved again but that was a nice win portfolio manager names

the wheel has gotten bit a little bit in the last couple of days on that basis but nowhere near what&#39;s going to take place plan special bonds amidst vows to spend okay so Chinese plan special bonds amid vows to spend so they&#39;re getting serious this is from Brendan Ahern first support the expansion of domestic demand mainland China had a media had a significant coverage of the National

going down in 2025 hedge funds and large Traders red line at the bottom down here uh have not been positioned this short 10year treasury since September 2018 that was right over here which preceded a major rally in bonds right here commercials the true smart money green line at the bottom right here uh are near record long they haven&#39;t been this long since September 2018 right before huge rally in in bonds compression in yields commercials are always early and mostly right we can debate the reasons why bonds will get bid from positive to negative fiscal responsibility Doge okay uh flight to safety geopolitical uncertainty less issuance due to higher tax receipts these are just guesses positioning tells me a lot more than predicting the quote Best Catalyst someone of course with no skin in the game reached out to me saying quote CCI is down because they&#39;re only getting 8 billion for the fiber business end quote this is utter nonsense disposing the money losing fiber business will leave behind a cash flow machine that requires little maintenance with lower cap X spend moving forward they should pay someone to take it off their hands never mind get 8 billion that&#39;s whipped cream CCI is down because every read is down every read is down because bonds are temporarily down just like they were after Trump got elected in 2016 just like they got bid in 2017 every read is temporarily down end of story here&#39;s this daily CCI with TLT overlay effectively the exact same chart the blue line is TLT the red and black is uh CCI nothing to do with fiber disposition it&#39;s been doing the exact same damn thing before the new thing was announced in case we haven&#39;t mentioned it enough in the last few weeks the same thing happened after president Trump was elected in November 2016 bonds and REITs and CCI sold off after the inauguration in January 2017 they all rallied sell the rumor bu the news election crash inauguration rally straight up almost uh 70% move in less than a year after the inauguration here&#39;s the 2016 to 2017 Cal calendar flip with CCI and bonds TLT and blue before and after the inauguration straight up ladies and gentlemen sold after the election bought after the inauguration as a relevant side note we want to congrat congratulate all the new clients who joined us during 2024 we also want to Express gratitude and congratulate the existing clients who have been with us for a while you could not be better positioned for what is about to take place in coming weeks and months before and after the inauguration we&#39;ve been hard at work getting you ready for what it what is about to happen those of you who watch the last few weeks podcast video cast have a sample idea of what I&#39;m referring to a sample idea in light of this imminent Outlook we will be reopening to smaller accounts the $1 million plus accounts for q1 a few days earlier than normal due to the rare conditions now in place to put money to work very attractively existing clients know we have been busy at work taking advantage over the past week due to demand from longtime listeners of the podcast who understand what is setting up per our recent podcast video cast as well as new referrals that we&#39;ve received we&#39;ve already begun Fielding in for new clients this week and sending them out the paperwork we are doing this so that those who are a mutual fit can begin deploying Capital as early as January 2nd after their applications are approved you may enter in your info here uh uh this is a hyperlink where you enter your contact information on hedgefund tips.com again all of this is opinion not advice uh all this check with your financial advis not a solicitation etc etc uh do what&#39;s in you you feel is in your interest uh but when you enter that information you&#39;ll be able to be among the first callbacks we will close this opening for q1 well before the inauguration on January 20th uh as we expect to be fully positioned across the board well beforehand um probably a lot well beforehand so those that I&#39;m talking to this week are going to be uh in good shape larger $5 to10 million accounts can access open enrollment here and back to CCI so look the reason I start with the long-term chart is you can see crown castle is a story of Corrections followed by recoveries Corrections followed up by recoveries early 2000s uh 2008 2009 etc etc etc this time will be no different and you can see the um revenues per share continue to climb the cash flow per share funds from operations Steady As She Goes The Last Five Years slow recovery earnings same type of things so there was a little dip after covid it will recover you&#39;re going to get rid of some of that burn from the fiber business now

attractive sell Crown&#39;s Tower business is 68% of 2023 Revenue it&#39;s fantastic 40,000 Towers minimal capital investment to drive growing cash uh this business entails Wireless carriers leasing space on the towers to install antennas and other communication equipment to power their networks organic Revenue growth is driven by a fixed annual escalator of roughly 3 % in addition to carriers adding new equipment to incremental or existing Towers which they do to improve or maintain their Network cost associated with operating the towers are largely fixed leading to meaningful operating leverage we love operating leverage guys that is a theme across most of our portfolio and driving profitability on new Revenue growth barriers belief carriers will need to continue expanding infrastructured be necessary part of larger Communications Network um so they had said that they were skeptical about the firm&#39;s ability to earn sufficient Returns on its fiber investment well now that&#39;s no longer a problem um fiber is a noote business they&#39;re getting rid of it they were just struggling to earn their weighted Lo uh weighted at cost of capital that&#39;s now gone they&#39;re going just going to be focused predominantly on the Legacy Tower business and the economics are pretty amazing cost 200 to 300,000 to construct it Tower um and the name of the game is having multiple tenants on each Tower which gives you huge return so for instance American Tower states that the average Tower is 275,000 to construct generates 20,000 of annual revenue for the first tenant with 12,000 of annual operating expenses generating a poor return on investment of only 3% yet when adding a second and third tenant these returns jump to 133% and 20 4% as annual revenue scales to 50,000 and 80,000 so net uh 68,000 on a 275 that&#39;s a great return on invested Capital uh as operating expenses only increase marginally the crown castle has a tency rational ratio of 2.5 tenants per Tower as of 2023 with an average annual revenue per tenant of nearly 38,000 so you&#39;re looking at70 6 plus uh 19 so 95,000 on a 250 to 275,000 investor uh investment back out operating uh or or management cost of 12,000 that is a sick return on invested Capital that&#39;s now going to be their primary business and the the um uh the fiber business is no longer going to suck up all those profits which is a name which is huge this is going to be a literal C cash machine and then you talk about the moat of the the regular Towers the switching costs are high because they can disrupt their service which would uh crush them and that&#39;s why you see Crown Castle&#39;s churn has averaged only 1.5% annually since 2019 so you see some of these notes um site rental revenues went up in Q3 adjusted eido went up affo went up and you can see it by segment Market we&#39;re at a period of fear fear and greed is at 30% now we&#39;re coming possibly to that zag breath thrust uh

and get value from that we&#39;re going to start right now Martin Young says if Cooper standard manufacturers mostly outside the US Will trump tariff propose hurt them us autom manufacturers thanks blah blah blah so that&#39;s from Martin Yang um well just look back to the last time Trump was in office uh the stock was with tariff threats with all that stuff which is what he ran on um Cooper standard was trading at $146 a share so that tells you most of what you need to know it&#39;s not some outside risk but you can&#39;t plan for what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know what you can do is buy a business with I mean right now it&#39;s trading as if um the tariffs are going to be horrible and it&#39;s and it&#39;s not because of that it&#39;s trading as if the tariffs are going to be horrible because no one&#39;s going to believe it until the earnings spet turns on from the volumes which is a 2025 story on 16.3 I think they can earn four $4 plus and so put a 10 or 20 times multiple on it you decide and then it will start pricing in $8 a share and it&#39;ll start pricing in more than that and that&#39;s probably you know when we&#39;ll be uh slowly exiting uh at some multiple of eight times earnings uh $8 of earnings at 10 to 20 times and um call it a day and those are lifechanging events so we&#39;re excited to be participating in it\n\n###

your approach is truly valuable thank you perhaps you can help me solve this riddle as you Buffett fan and share a lot of common ground with Burk share and your approach Burk share has been buying up shares as serious and owns a third of the company now that caused me to do some due diligence before attempting to follow them in I&#39;m sorry to say I cannot get to what their thesis is revenues declining streaming music spaces plenty of competition I see little mo annual cash flows been declining since 2020 when I apply your approach I come up with a pass any light that you can shed I come come up at the past two number one is you don&#39;t know who&#39;s buying it sometimes it&#39;s the lieutenants sometimes it&#39;s Buffett at this stage it&#39;s mostly the lieutenant I have zero interest in Sirius this is a cigar butt and um I want a higher quality business than that Dustin Dickerson thanks for sharing your investing knowledge uh with us like buffin and Munger have over the years truly a givers mentality uh okay thank you Dustin appreciate that question for you on Baba&#39;s repurchases are they using other means to repurchase shares other than open market repurchases uh know used employee Banks to help them reduce large amounts instead of open market purchases didn&#39;t seem like Baba used all Bond proceeds his past quarter repurchase yeah look you won&#39;t know the magnitude of anything till they report number one number two who cares I mean at the end of the day they bought in a ton of stock they&#39;re going to continue to buy stock they&#39;re also going to invest where they can get a higher return on Capital than their weighted average cost of capital they&#39;re going to continue to do that I&#39;d rather they stop doing BuyBacks and find those parts of the business that are generating 20 25% return on Capital and put all the excess money there uh versus just buying in stock and I think buying in stock was all there was to do when everything was going down now that the economy is recovering and the stimulus is coming they got to be positioned to uh uh not only retain their part of the pi the pi is probably going to grow 30% and if they can keep share you&#39;re going to get multiples of that in terms of returns so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that you got the stock connect happening they&#39;ve got cash to buy in stock they&#39;ve done it opportunistically they&#39;ll continue to do it opportunistically but you want some confidence that they&#39;re actually reinvesting capital in the business because they see growth and I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to start to see in coming quarters is um better higher and better uses return on Capital than just simple uh simple BuyBacks just go to the cftc website they publish it every Friday uh or the other services finviz Etc uh we show it all in the podcast uh Tom thanks thank you for the podcast I share it with a lot of people I&#39;m interested in your opinion about a company called Danos Corp DAC that&#39;s from youv all shw okay da a I think someone gave this to us last week you know here&#39;s a stock that&#39;s up from $215 to $80 uh got to 95 now it&#39;s pulled back to 80 and you&#39;re interested so H you missed it okay so maybe it goes up more let&#39;s take a look at the business uh I forget this fomo guys don&#39;t send me stocks that are up 40x off the low send me stocks when they&#39;re in the hole and I&#39;ll tell you if it makes sense to take a punt by solvency risk analysis and getting Comfort if they&#39;re not going out of business and the revenues and cash flow are doing okay and it&#39;s a temporary impairment that&#39;s where you make a dry bulk these things are no thank you uh hard pass on shipping companies for the most part unless it&#39;s the best operator in the business Etc and even then you got to get the cyclical timing perfect and it&#39;s just a train wreck to incinerate money uh at a healthy clip Drew burn uh next time I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel by the way I&#39;m not getting on you you having the courage to send in that question probably just helped you know several hundred or seven, people had a similar idea just stay away even if I&#39;m wrong and the thing doubles in the next 12 months the following 12 months it&#39;ll be down 80% so don&#39;t lose sleep and uh just extract the um fomo Gene from your repertoire Drew burn grateful for your thoughts on trip advisor as the current valuation uh thanks for all your fantastic content 2024 Merry Christmas and the best of you and your uh thank you drew Merry Christmas to you thank you for your years of continued unwavering support I appreciate that trip advisor is not my bag but I think it&#39;s like okay from a financial standpoint we get this one every few weeks and uh We&#39;ve not done anything with it and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve missed anything some of these actually go out of business like um the hell was that other one that was popular so this thing&#39;s gone down with cash flow margin continue to decline revenues are going up I don&#39;t love this I I don&#39;t like these businesses I don&#39;t think they I mean when you put in Google anything it&#39;s like I I see what you&#39;re saying here but I mean we got like record travel let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening with Expedia the higher quality my guess is this is down because they&#39;re no longer relevant yeah look at ESP speedia breaking out to new highs um what&#39;s the other one I don&#39;t even know so ah I know it&#39;s you know you&#39;re looking at this thing saying is there one more puff in it and I&#39;m saying smoking is hazardous to your health they probably did an acquisition here to try to that&#39;s what all see do when they&#39;re trying to keep their job they do unnecessary bad Acquisitions to make it look like the business is growing and incinerate shareholder money I mean the balance Sheet&#39;s good enough if you want I mean it&#39;s definitely beaten down if you want to take a punt and hope for the best but when the industry is going up and they can&#39;t find their way to the coffee machine it&#39;s usually not a good sign let&#39;s see what happened to shares outstanding I mean they&#39;re not deluding it that much this is a trade my man this is not going to be a long-term thing it might be a good trade um I&#39;ll leave it at that I understand how you got there okay so Sarah Jacobs love your podcast learn so much about adopting good investment framework during one of your October podcasts you be Fen your album marrow I&#39;d like to know this a company you&#39;re considering leaning into more and lium surplus may impact the company&#39;s profitability over the next one to three years do you think there&#39;s a good quality business will recover over time uh yeah I uh leaning into I mean I want to get more materials exposure so yeah I&#39;d probably put new money to work here um and yes it is going to take a couple years to work through but I think a lot of that&#39;s priced in I mean the stock on 66% it&#39;s a durable business over many decades I think you know we covered a a really we didn&#39;t cover it briefly we did a whole article on it and we talked about how the West EV demand has slown down slowed down and the China is like the whole EV market and it keeps growing so uh I kind of like it here I like materials I like I like everything about it so um yeah hope that helps Jimmy Jones another question about Baba backs wrong question question is return on invested Capital if they can get a better return on invested Capital now that they have business segments growing like opening up Morocco International um uh the splitting the cloud consumer and business and um they arrested the decline in share from pindu Duo and Teemu uh and they did all that stuff with investment that&#39;s what they should be doing because they&#39;ll get you know if they buy in if they use a third of the cash to buy in 10% of the float it&#39;s not going to move the needle as much as investing in 25% return on Capital segments of their business so I hope that slows down they bought in enough stock and uh I hope they&#39;re telling a story about how they&#39;re deploying at 20% plus returns that&#39;s what I hired them for by the way an idiot could go in and buy back the stock I&#39;m looking for someone that can reignite growth and it seems like the segments are starting to do that one by one hey Tom hope you&#39;re doing great Carl Z metatech Leading Edge technology and iare mother company uh super interesting stuff asml wouldn&#39;t be able to produce their machines without them okay so this is called Carl Ze okay stocks down with cash flow revenues have been flat the last two years margins are declining stock&#39;s down 80% 75% this looks like a broken momentum stock um let&#39;s see here balance sheet I can&#39;t be right 22 million how much debt 400 I got $20 million of cash according to this you got better double check this and uh $445 million of debt no bueno uh this is toast if they don&#39;t do something they&#39;ll do something something but uh $178 million of free cash flow all right you&#39;re going to have to just figure out when all their debt comes due how much it is to service it a percentage of free cash flow I I mean this is a solvency thing I don&#39;t love it to be honest with you this one I don&#39;t love it I think it it goes lower and by the way even if it bounces chances are you know bounces up to 80 you&#39;ll have another chance to buy it at 60 once it&#39;s stabilized and the fundamentals are better so I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t rush into this I I like your analysis and how you got there I&#39;m just not in a in a rush uh some very cheap automakers Mazda 7261 could you look at the stock I don&#39;t buy oems I think they&#39;re just garbage businesses um they&#39;re going to be a race to the bottom in margins Cooper standards going to benefit I want picks and shovels let all the gold prospectors go broke we&#39;ll sell them the shovels and that&#39;s basically what these Mazda and uh Honda and um or Nissan and Etc so yeah it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s cheap for a reason because labor Parts uh race to the bottom uh not interested Ford&#39;s been cheap for 25 years U Max M toall asking about gxo no change in gxo just going to take a couple years basically an oligopoly they&#39;ll roll up all the uh smaller businesses the next Catalyst t\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n Carl Z metatech Leading Edge technology and iare mother company uh super interesting stuff asml wouldn&#39;t be able to produce their machines without them okay so this is called Carl Ze okay stocks down with cash flow revenues have been flat the last two years margins are declining stock&#39;s down 80% 75% this looks like a broken momentum stock um let&#39;s see here balance sheet I can&#39;t be right 22 million how much debt 400 I got $20 million of cash according to this you got better double check this and uh $445 million of debt no bueno uh this is toast if they don&#39;t do something they&#39;ll do something something but uh $178 million of free cash flow all right you&#39;re going to have to just figure out when all their debt comes due how much it is to service it a percentage of free cash flow I I mean this is a solvency thing I don&#39;t love it to be honest with you this one I don&#39;t love it I think it it goes lower and by the way even if it bounces chances are you know bounces up to 80 you&#39;ll have another chance to buy it at 60 once it&#39;s stabilized and the fundamentals are better so I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t rush into this I I like your analysis and how you got there I&#39;m just not in a in a rush uh some very cheap automakers Mazda 7261 could you look at the stock I don&#39;t buy oems I think they&#39;re just garbage businesses um they&#39;re going to be a race to the bottom in margins Cooper standards going to benefit I want picks and shovels let all the gold prospectors go broke we&#39;ll sell them the shovels and that&#39;s basically

announced two things at once one the CEO is retiring two No Deal why people wanted to deal is beyond me this is a great business let&#39;s just look at the numbers one more time for fun maybe we&#39;ll do this one maybe I shouldn&#39;t do it and maybe we&#39;ll do it next week but um bottom line is the stocks falling much much more than the free cash flow revenues continue to grow working off all the excess uh Warehouse capacity in the industry uh this thing is fine so we&#39;re we&#39;re very comfortable being in the market on this one I&#39;ll leave it at that and uh that&#39;s it so we&#39;ll be back next time\n\nhere is a new CEO they announced two things at once one the CEO is retiring two No Deal why people wanted to deal is beyond me this is a great business let's just look at the numbers one more time for fun maybe we'll do this one maybe I shouldn't do it and maybe we'll do it next week but um bottom line is the stocks falling much much more than the free cash flow

thing you can do is invest in companies you know nothing about unfortunately buying stocks on ignorance is still a popular American Pastime uh you know and you&#39;re seeing it more and more lately that&#39;s going to change very soon but uh in the meantime just sit back uh and pray to God you did not get uh fomo jeans because that&#39;s what&#39;ll get you in trouble so let&#39;s go through some of the uh economic data of the week we&#39;re going to do an abbreviated session we might get this one under an hour here for Christmas Eve let&#39;s see if we can pull it off I always say that and then it&#39;s two hours every single week but uh China&#39;s oneye bond yields tumble below 1% not what we want to see but uh exactly what you see right before every major rally in China&#39;s stock so you saw it in 2009 monster rally you saw it in 2016 monster rally 2018 you saw it in uh 20 monster rally so we&#39;re going to see it again here this is going to turn up in 2025 and we are going to be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways uh so that&#39;s that here&#39;s manufacturing PMI uh started to turn up Philly fed manufacturing still turning down so that&#39;s just a regional survey Bank of Japan UA hints at chance of later rate hike sending Yen lower they have no choice when you look at the Japanese data inflation is going up they are going to have to hike uh and we saw a preview of coming attractions in August when they did that what got monkey Hammer smashed people have such a short memory is mag 7 all mag 7 is is a levered play on the carry trade when the carry trade unwinds those 37% weightings in the S&P are going to change very quickly ladies and gentlemen uh doesn&#39;t mean the businesses are bad doesn&#39;t mean anything they&#39;re still going to generate cash what it does mean is they&#39;ll be R-rated in accordance with the cost of capital that is financing the aberrational valuations and we don&#39;t want to be there when that day happens China May set highest budget deficit in decades so they&#39;re going to 4% GDP everyone says they&#39;re not doing enough we covered last week repeatedly China is in the uh most easy financial conditions that they&#39;ve been since 2016 right before a monster rally and then prior to that uh 2020 2016 then 2009 and then going back to 200000 which again all preceded monster rallies in Chinese equities uh we covered a bunch of these charts last week we got the bounce that we were looking for people were running for the hills we said it&#39;s going to take a couple days and we&#39;re going right back up and we showed you 10 indicators and that&#39;s exactly what happened small is greater than large cap expectations rise uh to the highest since May of 2021 um small cap will outperform the large cap we&#39;re going to cover some some data as to why we believe this is true and you saw inclinations of that back in the early 2000s as well which is when they outperformed retail sales ladies and gentlemen look what led the way bigly motor vehicle and auto parts dealers and what&#39;s beautiful is it&#39;s happening right according to plan people are moving down the Spectrum they&#39;re buying smaller cars but they&#39;re buying larger quantity and that is beautiful for Cooper standard because whether the car is small or large you still got to seal the windows and doors and you got to uh transfer fluid and uh uh Fuel and all those wonderful beautiful things that Cooper standard does Nvidia versus super micro if you remember super micro was the same type of parabolic chart uh it&#39;s uh absolutely completely collapsed went from one uh so it went from 10 to 120 and 120 back to 20 had a dead cat bounce here this will go back below 20 and it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re the same type of businesses it doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s going to happen necessarily these analoges don&#39;t mean much but you do have to be cognizant of what you&#39;re dealing with 10-year treasury yield versus TLT so you can see this broad massive Divergence we haven&#39;t seen since uh 2020 and then uh 2018 which we talk about a lot then 2010 and what happened in all of these instances is we saw big rallies in Treasure Ines compressions of yields just another way to look at it here&#39;s another useless analog but it puts things in perspective so you can be cognizant of your surroundings uh this is NVIDIA versus Cisco stock prices you could see what it looked like in 1999 when it shot up from you know 10 bucks to 80 bucks and then collapsed uh you know it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind of odd though the charts do look eerily similar you had this first move a check back a little consolidation then you put in this top then you do a check back then you do another one I mean I it doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s going to happen I certainly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have a tech wreck I do think we&#39;re going to have a tech underperformance uh and um uh just keep it on your screens because Cisco was the exact same type of exciting narrative and uh we we know how that worked and it&#39;s taken you know 25 years it still has not gotten back to the same levels this is for macro charts uh this is put volume on the TLT hasn&#39;t peaked this much since 2011 right before you got a big rally in bonds and then when went again 2018 when uh managers and hedge funds were a record short which we&#39;ve referenced many times so you see this much put volume with everyone&#39;s so certain that yields are going to 5% guarantee uh as close to a guarantee as you can get in life that bonds are going to Rally in the first quarter of 20125 and uh what whatever the reason we&#39;ll see but um oh it&#39;s interesting I wanted to I didn&#39;t quite put it in uh there was an article about waste in the New York Post and um Ron Paul listed or Rand Paul listed all these pet peeve projects he wanted to get rid of one was I think they spent a million dollars determining whether mice uh sought out cocaine uh more if they were lonely mice or not lonely mice you know your taxpayer put to work your taxpayer funds put to work uh uh you know unbelievable but they&#39;re going to cut all this nonsense that is going to be bullish and it doesn&#39;t mean me they&#39;re going to cut 2 trillion it just means that the perception around the fiscal recklessness is going to be changed and once the perception changes you will see a big change in uh the the way the bonds trade okay this",

they&#39;re going to cut 2 trillion it just means that the perception around the fiscal recklessness is going to be changed and once the perception changes you will see a big change in uh the the way the bonds trade okay this\n\nyou know you got an activist including Elliot and starboard super smart guys but even now they&#39;re saying you know after all the things that they&#39;ve asked them to do about trimming costs attracting new users setting up Innovation uh he said if it fails to deliver quote We Believe changes must be considered including for match itself to go private once again and then they they&#39;ll just dividend out the cash to themselves so uh but you can see the trends here and the problem is is Tinder lot a lot lost a lot of users Badu has lost a lot of users bumbles uh Grinders H hinges going upwards but it&#39;s just too small so that&#39;s what we need to see to want to get involved in match it&#39;s like yeah revenues have been super flat that&#39;s probably from Price raises while they&#39;re losing clients is there stabilization of users or an acceleration of users that&#39;s when we want to get in when the stocks down 80% and uh the fundamentals are actually beginning to improve and is not yet reflected I don&#39;t quite see that just yet churn rate of the largest US companies has increased the average company tenure on S&P 500 Index 7year rolling average and what this says the implication from the Financial Times article is that the company seeks cease to exist I think the opposite is true I think the problem is is private Equity has been allocated too much money because they Mark to make make believe they don&#39;t have to mark to Market so pension managers like the even marks because they get to keep their jobs because they don&#39;t have to mark to Market every day and um so you&#39;ve gotten all this private Equity money and all they can do with it is continue to take companies private off the exchanges then lever them up and then refloat them back on the exchanges and candidly destroy a lot of them that they over lever in the interim so that&#39;s kind of why You See It trending down but I think a lot of this trend has a lot to do with um private equities involvement the other thing that it has to do with you can see here when it really collapsed is after sarbanes Oxley you had lower highs uh that destroyed the capital formation business in the US and the ability for smaller companies to list earlier like we had had historically hopefully Trump one could not get that done I know cudow was working on it uh hopefully Trump 2 can reverse some of the uh bad aspects of sarbanes Oxley that will enable more smaller companies to lift quickly and reduce public company costs and compliance ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS leverage loans defaults climb to four-year high so that&#39;s something to keep in mind a lot of crappy loans out there that you have to keep in mind C Conference board consumer confidence turned down this week which was kind of interesting uh consumer expectations turned down so you know regardless of what side of the aisle you&#39;re on uh little surprise there for people to keep in mind uh that um I think people are in the show me State of Mind initial exuberance and now it&#39;s like show me China car production share went from 1% to 39% in the last 20 years us went from 15% down to 3% asleep at the wheel while we&#39;re having Union fights they&#39;re producing cars and eating our lunch so um Japan doesn&#39;t face that they&#39;ve been able to keep share Europe is collapsing they used to have 35% share they dropped to about 133% share so um continue to make it hard for manufacturing to get energy continue to over regulate continue to uh do things that are against the the idea of staying competitive and you&#39;re going to see more and more of these type of things although I think the next four years is going to arrest this at least temporarily uh until the trend resumes sentiment for healthc care stocks is washed out we spent a whole two hours on this last week you can see another visualization you can see the 12mth forward PE ratio uh this is like shooting ducks in the barrel so whether it&#39;s xbi which we love and own whether it&#39;s Baxter which we love here and own which we covered last week uh again you know for those of you who&#39;ve been around we spend 80% of the time on the ones that haven&#39;t let left the station and less than 20% of the time you&#39;re lucky if you get 10 or 20% a week uh celebrating winners that that doesn&#39;t provide if you take care of the downside the upside takes care of itself and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done since day one and I think people have found that extremely valuable so if you&#39;re not looking in the health care sector you&#39;re missing an enormous opportunity in 2025 ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES high yield Bond volume so this is just ramping up high yield refinancings are going to accelerate because they&#39;re priced off the shorter end of the curve expect to see big stuff in q1 and Q2 uh and I think uh Cooper standard will have an opportunity to refinance a lot at lower levels especially if and when they report free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter which they should be able to with a November SAR annualized at 16.5 and estimates for the industry at 16.3 which we covered last week conservatively they could generate $4 of earnings if those conservative estimates are correct about industry volumes because everything after 15.8 goes straight to the bottom line and that&#39;s why we got involved with the trade when it was below 153 because of the operating leverage in the business it&#39;s just magnificent so yield curve has uninverted and stayed uninverted uh world&#39;s top automobile manufactured by sales I mean look what&#39;s happened to America and now you&#39;re going to have Nissan and Honda combined so effectively other than Suzuki which I I thought they made water skis I didn&#39;t even know they made cars uh jet skis rather um Stanis General Motors and Ford fall to the bottom of the list Hyundai motor and Kia who filled the need with the smaller cars is eating their lunch uh and Toyota is number one here are the top all-time favorite Christmas movies this is from Deutsche Bank uh Home Alone di hard love Love Actually It&#39;s a Wonderful Life elf National Lampoons Christmas Vacation might have to roll that out tonight on Christmas Eve National lamp Lampoon Christmas Vacation with the girls expose them to what real comedy is with Chevy Chase uh that&#39;ll be pretty awesome I will probably get out voted and wind up watching Home Alone too but uh such as life moving on after lagging for most of the second half 20 24 big Tech and mag 7 have outperformed the average stock in December so this was just a CA change that came after the election a short-term thing we saw the exact same thing in 2016 after the election and before the inauguration no way to hedge against that short-term move you just get it all on the back end in q1 and two Q2 gains of next year if you try to hedge you you create unnecessary tax events and then if someone else gets elected uh you&#39;re completely on the wrong side twice you created tax liability and you missed the upside so you know you just have to ride it through the beauty is you all get you always get back to the expected Trend uh it&#39;s just delayed to you know in this case a couple of months and then this will catch back up huge and uh be very exciting net profit margins continue to accelerate this is from fax set via Seth golden and expect margins net profit margins go from 12 12% this year to 13% next year so that&#39;s you know expanding margins is the mother&#39;s milk I mean earnings and margins is the name of the game here&#39;s from Zack tan who has been a longtime follower and um multiple time caller uh he posted on VF Corp he says I understand the oah effect of Kim cardashian resulting in the uh The North Face and skims collaboration selling out within minutes but did you know that Vans offthe wall had two releases last week and it sold out quickly as well uh they&#39;ve collaborated with Street Wear label rooted in B bike culture so these look cool by the way I mean out here in California I&#39;m you know seven blocks from the beach we walk there all the time uh everyone wears Vans and and now I actually fit in I was like the only guy wearing my green I&#39;ve got the green stands and I got the the low comfy cush and I got the same ones in white with green so I got green all green and I got the white with green um but everyone wears these and these are super popular um I mean even the golf pro wears Vans it&#39;s mindboggling uh at the country club like every everyone out here so I&#39;m excited to go back to New York in early January for to do a few days of media to walk down Fifth Avenue and see if it&#39;s actually spreading Beyond Orange County California uh because uh it looks like it the Stock&#39;s up a lot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really moving in the right direction this is from Charlie Bello talking about new highs this is the average returns you see the bulk of them are 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 and you can get a sense of the bell curve of returns since 1928 here&#39;s Emerging Markets total returns relative to the us so you can see Emerging Markets outperformed uh in the 80s and 90s us uh outperformed in 95 to 98 and then in 2 to 2010 Emerging Markets crushed the US for a decade and then in uh then us crushed emerging markets for the next decade and I think you&#39;re going to start to see Emerging Markets crush the US once again for the next uh handful of years ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS S&P 500 waiting of the top 10 Holdings this is going all the way back and you know you saw these peaks in 1980 we know what happened next 2000 we know what happened next uh 2020 we did see the big Tech correction in 2022 I think we could see something in that line not the 1999 uh type but something maybe a little bit more mild than 2022 but definitely an underperformance and a consolidation in 2025 in my view Apple price to sales ratio this is kind of interesting as well uh Apple&#39;s trading at 10 times sales with like I I haven&#39;t even looked at it lately but probably 5% earnings growth um forget about the PE multiple relative to you know the PEG ratio ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES um so this is all multiple expansion and this is all financed by the week Yen and I could talk about this on TV and and they would give me 2 seconds because no one wants to hear about this it&#39;s too complicated but I think the most important thing you have to pay attention to in 2025 is the Japanese Yen and as you see that appreciate I as the bank of Japan tries to raise rates because they&#39;re going to be forced to from or uh you start to see the Yen going up every perent the Yen moves up I would say the mag s basket&#39;s going to move down 2% if not more because there&#39;s just so much leverage the amount that they&#39;re borrowing to buy these mag seven stocks and you&#39;re just seeing it in the multiple expansion so if you think it&#39;s like ah us exceptionalism blah blah blah yeah there there&#39;s that but tell me that continues to hold true when the carry trade unwind and I&#39;ll tell you good luck with that idea uh here&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million to a billion in the last two weeks so uh this this is not the environment where high quality businesses that are marked down outperform uh this is when people want fart coin so God bless them uh when the calendar flips good luck ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK AMC entertainment same type of thing we saw what happens when people chase that stuff it doesn&#39;t end well Peter Lynch second quote the most important organ in the body as far as the stock market is concerned is the guts not the head anyone can acquire knowhow for analyzing stocks that&#39;s from Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why you know people always ask me why do you why do you share so many of your secrets blah blah blah and I said I could I could number one I share a lot but I don&#39;t share everything number two uh I could could give 100% of the Playbook every single week and write a book step by step and at the end of the day it couldn&#39;t be replicated because of the intangible of understanding the emotions of the market and the only way you get that uh and you get the pattern recognition and you get the ice in your veins one one is it&#39;s genetic that&#39;s just period so you have to be part of this 1% of oddballs that that are just wired this way and number two uh um it&#39;s experience you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just experience and I&#39;ll be uh I&#39;ll be it&#39;s it&#39;s the only business it&#39;s like age you get better with age I mean Buffett if you look at Buffett&#39;s net worth I think his biggest gains happened between like percentage gains happened between age like 70 and 90 or something along those lines so because you it&#39;s just as money compounds knowledge compounds so so um so that&#39;s that\n\nhere&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million to a billion in the last two weeks so uh this this is not the environment where high quality businesses that are marked down outperform uh this is when people want fart coin so God bless them uh when the calendar flips good luck uh AMC entertainment same type of thing we saw what happens when people chase that stuff it doesn&#39;t end well\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nPeter Lynch second quote the most important organ in the body as far as the stock market is concerned is the guts not the head anyone can acquire knowhow

happened between like percentage gains happened between age like 70 and 90 or something along those lines so because you it&#39;s just as money compounds knowledge compounds so so um so that&#39;s that moving along\n\nrevenues per share continue to climb the cash flow per share funds from operations Steady As She Goes The Last Five Years slow recovery earnings same type of things so there was a little dip after covid it will recover you&#39;re going to get rid of some of that burn from the fiber business now that they&#39;re dumping it they&#39;ll pay down some debt bring down interest costs uh here are 10 key points from the earnings call The Organic Revenue growth of 5.2% uh Tower segment growth of 4.3% 25% growth in small Sal segment maintain the full year outlook for adjusted e eida and affo wireless data usage surpassed 100 trillion megabytes uh in last year so the demand continues to grow uh supporting their optimistic view on future growth uh expected Consolidated organic Revenue growth of approximately 5% for 2024 including 4.5% towers and 10% in small cells plans to add 11 to 13,000 new small cell nodes in 2024 uh indicating continued expansion strong financial position with company raising 1.25 billion in long-term debt reducing leverage to 5.5 times net debt to eidon now they&#39;re getting another $8 billion from the sale of the fiber money losing fiber business uh strategic cancellation of 7,000 low yielding nodes expected to save approximately $800 million in future cap X ongoing digitization of the tower portfolio to enhance marketable space visibility and improve customer service efficiency so um so they&#39;re talking about the sale of 18 billion 8 billion they&#39;ve blown $19 billion of capital over the years into this stupid money losing business so they&#39;re now cutting their losses and getting on with it um and now they can return to operating their highquality Tower portfolio and return greater amounts of shares to cashh Holders Buy in float reduce the debt uh many investors have long pushed for Crown to dispose of the fiber assets namely Elliot management moving along  that makes the firm more attractive sell Crown&#39;s Tower business is 68% of 2023 Revenue it&#39;s fantastic 40,000 Towers minimal capital investment to drive growing cash uh this business entails Wireless carriers leasing space on the towers to install antennas and other communication equipment to power their networks organic Revenue growth is driven by a fixed annual escalator of roughly 3 % in addition to carriers adding new equipment to incremental or existing Towers which they do to improve or maintain their Network cost associated with operating the towers are largely fixed leading to meaningful operating leverage we love operating leverage guys that is a theme across most of our portfolio and driving profitability on new Revenue growth barriers belief carriers will need to continue expanding infrastructured be necessary part of larger Communications Network um so they had said that they were skeptical about the firm&#39;s ability to earn sufficient Returns on its fiber investment well now that&#39;s no longer a problem um fiber is a noote business they&#39;re getting rid of it they were just struggling to earn their weighted Lo uh weighted at cost of capital that&#39;s now gone they&#39;re going just going to be focused predominantly on the Legacy Tower business and the economics are pretty amazing cost 200 to 300,000 to construct it Tower um and the name of the game is having multiple tenants on each Tower which gives you huge return so for instance American Tower states that the average Tower is 275,000 to construct generates 20,000 of annual revenue for the first tenant with 12,000 of annual operating expenses generating a poor return on investment of only 3% yet when adding a second and third tenant these returns jump to 133% and 20 4% as annual revenue scales to 50,000 and 80,000 so net uh 68,000 on a 275 that&#39;s a great return on invested Capital uh as operating expenses only increase marginally the crown castle has a tency rational ratio of 2.5 tenants per Tower as of 2023 with an average annual revenue per tenant of nearly 38,000 so you&#39;re looking at70 6 plus uh 19 so 95,000 on a 250 to 275,000 investor uh investment back out operating uh or or management cost of 12,000 that is a sick return on invested Capital that&#39;s now going to be their primary business and the the um uh the fiber business is no longer going to suck up all those profits which is a name which is huge this is going to be a literal C cash machine and then you talk about the moat of the the regular Towers the switching costs are high because they can disrupt their service which would uh crush them and that&#39;s why you see Crown Castle&#39;s churn has averaged only 1.5% annually since 2019 so you see some of these notes um site rental revenues went up in Q3 adjusted eido went up affo went up and you can see it by segment Market we&#39;re at a period of fear fear and greed is at 30% now we&#39;re coming possibly to that zag breath thrust uh just as managers are getting out pretty exciting stuff\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI will be on Fox Business uh Varney and Company at 1100 a.m. on Thursday 11:00 a.m. eastern tune in to Fox Business looking

last 60 days by 11 basis points Staples were revised down by 2.76% let&#39;s see if there&#39;s any lumpy culprit in this or if it&#39;s just an aggregate they were revised down Target uh got revised down more than 10% uh let&#39;s see if there are any other lumpy culprits in this thing Target and Hershey Hershey we&#39;ve got our eye on so those are basically the two culprits a little Archer Daniels Midland and uh Estee louder that&#39;s obviously priced at these levels Dollar General man I think that&#39;s a buy I got to be honest with you let me just leave it at that um gotta find rum the pro the overlap the key is you know the beauty of for my clients is that I have effectively zero correlation to the S&P 500 because we buy individual businesses most managers you hire they&#39;re just closet indexers and they charge you a lot to mimic what you could get in an index fund and what happens when you&#39;re buying uncorrelated businesses to the SCP number one you&#39;re diversifying your exposure but number two the returns are so lumpy like you you go sideways to slightly up for a while and then you just have these years where it&#39;s off the chart ridiculous unbelievable outcomes that no one can even blow blows their mind away and then the first call in January is congratulations don&#39;t expect the same thing again take expectations down and work day and night to exceed them uh again but I think I think 2025 is setting up to be one of those like pretty awesome situations but um it it&#39;s it&#39;s amazing how all these things are pointing to it let&#39;s take a look at some economic data nothing here new that we haven&#39;t covered uh here was the earnings growth by sector again Healthcare Industrials materials got to pay attention to those next year and um let&#39;s move on to the",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nhere from Peter Lynch the worst thing you can do is invest in companies you know nothing about unfortunately buying stocks on ignorance is still a popular American Pastime uh you know and you&#39;re seeing it more and more lately that&#39;s going to change very soon but uh in the meantime just sit back uh and pray to God you did not get uh fomo jeans because that&#39;s what&#39;ll get you in trouble so let&#39;s go through some of the uh economic data of the week we&#39;re going to do an abbreviated session we might get this one under an hour here for Christmas Eve let&#39;s see if we can pull it off I always say that and then it&#39;s two hours every single week but uh China&#39;s oneye bond yields tumble below 1% not what we want to see but uh exactly what you see right before every major rally in China&#39;s stock so you saw it in 2009 monster rally you saw it in 2016 monster rally 2018 you saw it in uh 20 monster rally so we&#39;re going to see it again here this is going to turn up in 2025 and we are going to be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways uh so that&#39;s that here&#39;s manufacturing PMI uh started to turn up Philly fed manufacturing still turning down so that&#39;s just a regional survey Bank of Japan UA hints at chance of later rate hike sending Yen lower they have no choice when you look at the Japanese data inflation is going up they are going to have to hike uh and we saw a preview of coming attractions in August when they did that what got monkey Hammer smashed people have such a short memory is mag 7 all mag 7 is is a levered play on the carry trade when the carry trade unwinds those 37% weightings in the S&P are going to change very quickly ladies and gentlemen uh doesn&#39;t mean the businesses are bad doesn&#39;t mean anything they&#39;re still going to generate cash what it does mean is they&#39;ll be R-rated in accordance with the cost of capital that is financing the aberrational valuations and we don&#39;t want to be there when that day happens China May set highest budget deficit in decades so they&#39;re going to 4% GDP everyone says they&#39;re not doing enough we covered last week repeatedly China is in the uh most easy financial conditions that they&#39;ve been since 2016 right before a monster rally and then prior to that uh 2020 2016 then 2009 and then going back to 200000 which again all preceded monster rallies in Chinese equities uh we covered a bunch of these charts last week we got the bounce that we were looking for people were running for the hills we said it&#39;s going to take a couple days and we&#39;re going right back up and we showed you 10 indicators and that&#39;s exactly what happened small is greater than large cap expectations rise uh to the highest since May of 2021 um small cap will outperform the large cap we&#39;re going to cover some some data as to why we believe this is true and you saw inclinations of that back in the early 2000s as well which is when they outperformed retail sales ladies and gentlemen look what led the way bigly motor vehicle and auto parts dealers and what&#39;s beautiful is it&#39;s happening right according to plan people are moving down the Spectrum they&#39;re buying smaller cars but they&#39;re buying larger quantity and that is beautiful for Cooper standard because whether the car is small or large you still got to seal the windows and doors and you got to uh transfer fluid and uh uh Fuel and all those wonderful beautiful things that Cooper standard does Nvidia versus super micro if you remember super micro was the same type of parabolic chart uh it&#39;s uh absolutely completely collapsed went from one uh so it went from 10 to 120 and 120 back to 20 had a dead cat bounce here this will go back below 20 and it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re the same type of businesses it doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s going to happen necessarily these analoges don&#39;t mean much but you do have to be cognizant of what you&#39;re dealing with 10-year treasury yield versus TLT so you can see this broad massive Divergence we haven&#39;t seen since uh 2020 and then uh 2018 which we talk about a lot then 2010 and what happened in all of these instances is we saw big rallies in Treasure Ines compressions of yields just another way to look at it here&#39;s another useless analog but it puts things in perspective so you can be cognizant of your surroundings uh this is NVIDIA versus Cisco stock prices you could see what it looked like in 1999 when it shot up from you know 10 bucks to 80 bucks and then collapsed uh you know it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind of odd though the charts do look eerily similar you had this first move a check back a little consolidation then you put in this top then you do a check back then you do another one I mean I it doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s going to happen I certainly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have a tech wreck I do think we&#39;re going to have a tech underperformance uh and um uh just keep it on your screens because Cisco was the exact same type of exciting narrative and uh we we know how that worked and it&#39;s taken you know 25 years it still has not gotten back to the same levels this is for macro charts uh this is put volume on the TLT hasn&#39;t peaked this much since 2011 right before you got a big rally in bonds and then when went again 2018 when uh managers and hedge funds were a record short which we&#39;ve referenced many times so you see this much put volume with everyone&#39;s so certain that yields are going to 5% guarantee uh as close to a guarantee as you can get in life that bonds are going to Rally in the first quarter of 20125 and uh what whatever the reason we&#39;ll see but um oh it&#39;s interesting I wanted to I didn&#39;t quite put it in uh there was an article about waste in the New York Post and um Ron Paul listed or Rand Paul listed all these pet peeve projects he wanted to get rid of one was I think they spent a million dollars determining whether mice uh sought out cocaine uh more if they were lonely mice or not lonely mice you know your taxpayer put to work your taxpayer funds put to work uh uh you know unbelievable but they&#39;re going to cut all this nonsense that is going to be bullish and it doesn&#39;t mean me they&#39;re going to cut 2 trillion it just means that the perception around the fiscal recklessness is going to be changed and once the perception changes you will see a big change in uh the the way the bonds trade okay this\n\nyou know 25 years it still has not gotten back to the same levels this is for macro charts uh this is put volume on the TLT hasn&#39;t peaked this much since 2011 right before you got a big rally in bonds and then when went again 2018 when uh managers and hedge funds were a record short which we&#39;ve referenced many times so you see this much put volume with everyone&#39;s so certain that yields are going to 5% guarantee uh as close to a guarantee as you can get in life that bonds are going to Rally in the first quarter of 20125 and uh what whatever the reason we&#39;ll see but um\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the current General business condition conditions diffusion index for New York and you can see here it&#39;s just now peaked above the zero line which which is what you see in expansions like you saw in 2009 coming from below back to above like you saw in 201516 after that uh last China debacle before the uh huge China rally in 2016 to 2018 saw it during covid saw it in 2001 so this is expansionary rail rail car loadings turning up this is a key indicator this is something that we were showing last week uh performance before and after daily losing streaks lasting 9 days or greater so here we are looking uh uh 60 days out um back to New highs this is pretty uh straightforward Santa comes later in December we&#39;re starting to see Santa uh kick into gear today which is pretty exciting and uh how the seasonally bullish Santa Claus rally period could foreshadow the future and you see that when you have those positive returns in the last week of December it usually bodess well to a positive uh uh January effect and then a positive next year which we&#39;re on board with although we&#39;ll have more uh slightly more volatility next year if Santa should fail to call Bears may come to Broad and wall so if he doesn&#39;t show up that tends to be a negative um but all these are guidelines not guarantees small cap still trading at a lower than average pre premium to the S&P 500 we&#39;re going to see some some data on that today on the catchup with small caps this is a list of beaten down stocks that uh could outperform next year this was an article by market watch as a matter of fact let&#39;s just pull that up here and uh from evercore an image in the new tab all right so this is like a shopping list ladies and gentlemen and what they&#39;re looking for\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the current General business condition conditions diffusion index for New York and you can see here it&#39;s

this is like a shopping list ladies and gentlemen and what they&#39;re looking for\nhere is  talks about small caps uh and talking about stocks are trade tax losers Poise to bounds so this is all the tax losers and what you saw this year is anything that wasn&#39;t up on the year just got pounded relentlessly in December and when that calendar turns you&#39;re going to see a lot of people want to put these stocks on their books so you know you got Nike you got Intel that&#39;s going to be awesome for us next year uh crown castle that&#39;s all rates we&#39;re going to cover that today which we love backer is going to be a monster next year Healthcare we covered last week um see if there are any on here so Nike we don&#39;t have yet we want we want to uh we&#39;re happy with VF courp but um I think that&#39;s going to start to show signs of a turnaround as well uh Etsy we already have that&#39;s moved up a a bit but uh we think that&#39;ll continue gxo I love this opportunity here and know I have some new money coming in from existing clients this week we&#39;re also opening up uh a few days early for q1 we&#39;re going to talk about why uh later in this call but the setup for these some of these to buy gxo now down the hole like this because the deal didn&#39;t go through thank God the deal didn&#39;t go through if we had gotten taken out at 70 or 80 I would have been pissed this thing&#39;s going to be a lot higher over the next three years uh there&#39;s excess Supply that they&#39;re still working through since covid but gxo is going to be the winner as all the small players get smoked and get gobbled up so we&#39;re pretty excited about that Yeti we keep getting as\n\nmaybe there was a little bump on that uh natural gas moving up on the cold swell so we love that for Comstock S&amp;P 500 RIS premium people view this as a negative for equities CU it&#39;s at the lowest level in 25 years except what happened when the risk premium got this low what people are missing about this Equity risk premium is it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of the valuations of the top seven stocks so the last time you had Equity risk premium this this low was the last time that you saw dramatic outperformance of value small caps in Emerging Markets uh and the concentrated stocks like the cisos of the world get smoked which you can see here from 2001 to 2003 and that&#39;s when the quote unquote 493 equivalent back then just took off like nobody&#39;s business small caps took off like nobody&#39;s business Emerging Markets took off like nobody&#39;s business so everything points back to 2021 2022 in case we haven&#39;t mentioned that enough in the last 6 weeks it&#39;s been a historically bad few weeks for Value versus growth again you get that type of thing in 2001 uh and you got a bit of it in 2020 which was an unbelievable year   property prices are climbing again Apartments commercial property offices not so much commercial real estate Finance rebounds so uh those properties are starting to get financed that was part of that ver vernado thesis which which uh hit our fair value much quicker than expected   IPOs is magnificent 7 AM Mania so again I&#39;m not calling for anything I&#39;m just trying to represent cognizance for you guys to think about    the Magnificent 7 is way more extreme than the NASDAQ 100 bubble of the late 90s and the Nik bubble of the late 80s and the gold bubble of the 70s and the nifty50 of the late 60s before the 73 crash   Japan CPI this is what I was referring to their inflation is going up they will have to hike and all the mag s is right now is a levered uh carry trade that&#39;s where all the carry they borrow at zero and they invested in US risk assets and they benefit from the appreciation of the dollar relative to the Yen and they benefit from the free money it&#39;s a riskless trade until it becomes what do they say risk-free return until you get return free risk and that shifts quicker than you know and everyone gets a margin call on the same day and they you got a preview of coming attractions in early August it&#39;s just people forgot and they went right back to doing the exact same thing so   China May set the highest budget deficit in decades 4% of GDP everyone&#39;s still bearish   this is Larry Williams via Seth golden General Road maack for 2025 this guy&#39;s pretty good   his timing Cycles have worked really well over the last four years I always pay attention to him he&#39;s gotten a lot of stuff also wrong over the years which we all   make mistakes that&#39;s part of the game but   he&#39;s right more often than he&#39;s wrong and that&#39;s the name of the game as well   so he&#39;s pointing to continued weakness into February and then a rally into March and April we&#39;ll see I mean my general base case is that we should be strong into the inauguration a lot of new stuff will start to work into the inauguration and then the old stuff I think you you are going to see some profit taking in the mag 7   Euro areas GDP seen growing less strongly  if you had put $1 in stocks in 1801   your average return would have been about 7% a year compounded and that turned into 2.3 million $1 into 2.3 million unbelievable bonds $1 became 2,100 so same dollar do you want 2,100 or do you want 2.3 million it&#39;s not even close T bills that&#39;s why you want an equity manager not a bond manager t- bills   $1 became $245 gold gold guys you can&#39;t people can&#39;t get enough gold right now right everyone wants gold we&#39;ve been saying good luck with that $1 became $4 so if you buy gold now in 220 years you will have six if you buy $4 worth of gold you&#39;ll have $16 worth in2 200 20 years so   have at it if that&#39;s interesting to you and the dollar has been the worst performing investment so if you&#39;re sitting with dollars in the bank account and not invested in equities you are losing like nobody&#39;s business so    this is from a guy named Grant hawkridge a lot of talk about the breath thrust and it looks like it&#39;s going to be happening here has crossed the 10day count begins will Santa bring a breath thrust with him so   when breath quickly recovers from oversold conditions calculated using a 10 day   exponential moving average of the number of advancing stocks on the N NYSC divided by the total number of stocks in the NYC a Buy Signal occurs when the indicator moves from below 04 to above 6 within 10 trading days or less   signals rare the average gain   when you get this signal which we&#39;ll know in a few days   the S&amp;P 500 has always been higher six months later with an average gain of 16.2% so   you know there you go hope for a breath thrust in then zag Marty Z was a legend by the way hope for aw breath thrust   we pointed to the pmo by all and the pmo SPX hadn&#39;t hit zero it&#39;s now hit zero this thing&#39;s turning up we&#39;re off to the races and the National Association of active investment managers came down everything set up correctly merging stocks emerging market stocks wobble since Donald Trump&#39;s election they did the exact same thing in 2016 2017 and then took off after the inauguration China&#39;s fiscal stimulus has been conservative in recent years this is now accelerating\n\nyou know you got an activist including Elliot and starboard super smart guys but even now they&#39;re saying you know after all the things that they&#39;ve asked them to do about trimming costs attracting new users setting up Innovation uh he said if it fails to deliver quote We Believe changes must be considered including for match itself to go private once again and then they they&#39;ll just dividend out the cash to themselves so uh but you can see the trends here and the problem is is Tinder lot a lot lost a lot of users Badu has lost a lot of users bumbles uh Grinders H hinges going upwards but it&#39;s just too small so that&#39;s what we need to see to want to get involved in match it&#39;s like yeah revenues have been super flat that&#39;s probably from Price raises while they&#39;re losing clients is there stabilization of users or an acceleration of users that&#39;s when we want to get in when the stocks down 80% and uh the fundamentals are actually beginning to improve and is not yet reflected I don&#39;t quite see that just yet churn rate of the largest US companies has increased the average company tenure on S&P 500 Index 7year rolling average and what this says the implication from the Financial Times article is that the company seeks cease to exist I think the opposite is true I think the problem is is private Equity has been allocated too much money because they Mark to make make believe they don&#39;t have to mark to Market so pension managers like the even marks because they get to keep their jobs because they don&#39;t have to mark to Market every day and um so you&#39;ve gotten all this private Equity money and all they can do with it is continue to take companies private off the exchanges then lever them up and then refloat them back on the exchanges and candidly destroy a lot of them that they over lever in the interim so that&#39;s kind of why You See It trending down but I think a lot of this trend has a lot to do with um private equities involvement the other thing that it has to do with you can see here when it really collapsed is after sarbanes Oxley you had lower highs uh that destroyed the capital formation business in the US and the ability for smaller companies to list earlier like we had had historically hopefully Trump one could not get that done I know cudow was working on it uh hopefully Trump 2 can reverse some of the uh bad aspects of sarbanes Oxley that will enable more smaller companies to lift quickly and reduce public company costs and compliance ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS leverage loans defaults climb to four-year high so that&#39;s something to keep in mind a lot of crappy loans out there that you have to keep in mind C Conference board consumer confidence turned down this week which was kind of interesting uh consumer expectations turned down so you know regardless of what side of the aisle you&#39;re on uh little surprise there for people to keep in mind uh that um I think people are in the show me State of Mind initial exuberance and now it&#39;s like show me China car production share went from 1% to 39% in the last 20 years us went from 15% down to 3% asleep at the wheel while we&#39;re having Union fights they&#39;re producing cars and eating our lunch so um Japan doesn&#39;t face that they&#39;ve been able to keep share Europe is collapsing they used to have 35% share they dropped to about 133% share so um continue to make it hard for manufacturing to get energy continue to over regulate continue to uh do things that are against the the idea of staying competitive and you&#39;re going to see more and more of these type of things although I think the next four years is going to arrest this at least temporarily uh until the trend resumes sentiment for healthc care stocks is washed out we spent a whole two hours on this last week you can see another visualization you can see the 12mth forward PE ratio uh this is like shooting ducks in the barrel so whether it&#39;s xbi which we love and own whether it&#39;s Baxter which we love here and own which we covered last week uh again you know for those of you who&#39;ve been around we spend 80% of the time on the ones that haven&#39;t let left the station and less than 20% of the time you&#39;re lucky if you get 10 or 20% a week uh celebrating winners that that doesn&#39;t provide if you take care of the downside the upside takes care of itself and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done since day one and I think people have found that extremely valuable so if you&#39;re not looking in the health care sector you&#39;re missing an enormous opportunity in 2025 ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES high yield Bond volume so this is just ramping up high yield refinancings are going to accelerate because they&#39;re priced off the shorter end of the curve expect to see big stuff in q1 and Q2 uh and I think uh Cooper standard will have an opportunity to refinance a lot at lower levels especially if and when they report free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter which they should be able to with a November SAR annualized at 16.5 and estimates for the industry at 16.3 which we covered last week conservatively they could generate $4 of earnings if those conservative estimates are correct about industry volumes because everything after 15.8 goes straight to the bottom line and that&#39;s why we got involved with the trade when it was below 153 because of the operating leverage in the business it&#39;s just magnificent so yield curve has uninverted and stayed uninverted uh world&#39;s top automobile manufactured by sales I mean look what&#39;s happened to America and now you&#39;re going to have Nissan and Honda combined so effectively other than Suzuki which I I thought they made water skis I didn&#39;t even know they made cars uh jet skis rather um Stanis General Motors and Ford fall to the bottom of the list Hyundai motor and Kia who filled the need with the smaller cars is eating their lunch uh and Toyota is number one here are the top all-time favorite Christmas movies this is from Deutsche Bank uh Home Alone di hard love Love Actually It&#39;s a Wonderful Life elf National Lampoons Christmas Vacation might have to roll that out tonight on Christmas Eve National lamp Lampoon Christmas Vacation with the girls expose them to what real comedy is with Chevy Chase uh that&#39;ll be pretty awesome I will probably get out voted and wind up watching Home Alone too but uh such as life moving on after lagging for most of the second half 20 24 big Tech and mag 7 have outperformed the average stock in December so this was just a CA change that came after the election a short-term thing we saw the exact same thing in 2016 after the election and before the inauguration no way to hedge against that short-term move you just get it all on the back end in q1 and two Q2 gains of next year if you try to hedge you you create unnecessary tax events and then if someone else gets elected uh you&#39;re completely on the wrong side twice you created tax liability and you missed the upside so you know you just have to ride it through the beauty is you all get you always get back to the expected Trend uh it&#39;s just delayed to you know in this case a couple of months and then this will catch back up huge and uh be very exciting net profit margins continue to accelerate this is from fax set via Seth golden and expect margins net profit margins go from 12 12% this year to 13% next year so that&#39;s you know expanding margins is the mother&#39;s milk I mean earnings and margins is the name of the game here&#39;s from Zack tan who has been a longtime follower and um multiple time caller uh he posted on VF Corp he says I understand the oah effect of Kim cardashian resulting in the uh The North Face and skims collaboration selling out within minutes but did you know that Vans offthe wall had two releases last week and it sold out quickly as well uh they&#39;ve collaborated with Street Wear label rooted in B bike culture so these look cool by the way I mean out here in California I&#39;m you know seven blocks from the beach we walk there all the time uh everyone wears Vans and and now I actually fit in I was like the only guy wearing my green I&#39;ve got the green stands and I got the the low comfy cush and I got the same ones in white with green so I got green all green and I got the white with green um but everyone wears these and these are super popular um I mean even the golf pro wears Vans it&#39;s mindboggling uh at the country club like every everyone out here so I&#39;m excited to go back to New York in early January for to do a few days of media to walk down Fifth Avenue and see if it&#39;s actually spreading Beyond Orange County California uh because uh it looks like it the Stock&#39;s up a lot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really moving in the right direction this is from Charlie Bello talking about new highs this is the average returns you see the bulk of them are 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 and you can get a sense of the bell curve of returns since 1928 here&#39;s Emerging Markets total returns relative to the us so you can see Emerging Markets outperformed uh in the 80s and 90s us uh outperformed in 95 to 98 and then in 2 to 2010 Emerging Markets crushed the US for a decade and then in uh then us crushed emerging markets for the next decade and I think you&#39;re going to start to see Emerging Markets crush the US once again for the next uh handful of years ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS S&P 500 waiting of the top 10 Holdings this is going all the way back and you know you saw these peaks in 1980 we know what happened next 2000 we know what happened next uh 2020 we did see the big Tech correction in 2022 I think we could see something in that line not the 1999 uh type but something maybe a little bit more mild than 2022 but definitely an underperformance and a consolidation in 2025 in my view Apple price to sales ratio this is kind of interesting as well uh Apple&#39;s trading at 10 times sales with like I I haven&#39;t even looked at it lately but probably 5% earnings growth um forget about the PE multiple relative to you know the PEG ratio ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES um so this is all multiple expansion and this is all financed by the week Yen and I could talk about this on TV and and they would give me 2 seconds because no one wants to hear about this it&#39;s too complicated but I think the most important thing you have to pay attention to in 2025 is the Japanese Yen and as you see that appreciate I as the bank of Japan tries to raise rates because they&#39;re going to be forced to from or uh you start to see the Yen going up every perent the Yen moves up I would say the mag s basket&#39;s going to move down 2% if not more because there&#39;s just so much leverage the amount that they&#39;re borrowing to buy these mag seven stocks and you&#39;re just seeing it in the multiple expansion so if you think it&#39;s like ah us exceptionalism blah blah blah yeah there there&#39;s that but tell me that continues to hold true when the carry trade unwind and I&#39;ll tell you good luck with that idea uh here&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million to a billion in the last two weeks so uh this this is not the environment where high quality businesses that are marked down outperform uh this is when people want fart coin so God bless them uh when the calendar flips good luck ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK AMC entertainment same type of thing we saw what happens when people chase that stuff it doesn&#39;t end well Peter Lynch second quote the most important organ in the body as far as the stock market is concerned is the guts not the head anyone can acquire knowhow for analyzing stocks that&#39;s from Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why you know people always ask me why do you why do you share so many of your secrets blah blah blah and I said I could I could number one I share a lot but I don&#39;t share everything number two uh I could could give 100% of the Playbook every single week and write a book step by step and at the end of the day it couldn&#39;t be replicated because of the intangible of understanding the emotions of the market and the only way you get that uh and you get the pattern recognition and you get the ice in your veins one one is it&#39;s genetic that&#39;s just period so you have to be part of this 1% of oddballs that that are just wired this way and number two uh um it&#39;s experience you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just experience and I&#39;ll be uh I&#39;ll be it&#39;s it&#39;s the only business it&#39;s like age you get better with age I mean Buffett if you look at Buffett&#39;s net worth I think his biggest gains happened between like percentage gains happened between age like 70 and 90 or something along those lines so because you it&#39;s just as money compounds knowledge compounds so so um so that&#39;s that\n\nstock market and sentiment results  so each week we cover one to two stocks we&#39;ve discussed in previous podcast video cast and or own for clients personally this week we&#39;re going to cover crown castle the number one thing you need to know about crown castle is that like all other REITs it trades with interest rates when the 10year yield goes down all REITs benefit including crown castle in the chart below you can find crown castle in black and red that&#39;s right here uh overlaid with TLT the 10 20-year treasury ETF in blue that&#39;s right here and the re index in purple that&#39;s right here as bond yields have fallen yields went up REITs have fallen as their plays on yields right now the dividend yield on crown castle is 6.9% stock is down from 180 down to 90 it got as low as 78 uh we had been pounding the table it rallied to 120 it&#39;s back to 90 We&#39;ll add more which we&#39;ve been doing and this thing will be back to New highs in a few years we&#39;ll collect a 7% dividend in the meantime which by the way they&#39;ll raise so our yield on cap on principal will even get higher and uh they\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  got W rid of the Dead weight fiber business which we&#39;re going to talk about now uh we have made the case for bonds getting bid yields going down in 2025 hedge funds and large Traders red line at the bottom down here uh have not been positioned this short 10year treasury since September 2018 that was right over here which preceded a major rally in bonds right here commercials the true smart money green line at the bottom right here uh are near record long they haven&#39;t been this long since September 2018 right before huge rally in in bonds compression in yields commercials are always early and mostly right we can debate the reasons why bonds will get bid from positive to negative fiscal responsibility Doge okay uh flight to safety geopolitical uncertainty less issuance due to higher tax receipts these are just guesses positioning tells me a lot more than predicting the quote Best Catalyst someone of course with no skin in the game reached out to me saying quote CCI is down because they&#39;re only getting 8 billion for the fiber business end quote this is utter nonsense disposing the money losing fiber business will leave behind a cash flow machine that requires little maintenance with lower cap X spend moving forward they should pay someone to take it off their hands never mind get 8 billion that&#39;s whipped cream CCI is down because every read is down every read is down because bonds are temporarily down just like they were after Trump got elected in 2016 just like they got bid in 2017 every read is temporarily down end of story here&#39;s this daily CCI with TLT overlay effectively the exact same chart the blue line is TLT the red and black is uh CCI nothing to do with fiber disposition it&#39;s been doing the exact same damn thing before the new thing was announced in case we haven&#39;t mentioned it enough in the last few weeks the same thing happened after president Trump was elected in November 2016 bonds and REITs and CCI sold off after the inauguration in January 2017 they all rallied sell the rumor bu the news election crash inauguration rally straight up almost uh 70% move in less than a year after the inauguration here&#39;s the 2016 to 2017 Cal calendar flip with CCI and bonds TLT and blue before and after the inauguration straight up ladies and gentlemen sold after the election bought after the inauguration as a relevant side note we want to congrat congratulate all the new clients who joined us during 2024 we also want to Express gratitude and congratulate the existing clients who have been with us for a while you could not be better positioned for what is about to take place in coming weeks and months before and after the inauguration we&#39;ve been hard at work getting you ready for what it what is about to happen those of you who watch the last few weeks podcast video cast have a sample idea of what I&#39;m referring to a sample idea in light of this imminent Outlook we will be reopening to smaller accounts the $1 million plus accounts for q1 a few days earlier than normal due to the rare conditions now in place to put money to work very attractively existing clients know we have been busy at work taking advantage over the past week due to demand from longtime listeners of the podcast who understand what is setting up per our recent podcast video cast as well as new referrals that we&#39;ve received we&#39;ve already begun Fielding in for new clients this week and sending them out the paperwork we are doing this so that those who are a mutual fit can begin deploying Capital as early as January 2nd after their applications are approved you may enter in your info here uh uh this is a hyperlink where you enter your contact information on hedgefund tips.com again all of this is opinion not advice uh all this check with your financial advis not a solicitation etc etc uh do what&#39;s in you you feel is in your interest uh but when you enter that information you&#39;ll be able to be among the first callbacks we will close this opening for q1 well before the inauguration on January 20th uh as we expect to be fully positioned across the board well beforehand um probably a lot well beforehand so those that I&#39;m talking to this week are going to be uh in good shape larger $5 to10 million accounts can access open enrollment here and back to CCI so look the reason I start with the long-term chart is you can see crown castle is a story of Corrections followed by recoveries Corrections followed up by recoveries early 2000s uh 2008 2009 etc etc etc this time will be no different and you can see the um revenues per share continue to climb the cash flow per share funds from operations Steady As She Goes The Last Five Years slow recovery earnings same type of things so there was a little dip after covid it will recover you&#39;re going to get rid of some of that burn from the fiber business now that they&#39;re dumping it they&#39;ll pay down some debt bring down interest costs uh here are 10 key points from the earnings call The Organic Revenue growth of 5.2% uh Tower segment growth of 4.3% 25% growth in small Sal segment maintain the full year outlook for adjusted e eida and affo wireless data usage surpassed 100 trillion megabytes uh in last year so the demand continues to grow uh supporting their optimistic view on future growth uh expected Consolidated organic Revenue growth of approximately 5% for 2024 including 4.5% towers and 10% in small cells plans to add 11 to 13,000 new small cell nodes in 2024 uh indicating continued expansion strong financial position with company raising 1.25 billion in long-term debt reducing leverage to 5.5 times net debt to eidon now they&#39;re getting another $8 billion from the sale of the fiber money losing fiber business uh strategic cancellation of 7,000 low yielding nodes expected to save approximately $800 million in future cap X ongoing digitization of the tower portfolio to enhance marketable space visibility and improve customer service efficiency so um so they&#39;re talking about the sale of 18 billion 8 billion they&#39;ve blown $19 billion of capital over the years into this stupid money losing business so they&#39;re now cutting their losses and getting on with it um and now they can return to operating their highquality Tower portfolio and return greater amounts of shares to cashh Holders Buy in float reduce the debt uh many investors have long pushed for Crown to dispose of the fiber assets namely Elliot management",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nhere from Peter Lynch the worst thing you can do is invest in companies you know nothing about unfortunately buying stocks on ignorance is still a popular American Pastime uh you know and you&#39;re seeing it more and more lately that&#39;s going to change very soon but uh in the meantime just sit back uh and pray to God you did not get uh fomo jeans because that&#39;s what&#39;ll get you in trouble so let&#39;s go through some of the uh economic data of the week we&#39;re going to do an abbreviated session we might get this one under an hour here for Christmas Eve let&#39;s see if we can pull it off I always say that and then it&#39;s two hours every single week but uh China&#39;s oneye bond yields tumble below 1% not what we want to see but uh exactly what you see right before every major rally in China&#39;s stock so you saw it in 2009 monster rally you saw it in 2016 monster rally 2018 you saw it in uh 20 monster rally so we&#39;re going to see it again here this is going to turn up in 2025 and we are going to be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways uh so that&#39;s that here&#39;s manufacturing PMI uh started to turn up Philly fed manufacturing still turning down so that&#39;s just a regional survey Bank of Japan UA hints at chance of later rate hike sending Yen lower they have no choice when you look at the Japanese data inflation is going up they are going to have to hike uh and we saw a preview of coming attractions in August when they did that what got monkey Hammer smashed people have such a short memory is mag 7 all mag 7 is is a levered play on the carry trade when the carry trade unwinds those 37% weightings in the S&P are going to change very quickly ladies and gentlemen uh doesn&#39;t mean the businesses are bad doesn&#39;t mean anything they&#39;re still going to generate cash what it does mean is they&#39;ll be R-rated in accordance with the cost of capital that is financing the aberrational valuations and we don&#39;t want to be there when that day happens China May set highest budget deficit in decades so they&#39;re going to 4% GDP everyone says they&#39;re not doing enough we covered last week repeatedly China is in the uh most easy financial conditions that they&#39;ve been since 2016 right before a monster rally and then prior to that uh 2020 2016 then 2009 and then going back to 200000 which again all preceded monster rallies in Chinese equities uh we covered a bunch of these charts last week we got the bounce that we were looking for people were running for the hills we said it&#39;s going to take a couple days and we&#39;re going right back up and we showed you 10 indicators and that&#39;s exactly what happened small is greater than large cap expectations rise uh to the highest since May of 2021 um small cap will outperform the large cap we&#39;re going to cover some some data as to why we believe this is true and you saw inclinations of that back in the early 2000s as well which is when they outperformed retail sales ladies and gentlemen look what led the way bigly motor vehicle and auto parts dealers and what&#39;s beautiful is it&#39;s happening right according to plan people are moving down the Spectrum they&#39;re buying smaller cars but they&#39;re buying larger quantity and that is beautiful for Cooper standard because whether the car is small or large you still got to seal the windows and doors and you got to uh transfer fluid and uh uh Fuel and all those wonderful beautiful things that Cooper standard does Nvidia versus super micro if you remember super micro was the same type of parabolic chart uh it&#39;s uh absolutely completely collapsed went from one uh so it went from 10 to 120 and 120 back to 20 had a dead cat bounce here this will go back below 20 and it doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re the same type of businesses it doesn&#39;t mean that&#39;s going to happen necessarily these analoges don&#39;t mean much but you do have to be cognizant of what you&#39;re dealing with 10-year treasury yield versus TLT so you can see this broad massive Divergence we haven&#39;t seen since uh 2020 and then uh 2018 which we talk about a lot then 2010 and what happened in all of these instances is we saw big rallies in Treasure Ines compressions of yields just another way to look at it here&#39;s another useless analog but it puts things in perspective so you can be cognizant of your surroundings uh this is NVIDIA versus Cisco stock prices you could see what it looked like in 1999 when it shot up from you know 10 bucks to 80 bucks and then collapsed uh you know it&#39;s kind of it&#39;s kind of odd though the charts do look eerily similar you had this first move a check back a little consolidation then you put in this top then you do a check back then you do another one I mean I it doesn&#39;t mean that that&#39;s going to happen I certainly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have a tech wreck I do think we&#39;re going to have a tech underperformance uh and um uh just keep it on your screens because Cisco was the exact same type of exciting narrative and uh we we know how that worked and it&#39;s taken you know 25 years it still has not gotten back to the same levels this is for macro charts uh this is put volume on the TLT hasn&#39;t peaked this much since 2011 right before you got a big rally in bonds and then when went again 2018 when uh managers and hedge funds were a record short which we&#39;ve referenced many times so you see this much put volume with everyone&#39;s so certain that yields are going to 5% guarantee uh as close to a guarantee as you can get in life that bonds are going to Rally in the first quarter of 20125 and uh what whatever the reason we&#39;ll see but um oh it&#39;s interesting I wanted to I didn&#39;t quite put it in uh there was an article about waste in the New York Post and um Ron Paul listed or Rand Paul listed all these pet peeve projects he wanted to get rid of one was I think they spent a million dollars determining whether mice uh sought out cocaine uh more if they were lonely mice or not lonely mice you know your taxpayer put to work your taxpayer funds put to work uh uh you know unbelievable but they&#39;re going to cut all this nonsense that is going to be bullish and it doesn&#39;t mean me they&#39;re going to cut 2 trillion it just means that the perception around the fiscal recklessness is going to be changed and once the perception changes you will see a big change in uh the the way the bonds trade okay this\n\nmaybe there was a little bump on that uh natural gas moving up on the cold swell so we love that for Comstock S&amp;P 500 RIS premium people view this as a negative for equities CU it&#39;s at the lowest level in 25 years except what happened when the risk premium got this low what people are missing about this Equity risk premium is it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of the valuations of the top seven stocks so the last time you had Equity risk premium this this low was the last time that you saw dramatic outperformance of value small caps in Emerging Markets uh and the concentrated stocks like the cisos of the world get smoked which you can see here from 2001 to 2003 and that&#39;s when the quote unquote 493 equivalent back then just took off like nobody&#39;s business small caps took off like nobody&#39;s business Emerging Markets took off like nobody&#39;s business so everything points back to 2021 2022 in case we haven&#39;t mentioned that enough in the last 6 weeks it&#39;s been a historically bad few weeks for Value versus growth again you get that type of thing in 2001 uh and you got a bit of it in 2020 which was an unbelievable year   property prices are climbing again Apartments commercial property offices not so much commercial real estate Finance rebounds so uh those properties are starting to get financed that was part of that ver vernado thesis which which uh hit our fair value much quicker than expected   IPOs is magnificent 7 AM Mania so again I&#39;m not calling for anything I&#39;m just trying to represent cognizance for you guys to think about    the Magnificent 7 is way more extreme than the NASDAQ 100 bubble of the late 90s and the Nik bubble of the late 80s and the gold bubble of the 70s and the nifty50 of the late 60s before the 73 crash   Japan CPI this is what I was referring to their inflation is going up they will have to hike and all the mag s is right now is a levered uh carry trade that&#39;s where all the carry they borrow at zero and they invested in US risk assets and they benefit from the appreciation of the dollar relative to the Yen and they benefit from the free money it&#39;s a riskless trade until it becomes what do they say risk-free return until you get return free risk and that shifts quicker than you know and everyone gets a margin call on the same day and they you got a preview of coming attractions in early August it&#39;s just people forgot and they went right back to doing the exact same thing so   China May set the highest budget deficit in decades 4% of GDP everyone&#39;s still bearish   this is Larry Williams via Seth golden General Road maack for 2025 this guy&#39;s pretty good   his timing Cycles have worked really well over the last four years I always pay attention to him he&#39;s gotten a lot of stuff also wrong over the years which we all   make mistakes that&#39;s part of the game but   he&#39;s right more often than he&#39;s wrong and that&#39;s the name of the game as well   so he&#39;s pointing to continued weakness into February and then a rally into March and April we&#39;ll see I mean my general base case is that we should be strong into the inauguration a lot of new stuff will start to work into the inauguration and then the old stuff I think you you are going to see some profit taking in the mag 7   Euro areas GDP seen growing less strongly  if you had put $1 in stocks in 1801   your average return would have been about 7% a year compounded and that turned into 2.3 million $1 into 2.3 million unbelievable bonds $1 became 2,100 so same dollar do you want 2,100 or do you want 2.3 million it&#39;s not even close T bills that&#39;s why you want an equity manager not a bond manager t- bills   $1 became $245 gold gold guys you can&#39;t people can&#39;t get enough gold right now right everyone wants gold we&#39;ve been saying good luck with that $1 became $4 so if you buy gold now in 220 years you will have six if you buy $4 worth of gold you&#39;ll have $16 worth in2 200 20 years so   have at it if that&#39;s interesting to you and the dollar has been the worst performing investment so if you&#39;re sitting with dollars in the bank account and not invested in equities you are losing like nobody&#39;s business so    this is from a guy named Grant hawkridge a lot of talk about the breath thrust and it looks like it&#39;s going to be happening here has crossed the 10day count begins will Santa bring a breath thrust with him so   when breath quickly recovers from oversold conditions calculated using a 10 day   exponential moving average of the number of advancing stocks on the N NYSC divided by the total number of stocks in the NYC a Buy Signal occurs when the indicator moves from below 04 to above 6 within 10 trading days or less   signals rare the average gain   when you get this signal which we&#39;ll know in a few days   the S&amp;P 500 has always been higher six months later with an average gain of 16.2% so   you know there you go hope for a breath thrust in then zag Marty Z was a legend by the way hope for aw breath thrust   we pointed to the pmo by all and the pmo SPX hadn&#39;t hit zero it&#39;s now hit zero this thing&#39;s turning up we&#39;re off to the races and the National Association of active investment managers came down everything set up correctly merging stocks emerging market stocks wobble since Donald Trump&#39;s election they did the exact same thing in 2016 2017 and then took off after the inauguration China&#39;s fiscal stimulus has been conservative in recent years this is now accelerating\n\nyou know you got an activist including Elliot and starboard super smart guys but even now they&#39;re saying you know after all the things that they&#39;ve asked them to do about trimming costs attracting new users setting up Innovation uh he said if it fails to deliver quote We Believe changes must be considered including for match itself to go private once again and then they they&#39;ll just dividend out the cash to themselves so uh but you can see the trends here and the problem is is Tinder lot a lot lost a lot of users Badu has lost a lot of users bumbles uh Grinders H hinges going upwards but it&#39;s just too small so that&#39;s what we need to see to want to get involved in match it&#39;s like yeah revenues have been super flat that&#39;s probably from Price raises while they&#39;re losing clients is there stabilization of users or an acceleration of users that&#39;s when we want to get in when the stocks down 80% and uh the fundamentals are actually beginning to improve and is not yet reflected I don&#39;t quite see that just yet churn rate of the largest US companies has increased the average company tenure on S&P 500 Index 7year rolling average and what this says the implication from the Financial Times article is that the company seeks cease to exist I think the opposite is true I think the problem is is private Equity has been allocated too much money because they Mark to make make believe they don&#39;t have to mark to Market so pension managers like the even marks because they get to keep their jobs because they don&#39;t have to mark to Market every day and um so you&#39;ve gotten all this private Equity money and all they can do with it is continue to take companies private off the exchanges then lever them up and then refloat them back on the exchanges and candidly destroy a lot of them that they over lever in the interim so that&#39;s kind of why You See It trending down but I think a lot of this trend has a lot to do with um private equities involvement the other thing that it has to do with you can see here when it really collapsed is after sarbanes Oxley you had lower highs uh that destroyed the capital formation business in the US and the ability for smaller companies to list earlier like we had had historically hopefully Trump one could not get that done I know cudow was working on it uh hopefully Trump 2 can reverse some of the uh bad aspects of sarbanes Oxley that will enable more smaller companies to lift quickly and reduce public company costs and compliance ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS leverage loans defaults climb to four-year high so that&#39;s something to keep in mind a lot of crappy loans out there that you have to keep in mind C Conference board consumer confidence turned down this week which was kind of interesting uh consumer expectations turned down so you know regardless of what side of the aisle you&#39;re on uh little surprise there for people to keep in mind uh that um I think people are in the show me State of Mind initial exuberance and now it&#39;s like show me China car production share went from 1% to 39% in the last 20 years us went from 15% down to 3% asleep at the wheel while we&#39;re having Union fights they&#39;re producing cars and eating our lunch so um Japan doesn&#39;t face that they&#39;ve been able to keep share Europe is collapsing they used to have 35% share they dropped to about 133% share so um continue to make it hard for manufacturing to get energy continue to over regulate continue to uh do things that are against the the idea of staying competitive and you&#39;re going to see more and more of these type of things although I think the next four years is going to arrest this at least temporarily uh until the trend resumes sentiment for healthc care stocks is washed out we spent a whole two hours on this last week you can see another visualization you can see the 12mth forward PE ratio uh this is like shooting ducks in the barrel so whether it&#39;s xbi which we love and own whether it&#39;s Baxter which we love here and own which we covered last week uh again you know for those of you who&#39;ve been around we spend 80% of the time on the ones that haven&#39;t let left the station and less than 20% of the time you&#39;re lucky if you get 10 or 20% a week uh celebrating winners that that doesn&#39;t provide if you take care of the downside the upside takes care of itself and that&#39;s what we&#39;ve always done since day one and I think people have found that extremely valuable so if you&#39;re not looking in the health care sector you&#39;re missing an enormous opportunity in 2025 ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES high yield Bond volume so this is just ramping up high yield refinancings are going to accelerate because they&#39;re priced off the shorter end of the curve expect to see big stuff in q1 and Q2 uh and I think uh Cooper standard will have an opportunity to refinance a lot at lower levels especially if and when they report free cash flow positive in the fourth quarter which they should be able to with a November SAR annualized at 16.5 and estimates for the industry at 16.3 which we covered last week conservatively they could generate $4 of earnings if those conservative estimates are correct about industry volumes because everything after 15.8 goes straight to the bottom line and that&#39;s why we got involved with the trade when it was below 153 because of the operating leverage in the business it&#39;s just

Vacation with the girls expose them to what real comedy is with Chevy Chase uh that&#39;ll be pretty awesome I will probably get out voted and wind up watching Home Alone too but uh such as life moving on after lagging for most of the second half 20 24 big Tech and mag 7 have outperformed the average stock in December so this was just a CA change that came after the election a short-term thing we saw the exact same thing in 2016 after the election and before the inauguration no way to hedge against that short-term move you just get it all on the back end in q1 and two Q2 gains of next year if you try to hedge you you create unnecessary tax events and then if someone else gets elected uh you&#39;re completely on the wrong side twice you created tax liability and you missed the upside so you know you just have to ride it through the beauty is you all get you always get back to the expected Trend uh it&#39;s just delayed to you know in this case a couple of months and then this will catch back up huge and uh be very exciting net profit margins continue to accelerate this is from fax set via Seth golden and expect margins net profit margins go from 12 12% this year to 13% next year so that&#39;s you know expanding margins is the mother&#39;s milk I mean earnings and margins is the name of the game here&#39;s from Zack tan who has been a longtime follower and um multiple time caller uh he posted on VF Corp he says I understand the oah effect of Kim cardashian resulting in the uh The North Face and skims collaboration selling out within minutes but did you know that Vans offthe wall had two releases last week and it sold out quickly as well uh they&#39;ve collaborated with Street Wear label rooted in B bike culture so these look cool by the way I mean out here in California I&#39;m you know seven blocks from the beach we walk there all the time uh everyone wears Vans and and now I actually fit in I was like the only guy wearing my green I&#39;ve got the green stands and I got the the low comfy cush and I got the same ones in white with green so I got green all green and I got the white with green um but everyone wears these and these are super popular um I mean even the golf pro wears Vans it&#39;s mindboggling uh at the country club like every everyone out here so I&#39;m excited to go back to New York in early January for to do a few days of media to walk down Fifth Avenue and see if it&#39;s actually spreading Beyond Orange County California uh because uh it looks like it the Stock&#39;s up a lot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really moving in the right direction this is from Charlie Bello talking about new highs this is the average returns you see the bulk of them are 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 and you can get a sense of the bell curve of returns since 1928 here&#39;s Emerging Markets total returns relative to the us so you can see Emerging Markets outperformed uh in the 80s and 90s us uh outperformed in 95 to 98 and then in 2 to 2010 Emerging Markets crushed the US for a decade and then in uh then us crushed emerging markets for the next decade and I think you&#39;re going to start to see Emerging Markets crush the US once again for the next uh handful of years ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS S&P 500 waiting of the top 10 Holdings this is going all the way back and you know you saw these peaks in 1980 we know what happened next 2000 we know what happened next uh 2020 we did see the big Tech correction in 2022 I think we could see something in that line not the 1999 uh type but something maybe a little bit more mild than 2022 but definitely an underperformance and a consolidation in 2025 in my view Apple price to sales ratio this is kind of interesting as well uh Apple&#39;s trading at 10 times sales with like I I haven&#39;t even looked at it lately but probably 5% earnings growth um forget about the PE multiple relative to you know the PEG ratio ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES um so this is all multiple expansion and this is all financed by the week Yen and I could talk about this on TV and and they would give me 2 seconds because no one wants to hear about this it&#39;s too complicated but I think the most important thing you have to pay attention to in 2025 is the Japanese Yen and as you see that appreciate I as the bank of Japan tries to raise rates because they&#39;re going to be forced to from or uh you start to see the Yen going up every perent the Yen moves up I would say the mag s basket&#39;s going to move down 2% if not more because there&#39;s just so much leverage the amount that they&#39;re borrowing to buy these mag seven stocks and you&#39;re just seeing it in the multiple expansion so if you think it&#39;s like ah us exceptionalism blah blah blah yeah there there&#39;s that but tell me that continues to hold true when the carry trade unwind and I&#39;ll tell you good luck with that idea uh here&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million to a billion in the last two weeks so uh this this is not the environment where high quality businesses that are marked down outperform uh this is when people want fart coin so God bless them uh when the calendar flips good luck ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK AMC entertainment same type of thing we saw what happens when people chase that stuff it doesn&#39;t end well Peter Lynch second quote the most important organ in the body as far as the stock market is concerned is the guts not the head anyone can acquire knowhow for analyzing stocks that&#39;s from Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why you know people always ask me why do you why do you share so many of your secrets blah blah blah and I said I could I could number one I share a lot but I don&#39;t share everything number two uh I could could give 100% of the Playbook every single week and write a book step by step and at the end of the day it couldn&#39;t be replicated because of the intangible of understanding the emotions of the market and the only way you get that uh and you get the pattern recognition and you get the ice in your veins one one is it&#39;s genetic that&#39;s just period so you have to be part of this 1% of oddballs that that are just wired this way and number two uh um it&#39;s experience you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just experience and I&#39;ll be uh I&#39;ll be it&#39;s it&#39;s the only business it&#39;s like age you get better with age I mean Buffett if you look at Buffett&#39;s net worth I think his biggest gains happened between like percentage gains happened between age like 70 and 90 or something along those lines so because you it&#39;s just as money compounds knowledge compounds so so um so that&#39;s that",

can help me solve this riddle as you Buffett fan and share a lot of common ground with Burk share and your approach Burk share has been buying up shares as serious and owns a third of the company now that caused me to do some due diligence before attempting to follow them in I&#39;m sorry to say I cannot get to what their thesis is revenues declining streaming music spaces plenty of competition I see little mo annual cash flows been declining since 2020 when I apply your approach I come up with a pass any light that you can shed I come come up at the past two number one is you don&#39;t know who&#39;s buying it sometimes it&#39;s the lieutenants sometimes it&#39;s Buffett at this stage it&#39;s mostly the lieutenant I have zero interest in Sirius this is a cigar butt and um I want a higher quality business than that Dustin Dickerson thanks for sharing your investing knowledge uh with us like buffin and Munger have over the years truly a givers mentality uh okay thank you Dustin appreciate that question for you on Baba&#39;s repurchases are they using other means to repurchase shares other than open market repurchases uh know used employee Banks to help them reduce large amounts instead of open market purchases didn&#39;t seem like Baba used all Bond proceeds his past quarter repurchase yeah look you won&#39;t know the magnitude of anything till they report number one number two who cares I mean at the end of the day they bought in a ton of stock they&#39;re going to continue to buy stock they&#39;re also going to invest where they can get a higher return on Capital than their weighted average cost of capital they&#39;re going to continue to do that I&#39;d rather they stop doing BuyBacks and find those parts of the business that are generating 20 25% return on Capital and put all the excess money there uh versus just buying in stock and I think buying in stock was all there was to do when everything was going down now that the economy is recovering and the stimulus is coming they got to be positioned to uh uh not only retain their part of the pi the pi is probably going to grow 30% and if they can keep share you&#39;re going to get multiples of that in terms of returns so I wouldn&#39;t worry about that you got the stock connect happening they&#39;ve got cash to buy in stock they&#39;ve done it opportunistically they&#39;ll continue to do it opportunistically but you want some confidence that they&#39;re actually reinvesting capital in the business because they see growth and I think that&#39;s what you&#39;re going to start to see in coming quarters is um better higher and better uses return on Capital than just simple uh simple BuyBacks just go to the cftc website they publish it every Friday uh or the other services finviz Etc uh we show it all in the podcast uh Tom thanks thank you for the podcast I share it with a lot of people I&#39;m interested in your opinion about a company called Danos Corp DAC that&#39;s from youv all shw okay da a I think someone gave this to us last week you know here&#39;s a stock that&#39;s up from $215 to $80 uh got to 95 now it&#39;s pulled back to 80 and you&#39;re interested so H you missed it okay so maybe it goes up more let&#39;s take a look at the business uh I forget this fomo guys don&#39;t send me stocks that are up 40x off the low send me stocks when they&#39;re in the hole and I&#39;ll tell you if it makes sense to take a punt by solvency risk analysis and getting Comfort if they&#39;re not going out of business and the revenues and cash flow are doing okay and it&#39;s a temporary impairment that&#39;s where you make a dry bulk these things are no thank you uh hard pass on shipping companies for the most part unless it&#39;s the best operator in the business Etc and even then you got to get the cyclical timing perfect and it&#39;s just a train wreck to incinerate money uh at a healthy clip Drew burn uh next time I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel by the way I&#39;m not getting on you you having the courage to send in that question probably just helped you know several hundred or seven, people had a similar idea just stay away even if I&#39;m wrong and the thing doubles in the next 12 months the following 12 months it&#39;ll be down 80% so don&#39;t lose sleep and uh just extract the um fomo Gene from your repertoire Drew burn grateful for your thoughts on trip advisor as the current valuation uh thanks for all your fantastic content 2024 Merry Christmas and the best of you and your uh thank you drew Merry Christmas to you thank you for your years of continued unwavering support I appreciate that trip advisor is not my bag but I think it&#39;s like okay from a financial standpoint we get this one every few weeks and uh We&#39;ve not done anything with it and I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve missed anything some of these actually go out of business like um the hell was that other one that was popular so this thing&#39;s gone down with cash flow margin continue to decline revenues are going up I don&#39;t love this I I don&#39;t like these businesses I don&#39;t think they I mean when you put in Google anything it&#39;s like I I see what you&#39;re saying here but I mean we got like record travel let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening with Expedia the higher quality my guess is this is down because they&#39;re no longer relevant yeah look at ESP speedia breaking out to new highs um what&#39;s the other one I don&#39;t even know so ah I know it&#39;s you know you&#39;re looking at this thing saying is there one more puff in it and I&#39;m saying smoking is hazardous to your health they probably did an acquisition here to try to that&#39;s what all see do when they&#39;re trying to keep their job they do unnecessary bad Acquisitions to make it look like the business is growing and incinerate shareholder money I mean the balance Sheet&#39;s good enough if you want I mean it&#39;s definitely beaten down if you want to take a punt and hope for the best but when the industry is going up and they can&#39;t find their way to the coffee machine it&#39;s usually not a good sign let&#39;s see what happened to shares outstanding I mean they&#39;re not deluding it that much this is a trade my man this is not going to be a long-term thing it might be a good trade um I&#39;ll leave it at that I understand how you got there okay so Sarah Jacobs love your podcast learn so much about adopting good investment framework during one of your October podcasts you be Fen your album marrow I&#39;d like to know this a company you&#39;re considering leaning into more and lium surplus may impact the company&#39;s profitability over the next one to three years do you think there&#39;s a good quality business will recover over time uh yeah I uh leaning into I mean I want to get more materials exposure so yeah I&#39;d probably put new money to work here um and yes it is going to take a couple years to work through but I think a lot of that&#39;s priced in I mean the stock on 66% it&#39;s a durable business over many decades I think you know we covered a a really we didn&#39;t cover it briefly we did a whole article on it and we talked about how the West EV demand has slown down slowed down and the China is like the whole EV market and it keeps growing so uh I kind of like it here I like materials I like I like everything about it so um yeah hope that helps Jimmy Jones another question about Baba backs wrong question question is return on invested Capital if they can get a better return on invested Capital now that they have business segments growing like opening up Morocco International um uh the splitting the cloud consumer and business and um they arrested the decline in share from pindu Duo and Teemu uh and they did all that stuff with investment that&#39;s what they should be doing because they&#39;ll get you know if they buy in if they use a third of the cash to buy in 10% of the float it&#39;s not going to move the needle as much as investing in 25% return on Capital segments of their business so I hope that slows down they bought in enough stock and uh I hope they&#39;re telling a story about how they&#39;re deploying at 20% plus returns that&#39;s what I hired them for by the way an idiot could go in and buy back the stock I&#39;m looking for someone that can reignite growth and it seems like the segments are starting to do that one by one hey Tom hope you&#39;re doing great Carl Z metatech Leading Edge technology and iare mother company uh super interesting stuff asml wouldn&#39;t be able to produce their machines without them okay so this is called Carl Ze okay stocks down with cash flow revenues have been flat the last two years margins are declining stock&#39;s down 80% 75% this looks like a broken momentum stock um let&#39;s see here balance sheet I can&#39;t be right 22 million how much debt 400 I got $20 million of cash according to this you got better double check this and uh $445 million of debt no bueno uh this is toast if they don&#39;t do something they&#39;ll do something something but uh $178 million of free cash flow all right you&#39;re going to have to just figure out when all their debt comes due how much it is to service it a percentage of free cash flow I I mean this is a solvency thing I don&#39;t love it to be honest with you this one I don&#39;t love it I think it it goes lower and by the way even if it bounces chances are you know bounces up to 80 you&#39;ll have another chance to buy it at 60 once it&#39;s stabilized and the fundamentals are better so I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t rush into this I I like your analysis and how you got there I&#39;m just not in a in a rush uh some very cheap automakers Mazda 7261 could you look at the stock I don&#39;t buy oems I think they&#39;re just garbage businesses um they&#39;re going to be a race to the bottom in margins Cooper standards going to benefit I want picks and shovels let all the gold prospectors go broke we&#39;ll sell them the shovels and that&#39;s basically what these Mazda and uh Honda and um or Nissan and Etc so yeah it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s cheap for a reason because labor Parts uh race to the bottom uh not interested Ford&#39;s been cheap for 25 years U Max M toall asking about gxo no change in gxo just going to take a

up 9% median 3.7% average up 12 months 17.9% average 17.3 so the implication is from these signals 17 up 17% a year out that seems a little rich but wouldn&#39;t shock me uh uh you know presidential cycle we covered the desial cycle last last week um we&#39;re more in the 8 to 12% for the indices and dramatic outperformance for under the indices but um we&#39;ll keep an open mind for that people already front loading possible tariffs um yeah that&#39;s silly season we&#39;ll see how that plays out uh us pce price index came in lower than expected uh there are some articles about what they would have done with that Dot Plot had they seen this number ahead of time we&#39;ll see inflation expectations coming down monopolies monopolizing returns and market cap here&#39;s market cap of S&P 500 versus uh uh unmagnify so these things have really really gotten away um and we&#39;ll see if that door closes either by the unmagnify up or the Magnificent catching down I think it&#39;s going to be the UNM magnificent catching up uh Bull and Bear indicator still suppressed so that doesn&#39;t you know that&#39;s not what you see at tops what you see at tops is 8 to 10 extreme bullishness we&#39;re not there yet although we do have over allocations of equity allocations um here we have debt allocation at 19% as a percentage of Holdings so that&#39;s near record lows I think that&#39;s going to be an opportunity in 2025 I think TLT is going to get bid I think uh CCI as a result of that is going to get bid all the reats are going to get bid this shows government spending from the CBO and Wells Fargo what is mandatory what is discretionary and what is net interest uh mandatory is 4.1 trillion which is 14.5% of GDP P that&#39;s Social Security Medicare Medicaid income Security Programs other discretionary is non-defense and defense that&#39;s about 1.8 trillion net interest is 949 billion so uh here&#39;s the mandatory spending shows all the benefits to give you an idea Canada retail sales month- on- Monon for vehicles was also off the charts just like us which which is interesting because the us we seed well maybe some of that was replacement from the hurricanes in Florida but when you see that although there are a lot of Canadians in Florida that&#39;s for sure uh so maybe there was a little bump on that uh natural gas moving up on the cold swell so we love that for Comstock S&P 500 RIS premium people view this as a negative for equities CU it&#39;s at the lowest level in 25 years except what happened when the risk premium got this low what people are missing about this Equity risk premium is it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of the valuations of the top seven stocks so the last time you had Equity risk premium this this low was the last time that you saw dramatic outperformance of value small caps in Emerging Markets uh and the concentrated stocks like the cisos of the world get smoked which you can see here from 2001 to 2003 and that&#39;s when the quote unquote 493 equivalent back then just took off like nobody&#39;s business small caps took off like nobody&#39;s business Emerging Markets took off like nobody&#39;s business so everything points back to 2021 2022 in case we haven&#39;t mentioned that enough in the last 6 weeks it&#39;s been a historically bad few weeks for Value versus growth again you get that type of thing in 2001 uh

has a lot to do with um private equities involvement the other thing that it has to do with you can see here when it really collapsed is after sarbanes Oxley you had lower highs uh that destroyed the capital formation business in the US and the ability for smaller companies to list earlier like we had had historically hopefully Trump one could not get that done I know cudow was working on it uh

we covered last week conservatively they could generate $4 of earnings if those conservative estimates are correct about industry volumes because everything after 15.8 goes straight to the bottom line and that&#39;s why we got involved with the trade when it was below 153 because of the operating leverage in the business it&#39;s just magnificent so yield curve has uninverted and stayed uninverted

Tech and mag 7 have outperformed the average stock in December so this was just a CA change that came after the election a short-term thing we saw the exact same thing in 2016 after the election and before the inauguration no way to hedge against that short-term move you just get it all on the back end in q1 and two Q2 gains of next year if you try to hedge you you create unnecessary tax events and then if someone else gets elected uh you&#39;re completely on the wrong side twice you created tax liability and you missed the upside so you know you just have to ride it through the beauty is you all get you always get back to the expected Trend uh it&#39;s just delayed to you know in this case a couple of months and then this will catch back up huge and uh be very exciting net profit margins continue to accelerate this is from fax set via Seth golden and expect margins net profit margins go from 12 12% this year to 13% next year so that&#39;s you know expanding margins is the mother&#39;s milk I mean earnings and margins is the name of the game here&#39;s from Zack tan who has been a longtime follower and um multiple time caller uh he posted on VF Corp he says I understand the oah effect of Kim cardashian resulting in the uh The North Face and skims collaboration selling out within minutes but did you know that Vans offthe wall had two releases last week and it sold out quickly as well uh they&#39;ve collaborated with Street Wear label rooted in B bike culture so these look cool by the way I mean out here in California I&#39;m you know seven blocks from the beach we walk there all the time uh everyone wears Vans and and now I actually fit in I was like the only guy wearing my green I&#39;ve got the green stands and I got the the low comfy cush and I got the same ones in white with green so I got green all green and I got the white with green um but everyone wears these and these are super popular um I mean even the golf pro wears Vans it&#39;s mindboggling uh at the country club like every everyone out here so I&#39;m excited to go back to New York in early January for to do a few days of media to walk down Fifth Avenue and see if it&#39;s actually spreading Beyond Orange County California uh because uh it looks like it the Stock&#39;s up a lot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really moving in the right direction this is from Charlie Bello talking about new highs this is the average returns you see the bulk of them are 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 and you can get a sense of the bell curve of returns since 1928 here&#39;s Emerging Markets total returns relative to the us so you can see Emerging Markets outperformed uh in the 80s and 90s us uh outperformed in 95 to 98 and then in 2 to 2010 Emerging Markets crushed the US for a decade and then in uh then us crushed emerging markets for the next decade and I think you&#39;re going to start to see Emerging Markets crush the US once again for the next uh handful of years ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS S&P 500 waiting of the top 10 Holdings this is going all the way back and you know you saw these peaks in 1980 we know what happened next 2000 we know what happened next uh 2020 we did see the big Tech correction in 2022 I think we could see something in that line not the 1999 uh type but something maybe a little bit more mild than 2022 but definitely an underperformance and a consolidation in 2025 in my view Apple price to sales ratio this is kind of interesting as well uh Apple&#39;s trading at 10 times sales with like I I haven&#39;t even looked at it lately but probably 5% earnings growth um forget about the PE multiple relative to you know the PEG ratio ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES um so this is all multiple expansion and this is all financed by the week Yen and I could talk about this on TV and and they would give me 2 seconds because no one wants to hear about this it&#39;s too complicated but I think the most important thing you have to pay attention to in 2025 is the Japanese Yen and as you see that appreciate I as the bank of Japan tries to raise rates because they&#39;re going to be forced to from or uh you start to see the Yen going up every perent the Yen moves up I would say the mag s basket&#39;s going to move down 2% if not more because there&#39;s just so much leverage the amount that they&#39;re borrowing to buy these mag seven stocks and you&#39;re just seeing it in the multiple expansion so if you think it&#39;s like ah us exceptionalism blah blah blah yeah there there&#39;s that but tell me that continues to hold true when the carry trade unwind and I&#39;ll tell you good luck with that idea uh here&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million to a billion in the last two weeks so uh this this is not the environment where high quality businesses that are marked down outperform uh this is when people want fart coin so God bless them uh when the calendar flips good luck ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK AMC entertainment same type of thing we saw what happens when people chase that stuff it doesn&#39;t end well Peter Lynch second quote the most important organ in the body as far as the stock market is concerned is the guts not the head anyone can acquire knowhow for analyzing stocks that&#39;s from Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why you know people always ask me why do you why do you share so many of your secrets blah blah blah and I said I could I could number one I share a lot but I don&#39;t share everything number two uh I could could give 100% of the Playbook every single week and write a book step by step and at the end of the day it couldn&#39;t be replicated because of the intangible of understanding the emotions of the market and the only way you get that uh and you get the pattern recognition and you get the ice in your veins one one is it&#39;s genetic that&#39;s just period so you have to be part of this 1% of oddballs that that are just wired this way and number two uh um it&#39;s experience you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just experience and I&#39;ll be uh I&#39;ll be it&#39;s it&#39;s the only business it&#39;s like age you get better with age I mean Buffett if you look at Buffett&#39;s net worth I think his biggest gains happened between like percentage gains happened between age like 70 and 90 or something along those lines so because you it&#39;s just as money compounds knowledge compounds so so um so

the low comfy cush and I got the same ones in white with green so I got green all green and I got the white with green um but everyone wears these and these are super popular um I mean even the golf pro wears Vans it&#39;s mindboggling uh at the country club like every everyone out here so I&#39;m excited to go back to New York in early January for to do a few days of media to walk down Fifth Avenue and see if it&#39;s actually spreading Beyond Orange County California uh because uh it looks like it the Stock&#39;s up a lot I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s really moving in the right direction this is from Charlie Bello talking about new highs this is the average returns you see the bulk of them are 0 to 10 10 to 20 20 to 30 and you can get a sense of the bell curve of returns since 1928 here&#39;s Emerging Markets total returns relative to the us so you can see Emerging Markets outperformed uh in the 80s and 90s us uh outperformed in 95 to 98 and then in 2 to 2010 Emerging Markets crushed the US for a decade and then in uh then us crushed emerging markets for the next decade and I think you&#39;re going to start to see Emerging Markets crush the US once again for the next uh handful of years ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS S&P 500 waiting of the top 10 Holdings this is going all the way back and you know you saw these peaks in 1980 we know what happened next 2000 we know what happened next uh 2020 we did see the big Tech correction in 2022 I think we could see something in that line not the 1999 uh type but something maybe a little bit more mild than 2022 but definitely an underperformance and a consolidation in 2025 in my view Apple price to sales ratio this is kind of interesting as well uh Apple&#39;s trading at 10 times sales with like I I haven&#39;t even looked at it lately but probably 5% earnings growth um forget about the PE multiple relative to you know the PEG ratio ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES um so this is all multiple expansion and this is all financed by the week Yen and I could talk about this on TV and and they would give me 2 seconds because no one wants to hear about this it&#39;s too complicated but I think the most important thing you have to pay attention to in 2025 is the Japanese Yen and as you see that appreciate I as the bank of Japan tries to raise rates because they&#39;re going to be forced to from or uh you start to see the Yen going up every perent the Yen moves up I would say the mag s basket&#39;s going to move down 2% if not more because there&#39;s just so much leverage the amount that they&#39;re borrowing to buy these mag seven stocks and you&#39;re just seeing it in the multiple expansion so if you think it&#39;s like ah us exceptionalism blah blah blah yeah there there&#39;s that but tell me that continues to hold true when the carry trade unwind and I&#39;ll tell you good luck with that idea uh here&#39;s fcoin it&#39;s gone from 200 million to a billion in the last two weeks so uh this this is not the environment where high quality businesses that are marked down outperform uh this is when people want fart coin so God bless them uh when the calendar flips good luck ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK AMC entertainment same type of thing we saw what happens when people chase that stuff it doesn&#39;t end well Peter Lynch second quote the most important organ in the body as far as the stock market is concerned is the guts not the head anyone can acquire knowhow for analyzing stocks that&#39;s from Peter Lynch and that&#39;s why you know people always ask me why do you why do you share so many of your secrets blah blah blah and I said I could I could number one I share a lot but I don&#39;t share everything number two uh I could could give 100% of the Playbook every single week and write a book step by step and at the end of the day it couldn&#39;t be replicated because of the intangible of understanding the emotions of the market and the only way you get that uh and you get the pattern recognition and you get the ice in your veins one one is it&#39;s genetic that&#39;s just period so you have to be part of this 1% of oddballs that that are just wired this way and number two uh um it&#39;s experience you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just experience and I&#39;ll be uh I&#39;ll be it&#39;s it&#39;s the only business it&#39;s like age you get better with age I mean Buffett if you look at Buffett&#39;s net worth I think his biggest gains happened between like percentage gains happened between age like 70 and 90 or something along those lines so because you it&#39;s just as money compounds knowledge compounds so so um so that&#39;s that\n\nportfolio manager names Chinese and European stocks promising strong returns despite Market uncertainty he&#39;s talking about the stimulus he&#39;s talking uh first off they they did in November a 5year stimulus totaling 10 trillion Yuan 1.3 trillion us now they&#39;re doing this $400 billion uh direct stimulus for straight to Consumers China moles record $411 billion special bonds uh for money will fund consumer subsidies this will be the first consumption driven direct stimulus in the pockets ladies and gentlemen and yet people are sleep at the wheel has gotten bit a little bit in the last couple of days on that basis but nowhere near what&#39;s going to take place plan special bonds amidst vows to spend okay so Chinese plan special bonds amid vows to spend so they&#39;re getting serious this is from Brendan Ahern first support the expansion of domestic demand mainland China had a media had a significant coverage of the National Financial work conference conclusion and subsequent Ministry of Finance release stating quote more proactive fiscal policies should be implemented the positive release outlines six areas of focus for 2025 and the first one and the fact that the first one are key I&#39;m doing The Bold and underline through mof&#39;s website as they used uh bold on the first bullet a clear indication they are telling us something not to be missed here&#39;s the first bu bullet quote First support the expansion of domestic demand expanding pensions and medical insurance were included remember that China&#39;s high saving rate is driven by the lack of social safety net the goal is to vigorously the goal is to quote vigorously boost consumption vigorously boost consumption so that&#39;s that

going down in 2025 hedge funds and large Traders red line at the bottom down here uh have not been positioned this short 10year treasury since September 2018 that was right over here which preceded a major rally in bonds right here commercials the true smart money green line at the bottom right here uh are near record long they haven&#39;t been this long since September 2018 right before huge rally in in bonds compression in yields commercials are always early and mostly right we can debate the reasons why bonds will get bid from positive to negative fiscal responsibility Doge okay uh flight to safety geopolitical uncertainty less issuance due to higher tax receipts these are just guesses positioning tells me a lot more than predicting the quote Best Catalyst someone of course with no skin in the game reached out to me saying quote CCI is down because they&#39;re only getting 8 billion for the fiber business end quote this is utter nonsense disposing the money losing fiber business will leave behind a cash flow machine that requires little maintenance with lower cap X spend moving forward they should pay someone to take it off their hands never mind get 8 billion that&#39;s whipped cream CCI is down because every read is down every read is down because bonds are temporarily down just like they were after Trump got elected in 2016 just like they got bid in 2017 every read is temporarily down end of story here&#39;s this daily CCI with TLT overlay effectively the exact same chart the blue line is TLT the red and black is uh CCI nothing to do with fiber disposition it&#39;s been doing the exact same damn thing before the new thing was announced in case we haven&#39;t mentioned it enough in the last few weeks the same thing happened after president Trump was elected in November 2016 bonds and REITs and CCI sold off after the inauguration in January 2017 they all rallied sell the rumor bu the news election crash inauguration rally straight up almost uh 70% move in less than a year after the inauguration here&#39;s the 2016 to 2017 Cal calendar flip with CCI and bonds TLT and blue before and after the inauguration straight up ladies and gentlemen sold after the election bought after the inauguration as a relevant side note we want to congrat congratulate all the new clients who joined us during 2024 we also want to Express gratitude and congratulate the existing clients who have been with us for a while you could not be better positioned for what is about to take place in coming weeks and months before and after the inauguration we&#39;ve been hard at work getting you ready for what it what is about to happen those of you who watch the last few weeks podcast video cast have a sample idea of what I&#39;m referring to a sample idea in light of this imminent Outlook we will be reopening to smaller accounts the $1 million plus accounts for q1 a few days earlier than normal due to the rare conditions now in place to put money to work very attractively existing clients know we have been busy at work taking advantage over the past week due to demand from longtime listeners of the podcast who understand what is setting up per our recent podcast video cast as well as new referrals that we&#39;ve received we&#39;ve already begun Fielding in for new clients this week and sending them out the paperwork we are doing this so that those who are a mutual fit can begin deploying Capital as early as January 2nd after their applications are approved you may enter in your info here uh uh this is a hyperlink where you enter your contact information on hedgefund tips.com again all of this is opinion not advice uh all this check with your financial advis not a solicitation etc etc uh do what&#39;s in you you feel is in your interest uh but when you enter that information you&#39;ll be able to be among the first callbacks we will close this opening for q1 well before the inauguration on January 20th uh as we expect to be fully positioned across the board well beforehand um probably a lot well beforehand so those that I&#39;m talking to this week are going to be uh in good shape larger $5 to10 million accounts can access open enrollment here and back to CCI so look the reason I start with the long-term chart is you can see crown castle is a story of Corrections followed by recoveries Corrections followed up by recoveries early 2000s uh 2008 2009 etc etc etc this time will be no different and you can see the um revenues per share continue to climb the cash flow per share funds from operations Steady As She Goes The Last Five Years slow recovery earnings same type of things so there was a little dip after covid it will recover you&#39;re going to get rid of some of that burn from the fiber business now that they&#39;re dumping it they&#39;ll pay down some debt bring down interest costs uh here are 10 key points from the earnings call The Organic Revenue growth of 5.2% uh Tower segment growth of 4.3% 25% growth in small Sal segment maintain the full year outlook for adjusted e eida and affo wireless data usage surpassed 100 trillion megabytes uh in last year so the demand continues to grow uh supporting their optimistic view on future growth uh expected Consolidated organic Revenue growth of approximately 5% for 2024 including 4.5% towers and 10% in small cells plans to add 11 to 13,000 new small cell nodes in 2024 uh indicating continued expansion strong financial position with company raising 1.25 billion in long-term debt reducing leverage to 5.5 times net debt to eidon now they&#39;re getting another $8 billion from the sale of the fiber money losing fiber business uh strategic cancellation of 7,000 low yielding nodes expected to save approximately $800 million in future cap X ongoing digitization of the tower portfolio to enhance marketable space visibility and improve customer service efficiency so um so they&#39;re talking about the sale of 18 billion 8 billion they&#39;ve blown $19 billion of capital over the years into this stupid money losing business so they&#39;re now cutting their losses and getting on with it um and now they can return to operating their highquality Tower portfolio and return greater amounts of shares to cashh Holders Buy in float reduce the debt uh many investors have long pushed for Crown to dispose of the fiber assets namely Elliot management\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n Carl Z metatech Leading Edge technology and iare mother company uh super interesting stuff asml wouldn&#39;t be able to produce their machines without them okay so this is called Carl Ze okay stocks down with cash flow revenues have been flat the last two years margins are declining stock&#39;s down 80% 75% this looks like a broken momentum stock um let&#39;s see here balance sheet I can&#39;t be right 22 million how much debt 400 I got $20 million of cash according to this you got better double check this and uh $445 million of debt no bueno uh this is toast if they don&#39;t do something they&#39;ll do something something but uh $178 million of free cash flow all right you&#39;re going to have to just figure out when all their debt comes due how much it is to service it a percentage of free cash flow I I mean this is a solvency thing I don&#39;t love it to be honest with you this one I don&#39;t love it I think it it goes lower and by the way even if it bounces chances are you know bounces up to 80 you&#39;ll have another chance to buy it at 60 once it&#39;s stabilized and the fundamentals are better so I wouldn&#39;t I wouldn&#39;t rush into this I I like your analysis and how you got there I&#39;m just not in a in a rush uh some very cheap automakers Mazda 7261 could you look at the stock I don&#39;t buy oems I think they&#39;re just garbage businesses um they&#39;re going to be a race to the bottom in margins Cooper standards going to benefit I want picks and shovels let all the gold prospectors go broke we&#39;ll sell them the shovels and that&#39;s basically what these Mazda and uh Honda and um or Nissan and Etc so yeah it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s cheap for a reason because labor Parts uh race to the bottom uh not interested Ford&#39;s been cheap for 25 years U Max M toall asking about gxo no change in gxo just going to take a couple years basically an oligopoly they&#39;ll roll up all the uh smaller businesses the next Catalyst here is  a new CEO they announced two things at once one the CEO is retiring two No Deal why people wanted to deal is beyond me this is a great business let&#39;s just look at the numbers one more time for fun maybe we&#39;ll do this one maybe I shouldn&#39;t do it and maybe we&#39;ll do it next week but um bottom line is the stocks falling much much more than the free cash flow revenues continue to grow working off all the excess uh Warehouse capacity in the industry uh this thing is fine so we&#39;re we&#39;re very comfortable being in the market on this one I&#39;ll leave it at that and uh that&#39;s it so we&#39;ll be back next time",

attractive sell Crown&#39;s Tower business is 68% of 2023 Revenue it&#39;s fantastic 40,000 Towers minimal capital investment to drive growing cash uh this business entails Wireless carriers leasing space on the towers to install antennas and other communication equipment to power their networks organic Revenue growth is driven by a fixed annual escalator of roughly 3 % in addition to carriers adding new equipment to incremental or existing Towers which they do to improve or maintain their Network cost associated with operating the towers are largely fixed leading to meaningful operating leverage we love operating leverage guys that is a theme across most of our portfolio and driving profitability on new Revenue growth barriers belief carriers will need to continue expanding infrastructured be necessary part of larger Communications Network um so they had said that they were skeptical about the firm&#39;s ability to earn sufficient Returns on its fiber investment well now that&#39;s no longer a problem um fiber is a noote business they&#39;re getting rid of it they were just struggling to earn their weighted Lo uh weighted at cost of capital that&#39;s now gone they&#39;re going just going to be focused predominantly on the Legacy Tower business and the economics are pretty amazing cost 200 to 300,000 to construct it Tower um and the name of the game is having multiple tenants on each Tower which gives you huge return so for instance American Tower states that the average Tower is 275,000 to construct generates 20,000 of annual revenue for the first tenant with 12,000 of annual operating expenses generating a poor return on investment of only 3% yet when adding a second and third tenant these returns jump to 133% and 20 4% as annual revenue scales to 50,000 and 80,000 so net uh 68,000 on a 275 that&#39;s a great return on invested Capital uh as operating expenses only increase marginally the crown castle has a tency rational ratio of 2.5 tenants per Tower as of 2023 with an average annual revenue per tenant of nearly 38,000 so you&#39;re looking at70 6 plus uh 19 so 95,000 on a 250 to 275,000 investor uh investment back out operating uh or or management cost of 12,000 that is a sick return on invested Capital that&#39;s now going to be their primary business and the the um uh the fiber business is no longer going to suck up all those profits which is a name which is huge this is going to be a literal C cash machine and then you talk about the moat of the the regular Towers the switching costs are high because they can disrupt their service which would uh crush them and that&#39;s why you see Crown Castle&#39;s churn has averaged only 1.5% annually since 2019 so you see some of these notes um site rental revenues went up in Q3 adjusted eido went up affo went up and you can see it by segment Market we&#39;re at a period of fear fear and greed is at 30% now we&#39;re coming possibly to that zag breath thrust uh

find rum the pro the overlap the key is you know the beauty of for my clients is that I have effectively zero correlation to the S&P 500 because we buy individual businesses most managers you hire they&#39;re just closet indexers and they charge you a lot to mimic what you could get in an index fund and what happens when you&#39;re buying uncorrelated businesses to the SCP number one you&#39;re diversifying your exposure but number two the returns are so lumpy like you you go sideways to slightly up for a while and then you just have these years where it&#39;s off the chart ridiculous unbelievable outcomes that no one can even blow blows their mind away and then the first call in January is congratulations don&#39;t expect the same thing again take expectations down and work day

lowest level in 25 years except what happened when the risk premium got this low what people are missing about this Equity risk premium is it's it's a function of the valuations of the top seven stocks so the last time you had Equity risk premium this this low was the last time that you saw dramatic outperformance of value small caps in Emerging Markets uh and the concentrated stocks like the cisos of the world get smoked which you can see here from 2001 to 2003 and that's when the quote unquote 493 equivalent back then just took off like nobody's business small caps took off like nobody's business Emerging Markets took off like nobody's business so everything points back to 2021 2022 in case we haven't mentioned that enough in the last 6 weeks it's been a historically bad few weeks for Value versus growth again you get that type of thing in 2001 uh and you got a bit of it in 2020 which was an unbelievable year   property prices are climbing again Apartments commercial property offices not so much commercial real estate Finance rebounds so uh those properties are starting to get financed that was part of that ver vernado thesis which which uh hit our fair value much quicker than expected   IPOs is magnificent 7 AM Mania so again I'm not calling for anything I'm just trying to represent cognizance for you guys to think about   the Magnificent 7 is way more extreme than the NASDAQ 100 bubble of the late 90s and the Nik bubble of the late 80s and the gold bubble of the 70s and the nifty50 of the late 60s before the 73 crash   Japan CPI this is what I was referring to their inflation is going up they will have to hike and all the mag s is right now is a levered uh carry trade that's where all the carry they borrow at zero and they invested in US risk assets and they benefit from the appreciation of the dollar relative to the Yen and they benefit from the free money it's a riskless trade until it becomes what do they say risk-free return until you get return free risk and that shifts quicker than you know and everyone gets a margin call on the same day and they you got a preview of coming attractions in early August it's just people forgot and they went right back to doing the exact same thing so   China May set the highest budget deficit in decades 4% of GDP everyone's still bearish   this is Larry Williams via Seth golden General Road maack for 2025 this guy's pretty good   his timing Cycles have worked really well over the last four years I always pay attention to him he's gotten a lot of stuff also wrong over the years which we all   make mistakes that's part of the game but   he's right more often than he's wrong and that's the name of the game as well   so he's pointing to continued weakness into February and then a rally into March and April we'll see I mean my general base case is that we should be strong into the inauguration a lot of new stuff will start to work into the inauguration and then the old stuff I think you you are going to see some profit taking in the mag 7   Euro areas GDP seen growing less strongly  if you had put $1 in stocks in 1801   your average return would have been about 7% a year compounded and that turned into 2.3 million $1 into 2.3 million unbelievable bonds $1 became 2,100 so same dollar do you want 2,100 or do you want 2.3 million it's not even close T bills that's why you want an equity manager not a bond manager t- bills   $1 became $245 gold gold guys you can't people can't get enough gold right now right everyone wants gold we've been saying good luck with that $1 became $4 so if you buy gold now in 220 years you will have six if you buy $4 worth of gold you'll have $16 worth in2 200 20 years so   have at it if that's interesting to you and the dollar has been the worst performing investment so if you're sitting with dollars in the bank account and not invested in equities you are losing like nobody's business so    this is from a guy named Grant hawkridge a lot of talk about the breath thrust and it looks like it's going to be happening here has crossed the 10day count begins will Santa bring a breath thrust with him so   when breath quickly recovers from
