  "cleaned_transcript": "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWelcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 286th video cast podcast for the week ending, April 10th, 2025.\n\nThis uh was meant for the pod charts, but want to cover it. This is from Ken Fiser, kind of drawing analoges to the 1998 kind of uh abrupt correction, bounceback, retest, and then recover. We&#39;re going to cover a number of different analoges in this week&#39;s podcast to get a sense of when we can expect to recover and then work out to new highs. I mean, that&#39;s really the name of the game. Uh\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nBBC had me on the fly uh after Trump tweeted um that he was going to pause the tariffs. So, I want to thank Marian Mosheri and Janie Wall for for thinking of me and having me on. We&#39;re going to listen in here in Delmore there. Well, let&#39;s cross live to New York again and this time speak to Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital. Thomas, it&#39;s so good to talk to you. Um, I I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re seeing what the markets are doing. You&#39;ve seen what President Trump has said. Give me your reaction. Well, this is an absolute gamecher, Miriam. And you know there had been a lot of fear in the market the last few days. People were comparing this to the great financial crisis to the tech wreck. And the difference between this and those two crises that took years to work out was this was man-made. So it could be fixed in a day. And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re seeing today. And the beauty of President Trump&#39;s strategy and what he&#39;s done throughout his years is he escalates in order to deescalate. So now we we had a big ask and now we&#39;re down to 10%. The 10% across the board looks like nothing and everyone is relieved and in effect that is a big accomplishment in and goes a long way to balancing trade and and people now look at that as a very very low bar. So they&#39;ll negotiate over the next 90 days. The key that the markets love is there&#39;s some rationality in the room. People people generally believe the concept makes sense. Maybe they weren&#39;t in accordance with the execution. Uh, however, now we have have the relief valve and when it rains gold, pull out the bucket, not the thimble. There are things to buy. Yes, absolutely. Thomas, tell me this though. You know, some people are saying that this is America blinking. We&#39;ve heard in the last hour or so from the Treasury Secretary, uh, Mr. Bessant, who said this was his strategy all along. you kind of feel to me like you&#39;re saying possibly this is what the states the America wanted from the outset but even if this is an amazing clever ploy to get that 10% running along all those countries surely the markets don&#39;t like this level of kind of you know going up going down pushing pulling not knowing where you stand that can&#39;t be good for anyone or anything on the out there yeah I&#39;ve had more fun weeks in my investing career I can tell you that right now but I can say One thing, it shows a level of good faith. We&#39;ve got a win that we&#39;re getting some imbalances fixed. The negotiations will probably go on longer than 90 days and hopefully at some point we&#39;ll get get them on the phone uh between the US and China and start to chip away at some level of balance and then the market can go back to focusing on what? Focusing on earnings, focusing on cash flow, focusing on growth, focusing on employment and all those things have been pretty good. uh people were just starting to extrapolate if we stayed in this frozen period for too long would it put us into a recession and now that we&#39;ve unfrozen it and we&#39;re going back to good faith negotiations I think the market likes it and now companies can start to make decisions again we just had some reaction from the uh future German chancellor German chancellor designignate Mertz who said Europeans are united on defending ourselves and this shows that approach works best everyone&#39;s going to be claiming victory tonight aren&#39;t they well that&#39;s the whole thing. If everyone can save face and you know a great deal is when no one is perfectly happy and everyone saves face. And if that&#39;s the case today, then today is a celebration. Let&#39;s get back to business. Let&#39;s get back to trade. If there&#39;s some imbalances that are going to be normalized over the next 90 days, let&#39;s get that done and let&#39;s focus on growing and prosperity. But what about the 125% tariffs on China?\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthat we&#39;re getting some imbalances fixed. The negotiations will probably go on longer than 90 days and hopefully at some point we&#39;ll get get them on the phone uh between the US and China and start to chip away at some level of balance and then the market can go back to focusing on what?

That&#39;s kind of a fly in your ointment there. And you know, China has backed itself into a corner, Thomas, right? How does it get out? Well, t\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  that. But I think at some point cooler heads will prevail prevail. The signal is that if you&#39;re willing to come to the table, we have a rational administration that is willing to talk and there will be some way for both sides to save face and begin a dialogue. Will it be tonight? Probably not. Will it be a week from now? We don&#39;t know. But I would assume within the next couple of weeks, three, four weeks, uh the t the dialogue will begin and no one will be happy with the ultimate outcome. They&#39;ll meet somewhere in the middle and things will progress as planned. Okay. Well, Thomas, it&#39;s great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak to us on BBC News. Thank you so much. Well, let&#39;s talk a little bit more now about that 125% announcement on tariffs on China. Let&#39;s speak to Scott Kennedy, trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Scott, good to talk to you. Um, I know that we&#39;ve only just heard this news of this 125% tariff on Chinese goods, but you know, the numbers are pretty much just numbers. There&#39;s a direction of travel here that we&#39;re seeing. How worried are you about that? Well, the numbers have already gotten so high. Uh, it really doesn&#39;t matter if they go up anymore. uh US China bilateral trade and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to join Stu Vney also on the fly uh this week on Friday in the midst of the chaos want to thank as always Christian Dagger and Stuart Vanney will listen in here repeating this Trump said on Truth Social quote just had a very productive call with the general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam who told me that Vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they&#39;re able to make an agreement with the US. I thanked him on behalf of our country and I said I look forward to a meeting in the near future. End quote. I&#39;d call that a positive. President Trump also commented on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump says quote this would be a perfect time for the Fed chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. He&#39;s always late, but he could now change his image and quickly. Energy prices are down, interest rates are down, inflation is down, even eggs are down 69% and jobs are up all within two months. A big win for America. Cut interest rates, Jerome. And stop playing politics. Okay, perfect time to bring in Tom Hayes. He joins us on the phone. If Powell did cut rates and the f the Fed funds futures market thinks we&#39;re going to get five rate cuts this year, would that help the market? There&#39;s no question about it. He could put a floor in the market today if he wanted to. And Donald Trump is absolutely right. You know, the stock market is holding a buy one get one free sale today and everyone&#39;s running out of the store. Capitulation is in the air, Steu. And I think selective buying is in order. So we got You&#39;d like to see Powell cut rates today. And if he did, you think we&#39;d be off to the races? Yeah, he put a floor in 100%. He&#39;s not going to do it today. But if he can change his tone and say we are aware of what&#39;s happening as it relates to policy and we stand ready to act, that is the message he needs to give to the market. If he wants to be a vulker-like figure in the world and be remembered, he needs to step up right now and stand in and say, &quot;We&#39;re standing behind the United States. We&#39;re standing behind the policy. We stand ready to act.&quot; Donald Trump is 100% right on this. We&#39;ve been on this program. We&#39;ve been looking at all the different sectors of the market. Almost all of them are down. It&#39;s pretty much across the board. But do you have a particular sector that you think would be a good place to put some money right now? Yes. The silver lining of this is interest rates are coming down. The 10-year yield below 4%. I had a friend who got a 7-year adjustable rate mortgage yesterday at 5.1%. T\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\ne Powell.

I had a friend who got a 7-year adjustable rate mortgage yesterday at 5.1%. There is  a huge amount of pent up demand from 80 million millennials aged 34 35 years old. As mortgage rates, the 30-year fix comes below six. It is going to be a frenzy out there. Donald Trump is opening up. We&#39;ve got 500 million acres of federal land. They&#39;re going to start building homes. PY will provide your starter home and you get an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge. The game is on. So, here&#39;s what what we&#39;re looking at. Brad Jacobs is a money maker for shareholders. He&#39;s got a a building supply rollup called QXO. QXO just bought Beacon Roofing. This guy is a money maker. He did XBO Logistics. If you put in a million dollars with him in 2009, it&#39;s $160 million last year, 160 Bagger. If you did a million dollars with him in United Rentals, URI, in 1997 when he got involved, it&#39;s worth 89 million today. He&#39;s a money maker. And this is this is one of the few times you can get in on the ground floor with Brad Jacobs with QXO is getting I got I got to go but QXO I shall remember that and it is down 3% today but we&#39;ll listen to you Tom Hayes.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nBrad Jacobs is a money maker for shareholders.

We went position by position and not just talking charts and uh uh cursory fundamentals but actually digging into the fundamentals of each business balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and so many of you saw the opportunity to reup and add into the weakness. So, I want to acknowledge um the one so far and obviously you can see there&#39;s going to be opportunity here uh uh to add, but um most of you have already taken advantage. Awesome job, Frank, Jim, Joe, of course, Brad, Marlin, uh, and then new people that have come in for our Q2 2025 opening taking advantage of this opportunity of a lifetime, which is really what it&#39;s created, this man-made uh, situation, which we&#39;re going to get into.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI&#39;ll be on Fox Business tomorrow morning on Varnian Co. at 9:45 a.m. And this is one of the few correction environments that I&#39;ve ever seen where retail investors uh are more confident meaning in the market taking advantage of the opportunities and professionals are scared out of their pants. And um I&#39;m seeing it across the board. The professionals hedge funds are record selling in the hole after the crash. Uh retail investors are actually starting to buy pretty aggressively. And here&#39;s the news, ladies and gentlemen. Uh retail investors have mostly been right since co obviously the ones chasing shiny objects got smoked uh in 2001. The ones chasing shiny objects etc. But the ones that have been buying the dips, high quality stuff for the long term have really really done well. and it&#39;s reflected in the numbers uh in um uh in the numbers uh since COVID. So, kudos for those of you taking advantage on the buy 1 get one free sales rather than running out of the store, actually running into the store. And I know it hasn&#39;t been easy. I&#39;ve had more fun weeks in my career. That&#39;s for sure. But you also have to recognize that, you know, it&#39;s cliche in a way, but when it rains gold, you got to pull out the bucket, not the thimble. Uh it&#39;s not willy-nilly. And I, you know, my clients had really an incredible opportunity to see that on Monday and Tuesday. It&#39;s not like, oh, the market&#39;s down, let&#39;s just buy. It&#39;s dissecting each individual business and what will be the impact of tariffs. And in most of the cases with the businesses uh as you dug into the fi fundamentals and how they&#39;ve positioned themselves through deleveraging through free free cash flow through um all the things that they&#39;ve set up even if it got really bad what winds up is they wind up coming out of this situation with more share not less share. So that is going to be a major factor moving forward and we&#39;re going to talk about that today.\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUh this is interesting because today there was a level of dis despondency that um we have not seen in a long time. And I thought it was kind of interesting because yesterday everyone was excited. And I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on charts and that type of thing, but when you see fundamentals completely thrown out of the window and no longer having any bearing, you have to go a little bit to the technicals and that just comes from experience. And uh I sent this to a friend who was having a little bit of a tough time, smart guy, and uh he&#39;s he always winds up on the right side uh of everything. But when he sent when I sent this to him, I said, &quot;Look, I don&#39;t do a lot of technical analysis, so don&#39;t go sending this around that Tom Hayes is now looking at charts for his uh uh key uh you know, moves to to move ahead.&quot; But, you know, last time I checked, this looked like a pretty solid double bottom. Um, this is on only on a 60-minute chart, so you know, time will tell. But, you know, that was Friday and then you got the rally up and then you got the wipe out and then\n\nwhen it rains gold, you got to pull out the bucket, not the thimble. It&#39;s not like, oh, the market&#39;s down, let&#39;s just buy. It&#39;s dissecting each individual business and what will be the impact of tariffs. And in most of the cases with the businesses uh as you dug into the fi fundamentals and how they&#39;ve positioned themselves through deleveraging through free free cash flow through um all the things that they&#39;ve set up even if it got really bad what winds up is they wind up coming out of this situation with more share not less share. So that is going to be a major factor moving forward and we&#39;re going to talk about that today. Uh this is interesting because today there was a level of dis despondency that um we have not seen in a long time. And I thought it was kind of interesting because yesterday everyone was excited. And I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on charts and that type of thing, but when you see fundamentals completely thrown out of the window and no longer having any bearing, you have to go a little bit to the technicals and that just comes from experience. And uh I sent this to a friend who was having a little bit of a tough time, smart guy, and uh he&#39;s he always winds up on the right side uh of everything. But when he sent when I sent this to him, I said, &quot;Look, I don&#39;t do a lot of technical analysis, so don&#39;t go sending this around that Tom Hayes is now looking at charts for his uh uh key uh you know, moves to to move ahead.&quot; But, you know, last time I checked, this looked like a pretty solid double bottom. Um, this is on only on a 60-minute chart, so you know, time will tell. But, you know, that was Friday and then you got the rally up and then you got the wipe out and then finally  you got the huge rally yesterday when Trump said this is a good time to buy stocks. We&#39;re going to pause the tariffs and then today you gave a little back. That should be expected. Why? Because you had a lot of people that had to buy quickly or cover quickly and then you just test them out, make sure they&#39;re serious. And we my sense is we would work higher, but I&#39;m going to go through some some different things at this point. You know, we&#39;re less concerned about the indices generally than we are about the businesses that we own. Here&#39;s on a daily basis. This gives you an idea. So, you did cover all of these lows, take these out. This kind of held up. Little bit of indecision today. I could see some consolidation for a while, maybe staying within this candle here, and then we work up over time. um you know these are even on the weekly could it you know we discussed last week could it push down to 450 it could I think we saw where the Trump put is certainly as it relates to the bond market I think that also has to do with equities and then as if you uh step back and you see these type of situations after big draw downs like 2022 you rally and then you get these checkbacks here uh like we&#39;re seeing now like you saw in 2004 for like you saw in 2011. And speaking of 2011, we are going to discuss that. What you can see here in 2011 is it looks like you know a month or two, this is a monthly chart of of some uh consolidation and then you just rallied and and continued the trend. Uh that was actually three full months of consolidation. So we&#39;re going to look at that as a possible analog as well. Uh but the key is once the primary pain was in in the short term even though you bounced around for two and a half months uh you didn&#39;t really make you made marginal new lows but but over time you know if you if you blinked went on vacation four months later the market was recovered six months later you were at new highs and off to the races. So you know when I say and we went into it whether you buy Boeing at 130 or 150 it&#39;s not going to make a difference in the long term when it&#39;s a $300 stock. Uh, everyone likes to get the perfect bottom and the perfect top. It&#39;s just uh not perfectly realistic. So, what do you do? You buy a little more on red days. You you uh and then when it gets extremely overvalued, you take it off in tanches and and uh same thing over and over. So, this was 2011. And the reason I bring this one up, I&#39;m going to see if I can run these side by side just so you can get an idea here. Okay, I can. What do you know? All right. So, if you look here, this is 2011 and this is 2025. Um, so you had some real strength from the recent lows about a year earlier and then you kind of had this warning shot in July and then you rallied into August and then it was just a complete fall off the cliff uh in late July through early August and you basically put in the lows. You had this violent move up, then a back test back to uh that level. Then a V rally up, then a marginal new lows in October and then straight back up uh which would be you know back over the 200 day which would be back to 5,800 on the S&P. Uh and then you chopped around and then\n\nlike you saw in 2004 for like you saw in 2011. And speaking of 2011, we are going to discuss that. What you can see here in 2011 is it looks like you know a month or two, this is a monthly chart of of some uh consolidation and then you just rallied and and continued the trend. Uh that was actually three full months of consolidation. So we&#39;re going to look at that as a possible analog as well. Uh but the key is once the primary pain was in in the short term even though you bounced around for two and a half months uh you didn&#39;t really make you made marginal new lows but but over time you know if you if you blinked went on vacation four months later the market was recovered six months later you were at new highs and off to the races. So you know when I say and we went into it whether you buy Boeing at 130 or 150 it&#39;s not going to make a difference in the long term when it&#39;s a $300 stock. Uh, everyone likes to get the perfect bottom and the perfect top. It&#39;s just uh not perfectly realistic. So, what do you do? You buy a little more on red days. You you uh and then when it gets extremely overvalued, you take it off in tanches and and uh same thing over and over. So, this was 2011. And the reason I bring this one up, I&#39;m going to see if I can run these side by side just so you can get an idea here. Okay, I can. What do you know? All right. So, if you look here, this is 2011 and this is 2025. Um, so you had some real strength from the recent lows about a year earlier and then you kind of had this warning shot in July and then you rallied into August and then it was just a complete fall off the cliff uh in late July through early August and you basically put in the lows. You had this violent move up, then a back test back to uh that level. Then a V rally up, then a marginal new lows in October and then straight back up uh which would be you know back over the 200 day which would be back to 5,800 on the S&amp;P. Uh and then you chopped around and then finally  you broke out to new highs and beyond. uh which was basically you know August so 84 by January so five months after the crash 5 months after the crash you were at new highs again so I think you had a similar situation in 2010 by the way this was the European debt crisis uh you just basically chopped around like crazy until Mario Draghi stepped in and said, uh, we&#39;ll do whatever it takes to quiet the bond vigilantes. And and it&#39;s it&#39;s similar. You know, you&#39;re seeing yields move out a little bit this week. Uh, there&#39;s something called the basis trade, which we&#39;ll touch on, unwinding. It&#39;s just a uh a complicated way to explain hedge funds taking stupid amounts of leverage all at once in a very crowded trade for basically picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. And this week, they got steamrolled. So, they&#39;re all getting margin calls. Many funds are liquidating and blowing up because they run on leverage uh and um betting on quote unquote sure bets that when they blow up, they blow up for everyone. So, that&#39;s what this is and that&#39;s what the European debt crisis was all about in 2011. So, while it&#39;s perfectly sensible that we could rally immediately, if what here&#39;s what you don&#39;t want to do, ladies and gentlemen, okay, so let&#39;s say you put in money here because the market went up like this week. Okay, you had your crash, you had your violent rally, you had your um uh massive breath in one day and then you buy here and then it goes up a little more and you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I was really smart. I bought right at the bottom and then it goes back down and tests and then it goes back above the recent high and then it goes down and test and now it looks like you&#39;re making higher highs and higher lows and all the technicians are like the bottom is in. We&#39;re making we&#39;re in an uptrend. we&#39;re making higher highs and higher lows, which is load of And uh and then you get this high. You&#39;re like, &quot;Here we go. We&#39;re going to quote unquote break out.&quot; And then you make marginal lows. You not only retest, you know, in this case would be 481. In that case was 850, but you break down. And that&#39;s when everyone says, &quot;Oh my god, we&#39;re going back to the great financial crisis lows. The Europe Euro Union is going to break apart.&quot; And then boom, take them all out. Marginal low straight up back over. another test to scare the be Jesus out of everyone and then off to new highs and all of this noise is happening in five months which in the scheme of things is a blink of the eye and um but in the real terms look this last week felt like an eternity you know for for a prof you know I said to someone I said this is an absolute walk in the park okay at some point whether it&#39;s tomorrow or three months from now and we went through this with clients on Monday and Tuesday, you&#39;re going to wake up and there&#39;s going to be a phone call and there&#39;s going to, excuse me, there&#39;s going to be a truth and it&#39;s going to say, &quot;I just got off the phone with my friend Xi Jinping. We had a good conversation. They&#39;re desperate for a deal. We&#39;re making progress. He&#39;s coming to Mara Lago or whatever.&quot; And that day, the market&#39;s going to be up 2 3,000 points on the Dow just like we saw on um Wednesday. Okay? So, you can&#39;t be too cute. If you can buy businesses like Boeing around $150 here, it doesn&#39;t matter when you think three years out and the market&#39;s back at new highs and Boeing&#39;s at $250 uh or Disney at $85 when it&#39;s at $150, not five months from now, but you know, 12 months from now, uh is certainly realistic. So, you just you can&#39;t be too cute. And and the best thing you can do is when you&#39;re at lows like this is put whatever money you plan on putting to work, put it to work, and then just go away and forget about it for six months. When you wake up, the market will be recovered. It&#39;ll be back towards new highs and we&#39;ll be And in this case, it&#39;s kind of interesting because I hate to even compare it. What I&#39;m trying to do is set you up for the worst case scenario. Plan for the worst and expect the best because the 2011 European debt crisis and the great financial crisis and the tech wreck were a function of years of excess buildup. Okay, the tech wreck was you know five, six, seven years. So it took three, four years to work through. The European debt crisis was decades of excess debt buildup and it took years to work uh you know time to work through. Um the great financial crisis, years of excess buildup. We don&#39;t really have that right now. You could say well it&#39;s been years of an unfair deal since World War II because we allowed them to tariff us more in an effort to rebuild the world after World War II. Well, news flash, the world has been rebuilt for 50 plus years. Okay, it only took a couple of decades after World War II to do that. So why do we still have an unfair uh generous setup? So there&#39;s a movement to normalize that whether through currency, whether through tariffs, it&#39;s fundamentally the same thing, which is why the Chinese devalued the yuan immediately uh prior to the tariffs to offset the impact of some of them. Uh unfortunately, they couldn&#39;t devalue their currency 145%. So, uh, so that the idea is to bring them to the table. Um, so I think this is kind of the worstc case scenario where you bumble around August, September, you know, two full months finding a bottom up, everyone&#39;s excited, back down to the lows, everyone&#39;s despondent, up, everyone&#39;s excited, back down to the lows. I think most of the pain is in even if you marginally retest. Most people are trained that you will get a retest, which is why I&#39;m staying open-minded for the possibility that t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd in this case, it&#39;s kind of interesting because I hate to even compare it. What I&#39;m trying to do is set you up for the worst case scenario. Plan for the worst and expect the best because the 2011 European debt crisis and the great financial crisis and the tech wreck were a function of years of excess buildup. Okay, the tech wreck was you know five, six, seven years. So it took three, four years to work through. The European debt crisis was decades of excess debt buildup and it took years to work uh you know time to work through. Um the great financial crisis, years of excess buildup. We don&#39;t really have that right now.\n\nno retest. And we wake up sooner rather than later with many deals starting to hit the tape. And once we see many deals starting to hit the tape, whether it&#39;s days, weeks, or months, they got 75 people to talk to. Obviously, China&#39;s the most important one. if they start dialogue with China, we go up huge and we go up very very fast. Which is why those of you who are in were really smart to jump in this week. Couples couple of you um stragglers will come in by Saturday. And some of you that want to add money to your accounts, you want to want to be doing that. Um you&#39;re not going to get many opportunities in a career to to buy the businesses we&#39;re buying at the prices we&#39;re buying it. Um so so that&#39;s that. Um so this in my view is the worst case scenario to mentally prepare yourself which is not really a big deal. It just three you know two three months longer to get to recovery and then to new highs which in the scheme of things is nothing. And be open-minded to this could could whiplash really really fast and and rebound quicker than everyone anyone expects. That would be the best case scenario what everyone&#39;s looking for. uh worst case scenario is something like that. But either in the scheme of things, when you look back in 12 months, if you pounced when everyone else was in fear, you are going to pat yourself on the back and you&#39;re going to be so proud of yourself. So again, look, all this is opinion, not advice. All you can do is play probabilities in this business. There&#39;s no guarantees of anything. But I will guarantee you one thing. If you buy great businesses at good prices, good things happen over the long term. So um that that&#39;s really how you how you do it. Um uh so let&#39;s go through some indicators just to give you another sense of whether it&#39;s going to take three months or if it&#39;s going to take three days. Again, no one knows. But some of the indicators can give us wash out looks like the equity put call ratio 10day moving average. Uh NYSC 10% volume index. So look, a lot of these are washed and um NASDAQ uh declining issues kind of peaking here. uh NASDAQ Cohen high low index you know these are times if you bought you made money doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s guaranteed to be that way prospectively but your odds are favored real estate completely oversold stocks above the uh 200 day emerging market exponential moving average material stocks same thing washed out uh healthc care stocks washed out so you&#39;re seeing it uh small S&amp;P midcap intermediate term volume momentum oscillator. You know, they&#39;re all pointing to you&#39;re closer to the bottom than you you&#39;re much closer to the bottom than you are to the top. PM model by all washed out again by DJ J Dow Jones washed out again by S&amp;P 500. You know, percentage of S&amp;P stocks on a PMO crossover, which is just basically a 5200 day moving average crossover. uh at five now it&#39;s it&#39;s from 4% to 10%. You know if you buy on these 5% these are highly correlated with big big- time bottoms going all the way back you know 10 plus years. So could this time be different? Yeah. But I I you know, we bought a lot of stock because we had a lot of new clients come in, a lot of existing clients re up on Monday and Tuesday. Um, and if it, you know, if we did that worst case scenario where we&#39;re bouncing around with high volatility on every single deal headline for the next three months, I wouldn&#39;t trade that. I I would rather deal with that volatility and get in at the prices that we did than miss it thinking I was gonna bottom tick the exact perfect bottom and risk waking up to a truth or a tweet that says I just got off the phone with Xi Jinping and you missed the the whole entire opportunity of a lifetime. So, um, you know, I was pretty, you know, it&#39;s funny. I was on that call and I said, I&#39;ve never asked anyone to invest with me ever. Uh, I&#39;ve never done a presentation like, &quot;This is great Hill Capital. This is why you should invest, blah, blah, blah.&quot; I&#39;ve never even reached out to clients and said, &quot;Now&#39;s the time to add a lot of money.&quot; Uh, Monday and Tuesday were really, really the first two times when I said, &quot;This would be a good time.&quot; If you if you had been thinking about adding and you had dry powder, this was the time to go. And this still is this week. And maybe next maybe next week will be better. I don&#39;t I I really don&#39;t think so. Maybe on a company by company basis, but I think most of the pain is in whether we retest or not or just undercut a little bit. We&#39;ve done a lot of undercuts here. So I I feel like that game is up. But you can&#39;t know because what&#39;s happening now is not a function of normal economic conditions or excess is working through where you could handicap it. It&#39;s a question of game theory of who&#39;s going to pick up the phone first and is the deal going to be good and is it going to be bad and does it take one day to get a deal? does it take, you know, one month to get a deal and we don&#39;t know. And that&#39;s why I say, you know, the 2011 it took three months to work out until they just stepped in and said, &quot;Nomas.&quot; Um, and then other view things like COVID, uh, you know, I put that article in, uh, was quoted in Market Watch on March 21st. I said, I don&#39;t know if this is the bottom, but the Dow&#39;s down 35% uh, or 33%. It was down 35% in 1918 with the Spanish flu. We are buying highquality companies right now. were going in the market and it went lower for two days uh and then they stepped in and backs stop the cor corporate credit market. They may have to step into backs stop the treasury market with this basis trade unwind and some of the foreign sellers. And by the way, negotiating with foreign counterparties when your bond market is weak uh is like uh you know trying to win a buttkicking contest with one leg tied behind your back. It&#39;s just not very effective. So, um, the real power move would be we&#39;ve taken 2 trillion plus off the balance sheet, Fed balance sheet. Just get in the market. I mean, I know the auctions have gone well this week, but you know, get in the market and say, look, bond vigilantes, you remember a guy named Mario Draghi in 2011. Don&#39;t mess with us. We are going to be in the market sapping everything up. You want to short it, we&#39;re going to rip your face off. and then let Trump call Xi and say you want to negotiate now as he would say Emma Emma ether so you know or however he does it uh that would be a powerful you know the Fed Federal Reserve is not a a global entity this was created by the US Congress and if they&#39;re not st backstopping our credit markets when we need it when we&#39;re trying to uh normalize imbalances that we allowed in an effort to rebuild the world uh we effectively lent our goodwill in exchange for one day taking some of that back. So you know whether it&#39;s 10% or 12% you know it&#39;s certainly not 145%. That&#39;s just to get people to the table. So take the hint come to the table. Uh but I think we need to go from a position of strength and that position of strength is a uh strong bond market. And uh even if Powell doesn&#39;t want to cut uh he&#39;s been too restrictive, but even if he doesn&#39;t want to cut, he should be in saying we got the we got the Treasury market bond vigilantes have at it. You you want to sell in the hole, we&#39;ll take every single p piece of paper you have and good luck with that. And then you go negotiate with these countries and it gets done in a day. Once they can&#39;t bully you around by dumping treasuries, they gota they gotta they gotta buckle because they need access to our markets. Uh S&amp;P talk about attention. S&amp;P 500 bullish percent. Okay. So, you know, don&#39;t buy here. You know, this is when we were buying in the hole in October 2022 when we bought Google, Amazon, etc. No one wanted them. Indicators like these are pretty good tells. In COVID, it went down to two, you know, 1.4. But even if you had bought when it was at 11 where it is today 2019 the last by the way you know 2011 is a good analogy fine but 2018 is also a really good analogy with the tariffs and it looks very similar and that one was much more of a V. Okay. And you had the S&amp;P 500 bullish percent index drop down below, you know, 15 13, which is, you know, where we got down to 12 uh on on Wednesday before the tweet by now. Love DJT. Uh, and you did get an abrupt recovery. So, be open-minded that it&#39;s going to happen very quick. And if the train leaves the station without you, it did it never let you in until COVID. So unless you&#39;re betting, you know, if you took advantage during this period that I&#39;m talking about now, buying the right companies at the right time, unless you&#39;re going to wind up with another pandemic two years from now, it probably doesn&#39;t let you in for many, many years. Uh, and that&#39;s why I held that special call and that&#39;s why so many of you took advantage once you looked under the hood and got a sense, got a a you know, I think a lot a lot of you were shocked. you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I didn&#39;t, you know, I listen to all your podcasts. I&#39;ve learned so much, but I had no idea the next level.&quot; And and that was again 10 or 15% of what we do here. So, um, anyway, I&#39;m glad that was helpful and I&#39;m glad a lot of you took advantage of it and some some more of you will take advantage. I got two more funding tomorrow and hopefully one you know a hand who knows how many before Saturday uh for new and uh for existing you just want to do it when you can provided uh days are still red. Maybe next week you get lucky. Maybe you couldn&#39;t do it this week. Next week you get lucky and we retest the lows. That would be a good day to do it, ladies and gentlemen. Uh but right now, you know, looking at this stuff, let&#39;s see if this double bottom can&#39;t even believe I&#39;m saying these words. uh double bottom holds. Uh and uh that might be it because god forbid you get a tweet over the weekend. Uh and you wind up with instead of the 2011 3 month scenario, you wind up with the 2018 which is more Trump-like. That was the last tariff thing and it&#39;s already hap you know it&#39;s it&#39;s done you know and uh uh because there&#39;s only one call that matters and everyone knows that it&#39;s the one with Xiinping. All right where are we? Mlelen oscillator again I&#39;m you know I&#39;m just visualizing I&#39;m showing you the things there&#39;s no certainties in anything but you can weigh the probabilities in your favor and that&#39;s all you can do. Even this is now getting overstretched. Uh, which is kind of a cyclical thing that&#39;s pretty pretty worth following. This is the Elliot wave pattern. Again, VIX came off the boil 55 52. Uh, did you get that in 2018? You got uh 36. So, let&#39;s see what it was in 2011. 48. Okay. So, you know, 2011, 2018, this was more about tariffs. So, that&#39;s kind of interesting. But, uh, so, so those are kind of some analoges to keep in mind, you know, but you look at the businesses, the these are ridiculous. These are people getting force liquidated. uh you know, we&#39;ll cover some of these names, but you know, you look at Nike, you don&#39;t have to think super hard about these. Yeah, it&#39;ll take some time and yeah, you got the tariffs and yeah, look, if you believe that tariffs are going to stay at 145%. Um, I got a bridge to sell you. I mean, it&#39;s just some things can&#39;t sustain. It&#39;s just, you know, it&#39;s kind of like when we were going through COVID with with uh Xi. Xi can take a lot more pain than anyone assumed, but sooner or later they all flip when the pressure becomes acute. And I got to assume that uh he&#39;s not exactly on solid ground given how he ran the COVID show. So, uh he was almost out last year before he flipped the switch overnight and uh went from crackdown to stimulus. Uh he had no choice and and they they haven&#39;t fully recovered. they&#39;re only starting their recovery. So, the last thing they want is flashbacks of this guy causing them economic pain. Uh so, my guess is he&#39;s going to come to the table and do a fair deal and they&#39;ll find a way for everyone to save face. Uh or, you know, he&#39;s going to really run a risk of um of how long he stays in that position and uh uh the hundred families that control the country will have something to say about that. So, let&#39;s see. But you look at Chevron, you look at Merc. I mean, these are businesses that you don&#39;t get at 40% off, 50% off, 70% off. Dow, Disney, J&amp;J. I mean, Intel. Yeah. I I mean it&#39;s if you&#39;re not buying these type of businesses, I&#39;m not telling you to buy, you know, the most risky things in the market, but but that type of stuff during periods like this, PayPal with all the cash reg Yeah, they&#39;re saying, &quot;What if Europe shuts down all the processors in in Europe?&quot; I mean, all these things can happen, but the the world only ends once and and if it ends this time, you the last thing you&#39;re worried about is your stocks. Okay? So, if you want to hedge, get a gun, get some canned food, but I wouldn&#39;t be selling your stocks because your stocks aren&#39;t going to matter if it comes down to guns and canned food. So, I&#39;ll leave it at that. Um, you know, some of these could arguably get a lower multiple, go down lower, but uh there are enough of them that it makes sense, even if you&#39;re wrong about the bottom of the market, to be adding. Uh, and um, that&#39;s that. But here&#39;s another thing that not a lot of people are paying attention to. Uh, the odds of a May cut have gone up and the odds of a June cut are 90, you know, 92%. So that&#39;s there&#39;s that. Uh, sentiment is, as we know, washed out. quote of the week, which is the the basic framework for Great Hill Capital. Great investment opportunities come around when excellent companies are surrounded by unusual circumstances that cause the stock to be misappraised. That&#39;s Warren Buffett, the man, the myth, the legend. Seth Clarin, the greatest edge an investor can have is a long-term orientation. Uh that needs to be coupled with low leverage. Okay, there you you know what you&#39;re seeing here were people running one and two and three and four and five and in some cases 100 times leverage on the on the um on some of the bond trades. Um generally the greater the stigma or revulsion the better the bargain. Uh we&#39;ve seen that time and time again. Greatest volume trade session of all time. So that&#39;s usually indicative of full capitulation. This is from Strategus. Strong advanced decline ratio, strongest since October 2011. Well, what did we just cover? The similarities to October 2011, which was uh actually that was the retest low before they started the recovery. So something to keep in mind. Again, worst case takes three three four months. Uh best case it could be immediate like the tariffs in uh 2018 which is more kind of Trump style. Um still a lot of cash on the sidelines. Stocks always crash. Worst drops of the S&amp;P since 1976. That&#39;s kind of interesting. This is, you know, pretty normal. The average drop every year is 14% according to this you know 70 78 14% 79 10% 80 17% 81 18% 82 these are all intrayear you know 84 13% 87 34% 90% uh that&#39;s probably a decent analogy uh 97 11% 1998 19% probably a decent analogy. Uh 2001 and two, the tech wreck, you had some 20s and a 30. Uh 2003, but you also had the terrorist event. Uh 2013, 14%. 2008 was the big one. 2009, you had another correction. 2011 was a 19% and here we are at an 18%. So this is pretty normal stuff. You always recover, resolve to new highs if you own good businesses. top Chinese leaders to meet on stimulus after Trump&#39;s tariff shock. Net retail purchases way up. They&#39;re buying in the whole hedge funds are selling and so far they&#39;ve been more right than hedge funds since uh co this is a great time to buy DJT. Uh he&#39;s still right by the way. He is still right. That quote came right around here or here maybe. Maybe this low. I don&#39;t know. I think it was here. So he&#39;s still been right. Uh, Mr. Market Timer himself. Uh, that&#39;s one guy when he calls the bottom, you better listen. Navaro, take it with a grain of salt. But, um, all right. What else do we have here? Biggest one day gain since World War II. Okay. Big gains tend to lead to much higher prices. So, this is Ryan Dietrich over at Carson. The next day on average tends to be down about 7/10en of 1%. That&#39;s pretty normal after a big one day rally like 9% uh that we had yesterday. So we&#39;re down what two or two 2% today 3%. So you gave back a 25% or a third. Uh 5 days out also tends to be down a little bit. Uh a month out you&#39;re up 2%. 3 months out you&#39;re up 3%. 6 months out you&#39;re up 11%. 12 months out, you&#39;re up 27%. So, if you own the right businesses, you&#39;re up way more than that. If the large correction is over, better times are likely coming. One one month out, you&#39;re at um 7.6%, 6 months out, you&#39;re at 25%, 12 months out, you&#39;re at 30%. Now, keep in mind that&#39;s off the lows. So, that might be a year an up a year up of uh 5%, but you&#39;re up 30% from the lows. So if you&#39;re adding money here, you really maximize your opportunities. Missing the best 10 days of the year can crush returns. Uh it shows that um on average, you know what you got if you were in. So 10% if you missed the 10 days you were down 12% and you can see year by year uh biggest VIX percentage declines and forward returns. So this is from Charlie Blo. Uh one year out, you&#39;re up on average 12.5, two years, 27, uh etc. Five years 100%. Uh S&amp;P Post biggest reversal since the 2008 financial crisis. Uh this is kind of funny. Before Trump paused the tweets, Goldman had them baseline moving to a recession. literally 1 hour and 13 minutes later they reverted their previous to previous non-recession baseline. So in an hour they flipped from calling for a recession to not calling for a recession. And that&#39;s the problem. If you&#39;re thinking about when&#39;s the perfect time to put money in and you wake up Monday and they had a call with G and you know the the S&amp;P&#39;s back up to 5,800, you kind of miss the opportunity. Uh huge. So, um, it&#39;s just worth keeping in mind CPI and we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s going to happen. We can&#39;t know. All we can know is are we buying good businesses at good prices? Can they become better prices? Sure. But over over time, don&#39;t be a pig. You know, it&#39;s like like with Doge, we say when when you cut the fat, the pigs squeal. They also say, you know, bulls make money, bears get make money, pigs get slaughtered. Don&#39;t be a pig. You&#39;re not going to get the exact bottom. you&#39;re not going to get the exact top, but you&#39;re buying businesses with a margin of safety doubles and triples over time is what you&#39;re what you&#39;re shooting for uh to get a uh return that uh that makes you excited. Overall, Prime Brook gross versus net. So again, hedge funds sold in the hole at the exact wrong time. We&#39;re going to find that out. Healthcare positioning, energy positioning, put volume, everyone&#39;s buying insurance after the house is burned down. High yield spreads going out a little bit. Keeping an eye on that, but we&#39;ll see if they, you know, they got to step in and uh defend the market. Earnings per share still going up. So, that&#39;s that could change quickly if this drags out a lot and we&#39;re going to learn a lot during earnings. Uh, but um there was some pull forward. So, we might get a little bit better earnings than expected. The key is going to be the guidance and the guidance is going to change daybyday and week-by-eek basis based on the phone calls that Trump has. Global junk bonds extend losses on Trump but it&#39;s still again not not anywhere close to 2002 levels um back to 2023 levels. So we keep an eye on that call put skew kind of at the bottom. This is what you see at big bottoms, COVID crash, Volmageddon, etc. Here&#39;s what&#39;s happened to the multiples of the Magnificent Seven stocks. So, they&#39;ve come down a lot, but you know, some of those could potentially come down more. Market reaction. So, let&#39;s see. forward 12-month return after two standard dev two oh after the market reaction. So 12-month forward return after a similar situation to this 59 on COVID 45 on great financial crisis 24 on black Monday. So it&#39;s just showing you uh what happens here. US construction spending beats expectations in February. That&#39;s interesting. that&#39;s uh helped Stanley Black &amp; Decker and Generrack and QXO Logistics now QXO rather uh Beacon Roofing Europe stocks on track for second biggest annual inflow. Okay. Share of S&amp;P stocks at 52- week lows. This is like the October 2022 lows. Those were actually times I do think maybe I&#39;m not entirely accurate. I I do think I was pretty aggressive in telling people to get in in uh October 2022 and then one more time in March of 2023. I was pretty aggressive. Usually I&#39;m just like, we&#39;re open. Let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s buy good businesses. Uh but those were I would say this week and uh back in October 2022 and then March of 2023 when we had a retest is when I was really really pushing. Uh breath is close to capitulation levels. I probably hit it. uh equity position S&amp;P stocks above 20-day moving average again going back to October 2022 low levels those were buy levels not sell levels tariff front running contrarian indicator elevated VIX levels have historically led to positive forward performance so 50 plus uh I guess this is 12 month out return average 32% uh so we just hit that extreme fear. This is almost broken off the chart. Bill was introduced to make auto loan interest tax deductible for US assembled vehicles. Uh so that&#39;s a bill circulating around Congress. That would be huge boon for Cooper Standard. Biggest 3-day declines in forward returns. So again, looking out a year, he doesn&#39;t have the averages, but they&#39;re all green. Three years, five years, etc. PE ratios have come down. S&amp;P at 18 times, tech at 21 times, financials at 14 times, comm services 16 times, healthcare 16 times, energy 12 times, materials 18, utilities 16. So yeah, there&#39;s stuff to buy. Uh net inflow. Uh here&#39;s the net inflow outflow from the southbound stock connect. We talked about that last summer. They&#39;ve been buying it till the cows come home. You can see there southbound buying hits record 35 billion Hong Kong dollars continues to grow. Stocks do well once a new bare market starts. One year one month out 2.7. Six months out 3.9. 12 months out 15. uh 24 months out 27. So you know if you burning yourself with the facts and you have these stats in front of you uh it kind of gives you the riskreward parameters and then you have to draw your own conclusion. But you know again percentage of stocks oversold these were times to be a buyer. This is from Schroers not a seller. Um all-star charts same type thing above their 200 day moving average. aggressive short covering which you saw in the middle of COVID. That was such a good year for us. It was unbelievable. All right, so um Dalio sees US China push for yuan deal as part of trade relief. Largest southbound connect buying ever in Hong Kong. Alibaba and 10 cents a significant benefactor. That&#39;s from Brendan Ahern. China leaders to meet on stimulus after Trump&#39;s tariff shock. So we&#39;re going to get it both ways which is probably why they were holding off last year. were like, why aren&#39;t they doing stim more stimulus? It&#39;s probably a hedge. They didn&#39;t want to blow all their stimulus and then have Trump come in and kill their their recovery. Better to keep it low and slow and then once the threat is there, then then power it up. Jack&#39;s Alibaba cloud visit a sign of support as tech giant accelerates adoption of AI. Alibaba executive sees explosive growth in AI applications in China in 2025. Deepseek Alibaba can help China narrow gap with US and leading AI models. Uh, China state firms pledge to boost share purchases in calm markets. Uh, cheapen and timu fines are history. That is beautiful. Bye-bye pin duo duo. Remember we said in unsustainable or unreliable numbers and certainly going to be unsustainable. We&#39;ll see about unreliable. Uh, how Alibaba is turning into China&#39;s AI powerhouse in a school for entrepreneurs. Investors fear another big blow up of basis trade as treasuries lose haven status. That&#39;s why Pal needs to step up and show some leadership on that. Uh this and it will help us negotiate better deals more quickly. This is a great time to buy. Tariff pause sparks historic rally. Uh US mortgage rates dropped to lowest since October, spurring demand. We covered that last week. Asian nations promise to buy more US gas to win tariff relief. This is going to be great for comtock in the Hannesville. They&#39;re that&#39;s going to be part of their deal. Uh give us lower tariffs. will buy every ounce of every barrel of um every BTU of uh LNG that you can you can sell us. Boeing deliveries in March jumped by 41% uh over a year earlier. So all these things are playing out. The fundamentals are getting better. Generates targets what? Growing data center demand. Automakers seek opportunity in the chaos of tariff trumps. They&#39;re offering employee pricing programs. So incentives are going up which will lead to volumes. Intel gains on report of joint venture deal with Taiwan Semiconductor helping them out with their fabs. Hedge funds pile up record short bets against stock as traders go into self-p protection mode selling in the hole. That was Monday. That&#39;s when I did my call with a private client call uh and said now it&#39;s go time. You know, get your money in. If you plan on getting money, get it to me tomorrow. And they did. Uh and really hats off to them. Uh hedge funds hit with steepest margin. But by the way, again, you&#39;re basically at those levels where you can still take advantage. Um okay, hedge funds hit with C. They&#39;re all blowing up from over leverage. That&#39;s the name of the game. Just never let them take you out on a stretcher. That&#39;s just a function of le leverage and position size position side sizing. If you manage your risk through position sizing and you manage your leverage to not take massive leverage, you just ride through these things. Your only risk is mark tomarket. That&#39;s short term. That&#39;s noise. If you know what you own, you just sit right through it. You sit on your hands. You play some golf. And you know, if it&#39;s a worst case like 2011, you got to sit for 3 months. That&#39;s a lot of rounds of golf. uh if it&#39;s the best case scenario like 2018, you know, in 3 months you&#39;re back up to new highs and off the golf course. What can I tell you? Uh tariff perception versus reality\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nGenerates targets what? Growing data center demand. Automakers seek opportunity in the chaos of tariff trumps.

That&#39;s when I did my call with a private client call uh and said now it&#39;s go time. You know, get your money in. If you plan on getting money, get it to me tomorrow. And they did. Uh and really hats off to them. Uh hedge funds hit with steepest margin. But by the way, again, you&#39;re basically at those levels where you can still take advantage. Um okay, hedge funds hit with C. They&#39;re all blowing up from over leverage. That&#39;s the name of the game. Just never let them take you out on a stretcher. That&#39;s just a function of le leverage and position size position side sizing. If you manage your risk through position sizing and you manage your leverage to not take massive leverage, you just ride through these things. Your only risk is mark tomarket. That&#39;s short term. That&#39;s noise. If you know what you own, you just sit right through it. You sit on your hands. You play some golf. And you know, if it&#39;s a worst case like 2011, you got to sit for 3 months. That&#39;s a lot of rounds of golf. uh if it&#39;s the best case scenario like 2018, you know, in 3 months you&#39;re back up to new highs and off the golf course. What can I tell you? Uh tariff perception versus reality\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstock market and sentiment results . So, uh Jeff did a good job uh compiling this and kind of showing that the fear of tariffs is greater than the actual impact that tariffs will have. So over the past couple weeks, tariffs have turned Wall Street and frankly the world upside down. We saw investors puking out of stocks at any price, forced liquidations and fear and uncertainty, reaching levels not seen since the great financial crisis or the tech wreck. Here&#39;s the thing. This wasn&#39;t some widespread systemic collapse. This was entirely man-made self-inflicted. And just as quickly as it started, it could end with one headline or one uh in Trump fashion, one tweet. Sure enough, this afternoon, we got one of those tweets. Market then ripped higher, posting the third biggest single day gain since World War II. These past couple weeks are exactly the kind of periods I live for. When you know what you own and understand the business behind the ticker, it&#39;s opportunities and dislocations like this that make being in this business so rewarding. And when the those opportunities show up, as Buffett would say, uh when it rains gold, pull out a bucket, not a thimble. This time we skip the bucket. We decided on a wheelbarrow. And of course, you&#39;ll never perfectly time the bottom. But 12 months from now, whether you pay uh buy VF VF Corp for $10 or $15 or Boeing at $130 or 150, it simply won&#39;t matter. Either way, you&#39;ll be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways. This sort of mentality, whether you call it ice in the veins or lack of the FOMO gene, boils down to one of our favorite concepts here at Great Hill Capital, zooming out despite all the fear, uncertainty, and running around like it&#39;s the end of the world. You&#39;ll notice this barely shows up on a long-term chart. It&#39;s nothing more than a blip on the radar. This week, we thought it would be a good time to for yet another Great Hill Capital Maxim burdening ourselves with the facts. That is on a company by company basis, looking at their tariff perception versus reality. Now with the tariff pause in effect, we can happily say one, those year-to- date year-to-ate peak to trough draw downs look a lot different and two the actual tariff exposure is now much lower. What you&#39;ll see is that in every case the short-term stock uh pullbacks far outweigh the actual risk. In some cases, tariffs might not even be be ending they might up end up being a net beneficiary within the 90-day pause. Those sell-offs now look downright silly. Nevertheless, let&#39;s burn ourselves with some facts here. Stanley Black &amp; Decker doing the same overshot shoot it did in 2001. Perception is the business will do uh terrible due to tariffs. Reality unless you believe someone is going to suddenly build a factor in the middle of Ohio and pose a legitimate competitive threat in the tool industry. This is nothing more than a one-off price increase. There are four major players in Stanley Black &amp; Decker has the least exposure to China 18% and one of the largest domestic footprints manufacturing more than 40% of its sales in the United States for nearly a decade. Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been shifting away from China and has been building its tariff playbook over the past 12 months with the least exposure to China industrywide. We could actually see a scenario where Stanley Black &amp; Decker gains market share through competitive pricing. At the end of the day, this is a leveraged arms dealer play on the housing market recovery. Uh tariffs don&#39;t change the fact that the US is short nearly 4 million housing units. They don&#39;t change the peak 30 to 39 US demographics and they certainly don&#39;t change the fact that DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley and Black &amp; Decker are industryleading tool companies that have been trusted for generations. So you can go through this. How are we on time? Yes. So Boeing, same story. Go through this article. He did a good job of actually highlighting what the CEOs said about tariffs on recent calls. Same with Baxter. And you can see the dimminimus, uh, VFC Corp, GenerRack. These are just a handful of names we&#39;ve discussed in past podcasts. Advanced Auto Parts, Alibaba, etc. You know, one of the things that&#39;s been circulating this week is about delisting again, the risk of the Trump Organization doing that. You know, we&#39;ve been going through this, uh, and it was a lot more acute in the Biden administration. um they\n\nStanley Black & Decker doing the same overshot shoot it did in 2001. Perception is the business will do uh terrible due to tariffs. Reality unless you believe someone is going to suddenly build a factor in the middle of Ohio and pose a legitimate competitive threat in the tool industry. This is nothing more than a one-off price increase.

They don&#39;t change the peak 30 to 39 US demographics and they certainly don&#39;t change the fact that DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley and Black & Decker are industryleading tool companies that have been trusted for generations. So you can go through this. Boeing, same story. Baxter. VFC Corp, GenerRack. Advanced Auto Parts, Alibaba. Southbound Connect Cooper Standard. Etsy Albamaro GXO logistics. NSC. United. Insider buying in Nike. Earnings season starting up. Expected to grow 7% yearonear.\n\nthis shows in 2023, this is from Brendan Ahern, gross domestic product was about 7.8 trillion in China. During the same year, China&#39;s exports to the US totaled about 500 billion. To determine the percentage of China&#39;s GDP represented by exports to the US, we can use the f following calculation and come up with 2.8% uh of China&#39;s G GDP is related to US exports to the United States. So, you know, that gives them some leverage for sure. Um, this talks about Southbound Connect Cooper Standard. just watched the interview I did with Jeff Edwards auto sales we had a lot of pull forward so that should give them nice cash flow in Q1 so that&#39;s an exciting way to start Etsy similar story they&#39;re beneficiary Albamaro GXO logistics so these again these are just some of the names sentiment washed out ### MISCELLANEOUS\nTransports earnings revisions last 60 days are revised down uh that&#39;s probably one or two companies Looks like NSC. Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m looking at the wrong thing. Okay. U United. So, some of the airlines downgraded that hurt transports. Uh that&#39;s those look like they&#39;re the biggest ones. Just the airlines. No surprise there. Airlines always have problems. Retail earnings uh down by 2.06. So again, expectations down. Insider buying in Nike about a half a million dollars worth. Um se inflation came in weaker than expected today. So that&#39;s good news from a Fed standpoint. Earnings uh season starting up. We&#39;ll get some color there. Uh expected to grow 7% yearonear. So that&#39;s a good thing. Uh and with that, we&#39;re going to move on to the ask me anything  question.\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nHere&#39;s one from another. Let&#39;s see. Michael Schultz. Estee Lauder. We like Estee Lauder. Jim Richards. Okay, this is about delisting. Uh, look, they already did the holding foreign companies accountable act. They already went through that with the PCAOB and passed. So if they want to delist it for the purpose of a negotiating um leverage point, you could switch out to Hong Kong shares and we may look into that. It&#39;s not something we need to do tomorrow morning, but um that is an option. I get, you know, my experience has been just sit tight, but if you&#39;re panicked, there&#39;s no downside of doing it other than the fact that you have just a little better liquidity uh in the US. Um, but no real issue because the Hong Kong currency is pegged. So, that&#39;s your hedge. Um, I think a good thing to do is check with your broker, get their color on it. And if you think it makes sense to do the switch, I think it&#39;s a few hundred bucks, you do it, then you&#39;ll own it in Hong Kong, not the end of the world. Um, but I generally think, you know, every time I just bit my lip and held my US shares, they&#39;ve been fine. So, we&#39;ll see if we get any more color on that in coming days, but at the moment, I&#39;m not inclined to knee-jerk do anything uh immediately. Michael Schultz, EL Trade. Okay, we covered that. Next one. Tom, do you have any thoughts on First Solar? Uh, we&#39;ve covered that a few times. It hasn&#39;t come down enough for me yet, but I keep my eye on those. They&#39;re definitely out of favor. Payton Hops, Dollar General. We&#39;ve covered that a million times. It&#39;s up from where we said generally. Okay. We haven&#39;t done anything with it. Um, looking at Delta and uh Norwegian. Those two are best in class. The class just happens to take the short bus. So, uh, nh. I think in both of these cases, your risk is the balance sheet because they both took a huge amount of debt on during co Uh liabilities 13 billion in debt. at 3 billion of cash generating three billion in cash. I mean, this is probably best in class. Do I know if this is the absolute bottom or not? I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know. D A L. I mean, at 30 bucks, you probably definitely want to take a stab. Does it matter if you buy it at 30 or 35? You&#39;re probably okay here to buy a few shares, buy some more at 30. Um, it&#39;s not something that I would do, but I think your thinking is okay for a trade. NCH, I think this is going to have more balance sheet issues. Looks like they&#39;re recovering a little bit on cash flow basis. Financial balance sheet, cash is 190 million. That seems pretty light. Number one, you got to make sure that&#39;s correct. And debt is 12 billion. I I wouldn&#39;t touch it right now. Uh refinancing is going to be a little harder the next few months probably. However, I I&#39;m sat here as a Brit in my hotel room watching BBC and my jaw hit the floor when none other than Tom Hayes came on the news. As a follower of the podcast, I felt so damn proud. I topped it topped off a great day following the huge Wednesday rally. Well done, sir, and keep up the good work. Thank you, Lee. I appreciate that on a week like this. Uh, no question about it. All right. Uh, Lucas Shan Huber. Okay. So, he&#39;s saying tax are going to stay high between US and China. If you&#39;re certain about that, then, you know, I can&#39;t debate you, but um I always take the under. Maybe I&#39;ll be wrong, but uh yeah, what I&#39;ve learned in all these years of of being in this business is the the the reality is nearly always better than the expectation in terms of, you know, fear-based expectations. when there&#39;s a lot of panic if you take a 12 to 24month view. Um so you always win betting on upside when it look looks darkest. In the short term it can get worse than expectations but in if you you know looking 12 to 24 months out you really can&#39;t go wrong and that&#39;s where leverage and and uh and risk management come to play. Christopher. Okay, we covered that about the Chinese stocks again. I mean, I feel like I feel like waiting for GDAU. Like, every year there&#39;s three weeks where I got to deal with is BABA going to get delisted, is BABA going to get delisted? And every year it&#39;s like no one knows, but probably not. But if you&#39;re worried, go transfer your shares to Hong Kong. Uh Bob Smith, it&#39;s so funny. Earlier this year, I was going to transfer all of my Hong Kong shares back to US and I was just like, nah, I don&#39;t want to pay the fee. It&#39;s it it makes no real difference. So, maybe I&#39;ll be transferring more to Hong Kong. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m going to see how this settles out. Talk to some people. I think even if they did it, you wind up with Hong Kong shares or cash anyway and then you can go buy it in Hong Kong, but check with your brokers. Bob Smith. Uh, okay. So that&#39;s that more on the same question. Phillip, what&#39;s your take on the 10-year yield bounce? China dumping for selling. We covered that earlier. Basis trade. Um, it&#39;s not a rotation. Should you be concerned? Look, the market&#39;s concerned. That&#39;s priced in. Eventually, if it gets bad, the Fed will have to intervene. The good news is they have a lot of dry power to powder to do so. It&#39;s not our base case. I think people just got caught off sides this week and that&#39;s just the way it works when you run run too much leverage. Thanks for all the great work. Someday people will have you on the Mount Rushmore of investing. I certainly will. Best Phipe. Thank you very much, Phipe. I appreciate that, especially uh on weeks like this. All right. Uh oh, this is interesting from uh PB Kelly. Thank you for your continued hard work. I remember being in Europe on a family trip in 2008 when the market was tanking. I was concerned that my father, who was in the investment business, might be in a foul mood or maybe even want to cut the trip short and head home. I was surprised when I got to breakfast one morning and he was in high spirits. I asked him why he was so happy and he said, quote, &quot;It&#39;s times like these when stocks return to their rightful owners. We are going to end up owning some of the great businesses out of this mess.&quot; End quote. I love the information you provide. Please keep it up. I think that&#39;s probably the quote of the week, maybe the quote of the year. Uh it is times like these when stocks return to their rightful owners. The cowboys and the shiny object followers are all flushed and people who do the work and know what they own are the buyers at these levels and then they lay them off in a year, two years, three years when the shiny object FOMO people are back and we help them out at multiples that are two or three times current current levels. So, uh, really thanks for sharing that, PB. On to the next. Daniel Borman, awesome podcast. Interested 10-year bond yield relative to tariffs rather than cut. Yeah. So, covered that. The auctions went well this week. So, that&#39;s a step in the right direction. Simon Stasunus If China decides to devalue its currency as a result of tariffs, that&#39;s what they already did. Um, they are also in the market buying Alibaba stock. So, there&#39;s a lot of offsets. All this is you can&#39;t make decisions on these short-term jerks because at the end of the day, they just have to get to the table and see what kind of deal they can make. I mean, if if you&#39;re going to bet that they never make a deal, then uh you you can&#39;t invest that way. Uh let&#39;s see, another Baba question. China, I mean, literally waiting for GDAU every year, same time. Uh hi Tom, quick question regarding Nike. When would you consider to buy with enough margin of safety? I think now uh we&#39;re not doing it because we think we have a better play on the consumer discretionary, but yeah, have at it for the long term. You&#39;ll be fine. Um, thanks for the free information you provide. Want to ask your uh estate ladder. It&#39;s above the current levels. I&#39;ll leave it at that. They&#39;re asking about fair value. Luke Jovik, anything changed? We covered that in the article about advanced auto parts and tariffs. So, you can review that. Tim D, uh, VF Corp balance sheet, they paid off 1.5 billion of debt. That&#39;s probably not reflected in the numbers that you&#39;re looking at yet. Max Payne, VIX at plus 50. What do you think about buying puts? Um, you&#39;re obviously new. Don L, do you actually agree with tariff calculations? Uh, no. That was done by Rardo Navaro. David Martin, can you take a look at Skyworks Solutions? Okay, that one is uh definitely worth looking at. SWKS. Okay. So, it&#39;s down about 2/3. Cash flows come down a bit. Revenues have come down a bit. See what the balance sheet looks like. Yeah, I think there&#39;s going to be opportunities in semis. We&#39;re playing it through Intel because we like Lip Banan. Okay, so they got some cash. They&#39;ve got some Where&#39;s the debt? Yeah, balance sheet&#39;s good. Let&#39;s take a look at free cash flow. Pretty good. Look at share issuance coming down. All right. So now just help me understand where they are in the cycle. Okay, so they got China business. Question is how much China business? Uh how do they compare to their competitors? Uh I think this one&#39;s worth doing some work on. So good find. Nothing to say. That&#39;s just worth start starting to do your work on and doing your competitive analysis and uh starting to drill down. Eric Haney, thoughts on Campbell? I think we covered this a few weeks ago and took a pass. It&#39;s a defensive. I mean, yeah, if you want to make 20% over the next two years, you probably get a bounce from 35. Uh, but not an exciting business for me. Higher and better uses of cash. John Webster. John, in environments like this, just buy the stock. Don&#39;t play around with that. Um, Phillip Ranska, Ze Davis. No, I don&#39;t. That&#39;s a messed up business. I I mean, it&#39;s not for me. Jimmy Jones, Baba Holder. Okay, next one. Zivco, caner, Canazerki. Uh, no. I would not consider Brown Foreman over Dagio, but it probably works. If they if one works, they&#39;re both going to work. Uh, great time and all your thanks for the great content I mentioned to all my friends when discussing investment affiliated. Oh, so here&#39;s a guy that bought a couple weeks ago and he doesn&#39;t have dry powder. Just wait it out. If you bought good businesses at good price, it doesn&#39;t matter if you bought Boeing at 150 or 140. Uh just just sit tight. You&#39;re fine. David Muinx, that&#39;s being greedy. Pigs get slaughtered. You&#39;re not going to get the exact bottom dollar. Just relax. You got good businesses at good prices. Just hang tight and in six months, you&#39;re going to be very, very happy. David Muinx, uh you think JX JHX would be a good investment for the upcoming home boom? JHX. Uh probably wind up being a target for QXO to buy. JHX. I&#39;d rather just play QXO. You&#39;re not going to get a better operator. And if this is at all a good business, Brad Jacobs will buy it. Um I think you&#39;re probably Let&#39;s see. description cement siding. Let&#39;s take a look balance sheet cash. All right. So, they&#39;re a little bit levered, but generally okay. Yeah, this looks pretty good. So, just just start studying their competitive advantage. Listen to eight or nine conference calls, start the process. But I think this is generally pretty good. Are you going to get the perfect price? I mean, yeah, 21. If you could get it at 18, would that be better than 21? Sure. Does it really matter? If you find that your anal after you&#39;ve done the analysis, you&#39;re comfortable with the business, I think you&#39;re probably okay in this range for the long term, that&#39;s a nice find. Um, and that&#39;s it. So,\n\nBrown Foreman over Dagio, but it probably works. If they if one works, they're both going to work. Uh, great time and all your thanks for the great content I mentioned to all my friends when discussing investment affiliated. Oh, so here's a guy that bought a couple weeks ago and he doesn't have dry powder. Just wait it out. If you bought good businesses at good price, it doesn't matter if you bought Boeing at 150 or 140.

Uh probably wind up being a target for QXO to buy. JHX. I'd rather just play QXO. You're not going to get a better operator. And if this is at all a good business, Brad Jacobs will buy it. Um I think you're probably Let's see. description cement siding. Let's take a look balance sheet [Music] cash. All right. So, they're a little bit levered, but generally okay. Yeah, this looks pretty good. So, just just start studying their competitive advantage. Listen to eight or nine conference calls, start the process. But I think this is generally pretty good. Are you going to get the perfect price? I mean, yeah, 21. If you could get it at 18, would that be better than 21? Sure. Does it really matter? If you find that your anal after you've done the analysis, you're comfortable with the business, I think you're probably okay in this range for the long term, that's a nice find. Um, and that's it. So, with that said , I'll be on Fox Business tomorrow morning. Tune in if you're free. Uh, we'll be back next week, same time, same place. And just hang tight. Know what you own. Look under the surface. Look at the balance sheet. Look at the free cash flow. Look at the mode of the business. And when all is said and done, even if your worst case fears come true, most of the businesses that we're talking about that you're probably interested in as a listener are going to pick up share if things get horrible. Uh and if they don't get horrible, they're going to recover very, very quickly and move to new highs. So, uh hang tight. This is what incredible opportunities are made of. This is what they look like. Always darkest before dawn. this too shall pass and onward and upward uh for for the next I god this feels so much like October 2022. I can't even tell you and feels a little bit candidly like March of of 2020. Uh so I'm very very enthusiastic for what's going to what's to come and uh I hope you'll join me in coming weeks and months as we see this unfold. Have a great night.\n\nKnow what you own.

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWelcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 286th video cast podcast for the week ending, April 10th, 2025.\n\nThis uh was meant for the pod charts, but want to cover it. This is from Ken Fiser, kind of drawing analoges to the 1998 kind of uh abrupt correction, bounceback, retest, and then recover. We&#39;re going to cover a number of different analoges in this week&#39;s podcast to get a sense of when we can expect to recover and then work out to new highs. I mean, that&#39;s really the name of the game. Uh\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nBBC had me on the fly uh after Trump tweeted um that he was going to pause the tariffs. So, I want to thank Marian Mosheri and Janie Wall for for thinking of me and having me on. We&#39;re going to listen in here in Delmore there. Well, let&#39;s cross live to New York again and this time speak to Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill Capital. Thomas, it&#39;s so good to talk to you. Um, I I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re seeing what the markets are doing. You&#39;ve seen what President Trump has said. Give me your reaction. Well, this is an absolute gamecher, Miriam. And you know there had been a lot of fear in the market the last few days. People were comparing this to the great financial crisis to the tech wreck. And the difference between this and those two crises that took years to work out was this was man-made. So it could be fixed in a day. And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re seeing today. And the beauty of President Trump&#39;s strategy and what he&#39;s done throughout his years is he escalates in order to deescalate. So now we we had a big ask and now we&#39;re down to 10%. The 10% across the board looks like nothing and everyone is relieved and in effect that is a big accomplishment in and goes a long way to balancing trade and and people now look at that as a very very low bar. So they&#39;ll negotiate over the next 90 days. The key that the markets love is there&#39;s some rationality in the room. People people generally believe the concept makes sense. Maybe they weren&#39;t in accordance with the execution. Uh, however, now we have have the relief valve and when it rains gold, pull out the bucket, not the thimble. There are things to buy. Yes, absolutely. Thomas, tell me this though. You know, some people are saying that this is America blinking. We&#39;ve heard in the last hour or so from the Treasury Secretary, uh, Mr. Bessant, who said this was his strategy all along. you kind of feel to me like you&#39;re saying possibly this is what the states the America wanted from the outset but even if this is an amazing clever ploy to get that 10% running along all those countries surely the markets don&#39;t like this level of kind of you know going up going down pushing pulling not knowing where you stand that can&#39;t be good for anyone or anything on the out there yeah I&#39;ve had more fun weeks in my investing career I can tell you that right now but I can say One thing, it shows a level of good faith. We&#39;ve got a win that we&#39;re getting some imbalances fixed. The negotiations will probably go on longer than 90 days and hopefully at some point we&#39;ll get get them on the phone uh between the US and China and start to chip away at some level of balance and then the market can go back to focusing on what? Focusing on earnings, focusing on cash flow, focusing on growth, focusing on employment and all those things have been pretty good. uh people were just starting to extrapolate if we stayed in this frozen period for too long would it put us into a recession and now that we&#39;ve unfrozen it and we&#39;re going back to good faith negotiations I think the market likes it and now companies can start to make decisions again we just had some reaction from the uh future German chancellor German chancellor designignate Mertz who said Europeans are united on defending ourselves and this shows that approach works best everyone&#39;s going to be claiming victory tonight aren&#39;t they well that&#39;s the whole thing. If everyone can save face and you know a great deal is when no one is perfectly happy and everyone saves face. And if that&#39;s the case today, then today is a celebration. Let&#39;s get back to business. Let&#39;s get back to trade. If there&#39;s some imbalances that are going to be normalized over the next 90 days, let&#39;s get that done and let&#39;s focus on growing and prosperity. But what about the 125% tariffs on China?\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthat we&#39;re getting some imbalances fixed. The negotiations will probably go on longer than 90 days and hopefully at some point we&#39;ll get get them on the phone uh between the US and China and start to chip away at some level of balance and then the market can go back to focusing on what?

Let&#39;s get back to business. Let&#39;s get back to trade. If there&#39;s some imbalances that are going to be normalized over the next 90 days, let&#39;s get that done and let&#39;s focus on growing and prosperity. But what about the 125% tariffs on China? That&#39;s kind of a fly in your ointment there. And you know, China has backed itself into a corner, Thomas, right? How does it get out? Well, t\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  that. But I think at some point cooler heads will prevail prevail. The signal is that if you&#39;re willing to come to the table, we have a rational administration that is willing to talk and there will be some way for both sides to save face and begin a dialogue. Will it be tonight? Probably not. Will it be a week from now? We don&#39;t know. But I would assume within the next couple of weeks, three, four weeks, uh the t the dialogue will begin and no one will be happy with the ultimate outcome. They&#39;ll meet somewhere in the middle and things will progress as planned. Okay. Well, Thomas, it&#39;s great to talk to you. Thanks so much for taking the time to speak to us on BBC News. Thank you so much. Well, let&#39;s talk a little bit more now about that 125% announcement on tariffs on China. Let&#39;s speak to Scott Kennedy, trustee chair in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Scott, good to talk to you. Um, I know that we&#39;ve only just heard this news of this 125% tariff on Chinese goods, but you know, the numbers are pretty much just numbers. There&#39;s a direction of travel here that we&#39;re seeing. How worried are you about that? Well, the numbers have already gotten so high. Uh, it really doesn&#39;t matter if they go up anymore. uh US China bilateral trade and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to join Stu Vney also on the fly uh this week on Friday in the midst of the chaos want to thank as always Christian Dagger and Stuart Vanney will listen in here repeating this Trump said on Truth Social quote just had a very productive call with the general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam who told me that Vietnam wants to cut their tariffs down to zero if they&#39;re able to make an agreement with the US. I thanked him on behalf of our country and I said I look forward to a meeting in the near future. End quote. I&#39;d call that a positive. President Trump also commented on Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Trump says quote this would be a perfect time for the Fed chairman Jerome Powell to cut interest rates. He&#39;s always late, but he could now change his image and quickly. Energy prices are down, interest rates are down, inflation is down, even eggs are down 69% and jobs are up all within two months. A big win for America. Cut interest rates, Jerome. And stop playing politics. Okay, perfect time to bring in Tom Hayes. He joins us on the phone. If Powell did cut rates and the f the Fed funds futures market thinks we&#39;re going to get five rate cuts this year, would that help the market? There&#39;s no question about it. He could put a floor in the market today if he wanted to. And Donald Trump is absolutely right. You know, the stock market is holding a buy one get one free sale today and everyone&#39;s running out of the store. Capitulation is in the air, Steu. And I think selective buying is in order. So we got You&#39;d like to see Powell cut rates today. And if he did, you think we&#39;d be off to the races? Yeah, he put a floor in 100%. He&#39;s not going to do it today. But if he can change his tone and say we are aware of what&#39;s happening as it relates to policy and we stand ready to act, that is the message he needs to give to the market. If he wants to be a vulker-like figure in the world and be remembered, he needs to step up right now and stand in and say, &quot;We&#39;re standing behind the United States. We&#39;re standing behind the policy. We stand ready to act.&quot; Donald Trump is 100% right on this. We&#39;ve been on this program. We&#39;ve been looking at all the different sectors of the market. Almost all of them are down. It&#39;s pretty much across the board. But do you have a particular sector that you think would be a good place to put some money right now? Yes. The silver lining of this is interest rates are coming down. The 10-year yield below 4%. I had a friend who got a 7-year adjustable rate mortgage yesterday at 5.1%. T\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nBrad Jacobs is a money maker for shareholders.

If you did a million dollars with him in United Rentals, URI, in 1997 when he got involved, it&#39;s worth 89 million today. He&#39;s a money maker. And this is this is one of the few times you can get in on the ground floor with Brad Jacobs with QXO is getting I got I got to go but QXO I shall remember that and it is down 3% today but we&#39;ll listen to you Tom Hayes.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd I was really happy about that because so many of you took advantage of the opportunity.

And um I&#39;m seeing it across the board. The professionals hedge funds are record selling in the hole after the crash. Uh retail investors are actually starting to buy pretty aggressively. And here&#39;s the news, ladies and gentlemen. Uh retail investors have mostly been right since co obviously the ones chasing shiny objects got smoked uh in 2001. The ones chasing shiny objects etc. But the ones that have been buying the dips, high quality stuff for the long term have really really done well. and it&#39;s reflected in the numbers uh in um uh in the numbers uh since COVID.

And I, you know, my clients had really an incredible opportunity to see that on Monday and Tuesday. It&#39;s not like, oh, the market&#39;s down, let&#39;s just buy. It&#39;s dissecting each individual business and what will be the impact of tariffs. And in most of the cases with the businesses uh as you dug into the fi fundamentals and how they&#39;ve positioned themselves through deleveraging through free free cash flow through um all the things that they&#39;ve set up even if it got really bad what winds up is they wind up coming out of this situation with more share not less share. So that is going to be a major factor moving forward and we&#39;re going to talk about that today.\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUh this is interesting because today there was a level of dis despondency that um we have not seen in a long time. And I thought it was kind of interesting because yesterday everyone was excited. And I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on charts and that type of thing, but when you see fundamentals completely thrown out of the window and no longer having any bearing, you have to go a little bit to the technicals and that just comes from experience. And uh I sent this to a friend who was having a little bit of a tough time, smart guy, and uh he&#39;s he always winds up on the right side uh of everything. But when he sent when I sent this to him, I said, &quot;Look, I don&#39;t do a lot of technical analysis, so don&#39;t go sending this around that Tom Hayes is now looking at charts for his uh uh key uh you know, moves to to move ahead.&quot; But, you know, last time I checked, this looked like a pretty solid double bottom. Um, this is on only on a 60-minute chart, so you know, time will tell. But, you know, that was Friday and then you got the rally up and then you got the wipe out and then\n\nBrown Foreman over Dagio, but it probably works. If they if one works, they're both going to work. Uh, great time and all your thanks for the great content I mentioned to all my friends when discussing investment affiliated. Oh, so here's a guy that bought a couple weeks ago and he doesn't have dry powder. Just wait it out. If you bought good businesses at good price, it doesn't matter if you bought Boeing at 150 or 140. Uh just just sit tight. You're fine. David Muinx, that's being greedy. Pigs get slaughtered. You're not going to get the exact bottom dollar. Just relax. You got good businesses at good prices. Just hang tight and in six months, you're going to be very, very happy. David Muinx, uh you think JX JHX would be a good investment for the upcoming home boom? JHX. Uh probably wind up being a target for QXO to buy. JHX. I'd rather just play QXO. You're not going to get a better operator. And if this is at all a good business, Brad Jacobs will buy it. Um I think you're probably Let's see. description cement siding. Let's take a look balance sheet [Music] cash. All right. So, they're a little bit levered, but generally okay. Yeah, this looks pretty good. So, just just start studying their competitive advantage. Listen to eight or nine conference calls, start the process. But I think this is generally pretty good. Are you going to get the perfect price? I mean, yeah, 21. If you could get it at 18, would that be better than 21? Sure. Does it really matter? If you find that your anal after you've done the analysis, you're comfortable with the business, I think you're probably okay in this range for the long term, that's a nice find. Um, and that's it. So, with that said , I'll be on Fox Business tomorrow morning. Tune in if you're free. Uh, we'll be back next week, same time, same place. And just hang tight. Know what you own. Look under the surface. Look at the balance sheet. Look at the free cash flow. Look at the mode of the business. And when all is said and done, even if your worst case fears come true, most of the businesses that we're talking about that you're probably interested in as a listener are going to pick up share if things get horrible. Uh and if they don't get horrible, they're going to recover very, very quickly and move to new highs. So, uh hang tight. This is what incredible opportunities are made of. This is what they look like. Always darkest before dawn. this too shall pass and onward and upward uh for for the next I god this feels so much like October 2022. I can't even tell you and feels a little bit candidly like March of of 2020. Uh so I'm very very enthusiastic for what's going to what's to come and uh I hope you'll join me in coming weeks and months as we see this unfold. Have a great night.",

Uh tariff perception versus reality\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstock market and sentiment results . So, uh Jeff did a good job uh compiling this and kind of showing that the fear of tariffs is greater than the actual impact that tariffs will have. So over the past couple weeks, tariffs have turned Wall Street and frankly the world upside down. We saw investors puking out of stocks at any price, forced liquidations and fear and uncertainty, reaching levels not seen since the great financial crisis or the tech wreck. Here&#39;s the thing. This wasn&#39;t some widespread systemic collapse. This was entirely man-made self-inflicted. And just as quickly as it started, it could end with one headline or one uh in Trump fashion, one tweet. Sure enough, this afternoon, we got one of those tweets. Market then ripped higher, posting the third biggest single day gain since World War II. These past couple weeks are exactly the kind of periods I live for. When you know what you own and understand the business behind the ticker, it&#39;s opportunities and dislocations like this that make being in this business so rewarding. And when the those opportunities show up, as Buffett would say, uh when it rains gold, pull out a bucket, not a thimble. This time we skip the bucket. We decided on a wheelbarrow. And of course, you&#39;ll never perfectly time the bottom. But 12 months from now, whether you pay uh buy VF VF Corp for $10 or $15 or Boeing at $130 or 150, it simply won&#39;t matter. Either way, you&#39;ll be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways. This sort of mentality, whether you call it ice in the veins or lack of the FOMO gene, boils down to one of our favorite concepts here at Great Hill Capital, zooming out despite all the fear, uncertainty, and running around like it&#39;s the end of the world. You&#39;ll notice this barely shows up on a long-term chart. It&#39;s nothing more than a blip on the radar. This week, we thought it would be a good time to for yet another Great Hill Capital Maxim burdening ourselves with the facts. That is on a company by company basis, looking at their tariff perception versus reality. Now with the tariff pause in effect, we can happily say one, those year-to- date year-to-ate peak to trough draw downs look a lot different and two the actual tariff exposure is now much lower. What you&#39;ll see is that in every case the short-term stock uh pullbacks far outweigh the actual risk. In some cases, tariffs might not even be be ending they might up end up being a net beneficiary within the 90-day pause. Those sell-offs now look downright silly. Nevertheless, let&#39;s burn ourselves with some facts here. Stanley Black &amp; Decker doing the same overshot shoot it did in 2001. Perception is the business will do uh terrible due to tariffs. Reality unless you believe someone is going to suddenly build a factor in the middle of Ohio and pose a legitimate competitive threat in the tool industry. This is nothing more than a one-off price increase. There are four major players in Stanley Black &amp; Decker has the least exposure to China 18% and one of the largest domestic footprints manufacturing more than 40% of its sales in the United States for nearly a decade. Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been shifting away from China and has been building its tariff playbook over the past 12 months with the least exposure to China industrywide. We could actually see a scenario where Stanley Black &amp; Decker gains market share through competitive pricing. At the end of the day, this is a leveraged arms dealer play on the housing market recovery. Uh tariffs don&#39;t change the fact that the US is short nearly 4 million housing units. They don&#39;t change the peak 30 to 39 US demographics and they certainly don&#39;t change the fact that DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley and Black &amp; Decker are industryleading tool companies that have been trusted for generations. So you can go through this. How are we on time? Yes. So Boeing, same story. Go through this article. He did a good job of actually highlighting what the CEOs said about tariffs on recent calls. Same with Baxter. And you can see the dimminimus, uh, VFC Corp, GenerRack. These are just a handful of names we&#39;ve discussed in past podcasts. Advanced Auto Parts, Alibaba, etc. You know, one of the things that&#39;s been circulating this week is about delisting again, the risk of the Trump Organization doing that. You know, we&#39;ve been going through this, uh, and it was a lot more acute in the Biden administration. um they",

    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nBrad Jacobs is a money maker for shareholders. He&#39;s got a a building supply rollup called QXO. QXO just bought Beacon Roofing. This guy is a money maker. He did XBO Logistics. If you put in a million dollars with him in 2009, it&#39;s $160 million last year, 160 Bagger. If you did a million dollars with him in United Rentals, URI, in 1997 when he got involved, it&#39;s worth 89 million today. He&#39;s a money maker. And this is this is one of the few times you can get in on the ground floor with Brad Jacobs with QXO is getting I got I got to go but QXO I shall remember that and it is down 3% today but we&#39;ll listen to you Tom Hayes.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd I was really happy about that because so many of you took advantage of the opportunity. We went position by position and not just talking charts and uh uh cursory fundamentals but actually digging into the fundamentals of each business balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement and so many of you saw the opportunity to reup and add into the weakness. So, I want to acknowledge um the one so far and obviously you can see there&#39;s going to be opportunity here uh uh to add, but um most of you have already taken advantage. Awesome job, Frank, Jim, Joe, of course, Brad, Marlin, uh, and then new people that have come in for our Q2 2025 opening taking advantage of this opportunity of a lifetime, which is really what it&#39;s created, this man-made uh, situation, which we&#39;re going to get into.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI&#39;ll be on Fox Business tomorrow morning on Varnian Co. at 9:45 a.m. And this is one of the few correction environments that I&#39;ve ever seen where retail investors uh are more confident meaning in the market taking advantage of the opportunities and professionals are scared out of their pants. And um I&#39;m seeing it across the board. The professionals hedge funds are record selling in the hole after the crash. Uh retail investors are actually starting to buy pretty aggressively. And here&#39;s the news, ladies and gentlemen. Uh retail investors have mostly been right since co obviously the ones chasing shiny objects got smoked uh in 2001. The ones chasing shiny objects etc. But the ones that have been buying the dips, high quality stuff for the long term have really really done well. and it&#39;s reflected in the numbers uh in um uh in the numbers uh since COVID. So, kudos for those of you taking advantage on the buy 1 get one free sales rather than running out of the store, actually running into the store. And I know it hasn&#39;t been easy. I&#39;ve had more fun weeks in my career. That&#39;s for sure. But you also have to recognize that, you know, it&#39;s cliche in a way, but when it rains gold, you got to pull out the bucket, not the thimble. Uh it&#39;s not willy-nilly.

Um, this is on only on a 60-minute chart, so you know, time will tell. But, you know, that was Friday and then you got the rally up and then you got the wipe out and then finally  you got the huge rally yesterday when Trump said this is a good time to buy stocks. We&#39;re going to pause the tariffs and then today you gave a little back. That should be expected. Why? Because you had a lot of people that had to buy quickly or cover quickly and then you just test them out, make sure they&#39;re serious. And we my sense is we would work higher, but I&#39;m going to go through some some different things at this point. You know, we&#39;re less concerned about the indices generally than we are about the businesses that we own. Here&#39;s on a daily basis. This gives you an idea. So, you did cover all of these lows, take these out. This kind of held up. Little bit of indecision today. I could see some consolidation for a while, maybe staying within this candle here, and then we work up over time. um you know these are even on the weekly could it you know we discussed last week could it push down to 450 it could I think we saw where the Trump put is certainly as it relates to the bond market I think that also has to do with equities and then as if you uh step back and you see these type of situations after big draw downs like 2022 you rally and then you get these checkbacks here uh like we&#39;re seeing now like you saw in 2004 for like you saw in 2011. And speaking of 2011, we are going to discuss that. What you can see here in 2011 is it looks like you know a month or two, this is a monthly chart of of some uh consolidation and then you just rallied and and continued the trend. Uh that was actually three full months of consolidation. So we&#39;re going to look at that as a possible analog as well. Uh but the key is once the primary pain was in in the short term even though you bounced around for two and a half months uh you didn&#39;t really make you made marginal new lows but but over time you know if you if you blinked went on vacation four months later the market was recovered six months later you were at new highs and off to the races. So you know when I say and we went into it whether you buy Boeing at 130 or 150 it&#39;s not going to make a difference in the long term when it&#39;s a $300 stock. Uh, everyone likes to get the perfect bottom and the perfect top. It&#39;s just uh not perfectly realistic. So, what do you do? You buy a little more on red days. You you uh and then when it gets extremely overvalued, you take it off in tanches and and uh same thing over and over. So, this was 2011. And the reason I bring this one up, I&#39;m going to see if I can run these side by side just so you can get an idea here. Okay, I can. What do you know? All right. So, if you look here, this is 2011 and this is 2025. Um, so you had some real strength from the recent lows about a year earlier and then you kind of had this warning shot in July and then you rallied into August and then it was just a complete fall off the cliff uh in late July through early August and you basically put in the lows. You had this violent move up, then a back test back to uh that level. Then a V rally up, then a marginal new lows in October and then straight back up uh which would be you know back over the 200 day which would be back to 5,800 on the S&P. Uh and then you chopped around and then\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nAnd in this case, it&#39;s kind of interesting because I hate to even compare it. What I&#39;m trying to do is set you up for the worst case scenario. Plan for the worst and expect the best because the 2011 European debt crisis and the great financial crisis and the tech wreck were a function of years of excess buildup. Okay, the tech wreck was you know five, six, seven years. So it took three, four years to work through. The European debt crisis was decades of excess debt buildup and it took years to work uh you know time to work through. Um the great financial crisis, years of excess buildup. We don&#39;t really have that right now.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nGenerates targets what? Growing data center demand. Automakers seek opportunity in the chaos of tariff trumps. They&#39;re offering employee pricing programs. So incentives are going up which will lead to volumes. Intel gains on report of joint venture deal with Taiwan Semiconductor helping them out with their fabs. Hedge funds pile up record short bets against stock as traders go into self-p protection mode selling in the hole. That was Monday. That&#39;s when I did my call with a private client call uh and said now it&#39;s go time. You know, get your money in. If you plan on getting money, get it to me tomorrow. And they did. Uh and really hats off to them. Uh hedge funds hit with steepest margin. But by the way, again, you&#39;re basically at those levels where you can still take advantage. Um okay, hedge funds hit with C. They&#39;re all blowing up from over leverage. That&#39;s the name of the game. Just never let them take you out on a stretcher. That&#39;s just a function of le leverage and position size position side sizing. If you manage your risk through position sizing and you manage your leverage to not take massive leverage, you just ride through these things. Your only risk is mark tomarket. That&#39;s short term. That&#39;s noise. If you know what you own, you just sit right through it. You sit on your hands. You play some golf. And you know, if it&#39;s a worst case like 2011, you got to sit for 3 months. That&#39;s a lot of rounds of golf. uh if it&#39;s the best case scenario like 2018, you know, in 3 months you&#39;re back up to new highs and off the golf course. What can I tell you? Uh tariff perception versus reality\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstock market and sentiment results . So, uh Jeff did a good job uh compiling this and kind of showing that the fear of tariffs is greater than the actual impact that tariffs will have. So over the past couple weeks, tariffs have turned Wall Street and frankly the world upside down. We saw investors puking out of stocks at any price, forced liquidations and fear and uncertainty, reaching levels not seen since the great financial crisis or the tech wreck. Here&#39;s the thing. This wasn&#39;t some widespread systemic collapse. This was entirely man-made self-inflicted. And just as quickly as it started, it could end with one headline or one uh in Trump fashion, one tweet. Sure enough, this afternoon, we got one of those tweets. Market then ripped higher, posting the third biggest single day gain since World War II. These past couple weeks are exactly the kind of periods I live for. When you know what you own and understand the business behind the ticker, it&#39;s opportunities and dislocations like this that make being in this business so rewarding. And when the those opportunities show up, as Buffett would say, uh when it rains gold, pull out a bucket, not a thimble. This time we skip the bucket. We decided on a wheelbarrow. And of course, you&#39;ll never perfectly time the bottom. But 12 months from now, whether you pay uh buy VF VF Corp for $10 or $15 or Boeing at $130 or 150, it simply won&#39;t matter. Either way, you&#39;ll be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways. This sort of mentality, whether you call it ice in the veins or lack of the FOMO gene, boils down to one of our favorite concepts here at Great Hill Capital, zooming out despite all the fear, uncertainty, and running around like it&#39;s the end of the world. You&#39;ll notice this barely shows up on a long-term chart. It&#39;s nothing more than a blip on the radar. This week, we thought it would be a good time to for yet another Great Hill Capital Maxim burdening ourselves with the facts. That is on a company by company basis, looking at their tariff perception versus reality. Now with the tariff pause in effect, we can happily say one, those year-to- date year-to-ate peak to trough draw downs look a lot different and two the actual tariff exposure is now much lower. What you&#39;ll see is that in every case the short-term stock uh pullbacks far outweigh the actual risk. In some cases, tariffs might not even be be ending they might up end up being a net beneficiary within the 90-day pause. Those sell-offs now look downright silly. Nevertheless, let&#39;s burn ourselves with some facts here. Stanley Black &amp; Decker doing the same overshot shoot it did in 2001. Perception is the business will do uh terrible due to tariffs. Reality unless you believe someone is going to suddenly build a factor in the middle of Ohio and pose a legitimate competitive threat in the tool industry. This is nothing more than a one-off price increase. There are four major players in Stanley Black &amp; Decker has the least exposure to China 18% and one of the largest domestic footprints manufacturing more than 40% of its sales in the United States for nearly a decade. Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been shifting away from China and has been building its tariff playbook over the past 12 months with the least exposure to China industrywide. We could actually see a scenario where Stanley Black &amp; Decker gains market share through competitive pricing. At the end of the day, this is a leveraged arms dealer play on the housing market recovery. Uh tariffs don&#39;t change the fact that the US is short nearly 4 million housing units. They don&#39;t change the peak 30 to 39 US demographics and they certainly don&#39;t change the fact that DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley and Black &amp; Decker are industryleading tool companies that have been trusted for generations. So you can go through this. How are we on time? Yes. So Boeing, same story. Go through this article. He did a good job of actually highlighting what the CEOs said about tariffs on recent calls. Same with Baxter. And you can see the dimminimus, uh, VFC Corp, GenerRack. These are just a handful of names we&#39;ve discussed in past podcasts. Advanced Auto Parts, Alibaba, etc. You know, one of the things that&#39;s been circulating this week is about delisting again, the risk of the Trump Organization doing that. You know, we&#39;ve been going through this, uh, and it was a lot more acute in the Biden administration. um they\n\nthis shows in 2023, this is from Brendan Ahern, gross domestic product was about 7.8 trillion in China. During the same year, China&#39;s exports to the US totaled about 500 billion. To determine the percentage of China&#39;s GDP represented by exports to the US, we can use the f following calculation and come up with 2.8% uh of China&#39;s G GDP is related to US exports to the United States. So, you know, that gives them some leverage for sure. Um, this talks about Southbound Connect Cooper Standard. just watched the interview I did with Jeff Edwards auto sales we had a lot of pull forward so that should give them nice cash flow in Q1 so that&#39;s an exciting way to start Etsy similar story they&#39;re beneficiary Albamaro GXO logistics so these again these are just some of the names sentiment washed out ### MISCELLANEOUS\nTransports earnings revisions last 60 days are revised down uh that&#39;s probably one or two companies Looks like NSC. Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m looking at the wrong thing. Okay. U United. So, some of the airlines downgraded that hurt transports. Uh that&#39;s those look like they&#39;re the biggest ones. Just the airlines. No surprise there. Airlines always have problems. Retail earnings uh down by 2.06. So again, expectations down. Insider buying in Nike about a half a million dollars worth. Um se inflation came in weaker than expected today. So that&#39;s good news from a Fed standpoint. Earnings uh season starting up. We&#39;ll get some color there. Uh expected to grow 7% yearonear. So that&#39;s a good thing. Uh and with that, we&#39;re going to move on to the ask me anything  question.",

Reality unless you believe someone is going to suddenly build a factor in the middle of Ohio and pose a legitimate competitive threat in the tool industry. This is nothing more than a one-off price increase. There are four major players in Stanley Black & Decker has the least exposure to China 18% and one of the largest domestic footprints manufacturing more than 40% of its sales in the United States for nearly a decade. Stanley Black & Decker has been shifting away from China and has been building its tariff playbook over the past 12 months with the least exposure to China industrywide. We could actually see a scenario where Stanley Black & Decker gains market share through competitive pricing. At the end of the day, this is a leveraged arms dealer play on the housing market recovery. Uh tariffs don&#39;t change the fact that the US is short nearly 4 million housing units. They don&#39;t change the peak 30 to 39 US demographics and they certainly don&#39;t change the fact that DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley and Black & Decker are industryleading tool companies that have been trusted for generations.

Insider buying in Nike. Earnings season starting up. Expected to grow 7% yearonear.\n\nKnow what you own. Look under the surface. Look at the balance sheet. Look at the free cash flow. Look at the mode of the business. And when all is said and done, even if your worst case fears come true, most of the businesses that we&#39;re talking about that you&#39;re probably interested in as a listener are going to pick up share if things get horrible. Uh and if they don&#39;t get horrible, they&#39;re going to recover very, very quickly and move to new highs. So, uh hang tight. This is what incredible opportunities are made of. This is what they look like. Always darkest before dawn. this too shall pass and onward and upward uh for for the next I god this feels so much like October 2022. I can&#39;t even tell you and feels a little bit candidly like March of of 2020. Uh so I&#39;m very very enthusiastic for what&#39;s going to what&#39;s to come and uh I hope you&#39;ll join me in coming weeks and months as we see this unfold.",
    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nHere&#39;s one from another. Let&#39;s see. Michael Schultz. Estee Lauder. We like Estee Lauder. Jim Richards. Okay, this is about delisting. Uh, look, they already did the holding foreign companies accountable act. They already went through that with the PCAOB and passed. So if they want to delist it for the purpose of a negotiating um leverage point, you could switch out to Hong Kong shares and we may look into that. It&#39;s not something we need to do tomorrow morning, but um that is an option. I get, you know, my experience has been just sit tight, but if you&#39;re panicked, there&#39;s no downside of doing it other than the fact that you have just a little better liquidity uh in the US. Um, but no real issue because the Hong Kong currency is pegged. So, that&#39;s your hedge. Um, I think a good thing to do is check with your broker, get their color on it. And if you think it makes sense to do the switch, I think it&#39;s a few hundred bucks, you do it, then you&#39;ll own it in Hong Kong, not the end of the world. Um, but I generally think, you know, every time I just bit my lip and held my US shares, they&#39;ve been fine. So, we&#39;ll see if we get any more color on that in coming days, but at the moment, I&#39;m not inclined to knee-jerk do anything uh immediately. Michael Schultz, EL Trade. Okay, we covered that. Next one. Tom, do you have any thoughts on First Solar? Uh, we&#39;ve covered that a few times. It hasn&#39;t come down enough for me yet, but I keep my eye on those. They&#39;re definitely out of favor. Payton Hops, Dollar General. We&#39;ve covered that a million times. It&#39;s up from where we said generally. Okay. We haven&#39;t done anything with it. Um, looking at Delta and uh Norwegian. Those two are best in class. The class just happens to take the short bus. So, uh, nh. I think in both of these cases, your risk is the balance sheet because they both took a huge amount of debt on during co Uh liabilities 13 billion in debt. at 3 billion of cash generating three billion in cash. I mean, this is probably best in class. Do I know if this is the absolute bottom or not? I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know. D A L. I mean, at 30 bucks, you probably definitely want to take a stab. Does it matter if you buy it at 30 or 35? You&#39;re probably okay here to buy a few shares, buy some more at 30. Um, it&#39;s not something that I would do, but I think your thinking is okay for a trade. NCH, I think this is going to have more balance sheet issues. Looks like they&#39;re recovering a little bit on cash flow basis. Financial balance sheet, cash is 190 million. That seems pretty light. Number one, you got to make sure that&#39;s correct. And debt is 12 billion. I I wouldn&#39;t touch it right now. Uh refinancing is going to be a little harder the next few months probably. However, I I&#39;m sat here as a Brit in my hotel room watching BBC and my jaw hit the floor when none other than Tom Hayes came on the news. As a follower of the podcast, I felt so damn proud. I topped it topped off a great day following the huge Wednesday rally. Well done, sir, and keep up the good work. Thank you, Lee. I appreciate that on a week like this. Uh, no question about it. All right. Uh, Lucas Shan Huber. Okay. So, he&#39;s saying tax are going to stay high between US and China. If you&#39;re certain about that, then, you know, I can&#39;t debate you, but um I always take the under. Maybe I&#39;ll be wrong, but uh yeah, what I&#39;ve learned in all these years of of being in this business is the the the reality is nearly always better than the expectation in terms of, you know, fear-based expectations. when there&#39;s a lot of panic if you take a 12 to 24month view. Um so you always win betting on upside when it look looks darkest. In the short term it can get worse than expectations but in if you you know looking 12 to 24 months out you really can&#39;t go wrong and that&#39;s where leverage and and uh and risk management come to play. Christopher. Okay, we covered that about the Chinese stocks again. I mean, I feel like I feel like waiting for GDAU. Like, every year there&#39;s three weeks where I got to deal with is BABA going to get delisted, is BABA going to get delisted? And every year it&#39;s like no one knows, but probably not. But if you&#39;re worried, go transfer your shares to Hong Kong. Uh Bob Smith, it&#39;s so funny. Earlier this year, I was going to transfer all of my Hong Kong shares back to US and I was just like, nah, I don&#39;t want to pay the fee. It&#39;s it it makes no real difference. So, maybe I&#39;ll be transferring more to Hong Kong. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m going to see how this settles out. Talk to some people. I think even if they did it, you wind up with Hong Kong shares or cash anyway and then you can go buy it in Hong Kong, but check with your brokers. Bob Smith. Uh, okay. So that&#39;s that more on the same question. Phillip, what&#39;s your take on the 10-year yield bounce? China dumping for selling. We covered that earlier. Basis trade. Um, it&#39;s not a rotation. Should you be concerned? Look, the market&#39;s concerned. That&#39;s priced in. Eventually, if it gets bad, the Fed will have to intervene. The good news is they have a lot of dry power to powder to do so. It&#39;s not our base case. I think people just got caught off sides this week and that&#39;s just the way it works when you run run too much leverage. Thanks for all the great work. Someday people will have you on the Mount Rushmore of investing. I certainly will. Best Phipe. Thank you very much, Phipe. I appreciate that, especially uh on weeks like this. All right. Uh oh, this is interesting from uh PB Kelly. Thank you for your continued hard work. I remember being in Europe on a family trip in 2008 when the market was tanking. I was concerned that my father, who was in the investment business, might be in a foul mood or maybe even want to cut the trip short and head home. I was surprised when I got to breakfast one morning and he was in high spirits. I asked him why he was so happy and he said, quote, &quot;It&#39;s times like these when stocks return to their rightful owners. We are going to end up owning some of the great businesses out of this mess.&quot; End quote. I love the information you provide. Please keep it up. I think that&#39;s probably the quote of the week, maybe the quote of the year. Uh it is times like these when stocks return to their rightful owners. The cowboys and the shiny object followers are all flushed and people who do the work and know what they own are the buyers at these levels and then they lay them off in a year, two years, three years when the shiny object FOMO people are back and we help them out at multiples that are two or three times current current levels. So, uh, really thanks for sharing that, PB. On to the next. Daniel Borman, awesome podcast. Interested 10-year bond yield relative to tariffs rather than cut. Yeah. So, covered that. The auctions went well this week. So, that&#39;s a step in the right direction. Simon Stasunus If China decides to devalue its currency as a result of tariffs, that&#39;s what they already did. Um, they are also in the market buying Alibaba stock. So, there&#39;s a lot of offsets. All this is you can&#39;t make decisions on these short-term jerks because at the end of the day, they just have to get to the table and see what kind of deal they can make. I mean, if if you&#39;re going to bet that they never make a deal, then uh you you can&#39;t invest that way. Uh let&#39;s see, another Baba question. China, I mean, literally waiting for GDAU every year, same time. Uh hi Tom, quick question regarding Nike. When would you consider to buy with enough margin of safety? I think now uh we&#39;re not doing it because we think we have a better play on the consumer discretionary, but yeah, have at it for the long term. You&#39;ll be fine. Um, thanks for the free information you provide. Want to ask your uh estate ladder. It&#39;s above the current levels. I&#39;ll leave it at that. They&#39;re asking about fair value. Luke Jovik, anything changed? We covered that in the article about advanced auto parts and tariffs. So, you can review that. Tim D, uh, VF Corp balance sheet, they paid off 1.5 billion of debt. That&#39;s probably not reflected in the numbers that you&#39;re looking at yet. Max Payne, VIX at plus 50. What do you think about buying puts? Um, you&#39;re obviously new. Don L, do you actually agree with tariff calculations? Uh, no. That was done by Rardo Navaro. David Martin, can you take a look at Skyworks Solutions? Okay, that one is uh definitely worth looking at. SWKS. Okay. So, it&#39;s down about 2/3. Cash flows come down a bit. Revenues have come down a bit. See what the balance sheet looks like. Yeah, I think there&#39;s going to be opportunities in semis. We&#39;re playing it through Intel because we like Lip Banan. Okay, so they got some cash. They&#39;ve got some Where&#39;s the debt? Yeah, balance sheet&#39;s good. Let&#39;s take a look at free cash flow. Pretty good. Look at share issuance coming down. All right. So now just help me understand where they are in the cycle. Okay, so they got China business. Question is how much China business? Uh how do they compare to their competitors? Uh I think this one&#39;s worth doing some work on. So good find. Nothing to say. That&#39;s just worth start starting to do your work on and doing your competitive analysis and uh starting to drill down. Eric Haney, thoughts on Campbell? I think we covered this a few weeks ago and took a pass. It&#39;s a defensive. I mean, yeah, if you want to make 20% over the next two years, you probably get a bounce from 35. Uh, but not an exciting business for me. Higher and better uses of cash. John Webster. John, in environments like this, just buy the stock. Don&#39;t play around with that. Um, Phillip Ranska, Ze Davis. No, I don&#39;t. That&#39;s a messed up business. I I mean, it&#39;s not for me. Jimmy Jones, Baba Holder. Okay, next one. Zivco, caner, Canazerki. Uh, no. I would not consider Brown Foreman over Dagio, but it probably works. If they if one works, they&#39;re both going to work. Uh, great time and all your thanks for the great content I mentioned to all my friends when discussing investment affiliated. Oh, so here&#39;s a guy that bought a couple weeks ago and he doesn&#39;t have dry powder. Just wait it out. If you bought good businesses at good price, it doesn&#39;t matter if you bought Boeing at 150 or 140. Uh just just sit tight. You&#39;re fine. David Muinx, that&#39;s being greedy. Pigs get slaughtered. You&#39;re not going to get the exact bottom dollar. Just relax. You got good businesses at good prices. Just hang tight and in six months, you&#39;re going to be very, very happy. David Muinx, uh you think JX JHX would be a good investment for the upcoming home boom? JHX. Uh probably wind up being a target for QXO to buy. JHX. I&#39;d rather just play QXO. You&#39;re not going to get a better operator. And if this is at all a good business, Brad Jacobs will buy it. Um I think you&#39;re probably Let&#39;s see. description cement siding. Let&#39;s take a look balance sheet cash. All right. So, they&#39;re a little bit levered, but generally okay. Yeah, this looks pretty good. So, just just start studying their competitive advantage. Listen to eight or nine conference calls, start the process. But I think this is generally pretty good. Are you going to get the perfect price? I mean, yeah, 21. If you could get it at 18, would that be better than 21? Sure. Does it really matter? If you find that your anal after you&#39;ve done the analysis, you&#39;re comfortable with the business, I think you&#39;re probably okay in this range for the long term, that&#39;s a nice find. Um, and that&#39;s it. So,\n\nBrown Foreman over Dagio, but it probably works. If they if one works, they're both going to work.

Um I think you're probably Let's see. description cement siding. Let's take a look balance sheet [Music] cash. All right. So, they're a little bit levered, but generally okay.

If you find that your anal after you've done the analysis, you're comfortable with the business, I think you're probably okay in this range for the long term, that's a nice find. Um, and that's it. So, with that said , I'll be on Fox Business tomorrow morning. Tune in if you're free. Uh, we'll be back next week, same time, same place. And just hang tight. Know what you own. Look under the surface. Look at the balance sheet. Look at the free cash flow. Look at the mode of the business.

      "day, the market&#39;s going to be up 2 3,000 points on the Dow just like we saw on um Wednesday. Okay? So, you can&#39;t be too cute. If you can buy businesses like Boeing around $150 here, it doesn&#39;t matter when you think three years out and the market&#39;s back at new highs and Boeing&#39;s at $250 uh or Disney at $85 when it&#39;s at $150, not five months from now, but you know, 12 months from now, uh is certainly realistic. So, you just you can&#39;t be too cute. And and the best thing you can do is when you&#39;re at lows like this is put whatever money you plan on putting to work, put it to work, and then just go away and forget about it for six months. When you wake up, the market will be recovered. It&#39;ll be back towards new highs and we&#39;ll be And in this case, it&#39;s kind of interesting because I hate to even compare it. What I&#39;m trying to do is set you up for the worst case scenario. Plan for the worst and expect the best because the 2011 European debt crisis and the great financial crisis and the tech wreck were a function of years of excess buildup. Okay, the tech wreck was you know five, six, seven years. So it took three, four years to work through. The European debt crisis was decades of excess debt buildup and it took years to work uh you know time to work through. Um the great financial crisis, years of excess buildup. We don&#39;t really have that right now. You could say well it&#39;s been years of an unfair deal since World War II because we allowed them to tariff us more in an effort to rebuild the world after World War II. Well, news flash, the world has been rebuilt for 50 plus years. Okay, it only took a couple of decades after World War II to do that. So why do we still have an unfair uh generous setup? So there&#39;s a movement to normalize that whether through currency, whether through tariffs, it&#39;s fundamentally the same thing, which is why the Chinese devalued the yuan immediately uh prior to the tariffs to offset the impact of some of them. Uh unfortunately, they couldn&#39;t devalue their currency 145%. So, uh, so that the idea is to bring them to the table. Um, so I think this is kind of the worstc case scenario where you bumble around August, September, you know, two full months finding a bottom up, everyone&#39;s excited, back down to the lows, everyone&#39;s despondent, up, everyone&#39;s excited, back down to the lows. I think most of the pain is in even if you marginally retest. Most people are trained that you will get a retest, which is why I&#39;m staying open-minded for the possibility that t",
      "buy VF VF Corp for $10 or $15 or Boeing at $130 or 150, it simply won&#39;t matter. Either way, you&#39;ll be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways. This sort of mentality, whether you call it ice in the veins or lack of the FOMO gene, boils down to one of our favorite concepts here at Great Hill Capital, zooming out despite all the fear, uncertainty, and running around like it&#39;s the end of the world. You&#39;ll notice this barely shows up on a long-term chart. It&#39;s nothing more than a blip on the radar. This week, we thought it would be a good time to for yet another Great Hill Capital Maxim burdening ourselves with the facts. That is on a company by company basis, looking at their tariff perception versus reality. Now with the tariff pause in effect, we can happily say one, those year-to- date year-to-ate peak to trough draw downs look a lot different and two the actual tariff exposure is now much lower. What you&#39;ll see is that in every case the short-term stock uh pullbacks far outweigh the actual risk. In some cases, tariffs might not even be be ending they might up end up being a net beneficiary within the 90-day pause. Those sell-offs now look downright silly. Nevertheless, let&#39;s burn ourselves with some facts here. Stanley Black &amp; Decker doing the same overshot shoot it did in 2001. Perception is the business will do uh terrible due to tariffs. Reality unless you believe someone is going to suddenly build a factor in the middle of Ohio and pose a legitimate competitive threat in the tool industry. This is nothing more than a one-off price increase. There are four major players in Stanley Black &amp; Decker has the least exposure to China 18% and one of the largest domestic footprints manufacturing more than 40% of its sales in the United States for nearly a decade. Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been shifting away from China and has been building its tariff playbook over the past 12 months with the least exposure to China industrywide. We could actually see a scenario where Stanley Black &amp; Decker gains market share through competitive pricing. At the end of the day, this is a leveraged arms dealer play on the housing market recovery. Uh tariffs don&#39;t change the fact that the US is short nearly 4 million housing units. They don&#39;t change the peak 30 to 39 US demographics and they certainly don&#39;t change the fact that DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley and Black &amp; Decker are industryleading tool companies that have been trusted for generations. So you can go through this. How are we on time? Yes. So Boeing, same story. Go through this article. He did a good job of actually highlighting what the CEOs said about tariffs on recent calls. Same with Baxter. And you can see the dimminimus, uh, VFC Corp, GenerRack. These are just a handful of names we&#39;ve discussed in past podcasts. Advanced Auto Parts, Alibaba, etc. You know, one of the things that&#39;s been circulating this week is about delisting again, the risk of the Trump Organization doing that.

You had this violent move up, then a back test back to uh that level. Then a V rally up, then a marginal new lows in October and then straight back up uh which would be you know back over the 200 day which would be back to 5,800 on the S&amp;P.

      "day, the market&#39;s going to be up 2 3,000 points on the Dow just like we saw on um Wednesday. Okay? So, you can&#39;t be too cute. If you can buy businesses like Boeing around $150 here, it doesn&#39;t matter when you think three years out and the market&#39;s back at new highs and Boeing&#39;s at $250 uh or Disney at $85 when it&#39;s at $150, not five months from now, but you know, 12 months from now, uh is certainly realistic. So, you just you can&#39;t be too cute. And and the best thing you can do is when you&#39;re at lows like this is put whatever money you plan on putting to work, put it to work, and then just go away and forget about it for six months. When you wake up, the market will be recovered. It&#39;ll be back towards new highs and we&#39;ll be And in this case, it&#39;s kind of interesting because I hate to even compare it. What I&#39;m trying to do is set you up for the worst case scenario. Plan for the worst and expect the best because the 2011 European debt crisis and the great financial crisis and the tech wreck were a function of years of excess buildup. Okay, the tech wreck was you know five, six, seven years. So it took three, four years to work through. The European debt crisis was decades of excess debt buildup and it took years to work uh you know time to work through. Um the great financial crisis, years of excess buildup. We don&#39;t really have that right now. You could say well it&#39;s been years of an unfair deal since World War II because we allowed them to tariff us more in an effort to rebuild the world after World War II. Well, news flash, the world has been rebuilt for 50 plus years. Okay, it only took a couple of decades after World War II to do that. So why do we still have an unfair uh generous setup? So there&#39;s a movement to normalize that whether through currency, whether through tariffs, it&#39;s fundamentally the same thing, which is why the Chinese devalued the yuan immediately uh prior to the tariffs to offset the impact of some of them. Uh unfortunately, they couldn&#39;t devalue their currency 145%. So, uh, so that the idea is to bring them to the table. Um, so I think this is kind of the worstc case scenario where you bumble around August, September, you know, two full months finding a bottom up, everyone&#39;s excited, back down to the lows, everyone&#39;s despondent, up, everyone&#39;s excited, back down to the lows. I think most of the pain is in even if you marginally retest. Most people are trained that you will get a retest, which is why I&#39;m staying open-minded for the possibility that t"
