[0.64s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.72s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.48s] 286th video cast podcast for the week
[8.16s] ending, April 10th, 2025. Uh we&#39;ll start
[11.84s] with family first, then get down to
[13.2s] media as always. First and foremost, we
[16.48s] had Annabelle absolutely crushing it
[19.279s] this week. She had um uh competed in the
[23.76s] first 1001st far westerns championship
[26.32s] in Northern California, securing the
[28.16s] high point award for the ten and
[30.32s] undergirl. She concluded her shortc
[31.84s] course season as the number one ranked
[33.44s] ten and undergirl n national nationally
[35.36s] in the 100 freestyle 56.6 seconds 100
[38.879s] backstroke
[40.2s] 102.93 and 50 free
[43.399s] 52496. Additionally, she&#39;s top 10 U girl
[46.879s] for the 2025 shortc course season in
[49.12s] Southern California swimming heading
[50.96s] into long course season. She leads the
[52.719s] nation number one 10U rankings. So, it&#39;s
[55.28s] going to be an exciting long course
[56.719s] season to see where she can finish her
[58.559s] 10U career. So, really proud all the
[61.199s] hard work paying off. Uh moving along,
[64.239s] we had uh took Mimi out for dinner at uh
[68.4s] a restaurant in Crystal Cove in Newport
[71.28s] Beach. Highly recommend. Absolutely
[73.28s] spectacular. had ocean views. This uh
[75.92s] was meant for the pod charts, but want
[77.6s] to cover it. This is from Ken Fiser,
[80.88s] kind of drawing analoges to the
[83.4s] 1998 kind of uh abrupt correction,
[87.92s] bounceback, retest, and then recover.
[89.92s] We&#39;re going to cover a number of
[91.759s] different analoges in this week&#39;s
[93.84s] podcast to get a sense of when we can
[96.88s] expect to recover and then work out to
[98.56s] new highs. I mean, that&#39;s really the
[100.079s] name of the game. Uh here&#39;s some of the
[101.68s] merch that came in. I bought some
[103.119s] samples. Love the stuff, the hoodies,
[105.52s] everything else. We&#39;re going to start
[106.72s] doing that in coming weeks. Uh this is
[109.04s] some of your fellow
[111.2s] um Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes
[114.04s] podcast followers and uh they&#39;ve done an
[117.6s] unbelievable job. Um they received the
[122.799s] Burden Yourself with the facts Great
[124.96s] Hill Capital hats. Two out of the 10
[126.96s] people who won them actually sent in
[129.399s] photos. That&#39;s Kidney Pop. uh goes by
[132.879s] Michael out of Australia and that&#39;s
[135.36s] Allan Wall out of Pennsylvania. Uh he
[138.8s] came up to visit me in Ridgefield when
[140.959s] he was in town uh Connecticut which was
[143.04s] pretty exciting. Then we&#39;re going to get
[144.879s] down to the media got uh BBC had me on
[149.28s] the fly uh after Trump tweeted um that
[154.72s] he was going to pause the tariffs. So, I
[157.2s] want to thank Marian Mosheri and Janie
[160.8s] Wall for for thinking of me and having
[162.64s] me on. We&#39;re going to listen in here in
[164.319s] Delmore there. Well, let&#39;s cross live to
[167.04s] New York again and this time speak to
[168.72s] Thomas Hayes, chairman at Great Hill
[171.04s] Capital. Thomas, it&#39;s so good to talk to
[172.64s] you. Um, I I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re seeing
[174.959s] what the markets are doing. You&#39;ve seen
[176.72s] what President Trump has said. Give me
[178.8s] your reaction. Well, this is an absolute
[181.84s] gamecher, Miriam. And you know there had
[184.0s] been a lot of fear in the market the
[185.84s] last few days. People were comparing
[187.36s] this to the great financial crisis to
[189.68s] the tech wreck. And the difference
[191.84s] between this and those two crises that
[194.48s] took years to work out was this was
[197.04s] man-made. So it could be fixed in a day.
[199.92s] And that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re seeing
[201.68s] today. And the beauty of President
[203.68s] Trump&#39;s strategy and what he&#39;s done
[205.599s] throughout his years is he escalates in
[209.04s] order to deescalate. So now we we had a
[212.799s] big ask and now we&#39;re down to 10%. The
[215.599s] 10% across the board looks like nothing
[217.92s] and everyone is relieved and in effect
[220.319s] that is a big accomplishment in and goes
[222.879s] a long way to balancing trade and and
[225.92s] people now look at that as a very very
[228.48s] low bar. So they&#39;ll negotiate over the
[230.799s] next 90 days. The key that the markets
[233.12s] love is there&#39;s some rationality in the
[235.68s] room. People people generally believe
[238.48s] the concept makes sense. Maybe they
[240.64s] weren&#39;t in accordance with the
[242.599s] execution. Uh, however, now we have have
[245.599s] the relief valve and when it rains gold,
[248.959s] pull out the bucket, not the thimble.
[250.64s] There are things to buy. Yes,
[252.56s] absolutely. Thomas, tell me this though.
[255.04s] You know, some people are saying that
[257.919s] this is America blinking. We&#39;ve heard in
[260.32s] the last hour or so from the Treasury
[262.32s] Secretary, uh, Mr. Bessant, who said
[264.479s] this was his strategy all along. you
[267.199s] kind of feel to me like you&#39;re saying
[268.96s] possibly this is what the states the
[271.199s] America wanted from the outset but even
[274.24s] if this is an amazing clever ploy to get
[277.12s] that 10% running along all those
[279.56s] countries surely the markets don&#39;t like
[282.56s] this level of kind of you know going up
[285.04s] going down pushing pulling not knowing
[286.639s] where you stand that can&#39;t be good for
[288.24s] anyone or anything on the out there
[291.44s] yeah I&#39;ve had more fun weeks in my
[293.28s] investing career I can tell you that
[294.88s] right now but I can say One thing, it
[297.52s] shows a level of good faith. We&#39;ve got a
[299.68s] win that we&#39;re getting some imbalances
[301.84s] fixed. The negotiations will probably go
[304.08s] on longer than 90 days and hopefully at
[306.639s] some point we&#39;ll get get them on the
[309.12s] phone uh between the US and China and
[311.44s] start to chip away at some level of
[314.72s] balance and then the market can go back
[316.72s] to focusing on what? Focusing on
[318.8s] earnings, focusing on cash flow,
[320.96s] focusing on growth, focusing on
[322.88s] employment and all those things have
[324.24s] been pretty good. uh people were just
[326.32s] starting to extrapolate if we stayed in
[328.32s] this frozen period for too long would it
[331.44s] put us into a recession and now that
[333.12s] we&#39;ve unfrozen it and we&#39;re going back
[335.52s] to good faith negotiations I think the
[337.36s] market likes it and now companies can
[339.039s] start to make decisions again we just
[341.039s] had some reaction from the uh future
[343.44s] German chancellor German chancellor
[344.88s] designignate Mertz who said Europeans
[347.12s] are united on defending ourselves and
[349.039s] this shows that approach works best
[351.36s] everyone&#39;s going to be claiming victory
[352.8s] tonight aren&#39;t they well that&#39;s the
[355.12s] whole thing. If everyone can save face
[357.759s] and you know a great deal is when no one
[359.919s] is perfectly happy and everyone saves
[361.919s] face. And if that&#39;s the case today, then
[364.16s] today is a celebration. Let&#39;s get back
[365.919s] to business. Let&#39;s get back to trade. If
[368.319s] there&#39;s some imbalances that are going
[369.68s] to be normalized over the next 90 days,
[372.08s] let&#39;s get that done and let&#39;s focus on
[373.919s] growing and prosperity. But what about
[375.6s] the 125% tariffs on China? That&#39;s kind
[378.08s] of a fly in your ointment there. And you
[379.68s] know, China has backed itself into a
[381.44s] corner, Thomas, right? How does it get
[383.039s] out?
[384.639s] Well, there is that. But I think at some
[387.6s] point cooler heads will prevail prevail.
[390.479s] The signal is that if you&#39;re willing to
[393.12s] come to the table, we have a rational
[395.6s] administration that is willing to talk
[398.0s] and there will be some way for both
[400.16s] sides to save face and begin a dialogue.
[402.8s] Will it be tonight? Probably not. Will
[405.199s] it be a week from now? We don&#39;t know.
[407.199s] But I would assume within the next
[409.52s] couple of weeks, three, four weeks, uh
[412.4s] the t the dialogue will begin and no one
[415.36s] will be happy with the ultimate outcome.
[417.6s] They&#39;ll meet somewhere in the middle and
[419.36s] things will progress as planned. Okay.
[421.599s] Well, Thomas, it&#39;s great to talk to you.
[423.039s] Thanks so much for taking the time to
[424.4s] speak to us on BBC News. Thank you so
[427.28s] much. Well, let&#39;s talk a little bit more
[429.52s] now about that 125% announcement on
[432.96s] tariffs on China. Let&#39;s speak to Scott
[434.4s] Kennedy, trustee chair in Chinese
[436.4s] business and economics at the Center for
[438.4s] Strategic and International Studies.
[440.4s] Scott, good to talk to you. Um, I know
[442.96s] that we&#39;ve only just heard this news of
[445.039s] this 125% tariff on Chinese goods, but
[448.4s] you know, the numbers are pretty much
[450.24s] just numbers. There&#39;s a direction of
[452.24s] travel here that we&#39;re seeing. How
[453.84s] worried are you about that?
[456.319s] Well, the numbers have already gotten so
[458.56s] high. Uh, it really doesn&#39;t matter if
[460.56s] they go up anymore. uh US China
[462.96s] bilateral trade
[465.36s] and we&#39;re back and then I had the
[467.52s] pleasure to join Stu Vney also on the
[470.56s] fly uh this week on Friday in the midst
[474.08s] of the chaos want to thank as always
[477.36s] Christian Dagger and Stuart Vanney will
[481.44s] listen in here repeating this Trump said
[484.16s] on Truth Social quote just had a very
[486.479s] productive call with the general
[488.0s] secretary of the Communist Party of
[489.52s] Vietnam who told me that Vietnam wants
[492.319s] to cut their tariffs down to zero if
[494.8s] they&#39;re able to make an agreement with
[496.479s] the US. I thanked him on behalf of our
[499.199s] country and I said I look forward to a
[501.039s] meeting in the near future. End quote.
[502.72s] I&#39;d call that a positive. President
[504.479s] Trump also commented on Fed Chair Jerome
[507.12s] Powell. Trump says quote this would be a
[509.84s] perfect time for the Fed chairman Jerome
[512.08s] Powell to cut interest rates. He&#39;s
[514.479s] always late, but he could now change his
[516.88s] image and quickly. Energy prices are
[519.44s] down, interest rates are down, inflation
[521.44s] is down, even eggs are down 69% and jobs
[524.32s] are up all within two months. A big win
[527.04s] for America. Cut interest rates, Jerome.
[529.76s] And stop playing politics. Okay, perfect
[532.8s] time to bring in Tom Hayes. He joins us
[534.88s] on the phone. If Powell did cut rates
[538.32s] and the f the Fed funds futures market
[541.279s] thinks we&#39;re going to get five rate cuts
[543.68s] this year, would that help the market?
[547.44s] There&#39;s no question about it. He could
[548.88s] put a floor in the market today if he
[550.56s] wanted to. And Donald Trump is
[552.0s] absolutely right. You know, the stock
[553.68s] market is holding a buy one get one free
[556.48s] sale today and everyone&#39;s running out of
[558.72s] the store. Capitulation is in the air,
[561.279s] Steu. And I think selective buying is in
[563.839s] order. So we got You&#39;d like to see
[567.32s] Powell cut rates today. And if he did,
[570.88s] you think we&#39;d be off to the races?
[573.44s] Yeah, he put a floor in 100%. He&#39;s not
[576.24s] going to do it today. But if he can
[577.92s] change his tone and say we are aware of
[581.44s] what&#39;s happening as it relates to policy
[583.68s] and we stand ready to act, that is the
[587.44s] message he needs to give to the market.
[588.959s] If he wants to be a vulker-like figure
[591.04s] in the world and be remembered, he needs
[593.44s] to step up right now and stand in and
[596.24s] say, &quot;We&#39;re standing behind the United
[598.08s] States. We&#39;re standing behind the
[599.44s] policy. We stand ready to act.&quot; Donald
[602.0s] Trump is 100% right on this. We&#39;ve been
[604.399s] on this program. We&#39;ve been looking at
[606.0s] all the different sectors of the market.
[608.0s] Almost all of them are down. It&#39;s pretty
[610.0s] much across the board. But do you have a
[612.72s] particular sector that you think would
[614.88s] be a good place to put some money right
[616.88s] now?
[618.399s] Yes. The silver lining of this is
[620.8s] interest rates are coming down. The
[622.48s] 10-year yield below 4%. I had a friend
[625.04s] who got a 7-year adjustable rate
[628.079s] mortgage yesterday at 5.1%.
[631.36s] There is a huge amount of pent up demand
[633.76s] from 80 million millennials aged 34 35
[637.04s] years old. As mortgage rates, the
[639.12s] 30-year fix comes below six. It is going
[641.44s] to be a frenzy out there. Donald Trump
[643.6s] is opening up. We&#39;ve got 500 million
[645.839s] acres of federal land. They&#39;re going to
[647.44s] start building homes. PY will provide
[649.68s] your starter home and you get an
[651.2s] endangered elk in your backyard free of
[653.44s] charge. The game is on. So, here&#39;s what
[656.16s] what we&#39;re looking at. Brad Jacobs is a
[658.56s] money maker for shareholders. He&#39;s got a
[660.56s] a building supply rollup called
[663.399s] QXO. QXO just bought Beacon Roofing.
[667.04s] This guy is a money maker. He did XBO
[669.12s] Logistics. If you put in a million
[670.88s] dollars with him in 2009, it&#39;s $160
[674.72s] million last year, 160 Bagger. If you
[677.6s] did a million dollars with him in United
[679.76s] Rentals, URI, in 1997 when he got
[682.56s] involved, it&#39;s worth 89 million today.
[685.92s] He&#39;s a money maker. And this is this is
[688.079s] one of the few times you can get in on
[689.76s] the ground floor with Brad Jacobs with
[691.6s] QXO is getting I got I got to go but QXO
[695.519s] I shall remember that and it is down 3%
[697.839s] today but we&#39;ll listen to you Tom Hayes.
[699.76s] Thanks for joining us Tom. Appreciate
[701.04s] it. Good stuff.
[703.279s] And we&#39;re back. And then I want to thank
[706.64s] Preston Meiselle who included me in his
[710.079s] article on Fox Business uh about buying
[714.0s] high quality during the storm. Check
[716.64s] that out. Preston has moved from
[718.399s] producing over to being a journalist,
[720.959s] doing an unbelievable job. So, follow
[722.64s] Preston Meiselle over at Fox Business.
[725.12s] If you have any breaking stories and
[726.8s] scoops, he&#39;s your guy. Uh, and then I
[729.68s] want to thank Maria Anik and Moren
[732.639s] Sackle for having me on CNBC Indonesia
[735.76s] yesterday. Talked all about markets.
[738.0s] This was like a 15minute interview. I
[740.079s] wasn&#39;t able to record it and what they
[741.68s] posted was six minutes of it, which is
[743.44s] still pretty good. You can watch that on
[745.36s] your own. Now, let&#39;s get down to
[747.519s] business. Uh, first and foremost, uh, we
[750.72s] did a very special clientonly webinar
[754.72s] this Monday and had a replay on Tuesday
[758.279s] exclusively private content for clients.
[761.12s] And I was really happy about that
[762.639s] because so many of you took advantage of
[764.639s] the opportunity. We went position by
[766.8s] position and not just talking charts and
[769.279s] uh uh cursory fundamentals but actually
[771.76s] digging into the fundamentals of each
[773.839s] business balance sheet, income
[775.44s] statement, cash flow statement and so
[777.6s] many of you saw the opportunity to reup
[780.48s] and add into the weakness. So, I want to
[783.36s] acknowledge um the one so far and
[786.959s] obviously you can see there&#39;s going to
[788.32s] be opportunity here uh uh to add, but um
[793.279s] most of you have already taken
[794.72s] advantage. Awesome job, Frank, Jim, Joe,
[797.92s] of course, Brad, Marlin, uh, and then
[802.16s] new people that have come in for our
[805.0s] Q2 2025 opening taking advantage of this
[808.959s] opportunity of a lifetime, which is
[811.12s] really what it&#39;s created, this man-made
[812.959s] uh, situation, which we&#39;re going to get
[814.48s] into. Jim, Sharon, Alex, R.J., Kim,
[817.76s] Travis, Kevin, and more that are
[820.72s] finishing up their applications in time
[822.88s] to get in before the 12th. We are going
[824.959s] to close out for this quarter on
[826.88s] Saturday. So, if you&#39;re interested in
[829.04s] coming in at the smaller account size, 1
[830.88s] million and above, you should reach out
[833.2s] tonight. Uh otherwise, uh potentially we
[836.72s] will open as we try to each quarter for
[839.36s] small accounts three or four months from
[841.36s] now. But I do not think the pricing is
[843.68s] going to be as attractive as it is right
[845.279s] now for sure. Uh and those that are 5
[848.639s] million plus, we offer bespoke service
[850.639s] at your pleasure. Uh let&#39;s go through
[853.519s] some of the charts here. So this was the
[855.48s] daily. You know, it was interesting. Uh
[858.639s] one of the things that I&#39;m going to
[859.76s] cover, I&#39;ll be on Fox Business tomorrow
[861.68s] morning on Varnian Co. at 9:45
[866.199s] a.m. And this is one of the few
[870.16s] correction environments that I&#39;ve ever
[872.48s] seen where retail investors
[876.48s] uh are more confident meaning in the
[879.199s] market taking advantage of the
[880.72s] opportunities and professionals are
[882.959s] scared out of their pants. And um I&#39;m
[886.24s] seeing it across the board. The
[887.839s] professionals hedge funds are record
[889.92s] selling in the hole after the crash. Uh
[892.8s] retail investors are actually starting
[894.72s] to buy pretty aggressively. And here&#39;s
[897.68s] the news, ladies and gentlemen. Uh
[900.48s] retail investors have mostly been right
[903.12s] since co obviously the ones chasing
[905.36s] shiny objects got smoked uh in 2001. The
[908.88s] ones chasing shiny objects etc. But the
[911.279s] ones that have been buying the dips,
[913.199s] high quality stuff for the long term
[914.959s] have really really done well. and it&#39;s
[917.199s] reflected in the numbers uh in um
[922.399s] uh in the numbers uh since COVID. So,
[924.56s] kudos for those of you taking advantage
[926.8s] on the buy 1 get one free sales rather
[929.04s] than running out of the store, actually
[930.8s] running into the store. And I know it
[933.04s] hasn&#39;t been easy. I&#39;ve had more fun
[934.959s] weeks in my career. That&#39;s for sure. But
[937.839s] you also have to recognize
[940.36s] that, you know, it&#39;s cliche in a way,
[943.6s] but when it rains gold, you got to pull
[945.12s] out the bucket, not the thimble. Uh it&#39;s
[947.68s] not willy-nilly. And I, you know, my
[950.56s] clients had really an incredible
[952.56s] opportunity to see that on Monday and
[954.519s] Tuesday. It&#39;s not like, oh, the market&#39;s
[957.839s] down, let&#39;s just buy. It&#39;s dissecting
[961.519s] each individual business and what will
[963.68s] be the impact of tariffs. And in most of
[965.92s] the cases with the businesses uh as you
[968.959s] dug into the fi fundamentals and how
[971.36s] they&#39;ve positioned themselves through
[972.8s] deleveraging through free free cash flow
[976.0s] through um all the things that they&#39;ve
[979.199s] set up even if it got really bad what
[982.72s] winds up is they wind up coming out of
[985.12s] this situation with more share not less
[989.12s] share. So that is going to be a major
[991.839s] factor moving forward and we&#39;re going to
[993.519s] talk about that today. Uh this is
[996.88s] interesting because today there was a
[999.519s] level of dis
[1001.0s] despondency that um we have not seen in
[1004.8s] a long time. And I thought it was kind
[1007.199s] of interesting
[1008.68s] because yesterday everyone was excited.
[1011.759s] And I don&#39;t spend a lot of time on
[1014.24s] charts and that type of thing, but when
[1017.759s] you
[1018.839s] see fundamentals completely thrown out
[1021.6s] of the window and no longer having any
[1024.16s] bearing, you have to go a little bit to
[1026.079s] the technicals and that just comes from
[1029.0s] experience. And uh I sent this to a
[1031.6s] friend who was having a little bit of a
[1032.799s] tough time, smart guy, and uh he&#39;s he
[1035.6s] always winds up on the right side uh of
[1037.919s] everything. But when he sent when I sent
[1040.48s] this to him, I said, &quot;Look, I don&#39;t do a
[1042.4s] lot of technical analysis, so don&#39;t go
[1044.16s] sending this around that Tom Hayes is
[1045.839s] now looking at charts for his uh uh key
[1049.08s] uh you know, moves to to move ahead.&quot;
[1052.08s] But, you know, last time I checked, this
[1053.6s] looked like a pretty solid double
[1055.039s] bottom. Um, this is on only on a
[1057.28s] 60-minute chart, so you know, time will
[1059.52s] tell. But, you know, that was Friday and
[1061.28s] then you got the rally up and then you
[1063.679s] got the wipe out and then finally you
[1065.44s] got the huge rally yesterday when Trump
[1068.24s] said this is a good time to buy stocks.
[1070.559s] We&#39;re going to pause the tariffs and
[1072.24s] then today you gave a little back. That
[1074.0s] should be expected. Why? Because you had
[1076.559s] a lot of people that had to buy quickly
[1078.64s] or cover quickly and then you just test
[1081.2s] them out, make sure they&#39;re serious. And
[1083.28s] we my sense is we would work higher, but
[1086.32s] I&#39;m going to go through some some
[1088.24s] different things at this point. You
[1090.24s] know, we&#39;re less concerned about the
[1092.08s] indices generally than we are about the
[1094.64s] businesses that we own. Here&#39;s on a
[1096.799s] daily basis. This gives you an idea. So,
[1098.96s] you did cover all of these lows, take
[1101.76s] these out. This kind of held up. Little
[1103.84s] bit of indecision today. I could see
[1106.16s] some consolidation for a while, maybe
[1108.24s] staying within this candle here, and
[1110.64s] then we work up over time.
[1113.36s] um you know these are even on the weekly
[1116.0s] could it you know we discussed last week
[1117.6s] could it push down to 450 it could I
[1120.24s] think we saw where the Trump put is
[1122.16s] certainly as it relates to the bond
[1123.6s] market I think that also has to do with
[1125.44s] equities and then as if you uh step back
[1129.44s] and you see these type of situations
[1131.6s] after big draw downs like
[1134.679s] 2022 you rally and then you get these
[1137.12s] checkbacks here uh like we&#39;re seeing now
[1140.64s] like you saw in 2004 for like you saw in
[1143.44s] 2011. And speaking of 2011, we are going
[1146.559s] to discuss that. What you can see here
[1149.84s] in 2011 is it looks like you know a
[1152.72s] month or two, this is a monthly chart of
[1155.28s] of some uh consolidation and then you
[1158.08s] just rallied and and continued the
[1159.84s] trend. Uh that was actually three full
[1163.679s] months of consolidation. So we&#39;re going
[1165.679s] to look at that as a possible analog as
[1167.679s] well. Uh but the key is once the primary
[1170.799s] pain was in in the short term even
[1173.039s] though you bounced around for two and a
[1174.72s] half months uh you didn&#39;t really make
[1176.96s] you made marginal new lows but but over
[1179.84s] time you know if you if you blinked went
[1181.76s] on vacation four months later the market
[1183.76s] was recovered six months later you were
[1185.52s] at new highs and off to the races. So
[1187.919s] you know when I say and we went into it
[1190.48s] whether you buy Boeing at 130 or 150
[1193.679s] it&#39;s not going to make a difference in
[1194.88s] the long term when it&#39;s a $300 stock.
[1197.36s] Uh, everyone likes to get the perfect
[1198.799s] bottom and the perfect top. It&#39;s just uh
[1201.039s] not perfectly realistic. So, what do you
[1202.799s] do? You buy a little more on red days.
[1205.44s] You you uh and then when it gets
[1207.28s] extremely overvalued, you take it off in
[1209.36s] tanches and and uh same thing over and
[1211.76s] over. So, this was 2011. And the reason
[1214.32s] I bring this one up, I&#39;m going to see if
[1217.76s] I can run these side by
[1223.48s] side just so you can get an idea here.
[1232.559s] Okay, I can. What do you know? All
[1236.44s] right.
[1242.52s] So, if you look here, this is
[1246.52s] 2011 and this is 2025.
[1253.159s] Um, so you had some real strength from
[1257.12s] the recent lows about a year
[1263.0s] earlier and then you kind of had this
[1265.12s] warning shot in July and then you
[1267.84s] rallied into August and then it was just
[1270.08s] a complete fall off the cliff uh in late
[1273.28s] July through early August and you
[1276.559s] basically put in the lows. You had this
[1278.559s] violent move up, then a back test back
[1281.12s] to uh that level. Then a V rally up,
[1284.48s] then a marginal new lows in October and
[1286.96s] then straight back up uh which would be
[1289.84s] you know back over the 200 day which
[1291.6s] would be back to 5,800 on the S&amp;P. Uh
[1294.88s] and then you chopped around and then
[1296.64s] finally you broke out to new highs and
[1298.4s] beyond. uh which was
[1300.6s] basically you know August so
[1303.64s] 84
[1306.84s] by
[1308.76s] January so five months after the crash 5
[1313.52s] months after the crash you were at new
[1315.52s] highs again so I think you had a similar
[1319.28s] situation in 2010 by the way this was
[1321.6s] the European debt crisis uh you just
[1324.559s] basically chopped around like crazy
[1326.32s] until Mario Draghi stepped in and said,
[1329.96s] uh, we&#39;ll do whatever it takes to quiet
[1333.28s] the bond vigilantes. And and it&#39;s it&#39;s
[1335.679s] similar. You know, you&#39;re seeing yields
[1337.6s] move out a little bit this week. Uh,
[1341.2s] there&#39;s something called the basis
[1342.559s] trade, which we&#39;ll touch on, unwinding.
[1344.48s] It&#39;s just a uh a complicated way to
[1347.36s] explain hedge funds taking stupid
[1349.039s] amounts of leverage all at once in a
[1351.2s] very crowded trade for basically picking
[1353.919s] up pennies in front of a steamroller.
[1355.6s] And this week, they got steamrolled. So,
[1357.2s] they&#39;re all getting margin calls. Many
[1359.039s] funds are liquidating and blowing up
[1360.799s] because they run on leverage uh and um
[1364.32s] betting on quote unquote sure bets that
[1366.64s] when they blow up, they blow up for
[1368.08s] everyone. So, that&#39;s what this is and
[1370.0s] that&#39;s what the European debt crisis was
[1371.84s] all about in 2011.
[1374.24s] So, while it&#39;s perfectly sensible that
[1378.72s] we could rally immediately, if what
[1383.36s] here&#39;s what you don&#39;t want to do, ladies
[1384.799s] and
[1386.52s] gentlemen, okay, so let&#39;s say you put in
[1389.36s] money here because the market went up
[1391.2s] like this week. Okay, you had your
[1393.2s] crash, you had your violent rally, you
[1395.039s] had your
[1396.52s] um uh massive breath in one day and then
[1401.2s] you buy
[1402.28s] here and then it goes up a little more
[1404.799s] and you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I was really
[1406.32s] smart. I bought right at the bottom and
[1408.24s] then it goes back down and tests and
[1410.159s] then it goes back above the recent high
[1412.24s] and then it goes down and test and now
[1414.08s] it looks like you&#39;re making higher highs
[1415.44s] and higher lows and all the technicians
[1416.72s] are like the bottom is in. We&#39;re making
[1418.799s] we&#39;re in an uptrend. we&#39;re making higher
[1420.559s] highs and higher lows, which is load of
[1422.24s] And uh and then you get this high.
[1425.039s] You&#39;re like, &quot;Here we go. We&#39;re going to
[1426.32s] quote unquote break out.&quot; And then you
[1427.919s] make marginal lows. You not only retest,
[1430.799s] you know, in this case would be 481. In
[1432.559s] that case was 850, but you break down.
[1435.919s] And that&#39;s when everyone says, &quot;Oh my
[1437.28s] god, we&#39;re going back to the great
[1438.48s] financial crisis lows. The Europe Euro
[1440.72s] Union is going to break apart.&quot; And then
[1442.96s] boom, take them all out. Marginal low
[1445.84s] straight up back over. another test to
[1448.96s] scare the be Jesus out of everyone and
[1450.88s] then off to new highs and all of this
[1452.88s] noise is happening in five months which
[1455.679s] in the scheme of things is a blink of
[1457.44s] the eye and um but in the real terms
[1460.96s] look this last week felt like an
[1463.039s] eternity you know for for a prof you
[1465.44s] know I said to someone I said this is an
[1467.36s] absolute walk in the park okay at some
[1470.159s] point whether it&#39;s tomorrow or three
[1474.159s] months from now and we went through this
[1476.4s] with clients on Monday and
[1478.84s] Tuesday, you&#39;re going to wake up and
[1480.88s] there&#39;s going to be a phone call and
[1483.12s] there&#39;s going to, excuse me, there&#39;s
[1484.48s] going to be a truth and it&#39;s going to
[1486.0s] say, &quot;I just got off the phone with my
[1488.24s] friend Xi Jinping. We had a good
[1490.679s] conversation. They&#39;re desperate for a
[1492.799s] deal. We&#39;re making progress. He&#39;s coming
[1494.96s] to Mara Lago or whatever.&quot; And that day,
[1497.36s] the market&#39;s going to be up 2 3,000
[1499.44s] points on the Dow just like we saw on um
[1504.559s] Wednesday. Okay? So, you can&#39;t be too
[1507.6s] cute. If you can buy businesses like
[1509.76s] Boeing around $150 here, it doesn&#39;t
[1512.88s] matter when you think three years out
[1514.799s] and the market&#39;s back at new highs and
[1516.24s] Boeing&#39;s at $250 uh or Disney at $85
[1520.48s] when it&#39;s at $150, not five months from
[1523.44s] now, but you know, 12 months from now,
[1526.08s] uh is certainly realistic. So, you just
[1528.96s] you can&#39;t be too cute. And and the best
[1531.2s] thing you can do is when you&#39;re at lows
[1533.279s] like this is put whatever money you plan
[1535.76s] on putting to work, put it to work, and
[1537.6s] then just go away and forget about it
[1539.84s] for six months. When you wake up, the
[1542.159s] market will be recovered. It&#39;ll be back
[1544.0s] towards new highs and we&#39;ll be And in
[1546.32s] this case, it&#39;s kind of interesting
[1549.96s] because I hate to even compare it. What
[1552.799s] I&#39;m trying to do is set you up for the
[1555.2s] worst case scenario. Plan for the worst
[1557.919s] and expect the best
[1560.039s] because the 2011 European debt crisis
[1564.799s] and the great financial crisis and the
[1566.64s] tech wreck were a function of years of
[1571.36s] excess buildup. Okay, the tech wreck was
[1574.08s] you know five, six, seven years. So it
[1575.44s] took three, four years to work through.
[1577.679s] The European debt crisis was decades of
[1580.4s] excess debt buildup and it took years to
[1583.2s] work uh you know time to work through.
[1586.559s] Um the great financial crisis, years of
[1589.52s] excess buildup. We don&#39;t really have
[1592.08s] that right now. You could say well it&#39;s
[1594.0s] been years of an unfair deal since World
[1596.4s] War II because we allowed them to tariff
[1599.12s] us more in an effort to rebuild the
[1601.2s] world after World War II. Well, news
[1603.52s] flash, the world has been rebuilt for 50
[1605.919s] plus years. Okay, it only took a couple
[1608.0s] of decades after World War II to do
[1609.76s] that. So why do we still have an unfair
[1612.799s] uh generous setup? So there&#39;s a movement
[1615.2s] to normalize that whether through
[1617.039s] currency, whether through tariffs, it&#39;s
[1618.96s] fundamentally the same thing, which is
[1620.559s] why the Chinese devalued the yuan
[1623.12s] immediately uh prior to the tariffs to
[1626.32s] offset the impact of some of them. Uh
[1628.559s] unfortunately, they couldn&#39;t devalue
[1630.24s] their currency 145%. So, uh, so that the
[1634.4s] idea is to bring them to the table. Um,
[1637.679s] so I think this is kind of the worstc
[1639.52s] case scenario where you bumble around
[1641.52s] August, September, you know, two full
[1644.32s] months finding a bottom up, everyone&#39;s
[1646.64s] excited, back down to the lows,
[1648.64s] everyone&#39;s despondent, up, everyone&#39;s
[1650.559s] excited, back down to the lows. I think
[1652.64s] most of the pain is in even if you
[1654.799s] marginally
[1656.84s] retest. Most people are trained that you
[1660.96s] will get a retest, which is why I&#39;m
[1662.799s] staying open-minded for the possibility
[1665.12s] that there is no retest. And we wake up
[1667.84s] sooner rather than later with many deals
[1671.12s] starting to hit the tape. And once we
[1672.88s] see many deals starting to hit the tape,
[1674.96s] whether it&#39;s days, weeks, or months,
[1676.64s] they got 75 people to talk to.
[1678.48s] Obviously, China&#39;s the most important
[1679.84s] one.
[1682.559s] if they start dialogue with China, we go
[1685.279s] up huge and we go up very very fast.
[1687.76s] Which is why those of you who are in
[1688.96s] were really smart to jump in this week.
[1691.12s] Couples couple of you um stragglers will
[1694.24s] come in by Saturday. And some of you
[1696.08s] that want to add money to your accounts,
[1697.76s] you want to want to be doing that.
[1700.12s] Um you&#39;re not going to get many
[1702.96s] opportunities in a career to to buy the
[1705.12s] businesses we&#39;re buying at the prices
[1706.48s] we&#39;re buying it. Um so so that&#39;s that.
[1710.72s] Um so this in my view is the worst case
[1714.08s] scenario to mentally prepare yourself
[1715.76s] which is not really a big deal. It just
[1718.159s] three you know two three months longer
[1720.0s] to get to recovery and then to new highs
[1723.12s] which in the scheme of things is
[1724.559s] nothing. And be open-minded to this
[1727.12s] could could whiplash really really fast
[1729.84s] and and rebound quicker than everyone
[1731.919s] anyone expects. That would be the best
[1734.08s] case scenario what everyone&#39;s looking
[1735.44s] for. uh worst case scenario is something
[1738.0s] like that. But either in the scheme of
[1739.6s] things, when you look back in 12 months,
[1741.52s] if you pounced when everyone else was in
[1743.36s] fear, you are going to pat yourself on
[1745.2s] the back and you&#39;re going to be so proud
[1746.32s] of yourself. So again, look, all this is
[1748.72s] opinion, not advice. All you can do is
[1750.48s] play probabilities in this business.
[1752.0s] There&#39;s no guarantees of anything. But I
[1754.159s] will guarantee you one thing. If you buy
[1755.919s] great businesses at good prices, good
[1758.0s] things happen over the long term. So um
[1760.96s] that that&#39;s really how you how you do
[1762.88s] it. Um uh so let&#39;s go through some
[1765.679s] indicators just to give you another
[1767.039s] sense of whether it&#39;s going to take
[1769.12s] three months or if it&#39;s going to take
[1770.32s] three days. Again, no one knows. But
[1772.48s] some of the indicators can give us wash
[1774.48s] out looks like the equity put call ratio
[1776.88s] 10day moving average. Uh NYSC 10% volume
[1781.72s] index. So look, a lot of these are
[1784.36s] washed and
[1787.32s] um
[1788.919s] NASDAQ uh declining issues kind of
[1791.52s] peaking here.
[1793.84s] uh NASDAQ Cohen high low index you know
[1796.96s] these are times if you bought you made
[1799.039s] money doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s guaranteed
[1801.2s] to be that way prospectively but your
[1803.84s] odds are favored real estate completely
[1806.08s] oversold stocks above the uh 200 day
[1808.559s] emerging market exponential moving
[1811.279s] average material stocks same thing
[1813.44s] washed out uh healthc care stocks washed
[1816.48s] out so you&#39;re seeing it uh small S&amp;P
[1821.039s] midcap intermediate term volume momentum
[1823.72s] oscillator. You know, they&#39;re all
[1826.159s] pointing to you&#39;re closer to the bottom
[1828.399s] than you you&#39;re much closer to the
[1829.919s] bottom than you are to the top. PM model
[1831.919s] by all washed out again by DJ J Dow
[1835.679s] Jones washed out again by S&amp;P 500. You
[1839.52s] know, percentage of S&amp;P stocks on a PMO
[1843.279s] crossover, which is just basically a
[1846.12s] 5200 day moving average crossover.
[1849.6s] uh at five now it&#39;s it&#39;s from 4% to 10%.
[1853.52s] You know if you buy on these
[1855.799s] 5% these are highly correlated with big
[1860.159s] big- time bottoms going all the way back
[1863.039s] you know 10 plus years. So could this
[1865.36s] time be different? Yeah.
[1867.159s] But I
[1869.799s] I you know, we bought a lot of stock
[1872.88s] because we had a lot of new clients come
[1874.72s] in, a lot of existing clients re up on
[1877.679s] Monday and
[1879.08s] Tuesday.
[1881.88s] Um, and if it, you know, if we did that
[1886.24s] worst case scenario where we&#39;re bouncing
[1888.159s] around with high volatility on every
[1889.84s] single deal headline for the next three
[1893.159s] months, I wouldn&#39;t trade that. I I would
[1896.559s] rather deal with that volatility and get
[1899.12s] in at the prices that we did than miss
[1902.24s] it thinking I was gonna bottom tick the
[1904.88s] exact perfect
[1906.519s] bottom and risk waking up to a truth or
[1912.48s] a tweet that says I just got off the
[1914.24s] phone with Xi Jinping and you missed the
[1916.799s] the whole entire opportunity of a
[1918.799s] lifetime. So,
[1922.12s] um, you know, I was pretty, you know,
[1925.36s] it&#39;s funny. I was on that call and I
[1926.799s] said, I&#39;ve never asked anyone to invest
[1928.799s] with me ever. Uh, I&#39;ve never done a
[1931.2s] presentation like, &quot;This is great Hill
[1932.64s] Capital. This is why you should invest,
[1934.08s] blah, blah, blah.&quot; I&#39;ve never even
[1935.519s] reached out to clients and said, &quot;Now&#39;s
[1937.279s] the time to add a lot of money.&quot; Uh,
[1941.12s] Monday and Tuesday were really, really
[1942.72s] the first two times when I said, &quot;This
[1944.399s] would be a good time.&quot; If you if you had
[1946.48s] been thinking about adding and you had
[1948.159s] dry powder, this was the time to go. And
[1950.559s] this still is this week. And maybe next
[1953.039s] maybe next week will be better. I don&#39;t
[1955.36s] I I really don&#39;t think so. Maybe on a
[1957.679s] company by company
[1959.72s] basis, but I think most of the pain is
[1962.64s] in whether we retest or not or just
[1964.799s] undercut a little bit. We&#39;ve done a lot
[1966.32s] of undercuts here. So I I feel like that
[1968.399s] game is up. But you can&#39;t
[1971.799s] know because what&#39;s happening now is not
[1974.96s] a function of normal
[1976.84s] economic conditions or excess is working
[1980.32s] through where you could handicap it.
[1981.84s] It&#39;s a question of game theory of who&#39;s
[1985.2s] going to pick up the phone first and is
[1986.799s] the deal going to be good and is it
[1988.24s] going to be bad and does it take one day
[1989.84s] to get a deal? does it take, you know,
[1991.84s] one month to get a deal and we don&#39;t
[1993.44s] know. And that&#39;s why I say, you know,
[1995.519s] the 2011 it took three months to work
[1998.08s] out until they just stepped in and said,
[1999.799s] &quot;Nomas.&quot; Um, and then other view things
[2003.36s] like COVID, uh, you know, I put that
[2005.519s] article in, uh, was quoted in Market
[2007.6s] Watch on March 21st. I said, I don&#39;t
[2009.36s] know if this is the bottom, but the
[2010.559s] Dow&#39;s down 35%
[2012.64s] uh, or 33%. It was down 35% in 1918 with
[2016.08s] the Spanish flu. We are buying
[2017.84s] highquality companies right now. were
[2020.0s] going in the market and it went lower
[2021.36s] for two days uh and then they stepped in
[2024.24s] and backs stop the cor corporate credit
[2025.76s] market. They may have to step into backs
[2028.64s] stop the treasury market with this basis
[2030.559s] trade unwind and some of the foreign
[2032.64s] sellers. And by the way, negotiating
[2035.76s] with foreign counterparties when your
[2037.6s] bond market is weak uh is like uh you
[2040.72s] know trying to win a buttkicking contest
[2043.279s] with one leg tied behind your back. It&#39;s
[2045.44s] just not very effective. So, um, the
[2048.24s] real power move would be we&#39;ve taken 2
[2051.599s] trillion plus off the balance sheet, Fed
[2054.96s] balance sheet. Just get in the market. I
[2057.359s] mean, I know the auctions have gone well
[2058.96s] this week, but you know, get in the
[2060.8s] market and say, look, bond vigilantes,
[2062.96s] you remember a guy named Mario Draghi in
[2065.159s] 2011. Don&#39;t mess with us. We are going
[2067.52s] to be in the market sapping everything
[2069.04s] up. You want to short it, we&#39;re going to
[2070.399s] rip your face off. and then let Trump
[2072.8s] call Xi and say you want to negotiate
[2075.04s] now as he would say Emma Emma ether so
[2078.8s] you know or however he does it uh that
[2081.599s] would be a powerful you know the Fed
[2083.599s] Federal Reserve is not a a global entity
[2086.639s] this was created by the US Congress and
[2088.56s] if they&#39;re not st backstopping our
[2091.28s] credit markets when we need it when
[2093.119s] we&#39;re trying to
[2095.32s] uh normalize imbalances that we allowed
[2099.599s] in an effort to rebuild the world uh we
[2102.48s] effectively lent our goodwill in
[2104.88s] exchange for one day taking some of that
[2107.2s] back. So you know whether it&#39;s 10% or
[2110.28s] 12% you know it&#39;s certainly not 145%.
[2113.44s] That&#39;s just to get people to the table.
[2114.88s] So take the hint come to the table. Uh
[2117.52s] but I think we need to go from a
[2118.88s] position of strength and that position
[2120.16s] of strength is a uh strong bond market.
[2122.88s] And uh even if Powell doesn&#39;t want to
[2125.28s] cut uh he&#39;s been too restrictive, but
[2128.88s] even if he doesn&#39;t want to cut, he
[2130.079s] should be in saying we got the we got
[2132.079s] the Treasury market bond vigilantes have
[2134.64s] at it. You you want to sell in the hole,
[2136.72s] we&#39;ll take every single p piece of paper
[2138.56s] you have and good luck with that. And
[2140.72s] then you go negotiate with these
[2142.16s] countries and it gets done in a day.
[2143.599s] Once they can&#39;t bully you around by
[2145.119s] dumping treasuries, they gota they gotta
[2147.119s] they gotta buckle because they need
[2148.88s] access to our markets. Uh S&amp;P talk about
[2152.079s] attention. S&amp;P 500 bullish percent.
[2155.76s] Okay. So, you
[2157.24s] know, don&#39;t buy here. You know, this is
[2159.68s] when we were buying in the hole in
[2160.96s] October 2022 when we bought Google,
[2163.68s] Amazon, etc. No one wanted them.
[2167.04s] Indicators like these are pretty good
[2168.48s] tells. In COVID, it went down to two,
[2170.4s] you know, 1.4. But even if you had
[2172.48s] bought when it was at 11 where it is
[2174.72s] today 2019 the last by the way you know
[2178.88s] 2011 is a good analogy fine but 2018 is
[2182.4s] also a really good analogy with the
[2183.839s] tariffs and it looks very similar and
[2187.119s] that one was much more of a V. Okay. And
[2190.48s] you had the S&amp;P
[2193.079s] 500 bullish percent index drop down
[2196.0s] below, you know, 15 13, which is, you
[2199.119s] know, where we got down to 12 uh on on
[2202.8s] Wednesday before the tweet by now. Love
[2206.04s] DJT. Uh, and you did get an abrupt
[2209.04s] recovery.
[2211.4s] So, be open-minded that it&#39;s going to
[2214.0s] happen very quick. And if the train
[2215.44s] leaves the station without you, it did
[2217.28s] it never let you in until COVID. So
[2219.119s] unless you&#39;re betting, you know, if you
[2221.52s] took
[2222.359s] advantage during this period that I&#39;m
[2224.8s] talking about now, buying the right
[2226.4s] companies at the right time, unless
[2228.96s] you&#39;re going to wind up with
[2230.44s] another pandemic two years from now, it
[2233.04s] probably doesn&#39;t let you in for many,
[2234.56s] many years. Uh, and that&#39;s why I held
[2236.88s] that special call and that&#39;s why so many
[2238.8s] of you took advantage once you looked
[2240.72s] under the hood and got a sense, got a a
[2243.839s] you know, I think a lot a lot of you
[2245.52s] were shocked. you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, I
[2247.76s] didn&#39;t, you know, I listen to all your
[2249.76s] podcasts. I&#39;ve learned so much, but I
[2251.119s] had no
[2253.0s] idea the next level.&quot; And and that was
[2256.52s] again 10 or 15% of what we do here. So,
[2261.64s] um, anyway, I&#39;m glad that was helpful
[2264.079s] and I&#39;m glad a lot of you took advantage
[2265.76s] of it and some some more of you will
[2267.839s] take advantage. I got two more funding
[2270.24s] tomorrow and hopefully one you know a
[2272.32s] hand who knows how many before Saturday
[2275.44s] uh for new and uh for existing you just
[2278.64s] want to do it when you can provided uh
[2281.44s] days are still red. Maybe next week you
[2283.2s] get lucky. Maybe you couldn&#39;t do it this
[2284.64s] week. Next week you get lucky and we
[2286.079s] retest the lows. That would be a good
[2288.0s] day to do it, ladies and gentlemen. Uh
[2290.16s] but right now, you know, looking at this
[2293.16s] stuff, let&#39;s see if this double bottom
[2296.16s] can&#39;t even believe I&#39;m saying these
[2297.44s] words. uh double bottom holds. Uh and uh
[2302.0s] that might be it because god forbid you
[2304.64s] get a tweet over the weekend. Uh and you
[2308.079s] wind up with instead of the 2011 3 month
[2310.96s] scenario, you wind up with the 2018
[2314.0s] which is more Trump-like. That was the
[2316.16s] last tariff thing and it&#39;s already hap
[2319.2s] you know it&#39;s it&#39;s done you know and uh
[2322.88s] uh because there&#39;s only one call that
[2324.32s] matters and everyone knows that it&#39;s the
[2325.76s] one with
[2328.04s] Xiinping. All right where are we? Mlelen
[2332.56s] oscillator again I&#39;m you know I&#39;m just
[2334.4s] visualizing I&#39;m showing you the things
[2336.88s] there&#39;s no certainties in anything but
[2339.599s] you can weigh the probabilities in your
[2341.76s] favor and that&#39;s all you can do. Even
[2343.44s] this is now getting overstretched. Uh,
[2346.4s] which is kind of a cyclical thing that&#39;s
[2348.079s] pretty pretty worth following. This is
[2350.16s] the Elliot wave pattern.
[2352.92s] Again, VIX came off the boil 55 52. Uh,
[2359.28s] did you get that in 2018? You got uh
[2363.72s] 36.
[2367.96s] So, let&#39;s see what it was in 2011.
[2378.359s] 48. Okay. So, you know,
[2382.04s] 2011,
[2384.04s] 2018, this was more about tariffs. So,
[2386.8s] that&#39;s kind of interesting. But, uh, so,
[2389.119s] so those are kind of some analoges to
[2390.88s] keep in mind, you know, but you look at
[2392.56s] the businesses, the these are
[2394.8s] ridiculous. These are people getting
[2396.48s] force liquidated.
[2398.52s] uh you know, we&#39;ll cover some of these
[2402.16s] names, but you know, you look at Nike,
[2404.32s] you don&#39;t have to think super hard about
[2406.079s] these. Yeah, it&#39;ll take some time and
[2408.0s] yeah, you got the tariffs and yeah,
[2409.96s] look, if you believe that tariffs are
[2412.48s] going to stay at
[2414.359s] 145%.
[2417.079s] Um, I got a bridge to sell you. I mean,
[2420.32s] it&#39;s just some things can&#39;t sustain.
[2422.32s] It&#39;s just, you know, it&#39;s kind of like
[2423.52s] when we were going through COVID with
[2424.88s] with uh Xi. Xi can take a lot more pain
[2427.28s] than anyone assumed, but sooner or later
[2429.359s] they all flip when the pressure becomes
[2430.88s] acute. And I got to assume that uh he&#39;s
[2434.56s] not exactly on solid ground given how he
[2437.28s] ran the COVID show. So, uh he was almost
[2440.88s] out last year before he flipped the
[2442.64s] switch overnight and uh went from
[2444.96s] crackdown to stimulus. Uh he had no
[2448.16s] choice and and they they haven&#39;t fully
[2450.4s] recovered. they&#39;re only starting their
[2451.76s] recovery. So, the last thing they want
[2453.04s] is flashbacks of this guy causing them
[2455.119s] economic pain. Uh so, my guess is he&#39;s
[2457.76s] going to come to the table and do a fair
[2459.359s] deal and they&#39;ll find a way for everyone
[2461.04s] to save face. Uh or, you know, he&#39;s
[2464.16s] going to really run a risk of um of how
[2467.2s] long he stays in that position and uh uh
[2471.359s] the hundred families that control the
[2472.88s] country will have something to say about
[2474.24s] that. So, let&#39;s see. But you look at
[2477.2s] Chevron, you look at Merc. I mean, these
[2478.72s] are businesses that you don&#39;t get at 40%
[2482.4s] off, 50% off, 70% off. Dow,
[2488.119s] Disney, J&amp;J. I
[2490.92s] mean,
[2492.52s] Intel. Yeah. I I mean it&#39;s if you&#39;re not
[2496.72s] buying these type of businesses, I&#39;m not
[2498.88s] telling you to
[2500.119s] buy, you know, the most risky things in
[2503.04s] the market, but but that type of stuff
[2504.64s] during periods like this, PayPal with
[2507.52s] all the cash reg Yeah, they&#39;re saying,
[2509.2s] &quot;What if Europe shuts down all the
[2511.68s] processors in in Europe?&quot; I mean, all
[2514.72s] these things can happen, but the the
[2517.119s] world only ends once and and if it ends
[2519.52s] this time, you the last thing you&#39;re
[2521.04s] worried about is your stocks. Okay? So,
[2523.119s] if you want to hedge, get a gun, get
[2525.28s] some canned food, but I wouldn&#39;t be
[2527.119s] selling your stocks because your stocks
[2528.96s] aren&#39;t going to matter if it comes down
[2530.319s] to guns and canned food. So, I&#39;ll leave
[2532.48s] it at that.
[2535.56s] Um, you know, some of these could
[2538.88s] arguably get a lower multiple, go down
[2541.2s] lower, but uh there are enough of them
[2544.079s] that it makes sense, even if you&#39;re
[2546.079s] wrong about the bottom of the market, to
[2547.52s] be adding. Uh, and
[2551.24s] um, that&#39;s that. But here&#39;s another
[2553.76s] thing that not a lot of people are
[2555.52s] paying attention to. Uh, the odds of a
[2558.4s] May cut have gone up and the odds of a
[2561.44s] June cut are 90, you know,
[2564.2s] 92%. So that&#39;s there&#39;s that. Uh,
[2568.24s] sentiment is, as we know, washed out.
[2570.319s] quote of the week, which is the the
[2572.24s] basic framework for Great Hill Capital.
[2574.8s] Great investment opportunities come
[2576.16s] around when excellent companies are
[2577.839s] surrounded by unusual circumstances that
[2580.48s] cause the stock to be misappraised.
[2584.16s] That&#39;s Warren Buffett, the man, the
[2586.16s] myth, the legend. Seth Clarin, the
[2588.16s] greatest edge an investor can have is a
[2590.24s] long-term orientation. Uh that needs to
[2593.44s] be coupled with low leverage. Okay,
[2596.0s] there you you know what you&#39;re seeing
[2597.92s] here were people running one and two and
[2600.16s] three and four and five and in some
[2602.0s] cases 100 times leverage on the on the
[2606.839s] um on some of the bond trades.
[2611.079s] Um generally the greater the stigma or
[2614.16s] revulsion the better the bargain. Uh
[2617.119s] we&#39;ve seen that time and time again.
[2619.76s] Greatest volume trade session of all
[2622.4s] time. So that&#39;s usually indicative of
[2625.2s] full capitulation. This is from
[2627.359s] Strategus. Strong advanced decline
[2629.599s] ratio, strongest since October 2011.
[2633.44s] Well, what did we just cover? The
[2635.359s] similarities to October 2011, which was
[2638.96s] uh actually that was the retest low
[2641.119s] before they started the recovery. So
[2643.359s] something to keep in mind. Again, worst
[2645.92s] case takes three three four months. Uh
[2649.2s] best case it could be immediate like the
[2651.04s] tariffs in uh 2018 which is more kind of
[2654.96s] Trump style.
[2661.56s] Um still a lot of cash on the sidelines.
[2664.56s] Stocks always crash. Worst drops of the
[2666.72s] S&amp;P since 1976. That&#39;s kind of
[2669.28s] interesting. This is, you
[2672.119s] know, pretty normal. The average drop
[2674.8s] every year is 14% according to this you
[2678.56s] know 70 78 14% 79 10% 80 17% 81 18% 82
[2687.28s] these are all intrayear you know 84 13%
[2691.2s] 87 34% 90%
[2695.2s] uh that&#39;s probably a decent analogy uh
[2698.16s] 97 11%
[2701.24s] 1998 19% probably a decent analogy. Uh
[2705.76s] 2001 and two, the tech wreck, you had
[2707.599s] some 20s and a 30. Uh 2003, but you also
[2711.599s] had the terrorist event. Uh 2013,
[2716.359s] 14%. 2008 was the big one. 2009, you had
[2719.76s] another correction. 2011 was a 19% and
[2722.8s] here we are at an 18%. So this is pretty
[2725.04s] normal stuff. You always recover,
[2726.64s] resolve to new highs if you own good
[2728.319s] businesses. top Chinese leaders to meet
[2730.48s] on stimulus after Trump&#39;s tariff shock.
[2732.88s] Net retail purchases way up. They&#39;re
[2735.68s] buying in the whole hedge funds are
[2736.96s] selling and so far they&#39;ve been more
[2738.4s] right than hedge funds since uh
[2741.48s] co this is a great time to buy DJT. Uh
[2745.44s] he&#39;s still right by the way. He is still
[2748.96s] right. That quote came right around here
[2752.56s] or here maybe. Maybe this low. I don&#39;t
[2754.8s] know. I think it was here. So he&#39;s still
[2757.2s] been right. Uh, Mr. Market Timer
[2761.48s] himself. Uh, that&#39;s one guy when he
[2764.8s] calls the bottom, you better listen.
[2766.72s] Navaro, take it with a grain of salt.
[2769.28s] But, um, all right. What else do we have
[2771.76s] here? Biggest one day gain since World
[2773.359s] War
[2774.28s] II. Okay. Big gains tend to lead to much
[2777.76s] higher prices.
[2779.56s] So, this is Ryan Dietrich over at
[2783.359s] Carson. The next day on average tends to
[2786.16s] be down about 7/10en of 1%. That&#39;s
[2790.0s] pretty normal after a big one day rally
[2792.8s] like 9%
[2794.64s] uh that we had yesterday. So we&#39;re down
[2797.44s] what two or two 2% today 3%. So you gave
[2801.359s] back a 25% or a third. Uh 5 days out
[2804.88s] also tends to be down a little bit. Uh a
[2807.44s] month out you&#39;re up 2%. 3 months out
[2809.68s] you&#39;re up 3%. 6 months out you&#39;re up
[2812.48s] 11%. 12 months out, you&#39;re up 27%. So,
[2816.319s] if you own the right businesses, you&#39;re
[2817.68s] up way more than that. If the large
[2820.24s] correction is over, better times are
[2822.0s] likely coming. One one month out, you&#39;re
[2825.2s] at um
[2827.8s] 7.6%, 6 months out, you&#39;re at 25%, 12
[2830.72s] months out, you&#39;re at 30%. Now, keep in
[2832.56s] mind that&#39;s off the lows. So, that might
[2834.319s] be a year an up a year up of uh 5%, but
[2838.319s] you&#39;re up 30% from the lows. So if
[2840.16s] you&#39;re adding money here, you really
[2841.68s] maximize your opportunities. Missing the
[2843.92s] best 10 days of the year can crush
[2845.72s] returns. Uh it shows that
[2848.52s] um on average, you know what you got if
[2851.68s] you were in. So 10% if you missed the 10
[2854.88s] days you were down 12% and you can see
[2857.359s] year by year
[2861.44s] uh biggest VIX percentage declines and
[2864.24s] forward returns. So this is from Charlie
[2866.44s] Blo. Uh one year out, you&#39;re up on
[2870.4s] average 12.5, two years, 27, uh etc.
[2874.0s] Five years 100%. Uh S&amp;P Post biggest
[2877.359s] reversal since the 2008 financial
[2880.359s] crisis. Uh this is kind of funny. Before
[2884.8s] Trump paused the tweets, Goldman had
[2886.96s] them baseline moving to a recession.
[2891.319s] literally 1 hour and 13 minutes later
[2894.4s] they reverted their previous to previous
[2897.92s] non-recession baseline. So in an hour
[2900.16s] they flipped from calling for a
[2901.44s] recession to not calling for a
[2902.72s] recession. And that&#39;s the problem. If
[2904.559s] you&#39;re thinking about when&#39;s the perfect
[2906.079s] time to put money in and you wake up
[2908.4s] Monday and they had a call with G and
[2911.359s] you know the the S&amp;P&#39;s back up to 5,800,
[2914.079s] you kind of miss the opportunity. Uh
[2916.8s] huge. So, um, it&#39;s just worth keeping in
[2920.16s] mind
[2921.319s] CPI and we don&#39;t know if that&#39;s going to
[2924.24s] happen. We can&#39;t know. All we can know
[2925.92s] is are we buying good businesses at good
[2928.079s] prices? Can they become better prices?
[2930.72s] Sure. But over over time, don&#39;t be a
[2933.92s] pig. You know, it&#39;s like like with Doge,
[2936.16s] we say when when you cut the fat, the
[2937.92s] pigs squeal. They also say, you know,
[2942.079s] bulls make money, bears get make money,
[2944.0s] pigs get slaughtered. Don&#39;t be a pig.
[2945.839s] You&#39;re not going to get the exact
[2946.72s] bottom. you&#39;re not going to get the
[2947.76s] exact top, but you&#39;re buying businesses
[2949.04s] with a margin of safety doubles and
[2950.559s] triples over time is what you&#39;re what
[2952.8s] you&#39;re shooting for uh to get a uh
[2956.079s] return that uh that makes you excited.
[2958.88s] Overall, Prime Brook gross versus net.
[2961.76s] So again, hedge funds sold in the hole
[2964.24s] at the exact wrong time. We&#39;re going to
[2966.079s] find that out. Healthcare positioning,
[2968.24s] energy
[2969.72s] positioning, put volume, everyone&#39;s
[2972.0s] buying insurance after the house is
[2973.599s] burned down. High yield spreads going
[2975.839s] out a little bit. Keeping an eye on
[2977.68s] that, but we&#39;ll see if they, you know,
[2980.16s] they got to step in and uh defend the
[2982.96s] market. Earnings per share still going
[2985.2s] up. So, that&#39;s that could change quickly
[2988.48s] if this drags out a lot and we&#39;re going
[2990.88s] to learn a lot during earnings. Uh, but
[2994.559s] um there was some pull forward. So, we
[2996.16s] might get a little bit better earnings
[2997.599s] than expected. The key is going to be
[2999.28s] the guidance and the guidance is going
[3000.72s] to change daybyday and week-by-eek basis
[3002.72s] based on the phone calls that Trump has.
[3004.72s] Global junk bonds extend losses on Trump
[3007.599s] but it&#39;s still again not not anywhere
[3010.24s] close to 2002 levels
[3013.0s] um back to 2023 levels. So we keep an
[3016.48s] eye on
[3018.2s] that call put skew kind of at the
[3021.76s] bottom. This is what you
[3024.04s] see at big bottoms, COVID
[3029.079s] crash, Volmageddon,
[3031.92s] etc. Here&#39;s what&#39;s happened to the
[3033.599s] multiples of the Magnificent Seven
[3035.92s] stocks. So, they&#39;ve come down a lot, but
[3037.92s] you know, some of those could
[3039.04s] potentially come down
[3044.52s] more. Market reaction. So, let&#39;s see.
[3048.4s] forward 12-month return after two
[3051.599s] standard dev
[3053.0s] two oh after the market reaction. So
[3056.16s] 12-month forward return after a similar
[3057.92s] situation to this 59 on COVID 45 on
[3061.28s] great financial crisis 24 on black
[3064.0s] Monday. So it&#39;s just showing you
[3068.64s] uh what happens here. US construction
[3071.68s] spending beats expectations in February.
[3074.72s] That&#39;s interesting. that&#39;s uh helped
[3077.28s] Stanley Black &amp; Decker and
[3080.04s] Generrack and QXO Logistics now QXO
[3084.319s] rather uh Beacon Roofing Europe stocks
[3088.079s] on track for second biggest annual
[3091.64s] inflow.
[3093.319s] Okay. Share of S&amp;P stocks at 52- week
[3096.559s] lows. This is like the October 2022
[3099.04s] lows. Those were actually times I do
[3101.599s] think maybe I&#39;m not entirely accurate. I
[3104.16s] I do think I was pretty aggressive in
[3107.119s] telling people to get in in uh October
[3110.24s] 2022 and then one more time in March of
[3113.559s] 2023. I was pretty aggressive. Usually
[3115.839s] I&#39;m just like, we&#39;re open. Let&#39;s go.
[3117.119s] Let&#39;s buy good businesses. Uh but those
[3119.359s] were I would say this week and uh back
[3123.2s] in October 2022 and then March of 2023
[3125.76s] when we had a retest is when I was
[3127.28s] really really pushing. Uh breath is
[3129.52s] close to capitulation levels. I probably
[3132.24s] hit it. uh equity
[3135.16s] position S&amp;P stocks above 20-day moving
[3139.599s] average again going back to October 2022
[3142.16s] low levels those were buy levels not
[3145.119s] sell levels tariff front running
[3148.079s] contrarian indicator elevated VIX levels
[3150.319s] have historically led to positive
[3151.68s] forward performance so 50 plus
[3155.16s] uh I guess this is 12 month out return
[3158.48s] average
[3159.96s] 32% uh so we just hit that extreme fear.
[3163.119s] This is almost broken off the chart.
[3165.52s] Bill was introduced to make auto loan
[3169.2s] interest tax deductible for US assembled
[3172.359s] vehicles. Uh so that&#39;s a bill
[3174.8s] circulating around Congress. That would
[3176.24s] be huge boon for Cooper Standard.
[3178.48s] Biggest 3-day declines in forward
[3181.4s] returns. So
[3183.96s] again, looking out a
[3186.52s] year, he doesn&#39;t have the averages, but
[3188.96s] they&#39;re all green. Three years, five
[3190.72s] years, etc.
[3192.64s] PE ratios have come
[3194.599s] down. S&amp;P at 18 times, tech at 21 times,
[3199.52s] financials at 14 times, comm services 16
[3202.88s] times, healthcare 16
[3207.24s] times, energy 12
[3209.8s] times, materials 18, utilities 16. So
[3213.44s] yeah, there&#39;s stuff to buy. Uh net
[3216.16s] inflow. Uh here&#39;s the net inflow outflow
[3218.8s] from the southbound stock connect. We
[3221.359s] talked about that last summer. They&#39;ve
[3222.96s] been buying it till the cows come home.
[3224.559s] You can see there southbound buying hits
[3226.8s] record 35 billion Hong Kong
[3231.8s] dollars continues to
[3236.44s] grow. Stocks do well once a new bare
[3239.04s] market starts. One year one month out
[3241.8s] 2.7. Six months out 3.9. 12 months out
[3245.28s] 15. uh 24 months out 27. So you know if
[3248.8s] you burning yourself with the facts and
[3250.96s] you have these stats in front of you uh
[3254.16s] it kind of gives you the riskreward
[3255.92s] parameters and then you have to draw
[3257.28s] your own conclusion. But you know again
[3259.04s] percentage of stocks oversold these were
[3261.28s] times to be a buyer. This is from
[3263.24s] Schroers not a seller. Um all-star
[3267.92s] charts same type thing above their 200
[3270.559s] day moving average.
[3274.8s] aggressive short covering which you saw
[3276.8s] in the middle of COVID. That was such a
[3279.359s] good year for us. It was unbelievable.
[3281.92s] All right, so um Dalio sees US China
[3285.52s] push for yuan deal as part of trade
[3288.2s] relief. Largest southbound connect
[3290.4s] buying ever in Hong Kong. Alibaba and 10
[3292.88s] cents a significant benefactor. That&#39;s
[3294.8s] from Brendan Ahern. China leaders to
[3297.04s] meet on stimulus after Trump&#39;s tariff
[3298.96s] shock. So we&#39;re going to get it both
[3300.8s] ways which is probably why they were
[3302.16s] holding off last year. were like, why
[3303.52s] aren&#39;t they doing stim more
[3306.28s] stimulus? It&#39;s probably a hedge. They
[3308.16s] didn&#39;t want to blow all their stimulus
[3309.28s] and then have Trump come in and kill
[3311.359s] their their recovery. Better to keep it
[3313.52s] low and slow and then once the threat is
[3316.319s] there, then then power it up. Jack&#39;s
[3318.4s] Alibaba cloud visit a sign of support as
[3320.24s] tech giant accelerates adoption of AI.
[3322.559s] Alibaba executive sees explosive growth
[3324.559s] in AI applications in China in 2025.
[3327.119s] Deepseek Alibaba can help China narrow
[3328.96s] gap with US and leading AI models. Uh,
[3332.559s] China state firms pledge to boost share
[3334.64s] purchases in calm markets. Uh, cheapen
[3338.0s] and timu fines are history. That is
[3340.48s] beautiful. Bye-bye pin duo duo. Remember
[3342.72s] we said in
[3345.079s] unsustainable
[3347.88s] or unreliable numbers and certainly
[3352.079s] going to be unsustainable. We&#39;ll see
[3353.44s] about unreliable. Uh, how Alibaba is
[3356.799s] turning into China&#39;s AI powerhouse in a
[3358.64s] school for entrepreneurs. Investors fear
[3361.119s] another big blow up of basis trade as
[3362.96s] treasuries lose haven status. That&#39;s why
[3364.72s] Pal needs to step up and show some
[3366.319s] leadership on that. Uh this and it will
[3368.559s] help us negotiate better deals more
[3370.079s] quickly. This is a great time to buy.
[3371.68s] Tariff pause sparks historic rally. Uh
[3374.72s] US mortgage rates dropped to lowest
[3376.16s] since October, spurring demand. We
[3377.839s] covered that last week. Asian nations
[3379.52s] promise to buy more US gas to win tariff
[3382.48s] relief. This is going to be great for
[3384.0s] comtock in the Hannesville. They&#39;re
[3386.559s] that&#39;s going to be part of their deal.
[3388.079s] Uh give us lower tariffs. will buy every
[3390.319s] ounce of every barrel of
[3393.48s] um every BTU of uh LNG that you can you
[3397.52s] can sell us. Boeing deliveries in March
[3399.44s] jumped by 41%
[3401.68s] uh over a year earlier. So all these
[3403.599s] things are playing out. The fundamentals
[3404.96s] are getting better. Generates targets
[3407.359s] what? Growing data center demand.
[3411.04s] Automakers seek opportunity in the chaos
[3412.88s] of tariff trumps. They&#39;re offering
[3414.64s] employee pricing programs. So incentives
[3416.799s] are going up which will lead to volumes.
[3419.359s] Intel gains on report of joint venture
[3421.44s] deal with Taiwan Semiconductor helping
[3423.76s] them out with their fabs. Hedge funds
[3425.599s] pile up record short bets against stock
[3427.599s] as traders go into self-p protection
[3429.28s] mode selling in the hole. That was
[3431.28s] Monday. That&#39;s when I did my call with a
[3434.0s] private client call
[3436.24s] uh and said now it&#39;s go time. You know,
[3439.2s] get your money in. If you plan on
[3440.559s] getting money, get it to me tomorrow.
[3442.4s] And they did. Uh and really hats off to
[3445.04s] them. Uh hedge funds hit with steepest
[3447.2s] margin. But by the way,
[3451.079s] again, you&#39;re basically at those levels
[3454.24s] where you can still take advantage.
[3460.92s] Um okay, hedge funds hit with
[3463.72s] C. They&#39;re all blowing up from over
[3466.0s] leverage. That&#39;s the name of the game.
[3467.52s] Just never let them take you out on a
[3469.119s] stretcher. That&#39;s just a function of le
[3470.559s] leverage and position size position side
[3473.24s] sizing. If you manage your risk through
[3475.76s] position sizing and you manage your
[3478.4s] leverage to not take massive leverage,
[3480.48s] you just ride through these things. Your
[3482.16s] only risk is mark tomarket. That&#39;s short
[3484.0s] term. That&#39;s noise. If you know what you
[3486.0s] own, you just sit right through it. You
[3487.44s] sit on your hands. You play some golf.
[3489.44s] And you know, if it&#39;s a worst case like
[3491.68s] 2011, you got to sit for 3 months.
[3493.52s] That&#39;s a lot of rounds of golf. uh if
[3495.28s] it&#39;s the best case scenario like 2018,
[3497.76s] you know, in 3 months you&#39;re back up to
[3500.0s] new highs and off the golf course. What
[3501.44s] can I tell you? Uh tariff perception
[3503.52s] versus reality stock market and
[3504.96s] sentiment results. So, uh Jeff did a
[3508.559s] good job uh compiling this and kind of
[3512.72s] showing that
[3515.0s] the
[3516.68s] fear
[3520.04s] of tariffs is greater than the actual
[3522.72s] impact that tariffs will have. So over
[3524.319s] the past couple weeks, tariffs have
[3525.44s] turned Wall Street and frankly the world
[3526.799s] upside down. We saw investors puking out
[3528.96s] of stocks at any price, forced
[3530.24s] liquidations and fear and uncertainty,
[3531.68s] reaching levels not seen since the great
[3533.04s] financial crisis or the tech wreck.
[3534.559s] Here&#39;s the thing. This wasn&#39;t some
[3535.76s] widespread systemic collapse. This was
[3537.599s] entirely man-made self-inflicted. And
[3539.599s] just as quickly as it started, it could
[3541.04s] end with one headline or one uh in Trump
[3543.28s] fashion, one tweet. Sure enough, this
[3545.119s] afternoon, we got one of those tweets.
[3547.599s] Market then ripped higher, posting the
[3549.2s] third biggest single day gain since
[3551.52s] World War II. These past couple weeks
[3553.44s] are exactly the kind of periods I live
[3554.88s] for. When you know what you own and
[3556.24s] understand the business behind the
[3557.28s] ticker, it&#39;s opportunities and
[3558.319s] dislocations like this that make being
[3560.079s] in this business so rewarding. And when
[3561.68s] the those opportunities show up, as
[3563.119s] Buffett would say, uh when it rains
[3565.04s] gold, pull out a bucket, not a thimble.
[3566.799s] This time we skip the bucket. We decided
[3568.48s] on a wheelbarrow. And of course, you&#39;ll
[3570.319s] never perfectly time the bottom. But 12
[3572.0s] months from now, whether you pay uh buy
[3574.0s] VF VF Corp for $10 or $15 or Boeing at
[3576.88s] $130 or 150, it simply won&#39;t matter.
[3579.2s] Either way, you&#39;ll be smiling so wide
[3580.64s] you could eat a banana sideways. This
[3582.0s] sort of mentality, whether you call it
[3583.28s] ice in the veins or lack of the FOMO
[3585.119s] gene, boils down to one of our favorite
[3586.96s] concepts here at Great Hill Capital,
[3589.119s] zooming out despite all the fear,
[3591.2s] uncertainty, and running around like
[3592.64s] it&#39;s the end of the world. You&#39;ll notice
[3594.0s] this barely shows up on a long-term
[3595.599s] chart. It&#39;s nothing more than a blip on
[3598.0s] the radar. This week, we thought it
[3599.839s] would be a good time to for yet another
[3601.76s] Great Hill Capital Maxim burdening
[3603.68s] ourselves with the facts. That is on a
[3605.839s] company by company basis, looking at
[3607.44s] their tariff perception versus reality.
[3609.68s] Now with the tariff pause in effect, we
[3611.52s] can happily say one, those year-to- date
[3614.0s] year-to-ate peak to trough draw downs
[3616.079s] look a lot different and two the actual
[3617.839s] tariff exposure is now much lower. What
[3620.319s] you&#39;ll see is that in every case the
[3622.319s] short-term stock uh pullbacks far
[3625.359s] outweigh the actual risk. In some cases,
[3627.28s] tariffs might not even be be ending they
[3629.359s] might up end up being a net beneficiary
[3632.24s] within the 90-day pause. Those sell-offs
[3634.4s] now look downright silly. Nevertheless,
[3636.88s] let&#39;s burn ourselves with some facts
[3638.319s] here. Stanley Black &amp; Decker doing the
[3640.64s] same overshot shoot it did in
[3642.92s] 2001. Perception is the business will do
[3645.359s] uh terrible due to tariffs. Reality
[3647.04s] unless you believe someone is going to
[3648.24s] suddenly build a factor in the middle of
[3649.839s] Ohio and pose a legitimate competitive
[3652.16s] threat in the tool industry. This is
[3653.599s] nothing more than a one-off price
[3655.599s] increase. There are four major players
[3656.96s] in Stanley Black &amp; Decker has the least
[3658.64s] exposure to China 18% and one of the
[3661.839s] largest domestic footprints
[3663.2s] manufacturing more than 40% of its sales
[3665.839s] in the United States for nearly a
[3667.28s] decade. Stanley Black &amp; Decker has been
[3669.04s] shifting away from China and has been
[3670.72s] building its tariff playbook over the
[3672.559s] past 12 months with the least exposure
[3674.48s] to China industrywide. We could actually
[3676.72s] see a scenario where Stanley Black &amp;
[3678.24s] Decker gains market share through
[3680.24s] competitive pricing. At the end of the
[3681.68s] day, this is a leveraged arms dealer
[3683.28s] play on the housing market recovery. Uh
[3686.72s] tariffs don&#39;t change the fact that the
[3688.48s] US is short nearly 4 million housing
[3690.799s] units. They don&#39;t change the
[3693.079s] peak 30 to 39 US demographics and they
[3696.64s] certainly don&#39;t change the fact that
[3697.76s] DeWalt, Craftsman, Stanley and Black &amp;
[3699.359s] Decker are industryleading tool
[3700.88s] companies that have been trusted for
[3702.52s] generations. So you can go through this.
[3705.76s] How are we on time? Yes. So Boeing, same
[3708.319s] story. Go through this article. He did a
[3710.4s] good job of actually highlighting what
[3713.96s] the CEOs said about tariffs on recent
[3717.44s] calls. Same with Baxter. And you can see
[3719.76s] the dimminimus, uh, VFC
[3722.839s] Corp, GenerRack. These are just a
[3725.28s] handful of names we&#39;ve discussed in past
[3726.88s] podcasts. Advanced Auto Parts, Alibaba,
[3730.799s] etc. You know, one of the things that&#39;s
[3732.4s] been circulating this week is about
[3734.64s] delisting again, the risk of the Trump
[3737.44s] Organization doing that. You know, we&#39;ve
[3739.839s] been going through this, uh, and it was
[3742.319s] a lot more acute in the Biden
[3743.92s] administration.
[3745.599s] um they finally did the PCAOB and it
[3749.04s] effectively got approved through that.
[3751.359s] So whether the new SEC chairman will do
[3753.599s] that or not, uh I would certainly rattle
[3756.799s] that saber if I was the Trump
[3759.079s] administration, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll
[3760.88s] have to execute on it. What do you do if
[3763.44s] you&#39;re super nervous about it? I think
[3766.16s] well, number one, there&#39;s an 8:1
[3768.24s] exchange you can transfer out for Hong
[3770.4s] Kong shares. Just call your broker and
[3772.559s] do that.
[3774.44s] Um, and then you wind up with shares on
[3776.799s] the Hong Kong exchange. Little more
[3779.359s] complicated with the options. Again,
[3781.68s] every time it&#39;s become acute and we
[3784.559s] thought about making the move. We we
[3786.24s] have we have some shares in Hong Kong
[3787.92s] and we have some in the US. Um, it&#39;s
[3791.52s] proven to be false. Uh, I do think it&#39;s
[3795.52s] not been confirmed that if in fact they
[3798.16s] did delist it, you&#39;d wind up with the
[3799.92s] Hong Kong shares or your money back or
[3802.88s] whatever it happens to be. Uh, but
[3804.96s] again, number one, the guy&#39;s not even in
[3806.799s] the seat. Number two, it&#39;s far from
[3809.28s] confirmed. Number three, we get a phone
[3810.72s] call with Xi and Trump in the next week
[3812.96s] and all that stuff is so to knee-jerk
[3815.76s] reaction on this stuff, I think, is uh
[3818.0s] probably not the way to go. But you have
[3819.76s] to be alert and uh, you know,
[3823.52s] more fun. Every day is extra fun uh with
[3826.559s] the new administration, but I think it&#39;s
[3828.24s] going to resolve very nicely for
[3830.0s] everyone else.
[3832.119s] Um and and for the United States, um
[3836.72s] this shows in 2023, this is from Brendan
[3839.599s] Ahern, gross domestic product was about
[3842.88s] 7.8 trillion in China. During the same
[3845.76s] year, China&#39;s exports to the US totaled
[3847.599s] about 500 billion. To determine the
[3849.28s] percentage of China&#39;s GDP represented by
[3852.16s] exports to the US, we can use the f
[3854.079s] following calculation and come up with
[3856.24s] 2.8%
[3858.96s] uh of China&#39;s G GDP is related to US
[3864.319s] exports to the United States. So, you
[3868.16s] know, that gives them some leverage for
[3870.359s] sure. Um, this talks about Southbound
[3873.119s] Connect Cooper Standard. just watched
[3874.72s] the interview I did with Jeff
[3876.68s] Edwards auto sales we had a lot of pull
[3879.039s] forward so that should give them nice
[3880.48s] cash flow in Q1 so that&#39;s an exciting
[3882.48s] way to start Etsy similar story they&#39;re
[3885.119s] beneficiary
[3886.44s] Albamaro GXO logistics so these again
[3890.24s] these are just some of the names
[3891.76s] sentiment washed out uh transports
[3894.799s] earnings revisions last 60 days are
[3897.2s] revised down uh that&#39;s probably one or
[3900.24s] two companies
[3905.359s] Looks like
[3909.4s] NSC. Oh, I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m looking at the
[3911.599s] wrong thing.
[3913.0s] Okay. U United. So, some of the airlines
[3916.24s] downgraded that hurt transports. Uh
[3919.28s] that&#39;s those look like they&#39;re the
[3920.64s] biggest ones. Just the
[3923.24s] airlines. No surprise there. Airlines
[3926.559s] always have problems. Retail earnings uh
[3929.28s] down by 2.06. So again, expectations
[3932.16s] down. Insider buying in Nike about a
[3934.24s] half a million dollars worth. Um se
[3937.44s] inflation came in weaker than expected
[3939.2s] today. So that&#39;s good news from a Fed
[3941.119s] standpoint. Earnings uh season starting
[3943.599s] up. We&#39;ll get some color there. Uh
[3945.76s] expected to grow 7% yearonear. So that&#39;s
[3948.72s] a good thing. Uh and with that, we&#39;re
[3950.799s] going to move on to the ask me anything
[3952.96s] question. So for those of you who want
[3955.039s] to stick around uh and enjoy that
[3956.88s] section, please do. Uh for those of you
[3959.52s] who don&#39;t, we&#39;ll see you next week. Same
[3962.559s] time, same place. In the meantime, uh
[3965.52s] make it a great one. But uh here we go
[3967.359s] with the ask me anything questions.
[3970.079s] Number one comes
[3974.599s] from Jim. Okay. Uh okay, that&#39;s a client
[3979.039s] request. Um yeah, I&#39;ll we will send you
[3982.88s] the information and get on the phone
[3985.039s] with you. Uh see if we can get you in
[3986.799s] before Saturday.
[3988.76s] Uh, okay. Here&#39;s one from another. Let&#39;s
[3992.64s] see.
[3994.44s] Michael
[4000.68s] Schultz. Estee Lauder. We like Estee
[4003.039s] Lauder. Jim
[4009.24s] Richards. Okay, this is about
[4011.72s] delisting. Uh, look, they already did
[4014.72s] the holding foreign companies
[4016.16s] accountable act. They already went
[4017.52s] through that with the PCAOB and passed.
[4020.48s] So if they want to delist it for the
[4022.96s] purpose of a negotiating um leverage
[4028.44s] point, you
[4030.359s] could switch out to Hong Kong shares and
[4033.599s] we may look into that. It&#39;s not
[4035.119s] something we need to do tomorrow
[4036.96s] morning, but um that is an option. I
[4040.96s] get, you know, my experience has been
[4042.88s] just sit
[4043.88s] tight, but if you&#39;re panicked, there&#39;s
[4046.96s] no downside of doing it other than the
[4048.88s] fact that you have just a little better
[4050.24s] liquidity uh in the US. Um, but no real
[4054.48s] issue because the Hong Kong currency is
[4057.0s] pegged. So, that&#39;s your
[4059.88s] hedge. Um, I think a good thing to
[4066.2s] do is check with your broker, get their
[4069.28s] color on it.
[4071.119s] And if you think it makes sense to do
[4073.28s] the switch, I think it&#39;s a few hundred
[4074.72s] bucks, you do it, then you&#39;ll own it in
[4076.799s] Hong Kong, not the end of the world.
[4081.64s] Um, but I generally think, you know,
[4084.24s] every time I just bit my lip and held my
[4086.0s] US shares, they&#39;ve been fine. So, we&#39;ll
[4088.16s] see if we get any more color on that in
[4090.0s] coming days, but at the moment, I&#39;m not
[4092.64s] inclined to knee-jerk do anything uh
[4094.799s] immediately. Michael
[4097.0s] Schultz, EL Trade. Okay, we covered
[4100.52s] that. Next
[4103.239s] one.
[4104.609s] [Music]
[4106.759s] Jessica,
[4108.759s] Hasselfeld. Does Trump actually want the
[4111.12s] US to manufacture textiles? I hope
[4113.839s] that&#39;s not true because that doesn&#39;t
[4115.12s] make sense at all.
[4117.0s] Um I I wish I knew. I mean, I think
[4120.96s] there&#39;s a
[4122.12s] thing circulating
[4125.4s] around
[4127.56s] from what is that comedian&#39;s
[4130.759s] name where he says we want to we want to
[4133.799s] wear Nike sneakers, not sew them, you
[4137.199s] know, we want to
[4138.92s] buy, you know, Apple phones for a,000
[4142.159s] bucks, not 9,000 bucks. I mean I think
[4144.799s] the other way to think about it is
[4146.08s] highest and best use of US intellectual
[4148.239s] and labor capital
[4150.52s] um would be designing
[4154.759s] and overseeing robots not becoming
[4157.679s] robots. Uh it&#39;s something to think
[4159.52s] about. So there&#39;s a blend in there. Um
[4162.56s] Tom, do you have any thoughts on First
[4164.44s] Solar? Uh we&#39;ve covered that a few
[4166.96s] times. It hasn&#39;t come down enough for me
[4168.88s] yet, but I keep my eye on those. They&#39;re
[4170.96s] definitely out of favor. Payton Hops,
[4172.96s] Dollar General. We&#39;ve covered that a
[4174.56s] million times. It&#39;s up from where we
[4176.64s] said generally. Okay. We haven&#39;t done
[4178.48s] anything with it. Um, new nickname Tom
[4182.64s] Iceman Haze. In my field of work, I&#39;m a
[4186.6s] pilot. This is from Caleb
[4189.48s] Lusby. Uh, nothing wrong with turnaround
[4192.159s] Tom. I prefer Iceman Haze. Steady as she
[4194.64s] goes with all the noise and turmoil.
[4197.52s] Great info you share weekly. Thank you.
[4199.52s] looking at Delta and uh Norwegian. Those
[4204.32s] two are best in
[4207.0s] class. The class just happens to take
[4209.679s] the short bus. So,
[4215.159s] uh,
[4227.48s] nh. I think in both of these cases, your
[4230.56s] risk is the balance
[4232.52s] sheet because they both took a huge
[4234.88s] amount of debt
[4237.88s] on during co
[4263.239s] Uh
[4267.719s] liabilities 13 billion in debt. at 3
[4270.239s] billion of
[4278.679s] cash generating three billion in
[4281.719s] cash. I mean, this is probably best in
[4284.48s] class. Do I know if this is the absolute
[4286.4s] bottom or not? I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know. D A
[4293.88s] L. I mean, at 30 bucks, you probably
[4296.4s] definitely want to take a stab. Does it
[4297.92s] matter if you buy it at 30 or
[4302.199s] 35? You&#39;re probably okay here to buy a
[4305.04s] few shares, buy some more at 30. Um,
[4308.159s] it&#39;s not something that I would do, but
[4310.56s] I think your thinking is okay for a
[4314.36s] trade. NCH, I think this is going to
[4317.28s] have more balance sheet issues.
[4330.96s] Looks like they&#39;re recovering a little
[4332.64s] bit on cash flow
[4334.28s] basis. Financial balance
[4342.44s] sheet, cash is 190 million. That seems
[4345.84s] pretty
[4347.56s] light. Number one, you got to make sure
[4349.6s] that&#39;s correct. And debt is 12 billion.
[4351.84s] I I wouldn&#39;t touch it right now. Uh
[4354.96s] refinancing is going to be a little
[4356.159s] harder the next few months
[4358.44s] probably. Lee
[4362.6s] Foster, no question this week as I&#39;m
[4365.84s] away with family in Tener
[4368.92s] Refe. However, I I&#39;m sat here as a Brit
[4373.04s] in my hotel room watching BBC and my jaw
[4376.48s] hit the floor when none other than Tom
[4378.4s] Hayes came on the news. As a follower of
[4381.679s] the podcast, I felt so damn proud. I
[4384.159s] topped it topped off a great day
[4385.6s] following the huge Wednesday rally. Well
[4387.52s] done, sir, and keep up the good work.
[4389.12s] Thank you, Lee. I appreciate that on a
[4390.8s] week like this. Uh, no question about
[4393.199s] it. All right. Uh, Lucas Shan Huber.
[4410.0s] Okay. So, he&#39;s saying tax are going to
[4411.28s] stay high between US and China. If
[4415.12s] you&#39;re certain about that, then, you
[4416.64s] know, I can&#39;t debate you, but um I
[4419.04s] always take the under. Maybe I&#39;ll be
[4420.56s] wrong, but
[4426.679s] uh
[4428.76s] yeah, what I&#39;ve learned in all these
[4431.199s] years of of being in this business is
[4433.84s] the the
[4435.0s] the reality is nearly
[4440.36s] always better than the expectation in
[4443.92s] terms of, you know, fear-based
[4446.0s] expectations. when there&#39;s a lot of
[4447.679s] panic if you take a 12 to 24month view.
[4451.88s] Um so you always
[4455.48s] win betting on upside when it look looks
[4458.239s] darkest. In the short term it can get
[4460.88s] worse than expectations but in if you
[4463.36s] you know looking 12 to 24 months out you
[4466.88s] really can&#39;t go wrong and that&#39;s where
[4468.159s] leverage and and
[4471.4s] uh and risk management come to play.
[4474.52s] Christopher. Okay, we covered that about
[4476.719s] the Chinese stocks again. I mean, I feel
[4478.48s] like I feel like waiting for GDAU. Like,
[4480.8s] every year there&#39;s three weeks where I
[4482.96s] got to deal with is BABA going to get
[4485.04s] delisted, is BABA going to get delisted?
[4486.96s] And every year it&#39;s like no one knows,
[4490.56s] but probably not. But if you&#39;re worried,
[4494.0s] go transfer your shares to Hong Kong. Uh
[4497.36s] Bob
[4498.36s] Smith, it&#39;s so funny. Earlier this year,
[4501.28s] I was going to transfer all of my Hong
[4503.04s] Kong shares back to US and I was just
[4506.96s] like, nah, I don&#39;t want to pay the fee.
[4508.64s] It&#39;s it it makes no real difference. So,
[4511.28s] maybe I&#39;ll be transferring more to Hong
[4512.719s] Kong. I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m going to see how
[4514.159s] this settles out. Talk to some people. I
[4516.32s] think even if they did it, you wind up
[4517.92s] with Hong Kong shares or cash anyway and
[4520.0s] then you can go buy it in Hong Kong, but
[4521.679s] check with your brokers. Bob Smith.
[4525.8s] Uh, okay. So that&#39;s that more on the
[4529.6s] same
[4531.0s] question. Phillip, what&#39;s your take on
[4534.0s] the 10-year yield bounce? China dumping
[4536.8s] for
[4537.88s] selling. We covered that earlier. Basis
[4541.56s] trade.
[4545.64s] Um, it&#39;s not a rotation. Should you be
[4548.52s] concerned? Look, the market&#39;s concerned.
[4550.8s] That&#39;s priced in. Eventually, if it gets
[4553.679s] bad, the Fed will have to intervene. The
[4555.92s] good news is they have a lot of dry
[4557.52s] power to powder to do so. It&#39;s not our
[4559.92s] base case. I think people just got
[4561.44s] caught off sides this week and that&#39;s
[4562.88s] just the way it works when you run run
[4564.4s] too much leverage. Thanks for all the
[4566.239s] great work. Someday people will have you
[4567.52s] on the Mount Rushmore of investing. I
[4569.92s] certainly will. Best Phipe. Thank you
[4571.6s] very much, Phipe. I appreciate that,
[4573.679s] especially uh on weeks like this. All
[4576.8s] right.
[4580.04s] Uh oh, this is interesting from uh PB
[4583.84s] Kelly. Thank you for your continued hard
[4586.239s] work. I remember being in Europe on a
[4588.239s] family trip in 2008 when the market was
[4590.32s] tanking. I was concerned that my father,
[4592.4s] who was in the investment business,
[4593.76s] might be in a foul mood or maybe even
[4595.92s] want to cut the trip short and head
[4597.52s] home. I was surprised when I got to
[4599.52s] breakfast one morning and he was in high
[4601.44s] spirits. I asked him why he was so happy
[4603.36s] and he said, quote, &quot;It&#39;s times like
[4605.44s] these when stocks return to their
[4607.28s] rightful owners. We are going to end up
[4609.84s] owning some of the great businesses out
[4611.92s] of this mess.&quot; End quote. I love the
[4614.64s] information you provide. Please keep it
[4616.159s] up. I think that&#39;s probably the quote of
[4618.56s] the week, maybe the quote of the year.
[4620.719s] Uh it is times like these when stocks
[4623.76s] return to their rightful owners. The
[4625.6s] cowboys and the shiny object followers
[4627.52s] are all flushed and people who do the
[4630.159s] work and know what they own are the
[4631.84s] buyers at these levels and then they lay
[4634.159s] them off in a year, two years, three
[4636.159s] years when the shiny object FOMO people
[4638.32s] are back and we help them out at
[4639.84s] multiples that are two or three times
[4641.92s] current current levels. So, uh, really
[4644.32s] thanks for sharing that, PB. On to the
[4648.04s] next. Daniel
[4650.44s] Borman, awesome podcast. Interested
[4653.199s] 10-year bond
[4655.159s] yield relative to
[4659.239s] tariffs rather than cut. Yeah. So,
[4662.56s] covered
[4663.719s] that. The auctions went well this week.
[4666.159s] So, that&#39;s a step in the right
[4667.28s] direction. Simon Stasunus
[4673.6s] If China decides to devalue its currency
[4675.44s] as a result of tariffs, that&#39;s what they
[4677.36s] already did. Um, they are also in the
[4680.64s] market buying Alibaba stock. So, there&#39;s
[4682.8s] a lot of offsets. All this is you can&#39;t
[4685.92s] make decisions on these short-term jerks
[4688.159s] because at the end of the
[4690.12s] day, they just have to get to the table
[4692.4s] and see what kind of deal they can make.
[4694.239s] I mean, if if you&#39;re going to bet that
[4695.679s] they never make a deal, then
[4698.36s] uh you you can&#39;t invest that way. Uh
[4701.44s] let&#39;s
[4706.92s] see, another Baba
[4709.32s] question. China, I
[4711.719s] mean, literally waiting for GDAU every
[4714.64s] year, same time. Uh hi Tom, quick
[4718.48s] question regarding Nike. When would you
[4720.08s] consider to buy with enough margin of
[4721.92s] safety? I think now uh we&#39;re not doing
[4724.8s] it because we think we have a better
[4726.239s] play on the consumer discretionary, but
[4728.4s] yeah, have at it for the long term.
[4730.32s] You&#39;ll be fine.
[4732.44s] Um, thanks for the free information you
[4734.8s] provide. Want to ask your uh estate
[4736.8s] ladder. It&#39;s above the current levels.
[4738.8s] I&#39;ll leave it at that. They&#39;re asking
[4741.28s] about fair value. Luke
[4747.96s] Jovik, anything changed? We covered that
[4750.48s] in the article about advanced auto parts
[4752.56s] and tariffs. So, you can review that.
[4755.04s] Tim D,
[4757.52s] uh, VF Corp balance sheet, they paid off
[4760.32s] 1.5 billion of debt. That&#39;s probably not
[4762.159s] reflected in the numbers that you&#39;re
[4763.52s] looking at yet. Max
[4765.42s] [Music]
[4768.44s] Payne, VIX at plus 50. What do you think
[4771.36s] about buying puts? Um, you&#39;re obviously
[4774.719s] new. Don L, do you actually agree with
[4778.719s] tariff calculations? Uh, no. That was
[4781.44s] done by Rardo
[4784.199s] Navaro. David
[4787.0s] Martin, can you take a look at Skyworks
[4789.64s] Solutions?
[4791.4s] Okay, that one is uh definitely worth
[4794.48s] looking
[4795.56s] at. SWKS.
[4803.76s] Okay. So, it&#39;s down about
[4820.28s] 2/3. Cash flows come down a bit.
[4822.56s] Revenues have come down a
[4825.48s] bit. See what the balance sheet looks
[4827.84s] like.
[4838.159s] Yeah, I think there&#39;s going to be
[4839.52s] opportunities in semis. We&#39;re playing it
[4841.28s] through
[4842.44s] Intel because we like Lip
[4845.64s] Banan. Okay, so they got some
[4848.92s] cash. They&#39;ve got some Where&#39;s the debt?
[4860.96s] Yeah, balance sheet&#39;s good. Let&#39;s take a
[4863.52s] look at free cash
[4869.64s] flow. Pretty
[4873.96s] good. Look at share
[4882.76s] issuance coming down. All right. So now
[4886.32s] just help me
[4887.88s] understand where they are in the
[4894.6s] cycle. Okay, so they got China business.
[4897.199s] Question is how much China business? Uh
[4899.84s] how do they compare to their
[4901.239s] competitors? Uh I think this one&#39;s worth
[4903.44s] doing some work on. So good find.
[4905.76s] Nothing to say. That&#39;s just worth start
[4907.6s] starting to do your work on and doing
[4909.36s] your competitive analysis and uh
[4911.84s] starting to drill down. Eric Haney,
[4914.48s] thoughts on Campbell? I think we covered
[4916.239s] this a few weeks ago and took a
[4918.76s] pass. It&#39;s a defensive. I mean, yeah, if
[4921.84s] you want to make 20% over the next two
[4923.6s] years, you probably get a bounce from
[4925.4s] 35. Uh, but not an exciting business for
[4928.48s] me. Higher and better uses of cash. John
[4935.32s] Webster. John, in environments like
[4937.679s] this, just buy the stock. Don&#39;t play
[4939.36s] around with that.
[4941.8s] Um, Phillip
[4944.85s] [Music]
[4946.28s] Ranska, Ze Davis. No, I don&#39;t. That&#39;s a
[4950.32s] messed up business. I I mean, it&#39;s not
[4952.4s] for me. Jimmy Jones, Baba
[4956.679s] Holder. Okay, next
[4960.6s] one.
[4962.84s] Zivco,
[4964.52s] caner,
[4968.92s] Canazerki.
[4972.44s] Uh, no. I would not consider Brown
[4975.92s] Foreman over Dagio, but it probably
[4978.32s] works. If they if one works, they&#39;re
[4979.92s] both going to work. Uh, great time and
[4982.639s] all your thanks for the great content I
[4984.4s] mentioned to all my friends when
[4985.76s] discussing investment
[4990.28s] affiliated. Oh, so here&#39;s a guy that
[4993.12s] bought a couple weeks ago and he doesn&#39;t
[4995.6s] have dry powder. Just wait it out. If
[4997.44s] you bought good businesses at good
[4998.719s] price, it doesn&#39;t matter if you bought
[4999.92s] Boeing at 150 or 140. Uh just just sit
[5003.36s] tight. You&#39;re fine. David Muinx, that&#39;s
[5006.08s] being greedy. Pigs get slaughtered.
[5007.76s] You&#39;re not going to get the exact bottom
[5009.12s] dollar. Just relax. You got good
[5010.8s] businesses at good prices. Just hang
[5012.4s] tight and in six months, you&#39;re going to
[5014.08s] be very, very happy. David Muinx,
[5017.52s] uh you think JX JHX would be a good
[5020.96s] investment for the upcoming home boom?
[5024.0s] JHX.
[5028.92s] Uh probably wind up being a target for
[5031.84s] QXO to buy.
[5036.44s] JHX. I&#39;d rather just play QXO. You&#39;re
[5039.04s] not going to get a better operator. And
[5040.4s] if this is at all a good business, Brad
[5043.44s] Jacobs will buy it.
[5046.92s] Um I think you&#39;re
[5050.92s] probably Let&#39;s see.
[5061.159s] description
[5064.52s] cement siding.
[5069.04s] Let&#39;s take a
[5071.239s] look balance
[5081.0s] sheet
[5082.13s] [Music]
[5084.84s] cash. All right. So, they&#39;re a little
[5086.8s] bit levered, but generally okay.
[5098.08s] Yeah, this looks pretty good. So, just
[5100.239s] just start studying their competitive
[5101.679s] advantage. Listen to eight or nine
[5103.199s] conference calls, start the process. But
[5105.6s] I think this is generally pretty good.
[5107.92s] Are you going to get the perfect price?
[5109.44s] I mean, yeah, 21. If you could get it at
[5113.76s] 18, would that be better than 21? Sure.
[5116.0s] Does it really matter? If you find that
[5118.239s] your anal after you&#39;ve done the
[5120.32s] analysis, you&#39;re comfortable with the
[5121.6s] business, I think you&#39;re probably okay
[5123.12s] in this range for the long term, that&#39;s
[5124.719s] a nice find.
[5127.639s] Um, and that&#39;s it. So, with that said,
[5130.719s] I&#39;ll be on Fox Business tomorrow
[5132.32s] morning. Tune in if you&#39;re free. Uh,
[5134.08s] we&#39;ll be back next week, same time, same
[5135.679s] place. And just hang tight. Know what
[5138.96s] you own. Look under the surface. Look at
[5142.159s] the balance sheet. Look at the free cash
[5143.92s] flow. Look at the mode of the business.
[5145.6s] And when all is said and done, even if
[5147.12s] your worst case fears come true, most of
[5149.679s] the businesses that we&#39;re talking about
[5151.44s] that you&#39;re probably interested in as a
[5153.04s] listener are going to pick up share if
[5155.36s] things get horrible. Uh and if they
[5157.36s] don&#39;t get horrible, they&#39;re going to
[5158.56s] recover very, very quickly and move to
[5160.48s] new highs. So, uh hang tight. This is
[5163.44s] what incredible opportunities are made
[5165.76s] of. This is what they look like. Always
[5167.44s] darkest before dawn. this too shall pass
[5169.6s] and onward and upward uh for for the
[5172.639s] next I god this feels so much like
[5174.8s] October 2022. I can&#39;t even tell you and
[5177.28s] feels a little bit candidly like March
[5179.36s] of of
[5181.239s] 2020. Uh so I&#39;m very very enthusiastic
[5184.239s] for what&#39;s going to what&#39;s to come and
[5186.48s] uh I hope you&#39;ll join me in coming weeks
[5188.639s] and months as we see this unfold. Have a
[5190.48s] great night. Bye for now. Thanks for
[5192.48s] tuning in.
