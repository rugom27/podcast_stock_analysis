The Nasdaq's up 327 points. Thomas Hayes joins us this morning to cover this market rally. Uh, is this mo this ran today. Is this mostly about China? Well, Sue, I I do think so. All right, China holdings, Alibaba's up about 3% overnight. BU's up 5% overnight. People are very positive. This has a lot of impact. This successful framework, as Vesson put it, the preliminary consensus, as the Chinese put it. So, the market likes this quite a bit. Big tech rally, uh, sorry, big tech, I should say, they're going to report later on this week. And today, all of those big tech stocks are moving up. Does that suggest we're going to get good results from big tech this week? This is the moment of truth, Stu. We've been a little bit skeptical here. We're going to find out. Is this rally durable into year end or do we need a breather before the year-end rally? The first two MAG7 were underwhelming with Netflix and Tesla talking about margin compression. Does the market keep paying over 30 times earnings for the Mag 7 despite their earnings growth having hald year? We're going to find that out on Wednesday and Thursday. There's over $400 billion of capex committed this year. So far, the return on investment has been dimminimous. So, we want to see that forward guidance. If the forward guidance is great, this market will keep pushing higher. If there's a little bit of uncertainty, we may get a little pullback 3 6 7% and then rally into year end. So, we're going to find out by Wednesday or Thursday. And you'd buy any dip for a year-end rally. Got it. All right, Tom. Out of time. Sorry. Come back and see us real soon. Tom Hayes, everyone. Thank you. Thank you.\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nYou couldn't give Intel away at $19. Now everyone wants it at $39. And I think it's going to make the taxpayer a tremendous amount of money over the next 5 years. While everyone looks at Tesla trading at 13 times revenues and 200 times earnings, the only way you don't make money is if you buy lowquality stuff that has balance sheet risk. If you buy the highquality stuff when the waiting is this low in the in in the index, uh you tend to make enormous amounts of money. You can still get I'm pleased to welcome back Thomas Hayes. He's the managing member of Great Hill Capital and also uh the author of Hedge Fund Tips. Check it out. very good resource online for all investors. We'll be talking about uh the Fed, what are they going to do this week? We'll do a preview. We'll talk about a potential China deal. Stocks are up to date on Monday on uh a potential and of course uh earning season is upon us. Welcome back to the show, Thomas. Good to see you. Thanks for having me, David. I want to start with uh this potential China deal. Actually, it's uh driving markets higher. Gold is down 3% on the day. Stocks are up and um Bitcoin is up today. So risk on day uh new records on stocks on Monday after China and the US officials cool tensions over the weekend according to reports. Um now no official deal has been ironed out as far as I'm reading. Uh but I think there's a there's a framework that's being discussed. I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday said Treasury Secretary Scott Passent. Um yeah, this is days away from November 1st, which is the day that uh Trump said initially said would be the start date for new 100% tariffs on China. So I guess we're not seeing that anymore, Thomas. Yeah, look, you have, as you said, Besson said we have a successful framework. The Chinese counterpart said we have a preliminary consensus. We saw uh some of our Chinese holdings were up huge overnight. Babo's up three 3% in change. the BU of the world were up 5%. So the market is saying this looks money good. Um we will find out for sure on Thursday. You never know uh with with President Trump's negotiations. Sometimes at the last minute he'll throw a curveball to get a little bit more for the American people. But on balance that that looks very good. That's constructive. That's why you see tech up big today. But I think we got a lot more to focus on on\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI'm pleased to welcome back Thomas Hayes.

That's why you see tech up big today. But I think we got a lot more to focus on on earnings this week . That's going to be the real tell. Yeah, we'll get to earnings and uh and discuss that in just a bit, but this confirms I guess partly confirms the theory that every time a new tariff is announced, that's just a buying opportunity. Do you buy that? Until it's not. But yeah, I mean, look, as you know, we've been excessively bullish when other people were bearish. Uh and that's now going back, you know, multiple years through the fall of 2022. We did get a little cautious this month. Uh we built up a little bit of cash. we have no margin uh and and uh we'll see if that proves to be correct uh and if we get a buying opportunity before the final year end rally or if this just keeps pushing higher. But a lot of this has been retail driven. You're seeing it in option flow. You're seeing it in uh triple and uh 5x leveraged ETFs uh and all the craziness that's coming with that. But uh I think when all is said and done, David, price is what you pay, value is what you get. And I think uh this is the moment of truth this week and and we're going to uh dissect some of that uh in the imminent earnings in in coming days.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what are the drivers of key drivers of multiple expansion now going into 2026 now? Well, usually you get multiple expansion when you get growth expansion and uh this ca this time is different so to speak. So far, uh what we're going to see uh as we saw with Netflix and Tesla, the first two kind of mag 7 plus that reported was uh some concerns about margin compression. Uh and you saw Netflix down pretty big off of that. Tesla was a little bit uncertain off of that. And if we look yearonear, David, uh, MAG7 earnings growth is, uh, decelerating from 32% in Q3 of 2024 to what's expected to be 14% in Q3 of 2025. So, uh, a havinging of earnings growth and yet the multiple for the MAG7 basket has stayed well above 30 times. It's usually the opposite. when you see earnings growth decelerate uh you see multiple compression not multiple maintenance or multiple uh expansion. So you know uh max 7 $400 billion of committed capex uh this this year which is a 67% increase uh from last year and so far very little evidence of return on invested capital which is why you're seeing earnings growth contract. Uh that's going to impact margins that as you saw with Tesla and Netflix that's going to impact buyback ability which impacts EPS. So uh will the market continue to assign a very high growth multiple to a group that is decelerating in earnings growth uh at present? And and uh the answer is we're going to find out on Wednesday and Thursday. Right now there seems to be a trend that the tech companies are spending a lot on capex. In fact it's considerably more uh considerably higher margin on capex than the other S&P 500s companies. And so Thomas, the question is whether or not uh this trend has actually been pushing up the entire stock market. And as soon as maybe they stop spending money for whatever reason, that's when we get a slowdown. Well, there t\n\nwhat are the drivers of key drivers of multiple expansion now going into 2026 now?

And so Thomas, the question is whether or not uh this trend has actually been pushing up the entire stock market. And as soon as maybe they stop spending money for whatever reason, that's when we get a slowdown. Well, there is  something to be said for that. Um I you know, it's interesting. The mark the stock S&P is up around 41% off the April 7th trough. uh 27% of the Russell 3000 uh is only up 10% or less since the April 7th trough, which tells you we've we've basically been in the camp that maybe the MAG 7 needs to stall for a bit on the basis of earnings growth deceleration and high multiples. However, it doesn't mean everything has to do poorly. Uh maybe the the answer is an abrupt shift into those stocks that have been left for dead that are not the AI cost centers like the Mag 7, but the AI beneficiaries that that uh benefit from the technology and have margin expansion without massive amounts of investment like you're seeing across the Mag 7. So, so we could see that type of shift. And then you look, we're in uh the final week of October, David, this is the end of tax law selling for mutual funds. Uh and often times the stocks that have done worst year to date going into the end of October tend to do extremely well uh in November once that tax law selling pressure is in the rear view mirror. And so now with AI and full swing on everyone's radars, what uh what are some sectors or plays that investors can take? Are we looking at hyperscalers, uh, construction companies around that are involved with data centers? Are we looking at the big mag 7 companies themselves? Um, or anything on the periphery? How are you doing this? Uh, we've always looked to find, uh, the derivative plays. So, uh, one of the holdings that we've had that has been tremendously unpopular was Alibaba. You couldn't give it away year two years ago. It it just kind of was left for dead. China was uninvestable. It turned out it was the cheapest AI play in the world when everyone was saying it was uninvestable at $60 a share. Now people are getting interested at $175 a share. Uh they had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet at that point. They were generating 25 billion of free cash flow. You couldn't give it away. So that was an easy one. That's just getting started. Alibaba is going to continue to press higher. So while everyone looks at uh Tesla trading at uh uh you know 13 times revenues and 200 times earnings, you can still get Alibaba at a low double digit multiple with a huge uh blue skies ahead. Uh the second way we played that was Intel. No one you couldn't give Intel away at $19. Now everyone wants it at $39. Intel was was easy peasy when the government stepped in to backs stop that. Uh the game became the US government decided we are not going to depend on Taiwan semiconductor for all the semiconductors in the world. We are going to stand up Intel and they're the only game in town in the US that was at the 10 yard line. Uh Gellzinger had actually put everything in place. It's just the board got antsy even though they authorized him to do everything uh because the stock price was down. So they got rid of Gellzinger. They brought in someone that even better Lip Bhan from Cadence Systems. He had a 68 plus bagger there. He did a huge turnaround uh at Cadence Design Systems and uh and he's going to do the exact same thing in Intel. So uh they got two tailwinds. One is advanced chip development uh at their fabs uh uh GPUs and three their uh two their legacy CPU business has started to recover aggressively. So that's already up double uh plus from the lows and uh I think it could double again over the next few years as as the advanced chip demand becomes um um basically unlimited and Taiwan semiconductor you know Nvidia's biggest problem uh in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand it's been for lack of supply because Taiwan semiconductors capped them at $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter with Intel getting into the advanced chip game that was huge uh easy way to play uh that AI play. And then\n\nat $175 a share. Uh they had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet at that point. They were generating 25 billion of free cash flow. You couldn't give it away. So that was an easy one. That's just getting started. Alibaba is going to continue to press higher. So while everyone looks at uh Tesla trading at uh uh you know 13 times revenues and 200 times earnings, you can still get Alibaba at a low double digit multiple with a huge uh blue skies ahead. Uh the second way we played that was Intel. No one you couldn't give Intel away at $19. Now everyone wants it at $39. Intel was was easy peasy when the government stepped in to backs stop that. Uh the game became the US government decided we are not going to depend on Taiwan semiconductor for all the semiconductors in the world. We are going to stand up Intel and they're the only game in town in the US that was at the 10 yard line. Uh Gellzinger had actually put everything in place. It's just the board got antsy even though they authorized him to do everything uh because the stock price was down. So they got rid of Gellzinger. They brought in someone that even better Lip Bhan from Cadence Systems. He had a 68 plus bagger there. He did a huge turnaround uh at Cadence Design Systems and uh and he's going to do the exact same thing in Intel. So uh they got two tailwinds. One is advanced chip development uh at their fabs uh uh GPUs and three their uh two their legacy CPU business has started to recover aggressively. So that's already up double uh plus from the lows and uh I think it could double again over the next few years as as the advanced chip demand becomes um um basically unlimited and Taiwan semiconductor you know Nvidia's biggest problem uh in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand it's been for lack of supply because Taiwan semiconductors capped them at $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter with Intel getting into the advanced chip game that was huge uh easy way to play uh that AI play. And then\n\nwas comtock resources uh which is a natural gas play. Uh if you consider the data center demand for for the next handful of years going into 2020 2030 you look at some of the Goldman Sachs numbers triple digit increase uh 60% of that is going to be powered by natural gas and some time back you couldn't give these stocks away. Comtock resources is 75% owned by Jerry Jones. We built up a b position eight n $8 $9 $10 uh that's just getting started. It's one of the lowest cost producers of natural gas and that's going to be an AI beneficiary as well. So we're looking for the nonobvious ways, the ones that most of the lemon has not been most of the juice has not been squeezed out of the lemon where there's a lot lot of runway ahead and I and I don't see it as aggressively in the Mag 7. When you think about some of the names that I've mentioned, uh, with, um, uh, you know, BABA tripling off almost tripling off the lows, we think that can double again. Intel doubling off the lows, we think that could double or triple from here. Uh, comtock resources, uh, double off the lows, we think that can double again. I don't think you can say that about too many of the mag seven stocks that you expect them to double over the next few years, uh, or could double or triple. Uh I think that would be pretty aggressive relative to a decelerating growth rate and a monstrous amount of capex required uh and a and a big prayer session that they're actually going to get a a sufficient return on invested capital uh prospectively and uh are you are you banking on energy companies being acquired by the tech companies? Microsoft for example is restarting a nuclear facility. Uh potentially they could go further into the vertical integration. What do you think? It's not out of the question. I don't think that's their highest and best use of the capital, but I I wouldn't rule it out. That's not in our thesis. The the name of the game is the demand is going to be there, and I think these energy companies know that. So, why would they want to sell out at historic low multiples? Speaking of energy, by the way, um in that basket of 27% of the Russell, that's only rebounded 10% off the uh April 7th lows while the market's up 41%. You got energy, you have real estate, and you have consumer staples, the ones that have been left for dead that I think you're you're going to see uh a bid. So, as it relates to energy, the the sector as a whole is at its lowest waiting in the S&P 500 since when? Since COVID 2020 lows. We made an absolute fortune buying am uh buying Exxon at $33 and change when oil was trading negative. We are in a position right now with some and I'm less sanguin, believe it or not, on the ENTP oil companies than I am on some of the servicesers. But we're in a position with the waiting so low. If you buy energy when they're this far out of favor, it's really, really hard not to make money. The only way you don't make money is if you buy lowquality stuff that has balance sheet risk. If you buy the highquality stuff uh at when when the waiting is this low in the in in the index uh you tend to make enormous amounts of money. The last time prior to co that the waiting got in similar low single digits was 20201 which was the last uh tech mania where you couldn't give away an energy stock and then the next 5 to seven years what outperformed uh energy did value did uh international did small caps did uh and I think we could see a similar situation not that tech has to crash but in terms of relative performance where's your opportunity and do you just chase the things that are already up a lot or do you look for things that can double and triple over three, four, five years? Going back to Intel uh and tax stocks overall, how do you feel about the government making equity stakes? We're making investments into companies themselves earlier in the summer. Intel announced that the Trump administration is placing an $ 8.9 billion investment into the company uh to make an agreement um and ex and and they'll help expand uh the company. Uh, how do you feel as an investor with the companies getting involved with the government? Well, I think people complicate the Intel deal. The the the problem with the Intel deal was the previous administration said, \"We're going to give you $9 billion because you're pathetic and we think we need we think we need you at some point.\" Trump comes in, he goes, \"Wait, we're giving them $8 billion for what? For failing?\" No, we're giving you $8 billion. We want something in return. This is not your money, Intel. This is the taxpayers's money. like they work, you know, four or five months of the year to pay the US government taxes, they're going to get something in return. So, not only are we going to stand you up, but we're going to give them equity. And then, just like President Trump, commander-in-chief, goes out and sells planes for Boeing, even though we have no equity stake in Boeing, he's going to go out. If you think he can sell planes for Boeing, wait till you see how many chips he sells for Intel. And you saw it that the next week Nvidia was asking Trump for favors to to be able to sell some of their chips in China. Guess what? They miraculously put a $5 billion investment in Intel. And then Soft Bank Masoshi's son uh put in a $2 billion investment in Intel. So this is in in terms of uh Trump demanding that US taxpayers get paid for c capital that was already committed. he is being a responsible steward of our tax dollars. Uh as it relates to these mineral right deals, um I'm less sanguin on that in terms of uh I don't want to see uh unlimited government uh interference because you know there was some rumors earlier like oh look how much uh how many contracts we're giving to these defense companies like Lockheed we should have equity in locked. I think that becomes a slippery slope and that's problematic. I think Intel was different. Uh he he walked into capital that had already been committed with no strings attached and he said, \"No, no, no, no. If you want the taxpayers's money, the taxpayer is going to get something for it.\" And um uh as it relates to the rest of them, the mineral rights, I think that's to be determined. uh uh we certainly need uh these these these specialized resources uh and to the extent that the private market can't sort it on its own. Could there be different deals done where the public sector comes to bear for national security reasons? Yes. Uh hopefully we can avoid those at all costs. But if absolutely necessary, I think it is something that needs to be done for national security. The stock's up roughly 60% since the deal was announced late August. I think as an investor, you're looking at this trend and saying to yourself, well, one of two things could happen. Either the government continues this trend. There were rumors that uh Trump wanted to make an uh investments into some um um some quantum computing companies that has been refuted by the Department of Commerce. Uh but anyway, if they do continue this trend, we could continue to see stocks being pumped up. But potentially the government may may misallocate company resources into things that some investors in those companies may not deem productive. So it's a double-edged sword. Uh what's the future here? What do you think? I think that the company's board of directors in each respective deal has the opportunity to say no. And what that simply means is we don't want your money and we don't want your strings. Uh but if they say we want your money, they should expect to have the strings attached to it. And that's you know that is t\n\ninterference because you know there was some rumors earlier like oh look how much uh how many contracts we're giving to these defense companies like Lockheed we should have equity in locked. I think that becomes a slippery slope and that's problematic. I think Intel was different. Uh he he walked into capital that had already been committed with no strings attached and he said, \"No, no, no, no. If you want the taxpayers's money, the taxpayer is going to get something for it.\" And um uh as it relates to the rest of them, the mineral rights, I think that's to be determined. uh uh we certainly need uh these these these specialized resources uh and to the extent that the private market can't sort it on its own.

But if absolutely necessary, I think it is something that needs to be done for national security. The stock's up roughly 60% since the deal was announced late August.

Uh but anyway, if they do continue this trend, we could continue to see stocks being pumped up. But potentially the government may may misallocate company resources into things that some investors in those companies may not deem productive. So it's a double-edged sword. Uh what's the future here? What do you think? I think that the company's board of directors in each respective deal has the opportunity to say no. And what that simply means is we don't want your money and we don't want your strings. Uh but if they say we want your money, they should expect to have the strings attached to it. And that's you know that is t\n\nI think it's no different with the rare earths. I think it's no different. I mean, as far as the quantum computing stocks, that seemed like a little bit of silly season and a little bit worrisome. Fortunately, that that's not showing that uh that there's going to be any followthrough on that. But to the extent that it becomes uh a national security, look, you've got DARPA working on similar things. So maybe there will be more and more public private partnerships uh in the name of national security. But when it comes to investing money in a company andor taking equity or debt um uh the company will will uh companies will have the right to say say no or demand different terms and I think that's that's just the case. Now if the administration starts co-opting companies we haven't seen any evidence of that. uh uh that would be a different situation and uh and I think there would be a huge uh uprising against that type of behavior. Uh we haven't seen it to date. Uh and in terms of Intel, it's proven to be a success and I think it's going to make the taxpayer a tremendous amount of money over the next 5 years. It's going to be one of the best investments uh taxpayer money has ever been involved in. And if restrictions are placed on tech companies for exporting to China, for example, Nvidia, uh those restrictions were in place by Trump. But uh anyway, if they double down, the current administration doubles down, is that a sell-off uh kind of impetus for you? Look, I think I was against the restrictions uh that came came to bear by the previous administration. I mean, the previous administration's stance was China bad in every way under every circumstance. Let's not talk. Uh Trump is China's fine as long as they give us what we want. And if we can come to a deal where we make more money than we lose, then we love China. And if we can't, we'll isolate them. And um and go back to the China bad for every possible reason under the sun like the previous administration. Trump is willing to talk. Trump is willing to do a deal as long as Trump a aka America gets paid and benefits from it. As far as um refusing to export chips to China in the name of national security, I think it was the worst national security mistake uh we've seen in many many years. And the reason is is because China used to be dependent on us and they used to take what we would give them and they would take it with open arms and they would just funnel money into our coffers and create massive earnings power for the US companies. Now, we've said we're not going to allow you to give us unlimited amounts of money uh because we're not going to give you our chips in the name of national security. And what China has done is they have gone on to make uh incredible chips on their own. And on that basis, uh they've gone from being dependent to now being independent to now being in some areas superior. If you look at some of their large language models like Quen uh with Alibaba, like some of the uh chips that they're developing internally, uh we kind of let the genie out of the bottle. They they would have not been that far ahead on innovation had we continue to supply them and continue to keep them dependent on our technology. Now they're becoming independent and in some areas uh excelling beyond us. Okay, let's move on to uh the Fed. It's uh Fed week this week. Uh, importantly, Bessent has named top picks to replace uh, Jerome Powell. Um, Fed chair finalists are Christopher Waller, Kevin Walsh, uh, Kevin Hasset, Michelle Bowman, Rick Reer. Um, we we we have we have a short list now and um, no one's been confirmed yet, but it looks like everyone uh is, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like everybody is supportive of much lower rates. Is that correct? I think everyone except for one is supportive of lower rates. I think Worsh has a history of being hawkish uh and he's playing the game that he's going to be cooperative in order to be given a serious consideration. I think it's not dissimilar to what we saw from Powell before he was confirmed. Uh that he seemed flexible and then the moment he came in, if you remember the autopilot comment in December of 2018 where he basically crashed the market before Christmas and um Minutian had to come in and uh convene a meeting of all the banks 3 days before Christmas on a Sunday to create liquidity and pump the market back up. Um, I think that uh uh Waller for sure, Bowman, uh, all of these are good. Worsh, uh, Reader, they're all s fantastic picks. I think Worsh um, uh, Worsh, you really run the risk of once he's in doing whatever the hell he wants. And, uh, I'm not saying he's not competent, he's very skilled. I he would be the wild card that I would be very concerned about in terms of maybe keeping things too restrictive too long, thinking he knows better uh and uh and maybe putting governors on the uh economy that that don't necessarily need to be there in the short term. So I think four out of five are phenomenal. Everyone I talked to loves Worsh. So maybe I'm missing something. But uh if you go back to his stances over, you know, decade plus, uh he's he's often been very very hawkish and and now he's kind of changed stripes uh in order to be in the mix. Uh this is I I love looking at um betting markets on issues. Who will Trump announce his Fed share in 2025? No announcement by December is the majority of votes. And if you actually look at who people are voting or betting on rather um Hassid is lightly leading Christopher Waller I mean it's pretty close when it comes to these uh the first two rather are pretty close. Uh so anyway if you had to if you had to put your money on and bet nobody knows but who who would you bet on? You know I I think any of those would be great. Uh I think Hassid or Worsh maybe Bowman. You know President Trump does like to appoint women to um positions. He's he's been one of the most pro- women, pro- diversity kind of administrations historically. Uh never gets any credit for that. I it wouldn't shock me if he put in Bowman, but I certainly think uh Waller, uh Worsh, all of those would be good choices. As far as whether he makes the announcements before December, that's going to be dependent on what Powell does. You know, if Powell cuts uh this week and he cuts in December, Trump is going to let him ride out like uh Seinfeld on top and uh let him let him have a kind of victory lap and let him go out with style. If he tries to choke things up uh by either not moving this week, which I think is unlikely, or uh not moving in December, I think at that point Trump will announce his, you know, top one or top two picks and make it clear to the market that uh that Powell is a lame duck until he he vacates his seat in 2026. But, uh, hopefully it'll be a cooperative policy, a progrowth policy from the Fed, uh, and, uh, Powell can go out and, um, and have a a, um, a favorable legacy. So, we're looking at at least a 25 basis point cut this week, Thomas. So, last time you were on the show, you mentioned to me that once unemployment ticks up, it's a very hard genie to put back in the bottle, I believe, words. And now we have 4.3%. Let me just double check. Yeah, 4.3% as of um Well, we have no idea. We have no data. So, that's right. That's that's And by the way, you know, t\n\nSo, we're looking at at least a 25 basis point cut this week, Thomas. So, last time you were on the show, you mentioned to me that once unemployment ticks up, it's a very hard genie to put back in the bottle, I believe, words. And now we have 4.3%. Let me just double check. Yeah, 4.3% as of um Well, we have no idea. We have no data. So, that's right. That's that's And by the way, you know, t\n\nthat thing called the uh we're we've got 27 days into a shutdown. Uh economies economists estimate 10 to 25 basis points a week for every week of the shutdown. Yes, it's earned back once it reopens, but uh no one's paying attention to it. I think the longer this thing drags on, if you get that coupled with uh mixed guidance with the MAG 7, uh I think you could find find ourselves uh maybe with a little bit of pullback. You know, ordinarily when you have these 15% plus mid-year corrections like we had in April and then you hit all-time highs, there's a secondary correction in that year that averages 6.4%. We haven't seen it yet. Is it coming? uh as a result of maybe some surprises this week. I don't know. Uh but any of those dips if we if they did materialize are to be bought because year to date we've got 312 going on 313 central bank cuts this year globally around the world which is the highest since the postgra financial crisis in 2009. So, there's a lot of liquidity slloshing around in the system. Uh, even if we get some short-term shocks, whether it's from the shutdown, whether it's from bank seven earnings, uh, or something else geopolitical or otherwise, uh, you know, as I said, we've been, you know, accused of being a perman permeable, and that's been right. We raised some cash this month. We're, you know, have zero margin effectively. Uh, and, uh, and we've been waiting for a pullback that may never come. uh which is fine. You know, there's also something to be said for locking in a huge year, but um we'd love to see some type of volatility that we could benefit from uh and then play into the year- end rally. So, we we'll see how that how that materializes. Well, how significant is the government shutdown on Fed policy decision-making? Because on the one hand, like you said, we don't have official unemployment data from the BLS, but we have we have other private uh data uh that's tracking u payrolls. Uh but on the other hand, we did get CPI released last week. And so, could the Fed just ignore unemployment for now and look at higher CPI print and maybe maybe slow down their uh their doubbishness? Is that possible? I I think it's a low probability that they don't move this week, but as as is the case with the Mag 7, uh the key is going to be the forward guidance. So, I think uh if if they they're not going to be immensely penalized for more hawkish than normal guidance if they cut. And so, what's the downside for them doing it? And I don't know that the market expects them to do it. So on that basis, I would say maybe that there's a surprise in that. Uh yeah, they cut 25 basis points and then they come out hawkish at the 230 meeting saying, you know, we don't have data. you know, inflation came in better than expected, but it's still a little more elevated than we would like to see or above target or some some type of language like that that the market maybe interprets as December off the table for the next, you know, few days and until they start to get employment numbers and realize, no, December is well on the table. Uh the labor market's a little bit weaker. I think um you know the sooner we get that employment data the the the clearer we're going to know the trajectory moving forward but uh the the trajectory moving forward is lower rates whether whether there's a pit stop in December or not um Trump has made it abundantly clear that the next Fed chair will will be dovish and uh so if if we pause for a couple months until Powell uh vacates then so be it. But uh I think everything is pointing toward uh lower and lower rates for the foreseeable future. Uh I want to close off uh Thomas on alternative assets. You and I haven't spoken much about the precious metals, but it's become more of a mainstream topic in the last couple uh weeks to months. Um major banks JP Morgan are uh and Goldman Sachs are upping their gold forecast by the end of 2026. I believe Goldman has a $4,900 um outlook by the end of 2026. This is the price so far. The gold price has pulled back from its highs. Um this is kind of mirroring what happened in 2011. Anyway, do you have a view on this asset? Do you have an allocation to it? Have you allocated more uh on this really historical uh rally? It's up more than uh let me just get the exact number here to the peak. It's up more than 60% year to date. Okay. So, you know what's interesting about gold is that it's a non-productive asset. So, when people say, \"Oh my gosh, gold is the greatest thing that's ever.\" Look, it's up 61%. Do you know how many stocks are up o, you know, over 60% this year, like while everyone was focused on gold, uh the amount of stocks that you could have bought in the April trough that are up double and triple already is unlimited. uh relative to gold. So spending your time on an asset that you're buying in hopes that people will come behind you and and push it higher based on demand for fear or geopolitical or debasement trade. Uh look, if you get the basement, it's like Warren Buffett said, whether we get paid in dollars or seashells or shekels or whatever, if you're buying a business that provides value to the marketplace, you're going to command the most of those seashells, shekels, gold coins. it it it it's really immaterial. The key is buy a productive asset and if there's a debasement trade, you'll just get more shekels per value provided and uh and and find great companies when they're temporarily impaired. And doubles and triples over a 3 to 5 year period are relatively easy to find if you have a solid framework. As far as gold, you're you're effectively guessing. I think the theme is correct that the dollar is going to trend weaker over time, in which case uh gold in theory should should remain elevated. But why, you know, why play that game when when there's so many other opportunities where you actually have uh some level of control over analyzing the forward cash flows and what you'd be willing to pay for those forward cash flows versus just hoping there are other buyers coming in behind you. So, uh to those who have allocation and have been gold bugs for the last 20 years and now have their day in the sun, you know, congratulations. Uh this is the day you've been waiting for. Uh, you know, like they say, the most expensive drink in the casino is the free drink because it means you're still at the table. So, take a few chips off the table. Take your free drink. Uh, maybe let a few chips ride if that's your game, but uh uh beware because uh the clock strikes 12 and uh we'll we'll see if Cinderella uh does okay. couple years ago, Berkshire Hathaway did own Barrett Gold for a few months, I believe, until they sold it off and uh the play there and Warren Buffett has never liked gold as a as a bullion uh mainly for the reasons that you've talked about. Uh but he did buy a minor. Are you would you consider a minor if the free cash flow is extraordinarily strong at current gold prices? If I'm not saying they will be, but you know, if Yeah. No, I I I have found that the miners, no matter how high the price of the underlying asset goes, they they somehow figure out a way to lose money. Like invariably, uh maybe they get a quarter or two where they generate free cash and everyone says, \"Oh, this time is different.\" But somehow that mining business is a really difficult business. I don't think that was Warren himself. I think that was his uh Todd or Ted. Uh and you see these tiny little positions come and go kind of trading. There's never been a Warren Buffett. there never will. We're seeing that. Um uh and uh and I I could almost guarantee that wasn't Warren's decision. Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much, Thomas. We'll we'll end it here. And uh please do follow Hedge Fund Tips. Very good uh resource, good summary of the news as well as um um other information and analysis and charts.

Um the the key chart you want to look at is forward EPS with uh Russell this this quarter at 42% earnings growth uh small caps versus uh S&P. By the way, estimates were very close. You know, people keep talking about the beat rate. We usually beat by 3%. So far that is not the case. It was uh around 8% estimates. We're at 9%. Uh so we're seeing some of it today with um um Meta is down 8% after hours. So Mag 7 has been uh less than Google was good, Microsoft's down, Tesla was down, Netflix was down big. So, as expected, let's see if we get a little break in the indices here because uh we've had that cash ready to go and I think in the next few days and few weeks, we're going to be deploying all of it and getting back on a little bit of margin as well. Nothing crazy. We never go over 10 15%. But, uh I think we're going to be able to deploy a lot of cash in coming days and weeks. So, we're super excited because uh we got a little volatility in early October after we got cautious, but we really, you know, the market's just been kind of grinding, grinding, grinding and so much retail option flow. And I told you that t\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nRussell 2000 index relative to the S&P. Russell is uh uh this is trailing EPS relative to trailing EPS.

So, we're super excited because uh we got a little volatility in early October after we got cautious, but we really, you know, the market's just been kind of grinding, grinding, grinding and so much retail option flow. And I told you that there is  no way in hell those retail options are getting paid out. the 20 million contract uh 40 million contract a day of call options for 20 consecutive sessions. Those are going to expire worthless and we are going to benefit from uh some weakness here to get the remaining cash and excess margin availability to work before end of year. Uh and we're super duper excited about it. Um crowded short interest sometimes creates huge rallies. Uh yes, that is correct. And what he's speaking to is what is Brent crude oil spot prices 52 increase decrease manage money short open interest. You can see they're super short at the lows in May 2017. Super short at the lows in uh uh 2000 June of 2020 and super short um uh right now. And I think we're going to start to see a lot of opportunity in oil. we've expressed through uh national oilco and comtock which by the way there was a full feature article on the wall street journal this afternoon which we'll touch on uh next largest stocks have underperformed over the last century by about 8% per year periodically uh periodically the largest stocks outperform in the last century this has happened five years or more seven times 10 years or more three times 15 years or more one time. The current outperformance is the second longest in the century at 10 and a half years. So you can see this is an extreme. It never ends well. Uh you want to be more diversified. And if you're in the S&P saying you're diversified, you're not. You're basically in a MAG 7 index. Uh which um uh as we're seeing here with Meta and uh Netflix and all these the spending's up, the margins are contracting and the multiple hasn't come down. that's going to change. Uh and uh and I think we're seeing the early stages of of that right now. So um US equity leadership cycles and peaks, US versus developed markets that is now rolling over. USA versus emerging markets now rolling over. You can see these past peaks and then you get periods of the opposite um where emerging markets start to outperform relative to US and international relative. We're seeing it this year. uh medium forward returns and win ratios after high beta 5day decline to 10%. So this implies 7,300. I agree with 7,300. I just think it's a next year phenomenon, not a this year phenomenon. Uh gold obviously everyone bought the top so now they're going to get punished. Uh top 10 US companies dominate US world equity market, country GDP, market cap index. We know all this uh uh 10 strongest buyers markets of September 2025. Um so the the the switch has flipped um in a lot of the hottest markets are now cooling and becoming buyers markets versus sellers markets. That was the opposite two years ago. Just the beginning. The affordability is going to happen. Everyone who said house prices are going to go up because rates go down are going to be wrong this time. What you're going to see is supply go through the roof and overwhelmed demand. Chart of the day shutdown drags on. Um this is uh whistling past the graveyard. Uh you know we're almost 30 days into this shutdown. That's somewhere between 40 to 100 basis points off of GDP. it'll be earned back if they stop it soon. But t\n\n you want to be more diversified. And if you're in the S&P saying you're diversified, you're not. You're basically in a MAG 7 index. Uh which um uh as we're seeing here with Meta and uh Netflix and all these the spending's up, the margins are contracting and the multiple hasn't come down. that's going to change. Uh and uh and I think we're seeing the early stages of of that right now. So um US equity leadership cycles and peaks, US versus developed markets that is now rolling over.

I just think it's a next year phenomenon, not a this year phenomenon.  bankruptcy filing filings are falling as spreads tighten. That's positive thing to see. And then so credit spreads are still tightening. That'll be good for Cooper Standard to refinance their debt.  emerging market stock index, third highest level in 37year history, looks like it's going to break out. There's usually no such thing as a triple top.  S&P 500 post election cycle versus 2025.  next year also should have some chop which benefits stock picking because the indices slow down.

That'll be good for Cooper Standard to refinance their debt. uh emerging market stock index, third highest level in 37year history, looks like it's going to break out. There's usually no such thing as a triple top. Uh so this cycle that everyone uh said would never happen a couple years ago, pounding the table, is now happening in spades. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nS&P 500 post election cycle versus 2025. Uh that's for this year implies some short-term volatility. Uh yeah, next year also should have some chop which benefits stock picking because the indices slow down. Wage growth is outpacing home price inflation.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\nVans is enjoying strong momentum. Proportion of arrivals on US and UK re retailers website selling out in a majority of sizes July 1st through October 15th. Vans old school uh 200% change from last year. Vans authentic that's better than Nike Cortez, Adidas Samba and Adidas Superstar. Uh number of global rate cuts in the past 24 months almost at post great financial crisis highs. It is now at because 312 turned to 313 today which means we have the most amount of Fed cuts globally since August of 2010. That's massive liquidity. And that's why I say if we do see 4 to 8% pullback here, uh, it's to be bought. Uh, 121day streak above the 50-day moving average is usually is actually third longest streak since 2007. The 2011 streak ended 130 days. Either way, indeed, both streaks would end with at least 20% declines. 2011 intraday thereafter. We look for excess in markets always mean revert. Uh, so this is Seth Golden talking about a correction. I like this stuff that he's putting out here. I don't think it's going to be anywhere in that neighborhood of 20%. I think that's recency bias, but I do see, you know, 4 to 9% um uh I think could could we could see uh which would surprise a lot of people. Uh, call yourself, this is from Lou Bassin, good friend, call yourself a contrarian, then you should be loading up on oil. Amen, brother. Couldn't agree with you more. Nothing hated more than that right now. Uh data center loads expected to double by 2035. Uh 60% of that's going to be fueled by natural gas. When the top 10 concentration is greater than 23%, the bottom 490 equal weight has outperformed 88% of the time over the next 5 years. Let me repeat that. Probably the most important chart of the week. When the top 10 concentrators greater concentration is greater than 23%, the bottom 490 equal weight has outperformed 88% of the time over the next 5 years. Shelter disinflation is happening and likely more to come. Amen. Hallelujah. Um markets now predict five more cuts by 2026 followed by gradual rate hikes from 2028. Uh that might have changed today. Carson cycle composite for the S&P 500 again. Um you know this is not following. People are trying to say it's following exactly. We had a huge correction in uh April. I do think we're going to get endofear followthrough. I think we're going to see some short-term chop between the Fed. Let's see what happens with Trump and China uh and uh MAG 7. People are waking up to the fact that the return on invested capital is not coming anytime in the near term and they've been paying for it. And I think that's why you see things like uh Netflix fall 10% and you see um Meta fall 8% after hours, you see Microsoft down, etc. At this point in Trump's first term, energy was down 9%, it's down 5% now. Tech was up, it's up now. So, it's all kind of tracking. S&P was up 13%. So, he could almost a lot of these things are in line. Uh probably staples have to play catch-up, financials have to catch down, healthc care has to catch up, materials has has to catch up huge. Uh, and that's kind of in line with what we're seeing where we're seeing opportunity. I'd like Yeah, materials for sure has to catch up. Healthcare and um and consumer discretionary. Okay. Companies are not talking about negative micro catalyst. Okay. Gross leverage, net leverage, gross leverage is pretty high, PE ratio exposures. S&P 1500 PE ratio exposures, you got 50 25% of the S&P 1500 has a multiple of greater than 50 50 times. That's insane. 7% has multi multiples between 10 to 15 times. Um, that's an interesting distribution. S&P 500 growth index divided by S&P 500 value. It's at the top of the trend line here, rolling back over just like you saw in 2000. and you had a massive value outperformance. So again, just for the newer people, the themes that we see playing out in the next five years, small caps over large caps, uh equal weight over uh cap weight, international versus domestic, which is playing out huge this year, but we were saying it last year before it happened. Um I think healthcare is going to start to outperform. I think energy is going to out start to outperform materials, defensives. Uh so pay attention to that. Margin expansion is in the red zone super high. I think we get a little bit of that knocked out here in the short term. Uh capex share of operating cash flow for hyperscalage is now 60%. That's what's weighing on margins uh without yet showing the return. Market's starting to get impatient justifiably so. Uh here are the incentives available. This is from car dealership guy. a lot of 0% for 60 and 72 months. Now, this is what we said. Uh incentives are the leading indicator of volumes. Volumes is what the name of the game for Cooper Standard, which has been a machine. Global AI investment and spending that's showing up in the earnings uh quarterly EPS estimates. Okay, I don't really worry quarter to quarter. I look at annual ML and summation rolling over while the indices are holding up there tends to catch down S&P 500 returns are worse when analysts are most bullish and they're talking about the magnificent 7 and the tech bubble. long-term earnings growth rates, consumer confidence in the stock market. This tends to be bullish once it bottoms out. Uh so these are the counterveiling forces. So sentiment is washed out. That tends to be generally bullish for the market over over coming years. We generally agree, we're generally constructive. We just think short term there going to be more opportunities. You shouldn't be buying up, you should be buying down. Um, I can't remember the times we bought stocks on a green day. So, as we've had green days, we've been sitting on our hands and waiting, and I think the time is coming imminently. US public sector infrastructure spending was weak for a decade, suggesting scope for catchup. Uh, positive sales surprises going up. That's good to see. This made financing breakdown for must be all those circular deals. Okay, I'll vendor finance you. You buy my stuff. You buy my stuff. I'll vendor finance you more. Uh total capex to overbought oversold composite. Uh definitely showing overbought here. Margins typically peak more than a year ahead of equities. number of quarters from peak margins to S&P peak. On average, margins peak nine months before the SNP peaks. So, that's kind of interesting. Uh we'll see what happens to margins this quarter. Uh then extrapolate out nine months. Um what else do we see here? Number of quarters from peak margins to recession is on average 11 months. uh skeptical we're going to re see a recession in 12 months, but uh we'll keep an eye on it. 10year Treasury constant maturity minus Fed funds rate. That's kind of interesting. uh Fed funds is less important than twos 10 inversion. The twos 10's inversion typically precedes a recession by six to nine months. So that would be something else. I could see a mini recession late next year. I mean that would be an incredible opportunity. But um I could definitely see a situation where that doesn't happen as well. So, you know, you get over this line though, you tend to start to run a higher risk, and that's just a function of Powell being too restrictive for too long. Uh, another clue to expect a strong year-end rally. So, that's uh Dietrich given more bullish stats for end of year. Staples plus discretionary washed out. So, everyone's betting against the consumer. It's a huge opportunity there. Awarded so far. Capex still early, but higher capex has been rewarded so far. I think that changes this quarter. We're seeing it after hours. uh evolution of Q3 consensus earnings. So yeah, Citadel Citadel Securities retail option volume. Okay. What did you see right before the April crash? Elevated retail. This is double the elevated retail we saw before the April crash of this year. Double if not. Yeah, double. So um if you think these guys are getting paid, you are uh not in your right mind. retail percent of total cash market. Again, last peak was Jen 20 21. Fed balance sheet unwind could end as early as October. It's now going to end in December. Plenty more easing ahead in the pipeline. We agree. That's why we remain constructive intermediate term even though we're cautious short term. lot cattle starting to roll over. That could start to help um restaurant stocks. So, keep an eye on this. This was a big move this week. We've been waiting for 30-year fixed mortgages. Are we going to get below six before the end of the year? When I said it in the beginning of the year, everyone said crazy town. I said we were going to get a high five handle. 5'9, something like that. We're 13 bits away. Let's go, baby. Eight weeks to go. Number of 20% draw downs in the S&P 500 in the last seven and 10 years. Rolling 10 years. Rolling seven years. So, like I said, there's been a lot of pull forward. If it averages every 3 and a half years, we've had a lot, which is why I don't think we're getting another 20% anytime soon. I'm in the 4 to 9% camp. Uh, and we'll go from there. Uh, let's see here. We got quality factor. What do we have here? Consumer confidence survey. Current jobs availability, jobs plentiful. So that peaked in 2003 has been trending downward since jobs hard to find is starting to trend upward. Keeping an eye on that. ETF flows since September 24th. Rate cut. Starting to see a little bit into healthcare, a little bit into energy, a lot into industrials, tech, financials, same thing. Uh levered long AUM, relative inverse AUM is at a peak. Levered long these three and five times these are going to get a flushing. How much of the S&P is related to AI stocks? So again, it shows the concentration and so on. Okay, let's get to some\n\nretail percent of total cash market. Again, last peak was Jen 20 21. Fed balance sheet unwind could end as early as October. It's now going to end in December. Plenty more easing ahead in the pipeline. We agree. That's why we remain constructive intermediate term even though we're cautious short term. lot cattle starting to roll over.

Revenue came in at 13.65 billion, up 6% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, beating street estimates of 3.15 billion and topping management's prior guidance by about 600 million. Earnings per share of 23 cents came in well ahead of consensus at 01 and management guidance for break even results altogether. The quarter marked Intel's fourth consecutive beat on guidance and its first profit after six straight losses. the company's longest losing streak in 35 years.

This was a stock you couldn't give away at 18 or $19 a share with investors blinded by the uninvestable label and looking at me like I had two heads for pitching the name. Fast forward to today and Intel now sits second only to AMD as the best performing AI name year to date, outperforming every Mag 7 stock that investors continue to clamor for. Now that the stock has more than doubled from the lows, analysts have been forced to take price targets from $20 a share to $40 a share overnight and suddenly everyone is interested. This wasn't on anyone's bingo card except for the loyal listeners of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. That's because when viewers tune in each week, they do what we like to call burdening ourselves with the facts. That means taking the time to actually look under the hood and do the fundamental work on a company by company basis to know what we own. When you do that, the the Intel thesis becomes simple common sense about as straightforward as they come. The US government had no choice but to step in and backs stop Intel. Without Intel, the entire world would have its eggs in the TSMC basket. Washington couldn't let the future of advanced chipmunking rest in the hands of a single foreign company. And Intel was the only firm on US soil, standing on the 10y line of achieving that goal. But it's not just Uncle Sam that can't afford for Intel to struggle. Every major chip designer from Nvidia to AMD to Mag 7 names currently depends on the kindness of strangers for advanced foundry work. And there's only one stranger in town, TSMC. No company in his right mind wants to rely on a single supplier halfway across the world. Jensen Wong didn't write a $5 billion check out of the kindness of his heart. He did it because his growth growth is capped at $4 billion a quarter at TSMC. The night in shining armor to fix this is now Intel. And for that reason, there is  nobody in the world that wants Intel to succeed more than Nvidia.

Two, Intel survives as a leader in mediocre chips, maintaining its legacy CPU and server business worth about $45 to $50 a share. Or three, Intel executes on its foundry business and AI vision worth $100 plus per share. In any of these scenarios, it's heads we win, tails we win, uh, win less, but still win.

This all comes down to one simple principle and what Warren Buffett calls the three most important words in investing, margin of safety. When you know what you own and you don't let headlines  shake you out, investing in great companies becomes a waiting game. And as long as humans remain emotional and impatient, there will always be plenty more time arbitrage opportunities just like Intel. Here's the breakdown. We highlighted the important parts. You can read it at hedge funips.com. And uh 10 key points. Number one, Intel made significant progress cleaning up the balance sheet, securing nearly $20 billion in cash through deals and improving its net debt position by roughly $15 billion sequentially. Uh during the quarter, the company achieved 5.7 billion and 8.9 billion total US government funding, 2 billion from the soft bank's investment, 5.2 billion from the sale of Alterara and its mobilized stake 900 million with 5 billion Nvidia investment expected to close in Q4. management used part of these proceeds to repay 4.3 billion in debt and plans to continue pri prioritizing deleveraging through 2026. Intel also returned to positive free cash flow, generating $900 million of adjusted free cash flow during the quarter. Two client compute group. All right, that surprised me a little bit. Revenue for the quarter, it happened faster than expected. was 8.5 billion, up 8% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. The growth was driven by the ongoing refresh cycle, Windows 11 adoption, and rising demand for AIPCs. With Panther Lakes first SKU still on track to launch by year end and additional SKU's planned for the first half of 2026 along with Aerol Lakeake ramping and Nova Lake strengthening the produ product lineup, management believes they now have the strongest PC portfolio in years. Looking ahead, management expects client consumption TAM to approach 290 million units in 2025, making two marking two consecutive years of growth off the postcoid bottom in 2023, the fastest TAM growth since 2021 and setting the stage for another year of healthy PC demand. Three data center and AI group DCAI reported revenue of 4.1 billion up 5% sequentially ahead of expectations due to stronger enterprise demand and growing AI workloads that are driving both refresh activity and capacity expansion. Management believes the underinvestment in traditional infrastructure over the past few years should allow server CPU revenue TAM to grow comfortably going forward. Most importantly, they noted that current demand continues to exceed supply capabilities across both the client and data center AI business. of dynamic they expect to persist well into 2026. Four, Intel's deal with Nvidia will integrate Intel's CPUs alongside Nvidia's AI graphics processors, which currently account for about 90% of the AI chip market. Management expects a partnership to create multiple years of engagement between the two companies, aka GPUs, may be in the cards down the road, and to open up a new market opportunity for Intel, expanding its TAM in a way that is incremental rather than cannibalistic to its existing business. Five, Foundry revenue came in at 4.2 2 billion ahead of expectations and driven by increased wafer output. The segment reported an operating loss of 2.3 billion representing a 54.8 operating margin which narrowed materially compared to the same period last year when Intel foundry posted a $5.8 billion loss. Management's confidence and conviction in the foundry business continues to grow with projections calling for a greater than 10x increase in gigawatts of AI capacity by 2030 creating significant opportunities for Intel Foundry with external customers. Four, yields and performance on 18A continue to make steady progress with management noting that yields are on track to reach internal milestones and have improved at a predictable rate. The 18A note is expected to drive wafer volumes well into the next decade and deliver healthy returns on investment. Management believes that by the end of 2026, 18A yields will reach a level appropriate for margins and by the end of 2027 will be considered industry acceptable. During the quarter, Intel also opened Fab 52 in Arizona, its fifth high volume fabrication facility, which is now fully operational. Seven management's confidence around 14A continues to grow, supported by encouraging engagement with external customers and positive early feedback yields on 14A are off to a strong start, showing significantly better performance at this stage of maturity maturity compared to where 18A yield stood at the same point. Intel plans to remain disciplined in adding capacity investing only when external customer demand is confirmed. Management noted they are heavily engaged in these discussions and are beginning to attract key process technology talent that can drive help drive long-term success. Eight adjusted gross margins came in at 40% for the quarter, up 22 percentage points year-over-year from an adjust from just 18% and four points above management's prior guidance. Hallelujah. The improvement was driven by higher revenue and a more favorable product mix partially offset by the early ramp for 18A and Lunar Lake. Nine management remains disciplined on reigning in operating expenses down to just 4.54 billion compared to 11.05 billion during the same period last year. Operating margins for the quarter stood at 11.2% up 22 percentage points year-on-year. Intel remains on track to rightsize the company by year end. target of 75,000 employees with a current employee headcount of 88,000 down from 124,000 during the same period last year and 10 for Q4 guidance. Management expects revenue of 12.8 billion to 13.8 billion which is roughly flat quarter over quarter when accounting for the Altera transaction and in line with Wall Street consensus of 13.4 billion. Management expects non-Gap EPS of8 uh 8 cents down 5 cents year-over-year and gross margins of approximately 36.5% down sequentially due to product mix and impact of initial ship shipments of Core Ultra 3.\n\nDuring the quarter, Intel also opened Fab 52 in Arizona, its fifth high volume fabrication facility, which is now fully operational.

As it turns out, old dogs can learn new tricks. When Alex Chris took over the reigns at the granddaddy of fintech a little over two years ago, he inherited a company that fall had fallen asleep at the wheel after riding the e-commerce boom during the pandemic. Prior, management had stopped innovating and tried to make up for it by spending billions on acquisitions that struggled to integrate. Growth was slowing, transactions margins were under pressure and the user base was declining.

That shift created a temporary 5 to 6% drag on the top line which the uh which fed the market's mistaken narrative. Now that we are lapping that drag and PSP is back to profitable mid-s singledigit growth and accelerating. The market is\n\nbeginning to pay attention to the innovation that has been right in front of it all along. The flurry of deals we have seen recently is case in point. First came the agentic commerce deal with Perplexity back in May. Few weeks ago, it was a multi-year digital commerce deal with Google that cements PayPal as a key PSP across payment service provider across Google products. Earlier this week, they partnered with Mastercard to advance secure agentic commerce. And on the same day, integrated Venmo across the entire built ecosystem to allow users to pay rent or mortgages through Venmo. The list goes on. Then came the whipped cream and cherries on the top. Right before earnings, PayPal announced a deal with Open AAI to become the first payments wallets integrated directly into ChatGpt. We already knew Alex Chris and Sam Alman had a relationship going back to Alman's Worldcoin days, which we flagged on this podcast weeks ago. So, this partnership was something we had a feeling might come together at this at some point. All of this ties back to our broader AI beneficiary investment thesis that we have discussed in recent podcasts and articles. Rather than owning the companies forced to pick up the AI tab and erode earnings in the process, we prefer to own the beneficiaries of AI in the unmnificent 493 trading at much lower multiples with accelerating earnings and let the hyperscalers pick up the tab. We get a free ride on their coattails, capturing all the upside without spending a dime. Going back to PayPal, the point is simple. This company is back in growth mode. We've highlighted the key points from the uh uh chat GPT article and from the earnings breakdown and put stars next to the super important points uh and the deck and the uh earnings call transcript I believe. Let's see. Yes. Uh so here are the 10 key points. Number one, PayPal reported net revenue of 8.4 billion for the quarter. up 7% year-on-year, beating Wall Street cont consensus by approximately $182 million. Non-Gap EPS also came in well ahead of expectations, rising 12% year-over-year to 1.34 and beating consensus by 13 cents. Number two, during the quarter, management returned $ 1.5 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 21 million shares of common stock at an average price of $71. So, for all those whiny little that were saying pain pal, pain pal, and didn't know what they owned because they're worried about the price versus the value of the stock, uh, guess who you were selling to? Not only me, but you were also selling to Alex Chris with the company buying back your shares and taking you out of your stock on a trailing 12-month basis. This brings the total repurchase to 5.7 billion or 78 million shares, reducing the weighted average share count by 6%. In addition to buybacks, PayPal announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend, declaring a dividend of 14 cents per share and targeting a 10% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Most importantly, this new dividend does not impact the company's share repurchase program and is intended to complement it with management maintaining its long-term framework of returning 70 to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. the vast majority through buybacks and targeting $6 billion in repurchases for the full year. Three, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was 2.3 billion, up 48%. Let me say that again. Free cash flow was 2.3 billion for the quarter, up 48% year-over-year. This reminds me of PayPal. This reminds me of Alibaba at $60 when you couldn't give it away and they were generating over $20 billion of free cash flow per year. And you can't make this stuff up. uh bringing the year-to- date free cash flow to 4.3 billion. Management reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to seven billion which would mark a record high and imply 11% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Four, the payment service provider segment has now turned the corner after lapping the quote firing of unprofitable customers with total payment volume up 6% year-over-year and accelerating from 2% growth in the prior quarter. This includes enterprise payments, BrainFree, which delivered mid-s singledigit total payment volume growth and is now consistently contributing to transaction margin dollar growth. Management plans to expand PSP segment into physical retail during Q4 through the Verafhone Partnership. Five, buy now pay later continues to perform well and management plans to lean into it even further in coming years. Buy now pay later is expected to reach 40 billion in total payment volume for the full year growing to more than 20% year-over-year and outpacing the broader market with economics on par with or better than peers. Management continues to see buy now pay later drive a meaningful uplift in overall user enga activity and engagement similar to what is observed with Venmo and PayPal debit cards. Six times the transaction frequency and three times average revenue per account. They view buy now pay later as a generational shift in consumer behavior that PayPal is well positioned to lead. Looking ahead, PayPal will expand BNPL into new geographies and product offerings in 2026, having launched in Canada last week and set to extend its reach across Europe. Six, Venmo's total payment volume, TPV, increased 14% year-on-year, accelerating from 12% last quarter and marking the fourth straight quarter of double digit growth. Fully year revenue is on track to reach 1.7 billion, up 20%. Venmo's revenue is up 20% year-onear and 10 percentage points above uh 2023's growth rate. Management believes Venmo is still in the early innings of monetization driven by pay with Venmo monthly activities up 25% and the Venmo debit card monthly activity up 40% and over 1 million first-time users added in Q3 through college partnerships. For the 66 million monthly active accounts, ARPA is greater than $25 and growing mid- teens with management seeing massive room for monetization as ARPA remains 1/3 to 1/4 of peers 75 to $100. If ARPA reaches peer levels and the MAA base remains flat, currently plus 7% year-over-year, Venmo could generate 4.95 to 6.6 billion in annual revenue over time. Venmo is just scratching the surface. Seven branded experience which include PayPal buy now pay later Venmo and did debit card programs saw total payment volume grow 8% year-on-year led by the US with 10% growth more than double last year's rate. Growth was largely driven by omni channel initiatives such as debit and tap to pay which delivered 65% total payment volume growth and continued to scale globally. brand to check out TPV still grew 5% during the quarter despite a choppy macro environment while PayPal saw less pressure from Asia-based marketplaces selling into the US. This was partially offset by softer consumer discretionary spending in the US in in Europe and the US later in the quarter. Eight management once again raised its fullear guidance following a hike last quarter, lifting non-GAAP EPS guidance to a midpoint of 537 compared to 465 last year and initial guidance of 503, up 15.6% year-over-year and 6.9% above initial guidance. In addition, management increased transaction margin dollar guidance to 15.45 to 15.55 billion. That's up five to 6% year-on-year growth, up from initial range of 15.2 to 15.4 billion provided at the start of the year. Nine transaction margin dollars excluding interest on customer balances increased 7% during the quarter to 3.6 billion and remains on pace for 67% growth for the full year. Most importantly, management reiterated confidence in achieving high singledigit transaction margin dollar growth over the long term. and 10 total active accounts increased 1% year-over-year to 438 million total active accounts and rose onetenth of 1% compared to Q2 reaching a record high. Monthly active accounts grew 2% to 227 million supported by strength across both PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Most importantly, transactions per active account excluding PSP increased 5% year-over-year. Here are the key points from the earnings call highlighted for you. Uh and then as we move on to market, fear and greed still at fear. Active investment managers still a little over their skis. Let's see how this plays out. S&P earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised up 25 basis points uh or one fourth of 1% for for 2026 with the Russell small caps. That's a lot higher. Top 30 weights revised up. Earnings power is going to be 4.24% greater than they thought 60 days ago. Economic data, we don't have a ton of it. Government still shut down. uh so to be determined earnings growth as I said was 9.2% that is above the 8% estimates usually your 3% this is only 1.2 to 1.3% above estimates.

I love these kind of\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nBig drops for VFC, Hormell, and Etsy this week. Are you buying more or still above your cost basis? Um, we're massively above our cost basis on Etsy. Our average cost is about $50 a share. Uh, that'll settle out in the next few days. Hormemell, same story. We're going to cover that one big next week. And VF Corp, uh, hope we can buy a lot more. I hope it gets weaker in the next few days. Uh, but we have not done anything on any of those. patience sitting on our hands and waiting to pounce like an animal when the time presents itself. So, if you think I'm just watching paint dry, you're right. And when I get active, you are going to see a flurry of dings on your phone. Uh all the clients sitting there looking, why does he have all that cash sitting there? And why don't I have any margin drawn? H you'll find out. Uh let's see. Yeah, I mean the problem with Portillos's is the revenues seem to be stalling. The margins are continue to go down. Uh and the free cash flow is negative. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. And uh here you just have to see if um if they live another day. See, this is the main issue. They've got not a lot of cash on the balance sheet and they have so the current portion is 6 million. Long-term debt is 240. It's it's a little levered for for my liking and uh the return on capital is dimminimous. This is a trading vehicle. It's a binary outcome. Um, it can work. It's It's not catching my It's not something, you know, the two filters we have are number one, if JP Morgan was going to finance us to buy the entire company with the caveat that we had to be 100% of the equity with 100% of our net worth. I.e., if it works, we'd make a 10 or 20 bagger because there's such a small slug of equity. If it fails, we lose everything and go apply for a job as a greeter at Walmart. Um, if we wouldn't do that deal, we won't buy one share. And this is not a slam dunk enough for me to uh to cover to to want to buy the whole company. So therefore, I won't buy one share. That doesn't mean it's not going to double or triple. It just means there's not enough margin of safety. And the second is if we were to go in and to the board of directors and uh tell them we'd like to buy the entire company at the price that it was quoted in the market today, would they have us escorted out by security? And if the answer is no, they would entertain the offer. We won't do it. I think at these levels they would potentially call security and say, \"Get this schmuck out of here. We're not selling the whole company at $5 a share.\" But I don't know. But it doesn't pass both filters. So therefore, uh we wouldn't invest. Um and again, that doesn't mean it won't work because it might. Is this something you throw in your PA like a like a uh you know lottery ticket? But I I I just don't mess around with that. So, uh I think you're probably correct and we wouldn't be involved. Uh Clorox, we we're okay with Caleb. We've covered that one in recent weeks. Everyone keeps asking me about FServe.

Oh, I'm not going to repeat all the praise and thanks you get everywhere. Just want you to know you become my role model over the past 12 months. Uh that I've been following the podcast. That's very very kind. Um I'm trying to make you think for yourself and if you if I do that, that's key. I don't need to be a role model. I just want to put out a lot of good and uh uh let that take care of itself and I'm glad you're getting value. Uh Teloflex TFX. All right, let's have a look. I think you might be a little early on this, but let's have a look. So, cash flow's going down, revenues have been flat, return on invested capital's flat, margins are flat. Uh let's see the balance sheet 1.8 billion. It's a little bit more levered than I'd like to see, but not the end of the world. income statement single-use med medical devices. Um, yeah, this one's worth doing more work. I like your framework. I would like to see some recovery and free cash flow. It's negative right now. Not in love with that. I want to see an inflection of that, but it's it's definitely worth starting to do some work. Elon Patrick, love your take on Zoom. I'm not against it. I'm just not going to be involved in it. I'll leave it at that. I'm not convinced the moat is strong enough, but they do have some proprietary products that are interesting. Uh I don't think you're going to get hurt. I just don't think you're going to make as much money as you think. Hess, this is just a dividend play. It's not interesting enough. You're not going to get a double and you're buying it for this yield. which is 8% yield. There are better uses of capital. Not not really for me. Um, Eric Thomas, thank you for the content. Would love to hear your opinion on Comcast. I don't have any interest in that. Um, I I can't envision I I think it's probably going to be okay when they break up the parts, but I mean, you got SpaceX. I I think that model is at risk and I I'm not smart enough to figure it out, so it just goes into two hard box and I pass on it. Roman Chennowith, silver miners as a leverage play on the debasement trade. I think it's um I think I covered it with David Lynn. Uh no matter how well the metals do, the miners seem to figure out a way to it up. Excuse my language, but um they'll work until they don't. They work for five minutes and then they uh a Y a SF By the way, the fact that the trade has a name means you're too late for it. So, I I wouldn't I wouldn't screw around there. Just buy good companies. If the dollar gets to base, you'll just get more of them if your company provides enough value in their respective sector. Like Buffett said, doesn't matter if we trade in dollars or sea shells or coins or uh bitcoins or uh whatever. If you provide the best sneakers at the best price at the right time, like Vans, uh, or you, um, provide the best payment services like PayPal, or you provide the best planes like Boeing, you're going to get the most of whatever is on call. And that's something you have control over. You guessing on how far you get to base. when you've got record revenues in the Treasury at 30 billion a month on the uh Treasury yields, record tax revenues coming in from profits, uh balanced budget on the way. Uh yeah, I I I'd be careful of that. Um but we do believe the dollar is going lower over the next few years because it runs in cycles and we were very minority position on that just a short while ago. Thank you for an impact you've had on my career. I've been listening since 2021. Curious if you ever use thirdparty research or consulting firms for tailored diligence or market studies on ideas. I guess absolutely not, but it came to mind when you say quote do private equity investing in the public markets. I don't know why that would come to mind based on that quote, but uh let me read further. I've always found it ironic that PE and hedge funds tout their investing edge yet pay firms like BCG and or McKenzie $1 million for 200page deck to validate their thesis. I don't know what firms you're working for, but um they sound like losers to me, but um uh no, we don't do that. We do our own work and um and we have our internal framework that we believe provides a specific edge for the specific style of investing we do. And we don't get distracted by shiny objects or other lanes. We have one narrow lane that we're very good at and we stay in it and we mastered it. So, um, you know, we just don't deviate. And, uh, and then, you know, you get tailwinds when it's really super duper amazingly, uh, in style. And then other tailwinds where you just do good work and even if it's out of style, you can make money because turnarounds are turnarounds. And if all the factors come together, irrespective of what the market's doing, you're going to get your doubles and triples over a few years. Uh, and rinse and repeat. So, um, no, we don't pay Mckenzie And when we see a CEO come in who had been, uh, from them, uh, we're, you know, generally, um, it's, we'll leave it there. All right. So, uh, Zachary Chinard, big thanks to you and your podcast. I live in Boston, student at Nor Eastern. Your podcast has taught me so much over the last handful of months after a friend recommended your show. Thank you very much. Uh, whenever I get a notification posted a new video, I drop everything to watch it. That's very kind. Want to know your opinions on Progress Software Corporation. Okay, you got it, Zachary. Uh, PRGS. Now, as a rule, we tend to stay away from software because the modes can be impaired pretty quickly. This is probably one that's been hit by um AI threats. I think it's probably at a level where it's looking interesting, but you have to be damn sure that they cannot be disintermediated either by AI or their mo being breached by a competitor and that is very hard to be certain about when it comes to software. Uh revenues have been declining. I'm sorry, that's free cash flow. Revenues are still doing fine. Well, multiple what do they do? AI powered CA applications and digital experiences, DevOps, software automation. I mean, if you can understand what they do and you can be damn certain that they have a moat, it's probably a decent buying area. But, um, that's a very hard space to be certain about, which is why Buffett never touched it. But I all the other things line up. It's just you better be damn certain about the moat. Terry Smith, love the show as always. You're my inspiration why I decide what to purchase. Well, inspiration, but then do the perspiration and do the work behind it. Please look at CAG. I think we have and I think we were good with it in the last few weeks. Yeah, I think this one's going to be okay.

It's medical devices. is this is a space I want to start to get more and more exposure. Yeah, free cash flow is getting crushed too and revenues. So, you got to see some signs of a turnaround. Free cash flow last quarter started to look better. What about revenues? What about balance sheet? Looks pretty good. Looks good. Yeah, I think you just really want to study their products and understand if they have an actual moat or a potential breach to the moat, medical products based on radio frequency. So, just understand and see if it's durable. But leaving that aside, let's see. Probably not going to get too hurt with this one. It's absolutely left for dead.

That's why you see tech up big today. But I think we got a lot more to focus on on earnings this week . That's going to be the real tell. Yeah, we'll get to earnings and uh and discuss that in just a bit, but this confirms I guess partly confirms the theory that every time a new tariff is announced, that's just a buying opportunity. Do you buy that? Until it's not. But yeah, I mean, look, as you know, we've been excessively bullish when other people were bearish. Uh and that's now going back, you know, multiple years through the fall of 2022. We did get a little cautious this month. Uh we built up a little bit of cash. we have no margin uh and and uh we'll see if that proves to be correct uh and if we get a buying opportunity before the final year end rally or if this just keeps pushing higher. But a lot of this has been retail driven. You're seeing it in option flow. You're seeing it in uh triple and uh 5x leveraged ETFs uh and all the craziness that's coming with that. But uh I think when all is said and done, David, price is what you pay, value is what you get. And I think uh this is the moment of truth this week and and we're going to uh dissect some of that uh in the imminent earnings in in coming days.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what are the drivers of key drivers of multiple expansion now going into 2026 now? Well, usually you get multiple expansion when you get growth expansion and uh this ca this time is different so to speak. So far, uh what we're going to see uh as we saw with Netflix and Tesla, the first two kind of mag 7 plus that reported was uh some concerns about margin compression. Uh and you saw Netflix down pretty big off of that. Tesla was a little bit uncertain off of that. And if we look yearonear, David, uh, MAG7 earnings growth is, uh, decelerating from 32% in Q3 of 2024 to what's expected to be 14% in Q3 of 2025. So, uh, a havinging of earnings growth and yet the multiple for the MAG7 basket has stayed well above 30 times. It's usually the opposite. when you see earnings growth decelerate uh you see multiple compression not multiple maintenance or multiple uh expansion. So you know uh max 7 $400 billion of committed capex uh this this year which is a 67% increase uh from last year and so far very little evidence of return on invested capital which is why you're seeing earnings growth contract. Uh that's going to impact margins that as you saw with Tesla and Netflix that's going to impact buyback ability which impacts EPS. So uh will the market continue to assign a very high growth multiple to a group that is decelerating in earnings growth uh at present? And and uh the answer is we're going to find out on Wednesday and Thursday. Right now there seems to be a trend that the tech companies are spending a lot on capex. In fact it's considerably more uh considerably higher margin on capex than the other S&P 500s companies. And so Thomas, the question is whether or not uh this trend has actually been pushing up the entire stock market. And as soon as maybe they stop spending money for whatever reason, that's when we get a slowdown. Well, there t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally",

We saw uh some of our Chinese holdings were up huge overnight. Babo's up three 3% in change. the BU of the world were up 5%. So the market is saying this looks money good. Um we will find out for sure on Thursday. You never know uh with with President Trump's negotiations. Sometimes at the last minute he'll throw a curveball to get a little bit more for the American people. But on balance that that looks very good. That's constructive. That's why you see tech up big today. But I think we got a lot more to focus on on\n\nwhat are the drivers of key drivers of multiple expansion now going into 2026 now? Well, usually you get multiple expansion when you get growth expansion and uh this ca this time is different so to speak. So far, uh what we're going to see uh as we saw with Netflix and Tesla, the first two kind of mag 7 plus that reported was uh some concerns about margin compression. Uh and you saw Netflix down pretty big off of that. Tesla was a little bit uncertain off of that. And if we look yearonear, David, uh, MAG7 earnings growth is, uh, decelerating from 32% in Q3 of 2024 to what's expected to be 14% in Q3 of 2025. So, uh, a havinging of earnings growth and yet the multiple for the MAG7 basket has stayed well above 30 times. It's usually the opposite. when you see earnings growth decelerate uh you see multiple compression not multiple maintenance or multiple uh expansion. So you know uh max 7 $400 billion of committed capex uh this this year which is a 67% increase uh from last year and so far very little evidence of return on invested capital which is why you're seeing earnings growth contract. Uh that's going to impact margins that as you saw with Tesla and Netflix that's going to impact buyback ability which impacts EPS. So uh will the market continue to assign a very high growth multiple to a group that is decelerating in earnings growth uh at present? And and uh the answer is we're going to find out on Wednesday and Thursday. Right now there seems to be a trend that the tech companies are spending a lot on capex. In fact it's considerably more uh considerably higher margin on capex than the other S&P 500s companies. And so Thomas, the question is whether or not uh this trend has actually been pushing up the entire stock market. And as soon as maybe they stop spending money for whatever reason, that's when we get a slowdown. Well, there is  something to be said for that. Um I you know, it's interesting. The mark the stock S&P is up around 41% off the April 7th trough. uh 27% of the Russell 3000 uh is only up 10% or less since the April 7th trough, which tells you we've we've basically been in the camp that maybe the MAG 7 needs to stall for a bit on the basis of earnings growth deceleration and high multiples. However, it doesn't mean everything has to do poorly. Uh maybe the the answer is an abrupt shift into those stocks that have been left for dead that are not the AI cost centers like the Mag 7, but the AI beneficiaries that that uh benefit from the technology and have margin expansion without massive amounts of investment like you're seeing across the Mag 7. So, so we could see that type of shift. And then you look, we're in uh the final week of October, David, this is the end of tax law selling for mutual funds. Uh and often times the stocks that have done worst year to date going into the end of October tend to do extremely well uh in November once that tax law selling pressure is in the rear view mirror. And so now with AI and full swing on everyone's radars, what uh what are some sectors or plays that investors can take? Are we looking at hyperscalers, uh, construction companies around that are involved with data centers? Are we looking at the big mag 7 companies themselves? Um, or anything on the periphery? How are you doing this? Uh, we've always looked to find, uh, the derivative plays. So, uh, one of the holdings that we've had that has been tremendously unpopular was Alibaba. You couldn't give it away year two years ago. It it just kind of was left for dead. China was uninvestable. It turned out it was the cheapest AI play in the world when everyone was saying it was uninvestable at $60 a share. Now people are getting interested at $175 a share. Uh they had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet at that point. They were generating 25 billion of free cash flow. You couldn't give it away. So that was an easy one. That's just getting started. Alibaba is going to continue to press higher. So while everyone looks at uh Tesla trading at uh uh you know 13 times revenues and 200 times earnings, you can still get Alibaba at a low double digit multiple with a huge uh blue skies ahead. Uh the second way we played that was Intel. No one you couldn't give Intel away at $19. Now everyone wants it at $39. Intel was was easy peasy when the government stepped in to backs stop that. Uh the game became the US government decided we are not going to depend on Taiwan semiconductor for all the semiconductors in the world. We are going to stand up Intel and they're the only game in town in the US that was at the 10 yard line. Uh Gellzinger had actually put everything in place. It's just the board got antsy even though they authorized him to do everything uh because the stock price was down. So they got rid of Gellzinger. They brought in someone that even better Lip Bhan from Cadence Systems. He had a 68 plus bagger there. He did a huge turnaround uh at Cadence Design Systems and uh and he's going to do the exact same thing in Intel. So uh they got two tailwinds. One is advanced chip development uh at their fabs uh uh GPUs and three their uh two their legacy CPU business has started to recover aggressively. So that's already up double uh plus from the lows and uh I think it could double again over the next few years as as the advanced chip demand becomes um um basically unlimited and Taiwan semiconductor you know Nvidia's biggest problem uh in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand it's been for lack of supply because Taiwan semiconductors capped them at $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter with Intel getting into the advanced chip game that was huge uh easy way to play uh that AI play. And then\n\nwas comtock resources uh which is a natural gas play. Uh if you consider the data center demand for for the next handful of years going into 2020 2030 you look at some of the Goldman Sachs numbers triple digit increase uh 60% of that is going to be powered by natural gas and some time back you couldn't give these stocks away. Comtock resources is 75% owned by Jerry Jones. We built up a b position eight n $8 $9 $10 uh that's just getting started. It's one of the lowest cost producers of natural gas and that's going to be an AI beneficiary as well. So we're looking for the nonobvious ways, the ones that most of the lemon has not been most of the juice has not been squeezed out of the lemon where there's a lot lot of runway ahead and I and I don't see it as aggressively in the Mag 7. When you think about some of the names that I've mentioned, uh, with, um, uh, you know, BABA tripling off almost tripling off the lows, we think that can double again. Intel doubling off the lows, we think that could double or triple from here. Uh, comtock resources, uh, double off the lows, we think that can double again. I don't think you can say that about too many of the mag seven stocks that you expect them to double over the next few years, uh, or could double or triple. Uh I think that would be pretty aggressive relative to a decelerating growth rate and a monstrous amount of capex required uh and a and a big prayer session that they're actually going to get a a sufficient return on invested capital uh prospectively and uh are you are you banking on energy companies being acquired by the tech companies? Microsoft for example is restarting a nuclear facility. Uh potentially they could go further into the vertical integration. What do you think? It's not out of the question. I don't think that's their highest and best use of the capital, but I I wouldn't rule it out. That's not in our thesis. The the name of the game is the demand is going to be there, and I think these energy companies know that. So, why would they want to sell out at historic low multiples? Speaking of energy, by the way, um in that basket of 27% of the Russell, that's only rebounded 10% off the uh April 7th lows while the market's up 41%. You got energy, you have real estate, and you have consumer staples, the ones that have been left for dead that I think you're you're going to see uh a bid. So, as it relates to energy, the the sector as a whole is at its lowest waiting in the S&P 500 since when? Since COVID 2020 lows. We made an absolute fortune buying am uh buying Exxon at $33 and change when oil was trading negative. We are in a position right now with some and I'm less sanguin, believe it or not, on the ENTP oil companies than I am on some of the servicesers. But we're in a position with the waiting so low. If you buy energy when they're this far out of favor, it's really, really hard not to make money. The only way you don't make money is if you buy lowquality stuff that has balance sheet risk. If you buy the highquality stuff uh at when when the waiting is this low in the in in the index uh you tend to make enormous amounts of money. The last time prior to co that the waiting got in similar low single digits was 20201 which was the last uh tech mania where you couldn't give away an energy stock and then the next 5 to seven years what outperformed uh energy did value did uh international did small caps did uh and I think we could see a similar situation not that tech has to crash but in terms of relative performance where's your opportunity and do you just chase the things that are already up a lot or do you look for things that can double and triple over three, four, five years? Going back to Intel uh and tax stocks overall, how do you feel about the government making equity stakes? We're making investments into companies themselves earlier in the summer. Intel announced that the Trump administration is placing an $ 8.9 billion investment into the company uh to make an agreement um and ex and and they'll help expand uh the company. Uh, how do you feel as an investor with the companies getting involved with the government? Well, I think people complicate the Intel deal. The the the problem with the Intel deal was the previous administration said, \"We're going to give you $9 billion because you're pathetic and we think we need we think we need you at some point.\" Trump comes in, he goes, \"Wait, we're giving them $8 billion for what? For failing?\" No, we're giving you $8 billion. We want something in return. This is not your money, Intel. This is the taxpayers's money. like they work, you know, four or five months of the year to pay the US government taxes, they're going to get something in return. So, not only are we going to stand you up, but we're going to give them equity. And then, just like President Trump, commander-in-chief, goes out and sells planes for Boeing, even though we have no equity stake in Boeing, he's going to go out. If you think he can sell planes for Boeing, wait till you see how many chips he sells for Intel. And you saw it that the next week Nvidia was asking Trump for favors to to be able to sell some of their chips in China. Guess what? They miraculously put a $5 billion investment in Intel. And then Soft Bank Masoshi's son uh put in a $2 billion investment in Intel. So this is in in terms of uh Trump demanding that US taxpayers get paid for c capital that was already committed. he is being a responsible steward of our tax dollars. Uh as it relates to these mineral right deals, um I'm less sanguin on that in terms of uh I don't want to see uh unlimited government uh interference because you know there was some rumors earlier like oh look how much uh how many contracts we're giving to these defense companies like Lockheed we should have equity in locked. I think that becomes a slippery slope and that's problematic. I think Intel was different. Uh he he walked into capital that had already been committed with no strings attached and he said, \"No, no, no, no. If you want the taxpayers's money, the taxpayer is going to get something for it.\" And um uh as it relates to the rest of them, the mineral rights, I think that's to be determined. uh uh we certainly need uh these these these specialized resources uh and to the extent that the private market can't sort it on its own. Could there be different deals done where the public sector comes to bear for national security reasons? Yes. Uh hopefully we can avoid those at all costs. But if absolutely necessary, I think it is something that needs to be done for national security. The stock's up roughly 60% since the deal was announced late August. I think as an investor, you're looking at this trend and saying to yourself, well, one of two things could happen. Either the government continues this trend. There were rumors that uh Trump wanted to make an uh investments into some um um some quantum computing companies that has been refuted by the Department of Commerce. Uh but anyway, if they do continue this trend, we could continue to see stocks being pumped up. But potentially the government may may misallocate company resources into things that some investors in those companies may not deem productive. So it's a double-edged sword. Uh what's the future here? What do you think? I think that the company's board of directors in each respective deal has the opportunity to say no. And what that simply means is we don't want your money and we don't want your strings. Uh but if they say we want your money, they should expect to have the strings attached to it. And that's you know that is t\n\nI think it's no different with the rare earths. I think it's no different. I mean, as far as the quantum computing stocks, that seemed like a little bit of silly season and a little bit worrisome. Fortunately, that that's not showing that uh that there's going to be any followthrough on that. But to the extent that it becomes uh a national security, look, you've got DARPA working on similar things. So maybe there will be more and more public private partnerships uh in the name of national security. But when it comes to investing money in a company andor taking equity or debt um uh the company will will uh companies will have the right to say say no or demand different terms and I think that's that's just the case. Now if the administration starts co-opting companies we haven't seen any evidence of that. uh uh that would be a different situation and uh and I think there would be a huge uh uprising against that type of behavior. Uh we haven't seen it to date. Uh and in terms of Intel, it's proven to be a success and I think it's going to make the taxpayer a tremendous amount of money over the next 5 years. It's going to be one of the best investments uh taxpayer money has ever been involved in. And if restrictions are placed on tech companies for exporting to China, for example, Nvidia, uh those restrictions were in place by Trump. But uh anyway, if they double down, the current administration doubles down, is that a sell-off uh kind of impetus for you? Look, I think I was against the restrictions uh that came came to bear by the previous administration. I mean, the previous administration's stance was China bad in every way under every circumstance. Let's not talk. Uh Trump is China's fine as long as they give us what we want. And if we can come to a deal where we make more money than we lose, then we love China. And if we can't, we'll isolate them. And um and go back to the China bad for every possible reason under the sun like the previous administration. Trump is willing to talk. Trump is willing to do a deal as long as Trump a aka America gets paid and benefits from it. As far as um refusing to export chips to China in the name of national security, I think it was the worst national security mistake uh we've seen in many many years. And the reason is is because China used to be dependent on us and they used to take what we would give them and they would take it with open arms and they would just funnel money into our coffers and create massive earnings power for the US companies. Now, we've said we're not going to allow you to give us unlimited amounts of money uh because we're not going to give you our chips in the name of national security. And what China has done is they have gone on to make uh incredible chips on their own. And on that basis, uh they've gone from being dependent to now being independent to now being in some areas superior. If you look at some of their large language models like Quen uh with Alibaba, like some of the uh chips that they're developing internally, uh we kind of let the genie out of the bottle. They they would have not been that far ahead on innovation had we continue to supply them and continue to keep them dependent on our technology. Now they're becoming independent and in some areas uh excelling beyond us. Okay, let's move on to uh the Fed. It's uh Fed week this week. Uh, importantly, Bessent has named top picks to replace uh, Jerome Powell. Um, Fed chair finalists are Christopher Waller, Kevin Walsh, uh, Kevin Hasset, Michelle Bowman, Rick Reer. Um, we we we have we have a short list now and um, no one's been confirmed yet, but it looks like everyone uh is, correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like everybody is supportive of much lower rates. Is that correct? I think everyone except for one is supportive of lower rates. I think Worsh has a history of being hawkish uh and he's playing the game that he's going to be cooperative in order to be given a serious consideration. I think it's not dissimilar to what we saw from Powell before he was confirmed. Uh that he seemed flexible and then the moment he came in, if you remember the autopilot comment in December of 2018 where he basically crashed the market before Christmas and um Minutian had to come in and uh convene a meeting of all the banks 3 days before Christmas on a Sunday to create liquidity and pump the market back up. Um, I think that uh uh Waller for sure, Bowman, uh, all of these are good. Worsh, uh, Reader, they're all s fantastic picks. I think Worsh um, uh, Worsh, you really run the risk of once he's in doing whatever the hell he wants. And, uh, I'm not saying he's not competent, he's very skilled. I he would be the wild card that I would be very concerned about in terms of maybe keeping things too restrictive too long, thinking he knows better uh and uh and maybe putting governors on the uh economy that that don't necessarily need to be there in the short term. So I think four out of five are phenomenal. Everyone I talked to loves Worsh. So maybe I'm missing something. But uh if you go back to his stances over, you know, decade plus, uh he's he's often been very very hawkish and and now he's kind of changed stripes uh in order to be in the mix. Uh this is I I love looking at um betting markets on issues. Who will Trump announce his Fed share in 2025? No announcement by December is the majority of votes. And if you actually look at who people are voting or betting on rather um Hassid is lightly leading Christopher Waller I mean it's pretty close when it comes to these uh the first two rather are pretty close. Uh so anyway if you had to if you had to put your money on and bet nobody knows but who who would you bet on? You know I I think any of those would be great. Uh I think Hassid or Worsh maybe Bowman. You know President Trump does like to appoint women to um positions. He's he's been one of the most pro- women, pro- diversity kind of administrations historically. Uh never gets any credit for that. I it wouldn't shock me if he put in Bowman, but I certainly think uh Waller, uh Worsh, all of those would be good choices. As far as whether he makes the announcements before December, that's going to be dependent on what Powell does. You know, if Powell cuts uh this week and he cuts in December, Trump is going to let him ride out like uh Seinfeld on top and uh let him let him have a kind of victory lap and let him go out with style. If he tries to choke things up uh by either not moving this week, which I think is unlikely, or uh not moving in December, I think at that point Trump will announce his, you know, top one or top two picks and make it clear to the market that uh that Powell is a lame duck until he he vacates his seat in 2026. But, uh, hopefully it'll be a cooperative policy, a progrowth policy from the Fed, uh, and, uh, Powell can go out and, um, and have a a, um, a favorable legacy. So, we're looking at at least a 25 basis point cut this week, Thomas. So, last time you were on the show, you mentioned to me that once unemployment ticks up, it's a very hard genie to put back in the bottle, I believe, words. And now we have 4.3%. Let me just double check. Yeah, 4.3% as of um Well, we have no idea. We have no data. So, that's right. That's that's And by the way, you know, t\n\nSo, we're looking at at least a 25 basis point cut this week, Thomas. So, last time you were on the show, you mentioned to me that once unemployment ticks up, it's a very hard genie to put back in the bottle, I believe, words. And now we have 4.3%. Let me just double check. Yeah, 4.3% as of um Well, we have no idea. We have no data. So, that's right. That's that's And by the way, you know, t\n\nthat thing called the uh we're we've got 27 days into a shutdown. Uh economies economists estimate 10 to 25 basis points a week for every week of the shutdown. Yes, it's earned back once it reopens, but uh no one's paying attention to it. I think the longer this thing drags on, if you get that coupled with uh mixed guidance with the MAG 7, uh I think you could find find ourselves uh maybe with a little bit of pullback. You know, ordinarily when you have these 15% plus mid-year corrections like we had in April and then you hit all-time highs, there's a secondary correction in that year that averages 6.4%. We haven't seen it yet. Is it coming? uh as a result of maybe some surprises this week. I don't know. Uh but any of those dips if we if they did materialize are to be bought because year to date we've got 312 going on 313 central bank cuts this year globally around the world which is the highest since the postgra financial crisis in 2009. So, there's a lot of liquidity slloshing around in the system. Uh, even if we get some short-term shocks, whether it's from the shutdown, whether it's from bank seven earnings, uh, or something else geopolitical or otherwise, uh, you know, as I said, we've been, you know, accused of being a perman permeable, and that's been right. We raised some cash this month. We're, you know, have zero margin effectively. Uh, and, uh, and we've been waiting for a pullback that may never come. uh which is fine. You know, there's also something to be said for locking in a huge year, but um we'd love to see some type of volatility that we could benefit from uh and then play into the year- end rally. So, we we'll see how that how that materializes. Well, how significant is the government shutdown on Fed policy decision-making? Because on the one hand, like you said, we don't have official unemployment data from the BLS, but we have we have other private uh data uh that's tracking u payrolls. Uh but on the other hand, we did get CPI released last week. And so, could the Fed just ignore unemployment for now and look at higher CPI print and maybe maybe slow down their uh their doubbishness? Is that possible? I I think it's a low probability that they don't move this week, but as as is the case with the Mag 7, uh the key is going to be the forward guidance. So, I think uh if if they they're not going to be immensely penalized for more hawkish than normal guidance if they cut. And so, what's the downside for them doing it? And I don't know that the market expects them to do it. So on that basis, I would say maybe that there's a surprise in that. Uh yeah, they cut 25 basis points and then they come out hawkish at the 230 meeting saying, you know, we don't have data. you know, inflation came in better than expected, but it's still a little more elevated than we would like to see or above target or some some type of language like that that the market maybe interprets as December off the table for the next, you know, few days and until they start to get employment numbers and realize, no, December is well on the table. Uh the labor market's a little bit weaker. I think um you know the sooner we get that employment data the the the clearer we're going to know the trajectory moving forward but uh the the trajectory moving forward is lower rates whether whether there's a pit stop in December or not um Trump has made it abundantly clear that the next Fed chair will will be dovish and uh so if if we pause for a couple months until Powell uh vacates then so be it. But uh I think everything is pointing toward uh lower and lower rates for the foreseeable future. Uh I want to close off uh Thomas on alternative assets. You and I haven't spoken much about the precious metals, but it's become more of a mainstream topic in the last couple uh weeks to months. Um major banks JP Morgan are uh and Goldman Sachs are upping their gold forecast by the end of 2026. I believe Goldman has a $4,900 um outlook by the end of 2026. This is the price so far. The gold price has pulled back from its highs. Um this is kind of mirroring what happened in 2011. Anyway, do you have a view on this asset? Do you have an allocation to it? Have you allocated more uh on this really historical uh rally? It's up more than uh let me just get the exact number here to the peak. It's up more than 60% year to date. Okay. So, you know what's interesting about gold is that it's a non-productive asset. So, when people say, \"Oh my gosh, gold is the greatest thing that's ever.\" Look, it's up 61%. Do you know how many stocks are up o, you know, over 60% this year, like while everyone was focused on gold, uh the amount of stocks that you could have bought in the April trough that are up double and triple already is unlimited. uh relative to gold. So spending your time on an asset that you're buying in hopes that people will come behind you and and push it higher based on demand for fear or geopolitical or debasement trade. Uh look, if you get the basement, it's like Warren Buffett said, whether we get paid in dollars or seashells or shekels or whatever, if you're buying a business that provides value to the marketplace, you're going to command the most of those seashells, shekels, gold coins. it it it it's really immaterial. The key is buy a productive asset and if there's a debasement trade, you'll just get more shekels per value provided and uh and and find great companies when they're temporarily impaired. And doubles and triples over a 3 to 5 year period are relatively easy to find if you have a solid framework. As far as gold, you're you're effectively guessing. I think the theme is correct that the dollar is going to trend weaker over time, in which case uh gold in theory should should remain elevated. But why, you know, why play that game when when there's so many other opportunities where you actually have uh some level of control over analyzing the forward cash flows and what you'd be willing to pay for those forward cash flows versus just hoping there are other buyers coming in behind you. So, uh to those who have allocation and have been gold bugs for the last 20 years and now have their day in the sun, you know, congratulations. Uh this is the day you've been waiting for. Uh, you know, like they say, the most expensive drink in the casino is the free drink because it means you're still at the table. So, take a few chips off the table. Take your free drink. Uh, maybe let a few chips ride if that's your game, but uh uh beware because uh the clock strikes 12 and uh we'll we'll see if Cinderella uh does okay. couple years ago, Berkshire Hathaway did own Barrett Gold for a few months, I believe, until they sold it off and uh the play there and Warren Buffett has never liked gold as a as a bullion uh mainly for the reasons that you've talked about. Uh but he did buy a minor. Are you would you consider a minor if the free cash flow is extraordinarily strong at current gold prices? If I'm not saying they will be, but you know, if Yeah. No, I I I have found that the miners, no matter how high the price of the underlying asset goes, they they somehow figure out a way to lose money. Like invariably, uh maybe they get a quarter or two where they generate free cash and everyone says, \"Oh, this time is different.\" But somehow that mining business is a really difficult business. I don't think that was Warren himself. I think that was his uh Todd or Ted. Uh and you see these tiny little positions come and go kind of trading. There's never been a Warren Buffett. there never will. We're seeing that. Um uh and uh and I I could almost guarantee that wasn't Warren's decision. Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much, Thomas. We'll we'll end it here. And uh please do follow Hedge Fund Tips. Very good uh resource, good summary of the news as well as um um other information and analysis and charts. Uh Thomas, where else can we follow you? Yeah, hedge fun.com is the best place. then you could subscribe to our uh uh weekly podcast there.

I don't think that was Warren himself. I think that was his uh Todd or Ted.\n\n you want to be more diversified. And if you're in the S&P saying you're diversified, you're not. You're basically in a MAG 7 index. Uh which um uh as we're seeing here with Meta and uh Netflix and all these the spending's up, the margins are contracting and the multiple hasn't come down. that's going to change. Uh and uh and I think we're seeing the early stages of of that right now. So um US equity leadership cycles and peaks, US versus developed markets that is now rolling over. USA versus emerging markets now rolling over. You can see these past peaks and then you get periods of the opposite um where emerging markets start to outperform relative to US and international relative. We're seeing it this year. uh medium forward returns and win ratios after high beta 5day decline to 10%. So this implies 7,300. I agree with 7,300. I just think it's a next year phenomenon, not a this year phenomenon.  bankruptcy filing filings are falling as spreads tighten. That's positive thing to see. And then so credit spreads are still tightening. That'll be good for Cooper Standard to refinance their debt.  emerging market stock index, third highest level in 37year history, looks like it's going to break out. There's usually no such thing as a triple top.  S&P 500 post election cycle versus 2025.  next year also should have some chop which benefits stock picking because the indices slow down.

That'll be good for Cooper Standard to refinance their debt. uh emerging market stock index, third highest level in 37year history, looks like it's going to break out. There's usually no such thing as a triple top. Uh so this cycle that everyone uh said would never happen a couple years ago, pounding the table, is now happening in spades. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nS&P 500 post election cycle versus 2025. Uh that's for this year implies some short-term volatility. Uh yeah, next year also should have some chop which benefits stock picking because the indices slow down. Wage growth is outpacing home price inflation.\n\nbeginning to pay attention to the innovation that has been right in front of it all along. The flurry of deals we have seen recently is case in point. First came the agentic commerce deal with Perplexity back in May. Few weeks ago, it was a multi-year digital commerce deal with Google that cements PayPal as a key PSP across payment service provider across Google products. Earlier this week, they partnered with Mastercard to advance secure agentic commerce. And on the same day, integrated Venmo across the entire built ecosystem to allow users to pay rent or mortgages through Venmo. The list goes on. Then came the whipped cream and cherries on the top. Right before earnings, PayPal announced a deal with Open AAI to become the first payments wallets integrated directly into ChatGpt. We already knew Alex Chris and Sam Alman had a relationship going back to Alman's Worldcoin days, which we flagged on this podcast weeks ago. So, this partnership was something we had a feeling might come together at this at some point. All of this ties back to our broader AI beneficiary investment thesis that we have discussed in recent podcasts and articles. Rather than owning the companies forced to pick up the AI tab and erode earnings in the process, we prefer to own the beneficiaries of AI in the unmnificent 493 trading at much lower multiples with accelerating earnings and let the hyperscalers pick up the tab. We get a free ride on their coattails, capturing all the upside without spending a dime. Going back to PayPal, the point is simple. This company is back in growth mode. We've highlighted the key points from the uh uh chat GPT article and from the earnings breakdown and put stars next to the super important points uh and the deck and the uh earnings call transcript I believe. Let's see. Yes. Uh so here are the 10 key points. Number one, PayPal reported net revenue of 8.4 billion for the quarter. up 7% year-on-year, beating Wall Street cont consensus by approximately $182 million. Non-Gap EPS also came in well ahead of expectations, rising 12% year-over-year to 1.34 and beating consensus by 13 cents. Number two, during the quarter, management returned $ 1.5 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 21 million shares of common stock at an average price of $71. So, for all those whiny little that were saying pain pal, pain pal, and didn't know what they owned because they're worried about the price versus the value of the stock, uh, guess who you were selling to? Not only me, but you were also selling to Alex Chris with the company buying back your shares and taking you out of your stock on a trailing 12-month basis. This brings the total repurchase to 5.7 billion or 78 million shares, reducing the weighted average share count by 6%. In addition to buybacks, PayPal announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend, declaring a dividend of 14 cents per share and targeting a 10% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Most importantly, this new dividend does not impact the company's share repurchase program and is intended to complement it with management maintaining its long-term framework of returning 70 to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. the vast majority through buybacks and targeting $6 billion in repurchases for the full year. Three, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was 2.3 billion, up 48%. Let me say that again. Free cash flow was 2.3 billion for the quarter, up 48% year-over-year. This reminds me of PayPal. This reminds me of Alibaba at $60 when you couldn't give it away and they were generating over $20 billion of free cash flow per year. And you can't make this stuff up. uh bringing the year-to- date free cash flow to 4.3 billion. Management reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to seven billion which would mark a record high and imply 11% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Four, the payment service provider segment has now turned the corner after lapping the quote firing of unprofitable customers with total payment volume up 6% year-over-year and accelerating from 2% growth in the prior quarter. This includes enterprise payments, BrainFree, which delivered mid-s singledigit total payment volume growth and is now consistently contributing to transaction margin dollar growth. Management plans to expand PSP segment into physical retail during Q4 through the Verafhone Partnership. Five, buy now pay later continues to perform well and management plans to lean into it even further in coming years. Buy now pay later is expected to reach 40 billion in total payment volume for the full year growing to more than 20% year-over-year and outpacing the broader market with economics on par with or better than peers. Management continues to see buy now pay later drive a meaningful uplift in overall user enga activity and engagement similar to what is observed with Venmo and PayPal debit cards. Six times the transaction frequency and three times average revenue per account. They view buy now pay later as a generational shift in consumer behavior that PayPal is well positioned to lead. Looking ahead, PayPal will expand BNPL into new geographies and product offerings in 2026, having launched in Canada last week and set to extend its reach across Europe. Six, Venmo's total payment volume, TPV, increased 14% year-on-year, accelerating from 12% last quarter and marking the fourth straight quarter of double digit growth. Fully year revenue is on track to reach 1.7 billion, up 20%. Venmo's revenue is up 20% year-onear and 10 percentage points above uh 2023's growth rate. Management believes Venmo is still in the early innings of monetization driven by pay with Venmo monthly activities up 25% and the Venmo debit card monthly activity up 40% and over 1 million first-time users added in Q3 through college partnerships. For the 66 million monthly active accounts, ARPA is greater than $25 and growing mid- teens with management seeing massive room for monetization as ARPA remains 1/3 to 1/4 of peers 75 to $100. If ARPA reaches peer levels and the MAA base remains flat, currently plus 7% year-over-year, Venmo could generate 4.95 to 6.6 billion in annual revenue over time. Venmo is just scratching the surface. Seven branded experience which include PayPal buy now pay later Venmo and did debit card programs saw total payment volume grow 8% year-on-year led by the US with 10% growth more than double last year's rate. Growth was largely driven by omni channel initiatives such as debit and tap to pay which delivered 65% total payment volume growth and continued to scale globally. brand to check out TPV still grew 5% during the quarter despite a choppy macro environment while PayPal saw less pressure from Asia-based marketplaces selling into the US. This was partially offset by softer consumer discretionary spending in the US in in Europe and the US later in the quarter. Eight management once again raised its fullear guidance following a hike last quarter, lifting non-GAAP EPS guidance to a midpoint of 537 compared to 465 last year and initial guidance of 503, up 15.6% year-over-year and 6.9% above initial guidance. In addition, management increased transaction margin dollar guidance to 15.45 to 15.55 billion. That's up five to 6% year-on-year growth, up from initial range of 15.2 to 15.4 billion provided at the start of the year. Nine transaction margin dollars excluding interest on customer balances increased 7% during the quarter to 3.6 billion and remains on pace for 67% growth for the full year. Most importantly, management reiterated confidence in achieving high singledigit transaction margin dollar growth over the long term. and 10 total active accounts increased 1% year-over-year to 438 million total active accounts and rose onetenth of 1% compared to Q2 reaching a record high. Monthly active accounts grew 2% to 227 million supported by strength across both PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Most importantly, transactions per active account excluding PSP increased 5% year-over-year. Here are the key points from the earnings call highlighted for you. Uh and then as we move on to market, fear and greed still at fear. Active investment managers still a little over their skis. Let's see how this plays out. S&P earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised up 25 basis points uh or one fourth of 1% for for 2026 with the Russell small caps. That's a lot higher. Top 30 weights revised up. Earnings power is going to be 4.24% greater than they thought 60 days ago. Economic data, we don't have a ton of it. Government still shut down. uh so to be determined earnings growth as I said was 9.2% that is above the 8% estimates usually your 3% this is only 1.2 to 1.3% above estimates. So,\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is where you are with Sprouts Farmers Market. You are right here in subtle warning, overt warning, and you're nowhere even near panic. Then you a year from now, you'll be in discouragement. And maybe if the business lives, you'll get to start to get back to anxiety, aversion, denial, and then returning confidence. But you're three years off from that. That one hasn't even begun. Um, I think that is Oh, thoughts about Boston Beer Company. No, I have no interest in that.

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI'm pleased to welcome back Thomas Hayes. He's the managing member of Great Hill Capital and also uh the author of Hedge Fund Tips. Check it out. very good resource online for all investors. We'll be talking about uh the Fed, what are they going to do this week? We'll do a preview. We'll talk about a potential China deal. Stocks are up to date on Monday on uh a potential and of course uh earning season is upon us. Welcome back to the show, Thomas.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nSo risk on day uh new records on stocks on Monday after China and the US officials cool tensions over the weekend according to reports. Um now no official deal has been ironed out as far as I'm reading. Uh but I think there's a there's a framework that's being discussed. I think we have a very successful framework for the leaders to discuss on Thursday said Treasury Secretary Scott Passent. Um yeah, this is days away from November 1st, which is the day that uh Trump said initially said would be the start date for new 100% tariffs on China. So I guess we're not seeing that anymore, Thomas. Yeah, look, you have, as you said, Besson said we have a successful framework. The Chinese counterpart said we have a preliminary consensus. We saw uh some of our Chinese holdings were up huge overnight. Babo's up three 3% in change. the BU of the world were up 5%. So the market is saying this looks money good. Um we will find out for sure on Thursday. You never know uh with with President Trump's negotiations. Sometimes at the last minute he'll throw a curveball to get a little bit more for the American people. But on balance that that looks very good. That's constructive. That's why you see tech up big today. But I think we got a lot more to focus on on earnings this week . That's going to be the real tell. Yeah, we'll get to earnings and uh and discuss that in just a bit, but this confirms I guess partly confirms the theory that every time a new tariff is announced, that's just a buying opportunity. Do you buy that? Until it's not. But yeah, I mean, look, as you know, we've been excessively bullish when other people were bearish. Uh and that's now going back, you know, multiple years through the fall of 2022. We did get a little cautious this month. Uh we built up a little bit of cash. we have no margin uh and and uh we'll see if that proves to be correct uh and if we get a buying opportunity before the final year end rally or if this just keeps pushing higher. But a lot of this has been retail driven. You're seeing it in option flow. You're seeing it in uh triple and uh 5x leveraged ETFs uh and all the craziness that's coming with that. But uh I think when all is said and done, David, price is what you pay, value is what you get. And I think uh this is the moment of truth this week and and we're going to uh dissect some of that uh in the imminent earnings in in coming days.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSo what are the drivers of key drivers of multiple expansion now going into 2026 now? Well, usually you get multiple expansion when you get growth expansion and uh this ca this time is different so to speak. So far, uh what we're going to see uh as we saw with Netflix and Tesla, the first two kind of mag 7 plus that reported was uh some concerns about margin compression. Uh and you saw Netflix down pretty big off of that. Tesla was a little bit uncertain off of that. And if we look yearonear, David, uh, MAG7 earnings growth is, uh, decelerating from 32% in Q3 of 2024 to what's expected to be 14% in Q3 of 2025. So, uh, a havinging of earnings growth and yet the multiple for the MAG7 basket has stayed well above 30 times. It's usually the opposite. when you see earnings growth decelerate uh you see multiple compression not multiple maintenance or multiple uh expansion. So you know uh max 7 $400 billion of committed capex uh this this year which is a 67% increase uh from last year and so far very little evidence of return on invested capital which is why you're seeing earnings growth contract. Uh that's going to impact margins that as you saw with Tesla and Netflix that's going to impact buyback ability which impacts EPS. So uh will the market continue to assign a very high growth multiple to a group that is decelerating in earnings growth uh at present? And and uh the answer is we're going to find out on Wednesday and Thursday. Right now there seems to be a trend that the tech companies are spending a lot on capex. In fact it's considerably more uh considerably higher margin on capex than the other S&P 500s companies. And so Thomas, the question is whether or not uh this trend has actually been pushing up the entire stock market. And as soon as maybe they stop spending money for whatever reason, that's when we get a slowdown. Well, there t\n\nretail percent of total cash market. Again, last peak was Jen 20 21. Fed balance sheet unwind could end as early as October. It's now going to end in December. Plenty more easing ahead in the pipeline. We agree. That's why we remain constructive intermediate term even though we're cautious short term. lot cattle starting to roll over. That could start to help um restaurant stocks. So, keep an eye on this. This was a big move this week. We've been waiting for 30-year fixed mortgages. Are we going to get below six before the end of the year? Number of 20% draw downs in the S&P 500 in the last seven and 10 years. Rolling 10 years. Rolling seven years. So, like I said, there's been a lot of pull forward. If it averages every 3 and a half years, we've had a lot, which is why I don't think we're getting another 20% anytime soon. I'm in the 4 to 9% camp. Uh, and we'll go from there. Uh, let's see here. We got quality factor. What do we have here? Consumer confidence survey. Current jobs availability, jobs plentiful. So that peaked in 2003 has been trending downward since jobs hard to find is starting to trend upward. Keeping an eye on that. ETF flows since September 24th. Rate cut. Starting to see a little bit into healthcare, a little bit into energy, a lot into industrials, tech, financials, same thing. Uh levered long AUM, relative inverse AUM is at a peak. Levered long these three and five times these are going to get a flushing. How much of the S&P is related to AI stocks? So again, it shows the concentration and so on.

Russell is uh uh this is trailing EPS relative to trailing EPS. Um the the key chart you want to look at is forward EPS with uh Russell this this quarter at 42% earnings growth uh small caps versus uh S&P. By the way, estimates were very close. You know, people keep talking about the beat rate. We usually beat by 3%. So far that is not the case. It was uh around 8% estimates. We're at 9%. Uh so we're seeing some of it today with um um Meta is down 8% after hours. So Mag 7 has been uh less than Google was good, Microsoft's down, Tesla was down, Netflix was down big. So, as expected, let's see if we get a little break in the indices here because uh we've had that cash ready to go and I think in the next few days and few weeks, we're going to be deploying all of it and getting back on a little bit of margin as well. Nothing crazy. We never go over 10 15%. But, uh I think we're going to be able to deploy a lot of cash in coming days and weeks. So, we're super excited because uh we got a little volatility in early October after we got cautious, but we really, you know, the market's just been kind of grinding, grinding, grinding and so much retail option flow. And I told you that t\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nRussell 2000 index relative to the S&P. Russell is uh uh this is trailing EPS relative to trailing EPS. Um the the key chart you want to look at is forward EPS with uh Russell this this quarter at 42% earnings growth uh small caps versus uh S&P. By the way, estimates were very close. You know, people keep talking about the beat rate. We usually beat by 3%. So far that is not the case. It was uh around 8% estimates. We're at 9%. Uh so we're seeing some of it today with um um Meta is down 8% after hours. So Mag 7 has been uh less than Google was good, Microsoft's down, Tesla was down, Netflix was down big. So, as expected, let's see if we get a little break in the indices here because uh we've had that cash ready to go and I think in the next few days and few weeks, we're going to be deploying all of it and getting back on a little bit of margin as well. Nothing crazy. We never go over 10 15%. But, uh I think we're going to be able to deploy a lot of cash in coming days and weeks. So, we're super excited because uh we got a little volatility in early October after we got cautious, but we really, you know, the market's just been kind of grinding, grinding, grinding and so much retail option flow. And I told you that there is  no way in hell those retail options are getting paid out. the 20 million contract uh 40 million contract a day of call options for 20 consecutive sessions. Those are going to expire worthless and we are going to benefit from uh some weakness here to get the remaining cash and excess margin availability to work before end of year. Uh and we're super duper excited about it. Um crowded short interest sometimes creates huge rallies. Uh yes, that is correct. And what he's speaking to is what is Brent crude oil spot prices 52 increase decrease manage money short open interest. You can see they're super short at the lows in May 2017. Super short at the lows in uh uh 2000 June of 2020 and super short um uh right now. And I think we're going to start to see a lot of opportunity in oil. we've expressed through uh national oilco and comtock which by the way there was a full feature article on the wall street journal this afternoon which we'll touch on uh next largest stocks have underperformed over the last century by about 8% per year periodically uh periodically the largest stocks outperform in the last century this has happened five years or more seven times 10 years or more three times 15 years or more one time. The current outperformance is the second longest in the century at 10 and a half years. So you can see this is an extreme. It never ends well. Uh you want to be more diversified. And if you're in the S&P saying you're diversified, you're not. You're basically in a MAG 7 index. Uh which um uh as we're seeing here with Meta and uh Netflix and all these the spending's up, the margins are contracting and the multiple hasn't come down. that's going to change. Uh and uh and I think we're seeing the early stages of of that right now. So um US equity leadership cycles and peaks, US versus developed markets that is now rolling over. USA versus emerging markets now rolling over. You can see these past peaks and then you get periods of the opposite um where emerging markets start to outperform relative to US and international relative. We're seeing it this year. uh medium forward returns and win ratios after high beta 5day decline to 10%. So this implies 7,300. I agree with 7,300. I just think it's a next year phenomenon, not a this year phenomenon. Uh gold obviously everyone bought the top so now they're going to get punished. Uh top 10 US companies dominate US world equity market, country GDP, market cap index. We know all this uh uh 10 strongest buyers markets of September 2025. Um so the the the switch has flipped um in a lot of the hottest markets are now cooling and becoming buyers markets versus sellers markets. That was the opposite two years ago. Just the beginning. The affordability is going to happen. Everyone who said house prices are going to go up because rates go down are going to be wrong this time. What you're going to see is supply go through the roof and overwhelmed demand. Chart of the day shutdown drags on. Um this is uh whistling past the graveyard. Uh you know we're almost 30 days into this shutdown. That's somewhere between 40 to 100 basis points off of GDP. it'll be earned back if they stop it soon. But t\n\nbankruptcy filing filings are falling as spreads tighten. That's positive thing to see. And then so credit spreads are still tightening.

Wage growth is outpacing home price inflation.",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nwhat are the drivers of key drivers of multiple expansion now going into 2026 now? Well, usually you get multiple expansion when you get growth expansion and uh this ca this time is different so to speak. So far, uh what we're going to see uh as we saw with Netflix and Tesla, the first two kind of mag 7 plus that reported was uh some concerns about margin compression. Uh and you saw Netflix down pretty big off of that. Tesla was a little bit uncertain off of that. And if we look yearonear, David, uh, MAG7 earnings growth is, uh, decelerating from 32% in Q3 of 2024 to what's expected to be 14% in Q3 of 2025. So, uh, a havinging of earnings growth and yet the multiple for the MAG7 basket has stayed well above 30 times. It's usually the opposite. when you see earnings growth decelerate uh you see multiple compression not multiple maintenance or multiple uh expansion. So you know uh max 7 $400 billion of committed capex uh this this year which is a 67% increase uh from last year and so far very little evidence of return on invested capital which is why you're seeing earnings growth contract. Uh that's going to impact margins that as you saw with Tesla and Netflix that's going to impact buyback ability which impacts EPS. So uh will the market continue to assign a very high growth multiple to a group that is decelerating in earnings growth uh at present? And and uh the answer is we're going to find out on Wednesday and Thursday. Right now there seems to be a trend that the tech companies are spending a lot on capex. In fact it's considerably more uh considerably higher margin on capex than the other S&P 500s companies. And so Thomas, the question is whether or not uh this trend has actually been pushing up the entire stock market. And as soon as maybe they stop spending money for whatever reason, that's when we get a slowdown. Well, there is  something to be said for that. Um I you know, it's interesting. The mark the stock S&P is up around 41% off the April 7th trough. uh 27% of the Russell 3000 uh is only up 10% or less since the April 7th trough, which tells you we've we've basically been in the camp that maybe the MAG 7 needs to stall for a bit on the basis of earnings growth deceleration and high multiples. However, it doesn't mean everything has to do poorly. Uh maybe the the answer is an abrupt shift into those stocks that have been left for dead that are not the AI cost centers like the Mag 7, but the AI beneficiaries that that uh benefit from the technology and have margin expansion without massive amounts of investment like you're seeing across the Mag 7. So, so we could see that type of shift. And then you look, we're in uh the final week of October, David, this is the end of tax law selling for mutual funds. Uh and often times the stocks that have done worst year to date going into the end of October tend to do extremely well uh in November once that tax law selling pressure is in the rear view mirror. And so now with AI and full swing on everyone's radars, what uh what are some sectors or plays that investors can take? Are we looking at hyperscalers, uh, construction companies around that are involved with data centers? Are we looking at the big mag 7 companies themselves? Um, or anything on the periphery? How are you doing this? Uh, we've always looked to find, uh, the derivative plays. So, uh, one of the holdings that we've had that has been tremendously unpopular was Alibaba. You couldn't give it away year two years ago. It it just kind of was left for dead. China was uninvestable. It turned out it was the cheapest AI play in the world when everyone was saying it was uninvestable at $60 a share. Now people are getting interested at $175 a share. Uh they had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet at that point. They were generating 25 billion of free cash flow. You couldn't give it away. So that was an easy one. That's just getting started. Alibaba is going to continue to press higher. So while everyone looks at uh Tesla trading at uh uh you know 13 times revenues and 200 times earnings, you can still get Alibaba at a low double digit multiple with a huge uh blue skies ahead. Uh the second way we played that was Intel. No one you couldn't give Intel away at $19. Now everyone wants it at $39. Intel was was easy peasy when the government stepped in to backs stop that. Uh the game became the US government decided we are not going to depend on Taiwan semiconductor for all the semiconductors in the world. We are going to stand up Intel and they're the only game in town in the US that was at the 10 yard line. Uh Gellzinger had actually put everything in place. It's just the board got antsy even though they authorized him to do everything uh because the stock price was down. So they got rid of Gellzinger. They brought in someone that even better Lip Bhan from Cadence Systems. He had a 68 plus bagger there. He did a huge turnaround uh at Cadence Design Systems and uh and he's going to do the exact same thing in Intel. So uh they got two tailwinds. One is advanced chip development uh at their fabs uh uh GPUs and three their uh two their legacy CPU business has started to recover aggressively. So that's already up double uh plus from the lows and uh I think it could double again over the next few years as as the advanced chip demand becomes um um basically unlimited and Taiwan semiconductor you know Nvidia's biggest problem uh in terms of growth rate has not been for lack of demand it's been for lack of supply because Taiwan semiconductors capped them at $4 billion of revenue growth per quarter with Intel getting into the advanced chip game that was huge uh easy way to play uh that AI play.

Revenue came in at 13.65 billion, up 6% sequentially and 3% year-over-year, beating street estimates of 3.15 billion and topping management's prior guidance by about 600 million. Earnings per share of 23 cents came in well ahead of consensus at 01 and management guidance for break even results altogether. The quarter marked Intel's fourth consecutive beat on guidance and its first profit after six straight losses. the company's longest losing streak in 35 years. Fast forward to today and Intel now sits second only to AMD as the best performing AI name year to date, outperforming every Mag 7 stock that investors continue to clamor for. Washington couldn't let the future of advanced chipmunking rest in the hands of a single foreign company. Every major chip designer from Nvidia to AMD to Mag 7 names currently depends on the kindness of strangers for advanced foundry work. Jensen Wong didn't write a $5 billion check out of the kindness of his heart. He did it because his growth growth is capped at $4 billion a quarter at TSMC.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is nobody in the world that wants Intel to succeed more than Nvidia. Now that Intel has the world's best salesman on its payroll, aka Donald Trump, it won't be long before major clients start lining up for its foundry business between $5 billion from Nvidia, 2 billion from SoftBank, and rumors and more partnership ahead. Talks with around an Apple investment, early discussions with AMD as a foundry customer, and a potential Microsoft deal. The pipeline is heating up fast, and if you think President Trump can sell Boeing planes, just wait till you see how many chips you can sell. In the end, we wouldn't be surprised if the $9 billion stake in the US taxpayer now holds in Intel goes down as the single greatest return on investment in taxpayer history. Keep in mind, while the\nheadlines around Intel focus on the foundry business and AI, our investment case from day one has always viewed those whipped cream and those as whipped cream and cherries on top. We underwrote the investment with three potential outcomes. Number one, Intel gets broken up or liquidated tomorrow. Book value were $22 a share. We'd come out whole. Two, Intel survives as a leader in mediocre chips, maintaining its legacy CPU and server business worth about $45 to $50 a share. Or three, Intel executes on its foundry business and AI vision worth $100 plus per share. In any of these scenarios, it's heads we win, tails we win, uh, win less, but still win. This all comes down to one simple principle and what Warren Buffett calls the three most important words in investing, margin of safety. When you know what you own and you don't let\n\nDuring the quarter, Intel also opened Fab 52 in Arizona, its fifth high volume fabrication facility, which is now fully operational. Seven management's confidence around 14A continues to grow, supported by encouraging engagement with external customers and positive early feedback yields on 14A are off to a strong start, showing significantly better performance at this stage of maturity maturity compared to where 18A yield stood at the same point. Intel plans to remain disciplined in adding capacity investing only when external customer demand is confirmed. Management noted they are heavily engaged in these discussions and are beginning to attract key process technology talent that can drive help drive long-term success. Eight adjusted gross margins came in at 40% for the quarter, up 22 percentage points year-over-year from an adjust from just 18% and four points above management's prior guidance. Hallelujah. The improvement was driven by higher revenue and a more favorable product mix partially offset by the early ramp for 18A and Lunar Lake. Nine management remains disciplined on reigning in operating expenses down to just 4.54 billion compared to 11.05 billion during the same period last year. Operating margins for the quarter stood at 11.2% up 22 percentage points year-on-year. Intel remains on track to rightsize the company by year end. target of 75,000 employees with a current employee headcount of 88,000 down from 124,000 during the same period last year and 10 for Q4 guidance. Management expects revenue of 12.8 billion to 13.8 billion which is roughly flat quarter over quarter when accounting for the Altera transaction and in line with Wall Street consensus of 13.4 billion. Management expects non-Gap EPS of8 uh 8 cents down 5 cents year-over-year and gross margins of approximately 36.5% down sequentially due to product mix and impact of initial ship shipments of Core Ultra 3.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally , we move on to PayPal update. As it turns out, old dogs can learn new tricks. When Alex Chris took over the reigns at the granddaddy of fintech a little over two years ago, he inherited a company that fall had fallen asleep at the wheel after riding the e-commerce boom during the pandemic. Prior, management had stopped innovating and tried to make up for it by spending billions on acquisitions that struggled to integrate. Growth was slowing, transactions margins were under pressure and the user base was declining. From day one, Alex Chris, who knew who we knew was a winner based on what he accomplished leading the small business group at into it, has been laser focused on getting PayPal pack PayPal back to what made it great in the first place, innovation. While his shock the world comment that many laughed at may have been a bit early, he has delivered on everything he said he would and more. Transaction margin dollar growth is back on pace for 6 to 7% this year. Free cash flow is on track for a record 6 to7 billion dollar. Uh margins have inflicted. Venmo has accelerated. Unprofitable PSP customers were fired and active accounts are growing again. On top of fixing what he inherited, Alex Chris has also positioned PayPal back at the forefront of innovation leading into and launching products like buy now pay later, stable coins, Agentic Commerce, Fastlane, PayPal World Ads, and Omni Channel. In his own words, they have quote moved this business from defense to offense. all part of the goal of transforming PayPal from an online payments company into a commerce company. For those who know what they own and actually understand the business, none of this innovation should be surprising.

That shift created a temporary 5 to 6% drag on the top line which the uh which fed the market's mistaken narrative. Now that we are lapping that drag and PSP is back to profitable mid-s singledigit growth and accelerating. The market is\n\nbeginning to pay attention to the innovation that has been right in front of it all along. The flurry of deals we have seen recently is case in point. First came the agentic commerce deal with Perplexity back in May. Few weeks ago, it was a multi-year digital commerce deal with Google that cements PayPal as a key PSP across payment service provider across Google products. Earlier this week, they partnered with Mastercard to advance secure agentic commerce. And on the same day, integrated Venmo across the entire built ecosystem to allow users to pay rent or mortgages through Venmo. The list goes on. Then came the whipped cream and cherries on the top. Right before earnings, PayPal announced a deal with Open AAI to become the first payments wallets integrated directly into ChatGpt. We already knew Alex Chris and Sam Alman had a relationship going back to Alman's Worldcoin days, which we flagged on this podcast weeks ago. So, this partnership was something we had a feeling might come together at this at some point. All of this ties back to our broader AI beneficiary investment thesis that we have discussed in recent podcasts and articles. Rather than owning the companies forced to pick up the AI tab and erode earnings in the process, we prefer to own the beneficiaries of AI in the unmnificent 493 trading at much lower multiples with accelerating earnings and let the hyperscalers pick up the tab. We get a free ride on their coattails, capturing all the upside without spending a dime. Going back to PayPal, the point is simple. This company is back in growth mode. We've highlighted the key points from the uh uh chat GPT article and from the earnings breakdown and put stars next to the super important points uh and the deck and the uh earnings call transcript I believe. Let's see. Yes. Uh so here are the 10 key points. Number one, PayPal reported net revenue of 8.4 billion for the quarter. up 7% year-on-year, beating Wall Street cont consensus by approximately $182 million. Non-Gap EPS also came in well ahead of expectations, rising 12% year-over-year to 1.34 and beating consensus by 13 cents. Number two, during the quarter, management returned $ 1.5 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 21 million shares of common stock at an average price of $71. So, for all those whiny little that were saying pain pal, pain pal, and didn't know what they owned because they're worried about the price versus the value of the stock, uh, guess who you were selling to? Not only me, but you were also selling to Alex Chris with the company buying back your shares and taking you out of your stock on a trailing 12-month basis. This brings the total repurchase to 5.7 billion or 78 million shares, reducing the weighted average share count by 6%. In addition to buybacks, PayPal announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend, declaring a dividend of 14 cents per share and targeting a 10% payout ratio of non-GAAP net income going forward. Most importantly, this new dividend does not impact the company's share repurchase program and is intended to complement it with management maintaining its long-term framework of returning 70 to 80% of free cash flow to shareholders. the vast majority through buybacks and targeting $6 billion in repurchases for the full year. Three, adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was 2.3 billion, up 48%. Let me say that again. Free cash flow was 2.3 billion for the quarter, up 48% year-over-year. This reminds me of PayPal. This reminds me of Alibaba at $60 when you couldn't give it away and they were generating over $20 billion of free cash flow per year. And you can't make this stuff up. uh bringing the year-to- date free cash flow to 4.3 billion. Management reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to seven billion which would mark a record high and imply 11% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Four, the payment service provider segment has now turned the corner after lapping the quote firing of unprofitable customers with total payment volume up 6% year-over-year and accelerating from 2% growth in the prior quarter. This includes enterprise payments, BrainFree, which delivered mid-s singledigit total payment volume growth and is now consistently contributing to transaction margin dollar growth. Management plans to expand PSP segment into physical retail during Q4 through the Verafhone Partnership. Five, buy now pay later continues to perform well and management plans to lean into it even further in coming years. Buy now pay later is expected to reach 40 billion in total payment volume for the full year growing to more than 20% year-over-year and outpacing the broader market with economics on par with or better than peers. Management continues to see buy now pay later drive a meaningful uplift in overall user enga activity and engagement similar to what is observed with Venmo and PayPal debit cards. Six times the transaction frequency and three times average revenue per account. They view buy now pay later as a generational shift in consumer behavior that PayPal is well positioned to lead. Looking ahead, PayPal will expand BNPL into new geographies and product offerings in 2026, having launched in Canada last week and set to extend its reach across Europe. Six, Venmo's total payment volume, TPV, increased 14% year-on-year, accelerating from 12% last quarter and marking the fourth straight quarter of double digit growth. Fully year revenue is on track to reach 1.7 billion, up 20%. Venmo's revenue is up 20% year-onear and 10 percentage points above uh 2023's growth rate. Management believes Venmo is still in the early innings of monetization driven by pay with Venmo monthly activities up 25% and the Venmo debit card monthly activity up 40% and over 1 million first-time users added in Q3 through college partnerships. For the 66 million monthly active accounts, ARPA is greater than $25 and growing mid- teens with management seeing massive room for monetization as ARPA remains 1/3 to 1/4 of peers 75 to $100. If ARPA reaches peer levels and the MAA base remains flat, currently plus 7% year-over-year, Venmo could generate 4.95 to 6.6 billion in annual revenue over time. Venmo is just scratching the surface. Seven branded experience which include PayPal buy now pay later Venmo and did debit card programs saw total payment volume grow 8% year-on-year led by the US with 10% growth more than double last year's rate. Growth was largely driven by omni channel initiatives such as debit and tap to pay which delivered 65% total payment volume growth and continued to scale globally. brand to check out TPV still grew 5% during the quarter despite a choppy macro environment while PayPal saw less pressure from Asia-based marketplaces selling into the US. This was partially offset by softer consumer discretionary spending in the US in in Europe and the US later in the quarter. Eight management once again raised its fullear guidance following a hike last quarter, lifting non-GAAP EPS guidance to a midpoint of 537 compared to 465 last year and initial guidance of 503, up 15.6% year-over-year and 6.9% above initial guidance. In addition, management increased transaction margin dollar guidance to 15.45 to 15.55 billion. That's up five to 6% year-on-year growth, up from initial range of 15.2 to 15.4 billion provided at the start of the year. Nine transaction margin dollars excluding interest on customer balances increased 7% during the quarter to 3.6 billion and remains on pace for 67% growth for the full year. Most importantly, management reiterated confidence in achieving high singledigit transaction margin dollar growth over the long term. and 10 total active accounts increased 1% year-over-year to 438 million total active accounts and rose onetenth of 1% compared to Q2 reaching a record high. Monthly active accounts grew 2% to 227 million supported by strength across both PayPal consumer accounts and Venmo. Most importantly, transactions per active account excluding PSP increased 5% year-over-year. Here are the key points from the earnings call highlighted for you. Uh and then as we move on to market, fear and greed still at fear. Active investment managers still a little over their skis. Let's see how this plays out. S&P earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised up 25 basis points uh or one fourth of 1% for for 2026 with the Russell small caps. That's a lot higher. Top 30 weights revised up. Earnings power is going to be 4.24% greater than they thought 60 days ago. Economic data, we don't have a ton of it. Government still shut down. uh so to be determined earnings growth as I said was 9.2% that is above the 8% estimates usually your 3% this is only 1.2 to 1.3% above estimates. So,",

This was a stock you couldn't give away at 18 or $19 a share with investors blinded by the uninvestable label and looking at me like I had two heads for pitching the name. Fast forward to today and Intel now sits second only to AMD as the best performing AI name year to date, outperforming every Mag 7 stock that investors continue to clamor for. Now that the stock has more than doubled from the lows, analysts have been forced to take price targets from $20 a share to $40 a share overnight and suddenly everyone is interested. This wasn't on anyone's bingo card except for the loyal listeners of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. That's because when viewers tune in each week, they do what we like to call burdening ourselves with the facts. That means taking the time to actually look under the hood and do the fundamental work on a company by company basis to know what we own. When you do that, the the Intel thesis becomes simple common sense about as straightforward as they come. The US government had no choice but to step in and backs stop Intel. Without Intel, the entire world would have its eggs in the TSMC basket. Washington couldn't let the future of advanced chipmunking rest in the hands of a single foreign company. And Intel was the only firm on US soil, standing on the 10y line of achieving that goal. But it's not just Uncle Sam that can't afford for Intel to struggle. Every major chip designer from Nvidia to AMD to Mag 7 names currently depends on the kindness of strangers for advanced foundry work. And there's only one stranger in town, TSMC. No company in his right mind wants to rely on a single supplier halfway across the world. Jensen Wong didn't write a $5 billion check out of the kindness of his heart. He did it because his growth growth is capped at $4 billion a quarter at TSMC. The night in shining armor to fix this is now Intel.

If you want the taxpayers's money, the taxpayer is going to get something for it.\" And um uh as it relates to the rest of them, the mineral rights, I think that's to be determined. uh uh we certainly need uh these these these specialized resources uh and to the extent that the private market can't sort it on its own. Could there be different deals done where the public sector comes to bear for national security reasons? Yes. Uh hopefully we can avoid those at all costs. But if absolutely necessary, I think it is something that needs to be done for national security. The stock's up roughly 60% since the deal was announced late August.

I.e., if it works, we'd make a 10 or 20 bagger because there's such a small slug of equity. If it fails, we lose everything and go apply for a job as a greeter at Walmart. Um, if we wouldn't do that deal, we won't buy one share. And this is not a slam dunk enough for me to uh to cover to to want to buy the whole company. So therefore, I won't buy one share. That doesn't mean it's not going to double or triple. It just means there's not enough margin of safety. And the second is if we were to go in and to the board of directors and uh tell them we'd like to buy the entire company at the price that it was quoted in the market today, would they have us escorted out by security? And if the answer is no, they would entertain the offer. We won't do it. I think at these levels they would potentially call security and say, \"Get this schmuck out of here. We're not selling the whole company at $5 a share.\" But I don't know. But it doesn't pass both filters. So therefore, uh we wouldn't invest. Um and again, that doesn't mean it won't work because it might. Is this something you throw in your PA like a like a uh you know lottery ticket? But I I I just don't mess around with that. So, uh I think you're probably correct and we wouldn't be involved. Uh Clorox, we we're okay with Caleb. We've covered that one in recent weeks. Everyone keeps asking me about FServe.

Just send me one, guys. Don't send me five. That's not beating down. That's not That's nowhere near. Uh that's so funny. Zoom out, baby. Welcome to the podcast. But um these are not being down. So they would not be in our realm of starting to do research on this. That's nowhere near a beat down. That is a tiny little single tier. That is not crying in the soup. We like to buy things when people are crying in the soup. Chris H. Oh, got that. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nVantise Talafra, thanks for taking my question. Going to repeat all the praise you. Oh, I'm not going to repeat all the praise and thanks you get everywhere. Just want you to know you become my role model over the past 12 months. Uh that I've been following the podcast. That's very very kind. Um I'm trying to make you think for yourself and if you if I do that, that's key. I don't need to be a role model. I just want to put out a lot of good and uh uh let that take care of itself and I'm glad you're getting value. Uh Teloflex TFX. All right, let's have a look. I think you might be a little early on this, but let's have a look. So, cash flow's going down, revenues have been flat, return on invested capital's flat, margins are flat. Uh let's see the balance sheet 1.8 billion. It's a little bit more levered than I'd like to see, but not the end of the world. income statement single-use med medical devices. Um, yeah, this one's worth doing more work. I like your framework. I would like to see some recovery and free cash flow. It's negative right now. Not in love with that. I want to see an inflection of that, but it's it's definitely worth starting to do some work. Elon Patrick, love your take on Zoom. I'm not against it. I'm just not going to be involved in it. I'll leave it at that. I'm not convinced the moat is strong enough, but they do have some proprietary products that are interesting. Uh I don't think you're going to get hurt. I just don't think you're going to make as much money as you think. Hess, this is just a dividend play. It's not interesting enough. You're not going to get a double and you're buying it for this yield. which is 8% yield. There are better uses of capital. Not not really for me. Um, Eric Thomas, thank you for the content. Would love to hear your opinion on Comcast. I don't have any interest in that. Um, I I can't envision I I think it's probably going to be okay when they break up the parts, but I mean, you got SpaceX. I I think that model is at risk and I I'm not smart enough to figure it out, so it just goes into two hard box and I pass on it. Roman Chennowith, silver miners as a leverage play on the debasement trade. I think it's um I think I covered it with David Lynn. Uh no matter how well the metals do, the miners seem to figure out a way to it up. Excuse my language, but um they'll work until they don't. They work for five minutes and then they uh a Y a SF By the way, the fact that the trade has a name means you're too late for it. So, I I wouldn't I wouldn't screw around there. Just buy good companies. If the dollar gets to base, you'll just get more of them if your company provides enough value in their respective sector. Like Buffett said, doesn't matter if we trade in dollars or sea shells or coins or uh bitcoins or uh whatever. If you provide the best sneakers at the best price at the right time, like Vans, uh, or you, um, provide the best payment services like PayPal, or you provide the best planes like Boeing, you're going to get the most of whatever is on call. And that's something you have control over. You guessing on how far you get to base. when you've got record revenues in the Treasury at 30 billion a month on the uh Treasury yields, record tax revenues coming in from profits, uh balanced budget on the way. Uh yeah, I I I'd be careful of that. Um but we do believe the dollar is going lower over the next few years because it runs in cycles and we were very minority position on that just a short while ago. Thank you for an impact you've had on my career. I've been listening since 2021. Curious if you ever use thirdparty research or consulting firms for tailored diligence or market studies on ideas. I guess absolutely not, but it came to mind when you say quote do private equity investing in the public markets. I don't know why that would come to mind based on that quote, but uh let me read further. I've always found it ironic that PE and hedge funds tout their investing edge yet pay firms like BCG and or McKenzie $1 million for 200page deck to validate their thesis. I don't know what firms you're working for, but um they sound like losers to me, but um uh no, we don't do that. We do our own work and um and we have our internal framework that we believe provides a specific edge for the specific style of investing we do. And we don't get distracted by shiny objects or other lanes. We have one narrow lane that we're very good at and we stay in it and we mastered it. So, um, you know, we just don't deviate. And, uh, and then, you know, you get tailwinds when it's really super duper amazingly, uh, in style. And then other tailwinds where you just do good work and even if it's out of style, you can make money because turnarounds are turnarounds. And if all the factors come together, irrespective of what the market's doing, you're going to get your doubles and triples over a few years. Uh, and rinse and repeat. So, um, no, we don't pay Mckenzie And when we see a CEO come in who had been, uh, from them, uh, we're, you know, generally, um, it's, we'll leave it there. All right. So, uh, Zachary Chinard, big thanks to you and your podcast. I live in Boston, student at Nor Eastern. Your podcast has taught me so much over the last handful of months after a friend recommended your show. Thank you very much. Uh, whenever I get a notification posted a new video, I drop everything to watch it. That's very kind. Want to know your opinions on Progress Software Corporation. Okay, you got it, Zachary. Uh, PRGS. Now, as a rule, we tend to stay away from software because the modes can be impaired pretty quickly. This is probably one that's been hit by um AI threats. I think it's probably at a level where it's looking interesting, but you have to be damn sure that they cannot be disintermediated either by AI or their mo being breached by a competitor and that is very hard to be certain about when it comes to software. Uh revenues have been declining. I'm sorry, that's free cash flow. Revenues are still doing fine. Well, multiple what do they do? AI powered CA applications and digital experiences, DevOps, software automation. I mean, if you can understand what they do and you can be damn certain that they have a moat, it's probably a decent buying area. But, um, that's a very hard space to be certain about, which is why Buffett never touched it. But I all the other things line up. It's just you better be damn certain about the moat. Terry Smith, love the show as always. You're my inspiration why I decide what to purchase. Well, inspiration, but then do the perspiration and do the work behind it. Please look at CAG. I think we have and I think we were good with it in the last few weeks. Yeah, I think this one's going to be okay. This is just all defensives are getting smashed, whether it's Hormel or Diagio or Baxter. Uh, and they'll get smashed until Mag 7 goes down and then people won't be able to get enough defenses.

You are right here in subtle warning, overt warning, and you're nowhere even near panic. Then you a year from now, you'll be in discouragement. And maybe if the business lives, you'll get to start to get back to anxiety, aversion, denial, and then returning confidence. But you're three years off from that. That one hasn't even begun.

I think you're hair early and I think it's going to be okay in the long term. So, for me, I would probably just wait a little bit on this one. Can you take a look at InMD? Inmare man. This thing got smoked. All right. Let's see. It's medical devices. is this is a space I want to start to get more and more exposure. Yeah, free cash flow is getting crushed too and revenues. So, you got to see some signs of a turnaround. Free cash flow last quarter started to look better. What about revenues? What about balance sheet? Looks pretty good. Looks good. Yeah, I think you just really want to study their products and understand if they have an actual moat or a potential breach to the moat, medical products based on radio frequency. So, just understand and see if it's durable. But leaving that aside, let's see. Probably not going to get too hurt with this one. It's absolutely left for dead.

And you can't make this stuff up. uh bringing the year-to- date free cash flow to 4.3 billion. Management reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to seven billion which would mark a record high and imply 11% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Four, the payment service provider segment has now turned the corner after lapping the quote firing of unprofitable customers with total payment volume up 6% year-over-year and accelerating from 2% growth in the prior quarter. This includes enterprise payments, BrainFree, which delivered mid-s singledigit total payment volume growth and is now consistently contributing to transaction margin dollar growth. Management plans to expand PSP segment into physical retail during Q4 through the Verafhone Partnership. Five, buy now pay later continues to perform well and management plans to lean into it even further in coming years. Buy now pay later is expected to reach 40 billion in total payment volume for the full year growing to more than 20% year-over-year and outpacing the broader market with economics on par with or better than peers. Management continues to see buy now pay later drive a meaningful uplift in overall user enga activity and engagement similar to what is observed with Venmo and PayPal debit cards. Six times the transaction frequency and three times average revenue per account. They view buy now pay later as a generational shift in consumer behavior that PayPal is well positioned to lead. Looking ahead, PayPal will expand BNPL into new geographies and product offerings in 2026, having launched in Canada last week and set to extend its reach across Europe. Six, Venmo's total payment volume, TPV, increased 14% year-on-year, accelerating from 12% last quarter and marking the fourth straight quarter of double digit growth. Fully year revenue is on track to reach 1.7 billion, up 20%. Venmo's revenue is up 20% year-onear and 10 percentage points above uh 2023's growth rate.

And you can't make this stuff up. uh bringing the year-to- date free cash flow to 4.3 billion. Management reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to seven billion which would mark a record high and imply 11% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Four, the payment service provider segment has now turned the corner after lapping the quote firing of unprofitable customers with total payment volume up 6% year-over-year and accelerating from 2% growth in the prior quarter.

Five, buy now pay later continues to perform well and management plans to lean into it even further in coming years. Buy now pay later is expected to reach 40 billion in total payment volume for the full year growing to more than 20% year-over-year and outpacing the broader market with economics on par with or better than peers. Management continues to see buy now pay later drive a meaningful uplift in overall user enga activity and engagement similar to what is observed with Venmo and PayPal debit cards. Six times the transaction frequency and three times average revenue per account. They view buy now pay later as a generational shift in consumer behavior that PayPal is well positioned to lead.

      "products. Earlier this week, they partnered with Mastercard to advance secure agentic commerce. And on the same day, integrated Venmo across the entire built ecosystem to allow users to pay rent or mortgages through Venmo. The list goes on. Then came the whipped cream and cherries on the top. Right before earnings, PayPal announced a deal with Open AAI to become the first payments wallets integrated directly into ChatGpt. We already knew Alex Chris and Sam Alman had a relationship going back to Alman's Worldcoin days, which we flagged on this podcast weeks ago. So, this partnership was something we had a feeling might come together at this at some point. All of this ties back to our broader AI beneficiary investment thesis that we have discussed in recent podcasts and articles. Rather than owning the companies forced to pick up the AI tab and erode earnings in the process, we prefer to own the beneficiaries of AI in the unmnificent 493 trading at much lower multiples with accelerating earnings and let the hyperscalers pick up the tab. We get a free ride on their coattails, capturing all the upside without spending a dime. Going back to PayPal, the point is simple. This company is back in growth mode. We've highlighted the key points from the uh uh chat GPT article and from the earnings breakdown and put stars next to the super important points uh and the deck and the uh earnings call transcript I believe. Let's see. Yes. Uh so here are the 10 key points. Number one, PayPal reported net revenue of 8.4 billion for the quarter. up 7% year-on-year, beating Wall Street cont consensus by approximately $182 million. Non-Gap EPS also came in well ahead of expectations, rising 12% year-over-year to 1.34 and beating consensus by 13 cents. Number two, during the quarter, management returned $ 1.5 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 21 million shares of common stock at an average price of $71. So, for all those whiny little that were saying pain pal, pain pal, and didn't know what they owned because they're worried about the price versus the value of the stock, uh, guess who you were selling to? Not only me, but you were also selling to Alex Chris with the company buying back your shares and taking you out of your stock on a trailing 12-month basis",

Uh and then as we move on to market, fear and greed still at fear. Active investment managers still a little over their skis. Let's see how this plays out. S&P earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised up 25 basis points uh or one fourth of 1% for for 2026 with the Russell small caps. That's a lot higher. Top 30 weights revised up. Earnings power is going to be 4.24% greater than they thought 60 days ago. Economic data, we don't have a ton of it. Government still shut down. uh so to be determined earnings growth as I said was 9.2% that is above the 8% estimates usually your 3% this is only 1.2 to 1.3% above estimates. So,",
      "finally , we move on to PayPal update. As it turns out, old dogs can learn new tricks. When Alex Chris took over the reigns at the granddaddy of fintech a little over two years ago, he inherited a company that fall had fallen asleep at the wheel after riding the e-commerce boom during the pandemic. Prior, management had stopped innovating and tried to make up for it by spending billions on acquisitions that struggled to integrate. Growth was slowing, transactions margins were under pressure and the user base was declining. From day one, Alex Chris, who knew who we knew was a winner based on what he accomplished leading the small business group at into it, has been laser focused on getting PayPal pack PayPal back to what made it great in the first place, innovation. While his shock the world comment that many laughed at may have been a bit early, he has delivered on everything he said he would and more.

For those who know what they own and actually understand the business, none of this innovation should be surprising. The market, however, spent the last two years distracted by the slowing growth narrative and ignored everything else. The reality is that this was a deliberate shift away from the empty calorie growth at all cost strategy that was popular under prior leadership. That shift created a temporary 5 to 6% drag on the top line which the uh which fed the market's mistaken narrative. Now that we are lapping that drag and PSP is back to profitable mid-s singledigit growth and accelerating. The market is"
