**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautiously Bullish → 7/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆

- Constructive China deal framework
- High liquidity in the system due to global central bank cuts
- Opportunity for volatility to deploy cash

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is at a moment of truth with big tech earnings determining the durability of the rally. Multiple expansion is typically driven by growth expansion, but the MAG7 are showing margin compression and decelerating earnings growth despite high capex. A shift towards undervalued sectors and AI beneficiaries is likely. The Fed's policy decisions and the resolution of the government shutdown will influence short-term market movements, but the long-term trajectory points towards lower rates.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| MAG7 Earnings Growth | Decelerating from 32% (Q3 2024) to 14% (Q3 2025) | Earnings growth is halving, yet multiples remain high, indicating potential for multiple compression. |
| MAG7 Capex | $400 Billion (67% increase YOY) | Massive capex with little evidence of return on invested capital impacting margins and buyback ability. |
| Global Central Bank Cuts | 313 | Highest since post-GFC, indicating significant liquidity in the system. |
| Government Shutdown Impact | 10-25 basis points a week | The longer the shutdown drags on, the more significant the impact on GDP, potentially leading to a pullback. |
| Unemployment Rate | 4.3% | Unemployment ticking up makes it harder to put the genie back in the bottle, pushing the Fed towards rate cuts. |
