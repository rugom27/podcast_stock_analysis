uh stvy on Fox Business so I want to thank uh Christian dagger Preston miselle and Stuart Barney as well as Lauren Simonetti for having me on the show we&#39;re going to talk some fed stuff we&#39;re going to talk some Intel developments and some Bank of Japan so we&#39;re going to listen in here 142 uh Thomas Hines join joins me this morning what do these retail sales numbers mean for the market do you think well I think it shows a continued resilience of the economy a continued resilience of the consumer uh I think as it relates to the FED which is the big question for this week it probably gives them cover to just start with 25 to get their feet wet tomorrow 25 basis point cut versus 50 does it matter 25 basis points 50 basis points doesn&#39;t really matter that much does it if the downtrend is in place after four years of nothing I think you&#39;re exactly right I I I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re going to do the big thing though that very few people are paying attention to what they&#39;re paying attention to is 65% chance of a 50 basis point cut tomorrow that&#39;s in the FED funds Futures Market I think that&#39;s a little bit aggressive the key thing this week is not so much what happens on Wednesday what happens on Friday with the bank of Japan if you remember in early August the bank of Japan hiked when the FED didn&#39;t move and that created a liquidity mismatch and the Nik fell 25% so if the FED goes 25% 25 BAS points the bank of Japan needs to hold Pat and do zero if they go 50 Bank of Japan can hike 25 uh and things will be okay but you don&#39;t want a situation where the bank of Japan starts to unwind that carry trade Again by going more aggressively than the FED other direction it&#39;s just getting very complicated is it looking at the bank of Japan to the Federal Reserve 50 B Point lot of I think the bottom line is that stocks go up typically the S&amp;P goes up 133% in the 6 months after a rate cut Okay so if you&#39;re doing well in the market you&#39;ll continue to do well I&#39;ve got to deal with this last time you were on the show you said that intel was worth buying and at that time was what 19 20 bucks a share yeah everyone was hiding under the desk and and uh during the break he said Tom what do you think I said absolutely buy it it&#39;s trading at tangible book if they liquidate the thing tomorrow you get your money back oh and by the way there might be upside people are talking about Intel like it&#39;s going out of business this is a this is a business that did $50 billion of Revenue in the last 12 months and people are worried about solvency I&#39;ll tell you what three big announcement since we saw yesterday they&#39;re partnering with Amazon for AWS to do an AI customized chip they got $3 billion contract from the Department of Defense and they&#39;re moving The Foundry business into a subsidiary so they can raise outside Capital without diluting the sh buy it at 21 I like it at 21 I like it at 20 I like it at 19 and it&#39;s going to 30 40 plus over time okay Thomas H thanks for being with us thanks for always coming up and we&#39;re back and then we&#39;re going to move on to a little bit of technical analysis here from slomer over at RBC thanks to my buddy over there uh so it&#39;s very interesting and I&#39;m struggling with this a little bit it&#39;s kind of playing out according to plan if you remember we had talked about and showed the election year seasonality where we were hoping to get some strength and start to touch on new highs by midep which would be coincident with the first cut buy the rumors sell the news and then election year seasonality choppiness into the end of October before a year- end rally so I went through uh quite a few stocks and I was looking okay do I want to put a market hedge on well first thing I said is what&#39;s fully value that we are F fully value that we haven&#39;t already taken profits and if you remember we took a lot of profits in July from the mag 7 before they rolled over we took a lot of profits from the banks that had had gone up a lot uh we went over that all that stuff a couple of weeks ago um so I kept looking stock by stock and I was like there&#39;s nothing near or over intrinsic value that we want to sell into this quote predicted weakness that may be coming in a few weeks so then I said all right so then why don&#39;t I put some spreads uh uh or some tactical shorts on the indices and I went through the you know I figured the easy ones would be the SMH semiconductors um maybe QQQ maybe xlk Tech centered stuff and yeah they&#39;re a little stretched but they&#39;re not really at extremes pound the table like when we wrote that article about Nvidia on June 20th which was literally the top and it and it fell 30% right after that uh there was there&#39;s nothing like screaming obvious that doesn&#39;t mean they all can&#39;t go down in the next 6 weeks um but the risk reward is not perfect and when I started to look for okay how else could I express a tactical short or a short-term Hedge for the next six weeks honestly in looking at hundreds of stocks the only ones that I saw that looked imminently aggressively shortable were utilities and as you know we were pounding the table last fall fall to buy utilities when no one wanted utilities and now that they&#39;re up 50% everyone wants utilities now you say Tom that sounds crazy if they&#39;re going to cut rates utility should keep going up and and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m thinking through and I agree with in terms of longer term but I think in short term I think a couple of things could happen uh one it could certainly be by the rumor sell the news in terms of utilities uh second the other thing that I started to think about over dinner was hypothetically if they did 50 and people got past the shock shock effect and they started thinking oh my goodness the economy is going to grow faster than we expected because they&#39;re front loading all of these Cuts versus an interpretation like oh they&#39;re doing 50 basis cuts the the the world is coming to an end they must know something we don&#39;t know but let&#39;s just assume they did 50 which I&#39;m still in the camp they&#39;re going to do 25 but if they did 50 and then the narrative shifted to wow this liquidity is going to be massive and things are going to that would be a scenario where defensives would sell off and rates would tick back up because people would expect faster growth than expected and it sounds counterintuitive and you see the longer end of the curve and some of the interest rate sensitives that have had rallies in anticipation of this take a breather um that that said when you&#39;re looking to uh do a tactical short to protect against the overall indices maybe coming in a little bit for a seasonal period defensives is not really what you want to short because technically if the Market&#39;s going to correct five or 10% defensive should stay strong in that environment and looking across hundreds of large cap stocks today for some themes uh the 10 or 15 that I said I could short today were we&#39;re all basically in the utilities and re groups uh and that&#39;s not the way to do a tactical short or a hedge so with the inability to want to sell anything because it&#39;s not anywhere near our predefined uh uh fair value or euphoric value where we&#39;ll we&#39;ll sell some of it as well and the mag 7 and not recovering as aggressively as I thought it might into the cuts to Resort or or sell off Etc um the risk reward to allocating one or 2% cap capital to shorts as of today is not as attractive as I thought it might be uh going into the first cut again it doesn&#39;t mean the market won&#39;t pull back 5 or 10% between now and the election and then rally back and then some before the end of the year um but I would like to see a more extreme situation the other thing we have in hand which we&#39;re going to discuss is the Bank of Japan meeting on Friday and it&#39;s it&#39;s widely expected that they are going to hold and do nothing so if the FED Cuts 25 and they do nothing like I said with with um with Stuart uh that&#39;s probably a reasonably bullish set up If the Fed Cuts 50 and Bank of Japan either does zero or 25 my guess if the FED Cuts 50 that&#39;s going to give room for the bank of Japan to hike 25 which they want to do because their inflation is starting to go um that would be fine but if the FED Cuts 25 and Bank of Japan hikes 25 I think you&#39;re going to have another early August situation and I think that&#39;s low probability so the context that I&#39;m laying out is the best scenario I see right now unless we get further strength in the next few days or weeks where some things get stretched and then we can really put high risk High reward to risk tactical shorts on to dampen some volatility and create some extra cash to go long uh into the election um I think right now the best risk reward is just to hold great companies with low leverage that uh that we love and do nothing but sit on our hands unless we plow through new highs in the next few days or week um uh at which time we would we would take one to two% of equity capital and get some shorts on but uh I would say that&#39;s you know a coin flip at this point so so that&#39;s how we&#39;re thinking through this and I guess the answer is you know after this beautiful week here and we&#39;ve got got a lot of gains in the last week um expect some bumpiness and volatility for the next six weeks but have no fear like last year where we made the vast majority of the gains in the last uh six weeks it was unbelievable we made more money in a shorter period of time it was it was mindboggling uh I think we&#39;re going to see the exact same situation once we get the election clearance so we&#39;ll try to use any weakness as an opportunity to build positions in October and late October if we get some nice surprise strength in the next few days or week even though we&#39;re moving into a period of seasonal weakness we may use that for some tactical shorts but just know we&#39;re hodlers and we&#39;re cognizant of the period that we&#39;re entering and if the risk reward sets up to do something we&#39;ll do it if not we&#39;re just going to hold through and buy on weakness and then ride the year end rally uh like nobody&#39;s business so that&#39;s kind of where we came out because that&#39;s something we&#39;ve been talking about and it&#39;s playing out as anticipated it&#39;s just I&#39;m not finding the fat pitch down the- middle shorts that I had expected to find uh at this time which tells me when everyone&#39;s looking for a correction you may not get it and um for all we know you get a 50 basis point cut yeah people will cry foul as far as political uh possible political interference there will be a lot of talk about that but but it may lead to the market going up straight up into the election which would absolutely surprise everyone and no one is really positioned for based on some of the sentiment we&#39;re going to talk about it would go against all first cut history it would go against all election year seasonality history and that&#39;s what the market is designed to do fool most of the people most of the time and based on me wanting to put on tactical shorts today looking at new highs in the Dow and looking at this and that and not finding any fat pitches it tells me from looking under the surface that it may not be as obvious as everyone is expecting and it may actually fake some people out so we&#39;ll see the beauty is looking at our core companies we run a concentrated portfolio what we&#39;re excited about is we really don&#39;t care what the General market does over the next six weeks because none of them are close to our intrinsic value targets that we uh Define before we even got into the position all wars are won before the first battle is fought and um and they&#39;re just moving slowly steadily uh some quickly some slowly uh in the direction that we had intended at Inception so we&#39;re excited about that let&#39;s look at the General market here so it&#39;s up against a Fibonacci extension which implies that it should do what the seasonality implies which would be kind of uh come off that strength it doesn&#39;t preclude it from actually busting through to the next one either and um so you see that you see a lot of these coming up against the resistance where you know cup and handle if you break out you&#39;re going to keep running this is uh on the daily chart this is the NASDAQ so this didn&#39;t get up to new highs which could imply it&#39;s a Head and Shoulder top or whatever and it&#39;s just going to roll back down to the shoulder line and either break or or reject it um I would love to see this get back to retest that and that&#39;s what would create some fat pitches for us but it doesn&#39;t appear that that&#39;s in the cards uh if it maybe it Go moves up to here but in other words we got the strength back by midep but we didn&#39;t get enough of it that to create fat pitches to get shorts on into the October weakness so that&#39;s where we are then if you look at the equal weight index is just breaking out which is also what tells me that why when I looked under the surface why there was little to do from a short which is perfectly fine with me um and so on even the midcap it&#39;s just barely breaking out that&#39;s usually not where you see a big correction from it&#39;s usually where you see it keeps pushing higher because of all the disbelief same with small caps you know small caps had gotten up to here I would have definitely expected to check back it hasn&#39;t quite got that mid-september strength which you know everyone is so convinced uh that we&#39;re going to get the worst two weeks in the year which is the last two weeks of September then we&#39;re going to get that weakness at the end of October into the election and maybe maybe this time will be different um but that&#39;s that&#39;s the analysis that I&#39;m coming to here uh and um even Tokyo didn&#39;t regain that so we&#39;ll be interested to see I mean Tokyo they could hold Pat and this thing could rally back up uh if they start hiking at the end of the week then this thing could break down so excting stuff here but looking through the portfolio for clients um I don&#39;t see anyone any of them that are over even if they weren&#39;t at our full value of where we would want to take some off and harvest some profits like we did in July um none of them are at the intrinsic value that we anticipate we&#39;re going to get from the businesses over time so I wouldn&#39;t want to create tax events just to avoid shortterm uh choppy volatility for a period of four to six weeks that&#39;s that&#39;s just silly and um and we&#39;re not going to do that so uh H hang sang index still do you know churning here uh broke out back tested starting to work its way back up we&#39;re going to talk about some of the things that are going on there that we&#39;re pretty excited about City economic surprise Index this is turning up that&#39;s not what you see at tops that&#39;s what you see near bottoms uh 10 years yield is rolling over so we&#39;ll see you know it&#39;s interesting and that&#39;s the other thing that I was seeing you know you&#39;re seeing it&#39;s oversold here so I&#39;m like gosh if they&#39;re cutting and yields are compressed what would cause the 10-year yield to go up and that would be they expect growth to be higher than anticipated now you did see the GDP now coming at 3% today um the other thing I think could be would be a surprise 50 basis point cut or a 25 basis point cut saying we don&#39;t you know something to the effect we didn&#39;t want to do a big cut before the election or they&#39;ll say it in a different way they&#39;ll just say like we&#39;re watching inflation but if inflation keeps going down we we intend to frontload at the next meeting which is code for 50 versus 25 um and then on that rhetoric the Market start might start to say well the mar the economy is not in an emergency but they are going to push to do more which means growth is going to be higher than expected which means yields on the 10year even though the um T bills yields are going down on the tenure would start to go up anticipating greater growth um which would favor cyclical small caps all that stuff so I could see a scenario where yields actually Spike on the cut which makes no sense but again by the rumor by the rumor Sala news uh this does look like it&#39;s breaking down so it&#39;ll be interesting the next few days but now at least you see what I&#39;m thinking but this is an interesting Divergence that sler points out here 10year yield making new lows but you have this RSI Divergence meaning a higher low and usually when that sees H yields reversed so I I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see the TLT go down which is um we talked about weeks ago when we took profits uh TLT go down yields go up a counter Trend move in the short term on this first announcement even potentially a counter Trend move in the dollar um is a possibility as well because it has moved down a lot in anticipation this is again here this FIB level or whatever and we could get a counter Trend bounce uh we&#39;ll see we want to see the Canadian dollar break this downtrend I wouldn&#39;t be surprised let&#39;s assume the J the bank of Japan does nothing on Friday you would get a bounce off this head and shoulders up up meaning Yen weaken against the dollar in the short term which would be bullish for risk assets which might take mag s back up and which point we&#39;d probably put on some tactical tactical shorts if it if it got up in the next two weeks before October and then we&#39;d have like a four or five week short so again we&#39;re paying attention to all this but at the end of the day it doesn&#39;t change our view on any of our core positions but it is an interesting time it&#39;s playing out as in in anticipated but not with the level of conviction where we would want to take the other side yet copper if you anticipated growth was going to re accelerated it could be a story you know if if China was going to do a major stimulus they would 150% wait for the FED to start easing if Bank of Japan was going to start hiking they would 100% wait for the FED to start easing so the other thing is the Bank of international settlements said that which is the Central Bank of central banks based in Switzerland and B in Basel Switzerland that for warning central banks not to squander the buffer that they&#39;ve built up in other words save some bullets for when there&#39;s a crisis don&#39;t cut too fast which leads me to believe they&#39;re going to do 25 but if they did do 50 I think after the initial knee-jerk people would say oh my gosh growth is going to be much faster than we expected and no one&#39;s positioned for that everyone&#39;s positioned for slow growth all crowded into defensives like Staples and utilities uh cyclicals are left behind and I think cyclicals are ready to run in small caps rated run whether that needs a 50 basis point or 25 with hawkish talk if they did 50 that means Japan can go now and if Japan can go now that means you&#39;re going to also see besides the Yen you&#39;re going to see the Yuan start to strengthen you&#39;re going to see Chinese bond yields go up and that&#39;s usually when Chinese equities do well also so a lot of very you know and what&#39;s really interesting about all that talk that I&#39;ve just spent the last 22 minutes with you going through how I&#39;m reasoning through all this it has zero bearing on what we would do relative to the beautiful companies that we have in our portfolio so nothing really changes other than getting cute in the short term which you know we would only do if we have like five to one risk uh five to one reward to risk trades that we could put on shortterm with one to two% of equity um and they&#39;re not present yet so we&#39;re not going to force it other than that yeah you can see all these are kind of just in ranges not exciting long or shorts fizer you know we&#39;ve talked about over the past this looks like it&#39;s working its way higher uh Alibaba same story uh looks like the FIB retracement would be at 120 sooner is better ladies and gentlemen we we&#39;re we&#39;re perfectly comfortable with sooner and if you look back through history when these things finally break through I&#39;m just watching this 90 level like a hawk when it breaks through that I think it could go straight to 120 very very quickly and it could have something to do with these feds look at PayPal same exact chart is happening like crazy right now uh gotta love Alex Chris and all the things he&#39;s done I mean this thing was down at $50 it&#39;s now 72 and uh the FIB levels according to this silly calculator they have start at 110 you know this thing is definitely going to be a double plus over time and uh and we&#39;re excited about that even Disney&#39;s coming off the mat I mean is this a stock you short right now because you think the Market&#39;s going to be weak or you sell no it hasn&#39;t even started yet um you know do you sell PayPal here because you think the Market&#39;s going to pull back 5% in it or Disney because you think the Market&#39;s going to pull back 5% I mean that&#39;s crazy town so no is the answer um that was a great set of charts from RBC at sler this week let&#39;s go through a bunch of indicators real quick what I&#39;m try what I want to communicate with this is none of them are at extremes where I would pound the table want to go a different direction in the market so we could get some type of surprises in the next week which leads to strength that no one&#39;s expecting is what I&#39;m saying I&#39;m I&#39;m openminded to it I&#39;m not betting on it I&#39;m just openminded to it because of what I saw looking at hundreds of stocks today looking for some shorts and on the strength this morning and uh I&#39;m not shorting utilities I mean if they crash they&#39;ll go down 10% and you I can&#39;t make five to one on spreads on that so I&#39;m not going to even risk a dollar so um even the pmo buy all is mid range by SPX these are some of the indicators I&#39;d like to look at pmo Dow Jones same thing the again they&#39;re all mid-range which doesn&#39;t scream short the market even though the seasonality is getting to the point where you&#39;d want to be more defensive but it&#39;s almost like people did that in the early part of September when it was supposed to be stronger and now in the late part when everyone expected to weak be weak maybe it&#39;s strong and that you know if the market is designed fool most of the people most of the time that&#39;s exactly what would happen so uh that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at uh even the bullish percent on individual sectors there are none the only one that&#39;s at a level where I&#39;m like oh my gosh let&#39;s start to look for shorts like energy is closer to level where I want to be finding buys which we&#39;ve talked about I think energy is a buy here but on a company by company basis the only one I like is Comstock but I think the group and some of the servicers but I&#39;m happy with comto I&#39;m just saying those are ready to go gold miners may be uh something to look at in terms of a short I don&#39;t know we&#39;ll see financials we&#39;ve already dealt talked about that in recent weeks um still hold regionals no change there we took the profits on BAC and C over the summer uh those were great uh real estate maybe the re so again if real estate and utilities right here at 100% And real estate at a at 93% if real estate and utilities are the only that are super overbought that tells me that even though they&#39;re cutting rates are going to go up now what rates are going to go up in the shortterm it seems like the 10-year yield and for the 10year yield to go up the market has to believe growth is going to be better than they anticipate and the only thing I could see happening that would warrant that is maybe they cut more than expected or you get massive stimulus or some positive numbers out of China uh which is also very probable because China has been defending their bonds that their yields have compressed on the basis of deflation and if they announce a massive bazook sua stimulus you would have expectations of inflation their yields would blow out and Global expectations of growth if they get serious about hitting their 5% Target would go back up and yields would stop trading down uh as you get further out which implies a steepening curve because the central banks would still be taking the short rates down so I think that&#39;s a plausible scenario that we have to watch for and be open for and our position for um all right let&#39;s get through a bunch of charts this is biotech breaking out remember we bought Down in the Hole there then we thought we were a genius with the thing then it Consolidated sideways then it went back and retested then it broke out and now it&#39;s consolidating the breakout and we we think we&#39;re going to continue to go higher so we&#39;re excited about that basket um all right I want to run through these because we&#39;ve got a lot what are we at 28 minutes all right so I&#39;ll be on Neil Cavuto tomorrow at 12: p.m. tune in to Fox bus business as well uh foreign investors dump Japanese equities remember I was telling you guys before August when that carry trade on wine I said these guys are going to get their heads ripped off and you&#39;re going to see the Yen strengthen and Chinese equities are going to start to recover and Japanese equities are going to go down all of that is playing out in fits and starts and I think that will continue this week based on what Bank of Japan does at the end of the week so let&#39;s see uh it&#39;s interesting semicond conductor production by location China has 24% of global share by the way that&#39;s an interesting chart uh hours need of work needed to purchase a week&#39;s worth of groceries has gone down in the last year and a half from 3.75 hours to 3.6 hours um new vehicle production so this has been the issue is that we&#39;re just not making the small cars and we&#39;re not making the small house that&#39;s going to change volumes are going to go up across the board uh and you&#39;re going to see that coming to a theater near you equities typically rally following the first bed cut if no recession so very hard to get a recession when you have now Atlanta GDP now just went from 2.5% to 3% for Q3 uh whether it&#39;s 2.5 or 2.0 or 3.0 very hard to get a recession when you have GDP growth at that level and you have earning expectations of 15.4% uh for 2025 so even if they&#39;re too optimistic they&#39;re nowhere near negative therefore this would be the most likely uh scenario which as you can see in the blue line after the first cut you do get this choppiness the first month or so which is what everyone&#39;s kind of talking about and expecting ourselves included which leads me to believe that maybe we get the opposite uh maybe everyone&#39;s been too cute for this well we&#39;re going to find out soon enough here is the US dollar Japanese Yen again I could see a counter Trend move here with the where the Yen starts to weaken against the dollar and the dollar strength in short term uh and uh and that those would be the things so uh here are the sectors that uh outperform 12 months after you see financials after the first cut financials healthc care that would include biotech Industrials a lot of cyclicals what what doesn&#39;t do as well Tech real estate utilities which have all done really well into the first cut uh what else does well Staples Consumer discretionary this is one I want to talk about a lot you know whether it&#39;s the VF corpse the Nikes problem is I can&#39;t own two sneaker turnarounds so uh we&#39;re sticking with Brack and Daryl until uh maybe Nike gets a new CEO but uh dividend yield still cheap relative to history value still cheap relative to growth These are times where generational buys happen and and fortunes are made uh two standard deviation moves you got to bet with that uh growth vers value same thing it&#39;s showing that dispersion earnings growth for next year healthc care is supposed to have the highest earnings growth next year that helps with biotech estimates have stayed up at 2 280 um this is another thing why I couldn&#39;t find a lot of good shorts today this bull bear indicator is nowhere near extreme fear and greed no near nowhere near extreme National Association of active investment managers nowhere near extreme aii sentiment nowhere near extreme so that&#39;s not an environment I like to short uh High re rates show hurting small business sector profits uh very similar to 82 what before you had the big um uh rally for 18 years because rates started coming down that will help small businesses and small caps the most here&#39;s the GDP we talked about uh mortgage rates are coming down but purchase applications aren&#39;t yet because we need more Supply we&#39;re going to talk about that today presidential election year seasonality from 1976 we&#39;ve always done 1955 but this is what everyone&#39;s looking at and you&#39;re supposed to have strength in the beginning of September we had weakness in the beginning of December then weakness at the end of September then a bounce in October till to low right before the election um I think this might get a little surprising in coming weeks and it really doesn&#39;t matter but it&#39;s just something to keep in mind this shows the average PE versus inflation since 1900 so when you have inflation running just two to 3% is when you get multiple expansion and the average for the last 124 years is looks like about 23 times and that&#39;s where inflation is kind of sitting right now it&#39;s only when you get up to greater than 10% you get multiple cont contaction to eight eight times uh or if growth starts to slow to 1 to 2% it would be 18 times but this is the sweep Spot 2 and 3% was where you get the highest multiple of 23 times and we&#39;re a little bit below that right now so um that&#39;s interesting Empire State manufacturing started ticking up monetary policy viewed as the most restrictive since the great financial crisis these were times uh April 2001 October 2008 within and and finally September 2024 within months if you bought you made generational gains uh most of the dollar weak weakness tends to manifest in the lead up to the first cut so that&#39;s why I would think that you might start to see a counter Trend bounce uh New York manufacturing expanded in September that&#39;s a good sign inferred Freight rates everyone&#39;s been saying that Freight rates were going to balloon in the fall and that&#39;s what was going to throw things off track they&#39;ve continued to go down uh Empire State manufacturing we covered biggest overweight in defensives relative to cyclical since May of 2020 if you were a buyer of cyclicals which we were those of you it&#39;s funny someone sent me a note um I&#39;ve been with you since the Wells Fargo days and the Exxon Mobile days we we made very quick doubles on that in 2020 um so this is a time that when everyone&#39;s plowed into defenses whether it&#39;s late 2008 early 2009 or 2016 or April 2020 where if you got out of defensives and bought cyclicals you made a fortune and we did in in those periods so uh yeah industrial and this is how we&#39;re we&#39;re lined up so this is exciting uh BuyBacks by corporate clients are above 2019 highs and then this is from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson which is pointing to the history since 1950 the next 10 days uh next two weeks are the worst days of the month so we&#39;re going to see if that&#39;s accurate but we actually may have gotten them early this year that&#39;s what I&#39;m saying is to be open-minded because everyone is so convinced based on the historical data and I just couldn&#39;t find a lot of good shorts which tells me that it might not be right this year uh here&#39;s the GDP now at 3% that got upgraded today uh and there have been 26 dis inversion episodes since 1950 and not all of them have led to a recession uh and the good ones to look at are the double dip there in 82 just like we had from 2020 then we had the recession in 2022 two technical recession two quarters negative GDP growth I think this is going to more follow that where you get multi-year strength um fund Strat out saying when you started September this week you never wound up with a positive month zero for 10 and um even if you climb back so I could see a scenario where we climb back close to even on the month and maybe don&#39;t turn positive but it could also be a different year A Lot of Things Different have been happening because of covid so keeping in mind Seth golden points out that um only once has the S&amp;P made its annual high in the month of July okay oh I see what they&#39;re saying because we had a high in July so 52% of the time December is high of the year so we&#39;re going to get the year in rally it&#39;s not going to be September even if we get a dip in October just hang on by January 1 you&#39;ll be fine and um that&#39;s that Joel greenblat the secret to investing is to figure out the value of something and then pay a lot less that&#39;s what we do here every single week uh and uh here&#39;s another chart from dividend growth investor which is basically what we do here is we just play the time Arbitrage game with low leverage we buy when it&#39;s Trad trading in despondency well below the margin of safety and we sell in some at intrinsic value and the most of it above intrinsic value at periods of euphoria and this time Arbitrage is what we get paid for sitting on our hands provid we did the right work and the right framework here and that&#39;s why you see across the portfolio so many have popped quicker than expected like the rolls-royces of the world we&#39;ve gone through a bunch of them go back a couple weeks we went through a bunch of them uh uh and some take longer but they all work uh over time because the framework is correct and that&#39;s the name of the game small cap stocks beating the S&amp;P 500 this quarter as investors expect uh Fed rate Cuts that&#39;s going according to plan uh here&#39;s from Brendan adern chin last night.com Alibaba 10cent and mwan are buying their stock are you um Bloomberg News reported plan okay we covered that China internal passport revamp could fuel New China growth so more of the same Alibaba to benefit from more crossb link trading uh history of 10 cent so it&#39;s showing that some of these companies when they opened up like Maan and xiaoi in the first so 10cent gained 23% in the first six months after they got stock connect mwan and Zi doubled in 12 months which would imply Alibaba I think it was at 80 when the stock connect happened or 78 or something so that would imply you know 150 160 um which I think is is not outside the realm of possibility I think it could happen that fast because we&#39;ve had it pent up for so many years and uh and then beyond so we&#39;ll see if passes any prolog China to cut rates on $5 trillion in mortgages as soon as September so what&#39;s the sign significance of September I think they&#39;re waiting for the FED to cut before they do this because they don&#39;t want to have to defend their bonds and their currency they want those those stuff to stabilize so they don&#39;t want to be too easy until other Banks start to ease and there have been 84 Cuts around the world now the FED is actually moving and they may be able to move as well Z urges efforts to hit their 5% growth Target amid Rising doubts uh times ticking you got three months it&#39;s time to hit the Bazooka and maybe they&#39;ll be able to do something more aggressive aggressive after the FED moves and that could be why the market started pricing in 50 basis points this week out of nowhere it was kind of strange actually so we keep an open minded Chinese chipm shows progress with new euv patent from domestic lith lithography Champion um Hong Kong 3.5 billion southbound trading net inflow for Baba uh consumer staple stocks are looking pricey it&#39;s time to sell that&#39;s from D Jacob son sonen shine reporter at Barons and um doing a lot of talking lately I&#39;m G to take a little cough drop here and we agree and that&#39;s similar to the utilities theme and it&#39;s similar to the REITs and Staples again everyone&#39;s crowded into defensives cyclicals will start to work why do they work because growth is going to be expected to be faster than people expect and the Catalyst for that we&#39;ve discussed some of the possible Catalyst China slowdown Spurs calls for stimulus before it&#39;s too late so the pressure is building China&#39;s first retirement age hike since 1978 triggers discontent so not only are they GNA have 20 year olds rioting on the streets they&#39;re going to have 60 year olds rioting on the streets with their canes uh Lululemon CEO bought up the slumping stock so he bought a I think he bought a million dollars of Lulu yeah Calvin McDonald so that&#39;s one we&#39;re watching too I mean we can&#39;t be too concentrated but we do think we&#39;re going to see a lot of these discretionary stocks turn the corner and turn it quickly which wouldn&#39;t surprise me if it would be sparked by something like China stimulus I mean if China did a huge consumption stimulus after the FED Cuts obviously Alibaba would go through the roof but Lulu would go through the roof Nike would go through the roof which is part of the reason we don&#39;t own Nike because we don&#39;t want all of our correlation to be to China we&#39;ve got enough with baba um okay so here&#39;s the big news that we covered with Stuart Intel solidifies three and a half billion dollar deal to make chips for the military the rumors of Intel&#39;s demise have been greatly exaggerated Boeing labor issue likely to be the final Milestone before news turns more constructive so they&#39;ll get this done just like the Auto Workers did and then uh the stock will be finally Off to the Races new CEO everything that you want to see in a turnaround 2.1 billion net flows to Alibaba in the first week of stock connect so if we expect 30 to 40 I think we expected 20 to 40 is what Brendan was saying on our podcast a couple of weeks ago at two a week that&#39;s 50 in the year obviously the first week will be more they&#39;ve been closed the first three days of this week by the way and the stock is still strong which is pretty amazing to me um Mainland was closed for a holiday so there was no southbound connect flows Monday Tuesday Wednesday of this week keep that in mind and the stock is still holding up which is pretty exciting this was a key article shared from uh one of our great viewers about from GQ it says it&#39;s time to start start wearing Vans again this is dated September 13th 2024 this is regarding our VF Corp so you can read that then another one from high snob snobiety Vans classic skate shoes look dapper as preppy brogues I don&#39;t know about that but uh I do know their their shoes are selling because I&#39;ve been going into a lot of Van stores in the last few weeks especially the new schools and everything else Biden targets teu with Port rule uh the beauty of this is it crushes Pino Duo and because they have a ton of business in the US from selling stuff at a loss but that&#39;s been funding them their ability to compete with Alibaba which ended last quarter when Alibaba took back share Alibaba is not nearly as hurt as Teemu uh because their price items are higher number one and number two they don&#39;t have huge amount of traction relative to their overall business in the US like timu that depends on it and shien that depends on it so Biden hering pindo Duo teu helps Alibaba this is good news for us uh the man who made Nike uncool that&#39;s John donaho pissed off all the wholesalers and they&#39;ll probably can him and the stock will turn around uh just like BF cour here&#39;s an article from a Blog named dividend growth investor um it&#39;s from Peter Lynch he says the companies that do well look out five six seven years and some decisions that they make may not be the right thing for next year and he&#39;s talking about Hubble Inc here and he shows how sooner or later the price catches up with the underlying earnings and we&#39;ve talked about that for Alibaba we&#39;ve talked about that for uh PayPal and other companies and it just showed here that the stock did nothing for seven six seven years and then it tripled overnight or uh 5x overnight from the lows here in 2020 uh and earnings tripled so basically you had the stock triple over time which was consistent with the earnings tripling and all that means is in the short term the market is a voting machine based on emotion in the long term it&#39;s a weighing machine based on fundamentals and uh and this this works all the time this is the framework that we use and we teach over and over and over Intel&#39;s turnaround is working by the dip that&#39;s from Barons uh PayPal Life in the Fast Lane for PayPal new Partnerships could boost the stock that&#39;s from Barons um it&#39;s amazing how opinion follows Trends this is uh some quantitative analysis showing that in the 13 times that gas prices have have saw a 12-month decline of similar magnitude the S&amp;P has rallied 18% on average over the next 12 months which supports our statement get out of defensives and get into discretionary and these other leopard dead groups that are going to benefit from a lot of the Dynamics that are happening in the market right now man I thought this was going to be a short podcast because it was only Tuesday but here we go uh Boeing Union negotiators to meet as striking workers dig in they&#39;re going to just start furing people and they&#39;ll come to an agreement Amazon tells workers to return to the office five days a week we&#39;ve been talking about that theme would happened Intel&#39;s latest move for its foundary business is so significant we covered it with Stuart key thing is here they can do joint ventures like they did with Apollo for 11 billion I think on the IR Irish Fab uh like they did with Brookfield for 30 billion and the Legacy business which is profitable which has been getting consumed or cannibalized by the losses in building out the foundaries um will be able to be more profitable because they can side finance that subsidiary and do a REV share on the subsidiary or some type of economic agreement on the subsidiary and let the Legacy business throw off free cash flow and do it right so all this is positive they&#39;re going to slow down Germany they&#39;re going full steam ahead with the US Fabs which has the US government&#39;s backing and that $3.5 billion dollar from the chips act this week just shows that it&#39;s backstopped as was our original thesis us officials uh jet to Beijing amid flood of cheap Chinese exports big names like David teer and big short investor Michael bur are quiet quietly upping their bets on the Chinese economy with Alibaba by the way China seeks a homegrown alternative to Nvidia these are some of the companies to watch who&#39;s going to play a role in that well Huawei is but Alibaba is and no one&#39;s paying attention Intel aiming to reverse slump unveils new contracts and Cost Cuts Intel stock jumps on plan to turn The Foundry business into a subsidiary and allow for outside funding Intel to make custom AI chip for Amazon multi-billion dollar framework multi-year the other thing that&#39;s interesting about the Bank of America&#39;s survey this week is excuse me is that FMS investors that think Global CPI will be higher hasn&#39;t been this low since 2009 when it was a generational buy opportunity so the Outlook this is all fodder to create for the market to climb a wall of worry um uh believe in a St stronger global economy in the next 12 months this is really low this is like 2009 levels and the market&#39;s at all-time highs or near it&#39;s amazing SMS sentiment improves modestly but it came back in after the Japanese carry trade on wine so there&#39;s more of that cash levels went up reemphasizing everyone&#39;s in defensives cyal are going to start to move their underweight Tech relative to Banks that&#39;ll probably continue for a little while they all jumped into utilities this month all jumped out of tech everyone wants utilities now that they&#39;re up 50% no one wanted them in October when we were pounding the table US Dollars still overweight by 1.2 overvalued by 1.2 standard deviations Euro is undervalued by 6 British pound undervalued by 7 standard deviations underweight emerging market equities by 08 standard deviations underweight European Japanese equities finally after being overweight by like one or two standard deviations is now underweight by 02 that trade is falling apart Staples overweight by7 standard deviations we said that&#39;s crowded Industrials underweight by 1.2 standard deviations below its long-term average there&#39;s opportunity there this is funny utilities is 2.8 standard deviations above its longterm average that&#39;s crazy town uh energy 1.4 standard deviations it long-term average there&#39;s opportunity there materials one standard deviation below again same thing allocations to Commodities at 7 year low most crowded trades still mag seven it&#39;s coming a little bit still short Chinese equities that&#39;s going to change and the FMS contrarian trades by haret long Commodities long China long resources long tech which is kind of interesting long reats long discretionary we agree short bonds yields go up which we&#39;ve been talking about short utilities which we&#39;ve been talking about short Staples short Health Care are the best contrarian plays very interesting as they say on Tik Tok What are they say nowadays very demure or I don&#39;t know I&#39;ve got 10 and 12 year olds telling me all this stuff all right so article of the week decision days tomorrow we went through vanney we went through everything about the bank of Japan now I want to play the 10-minute clip from Pat gelsinger CEO of intel on Monday night explaining these three initiatives that I explained in two minutes on Stu Varney let&#39;s listen in here welcome back shares of Intel soaring in overtime now up more than 82% as we just reported moments ago AWS becoming a MJ customer for Intel&#39;s Foundry business including its highest and 18a process and the company will set up a separate internal governance structure for that Foundry business now this comes after Intel announced it was awarded up to $3 billion in additional Government funding under the chips act for the secure Enclave program joining us now in an exclusive interview Intel CEO Pat Ginger uh Pat good to see you so last time I talked to you a few weeks ago the stock was headed down right now today the stock is headed up up on um the coming together of some of the things that you said Intel&#39;s going to do I got to ask specifically about 18a here interesting to see that mentioned with this AWS announcement because there were some rumors last week about broadcom and whether 18a was up to Snuff and and working out what can you tell us about the significance of this expanded AWS uh relationship particularly when it comes to ATA and the Readiness of it yeah thanks John and always a pleasure to be with you and the team at CNBC well you know this is a big announcement today Amazon&#39;s been a partner of Intel for many years but we&#39;ve just taken it to a whole new level obviously The 18a Foundry agreement for their AI networking is a big deal and Amazon is a Discerning customer they are you know really sent us through our Paces to prove that atna is up to Snuff and it&#39;s up to Snuff and that&#39;s part of the announcement today we also announced a custom version of Zeon 6 that we&#39;re doing uh with them and together these two really emphasize the Better Together both The Foundry progress as well as the products momentum but I&#39;m particularly proud as you suggest that this really shows the momentum of 18a it&#39;s healthy it&#39;s making great progress and as a Foundry you know we see a numerous set of customer pipeline opportunities in front of us a very big day when can we expect not expecting a day cuz I don&#39;t want to I mean you had a big announcement today so I&#39;m not trying to press you too but when can we expect more 18a um deal type announcements that might give investors confidence that this isn&#39;t just a one-off yeah and as we said you know some customers are reluctant to give their names because of some of the competitive Dynamics but we&#39;ve seen a large uptick in the amount of customer pipeline activity that we have underway since we released the pdk or the design specs that customers could start to use so I do see that we&#39;ll have a number of these that are making good progress and do hope to be able to make additional uh announcements in the future but the momentum has definitely increased since the July release of the pdk and the AWS announcement today was just a proof point of that momentum and we&#39;re looking forward to even better things to come okay Pat now I believe the Intel board met last week was it to discuss a wide range of things um and you&#39;re back saying you are pausing some of the manufacturing buildout in a couple of places in Europe here presumably to preserve cash and uh you know you&#39;ve been a target of criticism for the scale and speed of this manufacturing buildout did the board endorse the overall strategy of continuing this Foundry and Manufacturing buildout yeah and overall it was a very important board board meeting and uh I and the board are aligned in the go forward strategy for Intel Foundry and as we looked at that it was very important to say we&#39;re moving to this next phase of The Foundry Journey you we had this PA this pace that we needed to go through to catch up to get back to a competitive process technology to build some capacity flexibility and as we move to this next phase it&#39;s much more about building efficiency into that and making sure that we have good shareholder return for those significant Investments that we&#39;re now seeing the end of the tunnel as we say 18a uh health and so what we&#39;ve agreed is to be very focused on the efficiency of those Capital Investments focused on the US uh Investments first in Oregon Arizona New Mexico and the Ohio project and we&#39;re pausing our European and Germany and Poland for two years and pausing the Malaysian project as well obviously we&#39;ve built flexibility so we can scale up you know but first it&#39;s show Good Financial return from the Investments great support from the board of directors when we started this John you know this was a three and a half year Journey that we started the line we reviewed that thoroughly and we&#39;re committed to the future together okay now you&#39;re in a cost crunch right now you&#39;ve been uh cutting workers now delaying these expensive capital projects there&#39;s been especially since earnings a lot of criticism of you as a CEO are you confident that you and the board are on the same page on your future at Intel we&#39;ve gone through a very uh intense time and reviewed the strategy and I&#39;m committed they&#39;re committed the partnership is strong as we finish the board meeting we clearly have laid out these steps in the future and today&#39;s proof points the Amazon partnership the secure Enclave you know The Foundry subsidiary agreeing and seeing the great progress that we&#39;ve done on these cost measures all of these align us to the Future that gives not just finishing the journey that we started together 3 and A2 years ago you know but also assuring that we have the financial wherewithal the balance sheet that allows us to finish what we started I and the board are fully committed to that strategy and quite confident that with today&#39;s proof points we&#39;re well on our way to fulfilling exactly what we&#39;ve laid out to do together Pat it&#39;s Morgan it&#39;s great to have you on the show I want to go back to The Foundry subsidiary that you just mentioned because you are standing up this inde dependent subsidiary internally within the company I mean we&#39;ve seen the reports in recent weeks about the possibility of Intel considering portfolio CH changes the possibility of a split of its product design and Manufacturing businesses what should investors read into this subsidiary being stood up right now yeah and there&#39;s really three things that we&#39;re trying to accomplish one is it is distinct you know it has different operating requirements and for that service organ organization like a Foundry is very different than a products organization and we need to have the operational skills to make that great but second customers are all also looking for their Factory to be distinct from the Intel products and finally we&#39;re looking for Capital optimization opportunities investment opportunities that are distinct for The Foundry from the products and those are the objectives of setting up a specific subsidiary but it&#39;s clearly better together and I think the Amazon announcement today reinforces that very clearly it&#39;s a Foundry as well as a product partnership with the Amazon web services agreements today so distinct but better together so this is not a precursor to you spinning out that business no distinct but better together and we do see that that better together is so important because the Wafers right the cash flows from the Intel products into foundaries is very critical you know that&#39;s the optimization point for the Technologies but increasingly as you see with the Amazon announcement to today more customers want to be able to view this as their Factory their manufacturing as well and that&#39;s why setting the subsidiary structure up having clear governance and more accountability for those external Foundry customers is so important as well tell me what this overall you think means for Intel um there&#39;s a lot of concern about the data center business the amount of challenge that that&#39;s under how that affects you know margins Revenue coming in the door as you&#39;re spending on uh on The Foundry and Manufacturing side with these announcements today how much better do you think uh those costs and revenues are in balance and you know should we expect more of this realignment well we laid out uh following our Q2 earnings call a clear plan on the cost reductions the cap back savings the other cost improvements you know the implications that that has on a headcount or site strategy and we&#39;re well underway on delivering exactly against that plan that and you know these changes that we&#39;ve made for the overall manufacturing footprint you know we&#39;re confident that we have the balance sheet and beginning a process of delevering that gives us the ability to finish what we need to from a financial perspective and begin delivering to our shareholders better returns as we go forward and something that know that uh this is very important for us and one that we&#39;ve spent a lot of time with the board looking at you know that we do have the financial capacity to finish what we started and we believe the steps that we&#39;ve taken clearly allow us to do that and we&#39;re executing those very effectively and uh finding uh good momentum we&#39;re going to finish them quickly and then move on to the next phase of getting back to delivering the best things that our customers want for the future on both The Foundry and the product side clearly the product side redoubling around the x86 franchise for both client and data center and again today&#39;s announcement with AWS reinforces that particularly on the custom x86 side of the data center business as well and the stock is up more than 8 and a half% right now in overtime after being up more than six in the regular session Pat goner CEO of Intel thanks for joining us here on overtime and we were just talking about the 18a process don&#39;t miss much more on the chips industry and we&#39;re back back Alibaba update here&#39;s some notes from Morgan Stanley the bull argument stabilizing e-commerce market share has been seen with gross merchandise value growing in line with the industry in July and August plus 6% uh according to NBS two benefits from technology service fees and Statewide sitewide marketing tools should improve monetization rates we covered that a few weeks ago with CMR potentially growing in line with gmv by 3Q which would be unbelievable three earnings visibility seems relatively better versus Ecom peers due to a manageable low single digigit um decline in TTG iidot and loss reductions from non-core businesses that meaning they all got to break even or profitable for Bulls view valuation as attractive uh at 7 to eight times PE with cap with additional Capital return dividends and BuyBacks of 9 to 10% a year aided by near-term fund flow support after the the southbound connect inclusion and they go through all the money that came in you can read this since the southbound connect by day and the percentage of volume and then Brendan Ahern posted you know the percentage of now that they&#39;re part of the southbound connect you can see how much stock the company&#39;s buying back on a daily basis um so there we are so um for instance here he shows that Baba buyback volume was 14% of the adrs volume yesterday on the day that he posted last week um 2.1 billion US of net buying southbound connect the first week which again annual would be 50 it&#39;s not going to be 5050 but if it&#39;s 20 to 40 it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s big time um they bought back yeah and it&#39;s just showing by day the percentage of the volume I mean some days they&#39;re almost 9% of the volume the companies in the market buying all the stock it&#39;s mindboggling so great data out of brandan Ahern check out his daily newsletter at chinal last night.com um five key points which we covered managers are still skeptical which implies after some normal seasonal volum markets can climb the wall worry to new highs two managers belief that policy is too restrictive resembles prior periods that were generational buy areas not to be sold we&#39;ve covered these fear and greed mid-range again that&#39;s why it&#39;s like God do you want to be a a contrarian when it&#39;s kind of in neutral and the answer is not really so uh biotech earnings uh the equal weight down 3.1 which I&#39;m going to assume is attributable to one or two stocks and it looks like it&#39;s insm and it looks like it [Music] is M uh Mr modna again pcvx Etc whereas the cap weighted uh are flatter 74 basis points for next year all right now I got to go through these ask me anything questions um I will get through as many as I can tonight and I&#39;ll do the rest next week when we have more time so let&#39;s take the first question here which is all right any thoughts on ANF it&#39;s consumer discretionary which I&#39;m interested in the group any thoughts on a&amp;f you&#39;re giving me a stock that just did a 15 bagger and you want to know if you should buy it no that looks like a good short um I&#39;m sure the numbers are going to look great we we&#39;re just not going to do it but thank you VIN uh on to the next and Vin I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re new so welcome to the podcast and um hang in there you are going to learn a lot and we&#39;re so excited to have you and that was great that you sent in a question um we&#39;re just going to pass on that one for now it&#39;s already made the move that it&#39;s going to make for the time being and we&#39;ll revisit it if it comes in 50 60% but we like to buy things when no one wants them and right now everyone wants ANF and that&#39;s not for us um all right let&#39;s see ama question Red Robin yeah I&#39;m looking at some of these restaurant stocks too uh that&#39;s from Frank re e d r o b i n I feel like there&#39;s got to be a wash out there&#39;s so much competition but uh so this is still cash flow negative so I&#39;m probably going to be a pass it&#39;s not doesn&#39;t even look like it&#39;s close to Turning positive cash flow and in a turn well yeah it&#39;s actually goodness it&#39;s training like it&#39;s going out of business uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet 23 million all right so they&#39;ve got small amount of cash 23 million if this is right you got to check it with the public filings and 200 million of debt I didn&#39;t realize it was such a small business uh income statement revenues have been declining for or flat to declining losing money I don&#39;t really see how they&#39;re going to turn around so you have to see when their debt is due and yeah this is a don&#39;t touch for us but maybe it works as a trade I it just seems like a business in secular decline all right let&#39;s see here got a lot of emails all right Luke him and hers we&#39;ve covered before and not for me all right let&#39;s see what else we got here all right Frederick here from your fan this is Frederick hammerstrom Frederick here from your fans at the beers and Baba investment Club in Sweden we&#39;re forever grateful for your time sharing your knowledge in question in which type investment cases are you a proponent of building a detailed model of the investment EG with underlying business drivers such as volumes cost based Etc versus a more backof the envelope calculations uh we do detailed model on every business that we enter back of the napkin is more for AMA uh you really have to drill down and do the work you you would do you do the same analysis that you would do to buy a private business is really what it comes down to how detailed would you be if you were going to put your life savings into buy one business and that&#39;s the kind of analysis you should do when you buy a public company even if you&#39;re buying eight to 12 of them um thanks for the question and uh cheers to the beers and Baba guys in Sweden Jan Torsten thanks for all the great content uh he&#39;s asking about long-dated options I mean the key when you do option positions is that you should have an a very high expected value so if you&#39;re putting 1 to two% of equity you want ideally a 3 to 10x EV and maybe a blended if you&#39;ve got five or 10% of your portfolio in in such instruments uh Blended EV of you know call it 5x so that 10% of the portfolio could generate 50% returns and then you know some aren&#39;t going to work and they&#39;re going to expire worthless some of you are going to roll and some are going to exceed your expectations but uh it&#39;s the highrisk high reward portion of your our our allocation that uh gives us some excess returns um but we expect a number of them not to work so uh but the ones that do work work so magnificently that they generate a lot of excess return so I would leave it there and then wow I think I got to all of them let me just see uh Jimmy Jones is saying is it true that Baba can only repurchase 10% of their shares per calendar so why no they have a buyback authorization I think it&#39;s at 24 billion or something but they can re they can up that if they&#39;re getting close through to it uh they can up it again that the board can meet and authorize a larger buyback authorization so it&#39;s kind of a meaningless cap that that uh does mean nothing okay uh Casper D says Big Time listener from the Wells Fargo days oh there you go thanks for all you doing was looking for exposure to UK and came across easy jet uh I&#39;m not a huge fan of uh Airline carriers uh I&#39;m gonna say pass I I&#39;d rather just not do it it&#39;s a it&#39;s a garbage business and um with those you want to wait for crises and then try to I mean I I I definitely if this was any other business that had these characteristics that you&#39;re showing me here margins recovering revenues recovering cash flow recovering price still down well actually price is not down pric is up prices doubled off the bottom so it&#39;s kind of already recovered when you&#39;re bringing it to me Casper um could it go higher yeah but by the time thing is it it&#39;s not a good enough business to buy when it&#39;s already doubled off the bottoms like you want to buy it when no one wants it and then the only reason you&#39;re buying it is because you think you have an edge that it&#39;s not going to go out of business and you&#39;re going to get your quick double like someone else already did before you gave me this idea so you&#39;re thinking is correct but for that industry there young man knows the rules the old man knows the exceptions this is an exception so um but uh thanks for sending that in and we&#39;re done so with that said we&#39;ll be back next week probably on our normal time uh and we&#39;ll see you then in the meantime make it a great one bye for now [Music] a [Music] [Music] m [Music]
