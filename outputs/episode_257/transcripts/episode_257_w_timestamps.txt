[173.84s] media
[175.959s] and
[178.12s] on this morning I was able to
[182.76s] join uh
[185.36s] stvy on Fox Business so I want to thank
[190.64s] uh Christian dagger Preston miselle and
[194.48s] Stuart Barney as well as Lauren
[196.48s] Simonetti for having me on the show
[199.599s] we&#39;re going to talk some fed stuff we&#39;re
[201.36s] going to talk some Intel developments
[203.72s] and some Bank of Japan so we&#39;re going to
[205.879s] listen in here 142 uh Thomas Hines join
[210.0s] joins me this morning what do these
[211.84s] retail sales numbers mean for the market
[213.64s] do you think well I think it shows a
[215.72s] continued resilience of the economy a
[217.76s] continued resilience of the consumer uh
[220.239s] I think as it relates to the FED which
[222.2s] is the big question for this week it
[224.36s] probably gives them cover to just start
[226.439s] with 25 to get their feet wet tomorrow
[228.76s] 25 basis point cut versus 50 does it
[231.04s] matter 25 basis points 50 basis points
[233.519s] doesn&#39;t really matter that much does it
[235.159s] if the downtrend is in place after four
[237.2s] years of nothing I think you&#39;re exactly
[239.2s] right I I I think that&#39;s what they&#39;re
[240.4s] going to do the big thing though that
[242.72s] very few people are paying attention to
[244.2s] what they&#39;re paying attention to is 65%
[246.76s] chance of a 50 basis point cut tomorrow
[248.879s] that&#39;s in the FED funds Futures Market I
[250.599s] think that&#39;s a little bit aggressive the
[252.56s] key thing this week is not so much what
[254.2s] happens on Wednesday what happens on
[255.92s] Friday with the bank of Japan if you
[257.799s] remember in early August the bank of
[260.079s] Japan hiked when the FED didn&#39;t move and
[263.08s] that created a liquidity mismatch and
[265.0s] the Nik fell 25% so if the FED goes 25%
[269.08s] 25 BAS points the bank of Japan needs to
[271.52s] hold Pat and do zero if they go 50 Bank
[274.88s] of Japan can hike 25 uh and things will
[277.52s] be okay but you don&#39;t want a situation
[279.759s] where the bank of Japan starts to unwind
[282.44s] that carry trade Again by going more
[283.919s] aggressively than the FED other
[285.8s] direction it&#39;s just getting very
[286.88s] complicated is it looking at the bank of
[288.68s] Japan to the Federal Reserve 50 B Point
[291.479s] lot of I think the bottom line is that
[293.68s] stocks go up typically the S&amp;P goes up
[295.8s] 133% in the 6 months after a rate cut
[298.84s] Okay so if you&#39;re doing well in the
[300.56s] market you&#39;ll continue to do well I&#39;ve
[302.6s] got to deal with this last time you were
[304.12s] on the show you said that intel was
[306.16s] worth buying and at that time was what
[308.479s] 19 20 bucks a share yeah everyone was
[310.24s] hiding under the desk and and uh during
[312.24s] the break he said Tom what do you think
[313.88s] I said absolutely buy it it&#39;s trading at
[315.8s] tangible book if they liquidate the
[317.24s] thing tomorrow you get your money back
[318.759s] oh and by the way there might be upside
[320.44s] people are talking about Intel like it&#39;s
[322.0s] going out of business this is a this is
[323.36s] a business that did $50 billion of
[325.52s] Revenue in the last 12 months and people
[327.039s] are worried about solvency I&#39;ll tell you
[328.88s] what three big announcement since we saw
[331.12s] yesterday they&#39;re partnering with Amazon
[333.919s] for AWS to do an AI customized chip they
[336.84s] got $3 billion contract from the
[338.72s] Department of Defense and they&#39;re moving
[340.96s] The Foundry business into a subsidiary
[343.039s] so they can raise outside Capital
[344.479s] without diluting the sh buy it at 21 I
[346.759s] like it at 21 I like it at 20 I like it
[348.68s] at 19 and it&#39;s going to 30 40 plus over
[351.96s] time okay Thomas H thanks for being with
[354.08s] us thanks for always coming up and we&#39;re
[357.199s] back and then we&#39;re going to move on to
[360.0s] a little bit of technical analysis here
[363.199s] from slomer over at RBC thanks to my
[366.12s] buddy over there uh so it&#39;s very
[369.68s] interesting and I&#39;m struggling with this
[371.8s] a little bit it&#39;s kind of playing out
[374.56s] according to plan if you remember we had
[377.12s] talked about and showed the election
[378.8s] year seasonality where we were hoping to
[381.24s] get some strength and start to touch on
[382.919s] new highs by midep which would be
[385.319s] coincident with the first cut buy the
[387.84s] rumors sell the news and then election
[390.12s] year seasonality choppiness into the end
[392.199s] of October before a year- end rally so I
[395.039s] went
[396.0s] through uh quite a few stocks and I was
[398.72s] looking okay do I want to put a market
[401.24s] hedge on well first thing I said is
[404.12s] what&#39;s fully value that we are F fully
[406.84s] value that we haven&#39;t already taken
[408.68s] profits and if you remember we took a
[410.12s] lot of profits in July from the mag 7
[413.84s] before they rolled over we took a lot of
[415.639s] profits from the banks that had had gone
[417.479s] up a lot uh we went over that all that
[419.879s] stuff a couple of weeks ago um so I kept
[424.28s] looking stock by stock and I was like
[425.96s] there&#39;s nothing near or over intrinsic
[430.84s] value that we want to sell into this
[434.16s] quote predicted weakness that may be
[436.4s] coming in a few weeks so then I said all
[439.039s] right so then why don&#39;t I put some
[441.319s] spreads uh uh or some tactical shorts on
[445.24s] the
[446.599s] indices and I went through the you know
[449.72s] I figured the easy ones would be the SMH
[453.52s] semiconductors um maybe QQQ maybe xlk
[458.08s] Tech centered stuff and yeah they&#39;re a
[460.319s] little stretched but they&#39;re not really
[462.4s] at extremes pound the table like when we
[464.72s] wrote that article about Nvidia on June
[467.96s] 20th which was literally the top and it
[470.44s] and it fell 30% right after that uh
[473.199s] there was there&#39;s nothing like screaming
[476.4s] obvious that doesn&#39;t mean they all can&#39;t
[479.199s] go down in the next 6 weeks um but the
[482.84s] risk reward is not perfect and when I
[485.68s] started to look for okay how else could
[487.8s] I express a tactical short or a
[490.28s] short-term Hedge for the next six
[493.319s] weeks honestly in looking at hundreds of
[496.96s] stocks the only ones that I saw that
[499.479s] looked imminently aggressively shortable
[503.479s] were utilities and as you know we were
[507.199s] pounding the table last fall fall to buy
[509.919s] utilities when no one wanted utilities
[511.72s] and now that they&#39;re up 50% everyone
[513.88s] wants utilities now you say Tom that
[515.8s] sounds crazy if they&#39;re going to cut
[517.0s] rates utility should keep going
[520.44s] up and and that&#39;s something that I&#39;m
[523.719s] thinking through and I agree with in
[527.08s] terms of longer term but I think in
[530.24s] short term I think a couple of things
[532.64s] could happen uh one it could certainly
[535.16s] be by the rumor sell the news in terms
[537.279s] of utilities uh second the other thing
[540.72s] that I started to think about over
[541.959s] dinner was hypothetically if they did
[545.399s] 50 and people got past the shock shock
[548.68s] effect and they started thinking oh my
[551.68s] goodness the economy is going to grow
[554.079s] faster than we expected because they&#39;re
[555.64s] front loading all of these Cuts versus
[558.72s] an interpretation like oh they&#39;re doing
[560.8s] 50 basis cuts the the the world is
[563.079s] coming to an end they must know
[564.32s] something we don&#39;t know but let&#39;s just
[566.079s] assume they did 50 which I&#39;m still in
[568.56s] the camp they&#39;re going to do 25 but if
[570.88s] they did 50 and then the narrative
[572.92s] shifted to wow this liquidity is going
[576.079s] to be massive and things are going to
[578.16s] that would be a scenario where
[579.959s] defensives would sell off and rates
[582.079s] would tick back up because people would
[584.959s] expect faster growth than
[587.6s] expected and it sounds counterintuitive
[590.04s] and you see the longer end of the curve
[591.72s] and some of the interest rate sensitives
[593.64s] that have had rallies in anticipation of
[596.12s] this take a breather um that that said
[600.0s] when you&#39;re looking to uh do a tactical
[603.24s] short to protect against the overall
[605.04s] indices maybe coming in a little bit for
[607.64s] a seasonal period defensives is not
[610.839s] really what you want to short because
[613.24s] technically if the Market&#39;s going to
[615.72s] correct five or 10% defensive should
[618.92s] stay strong in that environment and
[620.8s] looking across hundreds of large cap
[622.88s] stocks today for some themes uh the 10
[626.6s] or 15 that I said I could short today
[629.079s] were we&#39;re all basically in the
[630.64s] utilities and re groups uh and that&#39;s
[634.12s] not the way to do a tactical short or a
[636.88s] hedge so with the inability to want to
[643.2s] sell anything because it&#39;s not anywhere
[645.56s] near our
[646.839s] predefined uh uh fair value or euphoric
[651.56s] value where we&#39;ll we&#39;ll sell some of it
[653.279s] as well and
[657.399s] the mag 7 and not recovering as
[661.2s] aggressively as I thought it might into
[663.72s] the cuts to Resort or or sell off
[668.399s] Etc um the risk reward to allocating one
[672.76s] or 2% cap capital to shorts as of today
[677.92s] is not as attractive as I thought it
[681.12s] might be uh going into the first cut
[685.8s] again it doesn&#39;t mean the market won&#39;t
[687.2s] pull back 5 or 10% between now and the
[689.399s] election and then rally back and then
[691.279s] some before the end of the year um but I
[694.44s] would like to see a more extreme
[695.8s] situation the other thing we have in
[698.24s] hand which we&#39;re going to discuss is the
[700.0s] Bank of Japan meeting on Friday and it&#39;s
[703.6s] it&#39;s widely expected that they are going
[706.24s] to hold and do nothing so if the FED
[709.72s] Cuts 25 and they do nothing like I said
[712.44s] with with um with
[716.079s] Stuart uh that&#39;s probably a reasonably
[718.839s] bullish set up If the Fed Cuts 50 and
[722.12s] Bank of Japan either does zero or 25 my
[725.16s] guess if the FED Cuts 50 that&#39;s going to
[726.92s] give room for the bank of Japan to hike
[729.2s] 25 which they want to do because their
[731.36s] inflation is starting to
[733.079s] go
[735.079s] um that would be fine but if the FED
[737.959s] Cuts
[739.279s] 25 and Bank of Japan hikes 25 I think
[743.399s] you&#39;re going to have another early
[745.399s] August situation and I think that&#39;s low
[748.16s] probability so the context that I&#39;m
[751.36s] laying out is the best scenario I see
[755.0s] right now unless we get further strength
[758.12s] in the next few days or weeks where some
[760.199s] things get stretched and then we can
[761.88s] really put high risk High reward to risk
[765.92s] tactical shorts on to dampen some
[768.24s] volatility and create some extra cash to
[771.04s] go long uh into the
[773.72s] election um I think right now the best
[777.199s] risk reward is just to hold great
[779.76s] companies with low leverage that uh that
[783.8s] we love and do nothing but sit on our
[786.959s] hands unless we plow through new highs
[790.56s] in the next few days or
[792.36s] week um uh at which time we would we
[795.6s] would take one to two% of equity capital
[797.88s] and get some shorts on but uh I would
[801.199s] say that&#39;s you know a coin flip at this
[803.92s] point so so that&#39;s how we&#39;re thinking
[805.279s] through this and I guess the answer is
[807.48s] you know after this beautiful week here
[809.68s] and we&#39;ve got got a lot of gains in the
[811.72s] last week um expect some bumpiness and
[814.6s] volatility for the next six weeks but
[816.279s] have no fear like last year where we
[818.519s] made the vast majority of the gains in
[821.6s] the last uh six weeks it was
[824.32s] unbelievable we made more money in a
[826.279s] shorter period of time it was it was
[829.32s] mindboggling uh I think we&#39;re going to
[831.0s] see the exact same situation once we get
[832.88s] the election clearance so we&#39;ll try to
[834.839s] use any weakness as an opportunity to
[837.44s] build positions in October
[839.72s] and late October if we get some nice
[842.519s] surprise strength in the next few days
[844.48s] or week even though we&#39;re moving into a
[846.04s] period of seasonal weakness we may use
[848.04s] that for some tactical shorts but just
[851.04s] know we&#39;re hodlers and we&#39;re cognizant
[854.639s] of the period that we&#39;re entering and if
[856.72s] the risk reward sets up to do something
[858.519s] we&#39;ll do it if not we&#39;re just going to
[859.92s] hold through and buy on weakness and
[862.24s] then ride the year end rally uh like
[864.399s] nobody&#39;s business so that&#39;s kind of
[865.72s] where we came out because that&#39;s
[866.88s] something we&#39;ve been talking about and
[868.199s] it&#39;s playing out as anticipated it&#39;s
[870.6s] just I&#39;m not finding the fat pitch down
[873.6s] the- middle shorts that I had expected
[875.759s] to find uh at this time which tells me
[879.8s] when everyone&#39;s looking for a correction
[882.399s] you may not get it and um for all we
[887.44s] know you get a 50 basis point cut yeah
[890.56s] people will cry foul as far as
[892.959s] political uh possible political
[895.48s] interference there will be a lot of talk
[897.32s] about that but but it may lead to the
[901.56s] market going up straight up into the
[903.199s] election which would absolutely surprise
[905.8s] everyone and no one is really positioned
[907.88s] for based on some of the sentiment we&#39;re
[909.44s] going to talk about it would go against
[912.0s] all first cut history it would go
[915.44s] against all election year seasonality
[918.04s] history and that&#39;s what the market is
[920.36s] designed to do fool most of the people
[922.12s] most of the time and based on me wanting
[924.6s] to put on tactical shorts today looking
[927.32s] at new highs in the Dow and looking at
[929.519s] this and that and not finding any fat
[932.12s] pitches it tells me from looking under
[935.319s] the surface that it may not be as
[937.48s] obvious as everyone is expecting and it
[939.8s] may actually fake some people out so
[941.959s] we&#39;ll see the beauty is looking at our
[944.56s] core companies we run a concentrated
[946.8s] portfolio what we&#39;re excited about is we
[949.04s] really don&#39;t care what the General
[950.279s] market does over the next six weeks
[952.12s] because none of them are close to our
[953.839s] intrinsic value targets that we uh
[957.0s] Define before we even got into the
[958.519s] position all wars are won before the
[960.6s] first battle is fought and um and
[963.12s] they&#39;re just moving slowly steadily uh
[965.6s] some quickly some slowly uh in the
[968.279s] direction that we had intended at
[969.639s] Inception so we&#39;re excited about that
[971.839s] let&#39;s look at the General market here so
[973.36s] it&#39;s up against a Fibonacci extension
[975.48s] which implies that it should do what the
[979.079s] seasonality implies which would be kind
[981.319s] of uh come off that strength it doesn&#39;t
[985.12s] preclude it from actually busting
[987.319s] through to the next one either and um so
[991.279s] you see that you see a lot of these
[993.88s] coming up against the resistance where
[995.68s] you know cup and handle if you break out
[997.399s] you&#39;re going to keep running this is uh
[1000.759s] on the daily chart this is the NASDAQ so
[1004.04s] this didn&#39;t get up to new highs which
[1006.12s] could imply it&#39;s a Head and Shoulder top
[1008.48s] or
[1010.92s] whatever and it&#39;s just going to roll
[1012.68s] back down to the shoulder line and
[1014.16s] either break or or reject
[1016.319s] it um I would love to see this get back
[1019.88s] to retest that and that&#39;s what would
[1022.0s] create some fat pitches for us but it
[1024.48s] doesn&#39;t appear that that&#39;s in the cards
[1027.039s] uh if it maybe it Go moves up to here
[1029.72s] but in other words we got the strength
[1031.919s] back by midep but we didn&#39;t get enough
[1035.079s] of it that to create fat pitches to get
[1036.919s] shorts on into the October weakness so
[1039.919s] that&#39;s where we are then if you look at
[1041.319s] the equal weight index is just breaking
[1043.0s] out which is also what tells me that why
[1045.36s] when I looked under the surface why
[1047.199s] there was little to do from a short
[1049.24s] which is perfectly fine with me um and
[1053.16s] so on even the midcap it&#39;s just barely
[1055.48s] breaking out that&#39;s usually not where
[1057.28s] you see a big correction from it&#39;s
[1059.4s] usually where you see it keeps pushing
[1061.88s] higher because of all the disbelief same
[1064.0s] with small caps you know small caps had
[1066.0s] gotten up to here I would have
[1067.559s] definitely expected to check back it
[1069.4s] hasn&#39;t quite got that mid-september
[1071.2s] strength which you know everyone is so
[1073.96s] convinced uh that we&#39;re going to get the
[1076.32s] worst two weeks in the year which is the
[1078.039s] last two weeks of September then we&#39;re
[1079.84s] going to get that weakness at the end of
[1081.4s] October into the election and maybe
[1084.039s] maybe this time will be
[1086.799s] different um but that&#39;s that&#39;s the
[1090.159s] analysis that I&#39;m coming to here uh and
[1093.919s] um even Tokyo didn&#39;t regain that so
[1096.52s] we&#39;ll be interested to see I mean Tokyo
[1099.08s] they could hold Pat and this thing could
[1100.559s] rally back up uh if they start hiking at
[1105.12s] the end of the week then this thing
[1107.08s] could break down so excting stuff here
[1109.72s] but looking through the portfolio for
[1112.2s] clients um I don&#39;t see anyone any of
[1115.6s] them that are over even if they weren&#39;t
[1117.36s] at our full value of where we would want
[1120.799s] to take some off and harvest some
[1122.48s] profits like we did in
[1124.12s] July
[1127.08s] um none of them are at the intrinsic
[1130.2s] value that we anticipate we&#39;re going to
[1132.36s] get from the businesses over time so I
[1135.84s] wouldn&#39;t want to create tax events just
[1137.679s] to avoid
[1139.799s] shortterm uh choppy volatility for a
[1143.0s] period of four to six weeks that&#39;s
[1144.48s] that&#39;s just silly and um and we&#39;re not
[1147.64s] going to do that so uh H hang sang index
[1150.76s] still do you know churning here uh broke
[1154.12s] out back tested starting to work its way
[1156.12s] back up we&#39;re going to talk about some
[1157.919s] of the things that are going on there
[1159.52s] that we&#39;re pretty excited about City
[1161.559s] economic surprise Index this is turning
[1163.64s] up that&#39;s not what you see at tops
[1165.96s] that&#39;s what you see near bottoms uh 10
[1168.52s] years yield is rolling over so we&#39;ll see
[1171.64s] you know it&#39;s
[1173.44s] interesting and that&#39;s the other thing
[1175.48s] that I was seeing you know you&#39;re seeing
[1176.919s] it&#39;s oversold here so I&#39;m like gosh if
[1179.679s] they&#39;re cutting and yields are
[1183.28s] compressed what would cause the 10-year
[1185.679s] yield to go up and that would be they
[1187.799s] expect growth to be higher than
[1189.88s] anticipated now you did see the GDP now
[1192.679s] coming at 3%
[1194.32s] today
[1196.44s] um the other thing I think could be
[1199.44s] would be a surprise 50 basis point cut
[1201.559s] or a 25 basis point cut saying we don&#39;t
[1204.559s] you know something to the effect we
[1206.28s] didn&#39;t want to do a big cut before the
[1208.32s] election or they&#39;ll say it in a
[1210.159s] different way they&#39;ll just say like
[1212.64s] we&#39;re watching inflation but if
[1214.36s] inflation keeps going down we we intend
[1216.559s] to frontload at the next meeting which
[1218.96s] is code for 50 versus
[1222.48s] 25
[1224.88s] um and then on that rhetoric the Market
[1228.919s] start might start to say well the mar
[1232.44s] the economy is not in an emergency but
[1234.48s] they are going to push to do more which
[1236.84s] means growth is going to be higher than
[1238.24s] expected which means yields on the
[1239.919s] 10year even though the um T bills yields
[1245.0s] are going down on the tenure would start
[1247.36s] to go up anticipating greater
[1250.12s] growth um which would favor cyclical
[1253.36s] small caps all that stuff so I could see
[1256.12s] a scenario where yields actually Spike
[1258.08s] on the cut which makes no sense but
[1260.76s] again by the rumor by the rumor Sala
[1263.72s] news uh this does look like it&#39;s
[1265.72s] breaking down so it&#39;ll be interesting
[1268.4s] the next few days but now at least you
[1269.76s] see what I&#39;m thinking but this is an
[1271.64s] interesting Divergence that sler points
[1273.48s] out here 10year yield making new lows
[1277.24s] but you have this RSI Divergence meaning
[1279.919s] a higher low and usually when that sees
[1281.96s] H yields reversed so I I wouldn&#39;t be
[1285.039s] surprised to see the TLT go down which
[1287.96s] is
[1289.08s] um we talked about weeks ago when we
[1290.76s] took
[1291.799s] profits uh TLT go down yields go up a
[1295.96s] counter Trend move in the short term on
[1299.52s] this first announcement even potentially
[1302.279s] a counter Trend move in the
[1304.799s] dollar um is a possibility as well
[1308.24s] because it has moved down a lot in
[1312.72s] anticipation this is again here this FIB
[1317.279s] level or whatever and we could get a
[1319.48s] counter Trend bounce uh we&#39;ll see we
[1322.12s] want to see the Canadian dollar break
[1323.48s] this
[1328.6s] downtrend I wouldn&#39;t be
[1333.12s] surprised let&#39;s
[1336.12s] assume the J the bank of Japan does
[1340.44s] nothing on Friday you would get a bounce
[1345.08s] off this head and
[1347.279s] shoulders up up meaning Yen weaken
[1350.84s] against the dollar in the short term
[1352.559s] which would be bullish for risk assets
[1354.24s] which might take mag s back up and which
[1360.32s] point we&#39;d probably put on some tactical
[1362.4s] tactical shorts if it if it got up in
[1364.52s] the next two weeks before October and
[1366.52s] then we&#39;d have like a four or five week
[1368.2s] short so again we&#39;re paying attention to
[1370.96s] all this but at the end of the day it
[1372.64s] doesn&#39;t change our view on any of our
[1373.96s] core positions but it is an interesting
[1376.52s] time it&#39;s playing out as in in
[1378.52s] anticipated but not with the level of
[1381.08s] conviction where we would want to take
[1382.919s] the other side yet copper if you
[1385.919s] anticipated growth was going to re
[1387.32s] accelerated it could be a story you know
[1390.24s] if if China was going to do a major
[1391.96s] stimulus they would 150% wait for the
[1395.0s] FED to start easing if Bank of Japan was
[1397.88s] going to start hiking they would 100%
[1401.08s] wait for the FED to start easing so the
[1405.72s] other thing is the Bank of international
[1407.84s] settlements
[1409.0s] said
[1412.039s] that which is the Central Bank of
[1414.0s] central banks based in Switzerland and B
[1415.919s] in Basel
[1417.32s] Switzerland that for warning central
[1420.039s] banks not to squander the buffer that
[1424.0s] they&#39;ve built up in other words save
[1426.159s] some bullets for when there&#39;s a crisis
[1427.84s] don&#39;t cut too fast which leads me to
[1430.279s] believe they&#39;re going to do
[1431.96s] 25 but if they did do
[1435.6s] 50 I think after the initial knee-jerk
[1438.559s] people would say oh my gosh growth is
[1440.799s] going to be much faster than we expected
[1442.84s] and no one&#39;s positioned for that
[1444.52s] everyone&#39;s positioned for slow growth
[1446.48s] all crowded into defensives like Staples
[1448.4s] and
[1449.2s] utilities uh cyclicals are left behind
[1452.52s] and I think cyclicals are ready to run
[1453.88s] in small caps rated run whether that
[1455.72s] needs a 50 basis point or 25 with
[1458.12s] hawkish talk if they did 50 that means
[1460.96s] Japan can go now and if Japan can go now
[1464.799s] that means you&#39;re going to also see
[1466.799s] besides the Yen you&#39;re going to see the
[1468.399s] Yuan start to strengthen you&#39;re going to
[1470.08s] see Chinese bond yields go up and that&#39;s
[1472.48s] usually when Chinese equities do well
[1475.08s] also so a lot of very you know and
[1478.679s] what&#39;s really interesting about all that
[1480.559s] talk that I&#39;ve just spent the last 22
[1482.559s] minutes with you going through how I&#39;m
[1484.039s] reasoning through all this it has zero
[1487.039s] bearing on what we would do relative to
[1490.08s] the beautiful companies that we have in
[1491.72s] our portfolio so nothing really changes
[1495.36s] other than getting cute in the short
[1496.799s] term which you know we would only do if
[1499.76s] we have like five to one risk uh five to
[1502.64s] one reward to risk trades that we could
[1505.24s] put on shortterm with one to two% of
[1507.679s] equity
[1509.399s] um and they&#39;re not present yet so we&#39;re
[1513.399s] not going to force
[1515.44s] it other than
[1518.64s] that yeah you can see all these are kind
[1520.96s] of just in ranges not exciting long or
[1523.679s] shorts fizer you know we&#39;ve talked about
[1525.799s] over the past this looks like it&#39;s
[1526.88s] working its way higher
[1528.88s] uh Alibaba same
[1530.6s] story uh looks like the FIB retracement
[1533.399s] would be at 120 sooner is better ladies
[1536.52s] and gentlemen we we&#39;re we&#39;re perfectly
[1538.36s] comfortable with sooner and if you look
[1540.08s] back through history when these things
[1541.36s] finally break through I&#39;m just watching
[1543.24s] this 90 level like a hawk when it breaks
[1545.72s] through that I think it could go
[1546.799s] straight to 120 very very quickly and it
[1549.48s] could have something to do with these
[1550.6s] feds look at PayPal same exact chart is
[1553.159s] happening like crazy right now uh gotta
[1555.96s] love Alex Chris and all the things he&#39;s
[1557.72s] done
[1559.0s] I mean this thing was down at $50 it&#39;s
[1561.08s] now
[1561.84s] 72 and uh the FIB levels according to
[1565.799s] this silly calculator they have start at
[1569.08s] 110 you know this thing is definitely
[1571.52s] going to be a double plus over time and
[1574.799s] uh and we&#39;re excited about that even
[1576.24s] Disney&#39;s coming off the mat I mean is
[1578.039s] this a stock you short right now because
[1579.72s] you think the Market&#39;s going to be weak
[1581.039s] or you sell no it hasn&#39;t even started
[1583.279s] yet um you know do you sell PayPal here
[1587.52s] because you think the Market&#39;s going to
[1588.799s] pull back 5% in it or Disney because you
[1591.399s] think the Market&#39;s going to pull back 5%
[1593.52s] I mean that&#39;s crazy town so no is the
[1598.12s] answer um that was a great set of charts
[1600.96s] from RBC at sler this week let&#39;s go
[1602.919s] through a bunch of indicators real quick
[1604.88s] what I&#39;m try what I want to communicate
[1606.36s] with this is none of them are at
[1608.159s] extremes where I would pound the table
[1610.0s] want to go a different direction in the
[1611.48s] market so we could get some type of
[1614.679s] surprises in the next week which leads
[1617.679s] to strength that no one&#39;s expecting is
[1619.96s] what I&#39;m saying I&#39;m I&#39;m openminded to it
[1622.36s] I&#39;m not betting on it I&#39;m just
[1624.96s] openminded to it because of what I saw
[1627.24s] looking at hundreds of stocks today
[1628.84s] looking for some shorts and on the
[1631.44s] strength this morning and uh I&#39;m not
[1634.399s] shorting utilities I
[1636.88s] mean if they crash they&#39;ll go down 10%
[1640.2s] and you I can&#39;t make five to one on
[1641.76s] spreads on that so I&#39;m not going to even
[1643.44s] risk a dollar so um even the pmo buy all
[1647.72s] is mid range by SPX these are some of
[1650.159s] the indicators I&#39;d like to look at
[1652.48s] pmo Dow Jones same thing the again
[1655.799s] they&#39;re all mid-range which doesn&#39;t
[1658.159s] scream short the market even though the
[1661.519s] seasonality is getting to the point
[1663.279s] where you&#39;d want to be more defensive
[1666.12s] but it&#39;s almost like people did that in
[1668.0s] the early part of September when it was
[1670.32s] supposed to be stronger and now in the
[1672.36s] late part when everyone expected to weak
[1674.159s] be weak maybe it&#39;s strong and that you
[1676.76s] know if the market is designed fool most
[1678.679s] of the people most of the time that&#39;s
[1679.96s] exactly what would happen
[1682.08s] so uh that&#39;s what we&#39;re looking at uh
[1685.0s] even the bullish percent on individual
[1687.44s] sectors there are none the only one
[1690.08s] that&#39;s at a level where I&#39;m like oh my
[1692.039s] gosh let&#39;s start to look for shorts like
[1694.519s] energy is closer to level where I want
[1696.32s] to be finding buys which we&#39;ve talked
[1698.48s] about I think energy is a buy here but
[1701.44s] on a company by company basis the only
[1703.399s] one I like is Comstock but I think the
[1705.519s] group and some of the servicers
[1709.679s] but I&#39;m happy with comto I&#39;m just saying
[1711.679s] those are ready to go gold miners may be
[1715.0s] uh something to look at in terms of a
[1716.519s] short I don&#39;t know we&#39;ll see financials
[1719.48s] we&#39;ve already dealt talked about that in
[1721.12s] recent weeks um still hold regionals no
[1725.399s] change there we took the profits on BAC
[1728.08s] and C over the
[1731.039s] summer uh those were
[1733.44s] great uh real estate maybe the re so
[1737.84s] again if real estate
[1740.76s] and
[1742.559s] utilities right here at
[1745.799s] 100% And real estate at a at 93% if real
[1750.399s] estate and utilities are the only that
[1752.399s] are super
[1753.799s] overbought that tells me that even
[1757.24s] though they&#39;re cutting rates are going
[1759.679s] to go up now what rates are going to go
[1761.64s] up in the shortterm it seems like the
[1764.48s] 10-year yield and for the 10year yield
[1767.039s] to go up
[1768.6s] the market has to believe growth is
[1770.12s] going to be better than they anticipate
[1772.039s] and the only thing I could see happening
[1773.679s] that would warrant that is maybe they
[1776.799s] cut more than expected or you get
[1780.12s] massive stimulus or some positive
[1781.919s] numbers out of China uh which is also
[1784.64s] very probable because China has been
[1788.519s] defending their bonds that their yields
[1792.08s] have compressed on the basis of
[1794.039s] deflation and if they announce a massive
[1797.72s] bazook sua stimulus you would have
[1800.919s] expectations of inflation their yields
[1803.039s] would blow out and Global expectations
[1805.32s] of growth if they get serious about
[1807.44s] hitting their 5% Target would go back up
[1810.399s] and yields would stop trading down uh as
[1813.919s] you get further out which implies a
[1815.519s] steepening curve because the central
[1817.6s] banks would still be taking the short
[1818.88s] rates down so I think that&#39;s a plausible
[1821.76s] scenario that we have to watch for and
[1823.799s] be open for and our position for um all
[1827.44s] right let&#39;s get through a bunch of
[1828.48s] charts this is biotech breaking out
[1830.76s] remember we bought Down in the Hole
[1832.2s] there then we thought we were a genius
[1833.799s] with the thing then it Consolidated
[1835.36s] sideways then it went back and retested
[1838.0s] then it broke out and now it&#39;s
[1839.44s] consolidating the breakout and we we
[1841.24s] think we&#39;re going to continue to go
[1842.399s] higher so we&#39;re excited about that
[1844.519s] basket um all right I want to run
[1847.0s] through these because we&#39;ve got a lot
[1848.64s] what are we at 28 minutes all right
[1852.0s] so I&#39;ll be on Neil Cavuto tomorrow at
[1855.88s] 12: p.m. tune in to Fox bus business as
[1858.96s] well uh foreign investors dump Japanese
[1861.72s] equities remember I was telling you guys
[1864.2s] before August when that carry trade on
[1866.44s] wine I said these guys are going to get
[1868.12s] their heads ripped off and you&#39;re going
[1869.519s] to see the Yen strengthen and Chinese
[1872.2s] equities are going to start to recover
[1873.76s] and Japanese equities are going to go
[1875.24s] down all of that is playing out in fits
[1877.84s] and starts and I think that will
[1879.159s] continue this week based on what Bank of
[1881.72s] Japan does at the end of the week so
[1883.72s] let&#39;s see uh it&#39;s interesting semicond
[1887.559s] conductor production by location China
[1889.72s] has 24% of global share by the way
[1891.88s] that&#39;s an interesting chart uh hours
[1894.639s] need of work needed to purchase a week&#39;s
[1896.72s] worth of groceries has gone down in the
[1899.24s] last year and a half from
[1901.44s] 3.75 hours to 3.6
[1905.559s] hours
[1908.44s] um new vehicle production so this has
[1913.399s] been the issue is that we&#39;re just not
[1915.76s] making the small cars and we&#39;re not
[1917.12s] making the small house that&#39;s going to
[1918.559s] change volumes are going to go up across
[1920.08s] the board uh and you&#39;re going to see
[1922.399s] that coming to a theater near you
[1924.0s] equities typically rally following the
[1926.12s] first bed cut if no recession so very
[1930.039s] hard to get a recession when you have
[1932.96s] now Atlanta GDP now just went from 2.5%
[1936.76s] to 3% for
[1939.519s] Q3 uh whether it&#39;s 2.5 or 2.0 or 3.0
[1943.36s] very hard to get a recession when you
[1944.679s] have GDP growth at that level and you
[1946.96s] have earning expectations of
[1950.0s] 15.4% uh for
[1952.159s] 2025 so even if they&#39;re too optimistic
[1954.919s] they&#39;re nowhere near negative therefore
[1958.0s] this would be the most
[1960.279s] likely uh scenario which as you can see
[1962.96s] in the blue line after the first cut you
[1965.0s] do get this choppiness the first month
[1966.799s] or so which is what everyone&#39;s kind of
[1968.519s] talking about and expecting ourselves
[1970.76s] included which leads me to believe that
[1972.519s] maybe we get the opposite uh maybe
[1975.159s] everyone&#39;s been too cute for this well
[1977.559s] we&#39;re going to find out soon enough here
[1979.919s] is the US dollar Japanese Yen again I
[1982.039s] could see a counter Trend move here with
[1984.32s] the where the Yen starts to weaken
[1985.679s] against the dollar and the dollar
[1987.44s] strength in short
[1989.12s] term uh and uh and that those would be
[1992.08s] the things
[1993.799s] so uh here are the sectors that uh
[1997.08s] outperform 12 months after you see
[2000.12s] financials after the first cut
[2001.799s] financials healthc care that would
[2003.639s] include biotech Industrials a lot of
[2005.48s] cyclicals what what doesn&#39;t do as well
[2008.08s] Tech real estate utilities which have
[2010.48s] all done really well into the first
[2012.919s] cut uh what else does well Staples
[2016.96s] Consumer discretionary this is one I
[2018.519s] want to talk about a lot you know
[2021.039s] whether it&#39;s the VF corpse the Nikes
[2023.279s] problem is I can&#39;t own two sneaker
[2025.44s] turnarounds so uh we&#39;re sticking with
[2027.919s] Brack and Daryl until uh maybe Nike gets
[2030.679s] a new CEO
[2032.12s] but uh dividend yield still cheap
[2034.48s] relative to history value still cheap
[2036.08s] relative to growth These are times where
[2038.0s] generational buys happen and and
[2039.72s] fortunes are made uh two standard
[2042.12s] deviation moves you got to bet with that
[2044.679s] uh growth vers value same thing it&#39;s
[2046.44s] showing that
[2047.76s] dispersion earnings growth for next year
[2050.639s] healthc care is supposed to have the
[2051.76s] highest earnings growth next year that
[2053.48s] helps with biotech estimates have stayed
[2055.599s] up at 2
[2057.119s] 280 um this is another thing why I
[2060.879s] couldn&#39;t find a lot of good shorts today
[2062.919s] this bull bear indicator is nowhere near
[2064.919s] extreme fear and greed no near nowhere
[2067.399s] near extreme National Association of
[2069.639s] active investment managers nowhere near
[2071.399s] extreme aii sentiment nowhere near
[2073.96s] extreme so that&#39;s not an environment I
[2076.32s] like to
[2077.24s] short uh High re rates show hurting
[2081.24s] small business sector profits uh very
[2083.96s] similar to 82 what before you had the
[2087.52s] big um uh rally for 18 years because
[2092.44s] rates started coming down that will help
[2094.0s] small businesses and small caps the most
[2096.32s] here&#39;s the GDP we talked about uh
[2099.04s] mortgage rates are coming down but
[2100.28s] purchase applications aren&#39;t yet because
[2102.079s] we need more Supply we&#39;re going to talk
[2103.8s] about that today presidential election
[2106.16s] year seasonality from 1976 we&#39;ve always
[2108.56s] done
[2109.4s] 1955 but this is what everyone&#39;s looking
[2111.839s] at and you&#39;re supposed to have strength
[2114.359s] in the beginning of September we had
[2115.76s] weakness in the beginning of December
[2117.32s] then weakness at the end of
[2119.28s] September then a bounce in October till
[2121.92s] to low right before the
[2125.24s] election um
[2128.4s] I think this might get a little
[2129.88s] surprising in coming weeks and it really
[2132.0s] doesn&#39;t matter but it&#39;s just something
[2133.599s] to keep in mind this shows the average
[2136.52s] PE versus inflation since 1900 so when
[2139.839s] you have inflation running just two to
[2141.839s] 3% is when you get multiple expansion
[2144.44s] and the average for the last 124 years
[2147.119s] is looks like about 23 times and that&#39;s
[2150.44s] where inflation is kind of sitting right
[2152.4s] now it&#39;s only when you get up to greater
[2156.079s] than 10% you get multiple cont
[2157.64s] contaction to eight eight
[2160.0s] times uh or if growth starts to slow to
[2163.64s] 1 to 2% it would be 18 times but this is
[2167.16s] the sweep Spot 2 and 3% was where you
[2169.16s] get the highest multiple of 23 times and
[2172.24s] we&#39;re a little bit below that right now
[2174.44s] so um that&#39;s interesting Empire State
[2178.04s] manufacturing started ticking up
[2180.28s] monetary policy viewed as the most
[2182.28s] restrictive since the great financial
[2183.96s] crisis these were times uh April 2001
[2187.92s] October 2008 within and and finally
[2190.24s] September 2024 within months if you
[2193.52s] bought you made generational
[2195.52s] gains uh most of the dollar weak
[2198.24s] weakness tends to manifest in the lead
[2200.319s] up to the first
[2202.72s] cut so that&#39;s why I would think that you
[2205.319s] might start to see a counter Trend
[2207.92s] bounce uh New York manufacturing
[2210.2s] expanded in September that&#39;s a good sign
[2212.839s] inferred Freight rates everyone&#39;s been
[2215.04s] saying that Freight rates were going to
[2216.56s] balloon in the fall and that&#39;s what was
[2218.64s] going to throw things off track they&#39;ve
[2220.119s] continued to go
[2221.76s] down uh Empire State manufacturing we
[2224.72s] covered biggest overweight in defensives
[2227.92s] relative to cyclical since May of 2020
[2230.96s] if you were a buyer of cyclicals which
[2232.599s] we were those of you it&#39;s funny someone
[2234.16s] sent me a note um I&#39;ve been with you
[2236.2s] since the Wells Fargo days and the Exxon
[2238.48s] Mobile days we we made very quick
[2240.64s] doubles on that in
[2243.8s] 2020 um so
[2249.88s] this is a time that when everyone&#39;s
[2252.4s] plowed into defenses whether it&#39;s late
[2255.16s] 2008 early 2009 or 2016 or April 2020
[2260.4s] where if you got out of defensives and
[2262.24s] bought cyclicals you made a fortune and
[2264.599s] we did in in those periods
[2267.4s] so
[2272.72s] uh yeah industrial and this is how we&#39;re
[2275.599s] we&#39;re lined up so this is exciting uh
[2279.599s] BuyBacks by corporate clients are above
[2282.2s] 2019 highs and then this is from Ryan
[2285.119s] Dietrich over at
[2286.8s] Carson which is pointing to the history
[2289.04s] since
[2289.8s] 1950 the next 10 days uh next two weeks
[2293.28s] are the worst days of the month so we&#39;re
[2297.56s] going to see if that&#39;s
[2299.76s] accurate but we actually may have gotten
[2302.16s] them early this year that&#39;s what I&#39;m
[2303.92s] saying is to be open-minded because
[2305.599s] everyone is so convinced based on the
[2307.52s] historical data and I just couldn&#39;t find
[2310.359s] a lot of good shorts which tells me that
[2313.359s] it might not be right this year uh
[2316.72s] here&#39;s the GDP now at 3% that got
[2319.2s] upgraded today uh and there have been 26
[2323.24s] dis inversion episodes since 1950 and
[2325.88s] not all of them have led to a recession
[2328.48s] uh and the good ones to look at are the
[2330.72s] double dip there in 82 just like we had
[2333.04s] from
[2334.76s] 2020 then we had the recession in 2022
[2337.44s] two technical recession two quarters
[2339.44s] negative GDP growth I think this is
[2341.92s] going to more follow that where you get
[2344.119s] multi-year
[2346.52s] strength um fund Strat out saying when
[2349.119s] you
[2350.24s] started September this week you never
[2353.2s] wound up with a positive month zero for
[2355.96s] 10 and
[2359.64s] um even if you climb back so I could see
[2362.64s] a scenario where we climb back close to
[2364.64s] even on the month and maybe don&#39;t turn
[2366.599s] positive but it could also be a
[2368.64s] different year A Lot of Things Different
[2370.28s] have been happening because of covid so
[2372.56s] keeping in mind Seth golden points out
[2375.28s] that
[2378.76s] um only
[2381.0s] once has the S&amp;P made its annual high in
[2384.599s] the
[2385.56s] month of
[2388.44s] July okay oh I see what they&#39;re saying
[2390.92s] because we had a high in July so 52% of
[2394.839s] the time December is high of the year so
[2398.319s] we&#39;re going to get the year in rally
[2399.88s] it&#39;s not going to be September even if
[2401.319s] we get a dip in October just hang on by
[2404.8s] January 1 you&#39;ll be fine and um that&#39;s
[2408.119s] that Joel greenblat the secret to
[2409.76s] investing is to figure out the value of
[2411.44s] something and then pay a lot less that&#39;s
[2413.0s] what we do here every single week uh and
[2415.88s] uh here&#39;s another chart from dividend
[2419.0s] growth investor which is basically what
[2420.88s] we do here is we just play the time
[2424.16s] Arbitrage game with low leverage we buy
[2426.72s] when it&#39;s Trad trading in despondency
[2428.68s] well below the margin of safety and we
[2431.28s] sell in some at intrinsic value and the
[2434.52s] most of it above intrinsic value at
[2436.64s] periods of euphoria and this time
[2439.079s] Arbitrage is what we get paid for
[2440.72s] sitting on our hands provid we did the
[2442.599s] right work and the right framework here
[2444.8s] and that&#39;s why you see across the
[2446.28s] portfolio so many have popped quicker
[2448.72s] than expected like the rolls-royces of
[2451.0s] the world we&#39;ve gone through a bunch of
[2452.52s] them go back a couple weeks we went
[2454.079s] through a bunch of them uh uh and some
[2457.48s] take longer but they all work uh over
[2461.119s] time because the framework is correct
[2463.88s] and that&#39;s the name of the game small
[2465.88s] cap stocks beating the S&amp;P 500 this
[2467.76s] quarter as investors expect uh Fed rate
[2470.76s] Cuts that&#39;s going according to plan uh
[2473.68s] here&#39;s from Brendan adern chin last
[2475.72s] night.com Alibaba 10cent and mwan are
[2477.88s] buying their stock are
[2479.76s] you
[2483.0s] um Bloomberg News reported plan okay we
[2486.119s] covered that China internal passport
[2488.599s] revamp could fuel New China growth so
[2492.48s] more of the same Alibaba to benefit from
[2494.44s] more crossb link
[2496.119s] trading uh history of 10
[2499.24s] cent so it&#39;s showing that some of these
[2502.88s] companies when they opened up like Maan
[2506.48s] and xiaoi in the first so 10cent gained
[2509.76s] 23% in the first six months after they
[2511.88s] got stock connect mwan and Zi doubled in
[2515.28s] 12 months which would imply Alibaba
[2517.76s] I think it was at 80 when the stock
[2520.44s] connect happened or 78 or something so
[2522.92s] that would imply you know 150
[2525.319s] 160
[2526.839s] um which I think is is not outside the
[2530.96s] realm of possibility I think it could
[2532.599s] happen that fast because we&#39;ve had it
[2533.96s] pent up for so many years and uh and
[2537.16s] then beyond so we&#39;ll see if passes any
[2540.4s] prolog China to cut rates on $5 trillion
[2543.079s] in mortgages as soon as September so
[2544.72s] what&#39;s the sign significance of
[2547.2s] September I think they&#39;re waiting for
[2548.68s] the FED to cut before they do this
[2550.359s] because they don&#39;t want to have to
[2551.44s] defend their bonds and their currency
[2553.16s] they want those those stuff to stabilize
[2555.319s] so they don&#39;t want to be too easy until
[2558.24s] other Banks start to ease and there have
[2561.4s] been 84 Cuts around the world now the
[2563.24s] FED is actually moving and they may be
[2565.0s] able to move as well Z urges efforts to
[2568.52s] hit their 5% growth Target amid Rising
[2570.68s] doubts uh times ticking you got three
[2573.119s] months it&#39;s time to hit the Bazooka and
[2575.28s] maybe they&#39;ll be able to do something
[2576.64s] more aggressive aggressive after the FED
[2578.559s] moves and that could be why the market
[2581.4s] started pricing in 50 basis points this
[2583.64s] week out of nowhere it was kind of
[2585.16s] strange actually so we keep an open
[2587.96s] minded Chinese chipm shows progress with
[2590.24s] new euv patent from domestic lith
[2593.16s] lithography
[2594.88s] Champion um Hong Kong 3.5 billion
[2598.559s] southbound trading net inflow for
[2601.2s] Baba uh consumer staple stocks are
[2603.599s] looking pricey it&#39;s time to sell that&#39;s
[2605.119s] from D Jacob son sonen shine
[2610.28s] reporter at
[2611.88s] Barons and
[2615.24s] um doing a lot of talking lately I&#39;m G
[2617.92s] to take a little cough drop
[2621.88s] here and we agree and that&#39;s similar to
[2625.92s] the utilities
[2628.359s] theme and it&#39;s similar
[2632.04s] to the REITs and Staples again
[2635.359s] everyone&#39;s crowded into defensives
[2637.4s] cyclicals will start to work why do they
[2639.319s] work because growth is going to be
[2640.68s] expected to be faster than people expect
[2643.72s] and the Catalyst for that we&#39;ve
[2645.72s] discussed some of the possible Catalyst
[2647.28s] China slowdown Spurs calls for stimulus
[2649.319s] before it&#39;s too late so the pressure is
[2651.04s] building China&#39;s first retirement age
[2652.88s] hike since 1978 triggers discontent so
[2655.96s] not only are they GNA have 20 year olds
[2657.52s] rioting on the streets they&#39;re going to
[2658.88s] have 60 year olds rioting on the streets
[2661.24s] with their canes uh Lululemon CEO bought
[2665.0s] up the slumping stock so he bought a
[2667.559s] I think he bought a million dollars of
[2671.16s] Lulu yeah Calvin McDonald so that&#39;s one
[2675.64s] we&#39;re watching too I mean we can&#39;t be
[2678.44s] too concentrated but we do think we&#39;re
[2680.44s] going to see a lot of these
[2681.44s] discretionary stocks turn the corner and
[2683.559s] turn it quickly which wouldn&#39;t surprise
[2686.119s] me if it would be sparked by something
[2688.839s] like China stimulus I mean if China did
[2691.2s] a huge consumption stimulus after the
[2693.52s] FED Cuts obviously Alibaba would go
[2696.119s] through the roof but Lulu would go
[2698.119s] through the roof Nike would go through
[2699.839s] the roof which is part of the reason we
[2701.0s] don&#39;t own Nike because we don&#39;t want all
[2702.52s] of our correlation to be to China we&#39;ve
[2704.2s] got enough with
[2705.319s] baba
[2708.28s] um okay so here&#39;s the big news that we
[2710.96s] covered
[2712.96s] with Stuart Intel solidifies three and a
[2716.359s] half billion dollar deal to make chips
[2717.8s] for the military the rumors of Intel&#39;s
[2720.76s] demise have been greatly exaggerated
[2723.4s] Boeing labor issue likely to be the
[2725.24s] final Milestone before news turns more
[2727.76s] constructive so they&#39;ll get this done
[2729.359s] just like the Auto Workers
[2731.4s] did and then uh the stock will be
[2734.72s] finally Off to the Races new CEO
[2737.72s] everything that you want to see in a
[2738.92s] turnaround 2.1 billion net flows to
[2741.76s] Alibaba in the first week of stock
[2744.28s] connect so if we expect 30 to
[2748.96s] 40 I think we expected 20 to 40 is what
[2751.76s] Brendan was saying on our podcast a
[2754.28s] couple of weeks ago at two a week that&#39;s
[2757.44s] 50 in the year obviously the first week
[2759.76s] will be more they&#39;ve been closed the
[2761.68s] first three days of this week by the way
[2763.119s] and the stock is still strong which is
[2764.52s] pretty amazing to me um Mainland was
[2767.559s] closed for a holiday so there was no
[2770.2s] southbound connect flows Monday Tuesday
[2772.2s] Wednesday of this week keep that in mind
[2774.68s] and the stock is still holding up which
[2776.839s] is pretty
[2777.96s] exciting this was a key article shared
[2780.52s] from uh one of our great viewers about
[2784.559s] from GQ it says it&#39;s time to start start
[2787.079s] wearing Vans again this is dated
[2788.8s] September 13th
[2791.68s] 2024 this is regarding our VF Corp so
[2794.2s] you can read that then another one from
[2796.68s] high snob snobiety Vans classic skate
[2800.599s] shoes look dapper as preppy brogues I
[2803.52s] don&#39;t know about that but uh I do know
[2806.0s] their their shoes are selling because
[2807.64s] I&#39;ve been going into a lot of Van stores
[2809.28s] in the last few
[2810.96s] weeks especially the new schools and
[2813.2s] everything
[2814.04s] else Biden targets teu with Port rule uh
[2818.559s] the beauty of this is it
[2821.92s] crushes Pino
[2825.68s] Duo and because they have a ton of
[2827.839s] business in the US from selling stuff at
[2830.92s] a loss but that&#39;s been funding them
[2833.52s] their ability to compete with Alibaba
[2835.64s] which ended last quarter when Alibaba
[2837.319s] took back share Alibaba is not nearly as
[2840.44s] hurt as
[2841.72s] Teemu uh because their price items are
[2844.68s] higher number one and number two they
[2846.48s] don&#39;t have
[2847.559s] huge amount of traction relative to
[2849.4s] their overall business in the US like
[2851.359s] timu that depends on it and shien that
[2854.319s] depends on it
[2855.76s] so Biden hering pindo Duo teu helps
[2861.8s] Alibaba this is good news for us uh the
[2864.52s] man who made Nike uncool that&#39;s John
[2866.319s] donaho pissed off all the wholesalers
[2869.2s] and they&#39;ll probably can him and the
[2870.96s] stock will turn around uh just like BF
[2875.2s] cour here&#39;s an article from a Blog named
[2878.4s] dividend growth
[2879.72s] investor um it&#39;s from Peter
[2882.839s] Lynch he says the companies that do well
[2885.4s] look out five six seven years and some
[2887.839s] decisions that they
[2889.96s] make may not be the right thing for next
[2892.319s] year and he&#39;s talking about Hubble Inc
[2894.599s] here and he shows
[2898.76s] how sooner or later the price catches up
[2902.64s] with the underlying earnings and we&#39;ve
[2904.119s] talked about that for Alibaba we&#39;ve
[2906.52s] talked about that for uh PayPal and
[2909.559s] other companies and it just showed here
[2912.76s] that the stock did nothing for seven six
[2916.04s] seven years and then it tripled
[2920.359s] overnight or uh 5x overnight from the
[2923.559s] lows here in 2020 uh and earnings
[2926.2s] tripled so
[2927.64s] basically you had the stock triple over
[2931.559s] time which was consistent with the
[2933.68s] earnings tripling and all that means is
[2937.119s] in the short
[2939.559s] term the
[2941.44s] market is a voting machine based on
[2944.16s] emotion in the long term it&#39;s a weighing
[2946.52s] machine based on
[2949.799s] fundamentals and uh and this this works
[2954.24s] all the time this is the framework that
[2956.2s] we use and we teach over and over and
[2958.599s] over Intel&#39;s turnaround is working by
[2961.16s] the dip that&#39;s from Barons uh PayPal
[2964.119s] Life in the Fast Lane for PayPal new
[2966.079s] Partnerships could boost the stock
[2967.72s] that&#39;s from
[2968.92s] Barons um it&#39;s amazing how opinion
[2971.2s] follows Trends this
[2974.599s] is
[2978.16s] uh some quantitative analysis showing
[2981.079s] that in the 13 times that gas prices
[2984.119s] have have saw a 12-month decline of
[2987.119s] similar magnitude the S&amp;P has rallied
[2989.76s] 18% on average over the next 12 months
[2992.68s] which supports our statement get out of
[2994.96s] defensives and get into discretionary
[2997.68s] and these other leopard dead groups that
[2999.48s] are going to benefit from a lot of the
[3001.96s] Dynamics that are happening in the
[3003.48s] market right now man I thought this was
[3005.68s] going to be a short podcast because it
[3007.16s] was only Tuesday but here we go uh
[3009.44s] Boeing Union negotiators to meet as
[3011.24s] striking workers dig in they&#39;re going to
[3014.119s] just start furing people
[3017.28s] and they&#39;ll come to an agreement Amazon
[3020.4s] tells workers to return to the office
[3022.24s] five days a
[3024.319s] week we&#39;ve been talking about that theme
[3026.44s] would happened Intel&#39;s latest move for
[3028.64s] its foundary business is so significant
[3031.16s] we covered
[3032.48s] it
[3038.68s] with
[3040.799s] Stuart key thing is here they can do
[3044.839s] joint ventures like they did with Apollo
[3047.799s] for 11 billion I think on the IR Irish
[3050.96s] Fab uh like they did with Brookfield for
[3053.48s] 30
[3054.72s] billion and the Legacy business which is
[3057.68s] profitable which has been getting
[3059.079s] consumed or cannibalized by the losses
[3062.48s] in building out the foundaries
[3065.72s] um will be able to be more profitable
[3068.2s] because they can side finance that
[3071.64s] subsidiary and do a REV share on the
[3074.52s] subsidiary or some type of economic
[3076.799s] agreement on the subsidiary and let the
[3078.64s] Legacy business throw off free cash flow
[3080.799s] and do it right so all this is positive
[3082.92s] they&#39;re going to slow down Germany
[3084.04s] they&#39;re going full steam ahead with the
[3085.599s] US Fabs which has the US government&#39;s
[3088.52s] backing and that $3.5 billion dollar
[3091.2s] from the chips act this week just shows
[3093.72s] that it&#39;s backstopped as was our
[3096.119s] original thesis us officials uh jet to
[3099.079s] Beijing amid flood of cheap Chinese
[3102.48s] exports big names like David teer and
[3105.599s] big short investor Michael bur are quiet
[3107.92s] quietly upping their bets on the Chinese
[3110.16s] economy with Alibaba by the
[3113.0s] way China seeks a homegrown alternative
[3115.76s] to Nvidia these are some of the
[3117.2s] companies to watch who&#39;s going to play a
[3118.68s] role in that well Huawei is but Alibaba
[3121.88s] is and no one&#39;s paying attention Intel
[3124.64s] aiming to reverse slump unveils new
[3126.319s] contracts and Cost Cuts Intel stock
[3129.24s] jumps on plan to turn The Foundry
[3130.839s] business into a subsidiary and allow for
[3132.4s] outside
[3133.599s] funding Intel to make custom AI chip for
[3137.16s] Amazon multi-billion dollar
[3140.799s] framework
[3144.559s] multi-year the other thing that&#39;s
[3146.2s] interesting about the Bank of America&#39;s
[3147.839s] survey this week is excuse
[3152.079s] me is
[3159.559s] that FMS
[3161.839s] investors that think Global CPI will be
[3164.839s] higher hasn&#39;t been this low since 2009
[3167.599s] when it was a generational buy
[3168.839s] opportunity so the Outlook this is all
[3171.319s] fodder to
[3172.839s] create for the market to climb a wall of
[3175.319s] worry um uh believe in a St stronger
[3178.319s] global economy in the next 12 months
[3179.96s] this is really low this is like 2009
[3182.2s] levels and the market&#39;s at all-time
[3183.72s] highs or near it&#39;s
[3188.04s] amazing SMS sentiment improves modestly
[3191.2s] but it came back in after the Japanese
[3192.96s] carry trade on wine so there&#39;s more of
[3194.88s] that cash levels went
[3197.559s] up reemphasizing everyone&#39;s in
[3200.079s] defensives cyal are going to start to
[3203.839s] move their underweight Tech relative to
[3208.2s] Banks that&#39;ll probably continue for a
[3210.359s] little
[3213.92s] while they all jumped into utilities
[3216.72s] this
[3218.44s] month all jumped out of
[3221.599s] tech everyone wants utilities now that
[3223.88s] they&#39;re up 50% no one wanted them in
[3226.079s] October when we were pounding the
[3228.24s] table US Dollars still overweight by 1.2
[3231.799s] overvalued by 1.2 standard deviations
[3235.44s] Euro is undervalued by

[3256.24s] underweight
[3258.48s] European Japanese
[3261.16s] equities finally after being overweight
[3264.48s] by like one or two standard deviations
[3266.44s] is now underweight by 02 that trade is
[3269.64s] falling
[3271.839s] apart Staples overweight by7 standard
[3275.88s] deviations we said that&#39;s crowded
[3277.96s] Industrials underweight by 1.2 standard
[3281.0s] deviations below its long-term average
[3283.119s] there&#39;s opportunity
[3284.76s] there this is funny utilities is 2.8
[3289.119s] standard deviations above its longterm
[3290.839s] average that&#39;s crazy town uh energy 1.4
[3295.319s] standard deviations it long-term average
[3297.359s] there&#39;s opportunity there materials one
[3299.68s] standard deviation below again same
[3301.92s] thing allocations to Commodities at 7
[3304.359s] year low most crowded trades still mag
[3307.44s] seven it&#39;s coming a little bit still
[3308.96s] short Chinese equities that&#39;s going to
[3313.48s] change and the FMS contrarian trades by
[3317.76s] haret long Commodities long China long
[3321.119s] resources long tech which is kind of
[3323.559s] interesting
[3326.52s] long reats long discretionary we agree
[3329.599s] short bonds yields go up which we&#39;ve
[3332.079s] been talking about short utilities which
[3335.319s] we&#39;ve been talking about short Staples
[3337.44s] short Health Care are the best
[3339.0s] contrarian
[3340.88s] plays very
[3343.44s] interesting as they say on Tik Tok What
[3345.88s] are they say
[3347.319s] nowadays very demure or I don&#39;t know
[3350.839s] I&#39;ve got 10 and 12 year olds telling me
[3352.4s] all this stuff all right so article of
[3354.559s] the week decision days tomorrow
[3356.799s] we went through vanney we went through
[3359.16s] everything about
[3362.799s] the bank of Japan now I want to play the
[3366.28s] 10-minute clip
[3368.28s] from Pat gelsinger CEO of intel on
[3371.559s] Monday night explaining these three
[3373.24s] initiatives that I explained in two
[3374.76s] minutes on Stu Varney let&#39;s listen in
[3377.88s] here welcome back shares of Intel
[3380.319s] soaring in overtime now up more than 82%
[3383.64s] as we just reported moments ago AWS
[3385.599s] becoming a MJ customer for Intel&#39;s
[3387.559s] Foundry business including its highest
[3389.52s] and 18a process and the company will set
[3392.16s] up a separate internal governance
[3393.839s] structure for that Foundry business now
[3395.92s] this comes after Intel announced it was
[3397.599s] awarded up to $3 billion in additional
[3399.96s] Government funding under the chips act
[3402.359s] for the secure Enclave program joining
[3404.599s] us now in an exclusive interview Intel
[3407.0s] CEO Pat Ginger uh Pat good to see you so
[3411.079s] last time I talked to you a few weeks
[3412.359s] ago the stock was headed down right now
[3414.64s] today the stock is headed up up on um
[3417.88s] the coming together of some of the
[3419.039s] things that you said Intel&#39;s going to do
[3421.599s] I got to ask specifically about 18a here
[3424.319s] interesting to see that mentioned with
[3426.559s] this AWS announcement because there were
[3429.119s] some rumors last week about broadcom and
[3432.72s] whether 18a was up to Snuff and and
[3435.72s] working out what can you tell us about
[3438.48s] the significance of this expanded AWS uh
[3442.48s] relationship particularly when it comes
[3444.2s] to ATA and the Readiness of it
[3446.96s] yeah thanks John and always a pleasure
[3448.559s] to be with you and the team at CNBC well
[3452.039s] you know this is a big announcement
[3453.64s] today Amazon&#39;s been a partner of Intel
[3456.039s] for many years but we&#39;ve just taken it
[3457.76s] to a whole new level obviously The 18a
[3460.64s] Foundry agreement for their AI
[3462.48s] networking is a big deal and Amazon is a
[3465.64s] Discerning customer they are you know
[3468.28s] really sent us through our Paces to
[3470.28s] prove that atna is up to Snuff and it&#39;s
[3472.88s] up to Snuff and that&#39;s part of the
[3474.52s] announcement today we also announced a
[3477.24s] custom version of Zeon 6 that we&#39;re
[3479.76s] doing uh with them and together these
[3481.96s] two really emphasize the Better Together
[3484.44s] both The Foundry progress as well as the
[3487.079s] products momentum but I&#39;m particularly
[3489.4s] proud as you suggest that this really
[3491.119s] shows the momentum of 18a it&#39;s healthy
[3493.92s] it&#39;s making great progress and as a
[3496.079s] Foundry you know we see a numerous set
[3498.92s] of customer pipeline opportunities in
[3501.0s] front of us a very big day when can we
[3504.319s] expect not expecting a day cuz I don&#39;t
[3506.64s] want to I mean you had a big
[3507.76s] announcement today so I&#39;m not trying to
[3509.16s] press you too but when can we expect
[3510.88s] more
[3512.2s] 18a um deal type announcements that
[3515.28s] might give investors confidence that
[3517.68s] this isn&#39;t just a
[3518.88s] one-off yeah and as we said you know
[3521.16s] some customers are reluctant to give
[3522.839s] their names because of some of the
[3524.28s] competitive Dynamics but we&#39;ve seen a
[3526.799s] large uptick in the amount of customer
[3529.359s] pipeline activity that we have underway
[3532.359s] since we released the pdk or the design
[3534.72s] specs that customers could start to use
[3537.16s] so I do see that we&#39;ll have a number of
[3539.079s] these that are making good progress and
[3541.839s] do hope to be able to make additional uh
[3543.96s] announcements in the future but the
[3545.76s] momentum has definitely increased since
[3548.92s] the July release of the pdk and the AWS
[3552.16s] announcement today was just a proof
[3554.0s] point of that momentum and we&#39;re looking
[3556.2s] forward to even better things to come
[3558.44s] okay Pat now I believe the Intel board
[3559.92s] met last week was it to discuss a wide
[3562.92s] range of things um and you&#39;re back
[3566.559s] saying you are pausing some of the
[3569.2s] manufacturing buildout in a couple of
[3572.0s] places in Europe here presumably to
[3574.64s] preserve cash and uh you know you&#39;ve
[3577.68s] been a target of criticism for the scale
[3581.599s] and speed of this manufacturing buildout
[3584.68s] did the board endorse the overall
[3587.4s] strategy of continuing this Foundry and
[3590.119s] Manufacturing
[3592.64s] buildout yeah and overall it was a very
[3595.359s] important board board meeting and uh I
[3598.24s] and the board are aligned in the go
[3600.2s] forward strategy for Intel Foundry and
[3602.76s] as we looked at that it was very
[3604.359s] important to say we&#39;re moving to this
[3606.559s] next phase of The Foundry Journey you we
[3610.0s] had this PA this pace that we needed to
[3612.559s] go through to catch up to get back to a
[3615.079s] competitive process technology to build
[3617.839s] some capacity flexibility and as we move
[3620.68s] to this next phase it&#39;s much more about
[3622.72s] building efficiency into that and making
[3625.52s] sure that we have good shareholder
[3627.28s] return for those significant Investments
[3629.24s] that we&#39;re now seeing the end of the
[3631.359s] tunnel as we say 18a uh health and so
[3634.4s] what we&#39;ve agreed is to be very focused
[3636.839s] on the efficiency of those Capital
[3639.0s] Investments focused on the US uh
[3641.76s] Investments first in Oregon Arizona New
[3644.48s] Mexico and the Ohio project and we&#39;re
[3647.16s] pausing our European and Germany and
[3650.2s] Poland for two years and pausing the
[3652.24s] Malaysian project as well obviously
[3654.68s] we&#39;ve built flexibility so we can scale
[3656.799s] up you know but first it&#39;s show Good
[3659.079s] Financial return from the Investments
[3661.52s] great support from the board of
[3662.839s] directors when we started this John you
[3665.039s] know this was a three and a half year
[3666.599s] Journey that we started the line we
[3668.44s] reviewed that thoroughly and we&#39;re
[3669.88s] committed to the future together okay
[3672.799s] now you&#39;re in a cost crunch right now
[3676.119s] you&#39;ve been uh cutting workers now
[3678.2s] delaying these expensive capital
[3680.44s] projects there&#39;s been especially since
[3682.44s] earnings a lot of criticism of you as a
[3684.799s] CEO are you confident that you and the
[3687.76s] board are on the same page on your
[3690.44s] future at
[3691.48s] Intel we&#39;ve gone through a very uh
[3694.24s] intense time and reviewed the strategy
[3697.0s] and I&#39;m committed they&#39;re committed the
[3698.96s] partnership is strong as we finish the
[3701.24s] board meeting we clearly have laid out
[3703.24s] these steps in the future and today&#39;s
[3705.28s] proof points the Amazon partnership the
[3707.76s] secure Enclave you know The Foundry
[3710.44s] subsidiary agreeing and seeing the great
[3713.079s] progress that we&#39;ve done on these cost
[3715.16s] measures all of these align us to the
[3717.44s] Future that gives not just finishing the
[3719.76s] journey that we started together 3 and
[3721.4s] A2 years ago you know but also assuring
[3723.76s] that we have the financial wherewithal
[3725.72s] the balance sheet that allows us to
[3728.48s] finish what we started I and the board
[3730.52s] are fully committed to that strategy and
[3733.359s] quite confident that with today&#39;s proof
[3735.4s] points we&#39;re well on our way to
[3737.16s] fulfilling exactly what we&#39;ve laid out
[3738.839s] to do together Pat it&#39;s Morgan it&#39;s
[3741.119s] great to have you on the show I want to
[3742.24s] go back to The Foundry subsidiary that
[3743.799s] you just mentioned because you are
[3744.92s] standing up this inde dependent
[3746.24s] subsidiary internally within the company
[3748.839s] I mean we&#39;ve seen the reports in recent
[3750.68s] weeks about the possibility of Intel
[3753.279s] considering portfolio CH changes the
[3756.119s] possibility of a split of its product
[3757.68s] design and Manufacturing businesses what
[3760.44s] should investors read into this
[3763.319s] subsidiary being stood up right now yeah
[3766.64s] and there&#39;s really three things that
[3767.88s] we&#39;re trying to accomplish one is it is
[3770.319s] distinct you know it has different
[3772.24s] operating requirements and for that
[3775.16s] service organ organization like a
[3776.559s] Foundry is very different than a
[3778.119s] products organization and we need to
[3780.16s] have the operational skills to make that
[3782.2s] great but second customers are all also
[3785.079s] looking for their Factory to be distinct
[3788.72s] from the Intel products and finally
[3790.839s] we&#39;re looking for Capital optimization
[3793.079s] opportunities investment opportunities
[3795.48s] that are distinct for The Foundry from
[3797.599s] the products and those are the
[3799.039s] objectives of setting up a specific
[3801.16s] subsidiary but it&#39;s clearly better
[3803.52s] together and I think the Amazon
[3804.88s] announcement today reinforces that very
[3806.92s] clearly it&#39;s a Foundry as well as a
[3809.24s] product partnership with the Amazon web
[3812.039s] services agreements today so distinct
[3814.68s] but better together so this is not a
[3816.4s] precursor to you spinning out that
[3818.2s] business no distinct but better together
[3821.4s] and we do see that that better together
[3823.079s] is so important because the Wafers right
[3825.359s] the cash flows from the Intel products
[3827.52s] into foundaries is very critical you
[3829.52s] know that&#39;s the optimization point for
[3831.599s] the Technologies but increasingly as you
[3834.2s] see with the Amazon announcement to
[3835.76s] today more customers want to be able to
[3837.799s] view this as their Factory their
[3840.0s] manufacturing as well and that&#39;s why
[3842.319s] setting the subsidiary structure up
[3844.48s] having clear governance and more
[3846.44s] accountability for those external
[3848.24s] Foundry customers is so important as
[3850.24s] well tell me what this overall you think
[3854.68s] means for Intel um there&#39;s a lot of
[3857.96s] concern about the data center business
[3859.96s] the amount of challenge that that&#39;s
[3861.44s] under how that affects you know margins
[3864.079s] Revenue coming in the door as you&#39;re
[3865.92s] spending on uh on The Foundry and
[3869.0s] Manufacturing side with these
[3871.279s] announcements today how much better do
[3874.039s] you think uh those costs and revenues
[3877.319s] are in balance and you know should we
[3879.92s] expect more of this
[3882.0s] realignment well we laid out uh
[3884.48s] following our Q2 earnings call a clear
[3888.16s] plan on the cost reductions the cap back
[3891.119s] savings the other cost improvements you
[3893.72s] know the implications that that has on a
[3896.24s] headcount or site strategy and we&#39;re
[3899.2s] well underway on delivering exactly
[3901.88s] against that plan that and you know
[3905.0s] these changes that we&#39;ve made for the
[3906.76s] overall manufacturing footprint you know
[3909.52s] we&#39;re confident that we have the balance
[3911.599s] sheet and beginning a process of
[3913.92s] delevering that gives us the ability to
[3916.44s] finish what we need to from a financial
[3919.76s] perspective and begin delivering to our
[3921.64s] shareholders better returns as we go
[3923.88s] forward and something that know that uh
[3926.64s] this is very important for us and one
[3928.279s] that we&#39;ve spent a lot of time with the
[3929.799s] board looking at you know that we do
[3931.72s] have the financial capacity to finish
[3934.039s] what we started and we believe the steps
[3935.96s] that we&#39;ve taken clearly allow us to do
[3938.16s] that and we&#39;re executing those very
[3940.68s] effectively and uh finding uh good
[3943.16s] momentum we&#39;re going to finish them
[3944.799s] quickly and then move on to the next
[3946.599s] phase of getting back to delivering the
[3949.039s] best things that our customers want for
[3951.039s] the future on both The Foundry and the
[3953.279s] product side clearly the product side
[3955.72s] redoubling around the x86 franchise for
[3958.48s] both client and data center and again
[3960.88s] today&#39;s announcement with AWS reinforces
[3963.44s] that particularly on the custom x86 side
[3966.48s] of the data center business as well and
[3968.64s] the stock is up more than 8 and a half%
[3971.039s] right now in overtime after being up
[3972.76s] more than six in the regular session Pat
[3975.039s] goner CEO of Intel thanks for joining us
[3977.359s] here on overtime and we were just
[3978.88s] talking about the 18a process don&#39;t miss
[3982.319s] much more on the chips
[3984.16s] industry and we&#39;re back back Alibaba
[3987.4s] update here&#39;s some notes from Morgan
[3988.92s] Stanley the bull argument stabilizing
[3991.079s] e-commerce market share has been seen
[3993.079s] with gross merchandise value growing in
[3994.92s] line with the industry in July and
[3996.76s] August plus
[3998.76s] 6% uh according to NBS two benefits from
[4002.68s] technology service fees and Statewide
[4005.319s] sitewide marketing tools should improve
[4007.0s] monetization rates we covered that a few
[4009.24s] weeks ago with CMR potentially growing
[4011.359s] in line with gmv by 3Q which would be
[4014.44s] unbelievable
[4016.079s] three earnings visibility seems
[4017.72s] relatively better versus Ecom peers due
[4019.72s] to a manageable low single digigit um
[4023.599s] decline in TTG iidot and loss reductions
[4026.52s] from non-core businesses that meaning
[4029.119s] they all got to break even or profitable
[4031.0s] for Bulls view valuation as attractive
[4034.52s] uh at 7 to eight times PE with cap with
[4038.44s] additional Capital return dividends and
[4040.16s] BuyBacks of 9 to 10% a year aided by
[4043.48s] near-term fund flow support after the
[4045.52s] the southbound connect
[4047.72s] inclusion and they go through all the
[4050.96s] money that came in you can read this
[4053.2s] since the southbound connect by day and
[4055.599s] the percentage of volume and then
[4057.119s] Brendan Ahern posted you know the
[4059.039s] percentage of now that they&#39;re part of
[4061.079s] the southbound connect you can see how
[4062.599s] much stock the company&#39;s buying back on
[4064.92s] a daily
[4067.4s] basis
[4069.52s] um
[4073.44s] so there we are so
[4083.799s] um for instance here he shows that Baba
[4087.68s] buyback volume was 14% of the adrs
[4090.799s] volume
[4091.68s] yesterday on the day that he posted last
[4094.44s] week
[4098.08s] um 2.1 billion US of net buying
[4102.52s] southbound connect the first week which
[4104.64s] again annual would be 50 it&#39;s not going
[4106.52s] to be 5050 but if it&#39;s 20 to 40 it&#39;s
[4109.4s] it&#39;s it&#39;s big time
[4115.359s] um they bought
[4118.799s] back yeah and it&#39;s just showing by day
[4121.96s] the percentage of the volume I mean some
[4123.52s] days they&#39;re almost 9% of the volume the
[4125.6s] companies in the market buying all the
[4127.08s] stock it&#39;s mindboggling so great data
[4129.6s] out of brandan Ahern check out his daily
[4132.04s] newsletter at chinal last night.com
[4136.799s] um five key points which we
[4140.04s] covered managers are still skeptical
[4142.44s] which implies after some normal seasonal
[4144.04s] volum markets can climb the wall worry
[4146.199s] to new highs two managers belief that
[4148.52s] policy is too restrictive resembles
[4150.08s] prior periods that were generational buy
[4152.319s] areas not to be sold we&#39;ve covered
[4157.56s] these fear and greed mid-range again
[4160.319s] that&#39;s why it&#39;s like God do you want to
[4162.319s] be a a contrarian when it&#39;s kind of in
[4164.92s] neutral and the answer is not really so
[4168.52s] uh biotech
[4170.4s] earnings uh the equal weight down 3.1
[4173.839s] which I&#39;m going to assume is
[4174.92s] attributable to one or two stocks and it
[4178.239s] looks like it&#39;s
[4181.4s] insm and it looks like it
[4185.319s] [Music]
[4187.52s] is M uh Mr modna
[4192.64s] again pcvx Etc whereas the cap weighted
[4197.92s] uh are
[4198.92s] flatter 74 basis points for next year
[4202.159s] all right now I got to go through these
[4205.28s] ask me anything
[4208.239s] questions um I will get
[4211.28s] through as many as I
[4213.84s] can tonight and I&#39;ll do the rest next
[4216.88s] week when we have more
[4220.0s] time so let&#39;s take the first question
[4227.96s] here which
[4230.92s] is all right any thoughts on
[4240.28s] ANF it&#39;s consumer
[4242.679s] discretionary which I&#39;m interested in
[4244.52s] the group any thoughts on
[4246.56s] a&amp;f you&#39;re giving me a stock that just
[4249.0s] did a 15 bagger and you want to know if
[4250.76s] you should buy
[4252.719s] it no
[4255.8s] that looks like a good short
[4260.0s] um I&#39;m sure the numbers are going to
[4262.0s] look great we we&#39;re just not going to do
[4264.679s] it but thank you VIN uh on to the
[4269.84s] next and Vin I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re new so
[4273.6s] welcome to the podcast and um hang in
[4277.6s] there you are going to learn a lot and
[4278.92s] we&#39;re so excited to have you and that
[4280.48s] was great that you sent in a question um
[4283.76s] we&#39;re just going to pass on that one for
[4285.08s] now
[4285.96s] it&#39;s already made the move that it&#39;s
[4287.96s] going to make for the time being and
[4289.48s] we&#39;ll revisit it if it comes in 50 60%
[4292.76s] but we like to buy things when no one
[4294.199s] wants them and right now everyone wants
[4295.8s] ANF and that&#39;s not for
[4298.76s] us
[4304.12s] um all right let&#39;s see ama question Red
[4308.52s] Robin yeah I&#39;m looking at some of these
[4310.84s] restaurant stocks too uh that&#39;s from
[4313.12s] Frank
[4316.0s] re e
[4317.679s] d r o b i n I feel like there&#39;s got to
[4322.6s] be a wash out there&#39;s so much
[4323.8s] competition
[4325.159s] but uh so this is still cash flow
[4327.719s] negative so I&#39;m probably going to be a
[4332.44s] pass it&#39;s not doesn&#39;t even look like
[4334.6s] it&#39;s close to Turning positive cash
[4337.84s] flow and in a turn well yeah it&#39;s
[4341.32s] actually goodness it&#39;s training like
[4343.48s] it&#39;s going out of business
[4346.32s] uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance
[4362.56s] sheet 23
[4369.44s] million all right so they&#39;ve
[4372.92s] got small amount of cash 23 million if
[4375.96s] this is right you got to check it with
[4377.32s] the public
[4378.84s] filings and 200 million of debt I didn&#39;t
[4381.28s] realize it was such a small
[4384.12s] business uh income statement revenues
[4386.719s] have been declining for or flat to
[4388.56s] declining losing
[4390.84s] money I don&#39;t really see how they&#39;re
[4392.719s] going to turn
[4394.679s] around
[4396.239s] so you have to see when their debt is
[4399.28s] due and
[4406.8s] yeah this is a don&#39;t touch for us but
[4409.199s] maybe it works as a trade I it just
[4411.0s] seems like a business in secular
[4415.36s] decline all
[4418.52s] right let&#39;s see
[4432.48s] here got a lot of emails
[4445.48s] all right
[4451.0s] Luke him and hers we&#39;ve covered before
[4453.48s] and not for
[4464.04s] me all right let&#39;s see what else we got
[4466.84s] here all right Frederick here from your
[4469.159s] fan this is Frederick
[4471.04s] hammerstrom Frederick here from your
[4472.88s] fans at the beers and Baba investment
[4475.56s] Club in Sweden we&#39;re forever grateful
[4477.32s] for your time sharing your
[4480.36s] knowledge in question in which type
[4483.239s] investment cases are you a proponent of
[4485.199s] building a detailed model of the
[4486.639s] investment EG with underlying business
[4489.04s] drivers such as volumes cost based Etc
[4491.159s] versus a more backof the envelope
[4493.04s] calculations uh we do
[4496.56s] detailed model on every business that we
[4498.56s] enter back of the napkin is more for AMA
[4502.239s] uh you really have to drill down and do
[4503.639s] the work you you would do you do the
[4505.84s] same analysis that you would do to buy a
[4507.719s] private business is really what it comes
[4509.32s] down to how detailed would you be if you
[4510.88s] were going to put your life savings into
[4512.239s] buy one business and that&#39;s the kind of
[4513.76s] analysis you should do when you buy a
[4515.159s] public company even if you&#39;re buying
[4516.92s] eight to 12 of them um thanks for the
[4520.92s] question and uh cheers to the beers and
[4523.36s] Baba guys in Sweden Jan Torsten thanks
[4527.4s] for all the great
[4530.8s] content uh he&#39;s asking about long-dated
[4533.12s] options I mean the key when you do
[4535.88s] option positions is that you should have
[4539.28s] an a very high expected value so if
[4541.679s] you&#39;re putting 1 to two% of equity you
[4544.12s] want ideally a 3 to 10x EV and maybe a
[4549.0s] blended if you&#39;ve got five or 10% of
[4551.76s] your portfolio in in such instruments
[4555.56s] uh Blended EV of you know call it 5x so
[4558.88s] that 10% of the portfolio could generate
[4560.639s] 50% returns and then you know some
[4563.04s] aren&#39;t going to work and they&#39;re going
[4564.159s] to expire worthless some of you are
[4565.44s] going to roll and some are going to
[4567.239s] exceed your expectations but uh it&#39;s the
[4569.92s] highrisk high reward portion of your our
[4573.0s] our allocation that uh gives us some
[4576.0s] excess
[4577.199s] returns um but we expect a number of
[4580.28s] them not to work so uh but the ones that
[4582.639s] do work work so magnificently that they
[4585.56s] generate a lot of excess return so I
[4587.92s] would leave it there and
[4591.52s] then wow I think I got to all of them
[4595.0s] let me just
[4603.28s] see uh Jimmy Jones is saying is it true
[4606.48s] that Baba can only repurchase 10% of
[4608.239s] their shares per calendar so why no they
[4610.4s] have a buyback
[4612.92s] authorization I think it&#39;s at 24 billion
[4615.28s] or something but they can re they can up
[4618.239s] that if they&#39;re getting close through to
[4620.44s] it uh they can up it again that the
[4623.04s] board can meet and authorize a larger
[4625.679s] buyback authorization so it&#39;s kind of a
[4627.8s] meaningless cap that that uh does mean
[4636.96s] nothing okay uh Casper D says Big Time
[4640.92s] listener from the Wells Fargo days oh
[4643.639s] there you go thanks for all you doing
[4644.92s] was looking for exposure to UK and came
[4646.56s] across easy jet uh I&#39;m not a huge fan of
[4650.199s] uh Airline
[4653.6s] carriers uh I&#39;m gonna say pass I I&#39;d
[4656.96s] rather just not do
[4663.36s] it it&#39;s a it&#39;s a garbage business and
[4668.6s] um with those you want to wait for
[4671.84s] crises and then try to
[4685.28s] I mean I I I definitely if this was any
[4688.0s] other business that had these
[4690.04s] characteristics that you&#39;re showing me
[4691.719s] here margins recovering revenues
[4694.12s] recovering cash flow recovering price
[4696.76s] still down well actually price is not
[4699.239s] down pric is up prices doubled off the
[4701.32s] bottom so it&#39;s kind of already recovered
[4703.84s] when you&#39;re bringing it to me Casper um
[4706.4s] could it go higher yeah but by the time
[4709.44s] thing
[4710.48s] is it it&#39;s not a good enough business to
[4713.44s] buy when it&#39;s already doubled off the
[4715.159s] bottoms like you want to buy it when no
[4717.52s] one wants it and then the only reason
[4719.4s] you&#39;re buying it is because you think
[4720.76s] you have an edge that it&#39;s not going to
[4721.96s] go out of business and you&#39;re going to
[4723.52s] get your quick double like someone else
[4725.08s] already did before you gave me this idea
[4727.04s] so you&#39;re thinking is correct but for
[4729.0s] that industry
[4730.6s] there young man knows the rules the old
[4733.08s] man knows the exceptions this is an
[4734.88s] exception so um but uh thanks for
[4738.56s] sending that in and we&#39;re done so with
[4741.56s] that said we&#39;ll be back next week
[4743.52s] probably on our normal time uh and we&#39;ll
[4747.639s] see you then in the meantime make it a
[4749.56s] great one bye for now
