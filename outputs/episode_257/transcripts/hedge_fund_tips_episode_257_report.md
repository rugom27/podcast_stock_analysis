## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points

Overcrowding in defensive sectors presents an opportunity to rotate into undervalued areas. The key is to focus on individual stock analysis and maintain a long-term perspective.

## Risks & Contrarian Flags

- ⚠️ Market may be too convinced of historical seasonality patterns, leading to a surprise.
- ⚠️ Managers are still skeptical, implying the market can climb the wall of worry to new highs.

## Technical Takeaways
The NASDAQ didn't get up to new highs which could imply it's a Head and Shoulder top. The equal weight index is just breaking out which is also what tells me that why when I looked under the surface why there was little to do from a short which is perfectly fine with me
