  "cleaned_transcript": "if you have a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% tax expense declines by 29% uh uh which could have serious implications now uh that probably takes earnings from 275 over 300 but if you add in the multiplier effect and the compounding effect over a couple of years you start looking at $350 of earnings whereas maybe without it we would have been looking at like 310 to 320 a couple years out um which makes us a little bit fully valued here but when you take into effect the tax benefit and the multiplier effect and a couple years out uh makes our multiple look a lot more reasonable which is which the market is sniffing out here with a full sweep of the house and and not just one or two seats but more than that is a big deal so let's listen in here ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nanalysis of this we've got it from Tom Hayes who joins us here in New York this morning can Bitcoin just keep on running well I think Ste Bitcoin is the new vix it's a sentiment indicator and what it's telling us right now is animal Spirits are back it has momentum it has trading momentum and it probably goes to 100,000 based on what I have no idea but it's people are excited about it the policy is uh proc crypto from the from this new Administration and uh it's telling us that people believe in Risk people believe in the future and it's also consistent with what we see since 1932 in election years the markets risk assets tend to Rally into the inauguration and then the first six months of that next year as we absorb policy so not so good it grinds a little sideways a little choppy before the yearend rally you're talking about animal spirits beginning to run Riot again okay are the animal spirits running riot in the stock market are you talking about a melt up here it could be and here's the white swan that very few people are talking about overnight there were some news outlets kind of calling the Republican sweep if that is confirmed the corporate tax rate goes from 21% to % which means the tax expense is reduced by 29% earnings power of the S&P 500 could go from 275 to 354 what does that mean in English Ste it means the multiple of the market comes down from 21.8 times down to 16.9 times which would imply the market is not expensive at 21.8 it could be reasonable at 16.9 if they push that through but we got to have a clean sweep the house has to stay Republican that's right and that at the moment has not been confirmed that has not been confirmed but you had voter out overnight you had a couple other news organizations saying it's it's all but a foregone conclusion so we'll know more in the next 48 hours if that happens and the corporate tax rate drops down to 15% we are going to see some strong economic growth over the next four years like we've never seen before roaring 2000s continues I like the sound of that there you go that's my mannerism by the way all right Thomas thank you very much indeed here's what we have and we're back thanks again to Christian dagger and Stu vanney for having me on um and uh that's that a couple\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\npeople believe in Risk people believe in the future

Bitcoin are going to $100,000 and um you know we have a little bit of Crazy Town happening with uh animal spirits you have to keep yourself grounded because if you don&#39;t and you get caught up in the frenzy and you buy things you know that don&#39;t make sense certain companies trading at you know 50 times sales uh Etc sooner or later like we saw with the SMC of the world that absolutely collapsed uh it comes down to reality so you just have to ground yourself when everything&#39;s moving and we&#39;re going to show you uh what happened in 2016 late 2016 when Trump was first elected with a sweep and what that meant and how there were some early fake outs so uh you don&#39;t have to worry about that when you know what you own and you know why you own it you do have to worry about

with a sweep and what that meant and how there were some early fake outs so uh you don&#39;t have to worry about that when you know what you own and you know why you own it you do have to worry about it if you&#39;re trading on price and fomo and and emotion versus quality framework and Analysis Buffett the most important quality for an investor is temperament not intellect we emphasize that each week and then finally  Charlie Munger all intelligent investing is value investing acquiring more than you are paying for you must value the business in order to Value the stock and that&#39;s why these short-term fluctuations never bothers bother us you know people always like you have ice in your veins well no I don&#39;t have ice in my veins I I have a consistent repeatable framework that I apply across a basket of 10 12 companies and some take off immediately overnight and we re profits faster than we expected and some take a little bit longer but they all work over time when the framework is correct the only thing that can change is if the fundamentals dramatically change then we change our mind but um more often than not it&#39;s it&#39;s a Time Arbitrage game where we sit on our butts with low leverage and when they reach our predetermined uh level of fair and fully valued we just start to lay off as as uh uh everyone else gets excited and uh they want the stock at the highs and we help them out so I put together this list of quote unquote Trump trades because I want to show you what is the setup what was the setup going into the election in November of 2016 right before Trump sweeped and then what happened thereafter here and what you can see here this first one is small caps and you can see it was weakening into the election and then as soon as he was elected it shot straight up a little consolidation straight up and then it Consolidated those gains for about a half a year very similar to what we talked about with Stu where you get a rally into the inauguration and then you get some sideways uh consolidation and chop uh the first half even down the first half before a year and rally and I just want to show you here uh yeah this goes all the way to December so you see this sideways chop into the straight up into the inauguration chop grind even negative into uh late summer and then a year-end rally once again off those lows so we&#39;re going to go through asset class by asset class even the arc uh this is the Kathy Woods um ETF that that had been slaughtered in recent years is starting to show signs of life and as you can see it was Tech based so right after the election it got a little bit of pop and then it rolled over and it was kind of just grinding here until the inauguration and believe it or not after the inauguration when small caps slowed down this speculative Tech picked up and never looked back and was almost a double after the inauguration so if you got most of the games into the inauguration this was where you picked up the mantle and got the biggest gains after the inauguration which is going to be consistent you&#39;ll see with biotech and some of the other things that that people think oh that won&#39;t work in the Trump Administration it&#39;s only Industrials and you know energy which is the exact wrong thing and we&#39;re going to show you why let&#39;s see what um so Arc had been weak into the election let&#39;s see what it did this year so it was kind of grinding sideways to weak into the election and had this huge pop now it probably grinds back before afterwards it&#39;s not necessarily going to um repeat exactly because there were some conditions that were uh um different but we want to keep an you know keep an open mind here because the narratives that are circulating when you look at the empirical data are proving to be completely inaccurate uh here was baba baba was weakening had peaked in October was weakening into the election and weakened for another two months all the way into the inauguration after he was inaugurated in January of 2017 Baba went from $84 to $187 in 11 months so um that&#39;s really interesting because everyone is convinced and by the way he ran on tariffs and protectionism in 2016 and the Border by the way uh same Playbook same hat uh one extra number and this is what happens so on this basis it would not be unreasonable for Baba to continue to be weak until the inauguration although I think conditions are slightly different in that it also wouldn&#39;t be surprising for earnings to be positive something happen with uh with Chinese stimulus or something or other that maybe we take off a little bit beforehand but either way it makes no real difference if it&#39;s a month more two months more uh or not the key is that the Tariff King Chinese stocks did better than ever after his inauguration now let&#39;s take a look at what happened this year now you could start to see why this is going to be such a long incredible amazing call uh I should probably be charging $50,000 for this call and you&#39;ll see why by the end of this the the the podcast um but um we&#39;re not going to do that so uh we want to deliver value and um and go from there so interestingly enough what happened with Baba is it peaked again in October look what happened here early October in 2016 early October in um 202 24 week into the election week into the election and then was weak again for the other two months into January 1st was weak again into the other two months so we could go lower before we go higher that&#39;s not uh impossible at all but um we&#39;ll see we&#39;ve got earnings tomorrow which is going to be a big deal the name of the game is zooming out and looking at the big picture after you had that initial weakness and uncertainty from the Tariff King uh the thing absolutely took off and ripped higher so if we went to 85 so\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nas weakening had peaked in October was weakening into the election and weakened for another two months all the way into the inauguration after he was inaugurated in January of 2017 Baba went from $84 to $187 in 11 months so um that&#39;s really interesting because everyone is convinced and by the way he ran on tariffs and protectionism in 2016 and the Border by the way uh same Playbook same hat uh one extra number and this is what happens so on this basis it would not be

week into the election week into the election and then was weak again for the other two months into January 1st was weak again into the other two months so we could go lower before we go higher that&#39;s not uh impossible at all but um we&#39;ll see we&#39;ve got earnings tomorrow which is going to be a big deal the name of the game is zooming out and looking at the big picture after you had that initial weakness and uncertainty from the Tariff King uh the thing absolutely took off and ripped higher so if we went to 85 so here is  interesting it went from it peaked at 107 in 2016 and dropped to 84 before the inauguration here we&#39;re peing at 117 which would imply uh you know so it&#39;s 10 points higher so maybe we get 10 points higher than the low we would we would bottom around 90 or so versus 85 like the last time so we&#39;re probably close to it maybe we go down to 85 like we did the last time before going to 185 but but um all that is effectively nois the key is is to zoom out see the big picture and it&#39;s going to recover and um and that&#39;s where it&#39;s at then what else 50 which is the IBD 50 which is uh momo stocks growth stocks were weak into the election and then they took off so let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on this year uh a little bit weak into the election took off so maybe we&#39;ll get see some similar stuff like that uh iwm is also small caps shot like a rocket Consolidated into the inauguration and then kind of grinded sideways for a half a year before a yearend rally uh we covered that kweb same as Baba continued to weaken and then after the inauguration took off went from 30 to effectively 54 in less than a year uh equal weight week into the election same story uh semiconductors fell into the election grinded for a few weeks and then continued the uptrend let&#39;s see what semiconductors are doing here yeah same thing kind of grinding it very interesting setups here uh SNP was weak into the election shot up Consolidated those gains and then just kind of grinded higher the whole next year so let&#39;s see what Spy is doing little bit weak to the election shot up and should continue to persist which which be kind of interesting um solar very weak into the election it&#39;s almost as if they knew the election outcome same right now very very weak into the election and then what happened bumped around for two months and then recovered so there might be some opportunity in solar we&#39;ve been talking about the last week or so that we&#39;d be keeping our eyes open and and we will biotech very weak into the election in 2016 ripped higher weak into the inauguration looks a lot like Baba and then uh from 58 to 88 in less than a year so let&#39;s see what this is doing little weakness into the election shot higher grinded sideways so that we could see some weakness um before strength resumes\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n50 which is the IBD 50 which is uh momo stocks growth stocks were weak into the election and then they took off so let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on this year uh a little bit weak into the election took off so maybe we&#39;ll get see some similar stuff like that uh iwm is

into the election shot higher grinded sideways so that we could see some weakness um before strength resumes\n\noil servicers xes had a little weakness into the election straight up like a rocket ship after Trump got elected in 2016 into the inauguration as soon as he was inaugurated complete crash 50% crash in oil servicers from the inauguration till August of that year let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on right now this might be a great short for next year uh um oil servicers so it shot up after the election let&#39;s see if it keeps grinding higher into the inauguration and we may put that on as a short in January uh that could be an incredible short let&#39;s put that down again these things are not going to repeat but they are going to rhyme here&#39;s in uh materials was weak and then just never looked back let&#39;s take a look at materials little week let that could be an interesting long we have a albamar for that already which is doing well communication Services a little weak and grind and then straight up little bit okay we&#39;ll see energy same story shot up after the election after the inauguration was a complete short into August let&#39;s see what happened is happening here little weakness into election shot up so this would be another short after the inauguration as he announces I&#39;m sure drilling on every federal land under the sun they will uh move all the moose and the elk and the Deer uh into retirement homes and drill baby drill XLF uh again was kind of like sh sideways into the election shot straight up and then grinded sideways for a half a year and let&#39;s see here shot up probably grind sideways for a half a year uh regionals I think have a little further to go let me just see here KR yeah same story shot up and then grinded sideways for a year all right Industrials shot up after the election kind of kept going see what&#39;s going on here shot off after the election we&#39;ll see if it keeps going we had a lot of strength okay Tech kind of bumped around for a couple of months and then just continued to persist higher let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening here shot up a little bit after the election we&#39;ll see uh if it continues to persist higher I think there&#39;s some opportunity here Staples was not only week into the election went even lower so if we get a lot of tax loss selling in December and we find a bottom there there&#39;s probably some opportunity in Staples let&#39;s just take a look here so yeah look at this Staples was going weak into the election got weaker and then bottomed in December before recovering completely so probably some further weakness and then there there might be some opportunity there utilities were absolutely week into the election grinding around and then started to work higher let&#39;s see what utilities have been doing week into the election same type of story so there&#39;ll probably be an opportunity in a few weeks to take a look at some of those healthc care super weak into the election Spike weakness again into December and then totally took off I think they&#39;re going to be great opportunities in healthc care weakness into the election we&#39;ll probably see a little more weakness and then there&#39;ll be opportunities so these are places to look um xlu xlk XL V consumer discretionary week into the election never look back and that&#39;s one that we&#39;ve been uh talking about since the summer time to get loaded up on uh discretionary and that&#39;s what happened let&#39;s talk about what else here uh xop I think we covered these are basically oh no these are exploration and production stocks down into the election straight up after and then down into election straight up after this probably rips higher and then that becomes a short after the inauguration or shortly before it uh retail this could get this will probably get hit by the tariffs uh this is going to be a short um week into the election huge rip into December and then straight down from there after the inauguration let&#39;s take a look here yeah shot up after the election that could be an interesting short um and that&#39;s it so there you go there&#39;s your Trump trade 2026 2024 uh now wanted to zoom out on a number of names we&#39;ve discussed on the podcast some of which we own for clients and personally uh across accounts so this is Advanced Auto Parts uh we&#39;re going to cover a little bit about the earnings basically they shut all their unprofitable stuff in the west that they had no economies to scale uh and uh and now they&#39;re going to have an absolute cash machine with this with a clean balance sheet and that&#39;s why the market was rallying uh uh today uh off of earnings so that&#39;s good to see but in the scheme of things this is what their normal bottoming process looks like these fake outs and then it slowly grinds higher and No One Believes it disbelief and then it recovers and then same will happen with Advanced Auto Parts albam Maro continuing to climb higher from those lows when we were talking about it on the podcast Asos it&#39;s been dead money for a year it&#39;s a tiny position and um we&#39;ll keep an eye on it but no reason to add on that yet uh and no real reason to get out either um Boeing uh is trying to really flush out the last few weekends in the stock this makes absolutely zero sense anywhere I have money I&#39;m buying more um personally across client accounts this you know this is one of these that could go to a 100 before it goes back to 400 but uh I wouldn&#39;t bet on that I think this is actually you know what let&#39;s take a look and see what it did under the Trump 2016 I I think we&#39;re going to be referring back to these charts a lot let&#39;s see uh today now that we have a a sweep so it was sideways kind of grinding uh into the election and then it&#39;s and then it didn&#39;t even look back from 100 to 300 in a in a year after Trump got elected what&#39;s interesting about that is it&#39;s been so it basically had come off of this super low in early 2016 and then it you know didn&#39;t go back and test it but it was just grinding sideways doing nothing and then somehow after the election it took off um we had that low in late TW uh 22 grinding sideways didn&#39;t retest the lows uh we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see but uh uh you know what if you look at when Trump was elected right here and then inaugurated the thing just went straight up for the first two years Trump was in office so there&#39;s something to be said for that Bo Baba okay they&#39;ve got earnings tomorrow shot up fake out we covered you know what it did oh here by the way this is kind of interesting this is when Trump was inaugurated right here so it was in a shoot up off of lows pullback this is really rhyming like nobody&#39;s business so it probably goes you know in that theme it could go lower all the way into January barely lower into the mid 80s and then it went straight up to 207 the first two years that the Tariff King was in power so um I don&#39;t like it I don&#39;t like six more weeks of pain I do like uh six months of massive gain so uh delayed gratification there uh we&#39;ll see let&#39;s see what happens with earnings tomorrow uh Baxter same nonsense as the 2014 to 2016 lows that we&#39;ve had from the 2023 to 2025 lows it just keeps doing these grinds and fake outs until it\n\nsideways doing nothing and then somehow after the election it took off um we had that low in late TW uh 22 grinding sideways didn't retest the lows uh we'll see we'll see but uh uh you know what if you look at when Trump was elected right here and then inaugurated the thing just went straight up for the first two years Trump was in office so there's something to be said for that Bo Baba okay they've got earnings tomorrow shot up fake out we covered you know what it did oh here by the way this is kind of interesting this is when Trump was inaugurated right here so it was in a shoot up off of lows pullback this is really rhyming like nobody's business so it probably goes you know in that theme it could go lower all the way into January barely lower into the mid 80s

delayed gratification there\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nBaxter same nonsense as the 2014 to 2016 lows that we've had from the 2023 to 2025 lows it just keeps doing these grinds and fake outs until it finally  breaks out and then recovers big big time we'll cover some of those earnings um bu we've only touched on barely uh CCI this is interesting crown castle uh down because of the rates but this will recover be interesting to see see what happened just for uh you know what and Giggles very fascinating was super duper week into the election and then never look back 57 to 87 over the next 12 months let's see what happened here super week into the election same thing so crown castle opportunity to pick up some more Cooper standard shot up to 17 this week pulled back today on that EV subsidy removal which makes zero sense because all of our models based on IC hybrids are whipped cream and EVS is not even in our model but you know the market has to react with the alos no big deal actually let's see what happened now I'm really curious about all we're going to be here all night ladies and gentlemen but that's fine by me you can you can tune out whenever you don't like it but uh let's see he got it was week into the election I don't have a oh yeah I can make a daily chart here hold on on CPS was weaken to the election shot up pulled back week the election shot up little pullback straight up and kept going interesting okay good middle Cooper standard action uh Comstock resources keeps pushing higher uh diio interestingly enough Emerging Market stock look at this super weak into the election and then took off and never looked back these emerging market stocks unbelievable same type of setup this downward grind low at the election and then took off off the bottom I like that diio Disney shot the lights out today as we had said the parks and experiences were worth 85 alone we thought the streaming TV and movie was worth at least 100 over the next few years today they proved it out 4 million new subscribers we'll talk into some of those details shock stock shot up to 109 and if you remember me pitching it in the 70s and 80s and 90s no one you couldn't give it away uh still people are skeptical so um you know that'll be what it'll be but this thing is just getting going so pretty excited about that uh that's just a Regional Bank ETF s day louder here's another view you just zoom out weakness and then recovery Etsy pretty interesting was in a downtrend into the election continued weakness after the election and then never looked back from 10 bucks to 70 bucks um we'll talk a little bit about that one uh\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nortunity to pick up some more Cooper standard shot up to 17 this week pulled back today on that EV subsidy removal which

little bit more bottoming for the next couple of years but um you know with a two handle this starts to get really interesting with more than a double plus uh we&#39;ll be taking a look at that goose is just doing what it&#39;s doing uh interestingly enough Goose was crappy in early 2017 and then went parabolic uh into 2018 so goose is going to be just fine that&#39;s a China recovery play going to trade like Baba gxo huge rip on the um buyout rumors it&#39;s been grinding sideways we&#39;ll see what happens with that [Music] um hormell uh Intel all the way up to 26 now it&#39;s at 25 bucks down up from 18 so this one this recovery is just getting started interestingly enough saw something similar in uh 200 16 into 2018 JD same fake out pullback that we saw in 2016 after the inauguration and then straight up from there uh Regional Banks this thing is this is this is getting a little bit extended I think uh maybe after the inauguration if it&#39;s in the mid 70s I might trim some profits here because if you remember we bought this way back in the um Silicon Valley National Bank crisis in 2023 so this has been more than a double uh and we want to start to not be pigs at the trough uh PayPal interesting PayPal was putting in a base in 2016 and 2017 a couple months after the inauguration parabolic move let&#39;s see ladies and gentlemen I mean this thing uh again no one would buy it in the 50s and 60s when we were pounding the table uh you know some of the host would look at me like I had three heads now it&#39;s in the 80s so uh definitely going to 100 in the near term and then I think probably a lot more over the next couple of years Alex Chris is doing an incredible job qxo just waiting for a deal announcement at any point uh probably take longer than everyone expects that&#39;s usually the way it works Stanley Black and&amp; Decker same type of basing choppy volatility like you saw in 2016 before\n\n this thing is really just starting to rip um you know you might get a little bit more bottoming for the next couple of years but um you know with a two handle this starts to get really interesting with more than a double plus uh we&#39;ll be taking a look at that goose is just doing what it&#39;s doing uh interestingly enough Goose was crappy in early 2017 and then went parabolic uh into 2018 so goose is going to be just fine that&#39;s a China recovery play going to trade like Baba gxo huge rip on the um buyout rumors it&#39;s been grinding sideways we&#39;ll see what happens with that [Music] um hormell uh Intel all the way up to 26 now it&#39;s at 25 bucks down up from 18 so this one this recovery is just getting started interestingly enough saw something similar in uh 200 16 into 2018 JD same fake out pullback that we saw in 2016 after the inauguration and then straight up from there uh Regional Banks this thing is this is this is getting a little bit extended I think uh maybe after the inauguration if it&#39;s in the mid 70s I might trim some profits here because if you remember we bought this way back in the um Silicon Valley National Bank crisis in 2023 so this has been more than a double uh and we want to start to not be pigs at the trough uh PayPal interesting PayPal was putting in a base in 2016 and 2017 a couple months after the inauguration parabolic move let&#39;s see ladies and gentlemen I mean this thing

making new high uh small caps here little chop into the election uh straight up into the inauguration and then grinds higher for another couple years so we like small caps continued and then interestingly enough VF Corp was building a base back then as well and did exceptionally well as an Emerging Market play after the Trump inauguration uh into 2018 more than a double in uh in just over over a year so uh so we like that and biotech look at this ladies and gentlemen it had put it in its bottom and then little weakness into the election and then after the inauguration straight up broke out to new highs so biotech is going to continue to run this is all about patience ladies and gentlemen now uh I want to go so look I&#39;m telling you right now next week&#39;s podcast is going to be like 12 minutes because uh we are covering four weeks worth of off in one week why because we just had a massive sea change in our political landscape and I want to get you guys thinking correctly because most people out there are going to be dramatically faked out with recency bias thinking that the first moves are going to persist and you as you can see the first moves in some cases are monstrous fake outs\n\n breaking to the upside and making new high uh small caps here little chop into the election uh straight up into the inauguration and then grinds higher for another couple years

I think we&#39;re at the top of the range and we&#39;re going to start to continue to re weaken I want to go through a bunch of Commodities because we haven&#39;t done it in a while and I want to get everyone on board so Bitcoin Animal Spirits through the roof um ethereum rip the thing about ethereum is it actually has some practical use application I have a good friend who um is one of the major people involved in that in size and when he explains it to you you&#39;re like okay that makes sense but the uh the other stuff uh not so sure uh here we go with commercials getting long hedge funds getting short the Euro so maybe a little bit more weakness before we see strength as a matter of fact we saw weakness right into the inauguration in 2017 and then what happened the Euro ripped higher for the next year Australian dollar same story similar story rather British pound already had kind of a move Canadian dollar look at commercials buying hand over fist like nobody&#39;s business uh hang in there Canadians you&#39;re going to get some strength uh Japanese Yen commercials have been buying ahead saw little strength I think that&#39;s going to resume let&#39;s look here we got Swiss frank no one really cares all right what else Mexican peso New Zealand dollar similar to the Australian dollar Brazilian real Flatline South African ran Flatline Bitcoin we covered all right let&#39;s get to the good stuff crude oil commercials have been buying while hedge funds have been shorting uh I think we&#39;re going to see some strength in oil in the short term uh what else we got here gasoline commercials have been buyers while hedge funds have been shorting you always want to bet with the commercials same with natural gas they&#39;ve been aggressively buying okay bonds baby bonds let&#39;s look at this 10 year where&#39;s the 10 year here we go commercial okay hedge funds are the most short that they&#39;ve been since 2018 even shorter than when we called the low in October 2023 and you got to rip your face off r so um the last time they were this short was 2018 and what happened you got the biggest rally in bonds of all time compression of yields uh I think you are going to see a rally in bonds and a compression of yields in coming months so this is a short-term counter move head funds are shorting in the hole and that they there&#39;s a guaranteed ripy face off coming to everyone shorting B bonds right now uh and by the way we&#39;ve been buying some T TLT um okay let&#39;s see what else we got here corn looking closer to a bottom than a top same with soybeans they can take a while to build a base so I don&#39;t want to draw any you know we&#39;re not trading any of these I just want to get it give you a sense of how things are looking in terms of inflation uh a lot of these things are are just coming in quite a bit spring wheat oats Ruff rice canola it&#39;s the SNP that&#39;s the [Music] NASDAQ Russell small caps is just breaking out to all-time highs just like we saw after the election in 2017 and then climbed higher after this breakout so that was the election November 16 then some follow through then it broke out and continued going into 2018 so very interesting see if there&#39;s anything else here we got to cover I go through all these things every week live cattle looks like more like a short than a long um feeder cattle same thing that&#39;s good steak prices come down I like to eat steak uh all right by the way if you ever get up to Ridgefield Connecticut there&#39;s this place called hoodoo Brown get the beef rib it&#39;s the greatest piece of meat you will ever eat in your life um absolutely incredible and yeah interesting all right uh she gold hedge funds are tripping over themselves to buy more commercials are shorting at the top uh I&#39;d take the side of commercials but it could it could persist for many months before it collapses um copper Dr copper shows signs of the economy it&#39;s showing some strength here it&#39;s usually a precursor for China growth they&#39;re stocking up the demand is growing Palladium weak remember when you couldn&#39;t get it everyone wanted Palladium a couple years ago I remember all that asked me anything\n\nhead funds are shorting in the hole and that they there's a guaranteed ripy face off coming to everyone shorting B bonds right now uh and by the way we've been buying some T TLT um okay let's see what else we got here corn looking closer to a bottom than a top same with soybeans they can take a while to build a base so I don't want to draw any you know we're not trading any of these I just want to get it give you a sense of how things are looking in terms of inflation uh a lot of these things are are just coming in quite a bit spring wheat oats Ruff rice canola it's the SNP that's the NASDAQ Russell small caps is just breaking out to all-time highs just like we saw after the election in 2017 and then climbed higher after this breakout so that was the election November 16 then some follow through then it broke out and continued going into 2018 so very interesting see if there's anything else here we got to cover I go through all these things

economy it's showing some strength here it's usually a precursor for China growth they're stocking up the demand is growing Palladium weak remember when you couldn't get it everyone wanted Palladium a couple years ago I remember all that asked me anything questions  what about Palladium right here everyone wanted Palladium I think it was on EV excuse my language uh uranium so now everyone wants uranium that'll be the same story two years I'll say remember when everyone wanted uranium cotton I think that is a long-term story cotton so that speaks to inflation coffee wow coffee all the hedge funds are long as hell and commercials are shorting it that's a short coffee is a short might take a couple of years but uh coffee will be much lower uh two years from now than it is today and it might go a lot higher before it goes lower it's why we're not in the Commodities business we're in the equity's business but Coco same story OJ that's going to be one of the biggest shorts It's been putting in this top for a year uh probably collapses after February after their winter season and sugar okay some market indicators maybe it should be a $75,000 call not a $50,000 call uh all right let's see here put call ratio 10day moving average most of these the theme you're going to find as we scroll through these is they're all in the middle they're in no man's land they're not at extremes a couple of them are where you would want to do a dramatic change in your allocation because everything looked overbought or oversold uh Dow intermediate term breath momentum this is usually what you find closer to bottom so maybe we're closer to a bottom on that I don't know uh mlen summation again you know it does look like after this we covered last week the seasonal weakness in late November after in an election year after the initial surge in early November you get weakness into the end of the third week before that recovery into December so that's what we're dealing with right now that's why everything is kind of mid-range here pmo by SPX at 100 I would start to say okay but you know there's not a signal to wholesale buy or sell anything right now it's very selective and very nuanced okay let's go into the charts of the week margin debt below averages so again this is not extreme uh like you saw in 2021 scrolling down this is just a change in the FED we'll cover some of that in a minute\n\num cotton I think that is a long-term story cotton so that speaks to inflation coffee wow coffee all the hedge funds are long as hell and commercials are shorting it that&#39;s a

we&#39;ll cover some of that in a minute\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  a chart of the Japanese Yen looking like a bottom here from Kimble charting I thought that was interesting this chart I put up here this is the Fed funds rate and the reason is I wanted to show you what a midcycle easing looks like so most people think this has to go all the way back down to zero and then you get one of these gray lines which is called the recession and it&#39;s simply not the case uh what you can have like you had in the uh 60s was a midcycle cut that here was 200 basis points the rally lasted for another three or four years uh same thing here and the best analog in my view is this 1995 where you had cut from you know 625 down to 450 and that&#39;s it and the game kept going uh for another 5 years so I could certainly see a move down to like I&#39;ve said I was in the minority camp that our terminal rate would be four versus three and listening to some of the FED speakers I think that&#39;s becoming more and more realistic and that would look a lot like the midcycle cut and we&#39;ve got enough growth demand and demographics to drive the economy and the stock market with 4% rates so um here&#39;s the Japanese Yen here like I said I think this is going to resume strength uh\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is a chart of the Japanese Yen looking like a bottom here from Kimble charting I thought

is going to resume weakness and same thing here PMI diffusion encouraging signs for manufacturing we&#39;ve covered central banks on your side 74% of major central banks are in easing mode versus only 9% in July 2023 so this is what you see at the beginning of Cycles which um with business friendly growth policies coming to a theater near you this can extend for a very long time history suggests the market rise in the 3 months from the date of the election before leveling off which would imply January which would imply all the charts that we&#39;ve already gone through the Bank of America bull bear indicator is bullish but not at an extreme level so we&#39;re in this kind of mid a lot of people have gained huge home equity in the last 3 4 years which has a wealth effect biggest inflow into small caps since July of 2024 so people are getting The Message Tech outflows biggest outflow in Tech since 2002 China home sales Rises the first time this year so the stimulus is taking effect the market doesn&#39;t realize it yet maybe it takes until January to realize it maybe it takes them until tomorrow I don&#39;t know uh Goldman sentiment indicator all I can tell you is the reload on the uh options that we took off uh in early October which uh was absolutely incredible uh is in full effect so um uh we get a few more weekdays or weeks we we&#39;ll top up a hair but we&#39;ve been you know today was a busy day and um we&#39;re happy to be fully reloaded uh Goldman sentiment and by the way we&#39;ve not uh touched the stock the stock is the stock uh not sold share we have bought shares as we&#39;ve gotten new cash in but uh uh that&#39;s that Goldman sentiment indicators moving up uh election year seasonal composite November 11th through March 15th so this is what we&#39;re talking about you get that rally in the early November weakness into the 18th and then you start to get that recovery all the way into year end into the inauguration and then you get the grind sideways for like six months so we&#39;re probably getting close to what is this so probably by Thanksgiving week we start to uh start to recover a bit and uh and then rally into year end over the past couple of months average spending on holiday items has started to rise above 2023 levels so we&#39;re back over yeah this is going to be a good holiday season I I can just sense it uh which will be good for Etsy by the way which we talked about and um spending is starting to rise consumer sentiment has been rising since July holiday spending unwrapped consumer shows solid momentum as we head into the holidays Financial pit position appear sound uh foure election cycle so this is the election year you get rally then some weakness and then year end rally and then a little bit in the first half in the postelection year this is since 1900 this consolidation before you get the year end rally the midterm year is the weaker year um that would be 2026 yish consumer sentiment picking back up consumer expectations picking up inflation expectations going down China unveils $ 1.4 trillion debt swap program to ease local government pain holds fire on broader stimulus so they&#39;re just

before the inauguration and then went from $84 to $21 in just over a year so um that&#39;s that uh Paul Falcone longtime listener put this chart out which we&#39;ve covered uh on this podcast many times but it was nice to see and it actually confirms uh this right here these two red bars it had been coming in from the base which we covered earlier uh and then there was another monthly week bar so that would imply December is also weak if it&#39;s going to exactly match which it never does I think we could recover quicker but let&#39;s just say we don&#39;t one more month of weakness and then you get the final parabolic uh initial parabolic move that we&#39;ve all been waiting for and then once it hits 200 everyone will want it you know we&#39;ll be laying off some and then reloading

could always refinance lower uh consumer confidence and retail sales volumes going up Japanese 5-year government bond yield going up that currency is going to strengthen it&#39;s going to hurt Japanese equities and uh prime age population I mean it doesn&#39;t get any worse than the Japanese demographics this is an interesting chart has posted somewhere on Twitter a while back and it shows a pattern ideal buy for investor it&#39;s what they call stage one putting the base stage two when it breaks out um of quite a few of the stocks that we talked about are in this phase here where they&#39;re just starting to break out whether it&#39;s Baba whether it&#39;s biotech whether it&#39;s uh PayPal whether it&#39;s uh soon Etsy will look like this very soon uh and over and over and over so there are just tons of these and this is Phase 2 which is the beginning of the parabolic moves uh Cooper standard looks a lot like this actually uh and then uh probabilities of a Fed cut where coin flip yesterday went up to 80% this morning let me see what it was after he spoke probably went back to a coin flip again yep just about went back back down to 60% after he spoke we&#39;re in no rush 10cent beats estimates with 47% profit jump driven by video gaming China Cuts taxes on home purchases and fiscal policy support China Taps golden Bankers for feedback to lift Market confidence so they&#39;re not doing this stuff because they&#39;re not interested in stock markets they are they just you know overdid it and uh it always takes them two years to recover it this time&#39;s been no difference and now now now we&#39;re at the point with the election and everything else the question is does it take us six more weeks until we get our parabolic move or do we get it in six more days and the answer is it really doesn&#39;t matter at this point yard Denny sees uh S&P at 10,000 that&#39;s a big headline very smart marketing move other than the fact that if you do the math it&#39;s less than 10% a year return I think he&#39;s being very conservative uh kashari says economy strong but inflation not vanquished trust me you don&#39;t want inflation vanquished it&#39;s called deflation and uh very hard to get out of what you need to know about China&#39;s $1.4 trillion debt package we covered Roaring 20s on Wall Street could extend into the 2030s after likely Republican sweep Market veteran says uh agreed we&#39;ve been saying that for a while EU bendz needed Trump we could buy more American LNG uh good for com stock China and veils we covered that uh Mark with Donald Trump in power the dollar is likely to Rally but then weaken this is very important and I apologize for not covering it early because I have it written down in my notes the one chart that we forgot to cover how did it respond with King tariff King Dollar is here was the election dollar was a little weak into the election rallied like nobody&#39;s business from 95 to 103 into the inauguration and then what happened the dollar absolutely collapsed the first 9 months of the Trump presidency so let&#39;s take a look at what we have here dollar was weak into the election ripped higher after the election so it probably keeps going a little strong strength into the inauguration and then complete collapse back to New lows below even early March which would imply we get back back well below 99 once again after the inauguration what about bonds well Trump&#39;s gonna have no revenue from taxes and he&#39;s going to spend like a drunken sailor so therefore short bonds everyone&#39;s saying all the smart people are saying except for the fact that the same thing happened last time and you got weakness that continued into December and then you got a rally for the next year in bonds which is a compression of yields weakness into the election and then we will see a rally and a compression in yields uh over the next 12 months okay 10cent beat with a 47% profit jump so this is full hearty right here dollar will continue shortterm and then roll over City Group Frasier says it&#39;s game on for deals in the US we agree Disney explored wider field of candidates to succeed Iger uh Trump chooses Elon Musk and Vivic ramaswami to lead government efficiency effort so while everyone is concerned about runaway spending and big deficits these guys think they can cut two trillion even if they&#39;re half right and they cut one trillion uh that&#39;s going to be very very constructive for the US balance sheet for sure and deficits Trump is the most Pro Stock Market president that America&#39;s ever had that&#39;s from Jeremy seagull over at Wharton Disney&#39;s earnings Outlook Rises as streaming unit post gains so as we said um they&#39;ve got the new cruises coming out uh the movies actually crushed it Deadpool and Wolverine they added 4.4 million new core Disney plus subscribers in a quarter which was uh compared to estimates of 900,000 and don&#39;t forget they the prices they&#39;ve been raising like it&#39;s going out of style um blockbuster movies so the game continues that game is just getting started stocks end lower after Powell throws cold water on hopes for December interest rate cut uh coin flip but my guess would be he does a cut in December and then he waits for a while and if he gets to even if he waits beforehand I mean if we have a 450 or four terminal rate he can spread that out over 12 months so three more Cuts over 12 months is plenty and we&#39;re there Alibaba JD claim big win in singles day as sales consumer spending bounces back uh Advanced Auto Parts to exit Western us as it closes more than 700 locations we&#39;ll focus on the strongest markets in the eastern part of the country and this has to do with the supply chain this chart is blew my mind okay if you look at how spread out this is and basically they&#39;re getting out of California they&#39;re getting out of all the West Coast where uh you incentivized to steal products and not go to jail uh so they&#39;re just going to cut bait there and then you&#39;re going to see where they&#39;re going to keep all this incredible concentration on the east coast and just create a money minting cash flow machine with a healthy balance sheet and that&#39;s why you saw the stock up today and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing the beginning of the recovery never bet against Shane o Kelly and uh and we&#39;re just getting started there so very excited to see that turn around everything he said he was going to do out of the gate he&#39;s been doing step by step periodically and doing a good job at that in a uh weaker lower-end consumer environment that will is showing signs of recovery and I think we&#39;re going to see it in the holiday season inflation stays firm but not enough to derail December cut that was from the FED Whisperer before Powell spoke today so we&#39;ll see if that gets updated billionaire Tillman fertita is unhappy with wi Resorts performance uh we&#39;ve been looking at win a lot um we didn&#39;t get involved because it&#39;s another play on China we&#39;ve got enough exposure to China but I think that&#39;s

overall consumer sentiment continued to brighten Revenue was up 5% net income up 23% EPS up 29% company repurchased 8% of their shares announced uh uh to purchase five billion more worth of their

this has to do with the supply chain this chart is blew my mind okay if you look at how spread out this is and basically they&#39;re getting out of California they&#39;re getting out of all the West Coast where uh you incentivized to steal products and not go to jail uh so they&#39;re just going to cut bait there and then you&#39;re going to see where they&#39;re going to keep all this incredible concentration on the east coast and just create a money minting cash flow machine with a healthy balance sheet and that&#39;s why you saw the stock up today and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing the beginning of the recovery never bet against Shane o Kelly and uh and we&#39;re just getting started there so very excited to see that turn around everything he said he was going to do out of the gate

deleveraged and revenues keep going growing and that&#39;s exactly what happened in the third quarter and year-to date despite all the headwinds they grew revenues 4% uh and Year to in the quarter they grew at 3% and um increased earnings per share and they&#39;ve got their plan in place to re accelerate margins so you can see segment by segment how they grew infusion therapies plus 7% Advanced Surgery plus 7% car and connectivity up 7% so the injectables in the anesthesia was down uh that was the big loss 9% drug compounding up 17% so everything was basically up the whole revenues were up so the turnaround is in place the balance sheet is getting healthy this one just takes a little bit of patience but you know some go faster some go slower here&#39;s one that&#39;s gone faster this thing is unbelievable you couldn&#39;t give it away at $90 GEN now it&#39;s at 196 going to 200 uh with um residential product sales we&#39;re up 28% uh unbelievable commercial uh is still in its

a growth recovery whether it&#39;s 2009 or 2001 Etc that&#39;s what you see every single time um sentiment is improving but not yet euphoric that&#39;s what you see again out of these big troughs that&#39;s not a top that&#39;s that&#39;s headed towards a a rally uh and then managers are dramatically underweight materials and energy I definitely like some of the material Story the energy you know couple more months and uh I think if they&#39;re at excessive valuations I&#39;d be lightening up long gold is getting very crowded is the second most crowded trade and uh managers are the most overweight gold that they were in 2011 when was the last top was in place place and that lasted for uh nine more years to make a new high managers starting to get out of equities in Japan which we&#39;ve been talking about for months sentiment again it&#39;s elevated but it&#39;s not yet euphoric I think it&#39;s down to 63 today on the fear and greed and even the National Association of

for those of you who don&#39;t thank you for joining us we&#39;ll be back next week and hopefully much shorter next week but we&#39;ll see um will says can you help me understand when you say the US debt is going to be inflated away with inflation being three plus percent uh I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything to add there will it&#39;s exactly what I said it&#39;s the same Playbook that they did in 1948 to 1956 you can look at debt to GDP dropped from 120 to 53% look at inflation across that period it was consistently three to four to 5% per year and uh that was a good playback to bring the rates down the debt as a percentage GDP because if you grow nominal GDP debt stays fixed and uh and that&#39;s how that Ratio or nominal GDP grows much faster than the fixed debt uh on a ratio basis and that&#39;s how that ratio comes down so they won&#39;t run nominal growth super duper hot and that&#39;s you know if I&#39;ve never seen a set of policies an Administration that could be in place to run nominal GDP hotter than we&#39;ve ever said it would not Shock me to see years of GDP growth above five six 7 8% over the next four years I mean that sounds like crazy town I&#39;m telling you I think we&#39;re going to see at least one or two years like that which is going to be amazing so hey Tom thanks for all the information you provide every week any thoughts on backs backs we just covered Aaron L Huntington inals think that&#39;s hii okay let&#39;s take a look Cas is dropping a lot gross margins dropping return on capital is dropping not for me everything&#39;s going in the wrong direction for now I need to see some signs of recovery before I got interested in that Lars Lund care to look at gem genmab from Denmark uh let&#39;s take a look gross margins are moving down quite a bit I want to understand why that is that&#39;s a red flag what do they do uh Therapeutics yeah this I have no Edge on individual drugs and all that stuff I just buy a basket of xbi so I have I have no value ad there uh interview request Michael go selones yeah Specialty Chemicals I definitely want to get involved in more of these in the material space let&#39;s see what this one looks like yeah these are so cyclical that it&#39;s hard to analyze it as a good business it&#39;s more like a it&#39;s like a two-year trade um this one&#39;s really interesting I mean have to take a closer look but you know you&#39;re definitely catching a falling knife so you know it could go to 50 before it goes back to 170 but um as long as you&#39;re not on margin it&#39;s not a big deal this is a quality business though over time what is we what do they do here engineered [Music] polymers automotive and medical applications Industrial Products consumer electronics yeah I like this uh let&#39;s see what the balance sheet looks like but are they generative polymers that&#39;s the question are they large language polymers I don&#39;t know let&#39;s see uh all right so revenues are down a little bit share count is coming down so they&#39;re buying in stock cash flow I got make this a little smaller that&#39;s not what I wanted that&#39;s what I wanted yeah it&#39;s holding in there what&#39;s the balance sheet look like this is probably the risk $ 11 billion of debt with $ 800 million of cash uh got enough free cash flow you just got to check when does all of the debt mature sure and if you can get comfortable with solvency I think that this is probably okay and is in just in a cyclical trough and I think it&#39;s a reasonable find to start to do work on good job Mike J apt Ulta beauty uh we cover this one every week I think it&#39;s fine I know Buffett&#39;s sold some of his position but I think it&#39;s okay but I think there are better uses of money which I never why I never got excited about it John C Dollar Tree uh these are the type of businesses though the retailers are gonna get hit I on the tariffs but um Dollar Tree is already so far down and same with Dollar General I think I want to get involved with one of these it it it it it&#39;s just going to take a little while I mean it&#39;s had a heart attack but I think it&#39;s going to be okay I I

better value in the global market for my opinion where you have your downside totally protected with the cash net cash that they have on the balance sheet growth prospects everything else optionality outs all the all the good stuff is in place are you adding okay same question Tim D thoughts on solar we covered earlier looking haven&#39;t found but looking hard uh have you looked at Airbnb yeah and I think we covered that a few weeks ago I think it&#39;s okay I just think there are better uses is of money but I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s okay let me just see seven times sales 47 times earnings so if you&#39;re going to pay 10 times you know 47 times earnings and 10 time sales the key is going to be what&#39;s the growth rate so 10% next year and 16% in the year after to pay 47 times that you know for me it&#39;s not enough margin of safety so I&#39;m a pass that&#39;s a trade that&#39;s a trading vehicle thoughts on hbi yeah it&#39;s just a low quality business I said it would work as a trade it probably already is let&#39;s see yeah so this will push a little higher I it&#39;s not something that I want to get totally excited exced about because this thing just keeps running back down to nothing um not a good business Shia Rees Elliot announced a steak in Honeywell is it interesting for me yeah anything Elliott does is interesting for me honey honey well uh I&#39;d rather have Boeing I think there&#39;s way more upside for Boeing this has already had a huge run I I I like I like Boeing so he&#39;s going to break up do some of the parts basically he&#39;s going to just get a payoff to go away and that doesn&#39;t help me it helps him um what are your thoughts on Burkshire being in lots of cash uh the last time he was in this much cash the market rallied there thereafter relative to equity so there&#39;s no real tell in that I think the guy wants to go out like Seinfeld and the last thing he wants is I think he was preparing for a different outcome in the election and um and he thought he was going to be able to deploy a lot of that cash but what you don&#39;t want is to be 94 your stock goes down 50% after a lifetime of uh pristine reputation and you go out down 50% so I think this guy is more preserving Legacy than looking for upside at this point and um and you know he&#39;s probably not finding everything was I think you should probably take a hundred billion and buy Boeing but uh that&#39;s just me he should have done the same thing with GE Kyle Burns can you please take a look at Herbal Life uh no acmen publicly shortage seems undervalued at the current price I think it&#39;s a great business the problem is is that um and I have looked at this one a lot um until you see side effects being reported from the gp1s it&#39;s problematic um I think they&#39;ll continue they have the China recovery play here for sure their India market is is flying they&#39;ve got a great product but it is you know as much as it&#39;s a nutrition company it&#39;s always been marketed as a weight loss supplement company and uh in the developed Market there&#39;s just no real momentum I think the people that I think as the prices come down for these gp1s if they continue to prove efficacious for the long term and safe for the long term yes people will need protein shakes and herbal could be a beneficiary of this but it&#39;s a much different story um to sell if you if if it&#39;s not being used for the weight loss and if it&#39;s just being used for nutrition and protein so this would be the buy of all buys if and when you start to see\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nbut um Dollar Tree is already so far down and same with Dollar General I think I want to get involved with one of these it it it it&#39;s just going to take a little while I mean it&#39;s had a heart attack but I think it&#39;s going to be okay I I just think that your upside is limited so you basically have a double over three years and it could go 30% against you before you get the double from these levels uh is what what it comes down to they&#39;ll close unprofitable stores it&#39;ll be the same thing they all overexpanded um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like the Advanced Auto story with less upside that&#39;s the way I would put it so for me it would be basically the same trade and I don&#39;t overlap then you&#39;re just running you know an index fund so you got to pick your bets I think Dollar Tree is probably a little higher quality than Dollar General um still generating cash I think you&#39;re Pro I think you&#39;re probably okay with this one but you got to do the work on it now John so uh but definit uh hard yellow light to start the work are you adding to Alibaba before earnings I would never add or subtract before earnings I I don&#39;t own for an earnings call I own because I have enough margin of safety at the price I&#39;m paying for the business and I sell it when I&#39;m getting quoted in the market for far more then I believe the intrinsic value of the business is worth uh and we are nowhere near that point so we reloaded all the options that we took profits on in early October when it was at $117 and um we&#39;ll probably potentially have a chance to H top up a few more in coming weeks but um I think the window&#39;s going to close uh pretty quickly so um am I comfortable with the position I have I couldn&#39;t be more comfortable I just you know uh every new new money that came in gets an allocation of Baba even at these levels it&#39;s uh it&#39;s it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s one of price is what you pay value is what you going to get there is  no uh better value in the global market for my opinion where you have your downside totally protected with the cash net cash that they have on the balance sheet growth prospects everything else optionality outs all the all the good stuff is in place are you adding okay same question Tim D thoughts on solar we covered earlier looking haven&#39;t found but looking hard uh have you looked at Airbnb yeah and I think we covered that a few weeks ago I think it&#39;s okay I just think there are better uses is of money but I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s okay let me just see seven times sales 47 times earnings so if you&#39;re going to pay 10 times you know 47 times earnings and 10 time sales the key is going to be what&#39;s the growth rate so 10% next year and 16% in the year after to pay 47 times that you know for me it&#39;s not enough margin of safety so I&#39;m a pass that&#39;s a trade that&#39;s a trading vehicle thoughts on hbi yeah it&#39;s just a low quality business I said it would work as a trade it probably already is let&#39;s see yeah so this will push a little higher I it&#39;s not something that I want to get totally excited exced about because this thing just keeps running back down to nothing um not a good business Shia Rees Elliot announced a steak in Honeywell is it interesting for me yeah anything Elliott does is interesting for me honey honey well uh I&#39;d rather have Boeing I think there&#39;s way more upside for Boeing this has already had a huge run I I I like I like Boeing so he&#39;s going to break up do some of the parts basically he&#39;s going to just get a payoff to go away and that doesn&#39;t help me it helps him um what are your thoughts on Burkshire being in lots of cash uh the last time he was in this much cash the market rallied there thereafter relative to equity so there&#39;s no real tell in that I think the guy wants to go out like Seinfeld and the last thing he wants is I think he was preparing for a different outcome in the election and um and he thought he was going to be able to deploy a lot of that cash but what you don&#39;t want is to be 94 your stock goes down 50% after a lifetime of uh pristine reputation and you go out down 50% so I think this guy is more preserving Legacy than looking for upside at this point and um and you know he&#39;s probably not finding everything was I think you should probably take a hundred billion and buy Boeing but uh that&#39;s just me he should have done the same thing with GE Kyle Burns can you please take a look at Herbal Life uh no acmen publicly shortage seems undervalued at the current price I think it&#39;s a great business the problem is is that um and I have

from $555 down to $6 then I would say uh take a hard pass because they don't respect Equity but um yeah I mean I I think you got something there you just have to do a lot of work on it because these

earnings from 275 over 300 but if you add in the multiplier effect and the compounding effect over a couple of years you start looking at $350 of earnings whereas maybe without it we would have been looking at like 310 to 320 a couple years out um which makes us a little bit fully valued here but when you take into effect the tax benefit and the multiplier effect and a couple years out uh makes

people are excited about it the policy is uh proc crypto from the from this new Administration and uh it's telling us that people believe in Risk people believe in the future and it's also consistent

corporate tax rate goes from 21% to % which means the tax expense is reduced by 29% earnings power of the S&P 500 could go from 275 to 354 what does that mean in English Ste it means the multiple of the market comes down from 21.8 times down to 16.9 times which would imply the market is not expensive at 21.8 it could be reasonable at 16.9 if they push that through but we got to have a clean sweep the house has to stay Republican that's right and that at the moment has not been confirmed that has not been confirmed but you had voter out overnight you had a couple other news organizations saying

investing acquiring more than you are paying for you must value the business in order to Value the stock and that&#39;s why these short-term fluctuations never bothers bother us you know people always like you have ice in your veins well no I don&#39;t have ice in my veins I I have a consistent repeatable framework that I apply across a basket of 10 12 companies and some take off immediately overnight and we re profits faster than we expected and some take a little bit longer but they all work over time when the framework is correct the only thing that can change is if the fundamentals dramatically change then we change our mind but um more often than not it&#39;s it&#39;s a Time Arbitrage game where we sit on our butts with low leverage and when they reach our predetermined uh level of fair and fully valued we just start to lay off as as uh uh everyone else gets excited and uh they want the stock at the highs and we help them out so I put together this list of quote unquote Trump trades because I want to show you what is the setup what was the setup going into the election in November of 2016 right before Trump sweeped and then what happened thereafter here and what you can see here this first one is small caps and you can see it was weakening into the election and then as soon as he was elected it shot straight up a little consolidation straight up and then it Consolidated those gains for about a half a year very similar to what we talked about with Stu where you get a rally into the inauguration and then you get some sideways uh consolidation and chop uh the first half even down the first half before a year and rally and I just want to show you here uh yeah this goes all the way to December so you see this sideways chop into the straight up into the inauguration chop grind even negative into uh late summer and then a year-end rally once again off those lows so we&#39;re going to go through asset class by asset class even the arc uh this is the Kathy Woods um ETF that that had been slaughtered in recent years is starting to show signs of life and as you can see it was Tech based so right after the election it got a little bit of pop and then it rolled over and it was kind of just grinding here until the inauguration and believe it or not after the inauguration when small caps slowed down this speculative Tech picked up and never looked back and was almost a double after the inauguration so if you got most of the games into the inauguration this was where you picked up the mantle and got the biggest gains after the inauguration which is going to be consistent you&#39;ll see with biotech and some of the other things that that people think oh that won&#39;t work in the Trump Administration it&#39;s only Industrials and you know energy which is the exact wrong thing and we&#39;re going to show you why let&#39;s see what um so Arc had been weak into the election let&#39;s see what it did this year so it was kind of grinding sideways to weak into the election and had this huge pop now it probably grinds back before afterwards it&#39;s not necessarily going to um repeat exactly because there were some conditions that were uh um different but we want to keep an you know keep an open mind here because the narratives that are circulating when you look at the empirical data are proving to be completely inaccurate uh here was baba baba was weakening had peaked in October was weakening into the election and weakened for another two months all the way into the inauguration after he was inaugurated in January of 2017 Baba went from $84 to $187 in 11 months so um that&#39;s really interesting because everyone is convinced and by the way he ran on tariffs and protectionism in 2016 and the Border by the way uh same Playbook same hat uh one extra number and this is what happens so on this basis it would not be unreasonable for Baba to continue to be weak until the inauguration although I think conditions are slightly different in that it also wouldn&#39;t be surprising for earnings to be positive something happen with uh with Chinese stimulus or something or other that maybe we take off a little bit beforehand but either way it makes no real difference if it&#39;s a month more two months more uh or not the key is that the Tariff King Chinese stocks did better than ever after his inauguration now let&#39;s take a look at what happened this year now you could start to see why this is going to be such a long incredible amazing call uh I should probably be charging $50,000 for this call and you&#39;ll see why by the end of this the the the podcast um but um we&#39;re not going to do that so uh we want to deliver value and um and go from there so interestingly enough what happened with Baba is it peaked again in October look what happened here early October in 2016 early October in um 202 24 week into the election week into the election and then was weak again for the other two months into January 1st was weak again into the other two months so we could go lower before we go higher that&#39;s not uh impossible at all but um we&#39;ll see we&#39;ve got earnings tomorrow which is going to be a big deal the name of the game is zooming out and looking at the big picture after you had that initial weakness and uncertainty from the Tariff King uh the thing absolutely took off and ripped higher so if we went to 85 so",

thing absolutely took off and ripped higher so if we went to 85 so here is  interesting it went from it peaked at 107 in 2016 and dropped to 84 before the inauguration here we&#39;re peing at 117 which would imply uh you know so it&#39;s 10 points higher so maybe we get 10 points higher than the low we would we would bottom around 90 or so versus 85 like the last time so we&#39;re probably close to it maybe we go down to 85 like we did the last time before going to 185 but but um all that is effectively nois the key is is to zoom out see the big picture and it&#39;s going to recover and um and that&#39;s where it&#39;s at then what else 50 which is the IBD 50 which is uh momo stocks growth stocks were weak into the election and then they took off so let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on this year uh a little bit weak into the election took off so maybe we&#39;ll get see some similar stuff like that uh iwm is also small caps shot like a rocket Consolidated into the inauguration and then kind of grinded sideways for a half a year before a yearend rally uh we covered that kweb same as Baba continued to weaken and then after the inauguration took off went from 30 to effectively 54 in less than a year uh equal weight week into the election same story uh semiconductors fell into the election grinded for a few weeks and then continued the uptrend let&#39;s see what semiconductors are doing here yeah same thing kind of grinding it very interesting setups here uh SNP was weak into the election shot up Consolidated those gains and then just kind of grinded higher the whole next year so let&#39;s see what Spy is doing little bit weak to the election shot up and should continue to persist which which be kind of interesting um solar very weak into the election it&#39;s almost as if they knew the election outcome same right now very very weak into the election and then what happened bumped around for two months and then recovered so there might be some opportunity in solar we&#39;ve been talking about the last week or so that we&#39;d be keeping our eyes open and and we will biotech very weak into the election in 2016 ripped higher weak into the inauguration looks a lot like Baba and then uh from 58 to 88 in less than a year so let&#39;s see what this is doing little weakness into the election shot higher grinded sideways so that we could see some weakness um before strength resumes\n\noil servicers xes had a little weakness into the election straight up like a rocket ship after Trump got elected in 2016 into the inauguration as soon as he was inaugurated complete crash 50% crash in oil servicers from the inauguration till August of that year let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on right now this might be a great short for next year uh um oil servicers so it shot up after the election let&#39;s see if it keeps grinding higher into the inauguration and we may put that on as a short in January uh that could be an incredible short let&#39;s put that down again these things are not going to repeat but they are going to rhyme here&#39;s in uh materials was weak and then just never looked back let&#39;s take a look at materials little week let that could be an interesting long we have a albamar for that already which is doing well communication Services a little weak and grind and then straight up little bit okay we&#39;ll see energy same story shot up after the election after the inauguration was a complete short into August let&#39;s see what happened is happening here little weakness into election shot up so this would be another short after the inauguration as he announces I&#39;m sure drilling on every federal land under the sun they will uh move all the moose and the elk and the Deer uh into retirement homes and drill baby drill XLF uh again was kind of like sh sideways into the election shot straight up and then grinded sideways for a half a year and let&#39;s see here shot up probably grind sideways for a half a year uh regionals I think have a little further to go let me just see here KR yeah same story shot up and then grinded sideways for a year all right Industrials shot up after the election kind of kept going see what&#39;s going on here shot off after the election we&#39;ll see if it keeps going we had a lot of strength okay Tech kind of bumped around for a couple of months and then just continued to persist higher let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening here shot up a little bit after the election we&#39;ll see uh if it continues to persist higher I think there&#39;s some opportunity here Staples was not only week into the election went even lower so if we get a lot of tax loss selling in December and we find a bottom there there&#39;s probably some opportunity in Staples let&#39;s just take a look here so yeah look at this Staples was going weak into the election got weaker and then bottomed in December before recovering completely so probably some further weakness and then there there might be some opportunity there utilities were absolutely week into the election grinding around and then started to work higher let&#39;s see what utilities have been doing week into the election same type of story so there&#39;ll probably be an opportunity in a few weeks to take a look at some of those healthc care super weak into the election Spike weakness again into December and then totally took off I think they&#39;re going to be great opportunities in healthc care weakness into the election we&#39;ll probably see a little more weakness and then there&#39;ll be opportunities so these are places to look um xlu xlk XL V consumer discretionary week into the election never look back and that&#39;s one that we&#39;ve been uh talking about since the summer time to get loaded up on uh discretionary and that&#39;s what happened let&#39;s talk about what else here uh xop I think we covered these are basically oh no these are exploration and production stocks down into the election straight up after and then down into election straight up after this probably rips higher and then that becomes a short after the inauguration or shortly before it uh retail this could get this will probably get hit by the tariffs uh this is going to be a short um week into the election huge rip into December and then straight down from there after the inauguration let&#39;s take a look here yeah shot up after the election that could be an interesting short um and that&#39;s it so there you go there&#39;s your Trump trade 2026 2024 uh now wanted to zoom out on a number of names we&#39;ve discussed on the podcast some of which we own for clients and personally uh across accounts so this is Advanced Auto Parts uh we&#39;re going to cover a little bit about the earnings basically they shut all their unprofitable stuff in the west that they had no economies to scale uh and uh and now they&#39;re going to have an absolute cash machine with this with a clean balance sheet and that&#39;s why the market was rallying uh uh today uh off of earnings so that&#39;s good to see but in the scheme of things this is what their normal bottoming process looks like these fake outs and then it slowly grinds higher and No One Believes it disbelief and then it recovers and then same will happen with Advanced Auto Parts albam Maro continuing to climb higher from those lows when we were talking about it on the podcast Asos it&#39;s been dead money for a year it&#39;s a tiny position and um we&#39;ll keep an eye on it but no reason to add on that yet uh and no real reason to get out either um Boeing uh is trying to really flush out the last few weekends in the stock this makes absolutely zero sense anywhere I have money I&#39;m buying more um personally across client accounts this you know this is one of these that could go to a 100 before it goes back to 400 but uh I wouldn&#39;t bet on that I think this is actually you know what let&#39;s take a look and see what it did under the Trump 2016 I I think we&#39;re going to be referring back to these charts a lot let&#39;s see uh today now that we have a a sweep so it was sideways kind of grinding uh into the election and then it&#39;s and then it didn&#39;t even look back from 100 to 300 in a in a year after Trump got elected what&#39;s interesting about that is it&#39;s been so it basically had come off of this super low in early 2016 and then it you know didn&#39;t go back and test it but it was just grinding sideways doing nothing and then somehow after the election it took off um we had that low in late TW uh 22 grinding sideways didn&#39;t retest the lows uh we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see but uh uh you know what if you look at when Trump was elected right here and then inaugurated the thing just went straight up for the first two years Trump was in office so there&#39;s something to be said for that Bo Baba okay they&#39;ve got earnings tomorrow shot up fake out we covered you know what it did oh here by the way this is kind of interesting this is when Trump was inaugurated right here so it was in a shoot up off of lows pullback this is really rhyming like nobody&#39;s business so it probably goes you know in that theme it could go lower all the way into January barely lower into the mid 80s and then it went straight up to 207 the first two years that the Tariff King was in power so um I don&#39;t like it I don&#39;t like six more weeks of pain I do like uh six months of massive gain so uh delayed gratification there uh we&#39;ll see let&#39;s see what happens with earnings tomorrow uh Baxter same nonsense as the 2014 to 2016 lows that we&#39;ve had from the 2023 to 2025 lows it just keeps doing these grinds and fake outs until it\n\nquestions  for technology then uh on a financial basis

straight up and kept going interesting okay good middle Cooper standard action uh Comstock resources keeps pushing higher uh diio interestingly enough Emerging Market stock look at this super weak into the election and then took off and never looked back these emerging market stocks unbelievable same type of setup this downward grind low at the election and then took off off the bottom I like that diio Disney shot the lights out today as we had said the parks and experiences were worth 85 alone we thought the streaming TV and movie was worth at least 100 over the next few years today they proved it out 4 million new subscribers we'll talk into some of those details shock stock shot up to 109 and if you remember me pitching it in the 70s and 80s and 90s no one you couldn't give it away uh still people are skeptical so um you know that'll be what it'll be but this thing is just getting going so pretty excited about that uh that's just a Regional Bank ETF s day louder here's another

never looked back from 10 bucks to 70 bucks um we&#39;ll talk a little bit about that one uh here is  gener had great earnings uh this thing is really just starting to rip um you know you might get a little bit more bottoming for the next couple of years but um you know with a two handle this starts to get really interesting with more than a double plus uh we&#39;ll be taking a look at that goose is just doing what it&#39;s doing uh interestingly enough Goose was crappy in early 2017 and then went parabolic uh into 2018 so goose is going to be just fine that&#39;s a China recovery play going to trade like Baba gxo huge rip on the um buyout rumors it&#39;s been grinding sideways we&#39;ll see what happens with that [Music] um hormell uh Intel all the way up to 26 now it&#39;s at 25 bucks down up from 18 so this one this recovery is just getting started interestingly enough saw something similar in uh 200 16 into 2018 JD same fake out pullback that we saw in 2016 after the inauguration and then straight up from there uh Regional Banks this thing is this is this is getting a little bit extended I think uh maybe after the inauguration if it&#39;s in the mid 70s I might trim some profits here because if you remember we bought this way back in the um Silicon Valley National Bank crisis in 2023 so this has been more than a double uh and we want to start to not be pigs at the trough uh PayPal interesting PayPal was putting in a base in 2016 and 2017 a couple months after the inauguration parabolic move let&#39;s see ladies and gentlemen I mean this thing uh again no one would buy it in the 50s and 60s when we were pounding the table uh you know some of the host would look at me like I had three heads now it&#39;s in the 80s so uh definitely going to 100 in the near term and then I think probably a lot more over the next couple of years Alex Chris is doing an incredible job qxo just waiting for a deal announcement at any point uh probably take longer than everyone expects that&#39;s usually the way it works Stanley Black and&amp; Decker same type of basing choppy volatility like you saw in 2016 before\n\n breaking to the upside and making new high uh small caps here little chop into the election uh straight up into the inauguration and then grinds higher for another couple years so we like small caps continued and then interestingly enough VF Corp was building a base back then as well and did exceptionally well as an Emerging Market play after the Trump inauguration uh into 2018 more than a double in uh in just over over a year so uh so we like that and biotech look at this ladies and gentlemen it had put it in its bottom and then little weakness into the election and then after the inauguration straight up broke out to new highs so biotech is going to continue to run this is all about patience ladies and gentlemen now uh I want to go so look I&#39;m telling you right now next week&#39;s podcast is going to be like 12 minutes because uh we are covering four weeks worth of off in one week why because we just had a massive sea change in our political landscape and I want to get you guys thinking correctly because most people out there are going to be dramatically faked out with recency bias thinking that the first moves are going to persist and you as you can see the first moves in some cases are monstrous fake outs\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  the US dollar and um as you can see it topped back in October 2022 collaps has been in the sideways range I think we&#39;re at the top of the range and we&#39;re going to start to continue to re weaken I want to go through a bunch of Commodities because we haven&#39;t done it in a while and I want to get everyone on board so Bitcoin Animal Spirits through the roof um ethereum rip the thing about ethereum is it actually has some practical use application I have a good friend who um is one of the major people involved in that in size and when he explains it to you you&#39;re like okay that makes sense but the uh the other stuff uh not so sure uh here we go with commercials getting long hedge funds getting short the Euro so maybe a little bit more weakness before we see strength as a matter of fact we saw weakness right into the inauguration in 2017 and then what happened the Euro ripped higher for the next year Australian dollar same story similar story rather British pound already had kind of a move Canadian dollar look at commercials buying hand over fist like nobody&#39;s business uh hang in there Canadians you&#39;re going to get some strength uh Japanese Yen commercials have been buying ahead saw little strength I think that&#39;s going to resume let&#39;s look here we got Swiss frank no one really cares all right what else Mexican peso New Zealand dollar similar to the Australian dollar Brazilian real Flatline South African ran Flatline Bitcoin we covered all right let&#39;s get to the good stuff crude oil commercials have been buying while hedge funds have been shorting uh I think we&#39;re going to see some strength in oil in the short term uh what else we got here gasoline commercials have been buyers while hedge funds have been shorting you always want to bet with the commercials same with natural gas they&#39;ve been aggressively buying okay bonds baby bonds let&#39;s look at this 10 year where&#39;s the 10 year here we go commercial okay hedge funds are the most short that they&#39;ve been since 2018 even shorter than when we called the low in October 2023 and you got to rip your face off r so um the last time they were this short was 2018 and what happened you got the biggest rally in bonds of all time compression of yields uh I think you are going to see a rally in bonds and a compression of yields in coming months so this is a short-term counter move head funds are shorting in the hole and that they there&#39;s a guaranteed ripy face off coming to everyone shorting B bonds right now uh and by the way we&#39;ve been buying some T TLT um okay let&#39;s see what else we got here corn looking closer to a bottom than a top same with soybeans they can take a while to build a base so I don&#39;t want to draw any you know we&#39;re not trading any of these I just want to get it give you a sense of how things are looking in terms of inflation uh a lot of these things are are just coming in quite a bit spring wheat oats Ruff rice canola it&#39;s the SNP that&#39;s the [Music] NASDAQ Russell small caps is just breaking out to all-time highs just like we saw after the election in 2017 and then climbed higher after this breakout so that was the election November 16 then some follow through then it broke out and continued going into 2018 so very interesting see if there&#39;s anything else here we got to cover I go through all these things every week live cattle looks like more like a short than a long um feeder cattle same thing that&#39;s good steak prices come down I like to eat steak uh all right by the way if you ever get up to Ridgefield Connecticut there&#39;s this place called hoodoo Brown get the beef rib it&#39;s the greatest piece of meat you will ever eat in your life um absolutely incredible and yeah interesting all right uh she gold hedge funds are tripping over themselves to buy more commercials are shorting at the top uh I&#39;d take the side of commercials but it could it could persist for many months before it collapses um copper Dr copper shows signs of the economy it&#39;s showing some strength here it&#39;s usually a precursor for China growth they&#39;re stocking up the demand is growing Palladium weak remember when you couldn&#39;t get it everyone wanted Palladium a couple years ago I remember all that asked me anything\n\num cotton I think that is a long-term story cotton so that speaks to inflation coffee wow coffee all the hedge funds are long as hell and commercials are shorting it that&#39;s a short coffee is a short might take a couple of years but uh coffee will be much lower uh two years from now than it is today and it might go a lot higher before it goes lower it&#39;s why we&#39;re not in the Commodities business we&#39;re in the equity&#39;s business but Coco same story OJ that&#39;s going to be one of the biggest shorts It&#39;s been putting in this top for a year uh probably collapses after February after their winter season and sugar okay some market indicators maybe it should be a $75,000 call not a $50,000 call uh all right let&#39;s see here put call ratio 10day moving average most of these the theme you&#39;re going to find as we scroll through these is they&#39;re all in the middle they&#39;re in no man&#39;s land they&#39;re not at extremes a couple of them are where you would want to do a dramatic change in your allocation because everything looked overbought or oversold uh Dow intermediate term breath momentum this is usually what you find closer to bottom so maybe we&#39;re closer to a bottom on that I don&#39;t know uh mlen summation again you know it does look like after this we covered last week the seasonal weakness in late November after in an election year after the initial surge in early November you get weakness into the end of the third week before that recovery into December so that&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with right now that&#39;s why everything is kind of mid-range here pmo by SPX at 100 I would start to say okay but you know there&#39;s not a signal to wholesale buy or sell anything right now it&#39;s very selective and very nuanced okay let&#39;s go into the charts of the week margin debt below averages so again this is not extreme uh like you saw in 2021 scrolling down this is just a change in the FED we&#39;ll cover some of that in a minute\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  a chart of the Japanese Yen looking like a bottom here from Kimble charting I thought that was interesting this chart I put up here this is the Fed funds rate and the reason is I wanted to show you what a midcycle easing looks like so most people think this has to go all the way back down to zero and then you get one of these gray lines which is called the recession and it&#39;s simply not the case uh what you can have like you had in the uh 60s was a midcycle cut that here was 200 basis points the rally lasted for another three or four years uh same thing here and the best analog in my view is this 1995 where you had cut from you know 625 down to 450 and that&#39;s it and the game kept going uh for another 5 years so I could certainly see a move down to like I&#39;ve said I was in the minority camp that our terminal rate would be four versus three and listening to some of the FED speakers I think that&#39;s becoming more and more realistic and that would look a lot like the midcycle cut and we&#39;ve got enough growth demand and demographics to drive the economy and the stock market with 4% rates so um here&#39;s the Japanese Yen here like I said I think this is going to resume strength uh\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is a chart of the Japanese Yen looking like a bottom here from Kimble charting I thought that

the stock market with 4% rates so um here&#39;s the Japanese Yen here like I said I think this is going to resume strength uh\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is a the channel for the dollar I think this is going to resume weakness and same thing here PMI diffusion encouraging signs for manufacturing we&#39;ve covered central banks on your side 74% of major central banks are in easing mode versus only 9% in July 2023 so this is what you see at the beginning of Cycles which um with business friendly growth policies coming to a theater near you this can extend for a very long time history suggests the market rise in the 3 months from the date of the election before leveling off which would imply January which would imply all the charts that we&#39;ve already gone through the Bank of America bull bear indicator is bullish but not at an extreme level so we&#39;re in this kind of mid a lot of people have gained huge home equity in the last 3 4 years which has a wealth effect biggest inflow into small caps since July of 2024 so people are getting The Message Tech outflows biggest outflow in Tech since 2002 China home sales Rises the first time this year so the stimulus is taking effect the market doesn&#39;t realize it yet maybe it takes until January to realize it maybe it takes them until tomorrow I don&#39;t know uh Goldman sentiment indicator all I can tell you is the reload on the uh options that we took off uh in early October which uh was absolutely incredible uh is in full effect so um uh we get a few more weekdays or weeks we we&#39;ll top up a hair but we&#39;ve been you know today was a busy day and um we&#39;re happy to be fully reloaded uh Goldman sentiment and by the way we&#39;ve not uh touched the stock the stock is the stock uh not sold share we have bought shares as we&#39;ve gotten new cash in but uh uh that&#39;s that Goldman sentiment indicators moving up uh election year seasonal composite November 11th through March 15th so this is what we&#39;re talking about you get that rally in the early November weakness into the 18th and then you start to get that recovery all the way into year end into the inauguration and then you get the grind sideways for like six months so we&#39;re probably getting close to what is this so probably by Thanksgiving week we start to uh start to recover a bit and uh and then rally into year end over the past couple of months average spending on holiday items has started to rise above 2023 levels so we&#39;re back over yeah this is going to be a good holiday season I I can just sense it uh which will be good for Etsy by the way which we talked about and um spending is starting to rise consumer sentiment has been rising since July holiday spending unwrapped consumer shows solid momentum as we head into the holidays Financial pit position appear sound uh foure election cycle so this is the election year you get rally then some weakness and then year end rally and then a little bit in the first half in the postelection year this is since 1900 this consolidation before you get the year end rally the midterm year is the weaker year um that would be 2026 yish consumer sentiment picking back up

    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\noil servicers xes had a little weakness into the election straight up like a rocket ship after Trump got elected in 2016 into the inauguration as soon as he was inaugurated complete crash 50% crash in oil servicers from the inauguration till August of that year let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on right now this might be a great short for next year uh um oil servicers so it shot up after the election let&#39;s see if it keeps grinding higher into the inauguration and we may put that on as a short in January uh that could be an incredible short let&#39;s put that down again these things are not going to repeat but they are going to rhyme here&#39;s in uh materials was weak and then just never looked back let&#39;s take a look at materials little week let that could be an interesting long we have a albamar for that already which is doing well communication Services a little weak and grind and then straight up little bit okay we&#39;ll see energy same story shot up after the election after the inauguration was a complete short into August let&#39;s see what happened is happening here little weakness into election shot up so this would be another short after the inauguration as he announces I&#39;m sure drilling on every federal land under the sun they will uh move all the moose and the elk and the Deer uh into retirement homes and drill baby drill XLF uh again was kind of like sh sideways into the election shot straight up and then grinded sideways for a half a year and let&#39;s see here shot up probably grind sideways for a half a year uh regionals I think have a little further to go let me just see here KR yeah same story shot up and then grinded sideways for a year all right Industrials shot up after the election kind of kept going see what&#39;s going on here shot off after the election we&#39;ll see if it keeps going we had a lot of strength okay Tech kind of bumped around for a couple of months and then just continued to persist higher let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening here shot up a little bit after the election we&#39;ll see uh if it continues to persist higher I think there&#39;s some opportunity here Staples was not only week into the election went even lower so if we get a lot of tax loss selling in December and we find a bottom there there&#39;s probably some opportunity in Staples let&#39;s just take a look here so yeah look at this Staples was going weak into the election got weaker and then bottomed in December before recovering completely so probably some further weakness and then there there might be some opportunity there utilities were absolutely week into the election grinding around and then started to work higher let&#39;s see what utilities have been doing week into the election same type of story so there&#39;ll probably be an opportunity in a few weeks to take a look at some of those healthc care super weak into the election Spike weakness again into December and then totally took off I think they&#39;re going to be great opportunities in healthc care weakness into the election we&#39;ll probably see a little more weakness and then there&#39;ll be opportunities so these are places to look um xlu xlk XL V consumer discretionary week into the election never look back and that&#39;s one that we&#39;ve been uh talking about since the summer time to get loaded up on uh discretionary and that&#39;s what happened let&#39;s talk about what else here uh xop I think we covered these are basically oh no these are exploration and production stocks down into the election straight up after and then down into election straight up after this probably rips higher and then that becomes a short after the inauguration or shortly before it uh retail this could get this will probably get hit by the tariffs uh this is going to be a short um week into the election huge rip into December and then straight down from there after the inauguration let&#39;s take a look here yeah shot up after the election that could be an interesting short um and that&#39;s it so there you go there&#39;s your Trump trade 2026 2024 uh now wanted to zoom out on a number of names we&#39;ve discussed on the podcast some of which we own for clients and personally uh across accounts so this is Advanced Auto Parts uh we&#39;re going to cover a little bit about the earnings basically they shut all their unprofitable stuff in the west that they had no economies to scale uh and uh and now they&#39;re going to have an absolute cash machine with this with a clean balance sheet and that&#39;s why the market was rallying uh uh today uh off of earnings so that&#39;s good to see but in the scheme of things this is what their normal bottoming process looks like these fake outs and then it slowly grinds higher and No One Believes it disbelief and then it recovers and then same will happen with Advanced Auto Parts albam Maro continuing to climb higher from those lows when we were talking about it on the podcast Asos it&#39;s been dead money for a year it&#39;s a tiny position and um we&#39;ll keep an eye on it but no reason to add on that yet uh and no real reason to get out either um Boeing uh is trying to really flush out the last few weekends in the stock this makes absolutely zero sense anywhere I have money I&#39;m buying more um personally across client accounts this you know this is one of these that could go to a 100 before it goes back to 400 but uh I wouldn&#39;t bet on that I think this is actually you know what let&#39;s take a look and see what it did under the Trump 2016 I I think we&#39;re going to be referring back to these charts a lot let&#39;s see uh today now that we have a a sweep so it was sideways kind of grinding uh into the election and then it&#39;s and then it didn&#39;t even look back from 100 to 300 in a in a year after Trump got elected what&#39;s interesting about that is it&#39;s been so it basically had come off of this super low in early 2016 and then it you know didn&#39;t go back and test it but it was just grinding sideways doing nothing and then somehow after the election it took off um we had that low in late TW uh 22 grinding sideways didn&#39;t retest the lows uh we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see but uh uh you know what if you look at when Trump was elected right here and then inaugurated the thing just went straight up for the first two years Trump was in office so there&#39;s something to be said for that Bo Baba okay they&#39;ve got earnings tomorrow shot up fake out we covered you know what it did oh here by the way this is kind of interesting this is when Trump was inaugurated right here so it was in a shoot up off of lows pullback this is really rhyming like nobody&#39;s business so it probably goes you know in that theme it could go lower all the way into January barely lower into the mid 80s and then it went straight up to 207 the first two years that the Tariff King was in power so um I don&#39;t like it I don&#39;t like six more weeks of pain I do like uh six months of massive gain so uh delayed gratification there uh we&#39;ll see let&#39;s see what happens with earnings tomorrow uh Baxter same nonsense as the 2014 to 2016 lows that we&#39;ve had from the 2023 to 2025 lows it just keeps doing these grinds and fake outs until it\n\n we&#39;ll focus on the strongest markets in the eastern part of the country and this has to do with the supply chain this chart is blew my mind okay if you look at how spread out this is and basically they&#39;re getting out of California they&#39;re getting out of all the West Coast where uh you incentivized to steal products and not go to jail uh so they&#39;re just going to cut bait there and then you&#39;re going to see where they&#39;re going to keep all this incredible concentration on the east coast and just create a money minting cash flow machine with a healthy balance sheet and that&#39;s why you saw the stock up today and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing the beginning of the recovery never bet against Shane o Kelly and uh and we&#39;re just getting started there so very excited to see that turn around everything he said he was going to do out of the gate he&#39;s been doing step by step periodically and doing a good job at that in a uh weaker lower-end consumer environment that will is showing signs of recovery and I think we&#39;re going to see it in the holiday season inflation stays firm but not enough to derail December cut that was from the FED Whisperer before Powell spoke today so we&#39;ll see if that gets updated billionaire Tillman fertita is unhappy with WI Resorts performance uh we&#39;ve been looking at WIN a lot um we didn&#39;t get involved because it&#39;s another play on China we&#39;ve got enough exposure to China but I think that&#39;s going to be a big win for those of you who don&#39;t have China exposure uh Donald Trump secures control of Congress as Republicans win House Majority uh JD reported in the earnings call he said as overall consumer sentiment continued to brighten Revenue was up 5% net income up 23% EPS up 29% company repurchased 8% of their shares announced uh uh to purchase five billion more worth of their shares so the game continues cement sentiment will follow this is Baxter&#39;s earnings couple of you asked the key### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES here is  that the restructuring is going according to plan balance sheet Del leverage from the uh sale of the biofarma business will go as planned and the name of the game with these turnarounds is that the balance sheet gets deleveraged and revenues keep going growing and that&#39;s exactly what happened in the third quarter and year-to date despite all the headwinds they grew revenues 4% uh and Year to in the quarter they grew at 3% and um increased earnings per share and they&#39;ve got their plan in place to re accelerate margins so you can see segment by segment how they grew infusion therapies plus 7% Advanced Surgery plus 7% car and connectivity up 7% so the injectables in the anesthesia was down uh that was the big loss 9% drug compounding up 17% so everything was basically up the whole revenues were up so the turnaround is in place the balance sheet is getting healthy this one just takes a little bit of patience but you know some go faster some go slower here&#39;s one that&#39;s gone faster this thing is unbelievable you couldn&#39;t give it away at $90 GEN now it&#39;s at 196 going to 200 uh with um residential product sales we&#39;re up 28% uh unbelievable commercial uh is still in its recovery stages and maybe we&#39;ll do this one or two of these uh next week and then ETSY we talked about a few weeks ago we got a $49 basis we

them in the UK like farfetch and everything else I think Asos will be left standing as as the competitors go out of business but uh Etsy was able to hang on to all of those clients and all that cash

FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  not only have they been able to keep the cash flow but they&#39;ve been able to bring down the share count from 127 million shares down to 110 that&#39;s going to go down to 100 revenues have continued to grow I mean who can pull this off in that environment and their return on Capital they continue to have very high digit double digit it&#39;s a capital light business double digit return on Capital in the 20s plus good seasonality and a plan and a differentiator while all these other retail are RAC to bottom selling crap at uh rock bottom prices um **Etsy** is unique in that it has creators 96 million users across of its platform which makes it the number three in the total e-commerce business and um huge International growth opportunity huge male growth opportunity and gifting opportunity so uh it&#39;s exciting and 9 million active sellers return on invested capitals are huge in this business and this is the type of business that you want so uh I think the they will continue to grow the international they&#39;ll continue to grow the men&#39;s they&#39;ll continue to re accelerate now they&#39;ve got the app they&#39;ve got the frequency of the buyer going everything is in place to deliver and this CEO is a a winner if you look at his bio you&#39;ll see all the things that he&#39;s accomplished before this uh and uh and you&#39;ll be impressed so just want to see if there cou couple key things here so just go through that everywhere I put stars and underlines you want to follow that Bank of America sentiment survey was out we put it out on Tuesday while you&#39;re at hedge fund tips click on terms this is opinion not advice so uh five key points number one it&#39;s a positive not a negative that managers think CPI will be higher next year than this year it is the same at each cycle trough that precedes a growth recovery whether it&#39;s 2009 or 2001 Etc that&#39;s what you see every single time um sentiment is improving but not yet euphoric that&#39;s what you see again out of these big troughs that&#39;s not a top that&#39;s that&#39;s headed towards a a rally uh and then managers are dramatically underweight materials and energy I definitely like some of the material Story the energy you know couple more months and uh I think if they&#39;re at excessive valuations I&#39;d be lightening up long gold is getting very crowded is the second most crowded trade and uh managers are the most overweight gold that they were in 2011 when was the last top was in place place and that lasted for uh nine more years to make a new high managers starting to get out of equities in Japan which we&#39;ve been talking about for months sentiment again it&#39;s elevated but it&#39;s not yet euphoric I think it&#39;s down to 63 today on the fear and greed and even the National Association of active investment managers is stuck in the 90s which is high but not extreme earnings oil and gas equipment Services down 20 20% uh in the last 60 days so again I&#39;d be fading this rally in the next couple of months Arc Innovation on the other hand is up top 30 weights in the last 60 days earnings estimates for 2025 up 6% this one&#39;s probably going to work she&#39;s probably going to start to be back on the cover of magazines so uh you know kudos for her hanging in there",
    "### MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n this thing is really just starting to rip um you know you might get a little bit more bottoming for the next couple of years but um you know with a two handle this starts to get really interesting with more than a double plus uh we&#39;ll be taking a look at that goose is just doing what it&#39;s doing uh interestingly enough Goose was crappy in early 2017 and then went parabolic uh into 2018 so goose is going to be just fine that&#39;s a China recovery play going to trade like Baba gxo huge rip on the um buyout rumors it&#39;s been grinding sideways we&#39;ll see what happens with that [Music] um hormell uh Intel all the way up to 26 now it&#39;s at 25 bucks down up from 18 so this one this recovery is just getting started interestingly enough saw something similar in uh 200 16 into 2018 JD same fake out pullback that we saw in 2016 after the inauguration and then straight up from there uh Regional Banks this thing is this is this is getting a little bit extended I think uh maybe after the inauguration if it&#39;s in the mid 70s I might trim some profits here because if you remember we bought this way back in the um Silicon Valley National Bank crisis in 2023 so this has been more than a double uh and we want to start to not be pigs at the trough uh PayPal interesting PayPal was putting in a base in 2016 and 2017 a couple months after the inauguration parabolic move let&#39;s see ladies and gentlemen I mean this thing uh again no one would buy it in the 50s and 60s when we were pounding the table uh you know some of the host would look at me like I had three heads now it&#39;s in the 80s so uh definitely going to 100 in the near term and then I think probably a lot more over the next couple of years Alex Chris is doing an incredible job qxo just waiting for a deal announcement at any point uh probably take longer than everyone expects that&#39;s usually the way it works Stanley Black and&amp; Decker same type of basing choppy volatility like you saw in 2016 before\nfinally  breaking to the upside and making new high uh small caps here little chop into the election uh straight up into the inauguration and then grinds higher for another couple years so we like small caps continued and then interestingly enough VF Corp was building a base back then as well and did exceptionally well as an Emerging Market play after the Trump inauguration uh into 2018 more than a double in uh in just over over a year so uh so we like that and biotech look at this ladies and gentlemen it had put it in its bottom and then little weakness into the election and then after the inauguration straight up broke out to new highs so biotech is going to continue to run this is all about patience ladies and gentlemen now uh I want to go so look I&#39;m telling you right now next week&#39;s podcast is going to be like 12 minutes because uh we are covering four weeks worth of off in one week why because we just had a massive sea change in our political landscape and I want to get you guys thinking correctly because most people out there are going to be dramatically faked out with recency bias thinking that the first moves are going to persist and you as you can see the first moves in some cases are monstrous fake outs\n\nhead funds are shorting in the hole and that they there's a guaranteed ripy face off coming to everyone shorting B bonds right now uh and by the way we've been buying some T TLT um okay let's see what else we got here corn looking closer to a bottom than a top same with soybeans they can take a while to build a base so I don't want to draw any you know we're not trading any of these I just want to get it give you a sense of how things are looking in terms of inflation uh a lot of these things are are just coming in quite a bit spring wheat oats Ruff rice canola it's the SNP that's the NASDAQ Russell small caps is just breaking out to all-time highs just like we saw after the election in 2017 and then climbed higher after this breakout so that was the election November 16 then some follow through then it broke out and continued going into 2018 so very interesting see if there's anything else here we got to cover I go through all these things every week live cattle looks like more like a short than a long um feeder cattle same thing that's good steak prices come down I like to eat steak uh all right gold hedge funds are tripping over themselves to buy more commercials are shorting at the top uh I'd take the side of commercials but it could it could persist for many months before it collapses um copper Dr copper shows signs of the economy it's showing some strength here it's usually a precursor for China growth they're stocking up the demand is growing Palladium weak remember when you couldn't get it everyone wanted Palladium a couple years ago I remember all that asked me anything questions  what about Palladium right here everyone wanted Palladium I think it was on EV excuse my language uh uranium so now everyone wants uranium that'll be the same story two years I'll say remember when everyone wanted uranium cotton I think that is a long-term story cotton so that speaks to inflation coffee wow coffee all the hedge funds are long as hell and commercials are shorting it that's a short coffee is a short might take a couple of years but uh coffee will be much lower uh two years from now than it is today and it might go a lot higher before it goes lower it's why we're not in the Commodities business we're in the equity's business but Coco same story OJ that's going to be one of the biggest shorts It's been putting in this top for a year uh probably collapses after February after their winter season and sugar okay some market indicators maybe it should be a $75,000 call not a $50,000 call uh all right let's see here put call ratio 10day moving average most of these the theme you're going to find as we scroll through these is they're all in the middle they're in no man's land they're not at extremes a couple of them are where you would want to do a dramatic change in your allocation because everything looked overbought or oversold uh Dow intermediate term breath momentum this is usually what you find closer to bottom so maybe we're closer to a bottom on that I don't know uh mlen summation again you know it does look like after this we covered last week the seasonal weakness in late November after in an election year after the initial surge in early November you get weakness into the end of the third week before that recovery into December so that's what we're dealing with right now that's why everything is kind of mid-range here pmo by SPX at 100 I would start to say okay but you know there's not a signal to

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is a chart of the Japanese Yen looking like a bottom here from Kimble charting I thought that was interesting this chart I put up here this is the Fed funds rate and the reason is I wanted to show you what a midcycle easing looks like so most people think this has to go all the way back down to zero and then you get one of these gray lines which is called the recession and it&#39;s simply not the case uh what you can have like you had in the uh 60s was a midcycle cut that here was 200 basis points the rally lasted for another three or four years uh same thing here and the best analog in my view is this 1995 where you had cut from you know 625 down to 450 and that&#39;s it and the game kept going uh for another 5 years so I could certainly see a move down to like I&#39;ve said I was in the minority camp that our terminal rate would be four versus three and listening to some of the FED speakers I think that&#39;s becoming more and more realistic and that would look a lot like the midcycle cut and we&#39;ve got enough growth demand and demographics to drive the economy and the stock market with 4% rates so um here&#39;s the Japanese Yen here like I said I think this is going to resume strength uh\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is a the channel for the dollar I think this is going to resume weakness and same thing here PMI diffusion encouraging signs for manufacturing we&#39;ve covered central banks on your side 74% of major central banks are in easing mode versus only 9% in July 2023 so this is what you see at the beginning of Cycles which um with business friendly growth policies coming to a theater near you this can extend for a very long time history suggests the market rise in the 3 months from the date of the election before leveling off which would imply January which would imply all the charts that we&#39;ve already gone through the Bank of America bull bear indicator is bullish but not at an extreme level so we&#39;re in this kind of mid a lot of people have gained huge home equity in the last 3 4 years which has a wealth effect biggest inflow into small caps since July of 2024 so people are getting The Message Tech outflows biggest outflow in Tech since 2002 China home sales Rises the first time this year so the stimulus is taking effect the market doesn&#39;t realize it yet maybe it takes until January to realize it maybe it takes them until tomorrow I don&#39;t know uh Goldman sentiment indicator all I can tell you is the reload on the uh options that we took off uh in early October which uh was absolutely incredible uh is in full effect so um uh we get a few more weekdays or weeks we we&#39;ll top up a hair but we&#39;ve been you know today was a busy day and um we&#39;re happy to be fully reloaded uh Goldman sentiment and by the way we&#39;ve not uh touched the stock the stock is the stock uh not sold share we have bought shares as we&#39;ve gotten new cash in but uh uh that&#39;s that Goldman sentiment indicators moving up uh election year seasonal composite November 11th through March 15th so this is what we&#39;re talking about you get that rally in the early November weakness into the 18th and then you start to get that recovery all the way into year end into the inauguration and then you get the grind sideways for like six months so we&#39;re probably getting close to what is this so probably by Thanksgiving week we start to uh start to recover a bit and uh and then rally into year end over the past couple of months average spending on holiday items has started to rise above 2023 levels so we&#39;re back over yeah this is going to be a good holiday season I I can just sense it uh which will be good for Etsy by the way which we talked about and um spending is starting to rise consumer sentiment has been rising since July holiday spending unwrapped consumer shows solid momentum as we head into the holidays Financial pit position appear sound uh foure election cycle so this is the election year you get rally then some weakness and then year end rally and then a little bit in the first half in the postelection year this is since 1900 this consolidation before you get the year end rally the midterm year is the weaker year um that would be 2026 yish consumer sentiment picking back up consumer expectations picking up inflation expectations going down China unveils $ 1.4 trillion debt swap program to ease local government pain holds fire on broader stimulus so they&#39;re just waiting to see what Trump&#39;s going to do but that is huge that&#39;s working in the background getting no credit yet but when it comes it comes all at once inflation expectations Rose in the November FMS flip positive we&#39;re

we&#39;ve covered and what made money over the next 5 years and a parabolic move small caps Emerging Markets uh Etc this chart I put out on Monday on Twitter I think it&#39;s gotten over 300 likes now and probably 50 retweets by now Trump elected as China Hawk and tariff King November 2016 you could see Baba was going down into it went down another six weeks before the inauguration and then went from $84 to $21 in just over a year so um that&#39;s that uh Paul Falcone longtime listener put this chart out which we&#39;ve covered uh on this podcast many times but it was nice to see and it actually confirms uh this right here these two red bars it had been coming in from the base which we covered earlier uh and then there was another monthly week bar so that would imply December is also weak if it&#39;s going to exactly match which it never does I think we could recover quicker but let&#39;s just say we don&#39;t one more month of weakness and then you get the final parabolic uh initial parabolic move that we&#39;ve all been waiting for and then once it hits 200 everyone will want it you know we&#39;ll be laying off some and then reloading down here for the final move so uh we covered the home sales picking up you don&#39;t never see those\n\nBank of America sentiment survey was out we put it out on Tuesday while you&#39;re at hedge fund tips click on terms this is opinion not advice so uh five key points number one it&#39;s a positive not a negative that managers think CPI will be higher next year than this year it is the same at each cycle trough that precedes a growth recovery whether it&#39;s 2009 or 2001 Etc that&#39;s what you see every single time um sentiment is improving but not yet euphoric that&#39;s what you see again out of these big troughs that&#39;s not a top that&#39;s that&#39;s headed towards a a rally uh and then managers are dramatically underweight materials and energy I definitely like some of the material Story the energy you know couple more months and uh I think if they&#39;re at excessive valuations I&#39;d be lightening up long gold is getting very crowded is the second most crowded trade and uh managers are the most overweight gold that they were in 2011 when was the last top was in place place and that lasted for uh nine more years to make a new high managers starting to get out of equities in Japan which we&#39;ve been talking about for months sentiment again it&#39;s elevated but it&#39;s not yet euphoric I think it&#39;s down to 63 today on the fear and greed and even the National Association of active investment managers is stuck in the 90s which is high but not extreme earnings oil and gas equipment Services down 20 20% uh in the last 60 days so again I&#39;d be fading this rally in the next couple of months Arc Innovation on the other hand is up top 30 weights in the last 60 days earnings estimates for 2025 up 6% this one&#39;s probably going to work she&#39;s probably going to

Twitter a while back and it shows a pattern ideal buy for investor it&#39;s what they call stage one putting the base stage two when it breaks out um of quite a few of the stocks that we talked about are in this phase here where they&#39;re just starting to break out whether it&#39;s Baba whether it&#39;s biotech whether it&#39;s uh PayPal whether it&#39;s uh soon Etsy will look like this very soon uh and over and over and over so there are just tons of these and this is Phase 2 which is the beginning of the parabolic moves uh Cooper standard looks a lot like this actually uh and then uh

to recover it this time&#39;s been no difference and now now now we&#39;re at the point with the election and everything else the question is does it take us six more weeks until we get our parabolic move or do we get it in six more days and the answer is it really doesn&#39;t matter at this point yard Denny sees uh S&P at 10,000 that&#39;s a big headline very smart marketing move other than the fact that if you do the math it&#39;s less than 10% a year return I think he&#39;s being very conservative uh kashari says economy strong but inflation not vanquished trust me you don&#39;t want

we covered that uh Mark with Donald Trump in power the dollar is likely to Rally but then weaken this is very important and I apologize for not covering it early because I have it written down in my notes the one chart that we forgot to cover how did it respond with King tariff King Dollar is here was the election dollar was a little weak into the election rallied like nobody&#39;s business from 95 to 103 into the inauguration and then what happened the dollar absolutely collapsed the first 9 months of the Trump presidency so let&#39;s take a look at what we have here dollar was weak into the election ripped higher after the election so it probably keeps going a little strong strength into the inauguration and then complete collapse back to New lows below even early March which would imply we get back back well below 99 once again after the inauguration what about bonds well Trump&#39;s gonna have no revenue from taxes and he&#39;s going to spend like a drunken sailor so therefore short bonds everyone&#39;s saying all the smart people are saying except for the fact that the same thing happened last time and you got weakness that continued into December and then you got a rally for the next year in bonds which is a compression of yields weakness into the election and then we will see a rally and a compression in yields uh over the next 12 months okay 10cent beat with a 47% profit jump so this is full hearty right here dollar will continue shortterm and then roll over City Group Frasier says it&#39;s game on for deals in the US we agree Disney explored wider field of candidates to succeed Iger uh Trump chooses Elon Musk and Vivic ramaswami to lead government efficiency effort so while everyone is concerned about runaway spending and big deficits these guys think they can cut two trillion even if they&#39;re half right and they cut one trillion uh that&#39;s going to be very very constructive for the US balance sheet for sure and deficits Trump is the most Pro

don&#39;t forget they the prices they&#39;ve been raising like it&#39;s going out of style um blockbuster movies so the game continues that game is just getting started stocks end lower after Powell throws cold water on hopes for December interest rate cut uh coin flip but my guess would be he does a cut in December and then he waits for a while and if he gets to even if he waits beforehand I mean if we have a 450 or four terminal rate he can spread that out over 12 months so three more Cuts over 12 months is plenty and we&#39;re there Alibaba JD claim big win in singles day as sales

I think it&#39;s going to be okay I I just think that your upside is limited so you basically have a double over three years and it could go 30% against you before you get the double from these levels

potentially have a chance to H top up a few more in coming weeks but um I think the window&#39;s going to close uh pretty quickly so um am I comfortable with the position I have I couldn&#39;t be more

me just see seven times sales 47 times earnings so if you&#39;re going to pay 10 times you know 47 times earnings and 10 time sales the key is going to be what&#39;s the growth rate so 10% next year and 16% in the year after to pay 47 times that you know for me it&#39;s not enough margin of safety so I&#39;m a pass that&#39;s a trade that&#39;s a trading vehicle thoughts on hbi yeah it&#39;s just

you're looking at there and I think that's that's where it is uh James thoughts on goose no no change we own it and uh that's a China recovery play like Baba and uh that'll be fine thank you for everything you do Z car giv the new CEO zc no not interested next Matt tumau ack been watching for a year thanks uh glad you're enjoying it Matt a r ooc archrock I think you missed it uh was more interesting at 150 than it is at 24 let's just see what's going on here all right so the cash flow recovered they stock priced it [Music] in what do they do energy infrastructure yeah I think this is one to short after the inauguration Energy Services Martin C greetings from Poland ncsm guarantee we're going to see an unbelievable increase of share count uh not huge from 1.7 million up to 2.5 million revenues I mean this is a tiny company I don't know I it might work uh what's the balance sheet look like $15 million of cash yeah I just want to understand you know the key is have they changed who's running it cuz this was a complete disaster so if they got new management in that has a track record of success then this thing's probably going to recover to 50 and Beyond if it's the same schmuck who ran it from $555 down to $6 then I would say uh take a hard pass because they don't respect Equity but um yeah I mean I I think you got something there you just have to do a lot of work on it because these smallish companies tend to have mediocre management uh Scher Blackman oil field equipment under Trump Administration yeah until the inauguration and then there shorts uh o e l l e r yeah if I had to be in one this probably looks okay also yeah not bad yeah pretty good find if you if you want exposure that one looks okay definitely worth doing the work on now uh thanks for that willhelm I think oh here we go software play Team Viewer SE this is from Lars yeah this definitely looks interesting LS I I think the number one thing you got to figure out is remote connectivity

      "completely inaccurate uh here was baba baba was weakening had peaked in October was weakening into the election and weakened for another two months all the way into the inauguration after he was inaugurated in January of 2017 Baba went from $84 to $187 in 11 months so um that&#39;s really interesting because everyone is convinced and by the way he ran on tariffs and protectionism in 2016 and the Border by the way uh same Playbook same hat uh one extra number and this is what happens so on this basis it would not be unreasonable for Baba to continue to be weak until the inauguration although I think conditions are slightly different in that it also wouldn&#39;t be surprising for earnings to be positive something happen with uh with Chinese stimulus or something or other that maybe we take off a little bit beforehand but either way it makes no real difference if it&#39;s a month more two months more uh or not the key is that the Tariff King Chinese stocks did better than ever after his inauguration now let&#39;s take a look at what happened this year now you could start to see why this is going to be such a long incredible amazing call uh I should probably be charging $50,000 for this call and you&#39;ll see why by the end of this the the podcast um but um we&#39;re not going to do that so uh we want to deliver value and um and go from there so interestingly enough what happened with Baba is it peaked again in October look what happened here early October in 2016 early October in um 202 24 week into the election week into the election and then was weak again for the other two months into January 1st was weak again into the other two months so we could go lower before we go higher that&#39;s not uh impossible at all but um we&#39;ll see we&#39;ve got earnings tomorrow which is going to be a big deal the name of the game is zooming out and looking at the big picture after you had that initial weakness and uncertainty from the Tariff King",
