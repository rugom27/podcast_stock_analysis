[0.68s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.439s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.879s] 265th videoast podcast for the week
[8.32s] ending November 14th
[11.28s] 2024 we have got so much to cover this
[14.599s] week it&#39;s incredible we&#39;re going to have
[16.64s] a great podcast video cast but as always
[20.24s] Family First here we go this is Mimi in
[24.4s] Chicago let&#39;s talk about their weekends
[27.599s] Annabelle and Mimi both had their first
[30.119s] respective solo travel Mimi went with
[33.04s] her coach and team to Chicago for the
[35.76s] Champions Cup in water polo and
[37.6s] Annabelle flew with her coach and team
[40.079s] to San Jose Mimi had some killer goals
[43.48s] and has grown so much since her time at
[46.36s] 68 Academy she loves seeing Chicago for
[48.76s] the first time and got some cool photos
[50.8s] we&#39;re going to go through Annabelle had
[52.64s] a demanding meat whereby in 36 hours she
[56.48s] took two flights swam 13 events came
[60.039s] home with 10 gold medals and three
[63.76s] silver set a new Southern Cal swimming
[67.2s] record in the medley relay broke a
[70.119s] minute in her 100 free and went 30
[73.92s] seconds in 50 back and 26 seconds as the
[77.24s] anchor in the freestyle relay so
[81.119s] exciting week for the girls that&#39;s Mimi
[83.799s] and Chicago that&#39;s actually a Trump
[85.36s] building in the background which is kind
[86.759s] of funny uh for that week uh um so there
[91.64s] there&#39;s a mini bull in Chicago because
[93.72s] why because the real bull is in New York
[96.96s] we do it bigger better than those
[99.0s] Commodities folks out there that&#39;s Mei
[101.159s] in front front of the bean in front of
[103.36s] the river there uh at some Park thing
[107.24s] okay there&#39;s Annabelle and her teammates
[109.68s] congratulations to Annabelle Hayes
[111.159s] Hayden Yen Grace Wang and hope Newman
[113.64s] for setting a new Southern California
[115.56s] swimming record in the 9 to 10 girls 200
[119.039s] yard medley congratulations to them and
[123.119s] then that&#39;s the team 908 team that&#39;s
[125.399s] Mimi in Chicago with her
[127.879s] teammates and this was the most exciting
[132.28s] uh trip I had to Dallas this
[135.28s] weekend uh played Fields Ranch up in
[139.76s] Frisco it&#39;s the new PGA course they&#39;re
[142.879s] doing some Majors there in the next year
[146.04s] uh there&#39;s going to be a major major
[148.519s] event in uh than next year but we can&#39;t
[151.84s] talk about that uh I took this picture
[155.28s] here because this practice putting green
[158.48s] is like a 100 yards it&#39;s the biggest
[161.04s] practice putting green in the country
[163.92s] and then while you&#39;re putting they have
[165.319s] this giant screen TV with sports games
[168.159s] all these cool restaurants and bars
[170.2s] around the putting green uh we the day
[173.64s] before we went to the Dallas Cowboys
[177.28s] game in their box was incredible this
[179.28s] was George and Laura Bush former
[181.72s] presidents doing the coin toss in Dallas
[184.92s] uh there&#39;s that TV again here&#39;s the
[186.76s] grass driving range hit some balls on
[188.92s] Sunday when I
[190.159s] landed uh there&#39;s one of the holes on
[193.04s] the west course which we played which as
[195.92s] tough as it was from what I hear the
[198.44s] East course is twice as hard so next
[201.36s] time we&#39;ll hit the East course uh that&#39;s
[203.599s] the frisco water tower which is pretty
[205.48s] cool and look at the size of this flag
[208.04s] and the patriotism happening in Dallas
[211.0s] that&#39;s our view here as they sang and we
[213.599s] sang the national anthem uh and by the
[217.12s] way it looked close there for like a
[219.0s] half a minute in the second quarter I
[221.2s] think it was 67 Dallas and I&#39;m sorry uh
[226.08s] Philly was winning 76 and uh and then it
[228.959s] just completely unraveled as soon as I
[230.84s] texted my friends T turn on the TV this
[232.92s] is a close one uh it just absolutely
[235.48s] blew out so there&#39;s some more photos
[237.28s] there and that was just an incredible
[239.879s] time thanks to my gracious host Chris
[242.76s] and also Brian uh really appreciate it
[245.84s] that&#39;s the PGA headquarters is now at
[249.439s] the fields Ranch we got this
[252.76s] incredible uh bag from our generous host
[256.16s] look at this incredible titlist hat with
[258.959s] the fields Ranch logo and we got Fields
[263.08s] Ranch uh towels which is just
[267.0s] incredible uh and you&#39;re going to hear
[269.12s] be hearing a a lot about this course in
[271.16s] the coming years with Majors coming to a
[275.08s] TV screen near you couple quick
[277.68s] highlights from Mimi&#39;s thing here was
[279.28s] one of my favorite assist from watching
[281.24s] her remote
[283.08s] remotely there she is there with the
[286.84s] ball
[289.919s] number wide open that&#39;s that and then
[294.16s] one of my favorite goals right here look
[297.96s] at this one timer this is mim down
[301.23s] [Music]
[303.16s] here boom one
[306.56s] TI Again by number 14 mine Hayes all
[310.52s] right yeah that&#39;s her full name meline
[312.759s] uh and that was exciting I love that one
[314.72s] timer and then I had the pleasure to
[317.16s] join Stu Varney uh literally off the red
[321.319s] eyee well it wasn&#39;t wasn&#39;t really a rede
[323.759s] I landed at like 2: in the morning and
[325.759s] uh and then did the 9:00 a.m. hit and a
[330.16s] jet leg when you fly west to east anyway
[333.08s] uh it was great and got to talk about
[336.319s] Outlook and the
[338.44s] implications of the sweep which was not
[341.72s] appropriate to talk about last week but
[344.199s] this week it&#39;s exceptionally appropriate
[346.36s] because if you have a reduction in the
[350.56s] corporate tax rate from 21% to
[352.88s] 15% tax expense declines by
[358.52s] 29% uh uh which could have serious
[361.039s] implications now uh that probably takes
[364.0s] earnings from 275 over 300 but if you
[367.84s] add in the multiplier effect and the
[370.12s] compounding effect over a couple of
[371.8s] years you start looking at $350 of
[374.44s] earnings whereas maybe without it we
[376.479s] would have been looking at like 310 to
[379.52s] 320 a couple years out um which makes us
[383.24s] a little bit fully valued here but when
[385.639s] you take into effect the tax
[390.36s] benefit and the multiplier effect and a
[393.199s] couple years out uh makes our multiple
[396.16s] look a lot more reasonable which is
[397.68s] which the market is sniffing out here
[399.52s] with a full sweep of the house and and
[401.44s] not just one or two seats but more than
[403.479s] that is a big deal so let&#39;s listen in
[405.4s] here analysis of this we&#39;ve got it from
[407.44s] Tom Hayes who joins us here in New York
[409.24s] this morning can Bitcoin just keep on
[411.68s] running well I think Ste Bitcoin is the
[414.68s] new vix it&#39;s a sentiment indicator and
[417.479s] what it&#39;s telling us right now is animal
[419.639s] Spirits are back it has momentum it has
[422.199s] trading momentum and it probably goes to
[424.4s] 100,000 based on what I have no idea but
[427.56s] it&#39;s people are excited about it the
[429.599s] policy is uh proc crypto from the from
[431.96s] this new Administration and uh it&#39;s
[434.36s] telling us that people believe in Risk
[436.879s] people believe in the future and it&#39;s
[439.039s] also consistent with what we see since
[441.8s] 1932 in election years the markets risk
[445.639s] assets tend to Rally into the
[447.72s] inauguration and then the first six
[449.599s] months of that next year as we absorb
[451.52s] policy so not so good it grinds a little
[454.0s] sideways a little choppy before the
[455.36s] yearend rally you&#39;re talking about
[456.8s] animal spirits beginning to run Riot
[458.72s] again okay are the animal spirits
[460.919s] running riot in the stock market are you
[463.199s] talking about a melt up here it could be
[466.8s] and here&#39;s the white swan that very few
[468.96s] people are talking about overnight there
[470.44s] were some news outlets kind of calling
[472.639s] the Republican sweep if that is
[474.8s] confirmed the corporate tax rate goes
[477.52s] from 21% to % which means the tax
[482.199s] expense is reduced by 29% earnings power
[485.879s] of the S&amp;P 500 could go from
[488.759s] 275 to 354 what does that mean in
[491.96s] English Ste it means the multiple of the
[494.36s] market comes down from 21.8 times down
[497.479s] to 16.9 times which would imply the
[500.599s] market is not expensive at 21.8 it could
[504.0s] be reasonable at 16.9 if they push that
[508.039s] through but we got to have a clean sweep
[510.96s] the house has to stay Republican that&#39;s
[513.32s] right and that at the moment has not
[514.88s] been confirmed that has not been
[516.479s] confirmed but you had voter out
[517.959s] overnight you had a couple other news
[519.44s] organizations saying it&#39;s it&#39;s all but a
[521.959s] foregone conclusion so we&#39;ll know more
[523.64s] in the next 48 hours if that happens and
[525.92s] the corporate tax rate drops down to 15%
[528.959s] we are going to see some strong economic
[531.56s] growth over the next four years like
[533.04s] we&#39;ve never seen before roaring 2000s
[535.64s] continues I like the sound of that there
[537.48s] you go that&#39;s my mannerism by the way
[539.48s] all right Thomas thank you very much
[540.64s] indeed here&#39;s what we have and we&#39;re
[543.68s] back thanks again to Christian dagger
[545.72s] and Stu vanney for having me on
[549.16s] um and
[552.0s] uh that&#39;s that a couple quotes of the
[554.64s] week before we get down to a lot of
[556.72s] great data this week first and foremost
[560.2s] the big money is in is not in the buying
[562.64s] and the selling but in the waiting
[564.32s] that&#39;s from the late Charlie Monger one
[566.959s] of the Legends Buffett as I always talk
[569.12s] about price is what you pay values what
[570.92s] you get get we&#39;re going to talk about
[572.68s] that in an environment where things like
[575.519s] Bitcoin are going to
[577.48s] $100,000 and um you know we have a
[580.279s] little bit of Crazy Town happening with
[582.519s] uh animal spirits you have to keep
[584.399s] yourself grounded because if you don&#39;t
[586.2s] and you get caught up in the frenzy and
[587.76s] you buy things you know that don&#39;t make
[590.32s] sense certain companies trading at you
[592.76s] know 50 times sales uh Etc sooner or
[596.68s] later like we saw with the SMC of the
[599.88s] world that absolutely collapsed uh it
[603.2s] comes down to reality so you just have
[604.839s] to ground yourself when everything&#39;s
[606.399s] moving and we&#39;re going to show you uh
[609.92s] what happened in 2016 late 2016 when
[614.079s] Trump was first elected with a
[616.959s] sweep and what that meant and how there
[619.519s] were some early fake outs so uh you
[622.88s] don&#39;t have to worry about that when you
[624.079s] know what you own and you know why you
[625.279s] own it you do have to worry about it if
[627.24s] you&#39;re trading on price and fomo and and
[629.48s] emotion versus quality framework and
[632.6s] Analysis Buffett the most important
[634.68s] quality for an investor is temperament
[637.279s] not intellect we emphasize that each
[639.44s] week and then finally Charlie Munger all
[642.04s] intelligent investing is value investing
[644.2s] acquiring more than you are paying for
[646.6s] you must value the business in order to
[648.56s] Value the stock and that&#39;s why these
[650.839s] short-term fluctuations never bothers
[653.079s] bother us you know people always like
[655.279s] you have ice in your veins well no I
[657.279s] don&#39;t have ice in my veins I I have
[660.12s] a consistent repeatable framework that I
[663.36s] apply across a basket of 10 12 companies
[666.76s] and some take off immediately overnight
[669.079s] and we re profits faster than we
[670.8s] expected and some take a little bit
[672.2s] longer but they all work over time when
[675.56s] the framework is correct the only thing
[677.44s] that can change is if the fundamentals
[679.079s] dramatically change then we change our
[680.6s] mind but um more often than not it&#39;s
[683.6s] it&#39;s a Time Arbitrage game where we sit
[685.839s] on our butts with low leverage and when
[688.079s] they reach our
[689.959s] predetermined uh level of fair and fully
[692.72s] valued we just start to lay off as as uh
[695.76s] uh everyone else gets excited and uh
[697.92s] they want the stock at the highs and we
[700.12s] help them out so I put together this
[703.399s] list of quote unquote Trump trades
[706.48s] because I want to show you what is the
[709.519s] setup what was the setup going into the
[712.12s] election in November of 2016 right
[715.279s] before Trump sweeped and then what
[717.48s] happened thereafter here and what you
[720.0s] can see here this first one is small
[723.04s] caps and you can see it was weakening
[725.16s] into the election and then as soon as he
[726.959s] was elected it shot straight up a little
[729.48s] consolidation straight up and then it
[731.639s] Consolidated those gains for about a
[733.68s] half a year very similar to what we
[735.959s] talked about with Stu where you get a
[738.079s] rally into the inauguration and then you
[740.88s] get some
[741.92s] sideways uh consolidation and chop uh
[746.079s] the first half even down the first half
[748.32s] before a year and rally and I just want
[751.88s] to show you
[754.399s] here uh yeah this goes all the way to
[756.72s] December so you see this sideways chop
[759.12s] into the straight up into the
[761.0s] inauguration chop grind even negative
[764.079s] into uh late summer and then a year-end
[767.24s] rally once again off those lows
[771.48s] so we&#39;re going to go through asset class
[774.959s] by asset class even the arc uh this is
[778.36s] the Kathy Woods um ETF that that had
[782.24s] been slaughtered in recent years is
[783.92s] starting to show signs of life and as
[785.959s] you can see it was Tech based so right
[789.16s] after the election it got a little bit
[790.92s] of pop and then it rolled over and it
[793.32s] was kind of just grinding here until the
[796.6s] inauguration and believe it or not after
[799.16s] the inauguration when small caps slowed
[805.56s] down this speculative Tech picked up and
[810.0s] never looked back and was almost a
[811.72s] double after the inauguration so if you
[814.32s] got most of the games into the
[816.24s] inauguration this was where you picked
[818.32s] up the mantle and got the biggest gains
[820.199s] after the inauguration which is going to
[821.6s] be consistent you&#39;ll see with biotech
[823.92s] and some of the other things that that
[825.519s] people think oh that won&#39;t work in the
[827.16s] Trump Administration it&#39;s only
[828.76s] Industrials and you know energy which is
[831.24s] the exact wrong thing and we&#39;re going to
[832.72s] show you
[835.0s] why let&#39;s see what um so
[839.72s] Arc had been weak into the election
[841.839s] let&#39;s see what it did this
[845.32s] year so it was kind of grinding sideways
[848.04s] to weak into the election and had this
[849.959s] huge pop now it probably grinds back
[852.56s] before afterwards it&#39;s not necessarily
[854.839s] going to um repeat exactly because there
[857.639s] were some conditions that were uh um
[861.279s] different but we want to keep an you
[864.32s] know keep an open mind here because the
[867.279s] narratives that are circulating when you
[869.199s] look at the empirical data are proving
[871.04s] to be completely inaccurate uh here was
[874.88s] baba baba was weakening had peaked in
[879.639s] October was weakening into the election
[882.48s] and weakened for another two months all
[884.92s] the way into the
[886.16s] inauguration after he was
[888.56s] inaugurated in January of 2017 Baba went
[892.399s] from $84 to
[894.32s] $187 in 11 months so um that&#39;s really
[899.199s] interesting because everyone is
[900.519s] convinced and by the way he ran on
[902.199s] tariffs and protectionism in 2016 and
[905.199s] the Border by the way uh same Playbook
[908.12s] same hat uh one extra number and this is
[911.88s] what happens so on this basis it would
[914.519s] not be unreasonable for Baba to continue
[917.959s] to be weak until the inauguration
[920.279s] although I think conditions are slightly
[923.04s] different in that it also wouldn&#39;t be
[925.92s] surprising for earnings to be positive
[928.519s] something happen with uh with Chinese
[931.16s] stimulus or something or other that
[932.639s] maybe we take off a little bit
[933.959s] beforehand but either way it makes no
[937.319s] real difference if it&#39;s a month more two
[939.36s] months more uh or not the key is that
[944.12s] the Tariff King Chinese stocks did
[946.519s] better than ever after his inauguration
[949.519s] now let&#39;s take a look at what happened
[951.839s] this year now you could start to see why
[953.68s] this is going to be such a long
[954.92s] incredible amazing call uh I should
[957.88s] probably be charging
[959.519s] $50,000 for this call and you&#39;ll see why
[961.839s] by the end of this the the the podcast
[965.8s] um but um we&#39;re not going to do that so
[970.44s] uh we want to deliver value and um and
[973.44s] go from there so interestingly enough
[975.72s] what happened with Baba is it peaked
[978.639s] again in October look what happened here
[982.24s] early October in 2016 early October in
[987.44s] um 202 24 week into the
[992.48s] election week into the election and then
[995.199s] was weak again for the other two months
[997.639s] into January 1st was weak again into the
[1000.8s] other two months so we could go lower
[1002.759s] before we go higher that&#39;s not uh
[1004.639s] impossible at all but um we&#39;ll see we&#39;ve
[1007.759s] got earnings tomorrow which is going to
[1009.04s] be a big deal the name of the game is
[1010.6s] zooming out and looking at the big
[1012.0s] picture after you had that initial
[1013.639s] weakness and uncertainty from the Tariff
[1015.639s] King uh the thing absolutely took off
[1018.12s] and ripped higher so if we went to 85 so
[1021.16s] here is interesting it went from it
[1022.88s] peaked at 107 in 2016 and dropped to 84
[1026.28s] before the inauguration here we&#39;re peing
[1028.64s] at
[1030.28s] 117 which would
[1032.4s] imply uh you know so it&#39;s 10 points
[1035.28s] higher so maybe we get 10 points higher
[1037.12s] than the low we would we would bottom
[1040.199s] around 90 or so versus 85 like the last
[1043.12s] time so we&#39;re probably close to it maybe
[1045.12s] we go down to 85 like we did the last
[1046.959s] time before going to 185 but but um all
[1051.6s] that is effectively nois the key is is
[1055.6s] to zoom out see the big picture and it&#39;s
[1057.88s] going to recover and um and that&#39;s where
[1060.44s] it&#39;s at then what else 50 which is the
[1063.799s] IBD 50 which
[1065.799s] is uh momo stocks growth stocks were
[1069.0s] weak into the election and then they
[1071.0s] took off so let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on
[1073.44s] this
[1074.24s] year uh a little bit weak into the
[1076.559s] election took off so maybe we&#39;ll get see
[1078.88s] some similar stuff like that uh iwm is
[1082.12s] also small caps shot like a rocket
[1085.32s] Consolidated into the inauguration and
[1087.52s] then kind of grinded sideways for a half
[1089.08s] a year before a yearend rally uh we
[1091.679s] covered that kweb same as Baba continued
[1094.6s] to weaken and then after the
[1096.039s] inauguration took off went from 30 to
[1098.559s] effectively
[1100.64s] 54 in less than a
[1103.28s] year uh equal weight week into the
[1106.0s] election same story
[1109.84s] uh
[1112.64s] semiconductors fell into the election
[1114.72s] grinded for a few weeks and then
[1116.32s] continued the uptrend let&#39;s see what
[1118.0s] semiconductors are doing
[1124.919s] here yeah same thing kind of grinding it
[1127.96s] very interesting setups here uh SNP was
[1131.72s] weak into the election shot up
[1134.84s] Consolidated those gains
[1139.08s] and then just kind of grinded higher the
[1141.32s] whole next year so let&#39;s see what Spy is
[1146.12s] doing little bit weak to the election
[1148.52s] shot up and should continue to persist
[1151.24s] which which be kind of
[1153.12s] interesting um
[1156.84s] solar very weak into the election it&#39;s
[1159.72s] almost as if they knew the election
[1161.88s] outcome same right now very very weak
[1164.96s] into the election and then what happened
[1166.919s] bumped around for two months and then
[1168.76s] recovered so there might be some
[1170.44s] opportunity in solar we&#39;ve been talking
[1171.96s] about the last week or so that we&#39;d be
[1174.0s] keeping our eyes open and and we will
[1177.08s] biotech very weak into the election in
[1179.84s] 2016 ripped higher weak into the
[1183.44s] inauguration looks a lot like Baba and
[1185.76s] then uh from 58 to 88 in less than a
[1189.159s] year so let&#39;s see what this is doing
[1193.36s] little
[1194.44s] weakness into the election shot higher
[1197.039s] grinded sideways so that we could see
[1199.12s] some
[1200.08s] weakness um before strength resumes here
[1204.2s] is oil servicers
[1207.0s] xes had a little weakness into the
[1209.12s] election straight up like a rocket ship
[1211.08s] after Trump got elected in
[1213.0s] 2016 into the inauguration as soon as he
[1215.559s] was inaugurated complete crash 50% crash
[1219.039s] in oil servicers from the inauguration
[1222.2s] till August of that year let&#39;s see
[1224.679s] what&#39;s going on right now this might be
[1226.28s] a great short for next year uh um oil
[1229.64s] servicers so it shot up after the
[1232.28s] election let&#39;s see if it keeps grinding
[1233.88s] higher into the inauguration and we may
[1236.32s] put that on as a short in January uh
[1239.679s] that could be an incredible short let&#39;s
[1241.799s] put that
[1245.36s] down again these things are not going to
[1247.44s] repeat but they are going to rhyme
[1249.159s] here&#39;s in uh materials was weak and then
[1252.32s] just never looked back let&#39;s take a look
[1254.28s] at
[1255.28s] materials little week let that could be
[1257.88s] an interesting
[1259.799s] long we have a albamar for that already
[1264.4s] which is doing well communication
[1266.88s] Services a little weak and grind and
[1269.039s] then straight
[1274.44s] up little bit okay we&#39;ll
[1278.44s] see energy same story shot up after the
[1285.039s] election after the inauguration was a
[1287.32s] complete short into August let&#39;s see
[1289.12s] what happened is happening here little
[1292.24s] weakness into election shot up so this
[1294.36s] would be another
[1295.559s] short after the
[1299.039s] inauguration as he announces I&#39;m sure
[1301.52s] drilling on every federal land under the
[1303.84s] sun they will uh move all the moose and
[1307.799s] the elk and the
[1309.12s] Deer uh into retirement homes and drill
[1312.24s] baby drill
[1314.24s] XLF uh again was kind of like
[1319.919s] sh sideways into the election shot
[1322.6s] straight up and then grinded sideways
[1324.279s] for a half a
[1329.64s] year and let&#39;s see here shot
[1335.48s] up probably grind sideways for a half a
[1338.4s] year uh regionals I think have a little
[1341.039s] further to go let me just see here KR
[1350.72s] yeah same story shot up and then grinded
[1353.279s] sideways for a
[1356.96s] year all right Industrials shot up after
[1361.08s] the election kind of kept
[1363.76s] going see what&#39;s going on here shot off
[1367.48s] after the election we&#39;ll see if it keeps
[1368.919s] going we had a lot of strength okay Tech
[1373.4s] kind of bumped around for a couple of
[1375.12s] months and then just continued to
[1377.0s] persist higher let&#39;s see what&#39;s
[1379.679s] happening here shot up a little bit
[1382.08s] after the election we&#39;ll
[1383.799s] see uh if it continues to persist higher
[1386.64s] I think there&#39;s some opportunity here
[1388.6s] Staples was not only week into the
[1391.88s] election went even lower so if we get a
[1394.48s] lot of tax loss selling in December and
[1397.12s] we find a bottom there there&#39;s probably
[1398.84s] some opportunity in Staples let&#39;s just
[1402.0s] take a look here
[1409.799s] so yeah look at
[1411.72s] this Staples was going weak into the
[1414.4s] election got
[1416.159s] weaker and then bottomed in December
[1419.6s] before recovering
[1422.0s] completely so probably some further
[1424.72s] weakness and then there there might be
[1426.2s] some opportunity
[1428.159s] there utilities were
[1431.6s] absolutely week into the election
[1434.6s] grinding around and then started to work
[1436.88s] higher let&#39;s see what utilities have
[1439.2s] been doing week into the election same
[1441.679s] type of story so there&#39;ll probably be an
[1443.799s] opportunity in a few weeks to take a
[1446.2s] look
[1447.76s] at some of
[1452.72s] those healthc care super weak into the
[1456.039s] election Spike weakness again into
[1458.32s] December and then totally took off I
[1460.799s] think they&#39;re going to be great
[1461.799s] opportunities in healthc care weakness
[1463.919s] into the election we&#39;ll probably see a
[1465.279s] little more weakness and then there&#39;ll
[1466.88s] be opportunities so these are places to
[1469.88s] look
[1472.36s] um
[1473.96s] xlu
[1476.48s] xlk
[1478.799s] XL
[1485.0s] V consumer discretionary week into the
[1488.12s] election never look back and that&#39;s one
[1491.44s] that we&#39;ve been uh talking about since
[1493.6s] the summer time to get loaded up on uh
[1496.159s] discretionary and that&#39;s what happened
[1498.6s] let&#39;s talk about what else here uh xop I
[1503.399s] think we covered these are basically oh
[1505.399s] no these are exploration and production
[1507.44s] stocks down into the election straight
[1509.96s] up
[1511.679s] after and
[1514.279s] then down into election straight up
[1516.52s] after this probably rips higher and then
[1518.399s] that becomes a short after the
[1520.96s] inauguration or shortly before
[1524.279s] it uh retail this could get this will
[1528.399s] probably get hit by the
[1530.2s] tariffs uh this is going to be a
[1534.2s] short
[1536.76s] um week into the election huge rip into
[1540.2s] December and then straight down from
[1542.679s] there after the
[1544.159s] inauguration let&#39;s take a look here yeah
[1547.559s] shot up after the election that could be
[1548.919s] an interesting
[1550.36s] short
[1554.44s] um and that&#39;s it so there you go there&#39;s
[1557.559s] your Trump trade 2026
[1560.24s] 2024 uh now wanted to zoom out on a
[1562.799s] number of names we&#39;ve discussed on the
[1564.559s] podcast some of which we own for clients
[1567.36s] and personally uh across accounts so
[1570.76s] this is Advanced Auto Parts uh we&#39;re
[1572.96s] going to cover a little bit about the
[1574.12s] earnings basically they shut all their
[1576.039s] unprofitable stuff in the west that they
[1577.64s] had no economies to scale uh and uh and
[1581.799s] now they&#39;re going to have an absolute
[1583.32s] cash machine with this with a clean
[1585.159s] balance sheet and that&#39;s why the market
[1587.12s] was rallying
[1588.799s] uh uh
[1590.08s] today uh off of earnings so that&#39;s good
[1592.64s] to see but in the scheme of things this
[1594.88s] is what their normal bottoming process
[1596.72s] looks like these fake outs and then it
[1599.12s] slowly grinds higher and No One Believes
[1601.08s] it disbelief and then it recovers and
[1603.2s] then same will happen with Advanced Auto
[1605.12s] Parts albam Maro continuing to climb
[1607.24s] higher from those lows when we were
[1608.64s] talking about it on the podcast Asos
[1611.039s] it&#39;s been dead money for a year it&#39;s a
[1612.88s] tiny position and um we&#39;ll keep an eye
[1616.039s] on it but no reason to add on that yet
[1618.76s] uh and no real reason to get out either
[1621.44s] um Boeing uh is trying to really flush
[1624.76s] out the last few weekends in the stock
[1627.32s] this makes absolutely zero sense
[1629.24s] anywhere I have money I&#39;m buying more um
[1632.64s] personally across client accounts this
[1635.559s] you know this is one of these that could
[1637.279s] go to a 100 before it goes back to 400
[1640.2s] but uh I wouldn&#39;t bet on that I think
[1642.32s] this is actually you know what let&#39;s
[1643.799s] take a look and see what it did under
[1646.159s] the Trump 2016 I I think we&#39;re going to
[1648.6s] be referring back to these charts a lot
[1650.96s] let&#39;s see uh today now that we have a a
[1654.24s] sweep so it was sideways kind of
[1659.279s] grinding
[1661.159s] uh into the election and then it&#39;s and
[1664.159s] then it didn&#39;t even look back from 100
[1666.36s] to 300 in a in a year after Trump got
[1669.279s] elected what&#39;s interesting about
[1672.36s] that
[1675.84s] is it&#39;s been so it basically had come
[1680.12s] off of this super low in early
[1683.399s] 2016 and then it you know didn&#39;t go back
[1686.0s] and test it but it was just grinding
[1687.72s] sideways doing nothing and then somehow
[1690.12s] after the election it took off
[1695.24s] um we had that
[1697.399s] low in late TW uh 22 grinding sideways
[1702.159s] didn&#39;t retest the
[1703.72s] lows uh we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see but uh uh
[1708.159s] you know what if you look at when Trump
[1710.2s] was elected right here and then
[1712.399s] inaugurated the thing just went straight
[1714.08s] up for the first two years Trump was in
[1715.679s] office so there&#39;s something to be said
[1717.44s] for
[1724.0s] that Bo Baba okay they&#39;ve got earnings
[1727.32s] tomorrow shot up fake out we covered you
[1731.039s] know what it did oh here by the way this
[1733.64s] is kind of interesting this is when
[1735.799s] Trump was inaugurated right here so it
[1738.44s] was in a shoot up off of lows pullback
[1741.399s] this is really rhyming like nobody&#39;s
[1743.08s] business so it probably goes you know in
[1745.76s] that theme it could go lower all the way
[1747.559s] into January barely lower into the mid
[1750.039s] 80s and then it went straight up to 207
[1752.72s] the first two years that the Tariff King
[1754.48s] was in power so
[1757.12s] um I don&#39;t like it I don&#39;t like six more
[1760.32s] weeks of pain I do like uh six months of
[1763.72s] massive gain so uh delayed gratification
[1766.519s] there uh we&#39;ll see let&#39;s see what
[1768.48s] happens with earnings tomorrow uh Baxter
[1771.32s] same nonsense as the 2014 to 2016 lows
[1775.279s] that we&#39;ve had from the 2023 to 2025
[1778.36s] lows it just keeps doing these grinds
[1780.32s] and fake outs until it finally breaks
[1782.12s] out and then recovers big big time we&#39;ll
[1784.88s] cover some of those earnings um bu we&#39;ve
[1788.159s] only touched on barely uh CCI this is
[1791.6s] interesting crown castle uh down because
[1794.84s] of the rates but this will recover be
[1797.44s] interesting to see see what happened
[1798.72s] just
[1799.399s] for uh you know what and
[1802.799s] Giggles very fascinating was super duper
[1806.039s] week into the election and then never
[1808.2s] look back 57 to 87 over the next 12
[1810.6s] months let&#39;s see what happened
[1813.559s] here super week into the election same
[1816.2s] thing so crown castle opportunity to
[1818.6s] pick up some more Cooper standard shot
[1820.919s] up to 17 this week pulled back today on
[1823.2s] that EV subsidy removal which makes zero
[1826.88s] sense because all of our models based on
[1828.48s] IC hybrids are whipped
[1832.2s] cream and EVS is not even in our model
[1835.44s] but you know the market has to react
[1836.799s] with the alos no big
[1839.6s] deal actually let&#39;s see what happened
[1841.96s] now I&#39;m really curious about all we&#39;re
[1844.0s] going to be here all night ladies and
[1845.08s] gentlemen but that&#39;s fine by me you can
[1846.72s] you can tune out whenever you don&#39;t like
[1848.159s] it but uh let&#39;s see he got it was week
[1851.44s] into the
[1853.919s] election I don&#39;t have a oh yeah I can
[1856.559s] make a daily chart here hold on
[1858.76s] on
[1860.96s] CPS was weaken to the election shot up
[1864.48s] pulled
[1866.44s] back week the election shot up little
[1869.0s] pullback straight
[1870.96s] up and kept going interesting okay good
[1876.08s] middle Cooper standard
[1878.6s] action uh Comstock
[1884.799s] resources keeps pushing higher
[1889.48s] uh
[1890.399s] diio interestingly enough Emerging
[1892.639s] Market stock look at
[1895.32s] this super weak into the election and
[1898.08s] then took off and never looked back
[1899.36s] these emerging market stocks
[1901.2s] unbelievable same type of setup this
[1904.6s] downward grind low at the election and
[1907.639s] then took off off the bottom I like that
[1912.96s] diio
[1914.6s] Disney shot the lights out today as we
[1917.639s] had said the parks and experiences were
[1919.76s] worth 85 alone we thought the streaming
[1922.48s] TV and movie was worth at least 100 over
[1925.2s] the next few years today they proved it
[1927.159s] out 4 million new subscribers we&#39;ll talk
[1929.12s] into some of those details shock stock
[1931.48s] shot up to 109 and if you remember me
[1934.559s] pitching it in the 70s and 80s and 90s
[1937.559s] no one you couldn&#39;t give it away uh
[1940.0s] still people are skeptical so um you
[1943.72s] know that&#39;ll be what it&#39;ll be but this
[1946.279s] thing is just getting going so pretty
[1948.12s] excited about that uh that&#39;s just a
[1950.559s] Regional Bank
[1955.32s] ETF s day louder here&#39;s another view you
[1958.84s] just zoom out weakness and then
[1963.2s] recovery Etsy pretty interesting was in
[1966.159s] a
[1966.96s] downtrend into the election continued
[1969.399s] weakness after the election and then
[1970.84s] never looked back from 10 bucks to 70
[1972.96s] bucks um we&#39;ll talk a little bit about
[1975.32s] that
[1976.0s] one uh here is gener had great earnings
[1980.76s] uh this thing is really just starting to
[1982.919s] rip um you know you might get a little
[1985.08s] bit more bottoming for the next couple
[1986.6s] of years but um you know with a two
[1989.559s] handle this starts to get really
[1990.6s] interesting with more than a double plus
[1993.12s] uh we&#39;ll be taking a look at that goose
[1995.2s] is just doing what it&#39;s doing uh
[1997.919s] interestingly enough Goose was crappy in
[1999.919s] early 2017 and then went parabolic uh
[2003.44s] into 2018 so goose is going to be just
[2005.96s] fine that&#39;s a China recovery play
[2008.32s] going to trade like Baba
[2011.159s] gxo huge rip on the um buyout rumors
[2015.48s] it&#39;s been grinding sideways we&#39;ll see
[2017.08s] what happens with
[2018.519s] that
[2019.72s] [Music]
[2023.159s] um hormell uh Intel all the way up to 26
[2027.96s] now it&#39;s at 25 bucks down up from 18 so
[2030.96s] this one this recovery is just getting
[2032.679s] started interestingly enough saw
[2034.72s] something similar in uh 200 16 into
[2039.679s] 2018 JD same fake out pullback that we
[2043.639s] saw in 2016 after the inauguration and
[2048.119s] then straight up from
[2049.76s] there uh Regional Banks this thing is
[2053.52s] this is this is getting a little bit
[2055.32s] extended I think uh maybe after the
[2057.679s] inauguration if it&#39;s in the mid 70s I
[2060.44s] might trim some profits here because if
[2062.48s] you remember we bought this way back in
[2065.639s] the um
[2068.24s] Silicon Valley National Bank crisis in
[2071.52s] 2023 so this has been more than a double
[2074.839s] uh and we want to start to not be pigs
[2077.28s] at the
[2078.24s] trough
[2079.76s] uh
[2081.52s] PayPal interesting PayPal was putting in
[2083.96s] a base in 2016 and 2017 a couple months
[2086.919s] after the inauguration parabolic move
[2089.2s] let&#39;s see ladies and gentlemen I mean
[2091.079s] this thing uh again no one would buy it
[2093.599s] in the 50s and 60s when we were pounding
[2095.48s] the table uh you know some of the host
[2098.079s] would look at me like I had three heads
[2099.92s] now it&#39;s in the 80s so uh definitely
[2104.0s] going to 100 in the near term and then I
[2106.119s] think probably a lot more over the next
[2107.52s] couple of years Alex Chris is doing an
[2109.2s] incredible job qxo just waiting for a
[2112.079s] deal announcement at any point uh
[2114.68s] probably take longer than everyone
[2116.0s] expects that&#39;s usually the way it works
[2118.04s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker same type of
[2120.72s] basing choppy volatility like you saw in
[2123.64s] 2016 before finally breaking to the
[2125.96s] upside and making new high
[2128.92s] uh small caps
[2131.72s] here little chop into the
[2134.44s] election uh straight up into the
[2136.359s] inauguration and then grinds higher for
[2138.119s] another couple years so we like small
[2140.2s] caps continued and then interestingly
[2143.119s] enough VF Corp was building a base back
[2146.119s] then as well and did exceptionally well
[2149.44s] as an Emerging Market play after the
[2151.24s] Trump inauguration uh into
[2154.119s] 2018 more than a double in uh in just
[2157.359s] over over a year so uh so we like that
[2160.48s] and biotech look at this ladies and
[2163.319s] gentlemen it had put it in its bottom
[2166.28s] and then little weakness into the
[2168.359s] election and then after the inauguration
[2170.8s] straight up broke out to new highs so
[2174.2s] biotech is going to continue to run this
[2176.04s] is all about patience ladies and
[2177.359s] gentlemen now uh I want to go so look
[2180.92s] I&#39;m telling you right now next week&#39;s
[2182.48s] podcast is going to be like 12 minutes
[2184.4s] because uh we are covering four weeks
[2187.119s] worth of off in one week why because we
[2190.24s] just had a massive sea change in our
[2192.56s] political landscape and I want to get
[2194.64s] you guys thinking correctly because most
[2197.28s] people out there are going to be
[2198.319s] dramatically faked out with recency bias
[2201.079s] thinking that the first moves are going
[2202.48s] to persist and you as you can see the
[2204.8s] first moves in some cases are monstrous
[2207.319s] fake outs here is the US
[2211.2s] dollar and
[2214.92s] um as you can see it topped back in
[2218.92s] October 2022 collaps has been in the
[2222.319s] sideways range I think we&#39;re at the top
[2224.359s] of the range and we&#39;re going to start to
[2226.16s] continue to re weaken I want to go
[2227.72s] through a bunch of Commodities because
[2230.079s] we haven&#39;t done it in a while and I want
[2232.319s] to get
[2233.24s] everyone on board so Bitcoin Animal
[2236.48s] Spirits through the
[2238.079s] roof
[2241.839s] um ethereum rip the thing about ethereum
[2245.52s] is it actually has some practical use
[2247.04s] application I have a good friend who um
[2250.68s] is one of the major people involved in
[2252.4s] that in size and when he explains it to
[2254.839s] you you&#39;re like okay that makes sense
[2257.04s] but the uh the other stuff uh not so
[2259.839s] sure uh here we go with commercials
[2262.8s] getting long hedge funds getting short
[2264.52s] the Euro so maybe a little bit more
[2267.24s] weakness before we see strength as a
[2269.359s] matter of fact we saw weakness right
[2271.96s] into the inauguration in
[2274.48s] 2017 and then what happened the Euro
[2276.72s] ripped higher for the next
[2282.28s] year Australian
[2285.0s] dollar same story similar story rather
[2289.64s] British
[2295.68s] pound already had kind of a move
[2298.119s] Canadian dollar look at commercials
[2301.04s] buying hand over fist like nobody&#39;s
[2304.68s] business uh hang in there Canadians
[2307.119s] you&#39;re going to get some strength uh
[2309.76s] Japanese
[2313.0s] Yen commercials have been buying
[2316.96s] ahead saw little strength I think that&#39;s
[2319.56s] going to
[2321.119s] resume let&#39;s look here we got Swiss
[2323.88s] frank no one really cares all right what
[2327.8s] else Mexican
[2329.599s] peso New Zealand dollar similar to the
[2333.4s] Australian dollar Brazilian real
[2336.44s] Flatline South African ran
[2339.68s] Flatline Bitcoin we covered all right
[2343.2s] let&#39;s get to the good stuff crude oil
[2345.04s] commercials have been buying while hedge
[2346.92s] funds have been
[2348.359s] shorting uh I think we&#39;re going to see
[2351.44s] some strength in oil in the short
[2355.2s] term uh what else we got
[2359.96s] here gasoline commercials have been
[2362.4s] buyers while hedge funds have been
[2363.72s] shorting you always want to bet with the
[2365.68s] commercials same with natural gas
[2367.88s] they&#39;ve been
[2368.92s] aggressively
[2378.56s] buying okay bonds baby bonds let&#39;s look
[2381.96s] at this 10 year where&#39;s the 10 year here
[2385.28s] we go commercial okay hedge funds are
[2388.24s] the most short that they&#39;ve been since
[2391.44s] 2018 even shorter than when we called
[2394.079s] the low in October 2023 and you got to
[2396.359s] rip your face off r
[2399.4s] so um the last time they were this short
[2402.16s] was
[2403.88s] 2018 and what happened you got the
[2406.64s] biggest rally in bonds of all time
[2408.44s] compression of yields uh I think you are
[2411.28s] going to see a rally in bonds and a
[2415.4s] compression of yields in coming months
[2418.4s] so this is a short-term counter move
[2420.64s] head funds are shorting in the hole and
[2423.16s] that they there&#39;s a guaranteed ripy face
[2425.52s] off coming to everyone shorting B bonds
[2427.72s] right now uh and by the way we&#39;ve been
[2430.359s] buying some T
[2432.04s] TLT
[2436.28s] um okay let&#39;s see what else we got
[2441.359s] here corn looking closer to a bottom
[2445.28s] than a
[2447.24s] top same with
[2449.72s] soybeans they can take a while to build
[2451.8s] a base so I don&#39;t want to draw any you
[2453.48s] know we&#39;re not trading any of these I
[2454.8s] just want to get it give you a sense of
[2457.0s] how things are looking in terms of
[2459.8s] inflation
[2461.72s] uh a lot of these things are are just
[2464.56s] coming in quite a bit spring wheat
[2468.319s] oats Ruff
[2470.48s] rice
[2473.0s] canola it&#39;s the SNP that&#39;s the
[2476.28s] [Music]
[2483.72s] NASDAQ Russell small caps is just
[2487.44s] breaking out to all-time highs just like
[2490.28s] we saw after the election in
[2493.16s] 2017 and then climbed higher after this
[2496.8s] breakout so that was the election
[2501.28s] November 16 then some follow through
[2504.28s] then it broke out and continued going
[2505.839s] into 2018 so very
[2512.96s] interesting see if there&#39;s anything else
[2515.2s] here we got to cover I go through all
[2518.04s] these things every
[2520.4s] week live cattle looks like more like a
[2524.079s] short than a
[2526.319s] long um feeder cattle same
[2531.24s] thing that&#39;s good steak prices come down
[2534.44s] I like to eat
[2535.56s] steak uh all
[2538.68s] right by the way if you ever get up to
[2540.68s] Ridgefield Connecticut there&#39;s this
[2542.24s] place called hoodoo Brown get the beef
[2544.8s] rib it&#39;s the greatest piece of meat you
[2547.319s] will ever eat in your life um absolutely
[2550.96s] incredible and yeah interesting all
[2553.76s] right
[2562.839s] uh she
[2565.68s] gold hedge funds are tripping over
[2568.52s] themselves to buy more commercials are
[2570.16s] shorting at the top uh I&#39;d take the side
[2573.0s] of commercials but it could it could
[2574.4s] persist for many months before it
[2575.88s] collapses
[2578.319s] um
[2579.88s] copper Dr copper shows signs of the
[2583.04s] economy it&#39;s showing some strength here
[2585.8s] it&#39;s usually a precursor for China
[2587.68s] growth they&#39;re stocking up the demand is
[2590.839s] growing Palladium weak remember when you
[2594.4s] couldn&#39;t get it everyone wanted
[2596.24s] Palladium a couple years
[2599.0s] ago I remember all that asked me
[2601.24s] anything questions what about Palladium
[2603.119s] right here everyone wanted
[2605.52s] Palladium I think it was on EV
[2608.24s] excuse my
[2609.319s] language
[2611.2s] uh uranium so now everyone wants uranium
[2614.48s] that&#39;ll be the same story two years I&#39;ll
[2617.359s] say remember when everyone wanted
[2619.88s] uranium cotton I think that is a
[2622.4s] long-term story
[2623.92s] cotton so that speaks to inflation
[2627.48s] coffee wow coffee all the hedge funds
[2629.96s] are long as hell and commercials are
[2633.0s] shorting it that&#39;s a
[2635.559s] short coffee is a short might take a
[2639.079s] couple of years but uh coffee will be
[2641.28s] much
[2642.319s] lower uh two years from now than it is
[2644.64s] today and it might go a lot higher
[2646.4s] before it goes lower it&#39;s why we&#39;re not
[2648.44s] in the Commodities business we&#39;re in the
[2649.8s] equity&#39;s business but Coco same
[2655.839s] story OJ that&#39;s going to be one of the
[2658.119s] biggest shorts It&#39;s been putting in this
[2659.599s] top for a
[2660.88s] year uh probably collapses after
[2664.599s] February after their winter season
[2669.72s] and
[2671.96s] sugar okay some market indicators maybe
[2675.24s] it should be a $75,000 call not a
[2677.16s] $50,000 call uh all right let&#39;s see here
[2681.0s] put call ratio 10day moving
[2686.839s] average most of these the theme you&#39;re
[2689.119s] going to find as we scroll through these
[2690.599s] is they&#39;re all in the middle they&#39;re in
[2692.0s] no man&#39;s land they&#39;re not at
[2694.24s] extremes a couple of them are
[2698.68s] where you would want to do a dramatic
[2700.76s] change in your allocation because
[2702.4s] everything looked overbought or
[2704.2s] oversold uh Dow intermediate term breath
[2708.119s] momentum this is usually what you find
[2710.319s] closer to bottom so maybe we&#39;re closer
[2712.68s] to a bottom on that I don&#39;t
[2714.96s] know uh mlen summation
[2718.68s] again you know it does look like after
[2721.839s] this we covered last week
[2724.96s] the seasonal weakness in late November
[2729.04s] after in an election year after the
[2731.68s] initial surge in early November you get
[2733.839s] weakness into the end of the third week
[2736.16s] before that recovery into December so
[2737.92s] that&#39;s what we&#39;re dealing with right now
[2739.319s] that&#39;s why everything is kind of
[2740.24s] mid-range here pmo by SPX at 100 I would
[2743.839s] start to say okay but you
[2748.88s] know there&#39;s not a signal to wholesale
[2752.359s] buy or sell anything right now it&#39;s very
[2754.599s] selective and very nuanced
[2764.0s] okay let&#39;s go into the charts of the
[2766.64s] week margin debt below averages so again
[2770.44s] this is not extreme uh like you saw in
[2777.92s] 2021 scrolling down this is just a
[2780.559s] change in the FED we&#39;ll cover some of
[2783.04s] that in a minute
[2787.559s] here is a chart of the Japanese Yen
[2790.72s] looking like a bottom here from Kimble
[2792.319s] charting I thought that was interesting
[2794.48s] this chart I put up here this is the Fed
[2796.44s] funds rate and the reason is I wanted to
[2798.04s] show you what a midcycle
[2801.319s] easing looks like so most people think
[2805.92s] this has to go all the way back down to
[2807.44s] zero and then you get one of these gray
[2808.92s] lines which is called the recession and
[2810.44s] it&#39;s simply not the case uh what you can
[2813.44s] have like you had in
[2815.599s] the uh 60s was a midcycle cut that here
[2820.319s] was 200 basis points the rally lasted
[2822.88s] for another three or four
[2824.68s] years uh same thing
[2832.04s] here and the best analog in my view is
[2836.96s] this
[2837.96s] 1995 where you had cut from you know
[2842.359s] 625 down to 450 and that&#39;s it and the
[2845.88s] game kept going
[2847.92s] uh for another 5 years so I could
[2850.28s] certainly see a move down to like I&#39;ve
[2852.44s] said I was in the minority camp that our
[2855.359s] terminal rate would be four versus three
[2858.04s] and listening to some of the FED
[2859.319s] speakers I think that&#39;s becoming more
[2860.96s] and more realistic and that would look a
[2863.28s] lot like the midcycle cut and we&#39;ve got
[2865.119s] enough growth demand and demographics to
[2867.16s] drive the economy and the stock market
[2868.68s] with 4% rates so um here&#39;s the Japanese
[2872.76s] Yen here like I said I think this is
[2874.319s] going to resume strength uh here is a
[2877.48s] the channel for the dollar I think this
[2879.2s] is going to resume
[2880.559s] weakness and same thing
[2883.359s] here PMI diffusion encouraging signs for
[2886.599s] manufacturing we&#39;ve covered central
[2889.52s] banks on your side 74% of major central
[2892.96s] banks are in easing mode versus only 9%
[2895.44s] in July
[2897.319s] 2023 so this is what you see at the
[2899.4s] beginning of Cycles which um with
[2902.0s] business friendly growth policies coming
[2904.2s] to a theater near you this can extend
[2906.8s] for a very long
[2916.0s] time history suggests the market rise in
[2919.16s] the 3 months from the date of the
[2920.599s] election before leveling off which would
[2922.48s] imply January which would imply all the
[2925.079s] charts that we&#39;ve already gone through
[2926.96s] the Bank of America bull bear indicator
[2929.52s] is bullish but not at an extreme level
[2932.599s] so we&#39;re in this kind of mid a lot of
[2934.799s] people have gained
[2936.839s] huge home equity in the last 3 4 years
[2940.079s] which has a wealth effect biggest inflow
[2942.599s] into small caps since July of 2024 so
[2945.359s] people are getting The Message Tech
[2947.24s] outflows biggest outflow in Tech since
[2951.44s] 2002 China home sales Rises the first
[2954.839s] time this year so the stimulus is taking
[2957.16s] effect the market doesn&#39;t realize it yet
[2959.24s] maybe it takes until January to realize
[2960.96s] it maybe it takes them until tomorrow I
[2962.599s] don&#39;t know uh Goldman sentiment
[2965.04s] indicator all I can tell you is the
[2966.96s] reload on the uh options that we took
[2969.96s] off uh in early October which uh was
[2973.76s] absolutely
[2974.92s] incredible uh is in full effect so
[2979.079s] um uh we get a few more weekdays or
[2982.0s] weeks we we&#39;ll top up a hair but we&#39;ve
[2984.04s] been you know today was a busy day and
[2986.92s] um we&#39;re happy to be fully reloaded uh
[2990.359s] Goldman sentiment and by the way we&#39;ve
[2992.079s] not uh touched the stock the stock is
[2994.359s] the stock uh not sold share we have
[2998.04s] bought shares as we&#39;ve gotten new cash
[2999.96s] in but uh uh that&#39;s that Goldman
[3003.44s] sentiment indicators moving up uh
[3006.319s] election year seasonal composite
[3008.359s] November 11th through March
[3015.119s] 15th so this is what we&#39;re talking about
[3017.76s] you get that rally in the early November
[3019.96s] weakness into the 18th and then you
[3022.64s] start to get that recovery all the way
[3024.599s] into year end into the inauguration
[3027.28s] and then you get the grind sideways for
[3029.04s] like six months
[3032.0s] so we&#39;re probably getting close to what
[3035.319s] is this so probably by Thanksgiving week
[3038.4s] we start to uh start to recover a
[3041.52s] bit and uh and then rally into year end
[3044.839s] over the past couple of months average
[3046.119s] spending on holiday items has started to
[3047.599s] rise above
[3049.4s] 2023
[3052.04s] levels so we&#39;re back over
[3059.2s] yeah this is going to be a good holiday
[3060.48s] season I I can just sense it uh which
[3063.799s] will be good for Etsy by the way which
[3065.359s] we talked about and
[3069.64s] um spending is starting to rise consumer
[3072.96s] sentiment has been rising since
[3074.88s] July holiday spending unwrapped consumer
[3077.88s] shows solid momentum as we head into the
[3082.64s] holidays Financial pit position appear
[3085.599s] sound
[3087.72s] uh foure election cycle so this is the
[3089.799s] election year you get rally then some
[3092.28s] weakness and then year end
[3094.64s] rally and then a little bit in the first
[3097.119s] half in the postelection year this is
[3099.52s] since 1900 this consolidation before you
[3102.4s] get the year end rally the midterm year
[3104.72s] is the weaker
[3106.119s] year um that would be
[3111.079s] 2026 yish consumer sentiment picking
[3114.119s] back up consumer expectations picking up
[3116.599s] inflation expectations going
[3118.68s] down China unveils $ 1.4 trillion debt
[3122.079s] swap program to ease local government
[3123.839s] pain holds fire on broader stimulus so
[3126.319s] they&#39;re just waiting to see what Trump&#39;s
[3127.599s] going to do but that is huge that&#39;s
[3130.119s] working in the background getting no

[3282.92s] uh on this podcast many times but it was
[3286.0s] nice to see and it actually
[3288.839s] confirms uh this right here these two
[3292.079s] red bars it had been coming in from the
[3293.839s] base which we covered earlier uh and
[3296.44s] then there was another monthly week bar
[3299.559s] so that would imply December is also
[3301.48s] weak if it&#39;s going to exactly match
[3303.24s] which it never does I think we could
[3305.16s] recover quicker but let&#39;s just say we
[3307.92s] don&#39;t one more month of weakness and
[3310.359s] then you get the final parabolic uh
[3313.119s] initial parabolic move that we&#39;ve all
[3314.839s] been waiting for and then once it hits
[3317.72s] 200 everyone will want it you know we&#39;ll
[3320.52s] be laying off some and then reloading
[3323.119s] down here for the final move so uh we
[3326.72s] covered the home sales picking up you
[3329.44s] don&#39;t never see those
[3332.839s] headlines percentage of domestic
[3335.079s] respondents reporting stronger demand
[3336.96s] for mortgage loans even at all-time
[3339.4s] highs by the way in rates uh or or
[3342.44s] longtime highs in rates it just shows
[3345.4s] the demographic demand of the
[3347.319s] Millennials uh they just got to get a
[3349.16s] house they got to get started and I I
[3351.4s] heard someone say on TV the other day
[3354.16s] marry the house
[3357.92s] and date the rate so you know get in you
[3361.0s] could always refinance lower uh consumer
[3363.64s] confidence and retail sales volumes
[3365.2s] going up Japanese 5-year government bond
[3367.799s] yield going up that currency is going to
[3369.559s] strengthen it&#39;s going to hurt Japanese
[3371.72s] equities and uh prime age population I
[3374.68s] mean it doesn&#39;t get any worse than the
[3376.039s] Japanese
[3377.16s] demographics this is an interesting
[3379.72s] chart has posted somewhere on
[3382.559s] Twitter a while back and it shows a
[3386.92s] pattern ideal buy for investor it&#39;s what
[3389.96s] they call stage one putting the base
[3392.4s] stage two when it breaks out um of quite
[3395.92s] a few of the stocks that we talked about
[3398.0s] are in this phase here where they&#39;re
[3400.2s] just starting to break out whether it&#39;s
[3401.76s] Baba whether it&#39;s biotech whether it&#39;s
[3405.52s] uh PayPal whether it&#39;s uh soon Etsy will
[3409.28s] look like this very soon uh and over and
[3412.2s] over and over so there are just tons of
[3414.24s] these and this is Phase 2 which is the
[3415.92s] beginning of the parabolic moves uh
[3418.68s] Cooper standard looks a lot like this
[3420.92s] actually uh and then uh probabilities of
[3424.2s] a Fed cut where coin flip yesterday went
[3427.079s] up to 80% this morning let me see what
[3429.64s] it was after he
[3433.24s] spoke probably went back to a coin flip
[3442.799s] again yep just about went back back down
[3445.88s] to 60% after he spoke we&#39;re in no rush
[3448.839s] 10cent beats estimates with 47% profit
[3451.76s] jump driven by video
[3454.0s] gaming China Cuts taxes on home
[3456.599s] purchases and fiscal policy support
[3459.72s] China Taps golden Bankers for feedback
[3462.0s] to lift Market confidence so they&#39;re not
[3463.72s] doing this stuff because they&#39;re not
[3464.92s] interested in stock markets they are
[3466.92s] they just you know overdid it and uh it
[3469.68s] always takes them two years to recover
[3473.319s] it this time&#39;s been no difference and
[3475.72s] now now now we&#39;re at the point with the
[3477.559s] election and everything else the
[3478.96s] question is does it take us six more
[3481.44s] weeks until we get our parabolic move or
[3483.24s] do we get it in six more days and the
[3484.92s] answer is it really doesn&#39;t matter at
[3486.52s] this point yard Denny sees uh S&amp;P at
[3489.88s] 10,000 that&#39;s a big headline very smart
[3492.16s] marketing move other than the fact that
[3493.68s] if you do the math it&#39;s less than 10% a
[3495.599s] year return I think he&#39;s being very
[3497.96s] conservative uh kashari says economy
[3501.2s] strong but inflation not
[3503.0s] vanquished trust me you don&#39;t want
[3504.799s] inflation vanquished it&#39;s called
[3506.76s] deflation and uh very hard to get out of
[3509.16s] what you need to know about China&#39;s $1.4
[3511.039s] trillion debt package we covered Roaring
[3513.559s] 20s on Wall Street could extend into the
[3515.24s] 2030s after likely Republican sweep
[3517.64s] Market veteran says uh agreed we&#39;ve been
[3520.839s] saying that for a while EU bendz needed
[3523.039s] Trump we could buy more American
[3525.16s] LNG uh good for com stock China and
[3527.88s] veils we covered that uh Mark with
[3531.119s] Donald Trump in power the dollar is
[3532.559s] likely to Rally but then
[3534.2s] weaken this is very important and I
[3536.92s] apologize for not covering it early
[3538.52s] because I have it written down in my
[3540.599s] notes the one chart that we forgot to
[3542.92s] cover how did it respond with King
[3546.039s] tariff King
[3548.16s] Dollar is here was the election dollar
[3552.4s] was a little weak into the election
[3554.319s] rallied like nobody&#39;s business from 95
[3556.839s] to 103 into the inauguration and then
[3558.96s] what happened the dollar absolutely
[3561.48s] collapsed the first 9 months of the
[3563.16s] Trump presidency so let&#39;s take a look at
[3566.92s] what we have
[3570.76s] here dollar was weak into the
[3575.64s] election ripped higher after the
[3579.039s] election so it probably keeps going a
[3581.28s] little strong strength
[3584.92s] into the inauguration and then complete
[3588.039s] collapse back to New lows below even
[3590.48s] early March which would
[3594.52s] imply we get back back well below 99
[3597.599s] once again after the inauguration what
[3600.16s] about
[3601.92s] bonds
[3603.559s] well Trump&#39;s gonna have no revenue from
[3607.559s] taxes and he&#39;s going to spend like a
[3609.799s] drunken sailor so therefore short bonds
[3612.96s] everyone&#39;s saying all the smart people
[3614.48s] are saying except for the fact that the
[3617.92s] same thing happened last time and you
[3622.28s] got weakness that continued into
[3625.079s] December and then you got a rally for
[3626.599s] the next year in bonds which is a
[3628.4s] compression of yields weakness into the
[3631.4s] election and
[3634.559s] then we will see a rally and a
[3637.68s] compression in
[3638.92s] yields uh over the next 12
[3647.039s] months
[3651.64s] okay 10cent beat with a 47% profit jump
[3659.079s] so this is full hearty right here dollar
[3661.96s] will continue shortterm and then roll
[3664.039s] over City Group Frasier says it&#39;s game
[3666.559s] on for deals in the US we agree Disney
[3669.28s] explored wider field of candidates to
[3671.52s] succeed Iger uh Trump chooses Elon Musk
[3674.76s] and Vivic ramaswami to lead government
[3676.96s] efficiency effort so while everyone
[3681.76s] is concerned about runaway spending and
[3685.64s] big deficits these guys think they can
[3687.72s] cut two trillion even if they&#39;re half
[3690.16s] right and they cut one trillion uh
[3693.039s] that&#39;s going to be very very
[3694.799s] constructive for the US balance sheet
[3697.28s] for sure and deficits Trump is the most
[3700.28s] Pro Stock Market president that
[3701.72s] America&#39;s ever had that&#39;s from Jeremy
[3703.76s] seagull over at
[3706.68s] Wharton Disney&#39;s earnings Outlook Rises
[3709.359s] as streaming unit post
[3711.64s] gains so as we said um they&#39;ve got the
[3716.44s] new cruises coming out uh the movies
[3720.0s] actually crushed it Deadpool and
[3722.68s] Wolverine they added 4.4 million new
[3725.52s] core Disney plus subscribers in a
[3728.16s] quarter which was uh compared to
[3730.64s] estimates of 900,000 and don&#39;t forget
[3733.079s] they the prices they&#39;ve been raising
[3735.119s] like it&#39;s going out of
[3736.799s] style um blockbuster movies so the game
[3739.92s] continues that game is just getting
[3741.64s] started stocks end lower after Powell
[3744.359s] throws cold water on hopes for December
[3746.279s] interest rate
[3747.96s] cut uh coin flip but my guess would be
[3752.48s] he does a cut in
[3755.359s] December and then he waits for a
[3758.279s] while and if he gets to even if he waits
[3761.96s] beforehand I mean if we have a 450 or
[3765.039s] four terminal rate he can spread that
[3767.4s] out over 12 months so three more Cuts
[3769.88s] over 12 months is plenty and we&#39;re there
[3772.64s] Alibaba JD claim big win in singles day
[3775.279s] as sales consumer spending bounces
[3777.559s] back uh Advanced Auto Parts to exit
[3780.0s] Western us as it closes more than 700
[3782.16s] locations we&#39;ll focus on the strongest
[3784.319s] markets in the eastern part of the
[3785.72s] country and this has to do with the
[3787.68s] supply chain this chart is blew my mind
[3792.039s] okay if you look at
[3794.68s] how spread out this
[3797.88s] is and basically they&#39;re getting out of
[3800.24s] California they&#39;re getting out of all
[3802.119s] the West Coast where uh you incentivized
[3805.319s] to steal products and not go to jail uh
[3809.4s] so they&#39;re just going to cut bait there
[3811.48s] and then you&#39;re going to see where
[3812.48s] they&#39;re going to keep all this
[3813.52s] incredible concentration on the east
[3815.2s] coast and just create a money minting
[3818.48s] cash flow machine with a healthy balance
[3821.079s] sheet and that&#39;s why you saw the stock
[3822.44s] up today and that&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing
[3824.16s] the beginning of the recovery never bet
[3825.76s] against Shane o Kelly and uh and we&#39;re
[3828.4s] just getting started there so very
[3829.799s] excited to see that turn around
[3831.559s] everything he said he was going to do
[3832.68s] out of the gate he&#39;s been doing step by
[3834.64s] step periodically and doing a good job
[3837.079s] at that in a uh weaker lower-end
[3841.96s] consumer environment that will is
[3844.64s] showing signs of recovery and I think
[3846.64s] we&#39;re going to see it in the holiday
[3847.799s] season inflation stays firm but not
[3849.799s] enough to derail December cut that was
[3852.0s] from the FED Whisperer before Powell
[3854.0s] spoke today so we&#39;ll see if that gets
[3856.079s] updated billionaire Tillman fertita is
[3858.039s] unhappy with wi Resorts performance uh
[3861.0s] we&#39;ve been looking at win a
[3863.119s] lot um we didn&#39;t get involved because
[3865.72s] it&#39;s another play on China we&#39;ve got
[3867.079s] enough exposure to China but I think
[3868.64s] that&#39;s going to be a big win for those
[3870.72s] of you who don&#39;t have China exposure uh
[3872.68s] Donald Trump secures control of Congress
[3874.68s] as Republicans win House
[3877.319s] Majority uh JD reported in the earnings
[3880.4s] call he said as overall consumer
[3882.079s] sentiment continued to
[3885.119s] brighten Revenue was up
[3887.76s] 5% net income up
[3890.319s] 23% EPS up 29%
[3896.119s] company repurchased 8% of their shares
[3898.4s] announced uh uh to purchase five billion
[3900.72s] more worth of their shares so the game
[3902.72s] continues cement sentiment will
[3904.76s] follow this is Baxter&#39;s earnings couple
[3908.0s] of you asked the key here is that the
[3911.72s] restructuring is going according to plan
[3913.599s] balance sheet Del leverage from the uh
[3916.0s] sale of the biofarma business will go as
[3918.52s] planned and the name of the game with
[3921.799s] these turnarounds is that the balance
[3923.599s] sheet gets deleveraged and revenues keep
[3925.4s] going growing and that&#39;s exactly what
[3927.24s] happened in the third quarter and
[3928.72s] year-to date despite all the headwinds
[3931.0s] they grew revenues 4% uh and Year to in
[3934.52s] the quarter they grew at
[3936.0s] 3% and
[3939.44s] um increased earnings per
[3942.48s] share and they&#39;ve got their plan in
[3944.599s] place to re accelerate margins so you
[3947.0s] can see segment by segment how they grew
[3950.799s] infusion therapies plus 7% Advanced
[3953.16s] Surgery plus 7%
[3955.88s] car and
[3956.96s] connectivity up 7% so the injectables in
[3959.839s] the anesthesia was down uh that was the
[3962.119s] big loss 9% drug compounding up
[3965.559s] 17% so everything was basically up the
[3968.2s] whole revenues were up so the turnaround
[3970.079s] is in place the balance sheet is getting
[3971.799s] healthy this one just takes a little bit
[3973.599s] of patience but you know some go faster
[3975.76s] some go slower here&#39;s one that&#39;s gone
[3977.559s] faster this thing is unbelievable you
[3979.68s] couldn&#39;t give it away at $90 gen now
[3981.96s] it&#39;s at 196 going to 200 uh with um
[3986.88s] residential product sales we&#39;re up
[3989.68s] 28% uh unbelievable commercial uh is
[3994.079s] still in its recovery
[3996.279s] stages and maybe we&#39;ll do this one or
[3999.16s] two of these uh next week and then Etsy
[4002.039s] we talked about a few weeks ago we got a
[4003.76s] $49 basis we went into some
[4006.72s] detailed uh analysis of this the name of
[4009.119s] the game
[4010.319s] is is they picked up like 50 million
[4012.88s] people during covid uh massive growth
[4016.359s] story it got up to
[4018.559s] $300 the key thing here is unlike most
[4022.88s] of these retailers that shot up during
[4025.16s] covid on no profits and no uh just
[4028.96s] Revenue growth because everyone was at
[4030.4s] home with with checks to
[4033.599s] spend most of them collapsed and went
[4035.76s] out of
[4036.799s] business bunch of them in the UK like
[4039.079s] farfetch and everything else I think
[4041.16s] Asos will be left standing as as the
[4043.52s] competitors go out of business but uh
[4045.76s] Etsy was able to hang on to all of those
[4048.16s] clients and all that cash flow and even
[4050.24s] continue to grow revenues how do you
[4052.24s] grow revenues after you have a period
[4054.52s] like that um and they&#39;ve been able to do
[4057.44s] it and now they&#39;re going to re
[4058.799s] accelerate
[4060.0s] so we&#39;re about an hour and five minutes
[4062.799s] in you could go to hedge fund tips.com I
[4066.48s] want you to read all this because it&#39;s a
[4068.0s] very exciting story and the reason the
[4070.64s] stock is
[4072.039s] down almost 90% where we&#39;re buying it
[4076.039s] 85% that tends to be our sweet spot we
[4078.279s] like to buy quality businesses down 85%
[4081.119s] when their cash flow is steady uh and
[4084.44s] revenues are still growing it&#39;s
[4087.24s] mindboggling
[4088.839s] uh you know Wall Street is the only
[4091.0s] place when they hold a clearance sale no
[4092.799s] one shows up and and that&#39;s that&#39;s our
[4094.64s] knitting turn around Tom for a reason uh
[4097.679s] Etsy also tends to do well during the
[4099.319s] gift season and I think they&#39;re going to
[4101.4s] do it much better than anticipated but
[4103.839s] the key thing here is not only have they
[4105.96s] been able to keep the cash flow but
[4107.56s] they&#39;ve been able to bring down the
[4108.679s] share count from 127 million shares down
[4111.08s] to 110 that&#39;s going to go down to 100
[4113.799s] revenues have continued to grow I mean
[4116.56s] who can pull this off in that
[4119.0s] environment and their return on Capital
[4121.199s] they continue to have very high digit
[4123.279s] double digit it&#39;s a capital light
[4126.12s] business double digit return on Capital
[4128.199s] in the 20s
[4130.08s] plus good seasonality and a plan and a
[4133.52s] differentiator while all these other
[4135.0s] retail are RAC to bottom selling crap at
[4138.239s] uh rock bottom
[4139.56s] prices um Etsy is unique in that it has
[4142.92s] creators 96 million users across of its
[4145.719s] platform which makes it the number three
[4147.56s] in the total e-commerce business and um
[4151.92s] huge International growth opportunity
[4153.839s] huge male growth opportunity and gifting
[4157.759s] opportunity so uh it&#39;s exciting and 9
[4160.56s] million active
[4162.359s] sellers return on invested capitals are
[4165.0s] huge
[4166.159s] in this business and this is the type of
[4167.839s] business that you want so uh I think
[4172.839s] the they will continue to grow the
[4175.52s] international they&#39;ll continue to grow
[4177.159s] the men&#39;s they&#39;ll continue to re
[4178.44s] accelerate now they&#39;ve got the app
[4180.319s] they&#39;ve got the frequency of the buyer
[4181.92s] going everything is in place to deliver
[4184.359s] and this CEO is a a winner if you look
[4186.56s] at his bio you&#39;ll see all the things
[4187.92s] that he&#39;s accomplished before this uh
[4190.759s] and uh and you&#39;ll be impressed
[4193.279s] so just want to see if there cou
[4196.88s] couple key things
[4203.84s] here so just go through that everywhere
[4206.239s] I put stars and underlines you want to
[4208.239s] follow that Bank of America sentiment
[4210.199s] survey was out we put it out on Tuesday
[4213.0s] while you&#39;re at hedge fund tips click on
[4214.64s] terms this is opinion not
[4217.44s] advice so uh five key points number one
[4221.159s] it&#39;s a positive not a negative that
[4223.88s] managers
[4225.52s] think CPI will be higher next year than
[4227.56s] this year it is the same at each cycle
[4229.44s] trough that precedes a growth recovery
[4231.56s] whether it&#39;s 2009 or 2001 Etc that&#39;s
[4235.56s] what you see every single time um
[4238.8s] sentiment is improving but not yet
[4240.96s] euphoric that&#39;s what you see again out
[4242.92s] of these big troughs that&#39;s not a top
[4245.6s] that&#39;s that&#39;s headed towards a a rally
[4248.84s] uh and then managers are dramatically
[4250.679s] underweight materials and energy I
[4253.08s] definitely like
[4255.64s] some of the material Story the energy
[4259.12s] you know couple more months and uh I
[4262.199s] think if they&#39;re at excessive valuations
[4265.44s] I&#39;d be lightening up long gold is
[4267.52s] getting very crowded is the second most
[4269.12s] crowded trade and uh managers
[4277.159s] are the most overweight gold that they
[4280.0s] were in
[4282.36s] 2011 when was the last top was in place
[4285.36s] place and that lasted for uh nine more
[4288.48s] years to make a new
[4289.92s] high managers starting to get out of
[4293.36s] equities in Japan which we&#39;ve been
[4296.04s] talking about for months sentiment again
[4298.639s] it&#39;s elevated but it&#39;s not yet euphoric
[4300.56s] I think it&#39;s down to 63 today on the
[4302.159s] fear and greed and even the National
[4304.4s] Association of active investment
[4305.88s] managers is stuck in the 90s which is
[4307.679s] high but not
[4310.0s] extreme earnings oil and gas equipment
[4313.36s] Services down 20 20% uh in the last 60
[4317.48s] days so again I&#39;d be fading this rally
[4320.48s] in the next couple of months Arc
[4322.08s] Innovation on the other hand is up top
[4326.679s] 30 weights in the last 60 days earnings
[4328.639s] estimates for 2025 up 6% this one&#39;s
[4331.96s] probably going to work she&#39;s probably
[4333.08s] going to start to be back on the cover
[4334.36s] of magazines so uh you know kudos for
[4337.8s] her hanging in there moving
[4341.239s] along economic data CPI and PPI came in
[4344.719s] line
[4346.32s] let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on with
[4347.679s] employment continuing claims moved up
[4350.719s] again so that could be enough cover for
[4352.8s] the FED to follow through in December we
[4354.96s] shall
[4357.12s] see
[4359.639s] and going to see some retail sales
[4361.88s] tomorrow all right and now we are on to
[4364.88s] the ask me anything question so for
[4367.04s] those of you who like the ask me
[4368.88s] anything stick around for those of you
[4371.04s] who don&#39;t thank you for joining us we&#39;ll
[4372.88s] be back next week and hopefully much
[4375.8s] shorter next week but we&#39;ll
[4378.92s] see um will says can you help me
[4382.08s] understand when you say the US debt is
[4383.48s] going to be inflated away with inflation
[4385.159s] being three plus percent uh I don&#39;t
[4387.44s] think there&#39;s anything to add there will
[4388.84s] it&#39;s exactly what I said it&#39;s the same
[4390.4s] Playbook that they did in 1948 to 1956
[4395.679s] you can look at debt to GDP dropped from
[4398.28s] 120 to 53% look at inflation across that
[4401.32s] period it was consistently three to four
[4403.6s] to 5% per year and uh that was a good
[4406.52s] playback to bring the rates down the
[4409.28s] debt as a percentage GDP because if you
[4411.239s] grow nominal GDP debt stays
[4414.52s] fixed and
[4416.8s] uh and that&#39;s how that Ratio or nominal
[4420.639s] GDP grows much faster than the fixed
[4424.04s] debt uh on a ratio basis and that&#39;s how
[4427.08s] that ratio comes down so they won&#39;t run
[4429.44s] nominal growth super duper hot and
[4431.76s] that&#39;s you know if I&#39;ve never seen a set
[4434.4s] of policies an Administration that could
[4437.56s] be in place to run nominal GDP hotter
[4440.08s] than we&#39;ve ever said it would not Shock
[4442.08s] me to see years of GDP growth above five
[4446.32s] six 7 8% over the next four years I mean
[4449.719s] that sounds like crazy town I&#39;m telling
[4452.04s] you I think we&#39;re going to see at least
[4453.36s] one or two years like that which is
[4455.12s] going to be amazing so hey Tom thanks
[4458.32s] for all the information you provide
[4459.4s] every week any thoughts on backs backs
[4461.639s] we just covered Aaron L Huntington
[4472.04s] inals think that&#39;s
[4475.04s] hii okay let&#39;s take a
[4487.84s] look Cas is dropping a lot
[4500.32s] gross margins dropping return on capital
[4502.679s] is dropping not for me everything&#39;s
[4504.44s] going in the wrong direction for now I
[4506.4s] need to see some signs of recovery
[4507.96s] before I got interested in that Lars
[4510.6s] Lund care to look at gem genmab from
[4515.36s] Denmark uh let&#39;s take a look
[4529.44s] gross margins are moving down quite a
[4532.48s] bit I want to understand why that is
[4535.8s] that&#39;s a red flag
[4558.48s] what do they
[4559.76s] do uh Therapeutics yeah this I have no
[4562.84s] Edge on individual drugs and all that
[4565.36s] stuff I just buy a basket of xbi so I
[4567.52s] have I have no value ad there uh
[4570.76s] interview
[4571.92s] request Michael
[4575.04s] go selones
[4590.159s] yeah Specialty Chemicals I definitely
[4591.76s] want to get involved in more of
[4598.239s] these in the material
[4601.719s] space let&#39;s see what this one looks like
[4615.4s] yeah these are so cyclical that it&#39;s
[4617.719s] hard to analyze it as a good business
[4619.88s] it&#39;s more like a it&#39;s like a two-year
[4623.84s] trade
[4629.239s] um this one&#39;s really interesting I
[4634.32s] mean have to take a closer look
[4640.239s] but you know you&#39;re definitely catching
[4642.32s] a falling knife so you know it could go
[4644.32s] to
[4645.679s] 50 before it goes back to 170 but
[4650.4s] um as long as you&#39;re not on margin it&#39;s
[4652.679s] not a big deal this is a quality
[4654.36s] business though over time what is we
[4657.4s] what do they do here engineered
[4660.32s] [Music]
[4665.76s] polymers automotive and medical
[4667.76s] applications Industrial Products
[4669.28s] consumer
[4670.159s] electronics yeah I like this
[4675.159s] uh let&#39;s see what the balance sheet
[4676.639s] looks
[4687.44s] like but are they generative polymers
[4690.96s] that&#39;s the question are they large
[4693.48s] language polymers I don&#39;t know let&#39;s
[4696.76s] see
[4698.76s] uh all right so revenues are down a
[4701.239s] little bit
[4706.56s] share count is coming down so they&#39;re
[4708.639s] buying in
[4710.12s] stock cash flow I got make this a little
[4717.719s] smaller that&#39;s not what I
[4721.44s] wanted that&#39;s what I
[4728.639s] wanted yeah it&#39;s holding in there what&#39;s
[4730.96s] the balance sheet look like
[4734.88s] this is probably the
[4736.92s] risk $ 11 billion of
[4740.92s] debt with $ 800 million of
[4747.239s] cash
[4758.92s] uh got enough free cash flow you just
[4761.48s] got to check when does all of the debt
[4764.4s] mature
[4765.88s] sure and if you can get comfortable with
[4770.88s] solvency I think
[4773.239s] that this is probably okay and is in
[4776.56s] just in a cyclical
[4778.28s] trough and I think it&#39;s a reasonable
[4780.48s] find to start to do work
[4783.48s] on good job Mike J apt Ulta beauty uh we
[4788.88s] cover this one every week I think it&#39;s
[4792.84s] fine I know Buffett&#39;s sold some of his
[4796.96s] position
[4802.0s] but I think it&#39;s okay but I think there
[4804.44s] are better uses of money which I never
[4806.04s] why I never got excited about
[4808.36s] it John C Dollar
[4812.92s] Tree uh these are the type of businesses
[4817.48s] though the retailers are gonna get hit
[4822.239s] I on the tariffs but
[4825.32s] um Dollar Tree is already so far down
[4828.679s] and same with Dollar
[4831.48s] General I think I want to get involved
[4833.96s] with one of
[4849.36s] these it it it it&#39;s just going to take a
[4852.04s] little while I mean it&#39;s had a heart
[4854.92s] attack but I think it&#39;s going to be okay
[4857.639s] I I just think that your upside is
[4860.96s] limited
[4862.48s] so you basically have a double over
[4865.04s] three years and it could go 30% against
[4868.159s] you before you get the double from these
[4870.199s] levels uh is what what it comes down to
[4872.56s] they&#39;ll close unprofitable stores it&#39;ll
[4874.36s] be the same thing they all overexpanded
[4878.159s] um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of like
[4882.199s] the Advanced Auto story with less upside
[4886.08s] that&#39;s the way I would put it so for me
[4889.36s] it would be basically the same trade and
[4891.28s] I don&#39;t overlap then you&#39;re just running
[4893.96s] you know an index fund so you got to
[4896.719s] pick your bets I think Dollar Tree is
[4899.44s] probably a little higher quality than
[4901.32s] Dollar
[4903.12s] General
[4909.719s] um still generating cash
[4915.52s] I think you&#39;re Pro I think you&#39;re
[4916.8s] probably okay with this one but you got
[4918.76s] to do the work on it now John so uh but
[4921.639s] definit uh hard yellow light to start
[4924.28s] the work are you adding to Alibaba
[4927.679s] before earnings I would never add or
[4930.08s] subtract before earnings I I don&#39;t own
[4932.719s] for an earnings call I own because I
[4935.52s] have enough margin of safety at the
[4937.239s] price I&#39;m paying for the business and I
[4939.52s] sell it when I&#39;m getting quoted in the
[4942.6s] market for far more then I believe the
[4945.199s] intrinsic value of the business is worth
[4947.44s] uh and we are nowhere near that point so
[4949.4s] we reloaded all the options that we took
[4951.56s] profits on in early October when it was
[4953.239s] at
[4954.36s] $117 and um we&#39;ll probably potentially
[4958.4s] have a chance to H top up a few more in
[4961.32s] coming weeks but um I think the window&#39;s
[4963.76s] going to close uh pretty quickly so um
[4969.08s] am I comfortable with the position I
[4970.32s] have I couldn&#39;t be more comfortable I
[4971.679s] just you know uh every new new money
[4975.36s] that came in gets an allocation of of
[4977.28s] Baba even at these levels it&#39;s uh it&#39;s
[4979.96s] it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s one of price is what you
[4981.639s] pay value is what you going to get there
[4983.719s] is no uh better value in the global
[4987.84s] market for my opinion where you have
[4989.88s] your downside totally protected with the
[4991.88s] cash net cash that they have on the
[4993.28s] balance sheet growth prospects
[4995.159s] everything else optionality outs all the
[4998.48s] all the good stuff is in place are you
[5000.48s] adding okay same question
[5005.4s] Tim D thoughts on solar we covered
[5007.56s] earlier looking haven&#39;t found but
[5010.28s] looking hard uh have you looked at
[5014.76s] Airbnb yeah and I think we covered that
[5017.199s] a few weeks ago I think it&#39;s
[5032.32s] okay I just think there are better uses
[5034.44s] is of
[5035.679s] money but I think it&#39;s I think it&#39;s
[5039.52s] okay let me just
[5055.4s] see seven times sales 47 times
[5059.8s] earnings so if you&#39;re going to pay 10
[5062.08s] times you know 47 times earnings and 10
[5064.52s] time sales the key is going to be what&#39;s
[5066.239s] the growth rate
[5096.96s] so 10% next year and 16% in the year
[5101.199s] after to pay 47 times that you know for
[5103.56s] me it&#39;s not enough margin of safety so
[5106.159s] I&#39;m a pass that&#39;s a trade that&#39;s a
[5107.96s] trading
[5109.159s] vehicle thoughts on
[5111.28s] hbi yeah it&#39;s just a low quality
[5113.48s] business I said it would work as a trade
[5115.48s] it probably already is let&#39;s
[5118.119s] see yeah so this will push a little
[5120.6s] higher I it&#39;s not something that I want
[5123.44s] to get totally excited exced about
[5124.92s] because this thing just keeps running
[5126.28s] back down to
[5127.48s] nothing
[5129.48s] um not a good business Shia
[5134.44s] Rees Elliot announced a steak in
[5139.639s] Honeywell is it interesting for me yeah
[5142.199s] anything Elliott does is interesting for
[5143.719s] me honey honey well uh I&#39;d rather have
[5146.6s] Boeing I think there&#39;s way more upside
[5148.28s] for Boeing this has already had a huge
[5150.199s] run I I I like I like Boeing so he&#39;s
[5152.84s] going to break up do some of the parts
[5154.639s] basically he&#39;s going to just get a
[5155.8s] payoff to go away and that doesn&#39;t help
[5158.159s] me it helps
[5159.44s] him
[5163.36s] um what are your thoughts on Burkshire
[5165.36s] being in lots of cash uh the last time
[5168.36s] he was in this much cash the market
[5170.28s] rallied there thereafter relative to
[5172.88s] equity so there&#39;s no real tell in that I
[5174.96s] think the guy wants to go out like
[5176.32s] Seinfeld and the last thing he wants is
[5179.76s] I think he was preparing for a different
[5181.119s] outcome in the election and um
[5185.119s] and he thought he was going to be able
[5186.08s] to deploy a lot of that cash but what
[5187.96s] you don&#39;t want is to be 94 your stock
[5190.52s] goes down 50% after a lifetime of uh
[5193.52s] pristine reputation and you go out down
[5196.48s] 50% so I think this guy is more
[5198.84s] preserving Legacy than looking for
[5200.92s] upside at this point and um and you know
[5205.4s] he&#39;s probably not
[5206.96s] finding everything was I think you
[5209.08s] should probably take a hundred billion
[5210.4s] and buy Boeing but uh that&#39;s just
[5213.239s] me he should have done the same thing
[5215.199s] with GE Kyle Burns can you please take a
[5218.28s] look at Herbal Life uh no acmen publicly
[5221.44s] shortage seems undervalued at the
[5222.719s] current price I think it&#39;s a great
[5224.28s] business the problem is is that
[5231.679s] um and I have looked at this one a lot
[5235.52s] um until you
[5238.44s] see side effects being reported from the
[5241.239s] gp1s
[5244.48s] it&#39;s
[5245.8s] problematic um I think they&#39;ll continue
[5248.88s] they have the China recovery play
[5252.04s] here for sure their India market is is
[5256.28s] flying they&#39;ve got a great product but
[5259.159s] it is you know as much as it&#39;s a
[5260.76s] nutrition company it&#39;s always been
[5262.52s] marketed as a weight loss supplement
[5264.639s] company and uh in the developed Market
[5267.48s] there&#39;s just
[5269.96s] no
[5272.6s] real momentum I think the people that I
[5276.48s] think as the prices come down for these
[5278.4s] gp1s if they continue to prove
[5281.719s] efficacious for the long term and safe
[5283.76s] for the long term yes people will need
[5286.08s] protein shakes and herbal could be a
[5287.679s] beneficiary of this but it&#39;s a much
[5289.639s] different
[5290.88s] story
[5292.44s] um to sell if you if if it&#39;s not being
[5295.96s] used for the weight loss and if it&#39;s
[5298.04s] just being used for nutrition and
[5299.76s] protein so this would be the buy of all
[5303.4s] buys
[5304.92s] if and when you start to see headlines
[5307.32s] about
[5308.719s] either Insurance not covering it or side
[5312.44s] effects if you start to see side effects
[5314.159s] this thing&#39;s going to
[5315.4s] quadruple uh but there&#39;s no sign of it
[5318.52s] and you know diabetic people have been
[5321.04s] taking glp 1es for
[5323.08s] decades
[5326.639s] so until you see people using it for
[5329.48s] weight loss start to report stuff about
[5331.32s] kidneys or livers which may never happen
[5333.4s] because of the drugs been around for so
[5335.4s] long used for different uses I think the
[5338.4s] grow story is going to be very very hard
[5340.56s] other than a recovery in
[5343.84s] China for nutrition and I think they
[5347.28s] have some skin care products Etc uh
[5350.119s] could be very very strong but uh you
[5352.679s] know you&#39;re seeing the same with the
[5353.679s] Medifast and the usas and the new skin
[5356.04s] they&#39;re all super
[5357.6s] cheap um new skin is more skincare and
[5360.719s] vitamins so they&#39;ll actually recover
[5362.32s] better when China recovers
[5364.96s] because they&#39;re not weight loss Centric
[5368.32s] um I guess the simple answer is it&#39;s a
[5371.28s] great business but with the glp1
[5375.119s] overhang until something
[5377.8s] changes uh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best
[5381.719s] highest and best use of capital and I&#39;ll
[5383.28s] leave it at that moving along but I
[5387.159s] definitely objectively see what you&#39;re
[5389.04s] looking at there and I think that&#39;s
[5390.88s] that&#39;s where it is uh James thoughts on
[5393.28s] goose no no change we own it and uh
[5396.0s] that&#39;s a China recovery play like
[5398.44s] Baba and uh that&#39;ll be fine thank you
[5401.679s] for everything you do Z car giv the new
[5406.76s] CEO zc
[5426.04s] no not
[5427.88s] interested
[5429.92s] next Matt
[5432.88s] tumau
[5436.28s] ack been watching for a year thanks uh
[5439.159s] glad you&#39;re enjoying it
[5441.119s] Matt a r
[5444.679s] ooc
[5447.44s] archrock I think you missed it uh was
[5450.719s] more interesting at 150 than it is at 24
[5453.4s] let&#39;s just
[5454.52s] see what&#39;s going on
[5462.239s] here all right so the cash flow
[5464.32s] recovered they stock priced it
[5465.95s] [Music]
[5468.44s] in what do they
[5475.32s] do energy
[5477.639s] infrastructure yeah I think this is one
[5479.44s] to short after the
[5481.36s] inauguration Energy Services Martin C
[5485.84s] greetings from
[5489.0s] Poland ncsm
[5537.159s] guarantee we&#39;re going to see an
[5538.8s] unbelievable increase of share count
[5550.6s] uh not huge from 1.7 million up to 2.5
[5554.199s] million
[5565.36s] revenues I mean this is a tiny
[5570.0s] company I don&#39;t know I it might work
[5580.639s] uh what&#39;s the balance sheet look like
[5583.08s] $15 million of
[5591.96s] cash yeah I just want to understand you
[5594.719s] know the key is have they changed who&#39;s
[5597.159s] running it cuz this was a complete
[5600.0s] disaster so if they got new management
[5602.96s] in that has a track record of success
[5604.6s] then this thing&#39;s probably going to
[5605.76s] recover to 50 and Beyond if it&#39;s the
[5607.88s] same schmuck who ran it from $555 down
[5610.48s] to $6 then I would say uh take a hard
[5613.6s] pass because they don&#39;t respect Equity
[5615.639s] but
[5629.52s] um yeah I
[5632.48s] mean I I think you got something there
[5635.28s] you just have to do a lot of work on
[5637.56s] it because these smallish
[5640.88s] companies tend to have mediocre
[5643.56s] management uh Scher Blackman oil field
[5652.28s] equipment under Trump Administration
[5654.639s] yeah until the inauguration and then
[5656.4s] there

[5765.48s] got to figure out
[5769.52s] is remote connectivity
[5778.04s] Solutions so what&#39;s their competition
[5780.679s] and what&#39;s their mode how how can how
[5783.36s] does this not get knocked off what makes
[5786.159s] it special what&#39;s proprietary about it
[5789.28s] and why is it not going to change and if
[5791.48s] you can get comfortable with all those
[5792.84s] questions which are the trick questions
[5794.88s] for technology then uh on a financial
[5798.04s] basis it definitely looks
[5800.76s] okay okay so with that said uh we&#39;ll be
