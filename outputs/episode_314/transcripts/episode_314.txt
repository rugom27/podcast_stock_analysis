Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 314th videocast podcast for the week ending October 23rd, 2025. We got a lot of great stuff to cover today. A lot of data, a lot of great market insights, a lot of good news, but as always, family first. Uh that's a picture of my lovely wife Caitlyn and my beautiful daughter Mimi and me at uh a Halloween party this weekend. I was a cowboy because I'm always a cowboy. They actually dressed up with the theme of Pirates of the Caribbean and had a wonderful time. And then this is Caitlyn and I with Annabelle at her swim meet. As a matter of fact, Annabelle had a great weekend. Fantastic swim meet, winning the mixed 1112, 100yard backstroke in 101.65, beating the boys at 11. She's now tackling longer races. She swam the 200yard backstroke in 213 and the 500yard freestyle in 517, earning the number one national ranking for 11 year olds in both events this season. So, great job there. Then we want to get on to media. I want to thank Payton Jennings and Christian Dagger for having me on with the great Steuart Vanney on Fox Business. We're going to cover this from Friday. Now, solid gain for the Dow. You're up 116 points and the S&P and the Nasdaq are both now in the green. A little bit of green on the board. Tom Hayes joins me now. Is it we there are still some negatives out there. Uh but the positives seem to be outweighing the negatives. So do you think we're off to the races? We're going to have a nice gain towards the end of the year. I do. Stu, in the intermediate term and long term, we are bullish. We are constructive. In the short term, I do think there's a little bit of whistling past the graveyard. Stuart, uh the shutdown is dragging on. The China deal is dragging on. There are signs of credit weakness at the margins. There are some geopolitical risks. But when we step back and burden ourselves with the facts, here's what we find. Since 1950, when you have a 15% correction followed by all-time highs, the secondary correction, which we may get in October, never exceeds 10%, it averages 6.4%. So that little bit of cash we told told you we raised at the beginning of the month. We intend to be putting that to work in coming weeks on any volatility and chop. We still have the MAG 7 earnings coming up which as you know the earnings growth is going to be cut in half from last year from 32% down to 14%. So we may see a little bit of turbulence. Those are buying opportunities before year end. We are constructive into 2026. Even if we get a little bit of chop. I like the sound of that. Tom, I'm sorry to cut it short today, but it's such a big news day. We are cutting it short, but Tom Hayes, you come and see us again next week. Thanks very much, Tom. See you later. Thank you, Stuart. Still ahead, the Supreme Court taking major cases. And we're back. And then I had the pleasure to join the great Stu Vney again on Tuesday. I want to uh thank Payton and Christian and the great Stu Vney. Here we go. Check those futures, please. is the Dow is down eight, S&P up four, Nasdaq down 40 points. Thomas Hayes joins me now. All right, it's earnings season. We've had I don't know exactly how many of the S&P 500 companies have reported, but how are profits doing so far? So far so good, Stu. Uh 12% of the S&P 500s reported. You had 8.5% earnings growth versus 8%. But we've been warning to watch out for the Magnificent 7. And Warren Buffett once said, "The three most important words in investing are margin of safety." And we feel right now at these prices with the Magnificent 7, there is no margin of safety. They're priced for perfection at 30 times earnings with 14% earnings growth this quarter, down from 32% last year at this time. Also, you've got 32% weight in the S&P 500 for the Magnificent 7 with only 23% of the earnings per share. And as we saw with Netflix last night, Stu, Magnificent 7 started with a thud. They missed on the bottom line. They slightly missed on the top line. And their guidance for margins was lower. That's what you want to be watching is the guidance lower. So you're you're raising the anxiety level here because the big big tech reports next week and you're saying the slightest fumble will take big techs down and with it the market goes down. That's really what you're saying, isn't it? I do. I am saying that the S&P 500 has almost become a Magnificent 7 ETF. Uh, I think basically outside the Magnificent 7, you could throw a dart and find a reasonably valued stock, but within the Magnificent 7, they are priced for perfection. And so far, the guidance has not been magnificent. So, you know, if you look at uh Netflix, if your number one show is called K-pop Demon Hunters, it may be time for your stock to take a rest. And that's what we're seeing this morning. It did pretty well, I got to say. All right, Tom Hayes, you got us all worried now, but do come back soon, okay? We'll see you again. Thanks very much, Tom. Thanks so much, dude. How about this? Barack Obama hitting the And we're back. And then this morning, I had the pleasure to join um uh Yahoo Finance. Want to thank Justin Oliver and Brian Sazi for having me on Yahoo Finance. This was a much longer segment with Alli Canal and Inz Fere. Uh really enjoyed this one. Goes into a lot of detail on my outlook. a couple of our holdings. We're going to listen in here. Well, I think everything outside the MAG 7 is doing okay. We've had uh 8 and a half% earnings growth versus 8% expected with uh maybe 15 a little bit more than 15 20% of the S&P reporting. Uh I think the big the big key is going to be next week with the serious MAG7 earnings. You know there Warren Buffett once said the three most important words in investing are margin of safety and with the Magnificent 7 there is no margin of safety. Uh they're trading at 30 times earnings uh despite earnings growth falling in half year from 32% down to 14%. So, so far the themes with Netflix and Tesla have been what have been margin compression and they're not even the biggest spenders in AI. We're going to see the biggest spenders in AI next week. And I think that uh you know, we've raised a little cash and I've been I've been accused by some of your colleagues, Brian, by being a permable and that's been the case and that's been right. But in October, we got cautious and we raised some cash and I think we want to have some cash through next week as we see a lot of spending and a lot of margin contraction in in Mag 7. Tom, to be clear, I never said that. All right. I just want that to be known on the opening bid round table. Let me fire back at you because you bring up a good point. Uh these earnings are squashing estimates by and large. You're seeing a lot of companies like T-Mobile, Hasbro raise their outlooks today. They have not been alone, but profit margins have been under pressure. Tariffs, rising costs, you name it. Margins not for a lot of companies have been down year-over-year. Is the market just too excited by these earnings beats and they need to pay more attention to some of these fundamentals that may not be as strong as these earnings beats look like? Yeah, look, I I think we I think we have to be a little cautious here. In years that the market corrects more than 15%, there's often a secondary correction, particularly after it hits all-time highs. So, we corrected almost 20% in April. Uh we went back to new highs. On average, the secondary correction is 3 to 9%. It averages 6.4%. It would not surprise me in coming weeks to see a little bit more chop and volatility before we finally get the year-end rally. And I think the catalyst, you know, look, we we are whistling by the graveyard a little bit. We got uh no deal with the shutdown so far. We've got no deal with China. We've got some open geopolitical questions and we have a consistent theme of margin contraction with record high multiples. So that's the bad news. The good news is earnings are going to grow meaningfully next year up double digits. But I think in the interim I think people are going to be surprised how much this spending is weighing and you saw uh Facebook or or Meta uh lay off a bunch of people in their AI department. I thought that's where this the growth was supposed to be. Uh fair point. And Nez, let me get over to you because I know our audience is probably saying uh I wish Saji would just shut the hell up about earnings. I want to focus in on Tesla. as you went through this Tesla earnings report and as do you think of Tesla more as a car company or an AI company? It's a very important question we've asked in the past, but I would say now it's more important than ever before. I mean, they're rolling out robots, cars with no steering wheels. This is a fundamental change in the investment thesis in Tesla. Yes. And Elon Musk in his opening remarks also when he talked about Tesla, he really talked about AI basically saying that Tesla is going to bring AI into the real world. So he is looking at Tesla as an AI company and the company is clearly signaling that they are a an AI play that they are going into the humanoid robots and and robo taxis. And so that that's that was the big big big focus during their earnings call. That's what struck me and mean we've seen this shift. But really uh last night you saw it uh even more. Uh this is a what's next stock and it is uh and you see are you're seeing that the stock is under pressure uh perhaps uh because of the uh sort of margin squeeze uh because of the earnings miss uh because of the perhaps the robo taxi that's that the safety drivers aren't in Austin aren't going to be out of those until uh the end of the year. Maybe the progress was expected a little bit faster uh with respect to that, but it's definitely a what's next stock. Uh Ally, I I know I'm supposed to be skeptical of companies and leaders, but I I am getting more excited about these robots. Uh I think there could be some real potential and I think the the Tesla robot, what is it, Optimus? This version three that Elen teased last night, it's far and away the leader in the space. Yeah. And Wall Street strategists that are bullish on this stock would agree with you. I mean, Dan Ives described it as the next era for Tesla. It's all about these robots. It's all about AI, but I agree with the NEZ that it truly is a show me story. What's next? What's coming down the pike? And for Tesla, I mean, what's making money right now or trying to make money is the the car business. We're not seeing profits on the AI side. We're not at the point that we're seeing those returns. So, investors are going to have to be patient. Clearly, given the results that we're seeing this morning, they're not so patient right now. they they want to make sure that the expiration of those EV tax credits that that's not going to uh be a problem moving forward when you have these um more grander ideas with AI and robots especially since we know how difficult it is to make money in that space. So look all these companies right now if you can touch AI if you can incorporate that into your business that's a good thing. We know AI isn't going anywhere anytime soon, but it's a question of how long investors can wait around to see some of those returns. Tom, I know you're you're you're permable. Uh hit me with some picks. I heard you're uh you're showing up on the round table with some picks for us. Yeah. Uh absolutely. One one thing that no one's really been paying attention to because everyone's been very skeptical about small caps. But if you look at small cap performance relative to large caps, it's dramatically outperformed since August of this year. So, while everyone's been focused on Mag 7, what what's actually outperformed uh in the last handful of months is small caps. So, we got two great small caps for you. We've brought on your show uh or on your network uh in the last uh little while, and they continue to go up and they're going to continue to go up. One is a boring business, not uh not trading at 200 times earnings like Tesla or 13 times revenue, actually much more realistic multiples. Uh it's called Cooper Standard. They do the ceiling systems around the doors and windows of automobiles and fluid transfer systems. Uh this stock was down from $146 down to five. Uh when we started buying it in 2022, it's subsequently dropped to 3 a.5. We bought more and uh and now it's at $3536. Uh so six bagger but probably going to triple again from here over the next three years. And why is that? uh when it was $146 it was earning $7.20 on um 17.5 million US sell through they provide to US OEMs like Ford like GM etc. It's a play on the recovery in auto volumes. Uh we think they've taken about you know 400 million of costs out of the business. They're going to earn $10 a share at the top of the next cycle when we get back over 17 million cars. Uh, and uh, depends what multiple you put on it. A 10 times is a $100 stock. If you go back to a 20 times multiple could be a lot higher. We like Cooper Standard. Yeah. And Nez, uh, don't you always I mean, I aren't you amazed how guys like Tom find stocks like this? I got a lot of stocks in my head. I mean, this is what I've been doing for a while. Uh, I've never heard of this company. I I had never either. And And this is this is why we love having Tom on because he brings these stock picks that nobody had ever heard of. But listen, there is a stock for everyone and for everyone's interest. Such Tom go. Floor's yours. I got one more. Canada Goose. It's not Okay, I've heard Canada Goose. I had a couple of their coats, but make your case. It's not just about the thousand parkas anymore. They're doing 365 wear from t-shirts to hats to eyewear to footwear. Uh, and you've seen it very successfully executed in other brands. uh they have record free cash flow and record revenues and yet the stock is still down 80% from its COVID highs. The board recently rejected an offer for $14 a share to buy the company. Thank god they rejected that because they would have stolen all the upside. And these are the type of divergences that we built our career on when fundamentals are improving and the stock is down. Sooner or later in the short term the market is emotional voting machine uh based on emotions. In the long term it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals. This stock price will catch up with the growing fundamentals. And we're back. Uh then I want to thank Kranav Kashop and Twa Dickshit Hi T for including me in their article on Reuters. Uh then quote of the week in investing what is comfortable is rarely profitable. That's from Robert Arnot. I want to thank you guys for sending in new photos. Uh for those of you who are sporting the hedge fund tips merch, we thank you. Again, the merch is uh so we can get the word out. And the reason we've continued to do 314 episodes for over six years, one, we love giving value to the community. And two, uh because you have done an incredible job of sharing it person by person, the number one compliment you can uh pay me is to just share it with one person you care about. And so many great people have come to us through word of mouth. And that happens sometimes when you wear the hat. Uh sometimes when you wear the shirt, people ask you about it and you can share the good news. This is our latest. Uh Joel did not want to send a picture of himself, but he sent a picture of his incredible truck with Hedge Fund Tips mug. Uh let's not get into trucks and books. Let's go for faces. People want to see your beautiful real mug. Uh your your mug shot uh and your face. So we'd love to keep growing the community, keep sharing the word. We keep growing. We keep producing these for you every single week for non-clients and clients alike. Okay. Wanted to, you know, uh I'm known as an optimist because that's it pays 70% of the time to be an optimist in the stock market. You can hear from the last three segments that I'm a little more cautious. We have a little cash, not a ton of cash, but enough cash that we'll be able to pounce if we get some kind of weakness uh in coming weeks. Uh, and if we don't, you know, then we've had such a monster year, there will be very little drag. Um, but I wanted to kind of just go through some of these things because as you we've discussed in recent weeks with uh retail investors buying record calls, you know, 20 million uh contract or 40 million contracts a day for the last basically three consecutive weeks, all call options. um and a lot of just chasing the shiny objects. I want you to understand who is selling to you. So the people buying the indices up after a 30 plus% rebound off the bottom, the people who are uh chasing up who were sellers in the hole and are now buyers at at a short-term exhaustion level. Um, if so many people are buying, who are the sellers? Well, I went through the magnificent 7. And this is not a useful indicator because people buy for only one reason. They think the stock is going up. They sell for a multitude of reasons. One, they could think the stock's going down. Two, they could have to buy a house, fund a college education, part of a a predetermined uh executive sale plan. But what you're going to see here, and I go through the Magnificent 7 just so you have a sense of who is selling to the people buying this, either through the S&P indices, which have basically become a MAG 7 index. Um, 32% of the weight, only 23% of the earnings. Um, and when you kind of figure it out, you're going to say, "They have better information than I do. Why am I buying what they are selling? So, here's Jensen Wong who's basically selling $13 million a day as far as the eye can see. 23rd 13 million. 22nd 13 million. 21st 13 million. 16 Oh, he took off the weekend. That was very nice. 16th 13 million. 17 million. And you could say, "Oh, well, that's a predefined plan." Uh, absolutely. It's a predefined plan. But, you know, he could stop it at any moment in time. And and what you're seeing is he's selling enough that can either be bought back by the company buyback plan or um absorbed by the market without impacting the price. And they've determined that $13 million a day makes sense. And he's done it basically every single day going back months and months and months and months and months all the way to the beginning of the summer when he was only selling in June $7 million a day for a while. Uh, and then he just keeps selling $14 million a day. So, you know, if you think your stock is going to double and triple and quadruple like all the people that are buying calls and uh pitching it on TV and the AI res revolution and all this stuff, uh you might want to hold on to some of that. I mean, um 300 that's, you know, that's uh four five billion dollars a year he's dumping on your head. Um so, you know, you can keep creating liquidity for Jensen Wong. That's fine. Mark Zuckerberg, uh, similar type of situation at Meta in August. He was selling about 10 a day. Nothing like Jensen. Uh, 12 a day every single day, nine a day, 14 a day, 40 a day. Um, and so on, but not nearly as egregious as uh, Nvidia. Sundar Pachai uh, he's been selling uh, you know, 8 million, 8 million, 8 million, 8 million. I mean, these guys are selling like the house is on fire. I mean yeah it's a predetermined plan but why did he increase it from 5 million a day in May to now he's up to 7 million 8 million and so on you are creating that liquidity for him he is taking advantage uh Jeff Bezos same story 345 million a day uh in July uh he did 345 on the 23rd on the 24th he did 609 on the 21st he did almost a billion 973 million So, you know, when you're buying something that's up so much, you have to say, "Who is selling to me?" And what I'm trying to tell you, here's a proposed sale uh this summer of 5 billion 5.4 billion of stock. Another proposed sale um late last year, $3 billion of stock. So, you know, yes, they they they deserve to get some liquidity, etc. Uh but you'll see that it seems to be very accelerated and very concentrated after the stock has gone up a lot. Kimble Musk, Elon can't because he's pitching the shareholders on giving him a trillion dollars if you meet certain benchmarks. But Kimble is saying uh thank you very much and selling you know earlier this year in the spring, $30 million a day, $15 million a day, etc., etc. They get an awful lot of stock as directors, I guess. Um, you know, that's a that's a ton of stock. Reed Hastings over at Netflix, I don't think he was surprised by the 10% drop because in early October he sold 103 million. Uh, in September, he sold another 35 million. Uh, excuse me, 65 million. Uh, in August, he sold another 50 million. Uh, July, same thing. Over and over. He just loves selling $30 million chunks all day long. That wasn't the case earlier uh in 2023 when the stock was lower. Uh he was not a seller. Now he's he's become more and more aggressive as the price has gone up and up. Uh Microsoft, what is uh Satia Nadella doing in September? Selling 75 million a day. September 3rd 75 million. September 4th 32 million. In August he sold 6 million. And uh so you know this is kind of concentrated here. 150 million is a big slug for a guy who didn't found the company. Uh Apple's Tim Cook in October uh sold 66 million again for a guy who didn't find the company. That's an awful lot of stock. Um April he sold another 50 million. He's accelerating. October last year he sold 50. Um so you know he's he's been selling. Alex Karp over at Palanteer, not part of the Mag 7. In August, he sold uh 60 million plus another 88 million, so 140 million while he was making the rounds, you know, very aggressively promoting the stock. Look, I mean, he's got all of these businesses are great businesses, but I, you know, at some point you watch what people do, not what they say. And um I would say their sales while part of plans have not been you know um it's not unusual for for people to sell stock but they've all have one thing in common and that is they've been selling a lot more into strength than they were into weakness and that probably tells you everything you need to know because they have much better information than you do. Um, so if you look at the stocks on a daily basis, everyone says, "Oh, Mag 7's so great. Blah, blah, blah. Goes up every day." Well, Apple hasn't done anything since the beginning of the year. As a matter of fact, it's down to break even year to date. Huge round trip back to nowhere. Amazon, it's actually down on the year. Look at look at this chart here. Uh, Google has actually rose. This was the most hated one. Uh, and that's up about 20% year to date. Uh, the MAG 7 in aggregate 58 to 65, so up about 10% in line with the S&P, actually slightly lower than the S&P. That's the MAG 7 ETF. Um, Meta is down since February, up a little bit since the beginning of the year, been grinding sideways uh for some time. Microsoft is a is a bigger winner up about 20% maybe a little bit less than 20% maybe about 13% from 453 to 520. Um Netflix is basically 1,00 that's basically where it was back in March. Um beginning of the year was 950. It pro it could get back to that. We'll see. It's testing the 200 day. Uh Nvidia has basically been sideways for two years. It was 140 in July uh of well sideways is probably not a fair characterization. It was 153 the beginning of the year. It's 182. So 1617% in that ballpark. Um Palunteer was 125 in February. It's 180. So that's been a Momo stock. We'll see how that continues with all the selling. Tesla is down year to date. Um, uh, we discussed them on the call. So, you just kind of see everyone's looking at it from the bottom, but you know, year-to- date, these things haven't done much. They're consolidating a lot of gains. Let's see how the earnings come in. Um, and we'll take it from there. So, it's it's, you know, it's kind of founded in, you know, I like to burden myself in the fact with the facts, not just have an opinion. Uh, I hope to be proven wrong. uh because we are 90 plus% invested uh and that'll lift up the market without taking a dip before rising before the end of the year. But if it does take a dip, we've got cash to pounce. And if it doesn't uh we're we're fine with that as well uh based on the dramatic outperformance year to date. So inflection point for crude oil. This is an interesting chart from Mlen and he's showing the gold to oil ratio shifted 9.8 8 months forward, crude oil prices have dipped below 60 a barrel in spite of sanctions on Russia and oil and other stresses in energy uh markets. Proponents of drill baby drill are celebrating this price drop as motorists are now enjoying low gasoline prices. But the party is about over. According to the leading indication given by gold prices. This week's chart is one I've shown before and it involves shifting forward the plot of gold prices by 19.8 months to reveal how crude oil prices follow in gold's footsteps. The magnitudes of movements do not always match up exactly but the timing of them is good and it is the timing of trend changes which matters. Um we are now at the moment in this comparison equal to when gold was breaking out above 200 back in 2024 that followed a three-year sideways consolidation in gold prices. Oil's response has been more downward than sideways as it echoes gold's three-year consolidation. But now we are at the echo point of gold's big turn. This chart does not include the most recent history of what gold is doing. That is intentional because I want to focus on the period of gold prices behavior that is relevant to the moment for what crude prices should do. You probably have heard that gold spike close to 4,400. That will matter for oil prices 19.8 months from now. uh blah blah blah blah what matters is catching the direction of the move correctly right and gold says that this coming uptrend in oil prices should last for a while so you might want to fill up the Winnebago now uh so these are more divergences last week we covered a bunch of market divergences where we saw weakness in breath and other things while prices of the indices were going up the underlying participation was weakening that's usually It foreshadows some weakness in the indices which we have uh anticipated since the beginning of October. We think that's probably going to continue in coming weeks following MAG 7 earnings. We shall see. But I like this massive divergence in oil. As you know, we have exposure through national oil well Varco through comtock uh etc. And um and I definitely think that this is getting washed out. the kids how to play it and we've discovered uh discussed why we've expressed it in the way that we have. Moving along. Um where am I? Okay, I'm missing my pod charts. Let's get those going here. Okay. Okay, here we go with some data for the week. uh global small cap versus is large cap relative valuation and forward returns relative trailing PE of global small cap versus global large cap and subsequent 5-year annualized relative returns 1987 to September 2025 implies at current rates um excess returns of small caps relative to large caps at 10% annualized uh for the foreseeable future next 5 years. Small cap should outperform large cap by 10% per year. We agree demand for commercial aircraft to double in 20 years. 43,000 plus passenger and freighter aircraft by 2044 continues to be great for Boeing. Uh which has been a major holding from much lower levels. Uh it was all immigrants overpaying for houses using tax taxpayer provided welfare. FHA loan locks to immigrants without permanent residency, including H1B visa holders, percentage share of FHA loan locks. Um, they were at 6% until they changed the policy in June and they've now fallen to almost 0%. That's kind of interesting. It's in line with my thesis that as rates come down, actually home prices are going to come down, not up, because everyone's going to hit the market at once. And once you start to get negative comps, everyone panics in. And considering that most of the owners are in their 70s, um they are going to hit the market before there's no more market to hit. So housing housing affordability coming to a theater near you. Now I wouldn't say FHA loan locks to immigrants immigrants overpaying for houses. I can guarantee you the home prices precoid in Newport did not go from $4 million precoid to $15 million uh now because immigrants were locking in FHA loans, but uh there is something to be said about the dramatic change post change in policy. Uh Yahoo Finance Open AI would have to spend over $1 trillion to deliver its promised computing power. It may not have the cash. It certainly does not. Uh federal budget receipts on customs duties. You can see now it's tracking at 29 billion per month. Uh the deficit has now moved from deficit to surplus. That's very positive for interest rates. Volatility is the toll we pay to invest. Uh what are we saying? What is the point that Ryan is making here? Oh, okay. This shows that uh on average you get 7.2 3% dips per year. You get 3.4 5% mild corrections per year. You get 1.1 10% corrections per year. You get a half a uh a 15% correction. So basically one every two years uh and you get a bare market every 3.5 years. We've had multiple bare markets in the last 5 years and I think a lot of them have been pulled forward. We did hit 20% correction intraday uh in August. We had obviously the bare market in 2022 in 2020. So basically in five years you've had three and you would normally have that in 10 10.5 years. So we pulled forward a lot of that volatility in my view. Um so I wouldn't be waiting for the big flush. It's not coming. But I would be uh open-minded to a 5% pullback, which could be tremendous for some of the companies under the surface, being able to get them 15% cheaper and more in some cases. Margin debt is elevated. You can see here, uh, Bank of America, we see lower mortgage rates down to 5% from 6.7% today as consistent with Treasury Secretary Besson's recent statement that everything is on the table with respect to addressing the US housing affordability crisis. The Trump administration may push to end MBS quantitative tightening right away. That would be positive. Um, fund strat's calling for 7,000 by the end of the year. I agree with 7,000. I don't agree with the end of the year, but uh um I'm in no way going to be sad if that happens. I will be super excited. I would I would love a dip in the meantime so we can really crank it up and and benefit from that. But I think 7,000 is a 2026 number, not a 2025 number. Uh totally open to being wrong on that and would be very excited if it happened. Number of leverage equity ETFs at record high. Uh this is in line with the call option stats that I've been talking to you about in recent week. Record weekly inflow into tech funds. You saw this at the top in 2021 right before the uh uh pullback. Small cap EPS growth is strong. So you can buy small caps at 43% earnings growth this quarter at a mid- teens multiple or you can buy MAG 7 at 14% earnings growth at a low30s multiple you make the call the uh let's see bullish sentiment is just starting to roll over uh you see that before you know pullbacks uh VIX seasonal pattern tends to peak in late October October and early November. We'll see if that pattern follows this year. S&P 2 thou uh Russell 2000 versus S&P uh relative highs as we talked about uh small caps have been dramatically outperforming the S&P and large caps since August. Regional banks have not. That's the black line. Uh 10-year Treasury yield is now below 4%. We were a very minority call uh when it was approaching 5% here. You can go back to the podcast. We said it would be uh in the threes before the end of the year and we also said mortgage rates would be below 6% before the end of the year. We're going to find out in the next 10 weeks. Uh interest on sofur call options. Traders are piling into positions targeting bigger Fed cuts into year end. Positioning for a half a point reduction either when the Fed meets this month or in December. That's more than the two quarter point cuts now priced into interest rate swaps. That's interesting. They're calling for one of these to be a 50. That would be amaz that would be unreal. Uh consensus is long-term banks, pharma, tech, short energy, and staples. I think now is the time to be buying staples, buying energy, buying materials. Banks, you've had your run. Uh tech, you've had your run. Pharma, I think there is opportunity in pharma on a selective basis. Uh biggest inflow to China stocks since April 2025. Nice to see that continuing. North American liqufied natural gas export capacity project by 2016 to 2029. It's going to be more and more international demand as we choke off Russia and um uh weak balance sheet stocks have outperformed recently. That's on the basis of lower rates. Yeah, that's kind of interesting. And you look at the S&P relative to this VIX greater than 27 and it does not it's it's not consistent with you tend to get these spikes before the final uh low. We got a little bit of consolidation since the beginning of October. Little bit of but but this type of SP uh this type of spike rarely results is really the end and that's why I think we're going to get a little more weakness in coming weeks. So we'll see. Um, credit card delinquency rates have peaked and are now rolling over. That's good because the loan um uh same thing with uh auto loan delinquency peaked rolling over. Why? Because rates are going down and the unnecessary restrictive uh headwind that Powell has placed on uh people's affordability of interest is now going away. market tends to bottom since 1928 at the end of October. We'll see. May go into November. You know, when everyone's so confident about this, I'm just seeing so many things that we're going to start rallying, you know, November, December like we always do. Just like everyone was so confident that we wouldn't get a correction in April, it would be in the fall. Um, we will see what happens there. Uh, okay. Equity positioning. Hedge funds are increasingly participating in Hong Kong IPOs. Opinion follows trend. bottom of ETSs equity ball control discretionary investors have been very cautious and are now positioned for negative earnings growth. It's a Deutsche Bank forecast on earnings growth and this is the positioning. It's kind of interesting. This positioning was going negative right before 2022 when everyone was and 2017 and 2020 204 got a little bit of correction. So yeah, I mean you could see some volatility ahead uh dollar value of all that's where we thrive by the way. All call options and put options. So you can see the amount of call options, you know, it can go a little it can consolidate a little longer after you get these spikes, but sooner or later you always get some reversion to the mean if you get up that extreme. Normalized margin debt is now at 2021 peaks. Uh so you know we know what happened after that. uh total equal weight and US top 500 market cap weight relative performance. Best opportunity to buy non capweight since 1999 and before that 1974 lows. Uh that was the Nifty50 crash. That was the tech crash. Uh so we'll see. Oil price slide could drag Treasury low yields even lower. Okay. Shut down. What's this? Online retail sales up 9.8% 8% in China yearon-year. That's from Brendan Ahern. Physical goods online 6.5%. GDP 4.8% estimate was 4.7%. China is humming. This is more on the seasonality and consensus year-on-year earnings growth. Realizing consensus year-on-year earnings growth. So these next two quarters are going to be the weakest of the year. last year fourth quarter was the strongest. Um so you know the targets of 7,000 are hoping that the market looks through two quarters of declining earnings growth. I'm not so sure when you've got no marginal buyers and a lot of insider sellers stock to absorb uh how long that goes. I I I think there there's going to be some opportunity. China stock level households are very pessimistic about the US labor households are very pessimistic about the US labor market outlook. And this is another interesting thing. You haven't seen this kind of pessimism outside of major corrections in the indust. So, this is another divergence that would be consistent with an eight or nine% pullback, if not more, going looking back at these years. What's this daily fund flow? High yield. Be worry if OAS spreads exceed a thousand basis points. We're still still have very compressed spreads. Uh, let's see here. Okay, here's more of the seasonal composite. So, we we got a little bit of weakness. We didn't get anything like this. And I think that, you know, if you look back to like April, April would have shown strength if you looked at this compositive. it was weakness. So sometimes there's a pull forward, pull ahead, catch up. I think we're closer to the catch up where the indices have gotten ahead of the fundamentals and there'll be a little bit of a catch down in the indices following MAG 7 earnings. Uh US come or it could be the the uh shutdown doesn't get resolved quickly enough. It could be something with Russia. It could be, you know, we don't know what it's going to be, but we do know that a lot of things are priced for perfection and any little hiccup. It could be Powell, you know, blinks next week and doesn't cut. No one's positioned for that. Um, I would it wouldn't it would be unusual for him to do that. Uh, we'll see the inflation numbers tomorrow could spook people. Who who knows? um shut sectors equal weighted consumer staples, healthcare, utilities, telecom aka defensives. The last time they were this low was uh the 2021 top and the 2000 top when no one wanted defensives and that's all Buffett was buying. uh and then the 1980. So these were times to be buying defensives, healthc care, utilities, telco, uh staples and that's why our framework is leading us to these staples like the Dagios, like the healthcare, like the Baxters, like the um Estee Lauder, etc. boring companies that are out of favor. You know, in fall of 2022, it was tech, which we were buying and you couldn't give away uh and mag 7. Um in uh during COVID, it was energy, you know, energy prices went negative and banks. So, it just changes, but there's always something to buy in the hole. And that's what where the opportunity is right now. And you can see it on this relative performance chart which is pretty wild. Uh obviously earnings is good 8 and a half versus eight so far. We know that um relative strength versus the S&P 500 in last year discretionary. So put restaurants in there. I think there's going to be an opportunity in restaurants as meat prices come down. You started to see them this week. Um energy same thing. Financials. I just don't have interest in materials. Yes. Industrials. Yes. Dow Jones. So transports has lagged the Dow. This is another divergence. So either this transports catch up dramatically or the Dow may catch down a little bit. We we shall see whether this is a fake out or whether there's some follow-through. Um earnings expectations turning back up after troughing after the first half of the year. That's pretty normal. Average age of US passenger cars on the road is now 14.5 according to Arbor. China consumer confidence index. Look at the look at all the performance of Alibaba and all these companies and the confidence hasn't even come back yet. Opinion will follow trend. Wait till this comes back up to 105 and beyond where the Alibabas will be of the world will be by client. Retail clients were the only net buyers last week. So beware of that. Um this is showing how the bull market is just getting started in China by six charts and this is earnings per share at 90 expected to be 115 by 2027 low teen profit growth and moderate PE expansion. Chinese equities could be in the process of transitioning to growth where earnings realization will be the main propeller of equity returns. AI and the anti-involution going global could lift trend EPS growth to low teen levels that's going to be Alibaba chi Msei China forward PE still only at 12.9 uh should get back up to 15 plus you add earnings growth and it's never going to stop at 15 I think I think Alibaba will trade up to a 20 or 30 times when everyone is in the frenzy and it's closer to mid200s or 300s and um and that'll be a good good point to start laying off. Uh small caps flows positive. We've seen that outperformance since August. Uh Goldman Sachs US high beta momentum index is down 15% in 6 days. So there was some pain uh early in the month. It's worth keeping an eye on. That's just kind of the canary in the coal mine that we've been discussing. Um with earnings doing the heavy lifting in 2025, valuations are taking a breather following two years of return amplification. This is what we generally want to see in the later stages of cyclical bull. Uh expected growth rate has bounced modestly from 7% to 8%. 40% 40%. Okay. Uh there is some fear in the market. uh US no revenues profitable tech companies with no revenues or profits are flying the rest are left in the shade that's going to shift very quickly relative performance percentile healthcare and stables at the bottom that's when you want to be a buyer communications and tech at the top that's when you want to be a seller This is IWM relative to S&P 600 starting to pick up again. The Russell um value versus Russell growth. Mortgage rates are being helped by reduced bond volatility. mortgage payment divided by average hourly earnings has come from 99. Monthly payment was 96.4 hours of wages. Now it is uh uh peaked at 99 in 2023. Now it's down to 84.5. The historic mean is 79.7 hourly earnings for one mortgage payment. So we're moving back to toward affordability. That's pretty useful chart. Alibaba prices AI glasses at $660 to rival Meta and launches chat GPT Challenger.

If you're getting a huge return on your invested capital in the quote unquote AI revolution, uh why are you laying off 600 people right in the middle of it? Why Warren Buffett's investing style will outlast AI. I love this article. Uh, quote, "What's wrong, Warren?" Baron's pointedly asked in a December 1999 cover story. At the time, many saw Warren Buffett, who hadn't touched the booming.com trade, as too conservative, even pass a internet was revolutionary, and Buffett was out of step. Today, AI has assumed the same role as the internet did then. Buffett successfully weathered the dot storm. The next generation of value investors is naturally wondering if they will weather the AI storm, too. the investor recently declared Bloomberg uh AI he concludes has raised the edge of my long run investment partnership for better two decades disagree if anything conditions feel ripe for a value investing comeback index funds are trading without regard to value there's a shrinking pool of fundamental investors yet the better tools to source and analyze ideas AI is fueling a spike in irrationally priced companies while political and geopolitical uncertainty is growing inefficiency is rising not falling So why declare value investing game over? Ask open AI Sam Alman predicted quote some sort of investment vehicle is going to figure out how US use AI to be an unbelievable investor have crazy outperformance. Alman Altman clearly revolutionary investors but value investors and machines have long coexisted both thriving in their own ways. After all renaissance technologies medallion fund has been minting money for decades. Value investing's edge has often been attributed to diligence around information. Buffett is the classic example, combing Moody's manuals page by page, scouring the Omaha Public Library, and Gracing Scuttlebutt by famously visiting Geico's offices on a weekend as a youngster, investing as a numbers game, and Buffett did the most reps. The diligence may have mattered more before computers and now AI, but it was never the only edge. Let's look at two others. These are the two most important, ladies and gentlemen. Time and temperament. Value investing is like golf, but with a two-year delay between swing and scorecard. And that is if you're lucky. Few are willing to endure such long feedback loops. But the value in value investing lies in playing the long game increasingly. So argued the advantage of time arbitrage increased for the very reasons whyformational advantages have decreased. Technology, the ease of gathering information, the short-term focus of market participants. AI hasn't changed that equation. It has amplified it. Time is also inseparable from one's capital structure. Many funds get trapped in a vicious cycle. Underperformance triggers outflows, forcing sales, depressing prices and fueling more outflows. Uh, take the UK. Numerous public companies investors with depressed prices simply because they had no choice. Investors with patient capital and a long-term mindset can turn that selling pressure into a buying opportunity. We enjoy helping out force sellers at the right price. In his first nationally broadcasted TV interview in 1985, Buffett credited his his success not to intellect but to his even keeled temperament. It was forged by the principles of value investment, insisting on a margin of safety by buying well below intrinsic value, thinking like a business owner with long-term time horizon, and using the market's mood swings to your advantage. AI may help process data, but it cannot replace the value of a strong and stable temperament. It cannot summon courage or conviction under pressure. As we like to say on the podcast, ice in my veins. Uh the courage to buy in March of 2020 when COVID 19 was wrecking global markets. you guys benefited from that. Uh the conviction to invest in Italy during the Euro crisis in 2020 2012. Uh but that isn't enough. If Buffett has a superpower, it is his temperament as expressed through adaptability. In that same 1985 interview, he claimed to never have bought a technology company. Fast forward to the 2000s. He was invested in IBM, then Apple, and even Oracle for a short while. He shut down his partnership in 1969 when valuations were absurd and pivoted to building Berkshire. He started acquiring private businesses when they were offered better value. When markets changed, he adapted. That kind of temperament is immune to AI disruption. There's no denying times are changing. Many investors incorporated it. Filtering out non-essentials. AI can help separate actionable insights from a flood of noise, boosting productivity for sure. Uh but it can e just as easily multiply distractions. Uh other ideas exist focusing on low AI companies pursuing activism that requires real world heavy lifting or finding market niches where competition is inherently low. The list is endless. Large language. Somebody still has to make the decision weighing options overcoming the occasional mistake and having the temperament to pull the trigger or cut your losses at the right time. Today's AI bubble will create mispricings just as past bubbles have. But I can tell tell you from experience value hunting is still a worthwhile exercise. Case in point, ever since investors stopped reading Moody's manuals, the A's have gotten way more interesting. Finding and acting on these opportunities take time, temperament, and touring edge as the tools evolve. Uh Buffett is stepping down at the end of the year, but he has provided the next generation of value investors reassurance as they confront AI. New things coming along don't take away the opportunities, he said. What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things. I think this is the most important line. What gives you the opportunities is other people doing dumb things. As long as humans behave emotionally and succumb to folly, value investing, value investing won't only survive, it will thrive. And we know this year how incredibly well it has thrived for our specific flavor. American corporation, the turnaround Tom flavor. American corporations are crushing it. This stock isn't just about tech. It's talking about GM uh crushing uh their earnings. Uh is Magnificent 7's earnings edge fading? We're going to see that next week as the earnings growth rate has hald. Multiples have not yet moved. Refinance demand is 81% higher than it was a year ago thanks to falling mortgage rates.

Intel's stock jumps tonight as Q3 earnings beat expectations. AI helps chip demand. Uh was up pretty big. I think it got up to $41 after hours. It's unbelievable. You couldn't give it away at $18 or $19 and now it's starting to get interesting for a lot of people and it's just getting started. Lit Bhutan said in his statement, "AI is accelerating demand for commute and creating attractive opportunities across our portfolio." What they're also saying is that their demand is now starting to exceed uh supply. We believe we're well positioned to play a more significant role in AI uh highprofile investors etc. So that's good news on Intel. Amazing that it had followthrough after such a huge move for us.

Howop captured the heart of Gen Z with bargains on secondhand treasures and a social media field. The e-commerce app has taken the energy of a good thrift store online. Etsy owns it. We're excited about that. Uh and let's move on to the article week of the week. When rates fall, castles rise, stock market and sentiment results. So Crown Castle. Every week we try to cover one to two companies we've discussed in previous podcasts and or owned for clients including personally. While you're at hedge funips.com, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Get a hat while you're there. Tell your friends uh and so on. Crown Castle kicked off our Q3 earnings season on the right foot, delivering another solid quarter and raising fullyear guidance as the recovery story takes hold. Like all REITs, the name of the game with Crown Castle is interest rates. When the 10-year yield moves lower, REITs tend to catch a bid. And CCI is no exception. And while the chart below is slightly dated, it does a good job of painting the picture of the relationship. That's because when bonds rise, yields fall. Companies like CCI get a twofur of cheaper financing and stronger demand for yield. It's no secret that REITs tend to carry a lot of debt on the balance sheet, relying on borrowing to finance acquisitions and development. In the case of CCI, this leverage is to the tune of 24 billion net debt, 86% fixed rate, and results in annual interest expense of just under 1 billion. Lower rates open the door to refinancing at more for favorable terms, reducing the interest burden while also serving as a shot in the arm for highly levered carriers to boost capbacks, resulting in better client activity and a win-win for Crown Castle. Meanwhile, the close to 7.5 trillion remains parked on the sidelines collecting 4% yields risk-free. A key reason dividend yield has been neglected, but as we like to say, money eventually finds its way to where it's treated best. As rates come down and investors are forced to search for yield elsewhere, they will be tripping over themselves to get exposure to high quality names like Crown Castle with a 4.3% dividend and room for material price appreciation from here. Of course, this dynamic is a double-edged sword for REITs and we've seen the flip side of this playbook over the past few years. When rates move higher, borrowing costs rise, fixed income becomes more attractive, leaving REITs on the short end of the stick. The good news is that this dislocation g gave us the opportunity to buy what we would consider a straw hat in the wintertime, picking up a high quality leader like CCI after it been cut in half right before what appears to be the early innings of the Fed easing cycle. With the 10-year yield back to having a threehandle, investors are slowly beginning to wake up to the opportunity. We've been making the case for a lower 10-year yield for some time and still see a path lower from here. whether it's the removal of the supplementary leverage ratio SLR the Genius Act and stable coins potentially creating $2 trillion in treasury demand uh or reduce issuance on stronger tax receipts. There are multiple arrows in the quiver supporting that view. Another arrow being the end of quantitating quantitative tightening in the MBS market could be a major factor that the administration is now focused on. Here's a link to our prior article where we made this case in detail. In the meantime, while waiting for this dynamic to play out, CCI has done shareholders a favor by removing two of the big overhangs that had been weighing on the stock, announcing a new CEO and the sale of its fiber business. Leadership at CCI had been a revolving door with three CEOs since 2024, the appointment of a new president and CEO Chris Halibbrandt in August removes a layer of uncertainty and is welcome news for shareholders with more than three decades of experience in the global tower industry. Hallebrandt is a proven winner and exactly what CCI needed. On top of that, CCI agreed to sell the long struggling fiber segment for 8.5 billion. The capital intensive segment had been a major drag on results for over a decade, consistently accounting for 90% of total capex while generating less than 1/4 of operating profit, a good formula for destroying shareholder value. The transaction remains on track to close the first half of 2026, leaving CCI as a high margin, higher margin, leaner business, and the only publicly traded pure play US Tower company. Management plans to use $6 billion of the proceeds to pay down debt and allocate the rest to what they should have been doing all along, share repurchases. So, with rates coming down and two big overhangs now removed, Crown Castle's recovery is well underway. From here, it comes down to how well Chris Hillbrandt executes. If history is any guide, we can expect great things. In the meantime, we're happy to collect the dividend and watch the story play out. So, you can see here the earnings results, the keys from the earnings call and deck. The 10 key points, $8.5 billion sale of the small cell and fiber solutions business remains management's top priority and is on track to close for the first half of 2026. Positioning CCI is the only publicly traded pure play power company focused on tower company focused exclusively in the US market. Two, organic revenue growth excluding the sprint turn total 5.2 2% for the quarter, well ahead of the 4.7% fullear guidance. Management continues to expect the sprint cancellation churn, which represented a 51 million headwind during the quarter to lapse by the end of 2025. Three, management believes the tower business is quote entering a period of significant opportunity supported by sustained mobile data growth and rising consumer customer demand. In 2024, mobile data usage increased by more than 30% for the third consecutive year, which remains the best long-term indicator of demand for for tower assets as continued investment is needed to support higher levels of mobile data traffic. Four capital expenditures totaled just 42 million for the quarter, including 36 million in discretionary and 6 million in maintenance capex. Management also lowered fullear discretionary capex guidance to 155 million, down from 30 million uh from the prior outlook. This is a welcome change in strategy from the 1.1 billion spent on discretionary capex in 2024 which was largely tied to capital intensive loss generating fiber business. Five capital allocation priorities following the fiber sale remain unchanged. Reducing $6 billion of debt is a top priority. Any remaining cash flow will be directed towards share repurchases after the sale. Management expects to grow the dividend in line with AFO while maintaining a payout ratio between 75 to 80% six. Following the sale of the fiber business, management continues to anticipate significant operational efficiencies, simplifying the company from three operating segments down to one focused business. Some of these benefits are already being realized with 15 million of the 40 million increase to fullear AFO guidance driven by lower expenses. Seven management also highlighted that spectrum acquisitions often create meaningful growth opportunity for tower operators over the past year. Each major mobile network operator has acquired additional spectrum despite collectively securing 700 megahertz less than five years ago. The same amount obtained in the prior 40 years combined. Looking ahead, the FCC plans to auction at least another 800 megahertz of spectrum beginning 2027, which will be a material tailwind for CCI. 8 management raised fullear guidance across the board from previous outlook with the midpoint of site rental revenues increasing to 4.0. 03 billion uh plus 10 million adjusted IBIDA to 2.84 billion plus 30 million and AFO to 1.87 billion plus 40 million9. Management remains committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet ending the quarter with 84% of debt fixed a weighted average debt maturity of 6 years and 4.2 billion of available liquidity under the revolving credit facility compared to 2.7 billion of maturities over the next 12 months. 10. Crown Castle maintains a long-term agreement in place to 2036 with Echoar and continues to expect full payment under the terms of the contract in light of the Ecostar's agreement to sell Spectrum assets to both AT&T and SpaceX. Management noted that they remain open to working with all parties in ways that maximize shareholder value. Here's the earnings call transcript. We highlighted the important points. You can read at your leisure. the fear and greed down to 27. Uh, active investment managers are not done selling. They're just starting in our view. Next, NASDAQ top 30 weights, earnings, estimates, revisions in the last 60 days. Top 30 weights revised up by 1.55% on the NASDAQ and on the Dow up. 41% in the last 60 days. to tomorrow we have CPI. This is a critically important number ahead of the Fed meeting. So far we have 85% beat rate, 8.5% earnings growth uh versus estimated 8%. Usually you have 3 percentage points better. So we'll see if that improves or not in uh in the next week or so. Guidance is going to be the name of the game. So far, the first two Mag 7, Tesla and Netflix, have been margin contraction. Uh, now we're going to move on to the ask me anything questions from our incredible community and audience. And our first question comes in from Kyle M. Could you please help me understand your recent consumer staples versus S&P 500 comparison? I understand they have the lowest relative weight since March 2000. But does that somehow adjust for the dra drastically increased proportion of tech products integrated into our lives since then? I.e. tech in cars houses andor the increased proportion of tech companies including the S&P 500. Thanks in advance for the extra explanation. Well, if you go back to 2000 when global crossing was laying laying all of that pipe uh a wire rather uh tech was a as significant a weight and the expectation of the amount of tech in our lives from pre- internet to internet at that time as a portion of our lives and as a portion of the S&P was about equivalent. So, it's always bubbles up to extreme levels before some of the errors out of the balloon. The difference this time is that the companies are sound. It's just the valuations have gotten a bit ahead of themselves and I think we'll consolidate which will put some weight on the indices for the next 12 months. But huge opportunities under the surface if you're skating to where the puck's going. defensive, staples, uh some of the neglected areas, energy, small caps, international, uh etc. that we've discussed, you'll be able to benefit. So, this view that this time is different is wrong. Um it's we we we just have to concentrated in waitings consistent with um a bubble that gets washed out and then all of the promises of what that technology will do will not only be met will probably be better than we could even imagine. Uh it's just a lot of it's being paid for already what's going to take place over the next 10 years. Uh to the next point, Jacob M says on PayPal, what's the moat factor you're seeing when it comes to defending against stable coins? Um stable coins, PayPal does curious how you think of this. Well, number one, Alex Chris is not asleep at the wheel. I've hired him basically because I think like a business owner uh to be on top of this and he's fully taking advantage of all the opportunities in stable coins and elsewhere. Number two, this stuff doesn't change overnight. They've got a moat of 430 million people in many countries around the world. So the buzz of stable coins, the buzz of quantum computing, the buzz of nuclear energy, all that will be factors, but they'll be factors 10 years from now. Uh less Adelman and PayPal will probably be at the forefront. Uh have you discussed Polaris lately? If not, would you please? It's funny. A friend of mine sent me um a company that provides the parts to to these type of companies and these got washed out after the 21 peak. I think it is time to start buying them to be honest with you. I think they're recovering and uh like Fox Factory I've been looking at. Haven't done anything with it. Uh Polaris is is recovering. Uh so I think that's a better way to play. It's the exact opposite of the Cooper Standard and the OEMs. Um, I want to own Cooper Standard and not GM and Ford because they're going to be a race to the bottom. In the case of the recreational vehicles, they're very small amount of them. So, it's not a race to the bottom. And I think the OEMs will do better than the suppliers. So, you'd want to own the PO Polaris, the Fox Factory, etc. if you were going to play that space. We probably will not, but we continue to look at it. You know, the secret to success in investing, what what people miss and why so many wealthy people give me money to manage is not because I'm smarter than they are. It's because the skill set that made them so successful uh is the exact opposite skill set of what makes people so successful as investors. So to become a successful entrepreneur and make a ton of money and grow a company and sell it, um it's massive action equals massive results. And what happens when a lot of these entrepreneurs get their 300 or 400 or $500 million payout and they're sitting in their house, they can't be inactive. So they just get very active and after they lose the first 20% of their wealth and blow 100 million in the market with the 400 that they have left, they call me and uh they say, "You know, in business, I hired the best people to build my company. I don't know why I didn't just hire the best people to manage my money." And then sooner or later they do because and then they go out and either build another great business because they can do it like no one else can uh um or they just enjoy life and they don't have to watch markets 24/7 because they don't realize they're competing with people who've been doing it 25 years uh that are very good at one one particular thing. So I think that is the difference that I see between the less wealthy clients and the superw wealthy clients is the superw wealthy clients know how to hire well and benefit without doing the work and the lesser wealthy clients try to do it themselves and compete with people um who that's all they do and um you know the goal here I I would say there's quite a few of you who have been listening for three or four years that are probably now better than 80% of active managers that do it for a living because you have a context and you have a timing and you have a structural advantage that they don't have which is you know for most active managers we have like zero correlation to the S&P 500 but most of them are basically closet indexers that are asset gathers and salespeople so they basically say we're actively managing but when you look under the hood they're basically just copying the index plus or minus a few percentage point, calling it active share, giving you a whole bunch of about how that's special and charging you a point. And um uh uh if they're in for them to buy stocks that are out of favor, like you cannot outperform if you're not benefiting from dislocation. And most of these managers can't have stocks that have fallen a lot on their quarterly statements because they have career risk. Okay? And the only way to outperform is to buy those stocks that have been dislocated and then through experience knowing whether it's a temporary impair impairment or a permanent impairment and actually doing the work. But they can't hold it for a few quarters until it doubles and triples over two or three years. And we have that advantage because the investors that we attract are wealthy people who know and most of them made their money in their respective businesses either rolling up companies or whatever. They buy great assets at good prices and put them together and and so on and so forth. They're not buying up. They're buying down and then rolling that out and then selling up when they've cobbled together 20 30 businesses and all the private equity has all this powder that they're throwing at them and want to pay them 15 20 times multiple sold to you. And they do it intuitively as entrepreneurs, but as investors, they get hypnotized by the moving ticks on the screen and the charts on the screen and the noise and the instinct to take action when when the the fortunes are made in inaction. Buying right and sitting on your hands and being patient. Um, Baba was a good example, Intel was a good example. So many others that took a little longer and now they're just taking off. Uh, that's a special skill set. Ice in the veins and the time arbitrage that was talked about in that Baron's article that we discussed. Ivor Barry, hey Tom, I don't think Galerma stock is a buy, but a PM I know is adding capital at these levels. I brought up valuation concerns and his response was, you wouldn't buy any growth stocks with that thinking. Thoughts? Uh, give him a few years. He'll be working at your local Walmart when he gets flushed out. Like half the people I saw in even the modest correction of 2022. I can't tell you how many growth managers I know that were buying at the end of 2021 who were no longer in the investment management business. And we were buying all the stuff that they were for sellers in fall of 2022. And you know because you were here. Um, would you take a look at GKO? This is from York Bourgeoa. And let me know what you think of it. It's an opthalmology company with devices, free cash. Okay. GKO. Yeah, I I'm not a big fan of negative free cash flow companies. Let me take a look at the B balance sheet. Unless it's like a temporary impairment. This one I know their revenues are growing. Let me just take a look. So what's their debt like? All right. Balance sheet looks okay. They are growing topline. Share count's growing but not crazy. Uh it's not really for me. I I understand your I I just don't like that they've never generated a return on invested capital for their owners. That's a problem for me. Um, so I I'm going to pass on this. I think on a trading basis you might be right, but uh that's not what we do here at Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. Garrett Kirsto, been following for almost three years now and I always appreciate your guidance. Was wondering what you thought about Molina after the drop. I can't tell if the EPS guy down as a sign of bad management or they're just sandbagging. Would you appreciate your thoughts as I'm debating whether now is a good time to pay take a position? Uh, Molina is bottom of the barrel. I don't think I'd mess around with this one yet. Um, you know, basically they're dealing with the people that cannot get private insurance that wind up on the exchanges. uh and they tend to mention that they tend to be those people that are the highest cost participants and that's not an ideal scenario because it could be you know chronic super expensive diseases. Um UNH is probably a better play and the other one Hum is probably better of all three if I had to be in one of them. Uh Matt Malik OIS oil states. Yeah, this I I'd rather own Varco. This is not really showing signs of turnaround. I think it's going to work as a trade. Um, let me just see the balance sheet to make sure you don't get hurt. If you want to play in it, it'll go with the whole group. If oil starts to recover, which I think it is, um, yeah, this is not a great business. I I think it's going to go up in price, but I I I wouldn't want to own this. And our filters, just to just to remind you, and for the new viewers, you know, if JP Morgan was going to finance us to buy the entire company with the one caveat, we had to be the equity with 100% of our net worth, i.e., if it would be a leveraged buyout, which means if it works, we would make multiples on our net worth, maybe 10x, 20x, and if it doesn't work, we'd have zero and we'd be applying for jobs as greeters at the local Walmart. If we won't do that deal, we won't even buy one share. So, in this case, we wouldn't do the deal. So, we wouldn't buy one share, even though it might go up because of trading. Uh here is Gasper asking about um Warner Brothers Discovery. I think these things are going to get some value realized. Um they kind of the the last men standing are still uh holding their own. Would I be a buyer up here? No. Might get taken out by Netflix because Netflix growth is slowing and that's what people are worried about. That's why the stock is down saturated in the US. Uh Jeremy Raph Sherry your podcast all the time at the poker tables. All right, thank you. I tried to buy a hat a couple times. We'll keep trying. Getting invalid shipping message. I guess you're from out of country maybe. Otherwise, just clear cookies. You should be able to do it. Uh can you check out Pedex stock and see if it's come down enough to make it interesting? Okay, let's see. Pedex, thank you for sharing Jeremy. That is the uh greatest thing you can do for the community because we keep growing. We keep doing uh don't think it's come down enough yet. Uh let me just take a look here. What do these guys do? Still negative cash flow. Now I wouldn't mess with this one. Um surgical instruments. I know it's healthcare. I I'd like to see it come down more. So if it comes down another 20%, send it back in as an AMA. Uh this is from Barry Kimbro. Hi Tom, thank you for bringing so much value every week. My framework and how I approach the market and securities keeps improving every week. I'm also a financial adviser and have done well with your picks. Thank you. Heard you are looking in the restaurant space as meat prices come down. What's your thoughts on Texas Roadhouse? Uh love Texas Roadhouse. I don't know if they have it out here in California. I haven't been to one in ages. I could I would love to go to one tonight. Um I mean what else could you ask for? country music, good ribeye. All right. And other than that, you really don't need anything else in the world. Uh other than obviously family. All right. Texas Roadhouse. You know, it's interesting. Um, this is an example of buying a um, great business at a good price versus a good business at a great price. You know, it's funny. Buffett says that, you know, Munger changed him and he started buying great businesses at good prices. But when you look at his periods of the greatest outperformance was when he was running his partnerships and he was buying good businesses at great prices. And that's when he had the shoot the lights out numbers. And it's also when he had um, you know, was most hungry and everything else. So for me, this is a great business at a good price. I'm not going to get a double out of it in the next three years. So, I wouldn't buy up at these these levels. Um Luke Wheeler um Luke is asking on Envy Nova Nordisk and my friend Daryl who I saw. Yeah. Yeah, that has come down more. I think Nova Nordisk is probably just about ready. I don't think you're going to get hurt with Nova Nordis at these levels. I'm not sure that I'm going to be pulling the trigger on something like this right yet. Um, but I'm getting very very interested. I mean, in the low 40s, high30s, I don't even have to think about it. I don't know if I'm going to see that. All right, let's see here. interest expense. Yeah. I mean, the risk you run here is basically someone beats them to the punch with the oral GLP1, but so far none of them have worked. Uh I think in the low 40s, you got to buy this thing. Even if you don't love it, I don't know if you're going to get that. You probably buy it here. You're okay for the long term. Uh, this has just been a good business over a very long period of time. Even PreGps, there's nothing not to like here. Whether you buy it at 50 or 40, it's fine. I just I'm interested. So, good job with that, Luke. Uh, Sandridge Energy. Not yet. Still negative free cash flow. It's moved up a lot in anticipation of good things. It'll probably be okay, but they're better plays. Uh, so that's Luke. GG. Thank you for sharing your valuable insights, tips week after week unselfishly in a public space, giving us access to individuals like me benefiting from your professional views. Biomarin, I agree. I don't think you missed anything. I think Biomarin is fine. Um, I have to do more work on the pipeline, but I think I think both biomarin, NVO, and PF are probably okay. Good work. These you really have to study the pipelines and it takes a lot of work. Uh, Brad J, love the podcast. Viatric. Yeah, Viatric is this is this is where value gets a bad name. This has been a value trap forever. Looks like it may want to start to work. It's unbelievable. It's just been a cash machine and you can't give it away. I don't think you're going to get hurt with this. The key you got to figure out it's, you know, generics is you get a nice dividend yield. What is the catalyst? What's going to change that makes people want to own it? I think this one is probably worth doing some work on. So I I I do like it now. It seems like it's probably done selling and um that looks pretty good. Ashish C, thanks for sharing your wisdom. Could you please take a look at Cogenic CGNX? If this is an individual biotech, I'm probably not going to have any comments on it. Oh, CGNX. Okay, never mind. No, this is um yeah, the margins are not recovering yet though. Machine vision project visual information automate manufacturing and distribution tax. Take a look at balance sheet. Yeah, very slow growth on the top line. It's trying to recover. Um, you know, it's up double off the bottom already. I mean I it probably works higher. I just think there are higher better uses of capital. Uh Tim Slovic, what are your thoughts on behavioral finance? I mean it's a huge part of what we do. If you look at all the indicators, we have couple hundred on our website. Uh we discuss maybe five or 10 each week. It's it's a big deal. Um but you know that's just like finger in the wind stuff. just to give you a barometer of where things are versus um doing the work on underwriting the individual business private equity in the public markets. Would I buy the whole company? Uh if not, I won't buy one share. Tom, I know you like energy services right now with National Oil. Well, Varco, could you have a look at Fugrow Geodata analysis service? Okay. F U G F U R F F U R G O I don't know. You might have misspelled this partner. Unless it's an international company. F U R G O. F U G R O. Try it one more time. Okay. Yeah, it is. We revenues and margins and free cash flow are decelerating. Stock is down about half. Uh I would just wait get a sense of how this is going to reacelerate. I don't think it's a great use of capital. Probably works. Uh I'm back to what are some of the key points you're looking for in the upcoming earnings release? I just want to know that the pump is uh on track to either it's been fixed or it's back in the market or uh that that's the key thing. Uh I don't really look at quarterto quarter candidly. Um I look at it afterwards and we study it and we do an article on it, but I'm not really worried about short-term blips whether the pump comes back in Q4 or it comes back in Q1 or even Q2. uh they're doing remote fixes on it and that's kind of the key factor. Uh also the the manufacturing facility being back online th those are some key things but honestly I just hope the prices stay lower for longer so I can put newer clients in it at good prices. Uh, Matt Bond, can look at Tyler Tech H T. Yeah. The good news is it's a great business. The bad news is it's at a very high price. So, you're not going to get a double on this anytime soon. And if we can't get a double in three plus years, we don't commit $1. So, I think it's fine in the long term. I wouldn't buy it at this price. Uh price is key. It's not just buying a good business that has good fundamentals. It's buying it at the right time and then sitting on your hands. Uh Hannes Brands, I get this every couple of weeks. Yeah, I mean, it's a commodity business. It runs in cycles. Looks like it might be recovering for a minute. It'll probably get bought out is what's going to happen. So, um, revenues continue to decline. Gross margins are doing a little bit better. Probably. Okay. I'd like to see free cash flow accelerate a little bit, but if you want to play in the, you know, if you want to play there, go for it. It's not It's not a great It's It's not a tremendous business. Thoughts on Chipotle? So, it's come down 50% or 30%. Uh, I think it's a I think it might be early with Chipotle, but let me just check. And free cash flow's been stalled for three years. There's nothing to really dislike here. Let me just see something here. I think Chipotle is going to be fine. The question is, are you a buyer at 40? Are you a buyer at 30? I don't know if we ever see 30, but you know, when a Momo stock breaks like that, it just takes a lot of time to get new institutional buyers. because they all have to get out of it like the herd. I have no problem with this. I mean, if you buy it at 40 and it goes to 30, buy more. Um, but I don't think it's one we're going to participate in. Jimmy Jones Three thoughts on the Baxter lawsuit. There's always lawsuits in this. Whenever a stock goes down, ambulance chasers jump on it. I'm not worried about that. Carolyn Hollyy, been listening for two years. Wisdom he shares unvaluable. Single mom of three young boys. You're helping me build not only generational wealth, but also informational wealth. Um, currently making a poster to put in my seven-year-old's room with the title, "How to never be the best at something based on your what actions would I take to guarantee I never become a scratch golfer. He likes to be oppositional, and this approach really fits his personality. I never thought I'd learn life lessons from an investing podcast, but you, sir, have been sharing worldly wisdom for years, and now you're helping me be a better parent." Uh, that's really amazing, Caroline. um super excited for you and uh that's an incredible job to raise three kids on your own. So uh keep at it. You're doing the right thing and I'm sure they're going to just be phenomenal. So um thanks for sharing that. Sam Abbott, new listener, only the past two years and I've learned so much. I know you're very modest, but down here in Sydney, you're a legend in our household. Thank you so much for your education. Uh you're welcome and uh very very grateful. uh for your support. You have helped us financially start a well overdue house extension costing AUD 500,000. So you have changed our lives. Wow. Thank you. That is unbelievable. Thank you. Uh tonight on the way home from work, I listened to Jen Van E macro market outlook on the thoughtful money with Adam Tagert. End of the podcast. There were three things that were very relevant. Bob Baba, he recommended it a year ago. Yeah, I play golf with his number two guy. I've been pitching it at the club for three years. Uh shared a chart showing electricity in China was half a US. Explained the advantage baba may going forward. Gone up considerably in the last year. Opinion follows trend. Of course, he was recommending it last week. Uh but smart guy, great guy, great great business they have over there. Um matter of fact, I put his partner on the board of Ridgefield uh pension commission when I left. Uh good guy. another lab putter user. Number two, US budget deficit forecasting the fact things are getting better despite the narrative in the mass media. We agree we covered that data. Uh could signal a India changing bankruptcy legislation could signal a positive step for investing going forward in India. Yeah, I agree. Um I just think it's not time right now. I know you're exceptionally busy. It's for the community. Yeah, Sam, I think you I think you got it spot on. Um know those guys. They're great. And um what can I say? I agree with Baba. I just agree with them more when it was 60, not it's 160. Uh hey Tom, absolute honor to be able to contact you for opinion on advice. Country risk aside, TeeO Telecom Argentina looks ready to move. Good fundamentals from what I could see. Bessant just has to get MLE over the election finish line. Uh, PS, uh, that's from Michael. Oh, PS. Working hard on getting that cool million for you to manage. You'll get there, my man. Thank you. Uh, TEO. Yeah, these are usually like dividend payers. Yeah, I mean I think you're right. It's got a you know mobile telecom. Yeah, I mean these are usually kind of a quasi monopoly in those countries. So if you want to buy it here, have at it. Uh what's the dividend yield? 2.6%. Usually they're higher than that. Let's see if there's anything wrong with the balance sheet. current portion of long-term debt, 876 million, 2.5 billion. They got 312 million of cash, 700 million of receivables. I don't know. I think they're I think it's okay. I think they're better uses of cash. It's It's a lowquality business. Uh, now uh, it's going to work as a trade. I wouldn't really want to own the whole company. Rory McMullen. Hey Tom, loving the podcast. Kodiak Gas Services. Thanks, Rory. Okay, Rory. Let's take a look. We tend to focus on companies that have been public for a very long time. So we have a lot of data to assimilate through many many different cycles. It's obviously looks good. Revenues are growing, free cash flow. So on this type of thing, you've got to really know cooling infrastructure. You really got to know who the CEO is and what is his track record of success and how they ultimately do buy investors and board members. Yeah. So, I I would just figure out who's the CEO, what has he or she done in the past for shareholders, and let me just see here if they're on the right track. Uh yeah, this I'm not crazy about. They keep increasing the share count. Let's see. Stockbased compensation. They're being a little pigish. I really don't like that. That's why you're going to find probably he's been involved in a few of these and screwed shareholders in the past. Um 13 to 40, but check it. I don't know. I don't I don't know the company well enough, but you know, you had a five bagger, it pulled back a little bit. I This is not the type of thing I chase. I just rather boring businesses that can double and triple over a few years versus chasing these. Thoughts on Target? Eric, we cover this one every week. I think it's a buy. We're not in it. Um, that may change, it may not, but if I had to buy a retailer, I'd probably be looking hard at that one. H A I N Hayne Celestial. Yeah, this thing is something else, huh? Revenues have just been going down for 10 years. Um, it's not ideal. What are their brands that are just so terrible? company was incorporated in 1993. I mean, there's no sign of improvement. It just keeps going down and down and down. I think I'd stay away from this one unless you can listen to the calls and understand what is the catalyst for change or if there's a new CEO. But, uh, been restructuring, cutting costs, insider buys the last six months. I mean, I guess the number one thing you got to do here is figure out if they're going to go broke. So, 57 million of cash, 154 million of receivables, and $700 million of debt. I mean, the market is basically telling you they think it has a chance to go bankrupt. I think it does too. I don't think it will. And if it doesn't, yeah, you're going to get a 10 bagger, 15 bagger pretty quick, but that one is not clear. Um, let me just see. You mentioned a lot of insider buying on this. There's a lot of insider buying at Tupperware at the bottom, too. And they got roasted. Man, this thing is just destroyed. I mean, this is this is penny antie stuff. $50,000 a stock, $100,000 a stock. That's a joke. Uh curious on your thoughts on Cracker Barrel. I think I'd probably rather rather buy Cracker Barrel than I would Hayne. And the thing about Cracker Barrel and even Denny's, they've got the best locations right off the highways. Marcus Lonus was telling me they got an inventory problem in their stores. Um, I mean, the big problem with this one is I think the CEO is a and they got to get rid of her. And once they do that, the stock will start to go back up. So, I'll leave that as is. That's opinion, not certainty. Don't know her. But, all right. Phipe Andrew Pinkos FMC. I like FMC. We don't own it. Uh, Core Laboratories. No, this one is a This is a value trap. Tends to be a value trap. Let's see if it's improving, though. Maybe it's time to be open-minded on this one. Yeah, I don't see any signs of real turn. Let's see if they're going to live long enough for the whole thing to turn and get rich in spite of themselves. Not a lot of cash there, buddies. What do you got in terms of debt? 141 million of debt. 25 cash and receivables. What's happening with free cash? I mean, this might be okay. I I I think you I think this one might be okay. I think I think you're okay, Mike. I wouldn't own it because I wouldn't buy the whole company. I think it's too risky. But I think your odds are in your favor. Chuck Carter, been listening since you were banging the table back on Baba. Interested in your thoughts on Eastman Chemical EMN. Yeah, I think this is probably okay. Yeah, I think this is okay. You saw Dow do well today. start to recover a little bit. Thank you, Chuck. We got a lot this week. Uh Todd form a light employee benefits software and you just have to be damn sure that they can't get AIed out of the game. Why did revenues drop from three billion down to two billion? See if that's correct. Turn on capital. I This is not looking like um I think you're digging in the dumpster and you're going to wind up with fleas. I mean, what the hell is this that the share count just keeps going up? I I don't like people like this. Skip. Uh, pass on that. Tell them to stop issuing shares and focus on selling software. Harry Gordon, been enjoying your video cast found recently. I like the data driven approach and you clearly put a lot of work into it. Thank you. You um you recently suggested that I should ask my psychic for advice. Unfortunately, my psychic closed up shop last week due to unforeseen circumstances. What to do? Okay, thank you. Appreciate that. Thank you for the support. Ruben Fernandez, thoughts on te Texas Pacific land. Um yeah, I think this is one of these trust things. I don't like these. Uh but they're fine. TPL. Yeah, I think it's okay. This is a great business at a good price, but I need a double or triple in a few years. I'm not There's no way I'm getting it off that. Jack, oh, he's looking for tips. Uh, a college student. Just go to youtube.com uh under hedge fund tips and search University of Bristol. I do a whole hour on what college students should do if they want to get into the business. Uh Legan and Platt from Michael Silver. I like this one by the way. It's a play on housing. Yeah, I think it's okay. Not without risk, but okay. Uh, Muhammad Otibi, hey Tom, thanks for your generosity. You're welcome. Thank you for your support. Have you ever Have you ever in your career sold and went full cash? What's your opinion on those who do it? Asking about your investment philosophy. No, that's a that's a that's a Mugs game. Uh, we'll go decent amounts of cash. Um, but not full cash because if you think you're going to predict and risk on, risk off, all those guys get wiped out. Um, Brad J, very grateful for all you do. Love the pod and the website. Uh, reading balance sheets we do in the ask me anything questions. So, just follow along. Go through the last couple hundred ask me anything. You'll learn everything you need to know. Uh this is from uh Jack in the Box. Yeah, we like that one, Brad. If we had to buy a restaurant, we'd definitely be looking there. Max Moore, when's it okay for a company to issue shares? If they're buying a company, if they're if their stock is trading at 30 times and they're buying a company with equivalent growth at 10 times, then it's accretive, I love it. Okay. If they But if they're just issuing shares to giving up ownership for subpar businesses or expensive prices so management can keep their jobs for another two years to integrate the companies, I don't like it. If they're just paying themselves with your money uh excessively, I don't like it. If they issue shares at the low to raise capital because they got themselves in a a bad situation due to bad management, not interested. So there are rarely good times to issue equity. Uh unless you can buy a lot of great businesses at tremendously accreative prices and you can do it rapidly. Alex K, thanks for your amazing insights each week. Look forward to shared with a lot of my friends. Thank you. Could we look at FDP? Is this fact set FTP? No. Fresh Monty. Oh, produce uh stocks done nothing for 20 years. I don't think it should be a public company. I think it should be a private company that pays dividends to its owners. It's not a growth business. Yeah, it's just revenues are basically the same. I think this is just a bad place to park capital. Uh but you know, you you might not get hurt, but you're not going to make a lot. Stephen H. Hotton, appreciate all you do. Uh how do you do put put spreads for your clients? That's for client information only. The best thing you can do in the um member section of the free trial on the website uh there are a couple options books I recommend that'll teach you the black scholes formula and how to price options and that'll give you a starting point. Um and then the rest is going to be experience just from years and years of doing it. Landon H interested in your thoughts on gel. I think that's a good one. I've looked at it a few times and I think it's going to be a good housing play as rates come down. Um, but you know, again, not without risk. It's probably something Brad Jacobs should be looking at. Um, let's see here. H, no bueno. So, we got to now there's something going on here that we got to figure out why our revenue is down so dramatically. Why is negative cash free cash flow so negative and what are they doing to change it? Let's see. On a quarterly basis, no improvement. Uh let's see on the revenues on a quarterly basis. Tiny improvement. I I would probably stay away from this for the time being. Let's see. 131 million in cash, half a billion in receivables, and long-term debt. They paid down 700 million. Still has a decent amount of debt. Yeah, I don't like this trend. What What are they doing and why isn't it working? Composite materials, doors, building products. I would just watch this one as rates start to come down because there could be a huge opportunity here. Home builders are starting to get optimistic. So, there's a lot of leverage in this, but there's just zero sign of a turn yet. So, um I think your thinking is correct. I just think you need to see a few signs of execution and tailwinds before you take the gamble. Yeah, you might have something here, Landon. I just think uh James Damus thoughts on Riley. I wouldn't touch it. Terry Ken View. This is the Tylenol thing with the pregnant women. Eventually it'll be fine. I wouldn't play it at the moment. K Vue E. I think they're just going to have I mean, if they if they can prove a link, it's going to be a problem. It's just going to be pretty hairy. I I I don't want to touch this one. It It's just like there they're easier ways to make money. You don't have to jump into the fire and hope you don't get burned. Uh I know you're big in Baba. What do you think of JD lagging behind the China rally? I mean, they're all going to work over time. I think JD is the lowest quality. I I wouldn't want to play that. Um, but it'll it'll probably go up with all of China as everyone starts to chase at the top. Uh, favorite. Thank Hey Tom, thanks for all the insights. Amazing pod. Thursday is now my favorite weekday. Uh, can you look at HNST? I think that's from last week. Let's just make sure and then we can move on. Oh, the honest company. This is uh Jessica Alba's thing. Uh I think this these are more fads. Let me just see what the business looks like. HNST. This thing will probably just be bought. Revenues keep growing. Free cash flow is negative. Nah, not for me.
