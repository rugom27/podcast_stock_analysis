[00:00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:00:02] Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:00:05] 289th videocast podcast for the week
[00:00:07] ending April 30th, 2025. We're a day
[00:00:11] early this week. Got a lot of great
[00:00:12] stuff to cover, but as always, family
[00:00:15] first. This was Mimi with Flavor Flave
[00:00:19] last night. Uh Mimi attended the
[00:00:21] premiere of Woman of the Water, a
[00:00:24] documentary about USA water polo and the
[00:00:27] journey to the Olympics. She met Flavor
[00:00:29] Flave and ended up on his Twitter page.
[00:00:31] She also met the US water polo Olympic
[00:00:34] coach Alex along with top stars Ashley
[00:00:37] Johnson, Maddie Muscleman, and Rachel
[00:00:41] Fatel. Meanwhile, Annabelle had a big
[00:00:43] big weekend as well. She smashed the 400
[00:00:46] meter freestyle Nova team record by 8
[00:00:48] seconds and also broke the 200 meter
[00:00:51] freestyle Nova team record set in 1995
[00:00:55] by Kristen Caverly who competed in the
[00:00:58] 2004 Olympics. Last but not least,
[00:01:01] Annabelle and her relay teammates
[00:01:03] crushed the 200 meter medley relay and
[00:01:05] set a new national age group record,
[00:01:08] beating the previous record by over two
[00:01:11] seconds. So exciting weekend. There's
[00:01:14] Flavor Flave who's done an incredible
[00:01:16] amount for women's war polo raising
[00:01:19] awareness, a champion donating the whole
[00:01:21] thing. That's with uh some Olympians
[00:01:24] there. Uh more Olympians, the
[00:01:29] USA water polo Olympic coach. Uh this

[00:03:36] want to thank Stephen Frampton, my
[00:03:39] incredible video editor. He's been a
[00:03:41] huge podcast fan for two years. He cuts
[00:03:43] up all the videos uh and appearances and
[00:03:46] podcasts, puts them on X, puts them on
[00:03:48] LinkedIn, puts them on Tik Tok, puts
[00:03:50] them on Instagram, puts them everywhere
[00:03:52] they can be put, YouTube. and he said,
[00:03:55] "Look, you're getting a lot of comments
[00:03:56] of people who want merch. Why don't you
[00:03:58] just do a merch store? So, why don't you
[00:04:00] just do a merch store?" And he did it.
[00:04:02] And uh so it's live. I ordered all this
[00:04:05] stuff and I'm wearing it today. Here's
[00:04:06] the golf shirt. And by the way, this is
[00:04:08] not that ironed on garbage where you uh
[00:04:12] you know, put it in the washing machine
[00:04:13] and it's gone. This is sewn in
[00:04:15] embroidered baby. Hedge fun tips. Uh
[00:04:18] this is the golf shirt. It has hedge fun
[00:04:20] tips on this HFT on the side and the
[00:04:22] side. And this hat is incredible. I'm
[00:04:24] old school. Like a lot of the new hats,
[00:04:26] they have like these super
[00:04:29] high, you know, not the beaks, the the
[00:04:32] front part. I like them where they just

[00:04:51] If you live in California by the beach
[00:04:52] and there's always wind, everyone wears
[00:04:54] hoodies. Now I understand why. Uh I wear
[00:04:56] that thing pretty much every day. And
[00:04:58] the golf shirt and the hat and the
[00:05:00] t-shirt I wear not every day, but every
[00:05:03] few days. And the mug I use obviously
[00:05:05] every day. It says on one side, "Price
[00:05:07] is what you pay, value is what you get."
[00:05:09] And then on the other side it's got the

[00:05:41] that's the story there. Thank you,
[00:05:43] Stephen, for that great idea. Want to
[00:05:46] thank Christian Dagger and the great Stu
[00:05:50] Vney for having me on Fox Business this
[00:05:52] morning to talk Trump put, Fed put,
[00:05:56] Treasury put, earnings, and more. We're
[00:05:58] going to listen in here. Let's see the
[00:06:00] progress of the selloff. Now, we're down
[00:06:03] 700 points on the Dow. That's 1.7%. The
[00:06:06] Nasdaq is down 457, 2.6%.
[00:06:10] Tom Hayes joining us this morning to
[00:06:12] cover the markets. All right, Tom, you
[00:06:13] know the story. The economy contracted
[00:06:15] slightly in the first quarter. Core
[00:06:17] inflation ticked up. That's not a good
[00:06:20] environment for stocks, is it?
[00:06:23] Well, I think you have a couple of
[00:06:24] things happening here. One, you've got
[00:06:26] the Trump put. If you remember on April
[00:06:28] 8th, he said now is a good time to buy.
[00:06:30] That was the bottom of the market. This
[00:06:31] morning, he said, "Be patient. America
[00:06:34] is going to boom." You probably don't
[00:06:36] say that if you if you don't know that a
[00:06:38] trade deal announcement is coming uh as
[00:06:40] it relates to the ADP numbers, the
[00:06:43] inflation numbers, the GDP numbers. All
[00:06:46] that does is really set up the Fed as a
[00:06:50] second potential put. You know, May is
[00:06:52] off the table for a cut, but with these
[00:06:55] numbers, and we're going to see more
[00:06:56] information on Friday with the jobs
[00:06:58] report, it may bring the Fed back in
[00:07:01] play. And finally, the Treasury was out
[00:07:03] this morning saying they may want to
[00:07:05] enhance their Treasury buyback program
[00:07:08] to lower long-term borrowing costs. So,
[00:07:11] they're trying to hit it three different
[00:07:13] ways while they negotiate through this
[00:07:14] process. All right, Microsoft and Meta,
[00:07:17] they report after the bell. Let's take
[00:07:18] them one at a time. What do you see for
[00:07:20] Microsoft?
[00:07:22] Expectations are high. 8% earnings
[00:07:24] growth, 10% revenue growth. The whole
[00:07:27] key is going to be guidance on AI spend
[00:07:29] and Azure cloud growth. They're expected
[00:07:32] to grow their cloud business by low to
[00:07:35] mid30%. If you get that and you get
[00:07:37] reasonable guidance, Microsoft could
[00:07:39] rebound here. But if they confirm what
[00:07:42] we've been seeing about the lease
[00:07:43] cancellations and pulling back on spend,
[00:07:46] it might see some softness. So, we'll
[00:07:47] see what happens after the bell on
[00:07:48] Microsoft. All right. Tell me what you
[00:07:50] expect from Meta in 30 seconds.
[00:07:53] Yeah, Meta expected high expectations,
[00:07:55] up 13% earnings, up 13% revenue. The
[00:07:58] whole key here is going to be ad
[00:08:01] revenue. 10% of their ad revenue comes
[00:08:04] from China sellers, which is going to be
[00:08:06] a little subdued at the end of the first
[00:08:08] quarter, severely subdued for the second
[00:08:11] quarter. So, let's see what their
[00:08:12] guidance is after the bell. All right,
[00:08:13] Tom, thanks for joining us this morning.
[00:08:15] We will see you again later. All right,
[00:08:17] Google's chief executive
[00:08:19] and we're back. And then want to thank
[00:08:23] Audrey Tay for having me on CNA Asia,
[00:08:27] uh, Channel News Asia, which is
[00:08:28] basically the BBC of Singapore,
[00:08:30] broadcast all over Asia. Uh, made some
[00:08:33] incredible contacts through that. And,
[00:08:36] um, she had me both on the radio show,
[00:08:38] which we're going to play now, and she
[00:08:40] also had me on a TV show, but they don't
[00:08:42] have the TV link ready yet. So that'll
[00:08:45] be posted on the website tomorrow. 100
[00:08:47] days since US President Donald Trump
[00:08:49] took office again. We want to just talk
[00:08:51] about that for a bit. What's Wall
[00:08:53] Street's assessment of his first 100
[00:08:55] days? Well, look, I I think that uh we
[00:09:00] have a lot of things happening all at
[00:09:02] once. You know, the old saying, you have
[00:09:04] to break a few eggs to get an omelet. I
[00:09:06] mean, this is what he ran on and this is
[00:09:08] what he's delivering. But I will say I
[00:09:11] think the market is somewhat comforted
[00:09:13] by his flexibility
[00:09:16] uh first and foremost with the 90-day
[00:09:18] pause uh more recently with the auto
[00:09:21] tariff mitigation or moderation over the
[00:09:24] over the next two years that that was
[00:09:26] announced uh this week. Uh and and it
[00:09:29] feels like we do have some semblance of
[00:09:32] a put in the market. namely uh Trump
[00:09:36] said on April 8th now is the time to buy
[00:09:39] on uh Truth Social and uh that marked
[00:09:43] the low in in the markets down 19% and
[00:09:45] it it's m pretty much recovered about
[00:09:47] half of the losses today. He said on his
[00:09:50] social media platform America will boom
[00:09:53] just be patient. Uh so it's showing that
[00:09:56] he's paying attention to markets. I
[00:09:58] think markets like to see that. I think
[00:10:00] the other thing to your point um about
[00:10:02] the economic numbers today uh the GDP
[00:10:06] yes the headline was negative uh.3 a lot
[00:10:09] of that was inventory loading ahead of
[00:10:11] tariffs so x that you're probably at
[00:10:13] plus 3.0 know, but that that negative
[00:10:16] number plus the the week ADP jobs number
[00:10:20] 62,000 versus 120,000 and then the PCE
[00:10:24] inflation coming in at 2.3%, the lowest
[00:10:27] since November. I think all of these
[00:10:28] point to some level of slowing that
[00:10:31] brings in the potentiality of a Fed put
[00:10:35] as the second put me meaning the odds of
[00:10:38] them cutting uh in June are now up to
[00:10:41] about
[00:10:42] 65%. Uh and then finally, the Treasury
[00:10:45] was out this morning talking about an uh
[00:10:48] enhancements to their buyback program,
[00:10:51] which is uh uh pretty important because
[00:10:54] they want to bring down long-term
[00:10:56] borrowing rates. It's just a kind of
[00:10:58] fancy way of saying they're going to be
[00:10:59] in the market potentially buying more
[00:11:01] bonds, and we know what that looks like
[00:11:03] historically. So those three things
[00:11:05] point to yes, they're making these bold
[00:11:08] moves that are kind of disruptive and
[00:11:10] causing volatility, but they're paying
[00:11:12] attention and they don't want it to fall
[00:11:13] over the cliff. And it's earning season
[00:11:16] now. Before we get into the specific
[00:11:18] results, though, give us an overview for
[00:11:21] 2025. Thomas,
[00:11:23] yeah, look, I I think that uh the bad
[00:11:26] news is estimates have been coming down,
[00:11:28] okay, down 3.6% year to date on the S&P
[00:11:32] 500. Uh that means from $275 to
[00:11:36] $265. That's, you know, 20 times 2025
[00:11:39] estimates is pretty rich. However, uh
[00:11:43] like all good estimates, they're backend
[00:11:44] loaded. 2026 estimates have been holding
[00:11:47] up at
[00:11:48] $32, which means right now we're at, you
[00:11:51] know, 18.5 times next year's earnings.
[00:11:53] The 10-year average is 18.3 times. We've
[00:11:57] had 36% of the companies report maybe a
[00:12:00] little more now uh this week over 10%
[00:12:02] earnings growth. So the world is not
[00:12:04] ending. I mean uh Lutnik Leutnik was out
[00:12:07] there yesterday saying I have a deal in
[00:12:09] my back pocket. It just has to be uh
[00:12:12] approved. Uh the administration
[00:12:14] continues to meet with uh uh CEOs like
[00:12:18] Walmart, Target, Home Depot. So they're
[00:12:21] getting the proper feedback and and the
[00:12:23] most important thing I think is that
[00:12:25] sentiment has been fully flushed out.
[00:12:27] Hedge funds and CTAs were record sellers
[00:12:30] on on April 8th in the hole at the worst
[00:12:33] possible time. So they are going to be
[00:12:35] forced buyers as we get any semblance of
[00:12:38] good news with deal flow and if Lutnik
[00:12:41] is correct and we get an announcement uh
[00:12:44] you're going to get a lot of people
[00:12:45] forced to buy. Uh Thomas, now let's talk
[00:12:47] about matter and Microsoft. Um results
[00:12:50] did not disappoint earlier on as well.
[00:12:52] Uh we heard from Sarah uh sharing with
[00:12:54] us uh Microsoft beat on both the top and
[00:12:57] bottom lines with its zero cloud
[00:13:00] business uh exceeded analysts estimates.
[00:13:03] Meta reporting uh rising revenue and
[00:13:06] profit helped by Instagram and Facebook
[00:13:08] ads. Were you expecting these results as
[00:13:10] well for these two companies? Well,
[00:13:12] look, we we really didn't know what to
[00:13:14] expect because you know going in
[00:13:16] guidance was pretty nice. I mean, you
[00:13:18] know, people were expecting earning uh
[00:13:19] revenues up 8%. They came in up 13% on
[00:13:24] Microsoft. They were expecting earnings
[00:13:25] up uh 10%. It came in at 18%. Uh people
[00:13:30] were a little worried about capex. That
[00:13:31] was up 53% year-on-year. There were all
[00:13:34] those rumors that they were, you know,
[00:13:36] cancelling leases and all that stuff.
[00:13:37] Well, it wasn't reflected in the
[00:13:39] numbers. and Azure the cloud was up 33%
[00:13:42] and they increased the guidance to 34 to
[00:13:44] 35%
[00:13:46] uh next quarter and they raised revenue
[00:13:48] guidance 1.25 25 billion. So, uh, in the
[00:13:51] kingdom of Microsoft, uh, pe people are
[00:13:53] still smiling. But it's not so great
[00:13:56] news for Qualcomm, isn't it? Because
[00:13:58] their revenue forecast missed estimates.
[00:14:00] Thomas, what happened there? Well, look,
[00:14:03] it always looks darkest before dawn. I
[00:14:05] mean, semiconductors, what people forgot
[00:14:08] is a very cyclical business. We're
[00:14:10] probably at or near some of the the the
[00:14:12] troughs in the uh semiconductor cycle. I
[00:14:15] think there's going to be opportunity,
[00:14:16] but it's going to take a few quarters.
[00:14:18] Uh we were at peak exuberance just a
[00:14:20] short while ago. Uh so it's uh it's a
[00:14:24] it's a stock pickers market and I know
[00:14:25] that sounds cliche, but it it really is.
[00:14:28] I mean, you look at Meta uh also crushed
[00:14:30] it. They didn't have as aggressive uh
[00:14:32] guidance. Their their revenue guidance
[00:14:34] is in line with what we had been
[00:14:36] expecting, but they took capex up 8
[00:14:38] billion and people were worried about
[00:14:39] capex. Ad revenues up 41.3 billion. uh
[00:14:42] were were 41.3 versus 40.4. That kind of
[00:14:46] tells us that the consumer is okay.
[00:14:48] People were worried about that. Daily
[00:14:49] active users 3.43 billion versus 3.39.
[00:14:53] So, you know, the rumors of the economic
[00:14:56] demise have been greatly exaggerated. I
[00:14:58] think we're we're chugging along. If the
[00:15:00] administration continues to show
[00:15:01] rationality and gets some reasonable
[00:15:03] deals and gets the rebalancing that
[00:15:06] they're looking for, uh I think there's
[00:15:08] a lot of pent up strength. Uh the risk
[00:15:12] is if they drag it out too long, people
[00:15:15] will lose the hope and once the
[00:15:17] confidence is gone, it's it's very hard
[00:15:19] to get back. And that would be a shame
[00:15:20] because all the money that they want to
[00:15:23] save on Doge and uh and uh sensible
[00:15:27] government spending, if you wind up in a
[00:15:28] recession, it's going to cost you a lot
[00:15:29] more to get it get you out of a
[00:15:31] recession with stimulus, etc., and the
[00:15:33] the declining uh tax revenues. So,
[00:15:35] they're threading a needle here. I think
[00:15:37] they're gonna be able to do it, but uh
[00:15:40] certainly pushing it up to the edge.
[00:15:42] Similar expectations you think for Apple
[00:15:45] and Amazon because they are expected to
[00:15:48] release uh their earnings uh report
[00:15:50] tomorrow after the closing bell. Yeah,
[00:15:53] look, I think rearview mirror, I think
[00:15:54] they're going to have great earnings and
[00:15:55] great revenues. The the question is
[00:15:57] going to be uh you know, a huge question
[00:16:00] for Apple as it relates to how they're
[00:16:02] thinking about China, both production
[00:16:04] and consumption. uh as it relates to
[00:16:07] Amazon, you've got a lot of Chinese
[00:16:09] sellers on the Amazon website. Uh so
[00:16:12] people are going to want to get some
[00:16:13] color around that. Meta alluded to that
[00:16:16] uh in their kind of talking about you
[00:16:19] know 10% of their ad revenues come from
[00:16:21] Chinese sellers. So we want to know we
[00:16:23] want to understand that from Amazon but
[00:16:25] Amazon is uh is a beast. I mean if you
[00:16:28] get an opportunity to buy it lower you
[00:16:30] take advantage of it. if you if you
[00:16:32] don't uh that's just the kind of
[00:16:34] business it is when the when the uh
[00:16:36] e-commerce side is a little slow, their
[00:16:38] cloud tends to do really well. Uh and
[00:16:41] they've got a phenomenal business. So
[00:16:43] we, you know, we'll we'll see. Are we
[00:16:45] going to get beats across the board?
[00:16:47] Microsoft Meta, uh Amazon, Amazon,
[00:16:50] Apple, we hope the market could use
[00:16:52] that. It looks, you know, a lot of these
[00:16:54] look pretty oversold. uh we just want to
[00:16:56] understand the guidance and looking at
[00:16:57] some of the capex
[00:16:59] uh guidance from Microsoft and from Meta
[00:17:03] holding in and raising capex it kind of
[00:17:06] points to positive things happening. I
[00:17:08] think probably the the one that is is um
[00:17:12] going to have people on edge is going to
[00:17:14] be Apple. We want to get some comfort
[00:17:16] around Apple uh with um you know things
[00:17:20] changing the environment changing a
[00:17:22] little bit for them particularly in
[00:17:23] China. Thomas, let's look ahead. I have
[00:17:26] you gaze into your crystal ball for a
[00:17:28] bit. I want to talk to you about your
[00:17:30] outlook on US earnings for
[00:17:33] 2026 and which sectors might be your
[00:17:36] most favored.
[00:17:38] Well, I think that, you know, as we get
[00:17:41] closer to 2026, you're going to start to
[00:17:44] see which sectors
[00:17:47] um are are looking like they're going to
[00:17:49] have growth. I would say there are a
[00:17:52] couple things that I'm paying attention
[00:17:53] to. Number one is uh materials have been
[00:17:58] beaten down. I think they're going to
[00:17:59] get a rebound once we get through all
[00:18:01] this tariff stuff. Okay. So, it's a
[00:18:02] little early for that. But I also like
[00:18:04] healthcare. Healthcare's got earnings
[00:18:06] growth. It's it it has the benefits of
[00:18:09] being defensive. It has the benefits
[00:18:10] that it's sold off enough. Particularly
[00:18:12] biotech. We've had a new FDA
[00:18:14] commissioner uh appointed Dr. Macker
[00:18:17] from John's Hopkins. He wants to focus
[00:18:19] on innovation uh and streamline
[00:18:22] streamlining regulation. So a
[00:18:25] userfriendly review process in English
[00:18:27] all that means is we're going to get
[00:18:29] more drugs and we're going to get more
[00:18:30] deal approval a favorable FTC and you
[00:18:35] know uh the pharma companies large
[00:18:36] pharma in the United States they have
[00:18:38] record cash on their balance sheets. The
[00:18:40] problem is they have no innovation and
[00:18:43] they've got a lot of patent cliffs. So
[00:18:44] rather than build it and take many
[00:18:46] years, they can just buy it uh because
[00:18:49] most of these biotech companies are
[00:18:51] trading at uh you know decade low
[00:18:53] valuations and uh and that's what what
[00:18:56] we're going to be seeing. So when you
[00:18:58] see a lot of deals and you see a lot of
[00:18:59] drug approvals, you see a lot of growth
[00:19:01] and you see a lot of money start to
[00:19:02] chase it. So, I think the surprise of
[00:19:04] the next 12 to 24 months is biotech's
[00:19:06] going to do exceptionally well. And I
[00:19:08] think some of the medical device
[00:19:09] companies once they get a sense of the
[00:19:11] landscape, they're defensive, but
[00:19:13] they've really been left for dead.
[00:19:15] They're highquality businesses. I think
[00:19:17] you're going to start to see spending
[00:19:18] ramp up. Um, you know, one in particular
[00:19:21] we like is Baxter because they've been
[00:19:23] able to delever their balance sheet.
[00:19:25] They sold their slowing grow slow
[00:19:27] growing kidney business uh for 3.8
[00:19:30] billion to Carlilele. they'll pay down
[00:19:32] some debt and their multiple is probably
[00:19:34] going to rerate back to more normalized
[00:19:36] levels from 11 times back to 15 times uh
[00:19:39] as they focus on the IV business, the
[00:19:41] nutrition business, uh medical devices
[00:19:44] and and their pharma. So, uh the next
[00:19:46] catalyst for that company uh uh will be
[00:19:49] a new CEO announcement uh and uh you've
[00:19:53] got time to to own it. They're going to
[00:19:55] report earnings. I don't know what
[00:19:56] earnings will be tomorrow, but if you
[00:19:58] get weakness, it's probably a time to
[00:19:59] get involved. Uh, in our opinion, not
[00:20:01] advice. Thomas, we will be monitoring
[00:20:04] the developments very closely here as
[00:20:06] well on CN 938. And we, it's been a fun
[00:20:08] chat this morning. We hope to have you
[00:20:10] back. And when we do, uh, we look
[00:20:12] forward to more of your insights and
[00:20:14] perspectives. My pleasure. Thanks so
[00:20:16] much for having me. And that was Thomas
[00:20:18] Hayes, chairman and managing member at
[00:20:20] Grid Hill Capital.
[00:20:23] And we're back. Quote of the week. There
[00:20:26] are no bad days in the market. When the
[00:20:28] market is down, you've got bargains. And
[00:20:29] it's a lovely to think about what you're
[00:20:31] buying at low prices. When the market's
[00:20:33] up, the bargains have gone, but you're
[00:20:36] rich. That's Bruce Greenwald. Uh he was
[00:20:39] a professor at Colombia Business School.
[00:20:43] Here's uh Seth Clarman. There's no such
[00:20:45] thing as a value company. Price is all
[00:20:47] that matters. At some price, an asset is
[00:20:49] a buy. At another, it's a hold. And at
[00:20:51] another, it's a sell. That's why we
[00:20:54] never enter an investment without
[00:20:55] knowing where we're getting out. Warren
[00:20:58] Buffett, investment students need only
[00:21:00] two well-taught courses. Number one, how
[00:21:02] to value a business. And number two, how
[00:21:05] to think about market prices. Treat the
[00:21:08] fluctuations as your friend, not as your
[00:21:11] enemy. Now, on to data. Retail is only
[00:21:15] emotionally very downbeat on stocks.
[00:21:19] Allocations have barely dropped.
[00:21:21] Sentiment has been crushed but
[00:21:23] allocations are still up. Very similar
[00:21:26] to kind of what you saw uh since co
[00:21:31] professionals have been selling in the
[00:21:32] whole retail have been holding tight and
[00:21:34] doing very well. This is the Ryex bull
[00:21:37] bear ratio. You can see it's completely
[00:21:40] off the charts um bearish. Okay. And
[00:21:45] that's usually what you see at these
[00:21:46] bounces. that's across the board
[00:21:48] institutional. Um, and this is off the
[00:21:51] charts. So that that you know the thing
[00:21:54] the the number one thing you need to
[00:21:55] know about our situation is
[00:21:59] that institutions and hedge funds and
[00:22:02] CTAs record sold in the hole at the lows
[00:22:06] on April 9th or April 8th I think it
[00:22:09] was. Uh where are my
[00:22:13] notes? Anyway, the point
[00:22:16] is they record sold at the exact wrong
[00:22:19] time and what they are praying for is a
[00:22:23] retest of the lows, okay? Because they
[00:22:26] missed this move that retraced half the
[00:22:28] losses. Um, and usually praying doesn't
[00:22:31] work in investing. Uh, it frequently
[00:22:34] never works. So, if we start to see the
[00:22:38] deal that Lutnik referenced and we
[00:22:41] continue to see the type of flexibility
[00:22:43] we've seen on auto tariffs, on the
[00:22:45] 90-day pause, on other things, uh these
[00:22:49] guys are going to be forced buyers,
[00:22:52] okay, into any positive tape bomb like
[00:22:55] we saw good earnings after the bell, uh
[00:22:58] which we discussed on the radio show and
[00:23:00] more durable goods, new orders,
[00:23:03] non-defense aircraft and parts.
[00:23:05] through the roof. You know, we got a
[00:23:08] negative GDP print
[00:23:10] of.3. You take out the inventory loading
[00:23:13] because why? It's C plus I plus G plus
[00:23:17] X, consumption, investment, government
[00:23:20] spending, which was down, and uh net
[00:23:23] exports, which everyone was importing
[00:23:25] ahead of the tariffs. Um, and you would
[00:23:28] wind up with plus 3% GDP instead of
[00:23:31] negative.3. That said, you still have a
[00:23:33] negative GDP growth. So, the
[00:23:34] administration has to beware not to get
[00:23:37] two consecutive ne negative quarters,
[00:23:39] meaning tidy up and get some deals
[00:23:41] announced. So, you get these forced
[00:23:43] buyers. Consumer confidence comes back.
[00:23:45] Earnings keeps going. Earnings are up
[00:23:47] 10% year-on-year, but that's backward
[00:23:49] looking. Guidance has been okay, but a
[00:23:52] little bit dicey depending on the
[00:23:54] company.
[00:23:56] Um, now here's a chart that's really
[00:23:59] interesting. Since Deep Seek's arrival,
[00:24:01] MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you
[00:24:05] can see here on balance uh a lot more
[00:24:10] than the S&P 500 which is down you know
[00:24:13] 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like
[00:24:17] 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says
[00:24:21] June rate move in play if data is clear.
[00:24:24] big importance on the jobs report if
[00:24:27] that confirms the ADP and the labor
[00:24:29] market is softening. Uh the May meeting
[00:24:32] is going to be interesting but the June
[00:24:34] meeting could be active. Uh, and that's
[00:24:38] a key thing I want to emphasize
[00:24:41] also. Uh, let's just see
[00:24:45] here. I posted on Twitter.
[00:24:51] Um, the Fed, the
[00:24:54] Treasury is looking
[00:24:55] [Music]
[00:24:58] to increase the enhance the Treasury
[00:25:01] buyback program, which is effectively a
[00:25:04] cute way of saying a new form of
[00:25:07] quantitative easing without calling it
[00:25:09] quantitative easing, which we had been
[00:25:11] talking about get ready for. You can see
[00:25:16] uh where is it? Here. Here it is. Okay.
[00:25:19] You can go to the Treasury website and
[00:25:22] you can see here in considering these
[00:25:23] options, Treasury will be guided by the
[00:25:25] objective of financing the government at
[00:25:27] the lowest cost over time. That 10-year
[00:25:30] yield is going to keep coming down.
[00:25:31] That's going to be a boon for housing,
[00:25:33] GenerRack, Stanley Black & Decker, uh,
[00:25:36] QXO, and more. Uh, Treasuring is
[00:25:39] Treasury is evaluating potential
[00:25:41] enhancements to its buyback program to
[00:25:42] better achieve liquidity, support cash
[00:25:44] management goals, uh, improves its
[00:25:46] efficacy, changes to maximum purchase
[00:25:49] amounts, wink wink. Uh, so quantitative
[00:25:53] tightening will be a rear view mirror
[00:25:54] either in uh, May or June. And this
[00:25:58] treasury buyback program
[00:26:00] aka
[00:26:04] different method same outcome QE type of
[00:26:07] program will be in place and they will
[00:26:10] hit that plus the bank deregulation
[00:26:13] taking the charges from holding the
[00:26:15] treasuries will you get 30 business
[00:26:17] points there you probably get another 30
[00:26:19] to 40 here you could see 375 then you
[00:26:22] got a five and change 30-year fix and
[00:26:24] then we're just completely off to the
[00:26:26] faces with all the millennials that are
[00:26:28] overdue uh in demand for houses. US
[00:26:31] dollar depreciation, emerging markets
[00:26:33] outperforms developed markets. I think
[00:26:35] as I said, you know, there were the
[00:26:38] covers of the dollar weakness, dollar
[00:26:39] demise. I think we're ready for a dollar
[00:26:41] bounce. Uh it will be a counter trend
[00:26:43] bounce, but um just just be ready for
[00:26:47] that. Estimated foreign ownership of US
[00:26:49] treasuries as a share of publicly held
[00:26:51] debt going down. biggest four-week
[00:26:53] inflow into Treasury since March of
[00:26:55] 2023. That was the mini banking crisis,
[00:26:58] by the way. Short Wall Street, long Main
[00:27:02] Street, very similar. So, Ferrari is
[00:27:06] collapsing. Dollar General is
[00:27:07] appreciating. We like that story. Asset
[00:27:10] bubbles of the last 50 years. So, you
[00:27:12] can see ARC and Bitcoin in 2021. MAG7,
[00:27:17] biotech, China, housing, internet, Asia,
[00:27:20] Japan, gold. that just rinse and repeat.
[00:27:22] We estimate moderate selling of US
[00:27:24] equities by foreign investors across
[00:27:25] March and April. That's from Goldman
[00:27:27] Sachs. Another rare bullish breath
[00:27:30] thrust from Brian Dietrich over at
[00:27:32] Carson. 12 months later, uh average
[00:27:36] return 18.9%, median is 17.9. That's off
[00:27:40] the lows. So, it's also in line with
[00:27:42] what we've been saying since the end of
[00:27:44] last year, beginning of this year, which
[00:27:46] is when all is said and done,
[00:27:48] uh, uh, high single digits to low double
[00:27:52] digits on the S&P for the year.
[00:27:54] Extremely strong breath the last three
[00:27:56] days. 12 months out, you see the results
[00:27:59] in bigger terms. Um, same thing here.
[00:28:03] S&P performance after three consecutive
[00:28:05] days gains of 1.5% 1950 through current
[00:28:10] 12 months out you're up 20%. Uh ran very
[00:28:14] bullish breath thrust just
[00:28:17] uh triggered zag breath thrust signals
[00:28:20] since World War II. We had one actually
[00:28:22] recently in
[00:28:24] 2023 12 months later up 32% on average
[00:28:27] up 23%. So, those of you who took me up
[00:28:31] on my urging to add more money and or
[00:28:37] get started with us uh in late March,
[00:28:41] early April, midappril
[00:28:43] uh smart move. You're going to look back
[00:28:45] 12 months from now and really pat
[00:28:47] yourself on the back and the existing
[00:28:49] clients because we got the benefit of
[00:28:51] international in the first quarter and
[00:28:54] um and everything in place moving
[00:28:56] through the end of the year. So very
[00:28:57] excited all around. Uh here's the dollar
[00:29:00] end of the dollar. Um all bearish on
[00:29:05] Trump. This, by the way, this could, you
[00:29:08] know, you're kind of peak pessimism on
[00:29:09] Trump. If you look at the polls, sure it
[00:29:12] could get worse before it gets better,
[00:29:14] but my guess is you get a deal signed
[00:29:15] and this guy's going to if he pulls it
[00:29:18] off. I mean, I I didn't like Letic
[00:29:20] getting on TV and saying, "Well, you
[00:29:22] know, it's not my fault. It's it's
[00:29:23] Besson's fault with China, blah, blah,
[00:29:25] blah." or Besson's in charge of China,
[00:29:27] yada yada yada. Uh, I'm in charge of the
[00:29:29] rest of the world.
[00:29:31] Uh, anyway, the point is you get that
[00:29:34] first India deal or the first Japan
[00:29:36] deal, serious country across the tape
[00:29:39] and man, all those guys that sold in the
[00:29:41] whole desperate for a retest or a
[00:29:44] marginal new low are going to be panic
[00:29:46] buying because they've already had to
[00:29:48] cover up and get their face ripped off
[00:29:51] on the short rally. Uh they should have
[00:29:54] listened when Trump said today's the day
[00:29:55] to buy. That was the bottom. And then
[00:29:57] today he said be patient. America is
[00:30:00] gonna boom. Uh he's probably not putting
[00:30:03] that out there if he doesn't have
[00:30:05] something in his hand. Dollar comes
[00:30:06] under pressure when US PMIs
[00:30:10] underperform which could imply PMIs
[00:30:13] could start to turn. Let's see. Index of
[00:30:15] consumer sentiment by political party.
[00:30:18] Democrats couldn't be more pessimistic
[00:30:20] right now. Republicans couldn't be more
[00:30:22] optimistic. Kind of the same thing when
[00:30:24] Biden was in. So although
[00:30:27] um kind of everyone was pessimistic when
[00:30:31] Biden leaving that aside, uh it's
[00:30:33] typical people unfortunately make
[00:30:35] investment decisions based on their
[00:30:37] politics and it often proves to be very
[00:30:40] very detrimental in the long term. uh
[00:30:42] the mark stock market did very well
[00:30:44] under Biden and if you're a Republican
[00:30:46] and you missed that, shame on you and uh
[00:30:48] we'll probably do the economy will
[00:30:50] probably do very well under Trump and
[00:30:52] you know getting through these next few
[00:30:54] months. Uh and it, you know, if you're
[00:30:58] uh pessimistic because you don't like
[00:31:00] the personality, I think you're going to
[00:31:01] miss out. Uh fewer Europeans traveling
[00:31:04] to the US. Okay, the Euro is going to
[00:31:07] appreciate. they'll be here uh and
[00:31:10] continue to appreciate. S&P realized
[00:31:12] average stock
[00:31:13] correlation has moved up this year. That
[00:31:16] usually happens in draw downs. This will
[00:31:18] start to come down as we uh get some
[00:31:21] deals across the tape. Jet Goldman Sachs
[00:31:23] optimism tracker hasn't been this low
[00:31:25] since the 2022 lows and then the COVID
[00:31:28] lows and then the great financial crisis
[00:31:31] lows. Wall Street forecasts take a
[00:31:33] massive hit amid tariff turmoil. So,
[00:31:36] they're take they're all taking their
[00:31:37] price targets down at the exact wrong
[00:31:39] time. Typical car dealership guy.
[00:31:42] Consumers are about to drop
[00:31:44] 55.8 billion on new cars in April.
[00:31:47] That's a
[00:31:48] 21.2% year-over-year increase and third
[00:31:51] highest month on record. The reasons are
[00:31:52] a few. Retail new vehicle sales are
[00:31:55] expected to reach just under 1.3
[00:31:57] million, a 14.7% increase year-on-year.
[00:32:00] Uh
[00:32:02] 139,000 of those were accelerated
[00:32:04] vehicle purchases. Average new car
[00:32:06] transaction price is expected to reach
[00:32:08] $45,000. Uh up $887 yearon year and 975
[00:32:13] month. But with many buyers having
[00:32:15] pulled forward their purchases and
[00:32:16] affordability still tight, the momentum
[00:32:18] bait may be hard to sustain into summer.
[00:32:20] Yeah. Except that now they've got to
[00:32:24] replenish the inventory. So we're
[00:32:25] worried about production from a Cooper
[00:32:27] Standard standpoint. Not as much retail.
[00:32:30] We definitely want to see the sell
[00:32:31] through. But it's like gener when when
[00:32:34] your neighbor gets a new car, you get a
[00:32:36] new car. When your neighbor gets a
[00:32:38] generator, you get a new generator. This
[00:32:39] game has been delayed for 13.5 years.
[00:32:42] It's on now. And if Bessant does what he
[00:32:44] says he's going to do with the 10-year
[00:32:45] Treasury, uh financing, all that. It'll
[00:32:48] be party like, you know, plus all the
[00:32:51] untapped home equity that'll get ticked
[00:32:54] if we get uh HELOCs at 5% again. The
[00:32:57] game will be on like nobody's business.
[00:32:59] Share of national housing inventory for
[00:33:01] sale with a price cut in March is going
[00:33:03] up. Affordability is coming uh becoming
[00:33:06] better. Weekly announced buyback
[00:33:08] starting to go back up. They the the
[00:33:10] companies are buying in the hole which
[00:33:12] is good to see. We've seen it across our
[00:33:14] portfolio. Percent of Humish respondents
[00:33:16] making unsolicited positive or negative
[00:33:18] comments on government economic policy
[00:33:22] uh through the roof. There you go. UK

[00:33:47] Okay. Little reward on the beats. Misses
[00:33:50] punished more than usual. A lot of
[00:33:52] skepticism. That makes sense. average
[00:33:55] pair-wise correlation between TLT,
[00:33:59] SPY, DXY, which is the dollar for one
[00:34:02] month.
[00:34:04] Um, you haven't seen
[00:34:07] this
[00:34:08] since
[00:34:10] 2020 and that was when you wanted to be
[00:34:13] a buyer. US stocks off to worst start
[00:34:15] against global peers in more than 30
[00:34:17] years. You were positioned to this if
[00:34:19] you listen to the podcast in late 2024.
[00:34:22] We kept pounding the table.
[00:34:24] International, international,
[00:34:25] international has outperformed by some
[00:34:28] 15%. Uh boomers made up almost half of
[00:34:31] US home buyers in 2024. The millennials
[00:34:35] is where we're going to see this thing
[00:34:36] boom as we get the supply as the federal
[00:34:39] lands open, as rates come down. Median
[00:34:42] two-week S&P return since 1950.
[00:34:58] Okay, they're showing first half of May
[00:35:01] is a little bit weak. I I wouldn't
[00:35:03] that's not been the case the last four
[00:35:05] or five years. I saw some stats going
[00:35:06] out that that May 1st to the 30th has
[00:35:09] actually been up. And in years where you
[00:35:11] have
[00:35:13] uh weakness in the first half, which is
[00:35:15] atypical outside of February,
[00:35:18] uh you tend to have stronger summers. So
[00:35:21] just be open-minded to that. Scott
[00:35:23] Brown, let's see. After being down more
[00:35:25] than 13, S&P is now down just yeah, 13%
[00:35:28] year to date, but it was down 19% peak
[00:35:31] to trough.
[00:35:33] Um prior record saw the index down 9in.
[00:35:37] Okay, so big reversal there. Dogee
[00:35:40] candlestick or whatever you want to call
[00:35:42] it. Uh magnificent 7 versus US dollar
[00:35:46] index as the dollar's dropped. Uh
[00:35:49] interesting correlation since
[00:35:52] 2024. So if you
[00:35:55] see a bounce in the dollar and then now
[00:35:58] you've got MAG 7 bouncing with earnings
[00:36:01] that that could be positive all around.
[00:36:03] EPS beat rate improved
[00:36:05] sequentially. Uh, I think it's 73% so
[00:36:09] far versus 67 average. Central banks are
[00:36:12] a potent force in gold buying. They
[00:36:13] always buy the top, ladies and
[00:36:15] gentlemen. You do not want to be buying
[00:36:17] gold here in my humble opinion. It's not
[00:36:18] what I do, but just Spidey sense. Take
[00:36:21] it for what it's worth. All this is
[00:36:22] opinion, not advice. Anyway, go to hedge
[00:36:25] funips.com, click on terms. Uh, it takes
[00:36:29] on average 18 months to sign a trade
[00:36:31] deal and 45 months to implement. All
[00:36:34] they need is a memorandum of
[00:36:36] understanding to be published and the
[00:36:39] market can get on with getting on and
[00:36:40] and a pause of punitive actions until
[00:36:44] the deal is signed. That's really all we
[00:36:47] want is extend and
[00:36:52] pretend. Good times to
[00:36:55] invest. AI sentiment survey three-month
[00:36:58] rolling average bull bear spread with
[00:37:00] subsequent S&P total return.
[00:37:03] when it got down this low. 2020 next
[00:37:06] three months was up 15% up 33% up 26% up
[00:37:10] 56%. The one time it didn't work was the
[00:37:12] great financial crisis down 41%
[00:37:15] uh 2000 then going back to early 2000s
[00:37:18] up 29% up 22% up 15 up 25. So that is
[00:37:24] where you want to be a buyer, not a
[00:37:25] seller, which is what we were pounding
[00:37:26] the table on in early April when it
[00:37:28] wasn't easy to pound the table because
[00:37:30] it complete uncertainty. But that's
[00:37:32] always the case when the market's down
[00:37:33] 19%. Obviously, obviously there's some
[00:37:36] uncertainty. Hello. Uh and I think like
[00:37:39] I said last week, we could see numbers
[00:37:40] get worse while the market gets better
[00:37:42] because it's going to start to price in.
[00:37:45] Uh earnings have come down, estimates
[00:37:47] have come down 3.6% 6% from 275 to 265
[00:37:51] for this year, but next year is still
[00:37:52] 302. So you're trading at 185.5 times.
[00:37:56] Next year's earnings average for the
[00:37:58] last 10 years is 18.3. You take out the
[00:38:01] MAG 7, you're probably at 16. So there's
[00:38:04] things to do. There's things to do. Uh
[00:38:06] 10 largest companies as a share of the
[00:38:08] uh S&P 500 total.
[00:38:12] 10 largest companies are still 36% down
[00:38:14] from close to 40% but uh earnings is
[00:38:18] only 29% share. So we'll see if that
[00:38:21] converges a little bit. Cost of shipping
[00:38:22] containers dropping on a major US China
[00:38:25] route but increasing via
[00:38:27] Vietnam. Percent of stocks above the 200
[00:38:30] day moving average. It got down to this
[00:38:33] low level of 15 which was the COVID lows
[00:38:36] the first trade war lows and now it's
[00:38:38] bouncing off of that. Uh so that's a
[00:38:41] positive
[00:38:44] sign. Small cap short interest record
[00:38:47] high last time this high.
[00:38:51] Um hasn't been this high in years. So
[00:38:54] that's when you want to be a buyer
[00:38:55] because anything positive changes. You
[00:38:56] get a rip your rip your face off
[00:38:59] rally. Uh forward PE trough around bare
[00:39:03] market lows.
[00:39:09] So tech is still elevated. Industrials
[00:39:12] they feel is elevated. Telecom how how
[00:39:15] far is this going back
[00:39:21] though? This to
[00:39:24] 1974. All right. Consumer staples looks
[00:39:27] in line. Healthc care looks cheap, which
[00:39:30] I covered on CNA.
[00:39:35] Real estates look cheap according to
[00:39:39] this financials and energy. Yeah,
[00:39:43] there's got to be something to do in
[00:39:44] energy more than comtock. We got to keep
[00:39:47] looking. Um they'll get cheaper. I've
[00:39:50] continued to show discipline and
[00:39:52] patience and I'm going to continue to do
[00:39:54] that, but we're keeping our eyes
[00:39:56] aggressively open.
[00:39:58] daily true range, Trump tariffs, COVID
[00:40:01] crash, great financial crisis, tech
[00:40:04] bubble, October 1987 crash. So, we kind
[00:40:06] of got a craziness in early April and
[00:40:09] after that, I mean, if you buy those
[00:40:12] things, that's where you can just crush
[00:40:13] it. And we we put a insane amount of
[00:40:16] money to work in April and super excited
[00:40:19] about that. How that looks six and 12
[00:40:21] months out is going to be astounding.
[00:40:24] Um IWM retesting the
[00:40:28] lows what is this? Oh ID I IWM small
[00:40:32] caps to IWM to S spy hasn't been this
[00:40:35] low since 2001 these years 2001 to 2007
[00:40:39] massive outperformance of small caps. So
[00:40:42] uh relative to S&P I think we're on the
[00:40:44] cusp of that again. It's taken a little
[00:40:46] longer than expected but here we go.
[00:40:48] Retail flows at percent of buy minus
[00:40:51] sell. you retails have been buying and
[00:40:54] uh professionals have been selling at
[00:40:56] the wrong time every single year since
[00:40:59] co business confidence composite index
[00:41:03] [Music]
[00:41:04] uh it's interesting so confidence is
[00:41:07] down again this is that soft versus hard
[00:41:10] data uh emotions are down but actions
[00:41:13] are up and actions are the name of the
[00:41:15] game now actions can follow emotion if
[00:41:18] it stays for a prolonged period which is
[00:41:19] why I've said they got to get something
[00:41:21] going now. But um that's that imports.
[00:41:26] Here's the imports. This is what blew
[00:41:28] out. What an aberration. Imports versus
[00:41:32] exports. This is what destroyed the GDP
[00:41:35] number. X this front loading. You would
[00:41:37] have had plus 3% GDP growth. But that's
[00:41:40] good. It put the administration on
[00:41:42] alert. Get it get it going here because
[00:41:44] you don't want two consecutive quarters
[00:41:46] of negative GDP growth. you'll have a
[00:41:48] recession like Biden did in had a
[00:41:51] technical recession in
[00:41:55] 2022. Consumer confidence
[00:41:58] again COVID lows 2022 lows
[00:42:03] um and their retail spending is up so
[00:42:06] you can't make it up. Uh US small
[00:42:08] capitalization total return index is a
[00:42:10] percentage above its 1945 trend line
[00:42:14] average. So you get a few of these
[00:42:16] opportunities in a in a career.
[00:42:22] Um Kenneth French small cap US sector
[00:42:25] index total returns i.e. lowest 30%
[00:42:28] markets capitalization
[00:42:33] stocks average annualized small cap
[00:42:36] sector total return was
[00:42:37] 12.06. So you've had this zerp
[00:42:41] environment since 2009
[00:42:45] uh where small caps have underperformed
[00:42:47] for a long period of time but that never
[00:42:49] holds ladies and gentlemen. I mean look
[00:42:51] you you saw the similar thing in the
[00:42:53] early
[00:42:55] 70s you saw it get pronounced in the
[00:42:57] early 2000s you saw it in the 50s and
[00:43:00] it's always followed by monstrous
[00:43:03] outperformance and um so that's what we
[00:43:06] do. We find dislocation, we bet sizably,
[00:43:10] and then we do it without margin or with
[00:43:12] very little margin and we wait and uh
[00:43:16] and over time some IRRs are off the
[00:43:18] charts, some take a little longer. It's
[00:43:20] lower IRS, but a blend over 10 12
[00:43:23] positions uh and some extra juice on the
[00:43:26] derivative overlays and hedging and
[00:43:28] you're off to the races. So, uh
[00:43:30] recession this year, this has gone up to
[00:43:32] 72% chance.
[00:43:36] Um that's from Cali. So that's where
[00:43:39] sentiment is right
[00:43:41] now. Real consumer spending quarteron
[00:43:45] quarter is up 1.4% and that's similar to
[00:43:49] first quarter of last
[00:43:51] year. Uh
[00:43:54] it's actually more than that. It's like
[00:43:57] 1.7% if you look at this chart. Where is
[00:44:00] it? Yep.
[00:44:02] uh GDP
[00:44:06] sales US China breakup won't be easy for
[00:44:09] US consumers. 81% of smartphones come
[00:44:12] from China, 87% of microwaves, 80% of
[00:44:15] blenders, 70% of refrigerators, 100% of
[00:44:18] toasters or 99.7 93% of lamps. You can
[00:44:22] sit in the dark with wax candles made by
[00:44:25] the
[00:44:26] uh Amish or something like that. Uh,
[00:44:29] lamps 93.5, sofas 30.7, quilts 92%.
[00:44:34] You're going to have to sleep with a
[00:44:36] with a uh snow hat on.
[00:44:39] Uh,
[00:44:41] pillows
[00:44:42] 84.5. Everyone's going to have to buy
[00:44:45] one from that crazy Mr. Pillow
[00:44:48] guy. Um, he's going to make more money
[00:44:51] than a one-armed paper hanger. Curtains
[00:44:53] 93% electric
[00:44:56] toothbrushes
[00:44:57] 80% hair dryer 70% we're going to be
[00:45:00] walking around with wet hair and falling
[00:45:03] out teeth uh ibuprofen 90% constant pain
[00:45:08] wood picture frames 78% toys 75% I think
[00:45:12] Trump said that girls can just you know
[00:45:14] play with one or two dolls instead of 30
[00:45:17] uh tennis shoes 73.6 6 bicycles 89%.
[00:45:22] They should put golf clubs in here to
[00:45:24] get his attention. Uh anyway, is it
[00:45:28] normal for Q1 to see weak GDP then
[00:45:31] rebound? Yes, that's actually the
[00:45:33] seasonal pattern. Another clue. The
[00:45:34] worst is
[00:45:36] over. Performance after 6 day win
[00:45:38] streaks greater than 7%. Uh 12 months
[00:45:41] out, you're up on average
[00:45:43] 19.6%. That's again from Carson.
[00:45:47] uh percent expecting stocks to go down
[00:45:48] over the next 12 months. We're at
[00:45:51] 48.5%. Uh last time we saw this many
[00:45:54] people, this is more than even COVID. Uh
[00:45:56] was in the great financial crisis lows
[00:45:59] you saw
[00:46:01] 55% and uh in the tech wreck lows you
[00:46:04] got to like 47% and that was the lows in
[00:46:07] like
[00:46:08] 2002 2003 period.
[00:46:17] Russell 2000 ETF short interest again at
[00:46:20] record highs here and scoop and score
[00:46:24] 52- week high in short interest. This
[00:46:26] this is going to be a rip your face off
[00:46:28] once we get good news across the tape.
[00:46:30] Maybe we should call it sell in June. Uh
[00:46:34] return index during May on average in
[00:46:36] the last up nine out of the last 10
[00:46:39] years in May.
[00:46:42] S&P firms with higher less lower
[00:46:46] 12-month EPS revisions as a short of
[00:46:48] total
[00:46:51] revisions. Uh when did it get this low?
[00:46:55] In 2022 and then at the lows
[00:47:01] in
[00:47:03] 2019. Okay, that doesn't tell us a lot.
[00:47:06] Uh, Alibaba launches new Quen LLMs in
[00:47:09] China's latest open source AI
[00:47:11] breakthrough. Alip Pay leads China's
[00:47:14] payment apps with tap and pay service,
[00:47:16] amassing 100 million users, ladies and
[00:47:20] gentlemen. Um, that is a big deal.
[00:47:24] That's Ant Financial. And for those of
[00:47:26] you who don't know, as owners of
[00:47:28] Alibaba, we own a third of the company.
[00:47:31] Very exciting to see. that will probably
[00:47:33] IPO in the next 12 months and probably
[00:47:35] do so in Hong Kong. Alibaba rolls out
[00:47:38] instant commerce feature as China
[00:47:40] delivery battle heats
[00:47:42] up. Cutting off China companies risk a
[00:47:46] US policy own goal. USban Huawei now
[00:47:49] it's bigger a bigger threat than ever.
[00:47:52] So unintended consequences of emotional
[00:47:54] decisions. We saw it with SE
[00:47:56] semiconductor chips. Uh I know the right
[00:47:58] people are down in Washington talking
[00:48:00] about the D-listing issues but uh we are
[00:48:03] hedged against that. We kept our
[00:48:05] derivative exposure in the US. Um we
[00:48:08] always go into derivative exposure with
[00:48:11] understanding our maximum risk is the
[00:48:13] premium and we're willing to accept that
[00:48:15] risk before we go into it. Um and uh all
[00:48:19] of our stock has now been transferred
[00:48:20] over to Hong Kong just as a fiduciary
[00:48:24] precaution.
[00:48:26] Um, China's Huawei develops new AI chip
[00:48:30] seeking to match Nvidia. So, that would
[00:48:32] have probably never happened if not for
[00:48:35] these uh
[00:48:37] um basically um chip
[00:48:41] policies. Disney Universal score China
[00:48:44] film dates despite trade woes. China
[00:48:47] offers olive branch to US firms after
[00:48:49] Boeing delivery halt.
[00:48:55] China says it will support normal
[00:48:56] business with US firms despite halting
[00:48:58] Boeing aircraft deliveries. Says US
[00:49:01] tariffs have charmed China's airlines
[00:49:03] and Boeing disrupting trade and
[00:49:04] investment. Boeing is the latest firm
[00:49:05] caught in the trade war. Uh well, good
[00:49:07] luck. They're going to have no planes.
[00:49:09] They're going to be flying on Comax that
[00:49:11] delivers 10 13 Comax last year and uh
[00:49:15] you couldn't pay me enough money to get
[00:49:16] on one of those. China moves to protect
[00:49:18] economy from trade war. Vows to hit 5%
[00:49:21] growth target.
[00:49:22] stimulus baby all day long. Goldman says
[00:49:25] China funds to buy 110 billion dollars
[00:49:28] of Hong Kong listed stocks. All of this
[00:49:32] is going to foreign exchanges. Again,
[00:49:34] bad policy. Trump softens the blow of
[00:49:37] automotive tariffs showing rationality
[00:49:39] of the administration. My own
[00:49:42] editorialization that's positive.
[00:49:44] Housing on federal lands aims to ease
[00:49:46] affordability crisis. developers and
[00:49:48] researchers the say the idea of building
[00:49:49] more homes on federal land could help
[00:49:52] ease shortages
[00:49:54] um and that helps our housing theme with
[00:49:57] QXO Stanley and Generrack. It's becoming
[00:50:00] better time to own a home if you know
[00:50:02] where to look. So it's it's all falling
[00:50:04] into place and once Bessant does the job
[00:50:07] on Treasury. Here's the next one. Besson
[00:50:10] says he wants Treasury yields down.
[00:50:11] Believe him. This article goes through
[00:50:13] the ways he's going to do it. We covered
[00:50:15] those in recent weeks. Stanley Black &
[00:50:17] Decker raising prices to offset tariffs
[00:50:19] costs. You're going to see more and more
[00:50:21] companies having to do that. Generop's
[00:50:24] Q1 forecast lowers bottom end of 2025
[00:50:28] outlook. Just being cautious about
[00:50:30] tariffs. US needs more power for AI, but
[00:50:32] critical equipment is pricey and scarce.
[00:50:35] Tariffs create new challenges for an
[00:50:37] industry overwhelmed by the sheer number
[00:50:39] of projects in line to connect to the
[00:50:41] nation's power grid. Uh these people
[00:50:43] will all be parading down to Mara Lago
[00:50:46] and Washington to make their case and
[00:50:48] eventually these things are going to get
[00:50:49] mitigated. PayPal reports f strong first
[00:50:52] quarter earnings. CEO says the
[00:50:54] turnaround is working. We agree. Venmo
[00:50:57] revenue grows 20% with the debit card
[00:51:00] payment volume soaring. So everything he
[00:51:02] said he was going to do is taking place.
[00:51:05] Intel says clients preparing to test new
[00:51:07] production
[00:51:08] processes process
[00:51:12] Uh, Intel is trying to break into the
[00:51:14] outsourced chipm industry and
[00:51:16] prospective clients are preparing to try
[00:51:17] out its new 14A production process.
[00:51:20] Multiple customers have expressed their
[00:51:22] intent to build these test chips on the
[00:51:23] new process node which will follow 18A
[00:51:25] scheduled to go into production the
[00:51:27] second half of this
[00:51:29] year. New CEO Lip Boutan is committed to
[00:51:32] the foundry operation and will leverage
[00:51:33] his relationships in the chip industry
[00:51:35] to make Intel's factory more attractive
[00:51:37] prospect for outside customers.
[00:51:41] etc. Okay, so that's going to just take
[00:51:44] a little while and it's going to happen.
[00:51:46] Years after failed AI deals, Intel plans
[00:51:48] homegrown challenge to Nvidia. Intel CEO
[00:51:51] says he met with Taiwan semiconductor
[00:51:54] CEO to discuss collaboration. India
[00:51:56] plans to highlight Boeing order pipeline
[00:51:58] in US trade talks. They're like, we'll
[00:52:00] take all of China's planes. Thank you
[00:52:02] very much. Americans are downbeat on the
[00:52:04] economy. They keep spending anyway.
[00:52:05] That's the difference between hard and
[00:52:07] soft data. As markets swooned, pros
[00:52:09] sold, and individuals pounced. Hedge
[00:52:12] funds have sold nearly a trillion
[00:52:13] dollars of shares this year, while 97%
[00:52:16] of Vanguard 401k investors avoided
[00:52:18] trading in early April. So there you go,
[00:52:21] ladies and gentlemen. These guys are
[00:52:22] going to be you get one good trade deal
[00:52:25] and you're going to just see an
[00:52:26] avalanche of buying in leaders we trust
[00:52:29] stock market and sentiment results.
[00:52:32] Uh, so we covered the, uh, appearance
[00:52:34] with Liz Clayman. Thanks to Brooke
[00:52:36] Houseak and Jake Mack for having me on
[00:52:39] last week. Uh, we got that in the
[00:52:41] podcast last minute, but we weren't able
[00:52:43] to get it in the article. PayPal update.
[00:52:46] So, you can see here, we're going to
[00:52:48] cover some key tips. Cash flow is still
[00:52:50] at and near record highs. Stock price at
[00:52:53] near record lows. we that we play those
[00:52:56] divergences for a living and uh play the
[00:52:59] time arbitrage game when everyone's
[00:53:00] dumping in the hole and fundamentals are
[00:53:02] improving. We're buying handover fist
[00:53:04] and we wait for the recovery aka
[00:53:08] turnaround Tom. Maybe we'll have to put
[00:53:10] those uh uh slogans on the next batch of
[00:53:14] mer in the merch store. Uh which would
[00:53:16] be a lot of fun. You can see the share
[00:53:18] count coming down from 1.2 2 billion
[00:53:21] down to 970 million continuing to go
[00:53:24] down. Um so let's go through some of the
[00:53:28] commentary. PayPal delivered yet another
[00:53:31] strong quarter earlier this week.
[00:53:33] Non-GAAP ET EPS of 133 came in well
[00:53:36] ahead of 116 consensus while revenue of
[00:53:38] 7.8 billion was a slight $40 million
[00:53:41] miss. Again for those calling out the
[00:53:43] slow growth, this is a deliberate shift
[00:53:44] in strategy. Since stepping in, Alex
[00:53:47] Chris has made it a clear priority to
[00:53:48] move away from growth at all costs and
[00:53:50] cut empty calorie revenues that were
[00:53:52] popular under prior leadership. The
[00:53:54] focus now is on PayPal's most important
[00:53:56] metric, transaction margin. Shifting
[00:53:58] away from unprofitable volume is
[00:54:00] expected to create a 5 to 6% headwind to
[00:54:02] topline revenue this year. Most of that
[00:54:04] impact will be lapped in the back half
[00:54:06] of the year and things should start to
[00:54:07] reacelerate from there. You can see this
[00:54:09] shift reflected in uh brain tree growth
[00:54:12] which has slowed from 24% in Q1 2024 to
[00:54:15] just 2% this quarter. If you're holding
[00:54:17] your if your holding period stretches
[00:54:19] beyond the next quarter or two, this is
[00:54:21] a welcome change. Not to mention
[00:54:22] transaction margins are now shifting
[00:54:24] sitting at a 2year high. Okay, this is
[00:54:28] the name of the game. If you if we had
[00:54:30] to sum up this quarter in one line, it
[00:54:32] would be quote just getting started. In
[00:54:34] fact, Alex, Chris, and Co used that
[00:54:36] phrase along with early days a total of
[00:54:38] five times during the earnings call, and
[00:54:40] that makes sense. 2024 was always seen
[00:54:43] as a transition year, while 2025 is all
[00:54:46] about scaling product adoption, and
[00:54:47] ramping up new initiatives. This quarter
[00:54:49] that was on full display. Whether it's
[00:54:51] leaning into buy now, pay later,
[00:54:53] launching the ads business, scaling Fast
[00:54:55] Lane, rolling out the PayPal Everywhere
[00:54:57] campaign, or finally monetizing Venmo,
[00:54:59] the flywheel is clearly starting to
[00:55:00] spin. In Alex Chris's own words, PayPal
[00:55:04] is transforming from just a payments
[00:55:06] company into a commerce platform right
[00:55:07] in front of your eyes. Now, there's one
[00:55:09] thing that stood out to us. Guidance.
[00:55:11] Despite crushing EPS expectations this
[00:55:13] quarter and issuing a very strong Q2
[00:55:15] guidance, PayPal chose in typical
[00:55:16] Sandbagger fashion to leave full year
[00:55:18] 2025 guidance unchanged. We understand
[00:55:21] the need to stay cautious given the
[00:55:22] macro uncertainty, but let's be clear,
[00:55:24] this is sandbagger city. In our latest
[00:55:26] article, last article on PayPal, we hi
[00:55:29] highlighted how 2024 results came in
[00:55:31] well above initial guidance. We also
[00:55:33] laid out the potential upside if PayPal
[00:55:35] delivers similar surprises in 2025. The
[00:55:37] chart below speaks for itself. So they
[00:55:40] said 383, they came in 465, that was 21%
[00:55:44] upside on earnings. Free cash flow, they
[00:55:45] said 5 billion, they came in at 6.8,
[00:55:48] that's 36% upside. They said share
[00:55:50] repurchases at 5 billion. They came in
[00:55:52] at 6 billion, that was 20% upside. If
[00:55:55] they do those type of upside surprise
[00:55:57] percentages beyond what they are
[00:56:00] guiding,
[00:56:02] $5.3 for earnings, $6.5 billion of cash
[00:56:05] flow, and 6 billion a share repurchases,
[00:56:08] you wind up with greater than $6 of
[00:56:10] earnings, greater than $8.8 billion of
[00:56:14] free cash flow, and greater than
[00:56:16] $7.2 billion of share buybacks. Okay,
[00:56:20] here's another way to look at current
[00:56:22] management's guidance that makes the
[00:56:24] sandbagging hard to ignore. It's no
[00:56:26] surprise that PayPal has historically
[00:56:27] been back half weighted. Q3 gets a lift
[00:56:30] from back to school shopping and Q4
[00:56:32] benefits from the holiday shopping
[00:56:34] season with Q2 EPS guided to 130. This
[00:56:36] implies first half EPS would total 263.
[00:56:39] Keep in mind management full year's
[00:56:41] guidance midpoint is 503. This suggests
[00:56:43] just 240 in EPS for the entire second
[00:56:46] half. This doesn't seem to add up.
[00:56:48] Looking at quarterly EPS chart above,
[00:56:50] you can see just how rare this would be
[00:56:51] if this actually played out. In seven of
[00:56:53] the last nine years, second half EPS was
[00:56:55] higher than first half, often
[00:56:56] doubledigit percentages. In six of those
[00:56:58] nine years, Q1 was the lowest quarter.
[00:57:01] Not to mention, Q4 has never been the
[00:57:03] lowest quarter for current guidance to
[00:57:06] hold. Payal's entire seasonal pattern
[00:57:08] would need to be flipped on its head.
[00:57:10] I.e., we'd have to put Christmas in
[00:57:12] January. We'd assign the odds of this
[00:57:14] happening as slim to none. Meanwhile,
[00:57:16] PayPal continues to roll out new growth
[00:57:18] drivers. NFC launches in Germany in Q2.
[00:57:22] PayPal Everywhere is expanding in the UK
[00:57:24] in Q3. Fast Lane and the ads business
[00:57:27] continue to scale. And none of this is
[00:57:29] reflected in guidance. Ladies and
[00:57:30] gentlemen, this is sandbagging at its
[00:57:32] finest. As the saying goes, history
[00:57:34] doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes.
[00:57:35] Don't be shocked if we see similar
[00:57:37] upside surprises just like we did in
[00:57:38] 2024. Here's a detailed breakdown of
[00:57:41] everything you need to know following
[00:57:42] PayPal's first quarter. Fifth
[00:57:44] consecutive quarter of profitable growth
[00:57:46] with progress across branded checkout,
[00:57:48] PSP, Omni Channel, and Venmo. Uh
[00:57:51] transaction margin dollars increased
[00:57:55] 7%. Uh other key points returned $ 1.5
[00:57:59] billion to stockholders by repurchasing
[00:58:02] approximately 19 million of shares in
[00:58:04] common stock in 1Q 2025.
[00:58:09] uh on a trailing 12-month basis,
[00:58:12] returned $6 billion to stockholders by
[00:58:13] repurchasing approximately 86 million
[00:58:15] shares of common
[00:58:17] stock. Total payment volume was up. So,
[00:58:20] you can look through this. You can look
[00:58:22] through the
[00:58:23] pitchbook.
[00:58:28] Um more emphasis on profit over growth.
[00:58:32] The uh cash free cash
[00:58:37] flow guidance is still between 6 to 7
[00:58:40] which implies 8.8 if they have the same
[00:58:42] beat rate.
[00:58:44] the impact. So this quarter free cash
[00:58:48] flow includes negative impacts from the
[00:58:49] timing between originating European buy
[00:58:51] now pay later to receivables as HFS and
[00:58:55] the subsequent sale of these
[00:58:56] receivables, changes in the working
[00:58:58] capital and shifting portion a portion
[00:59:00] of annual incentive plan from stock to
[00:59:02] cash which is fantastic. They used to
[00:59:05] give out stock like candy. So here are
[00:59:07] the key points. One, PayPal saw their
[00:59:10] fifth consecutive quarter of profitable
[00:59:11] growth with transaction margin expanding
[00:59:13] over 270 basis points year-over-year to
[00:59:16] 47.7% a 2-year high. Declining
[00:59:18] transaction margin was always a part of
[00:59:20] the bare case on PayPal. Alex Chris and
[00:59:22] the team have flipped this on his head.
[00:59:24] Two, adjusted free cash flow came in a
[00:59:25] bit light at 1.4 billion, down from 1.86
[00:59:28] prior year. While PayPal's free cash
[00:59:30] flow has always been a bit lumpy, a big
[00:59:31] driver, this was the shift away from
[00:59:32] stock-based compensation, which they
[00:59:34] used to give out like candy to cash as
[00:59:37] part of annual incentive plan. We love
[00:59:39] this. We want people to own stock, but
[00:59:40] not all the stock. This is a welcome
[00:59:43] change. Most importantly, management
[00:59:44] maintain the annual guidance range of 6
[00:59:46] to7 billion of free cash flow, i.e. 8
[00:59:48] plus. Uh share purchases total. We
[00:59:50] covered that 15 billion of cash and cash
[00:59:53] equivalents on the balance sheet, just
[00:59:55] 12.6 6 billion in debt along with what
[00:59:57] we believe is the opportunity to buy $1
[00:59:59] bills for 50 cents. Repurchases should
[01:00:01] ramp up at these levels. Venmo's Verb
[01:00:05] buy now pay later later continues to
[01:00:07] stand out. And then the ad business with
[01:00:10] Mark Grether who ran the Uber and Amazon
[01:00:13] ad businesses active accounts all-time
[01:00:16] highs. PayPal Everywhere campaign
[01:00:19] featuring Will Frell launched in
[01:00:21] September. Since then, PayPal debit card
[01:00:24] has added 4 million new active accounts.
[01:00:27] Total payment volume from the debit card
[01:00:29] is up over 100% with strong economics
[01:00:32] both online and
[01:00:34] offline. More earnings call
[01:00:39] highlights. You should read through that
[01:00:41] on hedge
[01:00:43] funtips.com by the way. You can so you
[01:00:46] can go
[01:00:47] there just click
[01:00:50] on commentary and all of
[01:00:53] our
[01:00:55] articles come
[01:01:01] up. All right. So
[01:01:04] now getting
[01:01:06] into Lip Bhutan.
[01:01:10] Look, all you need to know about Lip
[01:01:13] Bhutan is he's coming to turn around the
[01:01:16] company. He did the exact same thing in
[01:01:18] Cadence Designs. You can see when he got
[01:01:20] in at $3.50 a share in 2009. Uh when he
[01:01:24] left in May of 2023, it was $239.
[01:01:28] He had a 68 bagger
[01:01:31] 6,800% in 16 in 14 years. 1 million
[01:01:34] became 68 million. I'm not saying he's
[01:01:36] going to do that with Intel, but I do
[01:01:38] think four or five bagger is in the
[01:01:40] cards if you get this thing four to five
[01:01:41] years to play out. Maybe a little sooner
[01:01:44] because this guy is a miracle worker.
[01:01:46] Uh, and probably 90% of the work was
[01:01:49] done by Gellzinger as it relates to
[01:01:51] getting these foundaries in place. So,
[01:01:52] you can go through all of this detailed
[01:01:54] stuff. Uh, kudos. Jeff did a great job
[01:01:57] on getting through some of this stuff
[01:01:59] and then the key points again uh you can
[01:02:02] go through with that some highlights on
[01:02:05] Etsy which we're going to do in more
[01:02:06] detail next week as well as Generrack.
[01:02:10] Okay, Generrack beat uh Etsy showing
[01:02:13] some good stuff on one of its platforms,
[01:02:16] the other platform they're selling. Free
[01:02:17] cash flow continues to hum. Uh here's
[01:02:20] the fear and greed index down at 39.
[01:02:23] National Association of Active
[01:02:25] Investment Managers, they they sold all
[01:02:28] in the hole at the beginning of April,
[01:02:30] down to 35% equity exposure. They are
[01:02:32] going to have to chase up like it's
[01:02:34] going out of style. Oil and gas
[01:02:36] equipment services earnings top 30
[01:02:38] weights in the last 60 days revised
[01:02:41] down. These are going to get close to a
[01:02:43] bottom here soon.
[01:02:45] Um, a lot of the stock prices have held
[01:02:48] up, which is why I haven't run like
[01:02:49] crazy to get into them yet, but I'm
[01:02:51] keeping an eye on them regularly. ARC
[01:02:54] earnings down 5.5% for this year, 4.6%
[01:02:58] for next year. Always keeping an eye on
[01:03:01] that one because it's kind of the most
[01:03:02] speculative companies in the market. Uh,
[01:03:05] we covered
[01:03:07] the ADP report. The most important thing
[01:03:11] coming is the jobs report. expected only
[01:03:14] 129,000 jobs, non-farm payrolls, down
[01:03:17] from 228. This should, if we get a weak
[01:03:20] jobs report, if the ADP report is a
[01:03:23] precursor, you got three things going.
[01:03:25] You got the low PCE number, inflation
[01:03:30] number, you had uh the the labor market
[01:03:33] is where they're all focused. So, if the
[01:03:36] labor market's weak, if you got a tick
[01:03:38] up from 4.2 to say 4.3 or 4.4, four uh
[01:03:42] you could you know May becomes an
[01:03:45] interesting meeting but definitely June
[01:03:47] because it gives them cover. I mean if
[01:03:49] they could cut they would cut it's just
[01:03:51] they need cover. They can't
[01:03:54] speculate they have to justify and of
[01:03:58] oftentimes by the time you can justify
[01:04:00] like Buffett says if you wait for the
[01:04:01] Robins to sing it's already spring and
[01:04:03] you're too late. So, um, moving on to
[01:04:06] earnings, 73% beat rate, 10.1%
[01:04:09] year-on-year growth.
[01:04:11] That syncs with a 3% GDP number, X
[01:04:15] inventories versus the negative.3 that
[01:04:18] you saw with all the pull forward uh,
[01:04:20] impacting the net exports part of the
[01:04:22] equation. Uh, this is what I was talking
[01:04:25] about with estimates come down 3.6% from
[01:04:28] 275 to 265, but backend
[01:04:30] loaded 302. So you're looking at 302
[01:04:36] divided by 265 13 14% earnings growth
[01:04:40] from this year to next year for the S&P
[01:04:42] 500 as it stands. So the question is
[01:04:45] whether the market can look through all
[01:04:47] of this and the answer we're going to
[01:04:49] find out, but I think can possibly be
[01:04:52] yes. So with that said, let's move on to
[01:04:54] the ask me anything questions. Um for
[01:04:57] those of you who don't stick around for
[01:04:59] the ask me anything, thanks for tuning
[01:05:01] in. Uh, I know a lot of you do like it.
[01:05:04] So, here we go. First question from Eric
[01:05:07] F. Dear Mr. Hayes, congratulations on
[01:05:09] all your effort to move Baba US listed
[01:05:12] shares to Hong Kong. You spent a lot of
[01:05:14] time discussing the possibility Baba
[01:05:16] being delisted due to actions in the US
[01:05:18] government and regulations. No, I Well,
[01:05:20] look, my conclusion is I think it's less
[01:05:22] than a coin flip odds, but if I can do
[01:05:25] something that has little friction to
[01:05:29] protect my investors capital and my own,
[01:05:31] which I invest alongside, I'm going to
[01:05:33] take that action even if it proves to be
[01:05:35] unnecessary.
[01:05:37] um we still have exposure to the US
[01:05:39] because we can't replicate our
[01:05:41] derivative overlay in Hong Kong and
[01:05:44] we're going to take that full risk in
[01:05:46] the US but for the bulk of the money
[01:05:48] devoted to the idea in common stock uh
[01:05:52] we're moving it to Hong Kong to be
[01:05:55] proactive. Uh what about the other side
[01:05:58] of the coin for those holding US shares?
[01:06:00] Do you have any concerns about the VIE
[01:06:02] structure of US listed shares? Uh how
[01:06:04] about the actions of the Chinese
[01:06:06] government to screw US shareholders or
[01:06:08] the lack of recourse US shareholders
[01:06:10] have regarding issues of corporate
[01:06:11] government by management of the VIE
[01:06:12] structure? Thanks again. Uh look, that's
[01:06:15] possible, but that's the nuclear option.
[01:06:17] So if it gets to that point, you know,
[01:06:21] if if the Chinese government
[01:06:24] destroys foreign investment in Chinese
[01:06:28] entities, they're over. That's I mean
[01:06:30] that's just
[01:06:32] mutually assured destruction. Um so I
[01:06:37] would say the odds of the Chinese
[01:06:39] screwing
[01:06:40] themselves are lower than the odds of
[01:06:44] the US screwing themselves by delisting
[01:06:46] in the US. Uh they're both below coin
[01:06:49] flip odds. I would say there's a 35 h I
[01:06:52] wouldn't even say that. I'd say there's
[01:06:54] probably a 20% chance that the US screws
[01:06:57] themselves and maybe a 3% chance that
[01:06:59] the Chinese screw themselves. But
[01:07:01] nothing is without risk. You get in your
[01:07:03] car tomorrow morning, there's risk.
[01:07:05] That's just the way life works. Um and
[01:07:08] uh you deal with it and you manage it by
[01:07:10] sizing. Jay Manning, uh do you have any
[01:07:13] interest in us United Health at these
[01:07:15] levels?
[01:07:17] Um maybe. Let's see.
[01:07:41] Man, they took a cash flow hit and the
[01:07:43] price held up. Cash flow is starting to
[01:07:46] recover. What's happening? Margins are
[01:07:47] still down. I don't like it yet. I don't
[01:07:50] think it's come down enough to be
[01:07:52] interesting. You're probably okay,
[01:07:55] but you know, for me to even allocate a
[01:07:58] penny of capital, I need to see at least
[01:07:59] a potential double, and I don't see it
[01:08:01] in this in in a reasonable amount of
[01:08:03] time. So, for that reason, I think
[01:08:05] there's a good probability you'll make,
[01:08:06] you know, 40 50%, but I I don't I don't
[01:08:10] think about it. Uh, Simon Stazzy
[01:08:13] Ununice, thoughts on
[01:08:31] BP. I don't think it's come down enough,
[01:08:33] partner.
[01:08:44] prices come down with free cash flow and
[01:08:46] revenues. Uh, I'm going to pass. They
[01:08:48] made a lot of strategic errors. They
[01:08:50] tried to go green. They were, you know,
[01:08:51] blew with the wind when the, you know,
[01:08:54] and uh trying to do wind farms and all
[01:08:58] kinds of and they're paying for
[01:09:00] it. I I would pass on that. I think
[01:09:02] there's a lot of brain damage in
[01:09:03] management over there. Hey Tom, hope
[01:09:05] you're doing great. At which point would
[01:09:07] you consider opening a position in
[01:09:08] Alpha? I mean that's like a cigarette
[01:09:10] company trying to sell vitamins. I mean
[01:09:11] you can't make this up. Anyway,
[01:09:14] um hope you're doing great. At which
[01:09:16] point would you consider but Alphabet I
[01:09:18] continue to look at Alphabet. The
[01:09:20] problem is I don't use it anymore. I use
[01:09:21] Grock. So um that worries me. But
[01:09:25] they've got Whimo. They've got an
[01:09:27] incredible cloud
[01:09:30] business. It's got like in two 2022 it
[01:09:33] was easy. I mean, all this Grock stuff
[01:09:35] wasn't even around. It was like a
[01:09:37] no-brainer and it was an easy double. I
[01:09:39] don't know that it's an easy double. I
[01:09:41] think it's a possible, if
[01:09:43] not I I don't have the level of
[01:09:46] confidence. So, it it it's not like it's
[01:09:49] probably going to go up 50% and without
[01:09:52] me, it's just not such an easy double or
[01:09:54] triple that I want to put any money to
[01:09:57] work. It's a trade and you're probably
[01:09:59] gonna make 20 30% in the next few
[01:10:00] months, but um I'll let you do that
[01:10:03] without me. Great podcast. Uh this is
[01:10:06] from John H. Truly nothing short of
[01:10:09] life-changing for me and my colleagues.
[01:10:10] I spend about two hours a day in the car
[01:10:11] and your podcast is by far the most
[01:10:13] informative and entertaining I've ever
[01:10:14] found. Recent listener, roughly six
[01:10:16] months, and I'm still getting a grasp on
[01:10:17] turnaround, Tom, business valuation
[01:10:19] models. Um, my wife and I recently
[01:10:22] inherited some shares of Atlantic Union
[01:10:24] Bank
[01:10:25] Shares, AUB. By the way, thank you for
[01:10:28] the kind words,
[01:10:31] John. Okay, Atlantic Union Bank
[01:10:43] shares as they bought out our old bank,
[01:10:47] N American National Bank. From what I
[01:10:48] see, it has decent margin of safety,
[01:10:50] book value above trading price, enough
[01:10:52] cash to basically 13 time multiple
[01:10:55] revenues
[01:10:59] growing. Let me just see something.
[01:11:59] Yeah, I think you got a solid bank. If
[01:12:02] your question is, would I buy it
[01:12:04] here? H probably goes a little bit
[01:12:06] lower, but would I sell it here? The
[01:12:09] answer is no. I think you're I think
[01:12:11] you're fine. I think you have a pretty
[01:12:13] without knowing any. Let me just see
[01:12:15] where it's
[01:12:19] located. Glenn out, Virginia. I I think
[01:12:22] this one's okay, my friend. Thanks for
[01:12:24] being a super fan and welcome uh
[01:12:28] to to the podcast. Uh, he's asking about
[01:12:32] [Music]
[01:12:33] JD. I I don't like it as much. I I don't
[01:12:36] have to own all of them. I think it'll
[01:12:38] probably do okay, but again, I'd want to
[01:12:40] own it
[01:12:41] in Hong Kong.
[01:12:47] Um, the the the problem with these is
[01:12:50] they don't have the outs. The reason we
[01:12:52] got involved with Baba is because it had
[01:12:53] the cloud, had the AI, had the
[01:12:56] e-commerce, had the international, had
[01:12:58] the cash, had all these free options
[01:13:00] investments, and JD is basically a
[01:13:03] retailer. And that's a tough business to
[01:13:04] be your exclusive business, especially
[01:13:06] when you don't have the largest share.
[01:13:08] So, for that reason, I just don't like
[01:13:10] it as much. But, it will go up with all
[01:13:12] of China stocks. I just
[01:13:15] um it's not for me. Zim, we've covered a
[01:13:18] million times. Uh, these chippers are
[01:13:21] like the quickest way to lose
[01:13:23] money. And uh, has this come down enough
[01:13:27] yet? No, I'm a pass. It's not for
[01:13:30] me. We've covered that a million
[01:13:33] times. We had a lot of people coming to
[01:13:36] it us with this uh, when it was right up
[01:13:39] here. They were all excited about it up
[01:13:41] here. No one down here. No one down
[01:13:43] here. Always
[01:13:45] up. York bourgeoa. Big fan of the
[01:13:49] podcast. Thanks for consistently posting
[01:13:50] quality every day and every week. It
[01:13:52] cuts through the silly noise from
[01:13:53] everywhere else. Uh, thank you. That's
[01:13:55] very kind. I understand much of this
[01:13:57] comes to
[01:14:00] [Music]
[01:14:14] your Yeah. I mean, York, it's it's a
[01:14:20] So, first off, if you want to go into
[01:14:22] the business and you're new, you're in
[01:14:24] college, get your CFA, learn the
[01:14:27] language of the business, and that'll
[01:14:29] give you the basics. And you got to
[01:14:30] learn the basics of valuation before you
[01:14:32] can get into the advance. The advance
[01:14:34] comes from observing thousands of
[01:14:37] patterns and reading thousands and
[01:14:39] thousands and thousands of books and
[01:14:41] reports and everything over the years.
[01:14:43] and you get this mosaic in your mind
[01:14:46] that can only be replicated with time
[01:14:48] and reading because you love what you do
[01:14:49] and you want to do it
[01:14:51] 24/7. Um, and then the patterns will
[01:14:54] start to emerge like anything else. It's
[01:14:56] like uh in sports, you know, it's first
[01:14:59] it's conscious incompetence. You know
[01:15:01] that you suck. Then it's uh
[01:15:04] conscious
[01:15:06] competence
[01:15:08] where
[01:15:10] you kind of have to think about doing
[01:15:13] well and then it's unconscious
[01:15:15] competence where it comes naturally and
[01:15:16] that's the same with investing. Um it's
[01:15:19] just reading the books, reading the
[01:15:21] annual reports, zone zoning in but you
[01:15:24] got to get the basics. So like it's
[01:15:26] like what's your edge? your edge will be
[01:15:29] different than my edge because you'll
[01:15:30] discover it on your own after years and
[01:15:33] years of experience. And um and once you
[01:15:35] have that, you could actually teach your
[01:15:37] whole edge to someone else and they just
[01:15:39] wouldn't be able to do it because they
[01:15:40] don't have the context of all the years
[01:15:42] of experience and patterns and reading
[01:15:44] and learning and seeing things over and
[01:15:47] over and repeat and different managers
[01:15:49] and seeing how they operated in
[01:15:51] different cycles. It's just so get your
[01:15:53] basics, get your language and then get
[01:15:55] your time in the business. And you know,
[01:15:57] I always tell people before you do any
[01:15:59] of that, if you're getting into this
[01:16:01] business because you think it's just a
[01:16:02] way to make money, there's so many great
[01:16:03] ways to make money as an entrepreneur.
[01:16:05] If you don't love this, you'll get your
[01:16:07] face ripped off because you're competing
[01:16:08] against the smartest people in the world
[01:16:10] every single day. And
[01:16:13] um a lot of success comes from staying
[01:16:15] power and risk management and then you
[01:16:18] gain that expertise over time. So, um,
[01:16:22] yeah, start with intelligent investor.
[01:16:25] Either the light bulb goes off or it
[01:16:27] doesn't after reading that book. If it
[01:16:28] goes off, read all the CFA uh levels and
[01:16:31] and get that done. And then from there,
[01:16:33] it's just time in. And after 10 years,
[01:16:35] you'll have some level of competence.
[01:16:37] After 20, if you've made it through
[01:16:39] that, you're probably going to be pretty
[01:16:41] damn good and pretty darn wealthy. Uh,
[01:16:43] James
[01:16:45] Renan just discovered INTW, which does
[01:16:49] Intel two times leverage. Don't do it.
[01:16:53] Um, next
[01:16:55] question.
[01:16:59] Martin
[01:17:01] Grizzki wants to talk about Target,
[01:17:03] which we've covered a bunch of times. I
[01:17:05] think Target's okay. If you got to buy a
[01:17:09] retailer, it's now. If you buy it at 96
[01:17:12] and it goes to 75, it's not the end of
[01:17:14] the world. I think it's best in class
[01:17:16] for that space.
[01:17:19] Um, and I think you'll
[01:17:23] be okay with that one.
[01:17:36] I mean, it's not something that I would
[01:17:37] like pound the table on, but I think
[01:17:39] you're okay a little lower than
[01:17:45] here. And then final from Ishmamail
[01:17:50] Faras, thanks for great podcast sharing
[01:17:52] your knowledge, latest information. My
[01:17:54] question is, what will you be announcing
[01:17:55] when you've sold some or all your
[01:17:57] holdings in a particular company? If
[01:17:59] yes, how long after it's done? Number
[01:18:01] one, I have no obligation to tell you
[01:18:02] what companies we own and don't own. And
[01:18:04] number two, I have no obligation to tell
[01:18:05] you when we're in or out. Uh what has
[01:18:08] been the case historically is every
[01:18:09] single company I have told when I got
[01:18:12] out of um after we were out of the full
[01:18:14] position and um you know whether it was
[01:18:18] uh I mean there's just been so many but
[01:18:21] Rolls-Royce was a multibagger
[01:18:25] for Amazon, Google
[01:18:29] um the banks off the banking crisis lows
[01:18:32] off the COVID lows
[01:18:36] um uh Exxon. I mean, every single one
[01:18:42] that we've gone through when we've got
[01:18:44] out, we've let everyone know that we've
[01:18:46] gotten out and um and we don't foresee
[01:18:49] any difference in that. Um and we'll
[01:18:52] just you know, usually tell you when
[01:18:53] we're fully out, uh you know, the next
[01:18:56] week or the following week. So, if you
[01:18:57] miss a podcast, you probably miss a lot
[01:18:59] of those. There's nothing, you know,
[01:19:00] we're not going to make 10,000
[01:19:01] individual phone calls for people who
[01:19:03] are not clients. So, our obligation is
[01:19:05] to our clients. This is for education
[01:19:07] andformational purposes, but we do try
[01:19:09] to update you uh when we've taken
[01:19:10] profits on a position at fully valued uh
[01:19:13] and go from there. So, with that said, I
[01:19:15] want to thank everyone for tuning in.
[01:19:17] We'll be back next week, same place,
[01:19:21] probably our normal day on Thursday. In
[01:19:24] the meantime, make it a great one. Bye
[01:19:26] for now.
