We're going to listen in here. Let's see the progress of the selloff. Now, we're down 700 points on the Dow. That's 1.7%. The Nasdaq is down 457, 2.6%. Tom Hayes joining us this morning to cover the markets. All right, Tom, you know the story. The economy contracted slightly in the first quarter. Core inflation ticked up. That's not a good environment for stocks, is it? Well, I think you have a couple of things happening here. One, you've got the Trump put. If you remember on April 8th, he said now is a good time to buy. That was the bottom of the market. This morning, he said, \"Be patient. America is going to boom.\" You probably don't say that if you if you don't know that a trade deal announcement is coming uh as it relates to the ADP numbers, the inflation numbers, the GDP numbers. All that does is really set up the Fed as a second potential put. You know, May is off the table for a cut, but with these numbers, and we're going to see more information on Friday with the jobs report, it may bring the Fed back in play.

And finally , the Treasury was out this morning saying they may want to enhance their Treasury buyback program to lower long-term borrowing costs. So, they're trying to hit it three different ways while they negotiate through this process. All right, Microsoft and Meta, they report after the bell. Let's take them one at a time. What do you see for Microsoft? Expectations are high. 8% earnings growth, 10% revenue growth. The whole key is going to be guidance on AI spend and Azure cloud growth. They're expected to grow their cloud business by low to mid30%. If you get that and you get reasonable guidance, Microsoft could rebound here. But if they confirm what we've been seeing about the lease cancellations and pulling back on spend, it might see some softness. So, we'll see what happens after the bell on Microsoft. All right.

And then want to thank Audrey Tay for having me on CNA Asia, uh, Channel News Asia, which is basically the BBC of Singapore, broadcast all over Asia. Uh, made some incredible contacts through that.

So that'll be posted on the website tomorrow. 100 days since US President Donald Trump took office again. We want to just talk about that for a bit. What's Wall Street's assessment of his first 100 days? Well, look, I I think that uh we have a lot of things happening all at once. You know, the old saying, you have to break a few eggs to get an omelet. I mean, this is what he ran on and this is what he's delivering.

It's just a kind of fancy way of saying they're going to be in the market potentially buying more bonds, and we know what that looks like historically. So those three things point to yes, they're making these bold moves that are kind of disruptive and causing volatility, but they're paying attention and they don't want it to fall over the cliff. And it's earning season now. Before we get into the specific results, though, give us an overview for 2025. Thomas, yeah, look, I I think that uh the bad news is estimates have been coming down, okay, down 3.6% year to date on the S&P 500. Uh that means from $275 to $265. That's, you know, 20 times 2025 estimates is pretty rich. However, uh like all good estimates, they're backend loaded. 2026 estimates have been holding up at $32, which means right now we're at, you know, 18.5 times next year's earnings. The 10-year average is 18.3 times. We've had 36% of the companies report maybe a little more now uh this week over 10% earnings growth. So the world is not ending. I mean uh Lutnik Leutnik was out there yesterday saying I have a deal in my back pocket. It just has to be uh approved. Uh the administration continues to meet with uh uh CEOs like Walmart, Target, Home Depot. So they're getting the proper feedback and and the most important thing I think is that sentiment has been fully flushed out. Hedge funds and CTAs were record sellers on on April 8th in the hole at the worst possible time. So they are going to be forced buyers as we get any semblance of good news with deal flow and if Lutnik is correct and we get an announcement uh you're going to get a lot of people forced to buy. Uh Thomas, now let's talk about matter and Microsoft. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n results did not disappoint earlier on as well. Uh we heard from Sarah uh sharing with us uh Microsoft beat on both the top and bottom lines with its zero cloud business uh exceeded analysts estimates. Meta reporting uh rising revenue and profit helped by Instagram and Facebook ads. Were you expecting these results as well for these two companies? Well, look, we we really didn't know what to expect because you know going in guidance was pretty nice. I mean, you know, people were expecting earning uh revenues up 8%. They came in up 13% on Microsoft. They were expecting earnings up uh 10%. It came in at 18%. Uh people were a little worried about capex. That was up 53% year-on-year. There were all those rumors that they were, you know, cancelling leases and all that stuff. Well, it wasn't reflected in the numbers. and Azure the cloud was up 33% and they increased the guidance to 34 to 35% uh next quarter and they raised revenue guidance 1.25 25 billion. So, uh, in the kingdom of Microsoft, uh, pe people are still smiling. But it's not so great news for Qualcomm, isn't it? Because their revenue forecast missed estimates. Thomas, what happened there? Well, look, it always looks darkest before dawn. I mean, semiconductors, what people forgot is a very cyclical business. We're probably at or near some of the the the troughs in the uh semiconductor cycle. I think there's going to be opportunity, but it's going to take a few quarters. Uh we were at peak exuberance just a short while ago. Uh so it's uh it's a stock pickers market and I know that sounds cliche, but it it really is. I mean, you look at Meta uh also crushed it. They didn't have as aggressive uh guidance. Their their revenue guidance is in line with what we had been expecting, but they took capex up 8 billion and people were worried about capex. Ad revenues up 41.3 billion. uh were were 41.3 versus 40.4. That kind of tells us that the consumer is okay. People were worried about that. Daily active users 3.43 billion versus 3.39. So, you know, the rumors of the economic demise have been greatly exaggerated. I think we're we're chugging along. If the administration continues to show rationality and gets some reasonable deals and gets the rebalancing that they're looking for, uh I think there's a lot of pent up strength. Uh the risk is if they drag it out too long, people will lose the hope and once the confidence is gone, it's it's very hard to get back. And that would be a shame because all the money that they want to save on Doge and uh and uh sensible government spending, if you wind up in a recession, it's going to cost you a lot more to get it get you out of a recession with stimulus, etc., and the the declining uh tax revenues. So, they're threading a needle here. I think they're gonna be able to do it, but uh certainly pushing it up to the edge. Similar expectations you think for Apple and Amazon because they are expected to release uh their earnings uh report tomorrow after the closing bell. Yeah, look, I think rearview mirror, I think they're going to have great earnings and great revenues. The the question is going to be uh you know, a huge question for Apple as it relates to how they're thinking about China, both production and consumption. uh as it relates to Amazon, you've got a lot of Chinese sellers on the Amazon website. Uh so people are going to want to get some color around that. Meta alluded to that uh in their kind of talking about you know 10% of their ad revenues come from Chinese sellers. So we want to know we want to understand that from Amazon but Amazon is uh is a beast. I mean if you get an opportunity to buy it lower you take advantage of it. if you if you don't uh that's just the kind of business it is when the when the uh e-commerce side is a little slow, their cloud tends to do really well. Uh and they've got a phenomenal business. So we, you know, we'll we'll see. Are we going to get beats across the board? Microsoft Meta, uh Amazon, Amazon, Apple, we hope the market could use that. It looks, you know, a lot of these look pretty oversold. uh we just want to understand the guidance and looking at some of the capex uh guidance from Microsoft and from Meta holding in and raising capex it kind of points to positive things happening. I think probably the the one that is is um going to have people on edge is going to be Apple. We want to get some comfort around Apple uh with um you know things changing the environment changing a little bit for them particularly in China. Thomas, let's look ahead. I have you gaze into your crystal ball for a bit. I want to talk to you about your outlook on US earnings for 2026 and which sectors might be your most favored. Well, I think that, you know, as we get closer to 2026, you're going to start to see which sectors um are are looking like they're going to have growth. I would say there are a couple things that I'm paying attention to. Number one is uh materials have been beaten down. I think they're going to get a rebound once we get through all this tariff stuff. Okay. So, it's a little early for that. But I also like healthcare. Healthcare's got earnings growth. It's it it has the benefits of being defensive. It has the benefits that it's sold off enough. Particularly biotech. We've had a new FDA commissioner uh appointed Dr. Macker from John's Hopkins. He wants to focus on innovation uh and streamline streamlining regulation. So a userfriendly review process in English all that means is we're going to get more drugs and we're going to get more deal approval a favorable FTC and you know uh the pharma companies large pharma in the United States they have record cash on their balance sheets. The problem is they have no innovation and they've got a lot of patent cliffs. So rather than build it and take many years, they can just buy it uh because most of these biotech companies are trading at uh you know decade low valuations and uh and that's what what we're going to be seeing. So when you see a lot of deals and you see a lot of drug approvals, you see a lot of growth and you see a lot of money start to chase it. So, I think the surprise of the next 12 to 24 months is biotech's going to do exceptionally well. And I think some of the medical device companies once they get a sense of the landscape, they're defensive, but they've really been left for dead. They're highquality businesses. I think you're going to start to see spending ramp up. Um, you know, one in particular we like is Baxter because they've been able to delever their balance sheet. They sold their slowing grow slow growing kidney business uh for 3.8 billion to Carlilele. they'll pay down some debt and their multiple is probably going to rerate back to more normalized levels from 11 times back to 15 times uh as they focus on the IV business, the nutrition business, uh medical devices and and their pharma. So, uh the next catalyst for that company uh uh will be a new CEO announcement uh and uh you've got time to to own it. They're going to report earnings. I don't know what earnings will be tomorrow, but if you get weakness, it's probably a time to get involved. Uh, in our opinion, not advice. Thomas, we will be monitoring the developments very closely here as well on CN 938. And we, it's been a fun chat this morning. We hope to have you back. And when we do, uh, we look forward to more of your insights and perspectives. My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me. And that was Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Grid Hill Capital. ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nThere are no bad days in the market. When the market is down, you've got bargains. And it's a lovely to think about what you're buying at low prices. When the market's up, the bargains have gone, but you're rich. That's Bruce Greenwald. Uh he was a professor at Colombia Business School. Here's uh Seth Clarman. There's no such thing as a value company. Price is all that matters. At some price, an asset is a buy. At another, it's a hold. And at another, it's a sell. That's why we never enter an investment without knowing where we're getting out. Warren Buffett, investment students need only two well-taught courses. Number one, how to value a business. And number two, how to think about market prices. Treat the fluctuations as your friend, not as your enemy. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNow, on to data. Retail is only emotionally very downbeat on stocks. Allocations have barely dropped. Sentiment has been crushed but allocations are still up. Very similar to kind of what you saw uh since co professionals have been selling in the whole retail have been holding tight and doing very well. This is the Ryex bull bear ratio. You can see it's completely off the charts um bearish. Okay. And that's usually what you see at these bounces. that's across the board institutional. Um, and this is off the charts. So that that you know the thing the the number one thing you need to know about our situation is that institutions and hedge funds and CTAs record sold in the hole at the lows on April 9th or April 8th I think it was. Uh where are my notes? Anyway, the point is they record sold at the exact wrong time and what they are praying for is a retest of the lows, okay? Because they missed this move that retraced half the losses. Um, and usually praying doesn't work in investing. Uh, it frequently never works. So, if we start to see the deal that Lutnik referenced and we continue to see the type of flexibility we've seen on auto tariffs, on the 90-day pause, on other things, uh these guys are going to be forced buyers, okay, into any positive tape bomb like we saw good earnings after the bell, uh which we discussed on the radio show and more durable goods, new orders, non-defense aircraft and parts. through the roof. You know, we got a negative GDP print of.3. You take out the inventory loading because why? It's C plus I plus G plus X, consumption, investment, government spending, which was down, and uh net exports, which everyone was importing ahead of the tariffs. Um, and you would wind up with plus 3% GDP instead of negative.3. That said, you still have a negative GDP growth. So, the administration has to beware not to get two consecutive ne negative quarters, meaning tidy up and get some deals announced. So, you get these forced buyers. Consumer confidence comes back. Earnings keeps going. Earnings are up 10% year-on-year, but that's backward looking. Guidance has been okay, but a little bit dicey depending on the company. ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUm, now here's a chart that's really interesting. Since Deep Seek's arrival, MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you can see here on balance uh a lot more than the S&P 500 which is down you know 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says June rate move in play if data is clear. big importance on the jobs report if that confirms the ADP and the labor market is softening. Uh the May meeting is going to be interesting but the June meeting could be active. Uh, and that's a key thing I want to emphasize also. Uh, let's just see here. I posted on Twitter. Um, the Fed, the Treasury is looking [Music] to increase the enhance the Treasury buyback program, which is effectively a cute way of saying a new form of quantitative easing without calling it quantitative easing, which we had been talking about get ready for. You can see uh w\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nwe start to see the deal that Lutnik referenced and we continue to see the type of flexibility we've seen on auto tariffs, on the 90-day pause, on other things, uh these guys are going to be forced buyers, okay, into any positive tape bomb like we saw good earnings after the bell, uh which we discussed on the radio show and more durable goods, new orders, non-defense aircraft and parts. through the roof.

Earnings keeps going. Earnings are up 10% year-on-year, but that's backward looking. Guidance has been okay, but a little bit dicey depending on the company. Um, now here's a chart that's really interesting. Since Deep Seek's arrival, MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you can see here on balance uh a lot more than the S&P 500 which is down you know 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says June rate move in play if data is clear. big importance on the jobs report if that confirms the ADP and the labor market is softening. Uh the May meeting is going to be interesting but the June meeting could be active. Uh, and that's a key thing I want to emphasize also. Uh, let's just see here. I posted on Twitter. Um, the Fed, the Treasury is looking [Music] to increase the enhance the Treasury buyback program, which is effectively a cute way of saying a new form of quantitative easing without calling it quantitative easing, which we had been talking about get ready for. You can see uh w\n\nthat 10-year yield is going to keep coming down. That's going to be a boon for housing, GenerRack, Stanley Black & Decker, uh, QXO, and more. Uh, Treasuring is Treasury is evaluating potential enhancements to its buyback program to better achieve liquidity, support cash management goals, uh, improves its efficacy, changes to maximum purchase amounts, wink wink. Uh, so quantitative tightening will be a rear view mirror either in uh, May or June. And this treasury buyback program aka different method same outcome QE type of program will be in place and they will hit that plus the bank deregulation taking the charges from holding the treasuries will you get 30 business points there you probably get another 30 to 40 here you could see 375 then you got a five and change 30-year fix and then we're just completely off to the faces with all the millennials that are overdue uh in demand for houses. US dollar depreciation, emerging markets outperforms developed markets. I think as I said, you know, there were the covers of the dollar weakness, dollar demise. I think we're ready for a dollar bounce. Uh it will be a counter trend bounce, but um just just be ready for that. Estimated foreign ownership of US treasuries as a share of publicly held debt going down. biggest four-week inflow into Treasury since March of 2023. That was the mini banking crisis, by the way. Short Wall Street, long Main Street, very similar. So, Ferrari is collapsing. Dollar General is appreciating. We like that story. Asset bubbles of the last 50 years. So, you can see ARC and Bitcoin in 2021. MAG7, biotech, China, housing, internet, Asia, Japan, gold. that just rinse and repeat. We estimate moderate selling of US equities by foreign investors across March and April. That's from Goldman Sachs. Another rare bullish breath thrust from Brian Dietrich over at Carson. 12 months later, uh average return 18.9%, median is 17.9. That's off the lows. So, it's also in line with what we've been saying since the end of last year, beginning of this year, which is when all is said and done, uh, uh, high single digits to low double digits on the S&P for the year. Extremely strong breath the last three days. 12 months out, you see the results in bigger terms. Um, same thing here. S&P performance after three consecutive days gains of 1.5% 1950 through current 12 months out you're up 20%. Uh ran very bullish breath thrust just uh triggered zag breath thrust signals since World War II. We had one actually recently in 2023 12 months later up 32% on average up 23%. So, those of you who took me up on my urging to add more money and or get started with us uh in late March, early April, midappril uh smart move. You're going to look back 12 months from now and really pat yourself on the back and the existing clients because we got the benefit of international in the first quarter and um and everything in place moving through the end of the year. So very excited all around. Uh here's the dollar end of the dollar. Um all bearish on Trump. This, by the way, this could, you know, you're kind of peak pessimism on Trump. If you look at the polls, sure it could get worse before it gets better, but my guess is you get a deal signed and this guy's going to if he pulls it off. I mean, I I didn't like Letic getting on TV and saying, \"Well, you know, it's not my fault. It's it's Besson's fault with China, blah, blah, blah.\" or Besson's in charge of China, yada yada yada. Uh, I'm in charge of the rest of the world. Uh, anyway, the point is you get that first India deal or the first Japan deal, serious country across the tape and man, all those guys that sold in the whole desperate for a retest or a marginal new low are going to be panic buying because they've already had to cover up and get their face ripped off on the short rally. Uh they should have listened when Trump said today's the day to buy. That was the bottom. And then today he said be patient. America is gonna boom. Uh he's probably not putting that out there if he doesn't have something in his hand. Dollar comes under pressure when US PMIs underperform which could imply PMIs could start to turn. Let's see. Index of consumer sentiment by political party. Democrats couldn't be more pessimistic right now. Republicans couldn't be more optimistic. Kind of the same thing when Biden was in. So although um kind of everyone was pessimistic when Biden leaving that aside, uh it's typical people unfortunately make investment decisions based on their politics and it often proves to be very very detrimental in the long term. uh the mark stock market did very well under Biden and if you're a Republican and you missed that, shame on you and uh we'll probably do the economy will probably do very well under Trump and you know getting through these next few months. Uh and it, you know, if you're uh pessimistic because you don't like the personality, I think you're going to miss out. Uh fewer Europeans traveling to the US. Okay, the Euro is going to appreciate. they'll be here uh and continue to appreciate. S&P realized average stock correlation has moved up this year. That usually happens in draw downs. This will start to come down as we uh get some deals across the tape. Jet Goldman Sachs optimism tracker hasn't been this low since the 2022 lows and then the COVID lows and then the great financial crisis lows. Wall Street forecasts take a massive hit amid tariff turmoil. So, they're take they're all taking their price targets down at the exact wrong time. Typical car dealership guy. Consumers are about to drop 55.8 billion on new cars in April. That's a 21.2% year-over-year increase and third highest month on record. The reasons are a few. Retail new vehicle sales are expected to reach just under 1.3 million, a 14.7% increase year-on-year. Uh 139,000 of those were accelerated vehicle purchases. Average new car transaction price is expected to reach $45,000. Uh up $887 yearon year and 975 month. But with many buyers having pulled forward their purchases and affordability still tight, the momentum bait may be hard to sustain into summer. Yeah. Except that now they've got to replenish the inventory. So we're worried about production from a Cooper Standard standpoint. Not as much retail. We definitely want to see the sell through. But it's like gener when when your neighbor gets a new car, you get a new car. When your neighbor gets a generator, you get a new generator. This game has been delayed for 13.5 years. It's on now. And if Bessant does what he says he's going to do with the 10-year Treasury, uh financing, all that. It'll be party like, you know, plus all the untapped home equity that'll get ticked if we get uh HELOCs at 5% again. The game will be on like nobody's business. Share of national housing inventory for sale with a price cut in March is going up. Affordability is coming uh becoming better. Weekly announced buyback starting to go back up. They the the companies are buying in the hole which is good to see. We've seen it across our portfolio. Percent of Humish respondents making unsolicited positive or negative comments on government economic policy uh through the roof. There you go. UK retail sales moving up. largest monthly net injection. Uh this is Chinese stimulus through the roof PBOC net injection 1 trillion yuan. Okay. Little reward on the beats. Misses punished more than usual. A lot of skepticism. That makes sense. average pair-wise correlation between TLT, SPY, DXY, which is the dollar for one month. Um, you haven't seen this since 2020 and that was when you wanted to be a buyer. US stocks off to worst start against global peers in more than 30 years. You were positioned to this if you listen to the podcast in late 2024. We kept pounding the table. International, international, international has outperformed by some 15%. Uh boomers made up almost half of US home buyers in 2024. The millennials is where we're going to see this thing boom as we get the supply as the federal lands open, as rates come down. Median two-week S&P return since 1950. Okay, they're showing first half of May is a little bit weak. I I wouldn't that's not been the case the last four or five years. I saw some stats going out that that May 1st to the 30th has actually been up. And in years where you have uh weakness in the first half, which is atypical outside of February, uh you tend to have stronger summers. So just be open-minded to that. Scott Brown, let's see. After being down more than 13, S&P is now down just yeah, 13% year to date, but it was down 19% peak to trough. Um prior record saw the index down 9in. Okay, so big reversal there. Dogee candlestick or whatever you want to call it. Uh magnificent 7 versus US dollar index as the dollar's dropped. Uh interesting correlation since 2024. So if you see a bounce in the dollar and then now you've got MAG 7 bouncing with earnings that that could be positive all around. EPS beat rate improved sequentially. Uh, I think it's 73% so far versus 67 average. Central banks are a potent force in gold buying. They always buy the top, ladies and gentlemen. You do not want to be buying gold here in my humble opinion. It's not what I do, but just Spidey sense. Take it for what it's worth. All this is opinion, not advice. Anyway, go to hedge funips.com, click on terms. Uh, it takes on average 18 months to sign a trade deal and 45 months to implement. All they need is a memorandum of understanding to be published and the market can get on with getting on and and a pause of punitive actions until the deal is signed. That's really all we want is extend and pretend. Good times to invest. AI sentiment survey three-month rolling average bull bear spread with subsequent S&P total return. when it got down this low. 2020 next three months was up 15% up 33% up 26% up 56%. The one time it didn't work was the great financial crisis down 41% uh 2000 then going back to early 2000s up 29% up 22% up 15 up 25. So that is where you want to be a buyer, not a seller, which is what we were pounding the table on in early April when it wasn't easy to pound the table because it complete uncertainty. But that's always the case when the market's down 19%. Obviously, obviously there's some uncertainty. Hello. Uh and I think like I said last week, we could see numbers get worse while the market gets better because it's going to start to price in. Uh earnings have come down, estimates have come down 3.6% 6% from 275 to 265 for this year, but next year is still 302. So you're trading at 185.5 times. Next year's earnings average for the last 10 years is 18.3. You take out the MAG 7, you're probably at 16. So there's things to do. There's things to do. Uh 10 largest companies as a share of the uh S&P 500 total. 10 largest companies are still 36% down from close to 40% but uh earnings is only 29% share. So we'll see if that converges a little bit. Cost of shipping containers dropping on a major US China route but increasing via Vietnam. Percent of stocks above the 200 day moving average. It got down to this low level of 15 which was the COVID lows the first trade war lows and now it's bouncing off of that. Uh so that's a positive sign. Small cap short interest record high last time this high. Um hasn't been this high in years. So that's when you want to be a buyer because anything positive changes. You get a rip your rip your face off rally. Uh forward PE trough around bare market lows. So tech is still elevated. Industrials they feel is elevated. Telecom how how far is this going back though? This to 1974. All right. Consumer staples looks in line. Healthc care looks cheap, which I covered on CNA. Real estates look cheap according to this financials and energy. Yeah, there's got to be something to do in energy more than comtock. We got to keep looking. Um they'll get cheaper. I've continued to show discipline and patience and I'm going to continue to do that, but we're keeping our eyes aggressively open. daily true range, Trump tariffs, COVID crash, great financial crisis, tech bubble, October 1987 crash. So, we kind of got a craziness in early April and after that, I mean, if you buy those things, that's where you can just crush it. And we we put a insane amount of money to work in April and super excited about that. How that looks six and 12 months out is going to be astounding. Um IWM retesting the lows what is this? Oh ID I IWM small caps to IWM to S spy hasn't been this low since 2001 these years 2001 to 2007 massive outperformance of small caps. So uh relative to S&P I think we're on the cusp of that again. It's taken a little longer than expected but here we go. Retail flows at percent of buy minus sell. you retails have been buying and uh professionals have been selling at the wrong time every single year since co business confidence composite index [Music] uh it's interesting so confidence is down again this is that soft versus hard data uh emotions are down but actions are up and actions are the name of the game now actions can follow emotion if it stays for a prolonged period which is why I've said they got to get something going now. But um that's that imports. Here's the imports. This is what blew out. What an aberration. Imports versus exports. This is what destroyed the GDP number. X this front loading. You would have had plus 3% GDP growth. But that's good. It put the administration on alert. Get it get it going here because you don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. you'll have a recession like Biden did in had a technical recession in 2022. Consumer confidence again COVID lows 2022 lows um and their retail spending is up so you can't make it up. Uh US small capitalization total return index is a percentage above its 1945 trend line average. So you get a few of these opportunities in a in a career. Um Kenneth French small cap US sector index total returns i.e. lowest 30% markets capitalization stocks average annualized small cap sector total return was 12.06. So you've had this zerp environment since 2009 uh where small caps have underperformed for a long period of time but that never holds ladies and gentlemen. I mean look you you saw the similar thing in the early 70s you saw it get pronounced in the early 2000s you saw it in the 50s and it's always followed by monstrous outperformance and um so that's what we do. We find dislocation, we bet sizably, and then we do it without margin or with very little margin and we wait and uh and over time some IRRs are off the charts, some take a little longer. It's lower IRS, but a blend over 10 12 positions uh and some extra juice on the derivative overlays and hedging and you're off to the races. So, uh recession this year, this has gone up to 72% chance. Um that's from Cali. So that's where sentiment is right now. Real consumer spending quarteron quarter is up 1.4% and that's similar to first quarter of last year. Uh it's actually more than that. It's like 1.7% if you look at this chart. W\n\nactions can follow emotion if it stays for a prolonged period which is why I've said they got to get something going now. But um that's that imports. Here's the imports. This is what blew out.

PayPal update. So, you can see here, we're going to cover some key tips. Cash flow is still at and near record highs. Stock price at near record lows. we that we play those divergences for a living and uh play the time arbitrage game when everyone's dumping in the hole and fundamentals are improving. We're buying handover fist and we wait for the recovery aka turnaround Tom. Maybe we'll have to put those uh uh slogans on the next batch of mer in the merch store. Uh which would be a lot of fun. You can see the share count coming down from 1.2 2 billion down to 970 million continuing to go down. Um so let's go through some of the commentary. PayPal delivered yet another strong quarter earlier this week. Non-GAAP ET EPS of 133 came in well ahead of 116 consensus while revenue of 7.8 billion was a slight $40 million miss. Again for those calling out the slow growth, this is a deliberate shift in strategy. Since stepping in, Alex Chris has made it a clear priority to move away from growth at all costs and cut empty calorie revenues that were popular under prior leadership. The focus now is on PayPal's most important metric, transaction margin. Shifting away from unprofitable volume is expected to create a 5 to 6% headwind to topline revenue this year. Most of that impact will be lapped in the back half of the year and things should start to reacelerate from there. You can see this shift reflected in uh brain tree growth which has slowed from 24% in Q1 2024 to just 2% this quarter. If you're holding your if your holding period stretches beyond the next quarter or two, this is a welcome change. Not to mention transaction margins are now shifting sitting at a 2year high. Okay, this is the name of the game. If you if we had to sum up this quarter in one line, it would be quote just getting started. In fact, Alex, Chris, and Co used that phrase along with early days a total of five times during the earnings call, and that makes sense. 2024 was always seen as a transition year, while 2025 is all about scaling product adoption, and ramping up new initiatives.

This quarter that was on full display. Whether it's leaning into buy now, pay later, launching the ads business, scaling Fast Lane, rolling out the PayPal Everywhere campaign, or finally  monetizing Venmo, the flywheel is clearly starting to spin. In Alex Chris's own words, PayPal is transforming from just a payments company into a commerce platform right in front of your eyes. Now, there's one thing that stood out to us. Guidance. Despite crushing EPS expectations this quarter and issuing a very strong Q2 guidance, PayPal chose in typical Sandbagger fashion to leave full year 2025 guidance unchanged. We understand the need to stay cautious given the macro uncertainty, but let's be clear, this is sandbagger city. In our latest article, last article on PayPal, we hi highlighted how 2024 results came in well above initial guidance. We also laid out the potential upside if PayPal delivers similar surprises in 2025. The chart below speaks for itself. So they said 383, they came in 465, that was 21% upside on earnings. Free cash flow, they said 5 billion, they came in at 6.8, that's 36% upside. They said share repurchases at 5 billion. They came in at 6 billion, that was 20% upside. If they do those type of upside surprise percentages beyond what they are guiding, $5.3 for earnings, $6.5 billion of cash flow, and 6 billion a share repurchases, you wind up with greater than $6 of earnings, greater than $8.8 billion of free cash flow, and greater than $7.2 billion of share buybacks. Okay, here's another way to look at current management's guidance that makes the sandbagging hard to ignore. It's no surprise that PayPal has historically been back half weighted. Q3 gets a lift from back to school shopping and Q4 benefits from the holiday shopping season with Q2 EPS guided to 130. This implies first half EPS would total 263. Keep in mind management full year's guidance midpoint is 503. This suggests just 240 in EPS for the entire second half. This doesn't seem to add up. Looking at quarterly EPS chart above, you can see just how rare this would be if this actually played out. In seven of the last nine years, second half EPS was higher than first half, often doubledigit percentages. In six of those nine years, Q1 was the lowest quarter. Not to mention, Q4 has never been the lowest quarter for current guidance to hold. Payal's entire seasonal pattern would need to be flipped on its head. I.e., we'd have to put Christmas in January. We'd assign the odds of this happening as slim to none. Meanwhile, PayPal continues to roll out new growth drivers. NFC launches in Germany in Q2.

PayPal Everyw### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  expanding in the UK in Q3. Fast Lane and the ads business continue to scale. And none of this is reflected in guidance. Ladies and gentlemen, this is sandbagging at its finest. As the saying goes, history doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes. Don't be shocked if we see similar upside surprises just like we did in 2024. Here's a detailed breakdown of everything you need to know following PayPal's first quarter. Fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with progress across branded checkout, PSP, Omni Channel, and Venmo. Uh transaction margin dollars increased 7%. Uh other key points returned $ 1.5 billion to stockholders by repurchasing approximately 19 million of shares in common stock in 1Q 2025. uh on a trailing 12-month basis, returned $6 billion to stockholders by repurchasing approximately 86 million shares of common stock. Total payment volume was up. So, you can look through this. You can look through the pitchbook. Um more emphasis on profit over growth. The uh cash free cash flow guidance is still between 6 to 7 which implies 8.8 if they have the same beat rate. the impact. So this quarter free cash flow includes negative impacts from the timing between originating European buy now pay later to receivables as HFS and the subsequent sale of these receivables, changes in the working capital and shifting portion a portion of annual incentive plan from stock to cash which is fantastic. They used to give out stock like candy. So here are the key points. One, PayPal saw their fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with transaction margin expanding over 270 basis points year-over-year to 47.7% a 2-year high. Declining transaction margin was always a part of the bare case on PayPal. Alex Chris and the team have flipped this on his head. Two, adjusted free cash flow came in a bit light at 1.4 billion, down from 1.86 prior year. While PayPal's free cash flow has always been a bit lumpy, a big driver, this was the shift away from stock-based compensation, which they used to give out like candy to cash as part of annual incentive plan. We love this. We want people to own stock, but not all the stock. This is a welcome change. Most importantly, management maintain the annual guidance range of 6 to7 billion of free cash flow, i.e. 8 plus. Uh share purchases total. We covered that 15 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, just 12.6 6 billion in debt along with what we believe is the opportunity to buy $1 bills for 50 cents. Repurchases should ramp up at these levels. Venmo's Verb buy now pay later later continues to stand out. And then the ad business with Mark Grether who ran the Uber and Amazon ad businesses active accounts all-time highs. PayPal Everywhere campaign featuring Will Frell launched in September. Since then, PayPal debit card has added 4 million new active accounts. Total payment volume from the debit card is up over 100% with strong economics both online and offline. More earnings call highlights. You should read through that on hedge funtips.com by the way. You can so you can go there just click on commentary and all of our articles come up. All right. So now getting into Lip Bhutan. Look, all you need to know about Lip Bhutan is he's coming to turn around the company. He did the exact same thing in Cadence Designs. You can see when he got in at $3.50 a share in 2009. Uh when he left in May of 2023, it was $239. He had a 68 bagger 6,800% in 16 in 14 years. 1 million became 68 million. I'm not saying he's going to do that with Intel, but I do think four or five bagger is in the cards if you get this thing four to five years to play out. Maybe a little sooner because this guy is a miracle worker. Uh, and probably 90% of the work was done by Gellzinger as it relates to getting these foundaries in place. So, you can go through all of this detailed stuff. Uh, kudos. Jeff did a great job on getting through some of this stuff and then the key points again uh you can go through with that some highlights on Etsy which we're going to do in more detail next week as well as Generrack. Okay, Generrack beat uh Etsy showing some good stuff on one of its platforms, the other platform they're selling. Free cash flow continues to hum. Uh here's the fear and greed index down at 39. National Association of Active Investment Managers, they they sold all in the hole at the beginning of April, down to 35% equity exposure. They are going to have to chase up like it's going out of style. Oil and gas equipment services earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised down. These are going to get close to a bottom here soon. Um, a lot of the stock prices have held up, which is why I haven't run like crazy to get into them yet, but I'm keeping an eye on them regularly. ARC earnings down 5.5% for this year, 4.6% for next year. Always keeping an eye on that one because it's kind of the most speculative companies in the market. Uh, we covered the ADP report. The most important thing coming is the jobs report. expected only 129,000 jobs, non-farm payrolls, down from 228. This should, if we get a weak jobs report, if the ADP report is a precursor, you got three things going. You got the low PCE number, inflation number, you had uh the the labor market is where they're all focused. So, if the labor market's weak, if you got a tick up from 4.2 to say 4.3 or 4.4, four uh you could you know May becomes an interesting meeting but definitely June because it gives them cover. I mean if they could cut they would cut it's just they need cover. They can't speculate they have to justify and of oftentimes by the time you can justify like Buffett says if you wait for the Robins to sing it's already spring and you're too late. So, um, moving on to earnings, 73% beat rate, 10.1% year-on-year growth. That syncs with a 3% GDP number, X inventories versus the negative.3 that you saw with all the pull forward uh, impacting the net exports part of the equation. Uh, this is what I was talking about with estimates come down 3.6% from 275 to 265, but backend loaded 302. So you're looking at 302 divided by 265 13 14% earnings growth from this year to next year for the S&P 500 as it stands. So the question is whether the market can look through all of this and the answer we're going to find out, but I think can possibly be yes. So\n\nThey are going to have to chase up like it's going out of style. Oil and gas equipment services earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised down. These are going to get close to a bottom here soon. Um, a lot of the stock prices have held up, which is why I haven't run like crazy to get into them yet, but I'm keeping an eye on them regularly. ARC earnings down 5.5% for this year, 4.6% for next year. Always keeping an eye on that one because it's kind of the most speculative companies in the market. Uh, we covered the ADP report. The most important thing coming is the jobs report. expected only 129,000 jobs, non-farm payrolls, down from 228. This should, if we get a weak jobs report, if the ADP report is a precursor, you got three things going. You got the low PCE number, inflation number, you had uh the the labor market is where they're all focused. So, if the labor market's weak, if you got a tick up from 4.2 to say 4.3 or 4.4, four uh you could you know May becomes an interesting meeting but definitely June because it gives them cover. I mean if they could cut they would cut it's just they need cover. They can't speculate they have to justify and of oftentimes by the time you can justify like Buffett says if you wait for the Robins to sing it's already spring and you're too late. So, um, moving on to earnings, 73% beat rate, 10.1% year-on-year growth. That syncs with a 3% GDP number, X inventories versus the negative.3 that you saw with all the pull forward uh, impacting the net exports part of the equation. Uh, this is what I was talking about with estimates come down 3.6% from 275 to 265, but backend loaded 302. So you're looking at 302 divided by 265 13 14% earnings growth from this year to next year for the S&P 500 as it stands. So the question is whether the market can look through all of this and the answer we're going to find out, but I think can possibly be yes. So with that said , let's move on to the\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\nquestions . Um for those of you who don't stick around for the\n\nquestions . Um for those of you who don't stick around for the\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nFirst question from Eric F. Dear Mr. Hayes, congratulations on all your effort to move Baba US listed shares to Hong Kong. You spent a lot of time discussing the possibility Baba being delisted due to actions in the US government and regulations. No, I Well, look, my conclusion is I think it's less than a coin flip odds, but if I can do something that has little friction to protect my investors capital and my own, which I invest alongside, I'm going to take that action even if it proves to be unnecessary. um we still have exposure to the US because we can't replicate our derivative overlay in Hong Kong and we're going to take that full risk in the US but for the bulk of the money devoted to the idea in common stock uh we're moving it to Hong Kong to be proactive. Uh what about the other side of the coin for those holding US shares? Do you have any concerns about the VIE structure of US listed shares? Uh how about the actions of the Chinese government to screw US shareholders or the lack of recourse US shareholders have regarding issues of corporate government by management of the VIE structure? Thanks again. Uh look, that's possible, but that's the nuclear option. So if it gets to that point, you know, if if the Chinese government destroys foreign investment in Chinese entities, they're over. That's I mean that's just mutually assured destruction. Um so I would say the odds of the Chinese screwing themselves are lower than the odds of the US screwing themselves by delisting in the US. Uh they're both below coin flip odds. I would say there's a 35 h I wouldn't even say that. I'd say there's probably a 20% chance that the US screws themselves and maybe a 3% chance that the Chinese screw themselves. But nothing is without risk. You get in your car tomorrow morning, there's risk. That's just the way life works. \nJay Manning, uh do you have any interest in us United Health at these levels? Um maybe. Let's see. Man, they took a cash flow hit and the price held up. Cash flow is starting to recover. What's happening? Margins are still down. I don't like it yet. I don't think it's come down enough to be interesting. You're probably okay, but you know, for me to even allocate a penny of capital, I need to see at least a potential double, and I don't see it in this in in a reasonable amount of time. So, for that reason, I think there's a good probability you'll make, you know, 40 50%, but I I don't I don't think about it. \nSimon Stazzy Ununice, thoughts on BP. I don't think it's come down enough, partner. prices come down with free cash flow and revenues. Uh, I'm going to pass. They made a lot of strategic errors. They tried to go green. They were, you know, blew with the wind when the, you know, and uh trying to do wind farms and all kinds of and they're paying for it. I I would pass on that. I think there's a lot of brain damage in management over there. Hey Tom, hope you're doing great. At which point would you consider opening a position in Alpha? I mean that's like a cigarette company trying to sell vitamins. I mean you can't make this up. Anyway, um hope you're doing great. At which point would you consider but Alphabet I continue to look at Alphabet. The problem is I don't use it anymore. I use Grock. So um that worries me. But they've got Whimo. They've got an incredible cloud business. It's got like in two 2022 it was easy. I mean, all this Grock stuff wasn't even around. It was like a no-brainer and it was an easy double. I don't know that it's an easy double. I think it's a possible, if not I I don't have the level of confidence. So, it it it's not like it's probably going to go up 50% and without me, it's just not such an easy double or triple that I want to put any money to work. It's a trade and you're probably gonna make 20 30% in the next few months, but um I'll let you do that without me. Great podcast. Uh this is from John H. Truly nothing short of life-changing for me and my colleagues. I spend about two hours a day in the car and your podcast is by far the most informative and entertaining I've ever found. Recent listener, roughly six months, and I'm still getting a grasp on turnaround, Tom, business valuation models. Um, my wife and I recently inherited some shares of Atlantic Union Bank Shares, AUB. By the way, thank you for the kind words, John. Okay, Atlantic Union Bank shares as they bought out our old bank, N American National Bank. From what I see, it has decent margin of safety, book value above trading price, enough cash to basically 13 time multiple revenues growing. Let me just see something. Yeah, I think you got a solid bank. If your question is, would I buy it here? H probably goes a little bit lower, but would I sell it here? The answer is no. I think you're I think you're fine. I think you have a pretty without knowing any. Let me just see where it's located. Glenn out, Virginia. I I think this one's okay, my friend. Thanks for being a super fan and welcome uh to to the podcast. Uh, he's asking about [Music] JD. I I don't like it as much. I I don't have to own all of them. I think it'll probably do okay, but again, I'd want to own it in Hong Kong. Um, the the the problem with these is they don't have the outs. The reason we got involved with Baba is because it had the cloud, had the AI, had the e-commerce, had the international, had the cash, had all these free options investments, and JD is basically a retailer. And that's a tough business to be your exclusive business, especially when you don't have the largest share. So, for that reason, I just don't like it as much. But, it will go up with all of China stocks. I just um it's not for me. Zim, we've covered a million times. Uh, these chippers are like the quickest way to lose money. And uh, has this come down enough yet? No, I'm a pass. It's not for me. We've covered that a million times. We had a lot of people coming to it us with this uh, when it was right up here. They were all excited about it up here. No one down here. No one down here. Always up. York bourgeoa. Big fan of the podcast. Thanks for consistently posting quality every day and every week. It cuts through the silly noise from everywhere else. Uh, thank you. That's very kind. I understand much of this comes to [Music] your Yeah. I mean, York, it's it's a So, first off, if you want to go into the business and you're new, you're in college, get your CFA, learn the language of the business, and that'll give you the basics. And you got to learn the basics of valuation before you can get into the advance. The advance comes from observing thousands of patterns and reading thousands and thousands and thousands of books and reports and everything over the years. and you get this mosaic in your mind that can only be replicated with time and reading because you love what you do and you want to do it 24/7. Um, and then the patterns will start to emerge like anything else. It's like uh in sports, you know, it's first it's conscious incompetence. You know that you suck. Then it's uh conscious competence where you kind of have to think about doing well and then it's unconscious competence where it comes naturally and that's the same with investing. Um it's just reading the books, reading the annual reports, zone zoning in but you got to get the basics. So like it's like what's your edge? your edge will be different than my edge because you'll discover it on your own after years and years of experience. And um and once you have that, you could actually teach your whole edge to someone else and they just wouldn't be able to do it because they don't have the context of all the years of experience and patterns and reading and learning and seeing things over and over and repeat and different managers and seeing how they operated in different cycles. It's just so get your basics, get your language and then get your time in the business. And you know, I always tell people before you do any of that, if you're getting into this business because you think it's just a way to make money, there's so many great ways to make money as an entrepreneur. If you don't love this, you'll get your face ripped off because you're competing against the smartest people in the world every single day. And um a lot of success comes from staying power and risk management and then you gain that expertise over time. So, um, yeah, start with intelligent investor. Either the light bulb goes off or it doesn't after reading that book. If it goes off, read all the CFA uh levels and and get that done. And then from there, it's just time in. And after 10 years, you'll have some level of competence. After 20, if you've made it through that, you're probably going to be pretty damn good and pretty darn wealthy. \nJames Renan just discovered INTW, which does Intel two times leverage. Don't do it. Um, next question. Martin Grizzki wants to talk about Target, which we've covered a bunch of times. I think Target's okay. If you got to buy a retailer, it's now. If you buy it at 96 and it goes to 75, it's not the end of the world. I think it's best in class for that space. Um, and I think you'll be okay with that one. I mean, it's not something that I would like pound the table on, but I think you're okay a little lower than here. And then final from Ishmamail Faras, thanks for great podcast sharing your knowledge, latest information. My question is, what will you be announcing when you've sold some or all your holdings in a particular company? If yes, how long after it's done? Number one, I have no obligation to tell you what companies we own and don't own. And number two, I have no obligation to tell you when we're in or out. Uh what has been the case historically is every single company I have told when I got out of um after we were out of the full position and um you know whether it was uh I mean there's just been so many but Rolls-Royce was a multibagger for Amazon, Google um the banks off the banking crisis lows off the COVID lows um uh Exxon. I mean, every single one that we've gone through when we've got out, we've let everyone know that we've gotten out and um and we don't foresee any difference in that. Um and we'll just you know, usually tell you when we're fully out, uh you know, the next week or the following week. So, if you miss a podcast, you probably miss a lot of those. There's nothing, you know, we're not going to make 10,000 individual phone calls for people who are not clients. So, our obligation is to our clients. This is for education andformational purposes, but we do try to update you uh when we've taken profits on a position at fully valued uh and go from there.

We're going to listen in here. Let's see the progress of the selloff. Now, we're down 700 points on the Dow. That's 1.7%. The Nasdaq is down 457, 2.6%. Tom Hayes joining us this morning to cover the markets. All right, Tom, you know the story. The economy contracted slightly in the first quarter. Core inflation ticked up. That's not a good environment for stocks, is it? Well, I think you have a couple of things happening here. One, you've got the Trump put. If you remember on April 8th, he said now is a good time to buy. That was the bottom of the market. This morning, he said, \"Be patient. America is going to boom.\" You probably don't say that if you if you don't know that a trade deal announcement is coming uh as it relates to the ADP numbers, the inflation numbers, the GDP numbers. All that does is really set up the Fed as a second potential put. You know, May is off the table for a cut, but with these numbers, and we're going to see more information on Friday with the jobs report, it may bring the Fed back in play. And\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfinally , the Treasury was out this morning saying they may want to enhance their Treasury buyback program to lower long-term borrowing costs. So, they're trying to hit it three different ways while they negotiate through this process. All right, Microsoft and Meta, they report after the bell. Let's take them one at a time. What do you see for Microsoft? Expectations are high. 8% earnings growth, 10% revenue growth. The whole key is going to be guidance on AI spend and Azure cloud growth. They're expected to grow their cloud business by low to mid30%. If you get that and you get reasonable guidance, Microsoft could rebound here. But if they confirm what we've been seeing about the lease cancellations and pulling back on spend, it might see some softness. So, we'll see what happens after the bell on Microsoft. All right. Tell me what you expect from Meta in 30 seconds. Yeah, Meta expected high expectations, up 13% earnings, up 13% revenue. The whole key\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nAll right, Google's chief executive and we're back.

What's Wall Street's assessment of his first 100 days? Well, look, I I think that uh we have a lot of things happening all at once. You know, the old saying, you have to break a few eggs to get an omelet. I mean, this is what he ran on and this is what he's delivering. But I will say I think the market is somewhat comforted by his flexibility uh first and foremost with the 90-day pause uh more recently with the auto tariff mitigation or moderation over the over the next two years that that was announced uh this week. Uh and and it feels like we do have some semblance of a put in the market. namely uh Trump said on April 8th now is the time to buy on uh Truth Social and uh that marked the low in in the markets down 19% and it it's m pretty much recovered about half of the losses today. He said on his social media platform America will boom just be patient. Uh so it's showing that he's paying attention to markets. I think markets like to see that. I think the other thing to your point um about the economic numbers today uh the GDP yes the headline was negative uh.3 a lot of that was inventory loading ahead of tariffs so x that you're probably at plus 3.0 know, but that that negative number plus the the week ADP jobs number 62,000 versus 120,000 and then the PCE inflation coming in at 2.3%, the lowest since November. I think all of these point to some level of slowing that brings in the potentiality of a Fed put as the second put me meaning the odds of them cutting uh in June are now up to about 65%.

You know, we got a negative GDP print of.3. You take out the inventory loading because why? It's C plus I plus G plus X, consumption, investment, government spending, which was down, and uh net exports, which everyone was importing ahead of the tariffs. Um, and you would wind up with plus 3% GDP instead of negative.3. That said, you still have a negative GDP growth. So, the administration has to beware not to get two consecutive ne negative quarters, meaning tidy up and get some deals announced. So, you get these forced buyers. Consumer confidence comes back. Earnings keeps going. Earnings are up 10% year-on-year, but that's backward looking. Guidance has been okay, but a little bit dicey depending on the company.

Since Deep Seek's arrival, MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you can see here on balance uh a lot more than the S&P 500 which is down you know 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says June rate move in play if data is clear. big importance on the jobs report if that confirms the ADP and the labor market is softening. Uh the May meeting is going to be interesting but the June meeting could be active. Uh, and that's a key thing I want to emphasize also. Uh, let's just see here. I posted on Twitter. Um, the Fed, the Treasury is looking [Music] to increase the enhance the Treasury buyback program, which is effectively a cute way of saying a new form of quantitative easing without calling it quantitative easing, which we had been talking about get ready for. You can see uh w\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nIs it normal for Q1 to see weak GDP then rebound? Yes, that's actually the seasonal pattern. Another clue. The worst is over.

We're at 48.5%. Uh last time we saw this many people, this is more than even COVID.

PayPal update. So, you can see here, we're going to cover some key tips. Cash flow is still at and near record highs. Stock price at near record lows. we that we play those divergences for a living and uh play the time arbitrage game when everyone's dumping in the hole and fundamentals are improving. We're buying handover fist and we wait for the recovery aka turnaround Tom. Maybe we'll have to put those uh uh slogans on the next batch of mer in the merch store. Uh which would be a lot of fun. You can see the share count coming down from 1.2 2 billion down to 970 million continuing to go down. Um so let's go through some of the commentary. PayPal delivered yet another strong quarter earlier this week. Non-GAAP ET EPS of 133 came in well ahead of 116 consensus while revenue of 7.8 billion was a slight $40 million miss. Again for those calling out the slow growth, this is a deliberate shift in strategy. Since stepping in, Alex Chris has made it a clear priority to move away from growth at all costs and cut empty calorie revenues that were popular under prior leadership. The focus now is on PayPal's most important metric, transaction margin. Shifting away from unprofitable volume is expected to create a 5 to 6% headwind to topline revenue this year. Most of that impact will be lapped in the back half of the year and things should start to reacelerate from there. You can see this shift reflected in uh brain tree growth which has slowed from 24% in Q1 2024 to just 2% this quarter. If you're holding your if your holding period stretches beyond the next quarter or two, this is a welcome change. Not to mention transaction margins are now shifting sitting at a 2year high. Okay, this is the name of the game. If you if we had to sum up this quarter in one line, it would be quote just getting started. In fact, Alex, Chris, and Co used that phrase along with early days a total of five times during the earnings call, and that makes sense. 2024 was always seen as a transition year, while 2025 is all about scaling product adoption, and ramping up new initiatives. This quarter that was on full display. Whether it's leaning into buy now, pay later, launching the ads business, scaling Fast Lane, rolling out the PayPal Everywhere campaign, or",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\nthat 10-year yield is going to keep coming down. That's going to be a boon for housing, GenerRack, Stanley Black & Decker, uh, QXO, and more. Uh, Treasuring is Treasury is evaluating potential enhancements to its buyback program to better achieve liquidity, support cash management goals, uh, improves its efficacy, changes to maximum purchase amounts, wink wink. Uh, so quantitative tightening will be a rear view mirror either in uh, May or June. And this treasury buyback program aka different method same outcome QE type of program will be in place and they will hit that plus the bank deregulation taking the charges from holding the treasuries will you get 30 business points there you probably get another 30 to 40 here you could see 375 then you got a five and change 30-year fix and then we're just completely off to the faces with all the millennials that are overdue uh in demand for houses. US dollar depreciation, emerging markets outperforms developed markets. I think as I said, you know, there were the covers of the dollar weakness, dollar demise. I think we're ready for a dollar bounce. Uh it will be a counter trend bounce, but um just just be ready for that. Estimated foreign ownership of US treasuries as a share of publicly held debt going down. biggest four-week inflow into Treasury since March of 2023. That was the mini banking crisis, by the way. Short Wall Street, long Main Street, very similar. So, Ferrari is collapsing. Dollar General is appreciating. We like that story. Asset bubbles of the last 50 years. So, you can see ARC and Bitcoin in 2021. MAG7, biotech, China, housing, internet, Asia, Japan, gold. that just rinse and repeat. We estimate moderate selling of US equities by foreign investors across March and April. That's from Goldman Sachs. Another rare bullish breath thrust from Brian Dietrich over at Carson. 12 months later, uh average return 18.9%, median is 17.9. That's off the lows. So, it's also in line with what we've been saying since the end of last year, beginning of this year, which is when all is said and done, uh, uh, high single digits to low double digits on the S&P for the year. Extremely strong breath the last three days. 12 months out, you see the results in bigger terms. Um, same thing here. S&P performance after three consecutive days gains of 1.5% 1950 through current 12 months out you're up 20%. Uh ran very bullish breath thrust just uh triggered zag breath thrust signals since World War II. We had one actually recently in 2023 12 months later up 32% on average up 23%. So, those of you who took me up on my urging to add more money and or get started with us uh in late March, early April, midappril uh smart move. You're going to look back 12 months from now and really pat yourself on the back and the existing clients because we got the benefit of international in the first quarter and um and everything in place moving through the end of the year. So very excited all around. Uh here's the dollar end of the dollar. Um all bearish on Trump. This, by the way, this could, you know, you're kind of peak pessimism on Trump. If you look at the polls, sure it could get worse before it gets better, but my guess is you get a deal signed and this guy's going to if he pulls it off. I mean, I I didn't like Letic getting on TV and saying, \"Well, you know, it's not my fault. It's it's Besson's fault with China, blah, blah, blah.\" or Besson's in charge of China, yada yada yada. Uh, I'm in charge of the rest of the world. Uh, anyway, the point is you get that first India deal or the first Japan deal, serious country across the tape and man, all those guys that sold in the whole desperate for a retest or a marginal new low are going to be panic buying because they've already had to cover up and get their face ripped off on the short rally. Uh they should have listened when Trump said today's the day to buy. That was the bottom. And then today he said be patient. America is gonna boom. Uh he's probably not putting that out there if he doesn't have something in his hand. Dollar comes under pressure when US PMIs underperform which could imply PMIs could start to turn. Let's see. Index of consumer sentiment by political party. Democrats couldn't be more pessimistic right now. Republicans couldn't be more optimistic. Kind of the same thing when Biden was in. So although um kind of everyone was pessimistic when Biden leaving that aside, uh it's typical people unfortunately make investment decisions based on their politics and it often proves to be very very detrimental in the long term. uh the mark stock market did very well under Biden and if you're a Republican and you missed that, shame on you and uh we'll probably do the economy will probably do very well under Trump and you know getting through these next few months. Uh and it, you know, if you're uh pessimistic because you don't like the personality, I think you're going to miss out. Uh fewer Europeans traveling to the US. Okay, the Euro is going to appreciate. they'll be here uh and continue to appreciate. S&P realized average stock correlation has moved up this year. That usually happens in draw downs. This will start to come down as we uh get some deals across the tape. Jet Goldman Sachs optimism tracker hasn't been this low since the 2022 lows and then the COVID lows and then the great financial crisis lows. Wall Street forecasts take a massive hit amid tariff turmoil. So, they're take they're all taking their price targets down at the exact wrong time. Typical car dealership guy. Consumers are about to drop 55.8 billion on new cars in April. That's a 21.2% year-over-year increase and third highest month on record. The reasons are a few. Retail new vehicle sales are expected to reach just under 1.3 million, a 14.7% increase year-on-year. Uh 139,000 of those were accelerated vehicle purchases. Average new car transaction price is expected to reach $45,000. Uh up $887 yearon year and 975 month. But with many buyers having pulled forward their purchases and affordability still tight, the momentum bait may be hard to sustain into summer. Yeah. Except that now they've got to replenish the inventory. So we're worried about production from a Cooper Standard standpoint. Not as much retail. We definitely want to see the sell through. But it's like gener when when your neighbor gets a new car, you get a new car. When your neighbor gets a generator, you get a new generator. This game has been delayed for 13.5 years. It's on now. And if Bessant does what he says he's going to do with the 10-year Treasury, uh financing, all that. It'll be party like, you know, plus all the untapped home equity that'll get ticked if we get uh HELOCs at 5% again. The game will be on like nobody's business. Share of national housing inventory for sale with a price cut in March is going up. Affordability is coming uh becoming better. Weekly announced buyback starting to go back up. They the the companies are buying in the hole which is good to see. We've seen it across our portfolio. Percent of Humish respondents making unsolicited positive or negative comments on government economic policy uh through the roof. There you go. UK retail sales moving up. largest monthly net injection. Uh this is Chinese stimulus through the roof PBOC net injection 1 trillion yuan. Okay. Little reward on the beats. Misses punished more than usual. A lot of skepticism. That makes sense. average pair-wise correlation between TLT, SPY, DXY, which is the dollar for one month. Um, you haven't seen this since 2020 and that was when you wanted to be a buyer. US stocks off to worst start against global peers in more than 30 years. You were positioned to this if you listen to the podcast in late 2024. We kept pounding the table. International, international, international has outperformed by some 15%. Uh boomers made up almost half of US home buyers in 2024. The millennials is where we're going to see this thing boom as we get the supply as the federal lands open, as rates come down. Median two-week S&P return since 1950. Okay, they're showing first half of May is a little bit weak. I I wouldn't that's not been the case the last four or five years. I saw some stats going out that that May 1st to the 30th has actually been up. And in years where you have uh weakness in the first half, which is atypical outside of February, uh you tend to have stronger summers. So just be open-minded to that. Scott Brown, let's see. After being down more than 13, S&P is now down just yeah, 13% year to date, but it was down 19% peak to trough. Um prior record saw the index down 9in. Okay, so big reversal there. Dogee candlestick or whatever you want to call it. Uh magnificent 7 versus US dollar index as the dollar's dropped. Uh interesting correlation since 2024. So if you see a bounce in the dollar and then now you've got MAG 7 bouncing with earnings that that could be positive all around. EPS beat rate improved sequentially. Uh, I think it's 73% so far versus 67 average. Central banks are a potent force in gold buying. They always buy the top, ladies and gentlemen. You do not want to be buying gold here in my humble opinion. It's not what I do, but just Spidey sense. Take it for what it's worth. All this is opinion, not advice. Anyway, go to hedge funips.com, click on terms. Uh, it takes on average 18 months to sign a trade deal and 45 months to implement. All they need is a memorandum of understanding to be published and the market can get on with getting on and and a pause of punitive actions until the deal is signed. That's really all we want is extend and pretend. Good times to invest. AI sentiment survey three-month rolling average bull bear spread with subsequent S&P total return. when it got down this low. 2020 next three months was up 15% up 33% up 26% up 56%. The one time it didn't work was the great financial crisis down 41% uh 2000 then going back to early 2000s up 29% up 22% up 15 up 25. So that is where you want to be a buyer, not a seller, which is what we were pounding the table on in early April when it wasn't easy to pound the table because it complete uncertainty. But that's always the case when the market's down 19%. Obviously, obviously there's some uncertainty. Hello. Uh and I think like I said last week, we could see numbers get worse while the market gets better because it's going to start to price in. Uh earnings have come down, estimates have come down 3.6% 6% from 275 to 265 for this year, but next year is still 302. So you're trading at 185.5 times. Next year's earnings average for the last 10 years is 18.3. You take out the MAG 7, you're probably at 16. So there's things to do. There's things to do. Uh 10 largest companies as a share of the uh S&P 500 total. 10 largest companies are still 36% down from close to 40% but uh earnings is only 29% share. So we'll see if that converges a little bit. Cost of shipping containers dropping on a major US China route but increasing via Vietnam. Percent of stocks above the 200 day moving average. It got down to this low level of 15 which was the COVID lows the first trade war lows and now it's bouncing off of that. Uh so that's a positive sign. Small cap short interest record high last time this high. Um hasn't been this high in years. So that's when you want to be a buyer because anything positive changes. You get a rip your rip your face off rally. Uh forward PE trough around bare market lows. So tech is still elevated. Industrials they feel is elevated. Telecom how how far is this going back though? This to 1974. All right. Consumer staples looks in line. Healthc care looks cheap, which I covered on CNA. Real estates look cheap according to this financials and energy. Yeah, there's got to be something to do in energy more than comtock. We got to keep looking. Um they'll get cheaper. I've continued to show discipline and patience and I'm going to continue to do that, but we're keeping our eyes aggressively open. daily true range, Trump tariffs, COVID crash, great financial crisis, tech bubble, October 1987 crash. So, we kind of got a craziness in early April and after that, I mean, if you buy those things, that's where you can just crush it. And we we put a insane amount of money to work in April and super excited about that. How that looks six and 12 months out is going to be astounding. Um IWM retesting the lows what is this? Oh ID I IWM small caps to IWM to S spy hasn't been this low since 2001 these years 2001 to 2007 massive outperformance of small caps. So uh relative to S&P I think we're on the cusp of that again. It's taken a little longer than expected but here we go. Retail flows at percent of buy minus sell. you retails have been buying and uh professionals have been selling at the wrong time every single year since co business confidence composite index [Music] uh it's interesting so confidence is down again this is that soft versus hard data uh emotions are down but actions are up and actions are the name of the game now actions can follow emotion if it stays for a prolonged period which is why I've said they got to get something going now. But um that's that imports. Here's the imports. This is what blew out. What an aberration. Imports versus exports. This is what destroyed the GDP number. X this front loading. You would have had plus 3% GDP growth. But that's good. It put the administration on alert. Get it get it going here because you don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. you'll have a recession like Biden did in had a technical recession in 2022. Consumer confidence again COVID lows 2022 lows um and their retail spending is up so you can't make it up. Uh US small capitalization total return index is a percentage above its 1945 trend line average. So you get a few of these opportunities in a in a career. Um Kenneth French small cap US sector index total returns i.e. lowest 30% markets capitalization stocks average annualized small cap sector total return was 12.06. So you've had this zerp environment since 2009 uh where small caps have underperformed for a long period of time but that never holds ladies and gentlemen. I mean look you you saw the similar thing in the early 70s you saw it get pronounced in the early 2000s you saw it in the 50s and it's always followed by monstrous outperformance and um so that's what we do. We find dislocation, we bet sizably, and then we do it without margin or with very little margin and we wait and uh and over time some IRRs are off the charts, some take a little longer. It's lower IRS, but a blend over 10 12 positions uh and some extra juice on the derivative overlays and hedging and you're off to the races. So, uh recession this year, this has gone up to 72% chance. Um that's from Cali. So that's where sentiment is right now. Real consumer spending quarteron quarter is up 1.4% and that's similar to first quarter of last year. Uh it's actually more than that. It's like 1.7% if you look at this chart. W\n\nactions can follow emotion if it stays for a prolonged period which is why I've said they got to get something going now. But um that's that imports. Here's the imports. This is what blew out. What an aberration. Imports versus exports. This is what destroyed the GDP number. X this front loading. You would have had plus 3% GDP growth. But that's good. It put the administration on alert. Get it get it going here because you don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. you'll have a recession like Biden did in had a technical recession in 2022. Consumer confidence again COVID lows 2022 lows um and their retail spending is up so you can't make it up. Uh US small capitalization total return index is a percentage above its 1945 trend line average. So you get a few of these opportunities in a in a career. Um Kenneth French small cap US sector index total returns i.e. lowest 30% markets capitalization stocks average annualized small cap sector total return was 12.06. So you've had this zerp environment since 2009 uh where small caps have underperformed for a long period of time but that never holds ladies and gentlemen. I mean look you you saw the similar thing in the early 70s you saw it get pronounced in the early 2000s you saw it in the 50s and it's always followed by monstrous outperformance and um so that's what we do. We find dislocation, we bet sizably, and then we do it without margin or with very little margin and we wait and uh and over time some IRRs are off the charts, some take a little longer. It's lower IRS, but a blend over 10 12 positions uh and some extra juice on the derivative overlays and hedging and you're off to the races. So, uh recession this year, this has gone up to 72% chance. Um that's from Cali. So that's where sentiment is right now. Real consumer spending quarteron quarter is up 1.4% and that's similar to first quarter of last year. Uh it's actually more than that. It's like 1.7% if you look at this chart. W\n\nThey are going to have to chase up like it's going out of style. Oil and gas equipment services earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised down. These are going to get close to a bottom here soon. Um, a lot of the stock prices have held up, which is why I haven't run like crazy to get into them yet, but I'm keeping an eye on them regularly. ARC earnings down 5.5% for this year, 4.6% for next year. Always keeping an eye on that one because it's kind of the most speculative companies in the market. Uh, we covered the ADP report. The most important thing coming is the jobs report. expected only 129,000 jobs, non-farm payrolls, down from 228. This should, if we get a weak jobs report, if the ADP report is a precursor, you got three things going. You got the low PCE number, inflation number, you had uh the the labor market is where they're all focused. So, if the labor market's weak, if you got a tick up from 4.2 to say 4.3 or 4.4, four uh you could you know May becomes an interesting meeting but definitely June because it gives them cover. I mean if they could cut they would cut it's just they need cover. They can't speculate they have to justify and of oftentimes by the time you can justify like Buffett says if you wait for the Robins to sing it's already spring and you're too late. So, um, moving on to earnings, 73% beat rate, 10.1% year-on-year growth. That syncs with a 3% GDP number, X inventories versus the negative.3 that you saw with all the pull forward uh, impacting the net exports part of the equation. Uh, this is what I was talking about with estimates come down 3.6% from 275 to 265, but backend loaded 302. So you're looking at 302 divided by 265 13 14% earnings growth from this year to next year for the S&P 500 as it stands. So the question is whether the market can look through all of this and the answer we're going to find out, but I think can possibly be yes. So with that said , let's move on to the",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nthe Treasury was out this morning talking about an uh enhancements to their buyback program, which is uh uh pretty important because they want to bring down long-term borrowing rates. It's just a kind of fancy way of saying they're going to be in the market potentially buying more bonds, and we know what that looks like historically. So those three things point to yes, they're making these bold moves that are kind of disruptive and causing volatility, but they're paying attention and they don't want it to fall over the cliff. And it's earning season now. Before we get into the specific results, though, give us an overview for 2025. Thomas, yeah, look, I I think that uh the bad news is estimates have been coming down, okay, down 3.6% year to date on the S&P 500. Uh that means from $275 to $265. That's, you know, 20 times 2025 estimates is pretty rich. However, uh like all good estimates, they're backend loaded. 2026 estimates have been holding up at $32, which means right now we're at, you know, 18.5 times next year's earnings. The 10-year average is 18.3 times. We've had 36% of the companies report maybe a little more now uh this week over 10% earnings growth. So the world is not ending. I mean uh Lutnik Leutnik was out there yesterday saying I have a deal in my back pocket. It just has to be uh approved. Uh the administration continues to meet with uh uh CEOs like Walmart, Target, Home Depot. So they're getting the proper feedback and and the most important thing I think is that sentiment has been fully flushed out. Hedge funds and CTAs were record sellers on on April 8th in the hole at the worst possible time. So they are going to be forced buyers as we get any semblance of good news with deal flow and if Lutnik is correct and we get an announcement uh you're going to get a lot of people forced to buy. Uh Thomas, now let's talk about matter and Microsoft. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n results did not disappoint earlier on as well. Uh we heard from Sarah uh sharing with us uh Microsoft beat on both the top and bottom lines with its zero cloud business uh exceeded analysts estimates. Meta reporting uh rising revenue and profit helped by Instagram and Facebook ads. Were you expecting these results as well for these two companies? Well, look, we we really didn't know what to expect because you know going in guidance was pretty nice. I mean, you know, people were expecting earning uh revenues up 8%. They came in up 13% on Microsoft. They were expecting earnings up uh 10%. It came in at 18%. Uh people were a little worried about capex. That was up 53% year-on-year. There were all those rumors that they were, you know, cancelling leases and all that stuff. Well, it wasn't reflected in the numbers. and Azure the cloud was up 33% and they increased the guidance to 34 to 35% uh next quarter and they raised revenue guidance 1.25 25 billion. So, uh, in the kingdom of Microsoft, uh, pe people are still smiling. But it's not so great news for Qualcomm, isn't it? Because their revenue forecast missed estimates. Thomas, what happened there? Well, look, it always looks darkest before dawn. I mean, semiconductors, what people forgot is a very cyclical business. We're probably at or near some of the the the troughs in the uh semiconductor cycle. I think there's going to be opportunity, but it's going to take a few quarters. Uh we were at peak exuberance just a short while ago. Uh so it's uh it's a stock pickers market and I know that sounds cliche, but it it really is. I mean, you look at Meta uh also crushed it. They didn't have as aggressive uh guidance. Their their revenue guidance is in line with what we had been expecting, but they took capex up 8 billion and people were worried about capex. Ad revenues up 41.3 billion. uh were were 41.3 versus 40.4. That kind of tells us that the consumer is okay. People were worried about that. Daily active users 3.43 billion versus 3.39. So, you know, the rumors of the economic demise have been greatly exaggerated. I think we're we're chugging along. If the administration continues to show rationality and gets some reasonable deals and gets the rebalancing that they're looking for, uh I think there's a lot of pent up strength. Uh the risk is if they drag it out too long, people will lose the hope and once the confidence is gone, it's it's very hard to get back. And that would be a shame because all the money that they want to save on Doge and uh and uh sensible government spending, if you wind up in a recession, it's going to cost you a lot more to get it get you out of a recession with stimulus, etc., and the the declining uh tax revenues. So, they're threading a needle here. I think they're gonna be able to do it, but uh certainly pushing it up to the edge. Similar expectations you think for Apple and Amazon because they are expected to release uh their earnings uh report tomorrow after the closing bell. Yeah, look, I think rearview mirror, I think they're going to have great earnings and great revenues. The the question is going to be uh you know, a huge question for Apple as it relates to how they're thinking about China, both production and consumption. uh as it relates to Amazon, you've got a lot of Chinese sellers on the Amazon website. Uh so people are going to want to get some color around that. Meta alluded to that uh in their kind of talking about you know 10% of their ad revenues come from Chinese sellers. So we want to know we want to understand that from Amazon but Amazon is uh is a beast. I mean if you get an opportunity to buy it lower you take advantage of it. if you if you don't uh that's just the kind of business it is when the when the uh e-commerce side is a little slow, their cloud tends to do really well. Uh and they've got a phenomenal business. So we, you know, we'll we'll see. Are we going to get beats across the board? Microsoft Meta, uh Amazon, Amazon, Apple, we hope the market could use that. It looks, you know, a lot of these look pretty oversold. uh we just want to understand the guidance and looking at some of the capex uh guidance from Microsoft and from Meta holding in and raising capex it kind of points to positive things happening. I think probably the the one that is is um going to have people on edge is going to be Apple. We want to get some comfort around Apple uh with um you know things changing the environment changing a little bit for them particularly in China. Thomas, let's look ahead. I have you gaze into your crystal ball for a bit. I want to talk to you about your outlook on US earnings for 2026 and which sectors might be your most favored. Well, I think that, you know, as we get closer to 2026, you're going to start to see which sectors um are are looking like they're going to have growth. I would say there are a couple things that I'm paying attention to. Number one is uh materials have been beaten down. I think they're going to get a rebound once we get through all this tariff stuff. Okay. So, it's a little early for that. But I also like healthcare. Healthcare's got earnings growth. It's it it has the benefits of being defensive. It has the benefits that it's sold off enough. Particularly biotech. We've had a new FDA commissioner uh appointed Dr. Macker from John's Hopkins. He wants to focus on innovation uh and streamline streamlining regulation. So a userfriendly review process in English all that means is we're going to get more drugs and we're going to get more deal approval a favorable FTC and you know uh the pharma companies large pharma in the United States they have record cash on their balance sheets. The problem is they have no innovation and they've got a lot of patent cliffs. So rather than build it and take many years, they can just buy it uh because most of these biotech companies are trading at uh you know decade low valuations and uh and that's what what we're going to be seeing. So when you see a lot of deals and you see a lot of drug approvals, you see a lot of growth and you see a lot of money start to chase it. So, I think the surprise of the next 12 to 24 months is biotech's going to do exceptionally well. And I think some of the medical device companies once they get a sense of the landscape, they're defensive, but they've really been left for dead. They're highquality businesses. I think you're going to start to see spending ramp up. Um, you know, one in particular we like is Baxter because they've been able to delever their balance sheet. They sold their slowing grow slow growing kidney business uh for 3.8 billion to Carlilele. they'll pay down some debt and their multiple is probably going to rerate back to more normalized levels from 11 times back to 15 times uh as they focus on the IV business, the nutrition business, uh medical devices and and their pharma. So, uh the next catalyst for that company uh uh will be a new CEO announcement uh and uh you've got time to to own it. They're going to report earnings. I don't know what earnings will be tomorrow, but if you get weakness, it's probably a time to get involved. Uh, in our opinion, not advice. Thomas, we will be monitoring the developments very closely here as well on CN 938. And we, it's been a fun chat this morning. We hope to have you back. And when we do, uh, we look forward to more of your insights and perspectives. My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me. And that was Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Grid Hill Capital. ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nThere are no bad days in the market. When the market is down, you've got bargains. And it's a lovely to think about what you're buying at low prices. When the market's up, the bargains have gone, but you're rich. That's Bruce Greenwald. Uh he was a professor at Colombia Business School. Here's uh Seth Clarman. There's no such thing as a value company. Price is all that matters. At some price, an asset is a buy. At another, it's a hold. And at another, it's a sell. That's why we never enter an investment without knowing where we're getting out. Warren Buffett, investment students need only two well-taught courses. Number one, how to value a business. And number two, how to think about market prices. Treat the fluctuations as your friend, not as your enemy. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNow, on to data. Retail is only emotionally very downbeat on stocks. Allocations have barely dropped. Sentiment has been crushed but allocations are still up. Very similar to kind of what you saw uh since co professionals have been selling in the whole retail have been holding tight and doing very well. This is the Ryex bull bear ratio. You can see it's completely off the charts um bearish. Okay. And that's usually what you see at these bounces. that's across the board institutional. Um, and this is off the charts. So that that you know the thing the the number one thing you need to know about our situation is that institutions and hedge funds and CTAs record sold in the hole at the lows on April 9th or April 8th I think it was. Uh where are my notes? Anyway, the point is they record sold at the exact wrong time and what they are praying for is a retest of the lows, okay? Because they missed this move that retraced half the losses. Um, and usually praying doesn't work in investing. Uh, it frequently never works. So, if we start to see the deal that Lutnik referenced and we continue to see the type of flexibility we've seen on auto tariffs, on the 90-day pause, on other things, uh these guys are going to be forced buyers, okay, into any positive tape bomb like we saw good earnings after the bell, uh which we discussed on the radio show and more durable goods, new orders, non-defense aircraft and parts. through the roof. You know, we got a negative GDP print of.3. You take out the inventory loading because why? It's C plus I plus G plus X, consumption, investment, government spending, which was down, and uh net exports, which everyone was importing ahead of the tariffs. Um, and you would wind up with plus 3% GDP instead of negative.3. That said, you still have a negative GDP growth. So, the administration has to beware not to get two consecutive ne negative quarters, meaning tidy up and get some deals announced. So, you get these forced buyers. Consumer confidence comes back. Earnings keeps going. Earnings are up 10% year-on-year, but that's backward looking. Guidance has been okay, but a little bit dicey depending on the company. ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUm, now here's a chart that's really interesting. Since Deep Seek's arrival, MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you can see here on balance uh a lot more than the S&P 500 which is down you know 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says June rate move in play if data is clear. big importance on the jobs report if that confirms the ADP and the labor market is softening. Uh the May meeting is going to be interesting but the June meeting could be active. Uh, and that's a key thing I want to emphasize also. Uh, let's just see here. I posted on Twitter. Um, the Fed, the Treasury is looking [Music] to increase the enhance the Treasury buyback program, which is effectively a cute way of saying a new form of quantitative easing without calling it quantitative easing, which we had been talking about get ready for. You can see uh w\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nUS needs more power for AI, but critical equipment is pricey and scarce. Tariffs create new challenges for an industry overwhelmed by the sheer number of projects in line to connect to the nation's power grid. Uh these people will all be parading down to Mara Lago and Washington to make their case and eventually these things are going to get mitigated. PayPal reports f strong first quarter earnings. CEO says the turnaround is working. We agree. Venmo revenue grows 20% with the debit card payment volume soaring. So everything he said he was going to do is taking place. Intel says clients preparing to test new production processes process Uh, Intel is trying to break into the outsourced chipm industry and prospective clients are preparing to try out its new 14A production process. Multiple customers have expressed their intent to build these test chips on the new process node which will follow 18A scheduled to go into production the second half of this year. New CEO Lip Boutan is committed to the foundry operation and will leverage his relationships in the chip industry to make Intel's factory more attractive prospect for outside customers. etc. Okay, so that's going to just take a little while and it's going to happen. Years after failed AI deals, Intel plans homegrown challenge to Nvidia. Intel CEO says he met with Taiwan semiconductor CEO to discuss collaboration. India plans to highlight Boeing order pipeline in US trade talks. They're like, we'll take all of China's planes. Thank you very much. Americans are downbeat on the economy.

PayPal update. So, you can see here, we're going to cover some key tips. Cash flow is still at and near record highs. Stock price at near record lows. we that we play those divergences for a living and uh play the time arbitrage game when everyone's dumping in the hole and fundamentals are improving. We're buying handover fist and we wait for the recovery aka turnaround Tom. Maybe we'll have to put those uh uh slogans on the next batch of mer in the merch store. Uh which would be a lot of fun. You can see the share count coming down from 1.2 2 billion down to 970 million continuing to go down. Um so let's go through some of the commentary. PayPal delivered yet another strong quarter earlier this week. Non-GAAP ET EPS of 133 came in well ahead of 116 consensus while revenue of 7.8 billion was a slight $40 million miss. Again for those calling out the slow growth, this is a deliberate shift in strategy. Since stepping in, Alex Chris has made it a clear priority to move away from growth at all costs and cut empty calorie revenues that were popular under prior leadership. The focus now is on PayPal's most important metric, transaction margin. Shifting away from unprofitable volume is expected to create a 5 to 6% headwind to topline revenue this year. Most of that impact will be lapped in the back half of the year and things should start to reacelerate from there. You can see this shift reflected in uh brain tree growth which has slowed from 24% in Q1 2024 to just 2% this quarter. If you're holding your if your holding period stretches beyond the next quarter or two, this is a welcome change. Not to mention transaction margins are now shifting sitting at a 2year high. Okay, this is the name of the game. If you if we had to sum up this quarter in one line, it would be quote just getting started. In fact, Alex, Chris, and Co used that phrase along with early days a total of five times during the earnings call, and that makes sense. 2024 was always seen as a transition year, while 2025 is all about scaling product adoption, and ramping up new initiatives.

This quarter that was on full display. Whether it's leaning into buy now, pay later, launching the ads business, scaling Fast Lane, rolling out the PayPal Everywhere campaign, or finally  monetizing Venmo, the flywheel is clearly starting to spin. In Alex Chris's own words, PayPal is transforming from just a payments company into a commerce platform right in front of your eyes. Now, there's one thing that stood out to us. Guidance. Despite crushing EPS expectations this quarter and issuing a very strong Q2 guidance, PayPal chose in typical Sandbagger fashion to leave full year 2025 guidance unchanged. We understand the need to stay cautious given the macro uncertainty, but let's be clear, this is sandbagger city. In our latest article, last article on PayPal, we hi highlighted how 2024 results came in well above initial guidance. We also laid out the potential upside if PayPal delivers similar surprises in 2025. The chart below speaks for itself. So they said 383, they came in 465, that was 21% upside on earnings. Free cash flow, they said 5 billion, they came in at 6.8, that's 36% upside. They said share repurchases at 5 billion. They came in at 6 billion, that was 20% upside. If they do those type of upside surprise percentages beyond what they are guiding, $5.3 for earnings, $6.5 billion of cash flow, and 6 billion a share repurchases, you wind up with greater than $6 of earnings, greater than $8.8 billion of free cash flow, and greater than $7.2 billion of share buybacks. Okay, here's another way to look at current management's guidance that makes the sandbagging hard to ignore. It's no surprise that PayPal has historically been back half weighted. Q3 gets a lift from back to school shopping and Q4 benefits from the holiday shopping season with Q2 EPS guided to 130. This implies first half EPS would total 263. Keep in mind management full year's guidance midpoint is 503. This suggests just 240 in EPS for the entire second half. This doesn't seem to add up. Looking at quarterly EPS chart above, you can see just how rare this would be if this actually played out. In seven of the last nine years, second half EPS was higher than first half, often doubledigit percentages. In six of those nine years, Q1 was the lowest quarter. Not to mention, Q4 has never been the lowest quarter for current guidance to hold. Payal's entire seasonal pattern would need to be flipped on its head. I.e., we'd have to put Christmas in January. We'd assign the odds of this happening as slim to none. Meanwhile, PayPal continues to roll out new growth drivers. NFC launches in Germany in Q2.

PayPal Everyw### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is  expanding in the UK in Q3. Fast Lane and the ads business continue to scale. And none of this is reflected in guidance. Ladies and gentlemen, this is sandbagging at its finest. As the saying goes, history doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes. Don't be shocked if we see similar upside surprises just like we did in 2024. Here's a detailed breakdown of everything you need to know following PayPal's first quarter. Fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with progress across branded checkout, PSP, Omni Channel, and Venmo. Uh transaction margin dollars increased 7%. Uh other key points returned $ 1.5 billion to stockholders by repurchasing approximately 19 million of shares in common stock in 1Q 2025. uh on a trailing 12-month basis, returned $6 billion to stockholders by repurchasing approximately 86 million shares of common stock. Total payment volume was up. So, you can look through this. You can look through the pitchbook. Um more emphasis on profit over growth. The uh cash free cash flow guidance is still between 6 to 7 which implies 8.8 if they have the same beat rate. the impact. So this quarter free cash flow includes negative impacts from the timing between originating European buy now pay later to receivables as HFS and the subsequent sale of these receivables, changes in the working capital and shifting portion a portion of annual incentive plan from stock to cash which is fantastic. They used to give out stock like candy. So here are the key points. One, PayPal saw their fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with transaction margin expanding over 270 basis points year-over-year to 47.7% a 2-year high. Declining transaction margin was always a part of the bare case on PayPal. Alex Chris and the team have flipped this on his head. Two, adjusted free cash flow came in a bit light at 1.4 billion, down from 1.86 prior year. While PayPal's free cash flow has always been a bit lumpy, a big driver, this was the shift away from stock-based compensation, which they used to give out like candy to cash as part of annual incentive plan. We love this. We want people to own stock, but not all the stock. This is a welcome change. Most importantly, management maintain the annual guidance range of 6 to7 billion of free cash flow, i.e. 8 plus. Uh share purchases total. We covered that 15 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, just 12.6 6 billion in debt along with what we believe is the opportunity to buy $1 bills for 50 cents. Repurchases should ramp up at these levels. Venmo's Verb buy now pay later later continues to stand out. And then the ad business with Mark Grether who ran the Uber and Amazon ad businesses active accounts all-time highs. PayPal Everywhere campaign featuring Will Frell launched in September. Since then, PayPal debit card has added 4 million new active accounts. Total payment volume from the debit card is up over 100% with strong economics both online and offline. More earnings call highlights. You should read through that on hedge funtips.com by the way. You can so you can go there just click on commentary and all of our articles come up. All right. So now getting into Lip Bhutan. Look, all you need to know about Lip Bhutan is he's coming to turn around the company. He did the exact same thing in Cadence Designs. You can see when he got in at $3.50 a share in 2009. Uh when he left in May of 2023, it was $239. He had a 68 bagger 6,800% in 16 in 14 years. 1 million became 68 million. I'm not saying he's going to do that with Intel, but I do think four or five bagger is in the cards if you get this thing four to five years to play out. Maybe a little sooner because this guy is a miracle worker. Uh, and probably 90% of the work was done by Gellzinger as it relates to getting these foundaries in place. So, you can go through all of this detailed stuff. Uh, kudos. Jeff did a great job on getting through some of this stuff and then the key points again uh you can go through with that some highlights on Etsy which we're going to do in more detail next week as well as Generrack. Okay, Generrack beat uh Etsy showing some good stuff on one of its platforms, the other platform they're selling. Free cash flow continues to hum. Uh here's the fear and greed index down at 39. National Association of Active Investment Managers, they they sold all in the hole at the beginning of April, down to 35% equity exposure. They are going to have to chase up like it's going out of style. Oil and gas equipment services earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised down. These are going to get close to a bottom here soon. Um, a lot of the stock prices have held up, which is why I haven't run like crazy to get into them yet, but I'm keeping an eye on them regularly. ARC earnings down 5.5% for this year, 4.6% for next year. Always keeping an eye on that one because it's kind of the most speculative companies in the market. Uh, we covered the ADP report. The most important thing coming is the jobs report. expected only 129,000 jobs, non-farm payrolls, down from 228. This should, if we get a weak jobs report, if the ADP report is a precursor, you got three things going. You got the low PCE number, inflation number, you had uh the the labor market is where they're all focused. So, if the labor market's weak, if you got a tick up from 4.2 to say 4.3 or 4.4, four uh you could you know May becomes an interesting meeting but definitely June because it gives them cover. I mean if they could cut they would cut it's just they need cover. They can't speculate they have to justify and of oftentimes by the time you can justify like Buffett says if you wait for the Robins to sing it's already spring and you're too late. So, um, moving on to earnings, 73% beat rate, 10.1% year-on-year growth. That syncs with a 3% GDP number, X inventories versus the negative.3 that you saw with all the pull forward uh, impacting the net exports part of the equation. Uh, this is what I was talking about with estimates come down 3.6% from 275 to 265, but backend loaded 302. So you're looking at 302 divided by 265 13 14% earnings growth from this year to next year for the S&P 500 as it stands. So the question is whether the market can look through all of this and the answer we're going to find out, but I think can possibly be yes. So",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\nthe Treasury was out this morning talking about an uh enhancements to their buyback program, which is uh uh pretty important because they want to bring down long-term borrowing rates. It's just a kind of fancy way of saying they're going to be in the market potentially buying more bonds, and we know what that looks like historically. So those three things point to yes, they're making these bold moves that are kind of disruptive and causing volatility, but they're paying attention and they don't want it to fall over the cliff. And it's earning season now. Before we get into the specific results, though, give us an overview for 2025. Thomas, yeah, look, I I think that uh the bad news is estimates have been coming down, okay, down 3.6% year to date on the S&P 500. Uh that means from $275 to $265. That's, you know, 20 times 2025 estimates is pretty rich. However, uh like all good estimates, they're backend loaded. 2026 estimates have been holding up at $32, which means right now we're at, you know, 18.5 times next year's earnings. The 10-year average is 18.3 times. We've had 36% of the companies report maybe a little more now uh this week over 10% earnings growth. So the world is not ending. I mean uh Lutnik Leutnik was out there yesterday saying I have a deal in my back pocket. It just has to be uh approved. Uh the administration continues to meet with uh uh CEOs like Walmart, Target, Home Depot. So they're getting the proper feedback and and the most important thing I think is that sentiment has been fully flushed out. Hedge funds and CTAs were record sellers on on April 8th in the hole at the worst possible time. So they are going to be forced buyers as we get any semblance of good news with deal flow and if Lutnik is correct and we get an announcement uh you're going to get a lot of people forced to buy. Uh Thomas, now let's talk about matter and Microsoft. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n results did not disappoint earlier on as well. Uh we heard from Sarah uh sharing with us uh Microsoft beat on both the top and bottom lines with its zero cloud business uh exceeded analysts estimates. Meta reporting uh rising revenue and profit helped by Instagram and Facebook ads. Were you expecting these results as well for these two companies? Well, look, we we really didn't know what to expect because you know going in guidance was pretty nice. I mean, you know, people were expecting earning uh revenues up 8%. They came in up 13% on Microsoft. They were expecting earnings up uh 10%. It came in at 18%. Uh people were a little worried about capex. That was up 53% year-on-year. There were all those rumors that they were, you know, cancelling leases and all that stuff. Well, it wasn't reflected in the numbers. and Azure the cloud was up 33% and they increased the guidance to 34 to 35% uh next quarter and they raised revenue guidance 1.25 25 billion. So, uh, in the kingdom of Microsoft, uh, pe people are still smiling. But it's not so great news for Qualcomm, isn't it? Because their revenue forecast missed estimates. Thomas, what happened there? Well, look, it always looks darkest before dawn. I mean, semiconductors, what people forgot is a very cyclical business. We're probably at or near some of the the the troughs in the uh semiconductor cycle. I think there's going to be opportunity, but it's going to take a few quarters. Uh we were at peak exuberance just a short while ago. Uh so it's uh it's a stock pickers market and I know that sounds cliche, but it it really is. I mean, you look at Meta uh also crushed it. They didn't have as aggressive uh guidance. Their their revenue guidance is in line with what we had been expecting, but they took capex up 8 billion and people were worried about capex. Ad revenues up 41.3 billion. uh were were 41.3 versus 40.4. That kind of tells us that the consumer is okay. People were worried about that. Daily active users 3.43 billion versus 3.39. So, you know, the rumors of the economic demise have been greatly exaggerated. I think we're we're chugging along. If the administration continues to show rationality and gets some reasonable deals and gets the rebalancing that they're looking for, uh I think there's a lot of pent up strength. Uh the risk is if they drag it out too long, people will lose the hope and once the confidence is gone, it's it's very hard to get back. And that would be a shame because all the money that they want to save on Doge and uh and uh sensible government spending, if you wind up in a recession, it's going to cost you a lot more to get it get you out of a recession with stimulus, etc., and the the declining uh tax revenues. So, they're threading a needle here. I think they're gonna be able to do it, but uh certainly pushing it up to the edge. Similar expectations you think for Apple and Amazon because they are expected to release uh their earnings uh report tomorrow after the closing bell. Yeah, look, I think rearview mirror, I think they're going to have great earnings and great revenues. The the question is going to be uh you know, a huge question for Apple as it relates to how they're thinking about China, both production and consumption. uh as it relates to Amazon, you've got a lot of Chinese sellers on the Amazon website. Uh so people are going to want to get some color around that. Meta alluded to that uh in their kind of talking about you know 10% of their ad revenues come from Chinese sellers. So we want to know we want to understand that from Amazon but Amazon is uh is a beast. I mean if you get an opportunity to buy it lower you take advantage of it. if you if you don't uh that's just the kind of business it is when the when the uh e-commerce side is a little slow, their cloud tends to do really well. Uh and they've got a phenomenal business. So we, you know, we'll we'll see. Are we going to get beats across the board? Microsoft Meta, uh Amazon, Amazon, Apple, we hope the market could use that. It looks, you know, a lot of these look pretty oversold. uh we just want to understand the guidance and looking at some of the capex uh guidance from Microsoft and from Meta holding in and raising capex it kind of points to positive things happening. I think probably the the one that is is um going to have people on edge is going to be Apple. We want to get some comfort around Apple uh with um you know things changing the environment changing a little bit for them particularly in China. Thomas, let's look ahead. I have you gaze into your crystal ball for a bit. I want to talk to you about your outlook on US earnings for 2026 and which sectors might be your most favored. Well, I think that, you know, as we get closer to 2026, you're going to start to see which sectors um are are looking like they're going to have growth. I would say there are a couple things that I'm paying attention to. Number one is uh materials have been beaten down. I think they're going to get a rebound once we get through all this tariff stuff. Okay. So, it's a little early for that. But I also like healthcare. Healthcare's got earnings growth. It's it it has the benefits of being defensive. It has the benefits that it's sold off enough. Particularly biotech. We've had a new FDA commissioner uh appointed Dr. Macker from John's Hopkins. He wants to focus on innovation uh and streamline streamlining regulation. So a userfriendly review process in English all that means is we're going to get more drugs and we're going to get more deal approval a favorable FTC and you know uh the pharma companies large pharma in the United States they have record cash on their balance sheets. The problem is they have no innovation and they've got a lot of patent cliffs. So rather than build it and take many years, they can just buy it uh because most of these biotech companies are trading at uh you know decade low valuations and uh and that's what what we're going to be seeing. So when you see a lot of deals and you see a lot of drug approvals, you see a lot of growth and you see a lot of money start to chase it. So, I think the surprise of the next 12 to 24 months is biotech's going to do exceptionally well. And I think some of the medical device companies once they get a sense of the landscape, they're defensive, but they've really been left for dead. They're highquality businesses. I think you're going to start to see spending ramp up. Um, you know, one in particular we like is Baxter because they've been able to delever their balance sheet. They sold their slowing grow slow growing kidney business uh for 3.8 billion to Carlilele. they'll pay down some debt and their multiple is probably going to rerate back to more normalized levels from 11 times back to 15 times uh as they focus on the IV business, the nutrition business, uh medical devices and and their pharma. So, uh the next catalyst for that company uh uh will be a new CEO announcement uh and uh you've got time to to own it. They're going to report earnings. I don't know what earnings will be tomorrow, but if you get weakness, it's probably a time to get involved. Uh, in our opinion, not advice. Thomas, we will be monitoring the developments very closely here as well on CN 938. And we, it's been a fun chat this morning. We hope to have you back. And when we do, uh, we look forward to more of your insights and perspectives. My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me. And that was Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Grid Hill Capital. ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nThere are no bad days in the market. When the market is down, you've got bargains. And it's a lovely to think about what you're buying at low prices. When the market's up, the bargains have gone, but you're rich. That's Bruce Greenwald. Uh he was a professor at Colombia Business School. Here's uh Seth Clarman. There's no such thing as a value company. Price is all that matters. At some price, an asset is a buy. At another, it's a hold. And at another, it's a sell. That's why we never enter an investment without knowing where we're getting out. Warren Buffett, investment students need only two well-taught courses. Number one, how to value a business. And number two, how to think about market prices. Treat the fluctuations as your friend, not as your enemy. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNow, on to data. Retail is only emotionally very downbeat on stocks. Allocations have barely dropped. Sentiment has been crushed but allocations are still up. Very similar to kind of what you saw uh since co professionals have been selling in the whole retail have been holding tight and doing very well. This is the Ryex bull bear ratio. You can see it's completely off the charts um bearish. Okay. And that's usually what you see at these bounces. that's across the board institutional. Um, and this is off the charts. So that that you know the thing the the number one thing you need to know about our situation is that institutions and hedge funds and CTAs record sold in the hole at the lows on April 9th or April 8th I think it was. Uh where are my notes? Anyway, the point is they record sold at the exact wrong time and what they are praying for is a retest of the lows, okay? Because they missed this move that retraced half the losses. Um, and usually praying doesn't work in investing. Uh, it frequently never works. So, if we start to see the deal that Lutnik referenced and we continue to see the type of flexibility we've seen on auto tariffs, on the 90-day pause, on other things, uh these guys are going to be forced buyers, okay, into any positive tape bomb like we saw good earnings after the bell, uh which we discussed on the radio show and more durable goods, new orders, non-defense aircraft and parts. through the roof. You know, we got a negative GDP print of.3. You take out the inventory loading because why? It's C plus I plus G plus X, consumption, investment, government spending, which was down, and uh net exports, which everyone was importing ahead of the tariffs. Um, and you would wind up with plus 3% GDP instead of negative.3. That said, you still have a negative GDP growth. So, the administration has to beware not to get two consecutive ne negative quarters, meaning tidy up and get some deals announced. So, you get these forced buyers. Consumer confidence comes back. Earnings keeps going. Earnings are up 10% year-on-year, but that's backward looking. Guidance has been okay, but a little bit dicey depending on the company. ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUm, now here's a chart that's really interesting. Since Deep Seek's arrival, MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you can see here on balance uh a lot more than the S&P 500 which is down you know 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says June rate move in play if data is clear. big importance on the jobs report if that confirms the ADP and the labor market is softening. Uh the May meeting is going to be interesting but the June meeting could be active. Uh, and that's a key thing I want to emphasize also. Uh, let's just see here. I posted on Twitter. Um, the Fed, the Treasury is looking [Music] to increase the enhance the Treasury buyback program, which is effectively a cute way of saying a new form of quantitative easing without calling it quantitative easing, which we had been talking about get ready for. You can see uh w",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nthe Treasury was out this morning talking about an uh enhancements to their buyback program, which is uh uh pretty important because they want to bring down long-term borrowing rates. It's just a kind of fancy way of saying they're going to be in the market potentially buying more bonds, and we know what that looks like historically. So those three things point to yes, they're making these bold moves that are kind of disruptive and causing volatility, but they're paying attention and they don't want it to fall over the cliff. And it's earning season now. Before we get into the specific results, though, give us an overview for 2025. Thomas, yeah, look, I I think that uh the bad news is estimates have been coming down, okay, down 3.6% year to date on the S&P 500. Uh that means from $275 to $265. That's, you know, 20 times 2025 estimates is pretty rich. However, uh like all good estimates, they're backend loaded. 2026 estimates have been holding up at $32, which means right now we're at, you know, 18.5 times next year's earnings. The 10-year average is 18.3 times. We've had 36% of the companies report maybe a little more now uh this week over 10% earnings growth. So the world is not ending. I mean uh Lutnik Leutnik was out there yesterday saying I have a deal in my back pocket. It just has to be uh approved. Uh the administration continues to meet with uh uh CEOs like Walmart, Target, Home Depot. So they're getting the proper feedback and and the most important thing I think is that sentiment has been fully flushed out. Hedge funds and CTAs were record sellers on on April 8th in the hole at the worst possible time. So they are going to be forced buyers as we get any semblance of good news with deal flow and if Lutnik is correct and we get an announcement uh you're going to get a lot of people forced to buy. Uh Thomas, now let's talk about matter and Microsoft. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n results did not disappoint earlier on as well. Uh we heard from Sarah uh sharing with us uh Microsoft beat on both the top and bottom lines with its zero cloud business uh exceeded analysts estimates. Meta reporting uh rising revenue and profit helped by Instagram and Facebook ads. Were you expecting these results as well for these two companies? Well, look, we we really didn't know what to expect because you know going in guidance was pretty nice. I mean, you know, people were expecting earning uh revenues up 8%. They came in up 13% on Microsoft. They were expecting earnings up uh 10%. It came in at 18%. Uh people were a little worried about capex. That was up 53% year-on-year. There were all those rumors that they were, you know, cancelling leases and all that stuff. Well, it wasn't reflected in the numbers. and Azure the cloud was up 33% and they increased the guidance to 34 to 35% uh next quarter and they raised revenue guidance 1.25 25 billion. So, uh, in the kingdom of Microsoft, uh, pe people are still smiling. But it's not so great news for Qualcomm, isn't it? Because their revenue forecast missed estimates. Thomas, what happened there? Well, look, it always looks darkest before dawn. I mean, semiconductors, what people forgot is a very cyclical business. We're probably at or near some of the the the troughs in the uh semiconductor cycle. I think there's going to be opportunity, but it's going to take a few quarters. Uh we were at peak exuberance just a short while ago. Uh so it's uh it's a stock pickers market and I know that sounds cliche, but it it really is. I mean, you look at Meta uh also crushed it. They didn't have as aggressive uh guidance. Their their revenue guidance is in line with what we had been expecting, but they took capex up 8 billion and people were worried about capex. Ad revenues up 41.3 billion. uh were were 41.3 versus 40.4. That kind of tells us that the consumer is okay. People were worried about that. Daily active users 3.43 billion versus 3.39. So, you know, the rumors of the economic demise have been greatly exaggerated. I think we're we're chugging along. If the administration continues to show rationality and gets some reasonable deals and gets the rebalancing that they're looking for, uh I think there's a lot of pent up strength. Uh the risk is if they drag it out too long, people will lose the hope and once the confidence is gone, it's it's very hard to get back. And that would be a shame because all the money that they want to save on Doge and uh and uh sensible government spending, if you wind up in a recession, it's going to cost you a lot more to get it get you out of a recession with stimulus, etc., and the the declining uh tax revenues. So, they're threading a needle here. I think they're gonna be able to do it, but uh certainly pushing it up to the edge. Similar expectations you think for Apple and Amazon because they are expected to release uh their earnings uh report tomorrow after the closing bell. Yeah, look, I think rearview mirror, I think they're going to have great earnings and great revenues. The the question is going to be uh you know, a huge question for Apple as it relates to how they're thinking about China, both production and consumption. uh as it relates to Amazon, you've got a lot of Chinese sellers on the Amazon website. Uh so people are going to want to get some color around that. Meta alluded to that uh in their kind of talking about you know 10% of their ad revenues come from Chinese sellers. So we want to know we want to understand that from Amazon but Amazon is uh is a beast. I mean if you get an opportunity to buy it lower you take advantage of it. if you if you don't uh that's just the kind of business it is when the when the uh e-commerce side is a little slow, their cloud tends to do really well. Uh and they've got a phenomenal business. So we, you know, we'll we'll see. Are we going to get beats across the board? Microsoft Meta, uh Amazon, Amazon, Apple, we hope the market could use that. It looks, you know, a lot of these look pretty oversold. uh we just want to understand the guidance and looking at some of the capex uh guidance from Microsoft and from Meta holding in and raising capex it kind of points to positive things happening. I think probably the the one that is is um going to have people on edge is going to be Apple. We want to get some comfort around Apple uh with um you know things changing the environment changing a little bit for them particularly in China. Thomas, let's look ahead. I have you gaze into your crystal ball for a bit. I want to talk to you about your outlook on US earnings for 2026 and which sectors might be your most favored. Well, I think that, you know, as we get closer to 2026, you're going to start to see which sectors um are are looking like they're going to have growth. I would say there are a couple things that I'm paying attention to. Number one is uh materials have been beaten down. I think they're going to get a rebound once we get through all this tariff stuff. Okay. So, it's a little early for that. But I also like healthcare. Healthcare's got earnings growth. It's it it has the benefits of being defensive. It has the benefits that it's sold off enough. Particularly biotech. We've had a new FDA commissioner uh appointed Dr. Macker from John's Hopkins. He wants to focus on innovation uh and streamline streamlining regulation. So a userfriendly review process in English all that means is we're going to get more drugs and we're going to get more deal approval a favorable FTC and you know uh the pharma companies large pharma in the United States they have record cash on their balance sheets. The problem is they have no innovation and they've got a lot of patent cliffs. So rather than build it and take many years, they can just buy it uh because most of these biotech companies are trading at uh you know decade low valuations and uh and that's what what we're going to be seeing. So when you see a lot of deals and you see a lot of drug approvals, you see a lot of growth and you see a lot of money start to chase it. So, I think the surprise of the next 12 to 24 months is biotech's going to do exceptionally well. And I think some of the medical device companies once they get a sense of the landscape, they're defensive, but they've really been left for dead. They're highquality businesses. I think you're going to start to see spending ramp up. Um, you know, one in particular we like is Baxter because they've been able to delever their balance sheet. They sold their slowing grow slow growing kidney business uh for 3.8 billion to Carlilele. they'll pay down some debt and their multiple is probably going to rerate back to more normalized levels from 11 times back to 15 times uh as they focus on the IV business, the nutrition business, uh medical devices and and their pharma. So, uh the next catalyst for that company uh uh will be a new CEO announcement uh and uh you've got time to to own it. They're going to report earnings. I don't know what earnings will be tomorrow, but if you get weakness, it's probably a time to get involved. Uh, in our opinion, not advice. Thomas, we will be monitoring the developments very closely here as well on CN 938. And we, it's been a fun chat this morning. We hope to have you back. And when we do, uh, we look forward to more of your insights and perspectives. My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me.

Since Deep Seek's arrival, MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you can see here on balance uh a lot more than the S&P 500 which is down you know 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says June rate move in play if data is clear. big importance on the jobs report if that confirms the ADP and the labor market is softening. Uh the May meeting is going to be interesting but the June meeting could be active. Uh, and that's a key thing I want to emphasize also. Uh, let's just see here. I posted on Twitter. Um, the Fed, the Treasury is looking [Music] to increase the enhance the Treasury buyback program, which is effectively a cute way of saying a new form of quantitative easing without calling it quantitative easing, which we had been talking about get ready for. You can see uh w\n\nthat 10-year yield is going to keep coming down. That's going to be a boon for housing, GenerRack, Stanley Black & Decker, uh, QXO, and more. Uh, Treasuring is Treasury is evaluating potential enhancements to its buyback program to better achieve liquidity, support cash management goals, uh, improves its efficacy, changes to maximum purchase amounts, wink wink. Uh, so quantitative tightening will be a rear view mirror either in uh, May or June. And this treasury buyback program aka different method same outcome QE type of program will be in place and they will hit that plus the bank deregulation taking the charges from holding the treasuries will you get 30 business points there you probably get another 30 to 40 here you could see 375 then you got a five and change 30-year fix and then we're just completely off to the faces with all the millennials that are overdue uh in demand for houses. US dollar depreciation, emerging markets outperforms developed markets. I think as I said, you know, there were the covers of the dollar weakness, dollar demise. I think we're ready for a dollar bounce. Uh it will be a counter trend bounce, but um just just be ready for that. Estimated foreign ownership of US treasuries as a share of publicly held debt going down. biggest four-week inflow into Treasury since March of 2023. That was the mini banking crisis, by the way. Short Wall Street, long Main Street, very similar. So, Ferrari is collapsing. Dollar General is appreciating. We like that story. Asset bubbles of the last 50 years. So, you can see ARC and Bitcoin in 2021. MAG7, biotech, China, housing, internet, Asia, Japan, gold. that just rinse and repeat. We estimate moderate selling of US equities by foreign investors across March and April. That's from Goldman Sachs. Another rare bullish breath thrust from Brian Dietrich over at Carson. 12 months later, uh average return 18.9%, median is 17.9. That's off the lows. So, it's also in line with what we've been saying since the end of last year, beginning of this year, which is when all is said and done, uh, uh, high single digits to low double digits on the S&P for the year. Extremely strong breath the last three days. 12 months out, you see the results in bigger terms. Um, same thing here. S&P performance after three consecutive days gains of 1.5% 1950 through current 12 months out you're up 20%. Uh ran very bullish breath thrust just uh triggered zag breath thrust signals since World War II. We had one actually recently in 2023 12 months later up 32% on average up 23%. So, those of you who took me up on my urging to add more money and or get started with us uh in late March, early April, midappril uh smart move. You're going to look back 12 months from now and really pat yourself on the back and the existing clients because we got the benefit of international in the first quarter and um and everything in place moving through the end of the year. So very excited all around. Uh here's the dollar end of the dollar. Um all bearish on Trump. This, by the way, this could, you know, you're kind of peak pessimism on Trump. If you look at the polls, sure it could get worse before it gets better, but my guess is you get a deal signed and this guy's going to if he pulls it off. I mean, I I didn't like Letic getting on TV and saying, \"Well, you know, it's not my fault. It's it's Besson's fault with China, blah, blah, blah.\" or Besson's in charge of China, yada yada yada. Uh, I'm in charge of the rest of the world. Uh, anyway, the point is you get that first India deal or the first Japan deal, serious country across the tape and man, all those guys that sold in the whole desperate for a retest or a marginal new low are going to be panic buying because they've already had to cover up and get their face ripped off on the short rally. Uh they should have listened when Trump said today's the day to buy. That was the bottom. And then today he said be patient. America is gonna boom. Uh he's probably not putting that out there if he doesn't have something in his hand. Dollar comes under pressure when US PMIs underperform which could imply PMIs could start to turn. Let's see. Index of consumer sentiment by political party. Democrats couldn't be more pessimistic right now. Republicans couldn't be more optimistic. Kind of the same thing when Biden was in. So although um kind of everyone was pessimistic when Biden leaving that aside, uh it's typical people unfortunately make investment decisions based on their politics and it often proves to be very very detrimental in the long term. uh the mark stock market did very well under Biden and if you're a Republican and you missed that, shame on you and uh we'll probably do the economy will probably do very well under Trump and you know getting through these next few months. Uh and it, you know, if you're uh pessimistic because you don't like the personality, I think you're going to miss out. Uh fewer Europeans traveling to the US. Okay, the Euro is going to appreciate. they'll be here uh and continue to appreciate. S&P realized average stock correlation has moved up this year. That usually happens in draw downs. This will start to come down as we uh get some deals across the tape. Jet Goldman Sachs optimism tracker hasn't been this low since the 2022 lows and then the COVID lows and then the great financial crisis lows. Wall Street forecasts take a massive hit amid tariff turmoil. So, they're take they're all taking their price targets down at the exact wrong time. Typical car dealership guy. Consumers are about to drop 55.8 billion on new cars in April. That's a 21.2% year-over-year increase and third highest month on record. The reasons are a few. Retail new vehicle sales are expected to reach just under 1.3 million, a 14.7% increase year-on-year. Uh 139,000 of those were accelerated vehicle purchases. Average new car transaction price is expected to reach $45,000. Uh up $887 yearon year and 975 month. But with many buyers having pulled forward their purchases and affordability still tight, the momentum bait may be hard to sustain into summer. Yeah. Except that now they've got to replenish the inventory. So we're worried about production from a Cooper Standard standpoint. Not as much retail. We definitely want to see the sell through. But it's like gener when when your neighbor gets a new car, you get a new car. When your neighbor gets a generator, you get a new generator. This game has been delayed for 13.5 years. It's on now. And if Bessant does what he says he's going to do with the 10-year Treasury, uh financing, all that. It'll be party like, you know, plus all the untapped home equity that'll get ticked if we get uh HELOCs at 5% again. The game will be on like nobody's business. Share of national housing inventory for sale with a price cut in March is going up. Affordability is coming uh becoming better. Weekly announced buyback starting to go back up. They the the companies are buying in the hole which is good to see. We've seen it across our portfolio. Percent of Humish respondents making unsolicited positive or negative comments on government economic policy uh through the roof. There you go. UK retail sales moving up. largest monthly net injection. Uh this is Chinese stimulus through the roof PBOC net injection 1 trillion yuan. Okay. Little reward on the beats. Misses punished more than usual. A lot of skepticism. That makes sense. average pair-wise correlation between TLT, SPY, DXY, which is the dollar for one month. Um, you haven't seen this since 2020 and that was when you wanted to be a buyer. US stocks off to worst start against global peers in more than 30 years. You were positioned to this if you listen to the podcast in late 2024. We kept pounding the table. International, international, international has outperformed by some 15%. Uh boomers made up almost half of US home buyers in 2024. The millennials is where we're going to see this thing boom as we get the supply as the federal lands open, as rates come down. Median two-week S&P return since 1950. Okay, they're showing first half of May is a little bit weak. I I wouldn't that's not been the case the last four or five years. I saw some stats going out that that May 1st to the 30th has actually been up. And in years where you have uh weakness in the first half, which is atypical outside of February, uh you tend to have stronger summers. So just be open-minded to that. Scott Brown, let's see. After being down more than 13, S&P is now down just yeah, 13% year to date, but it was down 19% peak to trough. Um prior record saw the index down 9in. Okay, so big reversal there. Dogee candlestick or whatever you want to call it. Uh magnificent 7 versus US dollar index as the dollar's dropped. Uh interesting correlation since 2024. So if you see a bounce in the dollar and then now you've got MAG 7 bouncing with earnings that that could be positive all around. EPS beat rate improved sequentially. Uh, I think it's 73% so far versus 67 average. Central banks are a potent force in gold buying. They always buy the top, ladies and gentlemen. You do not want to be buying gold here in my humble opinion. It's not what I do, but just Spidey sense. Take it for what it's worth. All this is opinion, not advice. Anyway, go to hedge funips.com, click on terms. Uh, it takes on average 18 months to sign a trade deal and 45 months to implement. All they need is a memorandum of understanding to be published and the market can get on with getting on and and a pause of punitive actions until the deal is signed. That's really all we want is extend and pretend. Good times to invest. AI sentiment survey three-month rolling average bull bear spread with subsequent S&P total return. when it got down this low. 2020 next three months was up 15% up 33% up 26% up 56%. The one time it didn't work was the great financial crisis down 41% uh 2000 then going back to early 2000s up 29% up 22% up 15 up 25. So that is where you want to be a buyer, not a seller, which is what we were pounding the table on in early April when it wasn't easy to pound the table because it complete uncertainty. But that's always the case when the market's down 19%. Obviously, obviously there's some uncertainty. Hello. Uh and I think like I said last week, we could see numbers get worse while the market gets better because it's going to start to price in. Uh earnings have come down, estimates have come down 3.6% 6% from 275 to 265 for this year, but next year is still 302. So you're trading at 185.5 times. Next year's earnings average for the last 10 years is 18.3. You take out the MAG 7, you're probably at 16. So there's things to do. There's things to do. Uh 10 largest companies as a share of the uh S&P 500 total. 10 largest companies are still 36% down from close to 40% but uh earnings is only 29% share. So we'll see if that converges a little bit. Cost of shipping containers dropping on a major US China route but increasing via Vietnam. Percent of stocks above the 200 day moving average. It got down to this low level of 15 which was the COVID lows the first trade war lows and now it's bouncing off of that. Uh so that's a positive sign. Small cap short interest record high last time this high. Um hasn't been this high in years. So that's when you want to be a buyer because anything positive changes. You get a rip your rip your face off rally. Uh forward PE trough around bare market lows. So tech is still elevated. Industrials they feel is elevated. Telecom how how far is this going back though? This to 1974. All right. Consumer staples looks in line. Healthc care looks cheap, which I covered on CNA. Real estates look cheap according to this financials and energy. Yeah, there's got to be something to do in energy more than comtock. We got to keep looking. Um they'll get cheaper. I've continued to show discipline and patience and I'm going to continue to do that, but we're keeping our eyes aggressively open. daily true range, Trump tariffs, COVID crash, great financial crisis, tech bubble, October 1987 crash. So, we kind of got a craziness in early April and after that, I mean, if you buy those things, that's where you can just crush it. And we we put a insane amount of money to work in April and super excited about that. How that looks six and 12 months out is going to be astounding. Um IWM retesting the lows what is this? Oh ID I IWM small caps to IWM to S spy hasn't been this low since 2001 these years 2001 to 2007 massive outperformance of small caps. So uh relative to S&P I think we're on the cusp of that again. It's taken a little longer than expected but here we go. Retail flows at percent of buy minus sell. you retails have been buying and uh professionals have been selling at the wrong time every single year since co business confidence composite index [Music] uh it's interesting so confidence is down again this is that soft versus hard data uh emotions are down but actions are up and actions are the name of the game now actions can follow emotion if it stays for a prolonged period which is why I've said they got to get something going now. But um that's that imports. Here's the imports. This is what blew out. What an aberration. Imports versus exports. This is what destroyed the GDP number. X this front loading. You would have had plus 3% GDP growth. But that's good. It put the administration on alert. Get it get it going here because you don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. you'll have a recession like Biden did in had a technical recession in 2022. Consumer confidence again COVID lows 2022 lows um and their retail spending is up so you can't make it up. Uh US small capitalization total return index is a percentage above its 1945 trend line average. So you get a few of these opportunities in a in a career. Um Kenneth French small cap US sector index total returns i.e. lowest 30% markets capitalization stocks average annualized small cap sector total return was 12.06. So you've had this zerp environment since 2009 uh where small caps have underperformed for a long period of time but that never holds ladies and gentlemen. I mean look you you saw the similar thing in the early 70s you saw it get pronounced in the early 2000s you saw it in the 50s and it's always followed by monstrous outperformance and um so that's what we do. We find dislocation, we bet sizably, and then we do it without margin or with very little margin and we wait and uh and over time some IRRs are off the charts, some take a little longer. It's lower IRS, but a blend over 10 12 positions uh and some extra juice on the derivative overlays and hedging and you're off to the races. So, uh recession this year, this has gone up to 72% chance. Um that's from Cali. So that's where sentiment is right now. Real consumer spending quarteron quarter is up 1.4% and that's similar to first quarter of last year. Uh it's actually more than that. It's like 1.7% if you look at this chart. W\n\nactions can follow emotion if it stays for a prolonged period which is why I've said they got to get something going now. But um that's that imports. Here's the imports. This is what blew out. What an aberration. Imports versus exports. This is what destroyed the GDP number. X this front loading. You would have had plus 3% GDP growth. But that's good. It put the administration on alert. Get it get it going here because you don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. you'll have a recession like Biden did in had a technical recession in 2022. Consumer confidence again COVID lows 2022 lows um and their retail spending is up so you can't make it up. Uh US small capitalization total return index is a percentage above its 1945 trend line average. So you get a few of these opportunities in a in a career. Um Kenneth French small cap US sector index total returns i.e. lowest 30% markets capitalization stocks average annualized small cap sector total return was 12.06. So you've had this zerp environment since 2009 uh where small caps have underperformed for a long period of time but that never holds ladies and gentlemen. I mean look you you saw the similar thing in the early 70s you saw it get pronounced in the early 2000s you saw it in the 50s and it's always followed by monstrous outperformance and um so that's what we do. We find dislocation, we bet sizably, and then we do it without margin or with very little margin and we wait and uh and over time some IRRs are off the charts, some take a little longer. It's lower IRS, but a blend over 10 12 positions uh and some extra juice on the derivative overlays and hedging and you're off to the races. So, uh recession this year, this has gone up to 72% chance. Um that's from Cali. So that's where sentiment is right now. Real consumer spending quarteron quarter is up 1.4% and that's similar to first quarter of last year. Uh it's actually more than that. It's like 1.7% if you look at this chart. W\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nIs it normal for Q1 to see weak GDP then rebound? Yes, that's actually the seasonal pattern. Another clue. The worst is over. Performance after 6 day win streaks greater than 7%. Uh 12 months out, you're up on average 19.6%. That's again from Carson. uh percent expecting stocks to go down over the next 12 months. We're at 48.5%. Uh last time we saw this many people, this is more than even COVID. Uh was in the great financial crisis lows you saw 55% and uh in the tech wreck lows you got to like 47% and that was the lows in like 2002 2003 period. Russell 2000 ETF short interest again at record highs here and scoop and score 52- week high in short interest. This this is going to be a rip your face off once we get good news across the tape. Maybe we should call it sell in June. Uh return index during May on average in the last up nine out of the last 10 years in May. S&P firms with higher less lower 12-month EPS revisions as a short of total revisions. Uh when did it get this low? In 2022 and then at the lows in 2019.\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAlibaba launches new Quen LLMs in China's latest open source AI breakthrough.

    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nthe Treasury was out this morning talking about an uh enhancements to their buyback program, which is uh uh pretty important because they want to bring down long-term borrowing rates. It's just a kind of fancy way of saying they're going to be in the market potentially buying more bonds, and we know what that looks like historically. So those three things point to yes, they're making these bold moves that are kind of disruptive and causing volatility, but they're paying attention and they don't want it to fall over the cliff. And it's earning season now. Before we get into the specific results, though, give us an overview for 2025. Thomas, yeah, look, I I think that uh the bad news is estimates have been coming down, okay, down 3.6% year to date on the S&P 500. Uh that means from $275 to $265. That's, you know, 20 times 2025 estimates is pretty rich. However, uh like all good estimates, they're backend loaded. 2026 estimates have been holding up at $32, which means right now we're at, you know, 18.5 times next year's earnings. The 10-year average is 18.3 times. We've had 36% of the companies report maybe a little more now uh this week over 10% earnings growth. So the world is not ending. I mean uh Lutnik Leutnik was out there yesterday saying I have a deal in my back pocket. It just has to be uh approved. Uh the administration continues to meet with uh uh CEOs like Walmart, Target, Home Depot. So they're getting the proper feedback and and the most important thing I think is that sentiment has been fully flushed out. Hedge funds and CTAs were record sellers on on April 8th in the hole at the worst possible time. So they are going to be forced buyers as we get any semblance of good news with deal flow and if Lutnik is correct and we get an announcement uh you're going to get a lot of people forced to buy. Uh Thomas, now let's talk about matter and Microsoft. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\n results did not disappoint earlier on as well. Uh we heard from Sarah uh sharing with us uh Microsoft beat on both the top and bottom lines with its zero cloud business uh exceeded analysts estimates. Meta reporting uh rising revenue and profit helped by Instagram and Facebook ads. Were you expecting these results as well for these two companies? Well, look, we we really didn't know what to expect because you know going in guidance was pretty nice. I mean, you know, people were expecting earning uh revenues up 8%. They came in up 13% on Microsoft. They were expecting earnings up uh 10%. It came in at 18%. Uh people were a little worried about capex. That was up 53% year-on-year. There were all those rumors that they were, you know, cancelling leases and all that stuff. Well, it wasn't reflected in the numbers. and Azure the cloud was up 33% and they increased the guidance to 34 to 35% uh next quarter and they raised revenue guidance 1.25 25 billion. So, uh, in the kingdom of Microsoft, uh, pe people are still smiling. But it's not so great news for Qualcomm, isn't it? Because their revenue forecast missed estimates. Thomas, what happened there? Well, look, it always looks darkest before dawn. I mean, semiconductors, what people forgot is a very cyclical business. We're probably at or near some of the the the troughs in the uh semiconductor cycle. I think there's going to be opportunity, but it's going to take a few quarters. Uh we were at peak exuberance just a short while ago. Uh so it's uh it's a stock pickers market and I know that sounds cliche, but it it really is. I mean, you look at Meta uh also crushed it. They didn't have as aggressive uh guidance. Their their revenue guidance is in line with what we had been expecting, but they took capex up 8 billion and people were worried about capex. Ad revenues up 41.3 billion. uh were were 41.3 versus 40.4. That kind of tells us that the consumer is okay. People were worried about that. Daily active users 3.43 billion versus 3.39. So, you know, the rumors of the economic demise have been greatly exaggerated. I think we're we're chugging along. If the administration continues to show rationality and gets some reasonable deals and gets the rebalancing that they're looking for, uh I think there's a lot of pent up strength. Uh the risk is if they drag it out too long, people will lose the hope and once the confidence is gone, it's it's very hard to get back. And that would be a shame because all the money that they want to save on Doge and uh and uh sensible government spending, if you wind up in a recession, it's going to cost you a lot more to get it get you out of a recession with stimulus, etc., and the the declining uh tax revenues. So, they're threading a needle here. I think they're gonna be able to do it, but uh certainly pushing it up to the edge. Similar expectations you think for Apple and Amazon because they are expected to release uh their earnings uh report tomorrow after the closing bell. Yeah, look, I think rearview mirror, I think they're going to have great earnings and great revenues. The the question is going to be uh you know, a huge question for Apple as it relates to how they're thinking about China, both production and consumption. uh as it relates to Amazon, you've got a lot of Chinese sellers on the Amazon website. Uh so people are going to want to get some color around that. Meta alluded to that uh in their kind of talking about you know 10% of their ad revenues come from Chinese sellers. So we want to know we want to understand that from Amazon but Amazon is uh is a beast. I mean if you get an opportunity to buy it lower you take advantage of it. if you if you don't uh that's just the kind of business it is when the when the uh e-commerce side is a little slow, their cloud tends to do really well. Uh and they've got a phenomenal business. So we, you know, we'll we'll see. Are we going to get beats across the board? Microsoft Meta, uh Amazon, Amazon, Apple, we hope the market could use that. It looks, you know, a lot of these look pretty oversold. uh we just want to understand the guidance and looking at some of the capex uh guidance from Microsoft and from Meta holding in and raising capex it kind of points to positive things happening. I think probably the the one that is is um going to have people on edge is going to be Apple. We want to get some comfort around Apple uh with um you know things changing the environment changing a little bit for them particularly in China. Thomas, let's look ahead. I have you gaze into your crystal ball for a bit. I want to talk to you about your outlook on US earnings for 2026 and which sectors might be your most favored. Well, I think that, you know, as we get closer to 2026, you're going to start to see which sectors um are are looking like they're going to have growth. I would say there are a couple things that I'm paying attention to. Number one is uh materials have been beaten down. I think they're going to get a rebound once we get through all this tariff stuff. Okay. So, it's a little early for that. But I also like healthcare. Healthcare's got earnings growth. It's it it has the benefits of being defensive. It has the benefits that it's sold off enough. Particularly biotech. We've had a new FDA commissioner uh appointed Dr. Macker from John's Hopkins. He wants to focus on innovation uh and streamline streamlining regulation. So a userfriendly review process in English all that means is we're going to get more drugs and we're going to get more deal approval a favorable FTC and you know uh the pharma companies large pharma in the United States they have record cash on their balance sheets. The problem is they have no innovation and they've got a lot of patent cliffs. So rather than build it and take many years, they can just buy it uh because most of these biotech companies are trading at uh you know decade low valuations and uh and that's what what we're going to be seeing. So when you see a lot of deals and you see a lot of drug approvals, you see a lot of growth and you see a lot of money start to chase it. So, I think the surprise of the next 12 to 24 months is biotech's going to do exceptionally well. And I think some of the medical device companies once they get a sense of the landscape, they're defensive, but they've really been left for dead. They're highquality businesses. I think you're going to start to see spending ramp up. Um, you know, one in particular we like is Baxter because they've been able to delever their balance sheet. They sold their slowing grow slow growing kidney business uh for 3.8 billion to Carlilele. they'll pay down some debt and their multiple is probably going to rerate back to more normalized levels from 11 times back to 15 times uh as they focus on the IV business, the nutrition business, uh medical devices and and their pharma. So, uh the next catalyst for that company uh uh will be a new CEO announcement uh and uh you've got time to to own it. They're going to report earnings. I don't know what earnings will be tomorrow, but if you get weakness, it's probably a time to get involved. Uh, in our opinion, not advice. Thomas, we will be monitoring the developments very closely here as well on CN 938. And we, it's been a fun chat this morning. We hope to have you back. And when we do, uh, we look forward to more of your insights and perspectives. My pleasure. Thanks so much for having me. And that was Thomas Hayes, chairman and managing member at Grid Hill Capital. ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nThere are no bad days in the market. When the market is down, you've got bargains. And it's a lovely to think about what you're buying at low prices. When the market's up, the bargains have gone, but you're rich. That's Bruce Greenwald. Uh he was a professor at Colombia Business School. Here's uh Seth Clarman. There's no such thing as a value company. Price is all that matters. At some price, an asset is a buy. At another, it's a hold. And at another, it's a sell. That's why we never enter an investment without knowing where we're getting out. Warren Buffett, investment students need only two well-taught courses. Number one, how to value a business. And number two, how to think about market prices. Treat the fluctuations as your friend, not as your enemy. ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nNow, on to data. Retail is only emotionally very downbeat on stocks. Allocations have barely dropped. Sentiment has been crushed but allocations are still up. Very similar to kind of what you saw uh since co professionals have been selling in the whole retail have been holding tight and doing very well. This is the Ryex bull bear ratio. You can see it's completely off the charts um bearish. Okay. And that's usually what you see at these bounces. that's across the board institutional. Um, and this is off the charts. So that that you know the thing the the number one thing you need to know about our situation is that institutions and hedge funds and CTAs record sold in the hole at the lows on April 9th or April 8th I think it was. Uh where are my notes? Anyway, the point is they record sold at the exact wrong time and what they are praying for is a retest of the lows, okay? Because they missed this move that retraced half the losses. Um, and usually praying doesn't work in investing. Uh, it frequently never works. So, if we start to see the deal that Lutnik referenced and we continue to see the type of flexibility we've seen on auto tariffs, on the 90-day pause, on other things, uh these guys are going to be forced buyers, okay, into any positive tape bomb like we saw good earnings after the bell, uh which we discussed on the radio show and more durable goods, new orders, non-defense aircraft and parts. through the roof. You know, we got a negative GDP print of.3. You take out the inventory loading because why? It's C plus I plus G plus X, consumption, investment, government spending, which was down, and uh net exports, which everyone was importing ahead of the tariffs. Um, and you would wind up with plus 3% GDP instead of negative.3. That said, you still have a negative GDP growth. So, the administration has to beware not to get two consecutive ne negative quarters, meaning tidy up and get some deals announced. So, you get these forced buyers. Consumer confidence comes back. Earnings keeps going. Earnings are up 10% year-on-year, but that's backward looking. Guidance has been okay, but a little bit dicey depending on the company. ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nUm, now here's a chart that's really interesting. Since Deep Seek's arrival, MAG7 stocks have been declining uh you can see here on balance uh a lot more than the S&P 500 which is down you know 78 and MAG 7 is still down looks like 1718 as of a few days ago. Hammock says June rate move in play if data is clear. big importance on the jobs report if that confirms the ADP and the labor market is softening. Uh the May meeting is going to be interesting but the June meeting could be active. Uh, and that's a key thing I want to emphasize also. Uh, let's just see here. I posted on Twitter. Um, the Fed, the Treasury is looking [Music] to increase the enhance the Treasury buyback program, which is effectively a cute way of saying a new form of quantitative easing without calling it quantitative easing, which we had been talking about get ready for. You can see uh w\n\nthat 10-year yield is going to keep coming down. That's going to be a boon for housing, GenerRack, Stanley Black & Decker, uh, QXO, and more. Uh, Treasuring is Treasury is evaluating potential enhancements to its buyback program to better achieve liquidity, support cash management goals, uh, improves its efficacy, changes to maximum purchase amounts, wink wink. Uh, so quantitative tightening will be a rear view mirror either in uh, May or June. And this treasury buyback program aka different method same outcome QE type of program will be in place and they will hit that plus the bank deregulation taking the charges from holding the treasuries will you get 30 business points there you probably get another 30 to 40 here you could see 375 then you got a five and change 30-year fix and then we're just completely off to the faces with all the millennials that are overdue uh in demand for houses. US dollar depreciation, emerging markets outperforms developed markets. I think as I said, you know, there were the covers of the dollar weakness, dollar demise. I think we're ready for a dollar bounce. Uh it will be a counter trend bounce, but um just just be ready for that. Estimated foreign ownership of US treasuries as a share of publicly held debt going down. biggest four-week inflow into Treasury since March of 2023. That was the mini banking crisis, by the way. Short Wall Street, long Main Street, very similar. So, Ferrari is collapsing. Dollar General is appreciating. We like that story. Asset bubbles of the last 50 years. So, you can see ARC and Bitcoin in 2021. MAG7, biotech, China, housing, internet, Asia, Japan, gold. that just rinse and repeat. We estimate moderate selling of US equities by foreign investors across March and April. That's from Goldman Sachs. Another rare bullish breath thrust from Brian Dietrich over at Carson. 12 months later, uh average return 18.9%, median is 17.9. That's off the lows. So, it's also in line with what we've been saying since the end of last year, beginning of this year, which is when all is said and done, uh, uh, high single digits to low double digits on the S&P for the year. Extremely strong breath the last three days. 12 months out, you see the results in bigger terms. Um, same thing here. S&P performance after three consecutive days gains of 1.5% 1950 through current 12 months out you're up 20%. Uh ran very bullish breath thrust just uh triggered zag breath thrust signals since World War II. We had one actually recently in 2023 12 months later up 32% on average up 23%. So, those of you who took me up on my urging to add more money and or get started with us uh in late March, early April, midappril uh smart move. You're going to look back 12 months from now and really pat yourself on the back and the existing clients because we got the benefit of international in the first quarter and um and everything in place moving through the end of the year. So very excited all around. Uh here's the dollar end of the dollar. Um all bearish on Trump. This, by the way, this could, you know, you're kind of peak pessimism on Trump. If you look at the polls, sure it could get worse before it gets better, but my guess is you get a deal signed and this guy's going to if he pulls it off. I mean, I I didn't like Letic getting on TV and saying, \"Well, you know, it's not my fault. It's it's Besson's fault with China, blah, blah, blah.\" or Besson's in charge of China, yada yada yada. Uh, I'm in charge of the rest of the world. Uh, anyway, the point is you get that first India deal or the first Japan deal, serious country across the tape and man, all those guys that sold in the whole desperate for a retest or a marginal new low are going to be panic buying because they've already had to cover up and get their face ripped off on the short rally. Uh they should have listened when Trump said today's the day to buy. That was the bottom. And then today he said be patient. America is gonna boom. Uh he's probably not putting that out there if he doesn't have something in his hand. Dollar comes under pressure when US PMIs underperform which could imply PMIs could start to turn. Let's see. Index of consumer sentiment by political party. Democrats couldn't be more pessimistic right now. Republicans couldn't be more optimistic. Kind of the same thing when Biden was in. So although um kind of everyone was pessimistic when Biden leaving that aside, uh it's typical people unfortunately make investment decisions based on their politics and it often proves to be very very detrimental in the long term. uh the mark stock market did very well under Biden and if you're a Republican and you missed that, shame on you and uh we'll probably do the economy will probably do very well under Trump and you know getting through these next few months. Uh and it, you know, if you're uh pessimistic because you don't like the personality, I think you're going to miss out. Uh fewer Europeans traveling to the US. Okay, the Euro is going to appreciate. they'll be here uh and continue to appreciate. S&P realized average stock correlation has moved up this year. That usually happens in draw downs. This will start to come down as we uh get some deals across the tape. Jet Goldman Sachs optimism tracker hasn't been this low since the 2022 lows and then the COVID lows and then the great financial crisis lows. Wall Street forecasts take a massive hit amid tariff turmoil. So, they're take they're all taking their price targets down at the exact wrong time. Typical car dealership guy. Consumers are about to drop 55.8 billion on new cars in April. That's a 21.2% year-over-year increase and third highest month on record. The reasons are a few. Retail new vehicle sales are expected to reach just under 1.3 million, a 14.7% increase year-on-year. Uh 139,000 of those were accelerated vehicle purchases. Average new car transaction price is expected to reach $45,000. Uh up $887 yearon year and 975 month. But with many buyers having pulled forward their purchases and affordability still tight, the momentum bait may be hard to sustain into summer. Yeah. Except that now they've got to replenish the inventory. So we're worried about production from a Cooper Standard standpoint. Not as much retail. We definitely want to see the sell through. But it's like gener when when your neighbor gets a new car, you get a new car. When your neighbor gets a generator, you get a new generator. This game has been delayed for 13.5 years. It's on now. And if Bessant does what he says he's going to do with the 10-year Treasury, uh financing, all that. It'll be party like, you know, plus all the untapped home equity that'll get ticked if we get uh HELOCs at 5% again. The game will be on like nobody's business. Share of national housing inventory for sale with a price cut in March is going up. Affordability is coming uh becoming better. Weekly announced buyback starting to go back up. They the the companies are buying in the hole which is good to see. We've seen it across our portfolio. Percent of Humish respondents making unsolicited positive or negative comments on government economic policy uh through the roof. There you go. UK retail sales moving up. largest monthly net injection. Uh this is Chinese stimulus through the roof PBOC net injection 1 trillion yuan. Okay. Little reward on the beats. Misses punished more than usual. A lot of skepticism. That makes sense. average pair-wise correlation between TLT, SPY, DXY, which is the dollar for one month. Um, you haven't seen this since 2020 and that was when you wanted to be a buyer. US stocks off to worst start against global peers in more than 30 years. You were positioned to this if you listen to the podcast in late 2024. We kept pounding the table. International, international, international has outperformed by some 15%. Uh boomers made up almost half of US home buyers in 2024. The millennials is where we're going to see this thing boom as we get the supply as the federal lands open, as rates come down. Median two-week S&P return since 1950. Okay, they're showing first half of May is a little bit weak. I I wouldn't that's not been the case the last four or five years. I saw some stats going out that that May 1st to the 30th has actually been up. And in years where you have uh weakness in the first half, which is atypical outside of February, uh you tend to have stronger summers. So just be open-minded to that. Scott Brown, let's see. After being down more than 13, S&P is now down just yeah, 13% year to date, but it was down 19% peak to trough. Um prior record saw the index down 9in. Okay, so big reversal there. Dogee candlestick or whatever you want to call it. Uh magnificent 7 versus US dollar index as the dollar's dropped. Uh interesting correlation since 2024. So if you see a bounce in the dollar and then now you've got MAG 7 bouncing with earnings that that could be positive all around. EPS beat rate improved sequentially. Uh, I think it's 73% so far versus 67 average. Central banks are a potent force in gold buying. They always buy the top, ladies and gentlemen. You do not want to be buying gold here in my humble opinion. It's not what I do, but just Spidey sense. Take it for what it's worth. All this is opinion, not advice. Anyway, go to hedge funips.com, click on terms. Uh, it takes on average 18 months to sign a trade deal and 45 months to implement. All they need is a memorandum of understanding to be published and the market can get on with getting on and and a pause of punitive actions until the deal is signed. That's really all we want is extend and pretend. Good times to invest. AI sentiment survey three-month rolling average bull bear spread with subsequent S&P total return. when it got down this low. 2020 next three months was up 15% up 33% up 26% up 56%. The one time it didn't work was the great financial crisis down 41% uh 2000 then going back to early 2000s up 29% up 22% up 15 up 25. So that is where you want to be a buyer, not a seller, which is what we were pounding the table on in early April when it wasn't easy to pound the table because it complete uncertainty. But that's always the case when the market's down 19%. Obviously, obviously there's some uncertainty. Hello. Uh and I think like I said last week, we could see numbers get worse while the market gets better because it's going to start to price in. Uh earnings have come down, estimates have come down 3.6% 6% from 275 to 265 for this year, but next year is still 302. So you're trading at 185.5 times. Next year's earnings average for the last 10 years is 18.3. You take out the MAG 7, you're probably at 16. So there's things to do. There's things to do. Uh 10 largest companies as a share of the uh S&P 500 total. 10 largest companies are still 36% down from close to 40% but uh earnings is only 29% share. So we'll see if that converges a little bit. Cost of shipping containers dropping on a major US China route but increasing via Vietnam. Percent of stocks above the 200 day moving average. It got down to this low level of 15 which was the COVID lows the first trade war lows and now it's bouncing off of that. Uh so that's a positive sign. Small cap short interest record high last time this high. Um hasn't been this high in years. So that's when you want to be a buyer because anything positive changes. You get a rip your rip your face off rally. Uh forward PE trough around bare market lows. So tech is still elevated. Industrials they feel is elevated. Telecom how how far is this going back though? This to 1974. All right. Consumer staples looks in line. Healthc care looks cheap, which I covered on CNA. Real estates look cheap according to this financials and energy. Yeah, there's got to be something to do in energy more than comtock. We got to keep looking. Um they'll get cheaper. I've continued to show discipline and patience and I'm going to continue to do that, but we're keeping our eyes aggressively open. daily true range, Trump tariffs, COVID crash, great financial crisis, tech bubble, October 1987 crash. So, we kind of got a craziness in early April and after that, I mean, if you buy those things, that's where you can just crush it. And we we put a insane amount of money to work in April and super excited about that. How that looks six and 12 months out is going to be astounding. Um IWM retesting the lows what is this? Oh ID I IWM small caps to IWM to S spy hasn't been this low since 2001 these years 2001 to 2007 massive outperformance of small caps. So uh relative to S&P I think we're on the cusp of that again. It's taken a little longer than expected but here we go. Retail flows at percent of buy minus sell. you retails have been buying and uh professionals have been selling at the wrong time every single year since co business confidence composite index [Music] uh it's interesting so confidence is down again this is that soft versus hard data uh emotions are down but actions are up and actions are the name of the game now actions can follow emotion if it stays for a prolonged period which is why I've said they got to get something going now. But um that's that imports. Here's the imports. This is what blew out. What an aberration. Imports versus exports. This is what destroyed the GDP number. X this front loading. You would have had plus 3% GDP growth. But that's good. It put the administration on alert. Get it get it going here because you don't want two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. you'll have a recession like Biden did in had a technical recession in 2022. Consumer confidence again COVID lows 2022 lows um and their retail spending is up so you can't make it up. Uh US small capitalization total return index is a percentage above its 1945 trend line average. So you get a few of these opportunities in a in a career. Um Kenneth French small cap US sector index total returns i.e. lowest 30% markets capitalization stocks average annualized small cap sector total return was 12.06. So you've had this zerp environment since 2009 uh where small caps have underperformed for a long period of time but that never holds ladies and gentlemen. I mean look you you saw the similar thing in the early 70s you saw it get pronounced in the early 2000s you saw it in the 50s and it's always followed by monstrous outperformance and um so that's what we do. We find dislocation, we bet sizably, and then we do it without margin or with very little margin and we wait and uh and over time some IRRs are off the charts, some take a little longer. It's lower IRS, but a blend over 10 12 positions uh and some extra juice on the derivative overlays and hedging and you're off to the races. So, uh recession this year, this has gone up to 72% chance. Um that's from Cali. So that's where sentiment is right now. Real consumer spending quarteron quarter is up 1.4% and that's similar to first quarter of last year. Uh it's actually more than that. It's like 1.7% if you look at this chart. W",

Um for those of you who don't stick around for the\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nFirst question from Eric F. Dear Mr. Hayes, congratulations on all your effort to move Baba US listed shares to Hong Kong. You spent a lot of time discussing the possibility Baba being delisted due to actions in the US government and regulations. No, I Well, look, my conclusion is I think it's less than a coin flip odds, but if I can do something that has little friction to protect my investors capital and my own, which I invest alongside, I'm going to take that action even if it proves to be unnecessary. um we still have exposure to the US because we can't replicate our derivative overlay in Hong Kong and we're going to take that full risk in the US but for the bulk of the money devoted to the idea in common stock uh we're moving it to Hong Kong to be proactive. Uh what about the other side of the coin for those holding US shares? Do you have any concerns about the VIE structure of US listed shares? Uh how about the actions of the Chinese government to screw US shareholders or the lack of recourse US shareholders have regarding issues of corporate government by management of the VIE structure? Thanks again. Uh look, that's possible, but that's the nuclear option. So if it gets to that point, you know, if if the Chinese government destroys foreign investment in Chinese entities, they're over. That's I mean that's just mutually assured destruction. Um so I would say the odds of the Chinese screwing themselves are lower than the odds of the US screwing themselves by delisting in the US. Uh they're both below coin flip odds. I would say there's a 35 h I wouldn't even say that. I'd say there's probably a 20% chance that the US screws themselves and maybe a 3% chance that the Chinese screw themselves. But nothing is without risk. You get in your car tomorrow morning, there's risk. That's just the way life works. \nJay Manning, uh do you have any interest in us United Health at these levels? Um maybe. Let's see. Man, they took a cash flow hit and the price held up. Cash flow is starting to recover. What's happening? Margins are still down. I don't like it yet. I don't think it's come down enough to be interesting. You're probably okay, but you know, for me to even allocate a penny of capital, I need to see at least a potential double, and I don't see it in this in in a reasonable amount of time. So, for that reason, I think there's a good probability you'll make, you know, 40 50%, but I I don't I don't think about it. \nSimon Stazzy Ununice, thoughts on BP. I don't think it's come down enough, partner. prices come down with free cash flow and revenues. Uh, I'm going to pass. They made a lot of strategic errors. They tried to go green. They were, you know, blew with the wind when the, you know, and uh trying to do wind farms and all kinds of and they're paying for it. I I would pass on that. I think there's a lot of brain damage in management over there. Hey Tom, hope you're doing great. At which point would you consider opening a position in Alpha? I mean that's like a cigarette company trying to sell vitamins. I mean you can't make this up. Anyway, um hope you're doing great. At which point would you consider but Alphabet I continue to look at Alphabet. The problem is I don't use it anymore. I use Grock. So um that worries me. But they've got Whimo. They've got an incredible cloud business. It's got like in two 2022 it was easy. I mean, all this Grock stuff wasn't even around. It was like a no-brainer and it was an easy double. I don't know that it's an easy double. I think it's a possible, if not I I don't have the level of confidence. So, it it it's not like it's probably going to go up 50% and without me, it's just not such an easy double or triple that I want to put any money to work. It's a trade and you're probably gonna make 20 30% in the next few months, but um I'll let you do that without me. Great podcast. Uh this is from John H. Truly nothing short of life-changing for me and my colleagues. I spend about two hours a day in the car and your podcast is by far the most informative and entertaining I've ever found. Recent listener, roughly six months, and I'm still getting a grasp on turnaround, Tom, business valuation models. Um, my wife and I recently inherited some shares of Atlantic Union Bank Shares, AUB. By the way, thank you for the kind words, John. Okay, Atlantic Union Bank shares as they bought out our old bank, N American National Bank. From what I see, it has decent margin of safety, book value above trading price, enough cash to basically 13 time multiple revenues growing. Let me just see something. Yeah, I think you got a solid bank. If your question is, would I buy it here? H probably goes a little bit lower, but would I sell it here? The answer is no. I think you're I think you're fine. I think you have a pretty without knowing any. Let me just see where it's located. Glenn out, Virginia. I I think this one's okay, my friend. Thanks for being a super fan and welcome uh to to the podcast. Uh, he's asking about [Music] JD. I I don't like it as much. I I don't have to own all of them. I think it'll probably do okay, but again, I'd want to own it in Hong Kong. Um, the the the problem with these is they don't have the outs. The reason we got involved with Baba is because it had the cloud, had the AI, had the e-commerce, had the international, had the cash, had all these free options investments, and JD is basically a retailer. And that's a tough business to be your exclusive business, especially when you don't have the largest share. So, for that reason, I just don't like it as much. But, it will go up with all of China stocks. I just um it's not for me. Zim, we've covered a million times. Uh, these chippers are like the quickest way to lose money. And uh, has this come down enough yet? No, I'm a pass. It's not for me. We've covered that a million times. We had a lot of people coming to it us with this uh, when it was right up here. They were all excited about it up here. No one down here. No one down here. Always up. York bourgeoa. Big fan of the podcast. Thanks for consistently posting quality every day and every week. It cuts through the silly noise from everywhere else. Uh, thank you. That's very kind. I understand much of this comes to [Music] your Yeah. I mean, York, it's it's a So, first off, if you want to go into the business and you're new, you're in college, get your CFA, learn the language of the business, and that'll give you the basics. And you got to learn the basics of valuation before you can get into the advance. The advance comes from observing thousands of patterns and reading thousands and thousands and thousands of books and reports and everything over the years. and you get this mosaic in your mind that can only be replicated with time and reading because you love what you do and you want to do it 24/7. Um, and then the patterns will start to emerge like anything else. It's like uh in sports, you know, it's first it's conscious incompetence. You know that you suck. Then it's uh conscious competence where you kind of have to think about doing well and then it's unconscious competence where it comes naturally and that's the same with investing. Um it's just reading the books, reading the annual reports, zone zoning in but you got to get the basics. So like it's like what's your edge? your edge will be different than my edge because you'll discover it on your own after years and years of experience. And um and once you have that, you could actually teach your whole edge to someone else and they just wouldn't be able to do it because they don't have the context of all the years of experience and patterns and reading and learning and seeing things over and over and repeat and different managers and seeing how they operated in different cycles. It's just so get your basics, get your language and then get your time in the business. And you know, I always tell people before you do any of that, if you're getting into this business because you think it's just a way to make money, there's so many great ways to make money as an entrepreneur. If you don't love this, you'll get your face ripped off because you're competing against the smartest people in the world every single day. And um a lot of success comes from staying power and risk management and then you gain that expertise over time. So, um, yeah, start with intelligent investor. Either the light bulb goes off or it doesn't after reading that book. If it goes off, read all the CFA uh levels and and get that done. And then from there, it's just time in. And after 10 years, you'll have some level of competence. After 20, if you've made it through that, you're probably going to be pretty damn good and pretty darn wealthy. \nJames Renan just discovered INTW, which does Intel two times leverage. Don't do it. Um, next question. Martin Grizzki wants to talk about Target, which we've covered a bunch of times. I think Target's okay. If you got to buy a retailer, it's now. If you buy it at 96 and it goes to 75, it's not the end of the world. I think it's best in class for that space. Um, and I think you'll be okay with that one. I mean, it's not something that I would like pound the table on, but I think you're okay a little lower than here. And then final from Ishmamail Faras, thanks for great podcast sharing your knowledge, latest information. My question is, what will you be announcing when you've sold some or all your holdings in a particular company? If yes, how long after it's done? Number one, I have no obligation to tell you what companies we own and don't own. And number two, I have no obligation to tell you when we're in or out. Uh what has been the case historically is every single company I have told when I got out of um after we were out of the full position and um you know whether it was uh I mean there's just been so many but Rolls-Royce was a multibagger for Amazon, Google um the banks off the banking crisis lows off the COVID lows um uh Exxon. I mean, every single one that we've gone through when we've got out, we've let everyone know that we've gotten out and um and we don't foresee any difference in that. Um and we'll just you know, usually tell you when we're fully out, uh you know, the next week or the following week. So, if you miss a podcast, you probably miss a lot of those. There's nothing, you know, we're not going to make 10,000 individual phone calls for people who are not clients. So, our obligation is to our clients. This is for education andformational purposes, but we do try to update you uh when we've taken profits on a position at fully valued uh and go from there.

We're buying handover fist and we wait for the recovery aka turnaround Tom. Maybe we'll have to put those uh uh slogans on the next batch of mer in the merch store. Uh which would be a lot of fun. You can see the share count coming down from 1.2 2 billion down to 970 million continuing to go down. Um so let's go through some of the commentary. PayPal delivered yet another strong quarter earlier this week. Non-GAAP ET EPS of 133 came in well ahead of 116 consensus while revenue of 7.8 billion was a slight $40 million miss. Again for those calling out the slow growth, this is a deliberate shift in strategy. Since stepping in, Alex Chris has made it a clear priority to move away from growth at all costs and cut empty calorie revenues that were popular under prior leadership. The focus now is on PayPal's most important metric, transaction margin. Shifting away from unprofitable volume is expected to create a 5 to 6% headwind to topline revenue this year. Most of that impact will be lapped in the back half of the year and things should start to reacelerate from there. You can see this shift reflected in uh brain tree growth which has slowed from 24% in Q1 2024 to just 2% this quarter. If you're holding your if your holding period stretches beyond the next quarter or two, this is a welcome change. Not to mention transaction margins are now shifting sitting at a 2year high. Okay, this is the name of the game. If you if we had to sum up this quarter in one line, it would be quote just getting started. In fact, Alex, Chris, and Co used that phrase along with early days a total of five times during the earnings call, and that makes sense. 2024 was always seen as a transition year, while 2025 is all about scaling product adoption, and ramping up new initiatives. This quarter that was on full display. Whether it's leaning into buy now, pay later, launching the ads business, scaling Fast Lane, rolling out the PayPal Everywhere campaign, or",
      "In our latest article, last article on PayPal, we hi highlighted how 2024 results came in well above initial guidance. We also laid out the potential upside if PayPal delivers similar surprises in 2025. The chart below speaks for itself. So they said 383, they came in 465, that was 21% upside on earnings. Free cash flow, they said 5 billion, they came in at 6.8, that's 36% upside. They said share repurchases at 5 billion. They came in at 6 billion, that was 20% upside. If they do those type of upside surprise percentages beyond what they are guiding, $5.3 for earnings, $6.5 billion of cash flow, and 6 billion a share repurchases, you wind up with greater than $6 of earnings, greater than $8.8 billion of free cash flow, and greater than $7.2 billion of share buybacks. Okay, here's another way to look at current management's guidance that makes the sandbagging hard to ignore. It's no surprise that PayPal has historically been back half weighted. Q3 gets a lift from back to school shopping and Q4 benefits from the holiday shopping season with Q2 EPS guided to 130. This implies first half EPS would total 263. Keep in mind management full year's guidance midpoint is 503. This suggests just 240 in EPS for the entire second half. This doesn't seem to add up. Looking at quarterly EPS chart above, you can see just how rare this would be if this actually played out. In seven of the last nine years, second half EPS was higher than first half, often doubledigit percentages. In six of those nine years, Q1 was the lowest quarter. Not to mention, Q4 has never been the lowest quarter for current guidance to hold. Payal's entire seasonal pattern would need to be flipped on its head. I.e., we'd have to put Christmas in January. We'd assign the odds of this happening as slim to none. Meanwhile, PayPal continues to roll out new growth drivers. NFC launches in Germany in Q2. PayPal Everyw",

      "here is  expanding in the UK in Q3. Fast Lane and the ads business continue to scale. And none of this is reflected in guidance. Ladies and gentlemen, this is sandbagging at its finest. As the saying goes, history doesn't repeat, but it often rhymes. Don't be shocked if we see similar upside surprises just like we did in 2024. Here's a detailed breakdown of everything you need to know following PayPal's first quarter. Fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with progress across branded checkout, PSP, Omni Channel, and Venmo. Uh transaction margin dollars increased 7%. Uh other key points returned $ 1.5 billion to stockholders by repurchasing approximately 19 million of shares in common stock in 1Q 2025. uh on a trailing 12-month basis, returned $6 billion to stockholders by repurchasing approximately 86 million shares of common stock. Total payment volume was up. So, you can look through this. You can look through the pitchbook. Um more emphasis on profit over growth. The uh cash free cash flow guidance is still between 6 to 7 which implies 8.8 if they have the same beat rate. the impact. So this quarter free cash flow includes negative impacts from the timing between originating European buy now pay later to receivables as HFS and the subsequent sale of these receivables, changes in the working capital and shifting portion a portion of annual incentive plan from stock to cash which is fantastic. They used to give out stock like candy. So here are the key points. One, PayPal saw their fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with transaction margin expanding over 270 basis points year-over-year to 47.7% a 2-year high. Declining transaction margin was always a part of the bare case on PayPal. Alex Chris and the team have flipped this on his head. Two, adjusted free cash flow came in a bit light at 1.4 billion, down from 1.86 prior year. While PayPal's free cash flow has always been a bit lumpy, a big driver, this was the shift away from stock-based compensation, which they used to give out like candy to cash as part of annual incentive plan. We love this. We want people to own stock, but not all the stock. This is a welcome change. Most importantly, management maintain the annual guidance range of 6 to7 billion of free cash flow, i.e. 8 plus. Uh share purchases total. We covered that 15 billion of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet, just 12.6 6 billion in debt along with what we believe is the opportunity to buy $1 bills for 50 cents. Repurchases should ramp up at these levels. Venmo's Verb buy now pay later later continues to stand out. And then the ad business with Mark Grether who ran the Uber and Amazon ad businesses active accounts all-time highs. PayPal Everywhere campaign featuring Will Frell launched in September. Since then, PayPal debit card has added 4 million new active accounts. Total payment volume from the debit card is up over 100% with strong economics both online and offline.

Whether it's leaning into buy now, pay later, launching the ads business, scaling Fast Lane, rolling out the PayPal Everywhere campaign, or finally  monetizing Venmo, the flywheel is clearly starting to spin. In Alex Chris's own words, PayPal is transforming from just a payments company into a commerce platform right in front of your eyes. Now, there's one thing that stood out to us. Guidance. Despite crushing EPS expectations this quarter and issuing a very strong Q2 guidance, PayPal chose in typical Sandbagger fashion to leave full year 2025 guidance unchanged. We understand the need to stay cautious given the macro uncertainty, but let's be clear, this is sandbagger city. In our latest article, last article on PayPal, we hi highlighted how 2024 results came in well above initial guidance. We also laid out the potential upside if PayPal delivers similar surprises in 2025. The chart below speaks for itself. So they said 383, they came in 465, that was 21% upside on earnings. Free cash flow, they said 5 billion, they came in at 6.8, that's 36% upside. They said share repurchases at 5 billion. They came in at 6 billion, that was 20% upside. If they do those type of upside surprise percentages beyond what they are guiding, $5.3 for earnings, $6.5 billion of cash flow, and 6 billion a share repurchases, you wind up with greater than $6 of earnings, greater than $8.8 billion of free cash flow, and greater than $7.2 billion of share buybacks. Okay, here's another way to look at current management's guidance that makes the sandbagging hard to ignore. It's no surprise that PayPal has historically been back half weighted. Q3 gets a lift from back to school shopping and Q4 benefits from the holiday shopping season with Q2 EPS guided to 130. This implies first half EPS would total 263. Keep in mind management full year's guidance midpoint is 503. This suggests just 240 in EPS for the entire second half. This doesn't seem to add up. Looking at quarterly EPS chart above, you can see just how rare this would be if this actually played out. In seven of the last nine years, second half EPS was higher than first half, often doubledigit percentages. In six of those nine years, Q1 was the lowest quarter. Not to mention, Q4 has never been the lowest quarter for current guidance to hold. Payal's entire seasonal pattern would need to be flipped on its head. I.e., we'd have to put Christmas in January. We'd assign the odds of this happening as slim to none. Meanwhile, PayPal continues to roll out new growth drivers. NFC launches in Germany in Q2. PayPal Everyw"

      "All right. So now getting into Lip Bhutan. Look, all you need to know about Lip Bhutan is he's coming to turn around the company. He did the exact same thing in Cadence Designs. You can see when he got in at $3.50 a share in 2009. Uh when he left in May of 2023, it was $239. He had a 68 bagger 6,800% in 16 in 14 years. 1 million became 68 million. I'm not saying he's going to do that with Intel, but I do think four or five bagger is in the cards if you get this thing four to five years to play out. Maybe a little sooner because this guy is a miracle worker. Uh, and probably 90% of the work was done by Gellzinger as it relates to getting these foundaries in place. So, you can go through all of this detailed stuff. Uh, kudos. Jeff did a great job on getting through some of this stuff and then the key points again uh you can go through with that some highlights on Etsy which we're going to do in more detail next week as well as Generrack. Okay, Generrack beat uh Etsy showing some good stuff on one of its platforms, the other platform they're selling. Free cash flow continues to hum. Uh here's the fear and greed index down at 39. National Association of Active Investment Managers, they they sold all in the hole at the beginning of April, down to 35% equity exposure. They are going to have to chase up like it's going out of style. Oil and gas equipment services earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days revised down. These are going to get close to a bottom here soon. Um, a lot of the stock prices have held up, which is why I haven't run like crazy to get into them yet, but I'm keeping an eye on them regularly. ARC earnings down 5.5% for this year, 4.6% for next year. Always keeping an eye on that one because it's kind of the most speculative companies in the market. Uh, we covered the ADP report. The most important thing coming is the jobs report. expected only 129,000 jobs, non-farm payrolls, down from 228. This should, if we get a weak jobs report, if the ADP report is a precursor, you got three things going. You got the low PCE number, inflation number, you had uh the the labor market is where they're all focused. So, if the labor market's weak, if you got a tick up from 4.2 to say 4.3 or 4.4, four uh you could you know May becomes an interesting meeting but definitely June because it gives them cover. I mean if they could cut they would cut it's just they need cover. They can't speculate they have to justify and of oftentimes by the time you can justify like Buffett says if you wait for the Robins to sing it's already spring and you're too late. So, um, moving on to earnings, 73% beat rate, 10.1% year-on-year growth. That syncs with a 3% GDP number, X inventories versus the negative.3 that you saw with all the pull forward uh, impacting the net exports part of the equation. Uh, this is what I was talking about with estimates come down 3.6% from 275 to 265, but backend loaded 302. So you're looking at 302 divided by 265 13 14% earnings growth from this year to next year for the S&P 500 as it stands. So the question is whether the market can look through all of this and the answer we're going to find out, but I think can possibly be yes. So",
