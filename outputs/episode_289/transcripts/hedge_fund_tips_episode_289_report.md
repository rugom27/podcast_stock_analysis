## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is currently oversold and sentiment is flushed out. The administration is threading a needle, making bold moves that cause volatility, but also paying attention to markets and trying to prevent a significant downturn. A combination of fiscal and monetary policy, along with potential trade deals, could lead to a significant rally.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| GDP | -0.3% | The headline GDP number was negative, but excluding inventory loading ahead of tariffs, it would be around +3.0%. The administration needs to avoid two consecutive negative quarters. |
| ADP Jobs Number | 62,000 vs 120,000 expected | A weak ADP jobs number points to a slowing economy, increasing the potential for a 'Fed put'. |
| PCE Inflation | 2.3% | The lowest PCE inflation since November also supports the potential for a 'Fed put'. |
| Treasury Buyback Program | Enhancements being considered | The Treasury is considering enhancing its buyback program to lower long-term borrowing costs, effectively a new form of quantitative easing. |
| Earnings Growth | 10% year-on-year | Earnings are up 10% year-on-year, indicating the world is not ending. |
| Earnings Estimates | Down 3.6% year-to-date on the S&P 500 | Estimates have been coming down, but 2026 estimates are holding up, suggesting the market is trading at a reasonable multiple of next year's earnings. |
| Retail Sentiment | Emotionally downbeat on stocks, but allocations have barely dropped | Retail investors are holding tight, while professionals have been selling at the wrong time. |
| Ryex Bull Bear Ratio | Off the charts bearish | This is usually what you see at these bounces. |
| Durable Goods New Orders Non-Defense Aircraft and Parts | Through the roof | Positive sign for the economy. |
| US Small Capitalization Total Return Index | Percentage above its 1945 trend line average | You get a few of these opportunities in a career. |
