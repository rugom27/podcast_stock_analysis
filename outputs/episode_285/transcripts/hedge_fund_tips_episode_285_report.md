- International stocks are poised to outperform US stocks.
- Value stocks are outperforming growth stocks.

- The dollar is collapsing.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is experiencing a clearing event related to tariff uncertainty, which creates opportunities to buy high-quality companies at discounted prices. International markets, particularly China, are poised to outperform the US due to stimulus and a weaker dollar. The housing sector is set to benefit from declining mortgage rates and demographic trends.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| AAII Bearish Sentiment Index | Worse than during the COVID lows and the Great Financial Crisis lows. | This extreme bearishness indicates a buying opportunity. |
| US 10-Year Treasury Yield | Drops below 4%. | This is what mortgage rates price off of and is going to get all these things going. |
| China's Factory Activity Growth | At one-year high. | Go where the stimulus is. |
| US Auto Sales | Up 8.8% in March. | Volumes are going to be through the roof. |
