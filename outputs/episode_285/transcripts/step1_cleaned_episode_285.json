pops it over and then a couple more and we&#39;ll get right down to it here here we go on a breakaway finds the open net boom and\n\nfinally here [Applause] boom pick in the corner so that was pretty exciting now\n\ndown to business\n\ndown to business\n\nhad the pleasure to join Karina Mitchell uh also want to thank uh Bruno for having me on cgtn America and um that&#39;s Bruno feldberg and this was going into the announcement which you know came out uh kind of worse than most people expected in terms of the um uh bite in the tariffs and we&#39;re going to talk a lot about that today and how we can take advantage of the opportunity that it created but let&#39;s listen in we off to a 10 start to the second quarter of 2025 to put it mildly let&#39;s get some new insight into how markets and the economy are holding up amid all of the Tariff Tantrums Thomas Hayes joins us for that he&#39;s a Founder chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas thanks for coming on thanks for having me Karina so Thomas tell me first of all what do you make of Market Market reaction today ahead of these tariffs what&#39;s it signaling to you about just how much investors actually believe Trump follows through on all of these grandiose tariff pledges reports are 20% on a broad range of imports but nothing&#39;s firm yet well this might be the most telegraphed quote unquote surprise in the history of stock markets I think a lot of the bad news is already priced in and as Warren Buffett says when be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy and right now people are super fearful as a matter of fact if you look at the a aii bearish sentiment indicator of retail investors it&#39;s the most pessimistic since the tech wreck in 2022 and more pessimistic than the lows of covid and the lows of the great financial crisis so if you&#39;re not looking for opportunities in times like these with high quality businesses when they&#39;re marked down when are you going to look for them you know we say on Wall Street it&#39;s the only Market you can go when they hold a clearance sale no one shows up to buy yeah so you say you know buy the dip look for the bargains now stay ahead of the curb if he actually does follow through could you tell me if so if these tariffs stick for any period of time what does that do to stocks and to the economy well look it it&#39;s a onetime level up okay and right now based on how the market performed in the first quarter with the US underperforming International Stocks by the widest margin in over two decades S&amp;P down about 5% International of about 8% uh a lot of the worst case is priced in so you have a level up in prices but at the end of the day how many of these businesses are going to stand up factories in the US for three and a half years and spend tens of billions of dollars to do so the products that they provide will still be in demand they&#39;ll have to get it they&#39;ll have you know some will get passed through the consumer some will be uh shared by the manufacturers and the suppliers but at the end of the day it&#39;s a one time it&#39;s not 20% compounded at 10% per year it&#39;s 20% one time and the market will digest it in a matter of weeks and you can use that opportunity and that volatility to buy high quality companies for the long term it&#39;s not the case that tariffs come in and every business goes out of out of business because someone new starts up in the United States not what&#39;s going to happen what&#39;s going to happen is uh there&#39;ll be some short-term friction and long-term reward welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 new day new headline new volatility resolves higher over time so you&#39;re saying everybody should just take a breath but you know GDP for the first quarter is not going to come in anywhere near the 2.4% we saw in Q4 some say we can actually see a contraction because of all of this tariff volatility do you think we need to work worry about a recession no I don&#39;t think we do need to worry about a recession at this point the numbers that you&#39;re seeing as far as Atlanta G GDP now are noisy because of inventories and some pull forwards and and related to the uncertainty of policy but this happens every four years you have uncertainty in the first quarter with a new Administration it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy it has to be known policy and what the market grappled with in the first quarter was unknown policy and we&#39;re to get greater resolution and you could find in the next few days or the next couple of weeks this is a clearing event whether it turns out positive or negative at least we&#39;ll know what the rules of the game are and we can adjust accordingly and that&#39;s what Wall Street wants to see so you&#39;re saying you know it&#39;s been a miserable first quarter by all accounts all the major averages lower flirting or in correction inflation creeping higher so what do you actually anticipate seeing with stocks near term and then midterm as well well look I think the theme that we came into the year worth with is going to continue and the theme that we came in was you want to be buying International stocks particularly China Tech our largest position that we&#39;ve built up over the last year and a half has been Alibaba uh we think that&#39;s going to continue to outperform we think International stocks are going to continue to outperform as the dollar weekends mag 7 would underperform due to increased capb backs and lower earnings power decelerating earnings I think we&#39;re at the point now where enough of those stocks are oversold that you could see a bounce in mag 7 in the coming quarter but I do think it&#39;s going to stay in that range even if it trades back up to the top of the range I do think Mag s will underperform I do think International stocks will outperform domestic stocks this year and that&#39;s where your opportunity is going to be so if you&#39;re a Trader maybe take a punt on some of these tech stocks if you&#39;re an investor start buying Industrials everything that&#39;s perceived to be affected by tariffs that has been marked down this is a perfect example Karina instead of buy the rumor sell the news this is a sell the rumor bu the news sell the rumor of tariffs buy it when it&#39;s actually announced and I think we&#39;re going to have opportunities here into Q2 and Beyond guidance has been taken down materially in q1 that&#39;s the normal game every year first quarter CEOs give conservative guidance so they can beat in the subsequent three quarters get their bonuses get their options shareholders are happy and this year will be no different I love that you&#39;re talking about International stocks there as well because Nvidia down 21% year to date Tesla down 28% year to date tell me quickly where do you stand on gold where do you see that going I have no view on gold as it yields no cash uh I like businesses that generate free cash flow that I can measure that are growing that are high quality durable businesses gold is just a bet on who&#39;s going to come in after you and buy it at a higher price and that I&#39;ll leave that game for other people okay we&#39;ll see how it all shakes out on Liberation day Thomas Hayes thanks so much for coming on thank you Karina and still in here and we&#39;re back and then uh and by the way not much of that changes even though the facts somewhat changed and we&#39;re going to go through why so first and foremost this just came in after the Clos today Trump tariff live updates president Trump says he&#39;s open into negotiations contradicting wh White House AIDS like um Peter Navaro and others and um uh so that&#39;s that the other thing I wanted to do is step back and put things in perspective here I just kind of said $600 billion okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s say this is a number what&#39;s the number so what is everyone afraid of well the stock market is comprised the name of the game with the stock market is called earnings okay and so I pulled this up and I found out what is the aggregate net income meaning the earnings power of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 months and it came out to 1.9 trillion okay 1.9 trillion on uh I think it&#39;s about 19 trillion 7 trillion of Revenue and 19 1.9 trillion of net income so you could say okay we have a problem Houston we have a problem uh number one is if the S&amp;P 500 companies number one they&#39;re not 100% % of the companies in America so let&#39;s just assume they&#39;re half so that means it would be a $300 billion if they assumed all of the loss they passed nothing on to suppliers they passed nothing onto customers and they just said well we&#39;re going to be a benevolent uh company uh we&#39;re going to actually switch the opposite of chat GPT we&#39;re going to go from being a for-profit to a nonprofit and we&#39;ll just eat all of these tariffs rather than pass it on to Consumers uh you&#39;re basically looking at you know 300 billion of two trillion so you know you you start to get into 15% of earnings give or take that&#39;s if they assume all of the pain all of the time 15% of earnings well last I checked the S&amp;P 500 I believe is down give or take 12% is that correct maybe more today let&#39;s pull it up okay so you&#39;re effectively at the worst case scenario meaning the Market&#39;s down 15% and earnings are down 15% okay so year to date okay so it was 3.39 yesterday and it dropped 5% today so you got give or take nine it dropped a total of 10 or 11% was in kind of Correction territory this morning so give or take 10% 11% and you&#39;ve got 15% of earnings now number one I&#39;ve probably overestimated the percentage of the 600 billion that&#39;s attributed to public companies versus private companies um and number two I&#39;ve have 100% overestimated the amount that the companies are actually going to eat um this is effectively there&#39;s no other way to say it this is a tax on the poor okay now ultimately in the short term because it&#39;s not you know whatever it is 20 plus% compounded at 10% a year it&#39;s a one time level up so it&#39;s a one time tax on the poor why do I say tax on the poor because the average uh you know a lot of people don&#39;t feel a dollar in milk or you know a dollar per gallon in gas and a lot of people do but the people who do are the people who are going to feel it the most so this is going to hurt them the most in the short term in the longer term I do think this is going to be much better for labor than it is for Capital uh meaning the people doing real jobs are going to be uh proportionately gaining a lot more than the people managing assets uh and that&#39;s a good thing and that&#39;s what we saw in the first term of trump 1.0 real wages at the salari level increased by the the most for uh across all demographics uh but particularly the low-end and the middle end got the biggest bump uh uh minorities got the biggest bump and I think that&#39;s a great thing for America and I think that&#39;s going to be the result that happens out of this so but since we&#39;re on a stock market podcast and um uh we we want to make money in the stock market what we have to do is out of every crisis comes opportunity and take advantage of these opportunities when they are handed to us so uh couple quick shoutouts before we start to drill down I just wanted to really kick off by showing you zoom out and and effectively you&#39;re looking at 15% maximum uh absorbed by the S you know uh hit to EPs and then more likely than not it&#39;s half of that which is 7% which the market has already priced in and that&#39;s why uh I love these undercuts so we went back and retested the lows and you always have to undercut to really scare the pants off people and get their stock you know I had had the uh um some anyway it&#39;s funny the people who don&#39;t give you business are the first ones to call you and ask you for your advice uh when when when these situations happen and um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of comical but nonetheless I&#39;m always happy to help and um and I said look you know actually their question was about VF Corp and what I said was I said listen I can guarantee you uh 100% if you&#39;re going to sell your VF Corp today there will be a buyer okay I just need you to text me 20 seconds before you place the sell order okay I&#39;m happy to take every single share that you have in in your possession uh and we were in the market buying and I and I want to acknowledge too just uh you know first you build something then it builds you and I think that&#39;s really what&#39;s happened with this podcast I want to acknowledge one person in particular was the first email I saw this morning when I woke up and I saw the Futures down you know S&amp;P or Dow was down like 1,200 points uh Marlin I&#39;m not going to give your last name but Marlin is uh is a larger longtime customer and he said to me uh Tom use my margin to buy stocks today I&#39;m sending you another seven figures tomorrow uh to cover it and and then he quoted uh my quote which is Warren&#39;s quote when it rains gold put out a bucket not a thimble and I was in the market taking advantage of that for Marlin and I was in the market across every single account where I could find some space to take advantage of these opportunities does that mean that I&#39;m like Peter Navaro who got on at 4:30 and said based on my technical analysis I think this is the bottom the market I mean what a complete to be honest with you to get on TV and say that after putting out this policy but leaving that aside uh it is what it is and um you you literally can&#39;t make this stuff up but um so so uh so we were able to do that in every account but you know we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t go Cowboy it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to exceed our position side limits it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to exceed our maximum leverage that we&#39;re willing to use because at the end of the day these things were already priced for death so they overshot for a day maybe they&#39;ll overshoot for AEK week until April 9th when everything&#39;s finalized but I think more likely than not uh all the we hands are out and and you basically have opportunity perspectively moving forward so that&#39;s what we wanted to take advantage of and going back to the seasonal stuff that we&#39;ve shared with you over and over it tends to get weak in the postelection Years uh up until the end of March at to early April and we&#39;ve been talking about that for some time ever since we said buckle up butter cup February and March get bumpy make your shopping list uh intel was one of the stocks we were in buying today as well not just VF Corp but Intel and Intel uh announced that or the in information had a leak out Intel tsmc tentatively agree to form chip making joint venture were we able to get it at $19 and $18 like we could last fall no but did we get it at high 20 and change just below 21 today yeah and that&#39;s a gift that&#39;s Mana from heaven I mean lip Buu tan just bought 25 million with his own money at $25 a share and we were able to to uh top up at less than 21 that is Mana from Heaven um oh also want to shout out to not only Marlin I want to shout out to my uh clients uh uh large family office came in from Dallas Chris and Brian for having me up to La took me out to a great breakfast we got to catch up and hear about all the exciting stuff that they&#39;re doing so super excited for them I also had the chance to speak to the YPO Dubai uh today thanks to Craig and to uh AJ for setting that up and making the introduction we&#39;ll be seeing you uh briefly in Dubai when I&#39;m out to see uh um a great client of mine in Dubai I&#39;m super excited for that in the end of May um and uh and that&#39;s that so just going through methodically everything we want to cover now let&#39;s look at some indicators to kind of see where we are and see if Peter Navarro&#39;s technical analysis is going to save the day um unless he knows a ton of liquidity is coming and he wants to look like a genius which I wouldn&#39;t put which I would not put put by him for sure uh this is not updated for uh today but my guess is this is well above 1.0 Everyone likes to buy puts in the Hole uh same thing with the trend we kind of peaked out a couple of days ago option skew is looking okay bullish percent S&amp;P 500 is getting towards the bottom end of the ranges [Music] um 10day put call is elevated pmo buy all and buy SPX have held up a lot better than expected given that the market is down which tells me that less stocks are going down than you would think based on the indices and oddly enough the ones that have been most impacted and even today if you look at today uh before I switch out of this it&#39;s been mag seven I mean mag s has been getting pummeled and we got out of it all at July and we thought we were Geniuses except it went up another 10% and now it&#39;s well below where we got out in July so we&#39;re never going to get the perfect top we&#39;re never going to get the perfect bottom but we get enough of the fat in the middle that we are happy so um bonds are outperforming the S&amp;P National Association of active in all the active managers have sold Down in the Hole now um they started selling when we hit the first bottom and that they&#39;ve sold everything out which means we&#39;re ready to go out we&#39;re ready to turn the corner and it&#39;s not going to take a whole lot because basically the worst case scenario news is out on a daily basis I mean are people going to want to be long into the weekend maybe maybe not we&#39;ll see but when you see uh this the NYU down Nega 6000 I mean we haven&#39;t seen that in ages I mean that that is usually uh where you&#39;re going to see a massive let me just see here on a daily basis you&#39;re going to see a massive bounce I mean this is this is hysterical uh daily so you saw it in December of last year you saw it in August let&#39;s see if we can get an overlay of a price I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to be able to see it daily but I can just tell you that this is Extreme and let me put it behind there so yeah that was the short-term bottom you got a huge rally off that that was a short-term bottom you got a huge rally off that so you definitely I mean this is this is this is capitulation okay this is definitely short-term capitulation certainly for the next couple of days I would think uh and I&#39;d be close to betting that it&#39;s near the bottom so for those of you uh who already got money in you&#39;re golden your position for those of you who are get trying to get into this uh second quarter raise get it in now because like two weeks from now look it could be lower and your Genius in in 12 months it&#39;s not going to matter it&#39;s not going to matter whether you bought VF Corp at 16 bucks or you bought VF Corp at 12 bucks because 12 to 24 months out is going to be back at mid 20s and probably the 30s and then the the business will start improving uh same thing with Cooper standard Bob is held up it was actually green part of the day intel was green part of the day Crown Castle&#39;s been doing great so you know these are the opportunities and I put out on Twitter um gosh I didn&#39;t have any of this stuff queued up but let&#39;s see what we can do here first thing this morning when everyone was puking at the open I put this out and what I said was and this is something that you may want to print out I said private Equity Funds will take no markdowns today quote unquote markdowns today apartment owners will not fire sale their buildings today it&#39;s why Efficient Market Theory doesn&#39;t work if it did work I would be out of a job human nature never changes and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been able to do what I have and that is never going to change ladies and gentlemen and it&#39;s during these periods of dislocation I mean this is really the only place you can get outperformance is if you&#39;re buying over the last 3 four weeks after you put in the first bottom in early March and then you you continue to add on the retest and now the follow through and the fake out and all that stuff if you&#39;re not buying when prices are crazy town and you have Force Sellers and margin clerks calling people up and forcing them out of the market you&#39;re just not going to outperform what today is is the closet indexers that have been jammed into mag 7 all caught with their pants down swimming naked and that&#39;s really what it comes down to why are the Biggest Losers of the Year mag 7 when most of them are largely unaffected by tariffs and the answer is is because they&#39;re all sheep and they all got slaughtered okay let&#39;s look at year to date look the whole Market is green and if you think the whole US market is green how about the Chinese market okay look at the Biggest Losers of the Year mag 7 Microsoft Apple Amazon Tesla Google meta Nvidia okay again go back to the June 20th article I wrote the next pain trade when Nvidia was 140 bucks and it went to 152 after I wrote the article and everyone said you&#39;re wrong and today it closed at $101 okay so this is all you need to know ladies and gentlemen if you were here because you have a fake manager that was closet indexing like a sheep and got slaughtered and the Market&#39;s down 5% and you&#39;re down 40% well that&#39;s all you need to know but if you have an actual manager who&#39;s got you in good quality stocks you are going to be great moving out okay and here&#39;s the here&#39;s the better news is all these closet indexers got forc liquidated in the last few weeks so when these technically bounce and these are going to Bounce by the way um they&#39;re not even going to be in it so they&#39;re going to miss it on the downside selling in the hole and they&#39;re going to miss it back on the upside and then they&#39;re going to buy back at the top of the range and as mag 7 underperforms this year and goes back down after it gets to the top of the range they&#39;re going to get jammed again and and this is just history repeating over and over and over so as you can tell I&#39;m kind of going to add lib today because we&#39;re you know live in real time taking advantage of all this stuff and this is going to be a long one so you know if you don&#39;t want information to make money during crisis then then uh go watch Netflix but uh maybe it&#39;ll help their stock a little bit uh what did Netflix do today uh I don&#39;t know can&#39;t even find it but if it&#39;s mag7 it&#39;s probably down this year so leave it at that um we went through these indicators we went through this that this is unbelievable this nyud uh skew skew you know when skew gets down to this level you&#39;re pretty much bottomed because all the insurance plans out of the money insurance plans have cashed in or not um values continue to outperform growth this might be a short-term Peak maybe the tech starts to bounce and brings the indices up but let&#39;s look on a company by compan basis I mean this feels like the apocalypse for a lot of people that that have been stuck with closet indexing or actual indexing and and you\n\nu were here because you have a fake manager that was closet indexing like a sheep and got slaughtered and the Market&#39;s down 5% and you&#39;re down 40% well that&#39;s all you need to know but if you have an actual manager who&#39;s got you in good quality stocks you are going to be great moving out okay and here&#39;s the here&#39;s the better news is all these closet indexers got forc liquidated in the last few weeks so when these technically bounce and these are going to Bounce by the way um they&#39;re not even going to be in it so they&#39;re going to miss it on the downside selling in the hole and they&#39;re going to miss it back on the upside and then they&#39;re going to buy back at the top of the range and as mag 7 underperforms this year and goes back down after it gets to the top of the range they&#39;re going to get jammed again and and this is just history repeating over and over and over so as you can tell I&#39;m kind of going to add lib today because we&#39;re you know live in real time taking advantage of all this stuff and this is going to be a long one so you know if you don&#39;t want information to make money during crisis then then uh go watch Netflix but uh maybe it&#39; help their stock a little bit uh what did Netflix do today uh I don&#39;t know can&#39;t even find it but if it&#39;s mag7 it&#39;s probably down this year so leave it at that um we went through these indicators we went through this that this is unbelievable this nyud uh skew skew you know when skew gets down to this level you&#39;re pretty much bottomed because all the insurance plans out of the money insurance plans have cashed in or not um values continue to outperform growth this might be a short-term Peak maybe the tech starts to bounce and brings the indices up but let&#39;s look on a company by compan basis I mean this feels like the apocalypse for a lot of people that that have been stuck with closet indexing or actual indexing and and you finally  got your your head handed to you um but like ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nBoeing I mean I love it here it&#39;s does it go lower sure it could go lower it could go back to 138 but I mean if you&#39;re not starting to buy it here and you don&#39;t see two three years out this thing&#39;s a double then I I can&#39;t help you wrong podcast go for the shiny object podcast that all got you slammed into these and now you don&#39;t know which way is up because you were levered long all this garbage that has gotten smashed um\n\nfinally  got your your head handed to you um but like Boeing I mean I love it here it&#39;s does it go lower sure it could go lower it could go back to 138 but I mean if you&#39;re not starting to buy it here and you don&#39;t see two three years out this thing&#39;s a double then I I can&#39;t help you wrong podcast go for the shiny object podcast that all got you slammed into these and now you don&#39;t know which way is up because you were levered long all this garbage that has gotten smashed um\n\n--- OVERLAP CONTINUED ---\n\nmoving along  let&#39;s take a look stock by stock Disney we were in the market buying Disney today I mean we haven&#39;t had a chance to buy that in ages um Nike I got to tell you I mean where did Amman get in $78 now it&#39;s at 55 my guess is he was in the market buying today I can&#39;t speak for him but uh uh we like we like Brack and Daryl much better so so that&#39;s kind of where our Focus has been but but uh I I think you can&#39;t really go wrong in in the low 50s High 40s with that Disney uh caterpillars had a big run I mean even Microsoft this looks like it wants to to bounce technically JP Morgan these are not catastrophic moves these are really a lot of different opportunities let&#39;s look at some NASDAQ stocks Biogen has been cheap forever uh keeping my eye on that with biotech that&#39;s that&#39;s going we were in the market buying xbi um what else Nvidia new low this is probably the fake out to take out the final anyway uh meta getting smashed down from 725 to 525 I mean look I gotta be honest some of these are getting tempted but if I have my choice to buy meta or to buy PayPal we were buying the hell out of PayPal today I mean this is yeah Yu&#39;s threatening we&#39;re going to charge a tariff your payment people it hurts their own people if they do it they do it if they don&#39;t they don&#39;t the bottom line is the guy&#39;s going to buy back 20% of the company over the next 24 months it&#39;s a leading business if they get hurt their competitors are going to get hurt more at the end of the day it&#39;s what I tried to share with you last week which is if it hurts these companies that have a moe it hurts their competitors even more which means they&#39;re going to be able to consolidate them and buy them up and come out stronger so bigger companies Quality Companies and that&#39;s what I do in periods of dislocation I&#39;m not buying the lowest quality stuff that could actually get toasted I&#39;m buying some of the highest quality in their spaces so during these periods of dislocation they&#39;re actually the gainers they consolidate the weak people like Baba when China was uninvestable like Exxon Mobile during 2020 when oil went negative like Wells Fargo during the covid lows at 2510 highest quality in the periods of mass dislocation uh when Banks and energy were getting hammered uh last two years when China was getting hammered now you got sneaker companies getting hammered uh and everything else so this is like you know a day like this you know yeah look everyone gets hit by a mark to Market and and people think that matters but these days are like Christmas I mean people could not understand I was talking to the YPO group and they couldn&#39;t understand why I was giddy I was like listen I need to get off this call because 11:30 is coming up and the losers in Europe sell at 11:30 because they&#39;re chicken littles to go home long and uh and then I need to be around for 230 when the margin clerks hit up the US guys that are levered long on their zero dated options so when they&#39;re structurally blown up their account I can buy all the that they&#39;re forced to puke by the margin margin clerks and that just comes from experience and that just comes from knowing what you own and owning quality businesses so if the marks went another 10% lower would I be excited about that no I wouldn&#39;t be excited about that but would I be worried about that I would not be worried about that because if I look 12 24 36 months out based on the businesses that we own and we&#39;ve underwritten as if we own the entire company before we even buy one share of stock we are not tracing chasing price we are not doing magical technical analysis like Peter Navaro calling the bottom today because he used to be a CNBC contributor and he&#39;s an expert technical analyst commentator uh that&#39;s now working a $100,000 job after getting out of jail um you know so I I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel on the next podcast but leave it leave it there uh magnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion dollar as Tech Drive stock market nose dive um so look we spent three months saying lien up on mag 7 Canadian dollar climbs to four-month high after tariff reveal ladies it&#39;s\n\nuh last two years when China was getting hammered now you got sneaker companies getting hammered uh and everything else so this is like you know a day like this you know yeah look everyone gets hit by a mark to Market and and people think that matters but these days are like Christmas I mean people could not understand I was talking to the YPO group and they couldn't understand why I was giddy I was like listen I need to get off this call because 11:30 is coming up and the losers in Europe sell at 11:30 because they're chicken littles to go home long and uh and then I need to be around for 230 when the margin clerks hit up the US guys that are levered long on their zero dated options so when they're structurally blown up their account I can buy all the that they're forced to puke by the margin margin clerks and that just comes from experience and that just comes from knowing what you own and owning quality businesses so if the marks went another 10% lower would I be excited about that no I wouldn't be excited about that but would I be worried about that I would not be worried about that because if I look 12 24 36 months out based on the businesses that we own and we've underwritten as if we own the entire company before we even buy one share of stock we are not tracing chasing price we are not doing magical technical analysis like Peter Navaro calling the bottom today because he used to be a CNBC contributor and he's an expert technical analyst commentator uh that's now working a $100,000 job after getting out of jail ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nmagnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion dollar as Tech Drive stock market nose dive um so look we spent three months saying lien up on mag 7 Canadian dollar climbs to four-month high after tariff reveal ladies it's finally  happened did did the Canadian dollar go against us before it went for us yes but it's now moving up and I think it's going to persist so all the Canadians that are worried and angry at Trump don't worry you're going to be fine okay all the Mexicans you're going to be fine don't worry about it it's going to work itself out uh I'd Bel long L Looney you guys are going to have huge purchasing power over the next 12 to 24 months the Tariff thing will get resolved you have natural resources you're a great country you're a great you got great leaders like Wayne Gretzky I'm joking not joking uh and and you don't need to become a state to be amazing you're already amazing we love you I know we have a lot of Canadian listeners all right let's get\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ndown to business  here we&#39;ve got uh number one thing you want to look at during periods of Crisis is high yield credit spreads and a quick proxy for that is just take a quick look at jnk credit markets are not seizing up despite fear being at record all-time highs worse than during the great financial crisis lows and the covid lows if if a aii bearish sentiment is of any importance to you we&#39;re effectively back to the levels we were in high yield uh at the beginning of the year so not much to worry about if it shoots down here we start to get a little bit more concerned and and uh maybe adjust accordingly but at the moment all good in the hood uh next is S&P 500 I love the undercut you of see test then overshoots and undercuts during major bottoms here we are could it go a lot lower sure it could go a lot lower would I bet on it I think it&#39;s going to work itself out in the next week or or so if not sooner and I love this undercut because it forced all the the remaining hands to capitulate um we can go back 20 years and everyone says you know we&#39;re going to go back and retest the loads you never really go back and ret test lows you tend to break down to get everyone out and then you open up higher uh after doing that whether it&#39;s on a weekly or monthly well guess what R TLT speaking of which a friend emailed uh texted me today and said that his new one of his clients just got a 7-year adjustable armm ARM mortgage at 5.1% 7 % arm at 5.1% uh and that is a firsttime home buyer 5.1% mortgage for the next seven years for a firsttime home buyer so housing is going to be the name of the game and when 10-year yield got to 480 we everyone was saying five we were saying three handle before four well here we are at four we&#39;re going to hit a three handle and we&#39;re going to start to see high fives on the 30-year mortgage and housing is going to rip which was our article of the week uh home site home which we&#39;re going to cover dollar how excited are we the dollar is collapsing is it it&#39;s just getting started ladies and gentlemen this is going to go a lot lower so all you folks with the loonies out there Rock and Roll Baby save your cash you&#39;re going to have some serious purchasing power around the world this is the beginning just like we saw in when 2001 this is going to continue to downtrend the US dollar and like we talked about last week this may be a precursor part of the negotiation with the tariffs hit them in the in the forehead and then say okay well if you don&#39;t like tariffs let&#39;s both go to zero and you&#39;re going to stop manipulating your currency and we&#39;re going to revalue the US dollar like we did in the plaza Accord uh in the 80s under Reagan we&#39;re going to do the exact same thing and we&#39;ll take down the tariffs and boom We&#39;re Off to the Races so all of these things are on the table and if you&#39;re not positioned and I&#39;m not saying you know lever long s S&amp;P but buy a handful of great businesses that you love that are already pricing in the apocalypse and just sit tight and don&#39;t do it on any major leverage or any major margin modest so that you can sit through any fluctuations of the next few weeks and not get shaken out like so many people today and you&#39;re going to thank me later and and it&#39;s rinse and repeat over and over and if days like today didn&#39;t exist there&#39;s no way any manager can get significant outperformance if you&#39;re not in a position to be able to buy during during times like the last few weeks where they served up unbelievable businesses at generationally uh advantageous prices and we took advantage and we pounced every red day and today was another day that we&#39;re taking advantage of so um that&#39;s a put call not all of these are up to date but look you you start to see levels of extremes that become buying opportunities for the people that are informed and paying attention major buying opportunities major buying opportunities uh NASDAQ up down I think NASDAQ gets a bounce here I think the mag s&#39;s going to get a bounce I think it trades to the top of the range in coming months and then everyone jumps in at the top and it goes back down mag 7 under performs this year China outperforms been saying the same thing next few months may look a little different but uh when we get to December that will be the outcome in our view um small caps we&#39;re buying today I mean you know it&#39;s you got to skate to where the Puck&#39;s going not where it&#39;s already been National Association puked in the hole could they puke more of course they could uh they might be forced to puke a lot of the closet indexer that were all mag seven they&#39;re they&#39;re just getting roasted all the FAS that have all these index funds I mean their clients are calling them all day long they don&#39;t know what they own they&#39;re just like it&#39;s going down what should we do I don&#39;t know what do you want to do what do you want to do what do you want to do I don&#39;t know what should I do boss what should I do CU they&#39;re asset gatherers it&#39;s a it&#39;s a whole different game S&P 500 bullish percent okay this is a level again where you start to find bottoms okay same thing by the way at the beginning of March okay and that&#39;s it you&#39;re retesting now you broke through could you Cascade waterfall all the way down and

NASDAQ again towards levels where you buy you make money same with the NY NYSC summation index same story the retest boom retest boom so these are levels again it pays to be a selective buyer versus a seller okay vix popped up over 30 could it go to 38 before it goes back down to 15 sure it could uh would I bet on it I don&#39;t know I I I I&#39;m not I&#39;m really not worried about that I&#39;m not worried about owning Boeing at $140 or $150 they they&#39;re in they&#39;re in a duopoly so if you can tell me people aren&#39;t going to fly because of tariffs then I&#39;ll listen but they&#39;ve got a half a trillion dollars of backlog what if it goes to 400 billion am I going to lose sleep no okay I&#39;m going to take advantage and and seize these opportunities okay\n\nthey puke

were others by the way uh which I&#39;m very grateful for saying uh you know buy everything you can on margin I&#39;ll send you seven figures tomorrow to to take the margin down and there you go you know and he&#39;s gonna 12 months out it&#39;s probably going to be one of the top performing accounts of all of them because he took advantage of today so uh does the market does not beat them they

Intel Vision 2025 yesterday and he outlined his top priorities focus on engineering Talent particularly tied to dcii uh execute on Panther Lake and iteratively improve yields improve Foundry more details to come expand product portfolio into verticals lean on purpose built silicon as a secular theme desktop software to support AI application layer that is critically important because that is what everyone said was nvidia's mode was they had the software kind of like the app wall Walled Garden this guy is the master of it Cadence designs was the software that all chip designers used to develop when he built that built out that company so now he's going to do it proprietary inside of Intel coupled with The Foundry business this is going to be a legendary turnaround story\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nVF Corp has exposure there 26% of their exposure is Vietnam so 15 only 15 in China I would have thought it's a lot more than I would have thought they were like 80% China so uh that's kind of good news but could they move you know this 26% to Bangladesh where the tariffs are lower sure why not give the Bangladeshi some business\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nif you remember on March 11th I was on vne and Co which I'm going to be no that's the following week never mind um I might be tomorrow morning but everything is in flocks more likely than not I won't be um and I said they should come up with a website and just show item by item how much do they tax Us and how much do we tax them and that's exactly what they did it sounds like Trump and some of his uh advisers watch vanney on Fox Business cuz they laid it out pretty clearly okay what do they tariff us what are we going to tariff them back and in most if not all cases other than the low end at 10% uh it was we came back with about 50% of what they do to us so it's not reciprocal it's not uh that but it's it's in a Direction that's going to generate 600 billion plus which is get get ready for the next phase so he said today in a tweet he said the operation is over now the patient can heal\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nget ready for growth narrative growth narrative being tax cuts deregulation and tariffs in the rearview mirror because that's largely done\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhard and soft data have diverged so this is what's actually happening versus so conference board expecting fewer jobs a lot of people are nervous uh the initial jobless claims are not yet confirming that we will see tomorrow what I will say is critically interesting which we're going to get to is uh fed is now at 85% chance of a cut in June\n### MISCELLANEOUS\njust kind of year to date returns all the last sh be First Healthcare is up at the top International's up at the top Energy's outperformed com Stock's been on a tear uh so we're super happy about that gold is outperformed so all the end of the worlders are super happy congrat rations um just you know not what we do but you know kudos to those people who do that uh equities aggregate in institutional net flows long only have been puking in the hole hedge funds puking in the Hole opinion follows Trend so they were all buying at the top selling in the hole so you know you got to decide what you want to do\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAuto tariffs could reignite used car prices in Auto Repair business that's where Advanced Auto Part start to starts to flourish again\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nweaker and weaker dollar benefits International uh we've been pounding the table and what you've seen in the beginning of this year probably breathe for a little bit but it's just the beginning of a multi- multi-year International versus us outperformance kind of ironic that us Equity exceptionalism will have peaked with the Advent of um the new Administration and I don't think that speaks poorly of the new administration at all and part of it's just the person sitting in the seat uh like I said I think the economy is going to do better than ever and I think the middle class the people who haven't participated in asset price appreciation are going to do better than ever I think passive indexers are going to be less happy I think stock Pickers are going to have the time of their lives\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nvalue versus growth value's been outperforming 23% of stocks beat growth Benchmark beating Russell 1,000 growth index based on trailing 12 months so this is kind of what you see when you want to be a buyer magnificent 7 to lag magnificent 7 magnificent 7 market cap as a percentage of S&P has now dropped from 35% down to 30% boy that was quick\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncoming in global semiconductor sales um we talked about Nvidia in June saying this is a cyclical business I think the one play that's going to be doing well while the rest are suffering is going to be Intel why because every other chip maker depends on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor Intel is going to be a producer of chips not just a designer of chips and they're going to start to take share from Taiwan semiconductor because Trump's going to make sure of it whether he likes Intel or not which I think he will I think he's going to love lip Buu tan and uh as he would say because lip ban is a winner and Trump loves winners so uh expect good things from Intel even if this cycle slows down they're going to be taking share from monopolistic producer Taiwan semiconductor\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nAmerican stocks worth quarter in 23 years relative to International that's been our theme get out of Mag 7 get inter International it all showed up at once in the first quarter\n\n\nwhat you see when you want to be a buyer magnificent 7 to lag magnificent 7 magnificent 7 market cap as a percentage of S&amp;P has now dropped from 35% down to 30% boy that was quick um wow that is unbelievable how quickly that&#39;s and it probably going to Trend even further down even if we get a technical bounce stocks at record 29% of us household Financial assets buying the top no International exposure common theme that&#39;s going to change very quickly and a lot of that money is going to flow into International next slowdown coming in global semiconductor sales um we talked about Nvidia in June saying this is a cyclical business I think the one play that&#39;s going to be doing well while the rest are suffering is going to be Intel why because every other chip maker depends on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor Intel is going to be a producer of chips not just a designer of chips and they&#39;re going to start to take share from Taiwan semiconductor because Trump&#39;s going to make sure of it whether he likes Intel or not which I think he will I think he&#39;s going to love lip Buu tan and uh as he would say because lip ban is a winner and Trump loves winners so uh expect good things from Intel even if this cycle slows down they&#39;re going to be taking share from monopolistic producer Taiwan semiconductor um or partnering with them as we saw in the information which is even better American Stock it&#39;ll just accelerate the process American stocks worth quarter in 23 years relative to International that&#39;s been our theme get out of Mag 7 get inter International it all showed up at once in the first quarter uh and that&#39;s super exciting us fundamental long short net leverage so they&#39;ve just absolutely gotten smoked gotten out of all leverage that&#39;s why mag 7 is smoked they&#39;re just liquidating out getting redeemed out and bleeding on the carpet and um and that usually creates the the vacuum to for smart buyers to step in\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  the five-week moving average of the a aii bearish sentiment index it is worse than during the covid lows worse than during the great financial crisis lows the worst going all the way back to uh the 2022 lows and then prior to that going back to the 1989 1990 recession lows there&#39;s bearish as they can get so you can tell me that I don&#39;t want to be a buyer when everyone else is bearish and I&#39;d say okay well you&#39;re part of the herd but you don&#39;t get these type of returns by buying when no one wants to in the hole when everyone else is pessimistic um a bad March could mean a better April so this is from Carson when you have these horrible uh marches April is on average up anywhere from two you know 1% to 133% with an average of 2.9% and a median of 2% so if you think about the indices rallying 3% you start to think about individual names rallying 15 20 30% and for folks like Marlin who uh woke up this morning and saw opportunity and put out his bucket kudos to you 12 months I look I can&#39;t tell you where Marlin&#39;s going to be 12 days from now or even 12 weeks from now but I can tell you 12 months from now he&#39;s going to look back at that email and and realize what a what a rockstar he was and for the new people that have been coming in today the new inquiries to get in uh before we close out this q1 Q2 opening uh we&#39;re going to close out on the 12th so nine days left um they&#39;ll they&#39;ll have the same exact thing and the existing clients we&#39;ve been topping up you guys are so well positioned look I can&#39;t get brand new people in the spreads on Baba that we did a year and a half ago that are up huge uh millions of dollars in aggregate but that&#39;s the way it goes you know but I can get them in other incred incredible opportunities just like you know if you&#39;re fully invested I can&#39;t get you you know in uh you know a a ton of VF Corp at $3 but you already have it at $15 so or $16 so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just opportunities Galore so let&#39;s look at um price to earnings here nasdaq&#39;s valuation Retreat so it&#39;s gone from 37 times earnings down to uh 22 times so if you remember I spent five weeks going on TV in December and January saying mag 7 earning PES 33 35 times their earnings grow decelerating from 33% down to 16% the multiple doesn&#39;t come down well guess what just happened the multiple came down probably comes down a little bit more and then you get your huge technical bounces\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nno one wants to in the hole when everyone else is pessimistic um a bad March could mean a better April so this is from Carson when you have

there consensus earnings growth the biggest consensus earnings growth expectations are small cap and they have the lowest multiple and you can&#39;t give them away I was buying that today so okay into other people&#39;s selling that&#39;s we went through this with Baba ladies and gentlemen and that&#39;s why we have a basis of $82 $83 because every red day we had an opportunity to sell in the hole like 99% of the people who listen to the cell side telling you uninvestable or the 1% who are backing up the truck in the 60s and many of you have benefited from being part of the 1% who are backing up the truck in the 60s with your White Knuckles and all we all had a little bit of White Knuckles but we sucked it up and we knew what we own and we had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet trading at 10 times forward starting a recovery and uh and it&#39;s just beginning so uh same thing is going to happen here uh S&P returns following a 10% correction 12 months out on average up 12% without a recession I think we&#39;re not going to have a recession maybe we get one quarter of negative GDP but uh I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath uh hard data versus soft data so that&#39;s a bullish sign to keep it in mind the real data versus the sentiment is still holding in just fine us okay US versus non- US Stocks have alternated outperformance this I&#39;ve been emphasizing for many months three four months people say us exceptionalism is going to last forever I don&#39;t care if Jesus Christ himself became president in November the odds of us stock performance which has pulled forward a lot of returns in recent years continuing to outperform International would be very unlikely okay so as good or bad as you believe the policies are going to be for the next four years it doesn&#39;t mean that US Stocks have to outperform or underperform it&#39;s just the nature of the cycle okay so like 80 1964 to 1980 9 us was flat International dramatically outperformed 1989 to 2201 us dramatically outperformed International didn&#39;t then you had 20012 2002 to 2008 2009 international small C value outperformed then you&#39;ve had the zero interest rate policy once in a lifetime event from 2010 to 201 you know 22 uh us outperformed and that&#39;s changing now you&#39;re seeing the stimulus coming from China seeing the stimulus coming from Europe that&#39;s where the money is going to flow where there&#39;s liquidity not austerity cutting you know thousands of jobs in Doge which you know look has to be done but there are consequences you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re austere you&#39;re going to attract detract Capital flows if you&#39;re accommodative and stimulative you&#39;re going to attract Capital flows China was austere for 3 years and then they flipped uh uh the switch when they had a bunch of 20% or 25 5-year-olds unemployed and starting social unrest they flipped and now Alibaba doubled okay and it&#39;s going to double again so these things run in Cycles here&#39;s uh auto sales for March blew the doors off Beyond any possible expectations so a little bit of pull forward but you&#39;re starting to get the price cuts which this may be slightly more sustainable than people actually think even with the tariffs why because the oems are going to eat the prices and they&#39;re going to subsidize the losses because they don&#39;t want to lose share in this environment and it\n\nthe odds of us stock performance which has pulled forward a lot of returns in recent years continuing to outperform International would be very unlikely okay so as

they experienced that they thought they would be able to run forever and the the gig is up now it's going to be volumes low prices low margins and suppliers the arms dealers are going to start to win again ADP manufacturing jobs monthly increase so the question from this is is Trump's plan working manufacturing job are growing for the first time in 2 years this doesn't say Wall Street jobs are growing it says manufacturing jobs are growing it doesn't say um White Collar jobs are growing it says everyday jobs are growing and that's a good thing for America so we should be celebrating this not on Twitter whining because your mag7 is 30% down because you couldn't read the writing on the wall uh that was pretty obvious to everyone that that was paying attention 3 four five months ago Wards Automotive US Auto Sales S I mean through the roof we haven't seen a level this High since uh going back to 2017 so let's see if we can maintain it up here because if we can the amount of money that Cooper is going to be spewing out over the next 12 to 24 months is going to be staggering uh tariffs are no tariffs the volumes are going to be through the roof um share repurchases what else do we we have here uh rare moment for Value outperforming growth another thing that we has been a key theme for us okay S&P hit a one-year High last month but closed down more than 5% this month 3 months later you're up on average 6.8% 12 6 months later 15.5% 9 months later 22.1 one year later 25.49 dollar rolling over more of that Bloomberg dollar spot euro is climbing 10-year government bond yield now close to I think it got below four for a minute today I'm not sure but it's definitely at four and uh 5.1% seven-year arm mortgages wait till the 30-year fix hits a 5'9 I've been saying that and if you don't have exposure to the Home Building sector and I'm not talking about buying home builders because they're going to be as screwed as GM and Ford in terms terms of margins I'm talking about the arms dealers the building supply companies the generx of the world the Stanley Black and Deckers of the world the qxo qxo of the world Brad Brad Jacobs Home Building Supply rollups with Beacon Roofing as the platform company okay this is from when the nber recession announcement came as it relates to recessions and then the total return uh uh after up 60 okay if you wait for the robins to sing spring will be over recession start recession end okay so the the nber acknowledges recessions in the rearview mirror by the time they acknowledge a recession the Market's already up on average 6 61% over the next 15 months okay that's that's obvious here are the rate cut probabilities for June have now jumped back up to 80 4% uh tomorrow's jobs report is critical we'll see if that comes in Weak uh or unemployment ticks up which wouldn't be really surprising uh given all the Doge and and um knock on effects of that uh then the fed's back in play and the market starts to probably like the idea of the FED being back in play and maybe you find a short-term bottom here or a bounce corporate America's buyback stalls on tariff uncertainty and also excess capex spend by the way because mag 7 was driving the buyback bus now they're spending it uh uh on unclear return on invested Capital which is why they're down and is crowding out BuyBacks another theme we've been talking about on this podcast Challenger report announced job Cuts uh this is going through the roof so let's see if it's reflected in tomorrow's report quarterly total returns us value stocks minus us growth stocks at the highest levels we've seen since 2001 which kicked off what period of seven years of outperformance of international versus us a a period of uh value over growth and a period of small cap over large cap so coming to a theater near you Equity ETF still seen selling still seeing most almost three billion dollar a day defense spending us has been able to spend less because of Trump's kind of twisting NATO's arm uh Germany's going up UK is going up to meet the requirements of NATO Euphoria Omer that peaked car dealership Guy this is interesting scoop Ford is cutting pricing on most models

quote from America for America campaign dealer cash incentives are on the table for retailers as well will be on the lookout new pricing will be available on Ford dealers websites first thing tomorrow that came out yesterday what does that mean it means volumes follow in incentives as affordability goes up volumes go up as volumes go up Cooper standards free cash flow goes through the roof were we buying Cooper standard today yes we were 10-year yield okay we can see this breaking down it got even lower today so the next level of support is going to be 393 it's going to blow people's mind when

the business this is just the platform company but showing how roofs are not a discretionary expense and the age of the average home and the average commercial property in the US there&#39;s huge amounts of pent up demand for Beacon Roofing and that&#39;s why when Brad Jacobs said on oddlot&#39;s podcast that he&#39;s going to double eida uh he&#39;s going to double eida and then all the businesses he&#39;s going to be able to roll up tuck in and do like he did with XO with Waste Connections and um and it goes through all the details of his past successes and uh and how you have a chance to participate at the very beginning with QX x o we also wanted to talk about that theme as it relates to J and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker what you can see is us existing home sales and gener holdings so when this numberers down the stock goes down when this number goes back up the stock goes back up and this is going to absolutely completely go off the chart when you see a 59 handle with the amount of 80 something million 34 35y old Millennials starting families that want new houses and Trump opening up 500 million Acres of federal land get your 1500 square fot KB Homes starter home along with an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge uh this is going to go through the roof and and when you live in the middle of nowhere you&#39;re definitely going to want a generator because you don&#39;t want to be stuck uh you know with uh endangered polar bears next to your house without power when the power goes out so uh gets windy out in those 500 uh million square miles of rural Western United States so that&#39;s what happens with gener generators that&#39;s what happens with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker DeWalt Stanley Craftsman all the tools used in construction when you see existing home sales Spike up guess what happens to uh this and what causes that to spike up number one is demographics which couldn&#39;t be better number two is affordability which is a function of the cost of capital which Isen right now telling you 5&#39;9 it&#39;s going to be through the roof how many homes are going to be bought and as that construction starts you&#39;re going to start to see new orders come in like crazy and that&#39;s going to happen very very fast and qxo is going to be a beneficiary here&#39;s the here&#39;s another way to looking at it 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 6.32 as it&#39;s ridden what&#39;s collapsed Stanley Black and&amp; Decker as it falls what happens Stanley Black and&amp; Decker rallies as mortgage rates fall same thing will happen with Stanley same thing will happen with gener same thing will happen with qxo and by the time you figure it out it&#39;s too late because they&#39;ve already all doubled so what we&#39;re were were we buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker today you bet your ass we were buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker like it was going out of style were we buying gener today you bet your bottom dollar we were buying gener today so that&#39;s how we do it um\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwhen you live in the middle of nowhere you&#39;re definitely going to want a generator because you don&#39;t want to be stuck

lot of doozies this week from a lot of nervous Nellies out there I&#39;m not undermining that I get it people are nervous but if you&#39;re not on Leverage and know it&#39;s your own there&#39;s no reason to be nervous you should be excited and taken advantage so uh okay this is Johnny s am I missing something here retails are getting hammered today because of Vietnam tariffs where a lot of clothes are made as we saw with VF Corp is 15% move it to Bangladesh call it a day um and you would think that if people are buying fewer clothes that actually benefit from companies like Etsy and depop blah blah blah yeah etsy&#39;s fine etsy&#39;s fine we bought some yesterday today it was actually was it yesterday I don&#39;t know two days ago it was down to 46 then it rallied to 49 on the tariffs and today was 4 it doesn&#39;t matter under $50 we a buyer they&#39;re buying in stock they&#39;re generating a ton of cash they&#39;ll continue to generate a ton of cash no you&#39;re not missing anything thanks for sending the question uh next one is from Kyle CA KU C kta love your show and critically inform informative content you provide I&#39;m bullish on Stanley Black and&amp; Decker wondering the Tariff implications on the share price blah blah blah look at the end of the day they&#39;re getting tariffed so is their competition so they&#39;re the biggest game in town they have the best tools if you think someone&#39;s going to stand up a brand new tool company that&#39;s going to compete with the Walt when generations of Builders their dad their son their Uncle their brother that have been building houses for 100 years use DeWalt and use Craftsman and use Stanley and use black and&amp; Decker you think they&#39;re going to come up with some generic that no one can trust to build these 3.8 new million houses next to the endangered species that Trump wants to open up the Federal lands for you&#39;re out of your mind Stanley&#39;s gonna crush it tariffs no tariffs if they&#39;ll raise the price of the Hammer by 50 Cents call it these these Builders are going to be making so much money they&#39;re they&#39;re not even going to be able to carry all the money into the store to buy all the tools from building 3.8 million houses over the next 3 to 5 years and and building and and they still won&#39;t be able to stop up all the pent up demand for starter homes these are not going to be 4,500 foot homes and 6,000 you don&#39;t need an indoor pool as your first starter home you just need a beautiful new house with all your William Sonoma stuff and and call it a day okay and the people building it are going to use these incredible tools and they&#39;re going to stick a generator outside so when your power goes out and you live in the middle of nowhere you don&#39;t have to worry about bears climing climbing in through your chimney Zack Hong Mr Hayes I was just wondering if you were looking to pick up shares of BFC yes we were doing that today what were you doing I hope you were not cowered underneath your desk I hope you were able to take advantage Could It Go lower in the next few days sure they make 15% of their stuff in Vietnam God forbid they move a few products to Bangladesh or wherever else they&#39;re going to figure it out it&#39;s Brack and Daryl this guy had a 28 bagger selling webcams not curing cancer he&#39;s going to fix it I have absolutely no problem with Brack and Daryl by the way uh where did I put that oh I want to cover I didn&#39;t get a chance to do my favorite thing which is zooming out and getting you guys to see that as noisy as this week has been um it&#39;s it&#39;s literally no big deal look here are some names that we&#39;ve talked about on the podcast okay so here&#39;s advaned Auto Parts okay it&#39;s going back it&#39;s retesting it&#39;s doing this it&#39;s going to be fine Shane O Kelly&#39;s got it under control it was lower last month now it&#39;s going to recover as this noise blows through uh albamar I love Alam Maro were we buying some AAP and Alam Maro today you bet your bottom dollar Alabam Maro is going to be a Nob brainer the global EV count is going up 100 million over the next four five years it&#39;s all going to be from China&#39;s subsidies we they&#39;re the largest player in town $3.5 billion of liquidity lithium prices are cyclical they&#39;re going to score this is a monster I mean you look at this stuff day-to-day Boeing this is unbelievable opportunity to buy this given given the situation who else is going to make the planes it&#39;s a duopoly guys step back and think Baba it&#39;s got to consolidate the thing more than doubled in like five months let it just consolidate its gains and then we&#39;ll take the next leg higher chill chill ax Baxter is g to be fine they own the IV space they own that little area they got rid of the kidney business you can&#39;t even see this move on the chart it&#39;s been building a bottom for two years because that&#39;s how long it takes to build a bottom it&#39;s no different than any other time uh CCI has been up it shot up from 90 to 170 the last couple weeks why because of rates so this things just getting started they got rid of the CEO they sold off the uh High Capital intensive low return fiber business and now they&#39;ve got the the towers that just meant money this is going to continue to go higher and going to continue to pay you a beautiful dividend while you wait Cooper standard shockingly hasn&#39;t even been affected by this I mean it&#39;s been stuck in this range for basically two years and what we&#39;re seeing with the car volumes the cash is going to spew out it&#39;s going to surprise everyone and this thing will be over 20 in no time and then start to really work on some of the numbers we talked about with our beautiful interview with the CEO Jeff Edwards two weeks ago check that out at uh go to YouTube Type in hedge fund tips look for the interview with Jeff Ed Edwards uh also known as episode 283 of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes Comstock resource has taking a break it&#39;s it&#39;s shot up from eight bucks to 20 bucks so now it&#39;s going to rest for a little while before move to over 50 bucks and intrinsic value in hanesville diio is actually up today uh now that the tariffs are kind of like we know what it is it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy it has to be known policy and that uncertainty has been taken out I I like this we bought a couple shares today uh Disney I we didn&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna have another chance to buy again another stock two two years building a base it will be back up it will work its way to new highs over the next three years uh We&#39;ve covered all the reasons Etsy was up in the last month so I think there to to your point on the the thing generating half billion dollars of free cash buying back stock getting growth in some of the newer platforms figuring out the older platforms with rewards and some of the basic stuff generra it does this every single time you get the recovery then you get the fake out and the retest and you just climb the wall of worry higher and higher and higher why because they basically have a monopoly in the space then you&#39;ve got gxo just doing this bottoming process they will be fine hormell is rallying because why people like spam more this month than they like last one no because everyone&#39;s nervous and they buy staples when they&#39;re nervous this will be fine everyone loves spam Planters peanuts all the protein snacks that people need while they take their glp ones Intel we&#39;ve gone through a million times I mean this you can&#39;t even see what&#39;s happened literally you cannot see what&#39;s happened in the last two months on these charts and everyone is like the world is ending no it&#39;s just it&#39;s putting in its bottom that&#39;s what they do that&#39;s why they call me turnaround Tom it&#39;s because I have an ice in my veins when these things are happening while everyone else is panicking we&#39;re just chill as a cucumber and that&#39;s why people give me their money to manage because they don&#39;t want to have to have ice in their veins they want to run their own businesses they want to get on their private plane and go to the beach and go ski in the Alps and go to Mexico and do all the fun things they would do and pay me to worry about it and that&#39;s what I love to do I love pressure I can&#39;t live without pressure it makes me so happy that&#39;s probably why I took up golf all right Intel that we covered that PayPal okay cash machine okay so the EU threatening tariffs all that stuff look they could tariff them 100% PayPal is generating so much cash they&#39;re going to be fine with or without the EU and chances are it&#39;s will be much better than advertised Stanley Black and Decker okay you could actually see this one on the chart it&#39;s it&#39;s corrected a little bit in the last couple of months but it&#39;s no different than what you saw in when 2001 it scares everyone out of the stock before it goes back and retests new highs new highs in this case would be 195 198 8 the stock is $64 these are the normal bottoming fake outs when everyone&#39;s scared and here we are we&#39;re probably right around here maybe we shoot all the way down to 60 or 50 which would be absolutely incredible that would make my day and then boom straight up to 190 uh but my guess is we&#39;re probably there at the moment but this is how bottoms are made you always sh take out the lows get every last week sister out and then you just take up to new highs when you have a business that has a moat we&#39;re not talking about some garbage business you know Chinese micro cap that has good-looking numbers on paper and three years from now winds up being a fraud uh here VF Corp well does this look a lot like when 2001 completely collapsed okay then took a little while to put in a bottom rallied like crazy got everyone excited just like we shot up to 25 couldn&#39;t give it away at 15 everyone wanted it at 25 and was super excited and then what they pull the rug out and they go back and test the lows before they go all the way back up to 2x their recent highs which would be $160 I&#39;m not saying we&#39;re going to $160 I&#39;m saying chillax bracken&#39;s got the wheel man you hire the right managers he&#39;s gonna figure it out he&#39;s a winner okay nothing to worry about there xbi this thing is doing what we see every single time you bottom you retest then you start to go up scare everyone one last time and then you go straight up parabolic and leave everyone in the dust just like we saw with Baba same thing&#39;s coming to it theater near you it just happens to be called xbi biotech next question is that Jason yeah okay so how do I delete this there we go next Clint Murray uh WSM William Sonoma putting it on my radar yeah look that&#39;s another housing play so let&#39;s take a look at what&#39;s happening with the fundamentals on William Sonoma from Clint Murray yeah I don&#39;t know if this has come down enough ladies and Gentlemen let&#39;s take a look at the financials I think it might I think I think you might be a little early on this one buddy um willing to be wrong on that but for me probably pass AO let&#39;s take a look at the financials WSM all right so cash flow is actually rolling over is this yeah I don&#39;t like that and price is starting to follow that I I don&#39;t like the trend their margins seem better revenues are still weak look could it recover I I would just rather see um a greater margin of safety I&#39;d like it to come down a lot more than that or start to see the cash flow go up before I get interested because even if the cash flow goes up the price should lag it for a while just like it lagged it on the way down cash flow was falling price kept going up will start to go up price will keep going down and then I&#39;d be more interested in that um so for that reason I understand what you&#39;re saying it should benefit from the uh housing theme but not ready Linda Williams was wondering if you thought Restoration Hardware uh same theme I think too early for me and too rich for me uh they got a restaurant here uh in Newport Beach down the road that looks awesome I&#39;m G to go there um you might be getting close but you know starter homes is going to be the name of the game here and Restoration Hardware caters to older people with money and those people are downsizing not upsizing I I never like this name at all as a matter of fact the first day I was on um Fox Business late 2009 19 it had been on this parabolic run right here and I wanted to talk to me about it and it&#39;s the last stock I wanted to own it was trading at like I don&#39;t know what it was 150 times earnings and 50 times sales or some ridiculous thing it was literally like right here and I&#39;m like yeah this is not for me and you know little did I know two months later would be covid and the thing you know collapsed 66% but back here when they had me on everyone wanted it which is why they wanted me to talk about it and it was really hard because I didn&#39;t want to poo poo it because everyone was so excited about it and it was my first time on TV um so that&#39;s that long story short it went well enough they invited me back on and uh and that&#39;s that uh and their cash flow is negative so hard pass until I start to see positive free cash flow recovery next one comes from Thomas bar if dswl Were Us stock would you buy it I don&#39;t know what that has to do with it but um considering my biggest position in my portfolio is international but dswl overiew uh based in maau so this is like a Chinese company no if it were a US company would I buy it uh no I mean they have no Revenue growth see cash flow this is this is a this is even too tiny for me in the US probably uh what&#39;s the balance sheet look like all right clean balance sheet uh just you know what&#39;s the turnaround plan how they going to re accelerate revenues I mean this thing&#39;s had a huge move it&#39;s up 4X off the 2016 lows so what&#39;s the growth story moving forward I think they&#39;re higher and better uses of your Capital but thanks for sending it in uh Jason Zen normally don&#39;t dabble in rumors but this one&#39;s too good to pass on the heels of the BMW Alibaba AI partnership last week for the Chinese auto market rumors are now circulating that Tesla&#39;s planning to partner with AI with Alibaba to leverage their cloud data center assets for full self-driving training this makes Baba a player on both AI fronts the generative AI front with their llms for BMW and the physical AI front in hosting GPU clusters cheers Jason so what&#39;s your question Jason um his question is can I get a pat on the back for buying it in the hole when you were backing up the truck at 60 and the answer is of course you can get a pat on the back Jason I know you&#39;ve been buying in the whole hand over fist and you are smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways well that&#39;s what you get for supporting hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes we&#39;re very grateful for your support manique bojani enjoyed your response to Gold question on cgtn interview ah thank you very much thank you for tuning in and thank you for all your support Lou Dumont uh thanks for your great teachings what is your view on AIC American Coastal Insurance Corporation uh no look insurance is cyclical I know all the insurance uh Brokers on the phone are going to tell me this time&#39;s different prices are going to stay high forever but I remember being an analyst when I in 2009 and I&#39;d go to all the meetings at the New York Society of Securities analysts and they&#39;d have all these insurance companies uh that were just completely decimated and I was a value guy so I wanted him to work and every year they would come and they&#39;d say the same thing so excited prices are going to start hardening it took 10 years so prices have been hard for you know five years all these Insurance guys are making Fortune selling their little brokerages TW two3 million brokerages to private equity for 30 million bucks and getting rich and 100 million bucks and getting rich and um and the Smart Ones are hitting the window because the window won&#39;t last and they&#39;re going to get very rich and um uh hopefully they&#39;re going to be smart to give some of their money to a manager like me to help them out uh and um but price hardening is not going to last forever and I wouldn&#39;t want to be in this space particularly with this company that&#39;s already recovered off its lows so I&#39;m going to pass on that um Rachel D hey Tom why don&#39;t you like Crocs their buyback plan seems like a smart Capital allocation are you seeing something different I&#39;m seeing that shoe companies run in phases and I want to buy the ones that are in the hole right now like Nike and like Vans uh VF Corp over Crocs which is just coming off its heated run um cash flow is good revenues seem to be slowing down uh I think they&#39;re kind of I think they got to got to relax everyone that wants Crocs already has them I mean my kids have them but you know there are only so many swimmers and chefs in the world at the end of the day you run out of chefs and you run out of swimmers and until they come out with something new or the the kids get tired wearing stuff I think it&#39;s going to breathe I would rather buy the ones that you can&#39;t give away and Croc is not there Croc has had a great run uh and they&#39;re probably due for a pause in my opinion um revenues seem to be flatlining which is supportive with that their gross margins have been down since 2022 starting to recover you might be right I&#39;m not going to knock it but it it&#39;s just for me it&#39;s not I look for the fat pitches that I don&#39;t even have to think about and that one&#39;s like H yeah maybe you make 30 40% I I don&#39;t know good luck I think possibly that will happen but it&#39;s got to be at least a double for me or I don&#39;t look at it and I don&#39;t see it in Crocs Tom thank you for all the work that you put into the podcast it&#39;s truly amaging educational for a student like myself question has to do with outperformance European stocks wor the US stimulus consumption short you dollar it&#39;s all of that it&#39;s all the above it&#39;s the stimulus it&#39;s the weak dollar strong foreign currencies that trend is just just beginning uh you&#39;re on your way so long question but you&#39;re generally your premise is correct Christian die thank you for all the work to my young looking Circle please look at Brembo leader in premium breaking system segment in Italy br for maybe but you&#39;re going to really have to know you got to know who their customers are you got to know what their Edge is you got to know it as well if not better than I know Cooper standard and and that&#39;s going to take many many months um free cash flow deteriorating last year balance sheet let&#39;s see balance sheet looks okay looks like they did an acquisition or something there what about the share count pretty decent it&#39;s definitely worth doing the work on um I&#39;ll leave it at that you really have to understand their customers and how well they&#39;re going to be doing if they&#39;re supplying exclusively to European automakers I wouldn&#39;t be interested in it because Europeans are letting the Chinese flood their markets and good luck with that um Henry Griffin how much Excel do you use in your analysis Excel is the language of Finance so you got to learn that stuff you got to take your CFA if you&#39;re new and have no experience that&#39;s a way to get good experience pretty quickly Jimmy Jones if your idea that the mara Lago Accord could recreate another 80s bull market in China as you stated in your last podcast does that change your intrinsic value in that environment would you hold a position longer because because of that situation no I know where I&#39;m getting out before I get in if it gets so much better than I could have anticipated maybe I&#39;ll hold a piece longer than I would have but I know my game I just stay I take the middle out of the sandwich I don&#39;t need the crust David mulinex what do you think of rentokill RTO so it&#39;s down like 40% what do they do pest control services H kind of like that but they&#39;ve had a monster run so you really run the risk here of this being a broken growth stock uh and if that&#39;s the case these things take an awful long time to rebuild so if it doesn&#39;t hold here you&#39;re screwed is really what it comes down to and if it does hold here you probably get a quick 60 70% again it doesn&#39;t meet my double Criterion and especially with the cash flow starting to deteriorate after it&#39;s had such a huge move that&#39;s a pretty big warning side to me sign to me the cash flow is basically back at four year ago levels and the stock is up uh 12x uh not enough margin of safety you might be right but uh that would be a pass easy pass for me question from this guy Warren asking about diio we bought a few shares today I&#39;ll leave it at that diio was actually up today which was kind of interesting so\n\nif they&#39;re supplying exclusively to European automakers I wouldn&#39;t be interested in it because Europeans are letting the Chinese flood their markets and good luck

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nwe got a lot of great stuff to cover this week I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve all had a really fun day uh just kidding\n\nuh last two years when China was getting hammered now you got sneaker companies getting hammered uh and everything else so this is like you know a day like this you know yeah look everyone gets hit by a mark to Market and and people think that matters but these days are like Christmas I mean people could not understand I was talking to the YPO group and they couldn't understand why I was giddy I was like listen I need to get off this call because 11:30 is coming up and the losers in Europe sell at 11:30 because they're chicken littles to go home long and uh and then I need to be around for 230 when the margin clerks hit up the US guys that are levered long on their zero dated options so when they're structurally blown up their account I can buy all the that they're forced to puke by the margin margin clerks and that just comes from experience and that just comes from knowing what you own and owning quality businesses so if the marks went another 10% lower would I be excited about that no I wouldn't be excited about that but would I be worried about that I would not be worried about that because if I look 12 24 36 months out based on the businesses that we own and we've underwritten as if we own the entire company before we even buy one share of stock we are not tracing chasing price we are not doing magical technical analysis like Peter Navaro calling the bottom today because he used to be a CNBC contributor and he's an expert technical analyst commentator uh that's now working a $100,000 job after getting out of jail ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nmagnificent 7 relinquishes more than $1 trillion dollar as Tech Drive stock market nose dive um so look we spent three months saying lien up on mag 7 Canadian dollar climbs to four-month high after tariff reveal ladies it's finally  happened did did the Canadian dollar go against us before it went for us yes but it's now moving up and I think it's going to persist so all the Canadians that are worried and angry at Trump don't worry you're going to be fine okay all the Mexicans you're going to be fine don't worry about it it's going to work itself out uh I'd Bel long L Looney you guys are going to have huge purchasing power over the next 12 to 24 months the Tariff thing will get resolved you have natural resources you're a great country you're a great you got great leaders like Wayne Gretzky I'm joking not joking uh and and you don't need to become a state to be amazing you're already amazing we love you I know we have a lot of Canadian listeners all right let's get\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nlip bhan addressed the Intel Vision 2025 yesterday and he outlined his top priorities focus on engineering Talent particularly tied to dcii uh execute on Panther Lake and iteratively improve yields improve Foundry more details to come expand product portfolio into verticals lean on purpose built silicon as a secular theme desktop software to support AI application layer that is critically important because that is what everyone said was nvidia's mode was they had the software kind of like the app wall Walled Garden this guy is the master of it Cadence designs was the software that all chip designers used to develop when he built that built out that company so now he's going to do it proprietary inside of Intel coupled with The Foundry business this is going to be a legendary turnaround story\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nVF Corp has exposure there 26% of their exposure is Vietnam so 15 only 15 in China I would have thought it's a lot more than I would have thought they were like 80% China so uh that's kind of good news but could they move you know this 26% to Bangladesh where the tariffs are lower sure why not give the Bangladeshi some business\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nif you remember on March 11th I was on vne and Co which I'm going to be no that's the following week never mind um I might be tomorrow morning but everything is in flocks more likely than not I won't be um and I said they should come up with a website and just show item by item how much do they tax Us and how much do we tax them and that's exactly what they did it sounds like Trump and some of his uh advisers watch vanney on Fox Business cuz they laid it out pretty clearly okay what do they tariff us what are we going to tariff them back and in most if not all cases other than the low end at 10% uh it was we came back with about 50% of what they do to us so it's not reciprocal it's not uh that but it's it's in a Direction that's going to generate 600 billion plus which is get get ready for the next phase so he said today in a tweet he said the operation is over now the patient can heal\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nget ready for growth narrative growth narrative being tax cuts deregulation and tariffs in the rearview mirror because that's largely done\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhard and soft data have diverged so this is what's actually happening versus so conference board expecting fewer jobs a lot of people are nervous uh the initial jobless claims are not yet confirming that we will see tomorrow what I will say is critically interesting which we're going to get to is uh fed is now at 85% chance of a cut in June\n### MISCELLANEOUS\njust kind of year to date returns all the last sh be First Healthcare is up at the top International's up at the top Energy's outperformed com Stock's been on a tear uh so we're super happy about that gold is outperformed so all the end of the worlders are super happy congrat rations um just you know not what we do but you know kudos to those people who do that uh equities aggregate in institutional net flows long only have been puking in the hole hedge funds puking in the Hole opinion follows Trend so they were all buying at the top selling in the hole so you know you got to decide what you want to do\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAuto tariffs could reignite used car prices in Auto Repair business that's where Advanced Auto Part start to starts to flourish again\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nweaker and weaker dollar benefits International uh we've been pounding the table and what you've seen in the beginning of this year probably breathe for a little bit but it's just the beginning of a multi- multi-year International versus us outperformance kind of ironic that us Equity exceptionalism will have peaked with the Advent of um the new Administration and I don't think that speaks poorly of the new administration at all and part of it's just the person sitting in the seat uh like I said I think the economy is going to do better than ever and I think the middle class the people who haven't participated in asset price appreciation are going to do better than ever I think passive indexers are going to be less happy I think stock Pickers are going to have the time of their lives\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nvalue versus growth value's been outperforming 23% of stocks beat growth Benchmark beating Russell 1,000 growth index based on trailing 12 months so this is kind of what you see when you want to be a buyer magnificent 7 to lag magnificent 7 magnificent 7 market cap as a percentage of S&P has now dropped from 35% down to 30% boy that was quick\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncoming in global semiconductor sales um we talked about Nvidia in June saying this is a cyclical business I think the one play that's going to be doing well while the rest are suffering is going to be Intel why because every other chip maker depends on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor Intel is going to be a producer of chips not just a designer of chips and they're going to start to take share from Taiwan semiconductor because Trump's going to make sure of it whether he likes Intel or not which I think he will I think he's going to love lip Buu tan and uh as he would say because lip ban is a winner and Trump loves winners so uh expect good things from Intel even if this cycle slows down they're going to be taking share from monopolistic producer Taiwan semiconductor\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nAmerican stocks worth quarter in 23 years relative to International that's been our theme get out of Mag 7 get inter International it all showed up at once in the first quarter\n\n\ngot them out of their monopolistic sell above MSRP covid um uh laa palooza that they experienced that they thought they would be able to run forever and the the gig is up now it's going to be volumes low prices low margins and suppliers the arms dealers are going to start to win again ADP manufacturing jobs monthly increase so the question from this is is Trump's plan working manufacturing job are growing for the first time in 2 years this doesn't say Wall Street jobs are growing it says manufacturing jobs are growing it doesn't say um White Collar jobs are growing it says everyday jobs are growing and that's a good thing for America so we should be celebrating this not on Twitter whining because your mag7 is 30% down because you couldn't read the writing on the wall uh that was pretty obvious to everyone that that was paying attention 3 four five months ago Wards Automotive US Auto Sales S I mean through the roof we haven't seen a level this High since uh going back to 2017 so let's see if we can maintain it up here because if we can the amount of money that Cooper is going to be spewing out over the next 12 to 24 months is going to be staggering uh tariffs are no tariffs the volumes are going to be through the roof um share repurchases what else do we we have here uh rare moment for Value outperforming growth another thing that we has been a key theme for us okay S&P hit a one-year High last month but closed down more than 5% this month 3 months later you're up on average 6.8% 12 6 months later 15.5% 9 months later 22.1 one year later 25.49 dollar rolling over more of that Bloomberg dollar spot euro is climbing 10-year government bond yield now close to I think it got below four for a minute today I'm not sure but it's definitely at four and uh 5.1% seven-year arm mortgages wait till the 30-year fix hits a 5'9 I've been saying that and if you don't have exposure to the Home Building sector and I'm not talking about buying home builders because they're going to be as screwed as GM and Ford in terms terms of margins I'm talking about the arms dealers the building supply companies the generx of the world the Stanley Black and Deckers of the world the qxo qxo of the world Brad Brad Jacobs Home Building Supply rollups with Beacon Roofing as the platform company okay this is from when the nber recession announcement came as it relates to recessions and then the total return uh uh after up 60 okay if you wait for the robins to sing spring will be over recession start recession end okay so the the nber acknowledges recessions in the rearview mirror by the time they acknowledge a recession the Market's already up on average 6 61% over the next 15 months okay that's that's obvious here are the rate cut probabilities for June have now jumped back up to 80 4% uh tomorrow's jobs report is critical we'll see if that comes in Weak uh or unemployment ticks up which wouldn't be really surprising uh given all the Doge and and um knock on effects of that uh then the fed's back in play and the market starts to probably like the idea of the FED being back in play and maybe you find a short-term bottom here or a bounce corporate America's buyback stalls on tariff uncertainty and also excess capex spend by the way because mag 7 was driving the buyback bus now they're spending it uh uh on unclear return on invested Capital which is why they're down and is crowding out BuyBacks another theme we've been talking about on this podcast Challenger report announced job Cuts uh this is going through the roof so let's see if it's reflected in tomorrow's report quarterly total returns us value stocks minus us growth stocks at the highest levels we've seen since 2001 which kicked off what period of seven years of outperformance of international versus us a a period of uh value over growth and a period of small cap over large cap so coming to a theater near you Equity ETF still seen selling still seeing most almost three billion dollar a day defense spending us has been able to spend less because of Trump's kind of twisting NATO's arm uh Germany's going up UK is going up to meet the requirements of NATO Euphoria Omer that peaked car dealership Guy this is interesting scoop Ford is cutting pricing on most models unlike a few oems who are raising prices in light of impending tariffs through June 2nd carb buyers can take advantage of special employee pricing on eligible Ford and Lincoln vehicles through the new quote from America for America campaign dealer cash incentives are on the table for retailers as well will be on the lookout new pricing will be available on Ford dealers websites first thing tomorrow that came out yesterday what does that mean it means volumes follow in incentives as affordability goes up volumes go up as volumes go up Cooper standards free cash flow goes through the roof were we buying Cooper standard today yes we were 10-year yield okay we can see this breaking down it got even lower today so the next level of support is going to be 393 it's going to blow people's mind when it has the three handle for a few days uh it's coming value is still underweight despite the outperformance which is the same thing that you saw in the early 2000s then they got overweight by the time it peak in 20 2007 values uh dramatically underweight this is what you see in the early stages of a regime change China exports to consumption re reorientation so uh their exports have come down from 35% to 20 their consumption is starting to recover from 5% to now 39% and their goal is to make it 7 % uh Alibaba I think gets 40 cents on every dollar spent on consumption they get a toll through uh because of the amount of e-commerce that's done in China so we are going to benefit from that Trend Chinese stock investors flock to Hong Kong to bargain hunt alibaba's quen 3 remember how amazing 2.5 was better than chat GPT

so much stimulus is now coming in Germany stimulus is in Europe stimulus is international austerity us it's necessary but it's just what it is and money will go where it's treated best and right now treated best in China and in in and in international and not in the US because why because Trump had to clean up a lot of messes from Decades of neglect and it's just you know we got to take a little

MISCELLANEOUS\nstock market and sentiment results  uh so this is an update on qxo and the Beacon Roofing deal um Jeff did a good job going through the Dynamics of the business this is just the platform company but showing how roofs are not a discretionary expense and the age of the average home and the average commercial property in the US there&#39;s huge amounts of pent up demand for Beacon Roofing and that&#39;s why when Brad Jacobs said on oddlot&#39;s podcast that he&#39;s going to double eida uh he&#39;s going to double eida and then all the businesses he&#39;s going to be able to roll up tuck in and do like he did with XO with Waste Connections and um and it goes through all the details of his past successes and uh and how you have a chance to participate at the very beginning with QX x o we also wanted to talk about that theme as it relates to J and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker what you can see is us existing home sales and gener holdings so when this numberers down the stock goes down when this number goes back up the stock goes back up and this is going to absolutely completely go off the chart when you see a 59 handle with the amount of 80 something million 34 35y old Millennials starting families that want new houses and Trump opening up 500 million Acres of federal land get your 1500 square fot KB Homes starter home along with an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge uh this is going to go through the roof and and when you live in the middle of nowhere you&#39;re definitely going to want a generator because you don&#39;t want to be stuck uh you know with uh endangered polar bears next to your house without power when the power goes out so uh gets windy out in those 500 uh million square miles of rural Western United States so that&#39;s what happens with gener generators that&#39;s what happens with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker DeWalt Stanley Craftsman all the tools used in construction when you see existing home sales Spike up guess what happens to uh this and what causes that to spike up number one is demographics which couldn&#39;t be better number two is affordability which is a function of the cost of capital which Isen right now telling you 5&#39;9 it&#39;s going to be through the roof how many homes are going to be bought and as that construction starts you&#39;re going to start to see new orders come in like crazy and that&#39;s going to happen very very fast and qxo is going to be a beneficiary here&#39;s the here&#39;s another way to looking at it 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 6.32 as it&#39;s ridden what&#39;s collapsed Stanley Black and&amp; Decker as it falls what happens Stanley Black and&amp; Decker rallies as mortgage rates fall same thing will happen with Stanley same thing will happen with gener same thing will happen with qxo and by the time you figure it out it&#39;s too late because they&#39;ve already all doubled so what we&#39;re were were we buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker today you bet your ass we were buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker like it was going out of style were we buying gener today you bet your bottom dollar we were buying gener today so that&#39;s how we do it um",

more than I would have thought they were like 80% China so uh that's kind of good news but could they move you know this 26% to Bangladesh where the tariffs are lower sure why not give the Bangladeshi some business\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nif you remember on March 11th I was on vne and Co which I'm going to be no that's the following week never mind um I might be tomorrow morning but everything is in flocks more likely than not I won't be um and I said they should come up with a website and just show item by item how much do they tax Us and how much do we tax them and that's exactly what they did it sounds like Trump and some of his uh advisers watch vanney on Fox Business cuz they laid it out pretty clearly okay what do they tariff us what are we going to tariff them back and in most if not all cases other than the low end at 10% uh it was we came back with about 50% of what they do to us so it's not reciprocal it's not uh that but it's it's in a Direction that's going to generate

you've seen in the beginning of this year probably breathe for a little bit but it's just the beginning of a multi- multi-year International versus us outperformance kind of ironic that us Equity exceptionalism will have peaked with the Advent of um the new Administration and I don't think that speaks poorly of the new administration at all and part of it's just the person sitting in the seat uh like I said I think the economy is going to do better than ever and I think the middle class the people who haven't participated in asset price appreciation are going to do better than ever I think passive indexers are going to be less happy I think stock Pickers are going to have the time of their lives\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nvalue versus growth value's been outperforming 23% of stocks beat

cyclical business I think the one play that's going to be doing well while the rest are suffering is going to be Intel why because every other chip maker depends on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor Intel is going to be a producer of chips not just a designer of chips and they're going to start to take share from Taiwan semiconductor because Trump's going to make sure of it whether he likes Intel or not which I think he will I think he's going to love lip Buu tan and uh as he would say because lip ban is a winner and Trump loves winners so uh expect good things from Intel even if this cycle slows down they're going to be taking share from monopolistic producer Taiwan semiconductor\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nAmerican stocks worth quarter in 23 years relative to International that's been our theme get out of Mag 7 get inter International it all showed up at once in the first quarter\n\n\nthe odds of us stock performance which has pulled forward a lot of returns in recent years continuing to outperform International would be very unlikely okay so as good or bad as you believe the policies are going to be for the next four years it doesn&#39;t mean that US Stocks have to outperform or underperform it&#39;s just the nature of the cycle okay so like 80 1964 to 1980 9 us was flat International dramatically outperformed 1989 to 2201 us dramatically outperformed International didn&#39;t then you had 20012 2002 to 2008 2009 international small C value outperformed then you&#39;ve had the zero interest rate policy once in a lifetime event from 2010 to 201 you know 22 uh us outperformed and that&#39;s changing now you&#39;re seeing the stimulus coming from China seeing the stimulus coming from Europe that&#39;s where the money is going to flow where there&#39;s liquidity not austerity cutting you know thousands of jobs in Doge which you know look has to be done but there are consequences you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re austere you&#39;re going to attract detract Capital flows if you&#39;re accommodative and stimulative you&#39;re going to attract Capital flows China was austere for 3 years and then they flipped uh uh the switch when they had a bunch of 20% or 25 5-year-olds unemployed and starting social unrest they flipped and now Alibaba doubled okay and it&#39;s going to double again so these things run in Cycles here&#39;s uh auto sales for March blew the doors off Beyond any possible expectations so a little bit of pull forward but you&#39;re starting to get the price cuts which this may be slightly more sustainable than people actually think even with the tariffs why because the oems are going to eat the prices and they&#39;re going to subsidize the losses because they don&#39;t want to lose share in this environment and it\n\ngot them out of their monopolistic sell above MSRP covid um uh laa palooza that they experienced that they thought they would be able to run forever and the the gig is up now it's going to be volumes low prices low margins and suppliers the arms dealers are going to start to win again ADP manufacturing jobs monthly increase so the question from this is is Trump's plan working manufacturing job are growing for the first time in 2 years this doesn't say Wall Street jobs are growing it says manufacturing jobs are growing it doesn't say um White Collar jobs are growing it says everyday jobs are growing and that's a good thing for America so we should be celebrating this not on Twitter whining because your mag7 is 30% down because you couldn't read the writing on the wall uh that was pretty obvious to everyone that that was paying attention 3 four five months ago Wards Automotive US Auto Sales S I mean through the roof we haven't seen a level this High since uh going back to 2017 so let's see if we can maintain it up here because if we can the amount of money that Cooper is going to be spewing out over the next 12 to 24 months is going to be staggering uh tariffs are no tariffs the volumes are going to be through the roof um share repurchases what else do we we have here uh rare moment for Value outperforming growth another thing that we has been a key theme for us okay S&P hit a one-year High last month but closed down more than 5% this month 3 months later you're up on average 6.8% 12 6 months later 15.5% 9 months later 22.1 one year later 25.49 dollar rolling over more of that Bloomberg dollar spot euro is climbing 10-year government bond yield now close to I think it got below four for a minute today I'm not sure but it's definitely at four and uh 5.1% seven-year arm mortgages wait till the 30-year fix hits a 5'9 I've been saying that and if you don't have exposure to the Home Building sector and I'm not talking about buying home builders because they're going to be as screwed as GM and Ford in terms terms of margins I'm talking about the arms dealers the building supply companies the generx of the world the Stanley Black and Deckers of the world the qxo qxo of the world Brad Brad Jacobs Home Building Supply rollups with Beacon Roofing as the platform company okay this is from when the nber recession announcement came as it relates to recessions and then the total return uh uh after up 60 okay if you wait for the robins to sing spring will be over recession start recession end okay so the the nber acknowledges recessions in the rearview mirror by the time they acknowledge a recession the Market's already up on average 6 61% over the next 15 months okay that's that's obvious here are the rate cut probabilities for June have now jumped back up to 80 4% uh tomorrow's jobs report is critical we'll see if that comes in Weak uh or unemployment ticks up which wouldn't be really surprising uh given all the Doge and and um knock on effects of that uh then the fed's back in play and the market starts to probably like the idea of the FED being back in play and maybe you find a short-term bottom here or a bounce corporate America's buyback stalls on tariff uncertainty and also excess capex spend by the way because mag 7 was driving the buyback bus now they're spending it uh uh on unclear return on invested Capital which is why they're down and is crowding out BuyBacks another theme we've been talking about on this podcast Challenger report announced job Cuts uh this is going through the roof so let's see if it's reflected in tomorrow's report quarterly total returns us value stocks minus us growth stocks at the highest levels we've seen since 2001 which kicked off what period of seven years of outperformance of international versus us a a period of uh value over growth and a period of small cap over large cap so coming to a theater near you Equity ETF still seen selling still seeing most almost three billion dollar a day defense spending us has been able to spend less because of Trump's kind of twisting NATO's arm uh Germany's going up UK is going up to meet the

are on the table for retailers as well will be on the lookout new pricing will be available on Ford dealers websites first thing tomorrow that came out yesterday what does that mean it means volumes follow in incentives as affordability goes up volumes go up as volumes go up Cooper standards free cash flow goes through the roof were we buying Cooper standard today yes we were 10-year yield okay we can see this breaking down it got even lower today so the next level of support is going to be 393 it's going to blow people's mind when it has the three handle for a few days uh it's coming value is still underweight despite the outperformance which is the same thing that you saw in the early 2000s then they got overweight by the time it peak in 20 2007 values uh dramatically underweight this is what you see in the early stages of a regime change China exports to consumption re reorientation so uh their exports have come down from 35% to 20 their consumption is starting to recover from 5% to now 39% and their goal is to make it 7 % uh Alibaba I think gets 40 cents on every dollar spent on consumption they get a toll through uh because of the amount of e-commerce that's done in China so we are going to benefit from that Trend Chinese stock investors flock to Hong Kong to bargain hunt alibaba's quen 3 remember how amazing 2.5 was better than chat GPT uh better than deep seek Etc well

Germany stimulus is in Europe stimulus is international austerity us it's necessary but it's just what it is and money will go where it's treated best and right now treated best in China and in in and in international and not in the US because why because Trump had to clean up a lot of messes from Decades of neglect and it's just you know we got to take a little medicine here and that's why the mag

results  uh so this is an update on qxo and the Beacon Roofing deal um Jeff did a good job going through the Dynamics of the business this is just the platform company but showing how roofs are not a discretionary expense and the age of the average home and the average commercial property in the US there&#39;s huge amounts of pent up demand for Beacon Roofing and that&#39;s why when Brad Jacobs said on oddlot&#39;s podcast that he&#39;s going to double eida uh he&#39;s going to double eida and then all the businesses he&#39;s going to be able to roll up tuck in and do like he did with XO with Waste Connections and um and it goes through all the details of his past successes and uh and how you have a chance to participate at the very beginning with QX x o we also wanted to talk about that theme as it relates to J and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker what you can see is us existing home sales and gener holdings so when this numberers down the stock goes down when this number goes back up the stock goes back up and this is going to absolutely completely go off the chart when you see a 59 handle with the amount of 80 something million 34 35y old Millennials starting families that want new houses and Trump opening up 500 million Acres of federal land get your 1500 square fot KB Homes starter home along with an endangered elk in your backyard free of charge uh this is going to go through the roof and and when you live in the middle of nowhere you&#39;re definitely going to want a generator because you don&#39;t want to be stuck uh you know with uh endangered polar bears next to your house without power when the power goes out so uh gets windy out in those 500 uh million square miles of rural Western United States so that&#39;s what happens with gener generators that&#39;s what happens with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker DeWalt Stanley Craftsman all the tools used in construction when you see existing home sales Spike up guess what happens to uh this and what causes that to spike up number one is demographics which couldn&#39;t be better number two is affordability which is a function of the cost of capital which Isen right now telling you 5&#39;9 it&#39;s going to be through the roof how many homes are going to be bought and as that construction starts you&#39;re going to start to see new orders come in like crazy and that&#39;s going to happen very very fast and qxo is going to be a beneficiary here&#39;s the here&#39;s another way to looking at it 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 6.32 as it&#39;s ridden what&#39;s collapsed Stanley Black and&amp; Decker as it falls what happens Stanley Black and&amp; Decker rallies as mortgage rates fall same thing will happen with Stanley same thing will happen with gener same thing will happen with qxo and by the time you figure it out it&#39;s too late because they&#39;ve already all doubled so what we&#39;re were were we buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker today you bet your ass we were buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker like it was going out of style were we buying gener today you bet your bottom dollar we were buying gener today so that&#39;s how we do it um",

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\nhad the pleasure to join Karina Mitchell uh also want to thank uh Bruno for having me on cgtn America and um that&#39;s Bruno feldberg and this was going into the announcement which you know came out uh kind of worse than most people expected in terms of the um uh bite in the tariffs and we&#39;re going to talk a lot about that today and how we can take advantage of the opportunity that it created but let&#39;s listen in we off to a 10 start to the second quarter of 2025 to put it mildly let&#39;s get some new insight into how markets and the economy are holding up amid all of the Tariff Tantrums Thomas Hayes joins us for that he&#39;s a Founder chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas thanks for coming on thanks for having me Karina so Thomas tell me first of all what do you make of Market Market reaction today ahead of these tariffs what&#39;s it signaling to you about just how much investors actually believe Trump follows through on all of these grandiose tariff pledges reports are 20% on a broad range of imports but nothing&#39;s firm yet well this might be the most telegraphed quote unquote surprise in the history of stock markets I think a lot of the bad news is already priced in and as Warren Buffett says when be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy and right now people are super fearful as a matter of fact if you look at the a aii bearish sentiment indicator of retail investors it&#39;s the most pessimistic since the tech wreck in 2022 and more pessimistic than the lows of covid and the lows of the great financial crisis so if you&#39;re not looking for opportunities in times like these with high quality businesses when they&#39;re marked down when are you going to look for them you know we say on Wall Street it&#39;s the only Market you can go when they hold a clearance sale no one shows up to buy yeah so you say you know buy the dip look for the bargains now stay ahead of the curb if he actually does follow through could you tell me if so if these tariffs stick for any period of time what does that do to stocks and to the economy well look it it&#39;s a onetime level up okay and right now based on how the market performed in the first quarter with the US underperforming International Stocks by the widest margin in over two decades S&amp;P down about 5% International of about 8% uh a lot of the worst case is priced in so you have a level up in prices but at the end of the day how many of these businesses are going to stand up factories in the US for three and a half years and spend tens of billions of dollars to do so the products that they provide will still be in demand they&#39;ll have to get it they&#39;ll have you know some will get passed through the consumer some will be uh shared by the manufacturers and the suppliers but at the end of the day it&#39;s a one time it&#39;s not 20% compounded at 10% per year it&#39;s 20% one time and the market will digest it in a matter of weeks and you can use that opportunity and that volatility to buy high quality companies for the long term it&#39;s not the case that tariffs come in and every business goes out of out of business because someone new starts up in the United States not what&#39;s going to happen what&#39;s going to happen is uh there&#39;ll be some short-term friction and long-term reward welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0 new day new headline new volatility resolves higher over time so you&#39;re saying everybody should just take a breath but you know GDP for the first quarter is not going to come in anywhere near the 2.4% we saw in Q4 some say we can actually see a contraction because of all of this tariff volatility do you think we need to work worry about a recession no I don&#39;t think we do need to worry about a recession at this point the numbers that you&#39;re seeing as far as Atlanta G GDP now are noisy because of inventories and some pull forwards and and related to the uncertainty of policy but this happens every four years you have uncertainty in the first quarter with a new Administration it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy it has to be known policy and what the market grappled with in the first quarter was unknown policy and we&#39;re to get greater resolution and you could find in the next few days or the next couple of weeks this is a clearing event whether it turns out positive or negative at least we&#39;ll know what the rules of the game are and we can adjust accordingly and that&#39;s what Wall Street wants to see so you&#39;re saying you know it&#39;s been a miserable first quarter by all accounts all the major averages lower flirting or in correction inflation creeping higher so what do you actually anticipate seeing with stocks near term and then midterm as well well look I think the theme that we came into the year worth with is going to continue and the theme that we came in was you want to be buying International stocks particularly China Tech our largest position that we&#39;ve built up over the last year and a half has been Alibaba uh we think that&#39;s going to continue to outperform we think International stocks are going to continue to outperform as the dollar weekends mag 7 would underperform due to increased capb backs and lower earnings power decelerating earnings I think we&#39;re at the point now where enough of those stocks are oversold that you could see a bounce in mag 7 in the coming quarter but I do think it&#39;s going to stay in that range even if it trades back up to the top of the range I do think Mag s will underperform I do think International stocks will outperform domestic stocks this year and that&#39;s where your opportunity is going to be so if you&#39;re a Trader maybe take a punt on some of these tech stocks if you&#39;re an investor start buying Industrials everything that&#39;s perceived to be affected by tariffs that has been marked down this is a perfect example Karina instead of buy the rumor sell the news this is a sell the rumor bu the news sell the rumor of tariffs buy it when it&#39;s actually announced and I think we&#39;re going to have opportunities here into Q2 and Beyond guidance has been taken down materially in q1 that&#39;s the normal game every year first quarter CEOs give conservative guidance so they can beat in the subsequent three quarters get their bonuses get their options shareholders are happy and this year will be no different I love that you&#39;re talking about International stocks there as well because Nvidia down 21% year to date Tesla down 28% year to date tell me quickly where do you stand on gold where do you see that going I have no view on gold as it yields no cash uh I like businesses that generate free cash flow that I can measure that are growing that are high quality durable businesses gold is just a bet on who&#39;s going to come in after you and buy it at a higher price and that I&#39;ll leave that game for other people okay we&#39;ll see how it all shakes out on Liberation day Thomas Hayes thanks so much for coming on thank you Karina and still in here and we&#39;re back and then uh and by the way not much of that changes even though the facts somewhat changed and we&#39;re going to go through why so first and foremost this just came in after the Clos today Trump tariff live updates president Trump says he&#39;s open into negotiations contradicting wh White House AIDS like um Peter Navaro and others and um uh so that&#39;s that the other thing I wanted to do is step back and put things in perspective here I just kind of said $600 billion okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s say this is a number what&#39;s the number so what is everyone afraid of well the stock market is comprised the name of the game with the stock market is called earnings okay and so I pulled this up and I found out what is the aggregate net income meaning the earnings power of the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 months and it came out to 1.9 trillion okay 1.9 trillion on uh I think it&#39;s about 19 trillion 7 trillion of Revenue and 19 1.9 trillion of net income so you could say okay we have a problem Houston we have a problem uh number one is if the S&amp;P 500 companies number one they&#39;re not 100% % of the companies in America so let&#39;s just assume they&#39;re half so that means it would be a $300 billion if they assumed all of the loss they passed nothing on to suppliers they passed nothing onto customers and they just said well we&#39;re going to be a benevolent uh company uh we&#39;re going to actually switch the opposite of chat GPT we&#39;re going to go from being a for-profit to a nonprofit and we&#39;ll just eat all of these tariffs rather than pass it on to Consumers uh you&#39;re basically looking at you know 300 billion of two trillion so you know you you start to get into 15% of earnings give or take that&#39;s if they assume all of the pain all of the time 15% of earnings well last I checked the S&amp;P 500 I believe is down give or take 12% is that correct maybe more today let&#39;s pull it up okay so you&#39;re effectively at the worst case scenario meaning the Market&#39;s down 15% and earnings are down 15% okay so year to date okay so it was 3.39 yesterday and it dropped 5% today so you got give or take nine it dropped a total of 10 or 11% was in kind of Correction territory this morning so give or take 10% 11% and you&#39;ve got 15% of earnings now number one I&#39;ve probably overestimated the percentage of the 600 billion that&#39;s attributed to public companies versus private companies um and number two I&#39;ve have 100% overestimated the amount that the companies are actually going to eat um this is effectively there&#39;s no other way to say it this is a tax on the poor okay now ultimately in the short term because it&#39;s not you know whatever it is 20 plus% compounded at 10% a year it&#39;s a one time level up so it&#39;s a one time tax on the poor why do I say tax on the poor because the average uh you know a lot of people don&#39;t feel a dollar in milk or you know a dollar per gallon in gas and a lot of people do but the people who do are the people who are going to feel it the most so this is going to hurt them the most in the short term in the longer term I do think this is going to be much better for labor than it is for Capital uh meaning the people doing real jobs are going to be uh proportionately gaining a lot more than the people managing assets uh and that&#39;s a good thing and that&#39;s what we saw in the first term of trump 1.0 real wages at the salari level increased by the the most for uh across all demographics uh but particularly the low-end and the middle end got the biggest bump uh uh minorities got the biggest bump and I think that&#39;s a great thing for America and I think that&#39;s going to be the result that happens out of this so but since we&#39;re on a stock market podcast and um uh we we want to make money in the stock market what we have to do is out of every crisis comes opportunity and take advantage of these opportunities when they are handed to us so uh couple quick shoutouts before we start to drill down I just wanted to really kick off by showing you zoom out and and effectively you&#39;re looking at 15% maximum uh absorbed by the S you know uh hit to EPs and then more likely than not it&#39;s half of that which is 7% which the market has already priced in and that&#39;s why uh I love these undercuts so we went back and retested the lows and you always have to undercut to really scare the pants off people and get their stock you know I had had the uh um some anyway it&#39;s funny the people who don&#39;t give you business are the first ones to call you and ask you for your advice uh when when when these situations happen and um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s kind of comical but nonetheless I&#39;m always happy to help and um and I said look you know actually their question was about VF Corp and what I said was I said listen I can guarantee you uh 100% if you&#39;re going to sell your VF Corp today there will be a buyer okay I just need you to text me 20 seconds before you place the sell order okay I&#39;m happy to take every single share that you have in in your possession uh and we were in the market buying and I and I want to acknowledge too just uh you know first you build something then it builds you and I think that&#39;s really what&#39;s happened with this podcast I want to acknowledge one person in particular was the first email I saw this morning when I woke up and I saw the Futures down you know S&amp;P or Dow was down like 1,200 points uh Marlin I&#39;m not going to give your last name but Marlin is uh is a larger longtime customer and he said to me uh Tom use my margin to buy stocks today I&#39;m sending you another seven figures tomorrow uh to cover it and and then he quoted uh my quote which is Warren&#39;s quote when it rains gold put out a bucket not a thimble and I was in the market taking advantage of that for Marlin and I was in the market across every single account where I could find some space to take advantage of these opportunities does that mean that I&#39;m like Peter Navaro who got on at 4:30 and said based on my technical analysis I think this is the bottom the market I mean what a complete to be honest with you to get on TV and say that after putting out this policy but leaving that aside uh it is what it is and um you you literally can&#39;t make this stuff up but um so so uh so we were able to do that in every account but you know we didn&#39;t we didn&#39;t go Cowboy it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to exceed our position side limits it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to exceed our maximum leverage that we&#39;re willing to use because at the end of the day these things were already priced for death so they overshot for a day maybe they&#39;ll overshoot for AEK week until April 9th when everything&#39;s finalized but I think more likely than not uh all the we hands are out and and you basically have opportunity perspectively moving forward so that&#39;s what we wanted to take advantage of and going back to the seasonal stuff that we&#39;ve shared with you over and over it tends to get weak in the postelection Years uh up until the end of March at to early April and we&#39;ve been talking about that for some time ever since we said buckle up butter cup February and March get bumpy make your shopping list uh intel was one of the stocks we were in buying today as well not just VF Corp but Intel and Intel uh announced that or the in information had a leak out Intel tsmc tentatively agree to form chip making joint venture were we able to get it at $19 and $18 like we could last fall no but did we get it at high 20 and change just below 21 today yeah and that&#39;s a gift that&#39;s Mana from heaven I mean lip Buu tan just bought 25 million with his own money at $25 a share and we were able to to uh top up at less than 21 that is Mana from Heaven um oh also want to shout out to not only Marlin I want to shout out to my uh clients uh uh large family office came in from Dallas Chris and Brian for having me up to La took me out to a great breakfast we got to catch up and hear about all the exciting stuff that they&#39;re doing so super excited for them I also had the chance to speak to the YPO Dubai uh today thanks to Craig and to uh AJ for setting that up and making the introduction we&#39;ll be seeing you uh briefly in Dubai when I&#39;m out to see uh um a great client of mine in Dubai I&#39;m super excited for that in the end of May um and uh and that&#39;s that so just going through methodically everything we want to cover now let&#39;s look at some indicators to kind of see where we are and see if Peter Navarro&#39;s technical analysis is going to save the day um unless he knows a ton of liquidity is coming and he wants to look like a genius which I wouldn&#39;t put which I would not put put by him for sure uh this is not updated for uh today but my guess is this is well above 1.0 Everyone likes to buy puts in the Hole uh same thing with the trend we kind of peaked out a couple of days ago option skew is looking okay bullish percent S&amp;P 500 is getting towards the bottom end of the ranges [Music] um 10day put call is elevated pmo buy all and buy SPX have held up a lot better than expected given that the market is down which tells me that less stocks are going down than you would think based on the indices and oddly enough the ones that have been most impacted and even today if you look at today uh before I switch out of this it&#39;s been mag seven I mean mag s has been getting pummeled and we got out of it all at July and we thought we were Geniuses except it went up another 10% and now it&#39;s well below where we got out in July so we&#39;re never going to get the perfect top we&#39;re never going to get the perfect bottom but we get enough of the fat in the middle that we are happy so um bonds are outperforming the S&amp;P National Association of active in all the active managers have sold Down in the Hole now um they started selling when we hit the first bottom and that they&#39;ve sold everything out which means we&#39;re ready to go out we&#39;re ready to turn the corner and it&#39;s not going to take a whole lot because basically the worst case scenario news is out on a daily basis I mean are people going to want to be long into the weekend maybe maybe not we&#39;ll see but when you see uh this the NYU down Nega 6000 I mean we haven&#39;t seen that in ages I mean that that is usually uh where you&#39;re going to see a massive let me just see here on a daily basis you&#39;re going to see a massive bounce I mean this is this is hysterical uh daily so you saw it in December of last year you saw it in August let&#39;s see if we can get an overlay of a price I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to be able to see it daily but I can just tell you that this is Extreme and let me put it behind there so yeah that was the short-term bottom you got a huge rally off that that was a short-term bottom you got a huge rally off that so you definitely I mean this is this is this is capitulation okay this is definitely short-term capitulation certainly for the next couple of days I would think uh and I&#39;d be close to betting that it&#39;s near the bottom so for those of you uh who already got money in you&#39;re golden your position for those of you who are get trying to get into this uh second quarter raise get it in now because like two weeks from now look it could be lower and your Genius in in 12 months it&#39;s not going to matter it&#39;s not going to matter whether you bought VF Corp at 16 bucks or you bought VF Corp at 12 bucks because 12 to 24 months out is going to be back at mid 20s and probably the 30s and then the the business will start improving uh same thing with Cooper standard Bob is held up it was actually green part of the day intel was green part of the day Crown Castle&#39;s been doing great so you know these are the opportunities and I put out on Twitter um gosh I didn&#39;t have any of this stuff queued up but let&#39;s see what we can do here first thing this morning when everyone was puking at the open I put this out and what I said was and this is something that you may want to print out I said private Equity Funds will take no markdowns today quote unquote markdowns today apartment owners will not fire sale their buildings today it&#39;s why Efficient Market Theory doesn&#39;t work if it did work I would be out of a job human nature never changes and that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been able to do what I have and that is never going to change ladies and gentlemen and it&#39;s during these periods of dislocation I mean this is really the only place you can get outperformance is if you&#39;re buying over the last 3 four weeks after you put in the first bottom in early March and then you you continue to add on the retest and now the follow through and the fake out and all that stuff if you&#39;re not buying when prices are crazy town and you have Force Sellers and margin clerks calling people up and forcing them out of the market you&#39;re just not going to outperform what today is is the closet indexers that have been jammed into mag 7 all caught with their pants down swimming naked and that&#39;s really what it comes down to why are the Biggest Losers of the Year mag 7 when most of them are largely unaffected by tariffs and the answer is is because they&#39;re all sheep and they all got slaughtered okay let&#39;s look at year to date look the whole Market is green and if you think the whole US market is green how about the Chinese market okay look at the Biggest Losers of the Year mag 7 Microsoft Apple Amazon Tesla Google meta Nvidia okay again go back to the June 20th article I wrote the next pain trade when Nvidia was 140 bucks and it went to 152 after I wrote the article and everyone said you&#39;re wrong and today it closed at $101 okay so this is all you need to know ladies and gentlemen if you were here because you have a fake manager that was closet indexing like a sheep and got slaughtered and the Market&#39;s down 5% and you&#39;re down 40% well that&#39;s all you need to know but if you have an actual manager who&#39;s got you in good quality stocks you are going to be great moving out okay and here&#39;s the here&#39;s the better news is all these closet indexers got forc liquidated in the last few weeks so when these technically bounce and these are going to Bounce by the way um they&#39;re not even going to be in it so they&#39;re going to miss it on the downside selling in the hole and they&#39;re going to miss it back on the upside and then they&#39;re going to buy back at the top of the range and as mag 7 underperforms this year and goes back down after it gets to the top of the range they&#39;re going to get jammed again and and this is just history repeating over and over and over so as you can tell I&#39;m kind of going to add lib today because we&#39;re you know live in real time taking advantage of all this stuff and this is going to be a long one so you know if you don&#39;t want information to make money during crisis then then uh go watch Netflix but uh maybe it&#39;ll help their stock a little bit uh what did Netflix do today uh I don&#39;t know can&#39;t even find it but if it&#39;s mag7 it&#39;s probably down this year so leave it at that um we went through these indicators we went through this that this is unbelievable this nyud uh skew skew you know when skew gets down to this level you&#39;re pretty much bottomed because all the insurance plans out of the money insurance plans have cashed in or not um values continue to outperform growth this might be a short-term Peak maybe the tech starts to bounce and brings the indices up but let&#39;s look on a company by compan basis I mean this feels like the apocalypse for a lot of

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ndown to business  here we&#39;ve got uh number one thing you want to look at during periods of Crisis is high yield credit spreads and a quick proxy for that is just take a quick look at jnk credit markets are not seizing up despite fear being at record all-time highs worse than during the great financial crisis lows and the covid lows if if a aii bearish sentiment is of any importance to you we&#39;re effectively back to the levels we were in high yield uh at the beginning of the year so not much to worry about if it shoots down here we start to get a little bit more concerned and and uh maybe adjust accordingly but at the moment all good in the hood uh next is S&P 500 I love the undercut you of see test then overshoots and undercuts during major bottoms here we are could it go a lot lower sure it could go a lot lower would I bet on it I think it&#39;s going to work itself out in the next week or or so if not sooner and I love this undercut because it forced all the the remaining hands to capitulate um we can go back 20 years and everyone says you know we&#39;re going to go back and retest the loads you never really go back and ret test lows you tend to break down to get everyone out and then you open up higher uh after doing that whether it&#39;s on a weekly or monthly well guess what R TLT speaking of which a friend emailed uh texted me today and said that his new one of his clients just got a 7-year adjustable armm ARM mortgage at 5.1% 7 % arm at 5.1% uh and that is a firsttime home buyer 5.1% mortgage for the next seven years for a firsttime home buyer so housing is going to be the name of the game and when 10-year yield got to 480 we everyone was saying five we were saying three handle before four well here we are at four we&#39;re going to hit a three handle and we&#39;re going to start to see high fives on the 30-year mortgage and housing is going to rip which was our article of the week uh home site home which we&#39;re going to cover dollar how excited are we the dollar is collapsing is it it&#39;s just getting started ladies and gentlemen this is going to go a lot lower so all you folks with the loonies out there Rock and Roll Baby save your cash you&#39;re going to have some serious purchasing power around the world this is the beginning just like we saw in when 2001 this is going to continue to downtrend the US dollar and like we talked about last week this may be a precursor part of the negotiation with the tariffs hit them in the in the forehead and then say okay well if you don&#39;t like tariffs let&#39;s both go to zero and you&#39;re going to stop manipulating your currency and we&#39;re going to revalue the US dollar like we did in the plaza Accord uh in the 80s under Reagan we&#39;re going to do the exact same thing and we&#39;ll take down the tariffs and boom We&#39;re Off to the Races so all of these things are on the table and if you&#39;re not positioned and I&#39;m not saying you know lever long s S&amp;P but buy a handful of great businesses that you love that are already pricing in the apocalypse and just sit tight and don&#39;t do it on any major leverage or any major margin modest so that you can sit through any fluctuations of the next few weeks and not get shaken out like so many people today and you&#39;re going to thank me later and and it&#39;s rinse and repeat over and over and if days like today didn&#39;t exist there&#39;s no way any manager can get significant outperformance if you&#39;re not in a position to be able to buy during during times like the last few weeks where they served up unbelievable businesses at generationally uh advantageous prices and we took advantage and we pounced every red day and today was another day that we&#39;re taking advantage of so um that&#39;s a put call not all of these are up to date but look you you start to see levels of extremes that become buying opportunities for the people that are informed and paying attention major buying opportunities major buying opportunities uh NASDAQ up down I think NASDAQ gets a bounce here I think the mag s&#39;s going to get a bounce I think it trades to the top of the range in coming months and then everyone jumps in at the top and it goes back down mag 7 under performs this year China outperforms been saying the same thing next few months may look a little different but uh when we get to December that will be the outcome in our view um small caps we&#39;re buying today I mean you know it&#39;s you got to skate to where the Puck&#39;s going not where it&#39;s already been National Association puked in the hole could they puke more of course they could uh they might be forced to puke a lot of the closet indexer that were all mag seven they&#39;re they&#39;re just getting roasted all the FAS that have all these index funds I mean their clients are calling them all day long they don&#39;t know what they own they&#39;re just like it&#39;s going down what should we do I don&#39;t know what do you want to do what do you want to do what do you want to do I don&#39;t know what should I do boss what should I do CU they&#39;re asset gatherers it&#39;s a it&#39;s a whole different game S&P 500 bullish percent okay this is a level again where you start to find bottoms okay same thing by the way at the beginning of March okay and that&#39;s it you&#39;re retesting now you broke through could you Cascade waterfall all the way down and it&#39;s 1930 Holly smooth and the world is ending yeah depends which radio it depends which TV station you tune into if you&#39;re tuning into MSNBC we&#39;re in a Great Depression and uh you know buy gold and guns uh you know if you know what you own and you understand what&#39;s going on you&#39;re probably saying where can I take advantage of this opportunity uh n mlen summation index um uh NASDAQ again towards levels where you buy you make money same with the NY NYSC summation index same story the retest boom retest boom so these are levels again it pays to be a selective buyer versus a seller okay vix popped up over 30 could it go to 38 before it goes back down to 15 sure it could uh would I bet on it I don&#39;t know I I I I&#39;m not I&#39;m really not worried about that I&#39;m not worried about owning Boeing at $140 or $150 they they&#39;re in they&#39;re in a duopoly so if you can tell me people aren&#39;t going to fly because of tariffs then I&#39;ll listen but they&#39;ve got a half a trillion dollars of backlog what if it goes to 400

the beginning of a multi- multi-year International versus us outperformance kind of ironic that us Equity exceptionalism will have peaked with the Advent of um the new Administration and I don't think that speaks poorly of the new administration at all and part of it's just the person sitting in the seat uh like I said I think the economy is going to do better than ever and I think the middle class the people who haven't participated in asset price appreciation are going to do better than ever I think passive indexers are going to be less happy I think stock Pickers are going to have the time of

what you see when you want to be a buyer magnificent 7 to lag magnificent 7 magnificent 7 market cap as a percentage of S&P has now dropped from 35% down to 30% boy that was quick\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncoming in global semiconductor sales um we talked about Nvidia in June saying this is a cyclical business I think the one play that's going to be doing well while the rest are suffering is going to be Intel why because every other chip maker depends on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor Intel is going to be a producer of chips not just a designer of chips and they're going to start to take share from Taiwan semiconductor because Trump's going to make sure of it whether he likes Intel or not which I think he will I think he's going to love lip Buu tan and uh as he would say because lip ban is a winner and Trump loves winners so uh expect good things from Intel even if this cycle slows down they're going to be taking share from monopolistic producer Taiwan semiconductor\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nAmerican stocks worth quarter in 23 years relative to International that's been our theme get out of Mag 7 get inter International it all showed up at once in the first quarter\n\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nno one wants to in the hole when everyone else is pessimistic um a bad March could mean a better April so this is from Carson when you have these horrible uh marches April is on average up anywhere from two you know 1% to 133% with an average of 2.9% and a median of 2% so if you think about the indices rallying 3% you start to think about individual names rallying 15 20 30% and for folks like Marlin who uh woke up this morning and saw opportunity and put out his bucket kudos to you 12 months I look I can&#39;t tell you where Marlin&#39;s going to be 12 days from now or even 12 weeks from now but I can tell you 12 months from now he&#39;s going to look back at that email and and realize what a what a rockstar he was and for the new people that have been coming in today the new inquiries to get in uh before we close out this q1 Q2 opening uh we&#39;re going to close out on the 12th so nine days left um they&#39;ll they&#39;ll have the same exact thing and the existing clients we&#39;ve been topping up you guys are so well positioned look I can&#39;t get brand new people in the spreads on Baba that we did a year and a half ago that are up huge uh millions of dollars in aggregate but that&#39;s the way it goes you know but I can get them in other incred incredible opportunities just like you know if you&#39;re fully invested I can&#39;t get you you know in uh you know a a ton of VF Corp at $3 but you already have it at $15 so or $16 so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just opportunities Galore so let&#39;s look at um price to earnings here nasdaq&#39;s valuation Retreat so it&#39;s gone from 37 times earnings down to uh 22 times so if you remember I spent five weeks going on TV in December and January saying mag 7 earning PES 33 35 times their earnings grow decelerating from 33% down to 16% the multiple doesn&#39;t come down well guess what just happened the multiple came down probably comes down a little bit more and then you get your huge technical bounces\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving along  all country World performance so obviously outperformance of international reemphasized there consensus earnings growth the biggest consensus earnings growth expectations are small cap and they have the lowest multiple and you can&#39;t give them away I was buying that today so okay into other people&#39;s selling that&#39;s we went through this with Baba ladies and gentlemen and that&#39;s why we have a basis of $82 $83 because every red day we had an opportunity to sell in the hole like 99% of the people who listen to the cell side telling you uninvestable or the 1% who are backing up the truck in the 60s and many of you have benefited from being part of the 1% who are backing up the truck in the 60s with your White Knuckles and all we all had a little bit of White Knuckles but we sucked it up and we knew what we own and we had $80 billion of cash on the balance sheet trading at 10 times forward starting a recovery and uh and it&#39;s just beginning so uh same thing is going to happen here uh S&P returns following a 10% correction 12 months out on average up 12% without a recession I think we&#39;re not going to have a recession maybe we get one quarter of negative GDP but uh I wouldn&#39;t hold my breath uh hard data versus soft data so that&#39;s a bullish sign to keep it in mind the real data versus the sentiment is still holding in just fine us okay US versus non- US Stocks have alternated outperformance this I&#39;ve been emphasizing for many months three four months people say us exceptionalism is going to last forever I don&#39;t care if Jesus Christ himself became president in November the odds of us stock performance which has pulled forward a lot of returns in recent years continuing to outperform International would be very unlikely okay so as good or bad as you believe the policies are going to be for the next four years it doesn&#39;t mean that US Stocks have to outperform or underperform it&#39;s just the nature of the cycle okay so like 80 1964 to 1980 9 us was flat International dramatically outperformed 1989 to 2201 us dramatically outperformed International didn&#39;t then you had 20012 2002 to 2008 2009 international small C value outperformed then you&#39;ve had the zero interest rate policy once in a lifetime event from 2010 to 201 you know 22 uh us outperformed and that&#39;s changing now you&#39;re seeing the stimulus coming from China seeing the stimulus coming from Europe that&#39;s where the money is going to flow where there&#39;s liquidity not austerity cutting you know thousands of jobs in Doge which you know look has to be done but there are consequences you know if you&#39;re if you&#39;re austere you&#39;re going to attract detract Capital flows if you&#39;re accommodative and stimulative you&#39;re going to attract Capital flows China was austere for 3 years and then they flipped uh uh the switch when they had a bunch of 20% or 25 5-year-olds unemployed and starting social unrest they flipped and now Alibaba doubled okay and it&#39;s going to double again so these things run in Cycles here&#39;s uh auto sales for March blew the doors off Beyond any possible expectations so a little bit of pull forward but you&#39;re starting to get the price cuts which this may be slightly more sustainable than people actually think even with the tariffs why because the oems are going to eat the prices and they&#39;re going to subsidize the losses because they don&#39;t want to lose share in this environment and it\n\ngot them out of their monopolistic sell above MSRP covid um uh laa palooza that they experienced that they thought they would be able to run forever and the the gig is up now it's going to be volumes low prices low margins and suppliers the arms dealers are going to start to win again ADP manufacturing jobs monthly increase so the question from this is is Trump's plan working manufacturing job are growing for the first time in 2 years this doesn't say Wall Street jobs are growing it says manufacturing jobs are growing it doesn't say um White Collar jobs are growing it says everyday jobs are growing and that's a good thing for America so we should be celebrating this not on Twitter whining because your mag7 is 30% down because you couldn't read the writing on the wall uh that was pretty obvious to everyone that that was paying attention 3 four five months ago Wards Automotive US Auto Sales S I mean through the roof we haven't seen a level this High since uh going back to 2017 so let's see if we can maintain it up here because if we can the amount of money that Cooper is going to be spewing out over the next 12 to 24 months is going to be staggering uh tariffs are no tariffs the volumes are going to be through the roof um share repurchases what else do we we have here uh rare moment for Value outperforming growth another thing that we has been a key theme for us okay S&P hit a one-year High last month but closed down more than 5% this month 3 months later you're up on average 6.8% 12 6 months later 15.5% 9 months later 22.1 one year later 25.49 dollar rolling over more of that Bloomberg dollar spot euro is climbing 10-year government bond yield now close to I think it got below four for a minute today I'm not sure but it's definitely at four and uh 5.1% seven-year arm mortgages wait till the 30-year fix hits a 5'9 I've been saying that and if you don't have exposure to the Home Building sector and I'm not talking about buying home builders because they're going to be as screwed as GM and Ford in terms terms of margins I'm talking about the arms dealers the building supply companies the generx of the world the Stanley Black and Deckers of the world the qxo qxo of the world Brad Brad Jacobs Home Building Supply rollups with Beacon Roofing as the platform company okay this is from when the nber recession announcement came as it relates to recessions and then the total return uh uh after up 60 okay if you wait for the robins to sing spring will be over recession start recession end okay so the the nber acknowledges recessions in the rearview mirror by the time they acknowledge a recession the Market's already up on average 6 61% over the next 15 months okay that's that's obvious here are the rate cut probabilities for June have now jumped back up to 80 4% uh tomorrow's jobs report is critical we'll see if that comes in Weak uh or unemployment ticks up which wouldn't be really surprising uh given all the Doge and and um knock on effects of that uh then the fed's back in play and the market starts to probably like the idea of the FED being back in play and maybe you find a short-term bottom here or a bounce corporate America's buyback stalls on tariff uncertainty and also excess capex spend by the way because mag 7 was driving the buyback bus now they're spending it uh uh on unclear return on invested Capital which is why they're down and is crowding out BuyBacks another theme we've been talking about on this podcast Challenger report announced job Cuts uh this is going through the roof so let's see if it's reflected in tomorrow's report quarterly total returns us value stocks minus us growth stocks at the highest levels we've seen since 2001 which kicked off what period of seven years of outperformance of international versus us a a period of uh value over growth and a period of small cap over large cap so coming to a theater near you Equity ETF still seen selling still seeing most almost three billion dollar a day defense spending us has been able to spend less because of Trump's kind of twisting NATO's arm uh Germany's going up UK is going up to meet the requirements of NATO Euphoria Omer that peaked car dealership Guy this is interesting scoop Ford is cutting pricing on most models unlike a few oems who are raising prices in light of impending tariffs through June 2nd carb buyers can take advantage of special employee pricing on eligible Ford and Lincoln vehicles through the new quote from America for America campaign dealer cash incentives are on the table for retailers as well will be on the lookout new pricing will be available on Ford dealers websites first thing tomorrow that came out yesterday what does that mean it means volumes follow in incentives as affordability goes up volumes go up as volumes go up Cooper standards free cash flow goes through the roof were we buying Cooper standard today yes we were 10-year yield okay we can see this breaking down it got even lower today so the next level of support is going to be 393 it's going to blow people's mind when it has the three handle for a few days uh it's coming value is still underweight despite the outperformance which is the same thing that you saw in the early 2000s then they got overweight by the time it peak in 20 2007 values uh dramatically underweight this is what you see in the early stages of a regime change China exports to consumption re reorientation so uh their exports have come down from 35% to 20 their consumption is starting to recover from 5% to now 39% and their goal is to make it 7 % uh Alibaba I think gets 40 cents on every dollar spent on consumption they get a toll through uh because of the amount of e-commerce that's done in China so we are going to benefit from that Trend Chinese stock investors flock to Hong Kong to bargain hunt alibaba's quen 3 remember how amazing 2.5 was better than chat GPT uh better than deep seek Etc well now they're going to do even better quen three quen three AI model coming this month sources is say in a bid to cement industry lead cement industry lead ladies and gentlemen Chinese stocks get a shot in the arm from stimulus moves HSBC survey says China's Factory activity growth at oneyear high go where the stimulus is you can only hold the beach ball underwater so much stimulus is now coming in Germany stimulus is in Europe stimulus is international austerity us it's necessary but it's just what it is and money will go where it's treated best and right now treated best in China and in in and in international and not in the US because why because Trump had to clean up a lot of messes from Decades of neglect and it's just you know we got to take a little medicine here and that's why the mag s's getting smoked part of the reason um Factory growth at one year high forget the mag s terrific 10 are the tech bet for 2025 that's Alibaba 10 cent Maan zi JD nety ba byd G Le smic that's from not the lady who wrote 135 consecutive negative\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwhen you live in the middle of nowhere you&#39;re definitely going to want a generator because you don&#39;t want to be stuck uh you know with uh endangered polar bears next to your house without power when the power goes out so uh gets windy out in those 500 uh million square miles of rural Western United States so that&#39;s what happens with gener generators that&#39;s what happens with Stanley Black and&amp; Decker DeWalt Stanley Craftsman all the tools used in construction when you see existing home sales Spike up guess what happens to uh this and what causes that to spike up number one is demographics which couldn&#39;t be better number two is affordability which is a function of the cost of capital which Isen right now telling you 5&#39;9 it&#39;s going to be through the roof how many homes are going to be bought and as that construction starts you&#39;re going to start to see new orders come in like crazy and that&#39;s going to happen very very fast and qxo is going to be a beneficiary here&#39;s the here&#39;s another way to looking at it 30-year fixed rate mortgage at 6.32 as it&#39;s ridden what&#39;s collapsed Stanley Black and&amp; Decker as it falls what happens Stanley Black and&amp; Decker rallies as mortgage rates fall same thing will happen with Stanley same thing will happen with gener same thing will happen with qxo and by the time you figure it out it&#39;s too late because they&#39;ve already all doubled so what we&#39;re were were we buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker today you bet your ass we were buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker like it was going out of style were we buying gener today you bet your bottom dollar we were buying gener today so that&#39;s how we do it um\n\nmoving along  us 10-year treasury yield rolling back over that is what mortgage rates price off of and um and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get all these things all you need to do is be burdened by the facts by the way for all you burdened by the facts all",

the top International's up at the top Energy's outperformed com Stock's been on a tear uh so we're super happy about that gold is outperformed so all the end of the worlders are super happy congrat

Hole opinion follows Trend so they were all buying at the top selling in the hole so you know you got to decide what you want to do\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAuto tariffs could reignite used car prices in Auto Repair business that's where Advanced Auto Part start to starts to flourish again\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nweaker and weaker dollar benefits International uh we've been pounding the table and what you've seen in the beginning of this year probably breathe for a little bit but it's just the beginning of a multi- multi-year International versus us outperformance kind of ironic that us Equity exceptionalism will have peaked with the Advent of um the new Administration and I don't think that speaks poorly of the new administration at all and part of it's just the person sitting in the seat uh like I said I think the economy is going to do better than ever and I think the middle class the people who haven't participated in asset price appreciation are going to do better than ever I think passive indexers are going to be less happy I think stock Pickers are going to have the time of their lives\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nvalue versus growth value's been outperforming 23% of stocks beat growth Benchmark beating Russell 1,000 growth index based on trailing 12 months so this is kind of what you see when you want to be a buyer magnificent 7 to lag magnificent 7 magnificent 7 market cap as a percentage of S&P has now dropped from 35% down to 30% boy that was quick\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ncoming in global semiconductor sales um we talked about Nvidia in June saying this is a cyclical business I think the one play that's going to be doing well while the rest are suffering is going to be Intel why because every other chip maker depends on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor Intel is going to be a producer of chips not just a designer of chips and they're going to start to take share from Taiwan semiconductor because Trump's going to make sure of it whether he likes Intel or not which I think he will I think he's going to love lip Buu tan and uh as he would say because lip ban is a winner and Trump loves winners so uh expect good things from Intel even if this cycle slows down they're going to be taking share from monopolistic producer Taiwan semiconductor\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nAmerican stocks worth quarter in 23 years relative to International that's been our theme get out of Mag 7 get inter International it all showed up at once in the first quarter\n\n\nwhat you see when you want to be a buyer magnificent 7 to lag magnificent 7 magnificent 7 market cap as a percentage of S&amp;P has now dropped from 35% down to 30% boy that was quick um wow that is unbelievable how quickly that&#39;s and it probably going to Trend even further down even if we get a technical bounce stocks at record 29% of us household Financial assets buying the top no International exposure common theme that&#39;s going to change very quickly and a lot of that money is going to flow into International next slowdown coming in global semiconductor sales um we talked about Nvidia in June saying this is a cyclical business I think the one play that&#39;s going to be doing well while the rest are suffering is going to be Intel why because every other chip maker depends on the kindness of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor Intel is going to be a producer of chips not just a designer of chips and they&#39;re going to start to take share from Taiwan semiconductor because Trump&#39;s going to make sure of it whether he likes Intel or not which I think he will I think he&#39;s going to love lip Buu tan and uh as he would say because lip ban is a winner and Trump loves winners so uh expect good things from Intel even if this cycle slows down they&#39;re going to be taking share from monopolistic producer Taiwan semiconductor um or partnering with them as we saw in the information which is even better American Stock it&#39;ll just accelerate the process American stocks worth quarter in 23 years relative to International that&#39;s been our theme get out of Mag 7 get inter International it all showed up at once in the first quarter uh and that&#39;s super exciting us fundamental long short net leverage so they&#39;ve just absolutely gotten smoked gotten out of all leverage that&#39;s why mag 7 is smoked they&#39;re just liquidating out getting redeemed out and bleeding on the carpet and um and that usually creates the the vacuum to for smart buyers to step in\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  the five-week moving average of the a aii bearish sentiment index it is worse than during the covid lows worse than during the great financial crisis lows the worst going all the way back to uh the 2022 lows and then prior to that going back to the 1989 1990 recession lows there&#39;s bearish as they can get so you can tell me that I don&#39;t want to be a buyer when everyone else is bearish and I&#39;d say okay well you&#39;re part of the herd but you don&#39;t get these type of returns by buying when no one wants to in the hole when everyone else is pessimistic um a bad March could mean a better April so this is from Carson when you have these horrible uh marches April is on average up anywhere from two you know 1% to 133% with an average of 2.9% and a median of 2% so if you think about the indices rallying 3% you start to think about individual names rallying 15 20 30% and for folks like Marlin who uh woke up this morning and saw opportunity and put out his bucket kudos to you 12 months I look I can&#39;t tell you where Marlin&#39;s going to be 12 days from now or even 12 weeks from now but I can tell you 12 months from now he&#39;s going to look back at that email and and realize what a what a rockstar he was and for the new people that have been coming in today the new inquiries to get in uh before we close out this q1 Q2 opening uh we&#39;re going to close out on the 12th so nine days left um they&#39;ll they&#39;ll have the same exact thing and the existing clients we&#39;ve been topping up you guys are so well positioned look I can&#39;t get brand new people in the spreads on Baba that we did a year and a half ago that are up huge uh millions of dollars in aggregate but that&#39;s the way it goes you know but I can get them in other incred incredible opportunities just like you know if you&#39;re fully invested I can&#39;t get you you know in uh you know a a ton of VF Corp at $3 but you already have it at $15 so or $16 so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s just opportunities Galore so let&#39;s look at um price to earnings here nasdaq&#39;s valuation Retreat so it&#39;s gone from 37 times earnings down to uh 22 times so if you remember I spent five weeks going on TV in December and January saying mag 7 earning PES 33 35 times their earnings grow decelerating from 33% down to 16% the multiple doesn&#39;t come down well guess what just happened the multiple came down probably comes down a little bit more and then you get your huge technical bounces",
