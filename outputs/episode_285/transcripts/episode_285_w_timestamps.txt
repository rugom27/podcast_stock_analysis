[138.76s] this was going into the announcement
[142.519s] which you know came out uh kind of worse
[145.0s] than most people expected in terms of
[147.239s] the um uh
[150.56s] bite in the tariffs and we&#39;re going to
[152.4s] talk a lot about that today and how we
[154.2s] can take advantage of the opportunity
[155.76s] that it created but let&#39;s listen in we
[158.04s] off to a 10 start to the second quarter
[160.319s] of 2025 to put it mildly let&#39;s get some
[163.239s] new insight into how markets and the
[165.2s] economy are holding up amid all of the
[167.4s] Tariff Tantrums Thomas Hayes joins us
[169.76s] for that he&#39;s a Founder chairman and
[171.599s] managing member of great Hill Capital
[173.879s] Thomas thanks for coming on thanks for
[175.879s] having me Karina so Thomas tell me first
[178.239s] of all what do you make of Market Market
[180.08s] reaction today ahead of these tariffs
[182.319s] what&#39;s it signaling to you about just
[184.239s] how much investors actually believe
[186.64s] Trump follows through on all of these
[188.56s] grandiose tariff pledges reports are 20%
[191.56s] on a broad range of imports but
[193.72s] nothing&#39;s firm
[195.319s] yet well this might be the most
[197.48s] telegraphed quote unquote surprise in
[199.519s] the history of stock markets I think a
[201.72s] lot of the bad news is already priced in
[204.44s] and as Warren Buffett says when be
[206.92s] greedy when others are fearful and
[209.159s] fearful when others are greedy and right
[211.08s] now people are super fearful as a matter
[213.72s] of fact if you look at the a aii bearish
[216.84s] sentiment indicator of retail investors
[219.64s] it&#39;s the most pessimistic since the tech
[222.12s] wreck in
[223.4s] 2022 and more pessimistic than the lows
[227.04s] of covid and the lows of the great
[229.56s] financial crisis so if you&#39;re not
[231.2s] looking for opportunities in times like
[233.159s] these with high quality businesses when
[235.28s] they&#39;re marked down when are you going
[237.159s] to look for them you know we say on Wall
[238.959s] Street it&#39;s the only Market you can go
[241.439s] when they hold a clearance sale no one
[243.159s] shows up to buy yeah so you say you know
[246.599s] buy the dip look for the bargains now
[248.799s] stay ahead of the curb if he actually
[251.159s] does follow through could you tell me if
[254.04s] so if these tariffs stick for any period
[256.4s] of time what does that do to stocks and
[258.88s] to the
[259.88s] economy well look it it&#39;s a onetime
[263.4s] level up okay and right now based on how
[266.4s] the market performed in the first
[268.32s] quarter with the US
[270.4s] underperforming International Stocks by
[272.759s] the widest margin in over two decades
[275.639s] S&amp;P down about 5% International of about
[279.8s] 8% uh a lot of the worst case is priced
[283.12s] in so you have a level up in prices but
[284.759s] at the end of the day how many of these
[286.84s] businesses are going to stand up
[288.32s] factories in the US for three and a half
[290.36s] years and spend tens of billions of
[291.88s] dollars to do so the products that they
[294.12s] provide will still be in demand they&#39;ll
[296.639s] have to get it they&#39;ll have you know
[298.0s] some will get passed through the
[299.24s] consumer some will be uh shared by the
[302.36s] manufacturers and the suppliers but at
[304.44s] the end of the day it&#39;s a one time it&#39;s
[305.96s] not 20% compounded at 10% per year it&#39;s
[310.039s] 20% one time and the market will digest
[312.88s] it in a matter of weeks and you can use
[316.28s] that opportunity and that volatility to
[319.039s] buy high quality companies for the long
[321.44s] term it&#39;s not the case that tariffs come
[323.52s] in and every business goes out of out of
[326.039s] business because someone new starts up
[328.639s] in the United States not what&#39;s going to
[330.479s] happen what&#39;s going to happen is uh
[332.12s] there&#39;ll be some short-term friction and
[333.84s] long-term reward welcome to Trump 2.0
[336.52s] same as Trump 1.0 new day new headline
[340.6s] new volatility resolves higher over time
[344.0s] so you&#39;re saying everybody should just
[345.319s] take a breath but you know GDP for the
[347.56s] first quarter is not going to come in
[349.72s] anywhere near the 2.4% we saw in Q4 some
[353.52s] say we can actually see a contraction
[355.96s] because of all of this tariff volatility
[358.4s] do you think we need to work worry about
[360.199s] a
[360.919s] recession no I don&#39;t think we do need to
[363.28s] worry about a recession at this point
[364.88s] the numbers that you&#39;re seeing as far as
[366.4s] Atlanta G GDP now are noisy because of
[369.56s] inventories and some pull forwards and
[371.72s] and related to the uncertainty of policy
[374.28s] but this happens every four years you
[376.44s] have uncertainty in the first quarter
[379.0s] with a new Administration it doesn&#39;t
[381.28s] have to be good policy it has to be
[383.4s] known policy and what the market
[385.16s] grappled with in the first quarter was
[387.88s] unknown policy and we&#39;re to get greater
[390.479s] resolution and you could find in the
[392.479s] next few days or the next couple of
[394.08s] weeks this is a clearing event whether
[396.44s] it turns out positive or negative at
[398.319s] least we&#39;ll know what the rules of the
[399.8s] game are and we can adjust accordingly
[402.16s] and that&#39;s what Wall Street wants to see
[404.08s] so you&#39;re saying you know it&#39;s been a
[405.56s] miserable first quarter by all accounts
[407.479s] all the major averages lower flirting or
[409.599s] in correction inflation creeping higher
[412.56s] so what do you actually anticipate
[414.36s] seeing with stocks near term and then
[416.56s] midterm as well well look I think the
[419.199s] theme that we came into the year worth
[421.44s] with is going to continue and the theme
[423.52s] that we came in was you want to be
[425.68s] buying International stocks particularly
[428.16s] China Tech our largest position that
[430.56s] we&#39;ve built up over the last year and a
[432.16s] half has been Alibaba uh we think that&#39;s
[434.72s] going to continue to outperform we think
[436.919s] International stocks are going to
[438.44s] continue to outperform as the dollar
[440.919s] weekends mag 7 would underperform due to
[444.52s] increased capb backs and lower earnings
[446.759s] power decelerating earnings I think
[448.759s] we&#39;re at the point now where enough of
[451.0s] those stocks are oversold that you could
[453.36s] see a bounce in mag 7 in the coming
[456.96s] quarter but I do think it&#39;s going to
[459.4s] stay in that range even if it trades
[461.12s] back up to the top of the range I do
[463.12s] think Mag s will underperform I do think
[465.599s] International stocks will outperform
[468.24s] domestic stocks this year and that&#39;s
[469.68s] where your opportunity is going to be so
[471.4s] if you&#39;re a Trader maybe take a punt on
[473.4s] some of these tech stocks if you&#39;re an
[475.199s] investor start buying Industrials
[477.68s] everything that&#39;s perceived to be
[479.599s] affected by tariffs that has been marked
[481.879s] down this is a perfect example Karina
[485.0s] instead of buy the rumor sell the news
[486.599s] this is a sell the rumor bu the news
[490.199s] sell the rumor of tariffs buy it when
[492.12s] it&#39;s actually announced and I think
[493.599s] we&#39;re going to have opportunities here
[495.479s] into Q2 and Beyond guidance has been
[497.68s] taken down materially in q1 that&#39;s the
[500.36s] normal game every year first quarter
[502.4s] CEOs give conservative guidance so they
[504.759s] can beat in the subsequent three
[506.28s] quarters get their bonuses get their
[508.639s] options shareholders are happy and this
[511.039s] year will be no different I love that
[513.039s] you&#39;re talking about International
[514.479s] stocks there as well because Nvidia down
[516.32s] 21% year to date Tesla down 28% year to
[519.519s] date tell me quickly where do you stand
[521.159s] on gold where do you see that going I
[523.519s] have no view on gold as it yields no
[525.48s] cash uh I like businesses that generate
[527.92s] free cash flow that I can measure that
[530.64s] are growing that are high quality
[532.44s] durable businesses gold is just a bet on
[534.88s] who&#39;s going to come in after you and buy
[536.8s] it at a higher price and that I&#39;ll leave
[538.72s] that game for other people okay we&#39;ll
[540.48s] see how it all shakes out on Liberation
[542.48s] day Thomas Hayes thanks so much for
[543.88s] coming on thank you Karina and still in
[547.92s] here and we&#39;re back and then uh and by
[551.76s] the way not much of that changes even
[554.56s] though the facts somewhat changed and
[557.76s] we&#39;re going to go through why so first
[559.72s] and foremost this just came in after the
[563.56s] Clos today Trump tariff live updates
[567.519s] president Trump says he&#39;s open into
[569.92s] negotiations contradicting wh White
[572.64s] House AIDS like um Peter Navaro and
[577.44s] others and
[580.24s] um uh so that&#39;s that the other thing I
[584.12s] wanted to do is step back and put things
[587.279s] in perspective here I just kind of said
[589.68s] $600 billion okay so let&#39;s let&#39;s say
[592.079s] this is a number what&#39;s the number so
[593.68s] what is everyone afraid of well the
[595.8s] stock market is comprised the name of
[598.12s] the game with the stock market is called
[600.0s] earnings okay and so I pulled this up
[603.16s] and I found out what is the aggregate
[605.68s] net income meaning the earnings power of
[608.279s] the S&amp;P 500 over the last 12 months and
[613.48s] it came out to
[615.6s] 1.9 trillion okay 1.9 trillion
[622.32s] on
[624.24s] uh I think it&#39;s about 19
[627.88s] trillion 7 trillion of
[631.48s] Revenue
[633.72s] and 19 1.9 trillion of net income so you
[639.88s] could
[641.92s] say
[644.12s] okay we have a problem Houston we have a
[647.32s] problem uh number one is
[653.32s] if the S&amp;P 500 companies number one
[657.44s] they&#39;re not 100% % of the companies in
[661.56s] America so let&#39;s just assume they&#39;re
[664.279s] half so that means it would be a $300
[668.399s] billion if they assumed all of the loss
[672.12s] they passed nothing on to suppliers they
[674.44s] passed nothing onto customers and they
[677.44s] just said well we&#39;re going to be a
[679.16s] benevolent uh company uh we&#39;re going to
[681.68s] actually switch the opposite of chat GPT
[684.519s] we&#39;re going to go from being a
[685.639s] for-profit to a nonprofit and we&#39;ll just
[688.2s] eat all of these tariffs rather than
[690.2s] pass it on to Consumers uh you&#39;re
[692.639s] basically looking at you know
[695.839s] 300 billion of two trillion so you know
[702.2s] you you start to get
[703.839s] into 15% of earnings give or take that&#39;s
[707.959s] if they assume all of the pain all of
[710.639s] the time 15% of earnings well last I
[713.519s] checked the S&amp;P 500 I believe is down
[719.519s] give or take 12% is that correct maybe
[723.44s] more today let&#39;s pull it
[726.76s] up okay so you&#39;re
[729.56s] effectively at the worst case scenario
[735.399s] meaning the Market&#39;s down 15% and
[738.6s] earnings are down 15% okay so year to
[741.92s] date
[749.92s] okay so it was 3.39 yesterday and it
[752.8s] dropped 5%
[755.279s] today so you
[758.68s] got give or take nine it dropped a total
[762.079s] of 10 or 11% was in kind of Correction
[765.519s] territory this morning so give or take
[767.72s] 10%
[770.04s] 11% and you&#39;ve got 15% of earnings now
[774.0s] number one I&#39;ve probably overestimated
[776.279s] the percentage of the 600 billion that&#39;s
[780.519s] attributed to public companies versus
[782.92s] private companies um and number two I&#39;ve
[786.12s] have 100% overestimated the amount that
[789.32s] the companies are actually going to eat
[792.079s] um this is
[794.399s] effectively there&#39;s no other way to say
[796.76s] it this is a tax on the poor okay now
[799.92s] ultimately in the short term because
[802.04s] it&#39;s not you know whatever it is 20
[806.519s] plus% compounded at 10% a year it&#39;s a
[809.199s] one time level up so it&#39;s a one time tax
[811.36s] on the poor why do I say tax on the poor
[813.399s] because the average uh you know a lot of
[816.88s] people don&#39;t feel a dollar in milk or
[820.72s] you know a dollar per gallon in gas and
[822.959s] a lot of people do but the people who do
[825.36s] are the people who are going to feel it
[826.72s] the most so this is going to hurt them
[827.959s] the most in the short term in the longer
[830.519s] term I do think this is going to be much
[833.68s] better for labor than it is for Capital
[837.36s] uh meaning the people doing real jobs
[840.68s] are going to be uh proportionately
[844.04s] gaining a lot more than the people
[846.48s] managing assets uh and that&#39;s a good
[849.079s] thing and that&#39;s what we saw in the
[851.72s] first term of trump 1.0 real wages at
[856.04s] the salari level increased by the the
[858.839s] most for uh across all demographics uh
[862.88s] but particularly the low-end and the
[864.88s] middle end got the biggest bump uh uh
[867.88s] minorities got the biggest bump and I
[870.399s] think that&#39;s a great thing for America
[872.399s] and I think that&#39;s going to be the
[873.759s] result that happens out of this so but
[877.279s] since we&#39;re on a stock market podcast
[879.6s] and um uh we we want to make money in
[882.519s] the stock market what we have to do is
[885.399s] out of every crisis comes opportunity
[887.639s] and take advantage of these
[888.92s] opportunities when they are handed to us
[891.68s] so uh couple quick shoutouts before we
[894.48s] start to drill down I just wanted to
[897.12s] really kick off by showing you zoom out
[901.16s] and and effectively you&#39;re looking at
[904.04s] 15%
[905.56s] maximum uh absorbed by the S you know uh
[909.199s] hit to EPs and then more likely than not
[912.88s] it&#39;s half of that which is 7% which the
[915.639s] market has already priced in and that&#39;s
[919.279s] why uh I love these undercuts so we went
[923.24s] back and retested the lows and you
[925.32s] always have to undercut to really scare
[927.759s] the pants off people and get their stock
[929.8s] you know I had had the
[931.959s] uh um some anyway it&#39;s funny the people
[938.0s] who don&#39;t give you business are the
[940.199s] first ones to call you and ask you for
[942.44s] your advice uh when when when these
[945.44s] situations happen and um it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s
[948.319s] kind of comical but nonetheless I&#39;m
[950.199s] always happy to help and
[953.399s] um and I said look you know actually
[957.04s] their question was about VF Corp and
[958.6s] what I said was I said listen I can
[960.92s] guarantee you uh 100% if you&#39;re going to
[964.68s] sell your VF Corp today there will be a
[967.44s] buyer okay I just need you to text me 20
[970.68s] seconds before you place the sell order
[973.079s] okay I&#39;m happy to take every single
[975.399s] share that you have in in your
[977.079s] possession uh and we were in the market
[978.959s] buying and I and I want to acknowledge
[980.839s] too
[982.279s] just uh you know first you build
[985.24s] something then it builds you and I think
[987.12s] that&#39;s really what&#39;s happened with this
[989.0s] podcast I want to acknowledge one person
[991.36s] in particular was the first email I saw
[993.8s] this morning when I woke up and I saw
[995.92s] the Futures down you know S&amp;P or Dow was
[999.399s] down like 1,200 points uh Marlin I&#39;m not
[1002.6s] going to give your last name but Marlin
[1005.639s] is uh is a larger longtime customer and
[1008.639s] he said to me uh Tom use my margin to
[1013.68s] buy stocks today I&#39;m sending you another
[1016.72s] seven figures tomorrow uh to cover it
[1020.399s] and and then he quoted uh my quote which
[1024.64s] is Warren&#39;s quote when it rains gold put
[1026.679s] out a bucket not a thimble and I was in
[1028.919s] the market taking advantage of that for
[1030.64s] Marlin and I was in the market across
[1032.76s] every single account where I could find
[1034.28s] some space to take advantage of these
[1036.199s] opportunities does that mean that I&#39;m
[1038.28s] like Peter Navaro who got on at 4:30 and
[1041.319s] said based on my technical analysis I
[1043.679s] think this is the bottom the market I
[1044.959s] mean what a complete to be
[1046.48s] honest with you to get on TV and say
[1048.199s] that after putting out this policy but
[1050.679s] leaving that aside uh it is what it is
[1053.76s] and
[1056.12s] um you you literally can&#39;t make this
[1058.48s] stuff up but
[1061.4s] um so so uh so we were able to do that
[1064.48s] in every account but you know we didn&#39;t
[1066.52s] we didn&#39;t go Cowboy it&#39;s not like we&#39;re
[1068.16s] going to exceed our position side limits
[1070.16s] it&#39;s not like we&#39;re going to exceed our
[1071.679s] maximum leverage that we&#39;re willing to
[1073.12s] use because at the end of the day these
[1074.799s] things were already priced for death so
[1076.36s] they overshot for a day maybe they&#39;ll
[1078.08s] overshoot for AEK week until April 9th
[1080.679s] when everything&#39;s finalized but I think
[1082.96s] more likely than not uh all the we hands
[1086.96s] are out and and you basically have
[1089.44s] opportunity perspectively moving forward
[1091.679s] so that&#39;s what we wanted to take
[1093.2s] advantage of and going back to the
[1095.159s] seasonal stuff that we&#39;ve shared with
[1096.72s] you over and over it tends to get weak
[1099.08s] in the postelection Years uh up until
[1101.64s] the end of March at to early April and
[1104.159s] we&#39;ve been talking about that for some
[1106.2s] time ever since we said buckle up butter
[1108.88s] cup February and March get bumpy make
[1111.08s] your shopping list uh intel was one of
[1113.48s] the stocks we were in buying today as
[1115.159s] well not just VF Corp but Intel and
[1118.36s] Intel uh announced that or the in
[1121.2s] information had a leak out Intel tsmc
[1125.12s] tentatively agree to form chip making
[1128.039s] joint venture were we able to get it at
[1129.84s] $19 and $18 like we could last fall no
[1132.44s] but did we get it at high 20 and change
[1134.96s] just below 21 today yeah and that&#39;s a
[1136.88s] gift that&#39;s Mana from heaven I mean lip
[1139.52s] Buu tan just bought 25 million with his
[1142.159s] own money at $25 a share and we were
[1144.64s] able to to uh top up at less than 21
[1148.44s] that is Mana from Heaven um oh also want
[1152.44s] to shout out to not only Marlin I want
[1154.6s] to shout out to my uh clients uh uh
[1157.799s] large family office came in from Dallas
[1160.48s] Chris and Brian for having me up to La
[1162.96s] took me out to a great breakfast we got
[1165.039s] to catch up and hear about all the
[1166.88s] exciting stuff that they&#39;re doing so
[1168.96s] super excited for them I also had the
[1171.48s] chance to speak to the YPO Dubai uh
[1176.08s] today thanks to Craig and to uh AJ for
[1180.679s] setting that up and making the
[1182.32s] introduction we&#39;ll be seeing you uh
[1185.2s] briefly in Dubai when I&#39;m out to
[1187.44s] see uh um a great client of mine in
[1190.919s] Dubai I&#39;m super excited for that in the
[1192.96s] end of
[1194.44s] May um and uh and that&#39;s that so just
[1200.76s] going through methodically everything we
[1202.96s] want to cover now let&#39;s look at some
[1206.08s] indicators to kind of see where we are
[1208.12s] and see if Peter Navarro&#39;s technical
[1210.159s] analysis is going to save the day
[1214.24s] um unless he knows a ton of liquidity is
[1217.039s] coming and he wants to look like a
[1218.36s] genius which I wouldn&#39;t
[1220.36s] put which I would not put put by him for
[1223.64s] sure uh this is not updated for uh today
[1227.44s] but my guess is this is well above 1.0
[1229.559s] Everyone likes to buy puts in the Hole
[1232.0s] uh same thing with the trend we kind of
[1234.559s] peaked out a couple of days ago option
[1237.4s] skew is looking okay bullish percent S&amp;P
[1240.24s] 500 is getting towards the bottom end of
[1242.559s] the
[1243.24s] ranges
[1244.34s] [Music]
[1245.84s] um 10day put call is
[1248.96s] elevated pmo buy all and buy SPX have
[1252.2s] held up a lot better than expected given
[1254.24s] that the market is down which tells me
[1256.84s] that less stocks are going
[1259.28s] down than you would think based on the
[1261.32s] indices and oddly enough the ones that
[1263.919s] have been most impacted and even today
[1266.76s] if you look at
[1268.6s] today uh before I switch out of this
[1271.919s] it&#39;s been mag seven I mean mag s has
[1274.08s] been getting pummeled and we got out of
[1276.48s] it all at July and we thought we were
[1278.88s] Geniuses except it went up another 10%
[1281.12s] and now it&#39;s well below where we got out
[1284.679s] in July so we&#39;re never going to get the
[1286.279s] perfect top we&#39;re never going to get the
[1287.52s] perfect bottom but we get enough of the
[1289.88s] fat in the middle that we are happy so
[1294.679s] um bonds are outperforming the S&amp;P
[1297.4s] National Association of active in all
[1299.24s] the active managers have sold Down in
[1300.84s] the Hole now um they started selling
[1303.48s] when we hit the first bottom and that
[1305.4s] they&#39;ve sold everything out which means
[1307.12s] we&#39;re ready to go out we&#39;re ready to
[1308.799s] turn the corner and it&#39;s not going to
[1310.48s] take a whole lot because basically the
[1311.96s] worst case scenario news is out on a
[1314.48s] daily basis I mean are people going to
[1316.84s] want to be long into the weekend maybe
[1318.88s] maybe not we&#39;ll see but when you see uh
[1324.2s] this the NYU down Nega 6000 I mean we
[1328.76s] haven&#39;t seen that in ages I mean that
[1330.64s] that is
[1332.24s] usually uh where you&#39;re going to see a
[1335.159s] massive let me just see
[1341.799s] here on a daily basis you&#39;re going to
[1344.44s] see a massive bounce
[1348.679s] I mean this is this is
[1352.159s] hysterical uh
[1355.24s] daily so you saw it in December of last
[1358.279s] year you saw it in August let&#39;s see if
[1360.039s] we can get an overlay of a
[1362.919s] price I don&#39;t know if we&#39;re going to be
[1364.679s] able to see it daily but I can just tell
[1366.76s] you that this is
[1369.4s] Extreme
[1374.679s] and let me put it behind there
[1383.12s] so yeah that was the short-term bottom
[1385.0s] you got a huge rally off that that was a
[1386.96s] short-term bottom you got a huge rally
[1388.64s] off
[1390.4s] that so you definitely I mean this is
[1393.84s] this is this is capitulation okay this
[1396.32s] is definitely short-term capitulation
[1398.12s] certainly for the next couple of days I
[1400.32s] would think uh and I&#39;d be close to
[1403.32s] betting that it&#39;s near the bottom so for
[1406.279s] those of you uh who already got money in
[1409.6s] you&#39;re golden your position for those of
[1411.52s] you who are get trying to get into this
[1414.039s] uh second quarter raise get it in now
[1416.76s] because like two weeks from now look it
[1418.96s] could be lower and your Genius in in 12
[1422.0s] months it&#39;s not going to matter it&#39;s not
[1423.279s] going to matter whether you bought VF
[1425.24s] Corp at 16 bucks or you bought VF Corp
[1427.44s] at 12 bucks because 12 to 24 months out
[1431.36s] is going to be back at mid 20s and
[1433.279s] probably the 30s and then the the
[1435.08s] business will start improving uh same
[1437.36s] thing with Cooper standard Bob is held
[1439.6s] up it was actually green part of the day
[1441.799s] intel was green part of the day Crown
[1444.24s] Castle&#39;s been doing great so you know
[1446.12s] these are the opportunities and I put
[1449.32s] out on
[1450.72s] Twitter um gosh I didn&#39;t have any of
[1453.159s] this stuff queued
[1454.84s] up but let&#39;s see what we can do
[1460.0s] here first thing this morning when
[1462.52s] everyone was puking at the
[1467.12s] open I put this out and what I said
[1471.559s] was and this is something that you may
[1473.88s] want to print out I said private Equity
[1477.0s] Funds will take no markdowns today quote
[1479.679s] unquote markdowns today apartment owners
[1482.0s] will not fire sale their buildings today
[1484.919s] it&#39;s why Efficient Market Theory doesn&#39;t
[1487.84s] work if it did work I would be out of a
[1490.52s] job human nature never changes and
[1492.799s] that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been able to do what I
[1494.2s] have and that is never going to change
[1496.64s] ladies and gentlemen and it&#39;s during
[1498.12s] these periods of dislocation I mean this
[1500.0s] is really the only place you can get
[1502.159s] outperformance is if you&#39;re buying over
[1504.36s] the last 3 four weeks after you put in
[1506.6s] the first bottom in early March and then
[1509.48s] you you continue to add on the retest
[1512.12s] and now the follow through and the fake
[1514.08s] out and all that stuff if you&#39;re not
[1516.279s] buying when prices are crazy town and
[1518.36s] you have Force Sellers and margin clerks
[1520.96s] calling people up and forcing them out
[1522.679s] of the market you&#39;re just not going to
[1524.76s] outperform what today is is the closet
[1528.799s] indexers that have been jammed into mag
[1531.12s] 7 all caught with their pants down
[1533.48s] swimming naked and that&#39;s really what it
[1535.36s] comes down to why are the Biggest Losers
[1539.48s] of the Year mag
[1542.24s] 7 when most of them are largely
[1545.96s] unaffected by tariffs and the answer is
[1549.399s] is because they&#39;re all sheep and they
[1551.0s] all got slaughtered okay let&#39;s look at
[1553.679s] year to
[1556.36s] date look the whole Market is green and
[1560.48s] if you think the whole US market is
[1562.36s] green how about the Chinese market okay
[1565.919s] look at the Biggest Losers of the
[1568.52s] Year mag 7 Microsoft Apple Amazon Tesla
[1574.44s] Google meta Nvidia okay again go back to
[1579.0s] the June 20th article I wrote the next
[1581.52s] pain trade when Nvidia was 140 bucks and
[1585.32s] it went to 152 after I wrote the article
[1588.32s] and everyone said you&#39;re wrong and today
[1590.2s] it closed at
[1592.6s] $101 okay so this is all you need to
[1595.799s] know ladies and gentlemen if you were
[1597.919s] here because you have a fake manager
[1600.159s] that was closet indexing like a sheep
[1602.039s] and got slaughtered and the Market&#39;s
[1603.76s] down 5% and you&#39;re down 40% well that&#39;s
[1607.399s] all you need to know but if you have an
[1609.2s] actual manager who&#39;s got you in good
[1611.64s] quality stocks you are going to be great
[1613.64s] moving out okay and here&#39;s the here&#39;s
[1616.279s] the better news is all these closet
[1618.559s] indexers got forc liquidated in the last
[1620.76s] few weeks so when these technically
[1623.08s] bounce and these are going to Bounce by
[1624.52s] the way um they&#39;re not even going to be
[1627.919s] in it so they&#39;re going to miss it on the
[1629.32s] downside selling in the hole and they&#39;re
[1631.0s] going to miss it back on the upside and
[1632.32s] then they&#39;re going to buy back at the
[1633.36s] top of the range and as mag 7
[1635.399s] underperforms this year and goes back
[1637.08s] down after it gets to the top of the
[1638.36s] range they&#39;re going to get jammed again
[1640.52s] and and this is just history repeating
[1642.96s] over and over and over so as you can
[1645.76s] tell I&#39;m kind of going to add lib today
[1647.64s] because we&#39;re you know live in real time
[1650.399s] taking advantage of all this
[1653.559s] stuff and this is going to be a long one
[1655.919s] so you know if you don&#39;t want
[1657.84s] information to make money during crisis
[1659.64s] then then uh go watch Netflix but uh
[1662.399s] maybe it&#39; help their stock a little bit
[1664.519s] uh what did Netflix do
[1666.919s] today uh I don&#39;t know can&#39;t even find it
[1670.96s] but if it&#39;s mag7 it&#39;s probably down this
[1673.519s] year so leave it at that um we went
[1676.919s] through these indicators we went through
[1678.679s] this that this is unbelievable this
[1681.96s] nyud uh
[1684.08s] skew skew you know when skew gets down
[1686.559s] to this level you&#39;re pretty much
[1688.519s] bottomed because all the insurance plans
[1691.0s] out of the money insurance plans have
[1692.6s] cashed in or not um values continue to
[1696.12s] outperform growth this might be a
[1697.519s] short-term Peak maybe the tech starts to
[1699.12s] bounce and brings the indices up but
[1701.24s] let&#39;s look on a company by compan basis
[1703.44s] I mean this feels like the apocalypse
[1706.36s] for a lot of people that that have been
[1708.12s] stuck with closet indexing or actual
[1710.159s] indexing and and you just been passive
[1712.039s] and you finally got your your head
[1713.399s] handed to you um but like Boeing I mean
[1717.96s] I love it here it&#39;s does it go lower
[1719.96s] sure it could go lower it could go back
[1721.399s] to 138 but I mean if you&#39;re not starting
[1723.84s] to buy it here and you don&#39;t see two
[1725.6s] three years out this thing&#39;s a double
[1727.24s] then I I can&#39;t help you wrong podcast go
[1729.32s] for the shiny object podcast that all
[1732.159s] got you slammed into these and now you
[1734.799s] don&#39;t know which way is up because you
[1735.96s] were levered long all this garbage that
[1738.919s] has gotten smashed
[1742.72s] um moving along let&#39;s take a look stock
[1745.84s] by stock Disney we were in the market
[1747.519s] buying Disney today I mean we haven&#39;t
[1749.039s] had a chance to buy that in ages um Nike
[1752.64s] I got to tell you I mean where did Amman
[1754.679s] get in $78 now it&#39;s at
[1758.12s] 55 my guess is he was in the market
[1760.36s] buying today I can&#39;t speak for him but
[1762.6s] uh uh we like we like Brack and Daryl
[1765.24s] much better so so that&#39;s kind of where
[1766.96s] our Focus has been but but uh I I think
[1769.72s] you can&#39;t really go wrong in in the low
[1771.88s] 50s High 40s with that Disney
[1776.2s] uh caterpillars had a big run I mean
[1779.0s] even Microsoft this looks like it wants
[1780.84s] to to bounce technically JP Morgan these
[1784.08s] are not catastrophic moves these are
[1786.799s] really a lot of different opportunities
[1788.6s] let&#39;s look at some NASDAQ
[1790.519s] stocks Biogen has been cheap forever uh
[1793.48s] keeping my eye on that with biotech
[1795.48s] that&#39;s that&#39;s going we were in the
[1796.799s] market buying xbi
[1799.2s] um what
[1801.039s] else Nvidia new low this is probably the
[1803.96s] fake out to take out the final anyway uh
[1807.039s] meta getting smashed down from 725 to
[1809.88s] 525 I mean look I gotta be honest some
[1812.159s] of these are getting tempted but if I
[1813.519s] have my choice to buy meta or to buy
[1815.399s] PayPal we were buying the hell out of
[1817.279s] PayPal today I mean this is yeah Yu&#39;s
[1819.72s] threatening we&#39;re going to charge a
[1821.519s] tariff your payment people it hurts
[1823.48s] their own
[1824.919s] people if they do it they do it if they
[1827.08s] don&#39;t they don&#39;t the bottom line is the
[1828.72s] guy&#39;s going to buy back 20% of the
[1830.279s] company over the next 24 months it&#39;s a
[1832.519s] leading business if they get hurt their
[1834.2s] competitors are going to get hurt more
[1835.96s] at the end of the day it&#39;s what I tried
[1837.2s] to share with you last week which
[1840.96s] is if it hurts these companies that have
[1843.72s] a moe it hurts their competitors even
[1845.84s] more which means they&#39;re going to be
[1847.039s] able to consolidate them and buy them up
[1849.2s] and come out stronger so bigger
[1851.159s] companies Quality Companies and that&#39;s
[1853.08s] what I do in periods of dislocation I&#39;m
[1854.799s] not buying the lowest quality stuff that
[1856.96s] could actually get toasted
[1858.559s] I&#39;m buying some of the highest quality
[1860.48s] in their spaces so during these periods
[1863.08s] of dislocation they&#39;re actually the
[1865.0s] gainers they consolidate the weak people
[1867.519s] like Baba when China was uninvestable
[1869.96s] like Exxon Mobile during 2020 when oil
[1873.08s] went negative like Wells Fargo during
[1875.399s] the covid lows at 2510 highest quality
[1879.0s] in the periods of mass dislocation uh
[1882.039s] when Banks and energy were getting
[1883.48s] hammered uh last two years when China
[1886.159s] was getting hammered now you got sneaker
[1888.72s] companies getting hammered uh and
[1891.0s] everything else so this is like you know
[1894.24s] a day like
[1895.919s] this you know yeah look everyone gets
[1898.6s] hit by a mark to Market and and people
[1900.96s] think that matters but these days are
[1904.039s] like Christmas I mean people could not
[1906.24s] understand I was talking to the YPO
[1907.6s] group and they couldn&#39;t understand why I
[1909.399s] was giddy I was like listen I need to
[1911.0s] get off this call because 11:30 is
[1913.399s] coming up and the losers in Europe sell
[1915.84s] at 11:30 because they&#39;re chicken littles
[1917.6s] to go home long and uh and then I need
[1920.0s] to be around for 230 when the margin
[1921.799s] clerks hit up the US guys that are
[1923.6s] levered long on their zero dated options
[1925.88s] so when they&#39;re structurally blown up
[1927.279s] their account I can buy all the
[1928.799s] that they&#39;re forced to puke by the
[1930.0s] margin margin clerks and that just comes
[1933.519s] from experience and that just comes from
[1935.279s] knowing what you own and owning quality
[1937.12s] businesses so if the marks went another
[1940.039s] 10% lower would I be excited about that
[1943.639s] no I wouldn&#39;t be excited about that but
[1945.72s] would I be worried about that I would
[1948.399s] not be worried about that because if I
[1950.159s] look 12 24 36 months out based on the
[1953.039s] businesses that we own and we&#39;ve
[1954.679s] underwritten as if we own the entire
[1956.799s] company before we even buy one share of
[1958.639s] stock we are not tracing chasing price
[1961.399s] we are not doing magical technical
[1964.12s] analysis like Peter Navaro calling the
[1966.399s] bottom today because he used to be a
[1969.0s] CNBC contributor and he&#39;s an expert
[1971.72s] technical analyst commentator uh that&#39;s
[1974.6s] now working a $100,000 job after getting
[1976.84s] out of jail um you know
[1980.84s] so I I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel on
[1983.44s] the next podcast but leave it leave it
[1985.32s] there uh magnificent 7 relinquishes more
[1988.36s] than $1 trillion dollar as Tech Drive
[1991.08s] stock market nose
[1993.12s] dive
[1996.88s] um so look we spent three
[2000.799s] months saying lien up on mag 7 Canadian
[2004.639s] dollar climbs to four-month high after
[2006.6s] tariff reveal
[2008.559s] ladies it&#39;s finally happened did did the
[2010.48s] Canadian dollar go against us before it
[2012.2s] went for us yes but it&#39;s now moving up
[2014.799s] and I think it&#39;s going to persist so all
[2016.44s] the Canadians that are worried and angry
[2018.24s] at Trump don&#39;t worry you&#39;re going to be
[2020.159s] fine okay all the Mexicans you&#39;re going
[2022.559s] to be fine don&#39;t worry about it it&#39;s
[2024.48s] going to work itself out uh I&#39;d Bel long
[2027.279s] L Looney you guys are going to have huge
[2029.519s] purchasing power over the next 12 to 24
[2032.159s] months the Tariff thing will get
[2033.799s] resolved you have natural resources
[2035.919s] you&#39;re a great country you&#39;re a great
[2038.44s] you got great leaders like Wayne Gretzky
[2040.679s] I&#39;m joking not joking uh and and you
[2043.96s] don&#39;t need to become a state to be
[2045.279s] amazing you&#39;re already amazing we love
[2046.919s] you I know we have a lot of Canadian
[2048.8s] listeners all right let&#39;s get down to
[2050.399s] business here we&#39;ve got uh number one
[2053.48s] thing you want to look at during periods
[2054.8s] of Crisis is high yield credit spreads
[2057.32s] and a quick proxy for that is just take
[2060.2s] a quick look at
[2061.679s] jnk credit markets are not seizing up
[2064.599s] despite fear being at record all-time
[2066.599s] highs worse than during the great
[2069.32s] financial crisis lows and the covid lows
[2071.839s] if if a aii bearish sentiment is of any
[2075.079s] importance to
[2076.2s] you we&#39;re effectively back to the levels
[2079.679s] we were in high yield uh at the
[2081.919s] beginning of the year so not much to
[2084.119s] worry about if it shoots down here we
[2086.24s] start to get a little bit more concerned
[2088.079s] and and uh maybe adjust accordingly but
[2090.639s] at the moment all good in the hood uh
[2094.24s] next is S&amp;P 500 I love the undercut you
[2097.4s] of see test then overshoots and
[2100.56s] undercuts during major bottoms here we
[2103.079s] are could it go a lot lower sure it
[2104.64s] could go a lot lower would I bet on
[2107.92s] it I think it&#39;s going to work itself out
[2110.24s] in the next week or or so if not sooner
[2113.96s] and I love this undercut because it
[2115.52s] forced all the the remaining hands to
[2119.88s] capitulate um we can go back 20 years
[2122.92s] and everyone says you know we&#39;re going
[2125.119s] to go back and retest the loads you
[2126.4s] never really go back and ret test lows
[2128.24s] you tend to break down to get everyone
[2131.079s] out and then you open
[2133.079s] up higher uh after doing that whether
[2136.119s] it&#39;s on a weekly or monthly well guess
[2137.72s] what R TLT speaking of which a friend
[2141.04s] emailed uh texted me today and said that
[2143.76s] his new one of his clients just got
[2147.32s] a 7-year adjustable armm ARM
[2152.64s] mortgage at
[2156.24s] 5.1% 7 % arm at
[2161.359s] 5.1% uh and that is a firsttime home
[2165.079s] buyer
[2166.68s] 5.1% mortgage for the next seven years
[2169.2s] for a firsttime home buyer so housing is
[2173.8s] going to be the name of the game
[2176.88s] and when 10-year yield got to 480 we
[2181.64s] everyone was saying five we were saying
[2183.2s] three handle before four well here we
[2185.319s] are at four we&#39;re going to hit a three
[2187.0s] handle and we&#39;re going to start to see
[2188.8s] high fives on the 30-year mortgage and
[2191.2s] housing is going to rip which was our
[2193.4s] article of the week uh home site home
[2196.56s] which we&#39;re going to cover dollar how
[2198.92s] excited are we the dollar is collapsing
[2201.4s] is it it&#39;s just getting started ladies
[2203.76s] and gentlemen this is going to go a lot
[2206.4s] lower so all you folks with the loonies
[2208.56s] out there Rock and Roll Baby save your
[2210.92s] cash you&#39;re going to have some serious
[2212.56s] purchasing power around the world this
[2214.64s] is the beginning just like we saw in
[2217.28s] when
[2218.319s] 2001 this is going to continue to
[2220.48s] downtrend the US dollar and like we
[2223.04s] talked about last week this may be a
[2225.079s] precursor part of the negotiation with
[2227.16s] the tariffs hit them in the in the
[2230.76s] forehead and then say okay well if you
[2233.28s] don&#39;t like tariffs let&#39;s both go to zero
[2235.56s] and you&#39;re going to stop manipulating
[2237.0s] your currency and we&#39;re going to revalue
[2239.16s] the US dollar like we did in the plaza
[2240.92s] Accord uh in the 80s under Reagan we&#39;re
[2243.44s] going to do the exact same thing and
[2244.8s] we&#39;ll take down the tariffs and boom
[2246.319s] We&#39;re Off to the Races so
[2248.56s] all of these things are on the table and
[2250.16s] if you&#39;re not positioned and I&#39;m not
[2252.04s] saying you know lever long s S&amp;P but buy
[2256.359s] a handful of great businesses that you
[2258.44s] love that are already pricing in the
[2261.0s] apocalypse and just sit tight and don&#39;t
[2263.28s] do it on any major leverage or any major
[2265.44s] margin modest so that you can sit
[2268.04s] through any fluctuations of the next few
[2270.16s] weeks and not get shaken out like so
[2271.72s] many people today and you&#39;re going to
[2273.4s] thank me later and and it&#39;s rinse and
[2275.24s] repeat over and over and if days like
[2277.52s] today didn&#39;t exist there&#39;s no way any
[2279.76s] manager can get significant
[2281.119s] outperformance if you&#39;re not in a
[2282.839s] position to be able to buy during during
[2284.72s] times like the last few weeks where they
[2286.72s] served up unbelievable businesses at
[2289.319s] generationally uh advantageous prices
[2291.72s] and we took advantage and we pounced
[2293.48s] every red day and today was another day
[2295.839s] that we&#39;re taking advantage of so um
[2299.359s] that&#39;s a put call not all of these are
[2300.76s] up to date but look you you start to see
[2304.0s] levels of extremes that become buying
[2306.48s] opportunities for the people that are
[2308.359s] informed and paying attention major
[2310.72s] buying opportunities major buying
[2314.119s] opportunities uh NASDAQ up down I think
[2317.04s] NASDAQ gets a bounce here I think the
[2318.8s] mag s&#39;s going to get a bounce I think it
[2320.44s] trades to the top of the range in coming
[2322.04s] months and then everyone jumps in at the
[2324.4s] top and it goes back down mag 7 under
[2326.76s] performs this year China outperforms
[2329.079s] been saying the same thing next few
[2330.56s] months may look a little different but
[2333.44s] uh when we get to December that will be
[2335.24s] the outcome in our view um
[2338.28s] small caps we&#39;re buying today I mean you
[2340.52s] know it&#39;s you got to skate to where the
[2342.4s] Puck&#39;s going not where it&#39;s already been
[2345.079s] National Association puked in the hole
[2347.079s] could they puke more of course they
[2348.599s] could uh they might be forced to puke a
[2350.72s] lot of the closet indexer that were all
[2352.24s] mag seven they&#39;re they&#39;re just getting
[2353.76s] roasted all the FAS that have all these
[2356.24s] index funds I mean their clients are
[2358.44s] calling them all day long they don&#39;t
[2359.8s] know what they own they&#39;re just like
[2361.04s] it&#39;s going down what should we do I
[2362.359s] don&#39;t know what do you want to do what
[2363.319s] do you want to do what do you want to do
[2364.56s] I don&#39;t know what should I do boss what
[2366.76s] should I do CU they&#39;re asset gatherers
[2369.24s] it&#39;s a it&#39;s a whole different game S&amp;P
[2371.88s] 500 bullish percent okay this is a level
[2375.48s] again where you start to find bottoms
[2378.319s] okay same thing by the way at the
[2380.24s] beginning of March okay and that&#39;s it
[2382.56s] you&#39;re retesting now you broke through
[2384.8s] could you Cascade waterfall all the way
[2387.04s] down and it&#39;s 1930 Holly smooth and the
[2389.8s] world is ending yeah depends which radio
[2392.2s] it depends which TV station you tune
[2393.96s] into if you&#39;re tuning into MSNBC we&#39;re
[2396.359s] in a Great Depression and uh you know
[2398.839s] buy gold and guns uh you know if you
[2402.16s] know what you own and you understand
[2404.0s] what&#39;s going on you&#39;re probably saying
[2406.119s] where can I take advantage of this
[2407.76s] opportunity uh n mlen summation index
[2412.319s] um uh NASDAQ again towards levels where
[2416.64s] you buy you make
[2419.28s] money same with the NY NYSC summation
[2423.119s] index same story the retest boom retest
[2427.68s] boom so these are levels again it pays
[2431.0s] to be a selective buyer versus a seller
[2434.92s] okay vix popped up over 30 could it go
[2438.2s] to 38 before it goes back down to 15
[2440.599s] sure it could uh would I bet on it I
[2443.599s] don&#39;t know I I I I&#39;m not I&#39;m really not
[2446.2s] worried about that I&#39;m not worried about
[2447.88s] owning Boeing at $140 or $150 they
[2451.76s] they&#39;re in they&#39;re in a duopoly so if
[2453.839s] you can tell me people aren&#39;t going to
[2455.079s] fly because of tariffs then I&#39;ll listen
[2457.52s] but they&#39;ve got a half a trillion
[2458.64s] dollars of backlog what if it goes to
[2460.24s] 400 billion am I going to lose sleep no
[2463.44s] okay I&#39;m going to take advantage and and
[2465.72s] seize these opportunities okay moving
[2469.72s] along uh most of the quotes of the day
[2472.56s] most of the time Common Stocks are
[2474.28s] subject to irrational and excessive
[2475.88s] price fluctuations in both directions as
[2477.52s] the consequence of the ingrain tendency
[2479.56s] of most people to speculate or gamble
[2482.0s] not knowing what they own chasing price
[2484.04s] versus value to give way to Hope fear
[2486.48s] and greed that&#39;s from Benjamin Graham
[2488.839s] Warren Buffett&#39;s teacher and the legend
[2491.2s] John D Rockefeller the way to make money
[2493.04s] is to buy when blood is running in the
[2494.599s] streets there was blood running in the
[2496.119s] streets there were forced liquidations
[2497.839s] today you had some people calling their
[2500.4s] financial advisors and all their index
[2502.64s] funds saying get me out at any price I
[2504.88s] voted for Kala and then you had other
[2507.44s] people like Marlin who uh first email in
[2509.96s] the morning and there were others by the
[2511.56s] way uh which I&#39;m very grateful for
[2514.079s] saying uh you know buy everything you
[2516.4s] can on margin I&#39;ll send you seven
[2517.96s] figures tomorrow to to take the margin
[2520.0s] down and there you go you know and he&#39;s
[2522.28s] gonna 12 months out it&#39;s probably going
[2524.24s] to be one of the top performing accounts
[2526.24s] of all of them because he took advantage
[2527.92s] of today so uh does the market does not
[2532.16s] beat them they beat themselves because
[2534.28s] though they have brains they cannot sit
[2536.44s] tight that&#39;s Jesse
[2538.92s] Livermore moving along in uh pod chart
[2542.559s] so lip bhan addressed the Intel Vision
[2546.119s] 2025 yesterday and he outlined his top
[2548.92s] priorities focus on engineering Talent
[2551.04s] particularly tied to
[2553.48s] dcii uh execute on Panther Lake and
[2556.359s] iteratively improve yields improve
[2559.0s] Foundry more details to come expand
[2561.559s] product portfolio into verticals lean on
[2563.559s] purpose built silicon as a secular theme
[2566.0s] desktop software to support AI
[2567.839s] application layer that is critically
[2570.2s] important because that is what everyone
[2572.64s] said was nvidia&#39;s mode was they had the
[2575.76s] software kind of like the app wall
[2577.96s] Walled Garden this guy is the master of
[2580.44s] it Cadence designs was the software that
[2583.64s] all chip designers used to develop when
[2587.599s] he built that built out that company so
[2589.4s] now he&#39;s going to do it proprietary
[2591.48s] inside of Intel coupled with The Foundry
[2594.16s] business this is going to be a legendary
[2597.0s] turnaround story uh in my view okay this
[2600.52s] is uh from our friends over at
[2602.96s] steel uh looking at country by country
[2606.48s] for each company so like you know
[2608.599s] Vietnam got super high tariffs VF Corp
[2611.599s] has exposure there 26% of their exposure
[2613.92s] is Vietnam so 15 only 15 in China I
[2617.44s] would have thought it&#39;s a lot more than
[2618.68s] I would have thought they were like 80%
[2620.079s] China so uh that&#39;s kind of good news but
[2623.079s] could they move you know this 26% to
[2626.0s] Bangladesh where the tariffs are lower
[2628.28s] sure why not give the Bangladeshi some
[2630.48s] business uh move on March didn&#39;t pan out
[2633.8s] but April is historically one of the
[2635.319s] best months uh that&#39;s from Brian
[2637.44s] Dietrich so let&#39;s see what happens here
[2639.64s] that that would be consistent with
[2640.72s] everything we&#39;ve been talking about if
[2642.28s] you remember on March 11th I was on vne
[2645.119s] and Co which I&#39;m going to be no that&#39;s
[2647.4s] the following week never mind um I might
[2649.72s] be tomorrow morning but everything is in
[2651.4s] flocks more likely than not I won&#39;t be
[2654.599s] um and I said they should come up with a
[2657.2s] website and just show item by item how
[2660.599s] much do they tax Us and how much do we
[2663.0s] tax them and that&#39;s exactly what they
[2664.48s] did it sounds like Trump and some of his
[2667.4s] uh advisers watch vanney on Fox Business
[2670.599s] cuz they laid it out pretty clearly okay
[2673.16s] what do they tariff us what are we going
[2675.68s] to tariff them back and in most if not
[2677.52s] all cases other than the low end at
[2679.88s] 10% uh it was we came back with about
[2682.48s] 50% of what they do to us so it&#39;s not
[2684.72s] reciprocal it&#39;s not uh that but it&#39;s
[2689.0s] it&#39;s in a Direction that&#39;s going to
[2690.599s] generate 600 billion plus which is get
[2693.48s] get ready for the next phase so he said
[2696.599s] today in a
[2698.0s] tweet he said the operation is over now
[2701.119s] the patient can heal um you know and
[2704.92s] depending what TV stations you watch you
[2707.16s] said no yeah the operation&#39;s over and
[2709.359s] they&#39;re carrying the patient out in a
[2711.0s] body bag well that was the case for some
[2713.88s] people today uh but more likely than not
[2716.88s] the patients are going to start to heal
[2719.52s] and the new narrative prospectively will
[2722.2s] be one probably a couple of deals will
[2724.68s] be done even though Mr technical
[2726.64s] analysis himself Mr Navaro said that
[2728.839s] that wouldn&#39;t be the case two minutes
[2730.52s] later Trump said it would
[2734.28s] um the next phase is going to be we&#39;ve
[2738.44s] paid for the tax cuts and they&#39;re going
[2740.96s] to do one of the largest tax cuts again
[2743.88s] extending the existing and adding some
[2746.119s] more tax cuts you couple that with
[2748.079s] deregulation now you&#39;ve got growth it&#39;s
[2750.44s] paid
[2751.319s] for uh and that&#39;s that where where they
[2755.44s] are now going to probably be willing to
[2757.96s] cut a few deals is because they do not
[2761.0s] want to wind up in recession because if
[2763.119s] they wind up in recession on average it
[2764.8s] takes 2% of GDP to bail them out of
[2768.079s] recession so the last thing you want to
[2769.88s] do if you&#39;re trying to cut all these
[2772.52s] deficits and cut spending is force the
[2775.599s] country into a recession uh where you
[2778.119s] have to spend you know 4 or500 billion
[2780.24s] dollar to get a get us out of a
[2781.8s] recession so they&#39;re cognizant that I
[2783.72s] guess they&#39;ll cut just enough deals to
[2785.52s] get the market excited Trump said as
[2787.559s] much today he wants to see the stock
[2789.079s] market do really really really well he
[2791.92s] has a strange way of showing it um but
[2795.52s] uh get ready for growth narrative growth
[2799.599s] narrative being tax cuts deregulation
[2802.68s] and tariffs in the rearview mirror
[2804.24s] because that&#39;s largely
[2806.16s] done uh here&#39;s a chart to pay attention
[2809.319s] to this is the tariffs done to date uh I
[2813.359s] don&#39;t know if this is accurate but
[2815.2s] basically if 100% of these are
[2816.92s] implemented and there are no concessions
[2819.24s] it takes it back up to to 1909 levels
[2822.28s] which is basically where it was for 100
[2824.68s] plus years before the turn of the 19th
[2828.079s] before the turn of the 20th
[2830.04s] century uh I don&#39;t
[2835.0s] think that this is where we&#39;re going to
[2837.04s] wind up but it&#39;s something to watch and
[2838.8s] it&#39;s something that all the
[2843.24s] the people that are extremely concerned
[2847.16s] uh have in their quiver and it&#39;s not
[2850.0s] something that we&#39;re blind to so we&#39;ll
[2852.88s] see where this thing shakes out uh hard
[2855.8s] and soft data have diverged so this is
[2859.68s] what&#39;s actually happening versus so
[2862.52s] conference board expecting fewer jobs a
[2864.4s] lot of people are nervous uh the initial
[2866.48s] jobless claims are not yet confirming
[2868.28s] that we will see tomorrow what I will
[2870.559s] say is critically interesting which
[2872.96s] we&#39;re going to get to is uh fed is now
[2875.04s] at 85% chance of a cut in June
[2882.04s] um here are my incredible mugs by the
[2884.88s] way all of you are asking for Merch uh
[2887.76s] uh thanks to Stephen F who does all the

[2912.119s] Jake Capel still another sigh gentle
[2915.04s] reminder the nature of investor
[2916.44s] sentiment bad is ultimately good
[2918.68s] consumers are certain unemployment is
[2920.319s] headed higher could they be right this
[2921.68s] time sure will they be decide for
[2923.16s] yourself so every time they got this
[2925.04s] nervous which one of those times was
[2926.76s] 2001 which we continue to reference as a
[2930.319s] very interesting parallel for a lot of
[2931.839s] the stuff that we&#39;re doing uh it was a
[2934.4s] buying opportunity of the century 2009
[2936.799s] did you want to buy stocks yes 2002 did
[2938.839s] you want to buy stocks yes early 90s uh
[2941.72s] recession did you want to buy stocks
[2944.16s] yes okay so that is an
[2947.11s] [Music]
[2950.799s] opportunity just kind of year to date
[2953.44s] returns all the last sh be First
[2955.52s] Healthcare is up at the top
[2957.04s] International&#39;s up at the top Energy&#39;s
[2958.96s] outperformed com Stock&#39;s been on a tear
[2961.319s] uh so we&#39;re super happy about that gold
[2963.319s] is outperformed so all the end of the
[2964.92s] worlders are super happy congrat
[2967.4s] rations um just you know not what we do
[2970.96s] but you know kudos to those people who
[2972.76s] do that uh equities aggregate in
[2976.559s] institutional net
[2980.92s] flows long only have been puking in the
[2983.599s] hole hedge funds puking in the Hole uh
[2986.96s] opinion follows Trend so they were all
[2988.559s] buying at the top selling in the hole so
[2991.68s] you know you got to decide what you want
[2993.119s] to do uh on that Prime book record lows
[2996.72s] just
[2998.839s] like so that&#39;s that uh ECB survey change
[3003.76s] in demand for loans that&#39;s going up not
[3012.2s] down Auto tariffs could reignite used
[3014.839s] car prices in Auto Repair business
[3016.559s] that&#39;s where Advanced Auto Part start to
[3019.16s] starts to flourish again uh retail
[3022.48s] purchases of Mag 7 bought the top as
[3025.2s] always uh you retail sales continue to
[3028.24s] recover which is good for gxo us Equity
[3031.599s] sentiment indicator washed at very low W
[3034.76s] Street currency Watchers see dollar
[3036.2s] losses ahead so now opinions following
[3038.44s] Trend but as we saw in the long-term
[3040.52s] chart I think this trend is just
[3042.359s] beginning weaker and weaker dollar
[3043.96s] benefits International uh we&#39;ve been
[3046.24s] pounding the table and what you&#39;ve seen
[3048.48s] in the beginning of this year probably
[3049.88s] breathe for a little bit but it&#39;s just
[3051.72s] the beginning of a multi- multi-year
[3053.799s] International versus us outperformance
[3058.2s] kind of
[3059.24s] ironic that us
[3061.92s] Equity exceptionalism will have peaked
[3066.44s] with the Advent of
[3069.72s] um the new
[3071.96s] Administration and I don&#39;t think that
[3074.48s] speaks poorly of the new administration
[3076.079s] at all and part of it&#39;s just the person
[3079.2s] sitting in the seat uh like I said I
[3082.599s] think the economy is going to do better
[3084.88s] than ever and I think the middle class
[3086.64s] the people who haven&#39;t participated in
[3088.16s] asset price appreciation are going to do
[3090.16s] better than ever I think passive
[3092.2s] indexers are going to be less happy I
[3095.04s] think stock Pickers are going to have
[3096.52s] the time of their lives uh like the
[3098.559s] early 2000s like the 70s when gabelli
[3101.24s] and cooperman and Buffett made their
[3102.76s] fortunes Market went sideways for 12
[3104.96s] years and they uh so generally very very
[3109.88s] constructive um and it it&#39;s not to speak
[3112.4s] to the policies because I I really do
[3114.079s] think you&#39;re going to get that
[3114.96s] excitement you saw in the first term
[3117.0s] from an economic standpoint with every
[3118.68s] man on the street super happy having
[3120.88s] jobs having higher
[3122.64s] pay um but making money in the markets
[3125.799s] you&#39;re going to have to have an
[3126.64s] advantage you&#39;re G to have to have some
[3128.119s] International you&#39;re going to have to
[3129.24s] know what you own and I think the the
[3131.28s] the way the you know non mag s stocks
[3135.96s] are set up and other opportunities and
[3137.92s] even small caps coming back is going to
[3139.88s] be it&#39;s going to be lights out the next
[3142.119s] 5 years I mean lights out in a good way
[3144.68s] for opportunity and uh and then the
[3146.88s] window will close and it&#39;ll be done so
[3149.079s] Prime book infotech versus total us
[3151.64s] exposure so again this is getting washed
[3154.0s] out here
[3160.16s] um I do think Tech probably starts to
[3163.88s] bounce value versus
[3166.359s] growth value&#39;s been
[3169.52s] outperforming 23% of stocks beat growth
[3174.04s] Benchmark beating Russell 1,000 growth
[3176.48s] index based on trailing 12 months so
[3178.88s] this is kind of what you see when you
[3180.2s] want to be a
[3182.96s] buyer magnificent 7 to lag magnificent 7
[3187.44s] magnificent 7 market cap as a percentage
[3189.599s] of S&amp;P has now dropped from 35% down to
[3192.48s] 30% boy that was quick um wow that is
[3197.2s] unbelievable how quickly that&#39;s and it
[3199.96s] probably going to Trend even further
[3202.44s] down even if we get a technical bounce
[3204.76s] stocks at record 29% of us household
[3207.079s] Financial assets buying the top no
[3210.559s] International exposure common theme
[3212.52s] that&#39;s going to change very quickly and
[3213.839s] a lot of that money is going to flow
[3214.88s] into
[3216.72s] International next slowdown coming in
[3219.24s] global semiconductor
[3221.16s] sales um we talked about Nvidia in June
[3224.68s] saying this is a cyclical business I
[3226.319s] think the one play that&#39;s going to be
[3228.119s] doing well while the rest are suffering
[3229.599s] is going to be Intel why because every
[3232.319s] other chip maker depends on the kindness
[3234.319s] of strangers with Taiwan semiconductor
[3236.64s] Intel is going to be a producer of chips
[3239.119s] not just a designer of chips and they&#39;re
[3241.52s] going to start to take share from Taiwan
[3243.24s] semiconductor because Trump&#39;s going to
[3244.559s] make sure of it whether he likes Intel
[3246.72s] or not which I think he will I think
[3248.319s] he&#39;s going to love lip Buu tan and uh as
[3252.72s] he would say because lip ban is a winner
[3255.839s] and Trump loves winners so uh expect
[3259.319s] good things from Intel even if this
[3260.88s] cycle slows down they&#39;re going to be
[3262.359s] taking share from monopolistic producer
[3265.839s] Taiwan semiconductor um or partnering
[3268.96s] with them as we saw in the information
[3270.559s] which is even better American Stock
[3272.079s] it&#39;ll just accelerate the process
[3273.319s] American stocks worth quarter in 23
[3275.319s] years relative to International that&#39;s
[3277.64s] been our theme get out of Mag 7 get
[3279.44s] inter International it all showed up at
[3281.359s] once in the first quarter uh and that&#39;s
[3283.839s] super
[3286.44s] exciting us fundamental long short net
[3289.16s] leverage so they&#39;ve just absolutely
[3290.88s] gotten smoked gotten out of all leverage
[3293.48s] that&#39;s why mag 7 is smoked they&#39;re just
[3295.24s] liquidating out getting redeemed out and
[3297.88s] bleeding on the carpet and um and that
[3300.559s] usually creates the the vacuum to for
[3302.96s] smart buyers to step in here is the
[3305.359s] five-week moving average of the a aii
[3307.88s] bearish sentiment index it is worse than
[3311.92s] during the covid lows worse than during
[3315.119s] the great financial crisis lows the
[3317.64s] worst going all the way back to uh the
[3322.839s] 2022 lows and then prior to that going
[3326.079s] back to the 1989 1990 recession lows
[3330.72s] there&#39;s bearish as they can get so you
[3332.4s] can tell me that I don&#39;t want to be a
[3334.4s] buyer when everyone else is bearish and
[3336.64s] I&#39;d say okay well you&#39;re part of the
[3338.039s] herd but you don&#39;t get these type of
[3341.16s] returns by buying when no one wants to
[3343.599s] in the hole when everyone else is
[3345.559s] pessimistic
[3347.079s] um a bad March could mean a better April
[3350.68s] so this is from Carson when you have
[3352.839s] these
[3353.599s] horrible uh marches April is on average
[3358.2s] up anywhere from two you know 1% to 133%
[3363.039s] with an average of 2.9% and a median of
[3367.76s] 2% so if you think about the indices
[3370.28s] rallying 3% you start to think about
[3372.599s] individual names rallying 15 20 30% and
[3376.079s] for folks like Marlin who uh woke up
[3379.16s] this morning and saw opportunity and put
[3381.0s] out his bucket kudos to you 12 months I
[3383.92s] look I can&#39;t tell you where Marlin&#39;s
[3385.28s] going to be 12 days from now or even 12
[3388.28s] weeks from now but I can tell you 12
[3389.799s] months from now he&#39;s going to look back
[3391.72s] at that email and and realize what a
[3393.96s] what a rockstar he was and for the new
[3396.039s] people that have been coming in today
[3397.559s] the new inquiries to get in uh before we
[3399.52s] close out this q1 Q2 opening uh we&#39;re
[3403.079s] going to close out on the 12th so nine
[3405.0s] days left um they&#39;ll they&#39;ll have the
[3408.16s] same exact thing and the existing
[3409.799s] clients we&#39;ve been topping up you guys
[3413.039s] are so well positioned look I can&#39;t get
[3416.24s] brand new people in the spreads on Baba
[3419.799s] that we did a year and a half ago that
[3421.599s] are up huge uh millions of dollars in
[3425.4s] aggregate but that&#39;s the way it goes you
[3428.799s] know but I can get them in other incred
[3431.52s] incredible opportunities just like you
[3433.16s] know if you&#39;re fully invested I can&#39;t
[3434.559s] get you you know in uh you know a a ton
[3438.76s] of VF Corp at $3 but you already have it
[3442.24s] at $15 so or $16 so it&#39;s you know it&#39;s
[3445.16s] it&#39;s it&#39;s just opportunities Galore so
[3449.0s] let&#39;s look at um price to earnings
[3453.16s] here nasdaq&#39;s valuation Retreat so it&#39;s
[3455.96s] gone from 37 times earnings down
[3459.88s] to uh 22 times so if you remember I
[3463.039s] spent five weeks going on TV in December
[3465.4s] and January saying mag 7 earning PES 33
[3470.16s] 35 times their earnings grow
[3472.079s] decelerating from 33% down to 16% the
[3475.68s] multiple doesn&#39;t come down well guess
[3477.079s] what just happened the multiple came
[3478.44s] down probably comes down a little bit
[3479.96s] more and then you get your huge
[3482.119s] technical
[3487.119s] bounces moving
[3489.92s] along all country World performance so
[3493.0s] obviously outperformance of
[3494.359s] international reemphasized
[3499.28s] there consensus earnings growth the
[3501.799s] biggest consensus earnings growth
[3503.4s] expectations are small cap and they have
[3504.92s] the lowest multiple and you can&#39;t give
[3506.52s] them away I was buying that today so
[3509.24s] okay into other people&#39;s
[3510.799s] selling that&#39;s we went through this with
[3513.599s] Baba ladies and gentlemen and that&#39;s why
[3515.16s] we have a basis of $82 $83 because every
[3517.88s] red day we had an opportunity to sell in
[3521.48s] the hole like 99% of the people who
[3523.44s] listen to the cell side telling you
[3525.16s] uninvestable or the 1% who are backing
[3527.96s] up the truck in the 60s and many of you
[3530.64s] have benefited from being part of the 1%
[3532.559s] who are backing up the truck in the 60s
[3534.44s] with your White Knuckles and all we all
[3536.119s] had a little bit of White Knuckles but
[3537.64s] we sucked it up and we knew what we own
[3539.24s] and we had $80 billion of cash on the
[3540.76s] balance sheet trading at 10 times
[3542.119s] forward starting a recovery and uh and
[3545.319s] it&#39;s just beginning so uh same thing is
[3547.799s] going to happen here uh S&amp;P returns
[3550.559s] following a 10% correction 12 months out
[3552.76s] on average up 12% without a recession I
[3555.319s] think we&#39;re not going to have a
[3556.52s] recession maybe we get one quarter of
[3558.2s] negative GDP but uh I wouldn&#39;t hold my
[3560.92s] breath uh hard data versus soft data so
[3563.72s] that&#39;s a bullish sign to keep it in mind
[3565.799s] the real data versus the sentiment is
[3567.92s] still holding in just
[3575.92s] fine
[3577.559s] us okay US versus non- US Stocks have
[3581.799s] alternated outperformance this I&#39;ve been
[3584.4s] emphasizing for many months three four
[3587.96s] months people say us exceptionalism is
[3590.52s] going to last forever I don&#39;t care if
[3592.92s] Jesus Christ himself became president in
[3595.16s] November the odds of us stock
[3598.92s] performance which has pulled forward a
[3600.76s] lot of returns in recent years
[3603.2s] continuing to outperform
[3606.039s] International would be very unlikely
[3609.24s] okay so as good or bad as you believe
[3611.24s] the policies are going to be for the
[3612.4s] next four years it doesn&#39;t mean that US
[3615.88s] Stocks have to outperform or
[3618.079s] underperform it&#39;s just the nature of the
[3620.44s] cycle okay so like 80
[3624.039s] 1964 to 1980 9 us was flat International
[3627.88s] dramatically outperformed 1989 to
[3632.2s] 2201 us dramatically outperformed
[3634.92s] International didn&#39;t then you had 20012
[3637.76s] 2002 to 2008 2009 international small C
[3642.2s] value outperformed then you&#39;ve had the
[3644.72s] zero interest rate policy once in a
[3646.72s] lifetime event from 2010 to 201 you know
[3651.2s] 22 uh us outperformed and that&#39;s
[3653.68s] changing now you&#39;re seeing the stimulus
[3655.2s] coming from China seeing the stimulus
[3657.2s] coming from Europe that&#39;s where the
[3658.76s] money is going to flow where there&#39;s
[3660.24s] liquidity not austerity cutting you know
[3663.119s] thousands of jobs in Doge which you know
[3665.2s] look has to be done but there are
[3667.28s] consequences you know if you&#39;re if
[3669.319s] you&#39;re austere you&#39;re going to attract
[3672.28s] detract Capital flows if you&#39;re
[3674.599s] accommodative and stimulative you&#39;re
[3676.119s] going to attract Capital flows China was
[3679.2s] austere for 3 years and then they
[3681.839s] flipped uh uh the switch when they had a
[3684.52s] bunch of 20% or 25 5-year-olds
[3686.319s] unemployed and starting social unrest
[3688.079s] they flipped and now Alibaba doubled
[3690.96s] okay and it&#39;s going to double again
[3693.72s] so these things run in Cycles here&#39;s uh
[3696.839s] auto sales for March blew the doors off
[3699.4s] Beyond any possible expectations so a
[3701.76s] little bit of pull forward but you&#39;re
[3703.52s] starting to get the price cuts which
[3705.319s] this may be slightly more sustainable
[3707.72s] than people actually think even with the
[3709.559s] tariffs why because the oems are going
[3711.76s] to eat the prices and they&#39;re going to
[3713.559s] subsidize the losses because
[3716.44s] they don&#39;t want to lose share in this
[3718.119s] environment and it finally got them out
[3719.799s] of their monopolistic sell above MSRP
[3723.68s] covid um uh laa palooza that they
[3727.16s] experienced that they thought they would
[3728.359s] be able to run forever and the the gig
[3731.2s] is up now it&#39;s going to be volumes low
[3732.839s] prices low margins and suppliers the
[3735.48s] arms dealers are going to start to win
[3737.44s] again ADP manufacturing jobs monthly
[3740.4s] increase so the question from this is is
[3743.64s] Trump&#39;s plan working manufacturing job
[3746.079s] are growing for the first time in 2
[3750.52s] years this doesn&#39;t say Wall Street jobs
[3752.96s] are growing it says manufacturing jobs
[3754.96s] are growing it doesn&#39;t say um White
[3758.88s] Collar jobs are growing it says everyday
[3761.88s] jobs are growing and that&#39;s a good thing
[3763.76s] for America so we should be celebrating
[3766.48s] this not on Twitter whining because your
[3769.52s] mag7 is 30% down because you couldn&#39;t
[3772.079s] read the writing on the wall uh that was
[3774.4s] pretty obvious to everyone that that was
[3776.079s] paying attention 3 four five months ago
[3778.359s] Wards Automotive US Auto Sales S I mean
[3781.359s] through the roof we haven&#39;t seen a level
[3783.079s] this High since uh going back to 2017 so
[3786.799s] let&#39;s see if we can maintain it up here
[3788.52s] because if we can the amount of money
[3791.279s] that Cooper is going to be spewing out
[3793.64s] over the next 12 to 24 months is going
[3795.599s] to be staggering uh tariffs are no
[3797.799s] tariffs the volumes are going to be
[3799.039s] through the
[3799.88s] roof
[3802.64s] um share repurchases what else do we we
[3805.96s] have
[3807.52s] here uh rare moment for Value
[3809.839s] outperforming growth another thing that
[3811.52s] we has been a key theme for us okay S&amp;P
[3814.279s] hit a one-year High last month but
[3815.68s] closed down more than 5% this month 3
[3818.48s] months later you&#39;re up on average 6.8%
[3821.039s] 12 6 months later
[3822.92s] 15.5% 9 months later 22.1 one year later
[3833.88s] 25.49 dollar rolling over more of
[3840.359s] that Bloomberg dollar spot euro is
[3844.92s] climbing 10-year government bond yield
[3847.52s] now close to I think it got below four
[3849.76s] for a minute today I&#39;m not sure but it&#39;s
[3851.24s] definitely at four and uh 5.1%
[3854.559s] seven-year arm mortgages wait till the
[3856.4s] 30-year fix hits a 5&#39;9 I&#39;ve been saying
[3858.68s] that and if you don&#39;t have exposure to
[3860.64s] the Home Building sector and I&#39;m not
[3862.279s] talking about buying home builders
[3863.44s] because they&#39;re going to be as screwed
[3864.48s] as GM and Ford in terms terms of margins
[3866.799s] I&#39;m talking about the arms dealers the
[3868.4s] building supply companies the generx of
[3870.72s] the world the Stanley Black and Deckers
[3872.24s] of the world the qxo qxo of the world
[3875.359s] Brad Brad Jacobs Home Building Supply
[3877.16s] rollups with Beacon Roofing as the
[3879.52s] platform
[3881.72s] company okay this is from when
[3886.44s] the nber
[3888.799s] recession announcement came as it
[3891.2s] relates to recessions and then the total
[3893.64s] return uh
[3897.119s] uh after up 60 okay if you wait for the
[3900.279s] robins to sing spring will be
[3907.0s] over recession start recession end okay
[3910.2s] so the the nber acknowledges recessions
[3913.119s] in the rearview mirror by the time they
[3914.559s] acknowledge a recession the Market&#39;s
[3916.4s] already up on average 6 61% over the
[3919.119s] next 15 months okay that&#39;s that&#39;s
[3921.279s] obvious here are the rate cut

[3924.839s] back up to 80
[3926.44s] 4% uh tomorrow&#39;s jobs report is critical
[3929.72s] we&#39;ll see if that comes in Weak uh or
[3932.64s] unemployment ticks up which wouldn&#39;t be
[3934.92s] really surprising uh given all the Doge
[3937.88s] and and um knock on effects of that uh
[3941.319s] then the fed&#39;s back in play and the
[3942.64s] market starts to probably like the idea
[3944.44s] of the FED being back in play and maybe
[3945.96s] you find a short-term bottom here or a
[3947.72s] bounce corporate America&#39;s buyback
[3949.68s] stalls on tariff uncertainty and also
[3952.559s] excess capex spend by the way because
[3955.119s] mag 7 was driving the buyback bus now
[3957.52s] they&#39;re spending it uh uh on unclear
[3961.359s] return on invested Capital which is why
[3963.079s] they&#39;re down and is crowding out
[3964.92s] BuyBacks another theme we&#39;ve been
[3966.48s] talking about on this podcast Challenger
[3969.279s] report announced job Cuts uh this is
[3971.92s] going through the roof so let&#39;s see if

[3989.24s] us a a period of uh value over growth
[3994.2s] and a period of small cap over large cap
[3996.64s] so coming to a theater near
[3999.88s] you Equity ETF still seen
[4003.64s] selling still seeing most almost three
[4007.48s] billion dollar a
[4011.279s] day defense spending us has been able to

[4110.239s] that you saw in the early 2000s then
[4112.08s] they got overweight by the time it peak
[4113.759s] in 20 2007 values uh dramatically
[4117.279s] underweight this is what you see in the
[4119.88s] early stages of a regime change China
[4122.44s] exports to consumption re
[4124.799s] reorientation so uh their exports have
[4127.4s] come down from 35% to 20 their
[4129.719s] consumption is starting to recover from
[4132.0s] 5% to now 39% and their goal is to make
[4134.92s] it 7 % uh Alibaba I think gets 40 cents
[4139.0s] on every dollar spent on consumption
[4141.08s] they get a toll through uh because of
[4143.52s] the amount of e-commerce that&#39;s done in

[4197.239s] and in in and in international and not

[4282.84s] Equity outperformance is in trouble
[4284.88s] American exceptionalism will never be in
[4287.28s] trouble why because we have the greatest
[4290.08s] from all over the world we are a nation
[4292.48s] of immigrants we are a nation of a
[4295.12s] Melting Pot of taking the best from

[4299.679s] have rule of law and free markets and uh
[4303.92s] and we&#39;re the innovators and we have
[4305.56s] natural resources so what else you want
[4307.28s] to talk about and we got oceans on both
[4309.6s] sides of our Coast which is a good thing
[4311.76s] from a defensive standpoint so yes our
[4315.679s] equities can underperform because they
[4317.52s] pull forward a lot of gains uh and they
[4319.679s] got too concentrated in a certain group
[4321.84s] of stocks that everyone crowded into the
[4325.199s] quote most crowded trade uh but they&#39;ll
[4327.8s] be fine they&#39;ll absolutely do just fine
[4331.28s] but International will do a lot better

[4358.639s] nvidia&#39;s best AI server there&#39;s a
[4361.88s] headline that wasn&#39;t on your bingo card
[4363.52s] on January 1st Intel&#39;s new CEO is known
[4366.96s] to under promise and overd deliver can
[4369.199s] we do it again look we covered him a
[4371.639s] couple weeks ago we&#39;re super excited
[4374.199s] about him being at the house and what he
[4376.0s] did at Cadence just go look at the chart
[4378.92s] ticker
[4380.159s] cdns Boeing stock is a new top pick at
[4383.88s] JP Morgan we agree exclusive buyout

[4395.36s] here&#39;s the manufacturing jobs is Trump&#39;s
[4398.0s] plans working ADP shows biggest jump in
[4401.48s] US manufacturing jobs since October 20
[4405.639s] 22 us 10year yield drops below 4% for
[4409.159s] the first time since Trump won home
[4411.8s] sweet home stock market and sentiment
[4413.96s] results uh so this is an update on qxo
[4418.12s] and the Beacon Roofing deal um Jeff did
[4421.96s] a good job going through the Dynamics of
[4424.48s] the business this is just the platform
[4426.36s] company but showing how roofs are not a
[4429.199s] discretionary expense and the age of the
[4431.84s] average home and the average commercial
[4433.92s] property in the US there&#39;s huge amounts
[4436.6s] of pent up demand for Beacon Roofing and
[4440.32s] that&#39;s why when Brad Jacobs said on
[4442.12s] oddlot&#39;s podcast that he&#39;s going to
[4443.639s] double eida uh he&#39;s going to double eida
[4446.92s] and then all the businesses he&#39;s going
[4448.679s] to be able to roll up tuck in and do
[4451.36s] like he did with XO with Waste
[4453.28s] Connections and
[4455.6s] um and it goes through all the details
[4458.32s] of his past successes and uh and how you
[4461.08s] have a chance to participate at the very
[4462.92s] beginning with QX x o we also wanted to
[4467.88s] talk about that theme as it relates to J
[4471.04s] and Stanley Black and&amp; Decker what you
[4472.56s] can see is us existing home sales and
[4476.36s] gener holdings so when this numberers
[4479.08s] down the stock goes down when this
[4480.56s] number goes back up the stock goes back
[4482.28s] up and this is going to
[4484.639s] absolutely completely go off the chart
[4487.44s] when you see a 59 handle with the amount
[4489.88s] of 80 something million 34 35y old
[4493.8s] Millennials starting families that want
[4495.84s] new houses and Trump opening up 500
[4498.56s] million Acres of federal land get your
[4500.96s] 1500 square fot KB Homes starter home
[4504.679s] along with an endangered elk in your
[4506.56s] backyard free of charge uh this is going
[4509.04s] to go through the roof and and when you
[4510.56s] live in the middle of nowhere you&#39;re
[4512.36s] definitely going to want a generator
[4513.84s] because you don&#39;t want to be stuck uh
[4515.8s] you know with uh endangered polar bears
[4519.04s] next to your house without power when
[4521.04s] the power goes out so uh gets windy out
[4523.44s] in those 500 uh million square miles of
[4527.6s] rural Western United States so that&#39;s
[4531.44s] what happens with gener generators
[4534.6s] that&#39;s what happens with Stanley Black
[4536.0s] and&amp; Decker DeWalt Stanley Craftsman all
[4539.44s] the tools used in construction when you
[4541.92s] see existing home sales Spike up guess
[4544.96s] what happens to uh this and what causes
[4547.679s] that to spike up number one is
[4549.0s] demographics which couldn&#39;t be better
[4550.679s] number two is affordability which is a
[4553.239s] function of the cost of capital which
[4554.56s] Isen right now telling you 5&#39;9 it&#39;s
[4557.6s] going to be through the roof how many
[4559.639s] homes are going to be bought and as that
[4561.6s] construction starts you&#39;re going to
[4562.76s] start to see new orders come in like
[4564.4s] crazy and that&#39;s going to happen very
[4566.88s] very fast and qxo is going to be a
[4568.96s] beneficiary here&#39;s the here&#39;s another
[4570.679s] way to looking at it 30-year fixed rate
[4572.52s] mortgage at 6.32 as it&#39;s ridden what&#39;s
[4575.56s] collapsed Stanley Black and&amp; Decker as
[4577.92s] it falls what happens Stanley Black and&amp;
[4580.48s] Decker rallies as mortgage rates fall
[4583.32s] same thing will happen with Stanley same
[4585.199s] thing will happen with gener same thing
[4587.0s] will happen with qxo and by the time you
[4588.92s] figure it out it&#39;s too late because
[4590.32s] they&#39;ve already all doubled so what
[4592.8s] we&#39;re were were we buying Stanley Black
[4594.4s] and&amp; Decker today you bet your ass we
[4596.52s] were buying Stanley Black and&amp; Decker
[4597.92s] like it was going out of style were we
[4599.76s] buying gener today you bet your bottom
[4602.92s] dollar we were buying gener today so
[4606.36s] that&#39;s how we do it um moving along us
[4610.639s] 10-year treasury yield rolling back over
[4613.679s] that is what mortgage rates price off of
[4617.84s] and um and that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get
[4620.08s] all these things all you need to do is
[4622.6s] be burdened by the facts by the way for
[4624.52s] all you burdened by the facts all 10

[4720.239s] or not it makes sense to buy gener uh
[4724.12s] this is the tech top 30 earnings
[4727.28s] revisions in the last 60 days have been
[4729.8s] revised down by
[4733.32s] 1.1% in the last 60 days so prices
[4736.8s] obviously moved a lot more than earnings
[4738.96s] communication Services revised down 19
[4741.84s] basis points uh for this year 99 basis
[4744.48s] points for next year during sandbagger
[4746.36s] season that&#39;s not bad there are going to
[4747.84s] be opportunities there uh we&#39;re paying
[4750.8s] attention we&#39;re not rigid we we we are
[4753.92s] you know it&#39;s funny we we&#39;re as flexible
[4756.28s] as they come when the opportunity sets
[4758.199s] up just like we were buying mag 7 in
[4760.679s] Fall of 2022 and selling in July of 202
[4765.08s] 24 uh will&#39;ll be buying again when the
[4767.639s] price is right and when it makes
[4769.96s] sense uh that&#39;s the economic data and
[4773.12s] then earnings have come down a little
[4774.36s] bit 269.99 so they started at 275
[4777.04s] they&#39;re down to 270 markets moved more
[4779.88s] than that so we&#39;re kind of okay so
[4782.4s] podcast is over now we&#39;re going to do
[4784.08s] ask me anything questions I&#39;m sure we
[4786.76s] got a lot of doozies this week from a
[4789.0s] lot of nervous Nellies out there I&#39;m not
[4791.12s] undermining that I get it people are
[4793.0s] nervous but if you&#39;re not on Leverage
[4794.44s] and know it&#39;s your own there&#39;s no reason
[4796.199s] to be nervous you should be excited and
[4797.96s] taken advantage so uh okay this is
[4801.679s] Johnny
[4804.36s] s am I missing something here retails
[4806.88s] are getting hammered today because of
[4808.159s] Vietnam tariffs where a lot of clothes
[4809.96s] are made as we saw with VF Corp is 15%
[4812.44s] move it to Bangladesh call it a day
[4816.6s] um and you would think that if people
[4818.679s] are buying fewer clothes that actually
[4820.199s] benefit from companies like Etsy and
[4822.04s] depop blah blah blah
[4825.199s] yeah etsy&#39;s fine etsy&#39;s fine we bought
[4827.639s] some yesterday today it was actually was
[4829.719s] it yesterday I don&#39;t know two days ago
[4831.239s] it was down to 46 then it rallied to 49
[4834.56s] on the tariffs and today was 4 it
[4836.56s] doesn&#39;t matter under $50 we a buyer
[4838.96s] they&#39;re buying in stock they&#39;re
[4840.159s] generating a ton of cash they&#39;ll
[4841.6s] continue to generate a ton of cash no
[4843.84s] you&#39;re not missing anything thanks for

[4847.0s] question uh next one is from Kyle CA KU
[4852.32s] C kta love your show
[4855.44s] and critically inform informative
[4858.08s] content you provide I&#39;m bullish on
[4860.0s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker wondering the
[4862.719s] Tariff implications on the share price
[4864.36s] blah blah blah look at the end of the
[4866.48s] day they&#39;re getting tariffed so is their
[4869.6s] competition so they&#39;re the biggest game
[4872.12s] in town they have the best tools if you
[4874.6s] think someone&#39;s going to stand up a
[4875.96s] brand new tool company that&#39;s going to
[4877.639s] compete with the Walt when generations

[5075.239s] the IV space they own that little area
[5078.76s] they got rid of the kidney business you
[5080.44s] can&#39;t even see this move on the chart
[5082.199s] it&#39;s been building a bottom for two
[5083.679s] years because that&#39;s how long it takes
[5085.199s] to build a bottom it&#39;s no different than
[5086.84s] any other time uh CCI has been up it
[5090.56s] shot up from 90 to 170 the last couple
[5092.84s] weeks why because of rates so this
[5094.4s] things just getting started they got rid
[5096.239s] of the CEO they sold off the uh High
[5099.32s] Capital intensive low return fiber
[5101.239s] business and now they&#39;ve got the the
[5102.96s] towers that just meant money this is
[5104.44s] going to continue to go higher and going
[5106.159s] to continue to pay you a beautiful
[5107.56s] dividend while you wait Cooper standard
[5109.28s] shockingly hasn&#39;t even been affected by
[5111.719s] this I mean it&#39;s been stuck in this
[5113.239s] range for basically two years and what
[5115.44s] we&#39;re seeing with the car volumes the
[5117.239s] cash is going to spew out it&#39;s going to
[5118.679s] surprise everyone and this thing will be
[5120.08s] over 20 in no time and then start to
[5122.76s] really work on some of the numbers we
[5124.36s] talked about with our beautiful
[5125.44s] interview with the CEO Jeff Edwards two
[5128.199s] weeks ago check that out at uh go to
[5130.84s] YouTube Type in hedge fund tips look for
[5132.8s] the interview with Jeff Ed
[5134.719s] Edwards uh also known as episode 283 of
[5138.8s] hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes Comstock
[5142.239s] resource has taking a break it&#39;s it&#39;s
[5144.08s] shot up from eight bucks to 20 bucks so
[5146.679s] now it&#39;s going to rest for a little
[5147.88s] while before move to over 50 bucks and
[5150.08s] intrinsic value in hanesville diio is
[5152.6s] actually up today uh now that the
[5154.92s] tariffs are kind of like we know what it
[5156.679s] is it doesn&#39;t have to be good policy it
[5159.199s] has to be known policy and that
[5160.88s] uncertainty has been taken out I I like
[5163.48s] this we bought a couple shares today uh
[5165.88s] Disney I we didn&#39;t think we&#39;re gonna
[5167.44s] have another chance to buy again another
[5169.719s] stock two two years building a base it
[5171.96s] will be back up it will work its way to
[5173.719s] new highs over the next three years uh
[5175.84s] We&#39;ve covered all the reasons Etsy was
[5177.48s] up in the last month so I think there to
[5180.96s] to your point on the the thing
[5183.52s] generating half billion dollars of free
[5185.44s] cash buying back stock getting growth in
[5188.56s] some of the newer platforms figuring out
[5190.52s] the older platforms with rewards and
[5192.52s] some of the basic stuff generra it does
[5195.08s] this every single time you get the
[5196.679s] recovery then you get the fake out and
[5198.32s] the retest and you just climb the wall
[5199.96s] of worry higher and higher and higher
[5201.6s] why because they basically have a
[5202.84s] monopoly in the space then you&#39;ve got
[5205.28s] gxo just doing this bottoming process
[5208.32s] they will be fine hormell is rallying
[5210.679s] because why people like spam more this
[5213.08s] month than they like last one no because
[5215.0s] everyone&#39;s nervous and they buy staples
[5216.48s] when they&#39;re nervous this will be fine
[5218.48s] everyone loves spam Planters peanuts all
[5221.44s] the protein snacks that people need
[5222.92s] while they take their glp ones Intel
[5225.36s] we&#39;ve gone through a million times I
[5226.88s] mean this you can&#39;t even see what&#39;s
[5228.8s] happened literally you cannot see what&#39;s
[5230.88s] happened in the last two months on these
[5232.6s] charts and everyone is like the world is
[5234.84s] ending no it&#39;s just it&#39;s putting in its
[5237.32s] bottom that&#39;s what they do that&#39;s why
[5239.159s] they call me turnaround Tom it&#39;s because
[5240.92s] I have an ice in my veins when these
[5242.32s] things are happening while everyone else
[5243.88s] is panicking we&#39;re just chill as a
[5245.48s] cucumber and that&#39;s why people give me
[5247.36s] their money to manage because they don&#39;t
[5248.639s] want to have to have ice in their veins
[5250.119s] they want to run their own businesses
[5251.6s] they want to get on their private plane
[5253.08s] and go to the beach and go ski in the
[5255.04s] Alps and go to Mexico and do all the fun
[5257.28s] things they would do and pay me to worry
[5259.119s] about it and that&#39;s what I love to do I
[5260.679s] love pressure I can&#39;t live without
[5263.119s] pressure it makes me so happy that&#39;s
[5265.159s] probably why I took up golf all right
[5267.88s] Intel that we covered that PayPal okay
[5271.199s] cash machine okay so the EU threatening
[5274.719s] tariffs all that stuff look they could
[5276.76s] tariff them 100% PayPal is generating so
[5279.199s] much cash they&#39;re going to be fine with
[5280.96s] or without the EU and chances are it&#39;s
[5284.239s] will be much better than advertised
[5286.88s] Stanley Black and Decker okay you could
[5289.28s] actually see this one on the chart it&#39;s
[5291.48s] it&#39;s corrected a little bit in the last
[5292.96s] couple of months but it&#39;s no different
[5295.0s] than what you saw in when 2001 it scares
[5297.92s] everyone out of the stock before it goes
[5299.52s] back and retests new highs new highs in
[5301.679s] this case would be 195 198 8 the stock
[5304.92s] is
[5305.679s] $64 these are the normal bottoming fake
[5308.56s] outs when everyone&#39;s scared and here we
[5310.32s] are we&#39;re probably right around here
[5312.199s] maybe we shoot all the way down to 60 or
[5314.679s] 50 which would be absolutely incredible
[5317.0s] that would make my day and then boom
[5319.28s] straight up to 190 uh but my guess is
[5322.28s] we&#39;re probably there at the moment but
[5324.159s] this is how bottoms are made you always
[5325.92s] sh take out the lows get every last week
[5328.52s] sister out and then you just take up to
[5330.52s] new highs when you have a business that
[5331.88s] has a moat we&#39;re not talking about some
[5333.28s] garbage business
[5334.639s] you know Chinese micro cap that has
[5336.8s] good-looking numbers on paper and three
[5338.6s] years from now winds up being a fraud uh
[5341.719s] here VF Corp well does this look a lot
[5346.4s] like when 2001 completely collapsed okay
[5351.08s] then took a little while to put in a
[5352.639s] bottom rallied like crazy got everyone
[5354.8s] excited just like we shot up to 25
[5357.76s] couldn&#39;t give it away at 15 everyone
[5359.48s] wanted it at 25 and was super excited
[5362.32s] and then what they pull the rug out and
[5364.36s] they go back and test the lows before
[5366.48s] they go all the way back up to 2x their
[5368.52s] recent highs which would be $160 I&#39;m not
[5370.679s] saying we&#39;re going to $160 I&#39;m saying
[5372.76s] chillax bracken&#39;s got the wheel man you
[5375.239s] hire the right managers he&#39;s gonna
[5376.92s] figure it out he&#39;s a winner okay nothing
[5379.52s] to worry about there xbi this thing is
[5382.639s] doing what we see every single time you
[5384.56s] bottom you retest then you start to go
[5387.159s] up scare everyone one last time and then
[5389.32s] you go straight up parabolic and leave
[5390.84s] everyone in the dust just like we saw
[5392.239s] with Baba same thing&#39;s coming to it
[5394.119s] theater near you it just happens to be
[5395.96s] called xbi biotech next
[5404.239s] question is that Jason yeah okay so how
[5410.0s] do I delete
[5412.84s] this there we go next Clint
[5416.84s] Murray
[5418.44s] uh WSM William Sonoma putting it on my
[5422.32s] radar yeah look that&#39;s another housing
[5424.28s] play so let&#39;s take a look at what&#39;s
[5425.679s] happening with the fundamentals on
[5427.76s] William
[5429.52s] Sonoma from Clint
[5440.88s] Murray yeah I don&#39;t know if this has
[5442.88s] come down enough ladies and Gentlemen
[5444.88s] let&#39;s take a look at the financials I
[5447.239s] think it might I think I think you might
[5448.6s] be a little early on this one
[5450.52s] buddy um willing to be wrong on that but
[5453.199s] for me probably pass AO let&#39;s take a
[5456.52s] look at the
[5471.28s] financials
[5478.159s] WSM all right so cash flow is actually
[5480.52s] rolling over
[5484.52s] is
[5486.48s] this yeah I don&#39;t like that and price is
[5489.159s] starting to follow that I I don&#39;t like
[5490.84s] the trend their margins seem better
[5493.08s] revenues are still weak look could it
[5495.88s] recover I I would just rather
[5498.719s] see um a greater margin of safety I&#39;d
[5501.679s] like it to come down a lot more than
[5503.08s] that or start to see the cash flow go up
[5505.719s] before I get interested because even if
[5507.159s] the cash flow goes up the price should
[5508.48s] lag it for a while just like it lagged
[5510.08s] it on the way down cash flow was falling
[5512.08s] price kept going up will start to go up
[5514.88s] price will keep going down and then I&#39;d
[5516.8s] be more interested in that um so for
[5520.199s] that reason I understand what you&#39;re
[5521.96s] saying it should benefit from
[5524.639s] the
[5530.6s] uh housing theme but not ready Linda
[5535.32s] Williams was wondering if you thought
[5536.719s] Restoration
[5537.88s] Hardware uh same theme I think too early
[5541.159s] for me and too rich for me uh they got a
[5544.4s] restaurant here uh in Newport
[5547.679s] Beach down the road that looks awesome
[5551.199s] I&#39;m G to go there
[5554.76s] um you might be getting close but you
[5557.32s] know starter homes is going to be the
[5559.0s] name of the game here and Restoration
[5560.679s] Hardware caters to older people with
[5562.84s] money and those people are downsizing
[5564.92s] not upsizing I I never like this name at
[5567.0s] all as a matter of fact the first day I
[5568.76s] was on um Fox Business late 2009 19 it
[5574.36s] had been on this parabolic run right
[5575.88s] here and I wanted to talk to me about it
[5577.679s] and it&#39;s the last stock I wanted to own
[5579.08s] it was trading at like I don&#39;t know what
[5580.76s] it was 150 times earnings and 50 times
[5585.159s] sales or some ridiculous thing it was
[5587.28s] literally like right here and I&#39;m like
[5588.8s] yeah this is not for me and you know
[5591.56s] little did I know two months later would
[5593.08s] be covid and the thing you know
[5594.679s] collapsed 66% but back here when they
[5597.639s] had me on everyone wanted it which is
[5599.679s] why they wanted me to talk about it and
[5601.719s] it was really hard because I didn&#39;t want
[5603.04s] to poo poo it because everyone was so
[5604.44s] excited about it and it was my first
[5605.679s] time on
[5606.48s] TV um so that&#39;s that long story short it
[5610.719s] went well enough they invited me back on
[5612.719s] and uh and that&#39;s that uh and their cash
[5616.04s] flow is negative so hard pass until I
[5618.0s] start to see positive free cash flow
[5621.28s] recovery next one comes from Thomas bar
[5625.88s] if dswl Were Us stock would you buy it I
[5629.639s] don&#39;t know what that has to do with it
[5631.199s] but um considering my biggest position
[5634.08s] in my portfolio is international but
[5661.36s] dswl overiew
[5689.32s] uh
[5694.239s] based in maau so this is like a Chinese
[5696.639s] company no if it were a US company would
[5700.28s] I buy
[5702.56s] it
[5709.44s] uh no I mean they have no Revenue
[5712.52s] growth see cash
[5718.92s] flow this is this is a this is even too
[5721.679s] tiny for me in the US probably
[5724.44s] uh what&#39;s the balance sheet look
[5731.44s] like all right clean balance sheet uh
[5734.719s] just you know what&#39;s the turnaround plan
[5736.32s] how they going to re accelerate revenues
[5738.84s] I mean this thing&#39;s had a huge move it&#39;s
[5740.88s] up 4X off the 2016 lows so what&#39;s the
[5744.52s] growth story moving forward I think
[5746.36s] they&#39;re higher and better uses of your
[5748.04s] Capital but thanks for sending it in uh
[5750.639s] Jason Zen normally don&#39;t dabble in
[5753.159s] rumors but this one&#39;s too good to pass
[5754.88s] on the heels of the BMW Alibaba AI
[5757.52s] partnership last week for the Chinese
[5759.119s] auto market rumors are now circulating
[5761.04s] that Tesla&#39;s planning to partner with AI
[5763.4s] with Alibaba to leverage their cloud
[5765.4s] data center assets for full self-driving
[5768.639s] training this makes Baba a player on
[5771.159s] both AI fronts the generative AI front
[5774.04s] with their llms for BMW and the physical
[5776.719s] AI front in hosting GPU clusters cheers

[5845.639s] look insurance is cyclical I know all
[5847.88s] the insurance uh Brokers on the phone
[5850.159s] are going to tell me this time&#39;s
[5851.36s] different prices are going to stay high
[5852.8s] forever but I remember being an analyst
[5855.08s] when I in 2009 and I&#39;d go to all the
[5857.76s] meetings at the New York Society of
[5860.44s] Securities analysts and they&#39;d have all
[5862.599s] these insurance
[5865.0s] companies uh that were just completely
[5867.76s] decimated and I was a value guy so I
[5869.88s] wanted him to work and every year they
[5871.28s] would come and they&#39;d say the same thing
[5873.639s] so excited prices are going to start
[5875.239s] hardening it took 10 years so prices
[5877.88s] have been hard for you know five years
[5880.28s] all these Insurance guys are making
[5881.76s] Fortune selling their little brokerages
[5884.32s] TW two3 million brokerages to private
[5887.119s] equity for 30 million bucks and getting
[5889.88s] rich and 100 million bucks and getting
[5892.08s] rich and um and the Smart Ones are
[5894.36s] hitting the window because the window
[5895.639s] won&#39;t last and they&#39;re going to get very
[5897.44s] rich and um uh hopefully they&#39;re going
[5901.32s] to be smart to give some of their money
[5902.52s] to a manager like me to help them out uh
[5905.679s] and um but price hardening is not going
[5909.04s] to last forever and I wouldn&#39;t want to
[5911.639s] be in this space particularly with this
[5913.28s] company that&#39;s already recovered off its
[5915.639s] lows so I&#39;m going to pass on
[5918.119s] that um Rachel
[5920.599s] D hey Tom why don&#39;t you like Crocs their
[5923.96s] buyback plan seems like a smart Capital
[5925.599s] allocation are you seeing something
[5926.92s] different I&#39;m seeing that shoe companies
[5928.88s] run in phases and I want to buy the ones
[5930.96s] that are in the hole right now like Nike
[5933.48s] and like Vans uh VF Corp over Crocs
[5938.04s] which is just coming off its heated run
[5941.199s] um cash flow is good revenues seem to be
[5944.0s] slowing down uh I think they&#39;re kind of
[5947.56s] I think they got to got to relax
[5949.48s] everyone that wants Crocs already has
[5951.04s] them I mean my kids have them but you
[5953.8s] know there are only so many swimmers and
[5955.48s] chefs in the world at the end of the day
[5957.199s] you run out of chefs and you run out of
[5958.76s] swimmers and until they come out with
[5960.76s] something new or the the kids get tired
[5963.52s] wearing stuff I think it&#39;s going to
[5965.04s] breathe I would rather buy the ones that
[5967.36s] you can&#39;t give away and Croc is not
[5969.08s] there Croc has had a great run uh and
[5971.52s] they&#39;re probably due for a pause in my
[5974.159s] opinion um revenues seem to be
[5976.44s] flatlining which is supportive with that
[5978.28s] their gross margins have been down since
[5980.76s] 2022 starting to recover you might be
[5983.599s] right I&#39;m not going to knock it but it
[5985.56s] it&#39;s just for me it&#39;s not I look for the
[5988.0s] fat pitches that I don&#39;t even have to
[5989.48s] think about and that one&#39;s like H yeah
[5991.28s] maybe you make 30 40% I I don&#39;t know
[5993.88s] good luck I think possibly that will
[5996.36s] happen but it&#39;s got to be at least a
[5998.56s] double for me or I don&#39;t look at it and
[6000.28s] I don&#39;t see it in Crocs Tom thank you
[6002.52s] for all the work that you put into the
[6003.88s] podcast it&#39;s truly amaging educational
[6005.599s] for a student like myself question has
[6007.48s] to do with outperformance European
[6009.08s] stocks wor the
[6011.639s] US stimulus
[6014.639s] consumption short you dollar it&#39;s all of
[6018.36s] that it&#39;s all the above it&#39;s the
[6019.599s] stimulus it&#39;s the weak dollar strong
[6021.719s] foreign currencies that trend is just
[6023.32s] just beginning uh you&#39;re on your way so
[6026.639s] long question but you&#39;re generally your
[6029.119s] premise is correct Christian die thank
[6031.8s] you for all the work to my young looking
[6035.08s] Circle please look at Brembo leader in
[6040.28s] premium breaking system
[6042.48s] segment in
[6046.8s] Italy
[6052.239s] br for
[6103.679s] maybe but you&#39;re going to really have to
[6105.76s] know you got to know who their customers
[6107.36s] are you got to know what their Edge is
[6109.199s] you got to know it as well if not better
[6111.44s] than I know Cooper standard and and
[6113.44s] that&#39;s going to take many many months
[6124.8s] um free cash flow
[6127.28s] deteriorating last
[6129.719s] year balance sheet let&#39;s
[6136.76s] see balance sheet looks okay
[6143.4s] looks like they did an acquisition or
[6144.88s] something
[6145.92s] there what about the share
[6149.679s] count pretty
[6152.159s] decent it&#39;s definitely worth doing the
[6154.239s] work
[6155.0s] on
[6156.679s] um I&#39;ll leave it at that you really have
[6158.719s] to understand their customers and how
[6160.08s] well they&#39;re going to be doing if
[6161.0s] they&#39;re supplying exclusively to
[6162.88s] European automakers I wouldn&#39;t be
[6164.36s] interested in it because Europeans are
[6166.52s] letting the Chinese flood their markets
[6168.08s] and good luck with that um Henry Griffin
[6173.28s] how much Excel do you use in your
[6174.56s] analysis Excel is the language of
[6177.0s] Finance so you got to learn that stuff
[6179.4s] you got to take your
[6180.88s] CFA if you&#39;re new and have no experience
[6184.239s] that&#39;s a way to get good experience
[6185.84s] pretty quickly Jimmy
[6192.679s] Jones if your idea that the mara Lago
[6195.28s] Accord could recreate another 80s bull
[6197.199s] market in China as you stated in your
[6198.76s] last podcast does that change your
[6200.44s] intrinsic value in that environment
[6201.92s] would you hold a position longer because
[6203.119s] because of that
[6205.719s] situation no I know where I&#39;m getting
[6208.0s] out before I get in if it gets so much
[6210.88s] better than I could have anticipated
[6212.4s] maybe I&#39;ll hold a piece longer than I
[6214.159s] would have but I know my game I just
[6216.599s] stay I take the middle out of the
[6218.159s] sandwich I don&#39;t need the crust David
[6222.199s] mulinex what do you think
[6224.32s] of rentokill RTO
[6234.88s] so it&#39;s down like
[6251.88s] 40% what do they do
[6267.76s] pest control
[6270.88s] services
[6272.679s] H kind of like
[6275.119s] that but they&#39;ve had a monster run so
[6278.44s] you really run the risk here of this
[6280.48s] being a broken growth
[6282.639s] stock uh and if that&#39;s the case these
[6286.0s] things take an awful long time to
[6287.599s] rebuild so if it doesn&#39;t hold here
[6289.119s] you&#39;re screwed is really what it comes
[6290.96s] down to and if it does hold here you
[6293.08s] probably get a
[6294.199s] quick 60 70% again it doesn&#39;t meet my
[6298.04s] double Criterion and especially with
[6301.88s] the cash flow starting to deteriorate
[6305.199s] after it&#39;s had such a huge move that&#39;s a
[6308.04s] pretty big warning side to me sign to me
[6310.719s] the cash flow is basically back at four
[6313.4s] year ago levels and the stock is up
[6318.32s] uh
[6321.04s] 12x uh not enough margin of safety you
[6324.44s] might be right but uh that would be a
[6326.4s] pass easy pass for
[6338.719s] me question from this guy Warren asking
[6342.36s] about diio we bought a few shares today
[6344.84s] I&#39;ll leave it at that diio was actually
[6346.599s] up today which was kind of interesting
[6348.36s] so with that said we&#39;ll be back next
[6350.08s] week same time same place well first off
[6353.48s] uh thank you thanks everyone for tuning
[6354.96s] in we&#39;ll be back back next week same
[6356.8s] time same place in the meantime make it
