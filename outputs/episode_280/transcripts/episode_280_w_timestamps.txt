[165.599s] that&#39;s how she got the the hattick so uh
[168.239s] pretty cool here was one of the goals
[169.8s] and then we&#39;ll get down to it uh
[173.44s] boom boom all right nice little bullet
[176.92s] that crazy man Maniac yelling in the
[178.8s] background uh I don&#39;t know who he is all
[181.76s] right then I got to join Stuart vanney
[184.879s] thanks to Preston miselle and Christian
[187.799s] dagger always doing an awesome job
[190.44s] reaching out I really appreciate that
[192.36s] Christian uh and this segment proved to
[195.599s] be tremendously preing and the thing Stu
[198.4s] likes to do and Stu knows what to do
[200.72s] because he&#39;s got unbelievable ratings I
[203.319s] think about triple what CNBC has in his
[206.959s] exact same time slot is he always like
[209.879s] to ask me what&#39;s going to happen
[211.68s] tomorrow uh and that&#39;s a little bit of a
[214.159s] pressure on the spot but uh you&#39;ll see
[217.56s] here it proved to be very precient I
[220.239s] said that um Nvidia earnings would
[222.48s] probably be good the key would be the
[224.92s] reaction and he&#39;s and then he puts me
[227.0s] right on the spot so would you buy it
[228.879s] here today or do you think it&#39;s going
[231.239s] lower and I said I would not buy it here
[234.56s] I do think it&#39;s going lower and here&#39;s
[237.04s] why and sure enough uh um dropped 8%
[241.439s] today and you&#39;re going to find out
[243.799s] exactly why because some of you are
[245.92s] probably still confused even though if
[247.36s] you&#39;ve listened to this podcast you knew
[249.12s] this was coming uh for a long time we
[251.48s] put out the article on June 20th it had
[254.159s] negative returns uh since then and uh
[257.4s] more negative returns after today so
[260.479s] listen in to the great Stu Varney the
[263.04s] markets please now it&#39;s a sea of red the
[266.08s] Dow is off 40 S&amp;P down 30 look at the
[268.8s] NASDAQ go down down
[271.16s] 1.2% uh check out Nvidia please they
[274.4s] report tomorrow uh after the closing
[276.759s] bell uh they&#39;re down 2.4% as we speak
[280.36s] let&#39;s bring in Tom Hayes he joins me
[283.0s] tomorrow uh the the big deal is the call
[287.039s] that comes after the release of the
[289.039s] numbers that&#39;s what&#39;s going to make or
[290.96s] break that that particular stock what
[293.52s] are you expecting on the
[295.6s] call well that&#39;s it absolutely right
[298.4s] steu guidance is is the name of the game
[300.759s] and the theme of this earning season has
[302.759s] been great earnings and revenue uh we
[305.0s] had earnings growth of 16% for the S&amp;P
[308.08s] but the guidance was weak S&amp;P earnings
[310.6s] came down from 275 estimates down to 270
[314.759s] some some shops have it below Nvidia is
[317.36s] going to be no different I think
[319.12s] earnings will be good uh but the name of
[322.4s] the game is going to be guidance good
[325.36s] news is mag 7 committed to $300 billion
[328.919s] of spending the deep seek did not shake
[331.68s] the mag s they said we&#39;re going to spend
[333.199s] 300 billion the bad news for NVIDIA is
[336.0s] they don&#39;t control their own destiny uh
[339.199s] they are at the mercy of Taiwan
[341.6s] semiconductor who has limited capacity
[344.56s] which is why uh four months ago when
[346.639s] Intel dropped below 20 on your show we
[349.08s] said buy it the government is going to
[351.639s] stand them up they&#39;ve got a 17 billion
[354.0s] doll Revenue Fab business they&#39;re
[356.16s] eventually going to help Nvidia but for
[358.28s] the time being
[360.4s] uh their data SE data center Revenue
[363.28s] growth has been decelerating a year ago
[365.56s] it was 250% when you&#39;re growing at $4
[368.8s] billion per quarter and the base is
[371.039s] getting bigger by the end of this year
[373.16s] their revenue growth is going to be
[374.479s] below 50% still sounds good but when
[377.88s] you&#39;re trading at 30 times sales and 44
[380.84s] times earnings sometimes you need to
[382.88s] take a break and that&#39;s why Nvidia stock
[385.16s] price has had negative returns since
[387.4s] June so you would not be Buy buying
[390.0s] Nvidia at 127 this morning because you
[393.759s] think there&#39;s a good shot that it goes
[395.52s] lower after tomorrow&#39;s earnings call
[398.039s] correct correct what about Microsoft
[400.68s] they&#39;re back to $400 even well what
[403.639s] about
[404.599s] them look magnificent 7 we&#39;ve been
[407.24s] warning on your show for a couple of
[408.72s] months to trim back magnificent 7 not
[411.199s] because they&#39;re not great companies it&#39;s
[413.0s] just prices what you pay values what you
[415.0s] get and what you have seen year to date
[417.319s] is the Magnificent 7 is down 1 and a
[420.199s] half% year-to date why because their
[423.56s] earnings growth again is decelerating
[426.199s] from 33% last year to now it&#39;s expected
[429.319s] to just be 16% this year because of all
[432.36s] the capex because of all the spend
[434.4s] without a clear near term return and you
[437.56s] know the market likes near-term returns
[440.16s] too uh so that&#39;s why and the multiples
[443.24s] are still high even though the earnings
[445.12s] growth is coming down people are getting
[447.199s] wise to that and they are putting their
[448.919s] money El elsewhere in the
[451.36s] unmagnify and in international European
[454.759s] stocks up 10% year-to date emerging
[457.039s] market stocks up 7 and a half% year to
[459.68s] date we hear you and Microsoft is
[461.919s] killing me uh thanks very much indeed
[463.68s] Tom Hayes great to have you with us
[465.319s] thank thank you
[466.639s] Stuart and we&#39;re back moving on I will
[470.84s] be speaking at the money show in Miami
[474.72s] on May 15th through the 17th Hyatt
[478.24s] Regency Miami my segments are on the
[480.96s] 17th I&#39;m on the main
[483.599s] stage at 12:15 p.m. on Saturday and then
[487.12s] my own room at 145 I&#39;ll be talking about
[490.12s] some turnaround picks and second half
[491.759s] Outlook as well as how the uninvestable
[495.759s] became investable so we&#39;ll do a breakout
[498.759s] on China which will be exciting quotes
[501.44s] of the week the stock market is filled
[503.159s] with individuals who know the price of
[505.159s] everything and the value of nothing
[508.879s] that&#39;s a key theme in what we teach
[511.24s] every week here at hedge fund tips with
[513.599s] Tom Hayes in the world of business the
[516.159s] people who are the most successful are
[517.599s] those who are doing what they love
[519.039s] that&#39;s from Warren Buffett and if you
[520.719s] can&#39;t tell we absolutely love what we do
[522.719s] here every week we call it a treasure
[524.399s] hunt we skip to work and uh and we try
[527.64s] to deliver Great Value and I think by
[529.32s] the responses I&#39;m getting from a lot of
[531.0s] you and what you&#39;re going to see in the
[532.32s] AMA questions uh people are really
[534.399s] getting tremendous value uh this is from
[536.8s] WD Gan he says a successful Trader
[538.959s] studies human nature and does the
[541.32s] opposite of what the general public does
[544.92s] key is to do that at the right time not
[547.04s] to be contrarian just to be a contrarian
[549.04s] but to be to be a contrarian grounded in
[552.16s] facts uh and uh knowing what you own uh
[556.24s] finally Buffett we don&#39;t have to be
[557.92s] smarter than the rest we just have to be
[559.519s] more disciplined with the rest we always
[561.68s] joke uh people say I have ice in my
[564.839s] veins how I sit through these things uh
[567.12s] it&#39;s not ice in my veins when when you
[568.92s] know the value of the business and the
[570.92s] cash it generates the short-term
[572.959s] volatility does not even remotely uh
[576.959s] impact your thought process all that
[578.839s] impacts is the intrinsic value the cash
[581.079s] generation where it&#39;s going and uh and
[584.2s] then you can hold through those and then
[585.76s] finally is Charlie Munger another Legend
[588.16s] mimicking the herd invites regression to
[590.839s] the means so if you&#39;re chasing the shiny
[593.36s] objects that are in the headlines every
[594.8s] day sooner or later sheep get
[597.32s] slaughtered and we&#39;re seeing some of
[598.88s] that right
[599.959s] now okay let&#39;s get down to data ladies
[602.64s] and gentlemen uh if you are listening
[605.88s] through any of the first off I want to
[607.88s] welcome there&#39;s a lot of new people
[609.24s] listening in last week and this week I&#39;m
[611.6s] very grateful for that so welcome uh if
[614.24s] you don&#39;t get all the references and
[616.64s] inside jokes that we throw out from time
[618.76s] to time you will get it over time so
[621.72s] just hang in there but what I know
[623.12s] you&#39;re going to get is a tremendous
[624.279s] amount of data and what I would suggest
[626.519s] if you&#39;re listening and walking or
[628.44s] playing golf or doing whatever you&#39;re
[629.88s] doing keep doing that it&#39;s great if you
[632.399s] can go to YouTube and watch it by typing
[635.639s] in hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes you
[638.48s] are going to be able to see this data
[641.0s] and once you get accustomed to seeing
[643.2s] data you will start to notice patterns
[646.12s] and once you master patterns you will
[648.24s] have a clear Edge in the market over
[651.32s] time so when you can see it do it when
[654.16s] you can&#39;t you know walk and listen I
[656.16s] listen to audiobooks all day long at
[657.639s] these swim meets and and uh water polo
[660.519s] meets and everything else so Global
[662.959s] light vehicle sales this is related to
[664.959s] Cooper standard which is an awesome
[666.72s] position we&#39;re super excited about uh as
[669.48s] you can see we are recovering from covid
[673.16s] uh and we&#39;re we&#39;re seeing it you know
[675.2s] it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s hysterical management put
[678.12s] out that sandbagger 15.1 million
[680.399s] production for this year and blamed S&amp;P
[683.12s] for the number but and I said well wait
[685.92s] a second how do you get to
[687.88s] 15.1 produ C when estimated SAR by SNP
[692.44s] and Cox is 16.2 and
[695.56s] 16.3 uh and they&#39;re like well you know
[698.24s] there are inventories it it&#39;s complete
[701.519s] nonsense uh the inventories are at
[704.12s] historic lows which we covered last week
[706.12s] and number two if you
[707.72s] overlay uh production numbers and Us
[710.639s] sell through for the last 40 years it&#39;s
[713.079s] basically the same line so all of the
[715.519s] sudden magnificently there&#39;s going to be
[718.0s] some Divergence between between the two
[720.16s] I think not that&#39;s just a play on
[722.079s] keeping the oems at Bay so the oems
[725.32s] don&#39;t come knocking for more margin uh
[729.079s] so when these things hockey stick
[730.32s] they&#39;re going to hockey stick overnight
[731.639s] here is the data that we referenced with
[734.959s] Stu uh regarding Nvidia so so people are
[738.24s] shocked why is NVIDIA down 8% da it&#39;s
[741.92s] because their growth rate is
[743.48s] decelerating and that&#39;s okay if you&#39;re
[745.12s] trading at 10 times earnings it&#39;s not
[747.12s] okay when you&#39;re trading at 30 times
[748.56s] sales and 45 times earnings so basically
[751.519s] they and by the way the one thing I
[752.959s] didn&#39;t expect that happen is their gross
[754.48s] margins are eroding as well uh other
[757.0s] than that how was to play Mrs Lincoln so
[759.88s] uh here&#39;s what you see in data center
[762.399s] revenues they have uh grown $4 billion
[767.12s] per quarter for basically the past year
[771.12s] uh and that sounds great and it is great
[773.12s] okay the problem is is the base keeps
[775.56s] getting bigger and the growth rate is
[779.72s] decelerating was 250% off a small base
[782.72s] last year uh you know and down uh this
[786.639s] this quarter was well below 100% and
[789.36s] will be well below 50% before the end of
[792.24s] the year on top of that now you have
[794.079s] margin worries you have competition
[795.6s] worries and because of deep seek their
[798.399s] Edge called cuda which everyone thought
[800.639s] was going to be the next apple Walled
[802.72s] Garden has proven to be not the case so
[806.24s] all they become is exactly what they&#39;ve
[808.36s] always been which is a commodity
[810.88s] producer and it will be erased to the
[812.959s] bottom with margins as more of these
[814.72s] inferior chips can be utilized and as I
[817.839s] love to say the king of inferior chips
[820.279s] is Intel watch out not only do will they
[823.92s] be able to deliver inferior chips to
[826.32s] generate outsized performance like deep
[829.6s] sea created with inferior chips but they
[833.24s] will be the only game in town part of
[835.519s] their problem here is not really Demand
[838.04s] yet it&#39;s
[839.6s] Supply and they are depending on the
[842.6s] kindness of strangers in TSM Taiwan
[846.399s] semiconductor Intel will be stood up
[849.16s] they will absorb some of the excess
[851.92s] Demand with their Fab business it just
[854.56s] won&#39;t be in the next couple of quarters
[856.16s] it&#39;ll be probably three four four
[858.44s] quarters out and everyone will wake up
[859.88s] and say wow Intel is the next Taiwan
[863.079s] semiconductor I know no one can see that
[864.88s] right now people are like choking on
[866.32s] their coffee listening to this but we&#39;ve
[868.48s] said crazy things that have come true
[870.24s] Over The Last 5 Years go back and check
[872.36s] the tapes uh and this will be no
[874.68s] different uh so here&#39;s our buddy sler
[876.8s] over at
[877.759s] RBC this is the NASDAQ testing this I
[881.56s] think that broke through today uh
[883.759s] negatively and then you see the 10-year
[885.88s] yield rolling over which we&#39;ve been
[887.32s] calling for at 480 everyone says we&#39;re
[889.44s] going to five and we said no we&#39;re going
[891.32s] to three handle first uh and I think
[894.6s] we&#39;re going to hit uh low fours and
[896.48s] probably high 3es before anyone knows
[899.04s] knows what hit them
[901.04s] Alibaba which by the way is going to
[903.44s] ignite the housing market and building
[906.56s] and related businesses like Stanley
[908.32s] Black and&amp; Decker and um
[913.12s] J okay opinion follows Trend here&#39;s
[915.88s] Benchmark
[917.04s] upgrading Nvidia
[920.079s] to
[922.92s] uh 190 price Target okay and many others
[926.759s] doing the exact same thing uh so
[930.24s] effectively what you&#39;ve seen is a
[933.24s] rotation out of expensive us AI plays
[936.24s] and into cheap Chinese AI plays and I
[939.399s] think that trade is just
[941.519s] beginning uh here is the average path of
[944.279s] the S&amp;P during years one and two of the
[947.24s] election cycle that&#39;s going all the way
[948.839s] back to 1928 here we are uh you know
[952.8s] about eight weeks in you got this low we
[955.12s] probably rally in uh March a little bit
[959.0s] maybe Tech gets a little bid then we go
[961.279s] back and test and then we
[964.04s] rally uh from you know the end of March
[967.199s] through through the late part of the
[969.36s] year that is the average for
[973.959s] this year of the cycle I think next year
[977.36s] gets a lot choppier it is a midterm
[979.399s] election year you come out of the gate
[981.0s] strong you have a lot of weakness into
[982.6s] the election and then at year end rally
[984.72s] so I think we&#39;ve got a really nice
[986.8s] Runway here coming and uh it&#39;s good to
[989.48s] pay attention to these statistics and
[990.959s] patterns this is a proxy for what we&#39;ve
[994.6s] been calling for for a while this is
[996.319s] just today&#39;s chart what do you see down
[999.079s] uh sh all the shiny object stocks all
[1001.199s] the mag seven are down every other part
[1003.72s] of the market is up expect to see more
[1006.88s] of that this was super unpopular when we
[1009.519s] laid this out for you last year ladies
[1011.16s] and gentlemen as you know and it&#39;s
[1013.24s] happening every single day and people
[1014.8s] are shocked why are they shocked you
[1017.6s] know I don&#39;t know Nvidia David data
[1019.92s] center Rue here&#39;s the growth rate uh
[1022.0s] okay that I was pointing to greater than
[1024.559s] 250% now uh
[1028.079s] by we just
[1030.199s] hit basically here well below 100% and
[1033.679s] by the end of the year we&#39;ll be well
[1035.0s] below 50% that&#39;s perfectly exciting
[1038.319s] growth rates unless you&#39;re trading at 30
[1040.28s] times sales and 44 times earnings moving
[1043.4s] along here&#39;s the Russell just
[1045.36s] consolidating here this is a huge what
[1047.799s] they like to call cup and handle we
[1049.679s] don&#39;t really care much about that stuff
[1051.48s] but we do pay attention and we don&#39;t
[1053.039s] ignore it and the implication of that is
[1056.24s] that you get a measure move so figure
[1058.64s] about 800 points which would
[1061.4s] imply uh you know 40% above the highs
[1066.48s] here and I think this is just getting
[1068.32s] started and people say well that&#39;s a
[1069.6s] fantasy you know you&#39;ve You&#39; wanted to
[1071.44s] see small caps go for a while well small
[1073.919s] caps have gone a lot okay for a while so
[1076.799s] uh we&#39;re absolutely right about that and
[1079.919s] uh we think it&#39;s just just beginning and
[1081.64s] all you need to do is follow the
[1082.96s] earnings growth S&amp;P 500 at you know
[1088.6s] 134% uh and small caps depending which
[1091.88s] index you look at between 21 and
[1094.159s] 45% whether you&#39;re looking at the small
[1098.24s] S&amp;P 600 or the Russell
[1101.559s] 2000 uh here is the hangsang index
[1105.84s] breaking out here from the base the
[1108.159s] relative for the S&amp;P turning up
[1111.08s] aggressively here&#39;s the Hang sang on a
[1113.76s] daily breaking out to all-time new highs
[1116.12s] my guess is we break higher go back and
[1118.159s] test it before making the next parabolic
[1121.039s] move same thing here here&#39;s what Robert
[1123.72s] sler has to say about
[1125.84s] Alibaba continues to carve out longer
[1128.08s] term bot pattern after rallying 80% from
[1130.6s] its January low Baba is likely to start
[1132.96s] to pause uh just under its 38%
[1136.32s] retracement level
[1139.12s] near
[1140.559s] $157 first support
[1144.64s] is near $1 120 followed by 105 yeah I
[1148.679s] think we&#39;re going back to 120 um I don&#39;t
[1151.76s] think we&#39;re going back to 105 but I
[1154.24s] could definitely see this this huge base
[1157.4s] breakout back test and then straight up
[1160.88s] uh and probably next stop after that
[1162.6s] would be 188 or
[1164.72s] 219 uh and um welcome to the party
[1168.36s] ladies and gentlemen early days but uh
[1170.52s] if you get a move back to the low 120s
[1172.4s] and you don&#39;t have enough stock that&#39;s
[1174.2s] probably where I&#39;d buy it uh can I
[1176.0s] guarantee we&#39;re going to go back down to
[1177.32s] 120 before we take off no it might take
[1179.4s] off you know as I said uh when we were
[1181.799s] down in the 70s and 80s I said when this
[1183.72s] thing moves it&#39;s not going to let anyone
[1185.36s] in and it absolutely didn&#39;t I mean
[1187.159s] straight up
[1188.159s] 80% uh in a blink you know matter of
[1190.84s] weeks and everyone top ticking it at 140
[1193.2s] so probably got to wipe out some of
[1194.6s] those weak sisters before we go to 200
[1197.559s] uh here&#39;s in a new quarterly Revenue
[1200.0s] growth we thought uh even if they did
[1202.36s] the 4
[1205.0s] billion
[1207.84s] um you know the stock would be down and
[1210.32s] now their guidance is they&#39;re they&#39;re
[1212.039s] actually not even able to do the 4
[1213.48s] billion so uh this thing is is going to
[1216.0s] trap trapped a lot of retail investors
[1218.32s] chasing the shiny objects and that&#39;s the
[1220.44s] way it goes history repeats uh history
[1223.799s] doesn&#39;t even rhyme it repeats I mean
[1225.52s] it&#39;s it&#39;s just so clear as clear as the
[1227.88s] sky is blue
[1229.2s] uh fizer is interesting been a notable
[1231.08s] lagard but is showing early signs of
[1232.559s] bottoming in the mid-20s this one is
[1234.28s] starting to be interested interesting in
[1236.32s] the healthcare theme so uh we&#39;ll
[1238.919s] continue to pay attention to that re
[1241.0s] regeneron is a proxy for biotech I think
[1243.679s] the same story here that Schumer is
[1245.96s] pointing out from his technical
[1247.48s] standpoint we like from a fundamental
[1249.919s] standpoint and uh I think we&#39;re going to
[1252.32s] see some great things happening with
[1253.919s] biotech crown castle uh nice of him to
[1257.0s] cover this one uh thanks over there
[1259.64s] notably lagg but showing early signs of
[1261.32s] bottoming and weekly momentum moving up
[1264.44s] further upside from current levels you
[1266.12s] know we think this goes to 140 over the
[1268.12s] next 12 to 24 months plus you get a 7%
[1270.96s] dividend yield while you wait they&#39;re
[1272.799s] selling off the uh Capital intensive low
[1275.6s] return fiber business for over eight
[1277.36s] billion to Z group they&#39;ll use that to
[1279.919s] pay down debt buy more towers and the
[1281.96s] 40,000 Towers they have require like
[1284.2s] zero capex they just mint money I mean
[1286.48s] if you think the treasury prints money
[1288.6s] you should see uh Crown Castle&#39;s primary
[1291.039s] business of the 40,000 Towers it just
[1293.12s] they have to do nothing and it just
[1294.559s] keeps spitting out cash so I want to own
[1296.32s] that and when I can do it at a you know
[1299.48s] 60% discount from its recent Peak I&#39;m
[1301.799s] going to do it all day long and collect
[1303.6s] the big dividend yield lock that in in
[1305.4s] the meantime this could wind up being
[1307.48s] something you own for 10 years and the
[1309.64s] dividend keeps going up so you wind up
[1311.679s] with like a 10 15% yield on your basis
[1315.44s] and you double your money on top of it
[1317.76s] uh that&#39;s what I like to do cha-ching
[1319.36s] cha-ching uh Advanced Auto Parts
[1321.64s] everyone&#39;s you know bitching about the
[1323.12s] earnings and whining uh they&#39;re doing
[1325.96s] exactly what they said they were going
[1327.159s] to do Shane o Kelly came from HD Supply
[1329.799s] ran a$ 7 Billion Dollar business for
[1331.36s] Home Depot betting on the jockey here
[1333.36s] they&#39;re selling all the unprofitable
[1334.72s] stores on the west coast that are too
[1336.159s] far spaced out and they have no
[1337.64s] competitive Advantage they investing it
[1339.48s] all in the concentrated areas in the
[1341.08s] Northeast that they own they&#39;re you know
[1343.279s] Hub and spoke model this will be no
[1345.159s] different take a few years and uh you
[1348.12s] know this
[1349.279s] from these levels I mean I think this is
[1351.48s] triple from these levels it&#39;s probably
[1353.559s] 24 36 months again look all this is

[1385.48s] purposes Etc moving
[1389.4s] along uh what I liked
[1392.0s] here what is the both uh
[1395.039s] Viewpoint after the print from our
[1397.0s] conversations bullish investors believe
[1398.76s] Advanced Auto Parts continues to make
[1400.12s] solid progress on many different issues
[1401.52s] that have persisted at Advanced Auto
[1403.52s] Parts for years moreover bulls have
[1405.0s] shown patience and understand the
[1406.679s] transformation will take time they
[1407.76s] believe Advanced a Parts is managing
[1409.4s] expectations to realistic levels as such
[1411.4s] they don&#39;t completely understand why the
[1412.6s] stock closed down Bulls are confident
[1414.72s] that after the store closures are done
[1416.36s] in March and the company turns its Total
[1417.919s] Focus to its various growth initiatives
[1419.799s] the fundamentals of the business will
[1420.919s] start to improve moreover Bulls were
[1422.799s] pleased with AAP stated its largest
[1425.0s] strategic cons customer renewed a
[1427.159s] multi-year contract with Advanced Auto
[1429.4s] Parts and believe Advanced Auto Parts
[1430.76s] accelerates 2025 vendor conference
[1433.64s] returning is a good sign that vendors do
[1436.919s] in fact want to support Advanced Auto
[1439.12s] Part altogether bull the Advanced Auto
[1440.84s] Part as the most levered opportunity to
[1443.919s] get involved in the auto aftermarket and
[1446.919s] as such will benefit nicely when the
[1448.96s] industry sees Improvement Allin bulls
[1450.919s] have a line of sight to
[1452.96s] $4.50 e EPS at the end of
[1457.12s] 2026 you apply a growth rate to that
[1459.96s] when they&#39;re recovering the market will
[1461.88s] give them benefit of Doubt rate it to 18
[1464.6s] to 20 times and then they&#39;ll start to do
[1466.679s] more than that and if you look at their
[1468.12s] Bal sheet now since they to sold off the
[1470.12s] Canada business the name of the game
[1472.0s] with turnarounds is solvy risk and
[1473.76s] they&#39;ve solved that they got uh I think
[1475.799s] I looked 1.8 billion dollar of cash on
[1477.84s] the balance sheet paid off a bunch of
[1479.32s] debt winner as a jockey so I I love
[1482.2s] these stories absolutely love these
[1483.64s] stories here&#39;s Nvidia over the last few
[1485.559s] days down from 143 to
[1488.48s] 120 uh here&#39;s palent here from 125 down
[1492.12s] to 84 shiny object Slaughter Fest this
[1496.12s] was uh these are for those of you are
[1498.72s] wondering this is a rounding error maybe
[1501.039s] it turns into a big business but for
[1502.96s] those of you wondering Cooper
[1505.08s] standard um which is a big position for
[1507.48s] us has the ceiling systems around the
[1509.24s] doors fluid transfer systems uh supplies
[1511.96s] to the oems but they also have this
[1513.32s] business because of their rubber
[1514.6s] technology that they just started
[1516.399s] partnering with Nike on a lot of their
[1518.88s] high-end sneakers for runners and
[1520.679s] longdistance Runners so if you Google
[1523.159s] Nike react X shoes that rubber is from
[1526.76s] Cooper standard and they get paid big on
[1529.039s] every single unit sold and it seems like
[1530.88s] more and more units are being sold so
[1532.84s] that could be something that&#39;s not even
[1534.039s] on our model uh which would be uh added
[1536.919s] whipped cream and a cherry so uh keep an
[1539.12s] eye on that Rising demand for protection
[1541.84s] open interest in vix calls has jumped
[1543.84s] relative to put options so this is the
[1546.72s] type of environment that you probably
[1548.88s] want to stop selling in the hole if
[1550.559s] you&#39;ve been doing
[1552.919s] that and start to look for things to
[1556.0s] buy um I think we pretty flushed out
[1559.2s] here&#39;s from Ryan Dietrich today is
[1560.96s] historically the worst day of a weak
[1562.799s] month during one of the weakest times of
[1565.24s] the year so we&#39;re probably and we had
[1567.48s] warned you guys second half of February
[1569.76s] you can go look at the tapes on Varney
[1571.559s] Etc expect some
[1573.0s] volatility uh all of that that has shown
[1575.88s] up more sanguin about March and then
[1578.48s] following through there so uh it&#39;s time
[1581.48s] to deploy some Capital out of sync a
[1585.08s] gauge realized correlation is hovering
[1587.279s] near the lowest level ever what does
[1589.399s] this mean it means this is the best time
[1591.0s] ever to be picking stocks and the worst
[1593.0s] time ever to be in passive uh indexes
[1596.48s] exclusively uh speculators further
[1598.6s] reduce depending what passive indexes
[1600.76s] you&#39;re in also speculators further
[1602.279s] reduce net bullish bets on oil so a lot
[1605.279s] of people are selling oil in the hole
[1607.039s] which makes me continue to be interested
[1609.279s] in finding some more exposure Beyond
[1612.08s] comp stock resources which has been a
[1613.72s] home run uh so we&#39;ll continue to be
[1617.2s] patient and look for opportunity there
[1619.72s] but in no rush LG exports rise to an
[1622.679s] all-time high which is why we played the
[1624.2s] natural gas comp stock uh uh in the
[1627.36s] eights and nines and now it&#39;s uh I think
[1629.96s] it&#39;s in the 20s again uh and just
[1632.559s] getting started the relationship between
[1636.48s] sell through and production so Jeff uh
[1640.679s] put this out uh and basically did the
[1643.72s] overlay vehicle sales versus production
[1645.96s] 1990 to 2024 again exact same
[1650.48s] line uh six out of seven cases where
[1653.76s] annual production deficits exceed 1
[1655.559s] million production rebounded by an
[1657.0s] average of 8.5 annually over the next
[1658.76s] two three years so there&#39;s a huge catch
[1660.559s] up even if they&#39;re right um if the 2025
[1665.279s] deficit holds this suggests that
[1667.0s] production could reach 16 million
[1668.44s] Vehicles by 2026 and exceed 17 million
[1671.12s] by 2027 so in some sense you hope
[1673.6s] they&#39;re right sandbagging because then
[1675.36s] it&#39;s just a hockey stick but I think uh
[1677.76s] they&#39;re going to be wrong and we&#39;re
[1679.36s] going to be up around 16 million
[1680.72s] production and they&#39;re going to Mint a
[1682.0s] lot of money to the bottom line and
[1684.36s] we&#39;ll see a couple bucks of earnings and
[1686.6s] the market will give it credit for a few
[1688.12s] more bucks than that and this thing will
[1690.48s] start to hum you know for those of you
[1692.039s] who are brand new uh they earned you
[1695.159s] know this is a $15 stock we started our
[1698.24s] initial positioning and public uh uh
[1701.279s] went public on the claim and countdown
[1702.84s] in May of 2022 you can go back to the
[1705.08s] notes um built a basis around 550
[1709.0s] we&#39;ve added over time as new clients
[1710.919s] have come in uh base is still well below
[1714.0s] 10 and then um so the premise was that
[1718.96s] the stock on 17.1 million SAR in 2017
[1724.44s] Peak earned $719 a share and traded at
[1729.64s] $146 uh they&#39;ve taken 600 some OD
[1732.48s] million dollars of cost out of the
[1733.96s] business we believe that because of
[1736.559s] their efficiency now as the volumes
[1739.44s] recover continue to recover as they do
[1742.36s] every single cycle uh without fail to
[1746.44s] somewhere between 17 and 18 million uh
[1749.039s] sell through Peak uh they&#39;re not going
[1751.32s] to earn $7 this cycle we think they&#39;ll
[1753.24s] earn it north of $10 and maybe they
[1755.88s] don&#39;t get the 20 times multiple they got
[1757.72s] to be a $146 stock but what if they get
[1761.159s] a 10 times multiple on $10 of earnings
[1764.12s] versus a 20 times multiple on seven you
[1766.559s] still have a $100 stock and what they
[1768.279s] get a 15 times multiple and you got $150
[1771.279s] stock and God forbid they actually get a
[1772.84s] 20 times multiple uh you have a higher
[1776.24s] stock than that so we like our odds and
[1779.44s] we like Management&#39;s execution uh the
[1782.559s] other thing that we have
[1788.399s] here is so uh what Jeff&#39;s saying the
[1791.799s] cumulative 7-year production deficit of
[1793.64s] 4.69 million Vehicles coupled with
[1795.96s] record low Domestic Auto IND iies
[1798.44s] highlight significant pent up demand and
[1800.0s] under production relative to sales so
[1802.279s] you know if bessin is successful and I&#39;m
[1804.36s] right and
[1808.519s] um 10year yield ticks below four not
[1813.36s] only does it help housing we&#39;re going to
[1815.0s] see the financing loosen tremendously on
[1819.12s] cars as well uh and we&#39;ll be Off to the
[1821.88s] Races the role of incentives as a
[1823.279s] leading indicator we&#39;ve been pounding
[1824.72s] the table on this over the past two
[1826.799s] decades incent as a percentage of ATP
[1829.36s] has a average 9.8 when incentives exceed
[1833.399s] 11%
[1836.0s] um oems typically adjust production
[1838.559s] upward by 5 to 7% within the next
[1840.72s] quarter to meet anticipated demand
[1842.24s] that&#39;s from Cox automotive industry
[1844.159s] estimates suggest incentives could reach
[1845.96s] 11% by 2027 driven by slower EV adoption
[1849.12s] and the need to clear out older IC
[1850.76s] vehicles from current levels this could
[1852.96s] push sard to 17.5 to 18 million units uh
[1857.639s] if that happens
[1861.559s] um you will not be eating smiling so
[1864.799s] wide you could eat a banana sideways you
[1866.519s] will be smiling so wide you could eat a
[1868.679s] watermelon sideways is what&#39;s going to
[1870.559s] take place okay and we are waiting with
[1872.88s] baited breast
[1874.44s] so for every 1% increase in incentives
[1877.559s] as a percentage of ATP SAR increased by
[1880.32s] 400 to 600,000 units in the following 3
[1883.36s] to six months uh which direction is this
[1886.48s] headed ladies and gentlemen straight up
[1888.279s] that is the number one indicator
[1890.519s] analysts are we could just end the
[1891.96s] podcast right there I mean I&#39;m so
[1893.44s] psyched about the all right analysts are
[1895.2s] raising European earnings estimates this
[1897.639s] was not on most people&#39;s Bingle cards
[1899.36s] for those of you who had been listening
[1901.639s] we were pounding the table on
[1903.399s] International and that&#39;s been the lead
[1905.399s] performers discretionary versus Staples
[1907.919s] rolled over Market got defensive in
[1910.159s] February completely

[1938.24s] up keeping a close eye on the Japanese
[1943.559s] 10-year treasury jgb yield and this is
[1947.519s] basic
[1948.96s] basically axy for the carry trade on
[1952.76s] wine a lot of which free Capital found
[1955.519s] itself in the mag 7 as that money is no
[1958.679s] longer free in the Japanese carry trade
[1960.919s] as inflation picks up and if to raise
[1962.639s] rates money is coming out abruptly and
[1965.679s] there&#39;s a lot of force selling and
[1967.039s] that&#39;s going to continue and that will
[1970.039s] continue to pressure those stocks and
[1972.12s] those indices and the fortunes will be
[1974.32s] made under the Surface by those picking
[1976.48s] the stocks where price is what you pay
[1978.84s] value is what you get you&#39;re getting
[1980.519s] good multiples for good growth and
[1982.039s] that&#39;s why alibaba&#39;s up 80% uh that&#39;s
[1985.159s] why so many other value stocks we&#39;re
[1987.0s] starting to see take
[1989.159s] off here&#39;s again carry trade on wine
[1991.799s] what&#39;s what&#39;s happening it&#39;s moving
[1993.519s] right back down to those levels that we
[1996.6s] saw share of spending by income group uh
[1999.679s] top 10% of earners now account for half
[2002.2s] of spending you know this is this is not
[2004.919s] news it&#39;s certainly elevated a little
[2007.279s] bit but but um what you see is under
[2010.96s] Trump one is started to normalize and I
[2012.84s] think under Trump two it&#39;s going to
[2014.12s] normalize the lower strata did on a
[2017.48s] relative basis the Improvement for the
[2019.36s] lower strata under Trump one was orders
[2021.84s] of magnitude greater than it was for the
[2024.0s] higher strata and I think we&#39;re going to
[2026.2s] start to see that initial claims for
[2028.24s] unemployment insurance benefits in
[2029.96s] Washington DC so they are
[2032.76s] gutting uh the public sector uh that is
[2035.919s] deflationary
[2038.0s] apartment deliveries this is kind of
[2040.72s] fascinating so there was kind of a glut
[2043.36s] and that&#39;s you know the cure for high
[2045.2s] prices is um they saying Commodities SEC
[2048.359s] cure for high prices high it&#39;s high
[2050.52s] prices um and they glutted the market so
[2054.2s] now the deliveries are so that will
[2055.919s] create the setting for a shortage some
[2057.8s] years out mind the gap performance
[2059.879s] here&#39;s hang sang Tech dramatically
[2062.2s] outperforming the NASDAQ 100 on no one&#39;s
[2065.079s] else&#39;s bingo card except the listeners
[2067.76s] of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes my
[2070.24s] awesome awesome uh group here that I&#39;m
[2073.399s] so grateful to do every week for you uh
[2076.2s] percentage of stocks in the S&amp;P 500
[2078.44s] outperform in the index so this is
[2080.48s] starting to pick back up same as it did
[2082.72s] in 2001 what happened 2001 to 2007 again
[2087.079s] small caps Emerging Markets value
[2089.56s] dramatically outperformed the regime
[2091.839s] change is here it&#39;s already happened and
[2094.8s] it&#39;s going to continue to happen for at
[2096.76s] least the next handful of years this
[2099.68s] bull market might be two but is still
[2101.88s] young so for everyone looking for the
[2103.88s] exits yeah you should be you should have
[2105.96s] been looking for the exits if you were
[2107.24s] in the wrong stocks if you were in the
[2108.68s] right stocks and um paying attention to
[2111.56s] Value versus price and not chasing shiny
[2113.8s] objects you&#39;re you&#39;re happier than a
[2115.599s] hyena but if you&#39;re in the wrong stocks
[2118.16s] and you&#39;re saying I got to get out of
[2119.64s] everything keep in mind the average bull
[2124.68s] market uh is still young the average age
[2128.48s] of a bull market is 5.5 years we&#39;ve only
[2131.56s] been going 2.4 years the average gain is
[2134.839s] 196%
[2136.44s] 191% and we&#39;re only up
[2139.48s] 71% short Ines for the typical stock
[2142.76s] remains low versus history when&#39;s the
[2144.839s] last time you saw this low 2001 what
[2148.079s] happened the next five years
[2149.76s] International small caps value uh all
[2153.56s] the stuff we love and
[2156.48s] China uh higher January and February
[2159.88s] could mean the bull
[2161.52s] continues State data from Ryan Dietrich
[2163.96s] over at Carson he also has some data
[2165.88s] here talking about uh Mondays and
[2168.079s] Fridays being terrible in 2025 so there
[2171.44s] you go announced BuyBacks as you can see
[2174.359s] it&#39;s shifting it used to be all Tech but
[2176.64s] they&#39;re now uh spending that money
[2178.72s] aggressively and defensively on AI and
[2183.079s] uh that&#39;s hurting their margins it&#39;s
[2184.68s] decelerating their earnings growth it&#39;s
[2186.64s] decelerating their return on invested
[2188.44s] capital and it&#39;s limiting their ability
[2190.839s] to buy back shares which was a huge
[2192.48s] driver of eps growth for many many years
[2195.0s] during Zur from
[2196.599s] 2010 uh till recently now financials are
[2199.92s] starting to lead the BuyBacks Healthcare
[2201.599s] is starting to lead the BuyBacks
[2203.2s] Industrials Etc so pay close attention
[2206.88s] regime change
[2209.119s] intact
[2210.27s] [Music]
[2212.4s] um history of stock market returns can
[2214.76s] often be determined by whether or not
[2216.16s] the vix is above 1950 historically the
[2218.2s] vast majority of S&amp;P gains comes when
[2220.8s] vix is under this level uh so that is
[2224.04s] from uh Seth
[2226.28s] golden price to sales for S&amp;P 500 again
[2229.92s] this is super elevated and largely
[2232.079s] because of the concentration of the mag
[2233.839s] 7 it&#39;s why we continued to say if you
[2236.2s] got to be in an index move to equal
[2238.4s] weight move move away from overweight
[2240.72s] mag 7 and all of them are down now some
[2244.0s] you know 17 to 20 something percent some
[2246.319s] even more um uh and maybe we get a
[2249.2s] bounce here for sure uh I wouldn&#39;t be
[2251.4s] worried about that but I think the
[2253.8s] underperformance theme is going to
[2255.599s] continue if they&#39;re not going to crash
[2259.24s] like 2000 which I believe they are not
[2262.839s] uh they are going to consolidate and
[2264.76s] given the gains that they&#39;ve had the
[2266.24s] consolidation might be a lot more and
[2268.4s] longer than most people think until they
[2270.68s] change the index waiting which S&amp;P
[2273.16s] always does uh then the indices will
[2275.44s] start to outperform and these stock will
[2277.88s] be a much lower waiting uh in the
[2281.16s] meantime these type of extremes you do
[2283.599s] not want to be on that side of a crowded
[2285.599s] boat that is how you drown so uh here is
[2290.88s] GDP tracking from Goldman who tends to
[2294.119s] be more negative than most they&#39;re right
[2296.079s] around
[2297.92s] 2% Baker Hughes rig count going up I
[2301.16s] mean that makes sense why people are
[2304.4s] selling
[2305.76s] energy um they&#39;re aggressively short let
[2309.839s] maybe we can take a quick look at how
[2312.599s] short are commercials I did look at it
[2316.16s] and I think that they
[2318.68s] are pretty
[2323.76s] aggressive uh where is Energy natural
[2326.92s] gas there we go so what we look is at is
[2331.64s] the commitments of
[2334.28s] Traders positioning and we want to
[2336.88s] generally be on the opposite side of the
[2339.64s] large Traders and hedge funds and we
[2342.28s] want to be in line with the commercials
[2344.56s] when the commercials are buyers uh price
[2347.319s] tends to follow right now commercials
[2349.119s] are in fact buyers it doesn&#39;t always
[2351.8s] work but it works a lot of the time at
[2353.8s] inflection point so our inclination is
[2356.76s] to be more constructive on energy but we
[2358.64s] are in no rush to do
[2360.88s] it here&#39;s uh the money show registration
[2363.96s] I will be speaking on the 15th to the
[2365.68s] six 17th just go to hedge fund tips.com
[2368.56s] and register there love to meet a lot of
[2371.04s] you in person um here is
[2376.04s] from fund Strat so they had a similar
[2379.48s] chart with small caps showing this
[2382.72s] they&#39;re making the case that we&#39;ve had a
[2385.04s] lot of these 5 to s% pullbacks in
[2386.8s] momentum and then they bounce back it
[2388.72s] could be the case um so you know just be
[2392.64s] open-minded to that that would make
[2394.119s] sense if the indices are going to
[2395.359s] rebound a little bit in March uh but for
[2398.52s] the long-term gains you want to start to
[2400.2s] be moving away
[2402.64s] from the crowd and skating to where the
[2405.52s] puck is going to be not where it&#39;s
[2407.16s] already been in the rear view
[2410.319s] mirror moving along seasonality for the
[2413.359s] presidential cycle year one since 1929
[2416.44s] February is the worst month March
[2418.28s] recovers April is awesome May is awesome
[2420.839s] June is a little weaker July is awesome
[2423.319s] fall gets weak and then you finish out
[2425.16s] okay so I think we&#39;re going to get a lot
[2426.4s] of gains in a short amount of time here
[2428.72s] into the summer and then we&#39;ll probably
[2430.52s] start to harvest some and uh look for
[2433.24s] more defensive opportunities as we get
[2435.16s] into this window uh and go from
[2438.92s] there here are the PE evaluations
[2442.04s] relative to history uh you&#39;re seeing
[2444.92s] some bargain levels in real
[2448.119s] estate uh what is this
[2450.92s] P oh absolute PE so energy is low and
[2455.04s] then relative PE here&#39;s where you F
[2458.2s] here&#39;s where you&#39;re overpaying is
[2459.96s] information technology consumer uh no
[2462.24s] consumer discretionary looks
[2464.56s] okay over the last 10 years uh
[2468.079s] Industrials I think that&#39;s probably
[2469.68s] skewed by a few companies like cat Etc
[2474.04s] uh but here&#39;s where you&#39;re finding more
[2475.8s] of the bargains Staples
[2477.68s] materials utilities real estate Health
[2480.2s] Care financials and
[2482.24s] energy this was the small cap chart I
[2484.48s] was telling you about uh we agree with
[2486.76s] this View you know but sometimes look it
[2488.92s] comes back up to this top it
[2490.44s] consolidates for a little while before
[2491.92s] it takes the next Double higher gets up
[2494.92s] to the top consolidates before doubling
[2497.24s] to the next level higher so this
[2499.04s] wouldn&#39;t surprise us at all
[2503.28s] um and this does look similar to that
[2506.16s] early 2000s period as well that we&#39;ve
[2508.079s] been continually talking about uh
[2510.599s] bearish sentiment well we&#39;ll we&#39;ll see
[2513.599s] the more recent readings they got
[2514.96s] completely flushed out us share of
[2517.52s] global Equity
[2522.28s] market so they have 56% and and this is
[2526.16s] why we&#39;ve been telling people to get
[2527.319s] some
[2529.28s] International us equities have 56% share
[2532.24s] of the market but we only have 44% of
[2534.68s] earnings so that is a
[2537.079s] huge uh premium for this for that
[2541.44s] earnings power uh and as you can see if
[2544.559s] you look back past 5 minutes that is not
[2547.559s] always the case and these always they
[2549.76s] diverge and then they converge and you
[2551.96s] don&#39;t want to be on the side when they
[2553.44s] start converging which I believe they&#39;re
[2555.16s] going to be doing in coming years be
[2558.079s] Bears argue us exceptionalism has
[2560.64s] peaked and say 90% of equities are
[2563.64s] overvalued I disagree with that
[2566.319s] statement uh but I do believe that
[2568.88s] you&#39;re going to start to see some
[2569.92s] outperformance in international and
[2572.2s] what&#39;s going to surprise everyone as
[2573.48s] they took all the weightings down in
[2574.72s] China is it&#39;s going to be driven by
[2576.4s] China and uh all the hot money that ran
[2579.319s] into Japan and India to hide uh in the
[2583.24s] last few years is now going to come
[2584.88s] rushing out fomo they&#39;re all
[2586.599s] underperforming they have no exposure as
[2588.64s] matter of fact Brendan Ahern of kweb did
[2590.88s] a write up on that they&#39;re all screwed
[2593.04s] they missed this 80% move and now
[2595.44s] they&#39;re got to chase Pile in otherwise
[2598.079s] they&#39;re gonna you know any International
[2600.0s] active manager that&#39;s been hiding out in
[2602.0s] India and China is toast India is at 52
[2604.76s] we lows uh Japan
[2608.0s] is is uh it&#39;s basically done and now uh
[2612.119s] China has uh left the gate and not let
[2614.599s] them in so they&#39;re going to have to
[2616.079s] panic Chase on any dip to buy and if you
[2619.559s] get a gift of Baba at 120
[2623.839s] 125 um you know and you don&#39;t have
[2626.68s] enough exposure that&#39;s going to be
[2628.319s] probably your last gift and I and I
[2629.839s] don&#39;t think there are any guarantees we
[2631.16s] get that by the way I think pay at this
[2633.319s] point is going to keep pushing higher
[2635.24s] and forcing people not to be in and then
[2637.92s] you know at 200 it&#39;ll pull back you know
[2640.559s] everyone will get in at 200 and it&#39;ll
[2642.16s] pull back to 175 and scare the out
[2644.28s] of everyone um all the Johnny come
[2647.24s] lately is that you know we&#39;re selling at
[2649.559s] 60 and we&#39;ll be buying at 200 and then
[2652.64s] they&#39;ll get roasted and that&#39;s just it&#39;s
[2654.52s] not to be like mean or arrogant it&#39;s
[2656.319s] just to say that these patterns repeat
[2658.52s] over and over and over and if you
[2660.599s] understand them you can say oh I see
[2661.839s] what&#39;s happening uh and and especially
[2664.52s] if you if you&#39;ve done the work on the
[2666.0s] fundamentals if you&#39;re just listen to a
[2667.76s] guy uh and not doing your own homework
[2670.559s] or or not allocating then um you got to
[2673.96s] do the work us has looser labor
[2678.359s] regulations and lower
[2680.839s] unionization if you build it they will
[2683.76s] come what they&#39;re talking about
[2687.0s] here is uh and by the way uh some of you
[2690.04s] were talking about the mic I bought a sh
[2693.04s] mic it&#39;s supposed to be the best one so
[2695.359s] in the comments Below on YouTube let me
[2697.4s] know if there&#39;s any Improvement this
[2699.0s] week I had the yeti which was fine for
[2702.559s] some reason it uh didn&#39;t people wanted
[2705.52s] to hear it better so I got the best mic
[2707.76s] let me know if it&#39;s better this week or
[2709.359s] not I never noticed a difference but you
[2711.24s] know I pay attention to all your
[2713.119s] comments ladies and gentlemen uh if you
[2715.079s] build it will they come AI versus the
[2717.52s] late
[2718.8s] 1990s clc&#39;s which were the competitive
[2721.92s] local exchange carriers um the whole
[2725.2s] thesis was if you build it they will
[2727.4s] come meaning invest all the money till
[2729.8s] the cows come home and hope for a return
[2732.72s] down the road sounds very familiar to Ai
[2735.52s] and they kind of did an overlay of what
[2737.28s] happened with that thesis and who was
[2739.599s] The Biggest Loser one of the biggest
[2741.16s] losers during that period was the
[2742.64s] company maybe you&#39;ve heard of it was
[2744.559s] called Nvidia this is what their chart
[2746.76s] looks like as well right here is the
[2749.119s] index they&#39;re overlaying the semis index
[2751.72s] over these uh clecs I&#39;m not an enormous
[2754.96s] fan of these uh analoges
[2759.0s] but I do pay attention to
[2762.559s] them moving
[2767.64s] along here&#39;s
[2769.72s] the antithesis so they&#39;re making the
[2772.599s] case why this time is different which is
[2775.2s] a dangerous case to make which is better
[2778.319s] returns for semis versus CC&#39;s so CC&#39;s
[2781.68s] were just investing at a loss because
[2783.4s] they could get unlimited free money
[2784.8s] during the uh uh late 90s today the
[2788.88s] semis are actually generating a return
[2790.52s] on invested Capital lower leverage risk
[2793.079s] for semis versus clecs CC&#39;s were 10
[2796.72s] times as expensive as today&#39;s
[2799.0s] semis clecs burn cash semis generate
[2802.4s] cash so uh again that&#39;s why we&#39;re of the
[2806.24s] view that we&#39;re not going to see a tech
[2808.079s] wreck we&#39;re going to see a tech sideways
[2810.92s] consolidation to absorb the gains of you
[2814.0s] know paying for what is going to happen
[2816.92s] happen five seven nine years out today
[2820.8s] um you&#39;ve already paid for it so now you
[2822.559s] got to absorb it to get a little closer
[2824.359s] to the
[2825.68s] event um you
[2828.2s] know buy the rumor sell the
[2831.2s] news you bought it early and you paid
[2833.839s] full price so now either the stock you
[2836.64s] know stocks can correct two ways they
[2838.079s] can crash or they can grind sideways for
[2840.559s] a long period of time to consolidate the
[2842.599s] gains until the event becomes more
[2844.839s] crystallized to actually be happen
[2846.88s] happening and the time between the
[2849.119s] expectation of it happening and it
[2850.559s] actually happening uh
[2852.559s] Narrows investors eager for a pickup in
[2854.96s] China growth which of the following
[2856.839s] developments would you see as the most
[2858.16s] bullish for 2025 China growth
[2860.52s] accelerates opinion follows Trend gear
[2863.839s] to- dat performance in US dollar terms
[2865.92s] NASDAQ versus uh Hong Kong Shing high
[2870.28s] and you can just see the dramatic
[2872.319s] outperformance again on no one&#39;s bingo
[2874.88s] card at the end of last year on

[2920.92s] so this is a positive trend for the
[2923.16s] companies that we look at productivity
[2925.599s] grew at an annualized pace of 2.8%
[2927.839s] during the tech boom versus
[2929.68s] 1.6% in the two decades after this is
[2933.359s] beginning to pick back up
[2937.839s] um labor productivity you can see here
[2940.96s] we&#39;ve been consolidating for 18 years
[2944.359s] we&#39;re now breaking out and we&#39;re going
[2945.76s] to start to see massive productivity
[2947.839s] like we saw in the late 90s and in the
[2951.799s] early
[2954.119s] 2000s uh consumer sentiment has been
[2956.319s] weak on fear of tariffs and inflation
[2958.64s] and kind of the uncertainty of new
[2960.559s] volatility every day with a new
[2962.079s] announcement uh welcome to Trump 2.0
[2965.28s] same as Trump 1
[2967.319s] .0 new day new policy new tweet new
[2971.76s] volatility get over it if you don&#39;t know
[2974.799s] what you signed up for that&#39;s what
[2976.28s] that&#39;s what we got and I think that uh
[2978.68s] you got to break a few eggs to get an
[2980.04s] omelet so that&#39;s we&#39;re in the egg
[2982.079s] breaking process and I think we&#39;re going
[2983.52s] to get some beautiful big beautiful
[2986.04s] omelets come out of this uh University
[2989.119s] of Michigan inflation expectations
[2990.68s] through the roof y
[2992.359s] tariffs uh University of Michigan 5 to
[2994.92s] 10 year inflation expectations
[2997.2s] same thing
[2998.76s] tariffs if you look at the data you get
[3001.24s] the short-term bump intermediate term to
[3004.72s] long-term prices are actually lower
[3006.88s] because growth growth tends to slow as
[3008.839s] well that&#39;s also
[3010.92s] deflationary S&amp;P Global us manufacturing
[3014.16s] PMI actually turned up Dallas was uh
[3017.52s] terrible uh but Philadelphia was good so
[3020.119s] you&#39;re seeing mix but generally moving
[3021.52s] in the right direction mortgage rates
[3022.799s] are coming down now below 7% That&#39;s
[3025.28s] positive Stanley gen Etc City economic
[3028.559s] surprise index turning down so we got to
[3031.599s] keep an eye on this you did see a little
[3034.119s] bit of that in late 2023 when everyone
[3037.0s] was calling for a recession that never
[3038.599s] came so um be mindful but don&#39;t be
[3042.4s] paralized by it is is what I would say
[3044.96s] dollar rolling over part of our core
[3047.04s] thesis yields going down part of our
[3048.839s] core thesis um
[3052.28s] non-commercial selling in the
[3054.599s] hole which is why we&#39;re starting to get
[3056.64s] get more and more interested in oil and
[3058.16s] oil related stuff again here&#39;s the
[3060.4s] seasonal comp composite taken uh not
[3063.0s] back to 1929 but back to
[3065.359s] 1994 and here we are in February late
[3068.599s] February early March things pick up back
[3070.52s] up I think that is a good model to keep
[3072.76s] in mind so be ready in the first uh
[3075.48s] couple of weeks of March for things to
[3077.24s] look a lot better Doge effect Federal
[3080.119s] redundancies are uh are
[3084.0s] rising uh so you know this is a lot of
[3086.319s] layup we haven&#39;t seen that since
[3088.119s] 2022 e-commerce retail sales as a
[3090.68s] percentage of total sales hit a record
[3092.4s] high now
[3093.72s] almost 16 a half% that&#39;s bigger than
[3096.96s] during covid when everyone was locked
[3098.96s] down so that&#39;s a positive thing for
[3100.92s] things like Etsy uh and others like
[3105.319s] Baba uh biggest inflow to Europe in
[3108.319s] three years opinion follows Trend Japan
[3111.24s] CPI turning up which means what they
[3113.48s] have to continue to raise rate which
[3115.0s] means what the free money of the carry
[3116.96s] trade is over which means what force
[3119.319s] selling in mag 7 and passive indices
[3121.96s] that are overweight mag 7 Japan CPI
[3125.92s] there we go core inflation hits 19-month
[3128.4s] high in Japan keeping alive boj rate
[3131.799s] hike bets Alibaba straight
[3136.68s] up Alibaba daily return straight up hang
[3141.559s] sang relative to hangsang Tech
[3144.44s] dramatically
[3145.52s] outperform and that&#39;s what we had said
[3148.24s] uh probably a year ago on the podcast we
[3150.16s] said that uh when you know the hangsang
[3153.68s] doubles the key stocks will be up triple
[3157.359s] you know or quadruple and by the key
[3160.0s] stocks we mean the alibas etc etc and
[3162.64s] that&#39;s just begun short interest is
[3165.44s] still record high in China which means
[3167.28s] there&#39;s going to be a lot of forced
[3168.839s] buyers in coming
[3171.24s] months these these were core part of the
[3173.88s] thesis as we were laying it out when
[3176.0s] everyone was
[3178.76s] uh very negative on China and dollar
[3182.599s] rolling over I&#39;m sorry the um yuan is
[3186.96s] strengthening relative to the dollar
[3189.079s] which no one thought would happen and
[3190.96s] guess what China bond yields are going
[3193.48s] up two things that you see every cycle
[3195.799s] when Chinese equities take off here&#39;s
[3199.319s] India people couldn&#39;t get enough in 2024
[3201.88s] at the peak uh now it&#39;s rolling over
[3204.319s] everyone&#39;s selling in the hole if you
[3206.52s] remember all the Articles record options
[3208.839s] record call options in India&#39;s history
[3210.839s] it was unbelievable they were like doing
[3212.28s] more options than the United States and
[3214.0s] they&#39;re like so so much smaller you know
[3217.68s] economy and markets by capitalization
[3221.2s] and those are all this hell taale signs
[3222.72s] and people this chart is actually let um
[3225.76s] um accelerated into it broke through on
[3228.76s] the downside if you remember we covered
[3230.359s] this last week it&#39;s actually broke below
[3232.559s] this so it&#39;s a whatever they call it a
[3235.0s] bearish pennant so keep an eye on that
[3238.16s] uh Insider transactions is actually at a
[3240.24s] level that&#39;s contrarian bullish we&#39;re
[3243.0s] actually even seeing it in Cooper
[3244.839s] standard insid or buying we&#39;re going to
[3246.359s] cover later in the podcast first time in
[3248.44s] a while here&#39;s the treasuries we&#39;ve been
[3250.319s] saying bonds up yields down here&#39;s the
[3253.319s] short interest these people are going to
[3255.319s] get Smokey smoked they haven&#39;t been this
[3257.96s] short since 2018 2014 right before
[3262.76s] monster rallies in bonds tequila is the
[3266.0s] only Spirit seeing sales growth in the
[3269.119s] US
[3270.88s] um diio has a lot
[3273.88s] of tequila and good good good tequila
[3277.48s] brands staples versus the market haven&#39;t
[3280.119s] seen this since 2000 early 2000s again
[3283.64s] another thing factor that is rhyming
[3286.68s] with our 2020 2001 to 2007 lot of
[3290.359s] similarities China outperform small caps
[3292.799s] value uh and Staples so pay attention to
[3295.839s] this
[3296.839s] uh this is an extreme opportunity here
[3300.359s] and uh we&#39;ve got some expression through
[3302.839s] hormell but we&#39;re going to find some
[3304.48s] others as
[3305.88s] well growth versus value in the last
[3308.2s] couple days growth rolling over value
[3310.68s] rallying this is from Thomas
[3313.799s] defasio uh the son of my friend had a
[3319.559s] chance to have lunch with them about a
[3322.559s] year
[3323.68s] ago and uh so hello to Bobby and Thomas
[3328.68s] Thomas is putting out the Russell 2000
[3331.599s] back to support at the 200 day moving
[3333.4s] average not quite oversold but a bounce
[3335.88s] could be in play here soon we agree good
[3338.839s] work Thomas uh here&#39;s babo breaking out
[3341.72s] of the uh basing pattern here measured
[3345.92s] move would be from 60 to 120 takes us up
[3349.319s] first stop 180 and then I think we we
[3351.799s] consolidate before going even higher
[3353.839s] dollar rolling over as anticipated
[3358.119s] what do you think the headlines were
[3359.28s] here dollar will break to new highs and
[3361.72s] of course everyone crowded in at the
[3363.559s] exact wrong
[3365.2s] time here&#39;s the perfor stock market
[3367.88s] performance since the election
[3369.839s] everything we said would be taking place
[3372.44s] that everyone would be shocked
[3373.68s] International would start to outperform
[3376.039s] and sure enough that&#39;s been the case S&amp;P
[3378.64s] is basically flat Now Stocks have
[3381.44s] trailed International peers US Stocks AI
[3385.119s] bull bear spread touch just the lowest
[3386.88s] level since November 223rd so sentiment
[3389.0s] is getting washed so be ready for a big
[3391.039s] bounce don&#39;t know what the Catalyst will
[3392.96s] be but I&#39;d be shocked uh if we didn&#39;t
[3395.92s] get one in March uh big ra big rally of
[3399.52s] uh some areas Magnificent Seven stocks
[3401.96s] syn while defensives race ahead healthc
[3404.96s] care Staples mag seven down
[3408.839s] 67% um while these are up 67% on no
[3412.72s] one&#39;s bingo card unless you were tuned
[3415.68s] in to to Fox Business and I was talking
[3418.24s] with Kabuto uh at the end of the year
[3420.319s] before he retired and I said the last
[3422.359s] shall be first watch out for materials
[3424.96s] and Healthcare were the worst two in
[3426.76s] 2024 everyone&#39;s like no way man it&#39;s
[3429.44s] going to be mag seven I said no way man
[3432.4s] you got you know Watch What Happens and
[3434.64s] sure enough price followed the earnings
[3436.52s] growth and and we&#39;re off these earnings
[3438.64s] are decelerating these earnings went
[3440.359s] from Flat to 20% and surprise surprise
[3443.52s] the price followed uh CBO skew index
[3447.559s] sores uh you have to pay attention to
[3450.44s] this we&#39;ve covered skewed many times on
[3453.16s] this
[3454.64s] um
[3456.52s] but you know you buy
[3459.44s] protection before a fire not not in the
[3462.4s] middle of a fire and uh I I think we&#39;ve
[3465.68s] done a lot of damage under the surface a
[3468.44s] lot of these momentum crowded trade
[3470.24s] shiny object
[3472.72s] uh popular stocks uh have gotten
[3476.2s] completely smoked and I think we&#39;re
[3478.92s] getting closer
[3480.52s] to the end of the liquidation than the
[3483.839s] beginning 10-year treasury yield rolling
[3487.2s] over uh discretionary looks like it
[3489.599s] could potentially be ready for a bounce
[3491.2s] in coming weeks Staples might be a
[3492.64s] little overdone in terms of the
[3494.64s] defensiveness expectations for cuts are
[3496.76s] now going up people are pricing in
[3498.4s] slower growth with the tariffs uh and
[3501.039s] yields are coming down fed Cuts
[3503.079s] expectations going up uh here are some
[3505.92s] of the the mag 7 this was a couple of
[3508.079s] days ago these have look these are
[3509.48s] looking a lot worse now most of them are
[3511.48s] down about 20% Tesla maybe a little more
[3515.799s] Nvidia got hit a lot harder today uh
[3518.72s] February is the worst month of the year
[3519.799s] in postelection year second half of
[3521.64s] February all these stuff that you were
[3523.28s] ready for now has played out uh not a
[3527.28s] lot of debt but delinquencies are rising
[3528.88s] from low levels so again these are
[3531.16s] historic low levels of debt so yes you
[3533.88s] will see delinquencies but it&#39;s off a
[3535.76s] very very multi-decade historic low base
[3539.2s] Debt Service much less of a burden now
[3542.599s] um a lot of a lot of debt was locked in
[3545.119s] at very low rates consumer confidence a
[3547.44s] little bit grinding sideways we saw that
[3550.88s] actually right before uh the first Trump
[3553.599s] Administration I think you&#39;re going to
[3555.16s] start to see a re acceleration just like
[3557.0s] you did in Trump
[3559.4s] 1.0 uh here&#39;s the breakdown of the mag s
[3562.76s] from Mike zardi you can see this pennant
[3565.599s] actually broke down below the uh volume
[3569.16s] by price as well which implies it could
[3571.92s] see some more pain for those overweight
[3573.88s] stocks and which you know wouldn&#39;t be
[3575.839s] surprising but um we&#39;re not stepping in
[3579.039s] that&#39;s not our game we&#39;ve got what we
[3580.559s] love and uh and they&#39;re doing well I
[3582.64s] mean I can&#39;t tell you the amount of days
[3585.079s] that the market was getting smashed in
[3587.0s] February that our that our p&amp;l was
[3588.88s] positive it&#39;s I&#39;ve never seen anything
[3590.599s] like it it was just
[3591.96s] unbelievable uh mag 7 expecting Superior
[3595.2s] earnings growth THS is 493 but it&#39;s
[3598.039s] cutting in it&#39;s decelerating that&#39;s the
[3600.28s] big deal
[3601.839s] unmagnify is accelerating that&#39;s why
[3604.599s] these are going to outperform and those
[3606.319s] are going to
[3609.079s] underperform uh here
[3611.76s] is diversification is paying off what&#39;s
[3614.319s] the top
[3615.24s] performing Rel uh year-to-date Equity
[3617.96s] return versus the US China followed by
[3620.4s] Spain Italy Germany Switzerland France
[3622.24s] Mexico Nordic Netherland UK Emerging
[3624.92s] Markets uh and uh Japan is actually
[3628.0s] doing worse everyone couldn&#39;t get enough
[3630.16s] Japan last year and the year before
[3632.48s] value
[3633.44s] underperformed growth in the post great
[3635.68s] financial crisis decade but it has been
[3637.52s] more mixed since then it is bottoming
[3640.0s] just like it did in the early 2000s why
[3642.359s] this was an aberration called zerp zero
[3645.68s] interest rate policy it was the only
[3648.039s] decade in a 100 years where you if you
[3651.44s] could buy a basket of stocks trading at
[3654.039s] 10 times sales and now perform the S&amp;P
[3657.039s] 500 any other decade you did that you&#39;d
[3659.2s] lose 80 to 90% of your money within 48
[3661.799s] months um this will not happen again
[3664.359s] unless you think rates are going back
[3665.599s] down to zero then uh I wouldn&#39;t be
[3667.64s] playing that bet the name of the game is
[3669.52s] value is outperformed growth by
[3672.28s] 4.4% S uh since
[3675.48s] 1927 which basically means if you&#39;d put
[3677.839s] a million dollars up at that period and
[3680.839s] invested in value over uh growth you&#39;d
[3684.2s] have an extra 68 million of gains and
[3689.039s] that includes this operational 15 15year
[3692.359s] period where underperformed because of
[3694.68s] unnatural uh manufactured conditions of
[3697.88s] zero interest rate policy fed funds
[3701.0s] Target
[3702.559s] rate covered that Texas was weaker Texas
[3706.359s] manufacturing but Philadelphia was
[3708.559s] better uh GDP so this is consensus is
[3712.48s] going up to
[3713.799s] 2.3 uh that&#39;s not the type of
[3715.88s] environment where you see a recession
[3717.92s] household consumption is expected to
[3719.68s] grow consumer discretionary got
[3722.319s] shellacked here in February uh there&#39;s
[3725.359s] going to be some opportunities in that
[3726.72s] Rubble here is Tech relative to the S&amp;P
[3730.16s] 500 this is what they call a rounded top
[3733.119s] or a head and shoulders or whatever
[3735.599s] really is useless uh uh thing but worth
[3739.359s] noting I think on a relative basis okay
[3742.88s] it doesn&#39;t have to crash but on a
[3744.319s] relative basis I think we&#39;re going to
[3745.64s] see
[3746.44s] continued out performance this is not
[3748.319s] good if you&#39;re overweight in passive
[3750.64s] indices that are weighted to the um mag
[3755.319s] 7 or in the mag 7 names themselves this
[3757.52s] is not a positive development you want
[3759.64s] to see maybe it will be a fake out and
[3761.96s] then we get that rally in March uh which
[3765.079s] is fine but here&#39;s the positioning
[3767.599s] everyone is crowded to one side of the
[3769.119s] boat you can see it here we had a ton of
[3772.24s] data this week here is the bond starting
[3774.319s] to Rally here&#39;s a reverse Head and
[3776.72s] Shoulders bottom which implies a massive
[3779.64s] rally like we saw in 2018 here&#39;s bearish
[3782.96s] sentiment uh this is the a aii
[3785.44s] percentage of bears we have only seen
[3787.24s] this two other times since 1986 both
[3790.96s] were at or near major three times major
[3795.0s] bottoms you saw this level of pessimism
[3797.52s] in the covid lows you saw this level of
[3799.92s] pessimism during the great financial
[3801.64s] crisis lows and you saw this level of
[3803.92s] pessimism during the
[3807.839s] early 90s recession which was caused by
[3810.64s] a banking crisis and if you remember the
[3812.88s] Orange County real estate crisis when
[3815.64s] the Japanese money all pulled out I will
[3818.359s] be interested to see what happens with
[3820.96s] Orange County real estate uh in the next
[3824.279s] few years as Chinese money stops flowing
[3827.72s] out of China and stays in China due to
[3831.079s] fear of loss as everything else starts
[3833.24s] to go back up in China uh and you see
[3836.96s] more and more price Cuts in Orange
[3838.48s] County could be very very
[3842.079s] interesting and what else do you have
[3845.52s] here vix we covered Richmond
[3849.279s] manufacturing was good somu at the state
[3852.68s] level we got to keep our eye on here
[3854.88s] possible signal of
[3856.279s] recessions uh this is probably somewhat
[3858.76s] skewed by Washington DC so we&#39;ll keep an
[3861.119s] eye on it cover 10 your buying years
[3864.079s] Bitcoin has also gotten shacked down to
[3866.92s] 85,000 uh that kind of qualifies in the
[3869.76s] speculative uh bucket that we talk about
[3872.0s] a lot so that&#39;s getting hurt um here&#39;s
[3875.079s] the bull bear spread again you saw this
[3877.279s] level of pessimism at the 2022 lows if
[3879.68s] you remember that&#39;s when we were buying
[3881.48s] uh Amazon and Google deep in the hole
[3884.039s] when no one wanted it quick doubles
[3886.2s] within it was like a year uh so I think
[3889.119s] there&#39;s going to be really incredible
[3890.96s] opportunities in the next few weeks to
[3892.96s] be able to benefit as well this is UN
[3895.76s] believable pessimism coming out uh TLT
[3899.4s] bonds starting to dramatically
[3900.72s] outperform S&amp;P 500 in line with our uh
[3904.16s] themes for the year that you all
[3906.799s] know uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really exciting
[3909.839s] when you see all the pieces coming
[3911.4s] together as we had said uh in some of
[3915.48s] the foggy times I said hang in there
[3917.88s] when it comes it comes all at once and
[3919.599s] we are seeing that in Spades uh
[3922.24s] potential 1.5 trillion savings over 30
[3924.559s] years from G p 1es i mean you speak
[3927.079s] about productivity if they get glps down
[3929.88s] to you know 10020 bucks a month which
[3932.039s] they already have generics uh and they
[3934.799s] continue to do do to do all the things
[3937.52s] every single insurance company is going
[3938.839s] to sponsor them people are going to get
[3940.839s] fit and healthy and it&#39;s going to save
[3942.279s] trillions of dollars of health care
[3944.0s] costs if this continues at the same pace
[3946.52s] which is pretty exciting uh fewer jobs
[3949.64s] expected in the next six months so a lot
[3951.359s] of pessimism and uncertainty that&#39;s
[3953.48s] normal Trump 1.0
[3955.799s] uh manifesting in Trump 2.0 and the
[3958.559s] outcomes of 1.0 were very very good for
[3961.359s] the average worker uh minorities
[3964.039s] workingclass people did really well real
[3966.24s] wages did great uh conference board CEO
[3969.76s] confidence ticking up again this is what
[3971.839s] you saw in 2001 it&#39;s what you saw coming
[3974.64s] out of the great financial crisis off a
[3976.039s] very low basis this is actually very
[3978.76s] positive uh if I didn&#39;t mention yields
[3980.88s] going down let me just mention it one
[3982.44s] more time uh mortgage rates going down
[3985.2s] that&#39;s good China to start bank
[3987.44s] recapitalizations with at least $55
[3989.839s] billion M2 money supply in China turning
[3993.039s] up this is a big precursor to massive
[3996.279s] expansion
[3997.48s] [Music]
[3998.88s] um Magnificent Seven slides into
[4001.359s] correction territory the basket is down
[4004.039s] well over 10% now Tesla is down from
[4007.319s] almost $480 down to 300 so it took its
[4011.48s] post-election rally back uh at least 60%
[4014.96s] of it back
[4016.279s] and uh we&#39;ll see how that plays out
[4018.119s] growth versus value growth is getting
[4020.039s] shellacked I think this trend is going
[4021.88s] to persist value is going to be
[4023.279s] performing lots of money going to be
[4024.799s] made in value the right value not not
[4027.68s] value traps but um companies with growth
[4031.44s] with cash flow growing turning around
[4033.52s] that type of stuff US stocks are now
[4035.119s] lagging the rest of the
[4036.64s] world uh here&#39;s the news cor story count
[4040.68s] for firings job cuts and layoffs I
[4044.119s] haven&#39;t seen this record since late 2022
[4046.799s] that was a massive buying opportunity uh
[4049.76s] analysts are raising European earnings
[4053.72s] estimates Microsoft data center leases
[4056.48s] are slowing analysts say raising
[4058.76s] investor attention about demand for
[4061.119s] nvidia&#39;s products is basically what it
[4063.039s] comes down
[4064.079s] to
[4065.839s] um
[4067.52s] again after the aii bull bear belows
[4072.24s] Falls below -4 where it is right now one
[4075.2s] week later the Market&#39;s down on average
[4077.52s] 1% two weeks later it&#39;s up 14 basis
[4080.359s] points a month later it&#39;s up 2% two
[4083.319s] months later on average it&#39;s up almost
[4086.88s] 5% 3 months later 6% 6 months later 13.7
[4091.599s] 9 months later it&#39;s up 19% and one year
[4094.279s] later it&#39;s up 22% so this level of
[4096.44s] pessimism May in fact prove to be a very
[4099.0s] positive thing once the Bottom&#39;s in
[4101.0s] cycle composite this is where we are
[4103.4s] right now expect more rocking into early
[4105.56s] February and then straight up from there
[4107.56s] so a lot of things pointing to the same
[4110.759s] outcome most stocks are trading this
[4112.799s] from Seth uh golden most stocks are
[4114.96s] trading at their lowest correlation to
[4116.4s] the index or each other than at any time
[4119.839s] since 2021 which dampens the index
[4122.4s] ability to break out and or move with
[4124.44s] any meaningful momentum it&#39;s a stock
[4126.319s] Pickers Market folks this does not
[4128.52s] support double digigit returns in 2025
[4130.799s] we tend to agree you know I think the
[4132.44s] S&amp;P is going to be as we said uh fourth
[4135.48s] quarter last year it&#39;s going to be like
[4137.12s] a 7 to 9% year S&amp;P 500 and um and I
[4142.759s] think absolute unbelievable fortunes are
[4146.199s] going to be made under the surface for
[4147.799s] people positioned in the right way and
[4149.6s] in the ways that uh we&#39;ve been talking
[4151.48s] about for many weeks and months bull
[4154.239s] markets in the S&amp;P 500 1957 to date uh
[4158.4s] what you&#39;re seeing here again is the
[4160.719s] average gain is 145% in 52 weeks we are
[4165.4s] only at 71% in 28 weeks which means
[4167.759s] there&#39;s a lot of Runway left we agree as
[4169.88s] a reminder growth versus value this
[4173.359s] ladies and gentlemen zerp right here
[4176.199s] where growth outperform value that is
[4178.159s] the exception this ladies and gentlemen
[4180.719s] the red where value outperforms growth
[4182.799s] is the rule okay 4% 4.4% compounded
[4186.52s] since the late 20s if you get positioned
[4189.52s] on the right side of the boat ahead of
[4191.12s] the crowd fortunes will be made and are
[4194.32s] already being made ladies and gentlemen
[4196.239s] wink wink uh you know all you guys with
[4199.96s] eating your bananas sideways know what
[4201.56s] I&#39;m talking about uh US dollar Index I
[4204.84s] like this cycle
[4206.36s] index on Twitter I don&#39;t know who this
[4208.84s] is Jason P um I think this is correct
[4213.76s] the these things run in cycles and you
[4215.4s] can see here what is
[4217.88s] it I don&#39;t know what this is probably an
[4220.239s] 11year cycle or something like that
[4221.76s] they&#39;re not perfect but they&#39;re always
[4223.0s] worth
[4223.76s] noting uh cover that initial claims in
[4227.52s] Washington the highest since
[4230.28s] 2023 also is ticking up Nationwide so
[4233.679s] worth keeping your eye on that is
[4235.239s] deflationary everyone&#39;s worried about
[4236.96s] inflation worried about
[4239.4s] deflation uh 10year yield that&#39;s from
[4242.52s] zardi here is from Almanac Trader kind
[4246.52s] of pointing to the same thing little
[4248.56s] weakness in early March and then we
[4250.08s] start to take
[4251.32s] off that&#39;s that for the data let&#39;s go
[4254.36s] through some headlines and then we&#39;ll
[4255.52s] get back to the ask me anything
[4257.36s] questions we&#39;re just giving data like
[4259.96s] it&#39;s going out of style this week very
[4261.6s] exciting stuff China developers by land
[4263.4s] at 20% premium in bet on Market bottom
[4266.76s] what a difference a few months makes
[4268.76s] this Chinese AI bet has outperformed
[4270.56s] magnificent 7 names like meta and Google
[4273.0s] this year they&#39;re talking about Alibaba
[4275.719s] I mean opinion follows Trend alibaba&#39;s
[4278.08s] Core Business reignite growth as AI
[4280.239s] strategy delivers strong results we saw
[4284.239s] that AI related Cloud products delivered
[4287.32s] triple digit year-over-year growth for
[4289.199s] the sixth consecutive quarter with
[4291.08s] strong growth momentum ahead they are
[4294.08s] getting a return on their invested
[4296.679s] Capital unlike the mag 7 here that are
[4299.719s] just spending money like crazy and have
[4301.8s] yet to see returns don&#39;t doesn&#39;t mean
[4303.8s] they won&#39;t come but you&#39;re probably
[4305.719s] paying for returns that are tenuous at
[4308.12s] best what does Jack Ma&#39;s return to the
[4310.56s] spotlight mean it it means the game is
[4312.159s] back on there&#39;s Ean ping shaking hands
[4313.96s] with Jack ma two years years ago they
[4315.6s] wanted to hunt him down arrest him and
[4317.04s] kill him now they&#39;re begging him to come
[4319.08s] back and turn the country around and
[4320.56s] that&#39;s exactly what happened uh he is
[4323.04s] the poster child of innovation and all
[4325.6s] things positive in China business and uh
[4328.88s] they just realized with protest
[4331.4s] spiraling out of control last year and
[4333.199s] the year before it&#39;s time to make a
[4334.88s] change like all politicians their number
[4337.0s] one job is to stay in power and that was
[4340.12s] starting to be a coin flip and uh they
[4342.4s] pivoted but to G&#39;s credit he can a lot
[4345.56s] more pain than I anticipated uh but
[4348.4s] eventually he had to Blink and he
[4349.92s] absolutely did uh why Ean ping is making
[4353.239s] nice with China&#39;s Tech billionaires I&#39;ll
[4355.08s] give you one one word answer survival
[4357.719s] ant group hires for development of
[4359.92s] embodied intelligence humanoid robots
[4362.36s] for those of you who forgot 90% of the
[4365.36s] people chasing the price uh don&#39;t know
[4368.239s] as owners of Alibaba we own onethird of
[4372.28s] ant Financial Group which is the largest
[4374.52s] financial Serv company uh in Asia and uh
[4379.12s] that will wind up being ipoed and we
[4381.76s] will get a huge slug from that as well
[4384.239s] which is probably not yet priced into
[4386.08s] the stock here&#39;s the article uh from
[4388.6s] Rouser Sharma is China investable again
[4392.0s] you couldn&#39;t believe the number of
[4393.56s] articles in the financial times calling
[4396.04s] China uninvestable When Baba was at 60
[4399.36s] and now it&#39;s investable at 145 and it
[4402.96s] will be the best investment ever at 250
[4406.6s] mark my words and we will be helping
[4409.4s] people out as they all crowd into the
[4411.12s] boat begging for shares of China stocks
[4413.88s] we will help them out and give them as
[4415.8s] many of ours as they want a Chinese
[4418.6s] alternative to the Magnificent 7 has
[4421.159s] arrived uh this is kind of funny um my
[4424.32s] buddy Lou Bassin is the featured picture
[4428.639s] uh for a Bloomberg
[4431.12s] article uh about how good China&#39;s doing
[4434.44s] so uh
[4435.639s] I I was joking on our text group that uh
[4438.36s] the the Bloomberg bot must have just
[4440.08s] Googled you know find me the most
[4442.4s] handsome commentator and of course they
[4444.12s] all came from Fox Business so uh
[4446.8s] speaking of which uh here we go uh uh
[4449.76s] this is Dan IES on uh Ali on CNBC this
[4455.239s] week after uh Baba was up 80% saying
[4459.44s] that Alibaba will be the big winner when
[4461.36s] it comes to AI in China I couldn&#39;t agree
[4463.92s] with him more and uh super nice guy I&#39;ve
[4467.48s] had a chance to meet at some of the
[4469.239s] money shows uh and it&#39;s nice to see him
[4471.84s] start to get behind it uh now that it&#39;s
[4474.32s] working uh Z urges officials to stay
[4477.28s] calm as us raises pressure on China so
[4481.88s] at this point we&#39;ve covered all the
[4483.4s] impact on GDP if if Trump does the worst
[4486.4s] possible uh and the market is really
[4488.639s] just shrugging it off at this point it&#39;s
[4490.28s] already priced in a lot of the worst and
[4493.8s] um uh I think um I think it&#39;s going to
[4497.28s] be a case of sell the rumor by the news
[4499.88s] ant group&#39;s profit Rises with Jack mod
[4502.199s] back in the public I fintech firm saw
[4504.32s] profit jump 50 fold on investments ant
[4507.8s] made 13.6 billion Yan in profit for the
[4510.36s] quarter again we own a third of that
[4512.92s] Alibaba makes Sora Style video models
[4515.199s] open source as Tech Giant shows AI
[4517.679s] capabilities we all know that quen 2.5
[4520.8s] smoked open Ai and smoked deep seek on
[4524.48s] most metrics and that&#39;s why the stock is
[4526.92s] cranking Alibaba to ramp up AI cloud
[4529.719s] computing investment says quarterly
[4531.12s] profit surges 239
[4533.84s] per alibaba&#39;s AI bananja chump China
[4537.76s] comment and Premier Lee on raising
[4540.88s] domestic
[4545.679s] consumption uh here is from my buddy
[4549.08s] Brendan Ahern who runs the kweb ETF
[4552.0s] chinate Tech ETF and is a phenomenal
[4554.639s] golf off
[4558.4s] uh could a go public
[4561.0s] maybe uh ant added $618 million to
[4564.6s] alibaba&#39;s bottle bottom
[4571.199s] line and what else did you
[4575.6s] want possible yeah Trump&#39;s talking about
[4578.199s] having good relationship with Z though I
[4579.96s] I think you may have noted this week in
[4582.56s] that live press conference trying to see
[4584.96s] see the line that I wanted uh boosting
[4587.52s] cons quote
[4590.199s] unquote Premier Lee presided over a
[4593.239s] state council meeting the key point from
[4594.92s] the statement below is that it gives an
[4596.52s] indication of policies coming out of the
[4598.159s] Dual sessions in early March pay
[4601.159s] attention to this guys in poker this is
[4603.8s] called AEL this statement has the
[4606.48s] potential to have significant
[4607.88s] implications I didn&#39;t know you&#39;re a
[4609.159s] poker player Brendon we got to sit down
[4610.639s] and play uh quote boosting consumption
[4613.52s] is an important starting point for
[4615.36s] expanding domestic demand and
[4616.96s] stabilizing growth but also a major
[4619.56s] measure to change the medium and
[4621.4s] long-term development mode we should put
[4623.12s] consumption in a more prominent position
[4625.4s] and rely more on boosting consumption
[4627.679s] and to expand domestic demands smooth
[4630.04s] the economic cycle and stimulate
[4631.52s] economic growth we should make every
[4633.12s] effort to enhance consumption capacity
[4635.96s] adopt more effective consumption Pol
[4638.12s] promotion policies break the barriers
[4639.92s] and constraints restricting consumption
[4641.56s] and make every effort to optimize the
[4644.04s] consumption environment
[4645.44s] and to strive to open the chain of
[4647.6s] consumption driving investment
[4649.639s] industrial upgrading employment and
[4651.44s] income increase look the number one toll
[4655.04s] taker for consumption in China is Ali
[4659.199s] Baba okay they are the largest online
[4661.679s] retailer with tbal t-all uh if this is
[4665.08s] the direction the government wants to go
[4667.44s] no one is going to be a bigger B
[4669.239s] beneficiary than Alibaba so the game is
[4672.239s] just beginning uh Ryan Cohen boost his
[4675.36s] Alibaba stake to $1 billion paler
[4678.56s] insiders keep selling shares after4
[4680.8s] billion winfall in 2024 so just like
[4683.92s] Jensen Wong filing to sell a billion
[4686.12s] dollars in June when we put out our
[4687.76s] article basically which marked the top
[4690.04s] in the price uh had negative returns for
[4692.76s] their subsequent six months uh filed to
[4695.56s] sell 1.2 billion Alex karp is doing the
[4698.32s] exact same thing the palent tyrians
[4700.719s] Can&#39;t Get Enough stock and you know what
[4702.239s] he&#39;s going to help them out and dump
[4704.04s] billions of dollars of shares on their
[4705.639s] head as they all chase the shiny object
[4707.92s] and ignore what&#39;s going on Mara Lago
[4710.84s] Accord chatter is getting wall Street&#39;s
[4712.6s] attention this is a big
[4715.8s] deal so two things that they want to
[4718.56s] have happen it&#39;s going to mimic what
[4720.88s] happened with the plaza Accord in 1985
[4723.96s] it will be called the mara Lago Accord
[4726.8s] uh of course it will be a big beautiful
[4730.6s] deal uh the dollar will weaken which
[4733.159s] helps what which helps our emerging
[4735.52s] markets in China trade uh and it will uh
[4740.32s] there two aspects number one weakening
[4742.8s] the dollar and number two they&#39;re
[4747.36s] floating uh swapping some of their
[4749.56s] treasuries into hundred-year
[4752.159s] non-tradable zeroc coupon bonds if these
[4755.32s] nations needed cash quickly a Federal
[4757.08s] Reserve could make it temporarily
[4758.36s] available to them through a lending
[4760.32s] facility uh basically swapping it out
[4762.84s] for paper which would uh eliminate the
[4766.84s] carry or the negative carry on paying
[4769.28s] out the interest
[4772.44s] payments
[4776.12s] uh and lower the debt to GDP because the
[4779.28s] zero coupon trades at a huge discount I
[4781.719s] mean if they could pull it off what we&#39;d
[4783.159s] have to give an exchange for them to to
[4784.88s] take the swap uh would be very
[4787.12s] interesting but some institutions will
[4788.679s] want it so they can hold the marks on
[4790.239s] their books as at at
[4792.159s] par um if they actually pull this off
[4795.639s] this will be the greatest trade of all
[4797.719s] time uh in terms
[4800.56s] of I mean trillions and trillions and
[4803.36s] trillions and trillions of dollars saved
[4805.12s] for the us so that said the other thing
[4807.6s] that they announced is selling the
[4808.679s] golden visas for five million a pop and
[4810.88s] they could raise uh a quick
[4814.56s] um trillion or two trillion dollars I&#39;ll
[4817.44s] tell you if they want to raise the quick
[4819.12s] trillion to2 trillion doll what they
[4820.6s] need to do is put an expiration date on
[4822.199s] it and say we&#39;ll sell these bees for $5
[4825.08s] million a pop for the first 12 months
[4827.56s] after 12 months either a it&#39;s going to
[4829.719s] be discontinued if we&#39;re over subscribed
[4831.96s] or B it&#39;s going to be up to $10 million
[4836.48s] from that point forward so get all these
[4838.32s] $5 million in I mean they could get a
[4840.44s] million two a trillion two trillion
[4842.639s] bucks into the treasury super quickly
[4845.04s] and that would be something again that
[4847.56s] was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the
[4850.159s] beginning of this year so pretty
[4853.639s] exciting
[4855.199s] stuff all right let&#39;s keep
[4858.159s] moving got to move this button
[4863.96s] here
[4868.12s] okay best and republicans in Congress
[4870.84s] Kickstart tax cut talks I mean these
[4873.84s] guys must be working literally 24 hours
[4875.8s] a day the amount of things that they
[4877.679s] have going so some deflationary with
[4880.04s] Doge which is a good thing some
[4882.159s] unbelievable restructurings with the
[4884.84s] logo Accord then tax cuts on top of it
[4888.4s] then tariffs on top of I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s
[4890.76s] unbelievable what&#39;s happening hard to
[4892.0s] keep up which is why this call is so
[4893.96s] long this week but you got to know
[4895.28s] what&#39;s going on because uh in
[4897.8s] uncertainty is massive opportunity and
[4900.639s] by staying on top of all of this that&#39;s
[4902.28s] how we benefit from it and how we find
[4904.08s] these windows of generational

[5004.52s] currently is not that if you look
[5006.199s] through history when he gets his cash so

[5241.679s] everyone&#39;s no one no one still wants it
[5243.719s] at 7180 so there you go still
[5246.159s] opportunity from Left For Dead to loved
[5249.4s] again stock market and sentiment results
[5252.0s] we got wow this is this is uh we&#39;re
[5255.76s] rocking and rolling here uh um Jeff did
[5259.8s] a great article uh here put together all
[5263.08s] of our
[5264.44s] themes and basically started with the
[5267.719s] last Shelby First Healthcare Edition
[5269.639s] back in December we published a weekly
[5271.44s] article entitled Healthcare left for
[5273.08s] dead you can find the article here and
[5275.32s] then joined Neil Cavuto on Fox Business
[5277.239s] to break down our health care thesis
[5279.44s] listening here at the time the
[5281.119s] anticipated appointment of RFK Jr had
[5283.32s] rattled the healthcare sector with 62
[5285.159s] Healthcare components of the S&amp;P down an
[5287.48s] average of 19% from previous highs this
[5289.84s] was the last chap latest chapter in
[5291.88s] healthc Care&#39;s ongoing struggles marked
[5293.679s] by its worth worst period of
[5294.96s] underperformance relative to the S&amp;P 500
[5297.04s] since at least 1991 and its lowest
[5299.36s] overall weight in the index around 10%
[5301.56s] in over 25 years however over roughly
[5305.0s] the same period total us care healthc
[5307.159s] care spending more than tripled rising
[5309.159s] from 1.4 trillion in 2000 to 5 trillion
[5312.119s] in
[5312.96s] 2024 uh you could see the
[5314.719s] underperformance when we were on at the
[5317.0s] end of the year what made us even more
[5318.92s] Curious was that despite the weakness
[5320.52s] the sector was and remains projected to
[5322.52s] achieve the second highest earnings
[5323.92s] growth in 2025 expecting a 19% increase
[5327.239s] compared to the S&amp;P
[5329.32s] 12.7 same thing we talked about with
[5332.08s] materials uh remember in the short term
[5334.28s] the mark Market is a voting machine
[5336.0s] based on emotions in the long term it is
[5337.8s] a weighing machine driven by
[5339.08s] fundamentals so two months into the year
[5341.28s] how are things playing out so far
[5343.84s] healthc care is the number one
[5345.8s] performing sector technology negative uh
[5349.44s] consumer discretionary negative healthc
[5352.0s] care up 7.3 materials up 5.3 S&amp;P up
[5358.159s] 1.73 Healthcare is the top performing
[5360.88s] sector uh outperforming the SNP by 4.2
[5365.92s] times looks like the rumors of its death
[5368.719s] were indeed greatly exaggerated the
[5371.159s] reports of my death are greatly
[5372.36s] exaggerated that brings us to this
[5374.199s] week&#39;s first Focus B Baxter
[5376.36s] International for those who have been
[5378.119s] with us for a while you know Baxter
[5379.6s] represents a large portion of our health
[5381.52s] care
[5382.92s] exposure and as you can see this thing
[5385.8s] has done the same thing over and over uh
[5388.719s] for 40 plus years and they&#39;ve been
[5390.84s] around a lot longer than that this is
[5392.92s] just the price chart gets oversold every
[5395.6s] cycle they work through the inventory
[5397.8s] they recover because they have durable
[5400.04s] moat in their products uh as you can see
[5402.88s] the price fell for a reason cash flow
[5405.08s] fell they overstocked they did a dumb
[5406.96s] deal with h hillrom they then sold off
[5412.08s] um sold off some of their drug business
[5414.76s] raised a ton of cash paid down debt now
[5417.6s] the cash flow is going to start to hum
[5419.199s] again get back to growth and we are off
[5423.4s] to the
[5424.719s] races
[5428.84s] um excuse me sold off the kidney
[5431.119s] business I&#39;m sorry I got confused with
[5433.08s] uh uh sold up the kidney kidney business
[5435.4s] which was the lowest growing business in
[5438.04s] The Firm which put pressure on the
[5442.56s] multiple now that that slowest growing
[5444.679s] division is gone and they&#39;ve used the
[5446.8s] cash to pay down
[5449.96s] debt earnings are going to increase and
[5452.44s] then you&#39;re going to get a multiple
[5454.159s] reating from low double digits to
[5457.28s] probably closer to 20 and then you&#39;re
[5459.4s] going to get the growth back and this
[5460.84s] thing is going to be a double and more
[5463.36s] over time uh and we&#39;re pretty excited
[5465.6s] about so you should go through all these
[5467.159s] points that he underlined and starred as
[5470.199s] we do every week uh with different
[5472.52s] companies and see why we&#39;re confident in
[5475.6s] our position and uh and and we like this
[5478.56s] moving forward so they divested the
[5480.4s] lowest margin slowest growing business
[5482.6s] which was the Kidney Care business and
[5484.56s] got good money for it you can see the PE
[5487.76s] is depressed because of that it&#39;s going
[5490.36s] to expand back to I mean this is traded
[5493.08s] you know at 13 times now it&#39;s been as
[5495.28s] high as 30 times 25 times uh every cycle
[5498.4s] you get these Peaks and this time will
[5500.119s] be no different uh so go through
[5504.4s] this last shall be first China Edition
[5507.4s] for almost three years investors wanted
[5509.159s] nothing to do with Chinese equities with
[5510.679s] headlines week after week calling China
[5512.52s] uninvestable and stuck in a second bare
[5514.28s] Market foreign purchases of Chinese
[5516.119s] stocks dropped to an 8-year low in 2023
[5518.6s] with a prior low in 2015 which turned
[5520.92s] out to be a generational buying
[5522.48s] opportunity meanwhile 89% of global
[5525.639s] active funds held less than 5%
[5527.639s] allocation to the world&#39;s second largest
[5530.76s] economy uh so here are the headlines we
[5532.88s] went through hundreds from that one
[5534.36s] author at Baron&#39;s every single week I
[5536.56s] think she&#39;s been fired I haven&#39;t seen an
[5537.96s] article from her since Alibaba went up
[5540.159s] 80% um she&#39;ll be reassigned that&#39;s what
[5543.6s] that&#39;s what they always do like a priest
[5546.199s] send them to another Parish uh foreign
[5549.08s] purchases of of China stocks dropped to
[5551.119s] eight-year low in 2018 last time it did
[5553.719s] this preceded a monster rally in 2017
[5557.08s] and 18 and we we brought this chart to
[5559.36s] you uh While most were running for the
[5561.199s] exits we saw the disconnect between
[5562.679s] price and value as an opportunity Wall
[5564.159s] Street is the only place when they hold
[5565.639s] a clearance sale everyone runs out of
[5567.52s] the store for those of you who&#39;ve been
[5568.76s] with us for a while you know we&#39;ve
[5570.36s] expressed our China exposure through one
[5571.719s] of our favorite stocks in largest
[5572.96s] position Alibaba
[5574.4s] we started buying in the hundreds and
[5575.92s] backed up the truck in the 60s giving us
[5577.679s] a blended cost basis in the low 80s as
[5580.0s] part of our original thesis on Alibaba
[5581.84s] was that the performance and
[5582.8s] fundamentals reminded us of Microsoft
[5585.159s] from 2006 to 2013 during that period
[5588.36s] Microsoft saw Revenue up 112% cash flow
[5592.08s] per share up 200% earnings per share up
[5594.92s] 120% but the return on the share price
[5597.56s] was 0% over 7even years then a flip uh a
[5601.679s] switch flipped and Microsoft went on to
[5604.199s] deliver nearly 1,500% returns over the
[5606.96s] next 7 years 36% kager and if you look
[5610.199s] at the underlying fundamentals of what
[5611.679s] Revenue cash flow and earnings did over
[5613.32s] that period it wasn&#39;t much greater than
[5615.56s] when the stock gained 0% everyone thinks
[5617.6s] Saia did these miraculous things but the
[5619.96s] performance of the fundamentals was not
[5621.76s] that much greater under bomber bomber
[5623.92s] actually um created the foundation I
[5626.84s] mean yes so he missed mobile I mean you
[5629.679s] know can&#39;t take a joke but uh leaving
[5631.92s] that aside um it goes to show you when
[5635.119s] you hold the beach ball underwater long
[5636.639s] enough eventually the catchup is abrupt
[5639.239s] and it is massive and Alibaba will will
[5643.4s] look will be massive okay fast forward
[5646.0s] to Alibaba over the past decade it&#39;s
[5647.88s] even more pronounced holding the beach
[5649.36s] ball under water Revenue per share up
[5651.639s] 1,00% cash flow per share up over 500%
[5654.56s] earnings per share up over 500% share
[5656.88s] price was up 10% with mostly negative
[5659.88s] returns compared to 2014 levels before
[5662.159s] its recent parabolic surge and just
[5664.96s] beginning you can only hold a beach ball
[5666.4s] underwater for so long and sure enough
[5667.88s] the world seems to have finally Walken
[5669.159s] up to the fact what we&#39;ve been pounding
[5671.199s] the table on for the past two years
[5672.52s] Alibaba is the number one play on the
[5673.88s] recovery of China&#39;s middle class the
[5675.48s] number one cheapest Global AI playing
[5677.239s] essentially a China AI ETF Alibaba then
[5679.8s] went on to report blowout quarter last
[5681.719s] week and now it&#39;s all anyone wants to
[5683.88s] talk about if you wondering what we mean
[5685.76s] when we say opinion follows Trend look
[5687.76s] no further than the upgrades below the
[5689.4s] stock was hated in the 60s 70s and 80s
[5691.52s] but now at 140 investors can&#39;t get
[5694.84s] enough uh Morgan Stanley
[5697.4s] overweight moved their price Target from
[5699.679s] 100 to 180 up 80% Benchmark moved it
[5702.679s] from 118 to 190 Bernstein moved it from
[5705.159s] 104 to 165 Barkley&#39;s moved it from 130
[5708.199s] to 180 JP Morgan moved it from 125 to
[5710.719s] 170
[5712.239s] si uh I guess that&#39;s susuan moved it
[5714.92s] from 130 to
[5716.639s] 175 uh no more BR moved it from 130 to
[5720.639s] 172 Bank of America from 117 to 150
[5724.28s] Dan hives went on CNBC calling Alibaba
[5726.32s] the best AI play in China and presenting
[5728.199s] his base case of a valuation of $500
[5731.28s] billion market cap base case $200 and10
[5736.08s] $210 per share we agree not only our
[5740.4s] sside analyst turning bullish but
[5742.119s] Mainland investors via the southbound
[5743.8s] stock connect program continue to Pile
[5745.679s] in the total ownership of Mainland
[5747.199s] investors now sits at 6% of the float
[5749.56s] which we believe to still be in the
[5751.8s] early Innings analyst had initially
[5754.28s] projected $20 billion of inflows before
[5756.44s] the parabolic move and with peers like
[5758.88s] 10 cent and bil B having 10 and 15%
[5762.639s] respectively of their float held through
[5764.159s] the program these inflows still have
[5766.48s] legs and massive legs thereafter here a
[5768.84s] couple quotes from Brandon showing that
[5771.28s] that
[5772.44s] data and uh here&#39;s a breakdown of the
[5775.04s] report as you can see price followed
[5778.08s] cash flow cash flow is now even going up
[5781.92s] and we were always confident in this
[5783.159s] because we had the runway they had $80
[5784.56s] billion of gross $60 billion in net cash
[5787.96s] they bought back a ton of stock uh at
[5790.36s] the lows unlike most American CEOs which
[5792.679s] buy at the highs so they can dump out
[5794.28s] their own shares in China they buy at
[5795.8s] the lows which is actually the right
[5797.28s] thing to do um and uh and now cash flow
[5800.92s] is recovering on top of it and the game
[5803.32s] is on so you can see all the data here
[5806.0s] go through sector by sector growth
[5808.84s] between the international knocking the
[5810.96s] cover off the ball tbow and te- all
[5813.639s] monster business now growing again um uh
[5818.199s] t-all grew 9% tound t-all group grew 9%
[5822.36s] this is a huge business uh Cloud Revenue
[5825.6s] reignited double digits at 13% AI as we
[5828.679s] said triple digit growth for the six
[5830.679s] consecutive quarter so go through all
[5832.56s] these and go carefully through the
[5835.0s] conference call and the areas that we&#39;ve
[5837.84s] highlighted and you will see why we are
[5840.52s] so excited and just getting started and
[5844.04s] um long way to go
[5846.88s] here Etsy he did an update all you need
[5849.92s] to know is this thing is a cash machine
[5852.32s] so you&#39;re generating the same amount of
[5853.84s] cash as you were when it was a $300
[5855.719s] stock they just hit record revenues and
[5857.92s] you can&#39;t give away the stock so this is
[5859.48s] going to be another Alibaba everyone&#39;s
[5861.199s] going to be selling in the hole and then
[5862.84s] when it gets up to 100 120 everyone&#39;s
[5864.84s] going to be interested and that&#39;s just
[5866.8s] the way it goes they&#39;re going to turn
[5868.159s] the corner this thing is absolutely fine
[5870.84s] and they&#39;ve got everything they need
[5872.4s] strong balance sheet lots of cash pretty
[5875.08s] good leadership uh and a niche market so
[5878.159s] you can go through our our uh stuff
[5880.4s] there Canada Goose cash flow exploding
[5882.92s] again a lot of collabs had a cold winter
[5885.96s] everything&#39;s back on track with that uh
[5888.679s] pessimism fear and greed down at 22 this
[5891.08s] is when you want to be a buyer not a
[5892.36s] seller be selective and so on so great
[5895.92s] article there Jeff helped put that uh
[5898.119s] all together in a very great way uh
[5901.44s] earnings top IDP
[5904.239s] IBD top 50 growth index top 30 weights
[5907.08s] in the last 60 days the earnings
[5908.76s] estimates have gone up by double digits
[5911.56s] uh 11% and up 8% so keep an eye on some
[5915.76s] of these names that have been battered
[5919.239s] basic materials uh have gone down
[5922.599s] they&#39;re still trading in the hole this
[5924.08s] is going to start to inflect so this is
[5926.48s] where the puck is going to be going on a
[5928.239s] selective basis pay attention to that uh
[5931.76s] Cooper standard is for the first time in
[5933.44s] in a long time seeing Insider buying uh
[5937.52s] this is John mastrocola he is a director
[5941.679s] went into the open markets and bought
[5944.159s] stock at $15 and 1526 and
[5948.84s] 1455 for
[5950.96s] $118,000 look it sounds like a rounding
[5953.08s] error of lunch money but for most of
[5955.08s] these directors uh it&#39;s not a that is a
[5957.8s] huge amount of money and um so that&#39;s a
[5960.639s] that&#39;s a serious token and then the C
[5964.0s] fo uh who I&#39;ve met with a super great
[5966.719s] guy went in the market and also bought
[5968.639s] stock at $15 uh he bought about
[5971.56s] $45,000 and if you look at his salary
[5973.719s] you will see that that is a meaningful
[5975.679s] amount of money so these guys are seeing
[5977.8s] what we see and it&#39;s a great vote of
[5980.119s] confidence and uh kudos to them and
[5982.679s] they&#39;re going to make a ton of money and
[5984.04s] they absolutely deserve to make a ton of
[5985.679s] money and we&#39;re super excited to be part
[5987.48s] of
[5988.44s] it um
[5993.56s] okay so here&#39;s some economic data we&#39;ve
[5995.4s] got kind of gone through all that
[5997.28s] earnings were good guidance they took
[5999.56s] down seasonally which we covered and
[6001.52s] finally we&#39;re going to go through our
[6003.92s] ask me anything from our incredible
[6005.639s] audience so for those of you who just
[6008.92s] tune in for the podcast part uh you got
[6011.8s] all your data you got all your value
[6013.639s] thank you so much we&#39;ll be back next
[6015.0s] week same time same place for those of
[6016.679s] you who love the ask me anything
[6018.48s] questions as we go through different
[6021.199s] companies that audience members want me
[6022.88s] to take to look at um again this is all
[6025.639s] opinion not advice go to head fund tips
[6027.4s] click on terms listen to the disclaimer
[6029.08s] at the end of the video we&#39;re going to
[6030.76s] start now so let&#39;s kick it off to the
[6033.159s] second half of an exciting week Robert
[6036.96s] Holly understand your Advanced Auto
[6038.84s] Parts projects 7% operating margin looks
[6041.56s] like their average operating margin is
[6042.84s] around 10.5 given they expect to do
[6045.32s] below average historic operating margin
[6047.44s] 2027 is pred to assume they do below
[6050.08s] historic uh average net income margin 3%
[6053.48s] which would give them EPS around five4
[6055.4s] or5 a share for
[6057.679s] 2027 uh okay so 7 n times do you expect
[6062.4s] a profit margin greater than three I
[6064.36s] think you&#39;re going to see a lot of
[6066.32s] synergies and I do think you&#39;re GNA I
[6068.32s] think they&#39;re sandbagging this in the
[6070.199s] short term I do think you&#39;re going to
[6071.88s] see higher margins than that I do think
[6074.0s] you&#39;re going to see a hockey stick
[6075.28s] inflection of revenues that they&#39;re not
[6076.76s] even anticipating and then the synergies
[6078.56s] of the Hub and spoke as they get a
[6080.679s] concentrated foothold versus this
[6082.48s] disparate foothold on the west coast uh
[6085.08s] we like this story we agree with the
[6087.32s] bull thesis that we went through early
[6089.48s] earlier and uh we thank you for the
[6091.48s] question this for me uh with my eyes
[6094.28s] closed uh my view is that it&#39;s at least
[6097.56s] a double from recent levels and I think
[6099.599s] it&#39;s going to be a lot more as um Shane
[6103.119s] o Kelly uh just straightens it out we&#39;ve
[6106.32s] kind of done all the clean up now so
[6109.239s] we&#39;re basically cleared out the mest D
[6113.44s] stocked got the synergies going and now
[6116.36s] I think we&#39;re going to move into growth
[6117.56s] and don&#39;t forget they are expanding
[6119.92s] stores still in those areas and now the
[6122.719s] balance sheet you know you had when this
[6124.719s] stock
[6125.599s] dropped
[6130.599s] from you
[6133.0s] know
[6134.719s] $225 you know buying it in the
[6137.679s] 40s
[6139.32s] um you know it it looked like there was
[6141.639s] no end in sight this is this is this is
[6145.0s] just what happens it has these cyclical
[6147.199s] bottoms every handful of years they come
[6149.76s] in and they fix it this will be no
[6152.159s] different and now they&#39;ve got a better
[6153.639s] leader than they&#39;ve ever had in history
[6155.28s] so if this
[6157.32s] was you know a double I think happens
[6160.199s] with the eyes closed I think this could
[6162.679s] be a lot more than that if he can
[6164.96s] execute 50% on what he&#39;s saying I think
[6167.04s] they&#39;re going to catch a lot of
[6167.96s] Tailwinds that they&#39;re not expecting
[6169.719s] they&#39;re making projections on the basis
[6172.08s] of a very pessimistic Outlook right now
[6174.52s] and I think as things get better those
[6175.92s] estimates are going to go up just like
[6177.28s] with the analyst so uh we like this one
[6179.639s] and we love the fact that they&#39;ve deris
[6181.52s] the balance sheet uh massively from
[6183.679s] where when we initiated the position
[6185.76s] Steve Franks correct me if I&#39;m
[6189.0s] wrong the hell is
[6191.08s] this Advanced Auto Part same questions
[6194.199s] uh same theme don&#39;t send questions in
[6197.84s] twice ladies and gentlemen uh but thank
[6199.679s] you for sending the question Theo Dumont
[6203.48s] uh well done on Rolls-Royce again great
[6206.32s] turnaround call from turnaround Tom on
[6207.84s] Etsy I see the value play however it is
[6209.32s] not fully clear to me how they&#39;ll be
[6210.679s] able to protect against larger more
[6212.199s] Amazon already tried to knock them off
[6213.96s] and they shut the business down so if
[6215.96s] you research the company you&#39;ll find
[6217.639s] that uh Amazon did try to take take
[6220.56s] their um take their business and they
[6222.639s] realized that they couldn&#39;t compete
[6223.84s] against them in their niche market and
[6225.679s] that was the end of that so that&#39;s not a
[6227.679s] reason to be pessimistic Dustin D what
[6230.159s] are your thoughts on the recent memo
[6231.92s] Trump suggesting he could prevent
[6233.599s] investment in Chinese AI companies do
[6235.76s] you worry about Alibaba being D listed
[6237.36s] or potentially becoming completely
[6238.52s] restricted investment like Russian adrs
[6241.599s] uh China&#39;s too big of an economy for him
[6243.679s] to do that but yes I worry about
[6245.199s] everything all day long that&#39;s what my
[6246.8s] clients pay me to do is worry non-stop
[6249.119s] so they can just make money and go out
[6250.76s] and golf and go to the beach and enjoy
[6252.719s] life because they deserve it because
[6254.199s] they built incredible businesses or real
[6256.599s] estate investment portfolios or whatever
[6258.4s] they did they pay me to stay up and
[6260.119s] worry about it and that&#39;s why like if I
[6262.199s] had my brothers Alibaba would be 100% of
[6265.08s] the portfolio I would never do that
[6267.0s] because we have I we have position
[6268.4s] limits and we maxed out our position
[6270.44s] limit which is much lower than 100%
[6272.56s] that&#39;s why we own 8 10 12 companies why
[6275.88s] because there can always be something
[6277.52s] that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know
[6279.32s] but our two filter criteria is number
[6281.8s] one if anyone positioned in the
[6283.52s] portfolio went to zero would they take
[6286.199s] us out on a stretcher the answer is no
[6289.0s] and number two is would the remaining
[6291.0s] positions 9 10 position be enough to
[6294.36s] still outperform and reach our IR hurdle
[6297.44s] and the answer is yes so yeah that&#39;s
[6299.599s] always a risk and that&#39;s why it was
[6300.8s] trading at such a discount you don&#39;t
[6302.28s] know anything that anyone else isn&#39;t
[6304.0s] thinking about the key is is the dynamic
[6307.04s] has changed it&#39;s gone from an
[6308.639s] Administration that uh uh was everything
[6311.92s] about China is wrong let&#39;s not
[6313.28s] communicate to Let&#39;s Make a Deal pay me
[6315.92s] I mean that&#39;s all Trump wants pay me pay
[6319.36s] do a deal for the US consumers where
[6323.0s] we&#39;re either getting tariffs or we&#39;re
[6324.679s] getting advantages that we didn&#39;t have
[6326.88s] and if you help us make money uh the
[6329.0s] door is open and if you screw with us
[6331.599s] then we will take you down and the the
[6334.8s] direction it&#39;s going is let&#39;s make money
[6338.32s] together and that&#39;s what you saw so
[6343.76s] um I think that could could be a
[6347.119s] negotiating chip but I think that&#39;s in
[6348.36s] the rearview mirror people have been
[6349.52s] worried about adrs since net e in 2000
[6353.119s] every two years when the Market&#39;s down
[6354.92s] people worry about delisting when the
[6356.36s] Market&#39;s up no one cares and it just
[6358.639s] keeps happening over and over and over
[6360.119s] so maybe one day that will change but
[6362.08s] that&#39;s how you manage your risk you can
[6363.36s] never be 100% certain about anything but
[6366.239s] you play your odds when you&#39;re buying
[6367.719s] tremendous amount of value for low
[6369.119s] amount of price uh good things happen
[6371.44s] over time when they&#39;re good assets and
[6373.08s] that&#39;s what we continue to do and why we
[6375.0s] do it in more than one company is
[6377.04s] because uh anything is possible and um
[6381.239s] and that&#39;s how you hedge against it by
[6382.56s] sizing
[6383.48s] Simon staz
[6387.92s] staz thoughts on Western Union uh we
[6390.679s] covered that not not a not a business
[6394.92s] we&#39;re interested in numbers look good
[6396.639s] it&#39;s just not a business we want to be
[6398.239s] involved in it probably works as a trade
[6400.599s] but maybe you get a double if everything
[6402.36s] goes perfect but more likely than not
[6404.4s] it&#39;s dead money and a value trap Ruben
[6407.36s] Fernandez uh thoughts on Honeywell
[6410.4s] Elliot involved with $5 billion stake
[6412.96s] he&#39;s involved in crown castle too what
[6414.639s] has that done nothing yet um all right
[6418.28s] so let&#39;s do this honey well I generally
[6420.599s] like but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s come down
[6421.92s] enough I covered this two weeks ago no
[6424.199s] I&#39;m not I&#39;m not a buyer here um delvis
[6428.119s] long great podcast as always why to ask
[6431.159s] you about
[6432.28s] Buu uh weren&#39;t that interested in Buu
[6435.04s] given about while bu has remain relative
[6437.52s] stagnant do you see potential
[6438.599s] opportunity here yeah it&#39;s just going to
[6440.04s] take longer and your upside is going to
[6441.36s] be less all of them are going to work
[6443.04s] and the bigger they are the more
[6444.119s] security you have so I&#39;m not against
[6446.36s] that one but it&#39;s second or third best I
[6449.28s] want best Daniel Borman uh you mentioned
[6453.36s] eel various
[6455.119s] times uh okay so he&#39;s asking about the
[6457.599s] PE that is the exact wrong question and
[6460.199s] a lot of people get faked out by this is
[6463.04s] what you have to look at is normalized
[6464.84s] earnings when a stock is down 50 or 60
[6466.92s] or 70% it&#39;s obvious that earnings are
[6469.36s] either negative look what&#39;s your PE
[6471.36s] multiple if the company earns one Cent
[6473.56s] your PE multiple could be a million okay
[6476.48s] and the problem is is when you look at
[6479.48s] the turnaround and you look at what
[6481.0s] normalized earnings is I.E you know what
[6483.28s] were earnings last 10 years and what&#39;s
[6484.96s] the growth rate and and uh take out the
[6488.159s] aberration and see what it looks like
[6489.88s] three to five years out uh then the
[6492.119s] multiple starts to look like six times
[6494.08s] seven times eight times nine times and
[6496.159s] then you&#39;re getting a bargain so then
[6497.4s] you just have to be damn sure number one
[6499.599s] balance sheet is good number two there&#39;s
[6501.48s] still cash flow or strong balance sheet
[6503.52s] to Give Them Enough Runway to execute
[6505.719s] the turnaround plan to get back to
[6507.719s] normalized earnings or sometimes greater
[6509.88s] than normalized earnings then get the
[6511.4s] multiple reating then get your double or
[6513.599s] triple and then uh go play 18 holes Jack
[6517.96s] Z Tom was wondering your thoughts on
[6520.239s] Canadian cannabis company Kronos group
[6523.679s] uh I hate these stocks I hate everything
[6525.88s] about them
[6527.92s] um this is where money goes to die uh
[6531.239s] that said there&#39;s probably going to be a
[6533.04s] trade in them when they turn they turn
[6535.0s] hard but uh gambling is not the game
[6537.52s] that I play and they continue to lose
[6539.639s] money
[6541.4s] Simon don&#39;t send me questions twice
[6544.52s] thank you for sending it once though I I
[6547.199s] will not respond by the way to any of
[6549.719s] your amas I just answer them live I
[6552.08s] don&#39;t like send you a personal email
[6553.599s] like thank you for sending me I can&#39;t do
[6555.639s] that so send in your question I will
[6558.4s] answer it on the call okay and uh very
[6561.48s] grateful for doing it
[6563.32s] okay so here is Theo Dumont is asking
[6567.119s] about albam Maro a bunch of words
[6570.04s] basically saying what what if it doesn&#39;t
[6571.719s] work here&#39;s the bottom line with albam
[6573.639s] Maro okay has nothing to do with global
[6576.48s] EV demand has something to do with China
[6578.88s] EV demand Global stock is 40 million
[6581.119s] it&#39;s going to 120 million over the next
[6582.96s] three to four years that&#39;s going to be
[6584.36s] largely delivered by an
[6587.28s] artificially uh demand generated economy
[6590.28s] by government subsidy from China number
[6593.8s] one number two the Cur to high prices is
[6596.44s] high prices lithium goes through Cycles
[6598.679s] Alam Maro does this every cycle the good
[6600.679s] news is it&#39;s one of the greatest players
[6602.719s] so when they cut production and they
[6604.239s] have $3.5 billion of liquidity they can
[6607.199s] wait a year or two for all the smaller
[6608.76s] players to go out of business and then
[6610.56s] buy up their assets for pennies on the
[6612.239s] dollar and that&#39;s why you see even
[6614.239s] before Eves existed every five years the
[6617.32s] stock crashes 60% 70% and then it
[6620.52s] doubles and triples over the next few
[6622.119s] years oh over and over and over and
[6624.32s] that&#39;s with EVS without EVS whatever the
[6627.84s] same thing&#39;s going to happen now the
[6629.159s] difference is they have better liquidity
[6630.679s] they&#39;re in a stronger position than
[6631.8s] they&#39;ve ever been in and there is this
[6633.679s] Tailwind of this artificially subsidized
[6635.88s] Market which is going to continue to
[6637.28s] grow Grant KS thoughts on CCI delaying
[6641.44s] reporting I don&#39;t care I know what the
[6643.48s] assets are they&#39;re reporting in March
[6645.8s] and it probably means they&#39;ve got some
[6647.32s] more stuff to say which is good news not
[6649.28s] bad news uh so uh perfectly fine with
[6652.44s] that
[6654.28s] uh Stephen Frampton
[6657.0s] asks West Shore pharmaceutical and by
[6660.84s] the way Stephen does an incredible job
[6662.639s] with all of our videos just as Jeff does
[6665.679s] an incredible job with a lot of our
[6667.96s] admin and posts and helping Now with uh
[6671.48s] articles and all the great things that
[6673.159s] you guys are taking advantage of um
[6679.32s] wst uh yeah so I don&#39;t like to make
[6683.159s] bets
[6686.52s] on so it&#39;s in pharmaceutical packaging
[6689.04s] and delivering systems Delivery Systems
[6691.4s] let&#39;s let&#39;s take a closer
[6703.4s] look all right so cash flow has followed
[6706.239s] price and revenues uh so you just have
[6708.52s] to be damn sure what is the Catalyst for
[6711.079s] this to turn around
[6713.32s] um and the answer is uh that&#39;s that&#39;s
[6716.199s] work to be done but for me revenues are
[6718.88s] declining cash flows are declining gross
[6720.8s] margins are
[6722.0s] declining
[6723.599s] um uh and it hasn&#39;t come down that much
[6726.4s] I mean it&#39;s
[6732.0s] down let me just see
[6738.48s] here so when I get involved in a stock I
[6741.32s] I have to have at least at least a
[6743.239s] double or triple in a few years and this
[6745.079s] is like if everything goes right I mean
[6747.8s] maybe I would get a double and and I
[6749.639s] think it&#39;s just starting to break down
[6751.32s] this is going to take a half a year to
[6752.84s] probably build a base uh so no too too
[6756.4s] early but probably right idea you&#39;re
[6757.88s] just too early and the price is too high
[6760.56s] uh do send it back when it&#39;s in the
[6763.92s] hundreds uh probably like 175 1 15 and
[6767.239s] we&#39;ll take another look and see what it
[6768.96s] looks like but on the right track just a
[6770.84s] little early buddy Dominic harand wanted
[6774.4s] to say I love your podcast been a
[6776.239s] longtime listener had a question about
[6778.36s] option
[6779.96s] spreads uh blah blah blah okay some of
[6783.079s] that is proprietary and reserved for the
[6784.719s] benefit of our clients we have covered a
[6786.599s] lot of it in the past um and um so we do
[6791.639s] depending on the type of the account we
[6793.199s] do long-dated spreads we do in the
[6794.96s] monies we you know and there&#39;s a lot
[6796.96s] that goes into it in terms of implied
[6798.719s] volatility and pricing uh and
[6801.239s] expectations about where we see the
[6802.92s] price and by when and then you got to
[6805.52s] time it so um uh we&#39;re going to leave a
[6809.88s] lot of that benefit to our money
[6812.28s] management clients because they pay for
[6814.04s] it and um uh I&#39;ll leave it at that but
[6817.92s] um you know a good place to
[6820.56s] start is in the uh headed fund tips uh
[6824.8s] member section there are some book
[6827.84s] recommendations that um that are good
[6830.56s] place to start to learn the Greeks and
[6832.199s] start start to get an understanding that
[6834.48s] that world probably takes about 3 years
[6838.079s] of understanding and then three years of
[6840.079s] practice to be competent and then
[6842.679s] probably 8 to 10 years to be an expert
[6846.599s] um so I would just buy good stocks when
[6849.639s] they&#39;re down and get your doubles and
[6850.92s] triples in three to five years and don&#39;t
[6852.44s] think about it and use low leverage as
[6854.04s] the name of the game uh John Phillips
[6856.48s] qxo trading at blah blah blah five
[6859.639s] billion cash
[6862.719s] buying cash at a discount no because
[6864.52s] there&#39;s a burn and your numbers are
[6866.56s] wrong Nick Davis uh thoughts on Parson&#39;s
[6875.4s] Corp always double check your numbers
[6877.92s] with the source materials the public
[6879.599s] filings don&#39;t just trust some secondhand
[6883.88s] uh Parson this is a broken momentum
[6885.76s] stock it is not going to bottom anytime
[6887.8s] soon in my opinion I don&#39;t even need to
[6889.32s] look at the
[6890.36s] financials uh Matt
[6893.96s] tumba luck and coffee this was a
[6896.76s] accounting fraud so even if that went
[6899.719s] through
[6900.8s] bankruptcy
[6902.679s] um I just never trust those companies
[6905.199s] after that so I&#39;m going to just leave it
[6906.56s] at that it might work but um I don&#39;t
[6909.679s] take company and Country risk and that
[6911.679s] has both so Douglas Grant thank you for
[6914.88s] all that you do I listen to your show
[6916.599s] religiously every week you mention that
[6918.719s] you do not like really like recreational
[6921.52s] vehicle business
[6923.719s] I I like recreational vehicles I just
[6925.36s] don&#39;t like the businesses um
[6928.239s] Harley-Davidson no no uh not a good
[6932.4s] business never been a good business
[6934.119s] might be a trading vehicle let&#39;s just
[6936.44s] see
[6940.48s] here I mean the stock has done nothing
[6942.679s] in 30 years why would anything change I
[6944.8s] mean this is like you can&#39;t make this up
[6946.679s] so hard pass uh as a trade you could
[6950.04s] probably trade it up to 40 but who knows
[6953.56s] uh
[6954.599s] Gasper could you take a look at BASF and
[6957.52s] Dow Dow we&#39;ve already covered we
[6959.48s] generally like chemicals here
[6963.32s] um I this I&#39;m going to pass on that one
[6969.159s] BASF there are other better chemical
[6971.48s] plays which we&#39;ve covered in recent
[6973.32s] weeks go back to the
[6975.92s] amas uh BASF let&#39;s take a
[6980.719s] look I don&#39;t think there enough upside
[6983.079s] in this one even if you get a recovery
[6985.04s] but I&#39;ll just do a quick uh hold
[7002.4s] on now I I
[7005.36s] mean just show me how this is turning
[7007.639s] around I mean these revenues have
[7008.88s] collapsed the price stock is BAS stock
[7010.76s] price is basically the same I don&#39;t like
[7013.119s] that uh lee
[7016.719s] Foster AMA question for the Oracle of
[7019.88s] the
[7021.159s] OC that&#39;s hysterical okay would you
[7024.4s] check out the stock gaming Realms
[7028.119s] gml UK based gaming company Mobile
[7031.599s] gaming gaming software I I hate that
[7033.92s] business because it&#39;s a hits business
[7035.48s] and I can&#39;t predict the hits but I&#39;ll
[7037.76s] take a quick look at it um
[7058.159s] gaming
[7066.8s] Realms yeah I mean cash flows are rising
[7069.599s] revenues are rising but prices rised as
[7071.639s] well so
[7073.84s] um
[7075.48s] gmr
[7095.239s] DOL all right well you can see the chart
[7097.76s] here I mean
[7102.76s] I mean just tell me that they&#39;re going
[7103.84s] to keep hitting on all cylinders and
[7105.239s] I&#39;ll tell you to buy the stock I mean
[7106.96s] this thing looks like it&#39;s up a lot in
[7109.28s] anticipation of what what has happened
[7111.84s] the question is whether they can keep
[7113.119s] keep it happening and I can never guess
[7114.88s] on those businesses so I just stay away
[7116.639s] it&#39;s like you know betting on a
[7118.119s] speculative tech tech company are they
[7120.32s] going to get the next hit V
[7123.28s] vasari Helios Towers cell phone tower re
[7126.8s] in Emerging Markets
[7142.88s] htws so they&#39;ve been negative cash flow
[7146.159s] it looks like they&#39;re starting to
[7147.56s] recover uh this is too early for me and
[7150.36s] by the time I&#39;m ready it&#39;s probably
[7151.96s] going to be pricing it
[7153.88s] in I don&#39;t like this negative cash flow
[7159.199s] story uh yeah this looks a little bit
[7161.599s] like a
[7162.56s] I&#39;m I&#39;m going to pass I think you&#39;re
[7164.719s] right from an objective point of view
[7167.159s] but I think there&#39;s too many risks uh
[7169.48s] Travis
[7185.28s] monk okay so his question is why are
[7189.04s] there changes so late like gifting and
[7190.84s] all the things that they&#39;re doing to
[7191.76s] turn around the company is because they
[7193.0s] caught lightning in a bottle and they
[7194.48s] caught everyone at home who wanted to
[7196.28s] produce stuff when they were doing
[7197.88s] nothing and wanted to buy stuff when
[7199.4s] they were doing nothing and everyone got
[7201.199s] free money and the fact that they&#39;ve
[7202.84s] been able to grow cash flow back to
[7205.599s] those levels of once in a 100y year
[7207.56s] opportunities for that type of business
[7209.0s] is a miracle so now they&#39;ve got to catch
[7210.84s] up and innovate uh consistent with
[7213.76s] everything they&#39;ve been able to do and
[7215.56s] that answers your question could they
[7217.0s] could they have done better yes but if
[7218.639s] they had done better would we have had
[7220.079s] the opportunity to buy the stock
[7223.599s] down
[7227.36s] Etsy I
[7231.599s] mean we bought this thing down 85%
[7235.56s] so and cash flow is now exceeding the
[7238.96s] levels it was when it was a $300 stock
[7241.88s] so there&#39;s not a whole lot to think
[7243.04s] about here I mean basically the revenues
[7244.84s] could drop 20 something percent uh cash
[7248.159s] flow could drop meaningfully more and
[7250.32s] this would still be a cheap stock and
[7252.04s] instead they&#39;re actually doing all this
[7253.88s] stuff to re accelerate growth and they
[7256.679s] are in two out of three of their
[7258.639s] platforms and hit record revenues so uh
[7262.44s] my margin of safety is intact here they
[7264.76s] they&#39;ve already priced in worse things
[7267.32s] happening uh than than have much worse
[7269.719s] things happened that have happened and
[7271.199s] they&#39;ve given zero credit for the good
[7273.199s] things that are happening and those are
[7274.719s] the type of opportunities we like with
[7276.76s] asymmetry Michael oar
[7282.32s] your hi Tom your podcast have helped me
[7284.239s] understand the behavior of the stock
[7285.28s] market more than you can imagine
[7287.719s] question
[7293.239s] uh how do you reach a value for a brand
[7295.639s] premium over intrinsic value I give zero
[7297.599s] credit for the brand premium I look at
[7299.119s] the performance of the business and that
[7300.599s] tells me how valuable the brand is and
[7302.239s] whether they have a mode or not because
[7303.92s] I can see what type of returns
[7305.4s] uninvested capital and if they get above
[7307.159s] market returns on invested Capital that
[7309.199s] means they have above market value to
[7311.159s] their brand modee so I don&#39;t need to
[7312.84s] guess what it&#39;s worth I just need to
[7314.84s] look at what&#39;s the price and what do I
[7317.8s] get and if there&#39;s a Divergence between
[7321.04s] the intrinsic value I get and the price
[7322.84s] that I pay I&#39;m down and we make it a
[7325.8s] position and uh and we do right the
[7328.32s] turnaround they don&#39;t call me turnaround
[7330.239s] Tom for nothing uh Danny
[7334.639s] Chan okay for an internship Danny I did
[7338.119s] uh respond to your email I don&#39;t know if
[7339.56s] you got it so just double check Maybe
[7342.04s] went to spam uh want to get your opinion
[7344.679s] on
[7346.48s] chewy Pet Food business is a chronic
[7348.88s] loser but I think this one&#39;s going to
[7352.119s] work you know it&#39;s it&#39;s always the same
[7354.679s] story and it&#39;s already rebounded so like
[7357.0s] if you get a pullback to 30 or 25 I
[7359.159s] think this one&#39;s interesting um but I
[7361.719s] couldn&#39;t get enough conviction to buy it
[7363.92s] in client accounts because it&#39;s just not
[7365.639s] a sleep at night thing this is more
[7368.239s] speculative
[7370.599s] um and I was a little worried about
[7372.88s] self-dealing with the ownership Etc but
[7376.159s] uh I like it I mean I like it on a
[7378.96s] objective numbers basis I&#39;m I&#39;m cautious
[7383.88s] on the business it is just like
[7385.48s] recreational vehicles businesses I like
[7387.52s] the business I I like the objective
[7389.44s] numbers but I just know there&#39;s
[7391.0s] cyclical businesses that always fail um
[7395.32s] so kind of like miners
[7399.159s] so I get the theme everyone loves their
[7402.079s] I mean here in Orange County by the
[7403.88s] beach everyone&#39;s pushing strollers it&#39;s
[7405.84s] like wow everyone&#39;s having babies and
[7407.159s] then you look under the thing they&#39;re
[7408.32s] literally pushing their dogs in a
[7409.76s] stroller you can&#39;t make this stuff up I
[7411.4s] mean
[7412.4s] like it&#39;s unreal so
[7416.8s] um it&#39;s it&#39;s
[7419.92s] unbelievable I think you&#39;re right I
[7421.96s] think this thing has run up 3x already
[7424.52s] so you missed it and you know if it gets
[7427.76s] back into the mid-20s and the
[7428.96s] fundamentals continue to look good then
[7430.84s] revisit it but you&#39;re laid on this one
[7433.04s] and your thinking on it is
[7436.84s] correct and that&#39;s it we&#39;re done for
[7439.52s] today we&#39;ll be back next week same time
[7441.4s] same place in the meantime make it a
[7442.8s] great one bye for now
