He is extremely bullish on China, especially Alibaba, citing a regime change and a shift in investor sentiment. He also highlights opportunities in small caps, value stocks, and select healthcare and materials companies. He emphasizes the importance of stock picking and avoiding crowded trades.

- Regime change favoring value and small caps.
- Potential for a rally in March followed by a choppier market.
- Unbelievable fortunes to be made under the surface by stock picking.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a regime change, with a rotation out of expensive US AI plays and into cheap Chinese AI plays and other value stocks. International markets, particularly China, are poised to outperform. Deflationary forces are emerging, and a weaker dollar is expected. Stock picking is crucial in this environment.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Global Light Vehicle Sales | Recovering from COVID, with production expected to increase. | Cooper Standard is an awesome position. Management is sandbagging production numbers to keep OEMs at bay. |
| US Equities Share of Global Equity Market | 56% share, but only 44% of earnings. | A huge premium for US earnings power, indicating potential for international outperformance. |
| Bearish Sentiment | AAII percentage of bears at levels seen near major bottoms. | This level of pessimism may prove to be a very positive thing once the bottom's in. |
| China's M2 Money Supply | Turning up. | A big precursor to massive expansion in China. |
