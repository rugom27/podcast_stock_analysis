  "cleaned_transcript": "I said that um Nvidia earnings would probably be good the key would be the reaction and he's and then he puts me right on the spot so would you buy it here today or do you think it's going lower and I said I would not buy it here I do think it's going lower and here's why and sure enough uh um dropped 8% today and you're going to find out exactly why because some of you are probably still confused even though if you've listened to this podcast you knew this was coming uh for a long time we put out the article on June 20th it had negative returns uh since then and uh more negative returns after today so listen in to the great Stu Varney the markets please now it's a sea of red the Dow is off 40 S&P down 30 look at the NASDAQ go down down 1.2% uh check out Nvidia please they report tomorrow uh after the closing bell uh they're down 2.4% as we speak let's bring in Tom Hayes he joins me tomorrow uh the the big deal is the call that comes after the release of the numbers that's what's going to make or break that that particular stock what are you expecting on the call well that's it absolutely right steu guidance is is the name of the game and the theme of this earning season has been great earnings and revenue uh we had earnings growth of 16% for the S&P but the guidance was weak S&P earnings came down from 275 estimates down to 270 some some shops have it below Nvidia is going to be no different I think earnings will be good uh but the name of the game is going to be guidance good news is mag 7 committed to $300 billion of spending the deep seek did not shake the mag s they said we're going to spend 300 billion the bad news for NVIDIA is they don't control their own destiny uh they are at the mercy of Taiwan semiconductor who has limited capacity which is why uh four months ago when Intel dropped below 20 on your show we said buy it the government is going to stand them up they've got a 17 billion doll Revenue Fab business they're eventually going to help Nvidia but for the time being uh their data SE data center Revenue growth has been decelerating a year ago it was 250% when you're growing at $4 billion per quarter and the base is getting bigger by the end of this year their revenue growth is going to be below 50% still sounds good but when you're trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings sometimes you need to take a break and that's why Nvidia stock price has had negative returns since June so you would not be Buy buying Nvidia at 127 this morning because you think there's a good shot that it goes lower after tomorrow's earnings call correct correct what about Microsoft they're back to $400 even well what about them look magnificent 7 we've been warning on your show for a couple of months to trim back magnificent 7 not because they're not great companies it's just prices what you pay values what you get and what you have seen year to date is the Magnificent 7 is down 1 and a half% year-to date why because their earnings growth again is decelerating from 33% last year to now it's expected to just be 16% this year because of all the capex because of all the spend without a clear near term return and you know the market likes near-term returns too uh so that's why and the multiples are still high even though the earnings growth is coming down people are getting wise to that and they are putting their money El elsewhere in the unmagnify and in international European stocks up 10% year-to date emerging market stocks up 7 and a half% year to date we hear you and Microsoft is killing me uh thanks very much indeed Tom Hayes great to have you with us thank thank you Stuart and we're back moving on I will be speaking at the money show in Miami on May 15th through the 17th Hyatt Regency Miami my segments are on the 17th I'm on the main stage at 12:15 p.m. on Saturday and then my own room at 145 I'll be talking about some turnaround picks and second half Outlook as well as how the uninvestable became investable so we'll do a breakout on China which will be exciting\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhen you&#39;re growing at $4 billion per quarter and the base is getting bigger by the end of this year their revenue growth is going to be below 50% still sounds good but when you&#39;re trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings sometimes you need to take a break and that&#39;s why Nvidia stock price has had negative returns since June so you would not be Buy buying Nvidia at 127 this morning because you think there&#39;s a good shot that it goes lower after

that we referenced with Stu uh regarding Nvidia so so people are shocked why is NVIDIA down 8% da it's because their growth rate is decelerating and that's okay if you're trading at 10 times earnings it's not okay when you're trading at 30 times sales and 45 times earnings so basically they and by the way the one thing I didn't expect that happen is their gross margins are eroding as well uh other than that how was to play Mrs Lincoln so uh here's what you see in data center revenues they have uh grown $4 billion per quarter for basically the past year uh and that sounds great and it is great okay the problem is is the base keeps getting bigger and the growth rate is decelerating was 250% off a small base last year uh you know and down uh this this quarter was well below 100% and will be well below 50% before the end of the year on top of that now you have margin worries you have competition worries and because of deep seek their Edge called cuda which everyone thought was going to be the next apple Walled Garden has proven to be not the case so all they become is exactly what they've always been which is a commodity producer and it will be erased to the bottom with margins as more

TECHNICAL_CHARTS moving along here&#39;s the Russell just consolidating here this is a huge what they like to call cup and handle we don&#39;t really care much about that stuff but we do pay attention and we don&#39;t ignore it and the implication of that is that you get a measure move so figure about 800 points which would imply uh you know 40% above the highs here and I think this is just getting started and people say well that&#39;s a fantasy you know you&#39;ve You&#39; wanted to see small caps go for a while well small caps have gone a lot okay for a while so uh we&#39;re absolutely right about that and uh we think it&#39;s just just beginning and all you need to do is follow the earnings growth S&amp;P 500 at you know 134% uh and small caps depending which index you look at between 21 and 45% whether you&#39;re looking at the small S&amp;P 600 or the Russell 2000 uh\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the Russell just consolidating here this is a huge what they like to call cup and

hangsang index breaking out here from the base the relative for the S&P turning up aggressively here&#39;s the Hang sang on a daily breaking out to all-time new highs my guess is we break higher go back and test it before making the next parabolic move same thing here here&#39;s what Robert sler has to say about Alibaba continues to carve out longer term bot pattern after rallying 80% from its January low Baba is likely to start to pause uh just under its 38% retracement level near $157 first support is near $1 120 followed by 105 yeah I think we&#39;re going back to 120 um I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going back to 105 but I could definitely see this this huge base breakout back test and then straight up uh and probably next stop after that would be 188 or 219 uh and um welcome to the party ladies and gentlemen early days but uh if you get a move back to the low 120s and you don&#39;t have enough stock that&#39;s probably where I&#39;d buy it uh can I guarantee we&#39;re going to go back down to 120 before we take off no it might take off you know as I said uh when we were down in the 70s and 80s I said when this thing moves it&#39;s not going to let anyone in and it absolutely didn&#39;t I mean straight up 80% uh in a blink you know matter of weeks and everyone top ticking it at 140 so probably got to wipe out some of those weak sisters before we go to 200 uh here&#39;s in a new quarterly Revenue growth we thought uh even if they did the 4 billion um you know the stock would be down and now their guidance is they&#39;re they&#39;re actually not even able to do the 4 billion so uh this thing is is going to trap trapped a lot of retail investors chasing the shiny objects and that&#39;s the way it goes history repeats uh history doesn&#39;t even rhyme it repeats I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s just so clear as clear as the sky is blue uh fizer is interesting been a notable lagard but is showing early signs of bottoming in the mid-20s this one is starting to be interested interesting in the healthcare theme so uh we&#39;ll continue to pay attention to that re regeneron is a proxy for biotech I think the same story here that Schumer is pointing out from his technical standpoint we like from a fundamental standpoint and uh I think we&#39;re going to see some great things happening with biotech crown castle uh nice of him to cover this one uh thanks over there notably lagg but showing early signs of bottoming and weekly momentum moving up further upside from current levels you know we think this goes to 140 over the next 12 to 24 months plus you get a 7% dividend yield while you wait they&#39;re selling off the uh Capital intensive low return fiber business for over eight billion to Z group they&#39;ll use that to pay down debt buy more towers and the 40,000 Towers they have require like zero capex they just mint money I mean if you think the treasury prints money you should see uh Crown Castle&#39;s primary business of the 40,000 Towers it just they have to do nothing and it just keeps spitting out cash so I want to own that and when I can do it at a you know 60% discount from its recent Peak I&#39;m going to do it all day long and collect the big dividend yield lock that in in the meantime this could wind up being something you own for 10 years and the dividend keeps going up so you wind up with like a 10 15% yield on your basis and you double your money on top of it uh that&#39;s what I like to do cha-ching cha-ching uh Advanced Auto Parts everyone&#39;s you know bitching about the earnings and whining uh

Auto Parts for years moreover bulls have shown patience and understand the transformation will take time they believe Advanced a Parts is managing expectations to realistic levels as such they don't completely understand why the stock closed down Bulls are confident that after the store closures are done in March and the company turns its Total Focus to its various growth initiatives the fundamentals of the business will start to improve moreover Bulls were pleased with AAP stated its largest strategic cons customer renewed a multi-year contract with Advanced Auto Parts and believe Advanced Auto Parts accelerates 2025 vendor conference returning is a good sign that vendors do in fact want to support Advanced Auto Part altogether bull the Advanced Auto Part as the most levered opportunity to get involved in the auto aftermarket and as such will benefit nicely when the industry sees Improvement Allin bulls have a line of sight to $4.50 e EPS at the end of 2026 you apply a growth rate to that when they're recovering the market will give them benefit of Doubt rate it to 18 to 20 times and then they'll start to do more than that and if you look at their Bal sheet now since they to sold off the Canada business the name of the game with turnarounds is solvy risk and they've solved that they got uh I think I looked 1.8 billion dollar of cash on the balance sheet paid off a bunch of debt winner as a jockey so I I love these stories absolutely love these stories here's Nvidia over the last few days down from 143 to 120 uh here's palent here from 125 down to 84 shiny object Slaughter Fest this was uh these are for those of you are wondering this is a rounding error maybe it turns into a big business but for those of you wondering Cooper standard um which is a big position for us has the ceiling systems around the doors fluid transfer systems uh supplies to the oems but they also have this business because of their rubber technology that they just started partnering with Nike on a lot of their high-end sneakers for runners and longdistance Runners so if you Google Nike react X shoes that rubber is from Cooper standard and they get paid big on every single unit sold and it seems like more and more units are being sold so that could be something that's not even on our model uh which would be uh added whipped cream and a cherry so uh keep an eye on that Rising demand for protection open interest in vix calls has jumped relative to put options so this is the type of environment that you probably want to stop selling in the hole if you've been doing that and start to look for things to buy    I think we pretty flushed out here's from Ryan Dietrich today is historically the worst day of a weak month during one of the weakest times of the year so we're probably and we had warned you guys second half of February you can go look at the tapes on Varney Etc expect some volatility uh all of that that has shown up more sanguin about March and then following through there so uh it's time to deploy some Capital out of sync a gauge realized correlation is hovering near the lowest level ever what does this mean it means this is the best time ever to be picking stocks and the worst time ever to be in passive uh indexes exclusively uh speculators further reduce depending what passive indexes you're in also speculators further reduce net bullish bets on oil so a lot of people are selling oil in the hole which makes me continue to be interested in finding some more exposure Beyond comp stock resources which has been a home run uh so we'll continue to be patient and look for opportunity there but in no rush LG exports rise to an all-time high which is why we played the natural gas comp stock uh uh in the eights and nines and now it's uh I think it's in the 20s again uh and just getting started the relationship between sell through and production so Jeff uh put this out uh and basically did the overlay vehicle sales versus production 1990 to 2024 again exact same line uh six out of seven cases where annual production deficits exceed 1 million production rebounded by an average of 8.5 annually over the next two three years so there's a huge catch up even if they're right um if the 2025 deficit holds this suggests that production could reach 16 million Vehicles by 2026 and exceed 17 million by 2027 so in some sense you hope they're right sandbagging because then it's just a hockey stick but I think uh they're going to be wrong and we're going to be up around 16 million production and they're going to Mint a lot of money to the bottom line and we'll see a couple bucks of earnings and the market will give it credit for a few more bucks than that and this thing will start to hum you know for those of you who are brand new uh they earned you know this is a $15 stock we started our initial positioning and public uh uh went public on the claim and countdown in May of 2022 you can go back to the notes    built a basis around 550 we've added over time as new clients have come in uh base is still well below 10 and then    so the premise was that the stock on 17.1 million SAR in 2017 Peak earned $719 a share and traded at $146 uh they've taken 600 some OD million dollars of cost out of the business we believe that because of their efficiency now as the volumes recover continue to recover as they do every single cycle uh without fail to somewhere between 17 and 18 million uh sell through Peak uh they're not going to earn $7 this cycle we think they'll earn it north of $10 and maybe they don't get the 20 times multiple they got to be a $146 stock but what if they get a 10 times multiple on $10 of earnings versus a 20 times multiple on seven you still have a $100 stock and what they get a 15 times multiple and you got $150 stock and God forbid they actually get a 20 times multiple    you have a higher stock than that so we like our odds and we like Management's execution    the other thing that we have\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nseven cases where annual production deficits exceed 1 million production rebounded by an average of 8.5 annually over the next two three years so there&#39;s a huge catch up even if they&#39;re right um if the 2025 deficit holds this suggests that production could reach 16 million Vehicles by 2026 and exceed 17 million by 2027 so in some sense you hope they&#39;re right sandbagging because then it&#39;s just a hockey stick but I think uh they&#39;re going to be wrong and we&#39;re going to be up around 16 million production and they&#39;re going to Mint a lot of money to the bottom line and we&#39;ll see a couple bucks of earnings and the market will give it credit for a few more bucks than that and this thing will start to hum you know for those of you who are brand new uh they earned you know this is a $15 stock we started our initial positioning and public uh uh went public on the claim and countdown in May of 2022 you can go back to the notes um built a basis around 550 we&#39;ve added over time as new clients have come in uh base is still well below 10 and then um so the premise was that the stock on 17.1 million SAR in 2017 Peak earned $719 a share and traded at $146 uh they&#39;ve taken 600 some OD million dollars of cost out of the business we believe that because of their efficiency now as the volumes recover continue

Management&#39;s execution uh the other thing that we have here is\n\nso you know if bessin is successful and I&#39;m right and um 10year yield ticks below four not only does it help housing we&#39;re going to see the financing loosen tremendously on cars as well uh and we&#39;ll be Off to the Races the role of incentives as a leading indicator we&#39;ve been pounding the table on this over the past two decades incent as a percentage of ATP has a average 9.8 when incentives exceed 11% um oems typically adjust production upward by 5 to 7% within the next quarter to meet anticipated demand that&#39;s from Cox automotive industry estimates suggest incentives could reach 11% by 2027 driven by slower EV adoption and the need to clear out older IC vehicles from current levels this could push sard to 17.5 to 18 million units ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nanalysts are raising European earnings estimates this was not on most people&#39;s Bingle cards for those of you who had been listening we were pounding the table on International and that&#39;s been the lead performers discretionary versus Staples rolled over Market got defensive in February completely natural uh xlk to spy uh starting to roll over a little bit bit uh discretionary R rolled over a little bit financials softened a little bit Industrials energy started to tick up materials started to tick up Health Care started to tick up which was a key theme for us staple started to tick up all the defense have started to tick up keeping a close eye on the Japanese 10-year treasury jgb yield and this is basic basically axy for the carry trade on wine a lot of which free Capital found itself in the mag 7 as that money is no longer free in the Japanese carry trade as inflation picks up and if to raise rates money is coming out abruptly and there&#39;s a lot of force selling and that&#39;s going to continue and that will continue to pressure those stocks and those indices and the fortunes will be made under the Surface by those picking the stocks where price is what you pay value is what you get you&#39;re getting good multiples for good growth and that&#39;s why alibaba&#39;s up 80% uh that&#39;s why so many other value stocks we&#39;re starting to see take off here&#39;s again carry trade on wine what&#39;s what&#39;s happening it&#39;s moving right back down to those levels that we saw share of spending by income group uh top 10% of earners now account for half of spending you know this is this is not news it&#39;s certainly elevated a little bit but but um what you see is under Trump one is started to normalize and I think under Trump two it&#39;s going to normalize the lower strata did on a relative basis the Improvement for the lower strata under Trump one was orders of magnitude greater than it was for the higher strata and I think we&#39;re going to start to see that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in Washington DC so they are gutting uh the public sector uh that is deflationary apartment deliveries this is kind of fascinating so there was kind of a glut and that&#39;s you know the cure for high prices is um they saying Commodities SEC cure for high prices high it&#39;s high prices um and they glutted the market so now the deliveries are so that will create the setting for a shortage some years out mind the gap performance here&#39;s hang sang Tech dramatically outperforming the NASDAQ 100 on no one&#39;s else&#39;s bingo card except the listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes my awesome awesome uh group here that I&#39;m so grateful to do every week for you uh percentage of stocks in the S&amp;P 500 outperform in the index so this is starting to pick back up same as it did in 2001 what happened 2001 to 2007 again small caps Emerging Markets value dramatically outperformed the regime change is here it&#39;s already happened and it&#39;s going to continue to happen for at least the next handful of years this bull market might be two but is still young so for everyone looking for the exits yeah you should be you should have been looking for the exits if you were in the wrong stocks if you were in the right stocks and um paying attention to Value versus price and not chasing shiny objects you&#39;re you&#39;re happier than a hyena but if you&#39;re in the wrong stocks and you&#39;re saying I got to get out of everything keep in mind the average bull market uh is still young the average age of a bull market is 5.5 years we&#39;ve only been going 2.4 years the average gain is 196% 191% and we&#39;re only up 71% short Ines for the typical stock remains low versus history when&#39;s the last time you saw this low 2001 what happened the next five years International small caps value uh all the stuff we love and China uh higher January and February could mean the bull continues State data from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson he also has some data here talking about uh Mondays and Fridays being terrible in 2025 so there you go announced BuyBacks as you can see it&#39;s shifting it used to be all Tech but they&#39;re now uh spending that money aggressively and defensively on AI and uh that&#39;s hurting their margins it&#39;s decelerating their earnings growth it&#39;s decelerating their return on invested capital and it&#39;s limiting their ability to buy back shares which was a huge driver of eps growth for many many years during Zur from 2010 uh till recently now financials are starting to lead the BuyBacks Healthcare is starting to lead the BuyBacks Industrials Etc so pay close attention regime change

so that is from uh Seth golden price to sales for S&amp;P 500 again this is super elevated and largely because of the concentration of the mag 7 it&#39;s why we continued to say if you got to be in an index move to equal weight move move away from overweight mag 7 and all of them are down now some you know 17 to 20 something percent some even more um uh and maybe we get a bounce here for sure uh I wouldn&#39;t be worried about that but I think the underperformance theme is going to continue if they&#39;re not going to crash like 2000 which I believe they are not uh they are going to consolidate and given the gains that they&#39;ve had the consolidation might be a lot more and longer than most people think until they change the index waiting which S&amp;P always does uh then the indices will start to outperform and these stock will be a much lower waiting uh in the meantime these type of extremes you do not want to be on that side of a crowded boat that is how you drown so uh\n\nannounced

opposite side of the large Traders and hedge funds and we want to be in line with the commercials when the commercials are buyers uh price tends to follow right now commercials are in fact buyers it doesn&#39;t always work but it works a lot of the time at inflection point so our inclination is to be more constructive on energy but we are in no rush to do it\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is

they&#39;re making the case that we&#39;ve had a lot of these 5 to s% pullbacks in momentum and then they bounce back it could be the case um so you know just be open-minded to that that would make sense if the indices are going to rebound a little bit in March uh but for the long-term gains you want to start to be moving away from the crowd and skating to where the puck is going to be not where it&#39;s already been in the rear view mirror\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nseasonality for the presidential cycle year one since 1929 February is the worst month March recovers April is awesome May is awesome June is a little weaker July is awesome fall gets weak and then you finish out okay so I think we're going to get a lot of gains in a short amount of time here into the summer and then we'll probably start to harvest some and uh look for more defensive opportunities as we get into this window uh and go from there here are the PE evaluations relative to history uh you're seeing some bargain levels in real estate uh what is this P oh absolute PE so energy is low and then relative PE here's where you F here's where you're overpaying is information technology consumer uh no consumer discretionary looks okay over the last 10 years uh Industrials I think that's probably skewed by a few companies like cat Etc uh but here's where you're finding more of the bargains Staples materials utilities real estate Health Care financials and energy this was the small cap chart I was telling you about uh we agree with this View you know but sometimes look it comes back up to this top it consolidates for a little while before it takes the next Double higher gets up to the top consolidates before doubling to the next level higher so this wouldn't surprise us at all um and this does look similar to that early 2000s period as well that we've been continually talking about uh bearish sentiment well we'll we'll see the more recent readings they got completely flushed out us share of global Equity market so they have 56% and and this is why we've been telling people to get some International us equities have 56% share of the market but we only have 44% of earnings so that is a huge uh premium for this for that earnings power uh and as you can see if you look back past 5 minutes that is not always the case and these always they diverge and then they converge and you don't want to be on the side when they start converging which I believe they're going to be doing in coming years be Bears argue us exceptionalism has peaked and say 90% of equities are overvalued I disagree with that statement uh but I do believe that you're going to start to see some outperformance in international and what's going to surprise everyone as they took all the weightings down in China is it's going to be driven by China and uh all the hot money that ran into Japan and India to hide uh in the last few years is now going to come rushing out fomo they're all underperforming they have no exposure as matter of fact Brendan Ahern of kweb did a write up on that they're all screwed they missed this 80% move and now they're got to chase Pile in otherwise they're gonna you know any International active manager that's been hiding out in India and China is toast India is at 52 we lows uh Japan is is uh it's basically done and now uh China has uh left the gate and not let them in so they're going to have to panic Chase on any dip to buy and if you get a gift of Baba at 120 125 um you know and you don't have enough exposure that's going to be probably your last gift and I and I don't think there are any guarantees we get that by the way I think pay at this point is going to keep pushing higher and forcing people not to be in and then you know at 200 it'll pull back you know everyone will get in at 200 and it'll pull back to 175 and scare the out of everyone um all the Johnny come lately is that you know we're selling at 60 and we'll be buying at 200 and then they'll get roasted and that's just it's not to be like mean or arrogant it's just to say that these patterns repeat over and over and over and if you understand them you can say oh I see what's happening uh and and especially if you if you've done the work on the fundamentals if you're just listen to a guy uh and not doing your own homework or or not allocating then um you got to do the work us has looser labor regulations and lower unionization if you build it they will come what they're talking about\n\ned I disagree with that statement uh but I do believe that you&#39;re going to start to see some

about the mic I bought a sh mic it&#39;s supposed to be the best one so in the comments Below on YouTube let me know if there&#39;s any Improvement this week I had the yeti which was fine for some reason it uh didn&#39;t people wanted to hear it better so I got the best mic let me know if it&#39;s better this week or not I never noticed a difference but you know I pay attention to all your comments ladies and gentlemen uh if you build it will they come AI versus the late 1990s clc&#39;s which were the competitive local exchange carriers um the whole thesis was if you build it they will come meaning invest all the money till the cows come home and hope for a return down the road sounds very familiar to Ai and they kind of did an overlay of what happened with that thesis and who was The Biggest Loser one of the biggest losers during that period was the company maybe you&#39;ve heard of it was called Nvidia this is what their chart looks like as well right\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ntill the cows come home and hope for a return down the road sounds very familiar to Ai and they kind of did an overlay of what happened with that thesis and who was The Biggest Loser one of the biggest losers during that period was the company maybe you've heard of it was called Nvidia this is what their chart looks like as well right here is the index they're overlaying the semis index over these uh clecs I'm not an enormous fan of these uh analoges but I do pay attention to them\n\nhere is the index they're overlaying the semis index over these uh clecs I'm not an enormous fan of these uh analoges but I do pay attention to them moving along\n\nhere&#39;s the antithesis so they&#39;re making the case why this time is different which is a dangerous case to make which is better returns for semis versus CC&#39;s so CC&#39;s were just investing at a loss because they could get unlimited free money during the uh uh late 90s today the semis are actually generating a return on invested Capital lower leverage risk for semis versus clecs CC&#39;s were 10 times as expensive as today&#39;s semis clecs burn cash semis generate cash so uh again that&#39;s why we&#39;re of the view that we&#39;re not going to see a tech wreck we&#39;re going to see a tech sideways consolidation to absorb the gains of you know paying for what is going to happen happen five seven nine years out today um you&#39;ve already paid for it so now you got to absorb it to get a little closer to the event ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninvestors eager for a pickup in China growth which of the following developments would you see as the most bullish for 2025 China growth accelerates opinion follows Trend gear to- dat performance in US dollar terms NASDAQ versus uh Hong Kong Shing high and you can just see the dramatic outperformance again on no one&#39;s bingo card at the end of last year on everyone&#39;s bingo card who are loyal listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes global data center power used by application so AI workloads are growing traditional workloads are also growing that is great for natural gas which is why we own Comstock resources side by side at nearly the same basis as Jerry Jones the guy who made his fortune in EN oil and gas and parlayed it into a a dynasty in the Dallas Cowboys which despite their performance is one of the most highly valued franchises in football history domestic investment is picking up after 10 years of uninvested so this is a positive trend for the companies that we look at productivity grew at an annualized pace of 2.8% during the tech boom versus 1.6% in the two decades after this is beginning to pick back up ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nlabor productivity you can see here we&#39;ve been consolidating for 18 years we&#39;re now breaking out and we&#39;re going to start to see massive productivity like we saw in the late 90s and in the early 2000s uh consumer sentiment has been weak on fear of tariffs and inflation and kind of the uncertainty of new volatility every day with a new announcement uh welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1 .0 new day new policy new tweet new volatility get over it if you don&#39;t know what you signed up for that&#39;s what that&#39;s what we got and I think that uh you got to break a few eggs to get an omelet so that&#39;s we&#39;re in the egg breaking process and I think we&#39;re going to get some beautiful big beautiful omelets come out of this uh University of Michigan inflation expectations through the roof y tariffs uh University of Michigan 5 to 10 year inflation expectations same thing tariffs if you look at the data you get the short-term bump intermediate term to long-term prices are actually lower because growth growth tends to slow as well that&#39;s also deflationary S&amp;P Global us manufacturing PMI actually turned up Dallas was uh terrible uh but Philadelphia was good so you&#39;re seeing mix but generally moving in the right direction mortgage rates are coming down now below 7% That&#39;s positive Stanley gen Etc City economic surprise index turning down so we got to keep an eye on this you did see a little bit of that in late 2023 when everyone was calling for a recession that never came so um be mindful but don&#39;t be paralized by it is is what I would say dollar rolling over part of our core thesis yields going down part of our core thesis um non-commercial selling in the hole which is why we&#39;re starting to get get more and more interested in oil and oil related stuff again here&#39;s the seasonal comp composite taken uh not back to 1929 but back to 1994 and here we are in February late February early March things pick up back up I think that is a good model to keep in mind so be ready in the first uh couple of weeks of March for things to look a lot better Doge effect Federal redundancies are uh are rising uh so you know this is a lot of layup we haven&#39;t seen that since 2022 e-commerce retail sales as a percentage of total sales hit a record high now almost 16 a half% that&#39;s bigger than during covid when everyone was locked down so that&#39;s a positive thing for things like Etsy uh and others like Baba uh biggest inflow to Europe in three years opinion follows Trend Japan CPI turning up which means what they have to continue to raise rate which means what the free money of the carry trade is over which means what force selling in mag 7 and passive indices that are overweight mag 7 Japan CPI there we go core inflation hits 19-month high in Japan keeping alive boj rate hike bets Alibaba straight up Alibaba daily return straight up hang sang relative to hangsang Tech dramatically outperform and that&#39;s what we had said uh probably a year ago on the podcast we said that uh when you know the hangsang doubles the key stocks will be up triple you know or quadruple and by the key stocks we mean the alibas etc etc and that&#39;s just begun short interest is still record high in China which means there&#39;s going to be a lot of forced buyers in coming months these these were core part of the thesis as we were laying it out when everyone was uh very negative on China and dollar rolling over I&#39;m sorry the um yuan is strengthening relative to the dollar which no one thought would happen and guess what China bond yields are going up two things that you see every cycle when Chinese equities take off here&#39;s India people couldn&#39;t get enough in 2024 at the peak uh now it&#39;s rolling over everyone&#39;s selling in the hole if you remember all the Articles record options record call options in India&#39;s history it was unbelievable they were like doing more options than the United States and they&#39;re like so so much smaller you know economy and markets by capitalization and those are all this hell taale signs and people this chart is actually let um um accelerated into it broke through on the downside if you remember we covered this last week it&#39;s actually broke below this so it&#39;s a whatever they call it a bearish pennant so keep an eye on that uh Insider transactions is actually at a level that&#39;s contrarian bullish we&#39;re actually

everyone&#39;s like no way man it&#39;s going to be mag seven I said no way man you got you know Watch What Happens and sure enough price followed the earnings growth and and we&#39;re off these earnings are decelerating these earnings went from Flat to 20% and surprise surprise the price followed uh CBO skew index sores uh you have to pay attention to this we&#39;ve covered skewed many times on this um but you know you buy protection before a fire not not in the middle of a fire and uh I I think we&#39;ve done a lot of damage under the surface a lot of these momentum crowded trade shiny

the mag s from Mike zardi you can see this pennant actually broke down below the uh volume by price as well which implies it could see some more pain for those overweight stocks and which you know wouldn&#39;t be surprising but um we&#39;re not stepping in that&#39;s not our game we&#39;ve got what we love and uh and they&#39;re doing well I mean I can&#39;t tell you the amount of days that the

think we're going to see continued out performance this is not good if you're overweight in passive indices that are weighted to the um mag 7 or in the mag 7 names themselves this is not a positive

here&#39;s a reverse Head and Shoulders bottom which implies a massive rally like we saw in 2018 here&#39;s bearish sentiment uh this is the a aii percentage of bears we have only seen this two other times since 1986 both were at or near major three times major bottoms you saw this level of pessimism in the covid lows you saw this level of pessimism during the great financial crisis lows and you saw this level of pessimism during the early 90s recession which was caused by a banking crisis and if you remember the Orange County real estate crisis when the Japanese money all pulled out I will be interested to see what happens with Orange County real estate uh in the next few years as Chinese money stops flowing out of China and stays in China due to fear of loss as everything else starts to go back up in China uh and you see more and more price Cuts in Orange County could be very very interesting and what else do you have here vix we covered Richmond manufacturing was good somu at the state level we got to keep our eye on here possible signal of recessions uh this is probably somewhat skewed by Washington DC so we&#39;ll keep an eye on it cover 10 your buying years Bitcoin has also gotten shacked down to 85,000 uh that kind of qualifies in the speculative uh bucket that we talk about a lot so that&#39;s getting hurt um here&#39;s the bull bear spread again you saw this level of pessimism at the 2022 lows if you remember that&#39;s when we were buying uh Amazon and Google deep in the hole when no one wanted it quick doubles within it was like a year uh so I think there&#39;s going to be really incredible opportunities in the next few weeks to be able to benefit as well this is UN believable pessimism coming out uh TLT bonds starting to dramatically outperform S&amp;P 500 in line with our uh themes for the year that you all know uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really exciting when you see all the pieces coming together as we had said uh in some of the foggy times I said hang in there when it comes it comes all at once and we are seeing that in Spades\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\npotential 1.5 trillion savings over 30 years from G p 1es i mean you speak about productivity

are going to get fit and healthy and it&#39;s going to save trillions of dollars of health care costs if this continues at the same pace which is pretty exciting uh fewer jobs expected in the next six months so a lot of pessimism and uncertainty that&#39;s normal Trump 1.0 uh manifesting in Trump 2.0 and the outcomes of 1.0 were very very good for the average worker uh minorities workingclass people did really well real wages did great uh conference board CEO confidence ticking up again this is what you saw in 2001 it&#39;s what you saw coming out of the great financial crisis off a very low basis this is actually very positive uh if I didn&#39;t mention yields going down let me just mention it one more time uh mortgage rates going down that&#39;s good China to start bank recapitalizations with at least $55 billion M2 money supply in China turning up this is a big precursor to massive expansion [Music] um Magnificent Seven slides into correction territory the basket is down well over 10% now Tesla is down from almost $480 down to 300 so it took its post-election rally back uh at least 60% of it back and uh we&#39;ll see how that plays out growth versus value growth is getting shellacked I think this trend is going to persist value is going to be performing lots of money going to be made in value the right value not not value traps but um companies with growth with cash flow growing turning around that type of stuff US stocks are now lagging the rest of the world uh here&#39;s the news cor story count for firings job cuts and layoffs I haven&#39;t seen this record since late 2022 that was a massive buying opportunity uh analysts are raising European earnings estimates Microsoft data center leases are slowing analysts say raising investor attention about demand for nvidia&#39;s products is basically what it comes down to um again after the aii bull bear belows Falls below -4 where it is right now one week later the Market&#39;s down on average 1% two weeks later it&#39;s up 14 basis points a month later it&#39;s up 2% two months later on average it&#39;s up almost 5% 3 months later 6% 6 months later 13.7 9 months later it&#39;s up 19% and one year later it&#39;s up 22% so this level of pessimism May in fact prove to be a very positive thing once the Bottom&#39;s in cycle composite this is where we are right now expect more rocking into early February and then straight up from there so a lot of things pointing to the same outcome most stocks are trading this from Seth uh golden most stocks are trading at their lowest correlation to the

added $618 million to alibaba&#39;s bottle bottom line and what else did you want possible yeah Trump&#39;s talking about having good relationship with Z though I I think you may have noted this week in that live press conference trying to see see the line that I wanted uh boosting cons quote unquote Premier Lee presided over a state council meeting the key point from the statement below is that it gives an indication of policies coming out of the Dual sessions in early March pay attention to this guys in poker this is called AEL this statement has the potential to have significant implications I didn&#39;t know you&#39;re a poker player Brendon we got to sit down and play uh quote boosting consumption is an important starting point for expanding domestic demand and stabilizing growth but also a major measure to change the medium and long-term development mode we should put consumption in a more prominent position and rely more on boosting consumption and to expand domestic demands smooth the economic cycle and stimulate economic growth we should make every effort to enhance consumption capacity adopt more effective consumption Pol promotion policies break the barriers and constraints restricting consumption and make every effort to optimize the consumption environment and to strive to open the chain of consumption driving investment industrial upgrading employment and income increase look the number one toll taker for consumption in China is Ali Baba okay they are the largest online retailer with tbal t-all uh if this is the direction the government wants to go no one is going to be a bigger B beneficiary than Alibaba so the game is just beginning uh Ryan Cohen boost his Alibaba stake to $1 billion paler insiders keep selling shares after4 billion winfall in 2024 so just like Jensen Wong filing to sell a billion dollars in June when we put out our article basically which marked the top in the price uh had negative returns for their subsequent six months uh filed to sell 1.2 billion Alex karp is doing the exact same thing the palent tyrians Can&#39;t Get Enough stock and you know what he&#39;s going to help them out and dump billions of dollars of shares on their head as they all chase the shiny object and ignore what&#39;s going on Mara Lago Accord chatter is getting wall Street&#39;s attention this is a big deal so two things that they want to have happen it&#39;s going to mimic what happened with the plaza Accord in 1985 it will be called the mara Lago Accord uh of course it will be a big beautiful deal uh the dollar will weaken which helps what which helps our emerging markets in China trade uh and it will uh there two aspects number one weakening the dollar and number two they&#39;re floating uh swapping some of their treasuries into hundred-year non-tradable zeroc coupon bonds if these nations needed cash quickly a Federal Reserve could make it temporarily available to them through a lending facility uh basically swapping it out for paper which would uh eliminate the carry or the negative carry on paying out the interest payments uh and lower the debt to GDP because the zero coupon trades at a huge discount I mean if they could pull it off what we&#39;d have to give an exchange for them to to take the swap uh would be very interesting but some institutions will want it so they can hold the marks on their books as at at par um if they actually pull this off this will be the greatest trade of all time uh in terms of I mean trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars saved for the us so that said the other thing that they announced is selling the golden visas for five million a pop and they could raise uh a quick um trillion or two trillion dollars I&#39;ll tell you if they want to raise the quick trillion to2 trillion doll what they need to do is put an expiration date on it and say we&#39;ll sell these bees for $5 million a pop for the first 12 months after 12 months either a it&#39;s going to be discontinued if we&#39;re over subscribed or B it&#39;s going to be up to $10 million from that point forward so get all these $5 million in I mean they could get a million two a trillion two trillion bucks into the treasury super quickly and that would be something again that was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of this year so pretty exciting stuff all right let&#39;s keep moving got to move this button here okay best and republicans in Congress Kickstart tax cut talks I mean these guys must be working literally 24 hours a day the amount of things that they have going so some deflationary with Doge which is a good thing some unbelievable restructurings with the logo Accord then tax cuts on top of it then tariffs on top of I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable what&#39;s happening hard to keep up which is why this call is so long this week but you got to know what&#39;s going on because uh in uncertainty is massive opportunity and by staying on top of all of this that&#39;s how we benefit from it and how we find these windows of generational opportunity consistently and we&#39;re doing the exact same thing right now uh and many of you are as well based

rattled the healthcare sector with 62 Healthcare components of the S&P down an average of 19% from previous highs this was the last chap latest chapter in healthc Care&#39;s ongoing struggles marked by its worth worst period of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 since at least 1991 and its lowest overall weight in the index around 10% in over 25 years however over roughly the same period total us care healthc care spending more than tripled rising from 1.4 trillion in 2000 to 5 trillion in 2024 uh you could see the underperformance when we were on at the end of the year what made us even more Curious was that despite the weakness the sector was and remains projected to achieve the second highest earnings growth in 2025 expecting a 19% increase compared to the S&P 12.7 same thing we talked about with materials uh remember in the short term the mark Market is a voting machine based on emotions in the long term it is a weighing machine driven by fundamentals so two months into the year how are things playing out so far healthc care is the number one performing sector technology negative uh consumer discretionary negative healthc care up 7.3 materials up 5.3 S&P up 1.73 Healthcare is the top performing sector uh outperforming the SNP by 4.2 times looks like the rumors of its death were indeed greatly exaggerated the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated that brings us to this week&#39;s first Focus B Baxter International for those who have been with us for a while you know Baxter represents a large portion of our health care exposure and as you can see this thing has done the same thing over and over uh for 40 plus years and they&#39;ve been around a lot longer than that this is just the price chart gets oversold every cycle they work through the inventory they recover because they have durable moat in their products uh as you can see the price fell for a reason cash flow fell they overstocked they did a dumb deal with h hillrom they then sold off um sold off some of their drug business raised a ton of cash paid down debt now the cash flow is going to start to hum again get back to growth and we are off to the races um excuse me sold off the kidney business I&#39;m sorry I got confused with uh uh sold up the kidney kidney business which was the lowest growing business in The Firm which put pressure on the multiple now that that slowest growing division is gone and they&#39;ve used the cash to pay down debt earnings are going to increase and then you&#39;re going to get a multiple reating from low double digits to probably closer to 20 and then you&#39;re going to get the growth back and this thing is going to be a double and more over time uh and we&#39;re pretty excited about so you should go through all these points that he underlined and starred as we do every week uh with different companies and see why we&#39;re confident in our position and uh and and we like this moving forward so they divested the lowest margin slowest growing business which was the Kidney Care business and got good money for it you can see the PE is depressed because of that it&#39;s going to expand back to I mean this is traded you

recovery of China&#39;s middle class the number one cheapest Global AI playing essentially a China AI ETF Alibaba then went on to report blowout quarter last week and now it&#39;s all anyone wants to talk about if you wondering what we mean when we say opinion follows Trend look no further than the upgrades below the stock was hated in the 60s 70s and 80s but now at 140 investors can&#39;t get enough uh Morgan Stanley overweight moved their price Target from 100 to 180 up 80% Benchmark moved it from 118 to 190 Bernstein moved it from 104 to 165 Barkley&#39;s moved it from 130 to 180 JP Morgan moved it from 125 to 170 si uh I guess that&#39;s susuan moved it from 130 to 175 uh no more BR moved it from 130 to 172 Bank of America from 117 to 150 Dan hives went on CNBC calling Alibaba the best AI play in China and presenting his base case of a valuation of $500 billion market cap base case $200 and10 $210 per share we agree not only our sside analyst turning bullish but Mainland investors via the southbound stock connect program continue to Pile in the total ownership of Mainland investors now sits at 6% of the float which we believe to still be in the early Innings analyst had initially projected $20 billion of inflows before the parabolic move and with peers like 10 cent and bil B having 10 and 15% respectively of their float held through the program these inflows still have legs and massive legs thereafter here a couple quotes from Brandon showing that that data and uh here&#39;s a breakdown of the report as you can see price followed cash flow cash flow is now even going up and we were always confident in this because we had the runway they had $80 billion of gross $60 billion in net cash they bought back a ton of stock uh at the lows unlike most American CEOs which buy at the highs so they can dump out their own shares in China they buy at the lows which is actually the right thing to do um and uh and now cash flow is recovering on top of it and the game is on so you can see all the data here go through sector by sector growth between the international knocking the cover off the ball tbow and te- all monster business now growing again um uh t-all grew 9% tound t-all group grew 9% this is a huge business uh Cloud Revenue reignited double digits at 13% AI as we said triple digit growth for the six consecutive quarter so go through all these and go carefully through the conference call and the areas that we&#39;ve highlighted and you will see why we are so excited and just getting started and um long way to go here Etsy he did an update all you need to know is this thing is a cash machine so you&#39;re generating the same amount of cash as you were when it was a $300 stock they just hit record revenues and you can&#39;t give away the stock so this is going to be another Alibaba everyone&#39;s going to be selling in the hole and then when it gets up to 100 120 everyone&#39;s going to be interested and that&#39;s just the way it goes they&#39;re going to turn the corner this thing is absolutely fine and they&#39;ve got everything they need strong balance sheet lots of cash pretty good leadership uh and a niche market so you can go through our our uh stuff there Canada Goose cash flow exploding again a lot of collabs had a cold winter everything&#39;s back on track with that uh pessimism fear and greed down at 22

Robert Holly understand your Advanced Auto Parts projects 7% operating margin looks like their average operating margin is around 10.5 given they expect to do below average historic operating margin 2027 is pred to assume they do below historic uh average net income margin 3% which would give them EPS around five4 or5 a share for 2027 uh okay so 7 n times do you expect a profit margin greater than three I think you&#39;re going to see a lot of synergies and I do think you&#39;re GNA I think they&#39;re sandbagging this in the short term I do think you&#39;re going to see higher margins than that I do think you&#39;re going to see a hockey stick inflection of revenues that they&#39;re not even anticipating and then the synergies of the Hub and spoke as they get a concentrated

with my eyes closed uh my view is that it&#39;s at least a double from recent levels and I think it&#39;s going to be a lot more as um Shane o Kelly uh just straightens it out we&#39;ve kind of done all the clean up now so we&#39;re basically cleared out the mest D stocked got the synergies going and now I think we&#39;re going to move into growth and don&#39;t forget they are expanding stores

this is this is just what happens it has these cyclical bottoms every handful of years they come in and they fix it this will be no different and now they&#39;ve got a better leader than they&#39;ve ever had in history so if this was you know a double I think happens with the eyes closed I think this could be a lot more than that if he can execute 50% on what he&#39;s saying I think they&#39;re going to catch a lot of Tailwinds that they&#39;re not expecting they&#39;re making projections on the basis of a very pessimistic Outlook right now and I think as things get better those estimates

Theo Dumont uh well done on Rolls-Royce again great turnaround call from turnaround Tom on Etsy I see the value play however it is not fully clear to me how they&#39;ll be able to protect against larger more Amazon already tried to knock them off and they shut the business down so if you research the company you&#39;ll find that uh Amazon did try to take take their um take their business and they realized that they couldn&#39;t compete against them in their niche market and that was the end of that so that&#39;s not a reason to be pessimistic Dustin D what are your thoughts on the recent memo Trump suggesting he could prevent investment in Chinese AI companies do you worry about Alibaba being D listed or potentially becoming completely restricted investment like Russian adrs uh China&#39;s too big of an economy for him to do that but yes I worry about everything all day long that&#39;s what my clients pay me to do is worry non-stop so they can just make money and go out and golf and go to the beach and enjoy life because they deserve it because they built incredible businesses or real estate investment portfolios or whatever they did they pay me to stay up and worry about it and that&#39;s why like if I had my brothers Alibaba would be 100% of the portfolio I would never do that because we have I we have position limits and we maxed out our position limit which is much lower than 100% that&#39;s why we own 8 10 12 companies why because there can always be something that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know but our two filter criteria is number one if anyone positioned in the portfolio went to zero would they take us out on a stretcher the answer is no and number two is would the remaining positions 9 10 position be enough to still outperform and reach our IR hurdle and the answer is yes so yeah that&#39;s always a risk and that&#39;s why it was trading at such a discount you don&#39;t know anything that anyone else isn&#39;t thinking about the key is is the dynamic has changed it&#39;s gone from an Administration that uh uh was everything about China is wrong let&#39;s not communicate to Let&#39;s Make a Deal pay me I mean that&#39;s all Trump wants pay me pay do a deal for the US consumers where we&#39;re either getting tariffs or we&#39;re getting advantages that we didn&#39;t have and if you help us make money uh the door is open and if you screw with us then we will take you down and the the direction it&#39;s going is let&#39;s make money together and that&#39;s what you saw so um I think that could could be a negotiating chip but I think that&#39;s in the rearview mirror people have been worried about adrs since net e in 2000 every two years when the Market&#39;s down people worry about delisting when the Market&#39;s up no one cares and it just keeps happening over and over and over so maybe one day that will change but that&#39;s how you manage your risk you can never be 100% certain about anything but you play your odds when you&#39;re buying tremendous amount of value for low amount of price uh good things happen over time when they&#39;re good assets and that&#39;s what we continue to do and why we do it in more than one company is because uh anything is possible and um and that&#39;s how you hedge against it by sizing Simon staz staz thoughts on Western Union uh we covered that not not a not a business we&#39;re interested in numbers look good it&#39;s just not a business we want to be involved in it probably works as a trade but maybe you get a double if everything goes perfect but

best I want best Daniel Borman uh you mentioned eel various times uh okay so he&#39;s asking about the PE that is the exact wrong question and a lot of people get faked out by this is what you have to look at is normalized earnings when a stock is down 50 or 60 or 70% it&#39;s obvious that earnings are either negative look what&#39;s your PE multiple if the company earns one Cent your PE multiple could be a million okay and the problem is is when you look at the turnaround and you look at what normalized earnings is I.E you know what were earnings last 10 years and what&#39;s the growth rate and and uh take out the aberration and see what it looks like three to five years out uh then the multiple starts to look like six times seven times eight times nine times and then you&#39;re getting a bargain so then you just have to be damn sure number one balance sheet is good number two there&#39;s still cash flow or strong balance sheet to Give Them Enough Runway to execute the turnaround plan to get back to normalized earnings or sometimes greater than normalized earnings then get the multiple reating then get your double or triple and then uh go play 18 holes Jack Z Tom was wondering

then buy up their assets for pennies on the dollar and that&#39;s why you see even before Eves existed every five years the stock crashes 60% 70% and then it doubles and triples over the next few years oh over and over and over and that&#39;s with EVS without EVS whatever the same thing&#39;s going to happen now the difference is they have better liquidity they&#39;re in a stronger position

don&#39;t care I know what the assets are they&#39;re reporting in March and it probably means they&#39;ve got some more stuff to say which is good news not bad news uh so uh perfectly fine with that uh Stephen Frampton asks West Shore pharmaceutical wst uh yeah so I don&#39;t like to make bets on so it&#39;s in pharmaceutical packaging and delivering systems Delivery Systems let&#39;s take a closer look all right so cash flow has followed price and revenues uh so you just have to be damn sure what is the Catalyst for this to turn around um and the answer is uh that&#39;s that&#39;s work to be done but for me revenues are declining cash flows are declining gross margins are declining um uh and it hasn&#39;t come down that much I mean it&#39;s down let me just see here so when I get involved in a stock I I have to have at least at least a double or triple in a few years and this is like if everything goes right I mean maybe I would get a double and and I think it&#39;s just starting to break down this is going to take a half a year to probably build a base uh so no too too early but probably right idea you&#39;re just too early and the price is too high uh do send it back when it&#39;s in the hundreds uh probably like 175 1 15 and we&#39;ll take another look and see what it looks like but on the right track just a little early buddy John Phillips qxo trading at blah blah blah five billion cash buying cash at a discount no because there&#39;s a burn and your numbers are wrong Nick Davis uh thoughts on Parson&#39;s Corp always double check your numbers with the source materials the public filings don&#39;t just trust some secondhand uh Parson this is a broken momentum stock it is not going to bottom anytime soon in my opinion I don&#39;t even need to look at the financials uh Matt tumba luck and coffee this was a accounting fraud so even if that went through bankruptcy um I just never trust those companies after that so I&#39;m going to just leave it at that it might work but um I don&#39;t take company and Country risk and that has both so Douglas Grant thank you for all that you do I listen to your show religiously every week you mention that you do not like really like recreational vehicle business I I like recreational vehicles I just don&#39;t like the businesses um Harley-Davidson no no uh not a good business never been a good business might be a trading vehicle let&#39;s just see here I mean the stock has done nothing in 30 years why would anything change I mean this is like you can&#39;t make this up so hard pass uh as a trade you could probably trade it up to 40 but who knows uh Gasper could you take a look at BASF and Dow Dow we&#39;ve already covered we generally like chemicals here um I this I&#39;m going to pass on that one BASF there are other better chemical plays which we&#39;ve covered in recent weeks go back to the amas uh BASF let&#39;s take a look I don&#39;t think there enough upside in this one even if you get a recovery but I&#39;ll just do a quick uh hold on now I I mean just show me how this is turning around I mean these revenues have collapsed the price stock is BAS stock price is basically the same I don&#39;t like that uh lee Foster AMA question for the Oracle of the OC that&#39;s hysterical okay would you check out the stock gaming Realms gml UK based gaming company Mobile gaming gaming software I I hate that business because it&#39;s a hits business and I can&#39;t predict the hits but I&#39;ll take a quick look at it um gaming Realms yeah I mean cash flows are rising revenues are rising but prices rised as well so um gmr DOL all right well you can see the chart here I mean I mean just tell me that they&#39;re going to keep hitting on all cylinders and I&#39;ll tell you to buy the stock I mean this thing looks like it&#39;s up a lot in anticipation of what what has happened the question is whether they can keep keep it happening and I can never guess on those businesses so I just stay away it&#39;s like you know betting on a speculative tech tech company are they going to get the next hit V vasari Helios Towers cell phone tower re in Emerging Markets htws so they&#39;ve been negative cash flow it looks like they&#39;re starting to recover uh this is too early for me and by the time I&#39;m ready it&#39;s probably going to be pricing it in I don&#39;t like this negative cash flow story uh yeah this looks a little bit like a I&#39;m I&#39;m going to pass I think you&#39;re right from an objective point of view but I think there&#39;s too many risks uh Travis monk okay so his question is why are there changes so late like gifting and all the things that they&#39;re doing to turn around the company is because they caught lightning in a bottle and they caught everyone at home who wanted to produce stuff when they were doing nothing and wanted to buy stuff when they were doing nothing and everyone got free money and the fact that they&#39;ve been able to grow cash flow back to those levels of once in a 100y year opportunities for that type of business is a miracle so now they&#39;ve got to catch up and innovate uh consistent with everything they&#39;ve been able to do and that answers your question could they could they have done better yes but if they had done better would we have had the opportunity to buy the stock down Etsy I mean we bought this thing down 85% so and cash flow is now exceeding the levels it was when it was a $300 stock so there&#39;s not a whole lot to think about here I mean basically the revenues could drop 20 something percent uh cash flow could drop meaningfully more and this would still be a cheap stock and instead they&#39;re actually doing all this stuff to re accelerate growth and they are in two out of three of their platforms and hit record revenues so uh my margin of safety is intact here they they&#39;ve already priced in worse things happening uh than than have much worse things happened that have happened and they&#39;ve given zero credit for the good things that are happening and those are the type of opportunities we like with asymmetry Michael oar your hi Tom your podcast have helped me understand the behavior of the stock market more than you can imagine question uh how do you reach a value for a brand premium over intrinsic value I give zero credit for the brand premium I look at the performance of the business and that tells me how valuable the brand is and whether they have a mode or not because I can see what type of returns uninvested capital and if they get above market returns on invested Capital that means they have above market value to their brand modee so I don&#39;t need to guess what it&#39;s worth I just need to look at what&#39;s the price and what do I get and if there&#39;s a Divergence between the intrinsic value I get and the price that I pay I&#39;m down and we make it a position and uh and we do right the turnaround they don&#39;t call me turnaround Tom for nothing uh Danny Chan okay for an internship Danny I did uh respond to your email I don&#39;t know if you got it so just double check Maybe went to spam uh want to get your opinion on chewy Pet Food business is a chronic loser but I think this one&#39;s going to work you know it&#39;s it&#39;s always the same story and it&#39;s already rebounded so like if you get a pullback to 30 or 25 I think this one&#39;s interesting um but I couldn&#39;t get enough conviction to buy it in client accounts because it&#39;s just not a sleep at night thing this is more speculative um and I was a little worried about self-dealing with the ownership Etc but uh I like it I mean I like it on a objective numbers basis I&#39;m I&#39;m cautious on the business it is just like recreational vehicles businesses I like the business I I like the objective numbers but I just know there&#39;s cyclical businesses that always fail um so kind of like miners so I get the theme everyone loves their I mean here in Orange County by the beach everyone&#39;s pushing strollers it&#39;s like wow everyone&#39;s having babies and then you look under the thing they&#39;re literally pushing their dogs in a stroller you can&#39;t make this stuff up I mean like it&#39;s unreal so um it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable I think you&#39;re right I think this thing has run up 3x already so you missed it and you know if it gets back into the mid-20s and the fundamentals continue to look good then revisit it but you&#39;re laid on this one and your thinking on it is correct and that&#39;s it we&#39;re done for today we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwant to get your opinion on chewy Pet Food business is a chronic loser

be below 50% still sounds good but when you&#39;re trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings sometimes you need to take a break and that&#39;s why Nvidia stock price has had negative returns since June so you would not be Buy buying Nvidia at 127 this morning because you think there&#39;s a good shot that it goes lower after tomorrow&#39;s earnings call correct correct what about Microsoft they&#39;re back to $400 even well what about them look magnificent 7 we&#39;ve been warning on your show for a couple of months to trim back magnificent 7 not because they&#39;re not great companies it&#39;s just prices what you pay values what you get and what you have seen year to date is the Magnificent 7 is down 1 and a half% year-to date why because their earnings growth again is decelerating from 33% last year to now it&#39;s expected to just be 16% this year because of all the capex because of all the spend without a clear near term return and you know the market likes near-term returns too uh so that&#39;s why and the multiples are still high even though the earnings growth is coming down people are getting wise to that and they are putting their money El elsewhere

down our health care thesis listening here at the time the anticipated appointment of RFK Jr had rattled the healthcare sector with 62 Healthcare components of the S&P down an average of 19% from previous highs this was the last chap latest chapter in healthc Care&#39;s ongoing struggles marked by its worth worst period of underperformance relative to the S&P 500 since at least 1991 and its lowest overall weight in the index around 10% in over 25 years however over roughly the same period total us care healthc care spending more than tripled rising from 1.4 trillion in 2000 to 5 trillion in 2024 uh you could see the underperformance when we were on at the end of the year what made us even more Curious was that despite the weakness the sector was and remains projected to achieve the second highest earnings growth in 2025 expecting a 19% increase compared to the S&P 12.7 same thing we talked about with materials uh remember in the short term the mark Market is a voting machine based on emotions in the long term it is a weighing machine driven by fundamentals so two months into the year how are things playing out so far healthc care is the number one performing sector technology negative uh consumer discretionary negative healthc care up 7.3 materials up 5.3 S&P up 1.73 Healthcare is the top performing sector uh outperforming the SNP by 4.2 times looks like the rumors of its death were indeed greatly exaggerated the reports of my death are greatly exaggerated that brings us to this week&#39;s first Focus B Baxter International for those who have been with us for a while you know Baxter represents a large portion of our health care exposure and as you can see this thing has done the same thing over and over uh for 40 plus years and they&#39;ve been around a lot longer than that this is just the price chart gets oversold every cycle they work through the inventory they recover because they have durable moat in their products uh as you can see the price fell for a reason cash flow fell they overstocked they did a dumb deal with h hillrom they then sold off um sold off some of their drug business raised a ton of cash paid down debt now the cash flow is going to start to hum again get back to growth and we are off to the races um excuse me sold off the kidney business I&#39;m sorry I got confused with uh uh sold up the kidney kidney business which was the lowest growing business in The Firm which put pressure on the multiple now that that slowest growing division is gone and they&#39;ve used the cash to pay down debt earnings are going to increase and then you&#39;re going to get a multiple reating from low double digits to probably closer to 20 and then you&#39;re going to get the growth back and this thing is going to be a double and more over time uh and we&#39;re pretty excited about so you should go through all these points that he underlined and starred as we do every week uh with different companies and see why we&#39;re confident in our position and uh and and we like this moving forward so they divested the lowest margin slowest growing business which was the Kidney Care business and got good money for it you can

to start now so let&#39;s kick it off to the second half of an exciting week Robert Holly understand your Advanced Auto Parts projects 7% operating margin looks like their average operating margin is around 10.5 given they expect to do below average historic operating margin 2027 is pred to assume they do below historic uh average net income margin 3% which would give them EPS around five4 or5 a share for 2027 uh okay so 7 n times do you expect a profit margin greater than three I think you&#39;re going to see a lot of synergies and I do think you&#39;re GNA I think they&#39;re sandbagging this in the short term I do think you&#39;re going to see higher margins than that I do think you&#39;re going to see a hockey stick inflection of revenues that they&#39;re not even anticipating and then the synergies of the Hub and spoke as they get a concentrated foothold versus this disparate foothold on the west coast uh we like this story we agree with the bull thesis that we went through early earlier and uh we thank you for the question this for me uh with my eyes closed uh my view is that it&#39;s at least a double from recent levels and I think it&#39;s going to be a lot more as um Shane o Kelly uh just straightens it out we&#39;ve kind of done all the clean up now so we&#39;re basically cleared out the mest D stocked got the synergies going and now I think we&#39;re going to move into growth and don&#39;t forget they are expanding stores still in those areas and now the balance sheet you know you had when this stock dropped from you know $225 you know buying it in the 40s um you know it it looked like there was no end in sight this is this is this is just what happens it has these cyclical bottoms every handful of years they come in and they fix it this will be no different and now they&#39;ve got a better leader than they&#39;ve ever had in history so if this was you know a double I think happens with the eyes closed I think this could be a lot more than that if he can execute 50% on what he&#39;s saying I think they&#39;re going to catch a lot of Tailwinds that they&#39;re not expecting they&#39;re making projections on the basis of a very pessimistic Outlook right now and I think as things get better those estimates are going to go up just like with the analyst so uh we like this one and we love the fact that they&#39;ve deris the balance sheet uh massively from where when we initiated the position Steve Franks correct me if I&#39;m wrong the hell is this Advanced Auto Part same\n\nquestions  in twice ladies and gentlemen uh but thank you for sending the question Theo Dumont uh well done on Rolls-Royce again great turnaround call from turnaround Tom on Etsy I see the value play however it is not fully clear to me how they&#39;ll be able to protect against larger more Amazon already tried to knock them off and they shut the business down so if you research the company you&#39;ll find that uh Amazon did try to take take their um take their business and they realized that they couldn&#39;t compete against them in their niche market and that was the end of that so that&#39;s not a reason to be pessimistic Dustin D what are your thoughts on the recent memo Trump suggesting he could prevent investment in Chinese AI companies do you worry about Alibaba being D listed or potentially becoming completely restricted investment like Russian adrs uh China&#39;s too big of an economy for him to do that but yes I worry about everything all day long that&#39;s what my clients pay me to do is worry non-stop so they can just make money and go out and golf and go to the beach and enjoy life because they deserve it because they built incredible businesses or real estate investment portfolios or whatever they did they pay me to stay up and worry about it and that&#39;s why like if I had my brothers Alibaba would be 100% of the portfolio I would never do that because we have I we have position limits and we maxed out our position limit which is much lower than 100% that&#39;s why we own 8 10 12 companies why because there can always be something that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know but our two filter criteria is number one if anyone positioned in the portfolio went to zero would they take us out on a stretcher the answer is no and number two is would the remaining positions 9 10 position be enough to still outperform and reach our IR hurdle and the answer is yes so yeah that&#39;s always a risk and that&#39;s why it was trading at such a discount you don&#39;t know anything that anyone else isn&#39;t thinking about the key is is the dynamic has changed it&#39;s gone from an Administration that uh uh was everything about China is wrong let&#39;s not communicate to Let&#39;s Make a Deal pay me I mean that&#39;s all Trump wants pay me pay do a deal for the US consumers where we&#39;re either getting tariffs or we&#39;re getting advantages that we didn&#39;t have and if you help us make money uh the door is open and if you screw with us then we will take you down and the the direction it&#39;s going is let&#39;s make money together and that&#39;s what you saw so um I think that could could be a negotiating chip but I think that&#39;s in the rearview mirror people have been worried about adrs since net e in 2000 every two years when the Market&#39;s down people worry about delisting when the Market&#39;s up no one cares and it just keeps happening over and over and over so maybe one day that will change but that&#39;s how you manage your risk you can never be 100% certain about anything but you play your odds when you&#39;re buying tremendous amount of value for low amount of price uh good things happen over time when they&#39;re good assets and that&#39;s what we continue to do and why we do it in more than one company is because uh anything is possible and um and that&#39;s how you hedge against it by sizing Simon staz staz thoughts on Western Union uh we covered that not not a not a business we&#39;re interested in numbers look good it&#39;s just not a business we want to be involved in it probably works as a trade but maybe you get a double if everything goes perfect but more likely than not it&#39;s dead money and a value trap Ruben Fernandez uh thoughts on Honeywell Elliot involved with $5 billion stake he&#39;s involved in crown castle too what has that done nothing yet um all right so let&#39;s do this honey well I generally like but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s come down enough I covered this two weeks ago no I&#39;m not I&#39;m not a buyer here um

third best I want best Daniel Borman uh you mentioned eel various times uh okay so he&#39;s asking about the PE that is the exact wrong question and a lot of people get faked out by this is what you have to look at is normalized earnings when a stock is down 50 or 60 or 70% it&#39;s obvious that earnings are either negative look what&#39;s your PE multiple if the company earns one Cent your PE multiple could be a million okay and the problem is is when you look at the turnaround and you look at what normalized earnings is I.E you know what were earnings last 10 years and what&#39;s the growth rate and and uh take out the aberration and see what it looks like three to five years out uh then the multiple starts to look like six times seven times eight times nine times and then you&#39;re getting a bargain so then you just have to be damn sure number one balance sheet is good number two there&#39;s still cash flow or strong balance sheet to Give Them Enough Runway to execute the turnaround plan to get back to normalized earnings or sometimes greater than normalized earnings then get the multiple reating then get your double or triple and then uh go play 18 holes Jack Z

of business and then buy up their assets for pennies on the dollar and that&#39;s why you see even before Eves existed every five years the stock crashes 60% 70% and then it doubles and triples over the next few years oh over and over and over and that&#39;s with EVS without EVS whatever the same thing&#39;s going to happen now the difference is they have better liquidity they&#39;re in a

delaying reporting I don&#39;t care I know what the assets are they&#39;re reporting in March and it probably means they&#39;ve got some more stuff to say which is good news not bad news uh so uh perfectly fine with that uh Stephen Frampton asks West Shore pharmaceutical wst uh yeah so I don&#39;t like to make bets on so it&#39;s in pharmaceutical packaging and delivering systems Delivery Systems let&#39;s take a closer look all right so cash flow has followed price and revenues uh so you just have to be damn sure what is the Catalyst for this to turn around um and the answer is uh that&#39;s that&#39;s work to be done but for me revenues are declining cash flows are declining gross margins are declining um uh and it hasn&#39;t come down that much I mean it&#39;s down let me just see here so when I get involved in a stock I I have to have at least at least a double or triple in a few years and this is like if everything goes right I mean maybe I would get a double and and I think it&#39;s just starting to break down this is going to take a half a year to probably build a base uh so no too too early but probably right idea you&#39;re just too early and the price is too high uh do send it back when it&#39;s in the hundreds uh probably like 175 1 15 and we&#39;ll take another look and see what it looks like but on the right track just a little early buddy John Phillips qxo trading at blah blah blah five billion cash buying cash at a discount no because there&#39;s a burn and your numbers are wrong Nick Davis uh thoughts on Parson&#39;s Corp always double check your numbers with the source materials the public filings don&#39;t just trust some secondhand uh Parson this is a broken momentum stock it is not going to bottom anytime soon in my opinion I don&#39;t even need to look at the financials uh Matt tumba luck and coffee this was a accounting fraud so even if that went through bankruptcy um I just never trust those companies after that so I&#39;m going to just leave it at that it might work but um I don&#39;t take company and Country risk and that has both so Douglas Grant thank you for all that you do I listen to your show religiously every week you mention that you do not like really like recreational vehicle business I I like recreational vehicles I just don&#39;t like the businesses um Harley-Davidson no no uh not a good business never been a good business might be a trading vehicle let&#39;s just see here I mean the stock has done nothing in 30 years why would anything change I mean this is like you can&#39;t make this up so hard pass uh as a trade you could probably trade it up to 40 but who knows uh Gasper could you take a look at BASF and Dow Dow we&#39;ve already covered we generally like chemicals here um I this I&#39;m going to pass on that one BASF there are other better chemical plays which we&#39;ve covered in recent weeks go back to the amas uh BASF let&#39;s take a look I don&#39;t think there enough upside in this one even if you get a recovery but I&#39;ll just do a quick uh hold on now I I mean just show me how this is turning around I mean these revenues have collapsed the price stock is BAS stock price is basically the same I don&#39;t like that uh lee Foster AMA question for the Oracle of the OC that&#39;s hysterical okay would you check out the stock gaming Realms gml UK based gaming company Mobile gaming gaming software I I hate that business because it&#39;s a hits business and I can&#39;t predict the hits but I&#39;ll take a quick look at it um gaming Realms yeah I mean cash flows are rising revenues are rising but prices rised as well so um gmr DOL all right well you can see the chart here I mean I mean just tell me that they&#39;re going to keep hitting on all cylinders and I&#39;ll tell you to buy the stock I mean this thing looks like it&#39;s up a lot in anticipation of what what has happened the question is whether they can keep keep it happening and I can never guess on those businesses so I just stay away it&#39;s like you know betting on a speculative tech tech company are they going to get the next hit V vasari Helios Towers cell phone tower re in Emerging Markets htws so they&#39;ve been negative cash flow it looks like they&#39;re starting to recover uh this is too early for me and by the time I&#39;m ready it&#39;s probably going to be pricing it in I don&#39;t like this negative cash flow story uh yeah this looks a little bit like a I&#39;m I&#39;m going to pass I think you&#39;re right from an objective point of view but I think there&#39;s too many risks uh Travis monk okay so his question is why are there changes so late like gifting and all the things that they&#39;re doing to turn around the company is because they caught lightning in a bottle and they caught everyone at home who wanted to produce stuff when they were doing nothing and wanted to buy stuff when they were doing nothing and everyone got free money and the fact that they&#39;ve been able to grow cash flow back to those levels of once in a 100y year opportunities for that type of business is a miracle so now they&#39;ve got to catch up and innovate uh consistent with everything they&#39;ve been able to do and that answers your question could they could they have done better yes but if they had done better would we have had the opportunity to buy the stock down Etsy I mean we bought this thing down 85% so and cash flow is now exceeding the levels it was when it was a $300 stock so there&#39;s not a whole lot to think about here I mean basically the revenues could drop 20 something percent uh cash flow could drop meaningfully more and this would still be a cheap stock and instead they&#39;re actually doing all this stuff to re accelerate growth and they are in two out of three of their platforms and hit record revenues so uh my margin of safety is intact here they they&#39;ve already priced in worse things happening uh than than have much worse things happened that have happened and they&#39;ve given zero credit for the good things that are happening and those are the type of opportunities we like with asymmetry Michael oar your hi Tom your podcast have helped me understand the behavior of the stock market more than you can imagine question uh how do you reach a value for a brand premium over intrinsic value I give zero credit for the brand premium I look at the performance of the business and that tells me how valuable the brand is and whether they have a mode or not because I can see what type of returns uninvested capital and if they get above market returns on invested Capital that means they have above market value to their brand modee so I don&#39;t need to guess what it&#39;s worth I just need to look at what&#39;s the price and what do I get and if there&#39;s a Divergence between the intrinsic value I get and the price that I pay I&#39;m down and we make it a position and uh and we do right

that you&#39;re going to start to see some outperformance in international and what&#39;s going to surprise everyone as they took all the weightings down in China is it&#39;s going to be driven by China and uh all the hot money that ran into Japan and India to hide uh in the last few years is now going to come rushing out fomo they&#39;re all underperforming they have no exposure as matter of fact Brendan Ahern of kweb did a write up on that they&#39;re all screwed they missed this 80% move and now they&#39;re got to chase Pile in otherwise they&#39;re gonna you know any International active manager that&#39;s been hiding out in India and China is toast India is at 52 we lows uh Japan is is uh it&#39;s basically done and now uh China has uh left the gate and not let them in so they&#39;re going to have to panic Chase on any dip to buy and if you get a gift of Baba at 120 125 um you know and you don&#39;t have enough exposure that&#39;s going to be probably your last gift

by the way uh some of you were talking about the mic I bought a sh mic it&#39;s supposed to be the best one so in the comments Below on YouTube let me know if there&#39;s any Improvement this week I had the yeti which was fine for some reason it uh didn&#39;t people wanted to hear it better so I got the best mic let me know if it&#39;s better this week or not I never noticed a difference but you know I pay attention to all your comments ladies and gentlemen uh if you build it will they come AI versus the late 1990s clc&#39;s which were the competitive local exchange carriers um the whole thesis was if you build it they will come meaning invest all the money till the cows come home and hope for a return down the road sounds very familiar to Ai and they kind of did an overlay of what happened with that thesis and who was The Biggest Loser one of the biggest losers during that period was the company maybe you&#39;ve heard of it was called Nvidia this is what their chart looks like as well right\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ntill the cows come home and hope for a return down the road sounds very familiar to Ai and they kind of did an overlay of what happened with that thesis and who was The Biggest Loser one of the biggest losers during that period was the company maybe you've heard of it was called Nvidia this is what their chart looks like as well right here is the index they're overlaying the semis index over these uh clecs I'm not an enormous fan of these uh analoges but I do pay attention to them\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nrolling over uh discretionary looks like it could potentially be ready for a bounce in coming weeks Staples might be a little overdone in terms of the defensiveness expectations for cuts are now going up people are pricing in slower growth with the tariffs uh and yields are coming down fed Cuts expectations going up uh here are some of the the mag 7 this was a couple of days ago these have look these are looking a lot worse now most of them are down about 20% Tesla maybe a little more Nvidia got hit a lot harder today uh February is the worst month of the year in postelection year second half of February all these stuff that you were ready for now has played out uh not a lot of debt but delinquencies are rising from low levels so again these are historic low levels of debt so yes you will see delinquencies but it&#39;s off a very very multi-decade historic low base Debt Service much less of a burden now um a lot of a lot of debt was locked in at very low rates consumer confidence a little bit grinding sideways we saw that actually right before uh the first Trump Administration I think you&#39;re going to start to see a re acceleration just like you did in Trump 1.0 uh here&#39;s the breakdown of the mag s from Mike zardi you can see this pennant actually broke down below the uh volume by price as well which implies it could see some more pain for those overweight stocks and which you know wouldn&#39;t be surprising but um we&#39;re not stepping in that&#39;s not our game we&#39;ve got what we love and uh and they&#39;re doing well I mean I can&#39;t tell you the amount of days that the market was getting smashed in February that our that our p&amp;l was positive it&#39;s I&#39;ve never seen anything like it it was just unbelievable uh mag 7 expecting Superior earnings growth THS is 493 but it&#39;s cutting in it&#39;s decelerating that&#39;s the big deal unmagnify is accelerating that&#39;s why these are going to outperform and those are going to underperform uh\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  diversification is paying off what&#39;s the top performing Rel uh year-to-date Equity return versus the US China followed by Spain Italy Germany Switzerland France Mexico Nordic Netherland UK Emerging Markets uh and uh Japan is actually doing worse everyone couldn&#39;t get enough Japan last year and the year before value underperformed growth in the post great financial crisis decade but it has been more mixed since then it is bottoming just like it did in the early 2000s why this was an aberration called zerp zero interest rate policy it was the only decade in a 100 years where you if you could buy a basket of stocks trading at 10 times sales and now perform the S&amp;P 500 any other decade you did that you&#39;d lose 80 to 90% of your money within 48 months um this will not happen again unless you think rates are going back down to zero then uh I wouldn&#39;t be playing that bet the name of the game is value is outperformed growth by 4.4% S uh since 1927 which basically means if you&#39;d put a million dollars up at that period and invested in value over uh growth you&#39;d have an extra 68 million of gains and that includes this operational 15 15year period where underperformed because of unnatural uh manufactured conditions of zero interest rate policy fed funds Target rate covered that Texas was weaker Texas manufacturing but Philadelphia was better uh GDP so this is consensus is going up to 2.3 uh that&#39;s not the type of environment where you see a recession household consumption is expected to grow consumer discretionary got shellacked here in February uh there&#39;s going to be some opportunities in that Rubble\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ninterested and that&#39;s just the way it goes they&#39;re going to turn the corner this thing is absolutely fine and they&#39;ve got everything they need strong balance sheet lots of cash pretty good leadership uh and a niche market so you can go through our our uh stuff there Canada Goose cash flow exploding again a lot of collabs had a cold winter everything&#39;s back on track with that uh pessimism fear and greed down at 22 this is when you want to be a buyer not a seller be selective and so on so great article there Jeff helped put that uh all together in a very great way uh earnings top IDP IBD top 50 growth index top 30 weights in the last 60 days the earnings estimates have gone up by double digits uh 11% and up 8% so keep an eye on some of these names that have been battered basic materials uh have gone down they&#39;re still trading in the hole this is going to start to inflect so this is where the puck is going to be going on a selective basis pay attention to that uh Cooper standard is for the first time in in a long time seeing Insider buying uh this is John mastrocola he is a director went into the open markets and bought stock at $15 and 1526 and 1455 for $118,000 look it sounds like a rounding error of lunch money but for most of these directors uh it&#39;s not a that is a huge amount of money and um so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a serious token and then the C fo uh who I&#39;ve met with a super great guy went in the market and also bought stock at $15 uh he bought about $45,000 and if you look at his salary you will see that that is a meaningful amount of money so these guys are seeing what we see and it&#39;s a great vote of confidence and uh kudos to them and they&#39;re going to make a ton of money and they absolutely deserve to make a ton of money and we&#39;re super excited to be part of it um okay so here&#39;s some economic data we&#39;ve got kind of

these things hockey stick they're going to hockey stick overnight\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is the data that we referenced with Stu uh regarding Nvidia so so people are shocked why is NVIDIA down 8% da it's because their growth rate is decelerating and that's okay if you're trading at 10 times earnings it's not okay when you're trading at 30 times sales and 45 times earnings so basically they and by the way the one thing I didn't expect that happen is their gross margins are eroding as well uh other than that how was to play Mrs Lincoln so uh here's what you see in data center revenues they have uh grown $4 billion per quarter for basically the past year uh and that sounds great and it is great okay the problem is is the base keeps getting bigger and the growth rate is decelerating was 250% off a small base last year uh you know and down uh this this quarter was well below 100% and will be well below 50% before the end of the year on top of that now you have margin worries you have competition worries and because of deep seek their Edge called cuda which everyone thought was going to be the next apple Walled Garden has proven to be not the case so all they become is exactly what they've always been which is a commodity producer and it will be erased to the bottom with margins as more of these inferior chips can be utilized and as I love to say the

for us staple started to tick up all the defense have started to tick up keeping a close eye on the Japanese 10-year treasury jgb yield and this is basic basically axy for the carry trade on wine a lot of which free Capital found itself in the mag 7 as that money is no longer free in the Japanese carry trade as inflation picks up and if to raise rates money is coming out abruptly and there&#39;s a lot of force selling and that&#39;s going to continue and that will continue to pressure those stocks and those indices and the fortunes will be made under the Surface by those picking the stocks where price is what you pay value is what you get you&#39;re getting good multiples for good growth and that&#39;s why alibaba&#39;s up 80% uh that&#39;s why so many other value stocks we&#39;re starting to see take off here&#39;s again carry trade on wine what&#39;s what&#39;s happening it&#39;s moving right back down to those levels that we saw share of spending by income group uh top 10% of earners now account for half of spending you know this is this is not news it&#39;s certainly elevated a little bit but but um what you see is under Trump one is started to normalize and I think under Trump two it&#39;s going to normalize the lower strata did on a relative basis the Improvement for the lower strata under Trump one was orders of magnitude greater than it was for the higher strata and I think we&#39;re going to start to see that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in Washington DC so they are gutting uh the public sector uh that is deflationary apartment

to be more negative than most they're right around 2% Baker Hughes rig count going up I mean that makes sense why people are selling energy um they're aggressively short let maybe we can take a quick look at how short are commercials I did look at it and I think that they are pretty aggressive uh w\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  Energy natural gas there we go so what we look is at is the commitments of Traders positioning and we want to generally be on the opposite side of the large Traders and hedge funds and we want to be in line with the commercials when the commercials are buyers uh price tends to follow right now commercials are in fact buyers it doesn&#39;t always work but it works a lot of the time at inflection point so our inclination is to be more constructive on energy but we are in no rush to do it\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  from fund Strat so they had a similar chart with small caps showing this they&#39;re making the case that we&#39;ve had a lot of these 5 to s% pullbacks in momentum and then they bounce back it could be the case um so you know just be open-minded to that that would make sense if the indices are going to rebound a little bit in March uh but for the long-term gains you want to start to be moving away from the crowd and skating to where the puck is going to be not where it&#39;s already been in the rear view mirror\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nseasonality for the presidential cycle year one since 1929 February is the worst month March recovers April is awesome May is awesome June is a little weaker July is awesome fall gets weak and then you finish out okay so I think we're going to get a lot of gains in a short amount of time here into the summer and then we'll probably start to harvest some and uh look for more defensive opportunities as we get into this window uh and go from there here are the PE evaluations relative to history uh you're seeing some bargain levels in real estate uh what is this P oh absolute PE so energy is low and then relative PE here's where you F here's where you're overpaying is information technology consumer uh no consumer discretionary looks okay over the last 10 years uh Industrials I think that's probably skewed by a few companies like cat Etc uh but here's where you're finding more of the bargains Staples materials utilities real estate Health Care financials and energy this was the small cap chart I was telling you about uh we agree with this View you know but sometimes look it comes back up to this top it consolidates for a little while before it takes the next Double higher gets up to the top consolidates before doubling to the next level higher so this wouldn't surprise us at all um and this does look similar to that early 2000s period as well that we've been continually talking about uh bearish sentiment well we'll we'll see the more recent readings they got completely flushed out us share of global Equity market so they have 56% and and this is why we've been telling people to get some International us equities have 56% share of the market but we only have 44% of earnings so that is a huge uh premium for this for that earnings power uh and as you can see if you look back past 5 minutes that is not always the case and these always they diverge and then they converge and you don't want to be on the side when they start converging which I believe they're going to be doing in coming years be Bears argue us exceptionalism has peaked and say 90% of equities are overvalued I disagree with that statement uh but I do believe that you're going to start to see some outperformance in international and what's going to surprise everyone as they took all the weightings down in China is it's going to be driven by China and uh all the hot money that ran into Japan and India to hide uh in the last few years is now going to come rushing out fomo they're all underperforming they have no exposure as matter of fact Brendan Ahern of kweb did a write up on that they're all screwed they missed this 80% move and now they're got to chase Pile in otherwise they're gonna you know any International active manager that's been hiding out in India and China is toast India is at 52 we lows uh Japan is is uh it's basically done and now uh China has uh left the gate and not let them in so they're going to have to panic Chase on any dip to buy and if you get a gift of Baba at 120 125 um you know and you don't have enough exposure that's going to be probably your last gift and I and I don't think there are any guarantees we get that by the way I think pay at this point is going to keep pushing higher and forcing people not to be in and then you know at 200 it'll pull back you know everyone will get in at 200 and it'll pull back to 175 and scare the out of everyone um all the Johnny come lately is that you know we're selling at 60 and we'll be buying at 200 and then they'll get roasted and that's just it's not to be like mean or arrogant it's just to say that these patterns repeat over and over and over and if you understand them you can say oh I see what's happening uh and and especially if you if you've done the work on the fundamentals if you're just listen to a guy uh and not doing your own homework or or not allocating then um you got to do the work us has looser labor regulations and lower unionization if you build it they will come what they're talking about\n\nhere&#39;s the antithesis so they&#39;re making the case why this time is different which is a dangerous case to make which is better returns for semis versus CC&#39;s so CC&#39;s were just investing at a loss because they could get unlimited free money during the uh uh late 90s today the semis are actually generating a return on invested Capital lower leverage risk for semis versus clecs CC&#39;s were 10 times as expensive as today&#39;s semis clecs burn cash semis generate cash so uh again that&#39;s why we&#39;re of the view that we&#39;re not going to see a tech wreck we&#39;re going to see a tech sideways consolidation to absorb the gains of you know paying for what is going to happen happen five seven nine years out today um you&#39;ve already paid for it so now you got to absorb it to get a little closer to the event ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninvestors eager for a pickup in China growth which of the following developments would you see as the most bullish for 2025 China growth accelerates opinion follows Trend gear to- dat performance in US dollar terms NASDAQ versus uh Hong Kong Shing high and you can just see the dramatic outperformance again on no one&#39;s bingo card at the end of last year on everyone&#39;s bingo card who are loyal listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes global data center power used by application so AI workloads are growing traditional workloads are also growing that is great for natural gas which is why we own Comstock resources side by side at nearly the same basis as Jerry Jones the guy who made his fortune in EN oil and gas and parlayed it into a a dynasty in the Dallas Cowboys which despite their performance is one of the most highly valued franchises in football history domestic investment is picking up after 10 years of uninvested so this is a positive trend for the companies that we look at productivity grew at an annualized pace of 2.8% during the tech boom versus 1.6% in the two decades after this is beginning to pick back up ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nlabor productivity you can see here we&#39;ve been consolidating for 18 years we&#39;re now breaking out and we&#39;re going to start to see massive productivity like we saw in the late 90s and in the early 2000s uh consumer sentiment has been weak on fear of tariffs and inflation and kind of the uncertainty of new volatility every day with a new announcement uh welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1 .0 new day new policy new tweet new volatility get over it if you don&#39;t know what you signed up for that&#39;s what that&#39;s what we got and I think that uh you got to break a few eggs to get an omelet so that&#39;s we&#39;re in the egg breaking process and I think we&#39;re going to get some beautiful big beautiful omelets come out of this uh University of Michigan inflation expectations through the roof y tariffs uh University of Michigan 5 to 10 year inflation expectations same thing tariffs if you look at the data you get the short-term bump intermediate term to long-term prices are actually lower because growth growth tends to slow as well that&#39;s also deflationary S&amp;P Global us manufacturing PMI actually turned up Dallas was uh terrible uh but Philadelphia was good so you&#39;re seeing mix but generally moving in the right direction mortgage rates are coming down now below 7% That&#39;s positive Stanley gen Etc City economic surprise index turning down so we got to keep an eye on this you did see a little bit of that in late 2023 when everyone was calling for a recession that never came so um be mindful but don&#39;t be paralized by it is is what I would say dollar rolling over part of our core thesis yields going down part of our core thesis um non-commercial selling in the hole which is why we&#39;re starting to get get more and more interested in oil and oil related stuff again here&#39;s the seasonal comp composite taken uh not back to 1929 but back to 1994 and here we are in February late February early March things pick up back up I think that is a good model to keep in mind so be ready in the first uh couple of weeks of March for things to look a lot better Doge effect Federal redundancies are uh are rising uh so you know this is a lot of layup we haven&#39;t seen that since 2022 e-commerce retail sales as a percentage of total sales hit a record high now almost 16 a half% that&#39;s bigger than during covid when everyone was locked down so that&#39;s a positive thing for things like Etsy uh and others like Baba uh biggest inflow to Europe in three years opinion follows Trend Japan CPI turning up which means what they have to continue to raise rate which means what the free money of the carry trade is over which means what force selling in mag 7 and passive indices that are overweight mag 7 Japan CPI there we go core inflation hits 19-month high in Japan keeping alive boj rate hike bets Alibaba straight up Alibaba daily return straight up hang sang relative to hangsang Tech dramatically outperform and that&#39;s what we had said uh probably a year ago on the podcast we said that uh when you know the hangsang doubles the key stocks will be up triple you know or quadruple and by the key stocks we mean the alibas etc etc and that&#39;s just begun short interest is still record high in China which means there&#39;s going to be a lot of forced buyers in coming months these these were core part of the thesis as we were laying it out when everyone was uh very negative on China and dollar rolling over I&#39;m sorry the um yuan is strengthening relative to the dollar which no one thought would happen and guess what China bond yields are going up two things that you see every cycle when Chinese equities take off here&#39;s India people couldn&#39;t get enough in 2024 at the peak uh now it&#39;s rolling over everyone&#39;s selling in the hole if you remember all the Articles record options record call options in India&#39;s history it was unbelievable they were like doing more options than the United States and they&#39;re like so so much smaller you know economy and markets by capitalization and those are all this hell taale signs and people this chart is actually let um um accelerated into it broke through on the downside if you remember we covered this last week it&#39;s actually broke below this so it&#39;s a whatever they call it a bearish pennant so keep an eye on that uh Insider transactions is actually at a level that&#39;s contrarian bullish we&#39;re actually even seeing it in Cooper standard insid or buying we&#39;re going to cover later in the podcast first time in a while here&#39;s the treasuries we&#39;ve been saying bonds up yields down here&#39;s the short interest these people are going to get Smokey smoked they haven&#39;t been this short since 2018 2014 right before monster rallies in bonds tequila is the only Spirit seeing sales growth in the US um diio has a lot of tequila and good good good tequila brands staples versus the market haven&#39;t seen this since 2000 early 2000s again another thing factor that is rhyming with our 2020 2001 to 2007 lot of similarities China outperform small caps value uh and Staples so pay attention to this uh this is an extreme opportunity here and uh we&#39;ve got some expression through hormell but we&#39;re going to find some others as well growth versus value in the last couple days growth rolling over value rallying this is from Thomas defasio uh the son of my friend had a chance to have lunch with them about a year ago and uh so hello to Bobby and Thomas Thomas is putting out the Russell 2000 back to support at the 200 day moving average not quite oversold but a bounce could be in play here soon we agree good work Thomas uh here&#39;s babo breaking out of the uh basing pattern here measured move would be from 60 to 120 takes us up first stop 180 and then I think we we consolidate before going even higher dollar rolling over as anticipated what do you think the\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmost stocks are trading at their lowest correlation to the index or each other than at any time since 2021 which dampens the index ability to break out and or move with any meaningful momentum it&#39;s a stock Pickers Market folks this does not support double digigit returns in 2025 we tend to agree you know I think the S&P is going to be as we said uh fourth quarter last year it&#39;s going to be like a 7 to 9% year S&P 500 and um and I think absolute unbelievable fortunes are going to be made under the surface for people positioned in the right way and in the ways that uh we&#39;ve been talking about for many weeks and months bull markets in the S&P 500 1957 to date uh what you&#39;re seeing here again is the average gain is 145% in 52 weeks we are only at 71% in 28 weeks which means there&#39;s a lot of Runway left we agree as a reminder growth versus value this ladies and gentlemen zerp right here where growth outperform value that is the exception this ladies and gentlemen the red where value outperforms growth is the rule okay 4% 4.4% compounded since the late 20s if you get positioned on the right side of the boat ahead of the crowd fortunes will be made and are already being made ladies and gentlemen wink wink uh you know all you guys with eating your bananas sideways know what I&#39;m talking about uh US dollar Index I like this cycle index on Twitter I don&#39;t know who this is Jason P um I think this is correct the these things run in cycles and you can see here what is it I don&#39;t know what this is probably an 11year cycle or something like that they&#39;re not perfect but they&#39;re always worth noting uh cover that initial claims in Washington the highest since 2023 also is ticking up Nationwide so worth keeping your eye on that is deflationary everyone&#39;s worried about inflation worried about deflation uh 10year yield that&#39;s from zardi\nhere is from Almanac Trader kind of pointing to the same thing little weakness in early March and then we start to take off that&#39;s that for the data let&#39;s go through some",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nGlobal light vehicle sales this is related to Cooper standard which is an awesome position we're super excited about uh as you can see we are recovering from covid uh and we're we're seeing it you know it's it's it's hysterical management put out that sandbagger 15.1 million production for this year and blamed S&P for the number but and I said well wait a second how do you get to 15.1 produ C when estimated SAR by SNP and Cox is 16.2 and 16.3 uh and they're like well you know there are inventories it it's complete nonsense uh the inventories are at historic lows which we covered last week and number two if you overlay uh production numbers and Us sell through for the last 40 years it's basically the same line so all of the sudden magnificently there's going to be some Divergence between between the two I think not that's just a play on keeping the oems at Bay so the oems don't come knocking for more margin uh so when these things hockey stick they're going to hockey stick overnight\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nhere is the data that we referenced with Stu uh regarding Nvidia so so people are shocked why is NVIDIA down 8% da it's because their growth rate is decelerating and that's okay if you're trading at 10 times earnings it's not okay when you're trading at 30 times sales and 45 times earnings so basically they and by the way the one thing I didn't expect that happen is their gross margins are eroding as well uh other than that how was to play Mrs Lincoln so uh here's what you see in data center revenues they have uh grown $4 billion per quarter for basically the past year uh and that sounds great and it is great okay the problem is is the base keeps getting bigger and the growth rate is decelerating was 250% off a small base last year uh you know and down uh this this quarter was well below 100% and will be well below 50% before the end of the year on top of that now you have margin worries you have competition worries and because of deep seek their Edge called cuda which everyone thought was going to be the next apple Walled Garden has proven to be not the case so all they become is exactly what they've always been which is a commodity producer and it will be erased to the bottom with margins as more of these inferior chips can be utilized and as I love to say the king of inferior chips is Intel watch out not only do will they be able to deliver inferior chips to generate outsized performance like deep sea created with inferior chips but they will be the only game in town part of their problem\n\nhere is the average path of the S&amp;P during years one and two of the election cycle that&#39;s going all the way back to 1928 here we are uh you know about eight weeks in you got this low we probably rally in uh March a little bit maybe Tech gets a little bid then we go back and test and then we rally uh from you know the end of March through through the late part of the year that is the average for this year of the cycle I think next year gets a lot choppier it is a midterm election year you come out of the gate strong you have a lot of weakness into the election and then at year end rally so I think we&#39;ve got a really nice Runway here coming and uh it&#39;s good to pay attention to these statistics and patterns this is a proxy for what we&#39;ve been calling for for a while this is just today&#39;s chart what do you see down uh sh all the shiny object stocks all the mag seven are down every other part of the market is up expect to see more of that this was super unpopular when we laid this out for you last year ladies and gentlemen as you know and it&#39;s happening every single day and people are shocked why are they shocked you know I don&#39;t know ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES Nvidia David data center Rue here&#39;s the growth rate uh okay that I was pointing to greater than 250% now uh by we just hit basically here well below 100% and by the end of the year we&#39;ll be well below 50% that&#39;s perfectly exciting growth rates unless you&#39;re trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS moving along here&#39;s the Russell just consolidating here this is a huge what they like to call cup and handle we don&#39;t really care much about that stuff but we do pay attention and we don&#39;t ignore it and the implication of that is that you get a measure move so figure about 800 points which would imply uh you know 40% above the highs here and I think this is just getting started and people say well that&#39;s a fantasy you know you&#39;ve You&#39; wanted to see small caps go for a while well small caps have gone a lot okay for a while so uh we&#39;re absolutely right about that and uh we think it&#39;s just just beginning and all you need to do is follow the earnings growth S&amp;P 500 at you know 134% uh and small caps depending which index you look at between 21 and 45% whether you&#39;re looking at the small S&amp;P 600 or the Russell 2000 uh\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nbelieve Advanced Auto Parts continues to make solid progress on many different issues that have persisted at Advanced Auto Parts for years moreover bulls have shown patience and understand the transformation will take time they believe Advanced a Parts is managing expectations to realistic levels as such they don't completely understand why the stock closed down Bulls are confident that after the store closures are done in March and the company turns its Total Focus to its various growth initiatives the fundamentals of the business will start to improve moreover Bulls were pleased with AAP stated its largest strategic cons customer renewed a multi-year contract with Advanced Auto Parts and believe Advanced Auto Parts accelerates 2025 vendor conference returning is a good sign that vendors do in fact want to support Advanced Auto Part altogether bull the Advanced Auto Part as the most levered opportunity to get involved in the auto aftermarket and as such will benefit nicely when the industry sees Improvement Allin bulls have a line of sight to $4.50 e EPS at the end of 2026 you apply a growth rate to that when they're recovering the market will give them benefit of Doubt rate it to 18 to 20 times and then they'll start to do more than that and if you look at their Bal sheet now since they to sold off the Canada business the name of the game with turnarounds is solvy risk and they've solved that they got uh I think I looked 1.8 billion dollar of cash on the balance sheet paid off a bunch of debt winner as a jockey so I I love these stories absolutely love these stories here's Nvidia over the last few days down from 143 to 120 uh here's palent here from 125 down to 84 shiny object Slaughter Fest this was uh these are for those of you are wondering this is a rounding error maybe it turns into a big business but for those of you wondering Cooper standard um which is a big position for us has the ceiling systems around the doors fluid transfer systems uh supplies to the oems but they also have this business because of their rubber technology that they just started partnering with Nike on a lot of their high-end sneakers for runners and longdistance Runners so if you Google Nike react X shoes that rubber is from Cooper standard and they get paid big on every single unit sold and it seems like more and more units are being sold so that could be something that's not even on our model uh which would be uh added whipped cream and a cherry so uh keep an eye on that Rising demand for protection open interest in vix calls has jumped relative to put options so this is the type of environment that you probably want to stop selling in the hole if you've been doing that and start to look for things to buy    I think we pretty flushed out here's from Ryan Dietrich today is historically the worst day of a weak month during one of the weakest times of the year so we're probably and we had warned you guys second half of February you can go look at the tapes on Varney Etc expect some volatility uh all of that that has shown up more sanguin about March and then following through there so uh it's time to deploy some Capital out of sync a gauge realized correlation is hovering near the lowest level ever what does this mean it means this is the best time ever to be picking stocks and the worst time ever to be in passive uh indexes exclusively uh speculators further reduce depending what passive indexes you're in also speculators further reduce net bullish bets on oil so a lot of people are selling oil in the hole which makes me continue to be interested in finding some more exposure Beyond comp stock resources which has been a home run uh so we'll continue to be patient and look for opportunity there but in no rush LG exports rise to an all-time high which is why we played the natural gas comp stock uh uh in the eights and nines and now it's uh I think it's in the 20s again uh and just getting started the relationship between sell through and production so Jeff uh put this out uh and basically did the overlay vehicle sales versus production 1990 to 2024 again exact same line uh six out of seven cases where annual production deficits exceed 1 million production rebounded by an average of 8.5 annually over the next two three years so there's a huge catch up even if they're right um if the 2025 deficit holds this suggests that production could reach 16 million Vehicles by 2026 and exceed 17 million by 2027 so in some sense you hope they're right sandbagging because then it's just a hockey stick but I think uh they're going to be wrong and we're going to be up around 16 million production and they're going to Mint a lot of money to the bottom line and we'll see a couple bucks of earnings and the market will give it credit for a few more bucks than that and this thing will start to hum you know for those of you who are brand new uh they earned you know this is a $15 stock we started our initial positioning and public uh uh went public on the claim and countdown in May of 2022 you can go back to the notes    built a basis around 550 we've added over time as new clients have come in uh base is still well below 10 and then    so the premise was that the stock on 17.1 million SAR in 2017 Peak earned $719 a share and traded at $146 uh they've taken 600 some OD million dollars of cost out of the business we believe that because of their efficiency now as the volumes recover continue to recover as they do every single cycle uh without fail to somewhere between 17 and 18 million uh sell through Peak uh they're not going to earn $7 this cycle we think they'll earn it north of $10 and maybe they don't get the 20 times multiple they got to be a $146 stock but what if they get a 10 times multiple on $10 of earnings versus a 20 times multiple on seven you still have a $100 stock and what they get a 15 times multiple and you got $150 stock and God forbid they actually get a 20 times multiple    you have a higher stock than that so we like our odds and we like Management's

represents a large portion of our health care exposure and as you can see this thing has done the same thing over and over uh for 40 plus years and they&#39;ve been around a lot longer than that this is just the price chart gets oversold every cycle they work through the inventory they recover because they have durable moat in their products uh as you can see the price fell for a reason cash flow fell they overstocked they did a dumb deal with h hillrom they then sold off um excuse me sold off the kidney business I&#39;m sorry I got confused with uh uh sold up the kidney kidney business which was the lowest growing business in The Firm which put pressure on the multiple now that that slowest growing division is gone and they&#39;ve used the cash to pay down debt earnings are going to increase and then you&#39;re going to get a multiple reating from low double digits to probably closer to 20 and then you&#39;re going to get the growth back and this thing is going to be a double and more over time uh and we&#39;re pretty excited about so you should go through all these points that he underlined and starred as we do every week uh with different companies and see why we&#39;re confident in our position and uh and and we like this moving forward so they divested the lowest margin slowest growing business which was the Kidney Care business and got good money for it you can see the PE is depressed because of that it&#39;s going to expand back to I mean this is traded you know at 13 times now it&#39;s been as high as 30 times 25 times uh every cycle you get these Peaks and this time will be no different uh so go through this last shall be first China Edition for almost three years investors wanted nothing to do with Chinese equities with\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines  week after week calling China uninvestable and stuck in a second bare Market foreign purchases of Chinese stocks dropped to an 8-year low in 2023 with a prior low in 2015 which turned out to be a generational buying opportunity meanwhile 89% of global active funds held less than 5% allocation to the world&#39;s second largest economy uh so here are the\n\nit did this preceded a monster rally in 2017 and 18 and we we brought this chart to you uh While most were running for the exits we saw the disconnect between price and value as an opportunity Wall Street is the only place when they hold a clearance sale everyone runs out of the store for those of you who&#39;ve been with us for a while you know we&#39;ve expressed our China exposure through one of our favorite stocks in largest position Alibaba we started buying in the hundreds and backed up the truck in the 60s giving us a blended cost basis in the low 80s as part of our original thesis on Alibaba was that the performance and fundamentals reminded us of Microsoft from 2006 to 2013 during that period Microsoft saw Revenue up 112% cash flow per share up 200% earnings per share up 120% but the return on the share price was 0% over 7even years then a flip uh a switch flipped and Microsoft went on to deliver nearly 1,500% returns over the next 7 years 36% kager and if you look at the underlying fundamentals of what Revenue cash flow and earnings did over that period it wasn&#39;t much greater than when the stock gained 0% everyone thinks Saia did these miraculous things but the performance of the fundamentals was not that much greater under bomber bomber actually um created the foundation I mean yes so he missed mobile I mean you know can&#39;t take a joke but uh leaving that aside um it goes to show you when you hold the beach ball underwater long enough eventually the catchup is abrupt and it is massive and Alibaba will will look will be massive ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nokay fast forward to Alibaba over the past decade it&#39;s even more pronounced holding the beach ball under water Revenue per share up 1,00% cash flow per share up over 500% earnings per share up over 500% share price was up 10% with mostly negative returns compared to 2014 levels before its recent parabolic surge and just beginning you can only hold a beach ball underwater for so long and sure enough the world seems to have finally  Walken up to the fact what we&#39;ve been pounding the table on for the past two years Alibaba is the number one play on the recovery of China&#39;s middle class the number one cheapest Global AI playing essentially a China AI ETF Alibaba then went on to report blowout quarter last week and now it&#39;s all anyone wants to talk about if you wondering what we mean when we say opinion follows Trend look no further than the upgrades below the stock was hated in the 60s 70s and 80s but now at 140 investors can&#39;t get enough uh Morgan Stanley overweight moved their price Target from 100 to 180 up 80% Benchmark moved it from 118 to 190 Bernstein moved it from 104 to 165 Barkley&#39;s moved it from 130 to 180 JP Morgan moved it from 125 to 170 si uh I guess that&#39;s susuan moved it from 130 to 175 uh no more BR moved it from 130 to 172 Bank of America from 117 to 150 Dan hives went on CNBC calling Alibaba the best AI play in China and presenting his base case of a valuation of $500 billion market cap base case $200 and10 $210 per share we agree not only our sside analyst turning bullish but Mainland investors via the southbound stock connect program continue to Pile in the total ownership of Mainland investors now sits at 6% of the float which we believe to still be in the early Innings analyst had initially projected $20 billion of inflows before the parabolic move and with peers like 10 cent and bil B having 10 and 15% respectively of their float held through the program these inflows still have legs and massive legs thereafter here a couple quotes from Brandon showing that that data and uh here&#39;s a breakdown of the report as you can see price followed cash flow cash flow is now even going up and we were always confident in this because we had the runway they had $80 billion of gross $60 billion in net cash they bought back a ton of stock uh at the lows unlike most American CEOs which buy at the highs so they can dump out their own shares in China they buy at the lows which is actually the right thing to do um and uh and now cash flow is recovering on top of it and the game is on so you can see all the data here go through sector by sector growth between the international knocking the cover off the ball tbow and te- all monster business now growing again um uh t-all grew 9% tound t-all group grew 9% this is a huge business uh Cloud Revenue reignited double digits at 13% AI as we said triple digit growth for the six consecutive quarter so go through all these and go carefully through the conference call and the areas that we&#39;ve highlighted and you will see why we are so excited and just getting started and um long way to go here Etsy he did an update all you need to know is this thing is a cash machine so you&#39;re generating the same amount of cash as you were when it was a $300 stock they just hit record revenues and you can&#39;t give away the stock so this is going to be another Alibaba everyone&#39;s going to be selling in the hole and then when it gets up to 100 120 everyone&#39;s going to be interested and that&#39;s just the way it goes they&#39;re going to turn the corner this thing is absolutely fine and they&#39;ve got everything they need strong balance sheet lots of cash pretty good leadership uh and a niche market so you can go through our our uh stuff there Canada Goose cash flow exploding again a lot of collabs had a cold winter everything&#39;s back on track with that uh pessimism fear and greed down at 22 this is when you want to be a buyer not a seller be selective and so on so great article there Jeff helped put that uh all together in a very great way uh earnings top IDP IBD top 50 growth index top 30 weights in the last 60 days the earnings estimates have gone up by double digits uh 11% and up 8% so keep an eye on some of these names that have been battered basic materials uh have gone down they&#39;re still trading in the hole this is going to start to inflect so this is where the puck is going to be going on a selective basis pay attention to that uh Cooper standard is for the first time in in a long time seeing Insider buying uh this is John mastrocola he is a director went into the open markets and bought stock at $15 and 1526 and 1455 for $118,000 look it sounds like a rounding error of lunch money but for most of these directors uh it&#39;s not a that is a huge amount of money and um so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a serious token and then the C fo uh who I&#39;ve met with a super great guy went in the market and also bought stock at $15 uh he bought about $45,000 and if you look at his salary you will see that that is a meaningful amount of money so these guys are seeing what we see and it&#39;s a great vote of confidence and uh kudos to them and they&#39;re going to make a ton of money and they absolutely deserve to make a ton of money and we&#39;re super excited to be part of it um okay so here&#39;s some economic data we&#39;ve got kind of gone through all that earnings were good guidance they took down seasonally which we covered and\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nof synergies and I do think you&#39;re GNA I think they&#39;re sandbagging this in the short term I do think you&#39;re going to see higher margins than that I do think you&#39;re going to see a hockey stick inflection of revenues that they&#39;re not even anticipating and then the synergies of the Hub and spoke as they get a concentrated foothold versus this disparate foothold on the west coast uh we like this story we agree with the bull thesis that we went through early earlier and uh we thank you for the question this for me uh with my eyes closed uh my view is that it&#39;s at least a double from recent levels and I think it&#39;s going to be a lot more as um Shane o Kelly uh just straightens it out we&#39;ve kind of done all the clean up now so we&#39;re basically cleared out the mest D stocked got the synergies going and now I think we&#39;re going to move into growth and don&#39;t forget they are expanding stores still in those areas and now the balance sheet you know you had when this stock dropped from you know $225 you know buying it in the 40s um you know it it looked like there was no end in sight this is this is this is just what happens it has these cyclical bottoms every handful of years they come in and they fix it this will be no different and now they&#39;ve got a better leader than they&#39;ve ever had in history so if this was you know a double I think happens with the eyes closed I think this could be a lot more than that if he can execute 50% on what he&#39;s saying I think they&#39;re going to catch a lot of Tailwinds that they&#39;re not expecting they&#39;re making projections on the basis of a very pessimistic Outlook right now and I think as things get better those estimates are going to go up just like with the analyst so uh we like this one and we love the fact that they&#39;ve deris the balance sheet uh massively from where when we initiated the position Steve Franks correct me if I&#39;m wrong the hell is this Advanced Auto Part same",

it&#39;s going to be mag seven I said no way man you got you know Watch What Happens and sure enough price followed the earnings growth and and we&#39;re off these earnings are decelerating these earnings went from Flat to 20% and surprise surprise the price followed uh CBO skew index sores uh you have to pay attention to this we&#39;ve covered skewed many times on this um but you know you buy protection before a fire not not in the middle of a fire and uh I I think we&#39;ve done a lot of damage under the surface a lot of these momentum crowded trade shiny object uh popular stocks uh have gotten completely smoked and I think we&#39;re getting closer to the end of the liquidation than the beginning 10-year treasury yield rolling over uh discretionary looks like it could potentially be ready for a bounce in coming weeks Staples might be a little overdone in terms of the defensiveness expectations for cuts are now going up people are pricing in slower growth with the tariffs uh and yields are coming down fed Cuts expectations going up uh here are some of the the mag 7 this was a couple of days ago these have look these are looking a lot worse now most of them are down about 20% Tesla maybe a little more Nvidia got hit a lot harder today uh February is the worst month of the year in postelection year second half of February all these stuff that you were ready for now has played out uh not a lot of debt but delinquencies are rising from low levels so again these are historic low levels of debt so yes you will see delinquencies but it&#39;s off a very very multi-decade historic low base Debt Service much less of a burden now um a lot of a lot of debt was locked in at very low rates consumer confidence a little bit grinding sideways we saw that actually right before uh the first Trump Administration I think you&#39;re going to start to see a re acceleration just like you did in Trump 1.0 uh here&#39;s the breakdown of the mag s from Mike zardi you can see this pennant actually broke down below the uh volume by price as well which implies it could see some more pain for those overweight stocks and which you know wouldn&#39;t be surprising but um we&#39;re not stepping in that&#39;s not our game we&#39;ve got what we love and uh and they&#39;re doing well I mean I can&#39;t tell you the amount of days that the market was getting smashed in February that our that our p&l was positive it&#39;s I&#39;ve never seen anything like it it was just unbelievable uh mag 7 expecting Superior earnings growth THS is 493 but it&#39;s cutting in it&#39;s decelerating that&#39;s the big deal unmagnify is accelerating that&#39;s why these are going to outperform and those are going to underperform uh\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  Tech relative to the S&amp;P 500 this is what they call a rounded top or a head and shoulders or whatever really is useless uh uh thing but worth noting I think on a relative basis okay it doesn&#39;t have to crash but on a relative basis I think we&#39;re going to see continued out performance this is not good if you&#39;re overweight in passive indices that are weighted to the um mag 7 or in the mag 7 names themselves this is not a positive development you want to see maybe it will be a fake out and then we get that rally in March uh which is fine but here&#39;s the positioning everyone is crowded to one side of the boat you can see it here we had a ton of data this week\nhere is  the bond starting to Rally here&#39;s a reverse Head and Shoulders bottom which implies a massive rally like we saw in 2018 here&#39;s bearish sentiment uh this is the a aii percentage of bears we have only seen this two other times since 1986 both were at or near major three times major bottoms you saw this level of pessimism in the covid lows you saw this level of pessimism during the great financial crisis lows and you saw this level of pessimism during the early 90s recession which was caused by a banking crisis and if you remember the Orange County real estate crisis when the Japanese money all pulled out I will be interested to see what happens with Orange County real estate uh in the next few years as Chinese money stops flowing out of China and stays in China due to fear of loss as everything else starts to go back up in China uh and you see more and more price Cuts in Orange County could be very very interesting and what else do you have here vix we covered Richmond manufacturing was good somu at the state level we got to keep our eye on here possible signal of recessions uh this is probably somewhat skewed by Washington DC so we&#39;ll keep an eye on it cover 10 your buying years Bitcoin has also gotten shacked down to 85,000 uh that kind of qualifies in the speculative uh bucket that we talk about a lot so that&#39;s getting hurt um here&#39;s the bull bear spread again you saw this level of pessimism at the 2022 lows if you remember that&#39;s when we were buying uh Amazon and Google deep in the hole when no one wanted it quick doubles within it was like a year uh so I think there&#39;s going to be really incredible opportunities in the next few weeks to be able to benefit as well this is UN believable pessimism coming out uh TLT bonds starting to dramatically outperform S&amp;P 500 in line with our uh themes for the year that you all know uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really exciting when you see all the pieces coming together as we had said uh in some of the foggy times I said hang in there when it comes it comes all at once and we are seeing that in Spades\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\npotential 1.5 trillion savings over 30 years from G p 1es i mean you speak about productivity if they get glps down to you know 10020 bucks a month which they already have generics uh and they continue to do do to do all the things every single insurance company is going to sponsor them people are going to get fit and healthy and it&#39;s going to save trillions of dollars of health care costs if this continues at the same pace which is pretty exciting uh fewer jobs expected in the next six months so a lot of pessimism and uncertainty that&#39;s normal Trump 1.0 uh manifesting in Trump 2.0 and the outcomes of 1.0 were very very good for the average worker uh minorities workingclass people did really well real wages did great uh conference board CEO confidence ticking up again this is what you saw in 2001 it&#39;s what you saw coming out of the great financial crisis off a very low basis this is actually very positive uh if I didn&#39;t mention yields going down let me just mention it one more time uh mortgage rates going down that&#39;s good China to start bank recapitalizations with at least $55 billion M2 money supply in China turning up this is a big precursor to massive expansion [Music] um Magnificent Seven slides into correction territory the basket is down well over 10% now Tesla is down from almost $480 down to 300 so it took its post-election rally back uh at least 60% of it back and uh we&#39;ll see how that plays out growth versus value growth is getting shellacked I think this trend is going to persist value is going to be performing lots of money going to be made in value the right value not not value traps but um companies with growth with cash flow growing turning around that type of stuff US stocks are now lagging the rest of the world uh here&#39;s the news cor story count for firings job cuts and layoffs I haven&#39;t seen this record since late 2022 that was a massive buying opportunity uh analysts are raising European earnings estimates Microsoft data center leases are slowing analysts say raising investor attention about demand for nvidia&#39;s products is basically what it comes down to um again after the aii bull bear belows Falls below -4 where it is right now one week later the Market&#39;s down on average 1% two weeks later it&#39;s up 14 basis points a month later it&#39;s up 2% two months later on average it&#39;s up almost 5% 3 months later 6% 6 months later 13.7 9 months later it&#39;s up 19% and one year later it&#39;s up 22% so this level of pessimism May in fact prove to be a very positive thing once the Bottom&#39;s in cycle composite this is where we are right now expect more rocking into early February and then straight up from there so a lot of things pointing to the same outcome most stocks are trading this from Seth uh golden most stocks are trading at their lowest correlation to the index or each other than at any time since 2021 which dampens the index ability to break out and or move with any meaningful momentum it&#39;s a stock Pickers Market folks this does not support double digigit returns in 2025 we tend to agree you know I think the S&amp;P is going to be as we said uh fourth quarter last year it&#39;s going to be like a 7 to 9% year S&amp;P 500 and um and I think absolute unbelievable fortunes are going to be made under the surface for people positioned in the right way and in the ways that uh we&#39;ve been talking about for many weeks and months bull markets in the S&amp;P 500 1957 to date uh what you&#39;re seeing here again is the average gain is 145% in 52 weeks we are only at 71% in 28 weeks which means there&#39;s a lot of Runway left we agree as a reminder growth versus value this ladies and gentlemen zerp right here where growth outperform value that is the exception this ladies and gentlemen the red where value outperforms growth is the rule okay 4% 4.4% compounded since the late 20s if you get positioned on the right side of the boat ahead of the crowd fortunes will be made and are already being made ladies and gentlemen wink wink uh you know all you guys with eating your bananas sideways know what I&#39;m talking about uh US dollar Index I like this cycle index on Twitter I don&#39;t know who this is Jason P um I think this is correct the these things run in cycles and you can see here what is it I don&#39;t know what this is probably an 11year cycle or something like that they&#39;re not perfect but they&#39;re always worth noting uh cover that initial claims in Washington the

added $618 million to alibaba&#39;s bottle bottom line and what else did you want possible yeah Trump&#39;s talking about having good relationship with Z though I I think you may have noted this week in that live press conference trying to see see the line that I wanted uh boosting cons quote unquote Premier Lee presided over a state council meeting the key point from the statement below is that it gives an indication of policies coming out of the Dual sessions in early March pay attention to this guys in poker this is called AEL this statement has the potential to have significant implications I didn&#39;t know you&#39;re a poker player Brendon we got to sit down and play uh quote boosting consumption is an important starting point for expanding domestic demand and stabilizing growth but also a major measure to change the medium and long-term development mode we should put consumption in a more prominent position and rely more on boosting consumption and to expand domestic demands smooth the economic cycle and stimulate economic growth we should make every effort to enhance consumption capacity adopt more effective consumption Pol promotion policies break the barriers and constraints restricting consumption and make every effort to optimize the consumption environment and to strive to open the chain of consumption driving investment industrial upgrading employment and income increase look the number one toll taker for consumption in China is Ali Baba okay they are the largest online retailer with tbal t-all uh if this is the direction the government wants to go no one is going to be a bigger B beneficiary than Alibaba so the game is just beginning uh Ryan Cohen boost his Alibaba stake to $1 billion paler insiders keep selling shares after4 billion winfall in 2024 so just like Jensen Wong filing to sell a billion dollars in June when we put out our article basically which marked the top in the price uh had negative returns for their subsequent six months uh filed to sell 1.2 billion Alex karp is doing the exact same thing the palent tyrians Can&#39;t Get Enough stock and you know what he&#39;s going to help them out and dump billions of dollars of shares on their head as they all chase the shiny object and ignore what&#39;s going on Mara Lago Accord chatter is getting wall Street&#39;s attention this is a big deal so two things that they want to have happen it&#39;s going to mimic what happened with the plaza Accord in 1985 it will be called the mara Lago Accord uh of course it will be a big beautiful deal uh the dollar will weaken which helps what which helps our emerging markets in China trade uh and it will uh there two aspects number one weakening the dollar and number two they&#39;re floating uh swapping some of their treasuries into hundred-year non-tradable zeroc coupon bonds if these nations needed cash quickly a Federal Reserve could make it temporarily available to them through a lending facility uh basically swapping it out for paper which would uh eliminate the carry or the negative carry on paying out the interest payments uh and lower the debt to GDP because the zero coupon trades at a huge discount I mean if they could pull it off what we&#39;d have to give an exchange for them to to take the swap uh would be very interesting but some institutions will want it so they can hold the marks on their books as at at par um if they actually pull this off this will be the greatest trade of all time uh in terms of I mean trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars saved for the us so that said the other thing that they announced is selling the golden visas for five million a pop and they could raise uh a quick um trillion or two trillion dollars I&#39;ll tell you if they want to raise the quick trillion to2 trillion doll what they need to do is put an expiration date on it and say we&#39;ll sell these bees for $5 million a pop for the first 12 months after 12 months either a it&#39;s going to be discontinued if we&#39;re over subscribed or B it&#39;s going to be up to $10 million from that point forward so get all these $5 million in I mean they could get a million two a trillion two trillion bucks into the treasury super quickly and that would be something again that was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of this year so pretty exciting stuff all right let&#39;s keep moving got to move this button here okay best and republicans in Congress Kickstart tax cut talks I mean these guys must be working literally 24 hours a day the amount of things that they have going so some deflationary with Doge which is a good thing some unbelievable restructurings with the logo Accord then tax cuts on top of it then tariffs on top of I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable

lowest overall weight in the index around 10% in over 25 years however over roughly the same period total us care healthc care spending more than tripled rising from 1.4 trillion in 2000 to 5 trillion in 2024 uh you could see the underperformance when we were on at the end of the year what made us even more Curious was that despite the weakness the sector was and remains projected to achieve the second highest earnings growth in 2025 expecting a 19% increase compared to the S&P 12.7 same thing we talked about with materials uh remember in the short term the mark Market is a voting machine based on emotions in the long term it is a weighing machine driven by fundamentals so two months into the year how are things playing out so far healthc care is the number one performing sector technology negative uh consumer discretionary negative healthc care up 7.3 materials up 5.3 S&P up 1.73 Healthcare is the top performing sector uh outperforming the SNP by 4.2 times looks like the

article from her since Alibaba went up 80% um she&#39;ll be reassigned that&#39;s what that&#39;s what they always do like a priest send them to another Parish uh foreign purchases of of China stocks dropped to eight-year low in 2018 last time it did this preceded a monster rally in 2017 and 18 and we we brought this chart to you uh While most were running for the exits we saw the disconnect between price and value as an opportunity Wall Street is the only place when they hold a clearance sale everyone runs out of the store for those of you who&#39;ve been with us for a while you know we&#39;ve expressed our China exposure through one of our favorite stocks in largest position Alibaba we started buying in the hundreds and backed up the truck in the 60s giving us a blended cost basis in the low 80s as part of our original thesis on Alibaba was that the performance and fundamentals reminded us of Microsoft from 2006 to 2013 during that period Microsoft saw Revenue up 112% cash flow per share up 200% earnings per share up 120% but the return on the share price was 0% over 7even years then a flip uh a switch flipped and Microsoft went on to deliver nearly 1,500% returns over the next 7 years 36% kager and if you look at the underlying fundamentals of what Revenue cash flow and earnings did over that period it wasn&#39;t much greater than when the stock gained 0% everyone thinks Saia did these miraculous things but the performance of the fundamentals was not that much greater under bomber bomber actually um created the foundation I mean yes so he missed mobile I mean you know can&#39;t take a joke but uh leaving that aside um it goes to show you when you hold the beach ball underwater long enough eventually the catchup is abrupt and it is massive and Alibaba will will look will be massive okay fast forward to Alibaba over the past decade it&#39;s even more pronounced holding the beach ball under water Revenue per share up 1,00% cash flow per share up over 500% earnings per share up over 500% share price was up 10% with mostly negative returns compared to 2014 levels before its recent parabolic surge and just beginning you can only hold a beach ball underwater for so long and sure enough the world seems to have",

    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nhere is the average path of the S&amp;P during years one and two of the election cycle that&#39;s going all the way back to 1928 here we are uh you know about eight weeks in you got this low we probably rally in uh March a little bit maybe Tech gets a little bid then we go back and test and then we rally uh from you know the end of March through through the late part of the year that is the average for this year of the cycle I think next year gets a lot choppier it is a midterm election year you come out of the gate strong you have a lot of weakness into the election and then at year end rally so I think we&#39;ve got a really nice Runway here coming and uh it&#39;s good to pay attention to these statistics and patterns this is a proxy for what we&#39;ve been calling for for a while this is just today&#39;s chart what do you see down uh sh all the shiny object stocks all the mag seven are down every other part of the market is up expect to see more of that this was super unpopular when we laid this out for you last year ladies and gentlemen as you know and it&#39;s happening every single day and people are shocked why are they shocked you know I don&#39;t know ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES Nvidia David data center Rue here&#39;s the growth rate uh okay that I was pointing to greater than 250% now uh by we just hit basically here well below 100% and by the end of the year we&#39;ll be well below 50% that&#39;s perfectly exciting growth rates unless you&#39;re trading at 30 times sales and 44 times earnings ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS moving along here&#39;s the Russell just consolidating here this is a huge what they like to call cup and handle we don&#39;t really care much about that stuff but we do pay attention and we don&#39;t ignore it and the implication of that is that you get a measure move so figure about 800 points which would imply uh you know 40% above the highs here and I think this is just getting started and people say well that&#39;s a fantasy you know you&#39;ve You&#39; wanted to see small caps go for a while well small caps have gone a lot okay for a while so uh we&#39;re absolutely right about that and uh we think it&#39;s just just beginning and all you need to do is follow the earnings growth S&amp;P 500 at you know 134% uh and small caps depending which index you look at between 21 and 45% whether you&#39;re looking at the small S&amp;P 600 or the Russell 2000 uh\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the Russell just consolidating here this is a huge what they like to call cup and handle we

breaking out here from the base the relative for the S&P turning up aggressively here&#39;s the Hang sang on a daily breaking out to all-time new highs my guess is we break higher go back and test it before making the next parabolic move same thing here here&#39;s what Robert sler has to say about Alibaba continues to carve out longer term bot pattern after rallying 80% from its January low Baba is likely to start to pause uh just under its 38% retracement level near $157 first support is near $1 120 followed by 105 yeah I think we&#39;re going back to 120 um I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going back to 105 but I could definitely see this this huge base breakout back test and then straight up uh and probably next stop after that would be 188 or 219 uh and um welcome to the party ladies and gentlemen early days but uh if you get a move back to the low 120s and you don&#39;t have enough stock that&#39;s probably where I&#39;d buy it uh can I guarantee we&#39;re going to go back down to 120 before we take off no it might take off you know as I said uh when we were down in the 70s and 80s I said when this thing moves it&#39;s not going to let anyone in and it absolutely didn&#39;t I mean straight up 80% uh in a blink you know matter of weeks and everyone top ticking it at 140 so probably got to wipe out some of those weak sisters before we go to 200 uh here&#39;s in a new quarterly Revenue growth we thought uh even if they did the 4 billion um you know the stock would be down and now their guidance is they&#39;re they&#39;re actually not even able to do the 4 billion so uh this thing is is going to trap trapped a lot of retail investors chasing the shiny objects and that&#39;s the way it goes history repeats uh history doesn&#39;t even rhyme it repeats I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s just so clear as clear as the sky is blue uh fizer is interesting been a notable lagard but is showing early signs of bottoming in the mid-20s this one is starting to be interested interesting in the healthcare theme so uh we&#39;ll continue to pay attention to that re regeneron is a proxy for biotech I think the same story here that Schumer is pointing out from his technical standpoint we like from a fundamental standpoint and uh I think we&#39;re going to see some great things happening with biotech crown castle uh nice of him to cover this one uh thanks over there notably lagg but showing early signs of bottoming and weekly momentum moving up further upside from current levels you know we think this goes to 140 over the next 12 to 24 months plus you get a 7% dividend yield while you wait they&#39;re selling off the uh Capital intensive low return fiber business for over eight billion to Z group they&#39;ll use that to pay down debt buy more towers and the 40,000 Towers they have require like zero capex they just mint money I mean if you think the treasury prints money you should see uh Crown Castle&#39;s primary business of the 40,000 Towers it just they have to do nothing and it just keeps spitting out cash so I want to own that and when I can do it at a you know 60% discount from its recent Peak I&#39;m going to do it all day long and collect the big dividend yield lock that in in the meantime this could wind up being something you own for 10 years and the dividend keeps going up so you wind up with like a 10 15% yield on your basis and you double your money on top of it uh that&#39;s what I like to do cha-ching cha-ching uh Advanced Auto Parts everyone&#39;s you know bitching about the earnings and whining uh they&#39;re doing exactly what they said they were going to do Shane o Kelly came from HD Supply ran a$ 7 Billion Dollar business for Home Depot betting on the jockey here they&#39;re selling all the unprofitable stores on the west coast that are too far spaced out and they have no competitive Advantage they investing it all in the concentrated areas in the Northeast that they own they&#39;re you know Hub and spoke model this will be no different take a few years and uh you know this from these levels I mean I think this is triple from these levels it&#39;s probably 24 36 months again look all this is opinion not advice uh go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms uh w\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  Energy natural gas there we go so what we look is at is the commitments of Traders positioning and we want to generally be on the opposite side of the large Traders and hedge funds and we want to be in line with the commercials when the commercials are buyers uh price tends to follow right now commercials are in fact buyers it doesn&#39;t always work but it works a lot of the time at inflection point so our inclination is to be more constructive on energy but we are in no rush to do it\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  from fund Strat so they had a similar chart with small caps showing this they&#39;re making the case that we&#39;ve had a lot of these 5 to s% pullbacks in momentum and then they bounce back it could be the case um so you know just be open-minded to that that would make sense if the indices are going to rebound a little bit in March uh but for the long-term gains you want to start to be moving away from the crowd and skating to where the puck is going to be not where it&#39;s already been in the rear view mirror\n\nhere&#39;s the antithesis so they&#39;re making the case why this time is different which is a dangerous case to make which is better returns for semis versus CC&#39;s so CC&#39;s were just investing at a loss because they could get unlimited free money during the uh uh late 90s today the semis are actually generating a return on invested Capital lower leverage risk for semis versus clecs CC&#39;s were 10 times as expensive as today&#39;s semis clecs burn cash semis generate cash so uh again that&#39;s why we&#39;re of the view that we&#39;re not going to see a tech wreck we&#39;re going to see a tech sideways consolidation to absorb the gains of you know paying for what is going to happen happen five seven nine years out today um you&#39;ve already paid for it so now you got to absorb it to get a little closer to the event ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ninvestors eager for a pickup in China growth which of the following developments would you see as the most bullish for 2025 China growth accelerates opinion follows Trend gear to- dat performance in US dollar terms NASDAQ versus uh Hong Kong Shing high and you can just see the dramatic outperformance again on no one&#39;s bingo card at the end of last year on everyone&#39;s bingo card who are loyal listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes global data center power used by application so AI workloads are growing traditional workloads are also growing that is great for natural gas which is why we own Comstock resources side by side at nearly the same basis as Jerry Jones the guy who made his fortune in EN oil and gas and parlayed it into a a dynasty in the Dallas Cowboys which despite their performance is one of the most highly valued franchises in football history domestic investment is picking up after 10 years of uninvested so this is a positive trend for the companies that we look at productivity grew at an annualized pace of 2.8% during the tech boom versus 1.6% in the two decades after this is beginning to pick back up ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nlabor productivity you can see here we&#39;ve been consolidating for 18 years we&#39;re now breaking out and we&#39;re going to start to see massive productivity like we saw in the late 90s and in the early 2000s uh consumer sentiment has been weak on fear of tariffs and inflation and kind of the uncertainty of new volatility every day with a new announcement uh welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1 .0 new day new policy new tweet new volatility get over it if you don&#39;t know what you signed up for that&#39;s what that&#39;s what we got and I think that uh you got to break a few eggs to get an omelet so that&#39;s we&#39;re in the egg breaking process and I think we&#39;re going to get some beautiful big beautiful omelets come out of this uh University of Michigan inflation expectations through the roof y tariffs uh University of Michigan 5 to 10 year inflation expectations same thing tariffs if you look at the data you get the short-term bump intermediate term to long-term prices are actually lower because growth growth tends to slow as well that&#39;s also deflationary S&amp;P Global us manufacturing PMI actually turned up Dallas was uh terrible uh but Philadelphia was good so you&#39;re seeing mix but generally moving in the right direction mortgage rates are coming down now below 7% That&#39;s positive Stanley gen Etc City economic surprise index turning down so we got to keep an eye on this you did see a little bit of that in late 2023 when everyone was calling for a recession that never came so um be mindful but don&#39;t be paralized by it is is what I would say dollar rolling over part of our core thesis yields going down part of our core thesis um non-commercial selling in the hole which is why we&#39;re starting to get get more and more interested in oil and oil related stuff again here&#39;s the seasonal comp composite taken uh not back to 1929 but back to 1994 and here we are in February late February early March things pick up back up I think that is a good model to keep in mind so be ready in the first uh couple of weeks of March for things to look a lot better Doge effect Federal redundancies are uh are rising uh so you know this is a lot of layup we haven&#39;t seen that since 2022 e-commerce retail sales as a percentage of total sales hit a record high now almost 16 a half% that&#39;s bigger than during covid when everyone was locked down so that&#39;s a positive thing for things like Etsy uh and others like Baba uh biggest inflow to Europe in three years opinion follows Trend Japan CPI turning up which means what they have to continue to raise rate which means what the free money of the carry trade is over which means what force selling in mag 7 and passive indices that are overweight mag 7 Japan CPI there we go core inflation hits 19-month high in Japan keeping alive boj rate hike bets Alibaba straight up Alibaba daily return straight up hang sang relative to hangsang Tech dramatically outperform and that&#39;s what we had said uh probably a year ago on the podcast we said that uh when you know the hangsang doubles the key stocks will be up triple you know or quadruple and by the key stocks we mean the alibas etc etc and that&#39;s just begun short interest is still record high in China which means there&#39;s going to be a lot of forced buyers in coming months these these were core part of the thesis as we were laying it out when everyone was uh very negative on China and dollar rolling over I&#39;m sorry the um yuan is strengthening relative to the dollar which no one thought would happen and guess what China bond yields are going up two things that you see every cycle when Chinese equities take off here&#39;s India people couldn&#39;t get enough in 2024 at the peak uh now it&#39;s rolling over everyone&#39;s selling in the hole if you remember all the Articles record options record call options in India&#39;s history it was unbelievable they were like doing more options than the United States and they&#39;re like so so much smaller you know economy and markets by capitalization and those are all this hell taale signs and people this chart is actually let um um accelerated into it broke through on the downside if you remember we covered this last week it&#39;s actually broke below this so it&#39;s a whatever they call it a bearish pennant so keep an eye on that uh Insider transactions is actually at a level that&#39;s contrarian bullish we&#39;re actually even seeing it in Cooper standard insid or buying we&#39;re going to cover later in the podcast first time in a while here&#39;s the treasuries we&#39;ve been saying bonds up yields down here&#39;s the short interest these people are going to get Smokey smoked they haven&#39;t been this short since 2018 2014 right before monster rallies in bonds tequila is the only Spirit seeing sales growth in the US um diio has a lot of tequila and good good good tequila brands staples versus the market haven&#39;t seen this since 2000 early 2000s again another thing factor that is rhyming with our 2020 2001 to 2007 lot of similarities China outperform small caps value uh and Staples so pay attention to this uh this is an extreme opportunity here and uh we&#39;ve got some expression through hormell but we&#39;re going to find some others as well growth versus value in the last couple days growth rolling over value rallying this is from Thomas defasio uh the son of my friend had a chance to have lunch with them about a year ago and uh so hello to Bobby and Thomas Thomas is putting out the Russell 2000 back to support at the 200 day moving average not quite oversold but a bounce could be in play here soon we agree good work Thomas uh here&#39;s babo breaking out of the uh basing pattern here measured move would be from 60 to 120 takes us up first stop 180 and then I think we we consolidate before going even higher dollar rolling over as anticipated what do you think the\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nrolling over uh discretionary looks like it could potentially be ready for a bounce in coming weeks Staples might be a little overdone in terms of the defensiveness expectations for cuts are now going up people are pricing in slower growth with the tariffs uh and yields are coming down fed Cuts expectations going up uh here are some of the the mag 7 this was a couple of days ago these have look these are looking a lot worse now most of them are down about 20% Tesla maybe a little more Nvidia got hit a lot harder today uh February is the worst month of the year in postelection year second half of February all these stuff that you were ready for now has played out uh not a lot of debt but delinquencies are rising from low levels so again these are historic low levels of debt so yes you will see delinquencies but it&#39;s off a very very multi-decade historic low base Debt Service much less of a burden now um a lot of a lot of debt was locked in at very low rates consumer confidence a little bit grinding sideways we saw that actually right before uh the first Trump Administration I think you&#39;re going to start to see a re acceleration just like you did in Trump 1.0 uh here&#39;s the breakdown of the mag s from Mike zardi you can see this pennant actually broke down below the uh volume by price as well which implies it could see some more pain for those overweight stocks and which you know wouldn&#39;t be surprising but um we&#39;re not stepping in that&#39;s not our game we&#39;ve got what we love and uh and they&#39;re doing well I mean I can&#39;t tell you the amount of days that the market was getting smashed in February that our that our p&amp;l was positive it&#39;s I&#39;ve never seen anything like it it was just unbelievable uh mag 7 expecting Superior earnings growth THS is 493 but it&#39;s cutting in it&#39;s decelerating that&#39;s the big deal unmagnify is accelerating that&#39;s why these are going to outperform and those are going to underperform uh\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  diversification is paying off what&#39;s the top performing Rel uh year-to-date Equity return versus the US China followed by Spain Italy Germany Switzerland France Mexico Nordic Netherland UK Emerging Markets uh and uh Japan is actually doing worse everyone couldn&#39;t get enough Japan last year and the year before value underperformed growth in the post great financial crisis decade but it has been more mixed since then it is bottoming just like it did in the early 2000s why this was an aberration called zerp zero interest rate policy it was the only decade in a 100 years where you if you could buy a basket of stocks trading at 10 times sales and now perform the S&amp;P 500 any other decade you did that you&#39;d lose 80 to 90% of your money within 48 months um this will not happen again unless you think rates are going back down to zero then uh I wouldn&#39;t be playing that bet the name of the game is value is outperformed growth by 4.4% S uh since 1927 which basically means if you&#39;d put a million dollars up at that period and invested in value over uh growth you&#39;d have an extra 68 million of gains and that includes this operational 15 15year period where underperformed because of unnatural uh manufactured conditions of zero interest rate policy fed funds Target rate covered

TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nTech relative to the S&P 500 this is what they call a rounded top or a head and shoulders or whatever really is useless uh uh thing but worth noting I think on a relative basis okay it doesn't have to crash but on a relative basis I think we're going to see continued out performance this is not good if you're overweight in passive indices that are weighted to the um mag 7 or in the mag 7 names themselves this is not a positive development you want to see maybe it will be a fake out and then we get that rally in March uh which is fine but here's the positioning everyone is crowded to one side of the boat you can see it here we had a ton of data this week\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere is  Tech relative to the S&amp;P 500 this is what they call a rounded top or a head and

week\nhere is  the bond starting to Rally here&#39;s a reverse Head and Shoulders bottom which implies a massive rally like we saw in 2018 here&#39;s bearish sentiment uh this is the a aii percentage of bears we have only seen this two other times since 1986 both were at or near major three times major bottoms you saw this level of pessimism in the covid lows you saw this level of pessimism during the great financial crisis lows and you saw this level of pessimism during the early 90s recession which was caused by a banking crisis and if you remember the Orange County real estate crisis when the Japanese money all pulled out I will be interested to see what happens with Orange County real estate uh in the next few years as Chinese money stops flowing out of China and stays in China due to fear of loss as everything else starts to go back up in China uh and you see more and more price Cuts in Orange County could be very very interesting and what else do you have here vix we covered Richmond manufacturing was good somu at the state level we got to keep our eye on here possible signal of recessions uh this is probably somewhat skewed by Washington DC so we&#39;ll keep an eye on it cover 10 your buying years Bitcoin has also gotten shacked down to 85,000 uh that kind of qualifies in the speculative uh bucket that we talk about a lot so that&#39;s getting hurt um here&#39;s the bull bear spread again you saw this level of pessimism at the 2022 lows if you remember that&#39;s when we were buying uh Amazon and Google deep in the hole when no one wanted it quick doubles within it was like a year uh so I think there&#39;s going to be really incredible opportunities in the next few weeks to be able to benefit as well this is UN believable pessimism coming out uh TLT bonds starting to dramatically outperform S&amp;P 500 in line with our uh themes for the year that you all know uh it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s really exciting when you see all the pieces coming together as we had said uh in some of the foggy times I said hang in there when it comes it comes all at once and we are seeing that in Spades\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\npotential 1.5 trillion savings over 30 years from G p 1es i mean you speak about productivity if they get glps down to you know 10020 bucks a month which they already have generics uh and they continue to do do to do all the things every single insurance company is going to sponsor them people are going to get fit and healthy and it&#39;s going to save trillions of dollars of health care costs if this continues at the same pace which is pretty exciting uh fewer jobs expected in the next six months so a lot of pessimism and uncertainty that&#39;s normal Trump 1.0 uh manifesting in Trump 2.0 and the outcomes of 1.0 were very very good for the average worker uh minorities workingclass people did really well real wages did great uh conference board CEO confidence ticking up again this is what you saw in 2001 it&#39;s what you saw coming out of the great financial crisis off a very low basis this is actually very positive uh if I didn&#39;t mention yields going down let me just mention it one more time uh mortgage rates going down that&#39;s good China to start bank recapitalizations with at least $55 billion M2 money supply in China turning up this is a big precursor to massive expansion [Music] um Magnificent Seven slides into correction territory the basket is down well over 10% now Tesla is down from almost $480 down to 300 so it took its post-election rally back uh at least 60% of it back and uh we&#39;ll see how that plays out growth versus value growth is getting shellacked I think this trend is going to persist value is going to be performing lots of money going to be made in value the right value not not value traps but um companies with growth with cash flow growing turning around that type of stuff US stocks are now lagging the rest of the world uh here&#39;s the news cor story count for firings job cuts and layoffs I haven&#39;t seen this record since late 2022 that was a massive buying opportunity uh analysts are raising European earnings estimates Microsoft data center leases are slowing analysts say raising investor attention about demand for nvidia&#39;s products is basically what it comes down to um again after the aii bull bear belows Falls below -4 where it is right now one week later the Market&#39;s down on average 1% two weeks later it&#39;s up 14 basis points a month later it&#39;s up 2% two months later on average it&#39;s up almost 5% 3 months later 6% 6 months later 13.7 9 months later it&#39;s up 19% and one year later it&#39;s up 22% so this level of pessimism May in fact prove to be a very positive thing once the Bottom&#39;s in cycle composite this is where we are right now expect more rocking into early February and then straight up from there so a lot of things pointing to the same outcome most stocks are trading this from Seth uh golden most stocks are trading at their lowest correlation to the index or each other than at any time since 2021 which dampens the index ability to break out and or move with any meaningful momentum it&#39;s a stock Pickers Market folks this does not support double digigit returns in 2025 we tend to agree you know I think the S&amp;P is going to be as we said uh fourth quarter last year it&#39;s going to be like a 7 to 9% year S&amp;P 500 and um and I think absolute unbelievable fortunes are going to be made under the surface for people positioned in the right way and in the ways that uh we&#39;ve been talking about for many weeks and months bull markets in the S&amp;P 500 1957 to date uh what you&#39;re seeing here again is the average gain is 145% in 52 weeks we are only at 71% in 28 weeks which means there&#39;s a lot of Runway left we agree as a reminder growth versus value this ladies and gentlemen zerp right here where growth outperform value that is the exception this ladies and gentlemen the red where value outperforms growth is the rule okay 4% 4.4% compounded since the late 20s if you get positioned on the right side of the boat ahead of the crowd fortunes will be made and are already being made ladies and gentlemen wink wink uh you know all you guys with eating your bananas sideways know what I&#39;m talking about uh US dollar Index I like this cycle index on Twitter I don&#39;t know who this is Jason P um I think this is correct the these things run in cycles and you can see here what is it I don&#39;t know what this is probably an 11year cycle or something like that they&#39;re not perfect but they&#39;re always worth noting uh cover that initial claims in Washington the highest since 2023 also is ticking up Nationwide so worth keeping your eye on that is

      "Trump suggesting he could prevent investment in Chinese AI companies do you worry about Alibaba being D listed or potentially becoming completely restricted investment like Russian adrs uh China&#39;s too big of an economy for him to do that but yes I worry about everything all day long that&#39;s what my clients pay me to do is worry non-stop so they can just make money and go out and golf and go to the beach and enjoy life because they deserve it because they built incredible businesses or real estate investment portfolios or whatever they did they pay me to stay up and worry about it and that&#39;s why like if I had my brothers Alibaba would be 100% of the portfolio I would never do that because we have I we have position limits and we maxed out our position limit which is much lower than 100% that&#39;s why we own 8 10 12 companies why because there can always be something that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know but our two filter criteria is number one if anyone positioned in the portfolio went to zero would they take us out on a stretcher the answer is no and number two is would the remaining positions 9 10 position be enough to still outperform and reach our IR hurdle and the answer is yes so yeah that&#39;s always a risk and that&#39;s why it was trading at such a discount you don&#39;t know anything that anyone else isn&#39;t thinking about the key is is the dynamic has changed it&#39;s gone from an Administration that uh uh was everything about China is wrong let&#39;s not communicate to Let&#39;s Make a Deal pay me I mean that&#39;s all Trump wants pay me pay do a deal for the US consumers where we&#39;re either getting tariffs or we&#39;re getting advantages that we didn&#39;t have and if you help us make money uh the door is open and if you screw with us then we will take you down and the the direction it&#39;s going is let&#39;s make money together and that&#39;s what you saw so um I think that could could be a negotiating chip but I think that&#39;s in the rearview mirror people have been worried about adrs since net e in 2000 every two years when the Market&#39;s down people worry about delisting when the Market&#39;s up no one cares and it just keeps happening over and over and over so maybe one day that will change but that&#39;s how you manage your risk you can never be 100% certain about anything but you play your odds when you&#39;re buying tremendous amount of value for low amount of price uh good things happen over time when they&#39;re good assets and that&#39;s what we continue to do and why we do it in more than one company is because uh anything is possible and um and that&#39;s how you hedge against it by sizing",

      "same thing here here&#39;s what Robert sler has to say about Alibaba continues to carve out longer term bot pattern after rallying 80% from its January low Baba is likely to start to pause uh just under its 38% retracement level near $157 first support is near $1 120 followed by 105 yeah I think we&#39;re going back to 120 um I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going back to 105 but I could definitely see this this huge base breakout back test and then straight up uh and probably next stop after that would be 188 or 219 uh and um welcome to the party ladies and gentlemen early days but uh if you get a move back to the low 120s and you don&#39;t have enough stock that&#39;s probably where I&#39;d buy it uh can I guarantee we&#39;re going to go back down to 120 before we take off no it might take off you know as I said uh when we were down in the 70s and 80s I said when this thing moves it&#39;s not going to let anyone in and it absolutely didn&#39;t I mean straight up 80% uh in a blink you know matter of weeks and everyone top ticking it at 140 so probably got to wipe out some of those weak sisters before we go to 200",
      "what you get you&#39;re getting good multiples for good growth and that&#39;s why alibaba&#39;s up 80% uh that&#39;s why so many other value stocks we&#39;re starting to see take off here&#39;s again carry trade on wine what&#39;s what&#39;s happening it&#39;s moving right back down to those levels that we saw share of spending by income group uh top 10% of earners now account for half of spending you know this is this is not news it&#39;s certainly elevated a little bit but but um what you see is under Trump one is started to normalize and I think under Trump two it&#39;s going to normalize the lower strata did on a relative basis the Improvement for the lower strata under Trump one was orders of magnitude greater than it was for the higher strata and I think we&#39;re going to start to see that initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits in Washington DC so they are gutting uh the public sector uh that is deflationary apartment deliveries this is kind of fascinating so there was kind of a glut and that&#39;s you know the cure for high prices is um they saying Commodities SEC cure for high prices high it&#39;s high prices um and they glutted the market so now the deliveries are so that will create the setting for a shortage some years out mind the gap performance here&#39;s hang sang Tech dramatically outperforming the NASDAQ 100 on no one&#39;s else&#39;s bingo card except the listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes my awesome awesome uh group here that I&#39;m so grateful to do every week for you uh percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 outperform in the index so this is starting to pick back up same as it did in 2001 what happened 2001 to 2007 again small caps Emerging Markets value dramatically outperformed the regime change is here it&#39;s already happened and it&#39;s going to continue to happen for at least the next handful of years this bull market might be two but is still young so for everyone looking for the exits yeah you should be you should have been looking for the exits if you were in the wrong stocks if you were in the right stocks and um paying attention to Value versus price and not chasing shiny objects you&#39;re you&#39;re happier than a hyena but if you&#39;re in the wrong stocks and you&#39;re saying I got to get out of everything keep in mind the average bull market uh is still young the average age of a bull market is 5.5 years we&#39;ve only been going 2.4 years the average gain is 196% 191% and we&#39;re only up 71% short Ines for the typical stock remains low versus history when&#39;s the last time you saw this low 2001 what happened the next five years International small caps value uh all the stuff we love and China uh higher January and February could mean the bull continues State data from Ryan Dietrich over at Carson he also has some data here talking about uh Mondays and Fridays being terrible in 2025 so there you go announced BuyBacks as you can see it&#39;s shifting it used to be all Tech but they&#39;re now uh spending that money aggressively and defensively on AI and uh that&#39;s hurting their margins it&#39;s decelerating their earnings growth it&#39;s decelerating their return on invested capital and it&#39;s limiting their ability to buy back shares which was a huge driver of eps growth for many many years during Zur from 2010 uh till recently now financials are starting to lead the BuyBacks Healthcare is starting to lead the BuyBacks Industrials Etc so pay close attention regime change intact [Music] um history of stock market returns can often be determined by whether or not the vix is above 1950 historically the vast majority of S&P gains comes when vix is under this level uh so that is from uh Seth golden price to sales for S&P 500 again this is super elevated and largely because of the concentration of the mag 7 it&#39;s why we continued to say if you got to be in an index move to equal weight move move away from overweight mag 7 and all of them are down now some you know 17 to 20 something percent some even more um uh and maybe we get a bounce here for sure uh I wouldn&#39;t be worried about that but I think the underperformance theme is going to continue if they&#39;re not going to crash like 2000 which I believe they are not uh they are going to consolidate and given the gains that they&#39;ve had the consolidation might be a lot more and longer than most people think until they change the index waiting which S&P always does uh then the indices will start to outperform and these stock will be a much lower waiting uh in the meantime these type of extremes you do not want to be on that side of a crowded boat that is how you drown so uh",
