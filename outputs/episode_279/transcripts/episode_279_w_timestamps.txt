[257.239s] stuff first we&#39;re going to get to the
[258.479s] media want to
[260.6s] thank Jack rean and Jake Mack over at
[264.28s] the clay and countdown for having me on
[266.919s] with Taylor rigs who&#39;s just awesome
[270.24s] to talk about my favorite subject in the
[272.28s] whole world which is Aly uh well as I
[275.759s] say with well uh as I say with my uh
[280.56s] Round Table of friends Ali effing Baba
[284.88s] uh so uh for those of you who&#39;ve been
[286.919s] around I I am justified in saying that
[289.639s] it has been an unbelievable run here uh
[292.68s] and just getting started and I want to
[294.8s] emphasize this is super duper important
[297.4s] because the first thing that I&#39;ve had
[298.919s] everyone&#39;s all so excited smiling so
[301.68s] wide we can eat a banana sideways you
[304.16s] know there&#39;s nothing like being up huge
[305.72s] on a day when the market is crashing and
[308.72s] um and they&#39;re all like should we sell
[310.0s] some no okay this is the same cognitive
[314.8s] bias that people have that like um no
[320.4s] this is where you get paid ladies and
[322.68s] gentlemen and we haven&#39;t even started to
[325.039s] get paid we talked about intrinsic value
[327.68s] over the last year and a half two years
[330.16s] when we were buying every single dip
[332.639s] backing up the truck in the 60s okay
[335.96s] just as the stock price vacillates
[339.759s] around the cash flow and the intrinsic
[343.039s] value of the business which was steady
[345.199s] and improving over that time period when
[347.4s] the stock was in the gutter on Headline
[349.72s] noise it overshoots in price relative to
[354.639s] intrinsic value on the downside it is
[358.039s] going to dramatically overshoot in price
[362.52s] on the
[363.919s] upside when this thing gets going so you
[367.199s] think oh well now you know it&#39;s going up
[369.68s] and we&#39;re 13 times earnings this thing
[372.24s] isn&#39;t even going to be near cooked until
[375.0s] we&#39;re over 20 times earnings and then by
[377.44s] then the fundamentals are going to be so
[379.4s] going so much better that they&#39;re going
[380.96s] to be all these analysts out there
[382.44s] chasing on a people naming their dogs
[384.72s] Alibaba and saying it&#39;s the best thing
[386.56s] since sliced bread the people that were
[388.039s] telling you to sell it in the hole at 60
[390.8s] uh this this game is just beginning so
[393.44s] let&#39;s hear what I had to say to Taylor a
[395.319s] couple days before earnings here we go
[398.12s] now Chinese president xiin ping linked
[400.28s] up with China&#39;s private sector Chiefs
[402.28s] today in Beijing where he stressed
[405.0s] continuity in the country&#39;s economic
[407.52s] development X met e-commerce giant
[410.12s] Alibaba CEO Jack ma who was at the
[412.759s] center of the Chinese government
[414.24s] Crackdown on the tech industry in recent
[416.8s] years my countdown closer like Alibaba
[420.639s] stock despite the company&#39;s past
[422.84s] regulatory boo boos and it is great Hill
[425.759s] Capital chairman Thomas Hayes who I&#39;m
[427.68s] pleased to say joins me now all right
[430.759s] make your case for
[432.72s] Alibaba well thank you Taylor great to
[434.96s] be with you look this wasn&#39;t the perfect
[437.24s] pick for us we&#39;ve been buying every
[439.4s] single dip for the last two years we
[441.879s] bought in the hundreds we backed up the
[444.16s] truck in the 60s so across all accounts
[446.8s] we at about $83 so it&#39;s had a huge run
[449.24s] in the the last 5 weeks uh up about 50%
[453.0s] let it rest a little bit they&#39;re going
[454.599s] to report earnings on the 20th maybe if
[456.919s] you get a pullback after earnings you
[458.68s] get a chance to to get in but this is a
[461.68s] very special company in terms of
[463.28s] valuation number one it&#39;s the number one
[465.639s] cloud provider in China it&#39;s also the
[468.56s] number one AI provider which we saw in
[470.96s] recent weeks with apple linking up stop
[473.8s] you there and ask you cuz I just spent
[475.879s] two hours with Kevin o on my earlier
[478.56s] show and he said this is in effect a
[481.28s] game changer I&#39;m those are my words not
[483.8s] his but the fact that you have an Apple
[486.0s] device in China using Alibaba AI shows
[490.68s] that there actually might be a
[491.96s] partnership between the US and China is
[494.4s] that better for apple or better for
[496.879s] Alibaba I think it&#39;s better for both
[499.199s] it&#39;s the best model they beat deep seek
[501.24s] on many metrics they beat open AI on any
[504.08s] many metrics and apple needs the
[506.599s] government approval in China and the
[508.639s] government is approving Alibaba then
[511.24s] that&#39;s just the icing on the cake let&#39;s
[513.0s] talk about the cake uh this is a huge
[515.519s] play on the middle class recovery uh
[518.32s] they were in lockdown for many many
[520.36s] years tbell and t-ball it&#39;s like being a
[522.719s] toll taker for the bridge every dollar
[525.24s] that the middle and upper class are
[526.48s] going to spend in this recovery is going
[528.08s] to go through Alibaba quite a few of
[530.279s] those dollars are going through Alibaba
[532.24s] and then finally we&#39;ve always said treat
[534.64s] Alibaba as a China AI ETF it&#39;s not just
[538.2s] the partnership with Apple
[540.079s] they have Equity stakes in many of the
[542.68s] AI startups in China because they give
[544.959s] them cloud computing service is it in
[547.24s] exchange for equity and a lot of people
[549.24s] don&#39;t know that oh and by the way their
[551.24s] international business e-commerce
[552.76s] business is growing at 40% on top of it
[555.2s] do you know Taylor you can buy this
[557.6s] stock at
[559.32s] 2014 prices the difference is revenue is
[563.0s] up 10x per share cash flow is up 6X per
[566.88s] share and earnings are up 6X per share
[569.0s] so at a 12 times forward multiple if it
[571.88s] if you just rate forget about growth
[574.279s] which they&#39;re going to have if you just
[575.88s] rate back to a normalized multiple 24
[579.16s] this thing some of the parts is worth
[580.68s] well over $200 and it&#39;s probably going
[583.36s] to take about two plus years to get that
[585.92s] get there in our view okay so need a
[587.959s] little bit of a longer timeline if you
[589.68s] want to hold on to the stock so brought
[592.04s] an out particularly with the US and and
[594.24s] mag 7 you still
[596.76s] bullish well you know when we came on
[599.0s] with you the beginning of January and I
[600.56s] love coming on with you Taylor we said
[602.72s] that uh maybe lien up on the mag 7 the
[605.8s] broadening is going to continue and what
[607.44s] do we have year to date we have S&amp;P up
[610.48s] 4% we have mag 7 Up only
[614.2s] 2% so uh what what have we seen we saw
[617.0s] the last Shelby first materials have
[618.839s] outperformed up 6.8% no you couldn&#39;t
[621.72s] give away materials the market was up 20
[623.68s] some odd perc last year materials were
[625.68s] basically flat Healthcare is up
[627.64s] 5.3% so we definitely have some picks in
[630.12s] those areas you got to look a little
[631.88s] more closely this year to get that out
[633.72s] performance than just buying the indic
[635.079s] seeson mag 7 the theme of the last few
[637.88s] years has been the US versus the rest of
[640.68s] the world do you expect that to continue
[643.24s] or do you start to like Emerging
[646.0s] Markets yeah that was a top of the Year
[648.44s] theme as well I I was uh privileged to
[651.519s] speak with you about that as well well
[653.279s] look what&#39;s happened this year Emerging
[655.0s] Markets is up 6.2% year to date uh
[658.72s] European Kean equities you would never
[661.0s] guess this at the beginning of the year
[662.279s] Taylor up
[663.839s] 10.6% relative to the S&amp;P 500 up 4% this
[667.76s] is a theme that is a regular theme but
[669.92s] we&#39;re all stuck in recency bias we think
[671.72s] US stocks are going to outperform
[672.959s] Forever every 10 to 15 years you get
[675.279s] huge periods of five 10 years of
[677.839s] outperformance of international stocks
[679.8s] you had it in the Reagan Administration
[682.04s] I think you&#39;re going to see it in the
[683.04s] Trump Administration as well as the
[684.92s] dollar weakens and yields come under
[687.079s] control so uh we love that and Alibaba
[690.16s] is one way we&#39;re doing it just quickly
[692.0s] here to end can the S&amp;P or Equity
[695.48s] markets continue to Rally if we&#39;re
[697.12s] looking at a four and a half maybe 5% on
[699.36s] the
[700.959s] 10e yeah I think uh bonds are the second
[704.399s] most crowded trade be behind the mag 7 I
[707.04s] think we&#39;re going to see a 4% on the
[709.839s] 10year before we see 5% I know that&#39;s
[712.399s] unconventional but as you know by now
[714.36s] I&#39;m pretty unconventional uh and that
[716.639s] will enable us you know the market looks
[718.6s] like it wants to breakout here but
[720.0s] February tends to be a choppy period I
[721.639s] think we will get to New Highs but I
[723.72s] think the index returns for the year are
[725.399s] going to be a bit subdued 8 to 12% and
[727.92s] find your opportunities elsewhere in the
[729.92s] broadening well Tom Hayes we always
[731.76s] appreciate you coming on thank you thank
[734.44s] you
[736.04s] meanwhile and we&#39;re back and then I had
[739.519s] the pleasure to talk to steu vanney
[741.959s] thanks to Jack guys thanks to Christian
[745.519s] dagger and Preston myel for having me on
[748.32s] we&#39;re going to tune in here here want to
[749.959s] get back to the markets yeah I&#39;ve got to
[751.88s] tell you there&#39;s not that much price
[753.16s] movement going on is it Dows off what 30
[756.079s] S&amp;P off six NASDAQ up four that&#39;s not
[758.639s] much movement so let&#39;s bring in uh we&#39;ve
[761.72s] got to with us this morning Thomas uh
[763.56s] Tom Hayes sorry miss your name right Tom
[766.56s] Hayes all right I&#39;m looking for some
[768.519s] positives here I&#39;m trying to think that
[770.76s] maybe what doge is doing with cutting
[773.959s] government spending and getting into the
[775.8s] fraud and waste and what they&#39;re doing
[778.04s] in Saudi Arabia the US and Russia
[780.72s] getting together for peace talks over
[782.36s] Ukraine I&#39;m trying to think that that
[784.36s] may be a positive for the market what
[786.92s] say
[787.8s] you there&#39;s no question about it Stu I
[790.36s] think you hit the nail on the head with
[791.639s] Doge uh this is underrated and I think
[794.519s] the biggest surprise of this year is
[797.36s] that the 10-year treasury yield is going
[800.04s] to 4% before it goes to 5% and the
[803.6s] reason being is because doge is going to
[806.079s] continue to cut cut government spending
[808.68s] there&#39;s going to be a lot of layoffs
[810.36s] which is deflationary which may not be
[813.079s] absorbed into the public sector as
[814.839s] quickly as people think because the
[816.68s] skills or lack thereof may not be
[819.76s] transferable uh so as rates come down
[822.76s] it&#39;s going to open up the opportunity
[824.24s] for a lot of these underperforming
[826.399s] sectors in the market the second thing
[828.24s] that&#39;s been really positive to is
[829.839s] earnings have blown out of the water
[832.839s] 16.9% earnings growth compared to just
[835.759s] 9% estimates uh for this quarter with 70
[839.24s] 7% reported so a lot of good things
[841.6s] happen why is the market a little bit
[843.04s] uncertain because we&#39;re in sandbagger
[845.6s] season which is when they take down
[847.8s] guidance so that they can beat for the
[849.48s] rest of the Year this is a normal
[851.36s] seasonal occurrence we&#39;ve taken down
[853.519s] guidance in the last few weeks the
[854.839s] markets a little bit nervous we&#39;re in
[856.44s] that kind of mid-February slump uh but
[859.079s] it it feels like the market wants to
[861.079s] break to new highs too very interesting
[863.519s] the market wants to go up I love those
[865.639s] words Tom Hayes thanks for joining us
[867.639s] I&#39;m sorry so short it&#39;s a big news
[869.12s] Tuesday we&#39;ll see you again soon Tom
[870.8s] thanks so
[873.04s] much and we&#39;re back I am trademarking
[877.199s] the word sandbagger season which we just
[879.92s] got through we&#39;re going to talk about
[881.32s] some sandbagging later in this podcast
[884.199s] and then finally got to join my friend
[886.04s] Kenny pocari on his new show on Yahoo
[889.12s] called Trader talk Talking tariffs this
[891.759s] was a great theme that we&#39;ve emphasized
[893.68s] over and over that has been playing out
[896.759s] uh like according to Playbook the stuff
[899.68s] that we had said in the fourth quarter
[901.759s] was going to take place this year and
[904.36s] the huge switch uh has happened the
[907.36s] regime change is in play take a listen
[912.13s] [Music]
[915.68s] here welcome to Trader talk where we
[918.0s] serve up the latest buzz from Wall
[919.759s] Street helping you keep your portfolio
[921.72s] sizzling without getting burned I&#39;m your
[924.04s] host Kenny poye broadcasting live from
[926.759s] the iconic New York Stock Exchange the
[929.0s] heartbeat of capitalism and after
[931.04s] decades here as an Institutional stock
[933.199s] broker it feels incredible for me to be
[936.12s] back home again this place still gives
[938.199s] me a thrill and while it&#39;s evolved and
[940.279s] modernized over the years the New York
[942.36s] Stock Exchange remains a Cornerstone of
[944.04s] capitalism entrepreneurship and above
[946.72s] all Freedom that&#39;s woven into the very
[949.48s] fabric of our nation&#39;s history
[951.959s] terrorists aren&#39;t the problem investor
[954.8s] Panic is every time tariffs hit the
[957.199s] headlines the market throws a Fed stock
[959.199s] dive the media screams trade war and
[961.04s] investors act like it&#39;s 2008 all over
[963.319s] again but let&#39;s just take a step back
[966.16s] are tariffs really the disaster that
[968.04s] they&#39;re made out to be tariffs are taxes
[970.519s] imposed on imported goods to regulate
[973.0s] trade protect domestic Industries and
[975.319s] generate government revenue while they
[977.519s] can be beneficial in some cases they can
[980.04s] also have some downsides so here&#39;s a
[981.68s] breakdown of the pros and the cons of
[984.12s] tariffs so one it protects domestic
[987.04s] Industries it encourages local produ
[988.92s] production it supports domestic jobs it
[991.72s] increases government revenues money from
[994.04s] tariffs can be used for infrastructure
[996.16s] health care and even National Defense or
[998.88s] paying down the national debt it
[1001.079s] encourages domestic consumption it
[1003.399s] limits foreign dependence it strengthens
[1006.24s] National Security and protects critical
[1008.959s] Industries it reduces overall Reliance
[1011.519s] on Rival Nations I.E China trade
[1014.319s] tensions it encourages Fair Trade
[1016.639s] Practices leverages trade negotiations
[1019.199s] and can countries can use tariffs as a
[1021.68s] bargaining tool in trade agreements I.E
[1025.079s] the NAFTA renegotiation into usmca look
[1028.48s] at what&#39;s happening right now the
[1029.919s] knee-jerk reaction was ridiculous stocks
[1032.6s] tanked volatility spiked and algorithms
[1035.28s] panicked but none of it was a surprise
[1037.319s] at all I just think markets were betting
[1039.799s] on an 11th Hour deal that didn&#39;t happen
[1043.319s] but what happens when the dust settles
[1045.439s] Executives adjust trade deals get
[1047.48s] renegotiated and invest realize that the
[1049.88s] world is not ending those who stay calm
[1053.4s] and position themselves accordingly will
[1055.64s] usually win the real problem isn&#39;t
[1058.0s] tariffs it&#39;s how investors react to them
[1060.84s] if you&#39;re dumping stocks because of
[1062.24s] tariffs you&#39;re doing it all wrong if
[1064.0s] anything tariffs create an opportunity
[1066.799s] they expose which companies have pricing
[1068.64s] power which sectors can pass cost to
[1070.559s] Consumers and which ones are too fragile
[1072.72s] to survive the ones that weather the
[1074.799s] storm they become Market leaders so what
[1078.2s] should investors do instead of running
[1080.4s] for the exits pay attention to where the
[1083.2s] money is moving look at companies with
[1085.559s] strong balance sheets pricing power and
[1087.64s] diversified Supply chains watch how the
[1090.28s] industry shift this is where real
[1092.799s] opportunity is found not in panic
[1094.919s] selling but in smart positioning the
[1097.52s] bottom line tariffs are not the end of
[1099.76s] the world but emotional trading that&#39;s
[1102.039s] what really kills your returns now my

[1151.76s] thanks so much for having thank you for
[1152.96s] coming in from California these days
[1154.6s] yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so look
[1156.679s] there&#39;s been a lot happening in the
[1157.799s] markets right so the Market&#39;s been very
[1159.64s] volatile we&#39;ve been talking about not
[1161.08s] only this new presidency but new
[1162.52s] policies but the tus so talk to me just
[1164.96s] on on long short strategies kind of what
[1167.84s] you&#39;re thinking about when when you
[1168.88s] think about the markets and and how to
[1171.0s] position yourself yeah this is a
[1172.52s] question that we get regularly um this
[1174.72s] reminds me a lot of 2016 to 2007 what
[1177.679s] happened right after the election was
[1179.72s] entirely different than what happened
[1181.32s] after the inauguration after the
[1182.76s] election yields blew out the dollar went
[1185.24s] straight up uh Tech went down Emerging
[1188.12s] Markets went down International went
[1189.799s] down after the inauguration things
[1191.679s] normalized Tech went back up yields came
[1194.72s] down the dollar came down and you know
[1196.48s] what international and Emerging Markets
[1198.88s] outperformed in 2017 these were some
[1201.48s] surprises so why do you think that was
[1203.28s] why do you think Emerging Markets
[1205.159s] outperformed well I I think that it&#39;s
[1208.679s] it&#39;s a fear of the unknown okay this is
[1212.2s] the big thing and this creates
[1213.84s] opportunities like you said in in
[1215.4s] earlier in the segment dislocation is
[1218.76s] where you find outperformance so when
[1221.36s] people sell off due to irr respon you
[1223.6s] know it&#39;s funny I had a question we have
[1224.919s] this little company it&#39;s called Cooper
[1226.44s] standard and they manufacture Auto par s
[1228.919s] they do the ceiling systems around the
[1231.039s] uh the windows they do the fluid
[1233.0s] transfer systems and where do they
[1234.32s] manufacture they manufacture a lot in
[1235.96s] Canada they manufacture a lot in Mexico
[1238.36s] and everyone was worried is this going
[1239.64s] to hurt it I said look at the end of the
[1242.08s] day the average car on the road is 13
[1244.48s] years old okay there&#39;s going to be a
[1246.32s] refresh no matter what no one is going
[1248.48s] to put up a half a billion dollars to
[1250.4s] stand up a factory in Minnesota uh from
[1253.4s] scratch to to produce these parts that
[1256.6s] been produced for decades from this
[1258.0s] company that&#39;s leader in the business uh
[1260.559s] even even when you when you price in the
[1262.88s] effect of tariff so at at some point you
[1265.24s] have to step back when these stocks sell
[1267.36s] off because they have exposure to China
[1269.72s] or they have exposure to Mexico or they
[1271.48s] have exposure to Canada you say wait a
[1273.48s] second if if I look back at their free
[1275.559s] cash flow in revenues two years from now
[1277.52s] it&#39;s going to be a little blip on the
[1278.72s] radar it gets evened out right and and
[1280.799s] so I think that&#39;s a very that&#39;s a very
[1282.32s] key part but I think the other part of
[1284.12s] this whole conversation is these tariffs
[1286.24s] are only going to be imposed if mexic
[1288.76s] Canada didn&#39;t come to the table to help
[1290.44s] us with a problem that&#39;s got nothing to
[1292.72s] do with with with investing right you
[1295.159s] know it&#39;s interesting this version uh
[1297.2s] Trump 2.0 is more benign than Trump 1.0
[1300.039s] Trump 1.0 was a legitimate trade War
[1302.52s] Trump 2.0 as hasset came out and said is
[1305.679s] actually about drugs and about illegal
[1308.159s] immigration and they and they put 10,000
[1310.44s] troops in and we said okay we&#39;re going
[1311.76s] to back off you keep the troops there
[1313.559s] probably were going to be okay right so
[1315.279s] I think the part that that caught me the
[1317.12s] other day when the markets actually had
[1318.72s] a nervous breakdown on the Monday that
[1321.6s] it wasn&#39;t like he hadn&#39;t been talking
[1323.279s] about it he talked about it for seven
[1324.88s] months during the year he talked about
[1326.32s] it before the inauguration talking about
[1327.679s] it after the inauguration he put them
[1329.559s] all on on alert that this was coming if
[1332.52s] they didn&#39;t come to the table and have
[1333.76s] this conversation nothing about nothing
[1335.96s] about trade Wars really but it was about
[1337.76s] helping us out at the border and
[1339.32s] stopping the flow and stopping the drugs
[1341.44s] right and so and so I think the market
[1344.4s] was expecting an 11th Hour deal and they
[1346.88s] didn&#39;t get it and so on that Monday you
[1348.36s] know they all had a panic attack and
[1349.679s] then suddenly Mexico comes to the table
[1351.159s] and says okay okay we&#39;re going to help
[1352.6s] and then he backs right off right so I
[1354.559s] think it I think it is a negotiating
[1356.12s] tactic 100% this is the most telegraphed
[1358.84s] surprise in history you know we say buy
[1361.12s] the rumor sell the news this was sell
[1362.36s] the rumor buy the news no question about
[1364.96s] it yeah no 100% but tell me now about
[1367.279s] he&#39;s talking about over the weekend he
[1369.4s] talked about imposing tariffs on China
[1371.44s] which have started now reciprocal
[1373.279s] tariffs I think that&#39;s really aimed at
[1375.039s] Europe reciprocal tariffs right correct
[1377.039s] correct uh I think think look China is
[1380.44s] doing the exact same thing that they did
[1382.08s] in 2016 right after the election which
[1384.76s] is they devalued the yuan in
[1387.24s] anticipation of the tariffs right so
[1389.2s] what he&#39;s put into place is actually a
[1390.799s] net zero because because they devalued
[1393.2s] the Yuan now that the tariffs are in
[1395.159s] place that you&#39;ve seen the Yuan stop
[1396.84s] going down it&#39;s starting to appreciate
[1398.64s] relative to the dollar so that&#39;s that&#39;s
[1400.919s] kind of priced in and if you look at
[1402.48s] pricing people say it&#39;s going to be
[1403.799s] inflationary okay and people go go crazy
[1406.32s] in the short term for you know first
[1408.08s] couple months or whatever maybe you see
[1410.4s] something intermediate term it&#39;s net
[1412.799s] neutral and long term it&#39;s actually
[1414.32s] you&#39;ve seen in the case of washing
[1415.799s] machines and stuff prices actually go
[1417.48s] lower right but you know what&#39;s
[1418.84s] interesting is that is that it&#39;s a one
[1421.039s] if it&#39;s inflationary at all it&#39;s a
[1422.799s] one-time inflationary bump because it
[1424.32s] just adds a fixed cost to the price and
[1426.24s] then doesn&#39;t keep going up that&#39;s
[1427.72s] correct right doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not like it&#39;s
[1429.12s] a 9% inflation every you know every time
[1431.08s] you turn around it goes up once and then
[1432.799s] it adjusts right but but to your point
[1435.0s] then once it all settles in it seems to
[1437.12s] find its level yeah and you have look
[1439.279s] you have Doge which is actually taking
[1441.64s] costs out of the system which is
[1443.88s] deflationary by by Nature uh there a lot
[1446.679s] of different offsets that are coming
[1448.36s] that people are not pricing into the
[1450.679s] potential risk of inflation of tariffs
[1452.88s] and and I think you&#39;re going to see that
[1454.6s] it uh it it more than net washes and
[1457.039s] you&#39;re seeing it in bond yields by the
[1458.44s] way everyone was pushing look it&#39;s one
[1460.24s] of the two two most crowded trades right
[1461.96s] now what are it short bonds I&#39;d take the
[1464.08s] other side and long mag s which I think
[1466.6s] you got to start to moderate your view
[1468.44s] on Long mag s all right so talk about
[1470.44s] talk about why you want people why you
[1472.48s] think people should moderate their view
[1474.12s] on mag 7even because while I like the
[1476.12s] name and I like all the names and I own
[1477.96s] a lot of them I&#39;m not I&#39;m not chasing
[1479.88s] them up here at all right you got to go
[1481.96s] ahead so talk so I think you want to go
[1484.039s] where earnings growth is accelerating
[1487.36s] okay so last year earnings were the name
[1489.919s] of the game for the mag 7 okay they had
[1491.72s] 33% earnings growth which was double the
[1494.32s] market they should get double the
[1495.559s] multiple this year earnings growth is
[1498.0s] decent accelerating from 33% last year
[1500.279s] for the mag 7 down to 21% the multiple
[1503.48s] has not contracted in line with that
[1505.32s] decelerating and earnings growth rest of
[1507.039s] the market had negative earnings growth
[1508.679s] the last uh first three quarters of last
[1510.32s] year it&#39;s now accelerating and the
[1512.24s] multiple is half of the mag 7 so okay so
[1515.24s] so let&#39;s talk about that for a minute so
[1516.799s] if the multiples in the mag 7 it&#39;s
[1518.679s] decelerating if earnings are
[1519.919s] decelerating earning growth is
[1521.2s] decelerating now you know but that&#39;s
[1523.2s] that&#39;s what your analysis tells you
[1524.48s] that&#39;s just what the that&#39;s is that what
[1525.799s] all the bottom up consensus estimates
[1528.159s] yeah so earnings grow is going to
[1529.76s] decelerate from 33% to 21% and we&#39;re
[1532.559s] seeing it it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of CBS
[1535.2s] and people say that this is this is
[1537.279s] offens there&#39;s some it&#39;s defensive right
[1540.12s] it&#39;s defensive cback because you have no
[1541.96s] return on invested Capital yet yet
[1545.32s] that&#39;s and that&#39;s the key so for the
[1546.6s] next two years they&#39;re going to spend a
[1547.76s] lot of money and we&#39;re going to find out
[1549.2s] in three to five years if they&#39;re going
[1550.399s] to get a return on that right but they
[1552.039s] and they&#39;ve made it very clear look at
[1553.24s] the last earning season they&#39;ve all made
[1554.559s] it very clear that they&#39;re spending huge
[1556.24s] amounts of money building out AI and
[1558.52s] data centers and all that stuff which I
[1560.24s] think is going to end up coming back but
[1562.12s] it might take three to five years before
[1563.919s] they really realize the return on that
[1565.88s] investment yeah this was the first
[1567.919s] quarter since
[1569.6s] 2022 that you had 0% Revenue surprises
[1573.679s] in the mag7 so we all know what happened
[1575.72s] in 2022 with tech it was a little bit
[1577.76s] softer than people expected everyone was
[1579.799s] euphoric going into it uh we also have
[1582.52s] the highest percentage of S&amp;P components
[1585.24s] trading over 10 times sales since 2000
[1589.159s] so there&#39;s there are a lot of multiples
[1590.96s] and a lot of metrics that point back to
[1593.039s] 2000 I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have
[1594.84s] anything like that at all but I do think
[1597.32s] we&#39;re going to have a relative slowdown
[1598.96s] in terms of uh you know those groups are
[1601.52s] going to have to consolidate their gains
[1603.2s] and and that&#39;s actually okay very
[1604.88s] healthy very healthy you can&#39;t keep you
[1606.919s] know trees don&#39;t go to the sky right
[1608.799s] 100% so they could they could
[1610.559s] underperform which which could imply the
[1612.52s] indices could be more subdued than last
[1614.36s] year maybe High single digits low double
[1616.44s] digits which also again over over
[1619.2s] historically would be fine but a lot of
[1620.88s] people look at the IND oh my God that&#39;s
[1622.399s] a failure we were only up 12% because
[1624.24s] the last two years were up 25 28% they
[1627.039s] look at plus 12% it&#39;s a failure yeah and
[1629.279s] what&#39;s so beautiful about that
[1630.52s] environment is that people are like oh
[1632.399s] man you know only 8 to 12% well under
[1634.6s] the surface you can make fortunes some
[1636.76s] of these companies that didn&#39;t perform
[1638.76s] last year because mag 7 took the air out
[1641.159s] of out of it and we started to see the
[1642.48s] rotation starting in July took a break
[1644.52s] in December big break in December kick
[1646.72s] back in in January February
[1648.88s] I think the other area you got to look
[1650.2s] at be besides uh UNM magnificent 493
[1653.799s] relative to magnificent 7 I think you
[1655.88s] got to start to look at small caps
[1657.159s] relative to large caps okay uh why
[1660.36s] because again earnings growth
[1663.32s] acceleration so if you look at S&amp;P 600
[1667.2s] small cap 8% earnings growth last year
[1669.679s] 21% earnings growth this year that&#39;s
[1671.48s] consensus 2 earning growth all consensus
[1673.72s] bottom up uh 15 times versus 22 times
[1677.12s] for for the indices that&#39;s interesting
[1678.519s] if you look at the Russell you go up to
[1680.36s] 55% earnings growth why because you had
[1682.2s] so many companies not earning any money
[1683.6s] and when you go from zero to 1 cent it&#39;s
[1685.799s] Infinity right right so explain that
[1687.48s] just so the audience understands when
[1688.76s] you say it&#39;s 15 times versus the markets
[1690.36s] a 22 times suggest that it&#39;s undervalued
[1692.64s] correct correct and mean meaning you can
[1694.679s] get more equivalent earnings growth for
[1697.32s] the for half the price correct okay so
[1699.64s] if the mag 7 is going to grow 21% down
[1701.64s] from 33 and small caps are going to grow
[1703.559s] 21% up from eight right and you&#39;re
[1705.679s] paying 15 for one and 33 for other well
[1708.24s] most people when they go to the store
[1709.559s] they want more for Less when they go to
[1711.36s] the stock market they say I want to I
[1713.039s] want to buy the most expensive thing
[1714.36s] ever you know W Street but then they
[1715.919s] Panic the minute the minute right they
[1717.72s] Panic right away I always say Wall
[1719.08s] Street is the only Market the only store
[1721.039s] in the world when they throw a clearance
[1722.399s] sale everyone runs out of the store and
[1724.0s] it&#39;s so funny because I always use like
[1725.519s] the bloomies analogy right when bloomies
[1727.799s] puts dresses on sale for 30% women run
[1730.32s] in there they got to buy three of them
[1731.559s] because how can you leave it on the
[1732.44s] Shelf but yet you get a name like apple
[1734.84s] or Amazon they sell off 15 or 18 or 20%
[1738.279s] and people are panicked oh my God I&#39;m
[1739.6s] going to lose all my money like are you
[1741.32s] nuts yeah I mean you&#39;re not talking
[1743.44s] about some Nano cap or or microcap
[1746.44s] you&#39;re talking about a mega cap stock
[1748.279s] corre Apple makes $124 billion every
[1750.96s] three months yeah am I missing something
[1753.32s] here yeah yeah yeah exactly but anyway
[1755.0s] so I think let because then I want to go
[1756.6s] on talk more about um uh your broader
[1758.96s] kind of view of the bond market all that
[1760.32s] stuff but let&#39;s just talk about this so
[1761.84s] when you talk about you know looking
[1764.08s] looking in other places like the last
[1766.679s] will be first I have say I have that
[1768.96s] same kind of view so tell the audience
[1770.799s] what you mean by that yeah so I think if
[1772.72s] you look at last year you look at two of
[1774.72s] the worst performing sectors uh you had
[1776.84s] Healthcare and you had materials lowest
[1778.559s] earnings growth lowest performance
[1780.48s] shocking right well this year they&#39;re
[1782.559s] going to be in the top four sectors the
[1785.32s] second and the fourth Healthcare and
[1786.76s] materials in terms of earnings growth
[1788.48s] 19% earnings growth and 17% earnings
[1790.72s] growth relative to the SNP overall 14%
[1793.559s] earnings growth in that neighborhood uh
[1795.799s] so I think we&#39;re going to see a lot of
[1797.12s] catch up from the these type of sectors
[1800.0s] that have high earnings growth low
[1801.44s] multiples and that&#39;s where you&#39;re going
[1802.799s] to see some outperformance right and
[1804.48s] these let&#39;s let&#39;s be honest though
[1805.76s] there&#39;s there&#39;s there are no names in
[1807.44s] either one of those sectors that&#39;s
[1808.48s] really sexy like you know Tech think
[1810.32s] about invid that right there&#39;s nothing
[1811.919s] in there that that screams you know I
[1814.2s] got to have you but when you think about
[1816.64s] where it&#39;s been last year with the end
[1818.64s] perform versus where it can be this year
[1820.44s] in terms of consensus estimates all this
[1822.2s] stuff there are some great opportunities
[1823.76s] in those sectors no question about it I
[1825.519s] mean one thing that one material stock
[1827.76s] and you got to look at boring ones Alba
[1829.559s] Maro okay the lithium top lithium
[1832.159s] producer lithium prices are cyclical
[1834.96s] okay Alba Maro always comes through
[1836.76s] they&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity
[1839.0s] they&#39;re taking tons of costs out of the
[1840.48s] business all of them are lowering their
[1842.279s] production and by the way we all all
[1844.36s] think of EVs and we say oh no one wants
[1846.08s] EVS anymore in the US well the global
[1848.399s] stock is going to go it&#39;s it&#39;s 100%
[1850.519s] China story because it&#39;s government
[1851.799s] subsidized it&#39;s going from 40 million to
[1853.96s] 120 million uh by 2027 all driven by
[1857.24s] China they&#39;re going to need the lithium
[1858.799s] and lithium uses are are even Beyond EVS
[1861.399s] so Alam Maro is a leader it&#39;s down
[1863.32s] materially it&#39;s got the liquidity it&#39;s
[1865.399s] going to it&#39;s going to rebound over the
[1866.559s] next two to three years not next two
[1868.279s] three minutes not next two to three
[1869.96s] weeks two to three years that&#39;s right so
[1871.76s] you have so you have to be you have to
[1873.24s] know that going in and you have to
[1874.76s] realize that you&#39;re going to put this
[1875.76s] money to work and it may take you a
[1877.32s] while to see it return but it&#39;s a great
[1879.639s] it&#39;s on sale so it needs you need toone
[1881.96s] when you can get D you know when you can
[1883.279s] get stocks down 50 60 70% that are high
[1885.72s] quality durable businesses through many
[1887.6s] cycles
[1888.72s] and you a dou in years that that is
[1891.12s] going to beat Market sing day the that&#39;s
[1893.12s] why they call me turn that&#39;s what I do
[1895.36s] for a living my man but I think that&#39;s
[1897.6s] absolutely right and that&#39;s what a lot
[1898.919s] of people Miss Right a lot of people
[1900.639s] well first of all you got a lot of
[1901.519s] people that just want they just want the
[1902.88s] names that move all the time right in
[1904.639s] the headlines the headin suck from in
[1906.24s] it&#39;s like a magnet that&#39;s right but if
[1907.559s] you&#39;re a long-term investor if you&#39;re a
[1909.44s] day trader that&#39;s fine that&#39;s all you
[1910.679s] want you&#39;re want chaos and you want all
[1912.039s] that stuff but if you&#39;re a long-term
[1913.76s] investor you really want to start to
[1915.519s] think long term and you want to think
[1917.6s] about opportunities and names that it
[1919.72s] might be boring yes but sometimes big
[1921.76s] and boring can be beautiful yes I&#39;m the
[1923.6s] captain of boring
[1925.72s] baby hold on one second let&#39;s just take
[1927.88s] a quick break and I&#39;m going to come back
[1929.32s] all right
[1930.86s] [Music]
[1934.919s] good okay so here we are we&#39;re back and
[1937.279s] I&#39;m here with Tom Hayes my good friend
[1939.0s] we&#39;ve had a very interesting
[1940.399s] conversation about the market but let&#39;s
[1941.88s] wrap it up with three essential Market
[1944.12s] tips just to keep in mind no matter
[1945.919s] which way the wind is blowing so number
[1947.679s] one you want to stay updated on policy
[1950.32s] and political developments right this
[1951.96s] week is going to make it a habit to keep
[1953.88s] a close eye on any of the policy updates
[1956.159s] or political events that could influence
[1958.48s] the market whether it&#39;s a new
[1959.88s] legislative proposal a congressional
[1961.519s] hearing or changes in regulatory stances
[1964.399s] these developments often send ripples
[1966.24s] through various sectors of the market I
[1968.559s] like to set aside sometime each morning
[1970.72s] to check the trusted new sources and
[1972.84s] government releases doing so not only
[1974.919s] helps you anticipate potential Market
[1976.519s] moves but also gives you the chance to
[1978.799s] adjust your positions if you need to and
[1981.48s] this week we&#39;re going to get you know uh
[1983.6s] uh JJ Powell is going to speak in front
[1985.039s] of Congress for the semiannual Humphrey
[1987.36s] Hawkins testimony which what may not be
[1989.2s] a market mover but there&#39;ll be lots of
[1990.919s] conversation around it number two be
[1992.919s] ready for sector rotation markets are
[1995.0s] Dynamic with money shifting from one
[1996.799s] sector to another as Tom and I discussed
[1999.44s] right um this week was a perfect example
[2001.88s] and when this happens use it to review
[2003.76s] sector performance and watch for signs
[2006.0s] that asset managers and investors
[2007.96s] rotating out of one sector while
[2010.36s] reallocating it to another now what I do
[2012.72s] when I sense that&#39;s happening is just
[2014.96s] allocate new Monies to those new sectors
[2017.679s] right I may trim it a little bit but I&#39;d
[2019.799s] rather keep the position I have built as
[2022.2s] long as the thesis remains intact for
[2024.76s] instance if economic data or political
[2026.399s] developments are favoring defensive
[2027.84s] sectors over growth oriented ones that&#39;s
[2030.36s] the cue for me to allocate new money to
[2033.12s] those sectors that will automatically
[2035.32s] rearrange the risk that I have in the
[2037.08s] portfolio
[2038.24s] uh without without me selling names that
[2040.559s] I really don&#39;t want to sell right
[2042.24s] leverage technical trigger point for
[2044.36s] timely action finally combine your
[2046.279s] fundamental insights with technical
[2047.96s] analysis as you monitor policy changes
[2050.56s] and sector shifts pay attention to the
[2053.04s] key technical trigger points like
[2054.919s] support and desist resistance trend
[2056.76s] lines moving averages crossovers
[2058.919s] relative strength readings that can
[2060.639s] signal a good moment to enter or exit a
[2063.599s] position especially if you&#39;re a shorter
[2065.52s] term investor and Trader even if you&#39;re
[2067.879s] a seasoned investor these technical cues
[2070.639s] are incredibly useful for timing your
[2072.8s] trades and more precisely uh for helping
[2075.04s] you manage right they act as your
[2076.76s] internal check ensuring that your
[2078.56s] decisions are based on both the broader
[2080.24s] economic picture as well as current
[2082.32s] price action so Tom talk just a little
[2084.679s] bit about for instance those technical
[2086.24s] indicators relative strength and all
[2088.0s] that stuff yeah look we we tend to be
[2090.359s] fundamentally uh focused however we do
[2093.24s] look at some of the extremes so just as
[2095.0s] we look at extreme in price relative to
[2097.04s] the underlying fals we look at extremes
[2099.28s] from some of the indicators you
[2100.359s] discussed moving average converges slow
[2102.839s] stastics uh relative strength all the
[2105.92s] standards is it at an extreme level
[2108.32s] where you tend to see some price
[2110.079s] recoveries and then do the fundamentals
[2112.28s] based on our view of fundamental
[2113.88s] analysis support that exactly right and
[2116.04s] I think and I think as a long-term
[2117.68s] investor you kind of have to play both
[2119.96s] those sides you have to have a
[2120.96s] fundamental view you got to do your
[2122.44s] homework and have a thesis on why you&#39;re
[2123.76s] buying it but then you should also that
[2125.64s] because that&#39;s how I do it right you
[2127.28s] kind of look at the charts and see if is
[2129.079s] it overbought maybe I&#39;m going to be a
[2130.359s] little more patient if I sense it&#39;s
[2131.96s] overbought the relative strength tells
[2133.359s] me you know it&#39;s overbought it&#39;s going
[2134.72s] to come back in so I&#39;ll be a little bit
[2136.0s] more patient it helps identify extremes
[2137.839s] and for a guy named turnaround Tom
[2139.56s] that&#39;s very very
[2141.44s] important every week I Feature A recipe
[2144.88s] that either tries to play into the theme
[2146.52s] of the week or is just a fan favorite of
[2149.2s] the guest this week when I asked Tom if
[2151.52s] he had a favorite dish he gave me
[2153.8s] nothing else V Parana which I love right
[2157.04s] so here it is it&#39;s a bit here&#39;s a bit of
[2158.96s] history for you um so if you like the
[2160.92s] recipe you can scan the QR code that&#39;s
[2162.599s] on the screen let me just give you a
[2164.24s] little bit of history on how this
[2165.359s] originate it comes from Southern Italy
[2167.4s] particularly from the sisly uh and
[2169.24s] Naples region of Italy we a similar dish
[2171.68s] called melanzana Al Parana which was
[2173.92s] eggplant par right it was very common in
[2176.72s] this dish they use slices of fried
[2178.44s] eggplant were layered with the tomato
[2180.359s] sauce and the cheese and the Mel in the
[2182.0s] parmesan and and and then it was baked
[2184.2s] in the oven ve was not a thing that they
[2186.8s] used due to high cost but then when the
[2190.04s] Italians immigrated and came to America
[2191.96s] an evolution happened they found out
[2194.079s] that ve was more readily available and
[2196.72s] affordable in America more so than it
[2199.16s] was back in the mother country so they
[2200.88s] replaced the eggplant with breaded and
[2202.64s] fried Vil cutet topping them with the
[2204.56s] tomato sauce the mozzarella paragan
[2206.319s] cheese this adaptation led to the birth
[2209.24s] of V Parana which quickly became a
[2212.16s] staple in an Italian American Cuisine so
[2215.319s] now Tom this was one of your favorites I
[2217.72s] love ve Paran but tell me a little bit
[2219.52s] why it&#39;s your favorite well look I grew
[2221.0s] up in New Jersey everyone loves ve
[2222.319s] parmesan I mean a lot of friends they
[2224.119s] like chicken parmesan chicken doesn&#39;t
[2226.16s] compare with ve if you prepare if you
[2228.079s] prepare the ve properly and you pound it
[2230.64s] long enough chicken can&#39;t hold a candle
[2233.68s] to it does although chicken is also
[2235.88s] chicken pot vagina is also be good on a
[2237.599s] hero but it&#39;s not I mean come
[2240.0s] on and if you serve the V Pana on a
[2242.92s] better spaghetti with the same marata
[2244.72s] sauce that you use to make it there&#39;s
[2246.839s] nothing better than that there&#39;s nothing
[2248.119s] I mean who who do you know who doesn&#39;t
[2249.64s] like v p we&#39;re going to have V pan
[2251.28s] tonight no no V poman for me I mean
[2254.48s] everyone loves V poman and when it&#39;s
[2256.28s] done right it&#39;s phenomenal and you share
[2258.079s] with family and it&#39;s great you
[2259.359s] absolutely do anyway listen Tom thank
[2260.96s] you very much for joining me I really
[2263.04s] appreciate this conversation I hope you
[2264.56s] come back and we&#39;ll do it again I&#39;d love
[2266.0s] too thanks so much all right
[2281.07s] [Music]
[2292.0s] and we&#39;re back quote of the week as
[2295.44s] Charlie Munger would say the best thing
[2297.88s] a human being can do is help another
[2299.8s] human being know more and uh you know
[2302.8s] it&#39;s funny some of these really
[2303.92s] successful people they go don&#39;t you
[2305.4s] worry about getting free ridden to the
[2307.64s] cows come home everyone just steals your
[2309.24s] ideas and makes money and blah blah blah
[2311.4s] and you know I get the joke and I do
[2313.48s] this to contribute back to people and to
[2315.839s] to make a difference in their lives and
[2317.52s] 99% of the people are going to free ride
[2319.48s] but you know what I find the more that I
[2321.64s] do this and the less I worry about that
[2324.079s] number one I&#39;ve never optimized for
[2325.8s] maximum AUM if I want to optimize for
[2328.119s] maximum AUM I guarantee you I would be
[2330.2s] win winning the race uh and we&#39;re doing
[2332.44s] just great um I&#39;ve always wanted to
[2336.52s] attract the type of people that I would
[2338.56s] enjoy hanging out with whether or not we
[2340.48s] did business and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s
[2342.28s] happened as a function of this podcast
[2344.52s] people tune in they listen they make
[2346.96s] money and then they call me and say I
[2348.56s] want to put the money with you I got
[2349.76s] better things to do I&#39;m already rich I
[2351.599s] want to run my business I want to go to
[2353.16s] the beach I want to go skiing you worry
[2355.44s] about it and uh and I&#39;ve been happy to
[2357.76s] do that and you know what I find is
[2360.0s] honestly the wealthier people are the
[2362.44s] more they don&#39;t want a free ride and
[2364.079s] that&#39;s why they got wealthy because
[2365.44s] they&#39;re accustomed to giving value I I
[2367.2s] was having this exact conversation with
[2369.68s] my daughter this week I said look if you
[2373.52s] want to get uh you know to get what you
[2378.16s] want all you need to do is help enough
[2379.839s] other people get what they want and you
[2381.359s] won&#39;t have to worry about a thing and
[2383.839s] the good people will do the right thing
[2385.319s] and the law of reciprocation will take
[2387.24s] in and and there will be plenty of
[2388.76s] people that don&#39;t and uh and their lives
[2390.64s] will reflected and that&#39;s fine we don&#39;t
[2392.319s] worry about that we worry about what we
[2394.079s] can control and what we can control is
[2395.76s] come and here every single week giving
[2397.88s] the greatest amount of value to the most
[2400.04s] amount of people primarily keeping our
[2402.76s] clients up to date on very important
[2404.52s] subject matters and letting everyone
[2406.28s] else benefit and they are underwriting
[2408.52s] this so if you ever see a very wealthy
[2411.76s] guy or girl walking around in a pair of
[2413.64s] green Vans because all my clients got
[2416.56s] Vans for Christmas uh walk up to them
[2419.72s] and shake their hand and say I&#39;ll bet
[2421.64s] you&#39;re one of great Hill capital&#39;s
[2423.119s] clients thank you so much the podcast
[2425.44s] has made a huge difference in my life
[2427.079s] and uh they are responsible for it as
[2429.319s] much as I am very very grateful Warren
[2431.88s] Buffett the stock market is a device for
[2433.72s] transferring money from the impatient to
[2436.92s] the patient that&#39;s what we do all day
[2438.48s] long here ladies and gentlemen go back
[2440.599s] and look at the previous tapes we&#39;ve got
[2442.48s] now five years of tapes pick a date
[2444.96s] listen in what were we talking about it
[2447.359s] plays out some of them played out
[2449.16s] immediately some of them took a few
[2450.88s] years but when your framework is correct
[2453.52s] and you do the work not just chase price
[2456.0s] Chase headlines Chase noise Chase Momo
[2458.68s] people but actually do the work and
[2461.2s] invest in a stock the way that you would
[2464.8s] underr investing in the whole business
[2468.119s] with 100% of your net worth and you take
[2470.48s] it that seriously great things happen
[2473.52s] when you buy high quality assets when
[2476.2s] they are temporarily marked down ladies
[2479.2s] and gentlemen and then you add the
[2480.64s] patience factor and that&#39;s what puts you
[2482.64s] ahead of the pack Peter Lynch investing
[2484.44s] without research is like playing stud
[2486.119s] poker and never looking at the cards and
[2488.64s] I&#39;m not talking about research like the
[2490.92s] the nonsense bs1 liners that you hear
[2493.76s] from a lot of commentators that think
[2496.04s] they&#39;ve done work on the stock but
[2497.4s] they&#39;re just ch chasing a price chart
[2499.48s] I&#39;m talking about really understanding
[2501.04s] the business doing the public filings
[2503.48s] doing the earnings calls Channel checks
[2506.8s] competition knowing what you own as if
[2510.48s] you own the whole company with 100% of
[2513.4s] your net worth moving on this is very
[2516.76s] important from Bruce
[2518.24s] ker through bitter experience I have
[2520.92s] learned that a mistake in position
[2523.079s] correlation is the root of some of the
[2525.359s] most serious problems in trading also in
[2528.0s] investing by the way if you have eight
[2530.28s] highly correlated positions then you are
[2532.88s] really trading one position that is
[2535.52s] eight times as large and so many people
[2538.64s] do this that are over their skis in Tech
[2542.079s] and mag 7 and are feeling that pain
[2544.8s] recently uh of underperformance that
[2547.4s] we&#39;re going to talk a lot about today
[2549.64s] and uh and in maybe some new ways that
[2551.72s] we haven&#39;t talked about before that set
[2553.359s] you up to avoid what&#39;s been taking place
[2555.76s] Warren Buffett I&#39;ll tell you how to
[2557.16s] become rich close the doors be fearful
[2559.92s] when others are greedy that doesn&#39;t just
[2562.599s] mean the General market that means
[2564.88s] specific companies that make zero sense
[2568.48s] on a valuation basis that people are
[2570.96s] chasing like lemons and getting getting
[2573.88s] ready to get their heads chopped off
[2575.8s] like chickens uh be greedy when others
[2579.44s] are fear fearful like all of you who&#39;ve
[2581.96s] been sending me all these incredible
[2583.52s] notes this week and I&#39;m very grateful
[2585.4s] for that&#39;s stuck with their Baba and now
[2588.0s] you&#39;re making bank let me tell you guys
[2591.04s] do not get sucked in the Trap of because
[2595.44s] you made a little money now you want to
[2597.359s] lock in your profit that is cognitive
[2599.96s] bias it&#39;s time to get
[2602.44s] paid where did you underwrite the sum of
[2605.64s] the parts and the value of the business
[2608.76s] okay that is fair value okay if you want
[2611.96s] to take off that some value there you
[2614.88s] can do that but I&#39;m telling you right
[2617.359s] now number one we&#39;re nowhere near
[2619.079s] intrinsic value number two the price and
[2623.44s] the excitement is going to dramatically
[2626.52s] overshoot the intrinsic value the same
[2629.92s] way that it undershot the intrinsic
[2633.04s] value on the downside all these negative
[2635.96s] analysts are now flipping positive and
[2638.079s] they&#39;re going to chase it the entire way
[2640.04s] up why because a opinion follows trend
[2646.359s] is the name of the game and as my great
[2648.88s] friend Damien would say burden yourself
[2652.04s] with the facts baby so moving right
[2655.839s] along uh let&#39;s just take a look cuz I

[2681.76s] to what&#39;s going to take place in the
[2683.48s] next 12 months for people who are

[2703.88s] started Al marrow give me a break we&#39;re
[2706.599s] not even in the first inning okay these
[2710.079s] cyclical things I cannot believe all the
[2712.4s] opportunities that Co created this is a
[2714.72s] once in a
[2716.119s] 100e environment for people like me to
[2719.839s] make people like you I&#39;m now talking to
[2722.559s] my existing clients as much as we can
[2725.16s] humanly possibly make together look at
[2727.319s] Boeing okay so what it&#39;s had this huge
[2729.88s] run that we&#39;ve benefited from from 138
[2732.72s] to
[2733.8s] 180 it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s not even getting
[2737.119s] started we&#39;ve talked about the the
[2739.52s] backlog of a half a trillion dollars
[2741.68s] we&#39;ve talked about the new C CEO Kelly
[2744.16s] ortberg we talked about all the other
[2745.96s] things and for those of you guys that
[2747.359s] down on Boeing it&#39;s very simple
[2749.92s] Southwest goes to Boeing and they say
[2752.2s] you guys have been terrible you have no
[2754.76s] quality control I cannot believe it and
[2757.64s] Boeing says I&#39;m sorry Mr
[2760.16s] Southwest we feel really bad why don&#39;t
[2762.88s] you go wait online at Airbus and you can
[2764.76s] get your next plane in 25 years I mean
[2766.92s] talk about the most beautiful business
[2769.24s] ever and they&#39;re going to fix all that
[2770.8s] stuff that&#39;s been you know it is very
[2772.68s] serious but Kelly knows how to fix it
[2774.76s] and that&#39;s why he&#39;s there he&#39;s actually
[2776.319s] an engineer versus a Salesman they
[2778.0s] finally got the message Alibaba okay you
[2780.559s] guys are so unbelie like the excitement
[2783.88s] people texting me are you a soothsayer
[2785.8s] no I&#39;m not a soothsayer I read the
[2787.88s] financials and I&#39;m patient as hell and
[2790.16s] we use low leverage so that we can wait
[2793.64s] through and play the time Arbitrage game
[2796.28s] which is our huge Advantage so for those
[2798.76s] of you who think this is a big move we
[2801.0s] have not even begun next Baxter reported
[2805.48s] great earnings today why because they
[2807.4s] did what we actually said that they were
[2808.92s] going to do it took them a few months
[2811.04s] longer but they got rid of the kidney
[2813.119s] business and now they have money and now
[2815.44s] they&#39;re get their multiple is getting
[2817.92s] R-rated why because their slowest
[2820.44s] growing business is no longer part of
[2822.48s] the business and they have money to
[2823.96s] delever and all the things that we said
[2825.92s] were going to happen are starting to
[2827.319s] happen so for those of you who think wow

[2830.8s] profits these have not begun ladies and
[2834.119s] gentlemen so uh crown castle okay what&#39;s

[2844.839s] than 8 billion they&#39;re going to buy in
[2847.119s] shares they&#39;re going to pay B down debt
[2849.4s] and those 40,000 towers are going to
[2851.319s] Mint money with zero maintenance zero
[2854.359s] capex just spitting out cash to the
[2856.4s] owners you&#39;re going to collect your 7%
[2858.48s] dividend yield while you wait oh and by
[2860.559s] the way you&#39;re probably going to get 50
[2862.2s] to 100% capital appreciation over the
[2864.319s] next few years on top of it next Cooper
[2868.04s] standard we&#39;re going to talk about this
[2870.2s] I couldn&#39;t be more excited about this

[2877.0s] hole at better prices than we did I love
[2879.88s] it we did pick up a few more shares even
[2882.64s] though we backed up the truck at 42 some
[2885.599s] couple of whatever it was weeks ago we
[2887.96s] didn&#39;t get a ton at 36 cuz we had to do
[2890.44s] our work we got a few at

[2911.44s] in a short period of time is a big move

[2919.76s] that but look Take the Long View ladies
[2922.359s] and gentlemen and you know you tell me
[2926.319s] okay we we&#39;re partners with Jerry Jones

[2930.559s] we bought in the hole he&#39;s got 67% of
[2933.359s] the company at $7 and change we&#39;re at $8
[2936.24s] and change across the board and this
[2938.319s] game is just beginning just again 2002
[2941.48s] to 2007 we&#39;ve talked about that a
[2943.68s] million times for those of you are new
[2945.2s] you&#39;re not going to get every single
[2946.28s] reference as long as you get the
[2947.88s] concepts you are going to be well ahead
[2949.96s] of the pack diio look Buffett just
[2953.04s] bought constellation Brands he gets it
[2955.359s] people have been drinking alcohol for
[2956.76s] 5,000 years are they drinking yes less
[2959.4s] yes is diio adapting by uh having 56%
[2963.4s] growth in the non-alcoholic cocktail
[2965.319s] business you bet are they going to
[2967.28s] recover here no question about it Disney
[2970.319s] okay everyone&#39;s like wow Disney was so
[2972.24s] great okay my friend on TV said Tom
[2974.68s] Hayes had this one in the 80s yes thank
[2977.16s] you I&#39;m very grateful we didn&#39;t get in
[2979.24s] for a move from 80 to 100 uh 10 whatever
[2982.68s] the hell it&#39;s trading at 110 this thing
[2984.92s] is going back up it&#39;s going to take a
[2986.799s] few years it&#39;ll be back over 200 bucks
[2989.119s] this is the same exact story as when the
[2991.2s] bass family bought a third of the
[2992.52s] company in 1984 because uh they were
[2995.839s] losing money because the transition to
[2998.799s] VHS tapes to monetize the Legacy IP the
[3002.119s] the the cruise businesses are throwing
[3003.76s] off so much cash it&#39;s insane that you
[3006.0s] think the treasury prints money every
[3008.72s] time Disney puts up these new cruise
[3010.52s] ships the return on invested capital is
[3012.48s] insane it just prints money out to
[3015.079s] shareholders all day long and they are
[3017.2s] investing massively in that business
[3019.28s] this one&#39;s a winner for a long time and
[3021.24s] this wasn&#39;t hard to do while everyone
[3022.96s] was complaining about woke is broke okay
[3025.119s] we were buying one of the greatest
[3026.28s] businesses in the world down 60% and you
[3029.2s] could couldn&#39;t give it away so that&#39;s
[3030.799s] what we do here Estee louder new
[3033.72s] director we&#39;re going to talk about
[3034.88s] bought a ton in the hole that&#39;s what we
[3036.4s] like louder family 38% of the stock
[3039.119s] everyone says it&#39;s old women they&#39;re
[3040.64s] dying off go look at the brands actually
[3043.28s] do the work go talk to your 10 year-olds
[3045.839s] and 15y olds and ask them about the 12
[3048.04s] Brands and tell me which ones are hot
[3049.599s] and they&#39;re going to show you the four
[3051.04s] that are flying off the shelves Etsy and
[3053.52s] by the way this is no different than VF
[3055.44s] Corp these these guys have been trading
[3057.64s] out in and out of brands for hundred you
[3060.2s] know some odd years family business just
[3062.96s] the same way that VF Corp has been doing
[3064.839s] the exact same thing and people couldn&#39;t
[3066.72s] see the forest for the trees and there
[3069.119s] you know price is down so they throw up
[3071.68s] everything in the hole and they miss the
[3073.92s] opportunities of a lifetime but again
[3075.64s] the point is these are getting started
[3077.0s] Etsy okay everyone&#39;s worried they just
[3078.96s] had record sales ever this quarter and
[3082.44s] and people are panicking in the streets
[3084.96s] while they&#39;re buying back stock
[3086.559s] generating free cash flow yeah you know
[3089.16s] yes their primary business little bit
[3091.119s] weaker than expected their new business
[3093.48s] is again buying more platforms are
[3095.88s] growing like a weed next gener okay so
[3099.92s] this was another one you couldn&#39;t give
[3101.2s] away up under 100 we&#39;re pounding the
[3104.0s] table on it it doubled to
[3106.559s] 195 okay we didn&#39;t get into it for a
[3109.599s] double this thing has 75% of the home
[3112.52s] standby generator standby generator mark
[3116.599s] Market in the US the penetration is at a
[3119.359s] level that is just getting started do
[3122.4s] you think we&#39;re going to have more
[3123.44s] weather events or less weather events um
[3126.319s] do you think the grid is going to be
[3127.52s] more stable or less stable you know the
[3129.16s] aners to both of those questions this
[3130.96s] pullback is a gift Mana from Heaven I&#39;d
[3133.2s] put new money in here all day long goose
[3137.0s] we&#39;re going to talk about uh goose is
[3139.44s] fine we&#39;re perfectly happy with that
[3141.0s] it&#39;s a tiny position but maybe come
[3143.24s] become a bigger one gxo Logistics kud to
[3146.92s] you guys who bought at 36 as I said we
[3149.839s] just bought too much at 42 uh after that

[3158.04s] uh we put that out in the article this
[3159.76s] week we&#39;ll cover some of that as well
[3161.76s] here&#39;s a staple just getting started
[3163.599s] mismanaged what we got a catalyst for
[3165.44s] turnaround turnaround Tom&#39;s formula
[3168.16s] guy&#39;s been Mis mismanaging the business
[3169.92s] since 2016 he finally decides to retire
[3172.599s] we&#39;ll get someone in there to fix it I
[3174.04s] mean how can you screw up planters ippy
[3177.24s] horel chili I mean this stuff is a
[3179.24s] no-brainer it&#39;s all the protein stuff
[3180.839s] that everyone needs with the glps it&#39;s
[3183.319s] it&#39;s easy peasy Intel okay couldn&#39;t give
[3186.599s] it away below 20 I I went on vanney I
[3189.88s] said listen steu you need to buy this
[3191.96s] because if they liquidated the whole
[3193.24s] damn thing tomorrow you&#39;re getting your
[3194.559s] money back and if they actually do
[3195.96s] something right you could get a double
[3197.68s] and God forbid they execute on their
[3199.319s] plan you could get a four bagger and
[3201.16s] sure enough we&#39;re we&#39;re in the early
[3202.88s] days there&#39;s breakup talks and this and
[3205.0s] that they may not by the way it&#39;s up on
[3206.76s] tsmc and uh broadcom and all that stuff
[3209.96s] none of that may happen maybe all of it
[3212.079s] will happen I don&#39;t know if all of it
[3213.4s] happens we probably get out 35 or 40
[3215.839s] great we love it Take the Money and Run
[3218.64s] uh if none of that happens it&#39;s probably
[3220.2s] the best thing ever it goes back down to
[3221.64s] 22 we buy some more and then over time
[3224.119s] it goes back to 80 or 100 so that&#39;s what
[3226.76s] we&#39;re thinking about this one&#39;s been a
[3228.319s] monster okay uh you know we bought a ton
[3231.68s] in the hole go back to the podcast in
[3233.559s] March of 2023 Regional Banks we also but
[3236.839s] City and Bank of America at that time
[3239.359s] flipped out at huge gains over the past
[3241.839s] summer this one we held on to uh you
[3245.319s] know this is starting to get a little
[3246.52s] long in the two so this is not someone
[3248.24s] i&#39; put uh new money we&#39;ve had a huge
[3251.119s] huge you know just about double in that
[3253.559s] one uh we&#39;ll see we&#39;ll see wink wink
[3257.079s] PayPal okay here&#39;s another one you
[3259.559s] couldn&#39;t give away in the 50s and 60s
[3261.64s] ran up to to 90 okay everyone got
[3264.839s] excited of course it pulled back to
[3267.4s] 75 uh we talked about it I think last
[3270.119s] week uh we would put new money to work
[3272.64s] here we&#39;re we&#39;re comfortable with that
[3274.64s] um uh Alex Chris is doing exactly what
[3276.72s] he did last year sandbagging going to
[3278.92s] generate 8 billion of cash they&#39;re going
[3280.64s] to buy in they&#39;ve got 15 billion
[3282.359s] authorized they&#39;re going to buy in 20%
[3284.0s] of the company he&#39;s fired all the
[3285.88s] unprofitable customers people are
[3287.359s] mistaken that for lower growth he just
[3289.16s] doesn&#39;t want to lose money on business
[3290.68s] he&#39;s a smart guy focusing on value add
[3293.4s] to existing customers increasing the
[3295.2s] margins increasing the take rate the guy
[3297.0s] knows what he&#39;s doing he crushed it at
[3299.92s] into it ran 50% of the revenues the
[3302.04s] thing was like a 30s something bagger
[3304.04s] and he&#39;ll do the same thing Brad Jacobs
[3306.04s] he&#39;s screwing around with Beacon Roofing
[3308.64s] eventually he&#39;ll get get a platform and
[3310.48s] this thing will be off the races and the
[3312.52s] in the in the meantime it&#39;s dead money
[3315.16s] and uh I think he&#39;s overpaying for
[3316.839s] Beacon rof and anyway but he needs a
[3318.96s] platform and then he&#39;ll get then he&#39;ll
[3320.559s] use the multiple Arbitrage public
[3322.44s] private so he&#39;ll overpay for the first
[3324.359s] one and then he&#39;ll buy a ton of these
[3325.68s] small fragments businesses at five times
[3328.16s] and get paid 20 times in the public
[3329.88s] markets he&#39;s done this over and over
[3331.4s] created billions of dollars of wealth
[3332.839s] for shareholders betting on the jockey
[3334.76s] another theme of turnaround Tom Stanley
[3336.88s] Black and&amp; Decker this is the best
[3338.24s] leverage play on the housing turnaround
[3340.72s] which is going to occur when as I said
[3343.319s] publicly the biggest surprise of the
[3345.079s] year is going to be 10-year yield goes
[3346.64s] to 4% first everyone called for 5% at
[3350.88s] 480 and we said no not going to happen
[3354.88s] why most crowded Trad
[3356.92s] look at the commitments of Traders
[3358.4s] reports managers most short uh 10year
[3361.559s] treasury since 2018 right before the
[3364.079s] huge rally in treasuries as rates come
[3366.799s] down this housing thing is going to Boom
[3368.839s] tons of supplies going to come on the
[3370.359s] market Stanley Black and&amp; Decker&#39;s best
[3372.64s] position with the most incredible Tools
[3374.88s] DeWalt Stanley Craftsman black and&amp;
[3379.2s] Decker you name it they own it they&#39;ve
[3381.4s] got the business they got they cut out
[3383.16s] $2 billion of cost anyway they brought
[3385.4s] the margins up from 22% to 30 they&#39;re
[3387.599s] going to 35% that&#39;s in the worst Market
[3390.28s] ever wait till that market comes back
[3392.799s] when bessent and Trump hit the 10-year
[3395.28s] yield they&#39;re not screwing around
[3396.96s] they&#39;re going to bring the 10year yield
[3398.559s] down and so is Doge by the way laying
[3401.2s] off all these people that probably don&#39;t
[3402.64s] have transferable skills into the
[3404.559s] private sector uh is going to be
[3408.28s] disinflationary and offset all the fears
[3410.92s] about inflation onetime tariffs and all
[3413.039s] this nonsense and this stock is going to
[3416.24s] fly VF Corp we&#39;ve had this monster move
[3419.599s] from our basis around 15 Blended to got
[3422.96s] up to 27 almost a double faster than we
[3426.16s] expected some are faster some are slower
[3429.48s] uh again this is just getting started I
[3430.96s] hope it pulls back to 20 so we can buy
[3432.68s] more before it goes to 40 then we&#39;ll
[3434.599s] reevaluate but I think Brack and
[3436.52s] listening to him on that uh call that we
[3439.359s] played on this and some of the other
[3441.76s] stuff I think he&#39;s going to take this
[3443.28s] thing to new highs over a few years just
[3444.96s] like he did in Logitech
[3447.0s] uh came in when the stock was down 82%
[3449.359s] in
[3450.4s] 2013 8 years later you had a 26 bagger a
[3454.2s] million became 26 million
[3456.559s] biotech R rallied out of the hole this
[3459.68s] is just getting started we are going to
[3461.2s] see amazing things happen with biotech
[3463.16s] so you guys think I forget about these I
[3465.079s] listen
[3466.2s] I&#39;m I&#39;m doing it okay here&#39;s what we go
[3469.28s] back to records fourth quarter we&#39;ll do
[3471.079s] this one in detail in the article next
[3472.799s] week um but the name of the game here
[3476.28s] transformative sale of the kidney care
[3478.119s] business is now complete positioning
[3480.0s] company for next stage of not survival
[3483.799s] growth and Innovation this is code for
[3487.599s] multiple reating the rest of the
[3489.359s] business grows fast the kidney care
[3491.16s] business grew slow multiple goes to 12
[3494.039s] to 16 and then all this stuff starts
[3497.28s] hitting on all cylinders they get they
[3499.0s] reignite growth and they get rid of all
[3501.359s] the distractions and they&#39;re Off to the
[3503.0s] Races and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s going to
[3504.44s] happen alib Baba we&#39;re going to do in
[3505.68s] dramatic
[3506.88s] detail next week but uh we can cover a
[3510.839s] few key things the name of the game is
[3512.799s] their AI business is growing
[3514.24s] everything&#39;s growing quote this
[3515.68s] quarter&#39;s results demonstrated
[3517.079s] substantial progress in our user first
[3518.839s] AI driven strategies and the re
[3520.599s] acceleration growth of our core
[3522.72s] businesses during this quarter customer
[3524.68s] management Revenue at tbal and t-all
[3527.039s] grew
[3528.44s] 9% as a result of initiatives to enhance
[3531.4s] user experience and effective
[3533.319s] monetization our Cloud Revenue growth
[3536.119s] reignited to double digits at 133% with
[3539.0s] AI related product Revenue achieving
[3541.52s] triple digit growth for the sixth
[3544.799s] consecutive quarter Numero Uno in AI in
[3549.359s] China and soon to be more than China at
[3552.079s] the rate that they&#39;re going with their
[3553.64s] partnership with apple they&#39;re going to
[3556.16s] do all the AI for Apple AI Intelligence
[3560.28s] on the Apple phones quen 2.5 knocking
[3563.0s] the cover off the ball relative to deep
[3565.039s] seek and relative to open AI on most
[3569.839s] metrics looking ahead Revenue growth at
[3572.16s] Cloud intelligence group driven by AI
[3574.079s] will continue to
[3575.96s] accelerate we will continue to execute
[3578.48s] against our strategic priorities in
[3580.52s] e-commerce cloud computing including
[3582.319s] further investment to drive long-term
[3584.039s] growth so they generated $5 billion of
[3588.119s] free cash flow despite all of the
[3589.96s] investment they&#39;ve been buying they
[3591.64s] bought in 9% of the stock last year uh
[3594.68s] they&#39;re growing the business again this
[3596.52s] has turned from a deep value company
[3598.96s] back into a growth company and an
[3601.92s] innovation company their International
[3603.68s] grew
[3605.92s] 32% tound t-all their mature businesses
[3610.0s] grew
[3611.839s] 9% Cloud intelligence
[3614.96s] 133% and then these little tiny
[3617.2s] businesses even had growth local
[3618.839s] Services up 12% digital media up 8% I
[3623.16s] mean these are rounding errors but it
[3625.039s] just shows a across the board everything
[3628.88s] is moving in the right direction
[3631.0s] earnings you know cash flow revenues is
[3633.799s] the name of the game and good things so
[3636.44s] we&#39;ll cover that in some more detail
[3638.039s] next week um moving along
[3642.48s] here gotta get this thing moved over
[3645.2s] there we
[3646.68s] go here&#39;s Joe Sai spoke at look at the
[3650.92s] alibaba&#39;s AI leadership conference I
[3653.799s] look I I think in fact I actually use
[3657.039s] the gro uh because I&#39;m I&#39;m on X his
[3660.96s] Twitter app and uh they provide an inter
[3664.799s] interface to grock which I use very
[3667.2s] often I&#39;m very impressed by uh the
[3669.839s] results um I also use a number of other
[3672.92s] apps uh a AI apps including our own uh
[3678.52s] the answer to your question you know
[3680.48s] this AI race who&#39;s better who a a AI is
[3683.44s] better the answer
[3686.16s] yesterday is going to be different from
[3688.24s] the answer tomorrow right now everybody
[3690.68s] is in a fairly tight race uh the next
[3694.119s] model that&#39;s going to be launched is
[3695.4s] going to be better than some but not
[3697.4s] others and then somebody else will
[3698.68s] launch something that&#39;s better than
[3699.799s] yours and we think we think that&#39;s
[3702.16s] that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen but what
[3705.64s] has H you mentioned deep seek and it
[3707.68s] it&#39;s quite significant uh and that&#39;s
[3710.119s] because they actually demonstrated that
[3712.359s] you can use some engineering Innovation
[3714.839s] to drastically lower the cost of
[3716.88s] training and inference of large language
[3719.599s] models uh and and up to this point
[3723.0s] people are massively investing into
[3725.96s] these Frontier models uh but here&#39;s the
[3728.92s] problem if you think about uh training
[3732.359s] of Frontier models as an Endeavor to
[3735.119s] educate your kids and you want to uh
[3738.599s] have the smartest kids uh have you know
[3742.079s] developed them so that they can uh
[3744.24s] acquire phds and not just one subject
[3747.2s] matter but 15 subject Matters from maths
[3749.48s] to physics to biology to psychology
[3752.039s] everything you want to have the smartest
[3754.079s] kids if that&#39;s the case take that into
[3757.119s] today&#39;s AI race there&#39;s maybe only five
[3760.359s] or six Rich parents that can afford to
[3764.319s] have the smartest
[3765.72s] kids um but is that something that we&#39;re
[3768.119s] really interested in it&#39;s probably not
[3770.599s] you have to start to ask yourself what
[3773.2s] is the purpose of what is the goal of
[3775.48s] develop veloping AI is this to have the
[3778.2s] smartest child so that they can win
[3780.799s] every single Nobel Prize or is
[3783.64s] it something different like there&#39;s a
[3786.96s] lot of problems in the world that need
[3788.52s] to be solved uh there&#39;s a lot of uh
[3791.839s] issues that we need to use AI to apply
[3795.119s] AI so that it can be useful and
[3797.2s] productive and make an economic impact
[3799.76s] uh so I think people are going to start
[3803.599s] when they look at the phenomenon of Deep
[3805.839s] see people are going to start shift away
[3807.599s] from all right let&#39;s stop putting in
[3810.52s] hundreds of billions of dollars into
[3812.4s] compute infrastructure so that we can
[3814.839s] train the smartest you know PhD and
[3817.48s] everything that can win the Nobel Prize
[3819.76s] let&#39;s find out what are the actual
[3821.839s] problems in the world uh and let&#39;s use
[3824.52s] AI to uh solve them so a lot of people
[3827.48s] are going to start putting resources
[3828.92s] into applications I think that&#39;s number
[3831.079s] one number two is deep SE has taught us
[3834.279s] the value of Open Source
[3837.16s] um uh you know if if today your only
[3840.839s] purpose in life is to develop a close
[3843.0s] Source uh AI system that is the smartest
[3846.0s] PhD student in everything the Nobel
[3849.24s] prize winning kid uh I personally think
[3853.24s] the value of that endeavor is
[3856.839s] approaching zero reference uh in looks
[3859.92s] like it was the world government Summit
[3863.44s] in Dubai on February 13th listen to what
[3866.4s] he had to say he&#39;s basically saying
[3869.079s] these people investing all this money
[3870.68s] without specific outcomes are probably
[3872.44s] not going to get the return on Capital
[3874.039s] read through the lines and here&#39;s what
[3875.839s] he said and we&#39;re back and now let&#39;s go
[3879.64s] through the data of the week okay some
[3883.039s] of my favorite charts right here ladies
[3884.96s] and gentlemen number
[3886.96s] one China&#39;s terrific 10 they now have a
[3890.359s] name for it Alibaba 10 cent mawan zi byd
[3895.119s] JD n b gie
[3897.88s] smic now is beating the Magnificent 7 if
[3902.799s] you look at the performance of the mag 7
[3905.119s] between the China terrific 10 since
[3908.24s] December
[3911.2s] 2023 we are now beating the Magnificent
[3915.079s] 7 ladies and gentlemen up 85% versus the
[3917.92s] mag 7 Up
[3919.96s] 81% and at the same time what could be
[3923.24s] more beautiful than record
[3926.319s] short interest ready to get absolutely
[3929.72s] monkey hammered as we rip higher and as
[3933.0s] I said what did I say ladies and
[3934.319s] gentlemen they won&#39;t once it breaks
[3936.119s] through they won&#39;t let anyone in and
[3938.68s] that&#39;s exactly it&#39;s even surprised me
[3941.52s] how little they&#39;ve let people in as as
[3943.92s] enthusiastic as I&#39;ve been no different
[3946.64s] than go back and listen I was just as
[3949.16s] enthus if not more enthusiastic when it
[3951.039s] was at 60 than now when it&#39;s at 135 or
[3954.16s] 140 whatever it hit this morning
[3956.319s] um there you go gener here is
[3959.359s] from don&#39;t know but they put a 10 $210
[3962.839s] price Target I think it&#39;s Steel on gener
[3966.559s] uh if I could avoid this is from Peter
[3968.68s] Lynch one up on Wall Street if I could
[3970.359s] avoid a single stock it would be the
[3972.039s] hottest stock in the hottest industry
[3975.119s] the one that gets the most favorable
[3976.72s] publicity the one that every investor
[3978.96s] hears about in the car poool or on the
[3981.119s] commuter train and succumbing to the
[3983.16s] social pressure often B
[3987.96s] I don&#39;t need to say more about those
[3989.92s] there&#39;s a handful of them you know what
[3991.88s] they are and there are couple outside
[3994.319s] the mag that
[3996.68s] um Good Luck uh Domestic Auto
[3999.799s] inventories I show this because you
[4003.839s] know Jeff Edwards over at Cooper
[4006.2s] standard love him met him many times uh
[4010.079s] sandbagger and chief okay this guy is
[4012.559s] trying to tell me not trying to tell me
[4015.64s] it&#39;s what they publicly released that um
[4019.559s] production
[4021.16s] volumes can
[4023.16s] lag
[4024.839s] behind SAR in a meaningful
[4028.96s] way number one that is false if you
[4032.359s] actually overlay the data back 20 years
[4036.24s] SAR and production volumes always
[4039.2s] converge and number two when you have
[4042.2s] record low domestic inventory
[4049.68s] Tories you can&#39;t give me the story that
[4054.48s] the the Divergence is it&#39;s not like the
[4056.279s] inventories are up here and uh you know
[4059.359s] they&#39;re selling but they stop producing
[4060.92s] because there&#39;s so many days of
[4061.96s] inventory we&#39;re at record low days of
[4065.119s] inventory ladies and gentlemen they may
[4067.52s] think they want lower inventories but
[4070.44s] once the game is on and the incentives
[4072.88s] race to the bottom and the oem&#39;s margins
[4075.119s] compressed
[4076.319s] uh they are going to be producing cars
[4078.92s] and the reason I&#39;m emphasizing this
[4081.079s] ladies and gentlemen is because the
[4084.599s] credible predictors of USR are at 16.2
[4090.68s] million and 16.3 million cars for
[4096.48s] 2025 and Cooper standard thinks it&#39;s
[4100.279s] credible to publish a number of 15.1
[4104.279s] million for you us production because
[4107.759s] SNP whatever said a month ago that that
[4111.319s] could be the production because we have
[4113.96s] so much inventory does this look like so
[4118.12s] much inventory to you this is sandbagger
[4121.04s] ISM at its finest and I understand why
[4123.48s] they&#39;re doing it because the oems are
[4126.64s] starting to get pressed on margins and
[4128.6s] they don&#39;t want to say come take our
[4130.199s] honey pot so I get it but I&#39;m telling
[4132.839s] you as massive shareholders ERS like I
[4136.52s] am okay I put my money where my mouth is
[4139.0s] I eat my own cooking I have a material
[4142.159s] material position alongside all of my
[4144.6s] clients and yes the the uh um initial
[4149.44s] base is 550 but I&#39;m telling you I would
[4152.92s] put money I would put new money to work
[4154.839s] till the cows come home at these levels
[4156.4s] because here&#39;s
[4159.04s] why in 2017 they had 17.1 million SAR
[4163.92s] not produ number excuse my
[4166.44s] language but like this was such a
[4168.04s] sandbagger ISM it was crazy town okay
[4172.759s] um every 300,000 cars now by the way
[4176.92s] they used to make my whole model was
[4179.44s] predicated on them making $150 a car now
[4181.96s] they&#39;re all hybrids and EVS they make
[4183.6s] more per car they&#39;re making
[4185.199s] $190 a car okay so and they&#39;ve cut $600
[4190.12s] million of cost out of their business I
[4192.239s] mean it&#39;s insan you you could hear he
[4194.239s] was giddy at the end of the call but
[4195.88s] he&#39;s got to like keep it under wraps
[4197.64s] because you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
[4200.8s] a great business they will have two
[4202.28s] years where they make so much money it
[4204.88s] will be insane and then the oems will
[4207.719s] come to take that money back it happens
[4209.36s] every single cycle we will be out when
[4211.199s] they&#39;re making more money than God uh
[4213.88s] but in
[4216.08s] 2017 Cooper sander traded $146 on $719
[4220.44s] of earnings on 17.1 million us SAR
[4225.92s] we&#39;re probably going to do 162 SAR this
[4228.52s] 151 production is complete and
[4233.12s] uh which probably means they&#39;ll do like
[4235.04s] 159 to 16 production even being
[4237.56s] conservative I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if
[4239.199s] they did
[4240.159s] 162 uh and their Break Even is like 157
[4243.92s] it&#39;s actually even lower now you can go
[4246.76s] through the call I mean he&#39;s like if
[4248.08s] volumes don&#39;t even grow we&#39;re going to
[4249.52s] get our EA to 270 million
[4253.96s] um so
[4256.48s] so on 162 if I&#39;m right I think they
[4261.719s] could earn $4 a share on
[4264.44s] that God forbid we get to 165 or back to
[4267.52s] 17 and and forget about earning 719 I
[4270.6s] think they&#39;ll earn 9 or 10 bucks so in
[4273.52s] 2017 at the cycle Peak on $7 they got a
[4276.56s] 20 times as multiple as $146 stock so
[4279.32s] let&#39;s say they do $9 and they get a
[4281.679s] trough multiple 10 times instead of 20
[4284.199s] times if they get 20 times they trade at
[4285.8s] 180 bucks if they get 10 times they
[4287.76s] trade at 90 bucks if they get 15 times
[4290.44s] they trade in between there okay so 135
[4294.08s] whatever 135 so the point is the stock
[4297.08s] is trading at $15 I don&#39;t need to say a
[4299.4s] whole lot more this was modeled after
[4300.679s] Charlie munger&#39;s Teno deal uh Teno was
[4303.28s] in the whole normal cyclical business he
[4305.12s] put in 10 million turned it into 80 gave
[4307.04s] the 80 to leel Loop put it in China
[4308.88s] stocks 80 million becomes 500 million
[4311.0s] we&#39;re doing the exact same Playbook
[4312.32s] ladies and gentlemen ton of China when
[4314.28s] no one wants it ton of Auto Part
[4316.52s] supplier when no one wants it if you
[4318.08s] study history you can you can really
[4319.8s] learn a lot okay here we go year-to date
[4323.8s] return this is I think we spent like the
[4327.639s] last 10 podcasts of 2024 saying get
[4330.239s] ready for this mag 7 has produced 1%
[4333.84s] return year-to dat
[4336.6s] unmagnify 6% year-to date S&amp;P 4% year-to
[4340.76s] date regime change ladies and gentlemen
[4343.44s] here you go this is from Mike already
[4345.639s] European equities up 7% Emerging Markets
[4348.199s] up 6% S&amp;P up
[4350.239s] 2% uh and so on so that was a couple of
[4353.36s] days ago home builders guys this is
[4357.08s] going to bounce the catalyst is going to
[4359.4s] be the 10year yield compressing Stanley
[4362.04s] Black and&amp; Decker is going to go up a
[4364.639s] lot more than the home builders when
[4366.84s] they recover mark my words operating
[4371.04s] leverage China stocks rise despite
[4373.8s] tariffs and properties loads
[4375.639s] will it last here is our favorite Barons
[4379.08s] reporter who&#39;s been wrong the whole way
[4381.28s] up we went through 135 of her headlines
[4384.48s] over the last year being negative on
[4386.4s] China every single day now it&#39;s up 81%
[4389.44s] relative to mag 7 outperforming in the
[4391.8s] last year and a month and she&#39;s still
[4394.76s] doing the last I haven&#39;t seen her in a
[4396.239s] week and a half now after this last
[4398.32s] negative headline so it&#39;ll pull back 5%
[4401.32s] she&#39;ll be out with five more negative
[4402.679s] headlines you can&#39;t make this stuff up
[4405.12s] Chinese stocks on track to beat Indian
[4406.8s] peers for the third month what did we
[4408.52s] say all last year Japanese and Indian
[4412.0s] was Asian hot money that needed
[4413.76s] somewhere to hide once the China game
[4415.76s] turns on it&#39;s all flooding back to China
[4417.6s] and they&#39;re going to be left for dead at
[4420.199s] uh 12 month lows in uh India uh here we
[4424.84s] go uh highest since 2022 we&#39;ve now blown
[4428.4s] through that in terms of Chinese stocks
[4430.8s] Bank of Japan set to offload all stocks
[4434.36s] bought during during the financial
[4436.44s] crisis I
[4438.88s] mean there you go okay uh there you go
[4443.239s] Australian dollar bullishly breaches
[4445.4s] resistance we&#39;ve been talking about this
[4447.159s] Canadian dollar it&#39;s taking longer
[4448.76s] because you&#39;ve got some leadership that
[4450.639s] needs to change as quickly as possible
[4452.8s] but now even the Looney is starting to
[4455.12s] turn around despite your leadership
[4457.4s] problem which will hopefully change very
[4459.679s] soon losing
[4461.679s] momentum company guidance Trails analyst
[4464.08s] estimates by the most in the
[4465.679s] this is the I mean can&#39;t they read their
[4468.56s] own chart q1 every single year they take
[4471.56s] down guidance why the secret to
[4473.6s] happiness is low expectations both in
[4476.6s] life and in the stock market and all
[4479.32s] these sandbagger and Chiefs that get
[4481.199s] paid for beating earnings take their
[4483.4s] guidance down and then they beat the
[4485.32s] next four quarters and they look like
[4487.159s] Geniuses and that&#39;s exactly what is
[4489.56s] happening right now as I said to sue it
[4492.239s] is sandbagger season here we go and
[4495.08s] annual S&amp;P 500 profit Outlook hasn&#39;t
[4497.52s] budged for
[4499.679s] 2026 uh uh so while estimates have come
[4504.0s] down for 2025 2026 is going up uh
[4508.52s] investors hit pause on the Trump trade
[4510.239s] while Chinese stocks race ahead you can
[4512.08s] see the dramatic outperformance over the
[4514.28s] S&amp;P over Bitcoin over the dollar is now
[4517.4s] turning negative as we anticipated
[4520.04s] election dollar yields go up in
[4523.48s] inauguration dollar starts to roll over

[4618.76s] they&#39;ll run inflation hot they&#39;ll take
[4620.28s] spending down uh run growth hot and um
[4624.159s] we&#39;re going to have huge nominal growth
[4625.6s] in the next four years let let me just
[4627.4s] tell you that hang on to your hats labor
[4629.88s] force participation rate tends to
[4631.76s] diverge this is really interesting we&#39;ve
[4634.0s] been worried about the labor force
[4635.44s] participation work but it&#39;s largely
[4637.32s] skewed to the 55 and overs that never
[4640.52s] re-entered the the 25 to 54 are doing
[4642.88s] what they need to do 84% labor force
[4645.48s] participation rate so that&#39;s very
[4646.96s] promising to see uh what are we looking
[4649.88s] at here Japanese 10-year government bond
[4653.48s] yield every single week this goes up
[4656.239s] what does that mean every single week
[4658.08s] the carry trade gets pressured and money

[4676.08s] csi300 in China some of that has to do
[4678.96s] with the stock connect as we anticipated
[4680.8s] with Baba we&#39;ve had 20 billion dollars
[4683.239s] of flows into Baba from Mainland we you
[4685.88s] guys knew tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today we
[4687.76s] were covering that over the summer uh
[4690.28s] nifty 50 here&#39;s India okay all that hot
[4692.8s] money is coming out going back to China
[4694.76s] ladies and gentlemen just the be early
[4696.76s] days more L cargos are arriving at
[4699.239s] Europe Shores so that&#39;s going to help C
[4702.48s] stock resources okay this is interesting
[4705.52s] everyone used this chart this week to
[4707.239s] say that we&#39;re at a top maybe we are
[4709.32s] maybe we&#39;re not I don&#39;t know the market
[4710.56s] was down a lot we we had a great day
[4714.04s] um but what they failed to realize is
[4716.52s] this was the exact same cash level
[4719.6s] actually the last two times you had cash
[4721.12s] levels this low were super duper bullish
[4724.12s] uh that was 2004 uh and 2011 okay now
[4729.679s] did you have it in 2007 yeah so people
[4733.76s] it&#39;s mindboggling they look at most of
[4736.159s] these instances 2011 2013 203 were very
[4739.76s] very very bullish for a very long time
[4742.36s] and all they do is look at the one
[4743.56s] instance where it didn&#39;t work and say
[4745.199s] cash levels are low we&#39;re going to crash
[4747.92s] okay sell everything to me in the whole
[4749.96s] thank you very much uh most bullish
[4752.08s] developments in 2025 China growth picks
[4755.28s] up people are now looking at what
[4757.32s] happens to the global economy if China
[4759.92s] growth accelerates and by the way news
[4762.44s] flash it is here&#39;s uh Tesla is
[4765.0s] Automotive Revenue by year so look you
[4768.04s] can see it here it is rolling over uh
[4771.76s] this is not good at all unless you
[4774.44s] believe in robots and if you believe in
[4776.08s] robots and you believe in autonomous
[4778.159s] then you take a flyer on this guy we&#39;ve
[4780.28s] never been long it we&#39;ve never been
[4781.639s] short it it&#39;s not what we do we stay in
[4783.36s] our lane we do turnaround times doubles
[4786.4s] and triples off the lows two three years
[4789.239s] rinse and repeat compound money and
[4792.04s] don&#39;t worry about predicting the future
[4793.92s] cast Freight index is a little bit low
[4796.199s] keeping an eye on that GDP estimates
[4798.679s] came down to the mid 223s a lot of this
[4801.4s] is probably predicated on tariff fears
[4803.48s] which people can&#39;t actually model until
[4805.159s] you know what exactly is happening Euro
[4807.719s] Zone economy fair to touch better than
[4809.719s] first estimated in Q4 data shows China
[4813.0s] January Bank lending hits record high on
[4815.8s] policy stimulus X and Jack ma chat seen
[4820.0s] as next Catalyst for blistering rally
[4822.159s] not only did they invite Jack ma to
[4824.159s] speak at the G conference it&#39;s my
[4826.8s] understanding they give Jack ma an award
[4828.96s] big change topof the market in
[4831.88s] 2021 uh when Alibaba was 320 the Chinese
[4836.199s] government wanted to take uh Jack ma
[4838.88s] behind the shed and shoot him now
[4840.239s] they&#39;re giving him Awards the game is
[4842.08s] back on why they need him you can&#39;t have
[4844.719s] 20% of your 25-year-old educated
[4847.48s] students unemployed and rioting in the
[4849.76s] streets the number one job of a position
[4852.0s] of a politician is to stay in power and
[4854.28s] they fig figure that out and We&#39;re Off
[4856.159s] to the Races so uh we they just they
[4859.08s] just took more pain for a longer period
[4862.32s] of time than we thought that they would
[4863.8s] but sooner or later survival kicks in
[4865.6s] and boom we&#39;re off and when it comes it
[4868.56s] comes all at once as we always like to
[4871.28s] say equal weight versus aggregate S&amp;P
[4874.159s] annualized 10year returns we see this
[4875.92s] inflection point just like we saw in
[4877.719s] when what have you been covering 2001
[4880.4s] which was the greatest period to do what
[4882.36s] go against the grain while everyone was
[4884.0s] crammed in to uh the tech thing chasing
[4888.84s] Enron chasing Tao chasing Worldcom
[4891.52s] chasing Cisco chasing Amazon which by
[4894.84s] the way did everything that they
[4896.52s] promised they were going to do the
[4897.719s] problem was you were paying for what
[4899.4s] they said they were going to do 15 years
[4900.8s] later in 2000 therefore the stock had to
[4903.32s] correct and rate 90% over the next two
[4907.159s] years even though it was a great company
[4908.8s] and the underlying fundamentals were
[4910.6s] improving you just paid too much okay
[4914.6s] good things happen when you buy high
[4916.0s] quality assets at good prices not the
[4919.92s] highest price ever offered in public
[4923.0s] markets history like some of the stocks
[4925.4s] that we see today okay a substantial
[4928.8s] Divergence between home builders and the
[4930.239s] broad Market this will reconverge
[4932.719s] Stanley and J will be the bigger
[4934.639s] beneficiaries than the home builders
[4936.4s] themselves because the home builders
[4937.84s] themselves are going to get a little bit
[4939.679s] uh hit on
[4941.56s] margins this is nothing related to the
[4944.199s] market
[4945.04s] but I am so grateful that I found golf
[4947.639s] while I found it late in life and you
[4949.32s] know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh fits and starts and
[4952.12s] had my best round ever two weeks ago and
[4954.28s] then couple good rounds after bad round
[4956.8s] today hopefully I&#39;ll have a good round
[4959.4s] uh in the next couple of days but anyway
[4961.92s] the point is this if you look
[4964.12s] here uh this is the daily average time
[4967.12s] with Friends by age and you can see it&#39;s
[4970.84s] like completely collapsed since 2012
[4974.56s] they&#39;re attributing it to devices Etc
[4977.199s] and golf is just one of those special
[4978.96s] things where adults that don&#39;t have time
[4981.32s] to hang around with friends can spend
[4983.4s] four hours doing something that they
[4984.84s] love get great uh exercise build
[4988.199s] relationships learn from great people um
[4991.719s] and uh go against this trend it&#39;s a
[4994.6s] contrarian investment in your happiness
[4997.159s] learned how to play golf and enjoy um
[5001.239s] here&#39;s another cast inferred Freight
[5002.84s] rates show them turning off in coming
[5005.239s] months so finally coming off the boil
[5006.92s] they&#39;ve been coming down coming up so
[5008.28s] that&#39;s positive truckload same thing an
[5010.36s] anemic recovery here so this is very
[5012.719s] very positive we haven&#39;t seen this type
[5014.12s] of inflection since 2020 why destock
[5018.4s] restock destock restock another theme
[5021.12s] the last 24 months booming fun fact that
[5023.56s] just happened this is from uh Seth
[5025.56s] golden only five times in S&amp;P history as
[5028.56s] S&amp;P undercut December low and then
[5031.199s] gained 3% by Valentine&#39;s Day the rest of
[5033.04s] the year 198 up 16% 91 up 14% 966
[5038.28s] 9820 and
[5041.52s] 20201 okay that is a fun fact worth
[5044.12s] noting deep seek boosting Chinese stocks
[5047.719s] okay you can see and by the way it&#39;s not
[5050.76s] every Chinese stock it&#39;s picking the
[5053.28s] right one uh and Alibaba is leading the
[5055.96s] pack in the scheme of the you know
[5057.84s] magnificent 10 over there or whatever
[5059.44s] they&#39;re calling that tremendous 10 uh
[5062.0s] bull markets last longer than you think
[5065.12s] so our current bull market is 28 months
[5068.88s] old the average since 1949 this is from
[5072.199s] Ryan Dietrich is 67 months and the
[5075.6s] longest one which started in 87 is 148
[5078.04s] months so this could be very early days
[5079.84s] and we are in that camp we&#39;ve covered
[5083.0s] the average amount of 20% Corrections is
[5086.159s] one every 4.1 years we had two in two
[5089.679s] years 2020 and 2022 so we basically
[5093.0s] pulled 8 years of that forward uh so we
[5096.52s] should have some some blue skies at
[5098.28s] least for another couple of years into
[5099.76s] the midterm uh this Market might be two
[5103.76s] but it is still young so we covered that
[5107.239s] uh again young bull market all this ah
[5110.639s] here we go this is uh Seth and he&#39;s a
[5114.04s] listener to this podcast as well dollar
[5116.119s] path during Trump 1.0 versus Trump 2.0
[5120.0s] remains quite analogist an opportunity
[5121.8s] for the dollar rally remains in play
[5123.8s] near turn but longer term probabilities
[5125.84s] the dollar do not look favorable in the
[5127.239s] analog all this means is dollar is going
[5129.92s] down which we&#39;ve been telling you was
[5131.119s] going to happen yields are going to go
[5133.08s] down uh Emerging Markets are going to
[5135.44s] rip China&#39;s going to continue to rip
[5138.159s] rail traffic going up that&#39;s a very
[5141.199s] positive sign and then you just see
[5142.92s] again concentration going back to
[5144.36s] nifty50 Doc bubble artificial
[5146.76s] intelligence we&#39;re going to get great
[5148.32s] things from artificial intelligence the
[5149.84s] question is are you already paying for
[5151.119s] what&#39;s coming 10 years from now chart of
[5153.119s] the week us office net absorption is
[5155.52s] turning the corner we had that Vado
[5157.639s] trade quick double we got out um this is
[5160.48s] just beginning ladies and gentlemen
[5161.96s] those of you who took me up and bought
[5163.639s] some Office Buildings in the hole are
[5165.28s] probably smiling so wide you could eat a
[5167.0s] banana sideways so that&#39;s good investors
[5169.52s] haven&#39;t been this pessimistic about
[5171.04s] stock since 2023 that&#39;s just one uh
[5174.6s] metric but uh worth noting you tend to
[5177.32s] not uh correct when people are skeptical
[5180.6s] so something to keep in the back of the
[5182.36s] Mind FNS manager survey sees us equities
[5185.719s] as the most undervalued since at least
[5188.119s] 2001 uh I would quantify that and say
[5191.44s] Parts small caps for sure emerging
[5193.6s] markets for sure value over growth for
[5196.56s] sure uh mag 7 not so sure uh you know
[5200.639s] some of these AI Darlings not so sure uh
[5204.8s] China new home prices us AI Darlings not
[5208.32s] so sure China new home prices barely
[5210.32s] fall in sign Market is stabilizing the
[5213.44s] problem is now the solution economic
[5215.719s] expectations for China are rising
[5217.96s] opinion follows Trend natural gas
[5219.76s] through the roof com stock back on the
[5221.6s] Move uh we&#39;ve got this winter freeze
[5224.52s] that&#39;s coming whatever the hell it&#39;s
[5225.719s] called and then uh here&#39;s the other
[5229.119s] thing yeah you got the concentration but
[5231.159s] you used to have the earnings to support
[5232.719s] it now you got the earnings lagging the
[5234.48s] weight in the S&amp;P so the earnings weight
[5237.28s] they they produce 28% of the earnings
[5238.84s] but they&#39;re 38% of the weight that is
[5241.199s] unwinding as the mag money comes out and
[5243.84s] as overspend defensively on capex which
[5248.0s] they have yet to prove there is a return
[5250.28s] on invested Capital unless you have
[5252.32s] practical applications like meta is
[5254.6s] using it to optimize their own business
[5257.0s] and Alibaba etc etc S&amp;P 500&#39;s mostly
[5261.0s] gone nowhere since year end what&#39;s gone
[5263.44s] everywhere everything but 493
[5266.639s] International Etc small cap will be next
[5269.96s] it&#39;s my from my friend Allan light
[5271.639s] vehicle retail sales in the US from 19
[5274.159s] 1976 to
[5276.96s] 2024 and you can see this is just a
[5279.4s] normal another cycle the population&#39;s
[5282.0s] growing a ton so the Peaks keep getting
[5284.04s] higher which actually implies that and
[5286.239s] I&#39;ve been very conservative I said we&#39;ll
[5287.679s] Peak at 17 maybe we Peak at 18 or 19 we
[5290.52s] got 13 average car on the road is 13
[5292.6s] years I mean if they did like 18 my God
[5296.199s] oh my God two divide by
[5300.08s] six * 3 I mean the thing could earn 15
[5303.52s] to 18 a share I mean now I&#39;m just being
[5305.96s] crazy town like let&#39;s just get to 78 or9
[5309.28s] a share and see where we at how we&#39;re
[5311.36s] feeling at 100 but uh
[5314.88s] um it&#39;s unbelievable God bless the
[5317.52s] sandbaggers it gives us opportunities to
[5319.48s] buy incredible companies at cheap prices
[5322.32s] and then the thing goes and they don&#39;t
[5324.159s] let you in once it goes It goes ladies
[5325.92s] and gentlemen you&#39;re seeing it in real
[5327.4s] time in Baba you&#39;ve seen it in vernado
[5330.0s] you&#39;ve seen it in Wells Fargo during Co
[5332.04s] you saw it in Exxon during Co
[5335.28s] you saw it in um Rolls-Royce I mean
[5338.96s] anyway we&#39;re having fun gener what do we
[5341.48s] got here 210 buy that&#39;s from steel let&#39;s
[5343.92s] go through the sler charts
[5349.8s] here open
[5356.08s] link so look this is what I told Su this
[5359.119s] this feels like it wants to break out
[5360.8s] maybe they&#39;ll do one fake out before
[5362.48s] they take it up dollar rolling over
[5365.239s] 10year yields rolling over Staples
[5368.239s] getting bid which we talked about socks
[5370.44s] in a Range semiconductors Intel&#39;s moving
[5373.08s] like crazy uh slomer 2 where&#39;s that
[5376.36s] we&#39;ll find it this is very interesting
[5378.6s] this is from fun Strat Tom Le after each
[5381.239s] four-year time of a price consolidation
[5384.04s] phase small caps launched and rocketed
[5386.4s] higher relative valuations and earnings
[5388.239s] growth forecast lend positivity to this
[5389.96s] cycle repeating if not simply rhyming so
[5394.08s] looking back ladies and gentlemen what
[5395.8s] did we talk about you want it to be
[5397.639s] small caps here&#39;s what happened in the
[5400.92s] 2002 to 2006 period largest growth in
[5403.52s] the shortest amount of time breaks out
[5405.6s] it just goes straight up same thing in
[5408.4s] 200 the9 period straight up and now
[5411.719s] we&#39;ve just finished this consolidation
[5413.119s] we&#39;re going to break out and go straight
[5414.48s] up same thing in the uh 80s second term
[5418.119s] of Reagan same exact story straight up
[5421.32s] for many many years people think stall
[5423.199s] caps don&#39;t work cuz recency bias last
[5425.159s] four years consolidating they felt the
[5426.76s] same during this four years they felt
[5428.08s] the same during this four years and this
[5429.84s] four years and once they break out they
[5431.36s] go straight up so if you don&#39;t have
[5432.84s] small cap exposure this is your final
[5434.84s] warning ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s
[5436.44s] where you&#39;re going to get double the
[5437.88s] earnings growth Plus for half the
[5439.6s] multiple and it&#39;s just getting started
[5441.96s] you want ground floor doesn&#39;t get any
[5443.8s] more ground floor than that how&#39;s that
[5446.0s] so Trend and cycle technical uh weekly
[5450.08s] chart book let&#39;s see here we covered
[5452.48s] that Breakout equal weight moving in the
[5455.639s] right
[5457.119s] direction uh a AI this is what people
[5459.88s] saying people are most bearish since uh
[5462.239s] whatever a year ago it&#39;s nonsense by the
[5465.0s] way only like 300 people take that
[5466.76s] survey so the people that put weight on
[5468.92s] that I&#39;m you know it&#39;s it&#39;s worth
[5471.44s] glancing at but it&#39;s not um here&#39;s your
[5474.639s] small caps once it&#39;s through here they
[5477.36s] will not let anyone in maybe they go up
[5479.28s] and then they retest but start your
[5482.04s] engines start your engines ladies and

[5608.119s] first um so funny that was this was the
[5612.76s] date June 20th when we put out the
[5615.76s] article the next pain trade you you
[5619.0s] literally people were just clamoring

[5623.36s] rockstar signing people&#39;s bras and I
[5626.04s] said this is the next pain trade it was
[5627.76s] literally on this tick and you can go
[5630.119s] back and look at it article was on June
[5632.44s] 20th and uh it immediately crashed and
[5636.96s] it has not yet retaken those highs going
[5640.08s] on you know 3 quarters of a year maybe
[5643.28s] maybe it does maybe it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t

[5662.48s] got to call him and get get back out
[5664.199s] there when he&#39;s on the west coast uh K
[5666.639s] web is breaking out for those of you who
[5668.04s] want diversification Baba broke through
[5670.639s] this line I told you anyway very excited
[5674.32s] uh 10
[5675.96s] cent Philip 66 it&#39;s good to look at
[5679.48s] these things let&#39;s see
[5681.36s] V all right nothing
[5683.56s] really super standout is
[5687.52s] here re well we got the crown castle all
[5691.0s] right good stuff there uh what else do
[5694.239s] we need to talk about here 10year yield
[5696.92s] going back over value to growth this
[5699.08s] game is just starting ladies and
[5700.6s] gentlemen start your engines values
[5702.4s] outperformed growth by 4.4% per year
[5705.32s] since 1927 what does that mean in
[5707.239s] English it means that if you had
[5709.88s] invested in value over growth since 1927
[5714.8s] you put in a million dollars in each
[5716.8s] strategy you would have 68 more million
[5721.199s] dollars by investing in value so you&#39;d
[5723.32s] have ballparking now 100 to
[5726.52s] 120 uh if you invested in growth if
[5729.119s] you&#39;re lucky because you have bigger
[5730.48s] draw downs and you would have
[5733.8s] 170 with value so uh you&#39;re call because
[5738.719s] everyone is stuck in recency bias the
[5740.44s] last 15 years growth is outperformed
[5742.32s] value game has changed cap light you
[5745.0s] know uh capex light blah blah blah the
[5748.4s] game is always this way nifty50 decom it
[5751.76s] happens every single cycle just like
[5753.239s] International to domestic and sooner or
[5756.199s] later it normalizes and you revert to
[5758.159s] the mean and those who get it make
[5760.88s] fortunes and those who don&#39;t give up
[5762.719s] fortunes and that&#39;s exactly what we have
[5765.239s] Happening Now valuation skewed by a
[5767.44s] handful of mega mega cap stocks if you
[5769.199s] look at the average stock going back to
[5771.199s] 2001 levels which is generational buy
[5774.08s] financial leverage is lower than normal
[5776.0s] which is good sentiment argues for a
[5777.76s] continued upcycle in EPS we agree
[5780.8s] January February seasonality has been
[5782.36s] the weakest guidance period told you why
[5784.159s] sandbagger
[5785.92s] season uh 31% of S&amp;P companies expected
[5789.32s] to outpace the mag 7 by Q4 20125 up from
[5792.44s] just 8% in the second half broadening
[5794.96s] continues ladies and gentlemen UNM
[5797.04s] magnificent uh 493 earnings growth
[5799.96s] accelerating magnificent 7 decelerating
[5802.28s] carry trade unwinding price of the
[5804.32s] Ukraine bond is going up I don&#39;t know
[5806.32s] why we I don&#39;t know okay oh the
[5808.719s] implication is that pie is on the way
[5811.119s] that that&#39;s a good thing uh bull bear
[5812.8s] indicator not an extreme not somewhere
[5814.719s] where you want to be lightening up China
[5816.52s] not losing the AI race if anything the
[5818.52s] opposite is happening mag 7 is coming
[5820.32s] down China uh
[5822.639s] baxt ba Al Alibaba 10cent zi uh catching
[5829.159s] up tips huge inflows in the last week
[5832.239s] Europe huge inflows conclusion by Cheap
[5835.6s] stocks cheap stocks has underperformed
[5837.76s] expensive stocks ahead of Market Peaks
[5839.84s] Market Peaks is the most heavily
[5841.84s] weighted stocks indices week under the
[5844.239s] surface huge opportunity it&#39;s like when
[5846.48s] they did the cover cover about Buffett
[5848.6s] in 2000 has he lost his touch and he was
[5851.159s] buying Proctor and Gamble and he was
[5852.639s] buying cocacola and the next seven years
[5854.76s] he just blew the S&amp;P out of the water
[5856.6s] even as the NASDAQ was crashing 80 and
[5858.88s] 90% he was up huge in those years uh
[5862.92s] people think because the market crashes
[5864.639s] everything goes down it&#39;s not the case
[5866.56s] value is greater than
[5868.88s] growth uh regime change we&#39;ve covered
[5872.32s] dividend yield again we&#39;ve covered this
[5874.32s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker is a good

[5882.679s] value versus growth historical discount
[5884.56s] remains extreme since most since 2021
[5887.96s] and I&#39;m going through some of this
[5889.0s] number one to reemphasize if you&#39;ve
[5890.679s] missed the boat so far and now you see
[5892.36s] it it&#39;s all happening and you know

[6136.8s] headlines from Baron saying alcohol is
[6138.92s] done uh Cox Automotive
[6141.56s] forecast okay so this is the data that
[6144.04s] we are using uh not the sand baggery
[6147.36s] that we saw 16.3 million Cox Automotive
[6150.679s] is forecasting total new sales vehicles

[6183.84s] inventories are at record lows is
[6186.32s] sandbagger and Chief and I&#39;m saying that
[6189.159s] in a good way because we got more shares
[6192.08s] Intel stock is climbing like it did back
[6193.88s] in the 80s here&#39;s what okay we covered

[6206.719s] quantitative
[6207.96s] tightening um which could help the long
[6210.76s] end of the curve so it sounds like maybe
[6213.28s] Powell and bessent are getting in
[6215.56s] getting along uh Japan&#39;s food inflation
[6218.159s] is becoming harder for boj to overlook
[6221.76s] which means they have to do what hike
[6223.96s] faster which means
[6225.8s] what Yen strengthens which means what
[6229.119s] carry trade on wines which means what
[6231.52s] mag s underperforms which means what
[6234.0s] money goes into the stocks that we&#39;re in
[6236.4s] which is why you&#39;re seeing what you&#39;re
[6237.84s] seeing and uh clients are uh smiling so

[6289.239s] the positive outcome on CMA Jeff did a
[6293.36s] great job with that um that decision was
[6297.119s] reached and it basically quantifies the
[6300.0s] risk to 10% of the business that they
[6304.36s] just bought which is uh the grocery part
[6308.28s] of the business and they will just cut a

[6344.239s] the
[6345.28s] way uh and now turning cash flow

[6504.56s] okay Ang is from Ireland I&#39;m kidding uh
[6508.0s] hey Tom I came across you through
[6510.239s] Alibaba stock and it&#39;s probably the best
[6512.44s] dividend Alibaba has ever given me since
[6514.4s] then I&#39;ve had 100% attendance and never
[6517.159s] miss your podcast I have a question from
[6518.599s] last week&#39;s episode where you mentioned
[6520.36s] that when marginal buyers in Orange
[6521.8s] County are gone uh which I was referring
[6524.199s] to the Chinese just like the Japanese
[6525.84s] dried up in the late &#39; 80s because the
[6529.199s] Japanese Market was booming and they all
[6531.32s] had fomo in Japan and money went back to
[6533.88s] Japan uh okay continuing it could create
[6537.44s] a significant air pocket wouldn&#39;t local
[6539.32s] buyers step in when that happens given
[6541.0s] that OC is such a desirable area they
[6543.159s] didn&#39;t step in in the early 90s so look
[6545.04s] real estate&#39;s not my game so like I&#39;m a
[6547.28s] real estate tourist but I can feel
[6549.679s] extremes and this is coming from a guy
[6551.96s] I&#39;ll be it I got a great deal because I
[6553.719s] worked some magic that I always find
[6556.199s] these weird deals and bought something
[6558.0s] at a discount to what they paid in 2019
[6560.679s] which doesn&#39;t exist in OC because
[6562.199s] everything&#39;s tripled since 2019 but
[6565.239s] anyway
[6566.53s] [Music]
[6570.44s] um no you&#39;re taking out about 10% of the
[6573.28s] inventory when they step out the Chinese
[6575.199s] money has been about 10% of the
[6576.48s] inventory there&#39;s an article in the New
[6577.719s] York Times about La it&#39;s even more
[6579.96s] pronounced in OC and uh as the market
[6583.599s] goes up and opportunity comes back in
[6585.119s] China it&#39;s not that they&#39;re going to
[6586.4s] take all their money back from
[6587.84s] California it&#39;s so hard to get money out
[6589.36s] of China that what&#39;s here is staying
[6590.96s] here but that marginal buyer that keeps
[6593.0s] flooding in and parking money it&#39;s no
[6595.32s] longer going to do that because they&#39;re
[6596.52s] now seeing opportunity for the first
[6598.159s] time in China they can now buy Alibaba
[6600.4s] that doubles versus buying you know a
[6602.8s] house in Orange County where they have
[6604.239s] negative huge negative carry between
[6606.08s] taxes and maintenance fire risk or
[6608.4s] whatever else is going on um so uh so
[6613.159s] yeah I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sangin on Orange
[6614.76s] County real estate and I hope I&#39;m wrong
[6616.159s] because I own it so there you go uh I
[6620.08s] didn&#39;t make this as this was not a
[6621.679s] financial decision for me I&#39;m an East
[6623.719s] Coast guy I love it here I love swinging
[6625.679s] a golf club in January and February the
[6627.239s] People Are Awesome restaurants are
[6628.719s] awesome seeing the ocean from my home
[6630.8s] office is awesome walking to the beach
[6632.52s] is awesome but um uh I moved here for my
[6636.0s] kids and uh and they&#39;re super happy and
[6639.679s] you know and my wife is super happy
[6641.28s] happy wife happy life
[6647.0s] um okay that&#39;s an investor new investor
[6650.36s] inquiry uh new investor inquiry uh we
[6653.4s] only open so our minimum is $5 million
[6657.159s] anyone that&#39;s investing $5 million can
[6659.599s] come in any time that they want uh and
[6662.239s] can come in immediately so if you&#39;re
[6664.119s] planning on doing that great love to
[6666.96s] have the conversation see if there&#39;s a
[6668.32s] fit uh for those of you coming in at at
[6671.199s] the from time to time usually once a
[6673.84s] quarter we open up for small accounts of
[6676.239s] a million dollar or more uh and we are
[6679.32s] not open for million dollar accounts now
[6681.679s] doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have a
[6682.599s] conversation and then you can fund if we
[6684.76s] open up again in April um but that is
[6687.88s] the distinction there so
[6690.48s] um Goran says I&#39;m curious to think what
[6693.44s] you think of Celsius and their
[6695.159s] acquisition of Ali new both as investor
[6698.0s] as a father of two young athletes I
[6699.96s] think it doesn&#39;t move the needle I think
[6701.679s] Celsius is interesting uh but we haven&#39;t
[6704.76s] done anything about it
[6706.239s] yet Mike lamb selones free Cas flow
[6710.119s] bases every single week m and welcome
[6713.56s] because you must be new because we cover
[6714.92s] seles every single week and every single
[6716.719s] week we say looks pretty good we&#39;re not
[6719.079s] doing anything with it but I like the
[6721.56s] idea uh Rasheed Alim thanks to the
[6724.76s] podcast could you take a look at
[6726.48s] selik toll taker
[6729.119s] in
[6730.679s] Dubai uh all
[6734.0s] right s a l i k
[6747.599s] yeah and it&#39;s priced like a toll taker I
[6749.36s] mean the thing is up by triple cash
[6751.8s] flows are flat not for
[6753.92s] me uh
[6757.28s] next thank you for the question
[6762.32s] though I don&#39;t want to be greedy and ask
[6764.56s] you a second question on the same day
[6766.199s] but what do you think of f fsugy
[6769.679s] well let&#39;s take a look Mr I don&#39;t want
[6773.199s] to be greedy FS
[6775.4s] uy
[6782.92s] foris
[6788.239s] me FS g y I mean the pric has declined
[6793.199s] along with cat no not for me i&#39; no I&#39;d
[6798.599s] almost look at it as a short but I&#39;m not
[6800.44s] even going to go into that what do you
[6801.92s] think of
[6804.04s] Nova
[6807.4s] Nordisk
[6808.96s] no see this is all recency bias the
[6811.599s] Stock&#39;s up 10x and it pulls back you
[6814.32s] know 60 points and all of the sudden
[6815.96s] everyone&#39;s
[6817.48s] interested uh talk to me when it hits 50
[6820.88s] and my guess is it won&#39;t hit 50 so
[6822.88s] therefore I&#39;ll never be involved Alex
[6825.04s] boam take a look at shift
[6828.84s] four okay
[6840.119s] we already have a payments business no
[6843.199s] not interested because it&#39;s no no cash
[6847.079s] flow is fine but it&#39;s not growing
[6848.719s] commenor to
[6851.52s] what&#39;s let me take a look here
[6862.679s] no not
[6864.079s] interested
[6865.639s] next Don L thoughts on Cooper standard
[6869.639s] Chinese GV just go listen to the call
[6872.32s] and listen to Jeff Edwards talk about
[6875.04s] their China business in the last two
[6876.52s] calls and you will be blown away Bert
[6881.239s] Bergstrom since Baba and vfc have B had
[6884.36s] big moves for you it seems like Nike
[6886.199s] could be a China play for Capital today
[6889.52s] since what do you think about deep in
[6892.199s] the money
[6893.48s] no uh either buy the stock or nothing um
[6897.56s] because you&#39;re going to have to wait
[6898.56s] this one&#39;s going to take a long time to
[6899.8s] turn around and you don&#39;t have Brack and
[6901.36s] Daryl so uh with that said I think it&#39;s
[6904.76s] a durable enough business that uh it
[6907.28s] will recover I kind of like it here I
[6909.44s] liked it better in the low 70s uh if you
[6912.119s] get anything below 70 I think you can
[6913.719s] own it but you know these recoveries can
[6915.52s] take a long time it took six years in
[6917.32s] the late 90s when they screwed things up
[6919.199s] so I&#39;m not in a rush on that one but I
[6921.159s] think you got a good business
[6922.88s] uh and I think it&#39;s going to take a long
[6924.239s] time so uh and I&#39;ve got a great rockar
[6927.28s] with Brack and Daryl why would I want
[6928.639s] two sneaker companies go back to the
[6930.48s] quote at the beginning of the podcast
[6931.92s] about placing correlated bets and
[6934.159s] uncorrelated Bets it it would just be
[6936.04s] like doubling my VF Corp position which
[6938.4s] makes zero sense and VF Corp is a much
[6940.239s] better thing because Brack and Daryl
[6941.84s] took this company that made plastic
[6943.36s] commodity mouses and webcams and turned
[6945.8s] it into a 26 Baggers so if he can do
[6947.679s] that he can definitely take a worldclass
[6949.36s] brand like Vans that&#39;s been around since
[6951.639s] the 60s and every single Surfer every
[6954.079s] single cool person on the west coast
[6955.599s] wears and now he&#39;s going to he&#39;s
[6957.92s] destocked everything after he loaded
[6959.679s] everyone after everyone was loaded up
[6961.199s] during covid now he&#39;s launching new
[6963.079s] brands he&#39;s going to get the influencer
[6964.52s] machine going and this thing is going to
[6965.88s] rock and roll like no one&#39;s business um
[6969.119s] another client inquiry Brave
[6972.599s] Wilson what do you think about UFO and
[6974.88s] non-human intelligence as a potential
[6976.599s] investment Frontier have at it not for
[6978.56s] me I don&#39;t predict the future I buy
[6980.719s] durable businesses when they&#39;re
[6982.56s] temporarily impaired and get my doubles
[6984.04s] and triples in a few years rinse and
[6985.96s] repeat I&#39;ll leave the predicting of the
[6988.04s] future to other people uh if you like
[6990.679s] Deo you should love Sam I hate Sam I
[6994.04s] think truly and Sam Boston beer I think
[6997.079s] it&#39;s nonsense I think it was a
[6998.639s] controlled float runup not for
[7001.96s] me but thank you for that and yes it
[7004.56s] looks cheap and yes you probably get one
[7006.36s] more puff out of the cigar butt and yes
[7008.159s] that guy&#39;s smart and when he wants to
[7009.92s] finally get out for his last time he&#39;ll
[7011.84s] run this stock up but uh when&#39;s the last
[7014.76s] time you saw someone hanging out at a
[7016.159s] bar drinking at Sam Adams I mean give me
[7018.199s] a break on the on or truly for that
[7020.96s] matter everyone drinks white claw listen
[7022.88s] to the country songs you got to listen
[7024.159s] to country to know what&#39;s up all right
[7026.76s] uh the UFO boy re answered that River
[7030.0s] Rail selones every day yes we think it&#39;s
[7034.199s] okay no we&#39;re not going to own it uh
[7036.84s] Rogers telecommunication companies these
[7038.96s] are dogs I kind of like the breakup of
[7041.32s] Charter
[7042.679s] uh this one I&#39;ve looked at a million
[7044.239s] times done
[7045.36s] nothing
[7051.199s] ah this one&#39;s probably okay I I just
[7054.159s] don&#39;t like the space it&#39;s not a good
[7056.199s] business too Capital intensive too many
[7060.199s] risks
[7061.92s] uh revenues keep declining tell me when
[7064.639s] that&#39;s going to stop and turn around and
[7065.96s] I&#39;ll tell you when you should buy it but
[7067.199s] for now to pass
[7070.36s] Sufi uh
[7073.4s] oh I kind of thought something that
[7076.84s] might complement your backst position I
[7078.56s] don&#39;t complement things I don&#39;t trade
[7080.599s] correlated bets I&#39;ve got my position in
[7082.92s] healthcare and I&#39;m not going to get
[7084.639s] swayed looking at the next shiny object
[7086.8s] and getting fomo but her question is
[7089.679s] take a look at evolent Health
[7098.52s] evh thank you for the question by the
[7100.48s] way and thank you all for the question
[7103.36s] uh all right you got my attention Sufi
[7105.4s] let&#39;s take a
[7106.96s] look
[7109.96s] evh all right this thing&#39;s
[7112.4s] collapsing and now we got to figure out
[7115.0s] why because it&#39;s free cash flow positive
[7117.44s] cash flow is burn it turning over
[7118.599s] revenues are going up multiples are fine
[7122.119s] margins I can&#39;t tell but it looks like
[7124.32s] they&#39;re
[7125.96s] steady uh
[7138.599s] okay I must have done an acquisition
[7140.92s] here let&#39;s see what happened to the
[7141.96s] share
[7155.84s] count so I&#39;ve just about doubled the
[7158.079s] share count that&#39;s a red flag for me
[7160.28s] even if they use shares for the
[7163.159s] acquisition
[7166.679s] uh I don&#39;t like that I do not like that
[7169.84s] historically it&#39;s been a crap return on
[7171.76s] invested Capital business low quality
[7174.159s] business uh what&#39;s going on with free
[7176.52s] cash
[7181.52s] flow it&#39;s it&#39;s lumpy it&#39;s moving in the
[7184.56s] right
[7185.76s] direction um balance sheet 192 million
[7189.719s] of
[7191.04s] cash $600 million a day I I don&#39;t like
[7193.8s] the direction this is going so no pass
[7196.04s] it was it was interesting good try thank
[7198.119s] you for the question not for me uh many
[7200.88s] thanks for all your lessons and
[7201.96s] learnings that comes from Leo du
[7204.92s] jardan uh one
[7211.92s] with all right wondering how if you
[7214.119s] could elaborate a bit on your journey
[7215.92s] how to set up your own investment
[7217.88s] business uh
[7225.239s] okay royalty farmer I&#39;m not interested
[7226.88s] in and as far as that goes I never
[7229.159s] accepted I had no intention of starting
[7230.8s] an investment management business I was
[7232.599s] running my own money I&#39;d made enough
[7234.56s] money I was very happy just doing that
[7237.36s] uh and still is basically what I do I&#39;ve
[7239.28s] just allowed people to come alongside
[7240.719s] and benefit from my intellectual capital
[7243.32s] and um and it&#39;s just kind of grown into
[7245.639s] something way bigger than I could have
[7247.119s] imagined by accident and it continues to
[7249.159s] do so so now I&#39;m building a business and
[7250.92s] it&#39;s it&#39;s going great
[7252.56s] uh and I&#39;m very grateful for that um
[7255.8s] honestly I don&#39;t think you should take
[7257.48s] other people&#39;s money to manage until you
[7259.159s] don&#39;t need any Mage I mean candidly
[7262.079s] until you&#39;ve proven to yourself that you
[7263.88s] can compound Capital namely your own
[7266.239s] capital and you don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s
[7268.32s] capital in order to fund your living
[7270.639s] expenses because you&#39;ve already made
[7272.52s] enough money in the markets that&#39;s when
[7274.32s] you should consider investing other
[7276.679s] people&#39;s money when you&#39;ve already built
[7278.239s] your own money to a position that you
[7279.84s] don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s money and
[7281.159s] you&#39;ve proven that you know how to
[7283.48s] compound Capital um as far as starting a
[7286.96s] business from scratch to get other
[7289.04s] people&#39;s Capital to manage it so you can
[7290.8s] make
[7291.599s] money uh I mean maybe I&#39;m too rigid in
[7295.28s] my views on that I just don&#39;t think most
[7297.88s] people are qualified until they&#39;ve
[7299.599s] proven it for themselves so go work for
[7301.719s] a big firm learn your chops if you&#39;re
[7305.04s] good at it uh you&#39;ll rise up you&#39;ll make
[7307.92s] some money you&#39;ll have some Runway uh
[7310.639s] you&#39;ll have proven to yourself have
[7312.199s] confidence in your own abilities over
[7313.96s] the long term not just in a straightup
[7315.639s] market through Cycles uh and then once
[7318.719s] you&#39;ve done that and you&#39;ve got a couple
[7320.0s] gray hairs and you you got a decision on
[7323.239s] your mind do I retire or do I help other
[7325.28s] people and you you&#39;ll figure it out but
[7327.719s] uh that&#39;s the way that I would go about
[7329.679s] it so first you got to cut your teeth
[7331.52s] you got to pay your dues at least a
[7332.92s] decade working for other people and then
[7335.36s] from there um if you&#39;re good uh you&#39;ll
[7339.599s] find a way to do it so that would be my
[7342.84s] suggestion question for what are your
[7344.56s] thoughts on ssung
[7346.48s] Samsung
[7352.92s] um let&#39;s see
[7390.44s] how many Samsungs are there my gosh oh
[7392.84s] Samsung Electronics okay that makes
[7394.719s] sense
[7414.28s] looks like it&#39;s
[7417.92s] recovering probably worth doing some
[7419.76s] moreon
[7444.639s] it&#39;s not really it&#39;s not something I
[7445.96s] would do but it&#39;s probably worth doing
[7447.4s] some workon if you&#39;re interested in it
[7449.88s] um so yellow light Mark
[7453.32s] Callaway uh I know you have a position
[7456.599s] in diio could you give me your position
[7458.32s] on Constellation uh I you know no I I
[7461.76s] don&#39;t like the bear I don&#39;t like the
[7463.159s] beer business I do not like the beer
[7464.96s] business this is not Buffett this is one
[7466.559s] of his lieutenants and
[7470.36s] um it&#39;s a low margin business I like the
[7473.76s] premiumization I like the quality I I
[7476.04s] like everything di Dio&#39;s if if there&#39;s
[7478.559s] going to be recovery in alcohol which
[7480.159s] there has been cyclically for 5,000
[7482.48s] years maybe this time&#39;s different with
[7483.76s] gp1s but I&#39;m willing to bet that it&#39;s
[7485.84s] not people like to escape I think diio
[7488.28s] is going to be the winner highest margin
[7489.88s] premiumization I I don&#39;t want to ship
[7491.96s] trucks and trucks of bottles for pennies
[7494.159s] of margin it&#39;s that let someone else
[7496.52s] play that
[7497.639s] game
[7501.48s] um okay so Warren Buffett emailed me
[7504.079s] again Warren Buffett you know the guy
[7506.679s] puts his name in as Warren Buffett wants
[7508.36s] to know about ups and Polaris uh We&#39;ve
[7510.559s] covered those not yet on UPS Polaris I
[7512.96s] don&#39;t like the recreation vehicle
[7514.559s] business uh and that&#39;s that moving along
[7518.119s] uh clent this is someone in inquiring
[7520.48s] about investing
[7522.159s] uh Oscar Health
[7525.599s] yeah ah this is
[7530.8s] um kushner&#39;s Brothers thing
[7546.079s] um yeah you really have to understand
[7548.36s] this this is this is a speculative thing
[7550.8s] it&#39;s not really what I want to be
[7552.199s] involved in but it could work uh ish
