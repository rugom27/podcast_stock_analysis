## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a regime change, with a shift away from US mega-cap growth stocks towards value, small caps, and international markets, particularly China. This is driven by factors such as dollar weakness, declining yields, and a re-rating of previously unloved sectors. Sandbagging by companies is creating buying opportunities.

| China's Terrific 10 vs. Magnificent 7 | China Terrific 10 up 85% vs. Mag 7 up 81% since December 2023 | China is outperforming the US mega-caps, indicating a shift in market leadership. |
