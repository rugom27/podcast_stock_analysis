up huge on a day when the market is crashing and um and they&#39;re all like should we sell some no okay this is the same cognitive bias that people have that like um no this is where you get paid ladies and gentlemen and we haven&#39;t even started to get paid we talked about intrinsic value over the last year and a half two years when we were buying every single dip backing up the truck in the 60s okay just as the stock price vacillates around the cash flow and the intrinsic value of the business which was steady and improving over that time period when the stock was in the gutter on Headline noise it overshoots in price relative to intrinsic value on the downside it is going to dramatically overshoot in price on the upside when this thing gets going so you think oh well now you know it&#39;s going up and we&#39;re 13 times earnings this thing isn&#39;t even going to be near cooked until we&#39;re over 20 times earnings and then by then the fundamentals are going to be so going so much better that they&#39;re going to be all these analysts out there chasing on a people naming their dogs Alibaba and saying it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread the people that were telling you to sell it in the hole at 60 uh this this game is just beginning so let&#39;s hear what I had to say to Taylor a couple days before earnings here we go now Chinese president xiin ping linked up with China&#39;s private sector Chiefs today in Beijing where he stressed continuity in the country&#39;s economic development X met e-commerce giant Alibaba CEO Jack ma who was at the

chairman Thomas Hayes who I&#39;m pleased to say joins me now all right make your case for Alibaba well thank you Taylor great to be with you look this wasn&#39;t the perfect pick for us we&#39;ve been buying every single dip for the last two years we bought in the hundreds we backed up the truck in the 60s so across all accounts we at about $83 so it&#39;s had a huge run in the the last 5 weeks uh up about 50% let it rest a little bit they&#39;re going to report earnings on the 20th maybe if you get a pullback after earnings you get a chance to to get in but this is a very special company in terms of valuation number one it&#39;s the number one cloud provider in China it&#39;s also the number one AI provider which we saw in recent weeks with apple linking up stop you there and ask you cuz I just spent two hours with Kevin o on my earlier show and he said this is in effect a game changer I&#39;m those are my words not his but the fact that you have an Apple device in China using Alibaba AI shows that there actually might be a partnership between the US and China is that better for apple or better for Alibaba I think it&#39;s better for both it&#39;s the best model they beat deep seek on many metrics they beat open AI on any many metrics and apple needs the government approval in China and the government is approving Alibaba then that&#39;s just the icing on the cake let&#39;s talk about the cake uh this is a huge play on the middle class recovery uh they were in lockdown for many many years tbell and t-ball it&#39;s like being a toll taker for the bridge every dollar that the middle and upper class are going to spend in this recovery is going to go through Alibaba quite a few of those dollars are going through Alibaba and then\n###

the Chinese government Crackdown on the tech industry in recent years my countdown closer like Alibaba stock despite the company&#39;s past regulatory boo boos and it is great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes who I&#39;m pleased to say joins me now all right make your case for Alibaba well thank you Taylor great to be with you look this wasn&#39;t the perfect pick for us we&#39;ve been buying every single dip for the last two years we bought in the hundreds we backed up the truck in the 60s so across all accounts we at about $83 so it&#39;s had a huge run in the the last 5 weeks uh up

middle and upper class are going to spend in this recovery is going to go through Alibaba quite a few of those dollars are going through Alibaba and then finally  we&#39;ve always said treat Alibaba as a China AI ETF it&#39;s not just the partnership with Apple they have Equity stakes in many of the AI startups in China because they give them cloud computing service is it in exchange for equity and a lot of people don&#39;t know that oh and by the way their international business e-commerce business is growing at 40% on top of it do you know Taylor you can buy this stock at 2014 prices the difference is revenue is up 10x per share cash flow is up 6X per share and earnings are up 6X per share so at a 12 times forward multiple if it if you just rate forget about growth which they&#39;re going to have if you just rate back to a normalized multiple 24 this thing some of the parts is worth well over $200 and it&#39;s probably going to take about two plus years to get that get there in our view okay so need a little bit of a longer timeline if you want to hold on to the stock so\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nbrought an out particularly with the US and and mag 7 you still bullish well you know when we came on with you the beginning of January and I love coming on with you Taylor we said that uh maybe lien up on the mag 7 the broadening is going to continue and what do we have year to date we have S&amp;P up 4% we have mag 7 Up only 2% so uh what what have we seen we saw the last Shelby first materials have outperformed up 6.8% no you couldn&#39;t give away materials the market was up 20 some odd perc last year materials were basically flat Healthcare is up 5.3% so we definitely have some picks in those areas you got to look a little more closely this year to get that out performance than just buying the indic seeson mag 7 the theme of the last few years has been the US versus the rest of the world do you expect that to continue or do you start to like Emerging Markets yeah that was a top of the Year theme as well I I was uh privileged to speak with you about that as well well look what&#39;s happened this year Emerging Markets is up 6.2% year to date uh European Kean equities you would never guess this at the beginning of the year Taylor up 10.6% relative to the S&amp;P 500 up 4% this is a theme that is a regular theme but we&#39;re all stuck in recency bias we think US stocks are going to outperform Forever every 10 to 15 years you get huge periods of five 10 years of outperformance of international stocks you had it in the Reagan Administration I think you&#39;re going to see it in the Trump Administration as well as the dollar weakens and yields come under control so uh we love that and Alibaba is one way we&#39;re doing it just quickly here to end can the S&amp;P or Equity markets continue to Rally if we&#39;re looking at a four and a half maybe 5% on the 10e yeah I think uh bonds are the second most crowded trade be behind the mag 7 I think we&#39;re going to see a 4% on the 10year before we see 5% I know that&#39;s unconventional but as you know by now I&#39;m pretty unconventional uh and that will enable us you know the market looks like it wants to breakout here but February tends to be a choppy period I think we will get to New Highs but I think the index returns for the year are going to be a bit subdued 8 to 12% and find your opportunities elsewhere in the broadening well Tom Hayes we always appreciate you coming on thank you thank you meanwhile and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to talk to steu vanney thanks to Jack guys thanks to Christian dagger and Preston myel for having me on we&#39;re going to tune in here here want to get back to the markets yeah I&#39;ve got to tell you there&#39;s not that much price movement going on is it Dows off what 30 S&amp;P off six NASDAQ up four that&#39;s not much movement so let&#39;s bring in uh we&#39;ve got to with us this morning Thomas uh Tom Hayes sorry miss your name right Tom Hayes all right I&#39;m looking for some positives here I&#39;m trying to think that maybe what doge is doing with cutting government spending and getting into the fraud and waste and what they&#39;re doing in Saudi Arabia the US and Russia getting together for peace talks over Ukraine I&#39;m trying to think that that may be a positive for the market what say you there&#39;s no question about it Stu I think you hit the nail on the head with Doge uh this is underrated and I think the biggest surprise of this year is that the 10-year treasury yield is going to 4% before it goes to 5% and the reason being is because doge is going to continue to cut cut government spending there&#39;s going to be a lot of layoffs which is deflationary which may not be absorbed into the public sector as quickly as people think because the skills or lack thereof may not be transferable uh so as rates come down it&#39;s going to open up the opportunity for a lot of these underperforming sectors in the market the second thing that&#39;s been really positive to is earnings have blown out of the water 16.9% earnings growth compared to just 9% estimates uh for this quarter with 70 7% reported so a lot of good things happen why is the market a little bit uncertain because we&#39;re in sandbagger season which is when they take down guidance so that they can beat for the rest of the Year this is a normal seasonal occurrence we&#39;ve taken down guidance in the last few weeks the markets a little bit nervous we&#39;re in that kind of mid-February slump uh but it it feels like the market wants to break to new highs too very interesting the market wants to go up I love those words Tom Hayes thanks for joining us I&#39;m sorry so short it&#39;s a big news Tuesday we&#39;ll see you again soon Tom thanks so much and we&#39;re back I am trademarking the word sandbagger season which we just got through we&#39;re going to talk about some sandbagging later

that has been playing out uh like according to Playbook the stuff that we had said in the fourth quarter was going to take place this year and the huge switch uh has happened the regime change is in play take a listen \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nterrorists aren't the problem investor Panic is every time tariffs hit the headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\nthe market throws a Fed stock dive the media screams trade war and investors act like it&#39;s 2008 all over again but let&#39;s just take a step back are tariffs really the disaster that they&#39;re made out to be tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods to regulate trade protect domestic Industries and generate government revenue while they can be beneficial in some cases they can also have some downsides so here&#39;s a breakdown of the pros and the cons of tariffs so one it protects domestic Industries it encourages local produ production it supports domestic jobs it increases government revenues money from tariffs can be used for infrastructure health care and even National Defense or paying down the national debt it encourages domestic consumption it limits foreign dependence it strengthens National Security and protects critical Industries it reduces overall Reliance on Rival Nations I.E China trade tensions it encourages Fair Trade Practices leverages trade negotiations and can countries can use tariffs as a bargaining tool in trade agreements I.E the NAFTA renegotiation into usmca look at what&#39;s happening right now the knee-jerk reaction was ridiculous stocks tanked volatility spiked and algorithms panicked but none of it was a surprise at all I just think markets were betting on an 11th Hour deal that didn&#39;t happen but what happens when the dust settles Executives adjust trade deals get renegotiated and invest realize that the world is not ending those who stay calm and position themselves accordingly will usually win the real problem isn&#39;t tariffs it&#39;s how investors react to them if you&#39;re dumping stocks because of tariffs you&#39;re doing it all wrong if anything tariffs create an opportunity they expose which companies have pricing power which sectors can pass cost to Consumers and which ones are too fragile to survive the ones that weather the storm they become Market leaders so what should investors do instead of running for the exits pay attention to where the money is moving look at companies with strong balance sheets pricing power and diversified Supply chains watch how the industry shift this is where real opportunity is found not in panic selling but in smart positioning the bottom line tariffs are not the end of the world but emotional trading that&#39;s what really kills your returns now my next guest is a Powerhouse in the

finance ladies and Gentlemen please welcome me and joining Tom Hayes to the podcast Tom it is a pleasure to have you with me today thanks so much for having thank you for coming in from California these days yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so look there&#39;s been a lot happening in the markets right so the Market&#39;s been very volatile we&#39;ve been talking about not only this new presidency but new policies but the tus so talk to me just on on long short strategies kind of what you&#39;re thinking about when when you think about the markets and and how to position yourself yeah this is a question that we get regularly um this reminds me a lot of 2016 to 2007 what happened right after the election was entirely different than what happened after the inauguration after the election yields blew out the dollar went straight up uh Tech went down Emerging Markets went down International went down after the inauguration things normalized Tech went back up yields came down the dollar came down and you know what international and Emerging Markets outperformed in 2017 these were some surprises so why do you think that was why do you think Emerging Markets outperformed well I I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s a fear of the unknown okay this is the big thing and this creates opportunities like you said in in earlier in the segment dislocation is where you find outperformance so when people sell off due to irr respon you know it&#39;s funny I had a question we have this little company it&#39;s called Cooper standard and they manufacture Auto par s they do the ceiling systems around the uh the windows they do the fluid transfer systems and where do they manufacture they manufacture a lot in Canada they manufacture a lot in Mexico and everyone was worried is this going to hurt it I said look at the end of the day the average car on the road is 13 years old okay there&#39;s going to be a refresh no matter what no one is going to put up a half a billion dollars to stand up a factory in Minnesota uh from scratch to to produce these parts that been produced for decades from this company that&#39;s leader in the business uh even even when you when you price in the effect of tariff so at at some point you have to step back when these stocks sell off because they have exposure to China or they have exposure to Mexico or they have exposure to Canada you say wait a second if if I look back at their free cash flow in revenues two years from now it&#39;s going to be a little blip on the radar it gets evened out right and and so I think that&#39;s a very that&#39;s a very key part but I think the other part of this whole conversation is these tariffs are only going to be imposed if mexic Canada didn&#39;t come to the table to help us with a problem that&#39;s got nothing to do with with with investing right you know it&#39;s interesting this version uh Trump 2.0 is more benign than Trump 1.0 Trump 1.0 was a legitimate trade War Trump 2.0 as hasset came out and said is actually about drugs and about illegal immigration and they and they put 10,000 troops in and we said okay we&#39;re going to back off you keep the troops there probably were going to be okay right so I think the part that that caught me the other day when the markets actually had a nervous breakdown on the Monday that it wasn&#39;t like he hadn&#39;t been talking about it he talked about it for seven months during the year he talked about it before the inauguration talking about it after the inauguration he put them all on on alert that this was coming if they didn&#39;t come to the table and have this conversation nothing about nothing about trade Wars really but it was about helping us out at the border and stopping the flow and stopping the drugs right and so and so I think the market was expecting an 11th Hour deal and they didn&#39;t get it and so on that Monday you know they all had a panic attack and then suddenly Mexico comes to the table and says okay okay we&#39;re going to help and then he backs right off right so I think it I think it is a negotiating tactic 100% this is the most telegraphed surprise in history you know we say buy the rumor sell the news this was sell the rumor buy the news no question about it yeah no 100% but tell me now about he&#39;s talking about over the weekend he talked about imposing tariffs on China which have started now reciprocal tariffs I think that&#39;s really aimed at Europe reciprocal tariffs right correct correct uh I think think look China is doing the exact same thing that they did in 2016 right after the election which is they devalued the yuan in anticipation of the tariffs right so what he&#39;s put into place is actually a net zero because because they devalued the Yuan now that the tariffs are in place that you&#39;ve seen the Yuan stop going down it&#39;s starting to appreciate relative to the dollar so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of priced in and if you look at pricing people say it&#39;s going to be inflationary okay and people go go crazy in the short term for you know first couple months or whatever maybe you see something intermediate term it&#39;s net neutral and long term it&#39;s actually you&#39;ve seen in the case of washing machines and stuff prices actually go lower right but you know what&#39;s interesting is that is that it&#39;s a one if it&#39;s inflationary at all it&#39;s a one-time inflationary bump because it just adds a fixed cost to the price and then doesn&#39;t keep going up that&#39;s correct right doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a 9% inflation every you know every time you turn around it goes up once and then it adjusts right but but to your point then once it all settles in it seems to find its level yeah and you have look you have Doge which is actually taking costs out of the system which is deflationary by by Nature uh there a lot of different offsets that are coming that people are not pricing into the potential risk of inflation of tariffs and and I think you&#39;re going to see that it uh it it more than net washes and you&#39;re seeing it in bond yields by the way everyone was pushing look it&#39;s one of the two two most crowded trades right now what are it short bonds I&#39;d take the other side and long mag s which I think you got to start to moderate your view on Long mag s all right so talk about talk about why you want people why you think people should moderate their view on mag 7even because while I like the name and I like all the names and I own a lot of them I&#39;m not I&#39;m not chasing them up here at all right you got to go ahead so talk so I think you want to go where earnings growth is accelerating okay so last year earnings were the name of the game for the mag 7 okay they had 33% earnings growth which was double the market they should get double the multiple this year earnings growth is decent accelerating from 33% last year for the mag 7 down to 21% the multiple has not contracted in line with that decelerating and earnings growth rest of the market had negative earnings growth the last uh first three quarters of last year it&#39;s now accelerating and the multiple is half of the mag 7 so okay so so let&#39;s talk about that for a minute so if the multiples in the mag 7 it&#39;s decelerating if earnings are decelerating earning growth is decelerating now you know but that&#39;s that&#39;s what your analysis tells you that&#39;s just what the that&#39;s is that what all the bottom up consensus estimates yeah so earnings grow is going to decelerate from 33% to 21% and we&#39;re seeing it it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of CBS and people say that this is this is offens there&#39;s some it&#39;s defensive cback because you have no return on invested Capital yet yet that&#39;s and that&#39;s the key so for the next two years they&#39;re going to spend a lot of money and we&#39;re going to find out in three to five years if they&#39;re going to get a return on that right but they and they&#39;ve made it very clear look at the last earning season they&#39;ve all made it very clear that they&#39;re spending huge amounts of money building out AI and data centers and all that stuff which I think is going to end up coming back but it might take three to five years before they really realize the return on that investment yeah this was the first quarter since 2022 that you had 0% Revenue surprises in the mag7 so we all know what happened in 2022 with tech it was a little bit softer than people expected everyone was euphoric going into it uh we also have the highest percentage of S&amp;P components trading over 10 times sales since 2000 so there&#39;s there are a lot of multiples and a lot of metrics that point back to 2000 I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have anything like that at all but I do think we&#39;re going to have a relative slowdown in terms of uh you know those groups are going to have to consolidate their gains and and that&#39;s actually okay very healthy very healthy you can&#39;t keep you know trees don&#39;t go to the sky right 100% so they could they could underperform which which could imply the indices could be more subdued than last year maybe High single digits low double digits which also again over over historically would be fine but a lot of people look at the IND oh my God that&#39;s a failure we were only up 12% because the last two years were up 25 28% they look at plus 12% it&#39;s a failure yeah and what&#39;s so beautiful about that environment is that people are like oh man you know only 8 to 12% well under the surface you can make fortunes some of these companies that didn&#39;t perform last year because mag 7 took the air out of out of it and we started to see the rotation starting in July took a break in December big break in December kick back in in January February I think the other area you got to look at be besides uh UNM magnificent 493 relative to magnificent 7 I think you got to start to look at small caps relative to large caps okay uh why because again earnings growth acceleration so if you look at S&amp;P 600 small cap 8% earnings growth last year 21% earnings growth this year that&#39;s consensus 2 earning growth all consensus bottom up uh 15 times versus 22 times for for the indices that&#39;s interesting if you look at the Russell you go up to 55% earnings growth why because you had so many companies not earning any money and when you go from zero to 1 cent it&#39;s Infinity right right so explain that just so the audience understands when you say it&#39;s 15 times versus the markets a 22 times suggest that it&#39;s undervalued correct correct and mean meaning you can get more equivalent earnings growth for the for half the price correct okay so if the mag 7 is going to grow 21% down from 33 and small caps are going to grow 21% up from eight right and you&#39;re paying 15 for one and 33 for other well most people when they go to the store they want more for Less when they go to the stock market they say I want to I want to buy the most expensive thing ever you know W Street but then they Panic the minute the minute right they Panic right away I always say Wall Street is the only Market the only store in the world when they throw a clearance sale everyone runs out of the store and it&#39;s so funny because I always use like the bloomies analogy right when bloomies puts dresses on sale for 30% women run in there they got to buy three of them because how can you leave it on the Shelf but yet you get a name like apple or Amazon they sell off 15 or 18 or 20% and people are panicked oh my God I&#39;m going to lose all my money like are you nuts yeah I mean you&#39;re not talking about some Nano cap or or microcap you&#39;re talking about a mega cap stock corre Apple makes $124 billion every three months yeah am I missing something here yeah yeah yeah exactly but anyway so I think let because then I want to go on talk more about um uh your broader kind of view of the bond market all that stuff but let&#39;s just talk about this so when you talk about you know looking looking in other places like the last will be first I have say I have that same kind of view so tell the audience what you mean by that yeah so I think if you look at last year you look at two of the worst performing sectors uh you had Healthcare and you had materials lowest earnings growth lowest performance shocking right well this year they&#39;re going to be in the top four sectors the second and the fourth Healthcare and materials in terms of earnings growth 19% earnings growth and 17% earnings growth relative to the SNP overall 14% earnings growth in that neighborhood uh so I think we&#39;re going to see a lot of catch up from the these type of sectors that have high earnings growth low multiples and that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to see some outperformance right and these let&#39;s let&#39;s be honest though there&#39;s there&#39;s there are no names in either one of those sectors that&#39;s really sexy like you know Tech think about invid that right there&#39;s nothing in there that that screams you know I got to have you but when you think about where it&#39;s been last year with the end perform versus where it can be this year in terms of consensus estimates all this stuff there are some great opportunities in those sectors no question about it I mean one thing that one material stock and you got to look at boring ones Alba Maro okay the lithium top lithium producer lithium prices are cyclical okay Alba Maro always comes through they&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity they&#39;re taking tons of costs out of the business all of them are lowering their production and by the way we all all think of EVs and we say oh no one wants EVS anymore in the US well the global stock is going to go it&#39;s it&#39;s 100% China story because it&#39;s government subsidized it&#39;s going from 40 million to 120 million uh by 2027 all driven by China they&#39;re going to need the lithium and lithium uses are are even Beyond EVS so Alam Maro is a leader it&#39;s down materially it&#39;s got the liquidity it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going to rebound over the next two to three years not next two three minutes not next two to three weeks two to three years that&#39;s right so you have so you have to be you have to know that going in and you have to realize that you&#39;re going to put this money to work and it may take you a while to see it return but it&#39;s a great it&#39;s on sale so it needs you need toone when you can get D you know when you can get stocks down 50 60 70% that are high quality durable businesses through many cycles and you a dou in years that that is going to beat Market sing day the that&#39;s why they call me turn that&#39;s what I do for a living my man but I think that&#39;s absolutely right and that&#39;s what a lot of people Miss Right a lot of people well first of all you got a lot of people that just want they just want the names that move all the time right in the\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTech think about

all you want you&#39;re want chaos and you want all that stuff but if you&#39;re a long-term investor you really want to start to think long term and you want to think about opportunities and names that it might be boring yes but sometimes big and boring can be beautiful yes I&#39;m the captain of boring baby hold on one second let&#39;s just take a quick break and I&#39;m going to come back all right [Music] good okay so here we are we&#39;re back and I&#39;m here with Tom Hayes my good friend we&#39;ve had a very interesting conversation about the market but let&#39;s wrap it up with three essential Market tips just to keep in mind no matter which way the wind is blowing so number one you want to stay updated on policy and political developments right this week is going to make it a habit to keep a close eye on any of the policy updates or political events that could influence the market whether it&#39;s a new legislative proposal a congressional hearing or changes in regulatory stances these developments often send ripples through various sectors of the market I like to set aside sometime each morning to check the trusted new sources and government releases doing so not only helps you anticipate potential Market moves but also gives you the chance to adjust your positions if you need to and this week we&#39;re going to get you know uh uh JJ Powell is going to speak in front of Congress for the semiannual Humphrey Hawkins testimony which what may not be a market mover but there&#39;ll be lots of conversation around it number two be ready for sector rotation markets are Dynamic with money shifting from one sector to another as Tom and I discussed right um this week was a perfect example and when this happens use it to review sector performance and watch for signs that asset managers and investors rotating out of one sector while reallocating it to another now what I do when I sense that&#39;s happening is just allocate new Monies to those new sectors right I may trim it a little bit but I&#39;d rather keep the position I have built as long as the thesis remains intact for instance if economic data or political developments are favoring defensive sectors over growth oriented ones that&#39;s the cue for me to allocate new money to those sectors that will automatically rearrange the risk that I have in the portfolio uh without without me selling names that I really don&#39;t want to sell right leverage technical trigger point for timely action\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmy good friend we've had a very interesting conversation about the market but let's wrap it up with three essential Market tips just to keep in mind no matter which way the wind is blowing so number one you want to stay updated on policy and political developments right this week is going to make it a habit to keep a close eye on any of the policy updates or political events that could influence the market whether it's a new legislative proposal a congressional hearing or changes in regulatory stances these developments often send ripples through various sectors of the market I like to set aside sometime each morning to check the trusted new sources and government releases doing so not only helps you anticipate potential Market moves but also gives you the chance to adjust your positions if you need to and this week we're going to get you know uh uh JJ Powell is going to speak in front of Congress for the semiannual Humphrey Hawkins testimony which what may not be a market mover but there'll be lots of conversation around it number two be ready for sector rotation markets are Dynamic with money shifting from one sector to another as Tom and I discussed right um this week was a perfect example and when this happens use it to review sector performance and watch for signs that asset managers and investors rotating out of one sector while reallocating it to another now what I do when I sense that's happening is just allocate new Monies to those new sectors right I may trim it a little bit but I'd rather keep the position I have built as long as the thesis remains intact for instance if economic data or political developments are favoring defensive sectors over growth oriented ones that's the cue for me to allocate new money to those sectors that will automatically rearrange the risk that I have in the portfolio uh without without me selling names that I really don't want to sell right leverage technical trigger point for timely action\nfinally\n\ncombine your fundamental insights with technical analysis as you monitor policy changes and sector shifts pay attention to the key technical trigger points like support and desist resistance trend lines moving averages crossovers relative strength readings that can signal a good moment to enter or exit a position especially if you&#39;re a shorter term investor and Trader even if you&#39;re a seasoned investor these technical cues are incredibly useful for timing your trades and more precisely uh for helping you manage right they act as your internal check ensuring that your decisions are based on both the broader economic picture as well as current price action so Tom talk just a little bit about for instance those technical indicators relative strength and all that stuff yeah look we we tend to be fundamentally uh focused however we do look at some of the extremes so just as we look at extreme in price relative to the underlying fals we look at extremes from some of the indicators you discussed moving average converges slow stastics uh relative strength all the standards is it at an extreme level where you tend to see some price recoveries and then do the fundamentals based on our view of fundamental analysis support that exactly right and I think and I think as a long-term investor you kind of have to play both those sides you have to have a fundamental view you got to do your homework and have a thesis on why you&#39;re buying it but then you should also that because that&#39;s how I do it right you kind of look at the charts and see if is it overbought maybe I&#39;m going to be a little more patient if I sense it&#39;s overbought the relative strength tells me you know it&#39;s overbought it&#39;s going to come back in so I&#39;ll be a little bit more patient it helps identify extremes and for a guy named turnaround Tom that&#39;s very very important\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient that&#39;s what we do all day long here ladies and gentlemen go back and look at the previous tapes we&#39;ve got now five years of tapes pick a date listen in what were we talking about it plays out some of them played out immediately some of them took a few years but when your framework is correct and you do the work not just chase price Chase\n\nChase headlines  Chase noise Chase Momo people but actually do the work and invest in a stock the way that you would underr investing in the whole business with 100% of your net worth and you take it that seriously great things happen when you buy high quality assets when they are temporarily marked down ladies and gentlemen and then you add the patience factor and that&#39;s what puts you ahead of the pack Peter Lynch investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards and I&#39;m not talking about research like the the nonsense bs1 liners that you hear from a lot of commentators that think they&#39;ve done work on the stock but they&#39;re just ch chasing a price chart I&#39;m talking about really understanding the business doing the public filings doing the earnings calls Channel checks competition knowing what you own as if you own the whole company with 100% of your net worth moving on this is very important from Bruce ker through bitter experience I have learned that a mistake in position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading also in investing by the way if you have eight highly correlated positions then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large and so many people do this that are over their skis in Tech and mag 7 and are feeling that pain recently uh of underperformance that we&#39;re going to talk a lot about today and uh and in maybe some new ways that we haven&#39;t talked about before that set you up to avoid what&#39;s been taking place Warren Buffett I&#39;ll tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy that doesn&#39;t just mean the General market that means specific companies that make zero sense on a valuation basis that people are chasing like lemons and getting getting ready to get their heads chopped off like chickens uh be greedy when others are fear fearful like all of you who&#39;ve been sending me all these incredible notes this week and I&#39;m very grateful for that&#39;s stuck with their Baba and now you&#39;re making bank let me tell you guys do not get sucked in the Trap of because you made a little money now you want to lock in your profit that is cognitive bias it&#39;s time to get paid where did you underwrite the sum of the parts and the value of the business okay that is fair value okay if you want to take off that some value there you can do that but I&#39;m telling you right now number one we&#39;re nowhere near intrinsic value number two the price and the excitement is going to dramatically overshoot the intrinsic value the same way that it undershot the intrinsic value on the downside all these negative analysts are now flipping positive and they&#39;re going to chase it the entire way up why because a opinion follows trend is the name of the game and as my great friend Damien would say burden yourself with the facts baby so moving right along uh let&#39;s just take a look cuz I got people calling me I can&#39;t believe how much money this you know look I told you guys I was very serious about what we talked about at the turn of the year and a lot of you took me up on it and kudos to you and now everyone&#39;s all say wow we&#39;re do everything&#39;s so great blah blah blah let me tell you ladies and gentlemen we are just getting started like we haven&#39;t even begun what&#39;s going to what&#39;s going to take place in the next 12 months for people who are investors and uh you can just look at some of the names here that we&#39;ve talked about and discussed and we own in different sizes and weightings and different Expressions Etc but I just want you to get the themes down these things haven&#39;t even begun okay Advanced Auto Parts not even off the mat and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s a 30% move it&#39;s not even started Al marrow give me a break we&#39;re not even in the first inning okay these cyclical things I cannot believe all the opportunities that Co created this is a once in a 100e environment for people like me to make people like you I&#39;m now talking to my existing clients as much as we can humanly possibly make together look at Boeing okay so what it&#39;s had this huge run that we&#39;ve benefited from from 138 to 180 it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s not even getting started we&#39;ve talked about the the backlog of a half a trillion dollars we&#39;ve talked about the new C CEO Kelly ortberg we talked about all the other things and for those of you guys that down on Boeing it&#39;s very simple Southwest goes to Boeing and they say you guys have been terrible you have no quality control I cannot believe it and Boeing says I&#39;m sorry Mr Southwest we feel really bad why don&#39;t you go wait online at Airbus and you can get your next plane in 25 years I mean talk about the most beautiful business ever and they&#39;re going to fix all that stuff that&#39;s been you know it is very serious but Kelly knows how to fix it and that&#39;s why he&#39;s there he&#39;s actually an engineer versus a Salesman they\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nk Advanced Auto Parts not even off the mat and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s a 30% move it&#39;s not even started Al marrow give me a break we&#39;re not even in the first inning okay these cyclical things I cannot believe all the opportunities that Co created this is a once in a 100e environment for people like me to make people like you look at Boeing okay

actually an engineer versus a Salesman they finally  got the message Alibaba okay you guys are so unbelie like the excitement people texting me are you a soothsayer no I&#39;m not a soothsayer I read the financials and I&#39;m patient as hell and we use low leverage so that we can wait through and play the time Arbitrage game which is our huge Advantage so for those of you who think this is a big move we have not even begun next Baxter reported great earnings today why because they did what we actually said that they were going to do it took them a few months longer but they got rid of the kidney business and now they have money and now they&#39;re get their multiple is getting R-rated why because their slowest growing business is no longer part of the business and they have money to delever and all the things that we said were going to happen are starting to happen so for those of you who think wow we made so much money should we take profits these have not begun ladies and gentlemen so uh crown castle okay what&#39;s going to happen next they&#39;re going to sell the fiber business to Z for more than 8 billion they&#39;re going to buy in shares they&#39;re going to pay B down debt and those 40,000 towers are going to Mint money with zero maintenance zero capex just spitting out cash to the owners you&#39;re going to collect your 7% dividend yield while you wait oh and by the way you&#39;re probably going to get 50 to 100% capital appreciation over the next few years on top of it next Cooper standard we&#39;re going to talk about this I couldn&#39;t be more excited about this gxo we talked about last week you guys probably picked up some shares in the hole at better prices than we did I love it we did pick up a few more shares even though we backed up the truck at 42 some couple of whatever it was weeks ago we didn&#39;t get a ton at 36 cuz we had to do our work we got a few at 3839 whoop-de-do uh but we did get for all the new people that had room we got Cooper standard in the hole that&#39;s for sure and this is a b this is a business I&#39;d put tons and tons and tons of new money in without even blinking an eye comto yeah we have had you know a triple in a short period of time is a big move this one hasn&#39;t even begun okay so yeah we&#39;ll pull back maybe to 15 and this and that but look Take the Long View ladies and gentlemen and you know you tell me okay we we&#39;re partners with Jerry Jones at an equal basis to Jerry Jones because we bought in the hole he&#39;s got 67% of the company at $7 and change we&#39;re at $8 and change across the board and this game is just beginning just again 2002 to 2007 we&#39;ve talked about that a million times for those of you are new you&#39;re not going to get every single reference as long as you get the concepts you are going to be well ahead of the pack diio look Buffett just bought constellation Brands he gets it people have been drinking alcohol for 5,000 years are they drinking yes less yes is diio adapting by uh having 56% growth in the non-alcoholic cocktail business you bet are they going to recover here no question about it Disney okay everyone&#39;s like wow Disney was so great okay my friend on TV said Tom Hayes had this one in the 80s yes thank you I&#39;m very grateful we didn&#39;t get in for a move from 80 to 100 uh 10 whatever the hell it&#39;s trading at 110 this thing is going back up it&#39;s going to take a few years it&#39;ll be back over 200 bucks this is the same exact story as when the bass family bought a third of the company in 1984 because uh they were losing money because the transition to VHS tapes to monetize the Legacy IP the the cruise businesses are throwing off so much cash it&#39;s insane that you think the treasury prints money every time Disney puts up these new cruise ships the return on invested capital is insane it just prints money out to shareholders all day long and they are investing massively in that business this one&#39;s a winner for a long time and this wasn&#39;t hard to do while everyone was complaining about woke is broke okay we were buying one of the greatest businesses in the world down 60% and you could couldn&#39;t give it away so that&#39;s what we do here Estee louder new director we&#39;re going to talk about bought a ton in the hole that&#39;s what we like louder family 38% of the stock everyone says it&#39;s old women they&#39;re dying off go look at the brands actually do the work go talk to your 10 year-olds and 15y olds and ask them about the 12 Brands and tell me which ones are hot and they&#39;re going to show you the four that are flying off the shelves Etsy and by the way this is no different than VF Corp these these guys have been trading out in and out of brands for hundred you know some odd years family business just the same way that VF Corp has been doing the exact same thing and people couldn&#39;t see the forest for the trees and there you know price is down so they throw up everything in the hole and they miss the opportunities of a lifetime but again the point is these are getting started Etsy okay everyone&#39;s worried they just had record sales ever this quarter and and people are panicking in the streets while they&#39;re buying back stock generating free cash flow yeah you know yes their primary business little bit weaker than expected their new business is again buying more platforms are growing like a weed next gener okay so this was another one you couldn&#39;t give away up under 100 we&#39;re pounding the table on it it doubled to 195 okay we didn&#39;t get into it for a double this thing has 75% of the home standby generator standby generator mark Market in the US the penetration is at a level that is just getting started do you think we&#39;re going to have more weather events or less weather events um do you think the grid is going to be more stable or less stable you know the aners to both of those\n\nmassively in that business this one&#39;s a winner for a long time and this wasn&#39;t hard to do while everyone was complaining about woke is broke okay we were buying one of the greatest

increasing the take rate the guy knows what he's doing he crushed it at into it ran 50% of the revenues the thing was like a 30s something bagger and he'll do the same thing Brad Jacobs he's screwing around with Beacon Roofing eventually he'll get get a platform and this thing will be off the races and the in the meantime it's dead money and uh I think he's overpaying for Beacon rof and anyway but he needs a platform and then he'll get then he'll use the multiple Arbitrage public private so he'll overpay for the first one and then he'll buy a ton of these small fragments businesses at five times and get paid 20 times in the public markets he's done this over and over created billions of dollars of wealth for shareholders betting on the jockey another theme of turnaround Tom Stanley Black and&amp; Decker this is the best leverage play on the housing turnaround which is going to occur when as I said publicly the biggest surprise of the year is going to be 10-year yield goes to 4% first everyone called for 5% at 480 and we said no not going to happen why most crowded Trad look at the commitments of Traders reports managers most short uh 10year treasury since 2018 right before the huge rally in treasuries as rates come down this housing thing is going to Boom tons of supplies going to come on the market Stanley Black and&amp; Decker&#39;s best position with the most incredible Tools DeWalt Stanley Craftsman black and&amp; Decker you name it they own it they&#39;ve got the business they got they cut out $2 billion of cost anyway they brought the margins up from 22% to 30 they're going to 35% that's in the worst Market ever wait till that market comes back when bessent and Trump hit the 10-year yield they're not screwing around they're going to bring the 10year yield down and so is Doge by the way laying off all these people that probably don't have transferable skills into the private sector uh is going to be disinflationary and offset all the fears about inflation onetime tariffs and all this nonsense and this stock is going to fly VF Corp we've had this monster move from our basis around 15 Blended to got up to 27 almost a double faster than we expected some are faster some are slower uh again this is just getting started I hope it pulls back to 20 so we can buy more before it goes to 40 then we'll reevaluate but I think Brack and listening to him on that uh call that we played on this and some of the other stuff I think he's going to take this thing to new highs over a few years just like he did in Logitech uh came in when the stock was down 82% in 2013 8 years later you had a 26 bagger a million became 26 million biotech R rallied out of the hole this is just getting started we are going to see amazing things happen with biotech so you guys think I forget about these I listen I'm I'm doing it okay here's what we go back to records fourth quarter we'll do this one in detail in the article next week um but the name of the game here transformative sale of the kidney care business is now complete positioning company for next stage of not survival growth and Innovation this is code for multiple reating the rest of the business grows fast the kidney care business grew slow multiple goes to 12 to 16 and then all this stuff starts hitting on all cylinders they get they reignite growth and they get rid of all the distractions and they're Off to the Races and that's exactly what's going to happen alib Baba we're going to do in dramatic detail next week but uh we can cover a few key things the name of the game is their AI business is growing everything's growing quote this quarter's results demonstrated substantial progress in our user first AI driven strategies and the re acceleration growth of our core businesses

moved over there we go here&#39;s Joe Sai spoke at look at the alibaba&#39;s AI leadership conference I look I I think in fact I actually use the gro uh because I&#39;m I&#39;m on X his Twitter app and uh they provide an inter interface to grock which I use very often I&#39;m very impressed by uh the results um I also use a number of other apps uh a AI apps including our own uh the answer to your question you know this AI race who&#39;s better who a a AI is better the answer yesterday is going to be different from the answer tomorrow right now everybody is in a fairly tight race uh the next model that&#39;s going to be launched is going to be better than some but not others and then somebody else will launch something that&#39;s better than yours and we think we think that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen but what has H you mentioned deep seek and it it&#39;s quite significant uh and that&#39;s because they actually demonstrated that you can use some engineering Innovation to drastically lower the cost of training and inference of large language models uh and and up to this point people are massively investing into these Frontier models uh but here&#39;s the problem if you think about uh training of Frontier models as an Endeavor to educate your kids and you want to uh have the smartest kids uh have you know developed them so that they can uh acquire phds and not just one subject matter but 15 subject Matters from maths to physics to biology to psychology everything you want to have the smartest kids if that&#39;s the case take that into today&#39;s AI race there&#39;s maybe only five or six Rich parents that can afford to have the smartest kids um but is that something that we&#39;re really interested in it&#39;s probably not you have to start to ask yourself what is the purpose of what is the goal of develop veloping AI is this to have the smartest child so that they can win every single Nobel Prize or is it something different like there&#39;s a lot of problems in the world that need to be solved uh there&#39;s a lot of uh issues that we need to use AI to apply AI so that it can be useful and productive and make an economic impact uh so I think people are going to start when they look at the phenomenon of Deep see people are going to start shift away from all right let&#39;s stop putting in hundreds of billions of dollars into compute infrastructure so that we can train the smartest you know PhD and everything that can win the Nobel Prize let&#39;s find out what are the actual problems in the world uh and let&#39;s use AI to uh solve them so a lot of people are going to start putting resources into applications I think that&#39;s number one number two is deep SE has taught us the value of Open Source um uh you know if if today your only purpose in life is to develop a close Source uh AI system that is the smartest PhD student in everything the Nobel prize winning kid uh I personally think the value of that endeavor is approaching zero reference uh in looks like it was the world government Summit in Dubai on February 13th listen to what he had to say he&#39;s basically saying these people investing all this money without specific outcomes are probably not going to get the return on Capital read through the lines and here&#39;s what he said and we&#39;re back and now let&#39;s go through the data of the week okay some of my favorite charts right here ladies and gentlemen number one China&#39;s terrific 10 they now have a name for it Alibaba 10 cent mawan zi byd JD n b gie smic now is beating the Magnificent 7 if you look at the performance of the mag 7 between the China terrific 10 since December 2023 we are now beating the Magnificent 7 ladies and gentlemen up 85% versus the mag 7 Up 81% and at the same time what could be more beautiful than record short interest ready to get absolutely monkey hammered as we rip higher and as I said what did I say ladies and gentlemen they won&#39;t once it breaks through they won&#39;t let anyone in and that&#39;s exactly it&#39;s even surprised me how little they&#39;ve let people in as as enthusiastic as I&#39;ve been no different than go back and listen I was just as enthus if not more enthusiastic when it was at 60 than now when it&#39;s at 135 or 140 whatever it hit this morning um there you go gener\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nChina&#39;s terrific 10 they now have a name for it Alibaba 10 cent mawan zi byd JD n b gie smic now is beating the Magnificent 7 if you look at the performance of the mag 7 between the China terrific 10 since December 2023 we are now beating the Magnificent 7 ladies and gentlemen up 85% versus the mag 7 Up 81% and at the same time what could be more beautiful than record short interest ready to get absolutely monkey hammered as we rip higher and as I said what did I say ladies and gentlemen they won&#39;t once it breaks through they won&#39;t let anyone in and that&#39;s exactly it&#39;s even surprised me how little they&#39;ve let people in as as enthusiastic as I&#39;ve been no different than go back and listen I was just as enthus if not more enthusiastic when it was at 60 than now when it&#39;s at 135 or 140 whatever it hit this morning um there you go gener here is  from don&#39;t know but they put a 10 $210 price Target I think it&#39;s Steel on gener uh if I could avoid this is from Peter Lynch one up on Wall Street if I could avoid a single stock it would be the hottest stock in the hottest industry the one that gets the most favorable publicity the one that every investor hears about in the car poool or on the commuter train and succumbing to the social pressure often B I don&#39;t need to say more about those there&#39;s a handful of them you know what they are and there are couple outside the mag that um Good Luck uh Domestic Auto inventories I show this because you know Jeff Edwards over at Cooper standard love him met him many times uh sandbagger and chief okay this guy is trying to tell me not trying to tell me it&#39;s what they publicly released that um production volumes can lag behind SAR in a meaningful way number one that is false if you actually overlay the data back 20 years SAR and production volumes always converge and number two when you have record low domestic inventory Tories you can&#39;t give me the story that the the Divergence is it&#39;s not like the inventories are up here and uh you know they&#39;re selling but they stop producing because there&#39;s so many days of inventory we&#39;re at record low days of inventory ladies and gentlemen they may think they want lower inventories but once the game is on and the incentives race to the bottom and the oem&#39;s margins compressed uh they are going to be producing cars and the reason I&#39;m emphasizing this ladies and gentlemen is because the credible predictors of USR are at 16.2 million and 16.3 million cars for 2025 and Cooper standard thinks it&#39;s credible to publish a number of 15.1 million for you us production because SNP whatever said a month ago that that could be the production because we have so much inventory does this look like so much inventory to you this is sandbagger ISM at its finest and I understand why they&#39;re doing it because the oems are starting to get pressed on margins and they don&#39;t want to say come take our honey pot so I get it but I&#39;m telling you as massive shareholders ERS like I am okay I put my money where my mouth is I eat my own cooking I have a material material position alongside all of my clients and yes the the uh um initial base is 550 but I&#39;m telling you I would put money I would put new money to work till the cows come home at these levels because here&#39;s why in 2017 they had 17.1 million SAR not produ number excuse my language but like this was such a sandbagger ISM it was crazy town okay um every 300,000 cars now by the way they used to make my whole model was predicated on them making $150 a car now they&#39;re all hybrids and EVS they make more per car they&#39;re making $190 a car okay so and they&#39;ve cut $600 million of cost out of their business I mean it&#39;s insan you you could hear he was giddy at the end of the call but he&#39;s got to like keep it under wraps because you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a great business they will have two years where they make so much money it will be insane and then the oems will come to take that money back it happens every single cycle we will be out when they&#39;re making more money than God uh but in 2017 Cooper sander traded $146 on $719 of earnings on 17.1 million us SAR we&#39;re probably going to do 162 SAR this 151 production is complete and uh which probably means they&#39;ll do like 159 to 16 production even being conservative I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they did 162 uh and their Break Even is like 157 it&#39;s actually even lower now you can go through the call I mean he&#39;s like if volumes don&#39;t even grow we&#39;re going to get our EA to 270 million um so so on 162 if I&#39;m right I think they could earn $4 a share on that God forbid we get to 165 or back to 17 and and forget about earning 719 I think they&#39;ll earn 9 or 10 bucks so in 2017 at the cycle Peak on $7 they got a 20 times as multiple as $146 stock so let&#39;s say they do $9 and they get a trough multiple 10 times instead of 20 times if they get 20 times they trade at 180 bucks if they get 10 times they trade at 90 bucks if they get 15 times they trade in between there okay so 135 whatever 135 so the point is the stock is trading at $15 I don&#39;t need to say a whole lot more this was modeled after Charlie munger&#39;s Teno deal uh Teno was in the whole normal cyclical business he put in 10 million turned it into 80 gave the 80 to leel Loop put it in China stocks 80 million becomes 500 million we&#39;re doing the exact same Playbook ladies and gentlemen ton

HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\nChinese stocks on track to beat Indian peers for the third month what did we say all last year Japanese and Indian was Asian hot money that needed somewhere to hide once the China game turns on it&#39;s all flooding back to China and they&#39;re going to be left for dead at uh 12 month lows in uh India uh here we go uh highest since 2022 we&#39;ve now blown through that in terms of Chinese stocks Bank of Japan set to offload all stocks bought during during the financial crisis losing momentum company guidance Trails analyst estimates by the most in the this is the I mean can&#39;t they read their own chart q1 every single year they take down guidance why the secret to happiness is low expectations both in life and in the stock market and all these sandbagger and Chiefs that get paid for beating earnings take their guidance down and then they beat the next four quarters and they look like Geniuses and that&#39;s exactly what is happening right now as I said to sue it is sandbagger season here we go and annual S&amp;P 500 profit Outlook hasn&#39;t budged for 2026 uh uh so while estimates have come down for 2025 2026 is going up uh investors hit pause on the Trump trade while Chinese stocks race ahead you can see the dramatic outperformance over the S&amp;P over Bitcoin over the dollar is now turning negative as we anticipated election dollar yields go up in inauguration dollar starts to roll over yields start to roll over according to Playbook asset manager most bullish on Yen since March of 2021 this is just beginning ladies and gentlemen Yen up carry trade on wine mag 7 suffer incentives the number one leading indicator of Auto volumes have been going straight up since July 2022 car prices have stopped going up this is the formula for Camelot when it comes to being an auto part supplier Cooper standard incentives up volumes up Cooper standard get paid by the car not by uh the oem&#39;s margin they will be erased to the bottom in margins why because they are healthc care and annuity companies masquerading as car producers Hong Kong outperforms the NASDAQ by a wide margin back from the dead Chinese stocks are still cheap compared to their past still trading at 12 times earnings normalized Peak cycle 20 times greatest companies 25 30 times we&#39;re just beginning auto loan repayments as a share of after tax wages and salaries are at or below 2019 levels for Millennials and gen Z all of the th all of the chips are falling into place government spending back above 7 trillion that&#39;s going to change very quickly with douge us debt is poised to exceed post World War II era Peak this is sell the rumor by the news ladies and gentlemen this is uh people always extrapolate these extremes this is a peak just like we saw post World War II they&#39;ll run inflation hot they&#39;ll take spending down uh run growth hot and um we&#39;re going to have huge nominal growth in the next four years let let me just tell you that hang on to your hats labor force participation rate tends to diverge this is really interesting we&#39;ve been worried about the labor force participation work but it&#39;s largely skewed to the 55 and overs that never re-entered the the 25 to 54 are doing what they need to do 84% labor force participation rate so that&#39;s very promising to see uh what are we looking at here Japanese 10-year government bond yield every single week this goes up what does that mean every single week the carry trade gets pressured and money pulls out of the mag 7 free money is no longer free ladies and gentlemen um got that oh this is just showing H H sang is now outperforming the local uh csi300 in China some of that has to do with the stock connect as we anticipated with Baba we&#39;ve had 20 billion dollars of flows into Baba from Mainland we you guys knew tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today we were covering that over the summer uh nifty 50 here&#39;s India okay all that hot money is coming out going back to China ladies and gentlemen just the be early days more L cargos are arriving at Europe Shores so that&#39;s going to help C stock resources okay this is interesting everyone used this chart this week to say that we&#39;re at a top maybe we are maybe we&#39;re not I don&#39;t know the market was down a lot we we had a great day um but what they failed to realize is this was the exact same cash level actually the last two times you had cash levels this low were super duper bullish uh that was 2004 uh and 2011 okay now did you have it in 2007 yeah so people it&#39;s mindboggling they look at most of these instances 2011 2013 203 were very very very bullish for a very long time and all they do is look at the one instance where it didn&#39;t work and say cash levels are low we&#39;re going to crash okay sell everything to me in the whole thank you very much uh most bullish developments in 2025 China growth picks up people are now looking at what happens to the global economy if China growth accelerates and by the way news flash it is here&#39;s uh Tesla is Automotive Revenue by year so look you can see it here it is rolling over uh this is not good at all unless you believe in robots and if you believe in robots and you believe in autonomous then you take a flyer on this guy we&#39;ve never been long it we&#39;ve never been short it it&#39;s not what we do we stay in our lane we do turnaround times doubles and triples off the lows two three years rinse and repeat compound money and don&#39;t worry about predicting the future cast Freight index is a little bit low keeping an eye on that GDP estimates came down to the mid 223s a lot of this is probably predicated on tariff fears which people can&#39;t actually model until you know what exactly is happening Euro Zone economy fair to touch better than first estimated in Q4 data shows China January Bank lending hits record high on policy stimulus X and Jack ma chat seen as next Catalyst for blistering rally not only did they invite Jack ma to speak at the G conference it&#39;s my understanding they give Jack ma an award big change topof the market in 2021 uh when Alibaba was 320 the Chinese government wanted to take uh Jack ma behind the shed and shoot him now they&#39;re giving him Awards the game is back on why they need him you can&#39;t have 20% of your 25-year-old educated students unemployed and rioting in the streets the number one job of a position of a politician is to stay in power and they fig figure that out and We&#39;re Off to the Races so uh we they just they just took more pain for a longer period of time than we thought that they would but sooner or later survival kicks in and boom we&#39;re off and when it comes it comes all at once as we always like to say equal weight versus aggregate S&amp;P annualized 10year returns we see this inflection point just like we saw in when what have you been covering 2001 which was the greatest period

gained 3% by Valentine&#39;s Day the rest of the year 198 up 16% 91 up 14% 966 9820 and 20201 okay that is a fun fact worth noting deep seek boosting Chinese stocks okay you can see and by the way it&#39;s not every Chinese stock it&#39;s picking the right one uh and Alibaba is leading the pack in the scheme of the you know magnificent 10 over there or whatever they&#39;re calling that tremendous 10 uh bull markets last longer than you think so our current bull market is 28 months old the average since 1949 this is from Ryan Dietrich is 67 months and the longest one which started in 87 is 148 months so this could be very early days and we are in that camp we&#39;ve covered the average amount of 20% Corrections is one every 4.1 years we had two in two years 2020 and 2022 so we basically pulled 8 years of that forward uh so we should have some some blue skies at least for another couple of years into the midterm uh this Market might be two but it is still young so we covered that uh again young bull market all this ah here we go this is uh Seth and he&#39;s a listener to this podcast as well dollar path during Trump 1.0 versus Trump 2.0 remains quite analogist an opportunity for the dollar rally remains in play near turn but longer term probabilities the dollar do not look favorable in the analog all this means is dollar is going down which we&#39;ve been telling you was going to happen yields are going to go down uh Emerging Markets are going to rip China&#39;s going to continue to rip rail traffic going up that&#39;s a very positive sign and then you just see again concentration going back to nifty50 Doc bubble artificial intelligence we&#39;re going to get great things from artificial intelligence the question is are you already paying for what&#39;s coming 10 years from now chart of the week us office net absorption is turning the corner we had that Vado trade quick double we got out um this is just beginning ladies and gentlemen those of you who took me up and bought some Office Buildings in the hole are probably smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways so that&#39;s good investors haven&#39;t been this pessimistic about stock since 2023 that&#39;s just one uh metric but uh worth noting you tend to not uh correct when people are skeptical so something to keep in the back of the Mind FNS manager survey sees us equities as the most undervalued since at least 2001 uh I would quantify that and say Parts small caps for sure emerging markets for sure value over growth for sure uh mag 7 not so sure uh you know some of

for China are rising opinion follows Trend natural gas through the roof com stock back on the Move uh we&#39;ve got this winter freeze that&#39;s coming whatever the hell it&#39;s called and then uh here&#39;s the other thing yeah you got the concentration but you used to have the earnings to support it now you got the earnings lagging the weight in the S&P so the earnings weight they they produce 28% of the earnings but they&#39;re 38% of the weight that is unwinding as the mag money comes out and as overspend defensively on capex which they have yet to prove t\n\nyields are going to

small cap will be next it&#39;s my from my friend Allan light vehicle retail sales in the US from 19 1976 to 2024 and you can see this is just a normal another cycle the population&#39;s growing a ton so the Peaks keep getting higher which actually implies that and I&#39;ve been very conservative I said we&#39;ll Peak at 17 maybe we Peak at 18 or 19 we got 13 average car on the road is 13 years I mean if they did like 18 my God oh my God two divide by six * 3 I mean the thing could earn 15 to 18 a share I mean now I&#39;m just being crazy town like let&#39;s just get to 78 or9 a share and see where we at how we&#39;re feeling at 100 but uh um it&#39;s unbelievable God bless the sandbaggers it gives us opportunities to buy incredible companies at cheap prices and then the thing goes and they don&#39;t let you in once it goes It goes ladies and gentlemen you&#39;re seeing it in real time in Baba you&#39;ve seen it in vernado you&#39;ve seen it in Wells Fargo during Co you saw it in Exxon during Co you saw it in um Rolls-Royce I mean anyway we&#39;re having fun gener what do we got here 210 buy that&#39;s from steel let&#39;s go through the sler charts here open link so look this is what I told Su this this feels like it wants to break out maybe they&#39;ll do one fake out before they take it up dollar rolling over 10year yields rolling over Staples getting bid which we talked about socks in a Range semiconductors Intel&#39;s moving like crazy uh slomer 2 where&#39;s that we&#39;ll find it this is very interesting this is from fun Strat Tom Le after each four-year time of a price consolidation phase small caps launched and rocketed higher relative valuations and earnings growth forecast lend positivity to this cycle repeating if not simply rhyming so looking back ladies and gentlemen what did we talk about you want it to be small caps here&#39;s what happened in the 2002 to 2006 period largest growth in the shortest amount of time breaks out it just goes straight up same thing in 200 the9 period straight up and now we&#39;ve just finished this consolidation we&#39;re going to break out and go straight up same thing in the uh 80s second term of Reagan same exact story straight up for many many years people think stall caps don&#39;t work cuz recency bias last four years consolidating they felt the same during this four years they felt the same during this four years and this four years and once they break out they go straight up so if you don&#39;t have small cap exposure this is your final warning ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to get double the earnings growth Plus for half the multiple and it&#39;s just getting started you want ground floor doesn&#39;t get any more ground floor than that how&#39;s that so Trend and cycle technical uh weekly chart book let&#39;s see here we covered that Breakout equal weight moving in the right direction uh a AI this is what people saying people are most bearish since uh whatever a year ago it&#39;s nonsense by the way only like 300 people take that survey so the people that put weight on that I&#39;m you know it&#39;s it&#39;s worth glancing at but it&#39;s not um here&#39;s your small caps once it&#39;s through here they will not let anyone in maybe they go up and then they retest but start your engines start your engines ladies and gentlemen okay uh Europe breaking out that wasn&#39;t on anyone&#39;s Bingo cards at the beginning of the year except for us who said International would start to outperform and when that starts it happens every 10 to 15 years it&#39;s going to last 10 to 15 years and people are going to say wow that was the opportunity of a lifetime and most people won&#39;t get it till eight years in and then we&#39;ll be selling our shares to them so you heard it here my all of this is opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms uh we don&#39;t know what you should do we work exclusively with family offices ultra high net worth accredited investors uh we all we&#39;re sharing is what we&#39;re doing not what you should do uh or anything of the like um okay what else we got here Tokyo week hasn&#39;t been able to get off the boil Hong Kong breaking out uh hangsang rocking and rolling 10e yield coming down coming down rolling over the Looney coming back like a phoenix From the Ashes wait till you get a new CEO in place when Wayne Gretzky takes over Canada this thing is gonna rock it all right what WTI Crude Futures uh apologies to all my Canadian friends um uh WTI Crude oil futur just been in this range drill baby drill that&#39;s a hard one there&#39;s going to be opportunity in servicers I just don&#39;t know when and I&#39;ll keep an eye on them uh gold have at it enjoy copper if I had to play gold or copper I&#39;d probably play copper that&#39;s to play on China but it&#39;s already moved uh wheat rolling over and I think that&#39;s pretty much okay so now he goes through a number of names PayPal looks like it&#39;s at resistance here on this whatever 50-day moving aage average I would put new money to work there even if it goes a little lower first um so funny that was this was the date June 20th when we put out the article the next pain trade you you literally people were just clamoring they were signing Jensen Wong was like a rockstar signing people&#39;s bras and I said this is the next pain trade it was literally on this tick and you can go back and look at it article was on June 20th and uh it immediately crashed and it has not yet retaken those highs going on you know 3 quarters of a year maybe maybe it does maybe it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not I&#39;m not paying that 50 time sales have had it um no no I&#39;m happy with Intel uh kweb my buddy Brendan ahar rock and roll great golfer can&#39;t by the way uh anyway got to got to call him and get get back out there when he&#39;s on the west coast uh K web is breaking out for those of you who want diversification Baba broke through this line I told you anyway very excited uh 10 cent Philip 66 it&#39;s good to look at these things let&#39;s see V all right nothing really super standout is here re well we got the crown castle all right good stuff there uh what else do we need to talk about here 10year yield going back over value to growth this game is just starting ladies and gentlemen start your engines values outperformed growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 what does that mean in English it means that if you had invested in value over growth since 1927 you put in a million dollars in each strategy you would have 68 more million dollars by investing in value so you&#39;d have ballparking now 100 to 120 uh if you invested in growth if you&#39;re lucky because you have bigger draw downs and you would have 170 with value so uh you&#39;re call because everyone is stuck in recency bias the last 15 years growth is outperformed value game has changed cap light you know uh capex light blah blah blah the game is always this way nifty50 decom it happens every single cycle just like International to domestic and sooner or later it normalizes and you revert to the mean and those who get it make fortunes and those who don&#39;t give up fortunes and that&#39;s exactly what we have Happening Now valuation skewed by a handful of mega mega cap stocks if you look at the average stock going back to 2001 levels which is generational buy financial leverage is lower than normal which is good sentiment argues for a continued upcycle in EPS we agree January February seasonality

it&#39;s probably the best dividend Alibaba has ever given me since then I&#39;ve had 100% attendance and never miss your podcast I have a question from last week&#39;s episode where you mentioned that when marginal buyers in Orange County are gone uh which I was referring to the Chinese just like the Japanese dried up in the late &#39; 80s because the Japanese Market was booming and they all had fomo in Japan and money went back to Japan uh okay continuing it could create a significant air pocket wouldn&#39;t local buyers step in when that happens given that OC is such a desirable area they didn&#39;t step in in the early 90s so look real estate&#39;s not my game so like I&#39;m a real estate tourist but I can feel extremes and this is coming from a guy I&#39;ll be it I got a great deal because I worked some magic that I always find these weird deals and bought something at a discount to what they paid in 2019 which doesn&#39;t exist in OC because everything&#39;s tripled since 2019 but anyway [Music] um no you&#39;re taking out about 10% of the inventory when they step out the Chinese money has been about 10% of the inventory there&#39;s an article in the New York Times about La it&#39;s even more pronounced in OC and uh as the market goes up and opportunity comes back in China it&#39;s not that they&#39;re going to take all their money back from California it&#39;s so hard to get money out of China that what&#39;s\n\n caller Nick Take a Bow Tom take a goddamn bow on Baba okay that is very kind to you Nick and uh I appreciate that we&#39;re not bowing anything because the game hasn&#39;t even started with Baba we&#39;ll talk about that above 200 but for now we just sit tight and we transfer money from the impatient to the patient and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re part of Baba train man you deserve it you&#39;ve been with us and uh kudos to you uh next question goes to uh Ang woo okay Ang is from Ireland I&#39;m kidding uh hey Tom I came across you through Alibaba stock and it&#39;s probably the best dividend Alibaba has ever given me since then I&#39;ve had 100% attendance and never miss your podcast I have a question from last week&#39;s episode where you mentioned that when marginal buyers in Orange County are gone uh which I was referring to the Chinese just like the Japanese dried up in the late &#39; 80s because the Japanese Market was booming and they all had fomo in Japan and money went back to Japan uh okay continuing it could create a significant air pocket wouldn&#39;t local buyers step in when that happens given that OC is such a desirable area they didn&#39;t step in in the early 90s so look real estate&#39;s not my game so like I&#39;m a real estate tourist but I can feel extremes and this is coming from a guy I&#39;ll be it I got a great deal because I worked some magic that I always find these weird deals and bought something at a discount to what they paid in 2019 which doesn&#39;t exist in OC because everything&#39;s tripled since 2019 but anyway um no you&#39;re taking out about 10% of the inventory when they step out the Chinese money has been about 10% of the inventory there&#39;s an article in the New York Times about La it&#39;s even more pronounced in OC and uh as the market goes up and opportunity comes back in China it&#39;s not that they&#39;re going to take all their money back from California it&#39;s so hard to get money out of China that what&#39;s here is  staying here but that marginal buyer that keeps flooding in and parking money it&#39;s no longer going to do that because they&#39;re now seeing opportunity for the first time in China they can now buy Alibaba that doubles versus buying you know a house in Orange County where they have negative huge negative carry between taxes and maintenance fire risk or whatever else is going on um so uh so yeah I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sangin on Orange County real estate and I hope I&#39;m wrong because I own it so there you go uh I didn&#39;t make this as this was not a financial decision for me I&#39;m an East Coast guy I love it here I love swinging a golf club in January and February the People Are Awesome restaurants are awesome seeing the ocean from my home office is awesome walking to the beach is awesome but um uh I moved here for my kids and uh and they&#39;re super happy and you know and my wife is super happy happy wife happy life um okay that&#39;s an investor new investor inquiry uh new investor inquiry uh we only open so our minimum is $5 million anyone that&#39;s investing $5 million can come in any time that they want uh and can come in immediately so if you&#39;re planning on doing that great love to have the conversation see if there&#39;s a fit uh for those of you coming in at at the from time to time usually once a quarter we open up for small accounts of a million dollar or more uh and we are not open for million dollar accounts now doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have a conversation and then you can fund if we open up again in April um but that is the distinction there so um Goran says I&#39;m curious to think what you think of Celsius and their acquisition of Ali new both as investor as a father of two young athletes I think it doesn&#39;t move the needle I think Celsius is interesting uh but we haven&#39;t done anything about it yet Mike lamb selones free Cas flow bases every single week m and welcome because you must be new because we cover seles every single week and every single week we say looks pretty good we&#39;re not doing anything with it but I like the idea uh Rasheed Alim thanks to the podcast could you take a look at selik toll taker in Dubai uh all right s a l i k yeah and it&#39;s priced like a toll taker I mean the thing is up by triple cash flows are flat not for me uh next thank you for the question though I don&#39;t want to be greedy and ask you a second question on the same day but what do you think of f fsugy well let&#39;s take a look Mr I don&#39;t want to be greedy FS uy foris me FS g y I mean the pric has declined along with cat no not for me uh no I&#39;d almost look at it as a short but I&#39;m not even going to go into that what do you think of Nova Nordisk no see this is all recency bias the Stock&#39;s up 10x and it pulls back you know 60 points and all of the sudden everyone&#39;s interested uh talk to me when it hits 50 and my guess is it won&#39;t hit 50 so therefore I&#39;ll never be involved Alex boam take a look at shift four okay we already have a payments business no not interested because it&#39;s no no cash flow is fine but it&#39;s not growing commenor to what&#39;s let me take a look here no not interested next Don L thoughts on Cooper standard Chinese GV just go listen to the call and listen to Jeff Edwards talk about their China business in the last two calls and you will be blown away Bert Bergstrom since Baba and vfc have B had big moves for you it seems like Nike could be a China play for Capital today since what do you think about deep in the money no uh either buy the stock or nothing um because you&#39;re going to have to wait this one&#39;s going to take a long time to turn around and you don&#39;t have Brack and Daryl so uh\n\nthink it doesn&#39;t move the needle I think Celsius is interesting uh but we haven&#39;t done anything about it yet Mike lamb selones free Cas flow bases every single week m and welcome because you must be new because we cover seles every single week and every single week we say looks pretty good we&#39;re not doing anything with it but I like

to turn around and you don&#39;t have Brack and Daryl so uhwith that said  I think it&#39;s a durable enough business that uh it will recover I kind of like it here I liked it better in the low 70s uh if you get anything below 70 I think you can own it but you know these recoveries can take a long time it took six years in the late 90s when they screwed things up so I&#39;m not in a rush on that one but I think you got a good business uh and I think it&#39;s going to take a long time so uh and I&#39;ve got a great rockar with Brack and Daryl why would I want two sneaker companies go back to the quote at the beginning of the podcast about placing correlated bets and uncorrelated Bets it it would just be like doubling my VF Corp position which makes zero sense and VF Corp is a much better thing because Brack and Daryl took this company that made plastic commodity mouses and webcams and turned it into a 26 Baggers so if he can do that he can definitely take a worldclass brand like Vans that&#39;s been around since the 60s and every single Surfer every single cool person on the west coast wears and now he&#39;s going to he&#39;s destocked everything after he loaded everyone after everyone was loaded up during covid now he&#39;s launching new brands he&#39;s going to get the influencer machine going and this thing is going to rock and roll like no one&#39;s business um another client inquiry Brave Wilson what do you think about UFO and non-human intelligence as a potential investment Frontier have at it not for me I don&#39;t predict the future I buy durable businesses when they&#39;re temporarily impaired and get my doubles and triples in a few years rinse and repeat I&#39;ll leave the predicting of the future to other people uh if you like Deo you should love Sam I hate Sam I think truly and Sam Boston beer I think it&#39;s nonsense I think it was a controlled float runup not for me but thank you for that and yes it looks cheap and yes you probably get one more puff out of the cigar butt and yes that guy&#39;s smart and when he wants to\n\nI think it&#39;s a durable enough business that uh it will recover I kind of like it here I liked it better in the low

probably get one more puff out of the cigar butt and yes that guy&#39;s smart and when he wants to finally get out for his last time he&#39;ll run this stock up but uh when&#39;s the last time you saw someone hanging out at a bar drinking at Sam Adams I mean give me a break on the on or truly for that matter everyone drinks white claw listen to the country songs you got to listen to country to know what&#39;s up all right uh the UFO boy re answered that River Rail selones every day yes we think it&#39;s okay no we&#39;re not going to own it uh Rogers telecommunication companies these are dogs I kind of like the breakup of Charter uh this one I&#39;ve looked at a million times done nothing ah this one&#39;s probably okay I I just don&#39;t like the space it&#39;s not a good business too Capital intensive too many risks uh revenues keep declining tell me when that&#39;s going to stop and turn around and I&#39;ll tell you when you should buy it but for now to pass Sufi uh oh I kind of thought something that might complement your backst position I don&#39;t complement things I don&#39;t trade correlated bets I&#39;ve got my position in healthcare and I&#39;m not going to get swayed looking at the next shiny object and getting fomo but her question is take a look at evolent Health evh thank you for the question by the way and thank you all for the question uh all right you got my attention Sufi let&#39;s take a look evh all right this thing&#39;s collapsing and now we got to figure out why because it&#39;s free cash flow positive cash flow is burn it turning over revenues are going up multiples are fine margins I can&#39;t tell but it looks like they&#39;re steady uh okay I must have done an acquisition here let&#39;s see what happened to the share count so I&#39;ve just about doubled the share count that&#39;s a red flag for me even if they use shares for the acquisition uh I don&#39;t like that I do not like that historically it&#39;s been a crap return on invested Capital business low quality business uh what&#39;s going on with free cash flow it&#39;s it&#39;s lumpy it&#39;s moving in the right direction um balance sheet 192 million of cash $600 million a day I I don&#39;t like the direction this is going so no pass it was it was interesting good try thank you for the question not for me uh many thanks for all your lessons and learnings that comes from Leo du jardan uh one with all right wondering how if you could elaborate a bit on your journey how to set up your own investment business uh okay royalty farmer I&#39;m not interested in and as far as that goes I never accepted I had no intention of starting an investment management business I was running my own money I&#39;d made enough money I was very happy just doing that uh and still is basically what I do I&#39;ve just allowed people to come alongside and benefit from my intellectual capital and um and it&#39;s just kind of grown into something way bigger than I could have imagined by accident and it continues to do so so now I&#39;m building a business and it&#39;s it&#39;s going great uh and I&#39;m very grateful for that um honestly I don&#39;t think you should take other people&#39;s money to manage until you don&#39;t need any Mage I mean candidly until you&#39;ve proven to yourself that you can compound Capital namely your own capital and you don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s capital in order to fund your living expenses because you&#39;ve already made enough money in the markets that&#39;s when you should consider investing other people&#39;s money when you&#39;ve already built your own money to a position that you don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s money and you&#39;ve proven that you know how to compound Capital um as far as starting a business from scratch to get other people&#39;s Capital to manage it so you can make money uh I mean maybe I&#39;m too rigid in my views on that I just don&#39;t think most people are qualified until they&#39;ve proven it for themselves so go work for a big firm learn your chops if you&#39;re good at it uh you&#39;ll rise up you&#39;ll make some money you&#39;ll have some Runway uh you&#39;ll have proven to yourself have confidence in your own abilities over the long term not just in a straightup market through Cycles uh and then once you&#39;ve done that and you&#39;ve got a couple gray hairs and you you got a decision on your mind do I retire or do I help other people and you you&#39;ll figure it out but uh that&#39;s the way that I would go about it so first you got to cut your teeth you got to pay your dues at least a decade working for other people and then from there um if you&#39;re good uh you&#39;ll find a way to do it so that would be my suggestion question for what are your thoughts on ssung Samsung um let&#39;s see how many Samsungs are there my gosh oh Samsung Electronics okay that makes sense looks like it&#39;s recovering probably worth doing some moreon it&#39;s not really it&#39;s not something I would do but it&#39;s probably worth doing some workon if you&#39;re interested in it um so yellow light Mark Callaway uh I know you have a position in diio could you give me your position on Constellation uh I you know no I I don&#39;t like the bear I don&#39;t like the beer business I do not like the beer business this is not Buffett this is one of his lieutenants and um it&#39;s a low margin business I like the premiumization I like the quality I I like everything di Dio&#39;s if if there&#39;s going to be recovery in alcohol which there has been cyclically for 5,000 years maybe this time&#39;s different with gp1s but I&#39;m willing to bet that it&#39;s not people like to escape I think diio is going to be the winner highest margin premiumization I I don&#39;t want to ship trucks and trucks of bottles for pennies of margin it&#39;s that let someone else play that game um okay so Warren Buffett emailed me again Warren Buffett you know the guy puts his name in as Warren Buffett wants to know about ups and Polaris uh We&#39;ve covered those not yet on UPS Polaris I don&#39;t like the recreation vehicle business uh and that&#39;s that\n\n###

always family first then we&#39;ll get\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\ndown to business\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally got to join my friend Kenny pocari on his new show on Yahoo called Trader talk Talking tariffs this was a great theme that we've emphasized over and over that has been playing out uh like according to Playbook the stuff that we had said in the fourth quarter was going to take place this year and the huge switch uh has happened the regime change is in play take a listen \n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nterrorists aren't the problem investor Panic is every time tariffs hit the headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTech think about invid that right there&#39;s nothing in there that that screams you know I got to have you but when you think about where it&#39;s been last year with the end perform versus where it can be this year in terms of consensus estimates all this stuff there are some great opportunities in those sectors no question about it I mean one thing that one material stock and you got to look at boring ones Alba Maro okay the lithium top lithium producer lithium prices are cyclical okay Alba Maro always comes through they&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity they&#39;re taking tons of costs out of the business all of them are lowering their production and by the way we all all think of EVs and we say oh no one wants EVS anymore in the US well the global stock is going to go it&#39;s it&#39;s 100% China story because it&#39;s government subsidized it&#39;s going from 40 million to 120 million uh by 2027 all driven by China they&#39;re going to need the lithium and lithium uses are are even Beyond EVS so Alam Maro is a leader it&#39;s down materially it&#39;s got the liquidity it&#39;s going to it&#39;s going to rebound over the next two to three years not next two three minutes not next two to three weeks two to three years that&#39;s right so you have so you have to be you have to know that going in and you have to realize that you&#39;re going to put this money to work and it may take you a while to see it return but it&#39;s a great it&#39;s on sale so it needs you need toone when you can get D you know when you can get stocks down 50 60 70% that are high quality durable businesses through many cycles and you a dou in years that that is going to beat Market sing day the that&#39;s why they call me turn that&#39;s what I do for a living my man but I think that&#39;s absolutely right and that&#39;s what a lot of people Miss Right a lot of people well first of all you got a lot of people that just want they just want the names that move all the time right in the\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines  the headin suck from in it&#39;s like a magnet that&#39;s right but if you&#39;re a long-term investor if you&#39;re a day trader that&#39;s fine that&#39;s all you want you&#39;re want chaos and you want all that stuff but if you&#39;re a long-term investor you really want to start to think long term and you want to think about opportunities and names that it might be boring yes but sometimes big and boring can be beautiful yes I&#39;m the captain of boring baby hold on one second let&#39;s just take a quick break and I&#39;m going to come back all right [Music] good okay so here we are we&#39;re back and I&#39;m here with Tom Hayes my good friend we&#39;ve had a very interesting conversation about the market but let&#39;s wrap it up with three essential Market tips just to keep in mind no matter which way the wind is blowing so number one you want to stay updated on policy and political developments right this week is going to make it a habit to keep a close eye on any of the policy updates or political events that could influence the market whether it&#39;s a new legislative proposal a congressional hearing or changes in regulatory stances these developments often send ripples through various sectors of the market I like to set aside sometime each morning to check the trusted new sources and government releases doing so not only helps you anticipate potential Market moves but also gives you the chance to adjust your positions if you need to and this week we&#39;re going to get you know uh uh JJ Powell is going to speak in front of Congress for the semiannual Humphrey Hawkins testimony which what may not be a market mover but there&#39;ll be lots of conversation around it number two be ready for sector rotation markets are Dynamic with money shifting from one sector to another as Tom and I discussed right um this week was a perfect example and when this happens use it to review sector performance and watch for signs that asset managers and investors rotating out of one sector while reallocating it to another now what I do when I sense that&#39;s happening is just allocate new Monies to those new sectors right I may trim it a little bit but I&#39;d rather keep the position I have built as long as the thesis remains intact for instance if economic data or political developments are favoring defensive sectors over growth oriented ones that&#39;s the cue for me to allocate new money to those sectors that will automatically rearrange the risk that I have in the portfolio uh without without me selling names that I really don&#39;t want to sell right leverage technical trigger point for timely action\n\n###

rate tends to diverge this is really interesting we&#39;ve been worried about the labor force participation work but it&#39;s largely skewed to the 55 and overs that never re-entered the the 25 to 54 are doing what they need to do 84% labor force participation rate so that&#39;s very promising to see uh what are we looking at here Japanese 10-year government bond yield every single week this goes

are maybe we&#39;re not I don&#39;t know the market was down a lot we we had a great day um but what they failed to realize is this was the exact same cash level actually the last two times you had cash levels this low were super duper bullish uh that was 2004 uh and 2011 okay now did you have it in 2007 yeah so people it&#39;s mindboggling they look at most of these instances 2011 2013 203 were very very very bullish for a very long time and all they do is look at the one instance where it didn&#39;t work and say cash levels are low we&#39;re going to crash okay sell everything to me in the whole thank you very much uh most bullish developments in 2025 China growth picks up people are now looking at what happens to the global economy if China growth accelerates and by the way news flash it is here&#39;s uh Tesla is Automotive Revenue by year so look you can see it here it is rolling over uh this is not good at all unless you believe in robots and if you believe in robots and you believe in autonomous then you take a flyer on this guy we&#39;ve never been long it we&#39;ve never been short it it&#39;s not what we do we stay in our lane we do turnaround times doubles and triples off the lows two three years rinse and repeat compound money and don&#39;t worry about predicting the future cast Freight index is a little bit low keeping an eye on that GDP estimates came

months booming fun fact that just happened this is from uh Seth golden only five times in S&P history as S&P undercut December low and then gained 3% by Valentine&#39;s Day the rest of the year 198 up 16% 91 up 14% 966 9820 and 20201 okay that is a fun fact worth noting deep seek boosting Chinese stocks okay you can see and by the way it&#39;s not every Chinese stock it&#39;s picking the right one uh and Alibaba is leading the pack in the scheme of the you know magnificent 10 over there or whatever they&#39;re calling that tremendous 10 uh bull markets last longer than you think so our current bull market is 28 months old the average since 1949 this is from Ryan Dietrich is 67 months and the longest one which started in 87 is 148 months so this could be very early days and we are in that camp we&#39;ve covered the average amount of 20% Corrections is one every 4.1 years we had two in two years 2020 and 2022 so we basically pulled 8 years of that forward uh so we should have some some blue skies at least for another couple of years into the midterm uh this Market might be two but it is still young so we covered that uh again young bull market all this ah here we go this is uh Seth and he&#39;s a listener to this podcast as well dollar path during Trump 1.0 versus Trump 2.0 remains quite analogist an opportunity for the dollar rally remains in play near turn but longer term probabilities the dollar do not look favorable in the analog all this means is dollar is going down which we&#39;ve been telling you was going to happen yields are going to go down uh Emerging Markets are going to rip China&#39;s going to continue to rip rail traffic going up that&#39;s a very positive sign and then you just see again concentration going back to nifty50 Doc bubble artificial intelligence we&#39;re going to get great things from artificial intelligence the question is are you already paying for what&#39;s coming 10 years from now chart of the week us office net absorption is turning the corner we had that Vado trade quick double we got out um this is just beginning ladies and gentlemen those of you who took me up and bought some Office Buildings in the hole are probably smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways so that&#39;s good investors haven&#39;t been this pessimistic about stock since 2023 that&#39;s just one uh metric but uh worth noting you tend to not uh correct when people are skeptical so something to keep in the back of the Mind FNS manager survey sees us equities as the most undervalued since at least 2001 uh I would quantify that and say Parts small caps for sure emerging markets for sure value over growth for sure uh mag 7 not so sure uh you know some of these AI Darlings not so sure uh China new home prices us AI Darlings

used to have the earnings to support it now you got the earnings lagging the weight in the S&P so the earnings weight they they produce 28% of the earnings but they&#39;re 38% of the weight that is

excited uh a couple more things uh let&#39;s talk about some of this stuff first we&#39;re going to get to the media want to thank Jack rean and Jake Mack over at the clay and countdown for having me on with Taylor rigs who&#39;s just awesome to talk about my favorite subject in the whole world which is Aly uh well as I say with well uh as I say with my uh Round Table of friends Ali effing Baba uh so uh for those of you who&#39;ve been around I I am justified in saying that it has been an unbelievable run here uh and just getting started and I want to emphasize this is super duper important because the first thing that I&#39;ve had everyone&#39;s all so excited smiling so wide we can eat a banana sideways you know there&#39;s nothing like being up huge on a day when the market is crashing and um and they&#39;re all like should we sell some no okay this is the same cognitive bias that people have that like um no this is where you get paid ladies and gentlemen and we haven&#39;t even started to get paid we talked about intrinsic value over the last year and a half two years when we were buying every single dip backing up the truck in the 60s okay just as the stock price vacillates around the cash flow and the intrinsic value of the business which was steady and improving over that time period when the stock was in the gutter on Headline noise it overshoots in price relative to intrinsic value on the downside it is going to dramatically overshoot in price on the upside when this thing gets going so you think oh well now you know it&#39;s going up and we&#39;re 13 times earnings this thing isn&#39;t even going to be near cooked until we&#39;re over 20 times earnings and then by then the fundamentals are going to be so going so much better that they&#39;re going to be all these analysts out there chasing on a people naming their dogs Alibaba and saying it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread the people that were telling you to sell it in the hole at 60 uh this this game is just beginning so let&#39;s hear what I had to say to Taylor a couple days before earnings here we go now Chinese president xiin ping linked up with China&#39;s private sector Chiefs today in Beijing where he stressed continuity in the country&#39;s economic development X met e-commerce giant Alibaba CEO Jack ma who was at the center of the Chinese government Crackdown on the tech industry in recent years my countdown closer like Alibaba stock despite the company&#39;s past regulatory boo boos and it is great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes who I&#39;m pleased to say joins me now all right make your case for Alibaba well thank you Taylor great to be with you look this wasn&#39;t the perfect pick for us we&#39;ve been buying every single dip for the last two years we bought in the hundreds we backed up the truck in the 60s so across all accounts we at about $83 so it&#39;s had a huge run in the the last 5 weeks uh up about 50% let it rest a little bit they&#39;re going to report earnings on the 20th maybe if you get a pullback after earnings you get a chance to to get in but this is a very special company in terms of valuation number one it&#39;s the number one cloud provider in China it&#39;s also the number one AI provider which we saw in recent weeks with apple linking up stop you there and ask you cuz I just spent two hours with Kevin o on my earlier show and he said this is in effect a game changer I&#39;m those are my words not his but the fact that you have an Apple device in China using Alibaba AI shows that there actually might be a partnership between the US and China is that better for apple or better for Alibaba I think it&#39;s better for both it&#39;s the best model they beat deep seek on many metrics they beat open AI on any many metrics and apple needs the government approval in China and the government is approving Alibaba then that&#39;s just the icing on the cake let&#39;s talk about the cake uh this is a huge play on the middle class recovery uh they were in lockdown for many many years tbell and t-ball it&#39;s like being a toll taker for the bridge every dollar that the middle and upper class are going to spend in this recovery is going to go through Alibaba quite a few of those dollars are going through Alibaba and then\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nthis is what we do here that&#39;s what we&#39;re

we&#39;re going to get to the media want to thank Jack rean and Jake Mack over at the clay and countdown for having me on with Taylor rigs who&#39;s just awesome to talk about my favorite subject in the whole world which is Aly uh well as I say with well uh as I say with my uh Round Table of friends Ali effing Baba uh so uh for those of you who&#39;ve been around I I am justified in saying that it has been an unbelievable run here uh and just getting started and I want to emphasize this is super duper important because the first thing that I&#39;ve had everyone&#39;s all so excited smiling so wide we can eat a banana sideways you know there&#39;s nothing like being up huge on a day when the market is crashing and um and they&#39;re all like should we sell some no okay this is the same cognitive bias that people have that like um no this is where you get paid ladies and gentlemen and we haven&#39;t even started to get paid we talked about intrinsic value over the last year and a half two years when we were buying every single dip backing up the truck in the 60s okay just as the stock price vacillates around the cash flow and the intrinsic value of the business which was steady and improving over that time period when the stock was in the gutter on Headline noise it overshoots in price relative to intrinsic value on the downside it is going to dramatically overshoot in price on the upside when this thing gets going so you think oh well now you know it&#39;s going up and we&#39;re 13 times earnings this thing isn&#39;t even going to be near cooked until we&#39;re over 20 times earnings and then by then the fundamentals are going to be so going so much better that they&#39;re going to be all these analysts out there chasing on a people naming their dogs Alibaba and saying it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread the people that were telling you to sell it in the hole at 60 uh this this game is just beginning so let&#39;s hear what I had to say to Taylor a couple days before earnings here we go now Chinese president xiin ping linked up with China&#39;s private sector Chiefs today in Beijing where he stressed continuity in the country&#39;s economic development X met e-commerce giant Alibaba CEO Jack ma who was at the center of the Chinese government Crackdown on the tech industry in recent years my countdown closer like Alibaba stock despite the company&#39;s past regulatory boo boos and it is great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes who I&#39;m pleased to say joins me now all right make your case for Alibaba well thank you Taylor great to be with you look this wasn&#39;t the perfect pick for us we&#39;ve been buying every single dip for the last two years we bought in the hundreds we backed up the truck in the 60s so across all accounts we at about $83 so it&#39;s had a huge run in the the last 5 weeks uh up about 50% let it rest a little bit they&#39;re going to report earnings on the 20th maybe if you get a pullback after earnings you get a chance to to get in but this is a very special company in terms of valuation number one it&#39;s the number one cloud provider in China it&#39;s also the number one AI provider which we saw in recent weeks with apple linking up stop you there and ask you cuz I just spent two hours with Kevin o on my earlier show and he said this is in effect a game changer I&#39;m those are my words not his but the fact that you have an Apple device in China using Alibaba AI shows that there actually might be a partnership between the US and China is that better for apple or better for Alibaba I think it&#39;s better for both it&#39;s the best model they beat deep seek on many metrics they beat open AI on any many metrics and apple needs the government approval in China and the government is approving Alibaba then that&#39;s just the icing on the cake let&#39;s talk about the cake uh this is a huge play on the middle class recovery uh they were in lockdown for many many years tbell and t-ball it&#39;s like being a toll taker for the bridge every dollar that the middle and upper class are going to spend in this recovery is going to go through Alibaba quite a few of those dollars are going through Alibaba and then\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthere&#39;s no question about it Stu I think you hit the nail on the head with Doge uh this is underrated and I think the biggest surprise of this year is that the 10-year treasury yield is going to 4% before it goes to 5% and the reason being is because doge is going to continue to cut cut government spending there&#39;s going to be a lot of layoffs which is deflationary which may not be absorbed into the public sector as quickly as people think because the skills or lack thereof may not be transferable uh so as rates come down it&#39;s going to open up the opportunity for a lot of these underperforming sectors in the market the second thing that&#39;s been really positive to is earnings have blown out of the water 16.9% earnings growth compared to just 9% estimates uh for this quarter with 70 7% reported so a lot of good things happen why is the market a little bit uncertain because we&#39;re in sandbagger season which is when they take down guidance so that they can beat for the rest of the Year this is a normal seasonal occurrence we&#39;ve taken down guidance in the last few weeks the markets a little bit nervous we&#39;re in that kind of mid-February slump uh but it it feels like the market wants to break to new highs too very interesting the market wants to go up I love those words Tom Hayes thanks for joining us I&#39;m sorry so short it&#39;s a big news Tuesday we&#39;ll see you again soon Tom thanks so much and we&#39;re back I am trademarking the word sandbagger season which we just got through

go through Alibaba quite a few of those dollars are going through Alibaba and then finally  we&#39;ve always said treat Alibaba as a China AI ETF it&#39;s not just the partnership with Apple they have Equity stakes in many of the AI startups in China because they give them cloud computing service is it in exchange for equity and a lot of people don&#39;t know that oh and by the way their international business e-commerce business is growing at 40% on top of it do you know Taylor you can buy this stock at 2014 prices the difference is revenue is up 10x per share cash flow is up 6X per share and earnings are up 6X per share so at a 12 times forward multiple if it if you just rate forget about growth which they&#39;re going to have if you just rate back to a normalized multiple 24 this thing some of the parts is worth well over $200 and it&#39;s probably going to take about two plus years to get that get there in our view okay so need a little bit of a longer timeline if you want to hold on to the stock so\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nbrought an out particularly with the US and and mag 7 you still bullish well you know when we came on with you the beginning of January and I love coming on with you Taylor we said that uh maybe lien up on the mag 7 the broadening is going to continue and what do we have year to date we have S&amp;P up 4% we have mag 7 Up only 2% so uh what what have we seen we saw the last Shelby first materials have outperformed up 6.8% no you couldn&#39;t give away materials the market was up 20 some odd perc last year materials were basically flat Healthcare is up 5.3% so we definitely have some picks in those areas you got to look a little more closely this year to get that out performance than just buying the indic seeson mag 7 the theme of the last few years has been the US versus the rest of the world do you expect that to continue or do you start to like Emerging Markets yeah that was a top of the Year theme as well I I was uh privileged to speak with you about that as well well look what&#39;s happened this year Emerging Markets is up 6.2% year to date uh European Kean equities you would never guess this at the beginning of the year Taylor up 10.6% relative to the S&amp;P 500 up 4% this is a theme that is a regular theme but we&#39;re all stuck in recency bias we think US stocks are going to outperform Forever every 10 to 15 years you get huge periods of five 10 years of outperformance of international stocks you had it in the Reagan Administration I think you&#39;re going to see it in the Trump Administration as well as the dollar weakens and yields come under control so uh we love that and Alibaba is one way we&#39;re doing it just quickly here to end can the S&amp;P or Equity markets continue to Rally if we&#39;re looking at a four and a half maybe 5% on the 10e yeah I think uh bonds are the second most crowded trade be behind the mag 7 I think we&#39;re going to see a 4% on the 10year before we see 5% I know that&#39;s unconventional but as you know by now I&#39;m pretty unconventional uh and that will enable us you know the market looks like it wants to breakout here but February tends to be a choppy period I think we will get to New Highs but I think the index returns for the year are going to be a bit subdued 8 to 12% and find your opportunities elsewhere in the broadening well Tom Hayes we always appreciate you coming on thank you thank you meanwhile and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to talk to steu vanney thanks to Jack guys thanks to Christian dagger and Preston myel for having me on we&#39;re going to tune in here here want to get back to the markets yeah I&#39;ve got to tell you there&#39;s not that much price movement going on is it Dows off what 30 S&amp;P off six NASDAQ up four that&#39;s not much movement so let&#39;s bring in uh we&#39;ve got to with us this morning Thomas uh Tom Hayes sorry miss your name right Tom Hayes all right I&#39;m looking for some positives here I&#39;m trying to think that maybe what doge is doing with cutting government spending and getting into the fraud and waste and what they&#39;re doing in Saudi Arabia the US and Russia getting together for peace talks over Ukraine I&#39;m trying to think that that may be a positive for the market what say you there&#39;s no question about it Stu I think you hit the nail on the head with Doge uh this is underrated and I think the biggest surprise of this year is that the 10-year treasury yield is going to 4% before it goes to 5% and the reason being is because doge is going to continue to cut cut government spending there&#39;s going to be a lot of layoffs which is deflationary which may not be absorbed into the public sector as quickly as people think because the

interesting the market wants to go up I love those words Tom Hayes thanks for joining us I&#39;m sorry so short it&#39;s a big news Tuesday we&#39;ll see you again soon Tom thanks so much and we&#39;re back I am trademarking the word sandbagger season which we just got through we&#39;re going to talk about some sandbagging later in this podcast and then\n\nthe market throws a Fed stock dive the media screams trade war and investors act like it&#39;s 2008 all over again but let&#39;s just take a step back are tariffs really the disaster that they&#39;re made out to be tariffs are taxes imposed on imported goods to regulate trade protect domestic Industries and generate government revenue while they can be beneficial in some cases they can also have some downsides so here&#39;s a breakdown of the pros and the cons of tariffs so one it protects domestic Industries it encourages local produ production it supports domestic jobs it increases government revenues money from tariffs can be used for infrastructure health care and even National Defense or paying down the national debt it encourages domestic consumption it limits foreign dependence it strengthens National Security and protects critical Industries it reduces overall Reliance on Rival Nations I.E China trade tensions it encourages Fair Trade Practices leverages trade negotiations and can countries can use tariffs as a bargaining tool in trade agreements I.E the NAFTA renegotiation into usmca look at what&#39;s happening right now the knee-jerk reaction was ridiculous stocks tanked volatility spiked and algorithms panicked but none of it was a surprise at all I just think markets were betting on an 11th Hour deal that didn&#39;t happen but what happens when the dust settles Executives adjust trade deals get renegotiated and invest realize that the world is not ending those who stay calm and position themselves accordingly will usually win the real problem isn&#39;t tariffs it&#39;s how investors react to them if you&#39;re dumping stocks because of tariffs you&#39;re doing it all wrong if anything tariffs create an opportunity they expose which companies have pricing power which sectors can pass cost to Consumers and which ones are too fragile to survive the ones that weather the storm they become Market leaders so what should investors do instead of running for the exits pay attention to where the money is moving look at companies with strong balance sheets pricing power and diversified Supply chains watch how the industry shift this is where real opportunity is found not in panic selling but in smart positioning the bottom line tariffs are not the end of the world but emotional trading that&#39;s what really kills your returns now my next guest is a Powerhouse in the

finance ladies and Gentlemen please welcome me and joining Tom Hayes to the podcast Tom it is a pleasure to have you with me today thanks so much for having thank you for coming in from California these days yeah that&#39;s right that&#39;s right so look there&#39;s been a lot happening in the markets right so the Market&#39;s been very volatile we&#39;ve been talking about not only this new presidency but new policies but the tus so talk to me just on on long short strategies kind of what you&#39;re thinking about when when you think about the markets and and how to position yourself yeah this is a question that we get regularly um this reminds me a lot of 2016 to 2007 what happened right after the election was entirely different than what happened after the inauguration after the election yields blew out the dollar went straight up uh Tech went down Emerging Markets went down International went down after the inauguration things normalized Tech went back up yields came down the dollar came down and you know what international and Emerging Markets outperformed in 2017 these were some surprises so why do you think that was why do you think Emerging Markets outperformed well I I think that it&#39;s it&#39;s a fear of the unknown okay this is the big thing and this creates opportunities like you said in in earlier in the segment dislocation is where you find outperformance so when people sell off due to irr respon you know it&#39;s funny I had a question we have this little company it&#39;s called Cooper standard and they manufacture Auto par s they do the ceiling systems around the uh the windows they do the fluid transfer systems and where do they manufacture they manufacture a lot in Canada they manufacture a lot in Mexico and everyone was worried is this going to hurt it I said look at the end of the day the average car on the road is 13 years old okay there&#39;s going to be a refresh no matter what no one is going to put up a half a billion dollars to stand up a factory in Minnesota uh from scratch to to produce these parts that been produced for decades from this company that&#39;s leader in the business uh even even when you when you price in the effect of tariff so at at some point you have to step back when these stocks sell off because they have exposure to China or they have exposure to Mexico or they have exposure to Canada you say wait a second if if I look back at their free cash flow in revenues two years from now it&#39;s going to be a little blip on the radar it gets evened out right and and so I think that&#39;s a very that&#39;s a very key part but I think the other part of this whole conversation is these tariffs are only going to be imposed if mexic Canada didn&#39;t come to the table to help us with a problem that&#39;s got nothing to do with with with investing right you know it&#39;s interesting this version uh Trump 2.0 is more benign than Trump 1.0 Trump 1.0 was a legitimate trade War Trump 2.0 as hasset came out and said is actually about drugs and about illegal immigration and they and they put 10,000 troops in and we said okay we&#39;re going to back off you keep the troops there probably were going to be okay right so I think the part that that caught me the other day when the markets actually had a nervous breakdown on the Monday that it wasn&#39;t like he hadn&#39;t been talking about it he talked about it for seven months during the year he talked about it before the inauguration talking about it after the inauguration he put them all on on alert that this was coming if they didn&#39;t come to the table and have this conversation nothing about nothing about trade Wars really but it was about helping us out at the border and stopping the flow and stopping the drugs right and so and so I think the market was expecting an 11th Hour deal and they didn&#39;t get it and so on that Monday you know they all had a panic attack and then suddenly Mexico comes to the table and says okay okay we&#39;re going to help and then he backs right off right so I think it I think it is a negotiating tactic 100% this is the most telegraphed surprise in history you know we say buy the rumor sell the news this was sell the rumor buy the news no question about it yeah no 100% but tell me now about he&#39;s talking about over the weekend he talked about imposing tariffs on China which have started now reciprocal tariffs I think that&#39;s really aimed at Europe reciprocal tariffs right correct correct uh I think think look China is doing the exact same thing that they did in 2016 right after the election which is they devalued the yuan in anticipation of the tariffs right so what he&#39;s put into place is actually a net zero because because they devalued the Yuan now that the tariffs are in place that you&#39;ve seen the Yuan stop going down it&#39;s starting to appreciate relative to the dollar so that&#39;s that&#39;s kind of priced in and if you look at pricing people say it&#39;s going to be inflationary okay and people go go crazy in the short term for you know first couple months or whatever maybe you see something intermediate term it&#39;s net neutral and long term it&#39;s actually you&#39;ve seen in the case of washing machines and stuff prices actually go lower right but you know what&#39;s interesting is that is that it&#39;s a one if it&#39;s inflationary at all it&#39;s a one-time inflationary bump because it just adds a fixed cost to the price and then doesn&#39;t keep going up that&#39;s correct right doesn&#39;t it&#39;s not like it&#39;s a 9% inflation every you know every time you turn around it goes up once and then it adjusts right but but to your point then once it all settles in it seems to find its level yeah and you have look you have Doge which is actually taking costs out of the system which is deflationary by by Nature uh there a lot of different offsets that are coming that people are not pricing into the potential risk of inflation of tariffs and and I think you&#39;re going to see that it uh it it more than net washes and you&#39;re seeing it in bond yields by the way everyone was pushing look it&#39;s one of the two two most crowded trades right now what are it short bonds I&#39;d take the other side and long mag s which I think you got to start to moderate your view on Long mag s all right so talk about talk about why you want people why you think people should moderate their view on mag 7even because while I like the name and I like all the names and I own a lot of them I&#39;m not I&#39;m not chasing them up here at all right you got to go ahead so talk so I think you want to go where earnings growth is accelerating okay so last year earnings were the name of the game for the mag 7 okay they had 33% earnings growth which was double the market they should get double the multiple this year earnings growth is decent accelerating from 33% last year for the mag 7 down to 21% the multiple has not contracted in line with that decelerating and earnings growth rest of the market had negative earnings growth the last uh first three quarters of last year it&#39;s now accelerating and the multiple is half of the mag 7 so okay so so let&#39;s talk about that for a minute so if the multiples in the mag 7 it&#39;s decelerating if earnings are decelerating earning growth is decelerating now you know but that&#39;s that&#39;s what your analysis tells you that&#39;s just what the that&#39;s is that what all the bottom up consensus estimates yeah so earnings grow is going to decelerate from 33% to 21% and we&#39;re seeing it it&#39;s it&#39;s a function of CBS and people say that this is this is offens there&#39;s some it&#39;s defensive cback because you have no return on invested Capital yet yet that&#39;s and that&#39;s the key so for the next two years they&#39;re going to spend a lot of money and we&#39;re going to find out in three to five years if they&#39;re going to get a return on that right but they and they&#39;ve made it very clear look at the last earning season they&#39;ve all made it very clear that they&#39;re spending huge amounts of money building out AI and data centers and all that stuff which I think is going to end up coming back but it might take three to five years before they really realize the return on that investment yeah this was the first quarter since 2022 that you had 0% Revenue surprises in the mag7 so we all know what happened in 2022 with tech it was a little bit softer than people expected everyone was euphoric going into it uh we also have the highest percentage of S&amp;P components trading over 10 times sales since 2000 so there&#39;s there are a lot of multiples and a lot of metrics that point back to 2000 I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to have anything like that at all but I do think we&#39;re going to have a relative slowdown in terms of uh you know those groups are going to have to consolidate their gains and and that&#39;s actually okay very healthy very healthy you can&#39;t keep you know trees don&#39;t go to the sky right 100% so they could they could underperform which which could imply the indices could be more subdued than last year maybe High single digits low double digits which also again over over historically would be fine but a lot of people look at the IND oh my God that&#39;s a failure we were only up 12% because the last two years were up 25 28% they look at plus 12% it&#39;s a failure yeah and what&#39;s so beautiful about that environment is that people are like oh man you know only 8 to 12% well under the surface you can make fortunes some of these companies that didn&#39;t perform last year because mag 7 took the air out of out of it and we started to see the rotation starting in July took a break in December big break in December kick back in in January February I think the other area you got to look at be besides uh UNM magnificent 493 relative to magnificent 7 I think you got to start to look at small caps relative to large caps okay uh why because again earnings growth acceleration so if you look at S&amp;P 600 small cap 8% earnings growth last year 21% earnings growth this year that&#39;s consensus 2 earning growth all consensus bottom up uh 15 times versus 22 times for for the indices that&#39;s interesting if you look at the Russell you go up to 55% earnings growth why because you had so many companies not earning any money and when you go from zero to 1 cent it&#39;s Infinity right right so explain that just so the audience understands when you say it&#39;s 15 times versus the markets a 22 times suggest that it&#39;s undervalued correct correct and mean meaning you can get more equivalent earnings growth for the for half the price correct okay so if the mag 7 is going to grow 21% down from 33 and small caps are going to grow 21% up from eight right and you&#39;re paying 15 for one and 33 for other well most people when they go to the store they want more for Less when they go to the stock market they say I want to I want to buy the most expensive thing ever you know W Street but then they Panic the minute the minute right they Panic right away I always say Wall Street is the only Market the only store in the world when they throw a clearance sale everyone runs out of the store and it&#39;s so funny because I always use like the bloomies analogy right when bloomies puts dresses on sale for 30% women run in there they got to buy three of them because how can you leave it on the Shelf but yet you get a name like apple or Amazon they sell off 15 or 18 or 20% and people are panicked oh my God I&#39;m going to lose all my money like are you nuts yeah I mean you&#39;re not talking about some Nano cap or or microcap you&#39;re talking about a mega cap stock corre Apple makes $124 billion every three months yeah am I missing something here yeah yeah yeah exactly but anyway so I think let because then I want to go on talk more about um uh your broader kind of view of the bond market all that stuff but let&#39;s just talk about this so when you talk about you know looking looking in other places like the last will be first I have say I have that same kind of view so tell the audience what you mean by that yeah so I think if you look at last year you look at two of the worst performing sectors uh you had Healthcare and you had materials lowest earnings growth lowest performance shocking right well this year they&#39;re going to be in the top four sectors the second and the fourth Healthcare and materials in terms of earnings growth 19% earnings growth and 17% earnings growth relative to the SNP overall 14% earnings growth in that neighborhood uh so I think we&#39;re going to see a lot of catch up from the these type of sectors that have high earnings growth low multiples and that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to see some outperformance right and these let&#39;s let&#39;s be honest though there&#39;s there&#39;s there are no names in either one of those sectors that&#39;s really sexy like you know Tech think about invid that right there&#39;s nothing in there that that screams you know I got to have you but when you think about where it&#39;s been last year with the end perform versus where it can be this year in terms of consensus estimates all this stuff there are some great opportunities in those sectors no question about it I mean one thing that one material stock and you got to look at boring ones Alba Maro okay the lithium top lithium producer lithium prices are cyclical okay Alba Maro always comes through they&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity they&#39;re taking tons of costs out of the business all of them are lowering their production and by the way we all all think of EVs and we say oh no one wants EVS anymore in the US well the global stock is going to go it&#39;s it&#39;s 100% China story because it&#39;s government subsidized

Maro okay the lithium top lithium producer lithium prices are cyclical okay Alba Maro always comes through they&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity they&#39;re taking tons of costs out of the

all you want you&#39;re want chaos and you want all that stuff but if you&#39;re a long-term investor you really want to start to think long term and you want to think about opportunities and names that it might be boring yes but sometimes big and boring can be beautiful yes I&#39;m the captain of boring baby hold on one second let&#39;s just take a quick break and I&#39;m going to come back all right [Music] good okay so here we are we&#39;re back and I&#39;m here with Tom Hayes my good friend we&#39;ve had a very interesting conversation about the market but let&#39;s wrap it up with three essential Market tips just to keep in mind no matter which way the wind is blowing so number one you want to stay updated on policy and political developments right this week is going to make it a habit to keep a close eye on any of the policy updates or political events that could influence the market whether it&#39;s a new legislative proposal a congressional hearing or changes in regulatory stances these developments often send ripples through various sectors of the market I like to set aside sometime each morning to check the trusted new sources and government releases doing so not only helps you anticipate potential Market moves but also gives you the chance to adjust your positions if you need to and this week we&#39;re going to get you know uh uh JJ Powell is going to speak in front of Congress for the semiannual Humphrey Hawkins testimony which what may not be a market mover but there&#39;ll be lots of conversation around it number two be ready for sector rotation markets are Dynamic with money shifting from one sector to another as Tom and I discussed right um this week was a perfect example and when this happens use it to review sector performance and watch for signs that asset managers and investors rotating out of one sector while reallocating it to another now what I do when I sense that&#39;s happening is just allocate new Monies to those new sectors right I may trim it a little bit but I&#39;d rather keep the position I have built as long as the thesis remains intact for instance if economic data or political developments are favoring defensive sectors over growth oriented ones that&#39;s the cue for me to allocate new money to those sectors that will automatically rearrange the risk that I have in the portfolio uh without without me selling names that I really don&#39;t want to sell right leverage technical trigger point for timely action\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nk Advanced Auto Parts not even off the mat and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s a 30% move it&#39;s not even started Al marrow give me a break we&#39;re not even in the first inning okay these cyclical things I cannot believe all the opportunities that Co created this is a once in a 100e environment for people like me to make people like you look at Boeing okay so what it&#39;s had this huge run that we&#39;ve benefited from from 138 to 180 it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s not even getting started we&#39;ve talked about the the backlog of a half a trillion dollars we&#39;ve talked about the new C CEO Kelly ortberg and for those of you guys that down on Boeing it&#39;s very simple Southwest goes to Boeing and they say you guys have been terrible you have no quality control I cannot believe it and Boeing says I&#39;m sorry Mr Southwest we feel really bad why don&#39;t you go wait online at Airbus and you can get your next plane in 25 years I mean talk about the most beautiful business ever and they&#39;re going to fix all that stuff that&#39;s been you know it is very serious but Kelly knows how to fix it and that&#39;s why he&#39;s there he&#39;s actually an engineer versus a Salesman they finally  got the message Alibaba okay you guys are so unbelie like the excitement people texting me are you a soothsayer no I&#39;m not a soothsayer I read the financials and I&#39;m patient as hell and we use low leverage so that we can wait through and play the time Arbitrage game which is our huge Advantage so for those of you who think this is a big move we have not even begun next Baxter reported great earnings today why because they did what we actually said that they were going to do it took them a few months longer but they got rid of the kidney business and now they have money and now they&#39;re get their multiple is getting R-rated why because their slowest growing business is no longer part of the business and they have money to delever and all the things that we said were going to happen are starting to happen so for those of you who think wow we made so much money should we take profits these have not begun ladies and gentlemen so uh crown castle okay what&#39;s going to happen next they&#39;re going to sell the fiber business to Z for more than 8 billion they&#39;re going to buy in shares they&#39;re going to pay B down debt and those 40,000 towers are going to Mint money with zero maintenance zero capex just spitting out cash to the owners you&#39;re going to collect your 7% dividend yield while you wait oh and by the way you&#39;re probably going to get 50 to 100% capital appreciation over the next few years on top of it next Cooper standard we&#39;re going to talk about this I couldn&#39;t be more excited about this gxo we talked about last week you guys probably picked up some shares in the hole at better prices than we did I love it we did pick up a few more shares even though we backed up the truck at 42 some couple of whatever it was weeks ago we didn&#39;t get a ton at 36 cuz we had to do our work we got a few at 3839 whoop-de-do uh but we did get for all the new people that had room we got Cooper standard in the hole that&#39;s for sure and this is a b this is a business I&#39;d put tons and tons and tons of new money in without even blinking an eye comto yeah we have had you know a triple in a short period of time is a big move this one hasn&#39;t even begun okay so yeah we&#39;ll pull back maybe to 15 and this and that but look Take the Long View ladies and gentlemen and you know you tell me okay we we&#39;re partners with Jerry Jones at an equal basis to Jerry Jones because we bought in the hole he&#39;s got 67% of the company at $7 and change we&#39;re at $8 and change across the board and this game is just beginning just again 2002 to 2007 we&#39;ve talked about that a million times for those of you are new you&#39;re not going to get every single reference as long as you get the concepts you are going to be well ahead of the pack diio look Buffett just bought constellation Brands he gets it people have been drinking alcohol for 5,000 years are they drinking yes less yes is diio adapting by uh having 56% growth in the non-alcoholic cocktail business you bet are they going to recover here no question about it Disney okay everyone&#39;s like wow Disney was so great okay my friend on TV said Tom Hayes had this one in the 80s yes thank you I&#39;m very grateful we didn&#39;t get in for a move from 80 to 100 uh 10 whatever the hell it&#39;s trading at 110 this thing is going back up it&#39;s going to take a few years it&#39;ll be back over 200 bucks this is the same exact story as when the bass family bought a third of the company in 1984 because uh they were losing money because the transition to VHS tapes to monetize the Legacy IP the the cruise businesses are throwing off so much cash it&#39;s insane that you think the treasury prints money every time Disney puts up these new cruise ships the return on invested capital is insane it just prints money out to shareholders all day long and they are investing massively in that business this one&#39;s a winner for a long time and this wasn&#39;t hard to do while everyone was complaining about woke is broke okay we were buying one of the greatest businesses in the world down 60% and you could couldn&#39;t give it away so that&#39;s what we do here Estee louder new director we&#39;re going to talk about bought a ton in the hole that&#39;s what we like louder family 38% of the stock everyone says it&#39;s old women they&#39;re dying off go look at the brands actually do the work go talk to your 10 year-olds and 15y olds and ask them about the 12 Brands and tell me which ones are hot and they&#39;re going to show you the four that are flying off the shelves Etsy and by the way this is no different than VF Corp these these guys have been trading out in and out of brands for hundred you know some odd years family business just the same way that VF Corp has been doing the exact same thing and people couldn&#39;t see the forest for the trees and there you know price is down so they throw up everything in the hole and they miss the opportunities of a lifetime but again the point is these are getting started Etsy okay everyone&#39;s worried they just had record sales ever this quarter and and people are panicking in the streets while they&#39;re buying back stock generating free cash flow yeah you know yes their primary business little bit weaker than expected their new business is again buying more platforms are growing like a weed next gener okay so this was another one you couldn&#39;t give away up under 100 we&#39;re pounding the table on it it doubled to 195 okay we didn&#39;t get into it for a double this thing has 75% of the home standby generator standby generator mark Market in the US the penetration is at a level that is just getting started do you think we&#39;re going to have more weather events or less weather events um do you think the grid is going to be more stable or less stable you know the aners to both of those",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nrce giant Alibaba CEO Jack ma who was at the center of the Chinese government Crackdown on the tech industry in recent years my countdown closer like Alibaba stock despite the company&#39;s past regulatory boo boos and it is great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes who I&#39;m pleased to say joins me now all right make your case for Alibaba well thank you Taylor great to be with you look this wasn&#39;t the perfect pick for us we&#39;ve been buying every single dip for the last two years we bought in the hundreds we backed up the truck in the 60s so across all accounts we at about $83 so it&#39;s had a huge run in the the last 5 weeks uh up about 50% let it rest a little bit they&#39;re going to report earnings on the 20th maybe if you get a pullback after earnings you get a chance to to get in but this is a very special company in terms of valuation number one it&#39;s the number one cloud provider in China it&#39;s also the number one AI provider which we saw in recent weeks with apple linking up stop you there and ask you cuz I just spent two hours with Kevin o on my earlier show and he said this is in effect a game changer I&#39;m those are my words not his but the fact that you have an Apple device in China using Alibaba AI shows that there actually might be a partnership between the US and China is that better for apple or better for Alibaba I think it&#39;s better for both it&#39;s the best model they beat deep seek on many metrics they beat open AI on any many metrics and apple needs the government approval in China and the government is approving Alibaba then that&#39;s just the icing on the cake let&#39;s talk about the cake uh this is a huge play on the middle class recovery uh they were in lockdown for many many years tbell and t-ball it&#39;s like being a toll taker for the bridge every dollar that the middle and upper class are going to spend in this recovery is going to go through Alibaba quite a few of those dollars are going through Alibaba and then finally  we&#39;ve always said treat Alibaba as a China AI ETF it&#39;s not just the partnership with Apple they have Equity stakes in many of the AI startups in China because they give them cloud computing service is it in exchange for equity and a lot of people don&#39;t know that oh and by the way their international business e-commerce business is growing at 40% on top of it do you know Taylor you can buy this stock at 2014 prices the difference is revenue is up 10x per share cash flow is up 6X per share and earnings are up 6X per share so at a 12 times forward multiple if it if you just rate forget about growth which they&#39;re going to have if you just rate back to a normalized multiple 24 this thing some of the parts is worth well over $200 and it&#39;s probably going to take about two plus years to get that get there in our view okay so need a little bit of a longer timeline if you want to hold on to the stock so\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nbrought an out particularly with the US and and mag 7 you still bullish well you know when we came on with you the beginning of January and I love coming on with you Taylor we said that uh maybe lien up on the mag 7 the broadening is going to continue and what do we have year to date we have S&amp;P up 4% we have mag 7 Up only 2% so uh what what have we seen we saw the last Shelby first materials have outperformed up 6.8% no you couldn&#39;t give away materials the market was up 20 some odd perc last year materials were basically flat Healthcare is up 5.3% so we definitely have some picks in those areas you got to look a little more closely this year to get that out performance than just buying the indic seeson mag 7 the theme of the last few years has been the US versus the rest of the world do you expect that to continue or do you start to like Emerging Markets yeah that was a top of the Year theme as well I I was uh privileged to speak with you about that as well well look what&#39;s happened this year Emerging Markets is up 6.2% year to date uh European Kean equities you would never guess this at the beginning of the year Taylor up 10.6% relative to the S&amp;P 500 up 4% this is a theme that is a regular theme but we&#39;re all stuck in recency bias we think US stocks are going to outperform Forever every 10 to 15 years you get huge periods of five 10 years of outperformance of international stocks you had it in the Reagan Administration I think you&#39;re going to see it in the Trump Administration as well as the dollar weakens and yields come under control so uh we love that and Alibaba is one way we&#39;re doing it just quickly here to end can the S&amp;P or Equity markets continue to Rally if we&#39;re looking at a four and a half maybe 5% on the 10e yeah I think uh bonds are the second most crowded trade be behind the mag 7 I think we&#39;re going to see a 4% on the 10year before we see 5% I know that&#39;s unconventional but as you know by now I&#39;m pretty unconventional uh and that will enable us you know the market looks like it wants to breakout here but February tends to be a choppy period I think we will get to New Highs but I think the index returns for the year are going to be a bit subdued 8 to 12% and find your opportunities elsewhere in the broadening well Tom Hayes we always appreciate you coming on thank you thank you meanwhile and we&#39;re back and then I had the pleasure to talk to steu vanney thanks to Jack guys thanks to Christian dagger and Preston myel for having me on we&#39;re going to tune in here here want to get back to the markets yeah I&#39;ve got to tell you there&#39;s not that much price movement going on is it Dows off what 30 S&amp;P off six NASDAQ up four that&#39;s not much movement so let&#39;s bring in uh we&#39;ve got to with us this morning Thomas uh Tom Hayes sorry miss your name right Tom Hayes all right I&#39;m looking for some positives here I&#39;m trying to think that maybe what doge is doing with cutting government spending and getting into the fraud and waste and what they&#39;re doing in Saudi Arabia the US and Russia getting together for peace talks over Ukraine I&#39;m trying to think that that may be a positive for the market what say you there&#39;s no question about it Stu I think you hit the nail on the head with Doge uh this is underrated and I think the biggest surprise of this year is that the 10-year treasury yield is going to 4% before it goes to 5% and the reason being is because doge is going to continue to cut cut government spending there&#39;s going to be a lot of layoffs which is deflationary which may not be absorbed into the public sector as quickly as people think because the skills or lack thereof may not be transferable uh so as rates come down it&#39;s going to open up the opportunity for a lot of these underperforming sectors in the market the second thing that&#39;s been really positive to is earnings have blown out of the water 16.9% earnings growth compared to just 9% estimates uh for this quarter with 70 7% reported so a lot of good things happen why is the market a little bit uncertain because we&#39;re in sandbagger season which is when they take down guidance so that they can beat for the rest of the Year this is a normal seasonal occurrence we&#39;ve taken down guidance in the last few weeks the markets a little bit nervous we&#39;re in that kind of mid-February slump uh but it it feels like the market wants to break to new highs too very interesting the market wants to go up I love those words Tom Hayes thanks for joining us I&#39;m sorry so short it&#39;s a big news Tuesday we&#39;ll see you again soon Tom thanks so much and we&#39;re back I am trademarking the word sandbagger season which we just got through we&#39;re going to talk about some sandbagging later in this podcast and then\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nthere&#39;s no question about it

conversation about the market but let's wrap it up with three essential Market tips just to keep in mind no matter which way the wind is blowing so number one you want to stay updated on policy and political developments right this week is going to make it a habit to keep a close eye on any of the policy updates or political events that could influence the market whether it's a new legislative proposal a congressional hearing or changes in regulatory stances these developments often send ripples through various sectors of the market I like to set aside sometime each morning to check the trusted new sources and government releases doing so not only helps you anticipate potential Market moves but also gives you the chance to adjust your positions if you need to and this week we're going to get you know uh uh JJ Powell is going to speak in front of Congress for the semiannual Humphrey Hawkins testimony which what may not be a market mover but there'll be lots of conversation around it number two be ready for sector rotation markets are Dynamic with money shifting from one sector to another as Tom and I discussed right um this week was a perfect example and when this happens use it to review sector performance and watch for signs that asset managers and investors rotating out of one sector while reallocating it to another now what I do when I sense that's happening is just allocate new Monies to those new sectors right I may trim it a little bit but I'd rather keep the position I have built as long as the thesis remains intact for instance if economic data or political developments are favoring defensive sectors over growth oriented ones that's the cue for me to allocate new money to those sectors that will automatically rearrange the risk that I have in the portfolio uh without without me selling names that I really don't want to sell right leverage technical trigger point for timely action\nfinally\n\nChase headlines  Chase noise Chase Momo people but actually do the work and invest in a stock the way that you would underr investing in the whole business with 100% of your net worth and you take it that seriously great things happen when you buy high quality assets when they are temporarily marked down ladies and gentlemen and then you add the patience factor and that&#39;s what puts you ahead of the pack Peter Lynch investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards and I&#39;m not talking about research like the the nonsense bs1 liners that you hear from a lot of commentators that think they&#39;ve done work on the stock but they&#39;re just ch chasing a price chart I&#39;m talking about really understanding the business doing the public filings doing the earnings calls Channel checks competition knowing what you own as if you own the whole company with 100% of your net worth moving on this is very important from Bruce ker through bitter experience I have learned that a mistake in position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading also in investing by the way if you have eight highly correlated positions then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large and so many people do this that are over their skis in Tech and mag 7 and are feeling that pain recently uh of underperformance that we&#39;re going to talk a lot about today and uh and in maybe some new ways that we haven&#39;t talked about before that set you up to avoid what&#39;s been taking place Warren Buffett I&#39;ll tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy that doesn&#39;t just mean the General market that means specific companies that make zero sense on a valuation basis that people are chasing like lemons and getting getting ready to get their heads chopped off like chickens uh be greedy when others are fear fearful like all of you who&#39;ve been sending me all these incredible notes this week and I&#39;m very grateful for that&#39;s stuck with their Baba and now you&#39;re making bank let me tell you guys do not get sucked in the Trap of because you made a little money now you want to lock in your profit that is cognitive bias it&#39;s time to get paid where did you underwrite the sum of the parts and the value of the business okay that is fair value okay if you want to take off that some value there you can do that but I&#39;m telling you right now number one we&#39;re nowhere near intrinsic value number two the price and the excitement is going to dramatically overshoot the intrinsic value the same way that it undershot the intrinsic value on the downside all these negative analysts are now flipping positive and they&#39;re going to chase it the entire way up why because a opinion follows trend is the name of the game and as my great friend Damien would say burden yourself with the facts baby so moving right along uh let&#39;s just take a look cuz I got people calling me I can&#39;t believe how much money this you know look I told you guys I was very serious about what we talked about at the turn of the year and a lot of you took me up on it and kudos to you and now everyone&#39;s all say wow we&#39;re do everything&#39;s so great blah blah blah let me tell you ladies and gentlemen we are just getting started like we haven&#39;t even begun what&#39;s going to what&#39;s going to take place in the next 12 months for people who are investors and uh you can just look at some of the names here that we&#39;ve talked about and discussed and we own in different sizes and weightings and different Expressions Etc but I just want you to get the themes down these things haven&#39;t even begun okay Advanced Auto Parts not even off the mat and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s a 30% move it&#39;s not even started Al marrow give me a break we&#39;re not even in the first inning okay these cyclical things I cannot believe all the opportunities that Co created this is a once in a 100e environment for people like me to make people like you I&#39;m now talking to my existing clients as much as we can humanly possibly make together look at Boeing okay so what it&#39;s had this huge run that we&#39;ve benefited from from 138 to 180 it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s not even getting started we&#39;ve talked about the the backlog of a half a trillion dollars we&#39;ve

been terrible you have no quality control I cannot believe it and Boeing says I&#39;m sorry Mr Southwest we feel really bad why don&#39;t you go wait online at Airbus and you can get your next plane in 25 years I mean talk about the most beautiful business ever and they&#39;re going to fix all that stuff that&#39;s been you know it is very serious but Kelly knows how to fix it and that&#39;s why he&#39;s there he&#39;s actually an engineer versus a Salesman they\n\nmassively in that business this one&#39;s a winner for a long time and this wasn&#39;t hard to do while everyone was complaining

said we just bought too much at 42 uh after that deal Unwound we love this they&#39;ll announc the new CEO the CMA was positive uh we put that out in the article this week we&#39;ll cover some of that as well here&#39;s a staple just getting started mismanaged what we got a catalyst for turnaround turnaround Tom&#39;s formula guy&#39;s been Mis mismanaging the business since 2016 he\n\nChinese stocks on track to beat Indian peers for the third month what did we say all last year Japanese and Indian was Asian hot money that needed somewhere to hide once the China game turns on it&#39;s all flooding back to China and they&#39;re going to be left for dead at uh 12 month lows in uh India uh here we go uh highest since 2022 we&#39;ve now blown through that in terms of Chinese stocks Bank of Japan set to offload all stocks bought during during the financial crisis losing momentum company guidance Trails analyst estimates by the most in the this is the I mean can&#39;t they read their own chart q1 every single year they take down guidance why the secret to happiness is low expectations both in life and in the stock market and all these sandbagger and Chiefs that get paid for beating earnings take their guidance down and then they beat the next four quarters and they look like Geniuses and that&#39;s exactly what is happening right now as I said to sue it is sandbagger season here we go and annual S&amp;P 500 profit Outlook hasn&#39;t budged for 2026 uh uh so while estimates have come down for 2025 2026 is going up uh investors hit pause on the Trump trade while Chinese stocks race ahead you can see the dramatic outperformance over the S&amp;P over Bitcoin over the dollar is now turning negative as we anticipated election dollar yields go up in inauguration dollar starts to roll over yields start to roll over according to Playbook asset manager most bullish on Yen since March of 2021 this is just beginning ladies and gentlemen Yen up carry trade on wine mag 7 suffer incentives the number one leading indicator of Auto volumes have been going straight up since July 2022 car prices have stopped going up this is the formula for Camelot when it comes to being an auto part supplier Cooper standard incentives up volumes up Cooper standard get paid by the car not by uh the oem&#39;s margin they will be erased to the bottom in margins why because they are healthc care and annuity companies masquerading as car producers Hong Kong outperforms the NASDAQ by a wide margin back from the dead Chinese stocks are still cheap compared to their past still trading at 12 times earnings normalized Peak cycle 20 times greatest companies 25 30 times we&#39;re just beginning auto loan repayments as a share of after tax wages and salaries are at or below 2019 levels for Millennials and gen Z all of the th all of the chips are falling into place government spending back above 7 trillion that&#39;s going to change very quickly with douge us debt is poised to exceed post World War II era Peak this is sell the rumor by the news ladies and gentlemen this is uh people always extrapolate these extremes this is a peak just like we saw post World War II they&#39;ll run inflation hot they&#39;ll take spending down uh run growth hot and um we&#39;re going to have huge nominal growth in the next four years let let me just tell you that hang on to your hats labor force participation rate tends to diverge this is really interesting we&#39;ve been worried about the labor force participation work but it&#39;s largely skewed to the 55 and overs that never re-entered the the 25 to 54 are doing what they need to do 84% labor force participation rate so that&#39;s very promising to see uh what are we looking at here Japanese 10-year government bond yield every single week this goes up what does that mean every single week the carry trade gets pressured and money pulls out of the mag 7 free money is no longer free ladies and gentlemen um got that oh this is just showing H H sang is now outperforming the local uh csi300 in China some of that has to do with the stock connect as we anticipated with Baba we&#39;ve had 20 billion dollars of flows into Baba from Mainland we you guys knew tomorrow&#39;s newspaper today we were covering that over the summer uh nifty 50 here&#39;s India okay all that hot money is coming out going back to China ladies and gentlemen just the be early days more L cargos are arriving at Europe Shores so that&#39;s going to help C stock resources okay this is interesting everyone used this chart this week to say that we&#39;re at a top maybe we are maybe we&#39;re not I don&#39;t know the market was down a lot we we had a great day um but what they failed to realize is this was the exact same cash level actually the last two times you had cash levels this low were super duper bullish uh that was 2004 uh and 2011 okay now did you have it in 2007 yeah so people it&#39;s mindboggling they look at most of these instances 2011 2013 203 were very very very bullish for a very long time and all they do is look at the one instance where it didn&#39;t work and say cash levels are low we&#39;re going to crash okay sell everything to me in the whole thank you very much uh most bullish developments in 2025 China growth picks up people are now looking at what happens to the global economy if China growth accelerates and by the way news flash it is here&#39;s uh Tesla is Automotive Revenue by year so look you can see it here it is rolling over uh this is not good at all unless you believe in robots and if you believe in robots and you believe in autonomous then you take a flyer on this guy we&#39;ve never been long it we&#39;ve never been short it it&#39;s not what we do we stay in our lane we do turnaround times doubles and triples off the lows two three years rinse and repeat compound money and don&#39;t worry about predicting the future cast Freight index is a little bit low keeping an eye on that GDP estimates came down to the mid 223s a lot of this is probably predicated on tariff fears which people can&#39;t actually model until you know what exactly is happening Euro Zone economy fair to touch better than first estimated in Q4 data shows China January Bank lending hits record high on policy stimulus X and Jack ma chat seen as next Catalyst for blistering rally not only did they invite Jack ma to speak at the G conference it&#39;s my understanding they give Jack ma an award big change topof the market in 2021 uh when Alibaba was 320 the Chinese government wanted to take uh Jack ma behind the shed and shoot him now they&#39;re giving him Awards the game is back on why they need him you can&#39;t have 20% of your 25-year-old educated students unemployed and rioting in the streets the number one job of a position of a politician is to stay in power and they fig figure that out and We&#39;re Off to the Races so uh we they just they just took more pain for a longer period of time than we thought that they would but sooner or later survival kicks in and boom we&#39;re off and when it comes it comes all at once as we always like to say equal weight versus aggregate S&amp;P annualized 10year returns we see this inflection point just like we saw in when what have you been covering 2001 which was the greatest period to do what go against the grain while everyone was crammed in to uh the tech thing chasing Enron chasing Tao chasing Worldcom chasing Cisco chasing Amazon which by the way did everything that they promised they were going to do the problem was you were paying for what they said they were going to do 15 years later in 2000 therefore the stock had to correct and rate 90% over the next two years even though it was a great company and the underlying fundamentals were improving you just paid too much okay good things happen when you buy high quality assets at good prices not the highest price ever offered in public markets history like some of the stocks that we see today okay a substantial Divergence between home builders and the broad Market this will reconverge Stanley and J will be the bigger beneficiaries than the home builders themselves because the home builders themselves are going to get a little bit uh hit on margins this is nothing related to the market but I am so grateful that I found golf while I found it late in life and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh fits and starts and had my best round ever two weeks ago and then couple good rounds after bad round today hopefully I&#39;ll have a good round uh in the next couple of days but anyway the point is this if you look here uh this is the daily average time with Friends by age and you can see it&#39;s like completely collapsed since 2012 they&#39;re attributing it to devices Etc and golf is just one of those special things where adults that don&#39;t have time to hang around with friends can spend four hours doing something that they love get great uh exercise build relationships learn from great people um and uh go against this trend it&#39;s a contrarian investment in your happiness learned how to play golf and enjoy um here&#39;s another cast inferred Freight rates show them turning off in coming months so\n\nstock market and sentiment results  uh we went into extensive detail on gxo Logistics uh which we think is going to be a home run and we covered the positive outcome on CMA Jeff did a great job with that um that decision was reached and it basically quantifies the risk to 10% of the business that they just bought which is uh the grocery part of the business and they will just cut a deal on that and then we will be Off to the Races locking in those synergies on winon and moving to the next level with a new amazing CEO that Brad Jacobs will undoubtedly recruit to run one of the greatest duopolistic businesses and recovery on the Europe play ever in existence so we&#39;re excited about that go through this tremendous amount of work went into that great job you can see here we bought Cooper standard when it was in trouble in 2022 added all along the way uh and now turning cash flow positive the game is just beginning the SAR is going to be incredible the amount of money they earn off just modest increases in USR now is off the chart so go through this great work took a lot of time to put together there and you can see some of the key takeaways as well incentives all the things that we&#39;ve talked about in this podcast and we do our work you can see all the earnings called transcripts and the important things to understand about the future next Russell 2000 top weights earnings estimates uh have gone up top 30 weights in the last 60 days small caps earnings estimates have gone up 3.41% for this year 5.4% for next year S&P have actually started to go up 19 basis points and 57 after coming down material during sandbagger season where they dropped from 275 to 271 while at the same time 2026 went from 2 39 to 241 so next year&#39;s estimates went up this year&#39;s estimates went down sandbagger City okay uh let&#39;s get down to the",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\ncombine your fundamental insights with technical analysis as you monitor policy changes and sector shifts pay attention to the key technical trigger points like support and desist resistance trend lines moving averages crossovers relative strength readings that can signal a good moment to enter or exit a position especially if you&#39;re a shorter term investor and Trader even if you&#39;re a seasoned investor these technical cues are incredibly useful for timing your trades and more precisely uh for helping you manage right they act as your internal check ensuring that your decisions are based on both the broader economic picture as well as current price action so Tom talk just a little bit about for instance those technical indicators relative strength and all that stuff yeah look we we tend to be fundamentally uh focused however we do look at some of the extremes so just as we look at extreme in price relative to the underlying fals we look at extremes from some of the indicators you discussed moving average converges slow stastics uh relative strength all the standards is it at an extreme level where you tend to see some price recoveries and then do the fundamentals based on our view of fundamental analysis support that exactly right and I think and I think as a long-term investor you kind of have to play both those sides you have to have a fundamental view you got to do your homework and have a thesis on why you&#39;re buying it but then you should also that because that&#39;s how I do it right you kind of look at the charts and see if is it overbought maybe I&#39;m going to be a little more patient if I sense it&#39;s overbought the relative strength tells me you know it&#39;s overbought it&#39;s going to come back in so I&#39;ll be a little bit more patient it helps identify extremes and for a guy named turnaround Tom that&#39;s very very important\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nWarren Buffett the stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient that&#39;s what we do all day long here ladies and gentlemen go back and look at the previous tapes we&#39;ve got now five years of tapes pick a date listen in what were we talking about it plays out some of them played out immediately some of them took a few years but when your framework is correct and you do the work not just chase price Chase\n\nChase headlines  Chase noise Chase Momo people but actually do the work and invest in a stock the way that you would underr investing in the whole business with 100% of your net worth and you take it that seriously great things happen when you buy high quality assets when they are temporarily marked down ladies and gentlemen and then you add the patience factor and that&#39;s what puts you ahead of the pack Peter Lynch investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards and I&#39;m not talking about research like the the nonsense bs1 liners that you hear from a lot of commentators that think they&#39;ve done work on the stock but they&#39;re just ch chasing a price chart I&#39;m talking about really understanding the business doing the public filings doing the earnings calls Channel checks competition knowing what you own as if you own the whole company with 100% of your net worth moving on this is very important from Bruce ker through bitter experience I have learned that a mistake in position correlation is the root of some of the most serious problems in trading also in investing by the way if you have eight highly correlated positions then you are really trading one position that is eight times as large and so many people do this that are over their skis in Tech and mag 7 and are feeling that pain recently uh of underperformance that we&#39;re going to talk a lot about today and uh and in maybe some new ways that we haven&#39;t talked about before that set you up to avoid what&#39;s been taking place Warren Buffett I&#39;ll tell you how to become rich close the doors be fearful when others are greedy that doesn&#39;t just mean the General market that means specific companies that make zero sense on a valuation basis that people are chasing like lemons and getting getting ready to get their heads chopped off like chickens uh be greedy when others are fear fearful like all of you who&#39;ve been sending me all these incredible notes this week and I&#39;m very grateful for that&#39;s stuck with their Baba and now you&#39;re making bank let me tell you guys do not get sucked in the Trap of because you made a little money now you want to lock in your profit that is cognitive bias it&#39;s time to get paid where did you underwrite the sum of the parts and the value of the business okay that is fair value okay if you want to take off that some value there you can do that but I&#39;m telling you right now number one we&#39;re nowhere near intrinsic value number two the price and the excitement is going to dramatically overshoot the intrinsic value the same way that it undershot the intrinsic value on the downside all these negative analysts are now flipping positive and they&#39;re going to chase it the entire way up why because a opinion follows trend is the name of the game and as my great friend Damien would say burden yourself with the facts baby so moving right along uh let&#39;s just take a look cuz I got people calling me I can&#39;t believe how much money this you know look I told you guys I was very serious about what we talked about at the turn of the year and a lot of you took me up on it and kudos to you and now everyone&#39;s all say wow we&#39;re do everything&#39;s so great blah blah blah let me tell you ladies and gentlemen we are just getting started like we haven&#39;t even begun what&#39;s going to what&#39;s going to take place in the next 12 months for people who are investors and uh you can just look at some of the names here that we&#39;ve talked about and discussed and we own in different sizes and weightings and different Expressions Etc but I just want you to get the themes down these things haven&#39;t even begun okay Advanced Auto Parts not even off the mat and it&#39;s like oh it&#39;s a 30% move it&#39;s not even started Al marrow give me a break we&#39;re not even in the first inning okay these cyclical things I cannot believe all the opportunities that Co created this is a once in a 100e environment for people like me to make people like you I&#39;m now talking to my existing clients as much as we can humanly possibly make together look at Boeing okay so what it&#39;s had this huge run that we&#39;ve benefited from from 138 to 180 it&#39;s a duopoly it&#39;s not even getting started we&#39;ve talked about the the backlog of a half a trillion dollars we&#39;ve talked about the new C CEO Kelly ortberg we talked about all the other things and for those of you guys that down on Boeing it&#39;s very simple Southwest goes to Boeing and they say you guys have been terrible you have no quality control I cannot believe it and Boeing says I&#39;m sorry Mr Southwest we feel really bad why don&#39;t you go wait online at Airbus and you can get your next plane in 25 years I mean talk about the most beautiful business ever and they&#39;re going to fix all that stuff that&#39;s been you know it is very serious but Kelly knows how to fix it and that&#39;s why he&#39;s there he&#39;s actually an engineer versus a Salesman they\n\nalib Baba we&#39;re going to do in dramatic detail next week but uh we can cover a few key things the name of the game is their AI business is growing everything&#39;s growing quote this quarter&#39;s results demonstrated substantial progress in our user first AI driven strategies and the re acceleration growth of our core businesses during this quarter customer management Revenue at tbal and t-all grew 9% as a result of initiatives to enhance user experience and effective monetization our Cloud Revenue growth reignited to double digits at 133% with AI related product Revenue achieving triple digit growth for the sixth consecutive quarter Numero Uno in AI in China and soon to be more than China at the rate that they&#39;re going with their partnership with apple they&#39;re going to do all the AI for Apple AI Intelligence on the Apple phones quen 2.5 knocking the cover off the ball relative to deep seek and relative to open AI on most metrics looking ahead Revenue growth at Cloud intelligence group driven by AI will continue to accelerate we will continue to execute against our strategic priorities in e-commerce cloud computing including further investment to drive long-term growth so they generated $5 billion of free cash flow despite all of the investment they&#39;ve been buying they bought in 9% of the stock last year uh they&#39;re growing the business again this has turned from a deep value company back into a growth company and an innovation company their International grew 32% tound t-all their mature businesses grew 9% Cloud intelligence 133% and then these little tiny businesses even had growth local Services up 12% digital media up 8% I mean these are rounding errors but it just shows a across the board everything is moving in the right direction earnings you know cash flow revenues is the name of the game and good things so we&#39;ll cover that in some more detail next week um\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmoving along  here gotta get this thing moved over there we go here&#39;s Joe Sai spoke at look at the alibaba&#39;s AI leadership conference I look I I think in fact I actually use the gro uh because I&#39;m I&#39;m on X his Twitter app and uh they provide an inter interface to grock which I use very often I&#39;m very impressed by uh the results um I also use a number of other apps uh a AI apps including our own uh the answer to your question you know this AI race who&#39;s better who a a AI is better the answer yesterday is going to be different from the answer tomorrow right now everybody is in a fairly tight race uh the next model that&#39;s going to be launched is going to be better than some but not others and then somebody else will launch something that&#39;s better than yours and we think we think that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen but what has H you mentioned deep seek and it it&#39;s quite significant uh and that&#39;s because they actually demonstrated that you can use some engineering Innovation to drastically lower the cost of training and inference of large language models uh and and up to this point people are massively investing into these Frontier models uh but here&#39;s the problem if you think about uh training of Frontier models as an Endeavor to educate your kids and you want to uh have the smartest kids uh have you know developed them so that they can uh acquire phds and not just one subject matter but 15 subject Matters from maths to physics to biology to psychology everything you want to have the smartest kids if that&#39;s the case take that into today&#39;s AI race there&#39;s maybe only five or six Rich parents that can afford to have the smartest kids um but is that something that we&#39;re really interested in it&#39;s probably not you have to start to ask yourself what is the purpose of what is the goal of develop veloping AI is this to have the smartest child so that they can win every single Nobel Prize or is it something different like there&#39;s a lot of problems in the world that need to be solved uh there&#39;s a lot of uh issues that we need to use AI to apply AI so that it can be useful and productive and make an economic impact uh so I think people are going to start when they look at the phenomenon of Deep see people are going to start shift away from all right let&#39;s stop putting in hundreds of billions of dollars into compute infrastructure so that we can train the smartest you know PhD and everything that can win the Nobel Prize let&#39;s find out what are the actual problems in the world uh and let&#39;s use AI to uh solve them so a lot of people are going to start putting resources into applications I think that&#39;s number one number two is deep SE has taught us the value of Open Source um uh you know if if today your only purpose in life is to develop a close Source uh AI system that is the smartest PhD student in everything the Nobel prize winning kid uh I personally think the value of that endeavor is approaching zero reference uh in looks like it was the world government Summit in Dubai on February 13th listen to what he had to say he&#39;s basically saying these people investing all this money without specific outcomes are probably not going to get the return on Capital read through the lines and here&#39;s what he said and we&#39;re back and now let&#39;s go through the data of the week okay some of my favorite charts right here ladies and gentlemen number one China&#39;s terrific 10 they now have a name for it Alibaba 10 cent mawan zi byd JD n b gie smic now is beating the Magnificent 7 if you look at the performance of the mag 7 between the China terrific 10 since December 2023 we are now beating the Magnificent 7 ladies and gentlemen up 85% versus the mag 7 Up 81% and at the same time what could be more beautiful than record short interest ready to get absolutely monkey hammered as we rip higher and as I said what did I say ladies and gentlemen they won&#39;t once it breaks through they won&#39;t let anyone in and that&#39;s exactly it&#39;s even surprised me how little they&#39;ve let people in as as enthusiastic as I&#39;ve been no different than go back and listen I was just as enthus if not more enthusiastic when it was at 60 than now when it&#39;s at 135 or 140 whatever it hit this morning um there you go gener",

um this is I&#39;ve talked about Nick he&#39;s been a longtime listener and multi-time caller he runs a great company called midday squares you can buy his incredible chocolates at middays squares.com or in Whole Foods and probably a million other places like Costco Etc uh and he says AMA question from longtime caller Nick Take a Bow Tom take a goddamn bow on Baba okay that is very kind to you Nick and uh I appreciate that we&#39;re not bowing anything because the game hasn&#39;t even started with Baba we&#39;ll talk about that above 200 but for now we just sit tight and we transfer money from the impatient to the patient and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re part of Baba train man you deserve it you&#39;ve been with us and uh kudos to you uh next question goes to uh Ang woo okay Ang is from Ireland I&#39;m kidding uh hey Tom I came across you through Alibaba stock and it&#39;s probably the best dividend Alibaba has ever given me since then I&#39;ve had 100% attendance and never miss your podcast I have a question from last week&#39;s episode where you mentioned that when marginal buyers in Orange County are gone uh which I was referring to the Chinese just like the Japanese dried up in the late &#39; 80s because the Japanese Market was booming and they all had fomo in Japan and money went back to Japan uh okay continuing it could create a significant air pocket wouldn&#39;t local buyers step in when that happens given that OC is such a desirable area they didn&#39;t step in in the early 90s so look real estate&#39;s not my game so like I&#39;m a real estate tourist but I can feel extremes and this is coming from a guy I&#39;ll be it I got a great deal because I worked some magic that I always find these weird deals and bought something at a discount to what they paid in 2019 which doesn&#39;t exist in OC because everything&#39;s tripled since 2019 but anyway [Music] um no you&#39;re taking out about 10% of the inventory when they step out the Chinese money has been about 10% of the inventory there&#39;s an article in the New York Times about La it&#39;s even more pronounced in OC and uh as the market goes up and opportunity comes back in China it&#39;s not that they&#39;re going to take all their money back from California it&#39;s so hard to get money out of China that what&#39;s\n\n caller Nick Take a Bow Tom take a goddamn bow on Baba okay that is very kind to you Nick and uh I appreciate that we&#39;re not bowing anything because the game hasn&#39;t even started with Baba we&#39;ll talk about that above 200 but for now we just sit tight and we transfer money from the impatient to the patient and I&#39;m glad you&#39;re part of Baba train man you deserve it you&#39;ve been with us and uh kudos to you uh next question goes to uh Ang woo okay Ang is from Ireland I&#39;m kidding uh hey Tom I came across you through Alibaba stock and it&#39;s probably the best dividend Alibaba has ever given me since then I&#39;ve had 100% attendance and never miss your podcast I have a question from last week&#39;s episode where you mentioned that when marginal buyers in Orange County are gone uh which I was referring to the Chinese just like the Japanese dried up in the late &#39; 80s because the Japanese Market was booming and they all had fomo in Japan and money went back to Japan uh okay continuing it could create a significant air pocket wouldn&#39;t local buyers step in when that happens given that OC is such a desirable area they didn&#39;t step in in the early 90s so look real estate&#39;s not my game so like I&#39;m a real estate tourist but I can feel extremes and this is coming from a guy I&#39;ll be it I got a great deal because I worked some magic that I always find these weird deals and bought something at a discount to what they paid in 2019 which doesn&#39;t exist in OC because everything&#39;s tripled since 2019 but anyway um no you&#39;re taking out about 10% of the inventory when they step out the Chinese money has been about 10% of the inventory there&#39;s an article in the New York Times about La it&#39;s even more pronounced in OC and uh as the market goes up and opportunity comes back in China it&#39;s not that they&#39;re going to take all their money back from California it&#39;s so hard to get money out of China that what&#39;s here is  staying here but that marginal buyer that keeps flooding in and parking money it&#39;s no longer going to do that because they&#39;re now seeing opportunity for the first time in China they can now buy Alibaba that doubles versus buying you know a house in Orange County where they have negative huge negative carry between taxes and maintenance fire risk or whatever else is going on um so uh so yeah I&#39;m not I&#39;m not sangin on Orange County real estate and I hope I&#39;m wrong because I own it so there you go uh I didn&#39;t make this as this was not a financial decision for me I&#39;m an East Coast guy I love it here I love swinging a golf club in January and February the People Are Awesome restaurants are awesome seeing the ocean from my home office is awesome walking to the beach is awesome but um uh I moved here for my kids and uh and they&#39;re super happy and you know and my wife is super happy happy wife happy life um okay that&#39;s an investor new investor inquiry uh new investor inquiry uh we only open so our minimum is $5 million anyone that&#39;s investing $5 million can come in any time that they want uh and can come in immediately so if you&#39;re planning on doing that great love to have the conversation see if there&#39;s a fit uh for those of you coming in at at the from time to time usually once a quarter we open up for small accounts of a million dollar or more uh and we are not open for million dollar accounts now doesn&#39;t mean we can&#39;t have a conversation and then you can fund if we open up again in April um but that is the distinction there so um Goran says I&#39;m curious to think what you think of Celsius and their acquisition of Ali new both as investor as a father of two young athletes I think it doesn&#39;t move the needle I think Celsius is interesting uh but we haven&#39;t done anything about it yet Mike lamb selones free Cas flow bases every single week m and welcome because you must be new because we cover seles every single week and every single week we say looks pretty good we&#39;re not doing anything with it but I like the idea uh Rasheed Alim thanks to the podcast could you take a look at selik toll taker in Dubai uh all right s a l i k yeah and it&#39;s priced like a toll taker I mean the thing is up by triple cash flows are flat not for me uh next thank you for the question though I don&#39;t want to be greedy and ask you a second question on the same day but what do you think of f fsugy well let&#39;s take a look Mr I don&#39;t want to be greedy FS uy foris me FS g y I mean the pric has declined along with cat no not for me uh no I&#39;d almost look at it as a short but I&#39;m not even going to go into that what do you think of Nova Nordisk no see this is all recency bias the Stock&#39;s up 10x and it pulls back you know 60 points and all of the sudden everyone&#39;s interested uh talk to me when it hits 50 and my guess is it won&#39;t hit 50 so therefore I&#39;ll never be involved Alex boam take a look at shift four okay we already have a payments business no not interested because it&#39;s no no cash flow is fine but it&#39;s not growing commenor to what&#39;s let me take a look here no not interested next Don L thoughts on Cooper standard Chinese GV just go listen to the call and listen to Jeff Edwards talk about their China business in the last two calls and you will be blown away Bert Bergstrom since Baba and vfc have B had big moves for you it seems like Nike could be a China play for Capital today since what do you think about deep in the money no uh either buy the stock or nothing um because you&#39;re going to have to wait this one&#39;s going to take a long time to turn around and you don&#39;t have Brack and Daryl so uh\n\nI think it&#39;s a durable enough business that uh it will recover I kind of like it here I liked it better in the low 70s uh if you get anything below 70 I think you can own it but you know these recoveries can take a long time it took six years in the late 90s when they screwed things up so I&#39;m not in a rush on that one but I think you got a good business uh and I think it&#39;s going to take a long time so uh and I&#39;ve got a great rockar with Brack and Daryl why would I want two sneaker companies go back to the quote at the beginning of the podcast about placing correlated bets and uncorrelated Bets it it would just be like doubling my VF Corp position which makes zero sense and VF Corp is a much better thing because Brack and Daryl took this company that made plastic commodity mouses and webcams and turned it into a 26 Baggers so if he can do that he can definitely take a worldclass brand like Vans that&#39;s been around since the 60s and every single Surfer every single cool person on the west coast wears and now he&#39;s going to he&#39;s destocked everything after he loaded everyone after everyone was loaded up during covid now he&#39;s launching new brands he&#39;s going to get the influencer machine going and this thing is going to rock and roll like no one&#39;s business um another client inquiry Brave Wilson what do you think about UFO and non-human intelligence as a potential investment Frontier have at it not for me I don&#39;t predict the future I buy durable businesses when they&#39;re temporarily impaired and get my doubles and triples in a few years rinse and repeat I&#39;ll leave the predicting of the future to other people uh if you like Deo you should love Sam I hate Sam I think truly and Sam Boston beer I think it&#39;s nonsense I think it was a controlled float runup not for me but thank you for that and yes it looks cheap and yes you probably get one more puff out of the cigar butt and yes that guy&#39;s smart and when he wants to finally get out for his last time he&#39;ll run this stock up but uh when&#39;s the last time you saw someone hanging out at a bar drinking at Sam Adams I mean give me a break on the on or truly for that matter everyone drinks white claw listen to the country songs you got to listen to country to know what&#39;s up all right uh the UFO boy re answered that River Rail selones every day yes we think it&#39;s okay no we&#39;re not going to own it uh Rogers telecommunication companies these are dogs I kind of like the breakup of Charter uh this one I&#39;ve looked at a million times done nothing ah this one&#39;s probably okay I I just don&#39;t like the space it&#39;s not a good business too Capital intensive too many risks uh revenues keep declining tell me when that&#39;s going to stop and turn around and I&#39;ll tell you when you should buy it but for now to pass Sufi uh oh I kind of thought something that might complement your backst position I don&#39;t complement things I don&#39;t trade correlated bets I&#39;ve got my position in healthcare and I&#39;m not going to get swayed looking at the next shiny object and getting fomo but her question is take a look at evolent Health evh thank you for the question by the way and thank you all for the question uh all right you got my attention Sufi let&#39;s take a look evh all right this thing&#39;s collapsing and now we got to figure out why because it&#39;s free cash flow positive cash flow is burn it turning over revenues are going up multiples are fine margins I can&#39;t tell but it looks like they&#39;re steady uh okay I must have done an acquisition here let&#39;s see what happened to the share count so I&#39;ve just about doubled the share count that&#39;s a red flag for me even if they use shares for the acquisition uh I don&#39;t like that I do not like that historically it&#39;s been a crap return on invested Capital business low quality business uh what&#39;s going on with free cash flow it&#39;s it&#39;s lumpy it&#39;s moving in the right direction um balance sheet 192 million of cash $600 million a day I I don&#39;t like the direction this is going so no pass it was it was interesting good try thank you for the question not for me uh many thanks for all your lessons and learnings that comes from Leo du jardan uh one with all right wondering how if you could elaborate a bit on your journey how to set up your own investment business uh okay royalty farmer I&#39;m not interested in and as far as that goes I never accepted I had no intention of starting an investment management business I was running my own money I&#39;d made enough money I was very happy just doing that uh and still is basically what I do I&#39;ve just allowed people to come alongside and benefit from my intellectual capital and um and it&#39;s just kind of grown into something way bigger than I could have imagined by accident and it continues to do so so now I&#39;m building a business and it&#39;s it&#39;s going great uh and I&#39;m very grateful for that um honestly I don&#39;t think you should take other people&#39;s money to manage until you don&#39;t need any Mage I mean candidly until you&#39;ve proven to yourself that you can compound Capital namely your own capital and you don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s capital in order to fund your living expenses because you&#39;ve already made enough money in the markets that&#39;s when you should consider investing other people&#39;s money when you&#39;ve already built your own money to a position that you don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s money and you&#39;ve proven that you know how to compound Capital um as far as starting a business from scratch to get other people&#39;s Capital to manage it so you can make money uh I mean maybe I&#39;m too rigid in my views on that I just don&#39;t think most people are qualified until they&#39;ve proven it for themselves so go work for a big firm learn your chops if you&#39;re good at it uh you&#39;ll rise up you&#39;ll make some money you&#39;ll have some Runway uh you&#39;ll have proven to yourself have confidence in your own abilities over the long term not just in a straightup market through Cycles uh and then once you&#39;ve done that and you&#39;ve got a couple gray hairs and you you got a decision on your mind do I retire or do I help other people and you you&#39;ll figure it out but uh that&#39;s the way that I would go about it so first you got to cut your teeth you got to pay your dues at least a decade working for other people and then from there um if you&#39;re good uh you&#39;ll find a way to do it so that would be my suggestion question for what are your thoughts on ssung Samsung um let&#39;s see how many Samsungs are there my gosh oh Samsung Electronics okay that makes sense looks like it&#39;s recovering

in alcohol which there has been cyclically for 5,000 years maybe this time&#39;s different with gp1s but I&#39;m willing to bet that it&#39;s not people like to escape I think diio is going to be the

the guy&#39;s not 20 you know I mean he&#39;s he&#39;s got to take some chips off the table I I don&#39;t really worry about that in in that case uh he&#39;s just an employee and that&#39;s how they

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nChina&#39;s terrific 10 they now have a name for it Alibaba 10 cent mawan zi byd JD n b gie smic now is beating the Magnificent 7 if you look at the performance of the mag 7 between the China terrific 10 since December 2023 we are now beating the Magnificent 7 ladies and gentlemen up 85% versus the mag 7 Up 81% and at the same time what could be more beautiful than record short interest ready to get absolutely monkey hammered as we rip higher and as I said what did I say ladies and gentlemen they won&#39;t once it breaks through they won&#39;t let anyone in and that&#39;s exactly it&#39;s even surprised me how little they&#39;ve let people in as as enthusiastic as I&#39;ve been no different than go back and listen I was just as enthus if not more enthusiastic when it was at 60 than now when it&#39;s at 135 or 140 whatever it hit this morning um there you go gener here is  from don&#39;t know but they put a 10 $210 price Target I think it&#39;s Steel on gener uh if I could avoid this is from Peter Lynch one up on Wall Street if I could avoid a single stock it would be the hottest stock in the hottest industry the one that gets the most favorable publicity the one that every investor hears about in the car poool or on the commuter train and succumbing to the social pressure often B I don&#39;t need to say more about those there&#39;s a handful of them you know what they are and there are couple outside the mag that um Good Luck uh Domestic Auto inventories I show this because you know Jeff Edwards over at Cooper standard love him met him many times uh sandbagger and chief okay this guy is trying to tell me not trying to tell me it&#39;s what they publicly released that um production volumes can lag behind SAR in a meaningful way number one that is false if you actually overlay the data back 20 years SAR and production volumes always converge and number two when you have record low domestic inventory Tories you can&#39;t give me the story that the the Divergence is it&#39;s not like the inventories are up here and uh you know they&#39;re selling but they stop producing because there&#39;s so many days of inventory we&#39;re at record low days of inventory ladies and gentlemen they may think they want lower inventories but once the game is on and the incentives race to the bottom and the oem&#39;s margins compressed uh they are going to be producing cars and the reason I&#39;m emphasizing this ladies and gentlemen is because the credible predictors of USR are at 16.2 million and 16.3 million cars for 2025 and Cooper standard thinks it&#39;s credible to publish a number of 15.1 million for you us production because SNP whatever said a month ago that that could be the production because we have so much inventory does this look like so much inventory to you this is sandbagger ISM at its finest and I understand why they&#39;re doing it because the oems are starting to get pressed on margins and they don&#39;t want to say come take our honey pot so I get it but I&#39;m telling you as massive shareholders ERS like I am okay I put my money where my mouth is I eat my own cooking I have a material material position alongside all of my clients and yes the the uh um initial base is 550 but I&#39;m telling you I would put money I would put new money to work till the cows come home at these levels because here&#39;s why in 2017 they had 17.1 million SAR not produ number excuse my language but like this was such a sandbagger ISM it was crazy town okay um every 300,000 cars now by the way they used to make my whole model was predicated on them making $150 a car now they&#39;re all hybrids and EVS they make more per car they&#39;re making $190 a car okay so and they&#39;ve cut $600 million of cost out of their business I mean it&#39;s insan you you could hear he was giddy at the end of the call but he&#39;s got to like keep it under wraps because you know it&#39;s it&#39;s not it&#39;s not a great business they will have two years where they make so much money it will be insane and then the oems will come to take that money back it happens every single cycle we will be out when they&#39;re making more money than God uh but in 2017 Cooper sander traded $146 on $719 of earnings on 17.1 million us SAR we&#39;re probably going to do 162 SAR this 151 production is complete and uh which probably means they&#39;ll do like 159 to 16 production even being conservative I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they did 162 uh and their Break Even is like 157 it&#39;s actually even lower now you can go through the call I mean he&#39;s like if volumes don&#39;t even grow we&#39;re going to get our EA to 270 million um so so on 162 if I&#39;m right I think they could earn $4 a share on that God forbid we get to 165 or back to 17 and and forget about earning 719 I think they&#39;ll earn 9 or 10 bucks so in 2017 at the cycle Peak on $7 they got a 20 times as multiple as $146 stock so let&#39;s say they do $9 and they get a trough multiple 10 times instead of 20 times if they get 20 times they trade at 180 bucks if they get 10 times they trade at 90 bucks if they get 15 times they trade in between there okay so 135 whatever 135 so the point is the stock is trading at $15 I don&#39;t need to say a whole lot more this was modeled after Charlie munger&#39;s Teno deal uh Teno was in the whole normal cyclical business he put in 10 million turned it into 80 gave the 80 to leel Loop put it in China stocks 80 million becomes 500 million we&#39;re

which was the greatest period to do what go against the grain while everyone was crammed in to uh the tech thing chasing Enron chasing Tao chasing Worldcom chasing Cisco chasing Amazon which by the way did everything that they promised they were going to do the problem was you were paying for what they said they were going to do 15 years later in 2000 therefore the stock had to correct and rate 90% over the next two years even though it was a great company and the underlying fundamentals were improving you just paid too much okay good things happen when you buy high quality assets at good prices not the highest price ever offered in public markets history like some of the stocks that we see today okay a substantial Divergence between home builders and the broad Market this will reconverge Stanley and J will be the bigger beneficiaries than the home builders themselves because the home builders themselves are going to get a little bit uh hit on margins this is nothing related to the market but I am so grateful that I found golf while I found it late in life and you know it&#39;s it&#39;s uh fits and starts and had my best round ever two weeks ago and then couple good rounds after bad round today hopefully I&#39;ll have a good round uh in the next couple of days but anyway the point is this if you look here uh this is the daily average time with Friends by age and you can see it&#39;s like completely collapsed since 2012 they&#39;re attributing it to devices Etc and golf is just one of those special things where adults that don&#39;t have time to hang around with friends can spend four hours doing something that they love get great uh exercise build relationships learn from great people um and uh go against this trend it&#39;s a contrarian investment in your happiness learned how to play golf and enjoy um here&#39;s another cast inferred Freight rates show them turning off in coming months so\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfinally  coming off the boil

destock restock destock restock another theme the last 24 months booming fun fact that just happened this is from uh Seth golden only five times in S&P history as S&P undercut December low and then gained 3% by Valentine&#39;s Day the rest of the year 198 up 16% 91 up 14% 966 9820 and 20201 okay that is a fun fact worth noting deep seek boosting Chinese stocks okay you can see and by the way it&#39;s not every Chinese stock it&#39;s picking the right one uh and Alibaba is leading the pack in the scheme of the you know magnificent 10 over there or whatever they&#39;re calling that tremendous 10 uh bull markets last longer than you think so our current bull market is 28 months old the average since 1949 this is from Ryan Dietrich is 67 months and the longest one which started in 87 is 148 months so this could be very early days and we are in that camp we&#39;ve covered the average amount of 20% Corrections is one every 4.1 years we had two in two years 2020 and 2022 so we basically pulled 8 years of that forward uh so we should have some some blue skies at least for another couple of years into the midterm uh this Market might be two but it is still young so we covered that uh again young bull market all this ah here we go this is uh Seth and he&#39;s a listener to this podcast as well dollar path during Trump 1.0 versus Trump 2.0 remains quite analogist an opportunity for the dollar rally remains in play near turn but longer term probabilities the dollar do not look favorable in the analog all this means is dollar is going down which we&#39;ve been telling you was going to happen yields are going to go down uh Emerging Markets are going to rip China&#39;s going to continue to rip rail traffic going up that&#39;s a very positive sign and then you just see again concentration going back to nifty50 Doc bubble artificial intelligence we&#39;re going to get great things from artificial intelligence the question is are you already paying for what&#39;s coming 10 years from now chart of the week us office net absorption is turning the corner we had that Vado trade quick double we got out um this is just beginning ladies and gentlemen those of you who took me up and bought some Office Buildings in the hole are probably smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways so that&#39;s good investors haven&#39;t been this pessimistic about stock since 2023 that&#39;s just one uh metric but uh worth noting you tend to not uh correct when people are skeptical so something to keep in the back of the Mind FNS manager survey sees us equities as the most undervalued since at least 2001 uh I would quantify that and say Parts small caps for sure emerging markets for sure value over growth for sure uh mag 7 not so sure uh you know some of these AI Darlings not so sure uh China new home prices us AI Darlings not so sure China new home prices barely fall in sign Market is stabilizing the problem is now the solution economic expectations for China are rising opinion follows Trend natural gas through the roof com stock back on the Move uh we&#39;ve got this winter freeze that&#39;s coming whatever the hell it&#39;s called and then uh here&#39;s the other thing yeah you got the concentration but you used to have the earnings to support it now you got the earnings lagging the weight in the S&P so the earnings weight they they produce 28% of the earnings but they&#39;re 38% of the weight that is unwinding as the mag money comes out and as overspend defensively on capex which they have yet to prove t\n\nbelieve X&#39;s Tech

MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nheadlines  from Baron saying alcohol is done uh Cox Automotive forecast okay so this is the data that we are using uh not the sand baggery that we saw 16.3 million Cox Automotive is

units in 2025 uh Global Mobility projects Us sales volume 3 16.2 so uh to say that they&#39;re going to produce 151 when they&#39;re going to sell 162 when inventories are at record lows is sandbagger and Chief and I&#39;m saying that in a good way because we got more shares Intel stock is climbing like it did back in the 80s here&#39;s what okay we covered that Jeff raises Targets on China tech stocks and AI growth opinion follows Trend fed officials weigh slowing are pausing Bond draw down last month that&#39;s interesting if they&#39;re going to stop quantitative tightening um which could help the long end of the curve so it sounds like maybe Powell and bessent are getting in getting along uh Japan&#39;s food inflation is becoming harder for boj to overlook which means they have to do what hike faster which means what Yen strengthens which means what carry trade on wines which means what mag s underperforms which means what money goes into the stocks that we&#39;re in which is why

Allan light vehicle retail sales in the US from 19 1976 to 2024 and you can see this is just a normal another cycle the population&#39;s growing a ton so the Peaks keep getting higher which actually implies that and I&#39;ve been very conservative I said we&#39;ll Peak at 17 maybe we Peak at 18 or 19 we got 13 average car on the road is 13 years I mean if they did like 18 my God oh my God two divide by six * 3 I mean the thing could earn 15 to 18 a share I mean now I&#39;m just being crazy town like let&#39;s just get to 78 or9 a share and see where we at how we&#39;re feeling at 100 but uh um it&#39;s unbelievable God bless the sandbaggers it gives us opportunities to buy incredible companies at cheap prices and then the thing goes and they don&#39;t let you in once it goes It goes ladies and gentlemen you&#39;re seeing it in real time in Baba you&#39;ve seen it in vernado you&#39;ve seen it in Wells Fargo during Co you saw it in Exxon during Co you saw it in um Rolls-Royce I mean anyway we&#39;re having fun gener what do we got here 210 buy that&#39;s from steel let&#39;s go through the sler charts here open link so look this is what I told Su this this feels like it wants to break out maybe they&#39;ll do one fake out before they take it up dollar rolling over 10year yields rolling over Staples getting bid which we talked about socks in a Range semiconductors Intel&#39;s moving like crazy uh slomer 2 where&#39;s that we&#39;ll find it this is very interesting this is from fun Strat Tom Le after each four-year time of a price consolidation phase small caps launched and rocketed higher relative valuations and earnings growth forecast lend positivity to this cycle repeating if not simply rhyming so looking back ladies and gentlemen what did we talk about you want it to be small caps here&#39;s what happened in the 2002 to 2006 period largest growth in the shortest amount of time breaks out it just goes straight up same thing in 200 the9 period straight up and now we&#39;ve just finished this consolidation we&#39;re going to break out and go straight up same thing in the uh 80s second term of Reagan same exact story straight up for many many years people think stall caps don&#39;t work cuz recency bias last four years consolidating they felt the same during this four years they felt the same during this four years and this four years and once they break out they go straight up so if you don&#39;t have small cap exposure this is your final warning ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to get double the earnings growth Plus for half the multiple and it&#39;s just getting started you want ground floor doesn&#39;t get any more ground floor than that how&#39;s that so Trend and cycle technical uh weekly chart book let&#39;s see here we covered that Breakout equal weight moving in the right direction uh a AI this is what people saying people are most bearish since uh whatever a year ago it&#39;s nonsense by the way only like 300 people take that survey so the people that put weight on that I&#39;m you know it&#39;s it&#39;s worth glancing at but it&#39;s not um here&#39;s your small caps once it&#39;s through here they will not let anyone in maybe they go up and then they retest but start your engines start your engines ladies and gentlemen okay uh Europe breaking out that wasn&#39;t on anyone&#39;s Bingo cards at the beginning of the year except for us who said International would start to outperform and when that starts it happens every 10 to 15 years it&#39;s going to last 10 to 15 years and people are going to say wow that was the opportunity of a lifetime and most people won&#39;t get it till eight years in and then we&#39;ll be selling our shares to them so you heard it here my all of this is opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms uh we don&#39;t know what you should do we work exclusively with family offices ultra high net worth accredited investors uh we all we&#39;re sharing is what we&#39;re doing not what you should do uh or anything of the like um okay what else we got here Tokyo week hasn&#39;t been able to get off the boil Hong Kong breaking out uh hangsang rocking and rolling 10e yield coming down coming down rolling over the Looney coming back like a phoenix From the Ashes wait till you get a new CEO in place when Wayne

that&#39;s a hard one there&#39;s going to be opportunity in servicers I just don&#39;t know when and I&#39;ll keep an eye on them uh gold have at it enjoy copper if I had to play gold or copper I&#39;d probably play copper that&#39;s to play on China but it&#39;s already moved uh wheat rolling over and I think that&#39;s pretty much okay so now he goes through a number of names PayPal looks like it&#39;s at resistance here on this whatever 50-day moving aage average I would put new money to work there even if it goes a little lower first um so funny that was this was the date June 20th when we put out the article the next pain trade you you literally people were just clamoring they were signing Jensen Wong was like a rockstar signing people&#39;s bras and I said this is the next pain trade it was literally on this tick and you can go back and look at it article was on June 20th and uh it immediately crashed and it has not yet retaken those highs going on you know 3 quarters of a year maybe maybe it does maybe it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not I&#39;m not paying that 50 time sales have had it um no no I&#39;m happy with Intel uh kweb my buddy Brendan ahar rock and roll great golfer can&#39;t by the way uh anyway got to got to call him and get get back out there when he&#39;s on the west coast uh K web is breaking out for those of you who want diversification Baba broke through this line I told you anyway very excited uh 10 cent Philip 66 it&#39;s good to look at these things let&#39;s see V all right nothing really super standout is here re well we got the crown castle all right good stuff there uh what else do we need to talk about here 10year yield going back over value to growth this game is just starting ladies and gentlemen start your engines values outperformed growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 what does that mean in English it means that if you had invested in value over growth since 1927 you put in a million dollars in each strategy you would have 68 more million dollars by investing in value so you&#39;d have ballparking now 100 to 120 uh if you invested in growth if you&#39;re lucky because you have bigger draw downs and you would have 170 with value so uh you&#39;re call because everyone is stuck in recency bias the last 15 years growth is outperformed value game has changed cap light you know uh capex light blah blah blah the game is always this way nifty50 decom it happens every single cycle just like International to domestic and sooner or later it normalizes and you revert to the mean and those who get it make fortunes and those who don&#39;t give up fortunes and that&#39;s exactly what we have Happening Now valuation skewed by a handful of mega mega cap stocks if you look at the average stock going back to 2001 levels which is generational buy financial leverage is lower than normal which is good sentiment argues for a continued upcycle in EPS we agree January February seasonality has been the weakest guidance period told you why sandbagger season uh 31% of S&amp;P companies expected to outpace the mag 7 by Q4 20125 up from just 8% in the second half broadening continues ladies and gentlemen UNM magnificent uh 493 earnings growth accelerating magnificent 7 decelerating carry trade unwinding price of the Ukraine bond is going up I don&#39;t know why we I don&#39;t know okay oh the implication is that pie is on the way that that&#39;s a good thing uh bull bear indicator not an extreme not somewhere where you want to be lightening up China not losing the AI race if anything the opposite is happening mag 7 is coming down China uh baxt ba Al Alibaba 10cent zi uh catching up tips huge inflows in the last week Europe huge inflows conclusion by Cheap stocks cheap stocks has underperformed expensive stocks ahead of Market Peaks Market Peaks is the most heavily weighted stocks indices week under the surface huge opportunity it&#39;s like when they did the cover cover about Buffett in 2000 has he lost his touch and he was buying Proctor and Gamble and he was buying cocacola and the next seven years he just blew the S&amp;P out of the water even as the NASDAQ was crashing 80 and 90% he was up huge in those years uh people think because the market crashes everything goes down it&#39;s not the case value is greater than growth uh regime change we&#39;ve covered dividend yield again we&#39;ve covered this Stanley Black and&amp; Decker is a good example uh growth versus value at xco highs I.E 2021 right before you had 2022 value versus growth historical discount remains extreme since most since 2021 and I&#39;m going through some of this number one to reemphasize if you&#39;ve missed the boat so far and now you see it it&#39;s all

they&#39;re going to do all the AI for Apple AI Intelligence on the Apple phones quen 2.5 knocking the cover off the ball relative to deep seek and relative to open AI on most metrics looking ahead Revenue growth at Cloud intelligence group driven by AI will continue to accelerate we will continue to execute against our strategic priorities in e-commerce cloud computing including further investment to drive long-term growth so they generated $5 billion of free cash flow despite all of the investment they&#39;ve been buying they bought in 9% of the stock last year uh they&#39;re growing the business again this has turned from a deep value company back into a growth company and an innovation company their International grew 32% tound t-all their mature businesses grew 9% Cloud

moving in the right direction earnings you know cash flow revenues is the name of the game and good things so we&#39;ll cover that in some more detail next week um\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nmoving along  here gotta get this thing moved over there we go here&#39;s Joe Sai spoke at look at the alibaba&#39;s AI leadership conference I look I I think in fact I actually use the gro uh because I&#39;m I&#39;m on X his Twitter app and uh they provide an inter interface to grock which I use very often I&#39;m very impressed by uh the results um I also use a number of other apps uh a AI apps including our own uh the answer to your question you know this AI race who&#39;s better who a a AI is better the answer yesterday is going to be different from the answer tomorrow right now everybody is in a fairly tight race uh the next model that&#39;s going to be launched is going to be better than some but not others and then somebody else will launch something that&#39;s better than yours and we think we think that&#39;s that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen but what has H you mentioned deep seek and it it&#39;s quite significant uh and that&#39;s because they actually demonstrated that you can use some engineering Innovation to drastically lower the cost of training and inference of large language models uh and and up to this point people are massively investing into these Frontier models uh but here&#39;s the problem if you think about uh training of Frontier models as an Endeavor to educate your kids and you want to uh have the smartest kids uh have you know developed them so that they can uh acquire phds and not just one subject matter but 15 subject Matters from maths to physics to biology to psychology everything you want to have the smartest kids if that&#39;s the case take that into today&#39;s AI race there&#39;s maybe only five or six Rich parents that can afford to have the smartest kids um but is that something that we&#39;re really interested in it&#39;s probably not you have to start to ask yourself what is the purpose of what is the goal of develop veloping AI is this to have the smartest child so that they can win every single Nobel Prize or is it something different like there&#39;s a lot of problems in the world that need to be solved uh there&#39;s a lot of uh issues that we need to use AI to apply AI so that it can be useful and productive and make an economic impact uh so I think people are going to start when they look at the phenomenon of Deep see people are going to start shift away from all right let&#39;s stop putting in hundreds of billions of dollars into compute infrastructure so that we can train the smartest you know PhD and everything that can win the Nobel Prize let&#39;s find out what are the actual problems in the world uh and let&#39;s use AI to uh solve them so a lot of people are going to start putting resources into applications I think that&#39;s number one number two is deep SE has taught us the value of Open Source um uh you know if if today your only purpose in life is to develop a close Source uh AI system that is the smartest PhD student in everything the Nobel prize winning kid uh I personally think the value of that endeavor is approaching zero reference uh in looks like it was the world government Summit in Dubai on February 13th listen to what he had to say he&#39;s basically saying these people investing all this money without specific outcomes are probably not going to get the return on Capital read through the lines and here&#39;s what he said and we&#39;re back and now let&#39;s go through the data of the week okay some of my favorite charts right here ladies and gentlemen number one China&#39;s terrific 10 they now have a name for it Alibaba 10 cent mawan zi byd JD n b gie smic now is beating the Magnificent 7 if you look at the performance of the mag 7 between the China terrific 10 since December 2023 we are now beating the Magnificent 7 ladies and gentlemen up 85% versus the mag 7 Up 81% and at the same time what could be more beautiful than record short interest ready to get absolutely monkey hammered as we rip higher and as I said what did I say ladies and gentlemen they won&#39;t once it breaks through they won&#39;t let anyone in and that&#39;s exactly it&#39;s even surprised me how little they&#39;ve let people in as as enthusiastic as I&#39;ve been no different than go back and listen I was just as enthus if not more enthusiastic when it was at 60 than now when it&#39;s at 135 or 140 whatever it hit this morning um there you go gener",
      "friends Ali effing Baba uh so uh for those of you who&#39;ve been around I I am justified in saying that it has been an unbelievable run here uh and just getting started and I want to emphasize this is super duper important because the first thing that I&#39;ve had everyone&#39;s all so excited smiling so wide we can eat a banana sideways you know there&#39;s nothing like being up huge on a day when the market is crashing and um and they&#39;re all like should we sell some no okay this is the same cognitive bias that people have that like um no this is where you get paid ladies and gentlemen and we haven&#39;t even started to get paid we talked about intrinsic value over the last year and a half two years when we were buying every single dip backing up the truck in the 60s okay just as the stock price vacillates around the cash flow and the intrinsic value of the business which was steady and improving over that time period when the stock was in the gutter on Headline noise it overshoots in price relative to intrinsic value on the downside it is going to dramatically overshoot in price on the upside when this thing gets going so you think oh well now you know it&#39;s going up and we&#39;re 13 times earnings this thing isn&#39;t even going to be near cooked until we&#39;re over 20 times earnings and then by then the fundamentals are going to be so going so much better that they&#39;re going to be all these analysts out there chasing on a people naming their dogs Alibaba and saying it&#39;s the best thing since sliced bread the people that were telling you to sell it in the hole at 60 uh this this game is just beginning so let&#39;s hear what I had to say to Taylor a couple days before earnings here we go now Chinese president xiin ping linked up with China&#39;s private sector Chiefs today in Beijing where he stressed continuity in the country&#39;s economic development X met e-commerce giant Alibaba CEO Jack ma who was at the center of the Chinese government Crackdown on the tech industry in recent years my countdown closer like Alibaba stock despite the company&#39;s past regulatory boo boos and it is great Hill Capital chairman Thomas Hayes who I&#39;m pleased to say joins me now all right make your case for Alibaba well thank you Taylor great to be with you look this wasn&#39;t the perfect pick for us we&#39;ve been buying every single dip for the last two years we bought in the hundreds we backed up the truck in the 60s so across all accounts we at about $83 so it&#39;s had a huge run in the the last 5 weeks uh up about 50% let it rest a little bit they&#39;re going to report earnings on the 20th maybe if you get a pullback after earnings you get a chance to to get in but this is a very special company in terms of valuation number one it&#39;s the number one cloud provider in China it&#39;s also the number one AI provider which we saw in recent weeks with apple linking up stop you there and ask you cuz I just spent two hours with Kevin o on my earlier show and he said this is in effect a game changer I&#39;m those are my words not his but the fact that you have an Apple device in China using Alibaba AI shows that there actually might be a partnership between the US and China is that better for apple or better for Alibaba I think it&#39;s better for both it&#39;s the best model they beat deep seek on many metrics they beat open AI on any many metrics and apple needs the government approval in China and the government is approving Alibaba then that&#39;s just the icing on the cake let&#39;s talk about the cake uh this is a huge play on the middle class recovery uh they were in lockdown for many many years tbell and t-ball it&#39;s like being a toll taker for the bridge every dollar that the middle and upper class are going to spend in this recovery is going to go through Alibaba quite a few of those dollars are going through Alibaba and then",
      "It goes ladies and gentlemen you&#39;re seeing it in real time in Baba you&#39;ve seen it in vernado you&#39;ve seen it in Wells Fargo during Co you saw it in Exxon during Co you saw it in um Rolls-Royce I mean anyway we&#39;re having fun gener what do we got here 210 buy that&#39;s from steel let&#39;s go through the sler charts here open link so look this is what I told Su this this feels like it wants to break out maybe they&#39;ll do one fake out before they take it up dollar rolling over 10year yields rolling over Staples getting bid which we talked about socks in a Range semiconductors Intel&#39;s moving like crazy uh slomer 2 where&#39;s that we&#39;ll find it this is very interesting this is from fun Strat Tom Le after each four-year time of a price consolidation phase small caps launched and rocketed higher relative valuations and earnings growth forecast lend positivity to this cycle repeating if not simply rhyming so looking back ladies and gentlemen what did we talk about you want it to be small caps here&#39;s what happened in the 2002 to 2006 period largest growth in the shortest amount of time breaks out it just goes straight up same thing in 200 the9 period straight up and now we&#39;ve just finished this consolidation we&#39;re going to break out and go straight up same thing in the uh 80s second term of Reagan same exact story straight up for many many years people think stall caps don&#39;t work cuz recency bias last four years consolidating they felt the same during this four years they felt the same during this four years and this four years and once they break out they go straight up so if you don&#39;t have small cap exposure this is your final warning ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to get double the earnings growth Plus for half the multiple and it&#39;s just getting started you want ground floor doesn&#39;t get any more ground floor than that how&#39;s that so Trend and cycle technical uh weekly chart book let&#39;s see here we covered that Breakout equal weight moving in the right direction uh a AI this is what people saying people are most bearish since uh whatever a year ago it&#39;s nonsense by the way only like 300 people take that survey so the people that put weight on that I&#39;m you know it&#39;s it&#39;s worth glancing at but it&#39;s not um here&#39;s your small caps once it&#39;s through here they will not let anyone in maybe they go up and then they retest but start your engines start your engines ladies and gentlemen okay uh Europe breaking out that wasn&#39;t on anyone&#39;s Bingo cards at the beginning of the year except for us who said International would start to outperform and when that starts it happens every 10 to 15 years it&#39;s going to last 10 to 15 years and people are going to say wow that was the opportunity of a lifetime and most people won&#39;t get it till eight years in and then we&#39;ll be selling our shares to them so you heard it here my all of this is opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms uh we don&#39;t know what you should do we work exclusively with family offices ultra high net worth accredited investors uh we all we&#39;re sharing is what we&#39;re doing not what you should do uh or anything of the like um okay what else we got here Tokyo week hasn&#39;t been able to get off the boil Hong Kong breaking out uh hangsang rocking and rolling 10e yield coming down coming down rolling over the Looney coming back like a phoenix From the Ashes wait till you get a new CEO in place when Wayne Gretzky takes over Canada this thing is gonna rock it all right what WTI Crude Futures uh apologies to all my Canadian friends um uh WTI Crude oil futur just been in this range drill baby drill that&#39;s a hard one there&#39;s going to be opportunity in servicers I just don&#39;t know when and I&#39;ll keep an eye on them uh gold have at it enjoy copper if I had to play gold or copper I&#39;d probably play copper that&#39;s to play on China but it&#39;s already moved uh wheat rolling over and I think that&#39;s pretty much okay so now he goes through a number of names PayPal looks like it&#39;s at resistance here on this whatever 50-day moving aage average I would put new money to work there even if it goes a little lower first um so funny that was this was the date June 20th when we put out the article the next pain trade you you literally people were just clamoring they were signing Jensen Wong was like a rockstar signing people&#39;s bras and I said this is the next pain trade it was literally on this tick and you can go back and look at it article was on June 20th and uh it immediately crashed and it has not yet retaken those highs going on you know 3 quarters of a year maybe maybe it does maybe it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not I&#39;m not paying that 50 time sales have had it um no no I&#39;m happy with Intel uh kweb my buddy Brendan ahar rock and roll great golfer can&#39;t by the way uh anyway got to got to call him and get get back out there when he&#39;s on the west coast uh K web is breaking out for those of you who want diversification Baba broke through this line I told you anyway very excited uh 10 cent Philip 66 it&#39;s good to look at these things let&#39;s see V all right nothing really super standout is here re well we got the crown castle all right good stuff there uh what else do we need to talk about here 10year yield going back over value to growth this game is just starting ladies and gentlemen start your engines values outperformed growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 what does that mean in English it means that if you had invested in value over growth since 1927 you put in a million dollars in each strategy you would have 68 more million dollars by investing in value so you&#39;d have ballparking now 100 to 120 uh if you invested in growth if you&#39;re lucky because you have bigger draw downs and you would have 170 with value so uh you&#39;re call because everyone is stuck in recency bias the last 15 years growth is outperformed value game has changed cap light you know uh capex light blah blah blah the game is always this way nifty50 decom it happens every single cycle just like International to domestic and sooner or later it normalizes and you revert to the mean and those who get it make fortunes and those who don&#39;t give up fortunes and that&#39;s exactly what we have Happening Now valuation skewed by a handful of mega mega cap stocks if you look at the average stock going back to 2001 levels which is generational buy financial leverage is lower than normal which is good sentiment argues for a continued upcycle in EPS we agree January February seasonality has been the weakest guidance period told you why sandbagger season uh 31% of S&amp;P companies expected to outpace the mag 7 by Q4 20125 up from just 8% in the second half broadening continues ladies and gentlemen UNM magnificent uh 493 earnings growth accelerating magnificent 7 decelerating carry trade unwinding price of the Ukraine bond is going up I don&#39;t know why we I don&#39;t know okay oh the implication is that pie is on the way that that&#39;s a good thing uh bull bear indicator not an extreme not somewhere where you want to be lightening up China not losing the AI race if

straight up for many many years people think stall caps don&#39;t work cuz recency bias last four years consolidating they felt the same during this four years they felt the same during this four years and this four years and once they break out they go straight up so if you don&#39;t have small cap exposure this is your final warning ladies and gentlemen that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to

know 3 quarters of a year maybe maybe it does maybe it doesn&#39;t I don&#39;t care I&#39;m not I&#39;m not paying that 50 time sales have had it um no no I&#39;m happy with Intel uh kweb my buddy

want diversification Baba broke through this line I told you anyway very excited uh 10 cent Philip 66 it&#39;s good to look at these things let&#39;s see V all right nothing really super standout is here re well we got the crown castle all right good stuff there uh what else do we need to talk about here 10year yield going back over value to growth this game is just starting ladies and gentlemen start your engines values outperformed growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 what does that mean in English it means that if you had invested in value over growth since 1927 you put in a million dollars in each strategy you would have 68 more million dollars by investing in value so you&#39;d have ballparking now 100 to 120 uh if you invested in growth if you&#39;re lucky because you have bigger draw downs and you would have 170 with value so uh you&#39;re call because everyone is stuck in recency bias the last 15 years growth is outperformed value game has changed cap light you know uh capex light blah blah blah the game is always this way nifty50 decom it happens every single cycle just like International to domestic and sooner or later it normalizes and you revert to the mean and those who get it make fortunes and those who don&#39;t give up fortunes and that&#39;s exactly what we have Happening Now valuation skewed by a handful of mega mega cap stocks if you look at the average stock going back to 2001 levels which is generational buy financial leverage is lower than normal which is good sentiment argues for a continued upcycle in EPS we agree January February seasonality

cover about Buffett in 2000 has he lost his touch and he was buying Proctor and Gamble and he was buying cocacola and the next seven years he just blew the S&amp;P out of the water even as the NASDAQ was crashing 80 and 90% he was up huge in those years uh people think because the market crashes everything goes down it&#39;s not the case value is greater than growth uh regime change we&#39;ve covered dividend yield again we&#39;ve covered this Stanley Black and&amp; Decker is a good example uh growth versus value at xco highs I.E 2021 right before you had 2022 value versus growth historical discount remains extreme since most since 2021 and I&#39;m going through some of this number one to reemphasize if you&#39;ve missed the boat so far and now you see it it&#39;s all
