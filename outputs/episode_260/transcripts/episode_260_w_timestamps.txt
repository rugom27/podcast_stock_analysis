[138.239s] catching up with them in the green room
[140.0s] and also with Mark terer who I didn&#39;t
[141.56s] have a chance to uh to get a picture
[143.44s] with uh speaking of
[145.76s] media uh want to thank Preston misel and
[148.519s] of course Christian D and steuart vanney
[151.44s] for having me on the show today we&#39;re
[153.48s] going to listen in here uh let&#39;s get
[155.599s] back to the markets the biggest gainers
[157.4s] on the Dow accounting for some of this
[159.519s] 164 Point gain are Goldman United Health
[162.72s] and caterpillar they&#39;re all up sharply
[164.76s] Dow&#39;s up 158 points uh Tom Tom Hayes
[168.56s] joins me now uh you watch the market for
[171.12s] us okay we&#39;ve got the CPI tomorrow
[173.48s] Consumer Price Index is expected to go
[176.04s] up 2.3% year-over-year 2.3% inflation if
[180.0s] it does that does the market rally I
[182.599s] think it&#39;s good for the market I the
[184.28s] thing that I&#39;ve learned over the years
[185.599s] to is the secret to happiness in life is
[187.92s] low expectations so we&#39;ve got a low
[191.04s] inflation number at
[192.68s] 2.3% which is uh inconsistent with what
[196.36s] is expected of the FED in November an
[198.64s] 87% chance of a 25 basis point cut a
[202.519s] 78% chance of a 25 basis cut in December
[205.76s] so so long as that number&#39;s in the
[207.48s] neighborhood of 2.3% they&#39;re going to
[209.799s] follow through with those cuts that adds
[211.599s] liquidity to the market and I think
[214.04s] maybe a few bumps in October but I think
[216.12s] going into year end we&#39;re going to be
[217.4s] just fine and the fed&#39;s going to follow
[218.84s] through with those cuts so the market
[220.599s] rallies the market will go up on balance
[223.68s] before the end of the year does it rally
[225.319s] the next minute perhaps uh the key is
[228.519s] liquidity is coming from everywhere
[229.92s] around the world we&#39;ve had the most
[231.28s] amount of Central Bank Cuts happen since
[234.2s] 2020 and 20 uh 2009 those were times to
[237.879s] be buyers of equities not sellers make a
[240.079s] big distinction between the Magnificent
[241.799s] Seven which have almost stalled not
[244.4s] quite stalled but they&#39;re not making the
[245.84s] big gains that they were versus the
[247.56s] other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that&#39;s
[251.64s] where you want to put the money right
[253.319s] that&#39;s right you don&#39;t want to swim
[254.36s] against the tide here we started the
[256.239s] year the Magnificent 7 had 50% earnings
[259.12s] growth they&#39;re down to the mid teens
[261.4s] earnings growth whereas the
[263.56s] unmagnify they had negative earnings
[265.68s] growth until the most recent quarter
[267.08s] they&#39;ve just started to inflect positive
[268.96s] and as that trend continues they&#39;re
[270.199s] going to be at Mid teens earnings growth
[272.08s] over the next couple of quarters that&#39;s
[273.52s] where all the money is going to be made
[274.52s] to there are still stocks down 50% 60%
[278.6s] 70% that are great companies that are
[280.639s] going to be doubles over the next 2
[282.0s] three years all right Tom Hayes we
[284.08s] understand thanks so much for joining us
[285.72s] comes here again soon Ashley and we&#39;re
[289.0s] back and then wanted to thank Maryanne
[292.08s] star
[293.32s] in and for having me on on CNA
[299.88s] news Asia which is like the BBC of
[301.919s] Singapore last night listening here now
[305.84s] let&#39;s bring in Thomas Hayes chairman and
[308.28s] managing member from great Hill capital
[311.919s] good evening to you Thomas so basically
[314.479s] at the moment we are looking at uh you
[317.24s] know more volatilities in the market
[320.0s] since the start of October so looking
[323.12s] ahead what kind of you know downside
[326.12s] risks that investors should be should be
[328.52s] watching out for
[332.039s] well thanks for having me Henry I think
[334.0s] that it&#39;s simply that time of year uh if
[336.919s] you look at the presidential cycle the
[338.919s] fourth year during an election year
[341.4s] tends to be a more choppy season we&#39;re
[344.52s] trading at 21 times forward earnings the
[347.24s] market is pretty fully valued and we&#39;re
[349.919s] starting earnings season uh this Friday
[352.88s] with the big Banks JP Morgan City Bank
[355.8s] are going to report earnings earnings
[357.16s] are expected to be a little bit lower
[359.28s] because of light Lo loan demand and
[362.12s] decreasing net interest margin so I
[364.479s] think you could see some choppiness and
[366.319s] some uncertainty into the election we
[368.84s] have raised some profits raised a little
[370.72s] bit of cash to be able to buy in if we
[373.28s] get any weakness before the election and
[375.28s] I think once the election clears Henry
[378.319s] uh after early November I think you&#39;re
[380.28s] going to see a year-end rally there&#39;s a
[382.0s] lot of pent up demand a lot of managers
[383.96s] behind their index that will have to
[385.4s] chase into year end and we&#39;re also
[388.319s] closely watching us inflation number
[390.479s] coming out later this week um in the
[393.199s] situation that fed is less aggressive in
[396.479s] its rate cut plan uh so how do you think
[400.12s] investors should prepare for that kind
[402.08s] of
[404.479s] situation well headline inflation is
[406.759s] projected to come in lower than last
[408.84s] month uh 2.5 last month expectations are
[411.599s] for just 2.3 this month which is uh very
[415.68s] subdued inflation which would actually
[418.319s] put a uh a a clear indication that we
[421.879s] could see 25 more basis points of cuts
[424.319s] in November and 25 more basis Cuts in
[428.36s] December so a total of 50 more basis
[430.4s] points Cuts provided that number comes
[432.4s] in as weak as anticipated headline
[434.8s] inflation on Thursday so we&#39;ve got the
[436.879s] inflation numbers on Thursday that are
[438.319s] going to be critical as as it determines
[440.16s] what the FED is going to do in November
[441.84s] and December and we have earnings the
[444.759s] key thing about earnings is expectations
[447.28s] for Q3 earnings growth uh as of June
[450.36s] 30th we&#39;re
[452.0s] 7.8% analysts have brought down
[454.84s] expectations to just 4.2% so they&#39;ve
[457.759s] lowered the bar and uh a saying I always
[460.68s] like to say Henry is the secret to
[462.52s] happiness is low expectations and
[465.12s] they&#39;ve set the bar low for Q3 so we may
[468.0s] see some positive earning surprises as
[470.319s] the weeks we on uh which should should
[472.919s] bode well for the end of year
[474.72s] performance after the election clears M
[477.56s] and we are seeing some rotation
[479.12s] happening especially in Tech sector as
[481.319s] well as small cap stocks uh what&#39;s your
[484.039s] take on those
[486.68s] yes yeah I think what you see
[489.68s] historically after the first fed cut and
[492.36s] today was a one-off certainly teched
[494.12s] well they&#39;ve been beat down the last
[496.0s] couple of months so they&#39;re GNA they&#39;re
[497.36s] going to see a bounce but I think if you
[498.96s] look past a few days or a few weeks
[501.759s] after the first cut in the easing cycle
[504.12s] begins what we&#39;re seeing is a broadening
[506.72s] of participation in the market so the
[509.0s] tech center magnificent 7 have been
[512.279s] underperforming uh in recent weeks and
[515.039s] the UNM magnificent 493 I like to call
[517.599s] them the rest of the S&amp;P 500 have been
[519.599s] outperforming you&#39;ll see it in fits and
[521.479s] starts but on balance for the next 12 to
[523.88s] 18 months we believe that theme is going
[525.68s] to persist which does mean small caps
[528.519s] will start to outperform large caps
[530.76s] that&#39;s historically true in the first 12
[532.839s] months following a Fed cut uh by 11%
[536.12s] small caps outperform value stocks
[538.72s] outperform growth stocks in the first
[540.8s] six months after the first fed cut and
[543.519s] Emerging Markets will start to
[546.399s] outperform developed markets for their
[548.72s] first time in basically a decade and
[551.64s] that&#39;s due to number one uh a continued
[554.959s] trend of a weakening dollar
[569.76s] and the Chinese government although they
[571.64s] didn&#39;t give the market what they wanted
[573.519s] today after a 50% rally we gave in a
[577.079s] handful of weeks we gave a little bit
[578.88s] back today and probably will for the
[580.56s] next couple of weeks uh consolidate
[583.0s] those gains uh they&#39;ll be back in the
[585.44s] market their initial indication was they
[587.6s] were going to do what it was What It
[589.04s] Takes and I don&#39;t believe they want to
[592.0s] uh give up the gains that they&#39;ve
[593.519s] already seen and get their country back
[596.0s] to that 5% Target that they set all
[599.04s] right Thomas thank you for your analysis
[600.68s] Thomas Hayes chairman and managing
[602.76s] member with great Hill
[604.92s] capital and we&#39;re back and then quotes
[607.519s] of the week and there&#39;s so many quotes
[608.959s] of the week because they were all
[610.16s] perfect so our new guy Jeff is just
[612.44s] doing a good job of picking these or
[614.04s] he&#39;s just getting lucky with the timing
[615.519s] but I think he&#39;s doing a great job this
[617.36s] is Ray Delio the biggest mistake
[619.0s] investors make is to believe that what
[620.6s] happened in the recent past is likely to
[623.36s] persist I&#39;ve talked about that a lot on
[625.36s] the podcast it&#39;s called recency bias and
[628.16s] we&#39;re gonna actually spend some time on
[630.519s] it today as it relates to China Seth
[633.0s] claran the single greatest Edge an
[635.24s] investor can have is long-term
[637.44s] orientation I call it time Arbitrage
[640.24s] when your framework is right you get
[642.399s] paid for sitting on your hands
[644.12s] entrepreneurs get rich through Massive
[646.079s] Action great investors get rich through
[648.639s] massive inaction and very few people can
[652.0s] do it uh when
[654.0s] things you do things oh by the way key
[657.44s] announcement for brand for
[660.839s] existing and new clients I sent you an
[665.68s] email tonight with two very important
[670.48s] points I can tell you right now you are
[673.76s] going to be smiling so wide you could
[676.32s] eat a banana sideways and uh the first
[680.32s] point you&#39;re GNA love and the second
[682.72s] point you are the first ones to have
[685.24s] access to this and we&#39;ll keep it that
[687.44s] way for some time before we roll it out
[690.079s] so do check your email if you didn&#39;t get
[693.16s] an email entitled
[695.44s] important uh uh reach out to me but uh
[699.2s] but it&#39;s going to be a a good good read
[701.8s] for you uh here&#39;s Buffett you do things
[705.12s] when the opportunities come along I&#39;ve
[706.76s] had periods in my life when I&#39;ve had a
[708.32s] bundle of ideas come along and I&#39;ve had
[710.04s] long dry spells if I get an idea next
[712.72s] week I&#39;ll do something if not I won&#39;t do
[714.48s] a damn thing and that&#39;s very interesting
[716.76s] because we&#39;ve had a lot of money coming
[718.32s] in the last week
[719.839s] and I I&#39;ve actually purposefully and for
[723.0s] those of you who are existing clients
[724.639s] you know we&#39;ve taken profits on a lot of
[727.44s] options that we&#39;ve made a lot of money
[729.639s] on and uh but we&#39;ve kept all the stock
[733.36s] and
[734.4s] [Music]
[735.76s] um uh so the first thing that I said to
[738.199s] all the new money that came in is don&#39;t
[740.959s] be surprised if we&#39;re sitting on cash
[743.839s] for a few weeks uh into the election we
[747.44s] want to be in a position to take
[749.76s] advantage of any dislocation or seasonal
[752.56s] or pre-election Jitters if they come
[754.36s] along if they don&#39;t come along there&#39;s
[755.8s] always stuff to do and we&#39;ve been able
[757.0s] to put work to money to work but if you
[760.0s] are thinking about coming in or adding
[763.16s] money a lot of people have been adding
[764.56s] money to their accounts um Now&#39;s the
[768.24s] Time to do it even if it sits and
[770.16s] collects interest at interactive brokers
[772.04s] for two or three weeks until I can
[773.68s] pounce it&#39;s one name we&#39;re already going
[775.079s] to start pouncing on but um uh go ahead
[779.24s] and do that and you don&#39;t want to try to
[782.12s] get money in
[784.8s] when it&#39;s middle of the the opportunity
[788.199s] cycle you want the money sitting there
[789.88s] ready to go and uh and ready to pounce
[792.56s] and that&#39;s what Buffett&#39;s talk talking
[794.079s] about so you
[795.639s] know
[797.76s] um that&#39;s how you balance it so uh great
[800.959s] quote there and then Robert AR not
[803.16s] successful contrarian investment
[804.6s] requires us to live with discomfort for
[807.56s] being wrong and alone uh but Bargains do
[810.36s] not exist in the absence of fear we&#39;ve
[812.24s] seen that with Alibaba uh you know we&#39;ve
[814.519s] been through the hellscape and now uh
[816.88s] we&#39;re getting into the sunshine and here
[820.36s] is a key lesson uh what most people do
[824.76s] is they forget why they got into the
[826.639s] business and the minute they start
[828.16s] making a lot of profits they are so
[830.079s] quick to want to sell the profits and
[832.36s] book a win or get back to even and get
[834.519s] out that is a cognitive bias that is so
[838.04s] disconnected from what is the value of
[840.6s] the underlying business today based on
[842.68s] its earnings power cash flow and what do
[844.519s] we expect uh relative to tomorrow and
[847.079s] and the fact of the matter is it&#39;s been
[848.48s] derated due to despondency and pessimism
[851.8s] uh which is going to eventually turn
[854.12s] into Euphoria and uh greed and we&#39;re
[857.44s] nowhere near that point yet uh so don&#39;t
[860.72s] make the Fatal mistake that people do
[863.0s] when a position takes longer than
[864.48s] expected and uh they get stuck in what&#39;s
[869.399s] happened in the recent past will persist
[871.839s] I.E things have been terrible in China
[873.839s] therefore things are going to stay
[874.8s] terrible in China it&#39;s usually just the
[877.399s] opposite all intelligent investing is
[879.839s] value investing acquiring more than you
[881.92s] are paying for you must value the
[883.88s] business in order to Value the stock
[885.24s] Charlie Munger by the way Charlie Munger
[887.0s] had a huge position
[889.68s] in uh Alibaba and uh inside of the daily
[895.079s] The Daily
[896.36s] Journal or was it West CO
[899.68s] it was the it was the newspaper company
[902.279s] that he had anyway I forget what the
[904.48s] name of it was it&#39;s late it&#39;s been a
[906.24s] long day but uh I got to get this done
[908.399s] because I&#39;m headed out to Arizona to see
[910.56s] the water polo tournament this weekend
[912.959s] super excited to watch uh rocktober in
[916.32s] Scottdale not bringing my golf clubs
[918.8s] going to spend all the time with them uh
[921.279s] and back on Monday so
[924.839s] um so you must value the business in
[927.399s] order to value
[929.519s] stock uh and this is what we try to
[931.639s] teach every single week here and finally
[933.72s] Benjamin Graham most of the time Common
[936.56s] Stocks are subject to irrational excess
[939.079s] excessive price fluctuations in both
[941.519s] directions as the consequence of the
[943.639s] ingrain tendency of most people to
[945.72s] speculate or gamble to give way to Hope
[949.399s] fear and greed and we try to take
[951.04s] advantage of that and benefit from that
[953.759s] uh let&#39;s go into our data for the week
[958.0s] this is a critical important lesson
[959.68s] ladies and gentlemen uh there is an
[962.24s] author at or writer at Barons that we&#39;ve
[965.079s] talked about in the past and this
[969.0s] person is chronically
[973.759s] pessimistic
[977.759s] uh without
[979.959s] fail about
[982.279s] China and I want you to see how opinion
[986.519s] follows Trend as evidenced by by this
[989.399s] writer&#39;s headlines over the last three
[991.72s] two two about a year and a half two
[994.04s] years um so here is two days ago uh when
[1001.16s] uh the market gave back a few points
[1004.0s] after you know 50% rally in a few weeks
[1006.36s] China&#39;s stock surge could fizzle soon
[1008.56s] here&#39;s what to look for then here is
[1011.36s] what happened when the market was up 50%
[1014.44s] in a few weeks same same author Beijing
[1017.48s] has started a new bull market Market
[1019.48s] here&#39;s what stocks to own so when it
[1022.04s] goes up 50% in 4 weeks the headline is
[1024.48s] Beijing has started a new bull market
[1026.559s] here&#39;s what stocks to own uh just a few
[1029.12s] days later when the market corrects a
[1031.12s] little bit China&#39;s stock surge could
[1033.64s] fizzle soon here&#39;s what to look for same
[1035.6s] person same view uh different view um uh
[1040.72s] largest weekly inflow ever to China
[1042.559s] Equity Funds which is why we told you
[1044.28s] last week they will punish this late
[1046.4s] money you know I&#39;m I&#39;m always looking at
[1048.6s] Bob you can look at K web whatever that
[1050.84s] came in around 120 they&#39;ll smoke them
[1053.16s] out they&#39;ll they&#39;ll puke it in the hole
[1055.16s] whether that&#39;s 105 I think 98 95 gets
[1058.32s] them out of their stock that that they
[1060.039s] bought at 115 uh and then we rip higher
[1062.96s] if we get to the high 90s I&#39;m going to
[1064.4s] put the options back on that we took off
[1066.32s] 5 six 7x depending on when the account
[1069.039s] was started and and the and the
[1070.679s] opportunities that were available at the
[1072.32s] time um that was just huge for us and
[1074.84s] that&#39;s why we&#39;re sitting on so much cash
[1076.24s] from the from the option profits and
[1078.4s] we&#39;re going to just be patient to deploy
[1080.24s] it uh outside of that one name we&#39;re
[1082.52s] going to pounce on stock turnover surges
[1085.159s] on Hong Kong Aid rally so that&#39;s that
[1089.08s] now I I just want to go through these
[1091.08s] headlines to make a point how these type
[1094.919s] of headlines take you out of Quality
[1097.0s] Companies when you don&#39;t know what you
[1098.4s] own and when you do know what you own
[1101.08s] you still have to have ice in your veins
[1103.28s] and internal
[1104.64s] fortitude um to sit through because it&#39;s
[1107.96s] it&#39;s relentless here fomo and China

[1205.52s] spying by the way this person is gonna
[1207.24s] be forced to write the most glowing
[1209.32s] headlines when alibaba&#39;s at 200 it&#39;s
[1211.48s] going to say China&#39;s rally is just
[1213.24s] getting started uh why investors Can&#39;t

[1220.0s] we&#39;re going to be selling the minute
[1221.28s] they say that China&#39;s GDP is going to

[1234.799s] reinsure investors China&#39;s latest
[1236.679s] economic plan doesn&#39;t offer much to
[1238.159s] Bulls you know all of this was in the
[1240.159s] hole taking you out of your stock at the
[1242.32s] exact wrong times so you&#39;ve missed the
[1244.76s] whole run up I&#39;m not saying you because
[1247.2s] people listening to this have probably
[1248.84s] been more steadfast but uh China stocks
[1251.919s] are and this is why if you don&#39;t know
[1254.24s] what you own and you haven&#39;t done your
[1255.4s] own work it doesn&#39;t matter who you
[1257.72s] follow or what you follow follow you&#39;re
[1259.159s] going to get shaken out from nonsense
[1261.159s] like this China stocks are rebounding
[1262.679s] but maybe not for long China Bulls
[1264.28s] beware winding down the zero Co policy I
[1266.4s] mean this is like a hired Hitman uh for
[1270.08s] anti-china headlines
[1273.12s] and I&#39;ll give you a hint though it would
[1276.36s] be like hiring an Iranian to write
[1278.76s] headlines about Israel I mean you know
[1281.76s] you just can&#39;t make this stuff up I mean
[1283.52s] the bias is so pronounced and sadly it&#39;s
[1287.32s] taken so many people out of stock out of
[1290.12s] Baba at 60 and 70 uh and now they were
[1293.88s] forced to buy it at 115 120 and they&#39;re
[1296.76s] getting their teeth knocked out and at
[1298.44s] 95 they&#39;re going to sell in the hole
[1300.08s] again because she&#39;s going to write more
[1301.44s] bad headlines or someone like her and
[1304.159s] then it&#39;s going to Rally back well past
[1306.12s] 140 and the next stop will be 160 and at
[1308.72s] that point she&#39;ll say don&#39;t believe it
[1310.919s] and they they&#39;ll all buy up and then
[1312.88s] it&#39;ll pull back to 140 and we&#39;ve gone
[1314.919s] through this they&#39;ll sell in the hole
[1316.919s] and then it&#39;s 200 everyone&#39;s going to
[1318.76s] want it pull back to 180 it it&#39;s just
[1321.159s] going to be over and over and over X&#39;s
[1323.36s] third term spells trouble for investors
[1325.64s] G China&#39;s party Congress offers little
[1327.799s] for the economy look I took the time to
[1330.559s] copy and paste these for a reason this
[1332.44s] is a monster education if you buy
[1336.84s] Quality Companies when they&#39;re marked
[1338.44s] down and have confidence in your work
[1340.2s] and your framework you can withstand
[1342.2s] this because this is what you have to go
[1344.4s] through to get these stocks at a bargain
[1346.84s] at a dislocated period period because
[1349.559s] they don&#39;t give away multi baggage for
[1351.08s] free that&#39;s just the way the world Works
[1352.48s] ladies and gentlemen um so here&#39;s the
[1356.0s] expected S&amp;P 500 earnings growth mag 7
[1359.4s] versus
[1363.76s] unmagnify as I talked about this is from
[1366.039s] fact set so um the 493 has just turned
[1370.32s] the corner from negative to positive
[1372.24s] then they start to catch the Magnificent
[1373.96s] 7 remember the Magnificent 7 was at 50%
[1376.24s] earnings growth just two quarters ago
[1378.0s] now it&#39;s down going down to 17 and 16
[1380.44s] and 15 and 14 whereas the 493 were at
[1383.48s] negative now they&#39;re 1.7 13.9 14.2 by q1
[1388.48s] 13.0 Q2 of next year uh 15.6 of
[1394.12s] Q3 so that&#39;s the story
[1397.279s] there um we saw the jobs report was
[1401.24s] good uh here&#39;s the Hang saying got up to
[1403.88s] this resistance pulled back everyone&#39;s
[1405.96s] panicking saying it&#39;s a fake out they&#39;re
[1407.72s] not going to do this stimulus they have
[1409.36s] to do the stimulus they pivoted not
[1411.559s] because they wanted to because they were
[1412.799s] forced to and that will follow through
[1415.2s] and even if you remember if you don&#39;t
[1416.64s] listen to what I&#39;m telling you listen to
[1418.08s] what David teer said last week he said
[1420.84s] you know uh we&#39;ve already gone over our
[1423.48s] position limits if we&#39;re lucky enough to
[1425.6s] get a pullback and shake some people out
[1427.96s] we&#39;re going to again break our upside uh
[1430.919s] position limits and buy more and these
[1432.88s] are the type of Headlines by the way not
[1435.2s] only am I sending a Christmas card to X
[1437.32s] for waiting so long and forcing me to
[1439.0s] buy so much stock at low prices to bring
[1440.84s] my bases down so low I&#39;m also going to
[1443.039s] send a Christmas card to this author to
[1446.24s] this uh journalist uh for taking so many
[1449.4s] people out of their stock so we could
[1451.0s] buy it low and now have the benefits of
[1453.559s] riding it higher and uh and we&#39;re just
[1455.76s] in the early days for those of you who
[1457.4s] think the last few weeks has been the
[1459.36s] greatest thing since sliced bread with
[1460.799s] all the money we made on the options and
[1462.72s] even the stock which has been phenomenal
[1465.6s] uh you ain&#39;t seen nothing yet so if you
[1468.159s] think the email I sent you tonight has
[1470.48s] you smiling so wide you could eat a
[1472.039s] banana sideways uh wait till you see
[1474.679s] what&#39;s to come uh okay so moving
[1478.2s] on uh doc workers strike okay so that&#39;s
[1481.559s] funny you know that guy was uh it&#39;s
[1485.12s] hysterical uh he said you know He was
[1487.36s] cursing on TV saying we&#39;re GNA hold up
[1489.44s] the whole world blah blah blah until
[1491.24s] they give us what we want one article in
[1493.2s] the New York Post showing an overhead
[1495.6s] picture of his 7,000 foot mansion and
[1498.08s] his Bentley parked in the driveway and
[1500.0s] the thing was it was settled in 24 hours
[1503.08s] you can&#39;t make this stuff up all right
[1505.6s] so this shows China stimulus in 2018
[1508.32s] 2016 2020 followed by a rise in
[1511.24s] valuation so we&#39;re well below the mean
[1514.08s] uh PE average and we can and again we&#39;re
[1517.96s] derated by 50% and that excludes the
[1520.24s] earnings growth that we&#39;re going to see
[1521.48s] in the next 24 months uh so you can do
[1524.08s] the math on that which means double on
[1526.88s] current earnings power as it re rates
[1528.799s] and then as earning power expands you
[1531.279s] add to that China property Shanghai and
[1533.24s] Shenzhen luxury home sales soar after
[1536.279s] stimulus
[1537.399s] package largest weekly flow inflow ever
[1541.36s] into Emerging Market Equity Funds
[1543.159s] including China of course they got to
[1545.36s] get their teeth kicked in after Chasing
[1547.399s] the top and then once they&#39;re fully
[1549.799s] despondent because they sold at the
[1551.36s] bottom bought at the top flush them out
[1553.72s] again uh they&#39;ll never come back except
[1556.2s] when we hit 200 on Alibaba and uh and
[1559.44s] that&#39;ll be that emerging market equities
[1561.399s] at lowest versus us since 1969 I think a
[1564.44s] better framework is 1999 everything&#39;s
[1567.48s] setting up very similarly to that uh and
[1570.88s] 2022 to
[1573.08s] 202000 20 2001 to 2007 we covered it a
[1576.88s] million times small caps emerging
[1579.039s] markets and it&#39;s playing
[1580.679s] out okay uh average annualized returns
[1585.2s] during us political regimes it shows
[1587.559s] when you have full Republican control is
[1589.44s] the best for small caps when you have a
[1592.72s] split uh let&#39;s see here the second best
[1596.559s] is full Democratic control so small caps
[1599.0s] like full control from either party the
[1600.96s] rest of the market prefers a split
[1605.48s] uh okay Japan rules out Bank bank of
[1608.799s] Japan interest rate hikes for now okay
[1611.2s] that means until after the election
[1612.559s] they&#39;re going to have to do it because
[1613.6s] of their inflation here&#39;s kweb which had
[1616.48s] the largest fund flow uh Brendan runs
[1619.6s] that uh by the way I shared uh with you
[1622.48s] super great guy super great golfer by
[1624.36s] the way great course uh that he that he
[1626.76s] invited me to uh so biggest weekly
[1629.72s] inflow so you know you get these type of
[1631.6s] spikes and then it&#39;s got you know you
[1633.0s] got this at the beginning of the last
[1634.399s] rally in
[1636.2s] 2019 and then it kind of cools down uh
[1639.559s] and the market goes up uh utility seor
[1642.279s] this is overdone it&#39;s already started
[1643.88s] rolling over we warned you about that
[1645.84s] hope you took advantage uh China equity
[1648.32s] has delivered one of the strongest and
[1649.559s] most concentrated rallies in its history
[1651.799s] so far which implies more upside moving
[1655.52s] out if you look at historical
[1657.559s] models uh 10 reasons to buy China Equity
[1660.799s] this was two days ago government has
[1662.799s] revealed its pain threshold so they
[1664.48s] finally blink this time is different
[1666.64s] investors are getting what they hope to
[1668.12s] for a large extent don&#39;t fight the pboc
[1671.559s] policy U-turn provoked reating trades
[1673.64s] that seldom stopped there powerful and
[1675.96s] tradable rallies can exist even a pro
[1678.36s] deflationary bar Market inexpensive call
[1681.039s] options fomo has room to run profit
[1683.84s] Outlook is improving FedEd loose fed has
[1686.799s] loosened one constraint on China&#39;s
[1688.799s] stimulus and China Equity still has a
[1691.44s] place in in in uh investor portfolios
[1694.799s] ironically this is from the same shop
[1697.279s] sside shop that had a uninvestable
[1700.039s] rating on it uh before it rally 50%
[1703.48s] equities R tend to rise when interest
[1705.679s] rates fall so long as there no recession
[1707.88s] we&#39;ve covered that same
[1710.96s] thing
[1713.12s] uh this is the liquidity that I was
[1715.96s] referring to on Varan Co we&#39;ve got the
[1719.399s] most fed Cuts 26 in the month of
[1722.44s] September uh globally that we&#39;ve had
[1725.2s] since 2020 and 2009 those were times to
[1728.24s] be buyers of equities not sellers of
[1730.279s] equities so we&#39;ll pick our spots smart
[1732.44s] thing to keep an eye on is uh earnings
[1734.76s] estimates have come down from
[1736.559s] 227 to uh
[1739.559s] 277 278 down to
[1742.24s] 276 um you know I also referenced with
[1745.72s] Stu the secret to happiness is low
[1748.039s] expectations so estimates for
[1751.2s] earnings
[1752.72s] um have gone from
[1754.96s] 7.8% for Q3 on June 30th to 4.2% for
[1761.64s] Q3 uh uh right now so they&#39;ve lowered
[1765.84s] the bar which will make it easy to step
[1767.36s] over which a positive surprise uh
[1770.12s] getting through earning season although
[1771.76s] Banks start Friday they&#39;re expected to
[1773.6s] be weak because of low net interest
[1775.84s] margin and slower loan demand uh that is
[1779.84s] going to be followed up soon by the IPO
[1782.72s] machine kicking off and uh probably
[1786.399s] looks like maybe they&#39;ll get bang some
[1789.08s] out here in Q4 and try to get bonuses
[1791.32s] you know I I mean given how Bankers
[1792.88s] think I wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all to
[1795.039s] to just like the election clears and
[1796.84s] they just start banging out I which
[1798.48s] would imply they&#39;ll probably have a
[1799.519s] decent fourth quarter uh we took profits
[1802.48s] on all the big Banks over the summer uh
[1804.6s] we still own a regional basket which we
[1807.0s] will hang on to um and maybe read the
[1811.44s] the banks if they fall back but uh not
[1813.399s] holding our breath that was a good
[1815.159s] trade
[1818.76s] um you know here was net call volume in
[1822.039s] the fxi obviously you got to smoke all
[1824.08s] these people with the premium once you
[1826.0s] burn through that premium you can start
[1827.559s] to ride again uh which is also what we
[1830.36s] said about October if you remember that
[1833.2s] there was so much we talked about the
[1835.32s] put skew that there was so much premium
[1837.559s] purchased on a catastro catastrophic
[1841.399s] fall that probably the most pain to the
[1845.12s] most amount of people which is what the
[1846.6s] stock market is designed to do would be
[1848.679s] grinding sideways through the month of
[1850.32s] October which is basically what&#39;s
[1852.08s] happened um on a day-to-day basis and
[1855.2s] all of that put premiums getting burned
[1857.08s] through uh which makes a lot of sense
[1861.44s] so uh let&#39;s see what else do we have
[1864.12s] here so oh this is a great chart this
[1866.639s] Shanghai shenzen CSI 300 index you can
[1870.679s] see after these parabolic moves like you
[1872.36s] saw in 2020 uh it grinded sideways
[1875.519s] before it made another huge move
[1877.799s] straight up so this would be
[1879.88s] normal uh and we covered the two
[1882.639s] scenarios we&#39;re going to cover a couple
[1884.639s] scenarios in the article of the week
[1888.08s] but one of our things that we said that
[1889.88s] had to happen What We Needed the FED to
[1891.6s] cut that happened all of a sudden China
[1893.799s] stimulates it&#39;s off to the roof we
[1895.2s] needed China bond yields to go up look
[1897.519s] what&#39;s happened in the last few weeks
[1898.84s] trying of bond yields have gone up and
[1901.08s] look what else happened that that I said
[1902.679s] had to happen is the Yuan needed to
[1904.96s] appreciate relative to the US dollar
[1906.76s] look what started to happen in the
[1908.2s] recent weeks so all the pieces that
[1910.399s] we&#39;ve laid out for you are all coming
[1912.48s] together at once new natural gas power
[1914.76s] plants announced in 2024 continue to
[1917.96s] grow as these data centers grow it&#39;s
[1919.799s] going to be good for com stock which we
[1922.0s] love and we own uh option skew we
[1924.96s] covered
[1925.88s] ourselves uh value versus growth in
[1928.24s] different interest rate environments
[1930.0s] value outperforms growth in a four plus
[1932.72s] percent interest rate environment I
[1934.919s] think that is going to be uh
[1939.679s] potentially I think the terminal rate is
[1941.799s] going to be higher than most people
[1943.36s] think and we&#39;ve talked about that um and
[1946.32s] and and and that&#39;s predicated my view
[1948.279s] that this is more like 1995 a midcycle
[1952.399s] easing which would imply you know 125
[1955.36s] basis points and then off to the races
[1957.44s] for another four to five years and in
[1959.48s] that case we&#39;re in four to five value
[1961.48s] out performs you got a 2002 to 2007
[1964.399s] environment Emerging Market small caps
[1966.48s] yeeha smiling so wide we could eat
[1968.24s] banana sideways let&#39;s go over to sler
[1970.44s] thanks to my buddy Rick uh over at
[1974.84s] RB anyway let&#39;s uh take a look at
[1978.559s] slomer uh not Rick Robert slomer over at
[1983.0s] uh
[1985.0s] RBC and just to give us some broad stuff
[1987.799s] you can see the S&amp;P here has been
[1989.679s] consolidating for a while it broke out
[1992.48s] it&#39;s breaking back to retest maybe we
[1994.72s] get a full retest uh here in the month
[1997.24s] of October and then we work our way
[1999.44s] higher we will see uh here&#39;s the daily
[2002.96s] chart could push higher could retest I
[2005.72s] mean or could grind sideways for a
[2007.32s] little bit which I think is the base
[2008.76s] case here but you know this is a cup and
[2011.32s] handle for those of you technicians we
[2012.919s] don&#39;t spend a lot of time on this stuff
[2014.399s] but it&#39;s worth paying attention to what
[2015.799s] other people pay attention to so you can
[2017.399s] know what to
[2019.0s] expect equal weight breaking out
[2021.24s] silently no one&#39;s paying attention to it
[2023.08s] this is equivalent of The Magnificent
[2024.559s] 493 type of scenario NASDAQ corrected
[2028.48s] it&#39;s not yet at that uh breakout level
[2031.32s] but trying to work its way back uh
[2033.84s] midcaps broke out quietly they&#39;re
[2036.039s] getting ready to take their next leg
[2037.44s] High same with small caps everyone&#39;s
[2039.76s] saying small caps are crap except for
[2041.679s] the fact they&#39;ve been going up all year
[2043.36s] and they&#39;re ready to break out to all
[2044.679s] new time highs and he&#39;s got a 161 Target
[2048.48s] I guess Elliot wave if you do the cup
[2050.399s] and handles it&#39;s usually uh measured
[2053.48s] move so it would be 400 points above
[2056.119s] that it would be 18,00 on the 600 which
[2059.96s] means a lot of stocks are going to
[2061.119s] Triple in
[2062.079s] quadruple and same thing with the rdy
[2064.879s] everyone&#39;s saying small caps are crap
[2066.48s] except for the fact they&#39;ve been going
[2067.56s] up all year and they&#39;re going to break
[2070.28s] out so other than that how was the play
[2072.599s] Mrs Lincoln September weekly seasonality
[2076.159s] since
[2077.52s] 1946 uh shows some weekly weakness in
[2080.919s] the third week of October which is why
[2083.8s] we&#39;re not redeploying all the profits
[2086.24s] and we&#39;re just sitting with it on our
[2087.639s] hands and if we&#39;re wrong we&#39;ll still
[2089.52s] find stuff to do and if we&#39;re right we
[2091.48s] are going to have an absolute shopping
[2094.399s] spree what they used to call back in the
[2096.679s] day for those of you knew what Kmart was
[2099.96s] before a big hedge fund guy destroyed
[2102.2s] the business uh it&#39;s called a blue light
[2105.72s] special ladies and gentlemen and the
[2107.28s] blue light we think will be flashing
[2110.32s] shortly uh msci Europe same story
[2114.04s] breaking starting to move and remember I
[2116.839s] said Emerging Markets will outperform
[2118.8s] developed markets small will outperform
[2120.72s] large growth will value will outperform
[2123.88s] growth and 493 will outperform seven
[2127.359s] that&#39;s playing out Emerging Market is
[2129.2s] just getting off the mat this game is
[2130.76s] just getting started ladies and
[2132.04s] gentlemen like back in 2002 to 2007 hang
[2136.48s] saying everyone say the world is ending
[2138.72s] things straight up of course it&#39;s going
[2140.56s] to check back and test this and
[2142.56s] consolidate for a little while before
[2144.359s] the next big move uh same with uh the
[2148.359s] weekly it hit this 50% retracement
[2151.28s] Target from the crash so now maybe it
[2153.52s] goes back down to this
[2155.079s] 38.2 this is all kind of useless noise
[2157.72s] but I just give it to you guys so you
[2159.079s] have a road map so you don&#39;t freak out
[2160.839s] and sell your stuff in the Hole uh and
[2163.04s] know that it&#39;s a normal part of the
[2164.88s] basing and rally and returning
[2167.76s] confidence
[2169.44s] process uh topics is still on the mat I
[2174.04s] expect that to continue 10-year yield
[2176.72s] remember we called for the counter Trend
[2178.56s] rally well here we&#39;re getting it we may
[2180.119s] be up against resistance and we can
[2181.68s] resume the downtrend uh with the 10-year
[2184.4s] yield maybe a little higher before we
[2186.2s] roll back over dollar counter Trend move
[2189.2s] people are now saying that dollar
[2190.68s] weakness is over I think this is a
[2192.599s] counter Trend bounce maybe it goes a
[2194.119s] little higher before it resumes the
[2195.56s] downtrend and breaks out below breaks
[2197.76s] down
[2199.16s] below um so it hit this special level uh
[2203.119s] Canadian dollar people are losing
[2205.319s] confidence it&#39;s going up it&#39;s going to
[2206.92s] continue to go up as our most Emerging
[2209.319s] Market currencies in my view uh Euro
[2212.52s] same story uh got up to this breakout
[2215.56s] Point checking back we consol before it
[2218.24s] breaks out
[2219.44s] higher and so on and so forth crude
[2222.64s] traded with China more so than it trade
[2225.44s] everyone all the commentators saying it
[2227.04s] was trading with the war it&#39;s not
[2228.88s] trading with the war it&#39;s trading with
[2230.44s] China demand you can just overlay the
[2233.04s] Hang saying or whatever proxy you want
[2235.4s] to put on it and that&#39;s what you get is
[2237.76s] China demand uh gold is you know looks
[2241.56s] like it&#39;s consolidating not for me uh
[2245.119s] copper this is a China proxy uh straight
[2248.24s] up now it&#39;s consolidating to be expected
[2250.96s] you can see it again here at these
[2252.68s] magical levels that everyone&#39;s so
[2254.8s] excited about and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s
[2257.92s] anything else we need to cover from
[2260.359s] this
[2267.04s] uh yeah here&#39;s Baba on this I guess this
[2270.359s] is what Elliot wave or something like
[2272.24s] that Elliot uh what are these Fibonacci
[2275.64s] retracements so look it got up to this
[2277.96s] resistance point at
[2279.839s] 23.6 and now he thinks it&#39;s going back
[2282.359s] down to 105 or 90 if it goes back to 90
[2285.8s] it would be a gift from God we could
[2287.079s] reload the options like nobody&#39;s
[2288.72s] business out to
[2289.92s] 2027 and make another mint and
[2296.2s] um utilities rolling
[2299.44s] over uh uh crown castle will be hurt by
[2303.24s] that in the short term I&#39;m not worried
[2304.52s] about it in the long term this is a
[2305.8s] counter Trend move and yields
[2308.56s] fizer has an activist in it I like
[2312.04s] it
[2315.56s] um I&#39;m keeping an eye on it let&#39;s just
[2317.76s] put it that way I&#39;m not like I can&#39;t see
[2321.44s] the path straight away but I do like an
[2324.96s] activist but they own you know billion
[2326.52s] dollars of a160 billion dollar company
[2328.68s] like it&#39;s not totally relevant but it&#39;s
[2331.72s] something and um I think there&#39;s going
[2335.04s] to be opportunity there
[2338.68s] ilmn this is another activist Carl
[2341.28s] icon&#39;s been bagged in for you know a
[2343.359s] year and a half I think this thing
[2344.64s] starts to work
[2349.839s] also Alam Maro we own a little bit uh
[2353.4s] we&#39;ve talked about that
[2355.48s] one we&#39;ll let you know if we&#39;re going to
[2358.079s] lean into it or
[2360.079s] not um but it&#39;s
[2365.4s] moving and
[2368.68s] and that&#39;s that next here&#39;s update from
[2373.52s] today with Robert slomer at
[2379.359s] RBC counter Trend moved getting a little
[2381.88s] overbought there backed off a little bit
[2383.599s] at the end of the day on the 10-year
[2386.04s] yield uh we&#39;ll see on the S&amp;P it&#39;s
[2389.319s] feeling like it wants to be breakout but
[2391.04s] that&#39;s a fake could be a fake out let&#39;s
[2392.52s] see the inflation number on Thursday
[2394.16s] tomorrow that&#39;s going to be key and
[2399.92s] Hong Kong here&#39;s the checkback totally
[2402.56s] to be expected copper doing the exact
[2404.319s] same thing but the new uptrend is in
[2406.68s] place higher
[2408.4s] lows higher
[2410.52s] highs on to the next some news China
[2413.56s] rally still has more legs Goldman said
[2415.319s] that was three days ago before it
[2416.599s] checked back now I&#39;m sure they have a
[2418.359s] new paper out saying we&#39;re not so sure
[2420.56s] just like all of the weather veins
[2423.04s] blowing in the wind whatever it takes is
[2425.319s] on the table this is from my buddy over
[2427.76s] at crane shares brandan Ahern and you
[2431.319s] should read this article uh the
[2433.839s] government&#39;s going to stand behind it
[2435.16s] and and like terer said they they were
[2438.119s] explicit we&#39;ll do whatever it takes uh
[2441.04s] here&#39;s my favorite website at Bloomberg
[2443.079s] that always logs me out and then makes
[2445.079s] me uh give a pint of blood to prove I am
[2448.359s] who I am before they let me in and give
[2450.28s] me the nuclear codes to their articles
[2453.24s] see if they&#39;ll let me in now
[2457.599s] I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s unreal the amount of
[2459.24s] security PayPal completes its first
[2460.96s] business transaction using stablecoin I
[2463.68s] don&#39;t really know what that is but I&#39;m
[2464.92s] glad they&#39;re doing it because it seems
[2466.48s] to be the way of the future and uh we
[2468.839s] own a big stake in it so that&#39;s a good
[2470.72s] thing Boeing withdraws contract offer as
[2473.079s] union talks break down everyone says oh
[2474.92s] this is terrible let me tell you what&#39;s
[2476.88s] terrible if you&#39;re one of these
[2478.28s] machinists and you got a mortgage coming
[2480.44s] in every single month and you&#39;ve got a
[2482.92s] heating bill coming in every single
[2484.48s] month and you got to put food on the
[2485.92s] table every single month and you got to
[2488.0s] pay your car payment every single month
[2489.88s] and you&#39;re getting no income and that&#39;s
[2492.16s] basically Management&#39;s bet will give you
[2494.76s] a fair deal but if you don&#39;t want it
[2496.599s] we&#39;re going to take it off the table
[2498.2s] we&#39;re going to go raise 10 billion of
[2500.16s] capital why well because the Market&#39;s
[2502.24s] already priced it in so the market the
[2503.88s] Stock&#39;s actually going to probably rally
[2506.16s] when they actually put put on the Shelf
[2508.24s] offer because each um five billion is
[2513.16s] worth about $12 to the stock so they&#39;ll
[2516.52s] probably raise $10 billion of equity
[2518.24s] that&#39;ll be 24 stocks already down 24 my
[2521.4s] guess is it&#39;s priced in and with that
[2523.8s] credit watch thing so they&#39;ll raise 10
[2525.92s] billion they&#39;ll sit on their hands for
[2527.24s] three months and the union bosses will
[2529.64s] start to get screamed at by the wives of
[2532.24s] the workers that are on strike that
[2533.8s] can&#39;t put milk on the table and that&#39;s
[2535.359s] the bet that they&#39;re playing they&#39;ve got
[2536.68s] a fair offer on the deal maybe they&#39;ll
[2538.68s] give a little bit more but at some point
[2540.4s] they got to come to an agreement because
[2542.92s] the union workers can&#39;t go raise 10
[2545.0s] billion to sit it out for another six
[2546.599s] months but the company is likely going
[2548.68s] to in a matter of days and they&#39;ll just
[2550.72s] sit there until they bleed them out and
[2553.079s] that&#39;s not like a wish or hope or
[2556.079s] anything like that it&#39;s just the reality
[2557.559s] of how it&#39;s going to work China&#39;s
[2559.28s] property stimulus raises optimism but
[2561.119s] more steps are needed for sectoral
[2562.52s] turnaround generx CEO says the pressure
[2565.04s] on the power grid is only going to get
[2566.48s] worse from weather and Technology we
[2568.48s] took off a lot of options in the last 24
[2570.839s] hours this was buy the rumor sell the
[2573.52s] news I think um but we didn&#39;t sell a
[2576.52s] share of stock because we want to own it
[2577.96s] long term we think it&#39;s still
[2579.079s] undervalued but we made so much on the
[2580.76s] options we had to take profits sit on
[2582.559s] the cash and wait for opportunity fizer
[2585.04s] and CVS are attracting activists yes to
[2587.28s] fiser maybe to CVS I don&#39;t like it I
[2589.92s] like it anyway so we&#39;ll leave it there
[2592.4s] China markets Warren G that more
[2594.16s] stimulus is needed no kidding UPS FedEx
[2597.079s] stocks are right for buying the case for
[2599.28s] a shipping upturn I&#39;ve got my eye on
[2601.24s] those are kind of interesting and now
[2602.96s] the article of the week which I wrote 10
[2605.319s] minutes ago fake out or Breakout stock
[2607.359s] market and sentiment results so here is
[2609.4s] the chart of Alibaba we&#39;re going to get
[2612.319s] back to it in a
[2613.96s] second uh oh here are my notes
[2617.16s] for vanney uh we didn&#39;t get to cover the
[2620.319s] picks which I was going to do VF Corp
[2622.16s] and Cooper standard but we ran out of
[2624.16s] time um because the uh speaker before me
[2627.68s] was talking about how kamla Harris likes
[2630.0s] to exercise on an elliptical and watch
[2633.68s] F1 racing so there you go that does take
[2637.4s] precedence over Tom Hayes&#39;s view of
[2639.599s] Brack and Daryl I completely agree with
[2642.319s] that um General
[2644.64s] market uh I&#39;m joking and and very
[2647.48s] grateful for any time I get on uh to be
[2649.68s] honest with you so uh okay we have said
[2653.72s] to expect three key developments number
[2655.72s] one we had told you to expect a counter
[2657.68s] Trend rally in the US dollar despite the
[2659.64s] intermediate long-term trend of being
[2661.599s] down uh two uh counter Trend rally in
[2664.52s] the US Treasury 10-year yield despite
[2666.2s] the intermediate term
[2667.64s] Trend being down and we&#39;ve got that
[2669.559s] which we covered three a punishing
[2672.119s] consolidation for everyone who bought
[2673.599s] Chinese stocks in Alibaba after it
[2675.28s] rallied 50% off the lows in a matter of
[2677.079s] weeks this is healthy and will take out
[2678.92s] the late money week sisters before the
[2681.079s] next move higher I anticipate this
[2683.0s] pullback the last a couple of weeks to a
[2684.92s] couple of months once all the new money
[2686.88s] that chased up gets flushed in the hole
[2688.92s] we will power back above 120 and Beyond
[2691.4s] again if you look at the featured image
[2693.64s] of Alibaba on the top of this article
[2695.64s] you will find the current pattern is
[2697.68s] pretty normal after coming out of
[2699.68s] despondency the question is whether the
[2702.8s] current blue circle circle one several
[2705.92s] months of violent consolidation before a
[2707.92s] huge move higher or Circle two several
[2710.599s] days or weeks of moderate consolidation
[2712.559s] before a huge move higher so let me show
[2714.88s] you what I&#39;m talking about Circle one
[2716.96s] it&#39;s here are we here or are we here are
[2719.599s] we here or are we here so you got this
[2722.079s] initial thing
[2724.599s] um I&#39;m kind of of The View
[2727.92s] that we are here and here and the reason
[2731.68s] is is because we did have a violent move
[2733.8s] off the bottom and then a large
[2736.92s] consolidation um bigger than normal
[2742.68s] so I think the odds favor this I&#39;m not
[2746.079s] opposed to this or this that just gives
[2749.319s] us more opportunity to get some more
[2752.079s] exposure but uh now that we got a lot of
[2755.68s] cash uh
[2758.0s] but I think we&#39;re more like here and
[2759.48s] we&#39;re probably going to keep pounding
[2760.92s] higher over time and that&#39;s going to be
[2764.64s] great and this would also be more
[2766.72s] consistent with a view that once we get
[2770.44s] through you know once this thing starts
[2772.72s] going they&#39;re not going to let anyone in
[2774.44s] and as you can see in the last four
[2775.599s] weeks they didn&#39;t let anyone in you know
[2777.24s] no one was buying until it was already
[2778.76s] 115 117 they missed the whole move and
[2782.319s] that&#39;s why they&#39;re going to get uh
[2784.119s] they&#39;re getting punched in the throat
[2785.44s] now get rid of those late shares give
[2787.319s] them back to strong hands and then we&#39;ll
[2789.359s] go
[2796.48s] higher next
[2802.839s] is so we favor the ladder but our
[2805.319s] open-minded as the intrinsic value is
[2807.0s] still dramatically higher than the
[2808.44s] current price we would love a chance to
[2809.8s] reload long-dated options would have to
[2812.24s] temporarily drop below $100 a share for
[2814.119s] me to execute on that for another 5x
[2816.559s] Plus bagger depending on the Vintage but
[2818.76s] we are content just owning all the stock
[2821.64s] for the long term we have not sold one
[2824.079s] share and we own a ton uh and aggregate
[2829.24s] much lower much much lower levels uh so
[2832.72s] where is Alibaba on the Justin Mammoth
[2835.24s] emotional cycle that we&#39;ve covered
[2837.2s] several times over the last five years
[2838.92s] you tell me and don&#39;t quote unquote deny
[2842.2s] it so our case is that we&#39;re not here
[2845.88s] we&#39;re more likely
[2847.48s] here in which case after a little bit of
[2850.0s] consolidation after that first violent
[2852.04s] move up we are going to make another
[2855.4s] violent moving up and just here is when
[2857.76s] we&#39;re going to start to see those
[2858.8s] headlines turn to China is going to be
[2861.599s] the largest country in the world blah
[2863.04s] blah blah uh overtake the US they&#39;re not
[2865.64s] by the way they&#39;re going to take a run
[2866.88s] at it the next three to five years and
[2868.24s] then they&#39;re going to be toast because
[2869.48s] the one Child Left Behind and we&#39;re
[2871.4s] going to ride this parabolic move and uh
[2874.119s] sell to those excited people who were
[2876.88s] the most negative at the bottom Cooper
[2879.16s] standard I love well I don&#39;t love this
[2882.599s] but I&#39;m going to go through some
[2883.839s] information here uh I love the company I
[2886.68s] love the stock I don&#39;t love why they
[2889.52s] might have a short-term Catalyst uh one
[2893.0s] podcast video cast recent podcast I
[2895.48s] mentioned that I estimated $3 a share in
[2898.4s] earnings per share for every 200,000
[2900.48s] cars of produ us production above 15.7
[2904.52s] million annual SAR
[2907.28s] uh you should click here if you don&#39;t
[2908.64s] know Cooper standard we started our
[2910.64s] position in the low $5 range in May
[2914.16s] 2022 in size and we&#39;ve added over time
[2917.64s] it&#39;s cheap as hell even here in our view
[2920.44s] and um so go read the thesis and see the
[2924.28s] progression over the years uh hurricane
[2926.599s] Milton is a tragedy it will leave
[2928.559s] Devastation in its path destroying homes
[2931.04s] schools hospitals and more by the way
[2933.52s] hat tip to my buddy Jackson You Know Who
[2936.4s] You Are
[2937.44s] uh it will also destroy a lot of cars
[2939.88s] that will be total losses and replaced
[2942.24s] with new ones by insurance companies and
[2944.16s] owners one of the points we have
[2945.72s] emphasized repeatedly is that in 2017
[2949.16s] when Cooper standard earned $719 a share
[2952.68s] and traded at $146 per share the US had
[2956.96s] 17.1 million SAR uh which versus now you
[2961.04s] know 15 and change what I did not
[2963.52s] realize is that is that was the same
[2967.119s] year that hurricane Irma and hurricane
[2970.16s] Harvey hit the US hard and took 630,000
[2974.799s] cars with it that needed to be replaced
[2977.799s] and helped with the peak SAR number so
[2981.16s] that probably
[2982.359s] contributed uh you know maybe the Run
[2984.64s] rate the peak run rate then was 165 and
[2987.76s] they got 637 cars uh that took it to 171
[2992.319s] you know maybe we&#39;re at 157 you get 500
[2994.599s] 600,000 cars you&#39;re at 165
[2997.2s] you&#39;re adding
[2999.96s] 800,000 cars which at $3 per 200,000
[3005.04s] above
[3007.72s] 15.7 uh you know you&#39;re looking at
[3011.44s] uh they&#39;ll screw it up so you&#39;re looking
[3014.16s] at $12 a share so even if they screw it
[3016.64s] up and wind up with $8 a share you you
[3019.92s] tell me the multiple is it going to be a
[3021.28s] trough multiple of 10 times or a peak
[3022.96s] multiple that they had of 20 times if
[3025.64s] Milton is anything like these two
[3027.28s] devastating hurricanes in
[3029.319s] 2017 there will be another half million
[3031.839s] cars required than estimated over the
[3034.359s] next six months using the rough
[3035.64s] operating leverage formula I&#39;ve
[3036.839s] calculated and the impact on EPS for CPS
[3039.04s] is possible we could hit our earnings
[3040.88s] Target much sooner than anticipated and
[3043.44s] the implications would be massive time
[3046.76s] will tell if Milton is not as Extreme as
[3048.96s] anticipated the previous timeline is
[3051.04s] still in play if mil Milton reeks
[3053.24s] unexpected Havoc our timeline could be
[3055.76s] quickly exceled accelerated onto the
[3058.599s] general view greed is at 72 so getting
[3061.2s] closer to extreme on the fear and greed
[3064.0s] although the National Association of
[3065.52s] active investment managers still at 86.6
[3068.119s] four which is not quite extreme so we&#39;re
[3070.28s] kind of in this grind sideways

[3114.28s] Healthcare top 30 weights revisions in
[3116.72s] the last 60 days revised up for 2025 by
[3121.0s] 0.58% so that&#39;s good same with
[3123.559s] financials R revised up uh 21 basis
[3127.839s] points in the last 60 days top 30
[3130.0s] weights for
[3131.76s] 2025 earnings revised down like I said
[3134.599s] from 277 to 276 still going to have 14%
[3138.599s] growth uh we&#39;ll see if they take them
[3141.16s] back up they&#39;ve set the bar low for Q3
[3143.68s] and GDP now is actually climbing from
[3146.52s] 2.5 to 3.1 in the last uh week so um so
[3152.72s] we should see uh that be helpful all
[3155.599s] right uh as far as economic data the big
[3157.92s] one is CPI tomorrow uh nothing else
[3160.76s] really glaring here other than
[3163.599s] that and PPI on Friday so the podcast is
[3167.68s] done we&#39;re gonna move on to the ask me
[3171.119s] anything questions we&#39;ve got quite a few
[3173.52s] this week so let&#39;s kick it off now Now
[3179.04s] with uh will
[3182.88s] kuharski you said in the
[3186.04s] past uh if Nvidia keeps up with this
[3188.559s] mega growth would become oneir of US
[3191.72s] GDP if this is true at what point is the
[3194.0s] shiny object no longer popular Taxi
[3195.64s] Driver story and can no longer sustain
[3197.24s] its market cap is it even possible to be
[3199.68s] a double from here 3.2 trillion to 6.4
[3202.64s] trillion if not what&#39;s the reason to
[3203.96s] hold it besides the popular name when
[3206.04s] you can get Returns on many stocks you
[3207.599s] mentioned down 50 to 60% uh for me I see
[3210.319s] no reason on it so uh I&#39;ll leave it at
[3212.52s] that but um you know when you have the
[3215.599s] CEO telling you that demand is quote
[3217.72s] unquote insane and he&#39;s dumping a
[3220.24s] billion dollars a stock at the same time
[3222.28s] you know I I I watch what people do not
[3224.52s] what they say so um we&#39;ll leave it at
[3227.24s] that on to the next Drew burn what are
[3230.599s] your thoughts on andava at the current
[3233.2s] valuation is not a made a position of
[3234.839s] mine added some recently we&#39;ve covered
[3236.72s] this before it&#39;s like a UK software
[3240.52s] company it&#39;s cheap but you really have
[3242.68s] to know the industry I think you could
[3244.88s] take it for a trade uh and be okay on to
[3248.72s] the next one I don&#39;t I like the business
[3252.04s] but again what&#39;s the mo what what is the
[3255.079s] Moe how you have to have absolute to
[3257.559s] make it a big position you have to have
[3259.72s] absolute confidence that they have a
[3261.92s] software mode in a growing area that no
[3264.44s] one can breach it and it&#39;s not Trading
[3266.52s] like it has that so um you know this is
[3269.28s] not about generators that have 70% of
[3271.599s] the market you can sleep at night this
[3273.68s] is like someone could come in and put
[3275.04s] them out of business overnight which is
[3276.599s] why Buffett never did
[3278.559s] technology um so let&#39;s move on to that
[3285.079s] but on balance you&#39;re probably probably
[3288.88s] okay all right um moving on to the next
[3292.799s] one Tim thoughts on ticker C
[3298.4s] NC
[3304.839s] cnxc
[3318.96s] um casts declining revenues are okay
[3322.319s] margins are can&#39;t see
[3336.76s] huh technology infused customer
[3340.119s] experience solutions that sounds like a
[3342.559s] whole lot of I gotta be honest
[3344.119s] with you technology infused customer
[3347.24s] experience I mean it sells sounds sells
[3349.64s] like aroma therapy I mean like what do
[3352.2s] you company CX process optimization Tech
[3356.28s] techology Innovation front and back
[3357.599s] office automation analytics it sounds
[3359.799s] like a me2 company let&#39;s see if they&#39;re
[3361.44s] generating some cash uh you&#39;re there&#39;s
[3364.359s] no way you&#39;re going to have ever have
[3365.799s] full confidence that they have any type
[3367.44s] of moat and they can&#39;t be put out of
[3369.0s] business tomorrow but as a trade is a
[3371.559s] different story so uh low return on
[3376.64s] Capital uh let&#39;s see cash flow it&#39;s
[3380.28s] probably okay for
[3383.2s] now uh
[3388.92s] uh yeah cash flow is okay for now the
[3392.72s] balance sheet look like probably okay
[3398.76s] 2645 billion of debt on a tech company
[3401.799s] and on a tech infused customer
[3405.2s] experience company my goodness uh I&#39;m
[3408.16s] gonna say pass moving
[3410.92s] along
[3413.799s] um elf
[3416.96s] no one wanted it at 15 now everyone
[3419.4s] wants it at what 150 let&#39;s
[3424.24s] see yeah so you&#39;re stuck in recency
[3427.48s] biased you&#39;re like wow it was 221 now
[3429.799s] it&#39;s only 100 bucks I mean it was $6
[3432.88s] three years ago I think this is me too
[3436.319s] uh for me I&#39;m going to pass this looks
[3438.48s] like a broken momentum stock and I&#39;m
[3440.64s] just going to leave it at that maybe it
[3442.28s] works for a trade but I think it&#39;s way
[3444.76s] too early to get involved in that
[3447.16s] uh favorite books that you&#39;ve read I
[3448.48s] talk about it all the time Dominic
[3450.44s] Harlin
[3452.92s] um number one you need to go to
[3455.079s] berkshire.com read every single annual
[3457.359s] letter that Buffett&#39;s ever written
[3459.079s] number two the intelligent investor by
[3460.88s] Ben Graham number three security
[3462.88s] analysis also by Ben Graham
[3468.119s] um those are the key and then read a lot
[3471.16s] of annual reports I I like Source
[3473.2s] material I don&#39;t like secondhand
[3475.0s] material uh uh okay let&#39;s see
[3484.4s] here uh venod asked about Apache I&#39;m not
[3487.68s] interested we&#39;ve looked at that in
[3488.92s] recent weeks uh probably good for a
[3492.0s] bounce I I just don&#39;t like it I like
[3493.559s] Comstock
[3495.0s] resources and I own Comstock resources
[3497.72s] Patrick McKenzie micro
[3501.0s] strategy uh not for me pass wrong
[3504.72s] podcast
[3507.72s] um Richard McCrae huge fan since mid
[3511.76s] 2022 thank you a longtime listener first
[3514.119s] time caller uh thanks for sharing your
[3516.319s] knowledge and experience I followed your
[3517.4s] TLT trade some months back with positive
[3519.44s] results uh yeah so we we told you when
[3522.44s] we took that
[3523.68s] off
[3528.799s] um price of TLT are you considering
[3532.24s] buying TLT calls again around the
[3533.76s] current price uh no because it was way
[3537.88s] more asymmetric I think you could grind
[3540.079s] for a while here and that&#39;s how you get
[3541.559s] hurt buying premium so
[3548.839s] um yeah I see what yeah I know what
[3551.319s] you&#39;re talking about here uh it&#39;s just
[3553.96s] not as asymmetric as it was I mean when
[3556.48s] we were buying it it&#39;s like it&#39;s a
[3560.72s] completely different story this is going
[3562.48s] to work higher and higher over the next
[3565.039s] few years
[3570.4s] uh I mean we just had a big we had a win
[3573.119s] on that so I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m going
[3575.28s] to get back in or if I&#39;ll ever get back
[3577.0s] in I think there&#39;s other derivative ways
[3578.68s] I want to play it I think utilities are
[3580.64s] going to uh get hurt a little bit more
[3582.72s] which tells me yields will probably go
[3584.039s] up a little bit more so I&#39;m going to
[3586.319s] just table that for now Richard but I
[3589.2s] you&#39;re thinking process is correct I
[3592.24s] just don&#39;t it&#39;s not a fat enough pitch
[3594.52s] like it was when we got involved
[3596.96s] uh Vincent
[3600.079s] sentore hey Tom happy to see
[3602.0s] everything&#39;s been going great for you
[3603.119s] I&#39;m curious on your thoughts around
[3604.64s] Wendy&#39;s strong fundamentals standout
[3607.359s] training below fiveyear average PE and a
[3609.839s] dividend I don&#39;t know this is a me too
[3613.28s] uh you know we got another I do want to
[3614.76s] get involved in restaurants and consumer
[3616.319s] discretionary this is not the one I I
[3619.76s] just I don&#39;t know I looked at this a
[3622.96s] while back I don&#39;t really love it I&#39;ll
[3625.359s] tell you I I&#39;d rather play around with
[3628.079s] something that&#39;s just tanked like Jack
[3630.16s] in the
[3631.359s] Box which another user asked about I&#39;m
[3634.72s] not ready for Wendy&#39;s I mean if if
[3636.319s] Nelson pelts couldn&#39;t really turn it
[3637.799s] around I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot
[3640.119s] there um and I think I went to
[3642.96s] one I wasn&#39;t really happy with it I
[3645.28s] don&#39;t know or every time I think about
[3646.72s] going to one I&#39;m like I don&#39;t really
[3647.96s] want to go there and then I just keep
[3649.599s] driving so I whatever it&#39;s just not for
[3651.88s] me Jim Jones if a equity jumps extremely
[3657.4s] in a short amount of time but not your
[3659.24s] price Target what&#39;s your
[3660.799s] process uh well my process is we will
[3663.2s] take profits on the options because
[3665.48s] they&#39;ll be up you know if it&#39;s straight
[3667.319s] premium they&#39;ll be up 3 4X if it spreads
[3670.72s] it&#39;ll be up 4 to
[3672.24s] 7x uh so we do take profits but we
[3674.68s] generally don&#39;t sell any underlying
[3677.4s] stock uh until it hits our full price
[3683.039s] Target Michael
[3688.0s] Michael oer regular listener your
[3691.039s] fantastic analysis could you please
[3692.28s] share your thoughts on
[3693.92s] sqm uh yeah this is Chile I do want to
[3697.079s] get some exposure in Latin America that
[3699.2s] fertilizers potassium nitrate chemicals
[3701.4s] blah blah blah uh largest exports are to
[3704.68s] China well that&#39;s why I don&#39;t play that
[3707.4s] because I have enough exposure to China
[3709.0s] with um and that&#39;s what you have to be
[3711.039s] careful of when you look at your
[3712.279s] portfolio I&#39;m looking for relatively
[3714.48s] uncorrelated bets
[3716.4s] uh I think this is going to work just
[3718.0s] like Bob is going to work um because
[3720.279s] it&#39;s going to be a China Play Just Like
[3721.72s] goose is going to work just like VF
[3723.2s] corp&#39;s going to work so the last thing I
[3724.64s] need is one more but would I consider
[3727.4s] this one for a fresh one ABS I think I
[3730.68s] absolutely let me look at the financials
[3732.359s] here negative free cash flow declining
[3735.599s] this
[3737.599s] um huh they&#39;re kind of in hard shape
[3740.079s] here margins declining cash flow
[3741.64s] declining revenues declining price price
[3744.24s] is probably priced in a lot of it but um
[3747.839s] not in love let&#39;s take a look at the
[3749.799s] balance
[3751.92s] sheet I&#39;m going to tell you right now I
[3754.039s] think there are easier ways to make
[3760.4s] money two billion of debt the balance
[3763.4s] sheet seems
[3771.24s] okay I think you&#39;ll probably do okay
[3774.48s] with this it&#39;s probably going to take
[3775.96s] longer to build a base than you think
[3777.48s] it&#39;s not going to go straight up uh I
[3780.24s] think it&#39;s a pretty good find I think
[3782.24s] it&#39;s time to start to look in Latin
[3783.799s] America and South America so I like the
[3788.039s] thinking here I&#39;m not ready for it but I
[3791.119s] think you&#39;ll do
[3796.4s] fine
[3799.359s] uh mentioned closing out 3M in the mid
[3804.359s] 1220s uh from the low of
[3807.0s] 73 yeah but you also got SV ventum
[3809.599s] number one and you and we also made a
[3811.68s] ton on our options so and we wanted to
[3815.079s] book a win because we you know the thing
[3818.2s] about the advantage that an individual
[3821.119s] has over a PM is
[3826.279s] that you know as a PM you have to book
[3828.839s] wins because you have to deliver return
[3830.64s] so you can&#39;t just ride everything up and
[3832.799s] down all the time so when something gets
[3834.319s] close enough to your targeted value
[3836.48s] and you feel like the Market&#39;s a little
[3837.839s] bit overdone at the time you book The
[3840.0s] Profit you know and you don&#39;t be a pig
[3841.72s] and you leave the last few percent to
[3843.079s] someone else uh but on that
[3846.559s] one uh if you look at what our options
[3849.039s] did on top of it and the total return
[3851.52s] with the spin shares and everything else
[3854.079s] uh we&#39;re perfectly comfortable with that
[3855.76s] if it backed down to like a 100 again
[3857.76s] would we re relook at it and see what
[3859.599s] the business looks like now you bet we
[3861.359s] would um we just thought that you know
[3865.319s] with the vast majority of their
[3867.48s] litigation risk in the rearview mirror
[3869.2s] we got paid for that but there&#39;s there&#39;s
[3871.88s] still some tail of risk on that and then
[3874.319s] they&#39;ve got to turn the business around
[3875.559s] which they seem to be doing it will be
[3877.44s] fine but um we would need to get it at
[3880.359s] lower prices to get interested in again
[3883.039s] uh this is Jan asking me about Walgreens
[3885.68s] boots again every week someone ask me
[3887.559s] and every week I say no have at it it&#39;s
[3890.0s] going to be it&#39;ll work as a trade but I
[3892.039s] don&#39;t want to own that business long
[3893.44s] term until I can walk into a Walgreen
[3896.039s] and not have to page
[3897.839s] someu vaping in the corner to take 10
[3900.92s] minutes to come over and get me Gillette
[3903.16s] razor blades I&#39;m not interested on to
[3905.64s] the next next time I&#39;ll tell you how I
[3907.559s] really feel Lan Neo uh what are your
[3910.799s] thoughts on
[3911.799s] Aliant Al
[3919.279s] NT uh what is this thing I think it&#39;s
[3936.68s] sells precision and specially controlled
[3938.88s] motion components and systems various
[3941.24s] Industries brushless DC motors torque
[3946.44s] Motors uh gearing drives motion
[3949.27s] [Music]
[3950.52s] rollers
[3953.64s] huh Aliant
[3975.079s] this is a tiny company I
[3978.559s] mean uh that&#39;s not really the kind of
[3981.799s] stuff we do unless it&#39;s called Cooper
[3984.599s] standard
[3986.64s] uh let&#39;s just see
[3995.2s] here
[4005.599s] huh not a great business it just doesn&#39;t
[4008.76s] generally uh return investor generate a
[4012.599s] return on investor Capital but uh uh it
[4016.24s] is generating free cash how&#39;s the
[4018.44s] balance
[4022.2s] sheet $30 million debt relative to $30
[4027.319s] million of
[4029.599s] uh
[4031.96s] cash
[4040.119s] uh not a good enough business for me to
[4042.48s] get interested but I think it might work
[4044.48s] for you
[4046.52s] um good work Samar do you agree that
[4049.68s] Lisa should be classified as dead or not
[4052.839s] generally no uh but I&#39;m not losing sleep
[4056.119s] over the fact they made the change and
[4058.119s] uh you got to play the hand you&#39;re dealt
[4059.559s] not the not the hand you want David
[4071.2s] Ola he&#39;s asking about uh
[4075.96s] the repurchase program that they have
[4077.92s] and the cash that they have
[4081.0s] um number one your numbers are not
[4084.839s] correct um so read that
[4088.44s] carefully
[4089.57s] [Music]
[4090.72s] um but they&#39;re not going to be buying
[4092.559s] back stock yet they sold off the other
[4094.4s] business to deleverage now they&#39;re going
[4096.64s] to get it efficient that these two
[4099.4s] quarters are weak uh which they said
[4101.96s] would be weak and uh they&#39;ll get the um
[4106.56s] Hub and spoke model in plays for this
[4108.48s] distribution center and then they&#39;re
[4109.6s] going to start to expand 100 stories a
[4111.159s] year it&#39;s going to be great and if you
[4113.239s] ask anyone who knows anything about
[4114.64s] Shane o Kelly and what he did at HD
[4117.159s] Supply it&#39;s just to sit on your hands
[4118.88s] and wait and he&#39;s going to work his
[4120.159s] magic just like Brack and darl uh just
[4123.319s] like um Alex Chris over at PayPal uh
[4127.52s] these are all winners uh we bet on these
[4129.799s] jockeys and uh this time this one will
[4132.159s] be no
[4133.359s] different uh
[4136.12s] is your market cap Target for Baba a
[4138.08s] trillion dollars $800 price no never
[4141.48s] said that never even alluded to that so
[4145.96s] uh this must have come in yeah this came
[4147.52s] in last week when the stock was at 120
[4151.04s] uh Landon H been tracking Jack as a
[4153.56s] potential to buy due to significant
[4155.799s] opportunities for cost cut D growth
[4159.44s] opportuni for both Jack and Del Taco
[4161.08s] what are your thoughts on this idea I
[4162.64s] generally like it and I&#39;m generally
[4164.799s] interested
[4166.359s] and I&#39;ve not done anything
[4168.96s] yet because I wait for fat pitches but
[4171.4s] this is getting closer and closer to a
[4173.0s] fat pitch for
[4174.199s] me um but we&#39;re not there yet uh thing I
[4178.48s] find when I go to California all the
[4180.0s] time is that like I walk into there and
[4182.44s] they just have so many options that&#39;s
[4184.279s] the that&#39;s kind of like I don&#39;t love
[4186.359s] that and I don&#39;t like this negative free
[4187.92s] cash flow either this is kind of not
[4192.96s] ideal seems like a confused menu
[4195.6s] revenues are starting to pick up margins
[4197.28s] are going down I think they&#39;re just
[4198.88s] trying to throw a lot of stuff at the
[4200.48s] wall they&#39;ll have to clean up that menu
[4203.199s] and uh normalize it but fact of the
[4205.8s] matter is everything there&#39;s pretty
[4208.719s] pretty good I mean if you&#39;re not looking
[4210.48s] to uh take a blood test the next day for
[4212.92s] your physical uh it&#39;s not the end of the
[4215.32s] world so I think eventually they&#39;ll get
[4217.36s] it right I think it might be a little
[4219.4s] early uh that&#39;s new
[4222.4s] client and txt
[4232.679s] I&#39;d rather write
[4234.6s] Boeing H you know Boeing can drag on and
[4237.4s] go down another 20 bucks but at the end
[4239.08s] of the day it&#39;s going to be 250 260 in a
[4241.12s] year year and a half and probably over
[4242.8s] 300 shortly thereafter so I&#39;m not really
[4245.6s] worried about it txt has run a lot I&#39;m
[4249.719s] sure it&#39;s uh got good numbers
[4253.76s] here cash flows going down stock price
[4256.28s] has been going up revenues have been
[4257.679s] recovering margins are kind of bumpy I I
[4260.64s] don&#39;t like it as much I think this I
[4262.44s] mean you know this thing&#39;s up 5x in the
[4264.4s] last few years why are you interested
[4266.04s] now uh wrong podcast but probably a good
[4269.84s] company and I don&#39;t think you get
[4271.44s] tremendously hurt doing it I just think
[4273.28s] there are higher and better uses for
[4274.64s] your money right now with that said
[4277.679s] we&#39;ll be back next time uh by the way
[4280.239s] anyone going to be in Scottdale or
[4281.96s] Phoenix uh newer potential clients in
[4285.0s] the next three days from Friday through
[4287.719s] Sunday want to grab a quick coffee
[4289.52s] probably won&#39;t be able to do a meal
[4290.84s] because I&#39;m there to hang with my kids
[4292.4s] and my wife uh love to do that just
[4295.56s] reach out through hedge fund tips.com
[4297.719s] we&#39;ll be back next
