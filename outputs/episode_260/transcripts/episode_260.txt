business Green Room for vanney today that&#39;s with Mike Lee my buddy he actually grew up in the town that we live in in Connecticut and that&#39;s Preston miselle one of The Producers for Varney and Co today two of the best guys out there it was blast catching up with them in the green room and also with Mark terer who I didn&#39;t have a chance to uh to get a picture with uh speaking of media uh want to thank Preston misel and of course Christian D and steuart vanney for having me on the show today we&#39;re going to listen in here uh let&#39;s get back to the markets the biggest gainers on the Dow accounting for some of this 164 Point gain are Goldman United Health and caterpillar they&#39;re all up sharply Dow&#39;s up 158 points uh Tom Tom Hayes joins me now uh you watch the market for us okay we&#39;ve got the CPI tomorrow Consumer Price Index is expected to go up 2.3% year-over-year 2.3% inflation if it does that does the market rally I think it&#39;s good for the market I the thing that I&#39;ve learned over the years to is the secret to happiness in life is low expectations so we&#39;ve got a low inflation number at 2.3% which is uh inconsistent with what is expected of the FED in November an 87% chance of a 25 basis point cut a 78% chance of a 25 basis cut in December so so long as that number&#39;s in the neighborhood of 2.3% they&#39;re going to follow through with those cuts that adds liquidity to the market and I think maybe a few bumps in October but I think going into year end we&#39;re going to be just fine and the fed&#39;s going to follow through with those cuts so the market rallies the market will go up on balance before the end of the year does it rally the next minute perhaps uh the key is liquidity is coming from everywhere around the world we&#39;ve had the most amount of Central Bank Cuts happen since 2020 and 20 uh 2009 those were times to be buyers of equities not sellers make a big distinction between the Magnificent Seven which have almost stalled not quite stalled but they&#39;re not making the big gains that they were versus the other 493 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that&#39;s where you want to put the money right that&#39;s right you don&#39;t want to swim against the tide here we started the year the Magnificent 7 had 50% earnings growth they&#39;re down to the mid teens earnings growth whereas the unmagnify they had negative earnings growth until the most recent quarter they&#39;ve just started to inflect positive and as that trend continues they&#39;re going to be at Mid teens earnings growth over the next couple of quarters that&#39;s where all the money is going to be made to there are still stocks down 50% 60% 70% that are great companies that are going to be doubles over the next 2 three years all right Tom Hayes we understand thanks so much for joining us comes here again soon Ashley and we&#39;re back and then wanted to thank Maryanne star in and for having me on on CNA news Asia which is like the BBC of Singapore last night listening here now let&#39;s bring in Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member from great Hill capital good evening to you Thomas so basically at the moment we are looking at uh you know more volatilities in the market since the start of October so looking ahead what kind of you know downside risks that investors should be should be watching out for well thanks for having me Henry I think that it&#39;s simply that time of year uh if you look at the presidential cycle the fourth year during an election year tends to be a more choppy season we&#39;re trading at 21 times forward earnings the market is pretty fully valued and we&#39;re starting earnings season uh this Friday with the big Banks JP Morgan City Bank are going to report earnings earnings are expected to be a little bit lower because of light Lo loan demand and decreasing net interest margin so I think you could see some choppiness and some uncertainty into the election we have raised some profits raised a little bit of cash to be able to buy in if we get any weakness before the election and I think once the election clears Henry uh after early November I think you&#39;re going to see a year-end rally there&#39;s a lot of pent up demand a lot of managers behind their index that will have to chase into year end and we&#39;re also closely watching us inflation number coming out later this week um in the situation that fed is less aggressive in its rate cut plan uh so how do you think investors should prepare for that kind of situation well headline inflation is projected to come in lower than last month uh 2.5 last month expectations are for just 2.3 this month which is uh very subdued inflation which would actually put a uh a a clear indication that we could see 25 more basis points of cuts in November and 25 more basis Cuts in December so a total of 50 more basis points Cuts provided that number comes in as weak as anticipated headline inflation on Thursday so we&#39;ve got the inflation numbers on Thursday that are going to be critical as as it determines what the FED is going to do in November and December and we have earnings the key thing about earnings is expectations for Q3 earnings growth uh as of June 30th we&#39;re 7.8% analysts have brought down expectations to just 4.2% so they&#39;ve lowered the bar and uh a saying I always like to say Henry is the secret to happiness is low expectations and they&#39;ve set the bar low for Q3 so we may see some positive earning surprises as the weeks we on uh which should should bode well for the end of year performance after the election clears M and we are seeing some rotation happening especially in Tech sector as well as small cap stocks uh what&#39;s your take on those yes yeah I think what you see historically after the first fed cut and today was a one-off certainly teched well they&#39;ve been beat down the last couple of months so they&#39;re GNA they&#39;re going to see a bounce but I think if you look past a few days or a few weeks after the first cut in the easing cycle begins what we&#39;re seeing is a broadening of participation in the market so the tech center magnificent 7 have been underperforming uh in recent weeks and the UNM magnificent 493 I like to call them the rest of the S&amp;P 500 have been outperforming you&#39;ll see it in fits and starts but on balance for the next 12 to 18 months we believe that theme is going to persist which does mean small caps will start to outperform large caps that&#39;s historically true in the first 12 months following a Fed cut uh by 11% small caps outperform value stocks outperform growth stocks in the first six months after the first fed cut and Emerging Markets will start to outperform developed markets for their first time in basically a decade and that&#39;s due to number one uh a continued trend of a weakening dollar and the Chinese government although they didn&#39;t give the market what they wanted today after a 50% rally we gave in a handful of weeks we gave a little bit back today and probably will for the next couple of weeks uh consolidate those gains uh they&#39;ll be back in the market their initial indication was they were going to do what it was What It Takes and I don&#39;t believe they want to uh give up the gains that they&#39;ve already seen and get their country back to that 5% Target that they set all right Thomas thank you for your analysis Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member with great Hill capital and we&#39;re back and then quotes of the week and there&#39;s so many quotes of the week because they were all perfect so our new guy Jeff is just doing a good job of picking these or he&#39;s just getting lucky with the timing but I think he&#39;s doing a great job this is Ray Delio the biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist I&#39;ve talked about that a lot on the podcast it&#39;s called recency bias and we&#39;re gonna actually spend some time on it today as it relates to China Seth claran the single greatest Edge an investor can have is long-term orientation I call it time Arbitrage when your framework is right you get paid for sitting on your hands entrepreneurs get rich through Massive Action great investors get rich through massive inaction and very few people can do it uh when things you do things oh by the way key announcement for brand for existing and new clients I sent you an email tonight with two very important points I can tell you right now you are going to be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways and uh the first point you&#39;re GNA love and the second point you are the first ones to have access to this and we&#39;ll keep it that way for some time before we roll it out so do check your email if you didn&#39;t get an email entitled important uh uh reach out to me but uh but it&#39;s going to be a a good good read for you uh here&#39;s Buffett you do things when the opportunities come along I&#39;ve had periods in my life when I&#39;ve had a bundle of ideas come along and I&#39;ve had long dry spells if I get an idea next week I&#39;ll do something if not I won&#39;t do a damn thing and that&#39;s very interesting because we&#39;ve had a lot of money coming in the last week and I I&#39;ve actually purposefully and for those of you who are existing clients you know we&#39;ve taken profits on a lot of options that we&#39;ve made a lot of money on and uh but we&#39;ve kept all the stock and [Music] um uh so the first thing that I said to all the new money that came in is don&#39;t be surprised if we&#39;re sitting on cash for a few weeks uh into the election we want to be in a position to take advantage of any dislocation or seasonal or pre-election Jitters if they come along if they don&#39;t come along there&#39;s always stuff to do and we&#39;ve been able to put work to money to work but if you are thinking about coming in or adding money a lot of people have been adding money to their accounts um Now&#39;s the Time to do it even if it sits and collects interest at interactive brokers for two or three weeks until I can pounce it&#39;s one name we&#39;re already going to start pouncing on but um uh go ahead and do that and you don&#39;t want to try to get money in when it&#39;s middle of the the opportunity cycle you want the money sitting there ready to go and uh and ready to pounce and that&#39;s what Buffett&#39;s talk talking about so you know um that&#39;s how you balance it so uh great quote there and then Robert AR not successful contrarian investment requires us to live with discomfort for being wrong and alone uh but Bargains do not exist in the absence of fear we&#39;ve seen that with Alibaba uh you know we&#39;ve been through the hellscape and now uh we&#39;re getting into the sunshine and here is a key lesson uh what most people do is they forget why they got into the business and the minute they start making a lot of profits they are so quick to want to sell the profits and book a win or get back to even and get out that is a cognitive bias that is so disconnected from what is the value of the underlying business today based on its earnings power cash flow and what do we expect uh relative to tomorrow and and the fact of the matter is it&#39;s been derated due to despondency and pessimism uh which is going to eventually turn into Euphoria and uh greed and we&#39;re nowhere near that point yet uh so don&#39;t make the Fatal mistake that people do when a position takes longer than expected and uh they get stuck in what&#39;s happened in the recent past will persist I.E things have been terrible in China therefore things are going to stay terrible in China it&#39;s usually just the opposite all intelligent investing is value investing acquiring more than you are paying for you must value the business in order to Value the stock Charlie Munger by the way Charlie Munger had a huge position in uh Alibaba and uh inside of the daily The Daily Journal or was it West CO it was the it was the newspaper company that he had anyway I forget what the name of it was it&#39;s late it&#39;s been a long day but uh I got to get this done because I&#39;m headed out to Arizona to see the water polo tournament this weekend super excited to watch uh rocktober in Scottdale not bringing my golf clubs going to spend all the time with them uh and back on Monday so um so you must value the business in order to value stock uh and this is what we try to teach every single week here and finally Benjamin Graham most of the time Common Stocks are subject to irrational excess excessive price fluctuations in both directions as the consequence of the ingrain tendency of most people to speculate or gamble to give way to Hope fear and greed and we try to take advantage of that and benefit from that uh let&#39;s go into our data for the week this is a critical important lesson ladies and gentlemen uh there is an author at or writer at Barons that we&#39;ve talked about in the past and this person is chronically pessimistic uh without fail about China and I want you to see how opinion follows Trend as evidenced by by this writer&#39;s headlines over the last three two two about a year and a half two years um so here is two days ago uh when uh the market gave back a few points after you know 50% rally in a few weeks China&#39;s stock surge could fizzle soon here&#39;s what to look for then here is what happened when the market was up 50% in a few weeks same same author Beijing has started a new bull market Market here&#39;s what stocks to own so when it goes up 50% in 4 weeks the headline is Beijing has started a new bull market here&#39;s what stocks to own uh just a few days later when the market corrects a little bit China&#39;s stock surge could fizzle soon here&#39;s what to look for same person same view uh different view um uh largest weekly inflow ever to China Equity Funds which is why we told you last week they will punish this late money you know I&#39;m I&#39;m always looking at Bob you can look at K web whatever that came in around 120 they&#39;ll smoke them out they&#39;ll they&#39;ll puke it in the hole whether that&#39;s 105 I think 98 95 gets them out of their stock that that they bought at 115 uh and then we rip higher if we get to the high 90s I&#39;m going to put the options back on that we took off 5 six 7x depending on when the account was started and and the and the opportunities that were available at the time um that was just huge for us and that&#39;s why we&#39;re sitting on so much cash from the from the option profits and we&#39;re going to just be patient to deploy it uh outside of that one name we&#39;re going to pounce on stock turnover surges on Hong Kong Aid rally so that&#39;s that now I I just want to go through these headlines to make a point how these type of headlines take you out of Quality Companies when you don&#39;t know what you own and when you do know what you own you still have to have ice in your veins and internal fortitude um to sit through because it&#39;s it&#39;s relentless here fomo and China stock rally think twice about buying that&#39;s up after it was up 30 40% China&#39;s stimulus may keep from spoiling global economy but it still isn&#39;t enough China&#39;s economy is sputtering more pain may be ahead in 2025 China&#39;s troubles are hitting home for us companies and by the way I&#39;m not cherry-picking this is every article this person has written about China China giving mixed signals on its economy that&#39;s a problem another poit burrow uh meeting ends with no pivot that&#39;s Grim news for China&#39;s economy China responds economic concerns with rate Cuts why that isn&#39;t enough China&#39;s economy is in a rut its demand for Commodities remains strong how does that make sense China&#39;s economy isn&#39;t gaining much steam why that could be a problem China is fighting economic malaise why stimulus isn&#39;t enough China&#39;s slumping stocks need help from Beijing don&#39;t count on it China recovery May pick up here&#39;s what here&#39;s why it may be a selling opportunity alibaba&#39;s Wes illustrate broader China concerns China&#39;s slump is still hurting consumer stocks I mean this lady is unbelievable China&#39;s economy is doing a little better why it won&#39;t lift stocks China&#39;s economy is stabilizing September&#39;s data made disappoint China tries to revive the stock market why gains may not last now if you figure out anyway I&#39;m I&#39;m going to leave it at that just just as China&#39;s economy slows uh Commodities are holding up China&#39;s economic meltdown could spread here&#39;s how China economic pain is deepening don&#39;t expect a quick rescue China us China relations take another hit now what China&#39;s recovery has a big weak spot China stocks are a bust where the Bulls are setting their sights China stocks have lost their Mojo new laws are spying by the way this person is gonna be forced to write the most glowing headlines when alibaba&#39;s at 200 it&#39;s going to say China&#39;s rally is just getting started uh why investors Can&#39;t Get Enough why China&#39;s going to take over the us as biggest GDP that&#39;s when we&#39;re going to be selling the minute they say that China&#39;s GDP is going to take over the US that will be when we sell our first tranch of of stock China&#39;s shares feel the weight of us Crackdown China consumer-led growth looks more like a bounce not a recovery G Talk on China&#39;s private sector doesn&#39;t reinsure investors China&#39;s latest economic plan doesn&#39;t offer much to Bulls you know all of this was in the hole taking you out of your stock at the exact wrong times so you&#39;ve missed the whole run up I&#39;m not saying you because people listening to this have probably been more steadfast but uh China stocks are and this is why if you don&#39;t know what you own and you haven&#39;t done your own work it doesn&#39;t matter who you follow or what you follow follow you&#39;re going to get shaken out from nonsense like this China stocks are rebounding but maybe not for long China Bulls beware winding down the zero Co policy I mean this is like a hired Hitman uh for anti-china headlines and I&#39;ll give you a hint though it would be like hiring an Iranian to write headlines about Israel I mean you know you just can&#39;t make this stuff up I mean the bias is so pronounced and sadly it&#39;s taken so many people out of stock out of Baba at 60 and 70 uh and now they were forced to buy it at 115 120 and they&#39;re getting their teeth knocked out and at 95 they&#39;re going to sell in the hole again because she&#39;s going to write more bad headlines or someone like her and then it&#39;s going to Rally back well past 140 and the next stop will be 160 and at that point she&#39;ll say don&#39;t believe it and they they&#39;ll all buy up and then it&#39;ll pull back to 140 and we&#39;ve gone through this they&#39;ll sell in the hole and then it&#39;s 200 everyone&#39;s going to want it pull back to 180 it it&#39;s just going to be over and over and over X&#39;s third term spells trouble for investors G China&#39;s party Congress offers little for the economy look I took the time to copy and paste these for a reason this is a monster education if you buy Quality Companies when they&#39;re marked down and have confidence in your work and your framework you can withstand this because this is what you have to go through to get these stocks at a bargain at a dislocated period period because they don&#39;t give away multi baggage for free that&#39;s just the way the world Works ladies and gentlemen um so here&#39;s the expected S&amp;P 500 earnings growth mag 7 versus unmagnify as I talked about this is from fact set so um the 493 has just turned the corner from negative to positive then they start to catch the Magnificent 7 remember the Magnificent 7 was at 50% earnings growth just two quarters ago now it&#39;s down going down to 17 and 16 and 15 and 14 whereas the 493 were at negative now they&#39;re 1.7 13.9 14.2 by q1 13.0 Q2 of next year uh 15.6 of Q3 so that&#39;s the story there um we saw the jobs report was good uh here&#39;s the Hang saying got up to this resistance pulled back everyone&#39;s panicking saying it&#39;s a fake out they&#39;re not going to do this stimulus they have to do the stimulus they pivoted not because they wanted to because they were forced to and that will follow through and even if you remember if you don&#39;t listen to what I&#39;m telling you listen to what David teer said last week he said you know uh we&#39;ve already gone over our position limits if we&#39;re lucky enough to get a pullback and shake some people out we&#39;re going to again break our upside uh position limits and buy more and these are the type of Headlines by the way not only am I sending a Christmas card to X for waiting so long and forcing me to buy so much stock at low prices to bring my bases down so low I&#39;m also going to send a Christmas card to this author to this uh journalist uh for taking so many people out of their stock so we could buy it low and now have the benefits of riding it higher and uh and we&#39;re just in the early days for those of you who think the last few weeks has been the greatest thing since sliced bread with all the money we made on the options and even the stock which has been phenomenal uh you ain&#39;t seen nothing yet so if you think the email I sent you tonight has you smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways uh wait till you see what&#39;s to come uh okay so moving on uh doc workers strike okay so that&#39;s funny you know that guy was uh it&#39;s hysterical uh he said you know He was cursing on TV saying we&#39;re GNA hold up the whole world blah blah blah until they give us what we want one article in the New York Post showing an overhead picture of his 7,000 foot mansion and his Bentley parked in the driveway and the thing was it was settled in 24 hours you can&#39;t make this stuff up all right so this shows China stimulus in 2018 2016 2020 followed by a rise in valuation so we&#39;re well below the mean uh PE average and we can and again we&#39;re derated by 50% and that excludes the earnings growth that we&#39;re going to see in the next 24 months uh so you can do the math on that which means double on current earnings power as it re rates and then as earning power expands you add to that China property Shanghai and Shenzhen luxury home sales soar after stimulus package largest weekly flow inflow ever into Emerging Market Equity Funds including China of course they got to get their teeth kicked in after Chasing the top and then once they&#39;re fully despondent because they sold at the bottom bought at the top flush them out again uh they&#39;ll never come back except when we hit 200 on Alibaba and uh and that&#39;ll be that emerging market equities at lowest versus us since 1969 I think a better framework is 1999 everything&#39;s setting up very similarly to that uh and 2022 to 202000 20 2001 to 2007 we covered it a million times small caps emerging markets and it&#39;s playing out okay uh average annualized returns during us political regimes it shows when you have full Republican control is the best for small caps when you have a split uh let&#39;s see here the second best is full Democratic control so small caps like full control from either party the rest of the market prefers a split uh okay Japan rules out Bank bank of Japan interest rate hikes for now okay that means until after the election they&#39;re going to have to do it because of their inflation here&#39;s kweb which had the largest fund flow uh Brendan runs that uh by the way I shared uh with you super great guy super great golfer by the way great course uh that he that he invited me to uh so biggest weekly inflow so you know you get these type of spikes and then it&#39;s got you know you got this at the beginning of the last rally in 2019 and then it kind of cools down uh and the market goes up uh utility seor this is overdone it&#39;s already started rolling over we warned you about that hope you took advantage uh China equity has delivered one of the strongest and most concentrated rallies in its history so far which implies more upside moving out if you look at historical models uh 10 reasons to buy China Equity this was two days ago government has revealed its pain threshold so they finally blink this time is different investors are getting what they hope to for a large extent don&#39;t fight the pboc policy U-turn provoked reating trades that seldom stopped there powerful and tradable rallies can exist even a pro deflationary bar Market inexpensive call options fomo has room to run profit Outlook is improving FedEd loose fed has loosened one constraint on China&#39;s stimulus and China Equity still has a place in in in uh investor portfolios ironically this is from the same shop sside shop that had a uninvestable rating on it uh before it rally 50% equities R tend to rise when interest rates fall so long as there no recession we&#39;ve covered that same thing uh this is the liquidity that I was referring to on Varan Co we&#39;ve got the most fed Cuts 26 in the month of September uh globally that we&#39;ve had since 2020 and 2009 those were times to be buyers of equities not sellers of equities so we&#39;ll pick our spots smart thing to keep an eye on is uh earnings estimates have come down from 227 to uh 277 278 down to 276 um you know I also referenced with Stu the secret to happiness is low expectations so estimates for earnings um have gone from 7.8% for Q3 on June 30th to 4.2% for Q3 uh uh right now so they&#39;ve lowered the bar which will make it easy to step over which a positive surprise uh getting through earning season although Banks start Friday they&#39;re expected to be weak because of low net interest margin and slower loan demand uh that is going to be followed up soon by the IPO machine kicking off and uh probably looks like maybe they&#39;ll get bang some out here in Q4 and try to get bonuses you know I I mean given how Bankers think I wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all to to just like the election clears and they just start banging out I which would imply they&#39;ll probably have a decent fourth quarter uh we took profits on all the big Banks over the summer uh we still own a regional basket which we will hang on to um and maybe read the the banks if they fall back but uh not holding our breath that was a good trade um you know here was net call volume in the fxi obviously you got to smoke all these people with the premium once you burn through that premium you can start to ride again uh which is also what we said about October if you remember that there was so much we talked about the put skew that there was so much premium purchased on a catastro catastrophic fall that probably the most pain to the most amount of people which is what the stock market is designed to do would be grinding sideways through the month of October which is basically what&#39;s happened um on a day-to-day basis and all of that put premiums getting burned through uh which makes a lot of sense so uh let&#39;s see what else do we have here so oh this is a great chart this Shanghai shenzen CSI 300 index you can see after these parabolic moves like you saw in 2020 uh it grinded sideways before it made another huge move straight up so this would be normal uh and we covered the two scenarios we&#39;re going to cover a couple scenarios in the article of the week but one of our things that we said that had to happen What We Needed the FED to cut that happened all of a sudden China stimulates it&#39;s off to the roof we needed China bond yields to go up look what&#39;s happened in the last few weeks trying of bond yields have gone up and look what else happened that that I said had to happen is the Yuan needed to appreciate relative to the US dollar look what started to happen in the recent weeks so all the pieces that we&#39;ve laid out for you are all coming together at once new natural gas power plants announced in 2024 continue to grow as these data centers grow it&#39;s going to be good for com stock which we love and we own uh option skew we covered ourselves uh value versus growth in different interest rate environments value outperforms growth in a four plus percent interest rate environment I think that is going to be uh potentially I think the terminal rate is going to be higher than most people think and we&#39;ve talked about that um and and and and that&#39;s predicated my view that this is more like 1995 a midcycle easing which would imply you know 125 basis points and then off to the races for another four to five years and in that case we&#39;re in four to five value out performs you got a 2002 to 2007 environment Emerging Market small caps yeeha smiling so wide we could eat banana sideways let&#39;s go over to sler thanks to my buddy Rick uh over at RB anyway let&#39;s uh take a look at slomer uh not Rick Robert slomer over at uh RBC and just to give us some broad stuff you can see the S&amp;P here has been consolidating for a while it broke out it&#39;s breaking back to retest maybe we get a full retest uh here in the month of October and then we work our way higher we will see uh here&#39;s the daily chart could push higher could retest I mean or could grind sideways for a little bit which I think is the base case here but you know this is a cup and handle for those of you technicians we don&#39;t spend a lot of time on this stuff but it&#39;s worth paying attention to what other people pay attention to so you can know what to expect equal weight breaking out silently no one&#39;s paying attention to it this is equivalent of The Magnificent 493 type of scenario NASDAQ corrected it&#39;s not yet at that uh breakout level but trying to work its way back uh midcaps broke out quietly they&#39;re getting ready to take their next leg High same with small caps everyone&#39;s saying small caps are crap except for the fact they&#39;ve been going up all year and they&#39;re ready to break out to all new time highs and he&#39;s got a 161 Target I guess Elliot wave if you do the cup and handles it&#39;s usually uh measured move so it would be 400 points above that it would be 18,00 on the 600 which means a lot of stocks are going to Triple in quadruple and same thing with the rdy everyone&#39;s saying small caps are crap except for the fact they&#39;ve been going up all year and they&#39;re going to break out so other than that how was the play Mrs Lincoln September weekly seasonality since 1946 uh shows some weekly weakness in the third week of October which is why we&#39;re not redeploying all the profits and we&#39;re just sitting with it on our hands and if we&#39;re wrong we&#39;ll still find stuff to do and if we&#39;re right we are going to have an absolute shopping spree what they used to call back in the day for those of you knew what Kmart was before a big hedge fund guy destroyed the business uh it&#39;s called a blue light special ladies and gentlemen and the blue light we think will be flashing shortly uh msci Europe same story breaking starting to move and remember I said Emerging Markets will outperform developed markets small will outperform large growth will value will outperform growth and 493 will outperform seven that&#39;s playing out Emerging Market is just getting off the mat this game is just getting started ladies and gentlemen like back in 2002 to 2007 hang saying everyone say the world is ending things straight up of course it&#39;s going to check back and test this and consolidate for a little while before the next big move uh same with uh the weekly it hit this 50% retracement Target from the crash so now maybe it goes back down to this 38.2 this is all kind of useless noise but I just give it to you guys so you have a road map so you don&#39;t freak out and sell your stuff in the Hole uh and know that it&#39;s a normal part of the basing and rally and returning confidence process uh topics is still on the mat I expect that to continue 10-year yield remember we called for the counter Trend rally well here we&#39;re getting it we may be up against resistance and we can resume the downtrend uh with the 10-year yield maybe a little higher before we roll back over dollar counter Trend move people are now saying that dollar weakness is over I think this is a counter Trend bounce maybe it goes a little higher before it resumes the downtrend and breaks out below breaks down below um so it hit this special level uh Canadian dollar people are losing confidence it&#39;s going up it&#39;s going to continue to go up as our most Emerging Market currencies in my view uh Euro same story uh got up to this breakout Point checking back we consol before it breaks out higher and so on and so forth crude traded with China more so than it trade everyone all the commentators saying it was trading with the war it&#39;s not trading with the war it&#39;s trading with China demand you can just overlay the Hang saying or whatever proxy you want to put on it and that&#39;s what you get is China demand uh gold is you know looks like it&#39;s consolidating not for me uh copper this is a China proxy uh straight up now it&#39;s consolidating to be expected you can see it again here at these magical levels that everyone&#39;s so excited about and let&#39;s see if there&#39;s anything else we need to cover from this uh yeah here&#39;s Baba on this I guess this is what Elliot wave or something like that Elliot uh what are these Fibonacci retracements so look it got up to this resistance point at 23.6 and now he thinks it&#39;s going back down to 105 or 90 if it goes back to 90 it would be a gift from God we could reload the options like nobody&#39;s business out to 2027 and make another mint and um utilities rolling over uh uh crown castle will be hurt by that in the short term I&#39;m not worried about it in the long term this is a counter Trend move and yields fizer has an activist in it I like it um I&#39;m keeping an eye on it let&#39;s just put it that way I&#39;m not like I can&#39;t see the path straight away but I do like an activist but they own you know billion dollars of a160 billion dollar company like it&#39;s not totally relevant but it&#39;s something and um I think there&#39;s going to be opportunity there ilmn this is another activist Carl icon&#39;s been bagged in for you know a year and a half I think this thing starts to work also Alam Maro we own a little bit uh we&#39;ve talked about that one we&#39;ll let you know if we&#39;re going to lean into it or not um but it&#39;s moving and and that&#39;s that next here&#39;s update from today with Robert slomer at RBC counter Trend moved getting a little overbought there backed off a little bit at the end of the day on the 10-year yield uh we&#39;ll see on the S&amp;P it&#39;s feeling like it wants to be breakout but that&#39;s a fake could be a fake out let&#39;s see the inflation number on Thursday tomorrow that&#39;s going to be key and Hong Kong here&#39;s the checkback totally to be expected copper doing the exact same thing but the new uptrend is in place higher lows higher highs on to the next some news China rally still has more legs Goldman said that was three days ago before it checked back now I&#39;m sure they have a new paper out saying we&#39;re not so sure just like all of the weather veins blowing in the wind whatever it takes is on the table this is from my buddy over at crane shares brandan Ahern and you should read this article uh the government&#39;s going to stand behind it and and like terer said they they were explicit we&#39;ll do whatever it takes uh here&#39;s my favorite website at Bloomberg that always logs me out and then makes me uh give a pint of blood to prove I am who I am before they let me in and give me the nuclear codes to their articles see if they&#39;ll let me in now I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s unreal the amount of security PayPal completes its first business transaction using stablecoin I don&#39;t really know what that is but I&#39;m glad they&#39;re doing it because it seems to be the way of the future and uh we own a big stake in it so that&#39;s a good thing Boeing withdraws contract offer as union talks break down everyone says oh this is terrible let me tell you what&#39;s terrible if you&#39;re one of these machinists and you got a mortgage coming in every single month and you&#39;ve got a heating bill coming in every single month and you got to put food on the table every single month and you got to pay your car payment every single month and you&#39;re getting no income and that&#39;s basically Management&#39;s bet will give you a fair deal but if you don&#39;t want it we&#39;re going to take it off the table we&#39;re going to go raise 10 billion of capital why well because the Market&#39;s already priced it in so the market the Stock&#39;s actually going to probably rally when they actually put put on the Shelf offer because each um five billion is worth about $12 to the stock so they&#39;ll probably raise $10 billion of equity that&#39;ll be 24 stocks already down 24 my guess is it&#39;s priced in and with that credit watch thing so they&#39;ll raise 10 billion they&#39;ll sit on their hands for three months and the union bosses will start to get screamed at by the wives of the workers that are on strike that can&#39;t put milk on the table and that&#39;s the bet that they&#39;re playing they&#39;ve got a fair offer on the deal maybe they&#39;ll give a little bit more but at some point they got to come to an agreement because the union workers can&#39;t go raise 10 billion to sit it out for another six months but the company is likely going to in a matter of days and they&#39;ll just sit there until they bleed them out and that&#39;s not like a wish or hope or anything like that it&#39;s just the reality of how it&#39;s going to work China&#39;s property stimulus raises optimism but more steps are needed for sectoral turnaround generx CEO says the pressure on the power grid is only going to get worse from weather and Technology we took off a lot of options in the last 24 hours this was buy the rumor sell the news I think um but we didn&#39;t sell a share of stock because we want to own it long term we think it&#39;s still undervalued but we made so much on the options we had to take profits sit on the cash and wait for opportunity fizer and CVS are attracting activists yes to fiser maybe to CVS I don&#39;t like it I like it anyway so we&#39;ll leave it there China markets Warren G that more stimulus is needed no kidding UPS FedEx stocks are right for buying the case for a shipping upturn I&#39;ve got my eye on those are kind of interesting and now the article of the week which I wrote 10 minutes ago fake out or Breakout stock market and sentiment results so here is the chart of Alibaba we&#39;re going to get back to it in a second uh oh here are my notes for vanney uh we didn&#39;t get to cover the picks which I was going to do VF Corp and Cooper standard but we ran out of time um because the uh speaker before me was talking about how kamla Harris likes to exercise on an elliptical and watch F1 racing so there you go that does take precedence over Tom Hayes&#39;s view of Brack and Daryl I completely agree with that um General market uh I&#39;m joking and and very grateful for any time I get on uh to be honest with you so uh okay we have said to expect three key developments number one we had told you to expect a counter Trend rally in the US dollar despite the intermediate long-term trend of being down uh two uh counter Trend rally in the US Treasury 10-year yield despite the intermediate term Trend being down and we&#39;ve got that which we covered three a punishing consolidation for everyone who bought Chinese stocks in Alibaba after it rallied 50% off the lows in a matter of weeks this is healthy and will take out the late money week sisters before the next move higher I anticipate this pullback the last a couple of weeks to a couple of months once all the new money that chased up gets flushed in the hole we will power back above 120 and Beyond again if you look at the featured image of Alibaba on the top of this article you will find the current pattern is pretty normal after coming out of despondency the question is whether the current blue circle circle one several months of violent consolidation before a huge move higher or Circle two several days or weeks of moderate consolidation before a huge move higher so let me show you what I&#39;m talking about Circle one it&#39;s here are we here or are we here are we here or are we here so you got this initial thing um I&#39;m kind of of The View that we are here and here and the reason is is because we did have a violent move off the bottom and then a large consolidation um bigger than normal so I think the odds favor this I&#39;m not opposed to this or this that just gives us more opportunity to get some more exposure but uh now that we got a lot of cash uh but I think we&#39;re more like here and we&#39;re probably going to keep pounding higher over time and that&#39;s going to be great and this would also be more consistent with a view that once we get through you know once this thing starts going they&#39;re not going to let anyone in and as you can see in the last four weeks they didn&#39;t let anyone in you know no one was buying until it was already 115 117 they missed the whole move and that&#39;s why they&#39;re going to get uh they&#39;re getting punched in the throat now get rid of those late shares give them back to strong hands and then we&#39;ll go higher next is so we favor the ladder but our open-minded as the intrinsic value is still dramatically higher than the current price we would love a chance to reload long-dated options would have to temporarily drop below $100 a share for me to execute on that for another 5x Plus bagger depending on the Vintage but we are content just owning all the stock for the long term we have not sold one share and we own a ton uh and aggregate much lower much much lower levels uh so where is Alibaba on the Justin Mammoth emotional cycle that we&#39;ve covered several times over the last five years you tell me and don&#39;t quote unquote deny it so our case is that we&#39;re not here we&#39;re more likely here in which case after a little bit of consolidation after that first violent move up we are going to make another violent moving up and just here is when we&#39;re going to start to see those headlines turn to China is going to be the largest country in the world blah blah blah uh overtake the US they&#39;re not by the way they&#39;re going to take a run at it the next three to five years and then they&#39;re going to be toast because the one Child Left Behind and we&#39;re going to ride this parabolic move and uh sell to those excited people who were the most negative at the bottom Cooper standard I love well I don&#39;t love this but I&#39;m going to go through some information here uh I love the company I love the stock I don&#39;t love why they might have a short-term Catalyst uh one podcast video cast recent podcast I mentioned that I estimated $3 a share in earnings per share for every 200,000 cars of produ us production above 15.7 million annual SAR uh you should click here if you don&#39;t know Cooper standard we started our position in the low $5 range in May 2022 in size and we&#39;ve added over time it&#39;s cheap as hell even here in our view and um so go read the thesis and see the progression over the years uh hurricane Milton is a tragedy it will leave Devastation in its path destroying homes schools hospitals and more by the way hat tip to my buddy Jackson You Know Who You Are uh it will also destroy a lot of cars that will be total losses and replaced with new ones by insurance companies and owners one of the points we have emphasized repeatedly is that in 2017 when Cooper standard earned $719 a share and traded at $146 per share the US had 17.1 million SAR uh which versus now you know 15 and change what I did not realize is that is that was the same year that hurricane Irma and hurricane Harvey hit the US hard and took 630,000 cars with it that needed to be replaced and helped with the peak SAR number so that probably contributed uh you know maybe the Run rate the peak run rate then was 165 and they got 637 cars uh that took it to 171 you know maybe we&#39;re at 157 you get 500 600,000 cars you&#39;re at 165 you&#39;re adding 800,000 cars which at $3 per 200,000 above 15.7 uh you know you&#39;re looking at uh they&#39;ll screw it up so you&#39;re looking at $12 a share so even if they screw it up and wind up with $8 a share you you tell me the multiple is it going to be a trough multiple of 10 times or a peak multiple that they had of 20 times if Milton is anything like these two devastating hurricanes in 2017 there will be another half million cars required than estimated over the next six months using the rough operating leverage formula I&#39;ve calculated and the impact on EPS for CPS is possible we could hit our earnings Target much sooner than anticipated and the implications would be massive time will tell if Milton is not as Extreme as anticipated the previous timeline is still in play if mil Milton reeks unexpected Havoc our timeline could be quickly exceled accelerated onto the general view greed is at 72 so getting closer to extreme on the fear and greed although the National Association of active investment managers still at 86.6 four which is not quite extreme so we&#39;re kind of in this grind sideways mode uh okay so congratulations to all the new clients that came in during our early Q2 and Q3 we reopened to smaller accounts starting last Wednesday and will remain open to the end of next week uh to see if you qualify and take advantage of this opening click here larger accounts 5 to 10 million can access bespoke service at their preference here enter your information not a solicitation as always uh the podcast is opinion not advice see terms at hedge fund tips.com and also disclaimer at the end of this video uh consult your financial advisor and um have a nice day move on uh earnings Healthcare top 30 weights revisions in the last 60 days revised up for 2025 by 0.58% so that&#39;s good same with financials R revised up uh 21 basis points in the last 60 days top 30 weights for 2025 earnings revised down like I said from 277 to 276 still going to have 14% growth uh we&#39;ll see if they take them back up they&#39;ve set the bar low for Q3 and GDP now is actually climbing from 2.5 to 3.1 in the last uh week so um so we should see uh that be helpful all right uh as far as economic data the big one is CPI tomorrow uh nothing else really glaring here other than that and PPI on Friday so the podcast is done we&#39;re gonna move on to the ask me anything questions we&#39;ve got quite a few this week so let&#39;s kick it off now Now with uh will kuharski you said in the past uh if Nvidia keeps up with this mega growth would become oneir of US GDP if this is true at what point is the shiny object no longer popular Taxi Driver story and can no longer sustain its market cap is it even possible to be a double from here 3.2 trillion to 6.4 trillion if not what&#39;s the reason to hold it besides the popular name when you can get Returns on many stocks you mentioned down 50 to 60% uh for me I see no reason on it so uh I&#39;ll leave it at that but um you know when you have the CEO telling you that demand is quote unquote insane and he&#39;s dumping a billion dollars a stock at the same time you know I I I watch what people do not what they say so um we&#39;ll leave it at that on to the next Drew burn what are your thoughts on andava at the current valuation is not a made a position of mine added some recently we&#39;ve covered this before it&#39;s like a UK software company it&#39;s cheap but you really have to know the industry I think you could take it for a trade uh and be okay on to the next one I don&#39;t I like the business but again what&#39;s the mo what what is the Moe how you have to have absolute to make it a big position you have to have absolute confidence that they have a software mode in a growing area that no one can breach it and it&#39;s not Trading like it has that so um you know this is not about generators that have 70% of the market you can sleep at night this is like someone could come in and put them out of business overnight which is why Buffett never did technology um so let&#39;s move on to that but on balance you&#39;re probably probably okay all right um moving on to the next one Tim thoughts on ticker C NC cnxc um casts declining revenues are okay margins are can&#39;t see huh technology infused customer experience solutions that sounds like a whole lot of I gotta be honest with you technology infused customer experience I mean it sells sounds sells like aroma therapy I mean like what do you company CX process optimization Tech techology Innovation front and back office automation analytics it sounds like a me2 company let&#39;s see if they&#39;re generating some cash uh you&#39;re there&#39;s no way you&#39;re going to have ever have full confidence that they have any type of moat and they can&#39;t be put out of business tomorrow but as a trade is a different story so uh low return on Capital uh let&#39;s see cash flow it&#39;s probably okay for now uh uh yeah cash flow is okay for now the balance sheet look like probably okay 2645 billion of debt on a tech company and on a tech infused customer experience company my goodness uh I&#39;m gonna say pass moving along um elf no one wanted it at 15 now everyone wants it at what 150 let&#39;s see yeah so you&#39;re stuck in recency biased you&#39;re like wow it was 221 now it&#39;s only 100 bucks I mean it was $6 three years ago I think this is me too uh for me I&#39;m going to pass this looks like a broken momentum stock and I&#39;m just going to leave it at that maybe it works for a trade but I think it&#39;s way too early to get involved in that uh favorite books that you&#39;ve read I talk about it all the time Dominic Harlin um number one you need to go to berkshire.com read every single annual letter that Buffett&#39;s ever written number two the intelligent investor by Ben Graham number three security analysis also by Ben Graham um those are the key and then read a lot of annual reports I I like Source material I don&#39;t like secondhand material uh uh okay let&#39;s see here uh venod asked about Apache I&#39;m not interested we&#39;ve looked at that in recent weeks uh probably good for a bounce I I just don&#39;t like it I like Comstock resources and I own Comstock resources Patrick McKenzie micro strategy uh not for me pass wrong podcast um Richard McCrae huge fan since mid 2022 thank you a longtime listener first time caller uh thanks for sharing your knowledge and experience I followed your TLT trade some months back with positive results uh yeah so we we told you when we took that off um price of TLT are you considering buying TLT calls again around the current price uh no because it was way more asymmetric I think you could grind for a while here and that&#39;s how you get hurt buying premium so um yeah I see what yeah I know what you&#39;re talking about here uh it&#39;s just not as asymmetric as it was I mean when we were buying it it&#39;s like it&#39;s a completely different story this is going to work higher and higher over the next few years uh I mean we just had a big we had a win on that so I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m going to get back in or if I&#39;ll ever get back in I think there&#39;s other derivative ways I want to play it I think utilities are going to uh get hurt a little bit more which tells me yields will probably go up a little bit more so I&#39;m going to just table that for now Richard but I you&#39;re thinking process is correct I just don&#39;t it&#39;s not a fat enough pitch like it was when we got involved uh Vincent sentore hey Tom happy to see everything&#39;s been going great for you I&#39;m curious on your thoughts around Wendy&#39;s strong fundamentals standout training below fiveyear average PE and a dividend I don&#39;t know this is a me too uh you know we got another I do want to get involved in restaurants and consumer discretionary this is not the one I I just I don&#39;t know I looked at this a while back I don&#39;t really love it I&#39;ll tell you I I&#39;d rather play around with something that&#39;s just tanked like Jack in the Box which another user asked about I&#39;m not ready for Wendy&#39;s I mean if if Nelson pelts couldn&#39;t really turn it around I I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a lot there um and I think I went to one I wasn&#39;t really happy with it I don&#39;t know or every time I think about going to one I&#39;m like I don&#39;t really want to go there and then I just keep driving so I whatever it&#39;s just not for me Jim Jones if a equity jumps extremely in a short amount of time but not your price Target what&#39;s your process uh well my process is we will take profits on the options because they&#39;ll be up you know if it&#39;s straight premium they&#39;ll be up 3 4X if it spreads it&#39;ll be up 4 to 7x uh so we do take profits but we generally don&#39;t sell any underlying stock uh until it hits our full price Target Michael Michael oer regular listener your fantastic analysis could you please share your thoughts on sqm uh yeah this is Chile I do want to get some exposure in Latin America that fertilizers potassium nitrate chemicals blah blah blah uh largest exports are to China well that&#39;s why I don&#39;t play that because I have enough exposure to China with um and that&#39;s what you have to be careful of when you look at your portfolio I&#39;m looking for relatively uncorrelated bets uh I think this is going to work just like Bob is going to work um because it&#39;s going to be a China Play Just Like goose is going to work just like VF corp&#39;s going to work so the last thing I need is one more but would I consider this one for a fresh one ABS I think I absolutely let me look at the financials here negative free cash flow declining this um huh they&#39;re kind of in hard shape here margins declining cash flow declining revenues declining price price is probably priced in a lot of it but um not in love let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet I&#39;m going to tell you right now I think there are easier ways to make money two billion of debt the balance sheet seems okay I think you&#39;ll probably do okay with this it&#39;s probably going to take longer to build a base than you think it&#39;s not going to go straight up uh I think it&#39;s a pretty good find I think it&#39;s time to start to look in Latin America and South America so I like the thinking here I&#39;m not ready for it but I think you&#39;ll do fine uh mentioned closing out 3M in the mid 1220s uh from the low of 73 yeah but you also got SV ventum number one and you and we also made a ton on our options so and we wanted to book a win because we you know the thing about the advantage that an individual has over a PM is that you know as a PM you have to book wins because you have to deliver return so you can&#39;t just ride everything up and down all the time so when something gets close enough to your targeted value and you feel like the Market&#39;s a little bit overdone at the time you book The Profit you know and you don&#39;t be a pig and you leave the last few percent to someone else uh but on that one uh if you look at what our options did on top of it and the total return with the spin shares and everything else uh we&#39;re perfectly comfortable with that if it backed down to like a 100 again would we re relook at it and see what the business looks like now you bet we would um we just thought that you know with the vast majority of their litigation risk in the rearview mirror we got paid for that but there&#39;s there&#39;s still some tail of risk on that and then they&#39;ve got to turn the business around which they seem to be doing it will be fine but um we would need to get it at lower prices to get interested in again uh this is Jan asking me about Walgreens boots again every week someone ask me and every week I say no have at it it&#39;s going to be it&#39;ll work as a trade but I don&#39;t want to own that business long term until I can walk into a Walgreen and not have to page someu vaping in the corner to take 10 minutes to come over and get me Gillette razor blades I&#39;m not interested on to the next next time I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel Lan Neo uh what are your thoughts on Aliant Al NT uh what is this thing I think it&#39;s sells precision and specially controlled motion components and systems various Industries brushless DC motors torque Motors uh gearing drives motion [Music] rollers huh Aliant this is a tiny company I mean uh that&#39;s not really the kind of stuff we do unless it&#39;s called Cooper standard uh let&#39;s just see here huh not a great business it just doesn&#39;t generally uh return investor generate a return on investor Capital but uh uh it is generating free cash how&#39;s the balance sheet $30 million debt relative to $30 million of uh cash uh not a good enough business for me to get interested but I think it might work for you um good work Samar do you agree that Lisa should be classified as dead or not generally no uh but I&#39;m not losing sleep over the fact they made the change and uh you got to play the hand you&#39;re dealt not the not the hand you want David Ola he&#39;s asking about uh the repurchase program that they have and the cash that they have um number one your numbers are not correct um so read that carefully [Music] um but they&#39;re not going to be buying back stock yet they sold off the other business to deleverage now they&#39;re going to get it efficient that these two quarters are weak uh which they said would be weak and uh they&#39;ll get the um Hub and spoke model in plays for this distribution center and then they&#39;re going to start to expand 100 stories a year it&#39;s going to be great and if you ask anyone who knows anything about Shane o Kelly and what he did at HD Supply it&#39;s just to sit on your hands and wait and he&#39;s going to work his magic just like Brack and darl uh just like um Alex Chris over at PayPal uh these are all winners uh we bet on these jockeys and uh this time this one will be no different uh is your market cap Target for Baba a trillion dollars $800 price no never said that never even alluded to that so uh this must have come in yeah this came in last week when the stock was at 120 uh Landon H been tracking Jack as a potential to buy due to significant opportunities for cost cut D growth opportuni for both Jack and Del Taco what are your thoughts on this idea I generally like it and I&#39;m generally interested and I&#39;ve not done anything yet because I wait for fat pitches but this is getting closer and closer to a fat pitch for me um but we&#39;re not there yet uh thing I find when I go to California all the time is that like I walk into there and they just have so many options that&#39;s the that&#39;s kind of like I don&#39;t love that and I don&#39;t like this negative free cash flow either this is kind of not ideal seems like a confused menu revenues are starting to pick up margins are going down I think they&#39;re just trying to throw a lot of stuff at the wall they&#39;ll have to clean up that menu and uh normalize it but fact of the matter is everything there&#39;s pretty pretty good I mean if you&#39;re not looking to uh take a blood test the next day for your physical uh it&#39;s not the end of the world so I think eventually they&#39;ll get it right I think it might be a little early uh that&#39;s new client and txt I&#39;d rather write Boeing H you know Boeing can drag on and go down another 20 bucks but at the end of the day it&#39;s going to be 250 260 in a year year and a half and probably over 300 shortly thereafter so I&#39;m not really worried about it txt has run a lot I&#39;m sure it&#39;s uh got good numbers here cash flows going down stock price has been going up revenues have been recovering margins are kind of bumpy I I don&#39;t like it as much I think this I mean you know this thing&#39;s up 5x in the last few years why are you interested now uh wrong podcast but probably a good company and I don&#39;t think you get tremendously hurt doing it I just think there are higher and better uses for your money right now with that said we&#39;ll be back next time uh by the way anyone going to be in Scottdale or Phoenix uh newer potential clients in the next three days from Friday through Sunday want to grab a quick coffee probably won&#39;t be able to do a meal because I&#39;m there to hang with my kids and my wife uh love to do that just reach out through hedge fund tips.com we&#39;ll be back next week probably from Connecticut and in the meantime make it a great one bye [Music] [Music] he [Music] [Music] for now
