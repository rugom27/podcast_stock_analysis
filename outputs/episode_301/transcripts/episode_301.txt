Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 3001st podcast video cast for the week ending July 24th, 2025. A lot to cover today, but as always, family first. A couple photos here uh with John, Craig, Caitlyn, my beautiful wife, uh Craig's wife, Sue, and Chris over at a restaurant, Crystal Cove. We had an incredible time talking life, talking business, talking all types of ideas. And uh huge shout out to Sue and Craig Bridgeman who are in from Dubai. Sue just launched her new book which is called the CQ Edge. It's all about communication. She's going to be at on Mornings with Maria on Fox Business. So you can find out all about Sue here. Um, then I want to congratulate my friend Andrew Keys who just launched the Ether machine for all of you crypto nuts that love crypto. Uh, they're going public with over $1.5 billion of fully committed capital. Part of that he's contributing uh portion of his personal Ether holdings. He's contributing 650 million uh of his own Ethereum into it. They're going to do staking, restaking, so it has yield uh and maybe something like the micro strategy of Ether, but uh I'm slandering it because I have zero competence or expertise in this area. I know a lot of you do. All of his details are at the ethermachine.com. Uh and he explains it for people who have an interest and an ability. I think the the huge cha takeaway uh was when he was on CNBC and they said why do you own Ethereum and not Bitcoin Bitcoin and he said why would I buy a landline when I could buy an iPhone and uh if you understand how he speaks about it and look up some of his media it's pretty pretty interesting for those of you who have that competency but I stay in my lane uh and do what I do best. We buy hammers and shovels and airplanes and amusement parks and uh easy peasy stuff that I don't have to predict the future. So, um ah yeah, forgot the most important thing which is uh Junior Olympics going on. We used to have to fly from the east coast for this. Now it's right in our backyard. Both Mimi and Annabelle are playing their first games this morning. I'm going to be at probably 10 games uh over the weekend. But a couple quick highlights here. Here's uh Annabelle And then uh All right. So, right here gets down the field. Boom. [Music] Puts it away. All right. Very exciting. And then Mimi is doing incredible stuff. Look at this one. >> Boom. All right, couple more quick ones here and we'll get right down to it. But this is what we do. Family first, ladies and gentlemen. >> Here she goes down the side again. [Music] Skip shot and final. Watch this one timer. This is pretty awesome. Boom. How you doing? All right, here we go. Uh, thanks to my buddy who sends this over. Let's look at some charts here. Uh, we got a lot of great stuff. So, yeah, we broke out here. Everyone's like, everyone's looking here. Recency bias. Oh, it's gone too far too fast. I've been saying it tends to keep pushing higher. Look, we are running out of some gas. But what you're seeing under the surface, here's the theme, ladies and gentlemen. Pay close attention. Okay, small and short. Small and short. Okay, this is where money is starting to go because it's run out of things. managers caught offside since April, sold in the hole, chase up, have to buy the lagards that haven't worked, which is now the most shorted stocks, which are concentrated in midcap and small cap, and we're seeing all of our names just skyrocket this week. Um, just absolutely incredible the things that have been left behind. That theme is going to continue. So, even if this S&P comes back and checks back and scares the hell out of everyone who sold here and bought here and now we go back down or god forbid all the way back down to 6,000 to really get these guys screwed before going up to the next level. Um, so be it. Focus on what we've been telling you the whole time and um and you are now smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways. There's no question about it. uh which means we probably get some volatility in the next couple of weeks. So uh chillax uh we went through by the way in episode 300 and again thank you so much uh all the loyal viewers making this thing go and it's going to keep going and it keeps growing. It's super exciting delivering a lot of value. Um, we went through, you know, 30 something, I don't know, 15 or 30 names that we've discussed on the podcast, some some owned uh by us and clients, etc., and basically saying, yeah, the market's moved a long way in a short period of time, but these names haven't even gotten started. And this week, a lot of them were just like galloping. I mean, like we've never seen before. So, go back to the first part of that, and we're not going to go through all the names again, uh, and just see what we're talking about there. So, there's equal weight. It hasn't even broken out yet. This is where the lagards are. Look at small caps. This is I mean these are the most powerful patterns for those of you who care about technicals. I don't but I pay attention to it. The the the longer these things go sideways when they break out it is so monster. This is small cap index. This is where you're going to get your value. Yeah, it's had a huge run in the last few weeks. It's just beginning. When this thing breaks out, it's going to go for years. This is going to be like 2001 to 2006 for small caps. So, pay attention. We have our exposure. You know where where that is and we're pretty excited. Here's um Europe XUK. Um and so we got uh All right. Uh then we got Hang Sang. This is amazing. Talk about a choppy uptrend, but it's holding that and now looks like it's ready to break out to the next level before we start to work our way to new highs. That is exciting. We're starting to see it in uh Baba this week again, which is pretty cool. I could tell we were at a turning point at 105 when everyone was just puking, oh, it's not doing anything, blah, blah, blah. And we were just buying. It was so beautiful because we got so much new money in uh and we were able to buy Baba as a new position for the first time in a long time. Uh because it had shot up, you know, bas blended basis $82. It had shot up to 148. Uh and we're not we weren't going to put new money in after, you know, more than doubled. um uh and now it pulled back and now it's now it's moving back up into the 120s before its next final move. This will be the most skeptical move of the entire time and uh everyone will think it's going to top at $148 again and it's going to just blow right through it and people are going to go, "Oh no, oh no." And then all these people who sold at $60, who sold at $105 will be buying over $200. Uh and um look at this look at this setup. I mean, it doesn't get any clearer than that. I mean, the measured move, you start to look at uh 1960 to 25, that's a 25% move. So, Baba probably gets 30, 40, 50%. And then it goes look look at look at my buddy Brendan's Kb ETF, this sideways channel for three years. This thing is going to absolutely skyrocket. Uh Tokyo could care less. uh 30-year 10-year yields. So, another fake out move back lower. Here we go, ladies and gentlemen. Dollar counter trend bounce will resume downtrend over time. Euro, no one would have predicted this except for the incredible viewers of Headphone Tips with Tom Hayes. Way to go. And all my skeptical Canadians, I said, have faith. Here was the overthrow. Everyone got nervous. Now you've broken through the downtrend. and you're retesting and you're going to continue to push higher over time. Um, energy just in this range. Uh, gold, uh, you know, couldn't get enough here. Hasn't done anything. We'll see what happens with that. I wouldn't be a buyer, but that's not what I do. I could care less. Copper, PhD in economics is showing you what China economy is recovering. Global economy is recovering, just breaking out right now. Um, and then you look at uh some names. I thought there was one that was pretty pretty interesting, which was Apple's been kind of dead money for a while here. Um, Duke Energy. Here we go. Crown Castle. uh long long downtrend. Broke out at 106. Uh now just reported earnings. Had a strong earnings call. I think it's up to like 115. This is just early days. Now it's now it's breaking out. Everyone's like, "Oh, what's your target price? None of your business. That's for my client's benefit." But a lot higher. Um let's see. These start to look interesting as we consider uh consolidation in the railroad space. Canadian Pacific. I want to get some exposure in transports. I don't know if it's uh if it's um UPS or or one of those, but uh Canadian Pacific is something I've got my eye on and I want to start to study the railroad sector a little bit more carefully. Uh here's some more stuff from my buddy over at RBC yields. Um what else? Homebuilder index. Here's a beautiful base. It's sitting here at resistance, grinding sideways. This is going to be the rate play. You look at weekly momentum, everything, and you're you're starting to see the things move ahead. Generrack is on a run. Stanley Black & Decker is on a run. Obviously, uh GXO with Brad Jacobs is on a run. Uh excuse me, not GXO. GXO is on a run. We own that. But QXO, the new building supply rollup. So, uh, pay close attention to this for a TEL. And what's in here? A lot of small caps and midcaps, which is consistent with what? Small and short, high short interest. It's very simple. Most managers caught sideways, still underweight, dramatically behind their benchmark, desperate to keep their jobs. They can't buy those things that have doubled off the lows. they got to buy those things that uh are lagging and those are high short interest smaller midcap stocks uh that haven't moved yet and and you're just seeing the short squeezes and the shorts it just goes so fast when they start to get squeezed uh obviously you saw the example of Kohl's and things like that but a lot in our portfol I mean look at advanced auto parts I mean I I can't tell you messages I was getting at 30 are are they going out of business now it's at what 70 or 80 bucks I I haven't looked at it today. Um and just getting started by the way. Uh here we go. Oil service index. This is where National Oil Well Varco, a new name we talked about last week. Uh here we go. Early days, ladies and gentlemen. Moving along. I got to move along today. This got to get done. Uh all right. So, let's look at some of the indicators because everyone says the market's overbought. We know the market's overbought. We know the market's frothy. We know we could get some consolidation. But when you look under the hood, the thing that's blowing my mind right now besides all these indicators, the Mlen being in kind of mid-range versus extended range is that uh even at Association of Active Investment Managers, they hate themselves because they sold in the hole, then they bought up and now they're skeptical that they've bought up, which means it's probably going to keep pushing it in their face. But look at this in terms of breath. Uh uh stocks on a PMO crossover buy signal. It's like a 5200 cross type of nonsense thing, but it gives you an indication that's down at zero, which tells me breath is is weak, which means there can be a lot of even if the indices stall, which they hopefully should. Um, under the surface, these there are a lot of names that can keep pushing higher uh even if mag 7 uh breathe. Same with Dow Jones. So we got the S PMO by all then PMO by Dow Jones. This is not what you see at super tops. This is what you see, you know, where breath expands and it's a sign of health in the market. Same with PMO by SPX. Again, you know, we're not like up here or up here. It's just um it's it's what I've been saying for two weeks. If you look at all the media like the four hours of media that I did last week um and I explained how during V-shaped recoveries and that's what made us so successful during COVID. It's when you come third 25 30% off the lows in a short period of time that overbought pushes because it it just so much money was wrongfooted that irrespective of the multiples or the fundamentals they they they are panic buying it it's like uh it's like throwing someone a bottle of water in the desert. They they got to buy anything that hasn't moved. So hail Mary hope they they've got nothing to lose. Hail Mary, hope and a prayer, they they can catch up and keep their jobs. So, um, everything x the heaviest weights now has to be bid by these people who got it wrong. Okay? And it's it's the majority of of managers got it wrong, not the people on hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. You guys got it right. I keep getting these messages. This guy's like, "Oh, I made this and this and this and this and this and this." And I was like, and I'm looking at all his names. of like he didn't even get in them at the lows. Like he just got in them a few weeks ago. It's like oh my god. Um and he's happy. So there you go. This we're keeping an eye on. Okay. If this moves back up to, you know, 170 175, we may be at or near. This is when the smart money starts to buy insurance one standard deviation plus out of the money. um expecting like big big corrections 10% plus uh we're not there. This tends to climb a wall of worry. So again, I just try to be dispassionate uh unbiased look at the data and play the probabilities. And uh right now it tells me that the type of names we're in probably have a little bit more gas. And then you got this kind of ambiguity. This is not an extreme bullishness or bearishness. This is confusion. Confusion tends to be wall of worry climbing environment. Cox automotive report uh from Tuesday. Key highlights retail sal. Oh, by the way, I forgot to thank um uh Mark for having me over to NBCC and the reception. Had such an incredible day over there. No pictures for that one. Jesse, uh for having me over to your office and sharing sharing ideas. I really enjoyed that time. Thank you for that. All right. Uh, retail sales for new and used vehicles are rising in July, signaling renewed consumer momentum. Loan rates are easing from 25-year highs with low interest financing reaching levels last seen in mid 2022. Uh, dealer activity is up year-over-year on Autotrader and dealer track pointing to strong consumer engagement. Consumer spending rebounds. Um, June is now accelerated back to April levels. Weekly spending trends show renewed upward trajectory. Consumer sentiment index rode.7% in July after 3.6% dip in June. Retail sales strengthen. Uh new sales are trending higher compared. Why is all this important? Because we have a huge position in Cooper Standard from May of 2022 when we initiated at about $510. It's uh I think it got close to $25 this week. This thing is going a lot higher and the volumes haven't even begun yet. Now they're beginning and they're happening and we're we're pretty excited. Um Warren Buffett, price is what you pay, value is what you get, which is effectively the theme of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes, not getting distracted by shiny objects. Uh Munger, our job is to find a few intelligent things to do, not keep up with every damn thing in the world. I mean, I talk to these geniuses in uh crypto space and technology encryption and all this stuff, and I'm like, listen, that's that's above my pay grade. I just buy hammers and airplanes and rubber ceiling stuff and uh generators and uh uh things, you know, roofing roofing supplies and things I could totally understand with predictable cash flows. I don't have to be a genius. Uh and I we could just make doubles and triples every few years, rinse, repeat, uh and sleep like a baby at night. So, uh, we'll do that. We'll we'll leave the we'll leave the hardlifting to the super smart people. Let them make their 100 baggers in their businesses and then when they cash out, they can give me 20 30% of it. I'll run it for them. They can sleep like a baby and uh and and uh everyone's happy. Another awesome picture from a guy from Dylan C who's wearing his uh hedge fund tips polo out to the Hamptons this summer right before he starts his investment banking job straight out of college. Uh thanks so much for sending that in. Dylan, you are on your way, my man. And uh for those of you who want to get up on the website, uh tons of orders for the for the merch at hedgefundtips.com. Click on the hat there. you can get yours and support it and uh show people you are in the know. Uh but more importantly, be be part of the community. Get your pictures in. Let's put them up and uh show how awesome you are. Move moving along here to uh pod chart information. Let's go to lithium on the mend. We're going to cover that in the weekly article. That's a big deal. Um, as you've seen with Albamaro, couldn't give it away a few weeks ago in the ' 50s, now uh in the 80s. So, uh, it's just it's it's a real fun time. I got to be honest with you. Global equities breath is improving. This was consistent with our theme. Here is the healthc care select sector versus the S&P 500. And I look at Baxter and I just continue. You know, this is very similar to uh Comtock Resources. We've had a huge run in it, but that was our only energy exposure and rightly so. And we're just like, God, we're going to need more exposure in energy. And we laid out national oil. Well, Varco, I god, this is this again is a once in a-lifetime opportunity here. Healthc care relative to the S&P going all the way back to 2000. I really want more exposure than just one name. So, we're working on a bunch. But in fairness, actually I I don't lose sleep at night cuz we have the biotech basket which is going to take off as this takes off and we have that. But there is a lot of opportunity in healthcare. If you've missed everything and uh you you know you're just joining us recently and haven't benefited from all all the stuff we've been talking about in this huge huge huge run uh since the beginning of the year by the way. I mean, we've we we've not just the last few months. Um, healthcare would be where I'd start to pay attention. Healthcare and small caps. China's made a huge contribution to global money supply, which is a huge driver. Flows into emerging market equity funds in the past two years, going parabolic. How you doing? No one expected except for you, the incredible supporters of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. Moving along. By the way, I just want to thank you guys because I I know not everyone can be afford to become clients, but I have been getting a lot of clients in that um I you know, I say, you know, where'd you hear about us? Blah blah blah. And and more and more people are like, well, my friend told me about your podcast. I've listened for the last six months. I've made some money off your ideas. Uh but I got a business to run, a life to live. I'm I'm already rich. I don't want to watch markets. Uh and um so it's working and and that's the type of thing that we see and we just want to keep going because we know you guys are out there doing whatever you can to give back and we're grateful for that and we're going to continue to deliver this value um uh to reward that. And uh I'm I'm humbled by seeing you guys going out there helping people you love and sharing it and not being selfish and keeping it for yourself. So thank you so much for that. Uh now if you look at emerging markets going parabolic. Um, this is, um, by the way, the most rewarding ones are the ones that had no money or had very little money and have made enough money listening to the podcast that are now becoming clients. Those are the ones that are blowing my mind more more than anything else. Um, and I can't I can't tell you what those calls mean to me. So, uh, okay. Emerging markets allocation, global mutual funds. They are still unbelievably underweight. Remember 2001 to 2006, they went bananas. We're here. We're just coming out of the woods and people don't believe it. And that's the beautiful time to be involved. Uh diverging small versus large cap stock dynamic in US versus rest of the world. Small versus large price. Here's the opportunity guys. Going back again back to that analog early 2000s record inflows into materials. That was, you know, we were pounding the table. Laugh shall be first. We did it in December, guys. Now, now people can't get enough elbow, you know, and it's early early days. 4-week average and share buybacks versus the S&P 500. You can see that strong and long. Uh S&P 500 earnings, revisions, breath going up in a massive way. Again, not the things you see in unhealthy markets. This is the things you see off the lows. Uh, and if you remember this huge move, uh, March, you had a retest in 2023. This is 2022 to 2023, 2022 lows. Uh, this is when we were buying tech when no one wanted it. Amazon and Google, quick doubles there. Um, this lasts for a while, ladies and gentlemen. This lasts for a while. That's why I say like, yeah, we can consolidate. Yeah, we're overbought. Same thing here. They didn't believe it. Um, US retail sales by kind of business. Motor vehicle is at the top of the chart. Store retailers top of the chart. Clothing and clothing accessories top of the chart. Bracken, you better deliver for us this quarter, my man, because we our fingers are bleeding getting getting uh buying in stock at 12 bucks here. So, uh, let's go. Uh, EPS and revenue beat. Um, huge earnings quarter just as we expected. Remember I said bar so low you could step over it. Don't have to jump over it. Secret happiness low expectations. This is what it looks like. Uh, historical sector weights. It is going back to 2020 high uh 2000 highs uh and healthc care back to 2000 lows. This is what you wanted to be buying here. We got to get more healthc care exposure. That's all I'm saying. I mean, we do have we got enough with the XBI exposure and the Baxter, but this is when I want to be greedy. When others are fearful, this is when I want to be greedy as hell. Uh if I was a hedge fund guy, I'd probably set up an SPV special purpose vehicle for all those sophisticated people. uh and just load it with five healthcare names and you know add some leverage because the time is now. Uh so there's a hint for those of you listening in. Uh here's biotech just starting guys. This is going to break through and just crush it. Uh and we do have a lot of exposure there. So I'm excited. That's again sideways channel. When these things break they go for years, not minutes, not weeks, not hours. CTAs are about to double their equity exposure over the next two weeks. Again, you know, revisiting biotech's last decade going back to early 2000s right before boom time. Healthcare guys, biotech realized and consensus EPS growth for US equity indices. What's going to grow the most is small caps negative last year 21% this year 30 37% still can't give them away what is going to lag S&P this year only 7% earnings growth look double plus almost 2 and 1 halfx earnings growth 25 to 30% lower multiple. You got to have small cap exposure valuations. Have the high. By the way, all this is opinion, not advice. For education andformational purposes only. Go to hedge funips.com. Click on terms. While you're there, get a hat. Why not? All right, moving along. Valuations have the highest explanatory power over long-term 10-year returns. All this means uh R2 of R squar of relative forward PE versus subsequent return spread over various time horizons since 1985 Russell 2000 versus TH000. All you need to know is shortterm markets a voting machine based on emotion. Small caps are in the hole despite this this performance. Long-term it is a weighing machine based on fundamentals. price catches up to fundamentals, whether it was Exxon at $33 during COVID or Wells Fargo at 25 or Rolls-Royce at a buck 50 and on and on or you know on and on. Vornado I if your framework is correct all you're doing is playing the time arbitrage game. That is our edge. the time, the patience, and the low leverage so we can wait until the fundamentals rather the price catches up with the fundamentals. We benefit from the short-term emotional voting machine and we cash in on the long-term fundamental weighing machine. All right. performance of the S&P and tariff exposed stocks after the major tariff announcements liberation day. Okay, that's just most borrowers have mortgage rates well below current rates leaving them with a large financial disincentive to move. We expect existing home sales to rebound modestly over the next couple years. Uh Trump is toying with an idea of eliminating capital gains on house sales. If that doesn't motivate people to do it before he gets out of office, nothing will. Uh I think it's a brilliant idea and no one else would think of that. That that is just that could be huge. More shelter disinflation likely in the pipeline. That's good news for inflation. Russell 2000 net speculators uh net position record lows here. That's when you want to be a buyer. XLE looking like it wants to potentially break out and move. We think that's going to be the case. Uh but we want to be careful not to be too exposed to the commodity price. If drill baby drill comes to pass with lower interest rates, then we want the toll takers in which case and we don't like midstream. That's kind of just a dead dead money for yield play. Uh we like the servicesers like National Oil. Well, Varco uh services companies foreign purchases of both US stocks and bonds surged in May. Analysts see no profit downturn. Okay, yellow light. Uh retail activity as percent of overall market shares traded edging up. That's normal. We also had that by the way that's natural. You had that a after the lows in June of 2020. And this reminds me of so much of that period because the market moves so big off the March lows, which by the way we called on March 19th in marketwatch.com. Go to the website, you can find it anyway. Um but um I remember everyone saying we're overbought. We're going to go back and retest blah blah blah. This is not resolved. We don't have a vaccine. Blah blah blah. And we just held pat and made that was just such an incredible year. Um and um so now we're there and people are saying the same thing. It didn't get we should watch this because this this was the this was more the the peak even after you peaked you had another 12 months until the beginning of 2022. So we're early days not late days is what that one data point would imply. NASDAQ composite present index to 100. So again, this implies, yeah, huge move, but these huge moves tend to continue to resolve higher. So keep that in mind. Um, people are still underweight. Look at the percentage uh that who say they're overweight equities. It's not what you get at highs. Highs are up here, up here, up here, up here. I mean, God, you know, the reason I'm so animated about this is I can't imagine how screwed all these managers are and how dramatic they're going to have to buy on margin to potentially keep their jobs. And at this point, they've got nothing to lose. Some of these guys are 30 points behind the benchmark. So, they got to lever up and throw the Hail Mary and pray that the ball lands by December 31st or they're going to be, you know, uh, your next Top Chef is really what it comes down to. Or, uh, taking you around in an Uber. FMS investors taking higher than normal risk levels. We're not there yet. We're starting to get there. We're not there yet. Uh, vehicle affordability is coming down. This is constructive for volumes. Here is this uh, Alibaba Group chart. It's now back up to this level and breaking through. This is a long cup and handle yada yada yada measure move 60 to uh to 120 implies 180 next move. And then I've seen all these other silly charts at 220 and it'll it'll get there. It'll get there. So uh one-year change in metro level home prices between June and July. Uh this this tends to be the leading indicator. It's called Florida. And uh we're going to start to see some softening here uh that we've been talking about in prices and more affordability. That's going to be a positive thing as supply comes on as rates come down. Only MAG 7 earnings have rebounded. The rest are starting to rebound. We know that trajectory into 2025 2026 rather 2027 data centers as a percentage of US power demand continue to go up. The only thing is I had a really smart guy start to talk to me about photonic chips. and um they're going to require a ton less data center and a ton less uh energy. It's it's years out, but um that's something. And by the way, um let's just say we're excited about that. Move, move along. Uh SNP 500 cycle composite for 2025. Uh, okay. So, this implies from Ned Davis research that, you know, we're kind of at the peakish and then we consolidate sideways and and this the beauty of this is if this is correct, which it may or may not be. My inclination is we probably do have a little more. We definitely have a lot more under the surface. Maybe the indices look like this because this is basically a MAG 7 chart. Um, if you're spending a lot of money buying puts or getting short here, you lose 100% of your premium because this is you're not going to get the pullback. Your recency bias is where you're screwed. You're thinking, "Oh, we just had a 20% or 25% correction, whatever it was. Uh, we're going to get another big correction." Uh, ain't going to happen. Okay. We've had three of them in uh 2022, 2024. I'm sorry. 2020, 2022, now 2025. You usually get three. You get one of those every 4.1 years. We've now pulled three into four years. Uh you're not going to get that. You might get five or 10%, but that's not going to be enough to make the options pay out. So, suck it up, buttercup. Get off leverage or any material leverage and uh just ride out the volatility and it'll res revolve higher by the end of the year. Go on a cruise for the next three months. Okay. Uh, utilities versus NASDAQ by decade. That's not useful right now. Um, here's showing corporate insider sell to buy ratio has no indicative power selling. They sell for a multitude of reasons. They buy for only one unless you see excessive stuff like we've talked about some names, but um this this example shows rally continued for another year and change, another six months and change, another few months and change. So, we're not even at the level yet. And then you probably have another few months, which again, I think I think this is going to it this could surprise people up to October, which would be atypical to have any level of um continued stability through August and September. Usually, you'd get instability in August and September. So, we'll see. Maybe it'll be the function of the shadow Fed or the Fed actually doing the right thing. But um all right, again here is tech and Xtech again extreme. That's where you want to be is where the puck is going, not where it is in the rear view mirror. Five biggest stocks. Boy, we we got a ton this magnif. Okay, other 493. So again, this is your trajectory. Mag 7 decelerates, drops off the cliff, uh then stabilizes unmagnificent 493 catches up. Median wage growth is declining. It's good for inflation. Corporate profits, oil and gas stocks most likely to have bullish ratings. Southbound outflows, huge flows into Hong Kong, healthc care. Again, this is that consensus forward 12-month PE valuation versus history. There's a lot of ponies in that pile, guys and gals. Sellers earning sentiment money market fund assets as a percentage of S&P 500 uh market cap. Okay. Coalesi letter. What is this dat posting? Labor market continues to weaken. That we know Fed's got to move. It's going to be too late. Powell, get on it. uh just announced the shadow Fed. This guy's not going to do it. He's got to stick up his butt. I mean, um consumer attitudes about jobs. Market still weak. Like to see that. Uh percent of S&P 500 stocks in a bare market. Trending down, but not at an extreme that you would see, you know, before bad things happen. S&P earnings beat rate 85% surprise 7.6%. Medicaid exposed insurers have been crushed. I think there's a pony in that pile. Uh Prime Book is getting a little stretched. So there's that. Record bearishness. Percent of publicly traded companies experiencing net buying from corporate officers and directors. So, keeping an eye on that. So, you know, you got to take all of these and and probabilistically bet. And it's, you know, it's complicated, which which, you know, it's like when you can't read the break on a putt, you just go back of the cup, straight down the middle. And that's kind of, I think, where we are. I I don't think it's going to break up huge. And I don't think it's going to break down huge for the next few months. I think it's going to be sideways chop. So just put it in the back of the cup and uh and benefit from from being in the lagards that these managers are forced to buy. Small cap underperformance relative to large cap has been his greatest in history. Uh small caps represent the greatest US market opportunity. Uh which is uh from Seth Golden. We agree that's interesting. Cap weighted. So like worst case scenario I see would be a retest of this before pushing higher. Equal weighted again that this this shows under the surface just breaking out. Again a lot of great de data this week. Good work on that Jeff. Uh China defends growth model plans consumption it greater driver. Alibaba the toll taker markets bet Beijing is getting serious about China's over capacity.

Each week we cover one to two companies we previously discussed in podcast for own clients including personally. So what you what do you see here? You see a divergence. Record cash flows. Prices come down a lot. uh short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine will catch up to those great fundamentals which are going to get better because they no longer have the drag of the fiber business. Uh with a portfolio of 40,000 cell towers across the US, US Crown Castle is the nation's largest provider of shared communications infrastructure. Number one thing to know with CCI is that like all REITs, it trades on interest rates. When the 10-year yield falls, REITs tend to benefit and CCI is no exception. You can see the overlay here. Whether it's the removal of supplementary leverage ratio or the genius act and stable coin catalyst potentially creating two trillion of treasury demand and setting up an operation twist type scenario. We've been making the case lower 10 yield for quite some time. This view is central to our thesis that dividend cut remain dividend yield remains cheap and overlooked allowing us to add high quality dividend paying names that are at fire sale prices. Think CCI 3.85% 75% yield. Stanley Black & Decker 4.51. Baxter 2.5. Hormemell 4% and Dagio 4% to name a few. The point is these dividend players have been ignored and left for dead over the past few years. But that won't be the case for much longer. Once the Fed wakes up and starts cutting, they'll be in high demand in short order. Dividend yield exp inexpensive, most inexpensive since 2001. Dividend yield neglected by managers. They will be chasing like you're seeing them chase off the April lows. What you will immediately see is that a good chunk of the 7.4 trillion sitting on the sidelines in money markets earning over 4% yields will suddenly be forced into find yield elsewhere. At that point, investors will be tripping over themselves to get dividend exposure and we'll be more than happy to help them out. Sold to you. That's but that's tomorrow's newspaper today. Until then, we're happy to sit on our hands and wait as CCI and the rest of the high-quality businesses continue to execute accordingly. That brings us to CCI's Q2 results. This was another lights out quarter for CCI beating both top and bottom line expectations and raising fullear guidance. The sale of the capital intensive fiber business remains on track to close in the first half of 2026, leaving CCI as a higher margin, leaner business, and the only publicly traded pure play US tower company out there. The next big catalyst will be the announcement of new CEO. Second time's a charm. And in the meantime, you know, buy a business that's so great a ham sandwich could run it because one day they will. CCI is a perfect example. And in the meantime, just get a beating heart. This business is so good it'll work with or without a good CEO. Uh the business continues to hum along with organic growth rates accelerating to 4.7%. The sprint churn overhang largely gone by the end of 2025 and secular trends in the mobile data consumption and 5G driving annual wireless data demand growth of 20 to 30%. Here's everything you need to know following two Q2 earnings. You see it all highlighted. Let's go to the top 10 points. Number one, management raised full year 2025 guidance increasing site rental revenues by 10 million, adjusted Ebida by 25 million and AFO by 35 million in the updated outlook. Two, higher leasing activity drove organic revenue to 4.7% adjusted for the 51 million impact on sprint cancellations. Management continues to expect even stronger leasing activity in the second half of the year. Three, I feel sorry for those of you who are listening to me on 1.5 times speed. Good luck. The 8.5 billion sale of the capital intensive small sales and fiber solutions business remains on track to close the in the first half of 2026 with CCI already securing state level approvals. Once completed, Crown Castle will become the only publicly traded pure play tower company focused exclusively on the US. Four, capital allocation priorities following the fiber sale still remain unchanged. Reducing $6 billion of debt is the top priority. Any remaining cash flow will be directed toward the share repurchases. After the sale, management expects to grow the dividend in line with AFO while maintaining a payout ratio between 75 to 80%. management remains confident in the roll out of 5G networks, noting that the previous 4G deployment cycle lasted 10 to 12 years and that the 5G cycle is still expected to be even longer. Continued strength of incremental mobile data data demand. Carriers continue to report strong results with overall traffic increasing, subscribers growing, churn r and churn rising, all of which typically lead to higher investment activity and wireless networks to keep up with incremental demand. Seven, uh, service gross margins continue to improve with management and raising the full year expectations. 275 to 105 million, an increase of five million from the pre previous outlook. They expect gains to be made over the last six to 12 months to be structural and sustainable going forward. The board is actively searching for a new CEO with a decision expected before the fiber business deal closes. Management remains committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet with approximately 86% of debt at fixed rate weighted average debt maturity over six years and 4.7 billion of availability under a revolving credit facility. Sprint related churn is expected to be largely behind CCI at the end of 2025 with management reiterating long-term churn expectations of just 1 to 2%. So read through the uh earnings call here. Albamaro update. Okay. By the way, huge move from 49 to about 80 this week in just a few weeks. Uh our timing on uh the media stuff couldn't have been more perfect. Uh Albamaro is the world's low. But but here's the key. Just getting started. Albamaro is the world's lowest and largest and lowest cost lithium producer. The stock has been on a tear over the past month or so, up close to 40% as lithium prices continue to rebound off multi-year lows. A big part of the story is what's happening in China. Over the past couple of weeks, the Chinese government launched a campaign focused on anti-involution, a push against self-destructive price wars and excess competition. This move is part of a broader effect to address chronic overcapacity across many sectors and the resulting deflationary pressures. To the benefit of Albamaro shareholders and the overall lithium market, China has already begun implementing the plan. Just last week, Chinese regulators ordered the closure of Zangi, a major domestic lithium miner with 11,000 tons of lithium capacity. This is welcome news for Albamaro as one of the major drivers of the ongoing supply glut was the flood of smallcale producers in China. many fully subsidized chasing record high lithium prices we saw in 2022. As expected, the longer prices remain in the pain zone, the more low lower quality marginal producers will get taken out on a stretcher. Albamaro Management estimated in their last earnings call that about 45 40% of current lithium capacity is at or below break even with only around one-third of that supply having come offline so far. If China is serious about curbing over capacity, it's going to be a busy season for stretchers. Okay. Uh and not only are the subsidized player in China getting taken out on stretchers, but so are the geniuses who shorted Albamaro in the hole back in May. Of the approximately 117.7 million shares outstanding, nearly 20% were short. morons. The short interest has fallen to 16% setting up even more pain ahead. Keep in mind, despite the past couple of weeks feeling like a big move in Albamar, the most exciting part is the train hasn't even left the station. This is nearly 40 this nearly 40% rally has come off just a 15% rebound in lithium prices off the recent lows to 9,800 per metric ton. Just wait until the operating wait until the operating leverage really kicks in when prices climb back up to 15,000 to 20,000 per metric ton range. At that point, we'll be smiling so wide we could eat a banana sideways or two. Uh, and Albamaro will be minting more cash than they know what to do with. Zoom out and the big move in lithium can hardly be seen. This thing is just getting started. Lithium supply and demand imbalance. It's coming into balance. Fear and greed. Yeah, a little froth there. National Association of Active Investment Managers confused just since they were selling at the lows. They don't know what to do uh now that we've moved up. All opinion, not advice. Uh earnings ARC uh Kathy Wood ETF top 30 weights earnings estimates down 2.5% for this year, 1.15 for next year. Uh and then oil and gas slaughtered down by 16% for this year in the last 60 days and 16.7. That's why we want to get involved. I think we're completely flushed expectations. Uh there is one if you look here what what are the couple of names that have actually had earnings estimates go up while the sector is down 16%. And one of those names is right at the top of the list. It's called National Oil Well Varco NOV Inc. Uh which we covered in detail last week. So, uh, economic data, I think all that really matters is what the Fed does next week. All the rest of this is noise, building permits low. Obviously, they can't take that risk with uh uh rates where they are. Fed is just gumming up the system and we're biting time until they wake the hell up or Trump announces his pick and the shadow Fed kicks in. Uh, 83% of companies have beat so far. Growth rate is 4.6. That's above 4 5.6 above 4.8 and I think it's going to move even higher. Ask me anything questions. Let's rock and roll. Uh first one GPN we've covered. Not for me. I know Elliot's involved. We like PayPal. All right, we're going to get through these quick today. I don't have another hour to do this. Uh, Phillip, how do you establish your fair value on CCI in their transformative journey? A lot higher. Moving along. Uh, clients will know when we've hit fair value when they get a notification in their interactive brokers account. Salem made. We're not anywhere near yet. Jo Greenblat, I hope you're doing well. Keep up the great work. Um, all of your names are flying. Big moves haven't even started. Uh, hoping to get your thought on Bayex Energy. Okay, BTE. Cash flow is recovering. Revenues haven't started to recover. Margins are recovering. Let's take a look at the these guys do crude natural gas. Oh, so this is EMP. So you're going to be at the effective prices with this. Um, but let me take a look. Yeah, I'd want to see their credit line. They got a huge amount of receivables for some reason that aren't getting paid. Um, $1.5 billion of debt. So, I would go through their filings and understand their liquidity. I mean, 400 million of free cash flow last year is pretty significant. Um, [Music] don't love that they've added 300 million shares. I really Maybe they did an acquisition. find out if this is just this is probably acquisitions, but you're issuing stock down here. I hate management that does that. You buy stock down here, you don't issue it down there. Um, I don't like what they did to the share count. I mean, it's, you know, it's up from 350 million to 800 million in six years. I really hate managers like this. I'm not I mean I'm I'm gonna be straightforward. I gotta say though I think there's a margin of safety and I think the timing is right. So I want to know you got to do solvencancy analysis. What availability do they have in terms of credit? Uh what's the sustainability? Why were all those shares issued? Was it for dumb acquisition? Giving away stock at a low price or they just giving themselves a ton of uh stock or they using it to raise capital. find out why they're such disrespectful pigs when it comes to equity. Uh, and if you can get comfortable with that, then maybe it's a buy. But, uh, they're higher and better uses, but I think you're on the right track with this one despite the hair. So, um, okay. Yeah, that's Dylan did that awesome pick. JT, hope you're not stuck in an air. Take a quick look at BTU. Yeah, you're probably fine with Peabody. I mean, I don't know. Cash flow is going down though. like might already be priced in. I think there are higher and better uses. What is this? Is um coal coal business. I I don't think you need to go that far down. And I and it's I think you got an upside of, you know, maybe a double. I uh it's not my favorite. I'm going to pass on that one. It It's not bad. I think you'll make money if you buy it here and hold it for 6 months, but um it's not all right. Uh okay, that's Andrew coming in. Um Diego Palace BTE. Uh we just did that one. So, thank you for that, Diego. I guess that must be making the rounds on social media because getting the same questions. Uh thoughts on human. This is one that is on our target for healthcare exposure. We are not making decisions. We got to just unpacking this impact to Medicaid cuts is like a pain in the ass, but my guess is it's overshot. Um but I got to be certain before I get super comfy lemonade. This is the automated uh insurance company. Maybe they're finally there. Let's take a look. Still not cash flow positive. Revenues keep going up. Margins recovering. What are they doing on, by the way, is this a is this a carrier or just a agent? Because I think agents are done in the next 10 years. um provides various insurance except for the really high-end bespoke stuff renters and homeowners actually agent for other insurance companies. Ah I think it's going to be me too. I mean, they're the innovator in this space. So, I just it's not cash flow positive. So, for me, it's like not that interesting. These are like guesses on the future type of companies. And in that case, I I understand what you're doing and I think you're right, but it's outside of I got to make a leap into the future of who's going to be the winner of a new technology, and I'm not really willing to do that. Um, okay. So, these are all people asking to invest. Unfortunately, we closed out for smaller accounts. So, if you're 5 million plus, call me today. We'll get you in. If you're 1 to 5 million, you got to wait till October 1st. Uh Gasper Moharic, what is the price of EuroUSD a year from now? No effing idea, but Euro will be higher. Thank you for the question, Jeffrey. That's another inquiry. Daniel Borman. Uh, yeah. Okay. Thank you. We covered that with the capital gains. Alex Claris Corp. Uh, I know the chairman too well. I'm not going to comment on this one. Lee Foster, potential breakup of Craft Hind bullish. Alex B covered that. ClariS Mike Dan Kagra Brands. That's Dan D. Yeah, they're just revenues are just showing no sign of recovery nor their margins. But how much of that is priced in for a company that owns some of the greatest brands known to man? I mean, the thing about this is like even if you do a great job, maybe you make 75 80% and you're gonna have to wait a while because this is still breaking down. Um, Bird's Eye, Merry Calendars, Duncan Hind, Healthy Choice, Slim Gym, Ready Whip, Angie's. Yeah, I don't I don't love these brands. I just let me just get you a financial answer because I I don't really like this one. I've looked at it. I think you're going to be right. I think it's going to be okay, but I think there are higher and better uses. And I do like your thinking on it. Um I mean 1.6 billion of free cash. Not too shabby. It's a lot of debt on on those kind of brands. I I just don't think the upside is warrants the risk even though the price may move in the short term. Gleb tidewater we covered last week. We prefer national oil. This is another social media stock TDDW I think. I mean, anyone that could destroy that much value that quickly, I'm not a fan. I I I You're probably right. I I just would rather a sure sleep at night bet like Varco where I can make a triple or quadruple versus something like that where you're hoping for a 10 bag if management doesn't completely screw you like they have in the past. It's like, "Oh, I don't expect the scorpion's going to bite my back again." Well, shame on you. That's what scorpions do. Um, uh, Charlie's asking about reweing and all that stuff. That's for clients. I would just say that you sell a company when it's reached your fair value. You don't I mean, if it becomes insanely overweight in the portfolio and it's fra frothy and near fair value that you decided before you got in where you were going to get out, then you can trim. But generally, let it run to fair value and then just get out. Um, your podcast um, been listening to your podcast since 2020. You helped me navigate my first internship on Bay Street in Toronto during my senior year. I most definitely continue to use your advice along it's opinion not advice along with the knowledge and pass along to your listeners and eventually have enough capital to give you to manage money for my family. Once again want to thank you for all your hard work. We appreciate your thoughts on white cap resources. Okay, these Canadians love their resource plays cap. It's like in your DNA. You guys cannot live without commodity stocks. It's just like it's like oxygen for you people, which now that now is a good time. So, uh I'm not knocking you. WCP, I mean, it's it's just breaking out like where the time to be asking me this question was in 2020 when it was a buck, not at 2025 when it's at 10. Um free cash flow is actually declining and it's at new time highs. So, I'm going to say pass on this one, Joe. There are better opportunities. Yes, it's breaking out. It might continue, blah blah blah, but I think there are better opportunities right now. Uh, let's see. Lewis here from Nottingham. Lewis here from Nottingham in the UK. been following you on the podcast now for about six months. If I'm honest, I wasn't your biggest fan at first as a new investor. I was heavily invested in shiny things, a lot of Mag 7, and I'd hear your views each day on socials, which were generally negative for all my investments. That said, I dip my toe in the water on CPS and obviously got a double bagger, which was great. I'm now invested most of your picks and I've seen great short-term returns. QXO, Generrack, Albamaro, Estee Lauder. Hopefully, this is just the start of the ride as I made for the long term. Number one, do your own work. Uh, glad you have had that positive experience, but do not be buying it because I buy it or talk about it. You buy it because you've done your own work and you've come to the similar conclusions or don't buy it because you came to different conclusions. Self- responsibility. Uh, but interested, however, in your views on Grab Holdings. Um, I'm putting all my UK mates on to you. So, you're getting good traction from across the pond. Fingers crossed. maybe in a position to become a client next year. Very awesome. Thank you for all of that. Let's take a look at Grab. And that's the way it goes. Pay it forward. Share it with people you love. And we'll keep delivering the value. Okay. Turning positive free cash flow. Margins going up. What's the balance sheet look like? I generally, by the way, I do not like the food delivery business, but this one also has financial services, etc. Um, [Music] wait a second. This has a 21 billion market cap on 23. All right. So, it's one of these 10 time sales stories. And the problem is the revenue. Obviously, they got the COVID boost and now the revenue is like starting to recover. But you to justify 10 times sales, you really need a super growth rate and it's just not occurring here. Uh I think on a trading, if I had to look at it on a trading basis, maybe you get a double. I just don't think that the business is justifying um where it is now, never mind a lot more, even though it's probably going to go there on a trading basis. So let's see if we got any other stuff that we haven't covered. No, that's going all the way back. A lowest July 12th. Adam, Elevance Healthcare. I don't understand this one enough, but we're looking at it. This still looks like a falling knife to me. This is probably hit by medic Medicaid cuts. I'd hold off on this one for now. I I think you're going to have time to buy it. We'll we'll revisit that one in coming weeks. Marco Deckers. Um, we covered this. I'd rather riskreward. I like betting on Bracken. I don't think it's come down enough to be interesting to me. Um, it's had a run already. That's yesterday's nude news rear view mirror. Brad Tomlinson, it's a REIT. uh you got to know the properties. This one we we've covered this one before. I don't know the properties. You really have to underwrite each of the properties in their portfolio and um and then the balance sheet, right? You know, it's it's trading down because they're, you know, they're going bankrupt and you have to come up with a case. No, they're not going bankrupt because the asset value, the vacancy rate, all those other things. I could only do that with Bernado because I know the buildings. So, uh not not for me. Even though it'll pro, you know, I I I think like buying office now in aggregate, home run. I'm probably late. We were pounding the table telling all of our real estate clients if you like if you're in real estate like buy offices like crazy a year and a half ago and now that they've just moved huge. So, um, but that's not what we do. So, we stay in our lane. All right. So Matt wants to know if we're looking for shorts. Uh no, no, we're just going to buy it our time. This is going to be a sideways chop if anything and uh not a big correction of 20%. So I think it's just a bad use of mental energy and capital. I think you just sit tight on low leverage, ride it out, and finish the year with a smile so wide you could eat two bananas sideways. Regarding management, this is from unknown. Regarding management claims and forecast, how do you gauge when to trust this fully? To what degree turnaround situations with new management? I look at their track record. I only bet on winners. So, um or if it's such a great business that a loser could run it. But, um that that's really the most important thing. Have have they done what they said they were going to do in the past? And if so, I'll give them the benefit of the doubt until the numbers don't prove it out. So, with that said, I want to thank everyone for tuning in. We'll be back next week, same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music]
