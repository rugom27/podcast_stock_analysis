[00:00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:00:02] Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:00:05] 3001st podcast video cast for the week
[00:00:07] ending July 24th, 2025. A lot to cover
[00:00:11] today, but as always, family first. A
[00:00:14] couple photos here uh with John, Craig,
[00:00:18] Caitlyn, my beautiful wife, uh Craig's
[00:00:21] wife, Sue, and Chris over at a
[00:00:24] restaurant, Crystal Cove. We had an
[00:00:25] incredible time talking life, talking
[00:00:28] business, talking all types of ideas.
[00:00:30] And uh huge shout out to Sue and Craig
[00:00:34] Bridgeman who are in from Dubai. Sue
[00:00:37] just launched her new book which is
[00:00:40] called the CQ Edge. It's all about
[00:00:44] communication. She's going to be at on
[00:00:47] Mornings with Maria on Fox Business. So
[00:00:50] you can find out all about Sue here. Um,
[00:00:54] then I want to congratulate my friend
[00:00:55] Andrew Keys who just launched the Ether
[00:00:59] machine for all of you crypto nuts that
[00:01:01] love crypto. Uh, they're going public
[00:01:03] with over $1.5 billion of fully
[00:01:07] committed capital. Part of that he's
[00:01:09] contributing uh portion of his personal
[00:01:12] Ether holdings. He's contributing 650
[00:01:15] million uh of his own Ethereum into it.
[00:01:19] They're going to do staking, restaking,
[00:01:21] so it has yield uh and maybe something
[00:01:24] like the micro strategy of Ether, but uh
[00:01:28] I'm slandering it because I have zero
[00:01:30] competence or expertise in this area. I
[00:01:32] know a lot of you do. All of his details
[00:01:34] are at the ethermachine.com.
[00:01:38] Uh and he explains it for people who
[00:01:40] have an interest and an ability. I think
[00:01:43] the the huge cha takeaway uh was when he
[00:01:46] was on CNBC and they said why do you own
[00:01:49] Ethereum and not Bitcoin Bitcoin
[00:01:53] and he said why would I buy a landline
[00:01:56] when I could buy an iPhone and uh if you
[00:01:58] understand how he speaks about it and
[00:02:00] look up some of his media it's pretty
[00:02:02] pretty interesting for those of you who
[00:02:03] have that competency but I stay in my
[00:02:05] lane uh and do what I do best. We buy
[00:02:08] hammers and shovels and airplanes and
[00:02:10] amusement parks and uh easy peasy stuff
[00:02:14] that I don't have to predict the future.
[00:02:15] So, um ah yeah, forgot the most
[00:02:19] important thing which is uh Junior
[00:02:21] Olympics going on. We used to have to
[00:02:23] fly from the east coast for this. Now
[00:02:25] it's right in our backyard. Both Mimi
[00:02:27] and Annabelle are playing their first
[00:02:28] games this morning. I'm going to be at
[00:02:30] probably 10 games uh over the weekend.
[00:02:33] But a couple quick highlights here.
[00:02:35] Here's uh Annabelle
[00:02:40] And then uh All right. So, right here
[00:02:44] gets down the field. Boom.
[00:02:48] [Music]
[00:02:50] Puts it away.
[00:02:52] All right. Very exciting. And then Mimi
[00:02:55] is doing incredible stuff. Look at this
[00:02:58] one.
[00:03:05] >> Boom.
[00:03:07] All right, couple more quick ones here
[00:03:09] and we'll get right down to it. But this
[00:03:11] is what we do. Family first, ladies and
[00:03:12] gentlemen.
[00:03:19] >> Here she goes down the side again.
[00:03:25] [Music]
[00:03:29] Skip shot
[00:03:31] and final.
[00:03:41] Watch this one timer. This is pretty
[00:03:43] awesome.
[00:03:47] Boom. How you doing? All right, here we
[00:03:50] go. Uh, thanks to my buddy who sends
[00:03:52] this over. Let's look at some charts
[00:03:53] here. Uh, we got a lot of great stuff.
[00:03:56] So, yeah, we broke out here. Everyone's
[00:03:58] like, everyone's looking here. Recency
[00:04:00] bias. Oh, it's gone too far too fast.
[00:04:02] I've been saying it tends to keep
[00:04:03] pushing higher. Look, we are running out
[00:04:05] of some gas. But what you're seeing
[00:04:07] under the surface, here's the theme,
[00:04:08] ladies and gentlemen. Pay close
[00:04:10] attention. Okay, small and short. Small
[00:04:15] and short. Okay, this is where money is
[00:04:20] starting to go because it's run out of
[00:04:22] things. managers caught offside since
[00:04:25] April, sold in the hole, chase up, have
[00:04:28] to buy the lagards that haven't worked,
[00:04:30] which is now the most shorted stocks,
[00:04:34] which are concentrated in midcap and
[00:04:36] small cap, and we're seeing all of our
[00:04:39] names just skyrocket this week. Um, just
[00:04:43] absolutely incredible the things that
[00:04:45] have been left behind. That theme is
[00:04:46] going to continue. So, even if this S&P
[00:04:51] comes back and checks back and scares
[00:04:53] the hell out of everyone who sold here
[00:04:55] and bought here and now we go back down
[00:04:57] or god forbid all the way back down to
[00:04:59] 6,000 to really get these guys screwed
[00:05:01] before going up to the next level. Um,
[00:05:05] so be it. Focus on what we've been
[00:05:08] telling you the whole time and um and
[00:05:10] you are now smiling so wide you could
[00:05:12] eat a banana sideways. There's no
[00:05:14] question about it. uh which means we
[00:05:16] probably get some volatility in the next
[00:05:17] couple of weeks. So uh chillax uh we
[00:05:22] went through by the way in episode 300
[00:05:24] and again thank you so much uh all the
[00:05:26] loyal viewers making this thing go and
[00:05:28] it's going to keep going and it keeps
[00:05:29] growing. It's super exciting delivering
[00:05:32] a lot of value. Um, we went through, you
[00:05:37] know, 30 something, I don't know, 15 or
[00:05:39] 30 names that we've discussed on the
[00:05:40] podcast, some some owned uh by us and
[00:05:43] clients, etc., and basically saying,
[00:05:46] yeah, the market's moved a long way in a
[00:05:47] short period of time, but these names
[00:05:48] haven't even gotten started. And this
[00:05:50] week, a lot of them were just like
[00:05:52] galloping. I mean, like we've never seen
[00:05:54] before. So, go back to the first part of
[00:05:57] that, and we're not going to go through
[00:05:58] all the names again, uh, and just see
[00:06:00] what we're talking about there. So,
[00:06:02] there's equal weight. It hasn't even
[00:06:03] broken out yet. This is where the
[00:06:05] lagards are. Look at small caps. This is
[00:06:08] I mean these are the most powerful
[00:06:11] patterns for those of you who care about
[00:06:12] technicals. I don't but I pay attention
[00:06:15] to it. The the the longer these things
[00:06:18] go sideways when they break out it is so
[00:06:20] monster. This is small cap index. This
[00:06:23] is where you're going to get your value.
[00:06:24] Yeah, it's had a huge run in the last
[00:06:26] few weeks. It's just beginning. When
[00:06:28] this thing breaks out, it's going to go
[00:06:29] for years. This is going to be like 2001
[00:06:32] to 2006 for small caps. So, pay
[00:06:35] attention. We have our exposure. You
[00:06:37] know where where that is and we're
[00:06:39] pretty excited. Here's um Europe XUK.
[00:06:45] Um and
[00:06:49] so we got uh
[00:06:53] All right. Uh then we got Hang Sang.
[00:06:57] This is amazing. Talk about a choppy
[00:06:59] uptrend, but it's holding that and now
[00:07:01] looks like it's ready to break out to
[00:07:03] the next level before we start to work
[00:07:05] our way to new highs. That is exciting.
[00:07:08] We're starting to see it in uh Baba this
[00:07:10] week again, which is pretty cool. I
[00:07:12] could tell we were at a turning point at
[00:07:14] 105 when everyone was just puking, oh,
[00:07:16] it's not doing anything, blah, blah,
[00:07:18] blah. And we were just buying. It was so
[00:07:20] beautiful because we got so much new
[00:07:22] money in uh and we were able to buy
[00:07:27] Baba as a new position for the first
[00:07:29] time in a long time. Uh because it had
[00:07:31] shot up, you know, bas blended basis
[00:07:35] $82. It had shot up to 148. Uh and we're
[00:07:38] not we weren't going to put new money in
[00:07:40] after, you know, more than doubled. um
[00:07:44] uh and now it pulled back and now it's
[00:07:46] now it's moving back up into the 120s
[00:07:48] before its next final move. This will be
[00:07:50] the most skeptical move of the entire
[00:07:52] time and uh everyone will think it's
[00:07:55] going to top at $148 again and it's
[00:07:57] going to just blow right through it and
[00:07:58] people are going to go, "Oh no, oh no."
[00:08:00] And then all these people who sold at
[00:08:02] $60, who sold at $105 will be buying
[00:08:06] over $200. Uh and um look at this look
[00:08:10] at this setup.
[00:08:12] I mean, it doesn't get any clearer than
[00:08:15] that. I mean, the measured move, you
[00:08:17] start to look at uh 1960 to 25, that's a
[00:08:21] 25% move. So, Baba probably gets 30, 40,
[00:08:24] 50%. And then it goes look look at look
[00:08:27] at my buddy Brendan's Kb ETF,
[00:08:31] this sideways channel for three years.
[00:08:35] This thing is going to absolutely
[00:08:37] skyrocket. Uh Tokyo could care less. uh
[00:08:41] 30-year 10-year yields. So, another fake
[00:08:44] out move back lower. Here we go, ladies
[00:08:46] and gentlemen. Dollar counter trend
[00:08:48] bounce will resume downtrend over time.
[00:08:51] Euro, no one would have predicted this
[00:08:53] except for the incredible viewers of
[00:08:56] Headphone Tips with Tom Hayes. Way to
[00:08:58] go. And all my skeptical Canadians, I
[00:09:01] said, have faith. Here was the
[00:09:03] overthrow. Everyone got nervous. Now
[00:09:06] you've broken through the downtrend. and
[00:09:07] you're retesting and you're going to
[00:09:09] continue to push higher over time. Um,
[00:09:13] energy just in this range. Uh, gold, uh,
[00:09:17] you know, couldn't get enough here.
[00:09:19] Hasn't done anything. We'll see what
[00:09:20] happens with that. I wouldn't be a
[00:09:21] buyer, but that's not what I do. I could
[00:09:23] care less. Copper, PhD in economics is
[00:09:27] showing you what China economy is
[00:09:29] recovering. Global economy is
[00:09:31] recovering, just breaking out right now.
[00:09:34] Um, and then you look at
[00:09:38] uh
[00:09:40] some names. I thought there was one that
[00:09:44] was pretty pretty interesting, which was
[00:09:52] Apple's been kind of dead money for a
[00:09:54] while here. Um,
[00:09:58] Duke Energy. Here we go. Crown Castle.
[00:10:01] uh
[00:10:04] long long downtrend. Broke out at 106.
[00:10:07] Uh now just reported earnings. Had a
[00:10:09] strong earnings call. I think it's up to
[00:10:10] like 115. This is just early days. Now
[00:10:13] it's now it's breaking out. Everyone's
[00:10:15] like, "Oh, what's your target price?
[00:10:16] None of your business. That's for my
[00:10:18] client's benefit." But a lot higher. Um
[00:10:22] let's see.
[00:10:25] These start to look interesting as we
[00:10:27] consider uh consolidation in the
[00:10:29] railroad space. Canadian Pacific. I want
[00:10:32] to get some exposure in transports. I
[00:10:34] don't know if it's uh if it's um UPS or
[00:10:38] or one of those, but uh Canadian Pacific
[00:10:41] is something I've got my eye on and I
[00:10:43] want to start to study the railroad
[00:10:45] sector a little bit more carefully. Uh
[00:10:48] here's some more stuff from my buddy
[00:10:50] over at RBC
[00:10:52] yields. Um what else? Homebuilder index.
[00:10:57] Here's a beautiful base. It's sitting
[00:11:00] here at resistance, grinding sideways.
[00:11:03] This is going to be the rate play. You
[00:11:04] look at weekly momentum, everything, and
[00:11:07] you're you're starting to see the things
[00:11:08] move ahead. Generrack is on a run.
[00:11:11] Stanley Black & Decker is on a run.
[00:11:13] Obviously, uh GXO with Brad Jacobs is on
[00:11:17] a run. Uh excuse me, not GXO. GXO is on
[00:11:19] a run. We own that. But QXO, the new
[00:11:22] building supply rollup. So, uh, pay
[00:11:25] close attention to this for a TEL. And
[00:11:29] what's in here? A lot of small caps and
[00:11:32] midcaps, which is consistent with what?
[00:11:34] Small and short, high short interest.
[00:11:38] It's very simple.
[00:11:40] Most managers
[00:11:42] caught sideways, still underweight,
[00:11:45] dramatically behind their benchmark,
[00:11:47] desperate to keep their jobs. They can't
[00:11:49] buy those things that have doubled off
[00:11:51] the lows. they got to buy those things
[00:11:53] that uh are lagging and those are high
[00:11:56] short interest smaller midcap stocks uh
[00:12:00] that haven't moved yet and and you're
[00:12:01] just seeing the short squeezes and the
[00:12:03] shorts it just goes so fast when they
[00:12:05] start to get squeezed uh obviously you
[00:12:08] saw the example of Kohl's and things
[00:12:09] like that but a lot in our portfol I
[00:12:12] mean look at advanced auto parts I mean
[00:12:14] I I can't tell you messages I was
[00:12:17] getting at 30 are are they going out of
[00:12:19] business now it's at what 70 or 80 bucks
[00:12:21] I I haven't looked at it today. Um and
[00:12:24] just getting started by the way. Uh here
[00:12:26] we go. Oil service index. This is where
[00:12:29] National Oil Well Varco, a new name we
[00:12:31] talked about last week. Uh here we go.
[00:12:33] Early days, ladies and gentlemen. Moving
[00:12:35] along. I got to move along today. This
[00:12:38] got to get done. Uh all right. So, let's
[00:12:42] look at some of the indicators because
[00:12:43] everyone says the market's overbought.
[00:12:44] We know the market's overbought. We know
[00:12:45] the market's frothy. We know we could
[00:12:47] get some consolidation. But when you
[00:12:49] look under the hood, the thing that's
[00:12:51] blowing my mind right now besides all
[00:12:53] these indicators, the Mlen being in kind
[00:12:55] of mid-range versus extended range is
[00:12:58] that uh even at Association of Active
[00:13:01] Investment Managers, they hate
[00:13:02] themselves because they sold in the
[00:13:04] hole, then they bought up and now
[00:13:05] they're skeptical that they've bought
[00:13:07] up, which means it's probably going to
[00:13:09] keep pushing it in their face. But look
[00:13:12] at this in terms of breath. Uh uh stocks
[00:13:14] on a PMO crossover buy signal. It's like
[00:13:17] a 5200 cross type of nonsense thing, but
[00:13:21] it gives you an indication that's down
[00:13:23] at zero, which tells me breath is is
[00:13:26] weak, which means there can be a lot of
[00:13:28] even if the indices stall, which they
[00:13:30] hopefully should. Um,
[00:13:34] under the surface, these there are a lot
[00:13:36] of names that can keep pushing higher uh
[00:13:39] even if mag 7 uh breathe. Same with Dow
[00:13:42] Jones. So we got the S PMO by all then
[00:13:46] PMO by Dow Jones. This is not what you
[00:13:49] see at super tops. This is what you see,
[00:13:54] you know, where breath expands and it's
[00:13:56] a sign of health in the market. Same
[00:13:58] with PMO by SPX. Again, you know, we're
[00:14:02] not like up here or up here. It's just
[00:14:07] um
[00:14:10] it's it's what I've been saying for two
[00:14:12] weeks. If you look at all the media like
[00:14:14] the four hours of media that I did last
[00:14:15] week um and I explained how during
[00:14:20] V-shaped recoveries and that's what made
[00:14:22] us so successful during COVID. It's when
[00:14:24] you come third 25 30% off the lows in a
[00:14:27] short period of time that overbought
[00:14:30] pushes because it it just so much money
[00:14:32] was wrongfooted that irrespective of the
[00:14:36] multiples or the fundamentals they they
[00:14:38] they are panic buying it it's like uh
[00:14:42] it's like throwing someone a bottle of
[00:14:44] water in the desert. They they got to
[00:14:46] buy anything that hasn't moved. So
[00:14:50] hail Mary hope they they've got nothing
[00:14:52] to lose. Hail Mary, hope and a prayer,
[00:14:54] they they can catch up and keep their
[00:14:56] jobs. So, um, everything x the heaviest
[00:15:00] weights now has to be bid by these
[00:15:03] people who got it wrong. Okay? And it's
[00:15:05] it's the majority of of managers got it
[00:15:07] wrong, not the people on hedge fund tips
[00:15:10] with Tom Hayes. You guys got it right. I
[00:15:12] keep getting these messages. This guy's
[00:15:14] like, "Oh, I made this and this and this
[00:15:16] and this and this and this." And I was
[00:15:18] like, and I'm looking at all his names.
[00:15:19] of like he didn't even get in them at
[00:15:21] the lows. Like he just got in them a few
[00:15:23] weeks ago. It's like oh my god. Um and
[00:15:26] he's happy. So there you go. This we're
[00:15:29] keeping an eye on. Okay. If this moves
[00:15:31] back up to, you know, 170 175, we may be
[00:15:37] at or near. This is when the smart money
[00:15:39] starts to buy insurance one standard
[00:15:41] deviation plus out of the money.
[00:15:45] um expecting like big big corrections
[00:15:48] 10% plus uh we're not there. This tends
[00:15:51] to climb a wall of worry. So again, I
[00:15:53] just try to be dispassionate uh unbiased
[00:15:56] look at the data and play the
[00:15:58] probabilities. And uh right now it tells
[00:16:01] me that the type of names we're in
[00:16:03] probably have a little bit more gas. And
[00:16:05] then you got this kind of ambiguity.
[00:16:08] This is not an extreme bullishness or
[00:16:10] bearishness. This is confusion.
[00:16:12] Confusion tends to be wall of worry
[00:16:14] climbing environment. Cox automotive
[00:16:17] report uh from Tuesday. Key highlights
[00:16:20] retail sal. Oh, by the way, I forgot to
[00:16:22] thank um uh Mark for having me over to
[00:16:25] NBCC and the reception. Had such an
[00:16:28] incredible day over there. No pictures
[00:16:30] for that one. Jesse, uh for having me
[00:16:34] over to your office and sharing sharing
[00:16:36] ideas. I really enjoyed that time. Thank
[00:16:38] you for that. All right. Uh, retail
[00:16:41] sales for new and used vehicles are
[00:16:42] rising in July, signaling renewed
[00:16:45] consumer momentum. Loan rates are easing
[00:16:48] from 25-year highs with low interest
[00:16:50] financing reaching levels last seen in
[00:16:52] mid 2022. Uh, dealer activity is up
[00:16:55] year-over-year on Autotrader and dealer
[00:16:57] track pointing to strong consumer
[00:16:59] engagement. Consumer spending rebounds.
[00:17:02] Um, June is now accelerated back to
[00:17:04] April levels. Weekly spending trends
[00:17:07] show renewed upward trajectory. Consumer
[00:17:10] sentiment index rode.7%
[00:17:13] in July after 3.6% dip in June. Retail
[00:17:16] sales strengthen. Uh new sales are
[00:17:19] trending higher compared. Why is all
[00:17:20] this important? Because we have a huge
[00:17:22] position in Cooper Standard from May of
[00:17:25] 2022 when we initiated at about $510.
[00:17:29] It's uh I think it got close to $25 this
[00:17:32] week. This thing is going a lot higher
[00:17:34] and the volumes haven't even begun yet.
[00:17:36] Now they're beginning and they're
[00:17:37] happening and we're we're pretty
[00:17:40] excited. Um Warren Buffett, price is
[00:17:42] what you pay, value is what you get,
[00:17:44] which is effectively the theme of hedge
[00:17:46] fund tips with Tom Hayes, not getting
[00:17:49] distracted by shiny objects. Uh Munger,
[00:17:52] our job is to find a few intelligent
[00:17:55] things to do, not keep up with every
[00:17:57] damn thing in the world. I mean, I talk
[00:18:00] to these geniuses in uh crypto space and
[00:18:04] technology encryption and all this
[00:18:05] stuff, and I'm like, listen, that's
[00:18:06] that's above my pay grade. I just buy
[00:18:08] hammers and airplanes and rubber ceiling
[00:18:11] stuff and uh generators and uh uh
[00:18:15] things, you know, roofing roofing
[00:18:16] supplies and things I could totally
[00:18:18] understand with predictable cash flows.
[00:18:20] I don't have to be a genius. Uh and I we
[00:18:23] could just make doubles and triples
[00:18:24] every few years, rinse, repeat, uh and
[00:18:27] sleep like a baby at night. So, uh,
[00:18:29] we'll do that. We'll we'll leave the
[00:18:31] we'll leave the hardlifting to the super
[00:18:33] smart people. Let them make their 100
[00:18:34] baggers in their businesses and then
[00:18:36] when they cash out, they can give me 20
[00:18:39] 30% of it. I'll run it for them. They
[00:18:41] can sleep like a baby and uh and and uh
[00:18:44] everyone's happy. Another awesome
[00:18:46] picture from a guy from Dylan C who's
[00:18:49] wearing his uh hedge fund tips polo out
[00:18:53] to the Hamptons this summer right before
[00:18:55] he starts his investment banking job
[00:18:58] straight out of college. Uh thanks so
[00:19:01] much for sending that in. Dylan, you are

[00:19:06] you who want to get up on the website,

[00:19:22] community. Get your pictures in. Let's
[00:19:24] put them up and uh show how awesome you
[00:19:27] are. Move moving along here to uh pod
[00:19:32] chart information. Let's go to lithium
[00:19:35] on the mend. We're going to cover that
[00:19:37] in the weekly article. That's a big
[00:19:39] deal. Um, as you've seen with Albamaro,
[00:19:43] couldn't give it away a few weeks ago in
[00:19:46] the ' 50s, now uh in the 80s. So, uh,
[00:19:52] it's just it's it's a real fun time. I
[00:19:55] got to be honest with you. Global
[00:19:56] equities breath is improving. This was
[00:19:59] consistent with our theme. Here is the
[00:20:01] healthc care select sector versus the
[00:20:03] S&P 500. And I look at Baxter and I just
[00:20:08] continue. You know, this is very similar
[00:20:10] to uh Comtock Resources. We've had a
[00:20:13] huge run in it, but that was our only
[00:20:14] energy exposure and rightly so. And
[00:20:17] we're just like, God, we're going to
[00:20:18] need more exposure in energy. And we
[00:20:22] laid out national oil. Well, Varco, I
[00:20:25] god, this is this again is a once in
[00:20:27] a-lifetime opportunity here. Healthc
[00:20:29] care relative to the S&P going all the
[00:20:31] way back to 2000. I really want more
[00:20:34] exposure than just one name. So, we're
[00:20:36] working on a bunch. But in fairness,
[00:20:38] actually I I don't lose sleep at night
[00:20:40] cuz we have the biotech basket which is
[00:20:43] going to take off as this takes off and
[00:20:45] we have that. But there is a lot of
[00:20:48] opportunity in healthcare. If you've
[00:20:49] missed everything and uh you you know
[00:20:52] you're just joining us recently and
[00:20:54] haven't benefited from all all the stuff
[00:20:56] we've been talking about in this huge
[00:20:58] huge huge run
[00:21:00] uh since the beginning of the year by
[00:21:02] the way. I mean, we've we we've not just
[00:21:05] the last few months. Um,
[00:21:08] healthcare would be where I'd start to
[00:21:09] pay attention. Healthcare and small
[00:21:10] caps. China's made a huge contribution
[00:21:13] to global money supply, which is a huge
[00:21:16] driver. Flows into emerging market
[00:21:18] equity funds in the past two years,
[00:21:20] going parabolic. How you doing? No one
[00:21:23] expected except for you, the incredible
[00:21:26] supporters of Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:21:29] Hayes.
[00:21:32] Moving along. By the way, I just want to
[00:21:35] thank you guys because I I know not
[00:21:38] everyone can be afford to become
[00:21:39] clients, but I have been getting a lot
[00:21:42] of clients in that um I you know, I say,
[00:21:45] you know, where'd you hear about us?
[00:21:47] Blah blah blah. And and more and more
[00:21:49] people are like, well, my friend told me
[00:21:51] about your podcast. I've listened for
[00:21:52] the last six months. I've made some
[00:21:54] money off your ideas. Uh but I got a
[00:21:56] business to run, a life to live. I'm I'm
[00:21:59] already rich. I don't want to watch
[00:22:00] markets. Uh and um so it's working and
[00:22:04] and that's the type of thing that we see
[00:22:07] and we just want to keep going because
[00:22:09] we know you guys are out there doing
[00:22:11] whatever you can to give back and we're
[00:22:13] grateful for that and we're going to
[00:22:15] continue to deliver this value um uh to
[00:22:19] reward that. And uh I'm I'm humbled by
[00:22:23] seeing you guys going out there helping
[00:22:25] people you love and sharing it and not
[00:22:27] being selfish and keeping it for
[00:22:29] yourself. So thank you so much for that.
[00:22:32] Uh now if you look at emerging markets
[00:22:34] going parabolic.
[00:22:36] Um,
[00:22:38] this is, um,
[00:22:43] by the way, the most rewarding ones are
[00:22:45] the ones that had no money or had very
[00:22:47] little money and have made enough money
[00:22:49] listening to the podcast that are now
[00:22:51] becoming clients. Those are the ones
[00:22:52] that are blowing my mind more more than
[00:22:54] anything else. Um, and I can't I can't
[00:22:58] tell you what those calls mean to me.
[00:23:00] So, uh, okay. Emerging markets
[00:23:02] allocation, global mutual funds. They
[00:23:04] are still unbelievably underweight.
[00:23:06] Remember 2001 to 2006, they went
[00:23:09] bananas. We're here. We're just coming
[00:23:12] out of the woods and people don't
[00:23:14] believe it. And that's the beautiful
[00:23:16] time to be involved. Uh diverging small
[00:23:18] versus large cap stock dynamic in US
[00:23:21] versus rest of the world. Small versus
[00:23:23] large price. Here's the opportunity
[00:23:26] guys. Going back again back to that
[00:23:29] analog early 2000s record inflows into
[00:23:31] materials. That was, you know, we were
[00:23:33] pounding the table. Laugh shall be
[00:23:35] first. We did it in December, guys. Now,
[00:23:37] now people can't get enough elbow, you
[00:23:40] know, and it's early early days. 4-week
[00:23:43] average and share buybacks versus the
[00:23:45] S&P 500. You can see that strong and
[00:23:47] long. Uh S&P 500 earnings, revisions,
[00:23:51] breath going up in a massive way. Again,
[00:23:55] not the things you see in unhealthy
[00:23:57] markets. This is the things you see off
[00:23:59] the lows. Uh, and if you remember
[00:24:03] this huge move, uh, March, you had a
[00:24:06] retest in 2023. This is 2022 to 2023,
[00:24:09] 2022 lows. Uh, this is when we were
[00:24:13] buying tech when no one wanted it.
[00:24:14] Amazon and Google, quick doubles there.
[00:24:17] Um,
[00:24:19] this lasts for a while, ladies and
[00:24:21] gentlemen. This lasts for a while.
[00:24:22] That's why I say like, yeah, we can
[00:24:24] consolidate. Yeah, we're overbought.
[00:24:27] Same thing here. They didn't believe it.
[00:24:28] Um, US retail sales by kind of business.
[00:24:32] Motor vehicle is at the top of the
[00:24:34] chart. Store retailers top of the chart.
[00:24:36] Clothing and clothing accessories top of
[00:24:38] the chart. Bracken, you better deliver
[00:24:41] for us this quarter, my man, because we
[00:24:43] our fingers are bleeding getting getting
[00:24:45] uh buying in stock at 12 bucks here. So,
[00:24:48] uh, let's go. Uh, EPS and revenue beat.
[00:24:53] Um,
[00:24:56] huge earnings quarter just as we
[00:24:58] expected. Remember I said bar so low you
[00:25:00] could step over it. Don't have to jump
[00:25:02] over it. Secret happiness low
[00:25:03] expectations. This is what it looks
[00:25:04] like. Uh, historical sector weights. It
[00:25:09] is going back to 2020 high uh 2000 highs
[00:25:14] uh and healthc care back to 2000 lows.
[00:25:19] This is what you wanted to be buying
[00:25:22] here. We got to get more healthc care
[00:25:24] exposure. That's all I'm saying. I mean,
[00:25:26] we do have we got enough
[00:25:30] with the XBI exposure and the Baxter,
[00:25:34] but this is when I want to be greedy.
[00:25:36] When others are fearful, this is when I
[00:25:37] want to be greedy as hell. Uh if I was a
[00:25:40] hedge fund guy, I'd probably set up an
[00:25:41] SPV special purpose vehicle for all
[00:25:44] those sophisticated people. uh and just
[00:25:48] load it with five
[00:25:51] healthcare names and you know add some
[00:25:53] leverage because the time is now. Uh so
[00:25:56] there's a hint for those of you
[00:25:58] listening in. Uh here's biotech just
[00:26:00] starting guys. This is going to break
[00:26:01] through and just crush it. Uh and we do
[00:26:04] have a lot of exposure there. So I'm
[00:26:06] excited. That's again sideways channel.
[00:26:09] When these things break they go for
[00:26:10] years, not minutes, not weeks, not
[00:26:13] hours. CTAs are about to double their
[00:26:16] equity exposure over the next two weeks.
[00:26:18] Again, you know, revisiting biotech's
[00:26:21] last decade going back to early 2000s
[00:26:24] right before boom time. Healthcare guys,
[00:26:27] biotech realized and consensus EPS
[00:26:30] growth for US equity indices. What's
[00:26:34] going to grow the most is
[00:26:39] small caps negative last year
[00:26:43] 21% this year 30 37% still can't give
[00:26:46] them away what is going to
[00:26:51] lag S&P this year only 7% earnings
[00:26:56] growth look double plus almost 2 and 1
[00:27:00] halfx earnings growth 25 to 30% lower
[00:27:04] multiple. You got to have small cap
[00:27:06] exposure valuations. Have the high. By
[00:27:08] the way, all this is opinion, not
[00:27:11] advice. For education andformational
[00:27:13] purposes only. Go to hedge funips.com.
[00:27:17] Click on terms. While you're there, get
[00:27:19] a hat. Why not? All right, moving along.
[00:27:22] Valuations have the highest explanatory
[00:27:24] power over long-term 10-year returns.
[00:27:28] All this means uh R2 of R squar of
[00:27:31] relative forward PE versus subsequent
[00:27:34] return spread over various time horizons
[00:27:36] since 1985 Russell 2000 versus TH000.
[00:27:40] All you need to know is shortterm
[00:27:43] markets a voting machine based on
[00:27:45] emotion. Small caps are in the hole
[00:27:48] despite this this performance. Long-term
[00:27:52] it is a weighing machine based on
[00:27:55] fundamentals. price catches up to
[00:27:57] fundamentals,
[00:27:59] whether it was
[00:28:02] Exxon at $33 during COVID or Wells Fargo
[00:28:06] at 25 or Rolls-Royce at a buck 50 and on
[00:28:11] and on or you know on and on. Vornado I
[00:28:17] if your framework is correct all you're
[00:28:20] doing is playing the time arbitrage
[00:28:22] game. That is our edge. the time, the
[00:28:25] patience, and the low leverage so we can
[00:28:27] wait until the fundamentals
[00:28:30] rather the price catches up with the
[00:28:33] fundamentals. We benefit from the
[00:28:35] short-term emotional voting machine and
[00:28:38] we cash in on the long-term fundamental
[00:28:42] weighing machine.
[00:28:46] All right. performance of the S&P and
[00:28:48] tariff exposed stocks after the major
[00:28:50] tariff announcements
[00:28:55] liberation day. Okay, that's just most
[00:28:59] borrowers have mortgage rates well below
[00:29:00] current rates leaving them with a large
[00:29:02] financial disincentive to move. We
[00:29:04] expect existing home sales to rebound
[00:29:06] modestly over the next couple years. Uh
[00:29:08] Trump is toying with an idea of
[00:29:10] eliminating capital gains on house
[00:29:12] sales. If that doesn't motivate people
[00:29:14] to do it before he gets out of office,
[00:29:16] nothing will. Uh I think it's a
[00:29:18] brilliant idea and no one else would
[00:29:20] think of that. That that is just that
[00:29:22] could be huge. More shelter disinflation
[00:29:24] likely in the pipeline. That's good news
[00:29:27] for inflation. Russell 2000 net
[00:29:30] speculators
[00:29:32] uh net position
[00:29:34] record lows here. That's when you want
[00:29:36] to be a buyer. XLE looking like it wants
[00:29:39] to potentially break out and move. We
[00:29:41] think that's going to be the case. Uh
[00:29:43] but we want to be careful not to be too
[00:29:45] exposed to the commodity price. If drill
[00:29:47] baby drill comes to pass with lower
[00:29:49] interest rates, then we want the toll
[00:29:52] takers in which case and we don't like
[00:29:54] midstream. That's kind of just a dead
[00:29:56] dead money for yield play. Uh we like
[00:29:59] the servicesers like National Oil. Well,
[00:30:01] Varco
[00:30:03] uh services companies foreign purchases
[00:30:06] of both US stocks and bonds surged in
[00:30:08] May. Analysts see no profit downturn.
[00:30:11] Okay, yellow light. Uh retail activity
[00:30:14] as percent of overall market shares
[00:30:16] traded edging up. That's normal. We also
[00:30:20] had that by the way that's natural.
[00:30:23] You had that a after the lows in June of
[00:30:28] 2020. And this reminds me of so much of
[00:30:31] that period because the market moves so
[00:30:33] big off the March lows, which by the way
[00:30:35] we called on March 19th in
[00:30:36] marketwatch.com. Go to the website, you
[00:30:38] can find it anyway. Um but um I remember
[00:30:43] everyone saying we're overbought. We're
[00:30:45] going to go back and retest blah blah
[00:30:47] blah. This is not resolved. We don't
[00:30:48] have a vaccine. Blah blah blah. And we
[00:30:50] just held pat and made that was just
[00:30:53] such an incredible year. Um and um so
[00:30:58] now we're there and people are saying
[00:30:59] the same thing. It didn't get we should
[00:31:02] watch this because this this was the
[00:31:04] this was more
[00:31:08] the the peak even after you peaked you
[00:31:10] had another 12 months until the
[00:31:11] beginning of 2022. So we're early days
[00:31:14] not late days is what that one data
[00:31:17] point would imply. NASDAQ composite
[00:31:21] present index to 100. So again, this
[00:31:24] implies, yeah, huge move, but these huge
[00:31:27] moves tend to continue to resolve
[00:31:29] higher. So keep that in mind. Um, people
[00:31:33] are still underweight. Look at the
[00:31:35] percentage uh that who say they're
[00:31:37] overweight equities. It's not what you
[00:31:39] get at highs. Highs are up here, up
[00:31:41] here, up here, up here. I mean, God, you
[00:31:45] know, the reason I'm so animated about
[00:31:48] this is I can't imagine how screwed all
[00:31:50] these managers are and how dramatic
[00:31:53] they're going to have to buy on margin
[00:31:54] to potentially keep their jobs. And at
[00:31:56] this point, they've got nothing to lose.
[00:31:58] Some of these guys are 30 points behind
[00:32:00] the benchmark. So, they got to lever up
[00:32:03] and throw the Hail Mary and pray that
[00:32:05] the ball lands by December 31st or
[00:32:07] they're going to be, you know, uh, your
[00:32:11] next Top Chef is really what it comes
[00:32:13] down to. Or, uh, taking you around in an
[00:32:15] Uber. FMS investors taking higher than
[00:32:18] normal risk levels. We're not there yet.
[00:32:20] We're starting to get there. We're not
[00:32:22] there yet. Uh, vehicle affordability is
[00:32:25] coming down. This is constructive for
[00:32:27] volumes. Here is this uh, Alibaba Group
[00:32:30] chart. It's now back up to this level
[00:32:33] and breaking through. This is a long cup
[00:32:35] and handle yada yada yada measure move
[00:32:38] 60 to uh to 120 implies 180 next move.
[00:32:43] And then I've seen all these other silly
[00:32:45] charts at 220 and it'll it'll get there.
[00:32:48] It'll get there. So uh one-year change
[00:32:51] in metro level home prices between June
[00:32:53] and July. Uh this this tends to be the
[00:32:56] leading indicator. It's called Florida.
[00:32:59] And uh we're going to start to see some
[00:33:01] softening here uh that we've been
[00:33:04] talking about in prices and more
[00:33:05] affordability. That's going to be a
[00:33:07] positive thing as supply comes on as
[00:33:09] rates come down. Only MAG 7
[00:33:12] earnings have rebounded. The rest are
[00:33:14] starting to rebound. We know that
[00:33:15] trajectory into 2025 2026 rather 2027
[00:33:20] data centers as a percentage of US power
[00:33:22] demand continue to go up. The only thing
[00:33:24] is I had a really smart guy start to
[00:33:26] talk to me about photonic chips.
[00:33:29] and um they're going to require a ton
[00:33:32] less data center and a ton less uh
[00:33:35] energy. It's it's years out, but um
[00:33:37] that's something. And by the way, um
[00:33:44] let's just say we're excited about that.
[00:33:46] Move, move along. Uh SNP 500 cycle
[00:33:49] composite for 2025.
[00:33:52] Uh,
[00:33:55] okay. So, this implies from Ned Davis
[00:33:57] research that, you know, we're kind of
[00:33:58] at the peakish and then we consolidate
[00:34:01] sideways and and this the beauty of this
[00:34:04] is if this is correct, which it may or
[00:34:05] may not be. My inclination is we
[00:34:07] probably do have a little more. We
[00:34:09] definitely have a lot more under the
[00:34:10] surface. Maybe the indices look like
[00:34:12] this because this is basically a MAG 7
[00:34:13] chart. Um,
[00:34:17] if you're spending a lot of money buying
[00:34:18] puts or getting short here, you lose
[00:34:20] 100% of your premium because this is
[00:34:23] you're not going to get the pullback.
[00:34:24] Your recency bias is where you're
[00:34:26] screwed. You're thinking, "Oh, we just
[00:34:27] had a 20% or 25% correction, whatever it
[00:34:31] was. Uh, we're going to get another big
[00:34:33] correction." Uh, ain't going to happen.
[00:34:36] Okay. We've had three of them in uh
[00:34:40] 2022, 2024.
[00:34:43] I'm sorry. 2020, 2022, now 2025. You
[00:34:48] usually get three. You get one of those
[00:34:50] every 4.1 years. We've now pulled three
[00:34:53] into four years. Uh you're not going to
[00:34:56] get that. You might get five or 10%, but
[00:34:58] that's not going to be enough to make
[00:34:59] the options pay out. So, suck it up,
[00:35:02] buttercup. Get off leverage or any
[00:35:05] material leverage and uh just ride out
[00:35:07] the volatility and it'll res revolve
[00:35:09] higher by the end of the year. Go on a
[00:35:11] cruise for the next three months. Okay.
[00:35:13] Uh, utilities versus NASDAQ by decade.
[00:35:16] That's not useful right now. Um, here's
[00:35:20] showing corporate insider sell to buy
[00:35:22] ratio has no indicative power selling.
[00:35:25] They sell for a multitude of reasons.
[00:35:27] They buy for only one unless you see
[00:35:29] excessive stuff like we've talked about
[00:35:31] some names, but um this this example
[00:35:34] shows rally continued for another year
[00:35:36] and change, another six months and
[00:35:39] change, another few months and change.
[00:35:42] So, we're not even at the level yet. And
[00:35:44] then you probably have another few
[00:35:45] months, which again,
[00:35:48] I think I think this is going to it this
[00:35:51] could surprise people up to October,
[00:35:55] which would be atypical to have any
[00:35:58] level of um continued stability through
[00:36:03] August and September. Usually, you'd get
[00:36:05] instability in August and September. So,
[00:36:08] we'll see. Maybe it'll be the function
[00:36:10] of the shadow Fed or the Fed actually
[00:36:12] doing the right thing. But um
[00:36:16] all right,
[00:36:18] again here is tech and Xtech again
[00:36:21] extreme. That's where you want to be is
[00:36:24] where the puck is going, not where it is
[00:36:27] in the rear view mirror.
[00:36:30] Five biggest stocks. Boy, we we got a
[00:36:32] ton this magnif.
[00:36:35] Okay,
[00:36:37] other 493. So again, this is your
[00:36:39] trajectory. Mag 7 decelerates, drops off
[00:36:43] the cliff, uh then stabilizes
[00:36:45] unmagnificent 493 catches up.
[00:36:51] Median wage growth is declining. It's
[00:36:53] good for inflation.
[00:36:57] Corporate profits,
[00:37:00] oil and gas stocks most likely to have
[00:37:02] bullish ratings.
[00:37:08] Southbound outflows, huge flows into
[00:37:10] Hong Kong,
[00:37:12] healthc care. Again, this is that
[00:37:14] consensus forward 12-month PE valuation
[00:37:17] versus history. There's a lot of ponies
[00:37:19] in that pile, guys
[00:37:22] and gals.
[00:37:25] Sellers
[00:37:27] earning sentiment
[00:37:29] money market fund assets as a percentage
[00:37:31] of S&P 500 uh market cap.
[00:37:36] Okay.
[00:37:38] Coalesi letter. What is this dat
[00:37:40] posting? Labor market continues to
[00:37:42] weaken. That we know Fed's got to move.
[00:37:45] It's going to be too late. Powell, get
[00:37:47] on it. uh just announced the shadow Fed.
[00:37:49] This guy's not going to do it. He's got
[00:37:50] to stick up his butt. I mean, um
[00:37:53] consumer attitudes about jobs. Market
[00:37:55] still weak.
[00:37:57] Like to see that. Uh percent of S&P 500
[00:38:02] stocks in a bare market. Trending down,
[00:38:04] but not at an extreme
[00:38:08] that you would see, you know, before
[00:38:12] bad things happen.
[00:38:15] S&P earnings beat rate 85% surprise
[00:38:18] 7.6%.
[00:38:21] Medicaid exposed insurers have been
[00:38:23] crushed. I think there's a pony in that
[00:38:24] pile.
[00:38:26] Uh
[00:38:28] Prime Book is getting a little
[00:38:29] stretched. So there's that.
[00:38:33] Record bearishness.
[00:38:37] Percent of publicly traded companies
[00:38:39] experiencing net buying from corporate
[00:38:41] officers and directors. So,
[00:38:50] keeping an eye on that. So, you know,
[00:38:52] you got to take all of these and and
[00:38:54] probabilistically bet. And it's, you
[00:38:56] know, it's complicated, which which, you
[00:38:59] know, it's like when you can't read the
[00:39:00] break on a putt, you just go back of the
[00:39:02] cup, straight down the middle. And
[00:39:04] that's kind of, I think, where we are. I
[00:39:06] I don't think it's going to break up
[00:39:09] huge. And I don't think it's going to
[00:39:10] break down huge for the next few months.
[00:39:12] I think it's going to be sideways chop.
[00:39:14] So just put it in the back of the cup
[00:39:16] and uh and benefit from from being in
[00:39:18] the lagards that these managers are
[00:39:20] forced to buy.
[00:39:22] Small cap underperformance relative to
[00:39:24] large cap has been his greatest in
[00:39:25] history. Uh small caps represent the
[00:39:28] greatest US market opportunity.
[00:39:31] Uh which is uh from Seth Golden. We
[00:39:34] agree
[00:39:40] that's interesting. Cap weighted. So
[00:39:42] like worst case scenario I see would be
[00:39:44] a retest of this before pushing higher.
[00:39:46] Equal weighted again that this this
[00:39:48] shows under the surface just breaking
[00:39:50] out.
[00:39:53] Again a lot of great de data this week.
[00:39:58] Good work on that Jeff. Uh China defends
[00:40:01] growth model plans consumption it
[00:40:03] greater driver. Alibaba the toll taker
[00:40:06] markets bet Beijing is getting serious
[00:40:07] about China's over capacity. That's why
[00:40:09] you're starting to see some uh movement
[00:40:11] on Albamaro. Chinese stocks in Hong Kong
[00:40:14] rise to highest level in 4 years.
[00:40:18] Headline you did not expect to see two
[00:40:20] years ago when we were pounding the
[00:40:22] table. China investors snap up Hong Kong
[00:40:25] stocks as flows near record. Alibaba
[00:40:28] upgrades flagship Quen 3 model to
[00:40:31] outperform open AI. Deep seek in maths
[00:40:34] and coding. Bessant sees China tariff.
[00:40:37] truce extended in Sweden next week.
[00:40:41] Bullish Trump moles removing capital
[00:40:44] gains tax on home sales. The aim is to
[00:40:46] juice the housing market. Juice, baby
[00:40:49] juice. Home builders are slashing prices
[00:40:51] at the highest rate in three years.
[00:40:54] Cleveland Cliff CEO says surge in
[00:40:56] domestic auto manufacturing is imminent.
[00:41:00] How you doing? Cooper Standard smiling
[00:41:03] so wide we could eat a banana sideways.
[00:41:05] Fed's Waller hints at July disscent as
[00:41:08] he makes the case for rate cut and the
[00:41:12] job as Fed chair, which he'd be a great
[00:41:14] one. Trump signs stable coin bill
[00:41:17] delivering win for crypto industry, uh,
[00:41:20] which means stable coins, which means
[00:41:22] PayPal, which means demand for
[00:41:25] treasuries, which means lower yields,
[00:41:27] which means off to the races. Juicy
[00:41:29] dividends tempt investors into lagging
[00:41:32] high yield stocks. How you doing? We've
[00:41:34] been talking about it for 6 months.
[00:41:36] Looking for cheap stocks. Healthc care
[00:41:37] shares haven't looked this good in 30
[00:41:39] years. We agree. PayPal taps wallets
[00:41:41] from China and India to make crossber
[00:41:44] payments easier for two billion people.
[00:41:47] Alex Chris turning it around, baby.
[00:41:50] Stock going up like nobody's business.
[00:41:53] Japan has committed to purchasing 100
[00:41:56] Boeing aircraft as part of the new trade
[00:41:59] framework. Unbelievable. Opinion follows
[00:42:02] trend. Eurozone private sector grows at
[00:42:05] fastest pace in almost a year.
[00:42:07] International versus exus. Now
[00:42:10] the crown gets its shine back stock
[00:42:12] market and sentiment results. Each week
[00:42:14] we cover one to two companies we
[00:42:15] previously discussed in podcast for own
[00:42:18] clients including personally. So what
[00:42:19] you what do you see here? You see a
[00:42:21] divergence. Record cash flows. Prices
[00:42:24] come down a lot. uh short-term voting
[00:42:26] machine, long-term weighing machine will
[00:42:28] catch up to those great fundamentals
[00:42:30] which are going to get better because
[00:42:31] they no longer have the drag of the
[00:42:33] fiber business. Uh with a portfolio of
[00:42:35] 40,000 cell towers across the US, US
[00:42:37] Crown Castle is the nation's largest
[00:42:39] provider of shared communications
[00:42:40] infrastructure. Number one thing to know
[00:42:42] with CCI is that like all REITs, it
[00:42:44] trades on interest rates. When the
[00:42:45] 10-year yield falls, REITs tend to
[00:42:46] benefit and CCI is no exception. You can
[00:42:49] see the overlay here. Whether it's the
[00:42:51] removal of supplementary leverage ratio
[00:42:53] or the genius act and stable coin
[00:42:54] catalyst potentially creating two
[00:42:56] trillion of treasury demand and setting
[00:42:58] up an operation twist type scenario.
[00:43:00] We've been making the case lower 10
[00:43:02] yield for quite some time. This view is
[00:43:04] central to our thesis that dividend cut
[00:43:06] remain dividend yield remains cheap and
[00:43:08] overlooked allowing us to add high
[00:43:10] quality dividend paying names that are
[00:43:11] at fire sale prices. Think CCI 3.85% 75%
[00:43:14] yield. Stanley Black & Decker 4.51.
[00:43:17] Baxter 2.5. Hormemell 4% and Dagio 4% to
[00:43:21] name a few. The point is these dividend
[00:43:23] players have been ignored and left for
[00:43:25] dead over the past few years. But that
[00:43:26] won't be the case for much longer. Once
[00:43:28] the Fed wakes up and starts cutting,
[00:43:29] they'll be in high demand in short
[00:43:31] order. Dividend yield exp inexpensive,
[00:43:34] most inexpensive since 2001. Dividend
[00:43:38] yield neglected by managers. They will
[00:43:40] be chasing like you're seeing them chase
[00:43:42] off the April lows. What you will
[00:43:45] immediately see is that a good chunk of
[00:43:47] the 7.4 trillion sitting on the
[00:43:49] sidelines in money markets earning over
[00:43:51] 4% yields will suddenly be forced into
[00:43:53] find yield elsewhere. At that point,
[00:43:55] investors will be tripping over
[00:43:56] themselves to get dividend exposure and
[00:43:58] we'll be more than happy to help them
[00:44:00] out. Sold to you. That's but that's
[00:44:03] tomorrow's newspaper today. Until then,
[00:44:05] we're happy to sit on our hands and wait
[00:44:07] as CCI and the rest of the high-quality
[00:44:08] businesses continue to execute
[00:44:10] accordingly. That brings us to CCI's Q2
[00:44:13] results. This was another lights out
[00:44:14] quarter for CCI beating both top and
[00:44:16] bottom line expectations and raising
[00:44:18] fullear guidance. The sale of the
[00:44:20] capital intensive fiber business remains
[00:44:21] on track to close in the first half of
[00:44:24] 2026, leaving CCI as a higher margin,
[00:44:26] leaner business, and the only publicly
[00:44:28] traded pure play US tower company out
[00:44:30] there. The next big catalyst will be the
[00:44:33] announcement of new CEO. Second time's a
[00:44:36] charm. And in the meantime, you know,
[00:44:38] buy a business that's so great a ham
[00:44:40] sandwich could run it because one day
[00:44:42] they will. CCI is a perfect example. And
[00:44:44] in the meantime, just get a beating
[00:44:46] heart. This business is so good it'll
[00:44:47] work with or without a good CEO. Uh the
[00:44:50] business continues to hum along with
[00:44:52] organic growth rates accelerating to
[00:44:53] 4.7%. The sprint churn overhang largely
[00:44:56] gone by the end of 2025 and secular
[00:44:59] trends in the mobile data consumption
[00:45:00] and 5G driving annual wireless data
[00:45:03] demand growth of 20 to 30%. Here's
[00:45:06] everything you need to know following
[00:45:07] two Q2 earnings. You see it all
[00:45:09] highlighted. Let's go to the top 10
[00:45:11] points. Number one, management raised
[00:45:13] full year 2025 guidance increasing site
[00:45:15] rental revenues by 10 million, adjusted
[00:45:17] Ebida by 25 million and AFO by 35
[00:45:19] million in the updated outlook. Two,
[00:45:22] higher leasing activity drove organic
[00:45:24] revenue to 4.7% adjusted for the 51
[00:45:27] million impact on sprint cancellations.
[00:45:30] Management continues to expect even
[00:45:31] stronger leasing activity in the second
[00:45:33] half of the year. Three, I feel sorry
[00:45:35] for those of you who are listening to me
[00:45:36] on 1.5 times speed. Good luck. The 8.5
[00:45:40] billion sale of the capital intensive
[00:45:42] small sales and fiber solutions business
[00:45:43] remains on track to close the in the
[00:45:46] first half of 2026 with CCI already
[00:45:48] securing state level approvals. Once
[00:45:51] completed, Crown Castle will become the
[00:45:52] only publicly traded pure play tower
[00:45:55] company focused exclusively on the US.
[00:46:01] Four, capital allocation priorities
[00:46:03] following the fiber sale still remain
[00:46:05] unchanged. Reducing $6 billion of debt
[00:46:07] is the top priority. Any remaining cash
[00:46:09] flow will be directed toward the share
[00:46:10] repurchases. After the sale, management
[00:46:12] expects to grow the dividend in line
[00:46:14] with AFO while maintaining a payout
[00:46:16] ratio between 75 to 80%. management
[00:46:18] remains confident in the roll out of 5G
[00:46:21] networks, noting that the previous 4G
[00:46:23] deployment cycle lasted 10 to 12 years
[00:46:25] and that the 5G cycle is still expected
[00:46:27] to be even longer. Continued strength of
[00:46:28] incremental mobile data data demand.
[00:46:31] Carriers continue to report strong
[00:46:32] results with overall traffic increasing,
[00:46:34] subscribers growing, churn r and churn
[00:46:36] rising, all of which typically lead to
[00:46:38] higher investment activity and wireless
[00:46:39] networks to keep up with incremental
[00:46:41] demand. Seven, uh, service gross margins
[00:46:44] continue to improve with management and
[00:46:45] raising the full year expectations. 275
[00:46:48] to 105 million, an increase of five
[00:46:50] million from the pre previous outlook.
[00:46:51] They expect gains to be made over the
[00:46:53] last six to 12 months to be structural
[00:46:55] and sustainable going forward. The board
[00:46:57] is actively searching for a new CEO with
[00:46:59] a decision expected before the fiber
[00:47:01] business deal closes. Management remains
[00:47:03] committed to maintaining an investment
[00:47:05] grade balance sheet with approximately
[00:47:06] 86% of debt at fixed rate weighted
[00:47:08] average debt maturity over six years and
[00:47:11] 4.7 billion of availability under a
[00:47:13] revolving credit facility. Sprint
[00:47:15] related churn is expected to be largely
[00:47:17] behind CCI at the end of 2025 with
[00:47:19] management reiterating long-term churn
[00:47:22] expectations of just 1 to 2%.
[00:47:25] So read through the uh earnings call
[00:47:28] here. Albamaro update. Okay. By the way,
[00:47:31] huge move from 49 to about 80 this week
[00:47:34] in just a few weeks. Uh our timing on uh
[00:47:38] the media stuff couldn't have been more
[00:47:39] perfect. Uh Albamaro is the world's low.
[00:47:43] But but here's the key. Just getting
[00:47:45] started. Albamaro is the world's lowest
[00:47:48] and largest and lowest cost lithium
[00:47:50] producer. The stock has been on a tear
[00:47:52] over the past month or so, up close to
[00:47:54] 40% as lithium prices continue to
[00:47:56] rebound off multi-year lows. A big part
[00:47:58] of the story is what's happening in
[00:48:00] China. Over the past couple of weeks,
[00:48:02] the Chinese government launched a
[00:48:03] campaign focused on anti-involution,
[00:48:06] a push against self-destructive price
[00:48:08] wars and excess competition.
[00:48:11] This move is part of a broader effect to
[00:48:12] address chronic overcapacity across many
[00:48:14] sectors and the resulting deflationary
[00:48:16] pressures. To the benefit of Albamaro
[00:48:19] shareholders and the overall lithium
[00:48:21] market, China has already begun
[00:48:22] implementing the plan. Just last week,
[00:48:24] Chinese regulators ordered the closure
[00:48:26] of Zangi, a major domestic lithium miner
[00:48:29] with 11,000 tons of lithium capacity.
[00:48:31] This is welcome news for Albamaro as one
[00:48:33] of the major drivers of the ongoing
[00:48:34] supply glut was the flood of smallcale
[00:48:37] producers in China. many fully
[00:48:39] subsidized chasing record high lithium
[00:48:41] prices we saw in 2022. As expected, the
[00:48:43] longer prices remain in the pain zone,
[00:48:45] the more low lower quality marginal
[00:48:48] producers will get taken out on a
[00:48:49] stretcher. Albamaro Management estimated
[00:48:51] in their last earnings call that about
[00:48:53] 45 40% of current lithium capacity is at
[00:48:57] or below break even with only around
[00:49:01] one-third of that supply having come
[00:49:03] offline so far. If China is serious
[00:49:05] about curbing over capacity, it's going
[00:49:08] to be a busy season for stretchers.
[00:49:12] Okay. Uh
[00:49:15] and not only are the subsidized player
[00:49:17] in China getting taken out on
[00:49:19] stretchers, but so are the geniuses who
[00:49:21] shorted Albamaro in the hole back in
[00:49:24] May.
[00:49:27] Of the approximately 117.7
[00:49:30] million shares outstanding, nearly 20%
[00:49:32] were short. morons. The short interest
[00:49:34] has fallen to 16% setting up even more
[00:49:37] pain ahead. Keep in mind, despite the
[00:49:40] past couple of weeks feeling like a big
[00:49:42] move in Albamar, the most exciting part
[00:49:43] is the train hasn't even left the
[00:49:44] station. This is nearly 40 this nearly
[00:49:47] 40% rally has come off just a 15%
[00:49:49] rebound in lithium prices off the recent
[00:49:51] lows to 9,800 per metric ton. Just wait
[00:49:54] until the operating wait until the
[00:49:56] operating leverage really kicks in when
[00:49:57] prices climb back up to 15,000 to 20,000
[00:50:00] per metric ton range. At that point,
[00:50:02] we'll be smiling so wide we could eat a
[00:50:04] banana sideways or two. Uh, and Albamaro
[00:50:07] will be minting more cash than they know
[00:50:09] what to do with. Zoom out and the big
[00:50:11] move in lithium can hardly be seen. This
[00:50:15] thing is just getting started. Lithium
[00:50:18] supply and demand imbalance. It's coming
[00:50:21] into balance. Fear and greed. Yeah, a
[00:50:24] little froth there. National Association
[00:50:26] of Active Investment Managers confused
[00:50:28] just since they were selling at the
[00:50:29] lows. They don't know what to do uh now
[00:50:31] that we've moved up.
[00:50:34] All opinion, not advice. Uh earnings ARC
[00:50:38] uh Kathy Wood ETF top 30 weights
[00:50:41] earnings estimates down 2.5% for this
[00:50:44] year, 1.15 for next year. Uh and then
[00:50:49] oil and gas slaughtered down by 16% for
[00:50:54] this year in the last 60 days and 16.7.
[00:50:56] That's why we want to get involved. I
[00:50:58] think we're completely flushed
[00:51:00] expectations. Uh there is one if you
[00:51:03] look here what what are the couple of
[00:51:05] names that have actually had earnings
[00:51:07] estimates go up while the sector is down
[00:51:11] 16%. And one of those names is right at
[00:51:14] the top of the list. It's called
[00:51:15] National Oil Well Varco NOV Inc. Uh
[00:51:20] which we covered in detail last week.
[00:51:23] So, uh, economic data, I think all that
[00:51:27] really matters is what the Fed does next
[00:51:29] week. All the rest of this is noise,
[00:51:32] building permits low. Obviously, they
[00:51:33] can't take that risk with uh uh rates
[00:51:37] where they are. Fed is just gumming up
[00:51:38] the system and we're biting time until
[00:51:40] they wake the hell up or Trump announces
[00:51:43] his pick and the shadow Fed kicks in.
[00:51:46] Uh, 83% of companies have beat so far.
[00:51:50] Growth rate is 4.6. That's above 4 5.6
[00:51:53] above 4.8
[00:51:56] and I think it's going to move even
[00:51:57] higher. Ask me anything questions. Let's
[00:52:00] rock and roll. Uh first one GPN we've
[00:52:05] covered. Not for me. I know Elliot's
[00:52:07] involved. We like PayPal. All right,
[00:52:10] we're going to get through these quick
[00:52:11] today. I don't have another hour to do
[00:52:13] this. Uh, Phillip,
[00:52:18] how do you establish your fair value on
[00:52:19] CCI in their transformative journey? A
[00:52:22] lot higher. Moving along. Uh, clients
[00:52:25] will know when we've hit fair value when
[00:52:27] they get a notification in their
[00:52:29] interactive brokers account. Salem made.
[00:52:31] We're not anywhere near yet. Jo
[00:52:33] Greenblat, I hope you're doing well.
[00:52:35] Keep up the great work. Um,
[00:52:39] all of your names are flying. Big moves
[00:52:41] haven't even started. Uh, hoping to get
[00:52:43] your thought on Bayex Energy.
[00:52:48] Okay, BTE.
[00:53:27] Cash flow is recovering. Revenues
[00:53:28] haven't started to recover. Margins are
[00:53:30] recovering.
[00:53:32] Let's take a look at the
[00:53:54] these guys do
[00:53:57] crude natural gas. Oh, so this is EMP.
[00:54:00] So you're going to be at the effective
[00:54:02] prices with this. Um,
[00:54:05] but
[00:54:09] let me take a look.
[00:54:21] Yeah, I'd want to see their credit line.
[00:54:23] They got a huge amount of receivables
[00:54:25] for some reason that aren't getting
[00:54:26] paid.
[00:54:28] Um,
[00:54:32] $1.5 billion of debt.
[00:54:42] So, I would go through their filings and
[00:54:46] understand their liquidity. I mean, 400
[00:54:48] million of free cash flow last year is
[00:54:50] pretty significant.
[00:54:52] Um,
[00:54:56] [Music]
[00:55:00] don't love that they've added 300
[00:55:02] million shares. I really Maybe they did
[00:55:05] an acquisition. find out if this is just
[00:55:09] this is probably acquisitions, but
[00:55:10] you're issuing stock down here. I hate
[00:55:12] management that does that. You buy stock
[00:55:15] down here, you don't issue it down
[00:55:17] there. Um,
[00:55:21] I don't like what they did to the share
[00:55:24] count. I mean, it's, you know, it's up
[00:55:25] from 350 million to 800 million in six
[00:55:28] years. I really hate managers like this.
[00:55:31] I'm not I mean I'm I'm gonna be
[00:55:35] straightforward. I gotta say though I
[00:55:37] think there's a margin of safety and I
[00:55:39] think the timing is right. So I want to
[00:55:41] know you got to do solvencancy analysis.
[00:55:43] What availability do they have in terms
[00:55:45] of credit? Uh what's the sustainability?
[00:55:48] Why were all those shares issued? Was it
[00:55:50] for dumb acquisition? Giving away stock
[00:55:52] at a low price or they just giving
[00:55:54] themselves a ton of uh stock or they
[00:55:57] using it to raise capital. find out why
[00:55:59] they're such disrespectful pigs when it
[00:56:03] comes to equity. Uh, and if you can get
[00:56:05] comfortable with that, then maybe it's a
[00:56:08] buy. But, uh, they're higher and better
[00:56:10] uses, but I think you're on the right
[00:56:12] track with this one despite the hair.
[00:56:14] So, um,
[00:56:18] okay. Yeah, that's Dylan did that
[00:56:20] awesome pick. JT,
[00:56:23] hope you're not stuck in an air. Take a
[00:56:25] quick look at BTU.
[00:56:33] Yeah, you're probably fine with Peabody.
[00:56:35] I mean,
[00:56:45] I don't know. Cash flow is going down
[00:56:47] though. like
[00:56:49] might already be priced in.
[00:56:57] I think there are higher and better
[00:56:58] uses. What is this? Is um
[00:57:02] coal coal business. I I don't think you
[00:57:05] need to go that far down. And I and it's
[00:57:09] I think you got an upside of, you know,
[00:57:11] maybe a double. I uh
[00:57:16] it's not my favorite. I'm going to pass
[00:57:17] on that one. It It's not bad. I think
[00:57:19] you'll make money if you buy it here and
[00:57:21] hold it for 6 months, but um it's not
[00:57:24] all right. Uh
[00:57:27] okay, that's Andrew coming in. Um
[00:57:31] Diego Palace
[00:57:34] BTE.
[00:57:37] Uh we just did that one. So, thank you
[00:57:39] for that, Diego. I guess that must be
[00:57:42] making the rounds on social media
[00:57:44] because getting the same questions. Uh
[00:57:47] thoughts on human. This is one that is
[00:57:49] on our target for healthcare exposure.
[00:57:51] We are not making decisions. We got to
[00:57:53] just unpacking this impact to Medicaid
[00:57:56] cuts is like a pain in the ass, but my
[00:57:58] guess is it's overshot.
[00:58:01] Um but I got to be certain before I get
[00:58:05] super comfy lemonade. This is the
[00:58:07] automated uh insurance company. Maybe
[00:58:10] they're finally there. Let's take a
[00:58:12] look.
[00:58:20] Still not cash flow positive. Revenues
[00:58:22] keep going up. Margins recovering.
[00:58:26] What are they doing on, by the way, is
[00:58:28] this a is this a carrier or just a
[00:58:32] agent?
[00:58:35] Because I think agents are done in the
[00:58:37] next 10 years.
[00:58:39] um
[00:58:41] provides various insurance except for
[00:58:43] the really high-end bespoke stuff
[00:58:47] renters and homeowners
[00:58:54] actually agent for other insurance
[00:58:57] companies.
[00:58:59] Ah
[00:59:03] I think it's going to be me too. I mean,
[00:59:05] they're the innovator in this space. So,
[00:59:08] I just it's not cash flow positive. So,
[00:59:10] for me, it's like not that interesting.
[00:59:13] These are like guesses on the future
[00:59:15] type of companies. And in that case,
[00:59:18] I I understand what you're doing and I
[00:59:20] think you're right, but it's outside of
[00:59:25] I got to make a leap into the future of
[00:59:27] who's going to be the winner of a new
[00:59:28] technology, and I'm not really willing
[00:59:30] to do that. Um,
[00:59:34] okay. So, these are all people asking to
[00:59:36] invest. Unfortunately, we closed out for
[00:59:38] smaller accounts. So, if you're 5
[00:59:39] million plus, call me today. We'll get
[00:59:41] you in. If you're 1 to 5 million, you
[00:59:43] got to wait till October 1st. Uh Gasper
[00:59:46] Moharic,
[00:59:50] what is the price of EuroUSD a year from
[00:59:53] now? No effing idea, but Euro will be
[00:59:56] higher.
[00:59:58] Thank you for the question,
[01:00:00] Jeffrey.
[01:00:02] That's another inquiry. Daniel Borman.
[01:00:06] Uh,
[01:00:09] yeah. Okay. Thank you. We covered that
[01:00:11] with the capital gains.
[01:00:20] Alex Claris Corp.
[01:00:24] Uh,
[01:00:29] I know the chairman too well. I'm not
[01:00:30] going to comment on this one.
[01:00:33] Lee Foster,
[01:00:36] potential breakup of Craft Hind bullish.
[01:00:41] Alex B
[01:00:43] covered that. ClariS
[01:00:49] Mike
[01:00:56] Dan
[01:00:58] Kagra Brands. That's Dan D.
[01:01:14] Yeah, they're just revenues are just
[01:01:16] showing no sign
[01:01:18] of recovery nor their margins. But how
[01:01:22] much of that is priced in for a company
[01:01:24] that owns some of the greatest brands
[01:01:27] known to man?
[01:01:31] I mean, the thing about this is like
[01:01:32] even if you do a great job, maybe you
[01:01:35] make 75 80% and you're gonna have to
[01:01:37] wait a while because this is still
[01:01:39] breaking down. Um,
[01:01:47] Bird's Eye, Merry Calendars, Duncan
[01:01:50] Hind, Healthy Choice, Slim Gym, Ready
[01:01:52] Whip, Angie's. Yeah, I don't I don't
[01:01:55] love these brands.
[01:01:56] I just let me just get you a financial
[01:01:59] answer because I I don't really like
[01:02:01] this one. I've looked at it. I think
[01:02:04] you're going to be right. I think it's
[01:02:07] going to be okay, but I think there are
[01:02:09] higher and better uses. And I do like
[01:02:11] your thinking on it. Um
[01:02:29] I mean 1.6 billion of free cash. Not too
[01:02:32] shabby.
[01:02:47] It's a lot of debt on on those kind of
[01:02:49] brands. I I just don't think the upside
[01:02:52] is warrants the risk even though the
[01:02:54] price may move in the short term.
[01:03:00] Gleb tidewater we covered last week. We
[01:03:02] prefer national oil. This is another
[01:03:06] social media stock TDDW I think.
[01:03:14] I mean, anyone that could destroy that
[01:03:16] much value that quickly, I'm not a fan.
[01:03:19] I I I You're probably right. I I just
[01:03:22] would rather a sure sleep at night bet
[01:03:25] like Varco where I can make a triple or
[01:03:28] quadruple versus something like that
[01:03:30] where you're hoping for a 10 bag if
[01:03:32] management doesn't completely screw you
[01:03:34] like they have in the past. It's like,
[01:03:36] "Oh, I don't expect the scorpion's going
[01:03:38] to bite my back again." Well, shame on
[01:03:40] you. That's what scorpions do. Um,
[01:03:57] uh, Charlie's asking about reweing and
[01:03:58] all that stuff. That's for clients. I
[01:04:00] would just say that you sell a company
[01:04:02] when it's reached your fair value. You
[01:04:03] don't
[01:04:05] I mean, if it becomes insanely
[01:04:08] overweight in the portfolio and it's fra
[01:04:10] frothy and near fair value that you
[01:04:12] decided before you got in where you were
[01:04:14] going to get out, then you can trim. But
[01:04:16] generally, let it run to fair value and
[01:04:18] then just get out. Um,
[01:04:23] your podcast
[01:04:26] um, been listening to your podcast since
[01:04:28] 2020. You helped me navigate my first
[01:04:30] internship on Bay Street in Toronto
[01:04:31] during my senior year. I most definitely
[01:04:33] continue to use your advice along it's
[01:04:35] opinion not advice along with the
[01:04:37] knowledge and pass along to your
[01:04:38] listeners and eventually have enough
[01:04:39] capital to give you to manage money for
[01:04:41] my family. Once again want to thank you
[01:04:43] for all your hard work. We appreciate
[01:04:44] your thoughts on white cap resources.
[01:04:48] Okay,
[01:04:49] these Canadians love their resource
[01:04:52] plays
[01:04:54] cap. It's like in your DNA. You guys
[01:04:57] cannot live without commodity stocks.
[01:05:00] It's just like it's like oxygen for you
[01:05:02] people, which now that now is a good
[01:05:05] time. So, uh I'm not knocking you. WCP,
[01:05:14] I mean, it's it's just breaking out like
[01:05:16] where
[01:05:17] the time to be asking me this question
[01:05:19] was in 2020 when it was a buck, not at
[01:05:21] 2025 when it's at 10. Um
[01:05:26] free cash flow is actually declining and
[01:05:28] it's at new time highs. So, I'm going to
[01:05:30] say pass on this one, Joe. There are
[01:05:32] better opportunities. Yes, it's breaking
[01:05:34] out. It might continue, blah blah blah,
[01:05:36] but I think there are better
[01:05:37] opportunities right now.
[01:05:39] Uh,
[01:05:41] let's see.
[01:05:45] Lewis here from Nottingham.
[01:05:56] Lewis here from Nottingham in the UK.
[01:05:57] been following you on the podcast now
[01:05:59] for about six months. If I'm honest, I
[01:06:00] wasn't your biggest fan at first as a
[01:06:02] new investor. I was heavily invested in
[01:06:04] shiny things, a lot of Mag 7, and I'd
[01:06:06] hear your views each day on socials,
[01:06:08] which were generally negative for all my
[01:06:10] investments. That said, I dip my toe in
[01:06:12] the water on CPS and obviously got a
[01:06:15] double bagger, which was great. I'm now
[01:06:17] invested most of your picks and I've
[01:06:19] seen great short-term returns. QXO,
[01:06:21] Generrack, Albamaro, Estee Lauder.
[01:06:23] Hopefully, this is just the start of the
[01:06:24] ride as I made for the long term. Number
[01:06:26] one, do your own work. Uh, glad you have
[01:06:29] had that positive experience, but do not
[01:06:32] be buying it because I buy it or talk
[01:06:34] about it. You buy it because you've done
[01:06:36] your own work and you've come to the
[01:06:37] similar conclusions or don't buy it
[01:06:39] because you came to different
[01:06:41] conclusions. Self- responsibility. Uh,
[01:06:43] but interested, however, in your views
[01:06:45] on Grab Holdings.
[01:06:48] Um,
[01:06:49] I'm putting all my UK mates on to you.
[01:06:52] So, you're getting good traction from
[01:06:53] across the pond. Fingers crossed. maybe
[01:06:54] in a position to become a client next
[01:06:56] year. Very awesome. Thank you for all of
[01:06:58] that. Let's take a look at Grab.
[01:07:03] And that's the way it goes. Pay it
[01:07:05] forward. Share it with people you love.
[01:07:07] And we'll keep delivering the value.
[01:07:17] Okay. Turning positive free cash flow.
[01:07:19] Margins going up. What's the balance
[01:07:22] sheet look like? I generally, by the
[01:07:24] way, I do not like the food delivery
[01:07:27] business,
[01:07:34] but this one also has financial
[01:07:36] services, etc.
[01:07:40] Um,
[01:07:48] [Music]
[01:08:04] wait a second. This has a 21 billion
[01:08:07] market cap on 23.
[01:08:11] All right. So, it's one of these 10 time
[01:08:13] sales stories.
[01:08:26] And the problem is the revenue.
[01:08:29] Obviously, they got the COVID boost and
[01:08:30] now the revenue is like starting to
[01:08:32] recover. But you to justify 10 times
[01:08:36] sales, you really need a super growth
[01:08:38] rate and it's just not occurring here.
[01:08:40] Uh I think on a trading, if I had to
[01:08:43] look at it on a trading basis, maybe you
[01:08:44] get a double. I just don't think that
[01:08:46] the business is justifying um
[01:08:51] where it is now, never mind a lot more,
[01:08:53] even though it's probably going to go
[01:08:54] there on a trading basis.
[01:08:57] So let's see if we got any other stuff
[01:09:01] that we haven't covered. No, that's
[01:09:03] going all the way back.
[01:09:06] A lowest July 12th.
[01:09:09] Adam,
[01:09:13] Elevance Healthcare.
[01:09:17] I don't understand this one enough,
[01:09:22] but we're looking at it.
[01:09:32] This still looks like a falling knife to
[01:09:33] me.
[01:09:36] This is probably hit by medic Medicaid
[01:09:39] cuts.
[01:09:51] I'd hold off on this one for now. I I
[01:09:53] think you're going to have time to buy
[01:09:54] it. We'll we'll revisit that one in
[01:09:56] coming weeks. Marco
[01:09:58] Deckers. Um, we covered this.
[01:10:04] I'd rather riskreward.
[01:10:07] I like betting on Bracken.
[01:10:26] I don't think it's come down enough to
[01:10:28] be interesting to me. Um, it's had a run
[01:10:31] already. That's yesterday's nude news
[01:10:33] rear view mirror.
[01:10:36] Brad
[01:10:38] Tomlinson,
[01:10:43] it's a REIT.
[01:10:51] uh you got to know the properties. This
[01:10:53] one we we've covered this one before. I
[01:10:55] don't know the properties. You really
[01:10:56] have to underwrite each of the
[01:10:57] properties in their portfolio and um and
[01:11:00] then the balance sheet, right? You know,
[01:11:02] it's it's trading down because they're,
[01:11:03] you know, they're going bankrupt and you
[01:11:05] have to come up with a case. No, they're
[01:11:07] not going bankrupt because the asset
[01:11:08] value, the vacancy rate, all those other
[01:11:11] things. I could only do that with
[01:11:12] Bernado because I know the buildings.
[01:11:14] So, uh not not for me. Even though it'll
[01:11:17] pro, you know, I I I think like buying
[01:11:19] office now in aggregate, home run. I'm
[01:11:22] probably late. We were pounding the
[01:11:24] table telling all of our real estate
[01:11:25] clients if you like if you're in real
[01:11:27] estate like buy offices like crazy a
[01:11:30] year and a half ago and now that they've
[01:11:31] just moved huge. So, um, but that's not
[01:11:35] what we do. So, we stay in our lane.
[01:11:44] All right. So Matt wants to know if
[01:11:46] we're looking for shorts.
[01:11:49] Uh no,
[01:11:51] no, we're just going to buy it our time.
[01:11:53] This is going to be a sideways chop if
[01:11:55] anything and uh not a big correction
[01:12:00] of 20%.
[01:12:02] So I think it's just a bad use of mental
[01:12:05] energy and capital. I think you just sit
[01:12:09] tight on low leverage, ride it out, and
[01:12:12] finish the year with a smile so wide you
[01:12:14] could eat two bananas sideways.
[01:12:22] Regarding management, this is from
[01:12:24] unknown. Regarding management claims and
[01:12:26] forecast, how do you gauge when to trust
[01:12:28] this fully? To what degree turnaround
[01:12:30] situations with new management? I look
[01:12:31] at their track record. I only bet on
[01:12:33] winners. So, um or if it's such a great
[01:12:36] business that a loser could run it. But,
[01:12:39] um
[01:12:40] that that's really the most important
[01:12:42] thing. Have have they done what they
[01:12:44] said they were going to do in the past?
[01:12:46] And if so, I'll give them the benefit of
[01:12:48] the doubt until the numbers don't prove
[01:12:49] it out. So, with that said, I want to
[01:12:51] thank everyone for tuning in. We'll be
[01:12:52] back next week, same time, same place.
[01:12:54] In the meantime, make it a great one.
[01:12:56] Bye for now.
