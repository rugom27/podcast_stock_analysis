  "cleaned_transcript": "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nexpect that Trend to to resume after the calendar turns Ash yeah the the Santa rally has been a big belly flop has it not I&#39;ve got one minute left Thomas a record $1 trillion was invested into ETFs this year do you expect that Trend to continue well the last peak of passive ETFs uh inflows was 2021 which implies it often happens at the exact wrong time I think what you&#39;re going to see is the weights that make up those passive indices are going to underperform the mag 7 uh versus verus the rest of the market broadening start to outperform as a matter of fact value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 the only exception which is why we&#39;re stuck with recency bias The Only Exception was the zero interest rate policy decade since 2010 so unless you believe we&#39;re going back to zero interest rate policy you want to add some cheaper value into your portfolio as the turns Ash terrific advice we&#39;ll have to leave it there but Thomas thank you so much for joining us today thanks for having me and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith and Brian sazy on Yahoo finance going into the last shall be first theme for 2025 want to thank Justin Oliver and Kayla Hawkins for having me on uh we&#39;re going to listen in here the healthc care and material sectors are two of the worst performing sectors on the S&amp;P 500 in 2024 our next guest says now though is the perfect time to take a look at what to expect from them in 2025 Thomas Hayes great Hill Capital chairman and managing member joins us now happy holidays to you thanks so much for hopping on Yahoo finance with us so you&#39;re banking on a bounce back here potentially with these two sectors why is that yeah Brad thank you for having me I I think the theme for 2025 is going to be the last shall be first if you look at Healthcare it&#39;s up basically 3 4% year to date relative to the S&amp;P some 25% uh but and with materials up 1.8% year to dat very anemic returns but when the calendar turns something is going to change and that&#39;s called earnings growth as a matter of fact Healthcare and materials are in the top four earnings growth expected for 2025 Healthcare is expected to grow earnings 20.6% materials is going to grow earnings 17.4% which exceeds the S&amp;P 500 at 14% And you know Brad if if we look at healthc care there&#39;s some some strange things happening uh but kind of predictable we saw a similar situation in 2016 right after Donald Trump was elected Healthcare and biotech sold off if you remember he was going to tear up the Affordable Care Act and the market got nervous shortly after the inauguration healthare rallied biotech rallied as a matter of fact Healthcare was up around 40% in 2017 biotech around 75% after selling off after the election uh and then rallying after the inauguration I think now it&#39;s not the Affordable Care Act it&#39;s RFK Jr&#39;s got people a little bit on edge and I think it&#39;s a a case of sell the rumor by the news it won&#39;t be quite as bad as people are expecting on the healthcare front what about the materials uh Thomas good to good to see you as always aren&#39;t tows going to be bad for this sector yeah I I think it&#39;s it&#39;s more than advertised I think this is a negotiating tactic uh if you look at materials it has the lowest relative performance to the S&amp;P 500 since 2020 and then going all all the way back to 2001 these were both generational buy opportunities in the material sector and speaking of which Brian uh the material sector if you look at xlb did the exact same thing in 2016 remember he ran as the Tariff King they sold off after the election they rallied in 2017 after the inauguration so we expect more of the same thing uh as it relates to uh just some of the technical stuff on this you know materials only 7% of the components are trading above their 50-day exponential moving average now I&#39;m not a big Tech technician by any stretch of the imagination but that tells you the sector is completely washed out and there&#39;s one player that we particularly like called albamar uh it&#39;s one of the largest lithium producers and if you know anything about lithium it&#39;s very cyclical right now it&#39;s at uh very low prices on the fears of a supply glut we do expect this uh imbalance to be rectified by the end of 2025 albam Maro is one of the biggest players they&#39;ve got $3.4 billion dollars of liquidity to wait it out while the smaller players will be crushed so uh we do think albam Maro is going to be a great play it&#39;s also down on the fear of softer maybe potential or perceived softer demand for EVS in the developed world yeah like United States like Europe however the EV game is all about China and that&#39;s an unnatural government subsidized market and that&#39;s expected to grow from 40 million stock globally 41 million stock of EVS globally right now to 132 Million by 2027 largely driven by China and the government subsidies to push that so that&#39;s going to help albam Maro and even prior to that you saw albam Maro could perform through all kinds of lithium prices high prices low prices Etc and this time will be no different Tom I got a Huston bar finish here but just lastly according to an SEC filing Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire bought $28.5 million in Varys sign stock an internet registry company that&#39;s been around since the do boom you know Buffett&#39;s moves lately he he&#39;s sitting on a lot of dry powder what do you make of that and how could it be deployed potentially where are the top areas he could deploy that in 2025 so ver sign is certainly a headline it&#39;s 91 basis points of the entire portfolio so you could see a lot of these moves are being made by the lieutenants Todd and Ted Buffett&#39;s got you know some 325 350 billion dollars of cash I think right now it&#39;s about preserving his his legacy going out like Seinfeld uh at the top of his game versus eeking out a few extra percentage points of returns uh he&#39;s got the greatest investor investor of all time in my view I think he&#39;s been cautious I think there&#39;s a buffet premium on the basis of sometime after he passes perhaps the sum of the parts is greater than the whole but Buffett never wanted the company broken up so that&#39;s going to take many years if ever to break up you&#39;re going to have to roll off a lot of the current board members before you see that type of makeup or before you see a material dividend which is something else people would talk about so I think right now it&#39;s preservation it&#39;s a Victory lap and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s going to effectively it&#39;s the law of large numbers it&#39;s going to effectively trade like S&amp;P index uh prospectively unless they can really hunt down an elephant before his passing and buy a very large high growth business at a reasonable price uh which is not looking like a high probability event in the coming years Thomas a always appreciate the insights happy holidays talk to you soon thank you thanks for having me Brian and Brad all right all your mark and we&#39;re back and then\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\naccording to an SEC filing Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire bought $28.5 million in Varys sign stock an internet registry company that&#39;s been around since the do boom you know Buffett&#39;s moves lately he he&#39;s sitting on a lot of dry powder what do you make of that and how could it be deployed potentially where are the top areas he could deploy that in 2025 so ver sign is certainly a headline it&#39;s 91 basis points of the entire portfolio so you could see a lot of these moves are

buffet premium on the basis of sometime after he passes perhaps the sum of the parts is greater than the whole but Buffett never wanted the company broken up so that&#39;s going to take many years if ever to break up you&#39;re going to have to roll off a lot of the current board members before you see that type of makeup or before you see a material dividend which is something else people would talk about so I think right now it&#39;s preservation it&#39;s a Victory lap and um uh it&#39;s it&#39;s going to effectively it&#39;s the law of large numbers it&#39;s going to effectively trade like S&P index uh prospectively unless they can really hunt down an elephant before his passing and buy a very large high growth business at a reasonable price uh which is not looking like a high probability event in the coming years\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nThomas you like healthc care and materials uh let's begin with xbi it's a biotech ETF why do you like it well Ash I think the theme for 2025 is going to be the last shall be first and materials has only performed 1.8% up year-to date just 1.8% relative to the S&P up some 25% and the expected earnings growth for materials for 2025 is 17.4% that exceeds the S&P 14% so I think there's going to be a reversal here I think there's going to be an opportunity and we saw a very similar thing in 2016 right after Donald Trump was elected materials sold off right after he was inaugurated materials rallied for 2017 and the way we want to express that Ash is with a company called albam Maro and albam Maro is one of the leading lithium providers and it's really sold off it's down 72% from its covid highs and it's sold off on the on the basis of a lithium short-term lithium glut which is a very sick cyclical and the perception that EV demand is going down which it's softened in North America and Europe but China is driving the bus on EV demand because it's an unnatural government subsidized market and the stock of Eves is expected to grow from 41 million now to 132 Million by 2027 so they'll just cut cost they'll ride out the short-term glut and as one of the biggest players with 3.4 billion of liquidity they'll be just fine and the second group we like is healthc care which is only up 3.7% year-to date they're going to grow earnings 20% and the way we're expressing that is through biotech xbi uh this is all about deals and drugs a deregulatory environment with the new Administration the FDA will approve more drugs the FTC will approve more deals and Pharma needs that innovation with record cash on the balance sheet they're going to have to buy that Innovation from biotech at near low historic low valuations so there's going to be great opportunities in biotech and Healthcare I feel uh I feel the bullishness in the air Thomas thank you so much for joining us really good information Thomas Hayes on some of the areas you may want to consider in the new year\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nmaterial stocks percentage above the 20-day exponential moving average down to zero that is a buy time that's what you see when they're absolutely in the gutter so we have our albam maros and and so on we're going to talk a little bit about that healthc care stocks which we talked about with Ash Webster again and with Brad Brad and Brian uh they got down to 5% above their 20 day exponential moving average these are always dips to buy not to sell um and you know nothing's foolproof but we're in the probabilities business Dow intermediate term breath momentum that's getting stretched to the downside uh time to take opportunity    here's the S&P 500 mlen summation index again towards areas where there's opportunity could go a little lower for sure pmo buy all down to zero uh that's a percentage of uh S&P 500 on uh crossover buy signals it doesn't really matter what that is what what matters is where it's at and at zero the risk rewards are in your favor same with pmo by Dow Jones down to 15 same with pmo by SPX down to 10 you know this is where you get these awesome opportunities to buy great businesses at a discount  a bullish percent S&P 500 that's pretty extreme could potentially go a little lower first because of the weights of some of the tech stocks you saw Apple down pretty pretty meaningfully today Nazi NASDAQ mlen summation index kind of middle of the range so the NASDAQ ones   probably could push further down whereas some of the Dow and nysse and value seem to be in a position where there's opportunity   let's go into our charts here I'm going to give us a little bit more size so everyone can see everything   stocks have done quite well in the first year of a new term lately this is from Ryan Dietrich so you can see here the Biden term was up 26% the first year of his term Trump up 19% Obama up 29% Obama up 23%   bush in 2001 was down 13 but pretty much everyone until you go all the way back into the 70s when Nixon Carter and the first term of Reagan were Troublesome but rates were also 18% in   81   and vula was   tamping them down Ryan Dietrich S&P 500 up about 20 8 okay we've only had we only had an 88.5% Peak to trough pullback all year so you can see how that registers   relative to all of the previous years the average correction average year sees a 14.2% correction which increases the odds it might be might happen next year    that is skewed by the years that you have 20 and 30 for sure but   I definitely and I've been saying we will probably get a 10% correction   a 10 to 15% correction maybe one or two and that'll just be opportunities and you just ride them out but as far as is the bull market over and is is everything going to go to hell the answer is   not yet and and and not not really anytime soon I do think we'll get some 20% pullback   Corrections and 25% Corrections like 87   like Co Etc but I think this is going to run you've got 12,000 people turning 35 years old every single day in the United States those demographics are going to shine for at least another five six seven eight years into the early 2030s where I start to get aggressively worried    but in the meantime it's buying things with a margin of safety so I don't have to worry about the shortterm pullbacks or rotations or anything else because I know what I own and when they turn it comes all at once so   M2 money supplies turning up that works in our favor here's from Seth golden as a Perma bear you're truly awaiting one shiny moment average duration of a bar Market is 446 days average duration of a bull market is 269 days average bare Market is -35 average bull market is plus 209%   if you choose bull you'll endure any bare Market that's for sure and what he's showing\n\nthe first year of his term Trump up 19% Obama up 29% Obama up 23% uh bush in 2001 was down 13 but pretty much everyone until you go all the way back into the 70s when Nixon Carter and the first term of Reagan were Troublesome but rates were also 18% in uh 81 uh and vula was uh tamping them down Ryan Dietrich S&P 500 up about 20 8 okay we've only had we only had an 88.5% Peak to trough pullback all year so you can see how that registers uh relative to all of the previous years the average correction average year sees a 14.2% correction which increases the odds it might be might happen next year um that is skewed by the years that you have 20 and 30 for sure but uh I definitely and I've been saying we will probably get a 10% correction uh a 10 to 15% correction maybe one or two and that'll just be opportunities and you just ride them out but as far as is the bull market over and is is everything going to go to hell the answer is uh not yet and and and not not really anytime soon I do think we'll get some 20% pullback uh Corrections and 25% Corrections like 87 uh like Co Etc but I think this is going to run you've got 12,000 people turning 35 years old every single day in the United States those demographics are going to shine for at least another five six seven eight years into the early 2030s where I start to get aggressively worried um but in the meantime it's buying things with a margin of safety so I don't have to worry about the shortterm pullbacks or rotations or anything else because I know what I own and when they turn it comes all at once so uh M2 money supplies turning up that works in our favor here's from Seth golden as a Perma bear you're truly awaiting one shiny moment average duration of a bar Market is 446 days average duration of a bull market is 269 days average bare Market is -35 average bull market is plus 209% um if you choose bull you'll endure any bare Market that's for sure and what he's showing here is  that um uh you know basically also the other thing to keep in mind is this bull market is relatively new in the scheme of uh we had the 25% correction in 2022 which was a recession too everyone waiting for a recession we just had two in four years you usually have one in four years so we pulled forward a recession uh very hard to have a recession with 2 and A2 to 3% GDP growth so that's off the table which which in theory uh pretty much takes a 25% correction off the table as well even usually a 20% correction unless you have just some short-term dislocation for a week or something like that um so with the average duration of a bull market is 269 days and we've been going since uh the fall of 2022 when we were pounding the table uh you know you're basically 700 days in so you're less than half of the way there and I think that's a reasonable way to look at it Santa rally since 2000 we we will see I think tomorrow comes into play last year we did not have the Santa rally and we had a great year so all that January effect and predicting the future is kind of not terribly useful\n\nbasically also the other thing to keep in mind is this bull market is relatively new in the scheme of uh we had the 25% correction in 2022 which was a recession too everyone waiting for a recession we just had two in four years you usually have one in four years so we pulled forward a recession uh very hard to have a recession with 2 and A2 to 3% GDP growth so that&#39;s off the table which which in theory uh pretty much takes a 25% correction off the table as well even usually a 20% correction unless you have just some short-term dislocation for a week or something like that um so with the average duration of a bull market is 269 days and we&#39;ve been going since uh the fall of 2022 when we were pounding the table\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nJapanese bond yields and I emphasized uh aggressively in last week&#39;s podcast that the number one thing you need to watch as it relates to the Magnificent 7 is not whether the FTC is coming for them it&#39;s whether the bank of Japan is unwinding the carry trade knowingly or unknowingly by um raising rates to quell Rising inflation and you started to see these uh rickety uh wobbliness in mag 7 and in the last handful of sessions and what that&#39;s been coincident with uh and I would say causal to uh you know everyone&#39;s here saying oh it&#39;s pension rebalancing and all that and yes t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nJapanese bond yields and I emphasized uh aggressively in last week's podcast that the number one thing you need to watch as it relates to the Magnificent 7 is not whether the FTC is coming for them it's whether the bank of Japan is unwinding the carry trade knowingly or unknowingly by um raising rates to quell Rising inflation and you started to see these uh rickety uh wobbliness in mag 7 and in the last handful of sessions and what that's been coincident with uh and I would say causal to uh you know everyone's here saying oh it's pension rebalancing and all that and yes\n\nsome of that but watch the jgb yields because as that Japanese money gets more expensive the carry trade becomes less profitable all that free money has been parked in mag 7 they were getting the benefits of currency depre apption of the Yen uh appreciation of the dollar and stability of Mag 7 as rates go up that trade becomes less attractive and the money gets out hot money like nobody&#39;s business uh so that is the number one chart you should be looking at every single day when you wake up is the jgb yields as yields go up the odds of Mag 7 holding on to the waiting they have and the flows they have uh get cut in half very very quickly 21 uh us pensions to sell $21 billion of equities okay so that&#39;s the the US Centric view of uh any wobbliness S&P performance after gaining more than 35% in the last 12 months from October so you look one month out you have some negative returns 3 months out you&#39;re up 3% 6 months out you&#39;re up 3% and 12 months out you&#39;re up 13.8% I think that&#39;s a reasonable expectation for the indices this year uh given expected underperformance of Mag 7 uh between 8 and 133% and under the surface making money all day long Seth golden no no way to Sugar Cod it first year of Republican Le Administration is on average not good for equities extremely Stark difference from Democrat uh Trump 1.0 bucked the trend in 2017 can it happen again with tax act 2.0 we&#39;re going to find out really soon I think on balance they&#39;re going to give him the benefit of the doubt again and it&#39;s going to be an okay year for sure maybe not for mag 7 as mag 7 did less well under Trump 1.0 uh on balance but still did fine small cap and large cap earnings estimates into next year now this is the Russell 2000 if you look at small uh S&P 600 it&#39;s a little different but for Russell 2000 this is from fact set they&#39;re showing 57% earnings growth for the Russell 2000 small caps versus the S&P 500 of 14 to 15 % that&#39;s as of December 10th if you look at the small cap 6 S&P 600 it&#39;s more like 21% but the fact of the matter is you pay less you get more more earnings growth for lower multiple and that&#39;s why that rotation to have no fear the broadening rally will reappear uh we feel very confident in that Viewpoint halfway through the rolling roiling 20s uh S&P performance since the start of the decade uh and I think that&#39;s that gives us another five years of Runway there CFO optimism is rising that is a um that that historically has a forward-looking ability forcasting ability as that consumer conf as that CFO optimism Rises off despondent lows like we saw in the 2022 and 2020 recessions uh equities tend to follow and I think this time will be no different ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ndollar Index after Trump election we have emphasized this over and over as everyone&#39;s panicked about the 10year Y yield and the dollar destroying everything and all the plans with emerging markets and everything else uh we said now that Trump has elected expect this the same thing happened in 2016 for you know month and a half after he was uh elected through to inauguration the dollar went up yields went up after the inauguration after the turn of the calendar they all collapsed dollar dollar rolled completely over just like you see in this chart same thing with the 10-year yield Emerging Markets rallied biotech rallied the whole story so we&#39;re pretty excited about that and one of the reasons that we are super enthusiastic about 2025 got delayed a couple of months with the election result we had no way to predict the election winner uh uh nor were we trying and uh we wouldn&#39;t have changed a thing even if we knew the outcome because one it creates uh unnecessary tax events two um you can look at an analog to get a sense of what might happen but to gamble on it exactly repeating is a Fool&#39;s errand that what we have is a beautiful portfolio of amazing businesses that we know everything about uh in concentrated form we have a huge margin of safe we&#39;ve got turnaround catalysts with CEOs and and durable businesses and plans forward we&#39;ve got solvency risk removed from from pretty much all of them uh if not all of them and uh and and the turnaround in place from the dto to the restock cycle so we couldn&#39;t be more excited we just had to eat six weeks of volatility uh after the election and now we&#39;re going to get the benefit of the rewards holding tight and using those opportunities to uh be topping up everywhere we Poss possibly could uh it&#39;s been a very busy holiday season and super excited some of the folks that came in last uh week after the podcast called they already got approved we put a lot of money to work today we&#39;re going to put a lot of money to work in the next few days as more of those applications are approved at at interactive brokers and uh and and uh all the client existing clients new clients are going to be beautifully set up early right before the inauguration for all these great things things to unfold um and then we&#39;ll close out sometime well before the inauguration in the next week or two uh so here we go PE ratios uh percent okay cortile so this is from hbert ratings Mark hbert he he writes with data with a pretty much chronically bearish tilt historically uh which is good you want to have the counterbalance of the data so he&#39;ll just find data to support a bearish view pretty consistently over the decades and he&#39;s a well-respected journalist uh in the industry so here what he&#39;s saying is uh you know we&#39;re in the top 92nd percentile in terms of PE ratio 96 percentile in terms of Cape 98th and dividend yield 100th uh in price to sales 100th in Price to Book so so what he&#39;s basically saying is based on these valuations we are going to correct and we&#39;re going to die he&#39;s had the similar uh data in each of the last three years as well maybe this year he&#39;ll be right but I think he&#39;ll be right in a concentrated portion of the market um in the areas that we&#39;re trafficking you know they&#39;ve really taken out uh you know at some point it you know it&#39;s so cheap to own such a high quality portfolio of assets some point they&#39;re almost paying you to take them it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mindboggling it really is exciting what what this once in a 100y year event with covid created in terms of generational opportunities to buy unbelievable businesses marked down on sale and you know I you know I I talked to some of you and they&#39;re like wow I love your I love your optimism it&#39;s not optimism you you will find periods in in uh in future years where I will be I will sound like uh David Rosenberg and Mark Wilson&#39;s cubed uh I&#39;ll be the most negative person on the street it&#39;s just not the right time that that&#39;s the bottom line and um uh when that time occurs we we will be there I I am agnostic to being bullish or bears obviously you&#39;re going to be bullish you&#39;re going to make a lot more money over time being bullish I&#39;ve I&#39;ve only met I used to say I never met a wealthy an extremely wealthy uh Perma Perma pessimist uh I do know one uh but he&#39;s made most of his money you know selling pessimism versus uh versus uh El other otherwise but uh you know he&#39;s built a great business doing that but that&#39;s the exception not the rule on balance you want to be an optimist you want to see opportun you know pessimists look for the difficulty in the opportunity OPP uh optimists look for opportunity and the difficulty and that&#39;s where all the money is so uh not only um do value and growth rotate over the years but International versus us this is from RIT Holtz um uh this shows the rotation from International Equity outperformance to us equity outperformance and as you can see in the zero interest rate policy that began in 2010 what happened from 2010 until zerp ended in 2022 us dramatically outperformed International by an order by a level of um outperformance that we haven&#39;t seen since 1995 to 1999 and then prior to that 89 to 93 and then prior to that 79 to 83 but if you look at these Cycles they usually only last four years four years four years 5 years here we had this extended cycle of 10 years because of the aberrational zero interest rate policy that favors um favored US Stocks among other things and if you believe that we are going back to zero interest rate policy then you should continue to bet exclusively on the US but if you believe that this is a normal cycle and that International could start to outperform like we&#39;ve seen early signs of uh the last two years just like we saw early signs of in 2021 2022 uh 2001 and 2002 before you had dramatic outperformance from 2003 to 2007 dramatic outperformance from 92 to 95 dramatic outperformance of international from 1983 Reagan 1.0 to 1989 dramatic outperformance from 1976 to 1979 dramatic outperformance of international from 1970 to 1973 so every 4 years so maybe you could see a situation where if I&#39;m right about the terminal rate and we don&#39;t go any lower than 3.5 I think we&#39;re going to be terminal rate is going to be somewhere between 3.5 and four even if we went to three but we don&#39;t go anywhere near zero uh that we could see the next four years cycle like early Reagan where International like early Bush where International dramatically outperformed the us and what does that mean it means the top 10 stocks that make up 40% of the index uh start to materially underperform and I think that is coming uh a historic boom in Immigration average annual change in forign Born population is a share of the total US population so we added 2 million in the last three years that is the highest since the 1850s um so that&#39;s that at least we&#39;re still getting population growth uh we can debate what type of population growth is best but we can&#39;t debate that we need population growth so so uh I&#39;ll leave it at that um putting 2024 in perspective so again the average pullback around 14% been anemic we did have a big one in uh 2022 we had a big one in 2020 a big one in 2018 so you see all this stuff but actually in uh 2016 2017 2019 so um so that&#39;s that month L return stats for the S&P 500 since 1964 January is a good month um it is positive 58% of the time with the average return of 1.1% what are the worst ones I think everyone kind of knows uh September&#39;s the worst month February&#39;s February&#39;s uh one of the worst months August so so on balance you get cautious if things are really hot into August September on balance you get cautious if things are really hot through January February tends to be a little bit of Rocky before picking up in March and April before the sell and man go away and then things turn up after September uh mid October uh but January on balance tends to be a small cap fundamental Tailwind again this is just reemphasizing the earnings grow growth that we&#39;ve talked about small caps in blue relative uh big earnings growth I guess this is the russle again talking about 40 42% earnings growth 30% earnings growth 53% earnings growth 60% earnings growth 49 quarter by quarter that&#39;s the Russell 2000 that&#39;s a little skewed by the percentage of companies that are not earning that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been going by the small cap 600 which has a higher percentage of earning companies which is 21% earnings growth but at the end of the day you&#39;re still paying 156 times versus 23 22 23 times for 14% growth for the regular indices net integration is already fallen uh solid real income growth should remain a key pillar of consumer spending growth uh that&#39;s from Goldman Sachs we expect GDP growth of 2.4% in 2025 vers uh to beat the consensus forecast of 2.0 supported by solid private domestic demand growth that&#39;s from uh Goldman Sachs here&#39;s the seasonality uh since the last 20 years December you tend to get a little bit of rockiness at the end a little bump up early January mid January week uh let&#39;s see here and then strong into the end of January weak in February as we discussed straight up into May a little rockiness strong into July weak in August September member and then straight up so it&#39;s just good to have these road maps it doesn&#39;t mean they repeat but there&#39;s a tendency to rhyme and if you know the lay of the land it puts you ahead of the pack record dividend outflows to add pressures to currency this is dividends paid by Hong Kong listed Chinese firms we&#39;ll talk about that um I think the big story is t\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nJanuary on balance tends to be a small cap fundamental Tailwind again this is just reemphasizing the earnings grow growth that we've talked about small caps in blue relative uh big earnings growth I guess this is the russle again talking about 40 42% earnings growth 30% earnings growth 53% earnings growth 60% earnings growth 49 quarter by quarter that's the Russell 2000 that's a little skewed by the percentage of companies that are not earning that's why I've been going by the small cap 600 which has a higher percentage of earning companies which is 21% earnings growth but at the end of the day you're still paying 156 times versus 23 22 23 times for 14% growth for the regular indices net integration is already fallen uh solid real income growth should remain a key pillar of consumer spending growth uh that's from Goldman Sachs we expect GDP growth of 2.4% in 2025 vers uh to beat the consensus forecast of 2.0 supported by solid private domestic demand growth that's from uh Goldman Sachs here's the seasonality uh since the last 20 years December you tend to get a little bit of rockiness at the end a little bump up early January mid January week uh let's see here and then strong into the end of January weak in February as we discussed straight up into May a little rockiness strong into July weak in August September member and then straight up so it's just good to have these road maps it doesn't mean they repeat but there's a tendency to rhyme and if you know the lay of the land it puts you ahead of the pack record dividend outflows to add pressures to currency this is dividends paid by Hong Kong listed Chinese firms we'll talk about that um I think the big story is t\n\nthe Chinese are doing the exact same thing they did in 2016 which is devalue currency ahead of the trade War so it's a Net Zero Effect to them because they manipulated their currency downward so if he adds tariffs um because of their weakened currency it will have no inflationary effect therefore it won't affect the volume for them and uh and they win um and it hurts the us because the dollar is stronger and makes us makes it harder for us to export things globally so um so that's that's what's going on there and then after the sell the rumors there buy the news when it's less bad than and than advertised then they can normalize the currency and um and everything Rock and rolls and you see years you see Baba that time 2016 we'll just show you again for the newer listeners um after it sold off following the election you had a basic doubling in the next year let's get that back up and get that back up there we go I'm back just got to move that around so I can get this and show you guys a preview of coming attractions so here was Baba big selloff after the election dropped from uh looks like about 100 down to 84 not dissimilar from what we just saw and then after the turn of the calendar and certainly after the inauguration you saw big strength went from $84 a share to $187 a share uh in 11 months doesn't mean it's going to repeat but I would anticipate it's going to somewhat rhyme babo is up 10% for the year this year uh moving in the right direction but it's time to get paid uh it's time for clients to get a huge payday and uh existing clients new clients and get you know Monster IR inside of 12 months and um and that's how it works I mean for the strategy for a mean reversion strategy you just you wait and you wait and then you get you know just monstrous amounts of stuff all at once uh and and then you know you uh you do this exact same thing you reinvest you wait and then you get another monstrous amount and I've been doing this for a long long time and when you have a a a portfolio that has zero correlation to the general indices unlike many active managers that are just closet indexers collecting fees whether it goes up or down but actually doing work and buying great businesses that you would want to own the whole thing and then you wait for the market to realize what you see uh it's just it's like Christmas for you know those periods you make you make a DEC you can make literally a decade's worth of money in in one year when you get these things uh all coming together at once so this this is what we saw in Trump and and uh here was kweb same story doubled um equal weight did well just all this stuff all this nonsense after the election solar solar stocks almost doubled after a disaster uh selloff before the inauguration uh biotech same story and then off to the races the only thing that did really terribly was uh energy stocks but I'm not sure that will be the case I think some of the servicers can do okay materials same story so look we've gone through this I I just wanted to reemphasize that for new people and understand I'm enthusiastic for a reason not to be enthusiastic I can be more pessimistic than anyone in the room when it's time to be more pessimistic than anyone in the room I don't think it's time if I was fully concentrated in mag 7 I'd be a little bit nervous I got to be honest with you I'd be very nervous uh not because I think they're going to crash not because I don't think the businesses are awesome not because I don't believe in AI I do I use it uh but um uh the the future that the market prices instantaneously often takes a lot longer to play out than anticipated so the markets tend to think it's going to be 3 to five years the reality is it's usually 15 to 20 but the Market's right um except that the bag holders that buy the three to 5e story wind up with the 80% draw Downs uh and uh even though they got the long-term thesis one 100% correct they paid for the long-term thesis being fulfilled in the present and it was going to take 20 years to happen and they thought it was going to take three years so that's all I'm saying Bull and bare markets this shows msci World um this this is just a different way of showing the underperformance versus the outperformance by JP Morgan International is due value is due Etc Regional earnings expectations you can see uh China for next year is going to grow about double digits it's trading at single digits uh emerging markets at you know 13 14% us at 13 14% the differen is for us you pay 23 24 times for us for emerging markets in certainly for China you pay high single digits for similar earnings growth world uh going to grow 12 12 time uh 12% and you're paying you know a third less multiple for that earnings growth us Equity Market faces un unprecedented concentration at the top top eight stocks 35.7 last highest concentration 200000 so I continue to just remind you of this I'm not calling for a 2,000 Tech rec I don't think that's happening because they have earnings power I'm calling for a d rating of multiples uh in those baskets that are frothy uh while exposure to commodity sectors near is near low so we have our albamar we have our com stock thank you for all the kind tweets over the week uh lot many of you have doubled your money uh on that and uh we think that's just getting started but kudos to those who took chips off the table doubles are good things and congratulations uh long only exposure to financials increased but still has still light versus history so that's turning up uh we continue to look for opportunities to get back in but we have um we took a lot of profits in city and BAC over the summer they haven't gone up much since so that was basically dead money uh which was the right thing for us to do to take that off and buy things that were cheaper but we'll look for opportunities we still have exposure through PayPal which is up you know went from whatever it was 60 to 90 but that's pulling back a little bit we're going to stay with that for a while uh Market breath bad breath returns uh monthly Market breath is on Pace to hit an all-time low in December this was a big deal ladies and gentlemen and you haven't seen this bad of Market breath since the top of the 2000 Tech W which is why I um I would be very concerned if I was in just indices or instruments or single stocks that are concentrated and correlated uh or actually the mag 7 um it just doesn't bode well when you have that extreme waiting everyone's crowded into it and um and you're not going back to a zero interest rate policy environment uh you know you can you can play again you can bet against the odds and maybe you get another year where you're right but um I always just bet with the odds and and uh do it with low leverage and sooner or later it turns out and we mean revert and then when it turns it's just like overnight riches it's it's it's exciting but um uh we're not there yet but I think we're very very very close uh earnings growth is expected to broaden in 2025 arguing for a broader rally we agree so last year it was somewhat Justified 36% earnings growth for the mag 7 4% for the rest of the index this year 19% for the mag 7 but you're paying 34 times versus 133% for the rest of the market which you're only paying 18 times there you go ladies price is what you pay value is what you get gentlemen as well number of stocks shrinking since the late 1990s this is exciting this means there's less supply for more money chasing it don't worry Wall Street knows how to feed the Ducks when they're quacking you will see a ton of IPOs in the next couple of years that does not Mark a quote unquote top uh I'd be a little bit more cautious in 2026 and certainly 2027 but as far as like a secular uh everyone screwed you know 2009 or 2000 or 73 I I think that's five six seven eight years off uh hedge fund positioning this shows exposure to cyclicals versus defensives is at a record low uh their tendency is to be wrong uh so you want to take the other side which is more uh cyclical which are being given away right now the longest and shortest sectors uh basically energy is the most shorted sector right now which is why we continue despite having exposure through Comstock which has been amazing uh look for more opportunities I think we're going to probably wind up having to buy a serer but it may not be a full position materials is an easier one to get more excited about second most shorted lot of opportunities to do there we've got albam Maro um maybe we'll get more but the problem is is the other thing is not only were we not correlated with the indices but we don't like to place too many bets that are effectively the same bet uh and um so you know you look at some of the Dow chemicals you look at some of the uh uh chemical stocks relative to albam Maro we want to get more exposure but we have to be careful that we W don't wind up with too much waiting in what is effectively the same trade um and then the least shorted is Healthcare and Staples so we'll keep an eye on that uh super micro most shorted stock Walmart Walmart is the least shorted stock that's interesting and not really useful information here are the most highest net exposure by head hedge funds lowest net exposure so none of them want Brown Forman albaro pool Corp Charter so here's your buy list Hershey uh [Music] Mna you know none of these are pounding the table but they the they're ones that I would definitely pay attention to Southwest Chevron Okay so that's that uh long only funds exposure to cyclical versus defensive also at all-time lows last time that happened was 2015 right before Trump was in and what what outperformed cyclicals after Trump got elected so there you go I mean again the these things you just have to be observant you don't have to be a genius you literally just have to pay attention and um you know live through enough cycles and have enough experience to say yes odds are in my favor I can't guaranteed I you know I don't have a crystal ball but when things are lined up like that uh that's how you can outperform over time is doing what the crowd's not doing and just doing it with low leverage so if you're quote wrong or what idiots say Traders day traders that live in their mom's basement early is wrong to have the fantasy that you're going to time it perfectly all you need to do is buy a quality business with a large enough margin of safety hopefully there's a catalyst you can see that it happens sooner rather than later cuz irr matters but if you have a basket of 8 or 12 some happen very very quick some take a little bit longer but on balance you're going to do just fine and um and and the the thing about it is it's not going to be linear it's not going to be you know every year a stair step up when you're doing uncorrelated business it's like you grind and then you have these that are just boom I mean it's just literally off the chart so um so you have to be accepting of that some people want to you know want to uh every week make money or every month make money and then after a couple years they give it all back to the casino uh have fun with that but if you buy businesses and you do private equity in the public markets you'd be willing to buy the whole business uh it's just an awesome way to live that's all I can tell you uh last 3 months long only's added exposure to financials chased them up decreased exposure to energy sold in the hole so that's why you know we've got to consider looking for more opportunity in energy uh despite having a good position uh continuing to be a alert for an asymmetric opportunity and that's the problem I'm just not finding asymmetric where I can make multiples of my money not get into it because I can make a 20 or 40% punt I'm not interested in that uh which is why I was so pissed when they were going to sell gxo at 60 or 70 bucks uh I didn't get in for 60 or 70 bucks I got in for 100 minimum uh and it could be a lot more if they continue to execute which we're going to talk about today most crowded stock in each sector like this is really valuable stuff I love this stuff I mean we'll be here for six hours if I go through all this which I'm perfectly happy to do but um some of you uh have other things to do and I don't want your two two mile walk to turn into a 20 mile walk and uh you wind up in another state so uh hedge funds have decreed exposure to Staples this year uh I think there's some opportunities popping up in Staples believe it or not all styles are underweight Staples so that's where some opportunity is you look at the Hershey's you look to a lesser extent at coca colola you look at some of these I'm seeing Staples pop up long which means rates are going down by the way I know no one believes that we're going to 5% we're not hang in there ladies and gentlemen long only the Hedge font exposure to energy is low versus history uh decrease exposure to materials of course that's where the opportunity is now underweight real estate uh all styles are underweight real estate sustained value run why okay so this is sa Savita saberian sagita I'm getting her name wrong but you know who she is she's wonderful she's always on the the networks uh Fox Business CNBC uh she's a strategist at Bank of America so she's saying large cap is the best large kep value is the best hedge against duration risk cheap stocks outperform when profits pick up with expectations limited to periods of negative risk premum after decade of capital depriving dinging consolidation and balance sheet repair the Russell 1,000 value index quality is neck and neck with growth statistics favor value cheap neglected no concentration R risk high PE dispersion but this has been true for a while of course it doesn't work till it works uh how does it not work you Return To Zero interest rate policy which we're not going to do that implies a depression uh q no growth no inflation value very unlikely under Trump value and growth now neck and deck in terms of quality uh value stocks remain competitively pric priced versus credit 84 stocks 84% of stocks in the Russell 1000 value index offer excess earnings yields I.E EPS yield minus 10year real treasury yield above investment grade Bond spread uh this is what I talked about with Ash Webster value did not work during zero interest rate policy uh that was really the exception to the rule ladies and gentlemen and we're going to get into some data in just a second uh on average value outperforms growth by 4.4% in the last decade you you if you asked 50 people on the street uh what does better over time growth or value 49 out of 50 uh are going to say growth only only growth you got to buy growth you got to buy growth AI man it's changing the world you know 3 years ago it was SAS before that it was internet of things you know the new flavor of the week but that is the exception not the rule okay and the rule is since 1927 value outperforms growth buying quality businesses at low prices is how you make a fortune if you look at the Forbes 400 and all the guys that manage money who are actually on it there's only one growth manager it's called Ron Baron and he got uh had this company called Tesla that he bet on in the early days and he stuck with and made unbelievable returns he's the only growth manager that I've ever seen that had durable uh performance over over time and if you look at the growth managers who do well it's usually concentrated in one stock um live and die um but the guys on the forest 400 who manage money they they're all value guys I mean that's just the bottom line so whether it's Buffett gelly cooperman uh Tepper icon there's a reason for it ladies and gentlemen so uh value St value trades at an extreme discount to growth on a Ford PE so you know if I'm just coming out of school and I just read the intelligent investor I I I wake up in the morning and I feel like I stepped in you know what like how lucky can you get you're in this generational opportunity where value is going to start to dramatically\n\nin the Russell 1000 value index offer excess earnings yields I.E EPS yield minus 10year real treasury yield above investment grade Bond spread uh this

generational opportunity where value is going to start to dramatically\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  outperform growth it&#39;s two standard deviations belong the long-term mean the the per uh value relative to growth the last time it got this low was uh the early 2000s and then you had a period of seven years of dramatic outperformance of uh value worth is versus growth so you know if you&#39;re getting into the business in uh 2010 or 2011 and you were just or you know 92 and you you got the value bug you had to wait a while until started to outperform uh last time before 2001 where it was just a generational opportunity to start buying value Was 1980 in 1981 the beginning of the Reagan Administration after they were taking rates down just like they did in last 12 months and then for the next 10 years value dramatically outperformed so here we are ladies and gentlemen and uh No One Believes it and and that&#39;s what it has to be in order for it to be that great and um here on every metric price versus book uh price versus sales you don&#39;t get these value these relative valuations you get them once every 20 years and you got to make hey while the sunshines and I think the next six seven years we&#39;re going to make be able to make more money in a shorter period of time than has ever been done in a very in a generation and that&#39;ll be it and you know uh you know we&#39;ll raise a ton of cash in the early 2030s and uh look for some asymmetric bets but this is this is going to be the most exciting 5 six seven years for a value investor that I think we&#39;ve seen in 20 years 40 years and then probably before that 60 years when Buffett started his career in the 50s uh and you had the same exact setup and Buffett often acknowledges I just got lucky when I started if you believe in this philosophy and framework and you&#39;re starting now either as a client or in the industry you couldn&#39;t be luckier and um so that&#39;s that uh price of sales\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally  outperform growth it&#39;s two standard deviations belong the long-term mean the the per uh value relative to growth the last time it got this low was uh the early 2000s and then you had a period of seven years of dramatic outperformance of uh value worth is versus growth so you know if you&#39;re getting into the business in uh 2010 or 2011 and you were just or you know 92 and you you got the value bug you had to wait a while until started to outperform uh last time before 2001 where it was just a generational opportunity to start buying value Was 1980 in 1981 the beginning of the Reagan Administration after they were taking rates down just like they did in last 12 months and then for the next 10 years value dramatically outperformed so here we are ladies and gentlemen and uh No One Believes it and and that&#39;s what it has to be in order for it to be that great and um here on every metric price versus book uh price versus sales you don&#39;t get these value these relative valuations you get them once every 20 years and you got to make hey while the sunshines and I think the next six seven years we&#39;re going to make be able to make more money in a shorter period of time than has ever been done in a very in a generation and that&#39;ll be it and you know uh you know we&#39;ll raise a ton of cash in the early 2030s and uh look for some

starting now either as a client or in the industry you couldn&#39;t be luckier and um so that&#39;s that uh price of sales here is\n\nvalue versus growth trough in 2021 if you remember the peak when you had Ark uh went parabolic and all these you know money losing companies were trading at crazy valuations that was the absolute peak of the crazy town that was still zurp before they started raising rates and since then we&#39;ve started to see the early stages of value uh starting to come to life and fits and starts and just like it did in uh this would have been 2000 equals 2021 and what&#39;s starting to happen and its early days six plus years it&#39;s going to be awesome then you can just see it in the bar chart here uh relative return of growth versus value and here you go uh in the years when value outperforms it outperforms so big and that&#39;s most years ladies and gentlemen I know it&#39;s so hard to believe because this right here this Zer period that I&#39;m showing you is an AB is the exception not the rule and because of recency bias everyone thinks it&#39;s the rule and they&#39;re going to get slaughtered I mean that&#39;s just it&#39;s just math you know there there laws of attract there there laws of physics there laws of Statistics there are laws of gravity there are different things and I&#39;m not I&#39;m the most bullish guy you it&#39;s it&#39;s a strange thing to be seeing this level of extreme and being so bullish because I&#39;m being selective on where I&#39;m being bullish you know the biggest Fortunes in the shortest amount of time were made in the 70s and the the general indices from 1968 to 1981 did 0% 0% in price and that&#39;s where Buffett made all his money gabelli made all his money cooperman made the whole value Mafia made billions of dollars during that period while the indices did nothing and the nifty50 got their asses reamed and the nifty50 back then is the equivalent of the mag 7 today uh the difference was the nifty50 was a company called Avon Cosmetics which just went basically bankrupt sold to Cody for nothing Tupperware IBM blah blah blah all the High Flyers that got smoked and never recovered so um anyway you could tell I&#39;m excited but look at this year by year value outperformed 81 133% 8 82 even 83 out performed by 12% 85 outperformed by 11% every year 5% outperformance 12% 9% 15% 29% outperformance after the tech uh peak in 2000 then you had look at this this is crazy 2000 this was when they put Buffett on the cover and say the old man has lost his touch I think it was Forbes or fortune or whatever because while everyone was buying Global Crossing and Enron he was buying uh caola and American Express and Bank of America and in 2000 when everyone was negative he was positive and here&#39;s what happened value outperformed by 29% 2001 value outperformed by 15% 2002 it outperformed by 12% 2004 outperformed by 10% outperformed by 2% outperformed by 13% and then zero interest rate policy kicked in and you had the swing to the pendulum uh but if you go back to 1927 this was really the only major exception uh except some part of the 60s where you had that level of outperformance during the nifty50 largest five stocks represent 27% you can see here visibly uh I&#39;m just trying to make a point ladies and gentlemen I hope you&#39;re getting it and I hope you extract value from it because it&#39;s important accelerating profits growth would historically favor value value is greater than growth when profits accelerate value performance during the profit cycle 82 to present and we&#39;re seeing uh the acceleration right now largest 7 S&P stocks trade at a 50% premium again this is reverting it&#39;s the beginning of the reversion there&#39;s a lot more reversion to go ladies and gentlemen just look at these if you&#39;re listening to it I really feel bad for you this week you should probably take it 30 minutes just to get out this block you can ignore the TV stuff just listen to that but this part&#39;s important uh more than one in three Russell 2000 companies is unprofitable uh um yeah and this this is presented as it&#39;s a bad thing but if you look at all the periods where small caps dramatically outperformed they all started like this go look at small caps from 2001 to 2007 they all started with the huge percentage unprofitable and then they absolutely dramatically outperformed early 90s same story 2010 same story I midcaps remain historically inexpensive relative to Mega caps we&#39;ve covered that before companies tend to outperform after spin-offs so uh we&#39;ve talked about that in the past spin-offs generate Alpha so we got to be on alert for more spin-offs uh equal weight S&P 500 trough versus cap weighted index uh in July we talked about that with Ash Webster the breath started to broaden we had an Abrupt interruption in December because of the election because of rates in the dollar which again we know we uh know where the probabilities lie Pro respectively regarding those instruments that affect everything else hedge funds shine during periods of heightened volatility that&#39;s what we are entering with higher rates us regime indicator improved in November potentially entering recovery what does that mean what is a regime indicator well high quality lowrisk large size that is what we just came out of what are we going into ladies and gentlemen we just coming out of that we&#39;re going into value small size high risk uh perceived by turnarounds okay turnarounds are perceived as highrisk which is why no one wants them because no one actually likes to read past the price chart and actually understand the balance sheet and cash flows and solvency uh analysis uh which is great I&#39;m glad there&#39;s so little competition in that uh otherwise I&#39;d be out of a job so um so that&#39;s exciting so we&#39;re moving right into this phase one and then uh and so on so this is just where where it&#39;s beginning dividends historically followed EPS we expect dividend growth to accelerate to plus 12% in 20125 a lot of dividend stock opportunities Stanley Black and&amp; Decker back the whole gamut ample room to increase dividend payout ratio is 30% today versus the long-term average of 50% look at this this it&#39;s all this zero interest rate policy nonsense this is going to revert back dividend should contribute more total returns than the last decade the last decade was the exception not the rule historically from 1936 to 2012 before Zer dividend return was 40% of the total return price was only 60% in Zer zero interest rate policy dividend return was 16 price was 84% that game is changing ladies and gentlemen right side ising long duration growth versus cash return value within the S&amp;P has just begun Just Begun dividend yield exp inexpensive versus history we love that we covered that with Ash um this is just a a survey of alternative data sources being used we use some of them low PE tops the survey for n9th year running [Music] um a forward PE so so this is the metric that most managers are using which is kind of comical uh you&#39;re Europeans use more price to free cash flow that&#39;s interesting size increasingly matters they they use Target price no one uses price to sales um share repurchases Etc so it&#39;s just been a little bit crazy town because of free money money is no longer free people are just waking up to that fact that the real estate the real estate market has figured it out uh now the equities Market is starting to figure it out quintile uh Russell 1000 stocks what do we have here top dividend yield so you can see here this is basically a buy list B Baxter International I mean there are just a lot of great companies in here to pay attention to Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow um Nordstrom&#39;s getting takeen private Target maybe Ken view is interesting Staples no one wants that&#39;s kind of interesting Gilead&#39;s already started to move uh some of the refiners Pepsi has been beaten down metronic you can&#39;t give away Healthcare we like that so there&#39;s just a lot of stuff here skyworks is kind of interesting J&amp;J Amgen um M Cisco Molson Kors Kellan NOA Avalon Bay so yeah\n\ndividend should contribute more total returns than the last decade the last decade was the exception not the rule historically from 1936 to 2012 before Zer dividend return was 40% of the total return price was only 60% in Zer zero interest rate policy dividend return was 16 price was 84% that game is changing ladies and gentlemen right side ising long duration growth versus cash return value within the S&P has just begun Just Begun dividend yield exp inexpensive versus history we love that we covered that with Ash um this is just a a survey of alternative data sources being used we use some of them low PE tops the survey for n9th year running ### MISCELLANEOUS\nRussell 1000 stocks what do we have here top dividend yield so you can see here this is basically a buy list B Baxter International I mean there are just a lot of great companies in here to pay attention to Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow um Nordstrom&#39;s getting takeen private Target maybe Ken view is interesting Staples no one wants that&#39;s kind of interesting Gilead&#39;s already started to move some of the refiners Pepsi has been beaten down metronic you can&#39;t give away Healthcare we like that so there&#39;s just a lot of stuff here skyworks is kind of interesting J&J Amgen Cisco Molson Kors Kellan NOA Avalon Bay so yeah\n\nhistorically value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in the US Often by a striking amount the data covering nearly a century backs up the notion that value stocks those with lower relative prices have higher expected returns while disappointing periods emerge from time to time the principle that lower relative prices lead to higher expected returns Remains the Same value premiums have often shown up quick ly and en llarge magnitudes for example in years when value outperformed growth the average premium was nearly 15% 15% on average value stocks have outperformed growth Stocks by 4.4% annually in the US since 1927 so you can&#39;t see it or understand it here because of this Zer aberration but that&#39;s the aberration the rule is is price is what you pay value what you get and again unless you believe we are going back to Zer which means a depression deflation uh type environment then you want to be getting some exposure to uh getting more for the same amount of money more growth lower multiple same money while Street forecasts a bigger increase in earnings for small caps we covered that average small cap returns have been particularly strong when inflation has been 1 to 3% uh periods of rising m&a activity have historically delivered strong Equity returns particularly you can see here uh for small caps and midcaps as well and then uh okay credit this from Seth golden credit card debt rising to new record levels is good credit card debt has fallen so people are saying credit card debts at record high well the only time that credit card debt goes down is when you&#39;re in a recession so the last thing you want to to root for is uh credit card balance is going down that&#39;s all I can say what matters is Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income and that&#39;s near multi-decade lows uh labor markets are fully rebalanced should continue to see wage and services disinflation uh us growth outperformance was driven by outsized increase in productivity two 12,000 people turning 35 every day in the US here&#39;s that market breath chart again that is probably the most important one of the week pboc People&#39;s Bank of China steps up liquidity injections via new tools so they&#39;re getting with it they&#39;re just kind of biting their time until the inauguration and as they did last time you can see the dramatic underperformance of the Dow in December was just a a weird situation that&#39;ll bounce back like a rubber band ball you&#39;re already seeing it uh today with some of the mag sevens getting hit Etc these were the charts that I talked about pmo buy all at zero that&#39;s usually a time to be buying stuff SPX buying stuff National Association of active investment managers down uh these are all good signs uh if you know how to pick stocks large gains tend to happen more more than you expected here&#39;s the late 90s it can go for a number of years uh 50s Etc Chinese government Buy dropped meaningfully in 2004 same story before the election uh before the inauguration we expect double- digit returns from most actively attractively valued Global markets so expected returns in US dollars us. is the lowest China and Brazil are the highest this is from Morning Star Investment Management S&P after it falls at least three consecutive days to end the year uh on average a month later it&#39;s up 6% % so we&#39;ll see if that happens uh first year of the presidential cycle is usually weak the exception was Trump Trump&#39;s back so maybe this will be another exception we&#39;ll find out 20% yearly gain suggest more green but don&#39;t expect a bigger year than 2023 average return after these type of gains is 10% I think that&#39;s in the neighborhood of reasonable uh this is lining up 2000 to uh 2021 again and how value is starting to come back in fits and starts and will will start to scream back sooner than people are expecting uh X recessions inflation tends to rise about 6 months after the first red cut we&#39;re on track with that dollar spot index around election days 2016 and 2024 so again uh people are picking up on what we&#39;ve been saying for months Tok or not months after Trump got elected dollar is going to go up then it&#39;s going to go down after the inauguration same with yields Tokyo CPI going up which means jgb these yields will be going up which means carry trade will be unwinding which means what all that hot money is coming out of Mag 7 inflation in Japan&#39;s Central Capital inflation in Japan&#39;s capital accelerates keeps rate hike prospects intact rate hikes equals unwind carry trade equals unwind mag 7 or rate mag 7 to lower more realistic multiples in line with increased capex and lower Returns on that capx um decelerating return on invested capital China 10-year government bond yield same story we covered China plans record $411 billion special treasury bond IND uh issuance next year for fiscal spending no one&#39;s paying attention uh S&amp;P 500 Mo members below their 50-day moving average it&#39;s usually an opportunity to buy not sell like last October Dallas fed manufacturing turning up we&#39;re coming out of the manufacturing depression that we&#39;ve been in for 3 years um same story with the Chinese Yuan uh devalue before the inauguration China non-manufacturing PMI is turning up into expansion no one&#39;s paying attention to it China&#39;s service activity jumps as stimulus boosts local demand monthly Market breath we covered that in case that wasn&#39;t an important enough chart uh public versus private Enterprise Value to ebit a multiples here&#39;s automotive sales volume is through the roof that is good for albamar because they&#39;re selling all the EV story is there people are getting faked out because the demand is decelerating in the developed market for EVS but accelerating for hybrids and in China it&#39;s still through the roof because it&#39;s an unnatural stimulated market and that&#39;s going to continue that helps that Supply glut in lithium start to normalize over the next 12 to 18 months and albam Maro has the operating Leverage G the staying power with 3.4 billion of liquidity to hockey stick as a result uh wall Street&#39;s predictions for uh uh S&amp;P 500 end ofe targets the highest is Deutsche Bank at 7,000 the median is 6600 which implies you know 10 11% gain um we&#39;ll see what extent do you think the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will either be up or down in 2025 we will bucket the answers so slide as near as possible to your desired answer so they&#39;re expecting the the biggest concentration of people are expecting mag 7 to only be up 0 to 10% whereas last year they expected it to be up last December they expected this year to be up 20 to 30% and they were right so they&#39;re expecting way more subdued returns from mag 7 this year where do you see the 10-year treasury yields at the end of 2025 uh the biggest proportion are seeing it between 425 and 450 so lower than here uh and another big group is between 375 to 4 I think that&#39;s a a reasonable range I think four is the right number [Music] um what do you think the return of the S&amp;P 500 will be in 2025 this is all from Deutsche Bank by the way survey uh the bulk vast majority think the biggest 35% think it&#39;s going to be between 5 and 10% I&#39;m in that group last year the biggest group thought it was going to be between zero and 5% and it was it was much bigger so uh we&#39;ll see maybe they actually be right this year uh in your opinion do you think the following are more likely to double or have in the next big move Bitcoin and Nidia so in December of 2024 52% believe that Nvidia is likely to H more likely to have than to double last year it was only 41% um 61% believe that Bitcoin is is more likely to have um more people thought Nvidia would double last year and more people thought that Bitcoin would double last December so let&#39;s see if they&#39;re right again this year uh S&amp;P entry year declines we covered that that&#39;s just another variation of the Dietrich chart median 2 we s P return since 1950 what they&#39;re trying to portray here Goldman Sachs is that the first half of January tends to be really good uh tends to be up 1.25% an average year Isn&#39;t So average that&#39;s from drick uh boy we brought you more data in a shorter amount of time this week than we ever have and probably ever will so enjoy it uh this is uh home prices turning down that&#39;s good economic surprise index down here&#39;s a Divergence with the 10-year yield so either the economic surprise prizes need to catch back up or the 10-year yield needs to catch back down I think it&#39;s going to be the latter in the short term [Music] um and I think the reason is going to be that companies are going to be guiding down due to the aberrational strength headwind of the US dollar in the fourth quarter so the surprises are going to be negative uh even though the dollar will start turning down which helps them in forward quarters uh uh uh it we we&#39;ll start to see this catch down which means 10year yields down which should be good for mortgage rates which should be good for housing which you can&#39;t give away which is another area we should be paying attention to earnings growth again small cap uh this is in the Russell 200000 because a lot of them are inflecting from negative to positive 53% that&#39;s unbelievable the small cap uh 600 again 21% corporate credit spreads record low Lottery financing going to happen 10e returns around the start of fed cutting cycles first cut okay so we we&#39;re we&#39;re below average for treasuries after the first cut but there&#39;s a huge catch up and it&#39;s always positive so you want to be a buyer TLT not a seller in this in the in the intermediate term for sure dollars Divergence from fair value it&#39;s excessively valued it&#39;s excessively crowded it&#39;s going to change uh I&#39;m optimistic 2025 will be better for me than 2024 uh top countries Indonesia is number one 90% of people believe that Columbia is number two 88% of people believe that China is number three 87% of the Chinese believe 2025 is going to be better than 2024 uh versus the United States we only we&#39;re way down on the list 70% believe that it&#39;s going to be better um and Japan 38% believe remember that was most crowded trade it was just hot money ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going back to China uh small cap ramp and earnings we covered covered that uh NASDAQ made a gravestone dogee for all of you uh on a monthly basis so last time it did that was 2021 before you had the 2022 Tech selloff um so that looks like bad news for people in the mag 7 and in general indices and good news for us however uh the you know uh sentiment Trader says not always a great signal good signal sometimes but there here are you know 1 two 3 four five 6 S 8 nine 10 uh other times and yeah top top top close to a top nowhere near a top uh close to a top top nowhere near a top so it&#39;s a mixed it&#39;s a coin flip so this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that&#39;s going to repeat but it&#39;s something to pay attention to uh small cap earnings growth again here&#39;s the mag 7 here&#39;s the last 10 bubbles oil in the early 2000s NASDAQ in the late 90s nikay in the late 80s gold in the late mid 70s nifty 50 which we just discussed in the 60s so the mag 7 is the most ex stretched out of all of them again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see a crash I see a reating in multiples and I see a new emergence of leadership the companies that benefit from AI versus the companies creating AI uh is is kind of how I&#39;m thinking about it we covered that this is from fund Strat S&amp;P down three days or more in a row in the last five trading days of the year the return median return for January the next year is plus 3.6 q1 plus 5.2 full year plus 12.4 I think that&#39;s well within the realm of possibility I love that empirical data Tom Lee smart guy corporate net interest payments near record low levels corporate balance sheets are

one-arm paper hanger uh here&#39;s the Mosaic of returns we did see Emerging Markets finally  get off the mat even Baba is up 10% but this is pocket change this is rounding errors this is nothing compared to what&#39;s going to be taking place um fixed income was the worst and as you can see what the reason I always show this quilt is because it rotates and I think we&#39;re going to see bonds uh outperform uh in 2025 Reit will benefit from that developed Market Equity was uh towards the lower level that could could bounce back and then us large cap was at the top but as you can see it doesn&#39;t stay at the top to long last time it was at the top was uh 2019 and then it dropped big by 2022 and then you had uh 200 oh that&#39;s the average um 2013 to 15 and then it drops so zero interest rate policy you have to believe rates are going back to zero to be unequivocally overweight and unworried about being in that concentrated bucket and I think we&#39;re getting close to the end of the data so we can get on to the article of the week but I didn&#39;t want to miss anything and I don&#39;t think I did um value versus growth again this hasn&#39;t been a better opportunity since 2001 just reemphasizing same with equal weight versus two um the index volatility is the toll we pay to invest various declines per year from 1928 to 2023 um per year on average you get 7.23% dips you get 3.45% Corrections you get 1.1 10% correction per year you get 05 15% Corrections per year and you get3 30 basis points of the the time you get a 20% bare Market one every 3.5 years so this is just part of it and you know the reason private equity and private credit have become so popular is because there&#39;s no Mark to Market so if you run a pension you get to stick in these vehicles which is marked to make make believe and the purveyors of these beautiful instruments that never go down um according to the marks that they take collect their 2% whether they&#39;re in actuality going up or down because they&#39;re marking it to whatever they want uh versus what the actual Market is the public markets tell you what it is but they don&#39;t have to mark to the public markets and then what happens is you get caught in a cycle and all of a sudden you are marking to make believe marking to make believe and you get marked down to zero and you say what happened I you know how did this happen overnight because you had no indications along the way of the real Market valuing it and giving you regular decisions to make it all you were looking for was to dampen volatility which is a guarantee to get all the volatility at once at when everyone gets the volatility and to get smoked so if you want low volatility because you think you&#39;re taking lower risk let me tell you you&#39;re taking much more Risk by entering quote unquote low volatility with perfect smooth Mark to markets where you want to to make your money is in well you do whatever you want to do all of this is opinion not advice I&#39;ve just been to many movies and I know how they end this fantasy about private credit being uh beautiful and private Equity being beautiful time will tell uh and when the chickens come home to roost those marks are going to be completely worthless and the 2% that they extracted regardless of the returns is going to prove to be uh to their benefit and um um irrespective of the marks coming down all at once so that&#39;s where it is I&#39;m not calling for that I think the econom is going to be strong for the next five six years so only the egregious

2023 that's when you want to be buying so that's that's uh TLT great financial crisis push stock allocations below the traditional 60 to 65% ban so while a lot of money's flowing in it's still relatively low and below average relative to you know 40 Years of History so there's upside room there there and that's that all right on to the news two stock picks for 2025 uh in 2024 is only losing sector so they're referring to materials which we love they're talking about da and liond Del basil I think those are two worth paying attention to uh this is China EV sales set to overtake

Ley uh The Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income is still near multi-decade lows but we keep an eye on it uh you know debt being at credit card debt being at record levels GDP is at record levels in case you didn't get the memo so uh hang in there yes you're seeing some strain at dollar store in the lower end and that's just part of the thing but those are the people who did the best under Trump 1.0 so uh let give them a minute to find the coffee machine and we'll be Off to the Races China's record dividend payout intensifies pressure on the Yuan it's not the only reason AI boom may be good too good to be true this is from Josh Harlen over at the Wall Street Journal pending copyright infringement lawsuits could derail the industry's economic potential why because they're scraping everyone else's data and not paying for it so when they have to pay for it it's going to slow the game down a little bit but who's going to benefit are the companies like gxo and Amazon and companies that can apply AI in their operations and take costs out uh which we're going to talk about in gxo three Healthcare stocks to buy for 2025 rebound so interesting Jacob's talking about M uh materials and Healthcare uh and the three stocks he's talking about here CVS human and siga I think uh in United Health I think there's going to be ponies in the pile certainly Healthcare so he's talking about am genen look he's got Healthcare right for sure how you want to express it is another story but love that 2025 FES five highest yielding dogs of the Dow could explode higher so um we talked about this a little last week what is it Chevron Verizon Amgen Johnson and Johnson MC so here are some healthcare stocks that I've been be down a lot that I I think you're not going to get hurt and you might make a lot of money so that's a good thing to to do uh stock bears are going extinct time to worry time to time to be alert certainly the ones that are blindly pushing into indices and into concentrated areas that I think are going to get some air L out of the balloon why the Dow had such a miserable index in uh miserable December versus other indexes uh yeah we covered that um you can read the article for the why Eli Lily rates in dollar drug trial results could shake up Pharma stocks in 2025 watch Eli Lily fiser and more I think fiser you got to pay attention to at these

Logistics update uh they had the rumor where they were going to be sold stock shot up to uh from 46 to 63 and then it wasn&#39;t going to be sold and it and shot down to 40 now 41 now it&#39;s 43 but as you can see the free cash flow is steady and solid revenues continue to grow they had record re revenues record eida good organic growth um and uh price Target upgrade by Oppenheimer to $67 it&#39;s trading at $43 that&#39;s a 12mon price Target and that&#39;s after the news about the um CMA going to level two with regard to the winon acquisition uh there two overhangs on the stock ladies and gentlemen so you don&#39;t have to analyze the logistics business because they own it uh what you need to analyze is are these two overhangs worth a 20% a $20 drop in the stock and the answer is no um and I&#39;ll tell you why first and foremost this guy um um is retiring at um 65 which is a normal retirement age for a public company CEO maybe he could go to 6 67 he had a good run and you never know why but 65 if he was 55 I&#39;d be a little worried uh so now you&#39;ve got this whole waight who&#39;s going to be the new CEO so you&#39;re going to have an overhang on the stock it&#39;s not going to do much until they announce who&#39;s the new CEO and knowing Brad Jacobs who attracts winners he&#39;s going to get a rockstar in there the stock will it will be a major Catalyst there&#39;s nothing to turn around there the Stock&#39;s doing the the performance of the business is doing great which is why people were uh unsolicited unsolicited offering tenders to buy the company so um that&#39;s number one number two is the referral of winon acquisition to the CMA in the UK after the fact so they did the deal last March they are waiting to merge the companies they&#39;re running side bys side silos winon has lower margins than gxo but when they start to operate them as one unit that&#39;s where they&#39;re going to get the synergies and dramatically increase the margins of winon which is a great business and have an unbelievable business in the UK winon is is um is concentrated there so you know 3/4 billion doll deal 735 million pounds and so you have to look at what&#39;s the worst case scenario the worst case scenario is the the CMA which is the UK regulator says you can&#39;t do the deal it&#39;s anti-competitive and if they were going to do that you would think they would do it before the acquisition and you think the company would be on track now you could say maybe this guy completely screwed up and that&#39;s why he&#39;s you know forced retired and that there certainly could be that and that&#39;s what the that&#39;s what the stock is saying to you right now down $40 down to $40 based on the underlying operations the business is saying there&#39;s a problem here what if winon gets un unround well if Winton gets unround Unwound you get your $753 million back on the balance sheet number one you go make another acquisition or you invest in uh the business which they have a huge High return on operating operating return on invested capital of 30 plus perc so I don&#39;t mind them having 750 million on cash the most likely thing and the CEO uh discussed it in the earnings call which is why uh we we spend so much time on the earnings call which we&#39;re going to go into now is that it&#39;s very normal for these size Acquisitions to go into uh phase two with the CMA they require details they&#39;re trying to make sure it&#39;s not going to be a monopoly um look it&#39;s going to be a great business and um and I think they&#39;ll have to have some concessions about uh different things so it doesn&#39;t become a monopoly per se uh but they&#39;ll do that and it will be a great combination and everything will be fine it&#39;s just going to delay the synergies by a quarter or two uh but the the stock price is discounting an unwind of the deal and um and if there&#39;s no unwind which is where the probabilities are then you&#39;re going to get a reversion back to 50 and then from there you&#39;re going to get a CEO maybe 55 and then they&#39;re going to continue to perform on their 2027 plan and then we think it&#39;s a double plus so um again opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips click on terms it&#39;s right up here boom but um we don&#39;t we really don&#39;t get into anything unless we think it can be a double over a few years so um so that&#39;s that you can see the fundamentals continue to perform pre- Winton post winkon uh and they will continue to perform so let&#39;s cover some of the key things uh the revenue was up 28% year onye 3% of that was organic growth the rest was acquisitive their sales pipeline increased 30% to 2.4 billion they signed three4 of a billion dollars of new annualized Revenue in the quarter on track to win a record level of business in 2024 this doesn&#39;t even sound like a turnaround but it&#39;s priced like a turnaround which we love uh highest ever quarterly revenue of 3.2 billion signed 226 million of new business seeing demand for e-commerce capacity long-term structural Tailwind uh key Dr key growth driver for us over the past five years um generated almost $200 million of cash flow from operations 120 110 million of free cash flow and um they&#39;ve got uh five half a billion dollars of cash if the deal got Unwound they&#39;d have 1.25 billion doll of cash uh net 2.2 billion of net debt which is very reasonable considering the amount of free cash flow that they&#39;re generating their guidance they reaffirmed adjusted eBid of 800 to 835 million two call it 283 of earnings uh $283 of uh of earnings and free cash flow conversion of 30 to 40% so highlights we covered here are some of the recent wins you can recognize some of these Brands Orlando LG guest L&#39;Oreal Jim shark uh bewd pie I don&#39;t know what that is that must be European new contract wins and Outsourcing underpin long-term growth so they got 29% of their new wins from competitors 40% from new activity uh from existing competitor existing clients and 31% from Outsourcing strong cash flow and investment grade balance sheet which we covered number one Pure Play contract Logistics provider 27 countries of operation 30% of Fortune F Fortune 100 companies served $10 billion in 2023 Revenue that&#39;s going up a lot um and so on so uh just want to get through some of the key things here you can see by region 40 UK is 41% of their business us is 48 so it&#39;s a it is a play on the recovery in Europe they&#39;ve got 8% in the Netherlands 8% in France 5% in Spain 4% in Italy 6% in others so this is a beautiful leveraged uh play uh on a niche business in a market that we think is going to see great recovery in coming years and they are going to be the greatest beneficiary of that recovery um here are some of their other Blue Chip customers you can see bear guest lvmh Levis Lor Nike Pepsi TJX Samsung uh Kell NOA JD Heineken Red Bull Versace Boeing by the way Boeing they talked about a large US Aerospace company which they got huge new business so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just an incredible business by 2027 they&#39;re going to do 16 billion at Top Line EOB about 1.3 billion uh operating return on invested capital of 30% and um e adjusted EA kager so organic Revenue kager 10% so this thing is just going to be a machine and you get to those type of levels um minimum double but then you get multiple reating and that&#39;s where you get extra juice that you didn&#39;t expect when all the Lemmings start to follow in after the double High conversion of adjusted iida to free cash flow flow to cash flow and you can see the waterfall there all right let&#39;s get into some of the key highlights from the earnings call transcript that we haven&#39;t covered yet $750 million in new business year-to date uh We&#39;ve mentioned that we saw the bottom of the inventory cycle in the fourth quarter of last year we&#39;ve been talking about that for a year and a half that that was going to the bottom it certainly has proven the dstock restock as we head into this year&#39;s Peak we&#39;re seeing inventory levels returning to normal and demand for e-commerce capacity is accelerating as commercial activity picks up momentum our technology differentiation through the deployment of Automation and AI is creating a multiplier effect in the efficiencies we deliver to customers on the back of real world results we are proud to have been recognized with a supply chain Excellence award for our leadership and Warehouse AI by Logistics manager a few weeks ago [Music] um Etc uptick in e-commerce activity Tech F Logistics exper about a third of our new business wins year-to date have come from newly outsourced business around 40% of our 2.4 billion pipeline is made up of customers looking to outsourc for the first time the acceleration of out sourcing is in part a result of the recovery of e-commerce and it drives customers to look for a partner with scale Automation and the ability to manage complexity gxo as well position to capture growth from these Trends gxo has been piloting our first proprietary AI application in select warehouses in the US our tool streamlines our customers fulfillment processes by using machine learning to predict SKU demand in the near term the sheer volume data volume of data analyzed by our tool produces High highly accurate forecast of inventory flows down to the SKU level these insights enable our operation teams to optimize the layout of the warehouse and match Resources with demand our initial Pilots have far exceeded our expectations delivering predictive accuracy levels above 90% and productivity improvements of 3 to 4X in stock replenishments which Drive increased capacity of 6 to 8% at no additional cost we&#39;re thrilled with the early success of AI and we&#39;re scared scaling it across our footprint AI is going to change the way warehouses are run over the next few years and our leadership in the space is a key driver of our long-term profitable growth this is the next phase of the AI story ladies and gentlemen not the people um selling chips it&#39;s the regular businesses benefiting and improving profitability and productivity from the employment of that not a better search engine that&#39;s that game is you know that happen but that&#39;s not the that&#39;s not the key game so um very strong player in the Aerospace I&#39;m sure Aerospace we going to do incredibly well in Europe it&#39;s a huge Market very few competitors will be the new will be the new kid on the Block and I think we&#39;ll do really well uh so here this analyst asks in the Q&amp;A what about winon and the potential malol Wilson the current CEO uh talks about win Winton and he says let me cover the Winton port point and I&#39;ll hand you over to Baris in terms of a more detailed aspect on the margin so with Winton clearly you know we&#39;re reviewing the decisions the phase one decisions that came across last Friday so we&#39;re reviewing that in detail at the moment and clearly as we have on other projects we&#39;re going to be engaging very constructively and collaboratively with the CMA we&#39;re kind of remaining pretty confident that we&#39;re going to see a positive outcome to it it&#39;s possible that we&#39;ll go to phase two which they did and you know frankly I mean we are prepared for all the potential outcomes that this might bring and it is not an uncommon environment by the way for a deal of this size to go into phase two okay and then he goes on to talk about excluding winon winon we have improved our margin every quarter this year so you know Winton will be a drag until they can merge the operations of those or if it&#39;s Unwound margins will actually go back up uh when you look at winton&#39;s margins they are lower than ours at the moment but that is the upside in 2025 and onwards then we start integrating the business and we capture the synergies okay not actually uncommon for a deal this size to go into what the CMA class as a phase two type process it&#39;s a much more detailed process which is good good not bad and basically we&#39;ll work with the CMA to make some clarification in terms of the different Market verticals that exist in the UK UK is a highly competitive environment there&#39;s no question about that and as a British guy I&#39;m probably well equipped to comment on that it is a highly competitive environment so Our intention is to do some detailed work with the CMA teams over the coming months I think what that will do do is it will help us clarify greatly the situation and as I mentioned we&#39;re confident that we&#39;ll secure a good satisfactory positive outcome through the process one of the things that probably it will involve is where we had planned to commence integration of the two businesses in early January I think it&#39;s fair to say we might see a delay on that process probably stretching out into the beginning of the second quarter I don&#39;t think beyond that but that&#39;s our expectation at the moment because we have to respect the CMA they do a really good job and it&#39;s quite correct and proper that we work with them to seek clarification on the points that they&#39;ve raised all right so that is the most important Lynch pin that and who they&#39;re going to um name as the new CEO and the rest of these amazing business developments you can read on your own fear and greed is down to 28

uh economic data we covered so that&#39;s it for the podcast part now we&#39;re going to go into the question and answer\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\n\neuronet world wide might be worth a deeper look I&#39;m curious what your thoughts are EFT let&#39;s see here what do they do payment and transaction process and Distribution Solutions for financial institutions retailers electronic fund transfer processes money transfer uh ATM stuff yeah look uh the numbers look great on this coros [Music] um I think it&#39;s definitely worth a look we would not be involved in this because we already have PayPal exposure we don&#39;t want two of similar sector necessarily but um you just have to understand what is their durable advantages their MO intact and if so    you probably have a decent situation here take a look at the balance sheet yeah I think this is reasonable good work    definitely worth a further exploration ior Barry are there any single names you would Express to the Healthcare through uh where you&#39;re expressing through xbi do you think any individual names look good at the moment uh we like Baxter we own Baxter and we own xbi    you know we would look at fizer we&#39;d look at some others but    uh that&#39;s what we own at present we&#39;re not going to own six Healthcare stocks when you have a portfolio of 10 12 companies you generally only do one to maximum two per sector and between xbi and Baxter we we feel we have enough exposure    at the moment but are keeping our mind open on to the next Ryan Wang are you how concerned are you that gxo acquisition of Winton could get blocked by the UK it&#39;s priced in as if it&#39;s already been blocked so if anything less than blocking happens the stock goes up    so I&#39;m not worried what&#39;s your opinion on SLX seems like steel sector is ready for a bounce let&#39;s see I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t like steel socks they just chronically suck I    I don&#39;t see what you see so I&#39;m a pass even the companies I look at like Cliffs and I keep looking at them keep doing nothing that they&#39;re trading Vehicles they&#39;re not businesses you want to own for the long term    want to get your take on Bill acman this is from Jason Zen Bill amman&#39;s recent public awareness campaign on the asymmetric bet that is Fanny May and Freddy Mack on the conservative ship being lifted and their stocks potentially being a multibagger it&#39;s a special situation but not necessarily a turnaround would love your color on it thanks for all you do and provide Jason    as far as I know he&#39;s owned it since uh Trump 1.0 and he was doing the same public awareness campaign    during the first Administration and Trump never lifted the uh conservatorship so maybe he&#39;ll do it this time but if you follow that theory last time it was dead money evvy this is from Jared Davis Evolution AB financials look great I got to understand the business online casino systems to gaming operations in Europe I think someone else brought brought that up    this tends to be a very yeah I think this is like International game Tech in the US I tend to not like these because they do great until they don&#39;t and then they just blow up for no reason because it&#39;s like very cyclical it looks perfect now financially but    you&#39;d have to do a lot of work on it and just understand how it&#39;s going to out earn the normal cyclicality and the unpredictability of that business    all right what is your opinion not advice check terms on Starbucks and wi we covered both of these    Starbucks was a turnaround I think it&#39;s going to continue to turn around the issue with both of them is there uh for us    Starbucks didn&#39;t really get cheap enough and I think competition is it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a China play as is win and we have enough China exposure through Alibaba so we&#39;re not that interested [Music]    um I just don&#39;t I like I think Baba is a much easier double than than win or um Starbucks at these levels so for that reason uh we&#39;re just agnostic good businesses they&#39;re going up the question is how much    Tom you crush it on vno could you please take a look at HPP we&#39;ve looked at HPP a bunch of times this is uh a high lever there was a little inside buying this week    they&#39;re trading like they&#39;re going bankrupt and there&#39;s a decent chance they might but if they don&#39;t you got a $16 stock so on that basis I can&#39;t get Comfort I can&#39;t see all their leases I can&#39;t understand it    as clearly as I could have understood Vado because I don&#39;t know the buildings I don&#39;t know the companies that inhabit it but    you know it&#39;s largely mag 7 I think big Tech stuff I met one of the directors a couple of years ago and    he was was pitching me on it at 15 and now it&#39;s    286 so I didn&#39;t bite at 15    uh I&#39;m not really interested in this one it&#39;s too much it&#39;s highrisk high reward but there&#39;s too much in the risk part and I I don&#39;t need to you know rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two is don&#39;t forget rule number one I don&#39;t care if it takes me three years if I&#39;ve got a short thing if if if I&#39;ve got a gamble thing for like three up one down that&#39;s that&#39;s a Traders game and that&#39;s not what we do Sarah Wells ask what&#39;s your birth Tom well it isn&#39;t\n\n Starbucks and wi we covered both of these uh Starbucks was a turnaround I think it's going to continue to turn around the issue with both of them is there uh for us um Starbucks didn't really get cheap enough and I think competition is it's it's a it's a China play as is win and we have enough China exposure through Alibaba so we're not that interested [Music] um I just don't I like I think Baba is a much easier double than than win or um Starbucks at these levels so for that reason uh we're just agnostic good

takes me three years if I've got a short thing if if if I've got a gamble thing for like three up one down that's that's a Traders game and that's not what we do ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nChris Henderson ask can you take a look at Align? I think their moat uh has been attacked the stock has been dead money for seven eight years. Digital Bridge (DBRG) sector is super hot well cash flows are going down along with the price. Philip Andrew pinkos thought on Ambev (ABEV)? I think I&#39;d rather do I mean this is another one that&#39;s been dead money for 10 years. I&#39;d rather buy DIIO best-in class deal with the Tariff risk uh or even Brown Forman and deal with the higher um margin Spirits. Mattel (MAT) is just you know my kids don&#39;t even have toys everything&#39;s on the iPad so yeah they&#39;re moving into the entertainment business and all that stuff I I just don&#39;t like this business it it it just chronically sucks I mean if you&#39;re going to buy one of the toy companies you buy Hasbro (HAS). Thoughts on Occidental Petroleum (OXY)? Exxon Mobile (XOM) in the low3s and uh Wells Fargo (WFC) at 25 we buy down here I up here there&#39;s no asymmetry like it&#39;s not going to 150 in a week so if you want something that&#39;s a little better than a bond that&#39;s going to pay a dividend and it might double in five years great. Slumberger (SLB) stock which we&#39;ve already gotten more than a double and it&#39;s going to we&#39;re probably going to get another multibagger from that uh because there&#39;s asymmetry I&#39;m not seeing that in a lot of these energy stocks like we saw it in 2020 when we were jumping up like a hyena buy everything when oil went negative so for me it&#39;s a pass it&#39;s just it&#39;s just blah. Jay apt please take a look at Carvana (CVNA) no interest. Zara Bassam pgny uh let&#39;s take a look at that Zara oh that&#39;s interesting let&#39;s take a look I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be some type of Biotech which I&#39;m going to say I have no Edge but it does look like it&#39;s ready to rock and roll. Aaron Seth thoughts on xmag S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent seven yeah why not. Chris Patterson thank you for all your book recommendations over the year can you take a look at Celanese (CE)? I like Celanese it&#39;s one of these materials companies that is uh beaten down haven&#39;t done anything with it yet don&#39;t know if I have space to do anything with it yet but I think over the next few years it&#39;ll be okay and I think it&#39;s interesting. Chris Tim o'connell Celcius Holdings we've covered that a million times I think it's probably okay there's some legal issue you got to get comfortable with but um probably okay at these levels. Jimmy Jones thoughts on investing in Brazil uh when do you think it should when when Lula dies and he falls down the stairs again and they get a conservative in uh it's going to go Bonkers but it's not there yet but um yeah it's like waiting for Gau I I just don't see any real asymmetry without massive risk in Brazil I think China's the better play right now but um yeah I think China's going to I think Brazil is going to work over the next few years as well\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nAaron Seth thoughts on xmag S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent seven yeah why not um a iot iot so it's gone from one to $6 no no no give me these things before they take off not after they just had multi-baggers a IO t power Fleet what do they do itive free no I'm not interested uh I like your first one though Chris Patterson thank you for all your book recommendations over the year can you take a look at selones I like selones it's one of these materials companies that is uh beaten down haven't done anything with it yet don't know if I have space to do anything with it yet but I think over the next few years it'll be okay and I think it's interesting um on to the next and we've covered that a few times Chris Tim o'connell celus Holdings we've covered that a million times I think it's probably okay there's some legal issue you got to get comfortable with but um probably okay at these levels Jimmy Jones thoughts on investing in Brazil uh when do you think it should when when Lula dies and he falls down the stairs again and they get a conservative in uh it's going to go Bonkers but it's not there yet but um yeah it's like waiting for Gau I I just don't see any real asymmetry without massive risk in Brazil I think China's the better play right now but um yeah I think China's going to I think Brazil is going to work over the next few years as well uh",

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nexpect that Trend to to resume after the calendar turns Ash yeah the the Santa rally has been a big belly flop has it not I&#39;ve got one minute left Thomas a record $1 trillion was invested into ETFs this year do you expect that Trend to continue well the last peak of passive ETFs uh inflows was 2021 which implies it often happens at the exact wrong time I think what you&#39;re going to see is the weights that make up those passive indices are going to underperform the mag 7 uh versus verus the rest of the market broadening start to outperform as a matter of fact value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 the only exception which is why we&#39;re stuck with recency bias The Only Exception was the zero interest rate policy decade since 2010 so unless you believe we&#39;re going back to zero interest rate policy you want to add some cheaper value into your portfolio as the turns Ash terrific advice we&#39;ll have to leave it there but Thomas thank you so much for joining us today thanks for having me and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I had the pleasure to join Brad Smith and Brian sazy on Yahoo finance going into the last shall be first theme for 2025 want to thank Justin Oliver and Kayla Hawkins for having me on uh we&#39;re going to listen in here the healthc care and material sectors are two of the worst performing sectors on the S&amp;P 500 in 2024 our next guest says now though is the perfect time to take a look at what to expect from them in 2025 Thomas Hayes great Hill Capital chairman and managing member joins us now happy holidays to you thanks so much for hopping on Yahoo finance with us so you&#39;re banking on a bounce back here potentially with these two sectors why is that yeah Brad thank you for having me I I think the theme for 2025 is going to be the last shall be first if you look at Healthcare it&#39;s up basically 3 4% year to date relative to the S&amp;P some 25% uh but and with materials up 1.8% year to dat very anemic returns but when the calendar turns something is going to change and that&#39;s called earnings growth as a matter of fact Healthcare and materials are in the top four earnings growth expected for 2025 Healthcare is expected to grow earnings 20.6% materials is going to grow earnings 17.4% which exceeds the S&amp;P 500 at 14% And you know Brad if if we look at healthc care there&#39;s some some strange things happening uh but kind of predictable we saw a similar situation in 2016 right after Donald Trump was elected Healthcare and biotech sold off if you remember he was going to tear up the Affordable Care Act and the market got nervous shortly after the inauguration healthare rallied biotech rallied as a matter of fact Healthcare was up around 40% in 2017 biotech around 75% after selling off after the election uh and then rallying after the inauguration I think now it&#39;s not the Affordable Care Act it&#39;s RFK Jr&#39;s got people a little bit on edge and I think it&#39;s a a case of sell the rumor by the news it won&#39;t be quite as bad as people are expecting on the healthcare front what about the materials uh Thomas good to good to see you as always aren&#39;t tows going to be bad for this sector yeah I I think it&#39;s it&#39;s more than advertised I think this is a negotiating tactic uh if you look at materials it has the lowest relative performance to the S&amp;P 500 since 2020 and then going all all the way back to 2001 these were both generational buy opportunities in the material sector and speaking of which Brian uh the material sector if you look at xlb did the exact same thing in 2016 remember he ran as the Tariff King they sold off after the election they rallied in 2017 after the inauguration so we expect more of the same thing uh as it relates to uh just some of the technical stuff on this you know materials only 7% of the components are trading above their 50-day exponential moving average now I&#39;m not a big Tech technician by any stretch of the imagination but that tells you the sector is completely washed out and there&#39;s one player that we particularly like called albamar uh it&#39;s one of the largest lithium producers and if you know anything about lithium it&#39;s very cyclical right now it&#39;s at uh very low prices on the fears of a supply glut we do expect this uh imbalance to be rectified by the end of 2025 albam Maro is one of the biggest players they&#39;ve got $3.4 billion dollars of liquidity to wait it out while the smaller players will be crushed so uh we do think albam Maro is going to be a great play it&#39;s also down on the fear of softer maybe potential or perceived softer demand for EVS in the developed world yeah like United States like Europe however the EV game is all about China and that&#39;s an unnatural government subsidized market and that&#39;s expected to grow from 40 million stock globally 41 million stock of EVS globally right now to 132 Million by 2027 largely driven by China and the government subsidies to push that so that&#39;s going to help albam Maro and even prior to that you saw albam Maro could perform through all kinds of lithium prices high prices low prices Etc and this time will be no different Tom I got a Huston bar finish here but just lastly according to an SEC filing Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire bought $28.5 million in Varys sign stock an internet registry company that&#39;s been around since the do boom you know Buffett&#39;s moves lately he he&#39;s sitting on a lot of dry powder what do you make of that and how could it be deployed potentially where are the top areas he could deploy that in 2025 so ver sign is certainly a headline it&#39;s 91 basis points of the entire portfolio so you could see a lot of these moves are being made by the lieutenants Todd and Ted Buffett&#39;s got you know some 325 350 billion dollars of cash I

could deploy that in 2025 so ver sign is certainly a headline it&#39;s 91 basis points of the entire portfolio so you could see a lot of these moves are being made by the lieutenants Todd and Ted

EV demand is going down which it's softened in North America and Europe but China is driving the bus on EV demand because it's an unnatural government subsidized market and the stock of Eves is expected to grow from 41 million now to 132 Million by 2027 so they'll just cut cost they'll ride out the short-term glut and as one of the biggest players with 3.4 billion of liquidity they'll be

    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nbasically also the other thing to keep in mind is this bull market is relatively new in the scheme of uh we had the 25% correction in 2022 which was a recession too everyone waiting for a recession we just had two in four years you usually have one in four years so we pulled forward a recession uh very hard to have a recession with 2 and A2 to 3% GDP growth so that&#39;s off the table which which in theory uh pretty much takes a 25% correction off the table as well even usually a 20% correction unless you have just some short-term dislocation for a week or something like that um so with the average duration of a bull market is 269 days and we&#39;ve been going since uh the fall of 2022 when we were pounding the table\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nJapanese bond yields and I emphasized uh aggressively in last week&#39;s podcast that the number one thing you need to watch as it relates to the Magnificent 7 is not whether the FTC is coming for them it&#39;s whether the bank

yes\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally  outperform growth it&#39;s two standard deviations belong the long-term mean the the per uh value relative to growth the last time it got this low was uh the early 2000s and then you had a period of seven years of dramatic outperformance of uh value worth is versus growth so you know if you&#39;re getting into the business in uh 2010 or 2011 and you were just or you know 92 and you you got the value bug you had to wait a while until started to outperform uh last time before 2001 where it was just a generational opportunity to start buying value Was 1980 in 1981 the beginning of the Reagan Administration after they were taking rates down just like they did in last 12 months and then for the next 10 years value dramatically outperformed so here we are ladies and gentlemen and uh No One Believes it and and that&#39;s what it has to be in order for it to be that great and um here on every metric price versus book uh price versus sales you don&#39;t get these value these relative valuations you get them once every 20 years and you got to make hey while the sunshines and I think the next six seven years we&#39;re going to make be able to make more money in a shorter period of time than has ever been done in a very in a generation and that&#39;ll be it and you know uh you know we&#39;ll raise a ton of cash in the early 2030s and uh look for some asymmetric bets but this is this is going to be the most exciting 5 six seven years for a value investor that I think we&#39;ve seen in 20 years 40 years and then probably before that 60 years when Buffett started his career in the 50s uh and you had the same exact setup and Buffett often acknowledges I just got lucky when I started if you believe in this philosophy and framework and you&#39;re starting now either as a client or in the industry you couldn&#39;t be luckier and um so that&#39;s that uh price of sales here is\n\ndividend should contribute more total returns than the last decade the last decade was the exception not the rule historically from 1936 to 2012 before Zer dividend return was 40% of the total return price was only 60% in Zer zero interest rate policy dividend return was 16 price was 84% that game is changing ladies and gentlemen right side ising long duration growth versus cash return value within the S&P has just begun Just Begun dividend yield exp inexpensive versus history we love that we covered that with Ash um this is just a a survey of alternative data sources being used we use some of them low PE tops the survey for n9th year running ### MISCELLANEOUS\nRussell 1000 stocks what do we have here top dividend yield so you can see here this is basically a buy list B Baxter International I mean there are just a lot of great companies in here to pay attention to Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow um Nordstrom&#39;s getting takeen private Target maybe Ken view is interesting Staples no one wants that&#39;s kind of interesting Gilead&#39;s

J&J Amgen Cisco Molson Kors Kellan NOA Avalon Bay so yeah\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nd you know the reason private equity and private credit have become so popular is because there&#39;s no Mark to Market so if you run a pension you get to stick in these vehicles which is marked to make make believe and the purveyors of these beautiful instruments that never go down um according to the marks that they take collect their 2% whether they&#39;re in actuality going up or down because they&#39;re marking it to whatever they want uh versus what the actual Market is the public markets tell you what it is but they don&#39;t have to mark to the public markets and then what happens is you get caught in a cycle and all of a sudden you are marking to make believe marking to make believe and you get marked down to zero and you say what happened I you know how did this happen overnight because you had no indications along the way of the real Market valuing it and giving you regular decisions to make it all you were looking for was to dampen volatility which is a guarantee to get all the volatility at once at when everyone gets the volatility and to get smoked so if you want low volatility because you think you&#39;re taking lower risk let me tell you you&#39;re taking much more Risk by entering quote unquote low volatility with perfect smooth Mark to markets where you want to to make your money is in well you do whatever you want to do all of this is opinion not advice I&#39;ve just been to many movies and I know how they end this fantasy about private credit being uh beautiful and private Equity being beautiful time will tell uh and when the chickens come home to roost those marks are going to be completely worthless and the 2% that they extracted regardless of the returns is going to prove to be uh to their benefit and um um irrespective of the marks coming down all at once so that&#39;s where it is I&#39;m not calling for that I think the econom is going to be strong for the next five six years so only the egregious actors but uh but they it&#39;s coming so uh\n\nfiser and more I think fiser you got to pay attention to at these levels uh certainly dividend yield is

opportunity they bet big when they have the odds it&#39;s what we&#39;ve spent the last hour and 23 minutes talking about the odds in 2025 they bet big when they have the odds and the rest of the time they don&#39;t it&#39;s just that simple Buffet you don&#39;t have to be smarter than the rest we just have to be more disciplined with than the rest not succumb to the emotional ups and downs uh but actually just know what you own and do it on low leverage and you just wait for the big paydays which come all at once you wait you wait you wait and then it&#39;s jackpot and then you reinvest you wait you wait you wait it&#39;s double or triple jackpot you reinvest you wait you wait you wait quadruple plus jackpot you reinvest etc etc R doio when you think that it&#39;s too hard remember that in the long run doing things that will make you successful is a lot easier than being unsuccessful there&#39;s no question about that uh article of the week no value in value qu that&#39;s a question so in a year like 2024 it&#39;s easy to forget the fact that since 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year we covered this chart we covered most of these so we don&#39;t have to go through them again International as well covered the TV spots so that&#39;s all good and we can get right\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ndown to business\n\nwith gxo Logistics update uh they had the rumor where they were going to be sold stock shot up to uh from 46 to 63 and then it wasn&#39;t going to be sold and it and shot down to 40 now 41 now it&#39;s 43 but as you can see the free cash flow is steady and solid revenues continue to grow they had record re revenues record eida good organic growth um and uh price Target upgrade by Oppenheimer to $67 it&#39;s trading at $43 that&#39;s a 12mon price Target and that&#39;s after the news about the um CMA going to level two with regard to the winon acquisition uh there two overhangs on the stock ladies and gentlemen so you don&#39;t have to analyze the logistics business because they own it uh what you need to analyze is are these two overhangs worth a 20% a $20 drop in the stock and the answer is no um and I&#39;ll tell you why first and foremost this guy um um is retiring at um 65 which is a normal retirement age for a public company CEO maybe he could go to 6 67 he had a good run and you never know why but 65 if he was 55 I&#39;d be a little worried uh so now you&#39;ve got this whole waight who&#39;s going to be the new CEO so you&#39;re going to have an overhang on the stock it&#39;s not going to do much until they announce who&#39;s the new CEO and knowing Brad Jacobs who attracts winners he&#39;s going to get a rockstar in there the stock will it will be a major Catalyst there&#39;s nothing to turn around there the Stock&#39;s doing the the performance of the business is doing great which is why people were uh unsolicited unsolicited offering tenders to buy the company so um that&#39;s number one number two is the referral of winon acquisition to the CMA in the UK after the fact so they did the deal last March they are waiting to merge the companies they&#39;re running side bys side silos winon has lower margins than gxo but when they start to operate them as one unit that&#39;s where they&#39;re going to get the synergies and dramatically increase the margins of winon which is a great business and have an unbelievable business in the UK winon is is um is concentrated there so you know 3/4 billion doll deal 735 million pounds and so you have to look at what&#39;s the worst case scenario the worst case scenario is the the CMA which is the UK regulator says you can&#39;t do the deal it&#39;s anti-competitive and if they were going to do that you would think they would do it before the acquisition and you think the company would be on track now you could say maybe this guy completely screwed up and that&#39;s why he&#39;s you know forced retired and that there certainly could be that and that&#39;s what the that&#39;s what the stock is saying to you right now down $40 down to $40 based on the underlying operations the business is saying there&#39;s a problem here what if winon gets un unround well if Winton gets unround Unwound you get your $753 million back on the balance sheet number one you go make another acquisition or you invest in uh the business which they have a huge High return on operating operating return on invested capital of 30 plus perc so I don&#39;t mind them having 750 million on cash the most likely thing and the CEO uh discussed it in the earnings call which is why uh we we spend so much time on the earnings call which we&#39;re going to go into now is that it&#39;s very normal for these size Acquisitions to go into uh phase two with the CMA they require details they&#39;re trying to make sure it&#39;s not going to be a monopoly um look it&#39;s going to be a great business and um and I think they&#39;ll have to have some concessions about uh different things so it doesn&#39;t become a monopoly per se uh but they&#39;ll do that and it will be a great combination and everything will be fine it&#39;s just going to delay the synergies by a quarter or two uh but the the stock price is discounting an unwind of the deal and um and if there&#39;s no unwind which is where the probabilities are then you&#39;re going to get a reversion back to 50 and then from there you&#39;re going to get a CEO maybe 55 and then they&#39;re going to continue to perform on their 2027 plan and then we think it&#39;s a double plus so um again opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips click on terms it&#39;s right up here boom but um we don&#39;t we really don&#39;t get into anything unless we think it can be a double over a few years so um so that&#39;s that you can see the fundamentals continue to perform pre- Winton post winkon uh and they will continue to perform so let&#39;s cover some of the key things uh the revenue was up 28% year onye 3% of that was organic growth the rest was acquisitive their sales pipeline increased 30% to 2.4 billion they signed three4 of a billion dollars of new annualized Revenue in the quarter on track to win a record level of business in 2024 this doesn&#39;t even sound like a turnaround but it&#39;s priced like a turnaround which we love uh highest ever quarterly revenue of 3.2 billion signed 226 million of new business seeing demand for e-commerce capacity long-term structural Tailwind uh key Dr key growth driver for us over the past five years um generated almost $200 million of cash flow from operations 120 110 million of free cash flow and um they&#39;ve got uh five half a billion dollars of cash if the deal got Unwound they&#39;d have 1.25 billion doll of cash uh net 2.2 billion of net debt which is very reasonable considering the amount of free cash flow that they&#39;re generating their guidance they reaffirmed adjusted eBid of 800 to 835 million two call it 283 of earnings uh $283 of uh of earnings and free cash flow conversion of 30 to 40% so highlights we covered here are some of the recent wins you can recognize some of these Brands Orlando LG guest L&#39;Oreal Jim shark uh bewd pie I don&#39;t know what that is that must be European new contract wins and Outsourcing underpin long-term growth so they got 29% of their new wins from competitors 40% from new activity uh from existing competitor existing clients and 31% from Outsourcing strong cash flow and investment grade balance sheet which we covered number one Pure Play contract Logistics provider 27 countries of operation 30% of Fortune F Fortune 100 companies served $10 billion in 2023 Revenue that&#39;s going up a lot um and so on so uh just want to get through some of the key things here you can see by region 40 UK is 41% of their business us is 48 so it&#39;s a it is a play on the recovery in Europe they&#39;ve got 8% in the Netherlands 8% in France 5% in Spain 4% in Italy 6% in others so this is a beautiful leveraged uh play uh on a niche business in a market that we think is going to see great recovery in coming years and they are going to be the greatest beneficiary of that recovery um here are some of their other Blue Chip customers you can see bear guest lvmh Levis Lor Nike Pepsi TJX Samsung uh Kell NOA JD Heineken Red Bull Versace Boeing by the way Boeing they talked about a large US Aerospace company which they got huge new business so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just an incredible business by 2027 they&#39;re going to do 16 billion at Top Line EOB about 1.3 billion uh operating return on invested capital of 30% and um e adjusted EA kager so organic Revenue kager 10% so this thing is just going to be a machine and you get to those type of levels um minimum double but then you get multiple reating and that&#39;s where you get extra juice that you didn&#39;t expect when all the Lemmings start to follow in after the double High conversion of adjusted iida to free cash flow flow to cash flow and you can see the waterfall there all right let&#39;s get into some of the key highlights from the earnings call transcript that we haven&#39;t covered yet $750 million in new business year-to date uh We&#39;ve mentioned that we saw the bottom of the inventory cycle in the fourth quarter of last year we&#39;ve been talking about that for a year and a half that that was going to the bottom it certainly has proven the dstock restock as we head into this year&#39;s Peak we&#39;re seeing inventory levels returning to normal and demand for e-commerce capacity is accelerating as commercial activity picks up momentum our technology differentiation through the deployment of Automation and AI is creating a multiplier effect in the efficiencies we deliver to customers on the back of real world results we are proud to have been recognized with a supply chain Excellence award for our leadership and Warehouse AI by Logistics manager a few weeks ago [Music] um Etc uptick in e-commerce activity Tech F Logistics exper about a third of our new business wins year-to date have come from newly outsourced business around 40% of our 2.4 billion pipeline is made up of customers looking to outsourc for the first time the acceleration of out sourcing is in part a result of the recovery of e-commerce and it drives customers to look for a partner with scale Automation and the ability to manage complexity gxo as well position to capture growth from these Trends gxo has been piloting our first proprietary AI application in select warehouses in the US our tool streamlines our customers fulfillment processes by using machine learning to predict SKU demand in the near term the sheer volume data volume of data analyzed by our tool produces High highly accurate forecast of inventory flows down to the SKU level these insights enable our operation teams to optimize the layout of the warehouse and match Resources with demand our initial Pilots have far exceeded our expectations delivering predictive accuracy levels above 90% and productivity improvements of 3 to 4X in stock replenishments which Drive increased capacity of 6 to 8% at no additional cost we&#39;re thrilled with the early success of AI and we&#39;re scared scaling it across our footprint AI is going to change the way warehouses are run over the next few years and our leadership in the space is a key driver of our long-term profitable growth this is the next phase of the AI story ladies and gentlemen not the people um selling chips it&#39;s the regular businesses benefiting and improving profitability and productivity from the employment of that not a better search engine that&#39;s that game is you know that happen but that&#39;s not the that&#39;s not the key game so um very strong player in the Aerospace I&#39;m sure Aerospace we going to do incredibly well in Europe it&#39;s a huge Market very few competitors will be the new will be the new kid on the Block and I think we&#39;ll do really well uh so here this analyst asks in the Q&amp;A what about winon and the potential malol Wilson the current CEO uh talks about win Winton and he says let me cover the Winton port point and I&#39;ll hand you over to Baris in terms of a more detailed aspect on the margin so with Winton clearly you know we&#39;re reviewing the decisions the phase one decisions that came across last Friday so we&#39;re reviewing that in detail at the moment and clearly as we have on other projects we&#39;re going to be engaging very constructively and collaboratively with the CMA we&#39;re kind of remaining pretty confident that we&#39;re going to see a positive outcome to it it&#39;s possible that we&#39;ll go to phase two which they did and you know frankly I mean we are prepared for all the potential outcomes that this might bring and it is not an uncommon environment by the way for a deal of this size to go into phase two okay and then he goes on to talk about excluding winon winon we have improved our margin every quarter this year so you know Winton will be a drag until they can merge the operations of those or if it&#39;s Unwound margins will actually go back up uh when you look at winton&#39;s margins they are lower than ours at the moment but that is the upside in 2025 and onwards then we start integrating the business and we capture the synergies okay not actually uncommon for a deal this size to go into what the CMA class as a phase two type process it&#39;s a much more detailed process which is good good not bad and basically we&#39;ll work with the CMA to make some clarification in terms of the different Market verticals that exist in the UK UK is a highly competitive environment there&#39;s no question about that and as a British guy I&#39;m probably well equipped to comment on that it is a highly competitive environment so Our intention is to do some detailed work with the CMA teams over the coming months I think what that will do do is it will help us clarify greatly the situation and as I mentioned we&#39;re confident that we&#39;ll secure a good satisfactory positive outcome through the process one of the things that probably it will involve is where we had planned to commence integration of the two businesses in early January I think it&#39;s fair to say we might see a delay on that process probably stretching out into the beginning of the second quarter I don&#39;t think beyond that but that&#39;s our expectation at the moment because we have to respect the CMA they do a really good job and it&#39;s quite correct and proper that we work with them to seek clarification on the points that they&#39;ve raised all right so that is the most important Lynch pin that and who they&#39;re going to um name as the new CEO and the rest of these amazing business developments you can read on your own fear and greed is down to 28 that&#39;s not what you see at tops ### MISCELLANEOUS\nhealthc care earnings top 30 weights have been revised down one 1.30% in the last 60 days uh financials have been revised up 1.17 uh economic data we covered so that&#39;s it for the podcast part now we&#39;re going to go into the question and answer",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nsome of that but watch the jgb yields because as that Japanese money gets more expensive the carry trade becomes less profitable all that free money has been parked in mag 7 they were getting the benefits of currency depre apption of the Yen uh appreciation of the dollar and stability of Mag 7 as rates go up that trade becomes less attractive and the money gets out hot money like nobody&#39;s business uh so that is the number one chart you should be looking at every single day when you wake up is the jgb yields as yields go up the odds of Mag 7 holding on to the waiting they have and the flows they have uh get cut in half very very quickly 21 uh us pensions to sell $21 billion of equities okay so that&#39;s the the US Centric view of uh any wobbliness S&P performance after gaining more than 35% in the last 12 months from October so you look one month out you have some negative returns 3 months out you&#39;re up 3% 6 months out you&#39;re up 3% and 12 months out you&#39;re up 13.8% I think that&#39;s a reasonable expectation for the indices this year uh given expected underperformance of Mag 7 uh between 8 and 133% and under the surface making money all day long Seth golden no no way to Sugar Cod it first year of Republican Le Administration is on average not good for equities extremely Stark difference from Democrat uh Trump 1.0 bucked the trend in 2017 can it happen again with tax act 2.0 we&#39;re going to find out really soon I think on balance they&#39;re going to give him the benefit of the doubt again and it&#39;s going to be an okay year for sure maybe not for mag 7 as mag 7 did less well under Trump 1.0 uh on balance but still did fine small cap and large cap earnings estimates into next year now this is the Russell 2000 if you look at small uh S&P 600 it&#39;s a little different but for Russell 2000 this is from fact set they&#39;re showing 57% earnings growth for the Russell 2000 small caps versus the S&P 500 of 14 to 15 % that&#39;s as of December 10th if you look at the small cap 6 S&P 600 it&#39;s more like 21% but the fact of the matter is you pay less you get more more earnings growth for lower multiple and that&#39;s why that rotation to have no fear the broadening rally will reappear uh we feel very confident in that Viewpoint halfway through the rolling roiling 20s uh S&P performance since the start of the decade uh and I think that&#39;s that gives us another five years of Runway there CFO optimism is rising that is a um that that historically has a forward-looking ability forcasting ability as that consumer conf as that CFO optimism Rises off despondent lows like we saw in the 2022 and 2020 recessions uh equities tend to follow and I think this time will be no different ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\ndollar Index after Trump election we have emphasized this over and over as everyone&#39;s panicked about the 10year Y yield and the dollar destroying everything and all the plans with emerging markets and everything else uh we said now that Trump has elected expect this the same thing happened in 2016 for you know month and a half after he was uh elected through to inauguration the dollar went up yields went up after the inauguration after the turn of the calendar they all collapsed dollar dollar rolled completely over just like you see in this chart same thing with the 10-year yield Emerging Markets rallied biotech rallied the whole story so we&#39;re pretty excited about that and one of the reasons that we are super enthusiastic about 2025 got delayed a couple of months with the election result we had no way to predict the election winner uh uh nor were we trying and uh we wouldn&#39;t have changed a thing even if we knew the outcome because one it creates uh unnecessary tax events two um you can look at an analog to get a sense of what might happen but to gamble on it exactly repeating is a Fool&#39;s errand that what we have is a beautiful portfolio of amazing businesses that we know everything about uh in concentrated form we have a huge margin of safe we&#39;ve got turnaround catalysts with CEOs and and durable businesses and plans forward we&#39;ve got solvency risk removed from from pretty much all of them uh if not all of them and uh and and the turnaround in place from the dto to the restock cycle so we couldn&#39;t be more excited we just had to eat six weeks of volatility uh after the election and now we&#39;re going to get the benefit of the rewards holding tight and using those opportunities to uh be topping up everywhere we Poss possibly could uh it&#39;s been a very busy holiday season and super excited some of the folks that came in last uh week after the podcast called they already got approved we put a lot of money to work today we&#39;re going to put a lot of money to work in the next few days as more of those applications are approved at at interactive brokers and uh and and uh all the client existing clients new clients are going to be beautifully set up early right before the inauguration for all these great things things to unfold um and then we&#39;ll close out sometime well before the inauguration in the next week or two uh so here we go PE ratios uh percent okay cortile so this is from hbert ratings Mark hbert he he writes with data with a pretty much chronically bearish tilt historically uh which is good you want to have the counterbalance of the data so he&#39;ll just find data to support a bearish view pretty consistently over the decades and he&#39;s a well-respected journalist uh in the industry so here what he&#39;s saying is uh you know we&#39;re in the top 92nd percentile in terms of PE ratio 96 percentile in terms of Cape 98th and dividend yield 100th uh in price to sales 100th in Price to Book so so what he&#39;s basically saying is based on these valuations we are going to correct and we&#39;re going to die he&#39;s had the similar uh data in each of the last three years as well maybe this year he&#39;ll be right but I think he&#39;ll be right in a concentrated portion of the market um in the areas that we&#39;re trafficking you know they&#39;ve really taken out uh you know at some point it you know it&#39;s so cheap to own such a high quality portfolio of assets some point they&#39;re almost paying you to take them it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mindboggling it really is exciting what what this once in a 100y year event with covid created in terms of generational opportunities to buy unbelievable businesses marked down on sale and you know I you know I I talked to some of you and they&#39;re like wow I love your I love your optimism it&#39;s not optimism you you will find periods in in uh in future years where I will be I will sound like uh David Rosenberg and Mark Wilson&#39;s cubed uh I&#39;ll be the most negative person on the street it&#39;s just not the right time that that&#39;s the bottom line and um uh when that time occurs we we will be there I I am agnostic to being bullish or bears obviously you&#39;re going to be bullish you&#39;re going to make a lot more money over time being bullish I&#39;ve I&#39;ve only met I used to say I never met a wealthy an extremely wealthy uh Perma Perma pessimist uh I do know one uh but he&#39;s made most of his money you know selling pessimism versus uh versus uh El other otherwise but uh you know he&#39;s built a great business doing that but that&#39;s the exception not the rule on balance you want to be an optimist you want to see opportun you know pessimists look for the difficulty in the opportunity OPP uh optimists look for opportunity and the difficulty and that&#39;s where all the money is so uh not only um do value and growth rotate over the years but International versus us this is from RIT Holtz um uh this shows the rotation from International Equity outperformance to us equity outperformance and as you can see in the zero interest rate policy that began in 2010 what happened from 2010 until zerp ended in 2022 us dramatically outperformed International by an order by a level of um outperformance that we haven&#39;t seen since 1995 to 1999 and then prior to that 89 to 93 and then prior to that 79 to 83 but if you look at these Cycles they usually only last four years four years four years 5 years here we had this extended cycle of 10 years because of the aberrational zero interest rate policy that favors um favored US Stocks among other things and if you believe that we are going back to zero interest rate policy then you should continue to bet exclusively on the US but if you believe that this is a normal cycle and that International could start to outperform like we&#39;ve seen early signs of uh the last two years just like we saw early signs of in 2021 2022 uh 2001 and 2002 before you had dramatic outperformance from 2003 to 2007 dramatic outperformance from 92 to 95 dramatic outperformance of international from 1983 Reagan 1.0 to 1989 dramatic outperformance from 1976 to 1979 dramatic outperformance of international from 1970 to 1973 so every 4 years so maybe you could see a situation where if I&#39;m right about the terminal rate and we don&#39;t go any lower than 3.5 I think we&#39;re going to be terminal rate is going to be somewhere between 3.5 and four even if we went to three but we don&#39;t go anywhere near zero uh that we could see the next four years cycle like early Reagan where International like early Bush where International dramatically outperformed the us and what does that mean it means the top 10 stocks that make up 40% of the index uh start to materially underperform and I think that is coming uh a historic boom in Immigration average annual change in forign Born population is a share of the total US population so we added 2 million in the last three years that is the highest since the 1850s um so that&#39;s that at least we&#39;re still getting population growth uh we can debate what type of population growth is best but we can&#39;t debate that we need population growth so so uh I&#39;ll leave it at that um putting 2024 in perspective so again the average pullback around 14% been anemic we did have a big one in uh 2022 we had a big one in 2020 a big one in 2018 so you see all this stuff but actually in uh 2016 2017 2019 so um so that&#39;s that month L return stats for the S&P 500 since 1964 January is a good month um it is positive 58% of the time with the average return of 1.1% what are the worst ones I think everyone kind of knows uh September&#39;s the worst month February&#39;s February&#39;s uh one of the worst months August so so on balance you get cautious if things are really hot into August September on balance you get cautious if things are really hot through January February tends to be a little bit of Rocky before picking up in March and April before the sell and man go away and then things turn up after September uh mid October uh but January on balance tends to be a small cap fundamental Tailwind again this is just reemphasizing the earnings grow growth that we&#39;ve talked about small caps in blue relative uh big earnings growth I guess this is the russle again talking about 40 42% earnings growth 30% earnings growth 53% earnings growth 60% earnings growth 49 quarter by quarter that&#39;s the Russell 2000 that&#39;s a little skewed by the percentage of companies that are not earning that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been going by the small cap 600 which has a higher percentage of earning companies which is 21% earnings growth but at the end of the day you&#39;re still paying 156 times versus 23 22 23 times for 14% growth for the regular indices net integration is already fallen uh solid real income growth should remain a key pillar of consumer spending growth uh that&#39;s from Goldman Sachs we expect GDP growth of 2.4% in 2025 vers uh to beat the consensus forecast of 2.0 supported by solid private domestic demand growth that&#39;s from uh Goldman Sachs here&#39;s the seasonality uh since the last 20 years December you tend to get a little bit of rockiness at the end a little bump up early January mid January week uh let&#39;s see here and then strong into the end of January weak in February as we discussed straight up into May a little rockiness strong into July weak in August September member and then straight up so it&#39;s just good to have these road maps it doesn&#39;t mean they repeat but there&#39;s a tendency to rhyme and if you know the lay of the land it puts you ahead of the pack record dividend outflows to add pressures to currency this is dividends paid by Hong Kong listed Chinese firms we&#39;ll talk about that um I think the big story is t\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nJanuary on balance tends to be a small cap fundamental Tailwind again this is just reemphasizing the earnings grow growth that we've talked about small caps in blue relative uh big earnings growth I guess this is the russle again talking about 40 42% earnings growth 30% earnings growth 53% earnings growth 60% earnings growth 49 quarter by quarter that's the Russell 2000 that's a little skewed by the percentage of companies that are not earning that's why I've been going by the small cap 600 which has a higher percentage of earning companies which is 21% earnings growth but at the end of the day you're still paying 156 times versus 23 22 23 times for 14% growth for the regular indices net integration is already fallen uh solid real income growth should remain a key pillar of consumer spending growth uh that's from Goldman Sachs we expect GDP growth of 2.4% in 2025 vers uh to beat the consensus forecast of 2.0 supported by solid private domestic demand growth that's from uh Goldman Sachs here's the seasonality uh since the last 20 years December you tend to get a little bit of rockiness at the end a little bump up early January mid January week uh let's see here and then strong into the end of January weak in February as we discussed straight up into May a little rockiness strong into July weak in August September member and then straight up so it's just good to have these road maps it doesn't mean they repeat but there's a tendency to rhyme and if you know the lay of the land it puts you ahead of the pack record dividend outflows to add pressures to currency this is dividends paid by Hong Kong listed Chinese firms we'll talk about that um I think the big story is t\n\nthe Chinese are doing the exact same thing they did in 2016 which is devalue currency ahead of the trade War so it's a Net Zero Effect to them because they manipulated their currency downward so if he adds tariffs um because of their weakened currency it will have no inflationary effect therefore it won't affect the volume for them and uh and they win um and it hurts the us because the dollar is stronger and makes us makes it harder for us to export things globally so um so that's that's what's going on there and then after the sell the rumors there buy the news when it's less bad than and than advertised then they can normalize the currency and um and everything Rock and rolls and you see years you see Baba that time 2016 we'll just show you again for the newer listeners um after it sold off following the election you had a basic doubling in the next year let's get that back up and get that back up there we go I'm back just got to move that around so I can get this and show you guys a preview of coming attractions so here was Baba big selloff after the election dropped from uh looks like about 100 down to 84 not dissimilar from what we just saw and then after the turn of the calendar and certainly after the inauguration you saw big strength went from $84 a share to $187 a share uh in 11 months doesn't mean it's going to repeat but I would anticipate it's going to somewhat rhyme babo is up 10% for the year this year uh moving in the right direction but it's time to get paid uh it's time for clients to get a huge payday and uh existing clients new clients and get you know Monster IR inside of 12 months and um and that's how it works I mean for the strategy for a mean reversion strategy you just you wait and you wait and then you get you know just monstrous amounts of stuff all at once uh and and then you know you uh you do this exact same thing you reinvest you wait and then you get another monstrous amount and I've been doing this for a long long time and when you have a a a portfolio that has zero correlation to the general indices unlike many active managers that are just closet indexers collecting fees whether it goes up or down but actually doing work and buying great businesses that you would want to own the whole thing and then you wait for the market to realize what you see uh it's just it's like Christmas for you know those periods you make you make a DEC you can make literally a decade's worth of money in in one year when you get these things uh all coming together at once so this this is what we saw in Trump and and uh here was kweb same story doubled um equal weight did well just all this stuff all this nonsense after the election solar solar stocks almost doubled after a disaster uh selloff before the inauguration uh biotech same story and then off to the races the only thing that did really terribly was uh energy stocks but I'm not sure that will be the case I think some of the servicers can do okay materials same story so look we've gone through this I I just wanted to reemphasize that for new people and understand I'm enthusiastic for a reason not to be enthusiastic I can be more pessimistic than anyone in the room when it's time to be more pessimistic than anyone in the room I don't think it's time if I was fully concentrated in mag 7 I'd be a little bit nervous I got to be honest with you I'd be very nervous uh not because I think they're going to crash not because I don't think the businesses are awesome not because I don't believe in AI I do I use it uh but um uh the the future that the market prices instantaneously often takes a lot longer to play out than anticipated so the markets tend to think it's going to be 3 to five years the reality is it's usually 15 to 20 but the Market's right um except that the bag holders that buy the three to 5e story wind up with the 80% draw Downs uh and uh even though they got the long-term thesis one 100% correct they paid for the long-term thesis being fulfilled in the present and it was going to take 20 years to happen and they thought it was going to take three years so that's all I'm saying Bull and bare markets this shows msci World um this this is just a different way of showing the underperformance versus the outperformance by JP Morgan International is due value is due Etc Regional earnings expectations you can see uh China for next year is going to grow about double digits it's trading at single digits uh emerging markets at you know 13 14% us at 13 14% the differen is for us you pay 23 24 times for us for emerging markets in certainly for China you pay high single digits for similar earnings growth world uh going to grow 12 12 time uh 12% and you're paying you know a third less multiple for that earnings growth us Equity Market faces un unprecedented concentration at the top top eight stocks 35.7 last highest concentration 200000 so I continue to just remind you of this I'm not calling for a 2,000 Tech rec I don't think that's happening because they have earnings power I'm calling for a d rating of multiples uh in those baskets that are frothy uh while exposure to commodity sectors near is near low so we have our albamar we have our com stock thank you for all the kind tweets over the week uh lot many of you have doubled your money uh on that and uh we think that's just getting started but kudos to those who took chips off the table doubles are good things and congratulations uh long only exposure to financials increased but still has still light versus history so that's turning up uh we continue to look for opportunities to get back in but we have um we took a lot of profits in city and BAC over the summer they haven't gone up much since so that was basically dead money uh which was the right thing for us to do to take that off and buy things that were cheaper but we'll look for opportunities we still have exposure through PayPal which is up you know went from whatever it was 60 to 90 but that's pulling back a little bit we're going to stay with that for a while uh Market breath bad breath returns uh monthly Market breath is on Pace to hit an all-time low in December this was a big deal ladies and gentlemen and you haven't seen this bad of Market breath since the top of the 2000 Tech W which is why I um I would be very concerned if I was in just indices or instruments or single stocks that are concentrated and correlated uh or actually the mag 7 um it just doesn't bode well when you have that extreme waiting everyone's crowded into it and um and you're not going back to a zero interest rate policy environment uh you know you can you can play again you can bet against the odds and maybe you get another year where you're right but um I always just bet with the odds and and uh do it with low leverage and sooner or later it turns out and we mean revert and then when it turns it's just like overnight riches it's it's it's exciting but um uh we're not there yet but I think we're very very very close uh earnings growth is expected to broaden in 2025 arguing for a broader rally we agree so last year it was somewhat Justified 36% earnings growth for the mag 7 4% for the rest of the index this year 19% for the mag 7 but you're paying 34 times versus 133% for the rest of the market which you're only paying 18 times there you go ladies price is what you pay value is what you get gentlemen as well number of stocks shrinking since the late 1990s this is exciting this means there's less supply for more money chasing it don't worry Wall Street knows how to feed the Ducks when they're quacking you will see a ton of IPOs in the next couple of years that does not Mark a quote unquote top uh I'd be a little bit more cautious in 2026 and certainly 2027 but as far as like a secular uh everyone screwed you know 2009 or 2000 or 73 I I think that's five six seven eight years off uh hedge fund positioning this shows exposure to cyclicals versus defensives is at a record low uh their tendency is to be wrong uh so you want to take the other side which is more uh cyclical which are being given away right now the longest and shortest sectors uh basically energy is the most shorted sector right now which is why we continue despite having exposure through Comstock which has been amazing uh look for more opportunities I think we're going to probably wind up having to buy a serer but it may not be a full position materials is an easier one to get more excited about second most shorted lot of opportunities to do there we've got albam Maro um maybe we'll get more but the problem is is the other thing is not only were we not correlated with the indices but we don't like to place too many bets that are effectively the same bet uh and um so you know you look at some of the Dow chemicals you look at some of the uh uh chemical stocks relative to albam Maro we want to get more exposure but we have to be careful that we W don't wind up with too much waiting in what is effectively the same trade um and then the least shorted is Healthcare and Staples so we'll keep an eye on that uh super micro most shorted stock Walmart Walmart is the least shorted stock that's interesting and not really useful information here are the most highest net exposure by head hedge funds lowest net exposure so none of them want Brown Forman albaro pool Corp Charter so here's your buy list Hershey uh [Music] Mna you know none of these are pounding the table but they the they're ones that I would definitely pay attention to Southwest Chevron Okay so that's that uh long only funds exposure to cyclical versus defensive also at all-time lows last time that happened was 2015 right before Trump was in and what what outperformed cyclicals after Trump got elected so there you go I mean again the these things you just have to be observant you don't have to be a genius you literally just have to pay attention and um you know live through enough cycles and have enough experience to say yes odds are in my favor I can't guaranteed I you know I don't have a crystal ball but when things are lined up like that uh that's how you can outperform over time is doing what the crowd's not doing and just doing it with low leverage so if you're quote wrong or what idiots say Traders day traders that live in their mom's basement early is wrong to have the fantasy that you're going to time it perfectly all you need to do is buy a quality business with a large enough margin of safety hopefully there's a catalyst you can see that it happens sooner rather than later cuz irr matters but if you have a basket of 8 or 12 some happen very very quick some take a little bit longer but on balance you're going to do just fine and um and and the the thing about it is it's not going to be linear it's not going to be you know every year a stair step up when you're doing uncorrelated business it's like you grind and then you have these that are just boom I mean it's just literally off the chart so um so you have to be accepting of that some people want to you know want to uh every week make money or every month make money and then after a couple years they give it all back to the casino uh have fun with that but if you buy businesses and you do private equity in the public markets you'd be willing to buy the whole business uh it's just an awesome way to live that's all I can tell you uh last 3 months long only's added exposure to financials chased them up decreased exposure to energy sold in the hole so that's why you know we've got to consider looking for more opportunity in energy uh despite having a good position uh continuing to be a alert for an asymmetric opportunity and that's the problem I'm just not finding asymmetric where I can make multiples of my money not get into it because I can make a 20 or 40% punt I'm not interested in that uh which is why I was so pissed when they were going to sell gxo at 60 or 70 bucks uh I didn't get in for 60 or 70 bucks I got in for 100 minimum uh and it could be a lot more if they continue to execute which we're going to talk about today most crowded stock in each sector like this is really valuable stuff I love this stuff I mean we'll be here for six hours if I go through all this which I'm perfectly happy to do but um some of you uh have other things to do and I don't want your two two mile walk to turn into a 20 mile walk and uh you wind up in another state so uh hedge funds have decreed exposure to Staples this year uh I think there's some opportunities popping up in Staples believe it or not all styles are underweight Staples so that's where some opportunity is you look at the Hershey's you look to a lesser extent at coca colola you look at some of these I'm seeing Staples pop up long which means rates are going down by the way I know no one believes that we're going to 5% we're not hang in there ladies and gentlemen long only the Hedge font exposure to energy is low versus history uh decrease exposure to materials of course that's where the opportunity is now underweight real estate uh all styles are underweight real estate sustained value run why okay so this is sa Savita saberian sagita I'm getting her name wrong but you know who she is she's wonderful she's always on the the networks uh Fox Business CNBC uh she's a strategist at Bank of America so she's saying large cap is the best large kep value is the best hedge against duration risk cheap stocks outperform when profits pick up with expectations limited to periods of negative risk premum after decade of capital depriving dinging consolidation and balance sheet repair the Russell 1,000 value index quality is neck and neck with growth statistics favor value cheap neglected no concentration R risk high PE dispersion but this has been true for a while of course it doesn't work till it works uh how does it not work you Return To Zero interest rate policy which we're not going to do that implies a depression uh q no growth no inflation value very unlikely under Trump value and growth now neck and deck in terms of quality uh value stocks remain competitively pric priced versus credit 84 stocks 84% of stocks in the Russell 1000 value index offer excess earnings yields I.E EPS yield minus 10year real treasury yield above investment grade Bond spread uh this is what I talked about with Ash Webster value did not work during zero interest rate policy uh that was really the exception to the rule ladies and gentlemen and we're going to get into some data in just a second uh on average value outperforms growth by 4.4% in the last decade you you if you asked 50 people on the street uh what does better over time growth or value 49 out of 50 uh are going to say growth only only growth you got to buy growth you got to buy growth AI man it's changing the world you know 3 years ago it was SAS before that it was internet of things you know the new flavor of the week but that is the exception not the rule okay and the rule is since 1927 value outperforms growth buying quality businesses at low prices is how you make a fortune if you look at the Forbes 400 and all the guys that manage money who are actually on it there's only one growth manager it's called Ron Baron and he got uh had this company called Tesla that he bet on in the early days and he stuck with and made unbelievable returns he's the only growth manager that I've ever seen that had durable uh performance over over time and if you look at the growth managers who do well it's usually concentrated in one stock um live and die um but the guys on the forest 400 who manage money they they're all value guys I mean that's just the bottom line so whether it's Buffett gelly cooperman uh Tepper icon there's a reason for it ladies and gentlemen so uh value St value trades at an extreme discount to growth on a Ford PE so you know if I'm just coming out of school and I just read the intelligent investor I I I wake up in the morning and I feel like I stepped in you

you know what like how lucky can you get you&#39;re in this generational opportunity where value is going to start to dramatically\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfinally  outperform growth it&#39;s two standard deviations belong the long-term mean the the per uh value relative to growth the last time it got this low was uh the early 2000s and then you had a period of seven years of dramatic outperformance of uh value worth is versus growth so you know if you&#39;re getting into the business in uh 2010 or 2011 and you were just or you know 92 and you you got the value bug you had to wait a while until started to outperform uh last time before 2001 where it was just a generational opportunity to start buying value Was 1980 in 1981 the beginning of the Reagan Administration after they were taking rates down just like they did in last 12 months and then for the next 10 years value dramatically outperformed so here we are ladies and gentlemen and uh No One Believes it and and that&#39;s what it has to be in order for it to be that great and um here on every metric price versus book uh price versus sales you don&#39;t get these value these relative valuations you get them once every 20 years and you got to make hey while the sunshines and I think the next six seven years we&#39;re going to make be able to make more money in a shorter period of time than has ever been done in a very in a generation and that&#39;ll be it and you know uh you know we&#39;ll raise a ton of cash in the early 2030s and uh look for some asymmetric bets but this is this is going to be the most exciting 5 six seven years for a value investor that I think we&#39;ve seen in 20 years 40 years and then probably before that 60 years when Buffett started his career in the 50s uh and you had the same exact setup and Buffett often acknowledges I just got lucky when I started if you believe in this philosophy and framework and you&#39;re starting now either as a client or in the industry you couldn&#39;t be luckier and um so that&#39;s that uh price of sales\n\nhistorically value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in the US Often by a striking amount the data covering nearly a century backs up the notion that value stocks those with lower relative prices have higher expected returns while disappointing periods emerge from time to time the principle that lower relative prices lead to higher expected returns Remains the Same value premiums have often shown up quick ly and en llarge magnitudes for example in years when value outperformed growth the average premium was nearly 15% 15% on average value stocks have outperformed growth Stocks by 4.4% annually in the US since 1927 so you can&#39;t see it or understand it here because of this Zer aberration but that&#39;s the aberration the rule is is price is what you pay value what you get and again unless you believe we are going back to Zer which means a depression deflation uh type environment then you want to be getting some exposure to uh getting more for the same amount of money more growth lower multiple same money while Street forecasts a bigger increase in earnings for small caps we covered that average small cap returns have been particularly strong when inflation has been 1 to 3% uh periods of rising m&a activity have historically delivered strong Equity returns particularly you can see here uh for small caps and midcaps as well and then uh okay credit this from Seth golden credit card debt rising to new record levels is good credit card debt has fallen so people are saying credit card debts at record high well the only time that credit card debt goes down is when you&#39;re in a recession so the last thing you want to to root for is uh credit card balance is going down that&#39;s all I can say what matters is Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income and that&#39;s near multi-decade lows uh labor markets are fully rebalanced should continue to see wage and services disinflation uh us growth outperformance was driven by outsized increase in productivity two 12,000 people turning 35 every day in the US here&#39;s that market breath chart again that is probably the most important one of the week pboc People&#39;s Bank of China steps up liquidity injections via new tools so they&#39;re getting with it they&#39;re just kind of biting their time until the inauguration and as they did last time you can see the dramatic underperformance of the Dow in December was just a a weird situation that&#39;ll bounce back like a rubber band ball you&#39;re already seeing it uh today with some of the mag sevens getting hit Etc these were the charts that I talked about pmo buy all at zero that&#39;s usually a time to be buying stuff SPX buying stuff National Association of active investment managers down uh these are all good signs uh if you know how to pick stocks large gains tend to happen more more than you expected here&#39;s the late 90s it can go for a number of years uh 50s Etc Chinese government Buy dropped meaningfully in 2004 same story before the election uh before the inauguration we expect double- digit returns from most actively attractively valued Global markets so expected returns in US dollars us. is the lowest China and Brazil are the highest this is from Morning Star Investment Management S&P after it falls at least three consecutive days to end the year uh on average a month later it&#39;s up 6% % so we&#39;ll see if that happens uh first year of the presidential cycle is usually weak the exception was Trump Trump&#39;s back so maybe this will be another exception we&#39;ll find out 20% yearly gain suggest more green but don&#39;t expect a bigger year than 2023 average return after these type of gains is 10% I think that&#39;s in the neighborhood of reasonable uh this is lining up 2000 to uh 2021 again and how value is starting to come back in fits and starts and will will start to scream back sooner than people are expecting uh X recessions inflation tends to rise about 6 months after the first red cut we&#39;re on track with that dollar spot index around election days 2016 and 2024 so again uh people are picking up on what we&#39;ve been saying for months Tok or not months after Trump got elected dollar is going to go up then it&#39;s going to go down after the inauguration same with yields Tokyo CPI going up which means jgb these yields will be going up which means carry trade will be unwinding which means what all that hot money is coming out of Mag 7 inflation in Japan&#39;s Central Capital inflation in Japan&#39;s capital accelerates keeps rate hike prospects intact rate hikes equals unwind carry trade equals unwind mag 7 or rate mag 7 to lower more realistic multiples in line with increased capex and lower Returns on that capx um decelerating return on invested capital China 10-year government bond yield same story we covered China plans record $411 billion special treasury bond IND uh issuance next year for fiscal spending no one&#39;s paying attention uh S&amp;P 500 Mo members below their 50-day moving average it&#39;s usually an opportunity to buy not sell like last October Dallas fed manufacturing turning up we&#39;re coming out of the manufacturing depression that we&#39;ve been in for 3 years um same story with the Chinese Yuan uh devalue before the inauguration China non-manufacturing PMI is turning up into expansion no one&#39;s paying attention to it China&#39;s service activity jumps as stimulus boosts local demand monthly Market breath we covered that in case that wasn&#39;t an important enough chart uh public versus private Enterprise Value to ebit a multiples here&#39;s automotive sales volume is through the roof that is good for albamar because they&#39;re selling all the EV story is there people are getting faked out because the demand is decelerating in the developed market for EVS but accelerating for hybrids and in China it&#39;s still through the roof because it&#39;s an unnatural stimulated market and that&#39;s going to continue that helps that Supply glut in lithium start to normalize over the next 12 to 18 months and albam Maro has the operating Leverage G the staying power with 3.4 billion of liquidity to hockey stick as a result uh wall Street&#39;s predictions for uh uh S&amp;P 500 end ofe targets the highest is Deutsche Bank at 7,000 the median is 6600 which implies you know 10 11% gain um we&#39;ll see what extent do you think the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will either be up or down in 2025 we will bucket the answers so slide as near as possible to your desired answer so they&#39;re expecting the the biggest concentration of people are expecting mag 7 to only be up 0 to 10% whereas last year they expected it to be up last December they expected this year to be up 20 to 30% and they were right so they&#39;re expecting way more subdued returns from mag 7 this year where do you see the 10-year treasury yields at the end of 2025 uh the biggest proportion are seeing it between 425 and 450 so lower than here uh and another big group is between 375 to 4 I think that&#39;s a a reasonable range I think four is the right number [Music] um what do you think the return of the S&amp;P 500 will be in 2025 this is all from Deutsche Bank by the way survey uh the bulk vast majority think the biggest 35% think it&#39;s going to be between 5 and 10% I&#39;m in that group last year the biggest group thought it was going to be between zero and 5% and it was it was much bigger so uh we&#39;ll see maybe they actually be right this year uh in your opinion do you think the following are more likely to double or have in the next big move Bitcoin and Nidia so in December of 2024 52% believe that Nvidia is likely to H more likely to have than to double last year it was only 41% um 61% believe that Bitcoin is is more likely to have um more people thought Nvidia would double last year and more people thought that Bitcoin would double last December so let&#39;s see if they&#39;re right again this year uh S&amp;P entry year declines we covered that that&#39;s just another variation of the Dietrich chart median 2 we s P return since 1950 what they&#39;re trying to portray here Goldman Sachs is that the first half of January tends to be really good uh tends to be up 1.25% an average year Isn&#39;t So average that&#39;s from drick uh boy we brought you more data in a shorter amount of time this week than we ever have and probably ever will so enjoy it uh this is uh home prices turning down that&#39;s good economic surprise index down here&#39;s a Divergence with the 10-year yield so either the economic surprise prizes need to catch back up or the 10-year yield needs to catch back down I think it&#39;s going to be the latter in the short term [Music] um and I think the reason is going to be that companies are going to be guiding down due to the aberrational strength headwind of the US dollar in the fourth quarter so the surprises are going to be negative uh even though the dollar will start turning down which helps them in forward quarters uh uh uh it we we&#39;ll start to see this catch down which means 10year yields down which should be good for mortgage rates which should be good for housing which you can&#39;t give away which is another area we should be paying attention to earnings growth again small cap uh this is in the Russell 200000 because a lot of them are inflecting from negative to positive 53% that&#39;s unbelievable the small cap uh 600 again 21% corporate credit spreads record low Lottery financing going to happen 10e returns around the start of fed cutting cycles first cut okay so we we&#39;re we&#39;re below average for treasuries after the first cut but there&#39;s a huge catch up and it&#39;s always positive so you want to be a buyer TLT not a seller in this in the in the intermediate term for sure dollars Divergence from fair value it&#39;s excessively valued it&#39;s excessively crowded it&#39;s going to change uh I&#39;m optimistic 2025 will be better for me than 2024 uh top countries Indonesia is number one 90% of people believe that Columbia is number two 88% of people believe that China is number three 87% of the Chinese believe 2025 is going to be better than 2024 uh versus the United States we only we&#39;re way down on the list 70% believe that it&#39;s going to be better um and Japan 38% believe remember that was most crowded trade it was just hot money ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going back to China uh small cap ramp and earnings we covered covered that uh NASDAQ made a gravestone dogee for all of you uh on a monthly basis so last time it did that was 2021 before you had the 2022 Tech selloff um so that looks like bad news for people in the mag 7 and in general indices and good news for us however uh the you know uh sentiment Trader says not always a great signal good signal sometimes but there here are you know 1 two 3 four five 6 S 8 nine 10 uh other times and yeah top top top close to a top nowhere near a top uh close to a top top nowhere near a top so it&#39;s a mixed it&#39;s a coin flip so this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that&#39;s going to repeat but it&#39;s something to pay attention to uh small cap earnings growth again here&#39;s the mag 7 here&#39;s the last 10 bubbles oil in the early 2000s NASDAQ in the late 90s nikay in the late 80s gold in the late mid 70s nifty 50 which we just discussed in the 60s so the mag 7 is the most ex stretched out of all of them again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see a crash I see a reating in multiples and I see a new emergence of leadership the companies that benefit from AI versus the companies creating AI uh is is kind of how I&#39;m thinking about it we covered that this is from fund Strat S&amp;P down three days or more in a row in the last five trading days of the year the return median return for January the next year is plus 3.6 q1 plus 5.2 full year plus 12.4 I think that&#39;s well within the realm of possibility I love that empirical data Tom Lee smart guy corporate net interest payments near record low levels corporate balance sheets are in good shape ladies and gentlemen they&#39;re going to get even better refinancing down in the first half of 2025 the investment bankers are going to be busier than a one-arm paper hanger uh here&#39;s the Mosaic of returns we did see Emerging Markets",
    "### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nvalue versus growth trough in 2021 if you remember the peak when you had Ark uh went parabolic and all these you know money losing companies were trading at crazy valuations that was the absolute peak of the crazy town that was still zurp before they started raising rates and since then we&#39;ve started to see the early stages of value uh starting to come to life and fits and starts and just like it did in uh this would have been 2000 equals 2021 and what&#39;s starting to happen and its early days six plus years it&#39;s going to be awesome then you can just see it in the bar chart here uh relative return of growth versus value and here you go uh in the years when value outperforms it outperforms so big and that&#39;s most years ladies and gentlemen I know it&#39;s so hard to believe because this right here this Zer period that I&#39;m showing you is an AB is the exception not the rule and because of recency bias everyone thinks it&#39;s the rule and they&#39;re going to get slaughtered I mean that&#39;s just it&#39;s just math you know there there laws of attract there there laws of physics there laws of Statistics there are laws of gravity there are different things and I&#39;m not I&#39;m the most bullish guy you it&#39;s it&#39;s a strange thing to be seeing this level of extreme and being so bullish because I&#39;m being selective on where I&#39;m being bullish you know the biggest Fortunes in the shortest amount of time were made in the 70s and the the general indices from 1968 to 1981 did 0% 0% in price and that&#39;s where Buffett made all his money gabelli made all his money cooperman made the whole value Mafia made billions of dollars during that period while the indices did nothing and the nifty50 got their asses reamed and the nifty50 back then is the equivalent of the mag 7 today uh the difference was the nifty50 was a company called Avon Cosmetics which just went basically bankrupt sold to Cody for nothing Tupperware IBM blah blah blah all the High Flyers that got smoked and never recovered so um anyway you could tell I&#39;m excited but look at this year by year value outperformed 81 133% 8 82 even 83 out performed by 12% 85 outperformed by 11% every year 5% outperformance 12% 9% 15% 29% outperformance after the tech uh peak in 2000 then you had look at this this is crazy 2000 this was when they put Buffett on the cover and say the old man has lost his touch I think it was Forbes or fortune or whatever because while everyone was buying Global Crossing and Enron he was buying uh caola and American Express and Bank of America and in 2000 when everyone was negative he was positive and here&#39;s what happened value outperformed by 29% 2001 value outperformed by 15% 2002 it outperformed by 12% 2004 outperformed by 10% outperformed by 2% outperformed by 13% and then zero interest rate policy kicked in and you had the swing to the pendulum uh but if you go back to 1927 this was really the only major exception uh except some part of the 60s where you had that level of outperformance during the nifty50 largest five stocks represent 27% you can see here visibly uh I&#39;m just trying to make a point ladies and gentlemen I hope you&#39;re getting it and I hope you extract value from it because it&#39;s important accelerating profits growth would historically favor value value is greater than growth when profits accelerate value performance during the profit cycle 82 to present and we&#39;re seeing uh the acceleration right now largest 7 S&P stocks trade at a 50% premium again this is reverting it&#39;s the beginning of the reversion there&#39;s a lot more reversion to go ladies and gentlemen just look at these if you&#39;re listening to it I really feel bad for you this week you should probably take it 30 minutes just to get out this block you can ignore the TV stuff just listen to that but this part&#39;s important uh more than one in three Russell 2000 companies is unprofitable uh um yeah and this this is presented as it&#39;s a bad thing but if you look at all the periods where small caps dramatically outperformed they all started like this go look at small caps from 2001 to 2007 they all started with the huge percentage unprofitable and then they absolutely dramatically outperformed early 90s same story 2010 same story I midcaps remain historically inexpensive relative to Mega caps we&#39;ve covered that before companies tend to outperform after spin-offs so uh we&#39;ve talked about that in the past spin-offs generate Alpha so we got to be on alert for more spin-offs uh equal weight S&P 500 trough versus cap weighted index uh in July we talked about that with Ash Webster the breath started to broaden we had an Abrupt interruption in December because of the election because of rates in the dollar which again we know we uh know where the probabilities lie Pro respectively regarding those instruments that affect everything else hedge funds shine during periods of heightened volatility that&#39;s what we are entering with higher rates us regime indicator improved in November potentially entering recovery what does that mean what is a regime indicator well high quality lowrisk large size that is what we just came out of what are we going into ladies and gentlemen we just coming out of that we&#39;re going into value small size high risk uh perceived by turnarounds okay turnarounds are perceived as highrisk which is why no one wants them because no one actually likes to read past the price chart and actually understand the balance sheet and cash flows and solvency uh analysis uh which is great I&#39;m glad there&#39;s so little competition in that uh otherwise I&#39;d be out of a job so um so that&#39;s exciting so we&#39;re moving right into this phase one and then uh and so on so this is just where where it&#39;s beginning dividends historically followed EPS we expect dividend growth to accelerate to plus 12% in 20125 a lot of dividend stock opportunities Stanley Black and&amp; Decker back the whole gamut ample room to increase dividend payout ratio is 30% today versus the long-term average of 50% look at this this it&#39;s all this zero interest rate policy nonsense this is going to revert back dividend should contribute more total returns than the last decade the last decade was the exception not the rule historically from 1936 to 2012 before Zer dividend return was 40% of the total return price was only 60% in Zer zero interest rate policy dividend return was 16 price was 84% that game is changing ladies and gentlemen right side ising long duration growth versus cash return value within the S&amp;P has just begun Just Begun dividend yield exp inexpensive versus history we love that we covered that with Ash um this is just a a survey of alternative data sources being used we use some of them low PE tops the survey for n9th year running [Music] um a forward PE so so this is the metric that most managers are using which is kind of comical uh you&#39;re Europeans use more price to free cash flow that&#39;s interesting size increasingly matters they they use Target price no one uses price to sales um share repurchases Etc so it&#39;s just been a little bit crazy town because of free money money is no longer free people are just waking up to that fact that the real estate the real estate market has figured it out uh now the equities Market is starting to figure it out quintile uh Russell 1000 stocks what do we have here top dividend yield so you can see here this is basically a buy list B Baxter International I mean there are just a lot of great companies in here to pay attention to Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow um Nordstrom&#39;s getting takeen private Target maybe Ken view is interesting Staples no one wants that&#39;s kind of interesting Gilead&#39;s already started to move uh some of the refiners Pepsi has been beaten down metronic you can&#39;t give away Healthcare we like that so there&#39;s just a lot of stuff here skyworks is kind of interesting J&amp;J Amgen um M Cisco Molson Kors Kellan NOA Avalon Bay so yeah",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nhistorically value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in the US Often by a striking amount the data covering nearly a century backs up the notion that value stocks those with lower relative prices have higher expected returns while disappointing periods emerge from time to time the principle that lower relative prices lead to higher expected returns Remains the Same value premiums have often shown up quick ly and en llarge magnitudes for example in years when value outperformed growth the average premium was nearly 15% 15% on average value stocks have outperformed growth Stocks by 4.4% annually in the US since 1927 so you can&#39;t see it or understand it here because of this Zer aberration but that&#39;s the aberration the rule is is price is what you pay value what you get and again unless you believe we are going back to Zer which means a depression deflation uh type environment then you want to be getting some exposure to uh getting more for the same amount of money more growth lower multiple same money while Street forecasts a bigger increase in earnings for small caps we covered that average small cap returns have been particularly strong when inflation has been 1 to 3% uh periods of rising m&a activity have historically delivered strong Equity returns particularly you can see here uh for small caps and midcaps as well and then uh okay credit this from Seth golden credit card debt rising to new record levels is good credit card debt has fallen so people are saying credit card debts at record high well the only time that credit card debt goes down is when you&#39;re in a recession so the last thing you want to to root for is uh credit card balance is going down that&#39;s all I can say what matters is Debt Service as a percentage of disposable income and that&#39;s near multi-decade lows uh labor markets are fully rebalanced should continue to see wage and services disinflation uh us growth outperformance was driven by outsized increase in productivity two 12,000 people turning 35 every day in the US here&#39;s that market breath chart again that is probably the most important one of the week pboc People&#39;s Bank of China steps up liquidity injections via new tools so they&#39;re getting with it they&#39;re just kind of biting their time until the inauguration and as they did last time you can see the dramatic underperformance of the Dow in December was just a a weird situation that&#39;ll bounce back like a rubber band ball you&#39;re already seeing it uh today with some of the mag sevens getting hit Etc these were the charts that I talked about pmo buy all at zero that&#39;s usually a time to be buying stuff SPX buying stuff National Association of active investment managers down uh these are all good signs uh if you know how to pick stocks large gains tend to happen more more than you expected here&#39;s the late 90s it can go for a number of years uh 50s Etc Chinese government Buy dropped meaningfully in 2004 same story before the election uh before the inauguration we expect double- digit returns from most actively attractively valued Global markets so expected returns in US dollars us. is the lowest China and Brazil are the highest this is from Morning Star Investment Management S&P after it falls at least three consecutive days to end the year uh on average a month later it&#39;s up 6% % so we&#39;ll see if that happens uh first year of the presidential cycle is usually weak the exception was Trump Trump&#39;s back so maybe this will be another exception we&#39;ll find out 20% yearly gain suggest more green but don&#39;t expect a bigger year than 2023 average return after these type of gains is 10% I think that&#39;s in the neighborhood of reasonable uh this is lining up 2000 to uh 2021 again and how value is starting to come back in fits and starts and will will start to scream back sooner than people are expecting uh X recessions inflation tends to rise about 6 months after the first red cut we&#39;re on track with that dollar spot index around election days 2016 and 2024 so again uh people are picking up on what we&#39;ve been saying for months Tok or not months after Trump got elected dollar is going to go up then it&#39;s going to go down after the inauguration same with yields Tokyo CPI going up which means jgb these yields will be going up which means carry trade will be unwinding which means what all that hot money is coming out of Mag 7 inflation in Japan&#39;s Central Capital inflation in Japan&#39;s capital accelerates keeps rate hike prospects intact rate hikes equals unwind carry trade equals unwind mag 7 or rate mag 7 to lower more realistic multiples in line with increased capex and lower Returns on that capx um decelerating return on invested capital China 10-year government bond yield same story we covered China plans record $411 billion special treasury bond IND uh issuance next year for fiscal spending no one&#39;s paying attention uh S&amp;P 500 Mo members below their 50-day moving average it&#39;s usually an opportunity to buy not sell like last October Dallas fed manufacturing turning up we&#39;re coming out of the manufacturing depression that we&#39;ve been in for 3 years um same story with the Chinese Yuan uh devalue before the inauguration China non-manufacturing PMI is turning up into expansion no one&#39;s paying attention to it China&#39;s service activity jumps as stimulus boosts local demand monthly Market breath we covered that in case that wasn&#39;t an important enough chart uh public versus private Enterprise Value to ebit a multiples here&#39;s automotive sales volume is through the roof that is good for albamar because they&#39;re selling all the EV story is there people are getting faked out because the demand is decelerating in the developed market for EVS but accelerating for hybrids and in China it&#39;s still through the roof because it&#39;s an unnatural stimulated market and that&#39;s going to continue that helps that Supply glut in lithium start to normalize over the next 12 to 18 months and albam Maro has the operating Leverage G the staying power with 3.4 billion of liquidity to hockey stick as a result uh wall Street&#39;s predictions for uh uh S&amp;P 500 end ofe targets the highest is Deutsche Bank at 7,000 the median is 6600 which implies you know 10 11% gain um we&#39;ll see what extent do you think the Magnificent Seven tech stocks will either be up or down in 2025 we will bucket the answers so slide as near as possible to your desired answer so they&#39;re expecting the the biggest concentration of people are expecting mag 7 to only be up 0 to 10% whereas last year they expected it to be up last December they expected this year to be up 20 to 30% and they were right so they&#39;re expecting way more subdued returns from mag 7 this year where do you see the 10-year treasury yields at the end of 2025 uh the biggest proportion are seeing it between 425 and 450 so lower than here uh and another big group is between 375 to 4 I think that&#39;s a a reasonable range I think four is the right number [Music] um what do you think the return of the S&amp;P 500 will be in 2025 this is all from Deutsche Bank by the way survey uh the bulk vast majority think the biggest 35% think it&#39;s going to be between 5 and 10% I&#39;m in that group last year the biggest group thought it was going to be between zero and 5% and it was it was much bigger so uh we&#39;ll see maybe they actually be right this year uh in your opinion do you think the following are more likely to double or have in the next big move Bitcoin and Nidia so in December of 2024 52% believe that Nvidia is likely to H more likely to have than to double last year it was only 41% um 61% believe that Bitcoin is is more likely to have um more people thought Nvidia would double last year and more people thought that Bitcoin would double last December so let&#39;s see if they&#39;re right again this year uh S&amp;P entry year declines we covered that that&#39;s just another variation of the Dietrich chart median 2 we s P return since 1950 what they&#39;re trying to portray here Goldman Sachs is that the first half of January tends to be really good uh tends to be up 1.25% an average year Isn&#39;t So average that&#39;s from drick uh boy we brought you more data in a shorter amount of time this week than we ever have and probably ever will so enjoy it uh this is uh home prices turning down that&#39;s good economic surprise index down here&#39;s a Divergence with the 10-year yield so either the economic surprise prizes need to catch back up or the 10-year yield needs to catch back down I think it&#39;s going to be the latter in the short term [Music] um and I think the reason is going to be that companies are going to be guiding down due to the aberrational strength headwind of the US dollar in the fourth quarter so the surprises are going to be negative uh even though the dollar will start turning down which helps them in forward quarters uh uh uh it we we&#39;ll start to see this catch down which means 10year yields down which should be good for mortgage rates which should be good for housing which you can&#39;t give away which is another area we should be paying attention to earnings growth again small cap uh this is in the Russell 200000 because a lot of them are inflecting from negative to positive 53% that&#39;s unbelievable the small cap uh 600 again 21% corporate credit spreads record low Lottery financing going to happen 10e returns around the start of fed cutting cycles first cut okay so we we&#39;re we&#39;re below average for treasuries after the first cut but there&#39;s a huge catch up and it&#39;s always positive so you want to be a buyer TLT not a seller in this in the in the intermediate term for sure dollars Divergence from fair value it&#39;s excessively valued it&#39;s excessively crowded it&#39;s going to change uh I&#39;m optimistic 2025 will be better for me than 2024 uh top countries Indonesia is number one 90% of people believe that Columbia is number two 88% of people believe that China is number three 87% of the Chinese believe 2025 is going to be better than 2024 uh versus the United States we only we&#39;re way down on the list 70% believe that it&#39;s going to be better um and Japan 38% believe remember that was most crowded trade it was just hot money ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going back to China uh small cap ramp and earnings we covered covered that uh NASDAQ made a gravestone dogee for all of you uh on a monthly basis so last time it did that was 2021 before you had the 2022 Tech selloff um so that looks like bad news for people in the mag 7 and in general indices and good news for us however uh the you know uh sentiment Trader says not always a great signal good signal sometimes but there here are you know 1 two 3 four five 6 S 8 nine 10 uh other times and yeah top top top close to a top nowhere near a top uh close to a top top nowhere near a top so it&#39;s a mixed it&#39;s a coin flip so this doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that&#39;s going to repeat but it&#39;s something to pay attention to uh small cap earnings growth again here&#39;s the mag 7 here&#39;s the last 10 bubbles oil in the early 2000s NASDAQ in the late 90s nikay in the late 80s gold in the late mid 70s nifty 50 which we just discussed in the 60s so the mag 7 is the most ex stretched out of all of them again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see a crash I see a reating in multiples and I see a new emergence of leadership the companies that benefit from AI versus the companies creating AI uh is is kind of how I&#39;m thinking about it we covered that this is from fund Strat S&amp;P down three days or more in a row in the last five trading days of the year the return median return for January the next year is plus 3.6 q1 plus 5.2 full year plus 12.4 I think that&#39;s well within the realm of possibility I love that empirical data Tom Lee smart guy corporate net interest payments near record low levels corporate balance sheets are in good shape ladies and gentlemen they&#39;re going to get even better refinancing down in the first half of 2025 the investment bankers are going to be busier than a one-arm paper hanger uh here&#39;s the Mosaic of returns we did see Emerging Markets",
    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\nthat process probably stretching out into the beginning of the second quarter I don&#39;t think beyond that but that&#39;s our expectation at the moment because we have to respect the CMA they do a really good job and it&#39;s quite correct and proper that we work with them to seek clarification on the points that they&#39;ve raised all right so that is the most important Lynch pin that and who they&#39;re going to um name as the new CEO and the rest of these amazing business developments you can read on your own fear and greed is down to 28 that&#39;s not what you see at tops um congratulations to all the new clients that came in during our 2024 raises you could not be better positioned for what we believe will be a highly rewarding year in 2025 this view is based on much of the data we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on our podcast videoast as well as our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those details on your behalf we reopened to smaller accounts 1 million plus again starting last week because we want to be fully positioned as soon as possible before the inauguration based on some of the data we&#39;ve referenced in our recent podcast videoast episodes and will&#39;ll remain open for for the next couple of weeks but no close no later than the inauguration congratulations to all of you I had the pleasure of speaking with and onboarding last week after we opened up we expect your applications to be approved before the end of this week some were approved yesterday that&#39;s why we put money to work today uh not yesterday but uh earlier in the weekend today uh so that we can begin deploying Capital immediately to see if you qualify that so you can click there all this is opinion not advice healthc care earnings top 30 weights have been revised down one 1.30% in the last 60 days uh financials have been revised up 1.17 uh economic data we covered so that&#39;s it for the podcast part now we&#39;re going to go into the question and answer\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\n\neuronet world wide might be worth a deeper look I&#39;m curious what your thoughts are EFT let&#39;s see here what do they do payment and transaction process and Distribution Solutions for financial institutions retailers electronic fund transfer processes money transfer uh ATM stuff yeah look uh the numbers look great on this coros [Music] um I think it&#39;s definitely worth a look we would not be involved in this because we already have PayPal exposure we don&#39;t want two of similar sector necessarily but um you just have to understand what is their durable advantages their MO intact and if so    you probably have a decent situation here take a look at the balance sheet yeah I think this is reasonable good work    definitely worth a further exploration ior Barry are there any single names you would Express to the Healthcare through uh where you&#39;re expressing through xbi do you think any individual names look good at the moment uh we like Baxter we own Baxter and we own xbi    you know we would look at fizer we&#39;d look at some others but    uh that&#39;s what we own at present we&#39;re not going to own six Healthcare stocks when you have a portfolio of 10 12 companies you generally only do one to maximum two per sector and between xbi and Baxter we we feel we have enough exposure    at the moment but are keeping our mind open on to the next Ryan Wang are you how concerned are you that gxo acquisition of Winton could get blocked by the UK it&#39;s priced in as if it&#39;s already been blocked so if anything less than blocking happens the stock goes up    so I&#39;m not worried what&#39;s your opinion on SLX seems like steel sector is ready for a bounce let&#39;s see I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t like steel socks they just chronically suck I    I don&#39;t see what you see so I&#39;m a pass even the companies I look at like Cliffs and I keep looking at them keep doing nothing that they&#39;re trading Vehicles they&#39;re not businesses you want to own for the long term    want to get your take on Bill acman this is from Jason Zen Bill amman&#39;s recent public awareness campaign on the asymmetric bet that is Fanny May and Freddy Mack on the conservative ship being lifted and their stocks potentially being a multibagger it&#39;s a special situation but not necessarily a turnaround would love your color on it thanks for all you do and provide Jason    as far as I know he&#39;s owned it since uh Trump 1.0 and he was doing the same public awareness campaign    during the first Administration and Trump never lifted the uh conservatorship so maybe he&#39;ll do it this time but if you follow that theory last time it was dead money evvy this is from Jared Davis Evolution AB financials look great I got to understand the business online casino systems to gaming operations in Europe I think someone else brought brought that up    this tends to be a very yeah I think this is like International game Tech in the US I tend to not like these because they do great until they don&#39;t and then they just blow up for no reason because it&#39;s like very cyclical it looks perfect now financially but    you&#39;d have to do a lot of work on it and just understand how it&#39;s going to out earn the normal cyclicality and the unpredictability of that business    all right what is your opinion not advice check terms on Starbucks and wi we covered both of these    Starbucks was a turnaround I think it&#39;s going to continue to turn around the issue with both of them is there uh for us    Starbucks didn&#39;t really get cheap enough and I think competition is it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a China play as is win and we have enough China exposure through Alibaba so we&#39;re not that interested [Music]    um I just don&#39;t I like I think Baba is a much easier double than than win or um Starbucks at these levels so for that reason uh we&#39;re just agnostic good businesses they&#39;re going up the question is how much    Tom you crush it on vno could you please take a look at HPP we&#39;ve looked at HPP a bunch of times this is uh a high lever there was a little inside buying this week    they&#39;re trading like they&#39;re going bankrupt and there&#39;s a decent chance they might but if they don&#39;t you got a $16 stock so on that basis I can&#39;t get Comfort I can&#39;t see all their leases I can&#39;t understand it    as clearly as I could have understood Vado because I don&#39;t know the buildings I don&#39;t know the companies that inhabit it but    you know it&#39;s largely mag 7 I think big Tech stuff I met one of the directors a couple of years ago and    he was was pitching me on it at 15 and now it&#39;s    286 so I didn&#39;t bite at 15    uh I&#39;m not really interested in this one it&#39;s too much it&#39;s highrisk high reward but there&#39;s too much in the risk part and I I don&#39;t need to you know rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two is don&#39;t forget rule number one I don&#39;t care if it takes me three years if I&#39;ve got a short thing if if if I&#39;ve got a gamble thing for like three up one down that&#39;s that&#39;s a Traders game and that&#39;s not what we do Sarah Wells ask what&#39;s your birth Tom well it isn&#39;t\n\n Starbucks and wi we covered both of these uh Starbucks was a turnaround I think it's going to continue to turn around the issue with both of them is there uh for us um Starbucks didn't really get cheap enough and I think competition is it's it's a it's a China play as is win and we have enough China exposure through Alibaba so we're not that interested [Music] um I just don't I like I think Baba is a much easier double than than win or um Starbucks at these levels so for that reason uh we're just agnostic good businesses they're going up the question is how much  Tom you crush it on vno could you please take a look at HPP we've looked at HPP a bunch of times this is uh a high lever there was a little inside buying this week um they're trading like they're going bankrupt and there's a decent

pitching me on it at 15 and now it's uh 286 so I didn't bite at 15 uh I'm not really interested in this one it's too much it's highrisk high reward but there's too much in the risk part and I I don't need to you know rule number one is don't lose money rule number two is don't forget rule number one I don't care if it takes me three years if I've got a short thing if if if I've got a gamble thing for like three up one down that's that's a Traders game and that's not what we do ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nChris Henderson ask can you take a look at Align? I think their moat uh has been attacked the stock has been dead money for seven eight years. Digital Bridge (DBRG) sector is super hot well cash flows are going down along with the price. Philip Andrew pinkos thought on Ambev (ABEV)? I think I&#39;d rather do I mean this is another one that&#39;s been dead money for 10 years. I&#39;d rather buy DIIO best-in class deal with the Tariff risk uh or even Brown Forman and deal with the higher um margin Spirits. Mattel (MAT) is just you know my kids don&#39;t even have toys everything&#39;s on the iPad so yeah they&#39;re moving into the entertainment business and all that stuff I I just don&#39;t like this business it it it just chronically sucks I mean if you&#39;re going to buy one of the toy companies you buy Hasbro (HAS). Thoughts on Occidental Petroleum (OXY)? Exxon Mobile (XOM) in the low3s and uh Wells Fargo (WFC) at 25 we buy down here I up here there&#39;s no asymmetry like it&#39;s not going to 150 in a week so if you want something that&#39;s a little better than a bond that&#39;s going to pay a dividend and it might double in five years great. Slumberger (SLB) stock which we&#39;ve already gotten more than a double and it&#39;s going to we&#39;re probably going to get another multibagger from that uh because there&#39;s asymmetry I&#39;m not seeing that in a lot of these energy stocks like we saw it in 2020 when we were jumping up like a hyena buy everything when oil went negative so for me it&#39;s a pass it&#39;s just it&#39;s just blah. Jay apt please take a look at Carvana (CVNA) no interest. Zara Bassam pgny uh let&#39;s take a look at that Zara oh that&#39;s interesting let&#39;s take a look I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be some type of Biotech which I&#39;m going to say I have no Edge but it does look like it&#39;s ready to rock and roll. Aaron Seth thoughts on xmag S&P 500 excluding the Magnificent seven yeah why not. Chris Patterson thank you for all your book recommendations over the year can you take a look at Celanese (CE)?

      "with gxo Logistics update uh they had the rumor where they were going to be sold stock shot up to uh from 46 to 63 and then it wasn't going to be sold and it and shot down to 40 now 41 now it's 43 but as you can see the free cash flow is steady and solid revenues continue to grow they had record re revenues record eida good organic growth um and uh price Target upgrade by Oppenheimer to $67 it's trading at $43 that's a 12mon price Target and that's after the news about the um CMA going to level two with regard to the winon acquisition uh there two overhangs on the stock ladies and gentlemen so you don't have to analyze the logistics business because they own it uh what you need to analyze is are these two overhangs worth a 20% a $20 drop in the stock and the answer is no um and I'll tell you why first and foremost this guy um um is retiring at um 65 which is a normal retirement age for a public company CEO maybe he could go to 6 67 he had a good run and you never know why but 65 if he was 55 I'd be a little worried uh so now you've got this whole waight who's going to be the new CEO so you're going to have an overhang on the stock it's not going to do much until they announce who's the new CEO and knowing Brad Jacobs who attracts winners he's going to get a rockstar in there the stock will it will be a major Catalyst there's nothing to turn around there the Stock's doing the the performance of the business is doing great which is why people were uh unsolicited unsolicited offering tenders to buy the company so um that's number one number two is the referral of winon acquisition to the CMA in the UK after the fact so they did the deal last March they are waiting to merge the companies they're running side bys side silos winon has lower margins than gxo but when they start to operate them as one unit that's where they're going to get the synergies and dramatically increase the margins of winon which is a great business and have an unbelievable business in the UK winon is is um is concentrated there so you know 3/4 billion doll deal 735 million pounds and so you have to look at what's the worst case scenario the worst case scenario is the the CMA which is the UK regulator says you can't do the deal it's anti-competitive and if they were going to do that you would think they would do it before the acquisition and you think the company would be on track now you could say maybe this guy completely screwed up and that's why he's you know forced retired and that there certainly could be that and that's what the that's what the stock is saying to you right now down $40 down to $40 based on the underlying operations the business is saying there's a problem here what if winon gets un unround well if Winton gets unround Unwound you get your $753 million back on the balance sheet number one you go make another acquisition or you invest in uh the business which they have a huge High return on operating operating return on invested capital of 30 plus perc so I don't mind them having 750 million on cash the most likely thing and the CEO uh discussed it in the earnings call which is why uh we we spend so much time on the earnings call which we're going to go into now is that it's very normal for these size Acquisitions to go into uh phase two with the CMA they require details they're trying to make sure it's not going to be a monopoly um look it's going to be a great business and um and I think they'll have to have some concessions about uh different things so it doesn't become a monopoly per se uh but they'll do that and it will be a great combination and everything will be fine it's just going to delay the synergies by a quarter or two uh but the the stock price is discounting an unwind of the deal and um and if there's no unwind which is where the probabilities are then you're going to get a reversion back to 50 and then from there you're going to get a CEO maybe 55 and then they're going to continue to perform on their 2027 plan and then we think it's a double plus so um again opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips click on terms it's right up here boom but um we don't we really don't get into anything unless we think it can be a double over a few years so um so that's that you can see the fundamentals continue to perform pre- Winton post winkon uh and they will continue to perform so let's cover some of the key things uh the revenue was up 28% year onye 3% of that was organic growth the rest was acquisitive their sales pipeline increased 30% to 2.4 billion they signed three4 of a billion dollars of new annualized Revenue in the quarter on track to win a record level of business in 2024 this doesn't even sound like a turnaround but it's priced like a turnaround which we love uh highest ever quarterly revenue of 3.2 billion signed 226 million of new business seeing demand for e-commerce capacity long-term structural Tailwind uh key Dr key growth driver for us over the past five years um generated almost $200 million of cash flow from operations 120 110 million of free cash flow and um they've got uh five half a billion dollars of cash if the deal got Unwound they'd have 1.25 billion doll of cash uh net 2.2 billion of net debt which is very reasonable considering the amount of free cash flow that they're generating their guidance they reaffirmed adjusted eBid of 800 to 835 million two call it 283 of earnings uh $283 of uh of earnings and free cash flow conversion of 30 to 40% so highlights we covered here are some of the recent wins you can recognize some of these Brands Orlando LG guest L'Oreal Jim shark uh bewd pie I don't know what that is that must be European new contract wins and Outsourcing underpin long-term growth so they got 29% of their new wins from competitors 40% from new activity uh from existing competitor existing clients and 31% from Outsourcing strong cash flow and investment grade balance sheet which we covered number one Pure Play contract Logistics provider 27 countries of operation 30% of Fortune F Fortune 100 companies served $10 billion in 2023 Revenue that's going up a lot um and so on so uh just want to get through some of the key things here you can see by region 40 UK is 41% of their business us is 48 so it's a it is a play on the recovery in Europe they've got 8% in the Netherlands 8% in France 5% in Spain 4% in Italy 6% in others so this is a beautiful leveraged uh play uh on a niche business in a market that we think is going to see great recovery in coming years and they are going to be the greatest beneficiary of that recovery um here are some of their other Blue Chip customers you can see bear guest lvmh Levis Lor Nike Pepsi TJX Samsung uh Kell NOA JD Heineken Red Bull Versace Boeing by the way Boeing they talked about a large US Aerospace company which they got huge new business so you know it's it's just an incredible business by 2027 they're going to do 16 billion at Top Line EOB about 1.3 billion uh operating return on invested capital of 30% and um e adjusted EA kager so organic Revenue kager 10% so this thing is just going to be a machine and you get to those type of levels um minimum double but then you get multiple reating and that's where you get extra juice that you didn't expect when all the Lemmings start to follow in after the double High conversion of adjusted iida to free cash flow flow to cash flow and you can see the waterfall there all right let's get into some of the key highlights from the earnings call transcript that we haven't covered yet $750 million in new business year-to date uh We've mentioned that we saw the bottom of the inventory cycle in the fourth quarter of last year we've been talking about that for a year and a half that that was going to the bottom it certainly has proven the dstock restock as we head into this year's Peak we're seeing inventory levels returning to normal and demand for e-commerce capacity is accelerating as commercial activity picks up momentum our technology differentiation through the deployment of Automation and AI is creating a multiplier effect in the efficiencies we deliver to customers on the back of real world results we are proud to have been recognized with a supply chain Excellence award for our leadership and Warehouse AI by Logistics manager a few weeks ago [Music] um Etc uptick in e-commerce activity Tech F Logistics exper about a third of our new business wins year-to date have come from newly outsourced business around 40% of our 2.4 billion pipeline is made up of customers looking to outsourc for the first time the acceleration of out sourcing is in part a result of the recovery of e-commerce and it drives customers to look for a partner with scale Automation and the ability to manage complexity gxo as well position to capture growth from these Trends gxo has been piloting our first proprietary AI application in select warehouses in the US our tool streamlines our customers fulfillment processes by using machine learning to predict SKU demand in the near term the sheer volume data volume of data analyzed by our tool produces High highly accurate forecast of inventory flows down to the SKU level these insights enable our operation teams to optimize the layout of the warehouse and match Resources with demand our initial Pilots have far exceeded our expectations delivering predictive accuracy levels above 90% and productivity improvements of 3 to 4X in stock replenishments which Drive increased capacity of 6 to 8% at no additional cost we're thrilled with the early success of AI and we're scared scaling it across our footprint AI is going to change the way warehouses are run over the next few years and our leadership in the space is a key driver of our long-term profitable growth this is the next phase of the AI story ladies and gentlemen not the people um selling chips it's the regular businesses benefiting and improving profitability and productivity from the employment of that not a better search engine that's that game is you know that happen but that's not the that's not the key game so um very strong player in the Aerospace I'm sure Aerospace we going to do incredibly well in Europe it's a huge Market very few competitors will be the new will be the new kid on the Block and I think we'll do really well uh so here this analyst asks in the Q&A what about winon and the potential malol Wilson the current CEO uh talks about win Winton and he says let me cover the Winton port point and I'll hand you over to Baris in terms of a more detailed aspect on the margin so with Winton clearly you know we're reviewing the decisions the phase one decisions that came across last Friday so we're reviewing that in detail at the moment and clearly as we have on other projects we're going to be engaging very constructively and collaboratively with the CMA we're kind of remaining pretty confident that we're going to see a positive outcome to it it's possible that we'll go to phase two which they did and you know frankly I mean we are prepared for all the potential outcomes that this might bring and it is not an uncommon environment by the way for a deal of this size to go into phase two okay and then he goes on to talk about excluding winon winon we have improved our margin every quarter this year so you know Winton will be a drag until they can merge the operations of those or if it's Unwound margins will actually go back up uh when you look at winton's margins they are lower than ours at the moment but that is the upside in 2025 and onwards then we start integrating the business and we capture the synergies okay not actually uncommon for a deal this size to go into what the CMA class as a phase two type process it's a much more detailed process which is good good not bad and basically we'll work with the CMA to make some clarification in terms of the different Market verticals that exist in the UK UK is a highly competitive environment there's no question about that and as a British guy I'm probably well equipped to comment on that it is a highly competitive environment so Our intention is to do some detailed work with the CMA teams over the coming months I think what that will do do is it will help us clarify greatly the situation and as I mentioned we're confident that we'll secure a good satisfactory positive outcome through the process one of the things that probably it will involve is where we had planned to commence integration of the two businesses in early January I think it's fair to say we might see a delay on that process probably stretching out into the beginning of the second quarter I don't think beyond that but that's our expectation at the moment because we have to respect the CMA they do a really good job and it's quite correct and proper that we work with them to seek clarification on the points that they've raised"

      "Blue Chip customers you can see bear guest lvmh Levis Lor Nike Pepsi TJX Samsung uh Kell NOA JD Heineken Red Bull Versace Boeing by the way Boeing they talked about a large US Aerospace company which they got huge new business so you know it's it's just an incredible business by 2027 they're going to do 16 billion at Top Line EOB about 1.3 billion uh operating return on invested capital of 30% and um e adjusted EA kager so organic Revenue kager 10% so this thing is just going to be a machine and you get to those type of levels um minimum double but then you get multiple reating and that's where you get extra juice that you didn't expect when all the Lemmings start to follow in after the double High conversion of adjusted iida to free cash flow flow to cash flow and you can see the waterfall there all right let's get into some of the key highlights from the earnings call transcript that we haven't covered yet $750 million in new business year-to date uh We've mentioned that we saw the bottom of the inventory cycle in the fourth quarter of last year we've been talking about that for a year and a half that that was going to the bottom it certainly has proven the dstock restock as we head into this year's Peak we're seeing inventory levels returning to normal and demand for e-commerce capacity is accelerating as commercial activity picks up momentum our technology differentiation through the deployment of Automation and AI is creating a multiplier effect in the efficiencies we deliver to customers on the back of real world results we are proud to have been recognized with a supply chain Excellence award for our leadership and Warehouse AI by Logistics manager a few weeks ago [Music] um Etc uptick in e-commerce activity Tech F Logistics exper about a third of our new business wins year-to date have come from newly outsourced business around 40% of our 2.4 billion pipeline is made up of customers looking to outsourc for the first time the acceleration of out sourcing is in part a result of the recovery of e-commerce and it drives customers to look for a partner with scale Automation and the ability to manage complexity gxo as well position to capture growth from these Trends gxo has been piloting our first proprietary AI application in select warehouses in the US our tool streamlines our customers fulfillment processes by using machine learning to predict SKU demand in the near term the sheer volume data volume of data analyzed by our tool produces High highly accurate forecast of inventory flows down to the SKU level these insights enable our operation teams to optimize the layout of the warehouse and match Resources with demand our initial Pilots have far exceeded our expectations delivering predictive accuracy levels above 90% and productivity improvements of 3 to 4X in stock replenishments which Drive increased capacity of 6 to 8% at no additional cost we're thrilled with the early success of AI and we're scared scaling it across our footprint AI is going to change the way warehouses are run over the next few years and our leadership in the space is a key driver of our long-term profitable growth this is the next phase of the AI story ladies and gentlemen not the people um selling chips it's the regular businesses benefiting and improving profitability and productivity from the employment of that not a better search engine that's that game is you know that happen but that's not the that's not the key game so um very strong player in the Aerospace I'm sure Aerospace we going to do incredibly well in Europe it's a huge Market very few competitors will be the new will be the new kid on the Block and I think we'll do really well uh so here this analyst asks in the Q&A what about winon and the potential malol Wilson the current CEO uh talks about win Winton and he says let me cover the Winton port point and I'll hand you over to Baris in terms of a more detailed aspect on the margin so with Winton clearly you know we're reviewing the decisions the phase one decisions that came across last Friday so we're reviewing that in detail at the moment and clearly as we have on other projects we're going to be engaging very constructively and collaboratively with the CMA we're kind of remaining pretty confident that we're going to see a positive outcome to it it's possible that we'll go to phase two which they did and you know frankly I mean we are prepared for all the potential outcomes that this might bring and it is not an uncommon environment by the way for a deal of this size to go into phase two okay and then he goes on to talk about excluding winon winon we have improved our margin every quarter this year so you know Winton will be a drag until they can merge the operations of those or if it's Unwound margins will actually go back up uh when you look at winton's margins they are lower than ours at the moment but that is the upside in 2025 and onwards then we start integrating the business and we capture the synergies okay not actually uncommon for a deal this size to go into what the CMA class as a phase two type process it's a much more detailed process which is good good not bad and basically we'll work with the CMA to make some clarification in terms of the different Market verticals that exist in the UK UK is a highly competitive environment there's no question about that and as a British guy I'm probably well equipped to comment on that it is a highly competitive environment so Our intention is to do some detailed work with the CMA teams over the coming months I think what that will do do is it will help us clarify greatly the situation and as I mentioned we're confident that we'll secure a good satisfactory positive outcome through the process one of the things that probably it will involve is where we had planned to commence integration of the two businesses in early January I think it's fair to say we might see a delay on that process probably stretching out into the beginning of the second quarter I don't think beyond that but that's our expectation at the moment because we have to respect the CMA they do a really good job and it's quite correct and proper that we work with them to seek clarification on the points that they've raised"

      "euronet world wide might be worth a deeper look I&#39;m curious what your thoughts are EFT let&#39;s see here what do they do payment and transaction process and Distribution Solutions for financial institutions retailers electronic fund transfer processes money transfer uh ATM stuff yeah look uh the numbers look great on this coros [Music] um I think it&#39;s definitely worth a look we would not be involved in this because we already have PayPal exposure we don&#39;t want two of similar sector necessarily but um you just have to understand what is their durable advantages their MO intact and if so    you probably have a decent situation here take a look at the balance sheet yeah I think this is reasonable good work    definitely worth a further exploration ior Barry are there any single names you would Express to the Healthcare through uh where you&#39;re expressing through xbi do you think any individual names look good at the moment uh we like Baxter we own Baxter and we own xbi    you know we would look at fizer we&#39;d look at some others but    uh that&#39;s what we own at present we&#39;re not going to own six Healthcare stocks when you have a portfolio of 10 12 companies you generally only do one to maximum two per sector and between xbi and Baxter we we feel we have enough exposure    at the moment but are keeping our mind open on to the next Ryan Wang are you how concerned are you that gxo acquisition of Winton could get blocked by the UK it&#39;s priced in as if it&#39;s already been blocked so if anything less than blocking happens the stock goes up    so I&#39;m not worried what&#39;s your opinion on SLX seems like steel sector is ready for a bounce let&#39;s see I don&#39;t I generally don&#39;t like steel socks they just chronically suck I    I don&#39;t see what you see so I&#39;m a pass even the companies I look at like Cliffs and I keep looking at them keep doing nothing that they&#39;re trading Vehicles they&#39;re not businesses you want to own for the long term    want to get your take on Bill acman this is from Jason Zen Bill amman&#39;s recent public awareness campaign on the asymmetric bet that is Fanny May and Freddy Mack on the conservative ship being lifted and their stocks potentially being a multibagger it&#39;s a special situation but not necessarily a turnaround would love your color on it thanks for all you do and provide Jason    as far as I know he&#39;s owned it since uh Trump 1.0 and he was doing the same public awareness campaign    during the first Administration and Trump never lifted the uh conservatorship so maybe he&#39;ll do it this time but if you follow that theory last time it was dead money evvy this is from Jared Davis Evolution AB financials look great I got to understand the business online casino systems to gaming operations in Europe I think someone else brought brought that up    this tends to be a very yeah I think this is like International game Tech in the US I tend to not like these because they do great until they don&#39;t and then they just blow up for no reason because it&#39;s like very cyclical it looks perfect now financially but    you&#39;d have to do a lot of work on it and just understand how it&#39;s going to out earn the normal cyclicality and the unpredictability of that business    all right what is your opinion not advice check terms on Starbucks and wi we covered both of these    Starbucks was a turnaround I think it&#39;s going to continue to turn around the issue with both of them is there uh for us    Starbucks didn&#39;t really get cheap enough and I think competition is it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a China play as is win and we have enough China exposure through Alibaba so we&#39;re not that interested [Music]    um I just don&#39;t I like I think Baba is a much easier double than than win or um Starbucks at these levels so for that reason uh we&#39;re just agnostic good businesses they&#39;re going up the question is how much    Tom you crush it on vno could you please take a look at HPP we&#39;ve looked at HPP a bunch of times this is uh a high lever there was a little inside buying this week    they&#39;re trading like they&#39;re going bankrupt and there&#39;s a decent chance they might but if they don&#39;t you got a $16 stock so on that basis I can&#39;t get Comfort I can&#39;t see all their leases I

think big Tech stuff I met one of the directors a couple of years ago and    he was was pitching me on it at 15 and now it&#39;s    286 so I didn&#39;t bite at 15    uh I&#39;m not really interested in this one it&#39;s too much it&#39;s highrisk high reward but there&#39;s too much in the risk part and I I don&#39;t need to you know rule number one is don&#39;t lose money rule number two is
