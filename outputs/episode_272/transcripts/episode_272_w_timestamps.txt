[0.399s] welcome to hedge fund tips with Tom
[2.52s] Hayes I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.68s] 272nd videoast podcast for the week
[8.559s] ending January 2nd
[10.84s] 2025 happy New Year everyone we&#39;re going
[13.16s] to have a great one this year very
[15.44s] excited about the reasons why which
[17.0s] we&#39;re going to share with you in this
[19.4s] podcast but as always family first
[21.72s] that&#39;s Caitlyn and I headed out for New
[23.72s] Year&#39;s Eve in California for the first
[26.119s] time uh that&#39;s the first Christmas tree
[28.24s] it&#39;s funny and uh Connecticut for 15
[31.16s] years we had a fake Christmas tree and
[33.32s] now we&#39;re in California and we have a
[35.2s] real Christmas tree go figure that&#39;s uh
[37.6s] me and the kids reloading some vans in
[40.719s] Costa Mesa this week uh reloaded on the
[44.559s] lowlands which I love I&#39;ve got three
[46.16s] pairs of those now they went with the
[47.559s] more classic Styles uh this was very
[50.44s] interesting this post this is a famous
[53.16s] breast uh breakfast place in Orange
[55.719s] County called Sugar Shack uh right near
[58.199s] the beach and I thought the headline was
[60.8s] very interesting it said popular
[64.239s] downtown caf&#39;s secret to success is not
[68.52s] changing with the times and it reminds
[70.84s] me a lot of Warren Buffett buying
[73.68s] durable uh cash flowing businesses
[76.32s] through different cycles that have
[77.68s] durable Moes and we&#39;ll talk a little bit
[79.96s] about that because often times when the
[82.84s] shiny objects are having their day in
[84.92s] the sun uh it&#39;s very very easy to get
[87.68s] distracted but but like Icarus who flew
[90.52s] too close to the Sun uh they come
[92.84s] crashing down and they come crashing
[94.28s] down hard and we&#39;re going to talk about
[95.92s] that uh not any crashes or anything like
[98.439s] that but just some data over 120
[101.6s] something years that&#39;s going to help you
[103.2s] understand the perspective and the
[104.68s] framework that we have and why we have
[106.88s] it uh that was at the party at the new
[108.96s] club uh Caitlyn looking ravishing as
[111.479s] always that was the family uh on
[114.439s] Christmas we we went out to dinner at
[116.479s] this uh hotel right on the beach which
[118.439s] was pretty awesome that&#39;s Caitlyn&#39;s dad
[120.88s] my father-in-law Steve uh there&#39;s the uh
[124.0s] Caitlyn and the girls again and that&#39;s
[125.64s] just us uh going out to Sushi the other
[127.96s] night so fun stuff uh on to the media
[131.72s] want to thank Preston misel and
[134.76s] Christian dagger for having me on varne
[137.16s] and co uh uh earlier this week and this
[142.879s] is a very very important segment with
[147.28s] Ash Webster who was in for Stuart vanney
[150.319s] on some of the historical data that
[152.56s] we&#39;re going to really drill down on
[154.72s] today so we&#39;re going to listen here for
[157.0s] these markets thas Hayes joins me now
[159.48s] and Thomas okay so we had a bit of a
[161.56s] selloff yesterday but do you have any
[163.2s] concerns about losing any momentum going
[166.0s] into
[168.08s] 2025 well Ash have no fear the
[171.28s] broadening rally will reappear I think
[174.599s] we saw a similar situation in 2016 right
[178.04s] after Donald Trump was elected the first
[180.0s] time you saw some volatility in November
[182.28s] December the dollar rallied yields
[184.319s] rallied but shortly right after the turn
[186.64s] of the calendar and after the
[188.519s] inauguration everything fell into place
[190.959s] and if you keep it in mind uh earnings
[193.2s] growth price is what you pay value is
[194.879s] what you get the Magnificent 7 while
[197.239s] they&#39;re going to grow earnings 21% next
[200.72s] year that is down from
[203.319s] 33% this year whereas if you look at
[205.959s] some of the broadening look at small
[207.799s] caps for instance they&#39;re also going to
[209.959s] grow earnings 21% except that is up from
[214.28s] 8% this year so uh one you&#39;re paying 33
[217.799s] times earnings one you&#39;re paying 15
[219.76s] times earnings price is what you pay
[221.4s] value is what you get so that broadening
[223.64s] rally that started in July we&#39;re going
[225.799s] to see a continuation of that in 2025
[229.28s] despite the abrupt interruption in
[232.599s] December uh expect that Trend to to
[235.2s] resume after the calendar turns Ash yeah
[238.319s] the the Santa rally has been a big belly
[241.04s] flop has it not I&#39;ve got one minute left
[243.0s] Thomas a record $1 trillion was invested
[246.599s] into ETFs this year do you expect that
[248.68s] Trend to
[250.239s] continue well the last peak of passive
[253.599s] ETFs uh inflows was 2021 which implies
[258.04s] it often happens at the exact wrong time
[262.16s] I think what you&#39;re going to see is the
[263.759s] weights that make up those passive
[265.32s] indices are going to underperform the
[268.0s] mag 7 uh versus verus the rest of the
[270.56s] market broadening start to outperform as
[273.52s] a matter of fact value has outperformed
[277.08s] growth by
[279.28s] 4.4% per year since 1927 the only
[283.759s] exception which is why we&#39;re stuck with
[285.52s] recency bias The Only Exception was the
[288.4s] zero interest rate policy decade since
[291.759s] 2010 so unless you believe we&#39;re going
[294.28s] back to zero interest rate policy you
[296.479s] want to add some cheaper value into your
[298.759s] portfolio as the turns
[301.32s] Ash terrific advice we&#39;ll have to leave
[303.919s] it there but Thomas thank you so much
[305.639s] for joining us today thanks for having
[309.639s] me and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I
[313.88s] had the pleasure to join Brad Smith and
[316.56s] Brian sazy on Yahoo finance going into
[321.0s] the last shall be first theme for 2025
[325.039s] want to thank Justin Oliver and Kayla
[327.72s] Hawkins for having me on uh we&#39;re going
[330.319s] to listen in here the healthc care and
[332.44s] material sectors are two of the worst
[334.96s] performing sectors on the S&amp;P 500 in
[337.12s] 2024 our next guest says now though is
[340.479s] the perfect time to take a look at what
[342.36s] to expect from them in 2025 Thomas Hayes
[345.68s] great Hill Capital chairman and managing
[347.759s] member joins us now happy holidays to
[349.919s] you thanks so much for hopping on Yahoo
[351.479s] finance with us so you&#39;re banking on a
[353.88s] bounce back here potentially with these
[355.36s] two sectors why is that yeah Brad thank
[358.12s] you for having me I I think the theme
[360.36s] for 2025 is going to be the last shall
[363.039s] be first if you look at Healthcare it&#39;s
[365.479s] up basically 3 4% year to date relative
[368.84s] to the S&amp;P some
[371.039s] 25% uh but and with materials up
[374.919s] 1.8% year to dat very anemic returns but
[379.24s] when the calendar turns something is
[381.039s] going to change and that&#39;s called
[382.639s] earnings growth as a matter of fact
[384.88s] Healthcare and materials are in the top
[387.639s] four earnings growth expected for 2025
[390.52s] Healthcare is expected to grow earnings
[393.919s] 20.6% materials is going to grow
[396.16s] earnings
[397.28s] 17.4% which exceeds the S&amp;P 500 at
[401.639s] 14% And you know Brad if if we look at
[404.68s] healthc care there&#39;s some some strange
[406.639s] things happening uh but kind of
[409.759s] predictable we saw a similar situation
[412.36s] in
[413.319s] 2016 right after Donald Trump was
[416.039s] elected Healthcare and biotech sold off
[419.8s] if you remember he was going to tear up
[422.039s] the Affordable Care Act and the market
[423.96s] got nervous shortly after the
[426.199s] inauguration healthare rallied biotech
[428.879s] rallied as a matter of fact Healthcare
[430.44s] was up around 40% in 2017 biotech around
[435.84s] 75% after selling off after the election
[439.36s] uh and then rallying after the
[440.68s] inauguration I think now it&#39;s not the
[442.72s] Affordable Care Act it&#39;s RFK Jr&#39;s got
[445.96s] people a little bit on edge and I think
[448.599s] it&#39;s a a case of sell the rumor by the
[451.28s] news it won&#39;t be quite as bad as people
[453.72s] are expecting on the healthcare front
[456.599s] what about the materials uh Thomas good
[458.639s] to good to see you as always aren&#39;t tows
[460.919s] going to be bad for this
[462.759s] sector yeah I I think it&#39;s it&#39;s more
[466.36s] than advertised I think this is a
[468.28s] negotiating tactic uh if you look at
[471.24s] materials it has the lowest relative
[475.0s] performance to the S&amp;P 500 since 2020
[478.639s] and then going all all the way back to
[480.96s] 2001 these were both generational buy
[484.52s] opportunities in the material sector and
[487.52s] speaking of which Brian uh the material
[490.319s] sector if you look at xlb did the exact
[492.68s] same thing in 2016 remember he ran as
[495.919s] the Tariff King they sold off after the
[499.08s] election they rallied in
[501.36s] 2017 after the inauguration so we expect
[505.479s] more of the same thing uh as it relates
[508.199s] to uh just some of the technical stuff
[511.159s] on this you know materials only
[514.599s] 7% of the components are trading above
[517.479s] their 50-day exponential moving average
[519.839s] now I&#39;m not a big Tech technician by any
[522.519s] stretch of the imagination but that
[523.88s] tells you the sector is completely
[526.44s] washed out and there&#39;s one player that
[529.0s] we particularly like called albamar uh
[532.16s] it&#39;s one of the largest lithium
[534.2s] producers and if you know anything about
[535.88s] lithium it&#39;s very cyclical right now
[539.04s] it&#39;s at uh very low prices on the fears
[542.48s] of a supply glut we do expect this uh
[546.64s] imbalance to be rectified by the end of
[549.88s] 2025 albam Maro is one of the biggest
[552.399s] players they&#39;ve got $3.4 billion dollars
[555.2s] of liquidity to wait it out while the
[557.32s] smaller players will be crushed so uh we
[559.92s] do think albam Maro is going to be a
[561.2s] great play it&#39;s also down on the fear of
[564.0s] softer maybe potential or perceived
[566.44s] softer demand for EVS in the developed
[568.88s] world yeah like United States like
[572.0s] Europe however the EV game is all about
[574.48s] China and that&#39;s an unnatural government
[577.519s] subsidized market and that&#39;s expected to
[579.48s] grow from 40 million stock globally 41
[582.72s] million stock of EVS globally right now
[585.0s] to 132 Million by 2027 largely driven by
[589.959s] China and the government subsidies to
[591.64s] push that so that&#39;s going to help albam
[593.12s] Maro and even prior to that you saw
[595.959s] albam Maro could perform through all
[598.16s] kinds of lithium prices high prices low
[600.36s] prices Etc and this time will be no
[602.48s] different Tom I got a Huston bar finish
[604.399s] here but just lastly according to an SEC
[606.92s] filing Warren Buffett&#39;s Berkshire bought
[609.48s] $28.5 million in Varys sign stock an
[613.56s] internet registry company that&#39;s been
[615.16s] around since the do boom you know
[617.519s] Buffett&#39;s moves lately he he&#39;s sitting
[619.16s] on a lot of dry powder what do you make
[620.76s] of that and how could it be deployed
[622.76s] potentially where are the top areas he
[624.56s] could deploy that in 2025 so ver sign is
[627.68s] certainly a headline it&#39;s 91 basis
[630.56s] points of the entire portfolio so you
[633.079s] could see a lot of these moves are being
[634.56s] made by the lieutenants Todd and Ted
[636.76s] Buffett&#39;s got you know some 325 350
[640.279s] billion dollars of cash I think right
[642.24s] now it&#39;s about preserving his his legacy
[644.68s] going out like Seinfeld uh at the top of
[647.44s] his game versus eeking out a few extra
[649.56s] percentage points of returns uh he&#39;s got
[652.8s] the greatest investor investor of all
[654.72s] time in my view I think he&#39;s been
[656.72s] cautious I think there&#39;s a buffet
[658.76s] premium on the basis of sometime after
[661.48s] he passes perhaps the sum of the parts
[664.0s] is greater than the whole but Buffett
[665.56s] never wanted the company broken up so
[667.44s] that&#39;s going to take many years if ever
[670.12s] to break up you&#39;re going to have to roll
[671.68s] off a lot of the current board members
[673.76s] before you see that type of makeup or
[675.56s] before you see a material dividend which
[677.76s] is something else people would talk
[679.079s] about so I think right now it&#39;s
[680.88s] preservation it&#39;s a Victory lap and um
[685.0s] uh it&#39;s it&#39;s going to effectively it&#39;s
[686.519s] the law of large numbers it&#39;s going to
[688.2s] effectively trade like S&amp;P index uh
[691.16s] prospectively unless they can really
[693.279s] hunt down an elephant before his passing
[695.92s] and buy a very large high growth
[698.32s] business at a reasonable price uh which
[700.639s] is not looking like a high probability
[702.56s] event in the coming years Thomas a
[704.8s] always appreciate the insights happy
[706.16s] holidays talk to you soon thank you
[707.959s] thanks for having me Brian and Brad all
[709.68s] right all your
[710.68s] mark and we&#39;re back and then finally
[714.0s] want to thank again Christian dagger and
[717.2s] Preston misel for having me on V and Co
[720.44s] on Thursday to discuss two beaten down
[723.959s] sectors where we see tremendous
[725.399s] opportunity for
[727.279s] 20125 again thanks to Ash Webster as
[729.92s] well we&#39;ll tune in here let&#39;s get back
[731.76s] to the markets bring in Thomas Hayes who
[734.079s] joins me now and the market slightly
[736.199s] lower but trying to get back into
[738.16s] positive territory uh Thomas you like
[741.079s] healthc care and materials uh let&#39;s
[743.48s] begin with xbi it&#39;s a biotech ETF why do
[747.639s] you like it
[749.92s] well Ash I think the theme for 2025 is
[752.639s] going to be the last shall be first and
[755.72s] materials has only performed
[758.279s] 1.8% up year-to date just 1.8% relative
[761.72s] to the S&amp;P up some
[763.56s] 25% and the expected earnings growth for
[767.079s] materials for 2025 is
[770.92s] 17.4% that exceeds the S&amp;P 14% so I
[774.68s] think there&#39;s going to be a reversal
[775.88s] here I think there&#39;s going to be an
[776.959s] opportunity and we saw a very similar
[779.68s] thing in
[780.88s] 2016 right after Donald Trump was
[783.279s] elected materials sold off right after
[786.24s] he was inaugurated materials rallied for
[789.6s] 2017 and the way we want to express that
[791.839s] Ash is with a company called albam Maro
[794.959s] and albam Maro is one of the leading
[797.399s] lithium providers and it&#39;s really sold
[799.6s] off it&#39;s down 72% from its covid highs
[803.56s] and it&#39;s sold off on the on the basis of
[805.519s] a lithium short-term lithium glut which
[808.16s] is a very sick cyclical and the
[810.199s] perception that EV demand is going down
[812.88s] which it&#39;s softened in North America and
[814.839s] Europe but China is driving the bus on
[817.72s] EV demand because it&#39;s an unnatural
[820.24s] government subsidized market and the
[822.639s] stock of Eves is expected to grow from
[824.68s] 41 million now to 132 Million by 2027 so
[829.959s] they&#39;ll just cut cost they&#39;ll ride out
[831.519s] the short-term glut and as one of the
[833.519s] biggest players with 3.4 billion of
[835.56s] liquidity they&#39;ll be just
[837.36s] fine and Thomas quickly it appears
[840.519s] you&#39;re pretty bullish on the new
[842.88s] year I am bullish on the new year the
[845.24s] second group we like is healthc care
[846.92s] which is only up
[848.399s] 3.7% year-to date they&#39;re going to grow
[850.88s] earnings 20% and the way we&#39;re
[853.04s] expressing that is through biotech xbi
[856.44s] uh this is all about deals and drugs a
[858.56s] deregulatory environment with the new
[860.92s] Administration the FDA will approve more
[863.88s] drugs the FTC will approve more deals
[867.12s] and Pharma needs that innovation with
[869.32s] record cash on the balance sheet they&#39;re
[871.079s] going to have to buy that Innovation
[872.759s] from biotech at near low historic low
[876.44s] valuations so there&#39;s going to be great
[878.16s] opportunities in biotech and
[880.639s] Healthcare I feel uh I feel the
[883.88s] bullishness in the air Thomas thank you
[885.88s] so much for joining us really good
[887.839s] information Thomas Hayes on some of the
[890.199s] areas you may want to consider in the
[891.68s] new year uh talking at the market let&#39;s
[893.68s] take a look at and we&#39;re back so that&#39;s
[896.6s] the 30,000 foot view to kind of get
[899.56s] things started here I like to go through
[901.759s] some of the extremes uh so we can get a
[904.72s] sense of where we are you have two
[908.16s] schools here I think a lot of people
[910.12s] getting cautious uh rightfully so but
[914.44s] we&#39;re going to see as we drill through
[916.279s] this stuff that they may be justified in
[920.399s] getting cautious with the index and
[922.839s] indices and unjustified getting overly
[926.279s] cautious on the things that are already
[927.839s] beat down with the tremendous
[930.12s] opportunity there so you see the nysse
[932.8s] you see uh NASDAQ 1% EMA Advanced
[936.36s] decline that could probably have a
[937.759s] little lower to go uh but a couple of my
[940.759s] favorites I wanted to cover
[943.6s] here um okay there&#39;s a NASDAQ high low
[947.399s] that&#39;s kind of
[948.88s] mid-range NASDAQ up down volume real
[951.839s] estate stocks kind of mid range okay
[954.36s] here&#39;s material stocks percentage above
[957.04s] the 20-day exponential moving average
[959.44s] down to zero that is a buy time that&#39;s
[962.319s] what you see when they&#39;re absolutely in
[963.959s] the gutter so we have our albam maros
[966.48s] and and so on we&#39;re going to talk a
[967.68s] little bit about that healthc care
[969.24s] stocks which we talked about with Ash
[971.24s] Webster again and with Brad Brad and
[974.199s] Brian uh they got down to 5% above their
[977.88s] 20 day exponential moving average these
[980.639s] are always dips to buy not to sell um
[985.199s] and you know nothing&#39;s foolproof but
[986.92s] we&#39;re in the probabilities business Dow
[989.519s] intermediate term breath momentum that&#39;s
[991.88s] getting stretched to the downside uh
[993.88s] time to take
[995.079s] opportunity um here&#39;s the S&amp;P 500 mlen
[1000.16s] summation index again towards areas
[1003.079s] where there&#39;s opportunity could go a
[1005.04s] little lower for sure pmo buy all down
[1007.68s] to zero uh that&#39;s a percentage of uh S&amp;P
[1013.88s] 500 on uh crossover buy signals it
[1016.839s] doesn&#39;t really matter what that is what
[1018.279s] what matters is where it&#39;s at and at
[1019.88s] zero the risk rewards are in your favor
[1022.639s] same with pmo by Dow Jones down to 15
[1027.039s] same with pmo by SPX down to 10 you know
[1031.48s] this is where you get these awesome
[1033.24s] opportunities to buy great businesses at
[1035.679s] a discount uh a bullish percent S&amp;P 500
[1040.039s] that&#39;s pretty extreme could potentially
[1042.52s] go a little lower first because of the
[1044.16s] weights of some of the tech stocks you
[1046.24s] saw Apple down pretty pretty
[1047.799s] meaningfully today Nazi NASDAQ mlen
[1050.84s] summation index kind of middle of the
[1052.559s] range so the NASDAQ ones uh probably
[1055.6s] could push further down whereas some of
[1058.24s] the Dow and nysse and value seem to be
[1061.36s] in a position where there&#39;s
[1064.84s] opportunity uh let&#39;s go into our charts
[1068.0s] here I&#39;m going to give us a little bit
[1070.08s] more size so everyone can see everything
[1072.799s] uh stocks have done quite well in the
[1074.44s] first year of a new term lately this is
[1077.2s] from Ryan Dietrich so you can see here
[1080.28s] the Biden term was up 26% the first year
[1084.4s] of his term Trump up 19% Obama up 29%
[1089.72s] Obama up
[1091.2s] 23% uh bush in 2001 was down 13 but
[1095.2s] pretty much everyone until you go all
[1097.76s] the way back into the 70s when Nixon
[1099.919s] Carter and the first term of Reagan were
[1102.88s] Troublesome but rates were also 18% in
[1105.52s] uh
[1106.48s] 81 uh and vula was uh tamping them down
[1110.2s] Ryan Dietrich S&amp;P 500 up about 20 8 okay
[1114.919s] we&#39;ve only had we only had an 88.5% Peak
[1118.12s] to trough pullback all year so you can
[1120.32s] see how that
[1121.679s] registers uh relative
[1124.44s] to all of the previous years the average
[1128.28s] correction average year sees a
[1131.28s] 14.2% correction which increases the
[1134.2s] odds it might be might happen next year
[1137.2s] um that is skewed by the years that you
[1139.48s] have 20 and 30 for sure but uh I
[1142.84s] definitely and I&#39;ve been saying we will
[1144.64s] probably get a 10% correction uh a 10 to
[1148.24s] 15% correction maybe one or two and
[1150.64s] that&#39;ll just be opportunities and you
[1152.28s] just ride them out but as far as is the
[1154.039s] bull market over and is is everything
[1155.84s] going to go to hell the answer is uh not
[1159.039s] yet and and and not not really anytime
[1162.28s] soon I do think we&#39;ll get some 20%
[1164.679s] pullback uh Corrections and 25%
[1167.08s] Corrections like 87 uh like Co Etc but I
[1170.6s] think this is going to run you&#39;ve got
[1172.679s] 12,000 people turning 35 years old every
[1176.039s] single day in the United States those
[1177.799s] demographics are going to shine for at
[1180.08s] least another five six seven eight years
[1183.679s] into the early 2030s where I start to
[1185.919s] get aggressively worried um but in the
[1189.039s] meantime it&#39;s buying things with a
[1190.559s] margin of safety so I don&#39;t have to
[1192.0s] worry about the shortterm pullbacks or
[1195.76s] rotations or anything else because I
[1197.6s] know what I own and when they turn it
[1200.28s] comes all at once so uh M2 money
[1203.24s] supplies turning up that works in our
[1205.36s] favor here&#39;s from Seth golden as a Perma
[1208.08s] bear you&#39;re truly awaiting one shiny
[1210.0s] moment average duration of a bar Market
[1211.88s] is 446 days average duration of a bull
[1214.88s] market is
[1215.96s] 269 days average bare Market is -35
[1219.88s] average bull market is plus
[1223.24s] 209% um if you choose bull you&#39;ll endure
[1226.0s] any bare Market that&#39;s for sure and what
[1228.88s] he&#39;s showing here is that
[1232.72s] um
[1234.64s] uh you know basically also the other
[1238.159s] thing to keep in mind is this bull
[1240.88s] market is relatively new in the scheme
[1245.32s] of uh we had the 25% correction in 2022
[1250.039s] which was a recession too everyone
[1251.44s] waiting for a recession we just had two
[1253.36s] in four years you usually have one in
[1255.08s] four years so we pulled forward a
[1256.559s] recession uh very hard to have a
[1258.28s] recession with 2 and A2 to 3% GDP growth
[1260.88s] so that&#39;s off the table which which in
[1263.24s] theory uh pretty much takes a 25%
[1266.559s] correction off the table as well even
[1268.679s] usually a 20% correction unless you have
[1270.72s] just some short-term dislocation for a
[1272.48s] week or something like that um so with
[1275.279s] the average duration of a bull market is
[1277.919s] 269 days and we&#39;ve been going since uh
[1281.559s] the fall of
[1283.44s] 2022 when we were pounding the
[1286.24s] table uh you know you&#39;re basically 700
[1289.279s] days in so you&#39;re less than half of the
[1291.52s] way there and I think that&#39;s a
[1293.039s] reasonable way to look at it Santa rally
[1295.44s] since 2000 we we will see I think
[1298.72s] tomorrow comes into play last year we
[1301.08s] did not have the Santa rally and we had
[1302.96s] a great year so all that January effect
[1305.24s] and predicting the future is kind of not
[1308.52s] terribly
[1309.6s] useful
[1311.279s] um here is Japanese bond yields and I
[1316.919s] emphasized uh aggressive mely in last
[1319.52s] week&#39;s podcast that the number one thing
[1321.76s] you need to watch as it relates to the
[1323.36s] Magnificent 7 is not whether the FTC is
[1326.559s] coming for them it&#39;s whether the bank of
[1328.679s] Japan is unwinding the carry trade
[1331.559s] knowingly or unknowingly
[1334.44s] by um raising rates to quell Rising
[1339.679s] inflation and you started to see these
[1343.159s] uh rickety uh wobbliness in mag 7 and in
[1348.6s] the last handful of sessions and what
[1351.799s] that&#39;s been coincident with uh and I
[1355.84s] would say causal to uh you know
[1358.919s] everyone&#39;s here saying oh it&#39;s pension
[1360.52s] rebalancing and all that and yes there
[1362.12s] is some of that but watch the jgb yields
[1366.24s] because as that Japanese money gets more
[1369.279s] expensive the carry trade becomes less
[1371.12s] profitable all that free money has been
[1373.84s] parked in mag 7 they were getting the
[1376.48s] benefits of currency depre apption of
[1379.0s] the Yen uh appreciation of the dollar
[1382.039s] and stability of Mag 7 as rates go up
[1385.08s] that trade becomes less attractive and
[1386.679s] the money gets out hot money like
[1388.88s] nobody&#39;s business uh so that is the
[1391.52s] number one chart you should be looking
[1393.0s] at every single day when you wake up is
[1396.0s] the jgb yields as yields go up the odds
[1399.52s] of Mag 7 holding on to the waiting they
[1402.84s] have and the flows they have uh get cut
[1406.88s] in half very very quickly 21 uh us
[1409.96s] pensions to sell $21 billion of equities
[1412.48s] okay so that&#39;s the the US Centric view
[1415.36s] of uh any wobbliness S&amp;P performance
[1418.52s] after gaining more than 35% in the last
[1421.0s] 12 months from October so you look one
[1423.279s] month out you have some negative returns
[1425.64s] 3 months out you&#39;re up 3% 6 months out
[1429.24s] you&#39;re up 3% and 12 months out you&#39;re up
[1432.64s] 13.8% I think that&#39;s a reasonable
[1435.08s] expectation for the indices this year uh
[1439.24s] given expected underperformance of Mag 7
[1442.799s] uh between 8 and 133% and under the
[1445.32s] surface making money all day long Seth
[1447.72s] golden no no way to Sugar Cod it first
[1450.12s] year of Republican Le Administration is
[1452.0s] on average not good for equities
[1453.48s] extremely Stark difference from Democrat
[1455.559s] uh Trump 1.0 bucked the trend in 2017
[1458.559s] can it happen again with tax act 2.0
[1460.72s] we&#39;re going to find out really soon I
[1462.52s] think on balance they&#39;re going to give
[1464.44s] him the benefit of the doubt again and
[1466.0s] it&#39;s going to be an okay year for sure
[1468.039s] maybe not for mag 7 as mag 7 did less
[1471.679s] well under Trump
[1473.399s] 1.0 uh on balance but still did fine
[1476.44s] small cap and large cap earnings
[1477.919s] estimates into next year now this is the
[1480.44s] Russell 2000 if you look at
[1484.159s] small uh S&amp;P 600 it&#39;s a little different
[1487.679s] but for Russell 2000 this is from fact
[1490.039s] set they&#39;re showing 57% earnings growth
[1493.0s] for the Russell 2000 small caps versus
[1496.36s] the S&amp;P 500 of 14 to 15 % that&#39;s as of
[1500.399s] December 10th if you look at the small
[1502.96s] cap 6 S&amp;P 600 it&#39;s more like 21% but the
[1507.12s] fact of the matter is you pay less you
[1509.44s] get more more earnings growth for lower
[1511.72s] multiple and that&#39;s why that rotation to
[1514.36s] have no fear the broadening rally will
[1516.64s] reappear uh we feel very confident in
[1519.2s] that Viewpoint halfway through the
[1521.159s] rolling roiling 20s uh S&amp;P performance
[1525.039s] since the start of the decade
[1528.96s] uh and I think that&#39;s that gives us
[1530.84s] another five years of Runway there CFO
[1533.64s] optimism is rising that is a
[1538.559s] um that that historically has a
[1542.32s] forward-looking ability forcasting
[1544.679s] ability as that consumer conf as that
[1547.64s] CFO optimism Rises off despondent lows
[1551.0s] like we saw in the 2022 and 2020
[1554.559s] recessions uh equities tend to follow
[1557.279s] and I think this time will be no
[1559.44s] different uh dollar Index after Trump
[1562.919s] election we have emphasized this over
[1565.2s] and over as everyone&#39;s panicked about
[1567.12s] the 10year Y yield and the dollar
[1569.32s] destroying everything and all the plans
[1571.96s] with emerging markets and everything
[1573.52s] else uh we said now that Trump has
[1576.6s] elected expect this the same thing
[1578.44s] happened in 2016 for you know month and
[1581.52s] a half after he was uh elected through
[1584.159s] to inauguration the dollar went up
[1586.76s] yields went up after the inauguration
[1589.039s] after the turn of the calendar they all
[1590.6s] collapsed dollar dollar rolled
[1593.159s] completely over just like you see in
[1595.0s] this chart same thing with the 10-year
[1597.039s] yield Emerging Markets rallied biotech
[1599.84s] rallied the whole story so we&#39;re pretty
[1602.44s] excited about that and one of the
[1604.919s] reasons that we are super enthusiastic
[1607.6s] about
[1608.64s] 2025 got delayed a couple of months with
[1611.2s] the election result we had no way to
[1614.0s] predict the election winner uh uh nor
[1617.08s] were we trying and uh we wouldn&#39;t have
[1619.96s] changed a thing even if we knew the
[1621.6s] outcome because one it creates uh
[1624.76s] unnecessary tax events
[1626.559s] two
[1628.6s] um you can look at an analog to get a
[1632.2s] sense of what might happen but to gamble
[1635.0s] on it exactly repeating is a Fool&#39;s
[1638.0s] errand that what we have is a beautiful
[1640.72s] portfolio of amazing businesses that we
[1642.76s] know everything about uh in concentrated
[1645.76s] form we have a huge margin of safe
[1648.72s] we&#39;ve got turnaround catalysts with CEOs
[1651.32s] and and durable businesses and plans
[1653.399s] forward we&#39;ve got solvency risk removed
[1656.159s] from from pretty much all of them uh if
[1658.679s] not all of them and uh and and the
[1661.159s] turnaround in place from the dto to the
[1663.24s] restock cycle so we couldn&#39;t be more
[1664.919s] excited we just had to eat six weeks of
[1667.48s] volatility uh after the election and now
[1669.76s] we&#39;re going to get the benefit of the
[1671.76s] rewards holding tight and using those
[1674.32s] opportunities to uh be topping up
[1677.24s] everywhere we Poss possibly could uh
[1679.72s] it&#39;s been a very busy holiday season and
[1682.799s] super excited some of the folks that
[1684.36s] came in last uh week after the podcast
[1688.0s] called they already got approved we put
[1690.08s] a lot of money to work today we&#39;re going
[1692.08s] to put a lot of money to work in the
[1693.519s] next few days as more of those
[1695.2s] applications are approved at at
[1697.039s] interactive brokers and uh and and uh
[1700.84s] all the client existing clients new
[1702.799s] clients are going to be beautifully set
[1704.44s] up early right before the inauguration
[1707.159s] for all these great things things to
[1709.72s] unfold um and then we&#39;ll close out
[1712.679s] sometime well before the inauguration in
[1714.559s] the next week or two uh so here we go PE
[1721.72s] ratios uh percent okay
[1724.96s] cortile so this is from hbert ratings
[1728.0s] Mark hbert he he writes with data with a
[1732.88s] pretty much chronically bearish tilt
[1736.36s] historically uh which is good you want
[1738.279s] to have the counterbalance of the data
[1739.519s] so he&#39;ll just find data to support a
[1741.36s] bearish view pretty consistently over
[1743.76s] the decades and he&#39;s a well-respected
[1745.44s] journalist uh in the industry so here
[1747.919s] what he&#39;s saying is uh you know we&#39;re
[1752.48s] in the top 92nd percentile in terms of
[1757.159s] PE ratio 96 percentile in terms of Cape
[1761.279s] 98th and dividend yield 100th uh in
[1764.519s] price to sales 100th in Price to Book so
[1768.159s] so what he&#39;s basically saying is based
[1769.64s] on these valuations we are going to
[1772.559s] correct and we&#39;re going to die he&#39;s had
[1774.64s] the similar uh data in each of the last
[1777.399s] three years as well maybe this year
[1778.84s] he&#39;ll be right but I think he&#39;ll be
[1781.159s] right in
[1782.399s] a concentrated portion of the market um
[1786.88s] in the areas that we&#39;re trafficking you
[1789.679s] know they&#39;ve really taken out uh you
[1793.2s] know at some point it you know it&#39;s so
[1796.279s] cheap to own such a high quality
[1798.64s] portfolio of assets some point they&#39;re
[1800.559s] almost paying you to take them it&#39;s it&#39;s
[1802.399s] it&#39;s mindboggling it really is exciting
[1804.72s] what what this once in a 100y year event
[1807.24s] with covid created in terms of
[1809.279s] generational opportunities to buy
[1811.279s] unbelievable businesses marked down on
[1813.679s] sale and you know I you know I I I
[1819.0s] talked to some of you and they&#39;re like
[1820.0s] wow I love your I love your optimism
[1822.0s] it&#39;s not optimism you you will find
[1824.32s] periods in in uh in future years where I
[1827.48s] will be I will sound like uh David
[1829.36s] Rosenberg and Mark Wilson&#39;s cubed uh
[1832.12s] I&#39;ll be the most negative person on the
[1833.519s] street it&#39;s just not the right time that
[1835.96s] that&#39;s the bottom line and um uh when
[1839.799s] that time occurs we we will be there I I
[1842.64s] am agnostic to being bullish or bears
[1844.559s] obviously you&#39;re going to be bullish
[1845.679s] you&#39;re going to make a lot more money
[1846.6s] over time being bullish I&#39;ve I&#39;ve only
[1849.0s] met I used to say I never met a wealthy
[1852.559s] an extremely wealthy uh Perma Perma
[1855.679s] pessimist uh I do know one
[1858.559s] uh but he&#39;s made most of his
[1860.96s] money you know selling pessimism versus
[1864.24s] uh versus uh El other otherwise but uh
[1867.76s] you know he&#39;s built a great business
[1868.919s] doing that but that&#39;s the exception not
[1870.279s] the rule on balance you want to be an
[1872.159s] optimist you want to see opportun you
[1873.799s] know pessimists look for the difficulty
[1875.32s] in the opportunity OPP uh optimists look
[1878.32s] for opportunity and the difficulty and
[1879.96s] that&#39;s where all the money is so uh not
[1882.519s] only um do value and growth rotate over
[1886.96s] the years but International versus us
[1890.12s] this is from RIT Holtz
[1892.88s] um uh this shows the
[1896.159s] rotation from International Equity
[1899.039s] outperformance to us equity
[1900.88s] outperformance and as you can see in the
[1903.88s] zero interest rate policy that began in
[1907.08s] 2010 what happened from 2010 until zerp
[1910.919s] ended in
[1912.799s] 2022 us dramatically outperformed
[1916.399s] International by an order by a level of
[1920.639s] um outperformance that we haven&#39;t seen
[1923.32s] since 1995 to
[1925.76s] 1999 and then prior to that 89 to 93 and
[1929.799s] then prior to that 79 to 83 but if you
[1934.279s] look at these Cycles they usually only
[1936.799s] last four years four years four
[1941.36s] years 5 years here we had this extended
[1945.559s] cycle of 10 years because of the
[1948.639s] aberrational zero interest rate policy
[1951.0s] that favors um favored US Stocks among
[1954.96s] other things and if you believe that we
[1959.6s] are going back to zero interest rate
[1962.559s] policy then you should continue to bet
[1965.919s] exclusively on the US but if you believe
[1968.399s] that this is a normal cycle and that
[1970.84s] International could start to outperform
[1972.96s] like we&#39;ve seen early signs of uh the
[1976.519s] last two years just like we saw early
[1978.399s] signs of in 2021 2022 uh 2001 and 2002
[1983.36s] before you had dramatic outperformance
[1985.399s] from 2003 to 2007 dramatic
[1988.2s] outperformance from 92 to 95 dramatic
[1991.399s] outperformance of international from
[1993.399s] 1983 Reagan 1.0 to
[1997.639s] 1989 dramatic outperformance from 1976
[2001.2s] to 1979 dramatic outperformance of
[2003.96s] international from 1970 to 1973 so every
[2007.799s] 4 years so maybe you could see a
[2010.639s] situation where if I&#39;m right about the
[2013.039s] terminal rate and we don&#39;t go any lower
[2015.36s] than 3.5 I think we&#39;re going to be
[2017.88s] terminal rate is going to be somewhere
[2018.96s] between 3.5 and four even if we went to
[2021.88s] three but we don&#39;t go anywhere near zero
[2024.76s] uh that we could see the next four years
[2026.679s] cycle like early Reagan where
[2029.039s] International like early Bush where
[2031.76s] International dramatically outperformed
[2034.76s] the us and what does that mean it means
[2036.72s] the top 10 stocks that make up 40% of
[2038.72s] the index uh start to materially
[2042.039s] underperform and I think that is coming
[2045.039s] uh a historic boom in Immigration
[2047.24s] average annual change in forign Born
[2048.76s] population is a share of the total US
[2050.399s] population so we added 2 million in the
[2052.119s] last three years that is the highest
[2054.079s] since the
[2055.919s] 1850s um so that&#39;s that at least we&#39;re
[2058.96s] still getting population growth uh we
[2061.28s] can debate what type of population
[2063.56s] growth is best but we can&#39;t debate that
[2065.8s] we need population growth so so uh I&#39;ll
[2068.48s] leave it at that um putting 2024 in
[2071.48s] perspective so again the average
[2073.839s] pullback around 14% been anemic we did
[2077.159s] have a big one in uh
[2080.04s] 2022 we had a big one in 2020 a big one
[2083.52s] in
[2084.359s] 2018 so you see all this stuff but
[2087.0s] actually in uh
[2089.879s] 2016
[2091.76s] 2017
[2094.0s] 2019 so um so that&#39;s that month L return
[2098.28s] stats for the S&amp;P 500 since
[2101.52s] 1964 January is a good month um it is
[2107.119s] positive 58% of the time with the
[2108.92s] average return of
[2111.839s] 1.1% what are the worst ones I think
[2114.119s] everyone kind of knows uh September&#39;s
[2117.56s] the worst month February&#39;s February&#39;s uh
[2120.32s] one of the worst months August so
[2125.04s] so on balance you get
[2128.359s] cautious if things are really hot into
[2132.119s] August September on balance you get
[2135.24s] cautious if things are really hot
[2137.4s] through January February tends to be a
[2139.839s] little bit of Rocky before picking up in
[2141.56s] March and April before the sell and man
[2143.76s] go away and then things turn up after
[2145.92s] September uh mid October uh but January
[2149.68s] on balance tends to be
[2152.56s] a small cap fundamental Tailwind again
[2155.56s] this is just reemphasizing the earnings
[2157.44s] grow growth that we&#39;ve talked about
[2159.4s] small caps in blue
[2162.16s] relative uh big earnings growth I guess
[2165.04s] this is the russle again talking about
[2166.8s] 40 42% earnings growth 30% earnings
[2169.88s] growth 53% earnings growth 60% earnings
[2172.839s] growth 49 quarter by quarter that&#39;s the
[2175.56s] Russell 2000 that&#39;s a little skewed by
[2178.079s] the percentage of companies that are not
[2180.079s] earning that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been going by
[2181.64s] the small cap 600 which has a higher
[2183.64s] percentage of earning companies which is
[2185.52s] 21% earnings growth but at the end of
[2187.319s] the day you&#39;re still paying 156 times
[2189.68s] versus 23 22 23 times for 14% growth for
[2193.839s] the regular indices net integration is
[2195.96s] already
[2197.0s] fallen uh solid real income growth
[2199.56s] should remain a key pillar of consumer
[2201.64s] spending growth uh that&#39;s from Goldman
[2204.92s] Sachs we expect GDP growth of
[2208.0s] 2.4% in
[2210.359s] 2025 vers uh to beat the consensus
[2213.319s] forecast of 2.0 supported by solid
[2216.119s] private domestic demand growth
[2218.119s] that&#39;s from uh Goldman Sachs here&#39;s the
[2221.079s] seasonality uh since the last 20 years
[2225.64s] December you tend to get a little bit of
[2228.52s] rockiness at the end a little bump up
[2231.2s] early January mid January
[2234.48s] week uh let&#39;s see here and then strong
[2237.88s] into the end of January weak in February
[2240.4s] as we discussed straight up into May a
[2243.76s] little rockiness strong into July weak
[2246.68s] in August September member and then
[2248.119s] straight up so it&#39;s just good to have
[2249.839s] these road maps it doesn&#39;t mean they
[2252.319s] repeat but there&#39;s a tendency to rhyme
[2255.0s] and if you know the lay of the land it
[2256.8s] puts you ahead of the pack record
[2259.48s] dividend outflows to add pressures to
[2262.24s] currency this is dividends paid by Hong
[2265.68s] Kong listed Chinese firms we&#39;ll talk
[2268.04s] about that um I think the big story is
[2271.839s] there is the Chinese are doing the exact
[2274.079s] same thing they did in 2016 which is
[2276.76s] devalue currency ahead of the trade War
[2279.52s] so it&#39;s a Net Zero Effect to them
[2283.319s] because they manipulated their currency
[2285.2s] downward so if he adds tariffs um
[2288.599s] because of their weakened currency it
[2290.88s] will have no inflationary effect
[2292.56s] therefore it won&#39;t affect the volume for
[2295.079s] them and uh and they win um and it hurts
[2299.68s] the us because the dollar is stronger
[2301.48s] and makes us makes it harder for us to
[2303.319s] export things globally so um so that&#39;s
[2307.04s] that&#39;s what&#39;s going on there and then
[2308.64s] after the sell the rumors there buy the
[2311.4s] news when it&#39;s less bad than and than
[2314.04s] advertised then they can normalize the
[2316.16s] currency and um and everything Rock and
[2318.599s] rolls and you see years you see Baba
[2322.319s] that time 2016 we&#39;ll just show you again
[2326.24s] for the newer
[2328.64s] listeners
[2330.16s] um after it sold off following the
[2334.4s] election you had a basic
[2338.44s] doubling in the
[2342.04s] next
[2344.04s] year let&#39;s get that back
[2348.72s] up and get that back up there we go I&#39;m
[2352.599s] back just got to move that around so I
[2355.359s] can get this and show you guys a preview
[2360.88s] of coming attractions
[2370.68s] so here was Baba big selloff after the
[2374.119s] election dropped
[2375.64s] from uh looks like about 100 down to
[2380.839s] 84 not dissimilar from what we just saw
[2384.2s] and then after the turn of the calendar
[2385.92s] and certainly after the inauguration you
[2387.72s] saw big strength went from $84 a share
[2390.76s] to
[2392.04s] $187 a share uh in 11 months doesn&#39;t
[2396.28s] mean it&#39;s going to repeat
[2398.04s] but I would anticipate it&#39;s going to
[2399.92s] somewhat rhyme babo is up 10% for the
[2402.72s] year this year uh moving in the right
[2405.2s] direction but it&#39;s time to get paid uh
[2408.16s] it&#39;s time for clients to get a huge
[2410.64s] payday and uh existing clients new
[2414.2s] clients and get you know Monster IR
[2417.599s] inside of 12 months and um and that&#39;s
[2420.319s] how it works I mean for the strategy for
[2422.72s] a mean reversion strategy you just you
[2426.079s] wait and you wait and then you get you
[2428.48s] know just monstrous amounts of stuff all
[2432.24s] at once uh and and then you know you uh
[2436.68s] you do this exact same thing you
[2438.359s] reinvest you wait and then you get
[2440.8s] another monstrous amount and I&#39;ve been
[2443.079s] doing this for a long long time and when
[2445.04s] you have a a a portfolio that has zero
[2448.4s] correlation to the general indices
[2450.04s] unlike many active managers that are
[2452.2s] just closet indexers collecting fees
[2454.52s] whether it goes up or down but actually
[2456.8s] doing work and buying great businesses
[2459.52s] that you would want to own the whole
[2460.8s] thing and then you wait for the market
[2462.44s] to realize what you see uh it&#39;s just
[2465.4s] it&#39;s like Christmas for you know those
[2467.4s] periods you make you make a DEC you can
[2469.8s] make literally a decade&#39;s worth of money
[2472.16s] in in one year when you get these things
[2474.56s] uh all coming together at once so this
[2476.76s] this is what we saw in Trump and and uh
[2479.64s] here was kweb same story
[2482.48s] doubled um equal weight did well
[2488.079s] just all this stuff all this nonsense
[2491.24s] after the election solar solar stocks
[2494.0s] almost doubled after a disaster uh
[2497.4s] selloff before the
[2499.599s] inauguration uh biotech same story and
[2502.48s] then off to the races the only thing
[2505.0s] that did really terribly was uh energy
[2507.72s] stocks but I&#39;m not sure that will be the
[2509.68s] case I think some of the servicers can
[2511.119s] do okay materials same story so look
[2514.68s] we&#39;ve gone through this I I just wanted
[2516.359s] to reemphasize that for new people and
[2519.44s] understand I&#39;m enthusiastic for a reason
[2521.52s] not to be enthusiastic I can be more
[2524.04s] pessimistic than anyone in the room when
[2525.64s] it&#39;s time to be more pessimistic than
[2527.52s] anyone in the room I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
[2529.319s] time if I was fully concentrated in mag
[2531.88s] 7 I&#39;d be a little bit nervous I got to
[2533.56s] be honest with you I&#39;d be very nervous
[2535.8s] uh not because I think they&#39;re going to
[2537.599s] crash not because I don&#39;t think the
[2538.92s] businesses are awesome not because I
[2540.44s] don&#39;t believe in AI I do I use it uh but
[2545.92s] um uh
[2548.76s] the the future that the market prices
[2552.24s] instantaneously often takes a lot longer
[2555.28s] to play out than anticipated so the
[2557.839s] markets tend to think it&#39;s going to be 3
[2559.319s] to five years the reality is it&#39;s
[2561.359s] usually 15 to 20 but the Market&#39;s right
[2565.28s] um except that the bag holders that buy
[2568.72s] the three to 5e story wind up with the
[2570.8s] 80% draw Downs uh and uh even though
[2574.24s] they got the long-term thesis one 100%
[2578.599s] correct they paid for the long-term
[2582.4s] thesis being fulfilled in the present
[2585.319s] and it was going to take 20 years to
[2586.92s] happen and they thought it was going to
[2588.079s] take three years so that&#39;s all I&#39;m
[2589.96s] saying Bull and bare markets this shows
[2594.04s] msci
[2596.68s] World
[2598.8s] um this this is just a different way of
[2601.52s] showing the underperformance versus the
[2603.359s] outperformance by JP Morgan
[2605.24s] International is due value is due Etc
[2607.72s] Regional earnings expectations you can
[2609.88s] see uh China for next year is going to
[2612.64s] grow about double digits it&#39;s trading at
[2615.28s] single digits uh emerging markets at you
[2618.88s] know 13 14% us at 13 14% the differen is
[2623.44s] for us you pay 23 24 times for us for
[2628.599s] emerging markets in certainly for China
[2630.96s] you pay high single digits for similar
[2633.28s] earnings growth world uh going to grow
[2635.72s] 12 12 time uh
[2638.4s] 12% and you&#39;re paying you know a third
[2641.839s] less multiple for that earnings growth
[2645.2s] us Equity Market faces un unprecedented
[2647.88s] concentration at the top top eight
[2649.8s] stocks 35.7 last highest concentration
[2652.839s] 200000 so I continue to just remind you
[2655.4s] of this I&#39;m not calling for a 2,000 Tech
[2657.319s] rec I don&#39;t think that&#39;s happening
[2658.48s] because they have earnings power I&#39;m
[2659.96s] calling for a d rating of multiples uh
[2663.48s] in those baskets that are frothy uh
[2666.68s] while exposure to commodity sectors near
[2669.079s] is near low so we have our albamar we
[2671.52s] have our com stock thank you for all the
[2673.64s] kind tweets over the week uh lot many of
[2676.44s] you have doubled your money uh on that
[2679.079s] and uh we think that&#39;s just getting
[2680.559s] started but kudos to those who took
[2682.48s] chips off the table doubles are good
[2684.68s] things and
[2685.96s] congratulations uh long only exposure to
[2688.24s] financials increased but still has still
[2690.599s] light versus history so that&#39;s turning
[2693.68s] up uh we continue to look for
[2696.24s] opportunities to get back in but we have
[2699.88s] um we took a lot of profits in city and
[2703.28s] BAC over the summer they haven&#39;t gone up
[2705.24s] much since so that was basically dead
[2706.96s] money uh which was the right thing for
[2708.96s] us to do to take that off and buy things
[2710.88s] that were cheaper but we&#39;ll look for
[2713.16s] opportunities we still have exposure
[2714.52s] through PayPal which is up you know went
[2716.839s] from whatever it was 60 to 90 but that&#39;s
[2719.24s] pulling back a little bit we&#39;re going to
[2720.72s] stay with that for a while uh Market
[2723.92s] breath bad breath returns
[2727.68s] uh monthly Market breath is on Pace to
[2730.52s] hit an all-time low in December this was
[2733.16s] a big deal ladies and gentlemen and you
[2734.96s] haven&#39;t seen this bad of Market breath
[2737.72s] since the top of the 2000 Tech W which
[2740.72s] is why I um I would be very concerned if
[2747.04s] I was
[2748.4s] in just indices or instruments or single
[2753.0s] stocks that are concentrated and
[2755.16s] correlated uh or actually the mag 7 um
[2760.72s] it just doesn&#39;t bode well when you have
[2762.4s] that extreme waiting everyone&#39;s crowded
[2764.359s] into it and um and you&#39;re not going back
[2768.0s] to a zero interest rate policy
[2770.64s] environment uh you know you can you can
[2773.76s] play again you can bet against the odds
[2775.44s] and maybe you get another year where
[2776.88s] you&#39;re right but um I always just bet
[2780.119s] with the odds and and uh do it with low
[2782.319s] leverage and sooner or later it turns
[2784.119s] out and we mean revert and then when it
[2786.359s] turns it&#39;s just like overnight riches
[2788.559s] it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s exciting but um uh we&#39;re
[2791.64s] not there yet but I think we&#39;re very
[2793.16s] very very close uh earnings growth is
[2795.92s] expected to broaden in 2025 arguing for
[2799.04s] a broader rally we agree so last year it
[2803.64s] was somewhat Justified 36% earnings
[2805.599s] growth for the mag 7 4% for the rest of
[2808.559s] the index this year 19% for the mag 7
[2811.76s] but you&#39;re paying 34 times versus 133%
[2815.119s] for the rest of the market which you&#39;re
[2816.319s] only paying 18 times there you go ladies
[2819.119s] price is what you pay value is what you
[2821.28s] get gentlemen as well number of stocks
[2823.599s] shrinking since the late 1990s this is
[2826.24s] exciting this means there&#39;s less supply
[2828.76s] for more money chasing it don&#39;t worry
[2831.68s] Wall Street knows how to feed the Ducks
[2833.359s] when they&#39;re quacking you will see a ton
[2835.04s] of IPOs in the next couple of years that
[2837.4s] does not Mark a quote unquote top uh I&#39;d
[2840.92s] be a little bit more cautious in 2026
[2843.559s] and certainly 2027 but as far as like a
[2847.28s] secular uh everyone screwed you know
[2850.68s] 2009 or 2000 or 73 I I think that&#39;s five
[2855.76s] six seven eight years off uh hedge fund
[2860.52s] positioning this shows exposure to
[2863.359s] cyclicals versus defensives is at a
[2867.0s] record low uh their tendency is to be
[2871.88s] wrong uh so you want to take the other
[2874.079s] side which is more uh cyclical which are
[2877.68s] being given away right now the longest
[2879.72s] and shortest
[2881.119s] sectors uh basically energy is the most
[2884.599s] shorted sector right now which is why we
[2886.599s] continue despite having exposure through
[2889.28s] Comstock which has been
[2890.96s] amazing uh look for more opportunities I
[2894.119s] think we&#39;re going to probably wind up
[2896.559s] having to buy a serer but it may not be
[2899.839s] a full position materials is an easier
[2902.2s] one to get more excited about second
[2904.44s] most shorted lot of opportunities to do
[2906.88s] there we&#39;ve got albam Maro um maybe
[2909.599s] we&#39;ll get more but the problem is is the
[2911.44s] other thing is not only were we not
[2912.92s] correlated with the indices but we don&#39;t
[2916.2s] like to place too many bets that are
[2919.8s] effectively the same bet uh and um so
[2925.079s] you know you look at some of the Dow
[2926.52s] chemicals you look at some of the uh
[2931.04s] uh chemical stocks relative to albam
[2935.119s] Maro
[2936.839s] we want to get more exposure but we have
[2938.4s] to be careful that we W don&#39;t wind up
[2940.0s] with too much waiting
[2942.079s] in what is effectively the same trade um
[2947.4s] and then the least shorted is Healthcare
[2948.92s] and Staples so we&#39;ll keep an eye on that
[2952.0s] uh super micro most shorted stock
[2954.2s] Walmart Walmart is the least shorted
[2958.559s] stock that&#39;s interesting and not really
[2961.2s] useful
[2962.72s] information here are the most highest
[2965.359s] net exposure by head hedge
[2969.319s] funds lowest net
[2972.079s] exposure so none of them want Brown
[2975.319s] Forman albaro pool Corp Charter so
[2979.72s] here&#39;s your buy list
[2981.64s] Hershey
[2983.16s] uh
[2984.75s] [Music]
[2986.2s] Mna you know none of these are pounding
[2989.64s] the table but they the they&#39;re ones that
[2991.44s] I would definitely pay attention to
[2994.16s] Southwest Chevron Okay so that&#39;s that uh
[2998.04s] long only funds exposure to cyclical
[3001.359s] versus defensive also at all-time lows
[3004.48s] last time that happened was 2015 right
[3006.44s] before Trump was in and what what
[3007.839s] outperformed cyclicals after Trump got
[3009.96s] elected so there you go I mean again the
[3013.079s] these things you just have to be
[3014.839s] observant you don&#39;t have to be a genius
[3016.64s] you literally just have to pay attention
[3019.28s] and um you know live through enough
[3022.599s] cycles and have enough experience to say
[3024.72s] yes odds are in my favor I can&#39;t
[3026.76s] guaranteed I you know I don&#39;t have a
[3028.119s] crystal ball but when things are lined
[3030.319s] up like that uh that&#39;s how you can
[3034.119s] outperform over time is doing what the
[3037.319s] crowd&#39;s not doing and just doing it with
[3040.16s] low leverage so if you&#39;re quote wrong or
[3042.88s] what idiots say Traders day traders that
[3045.4s] live in their mom&#39;s basement early is
[3048.92s] wrong to have the fantasy that you&#39;re
[3051.64s] going to time it perfectly all you need
[3053.92s] to do is buy a quality business with a
[3056.72s] large enough margin of safety hopefully
[3058.88s] there&#39;s a catalyst you can see that it
[3060.88s] happens sooner rather than later cuz irr
[3063.0s] matters but if you have a basket of 8 or
[3064.88s] 12 some happen very very quick some take
[3067.72s] a little bit longer but on balance
[3069.24s] you&#39;re going to do just fine and um and
[3072.72s] and the the thing about it is it&#39;s not
[3076.16s] going to be linear it&#39;s not going to be
[3079.52s] you know every year a stair step up when
[3081.92s] you&#39;re doing uncorrelated business it&#39;s
[3083.76s] like you grind and then you have these
[3086.76s] that are just boom I mean it&#39;s just
[3088.76s] literally off the chart so um so you
[3091.599s] have to be accepting of that some people
[3093.04s] want to you know want to uh every week
[3095.319s] make money or every month make money and
[3097.24s] then after a couple years they give it
[3098.72s] all back to the casino uh have fun with
[3101.079s] that but if you buy businesses and you
[3102.799s] do private equity in the public markets
[3105.16s] you&#39;d be willing to buy the whole
[3106.44s] business uh it&#39;s just an awesome way to
[3108.799s] live that&#39;s all I can tell you uh last 3
[3111.52s] months long only&#39;s added exposure to
[3113.88s] financials chased them up decreased
[3115.799s] exposure to energy sold in the hole so
[3118.599s] that&#39;s why you know we&#39;ve got to
[3120.44s] consider looking for more opportunity in
[3123.079s] energy uh despite having a good position
[3127.799s] uh continuing to be a alert for an
[3130.119s] asymmetric opportunity and that&#39;s the
[3131.799s] problem I&#39;m just not finding asymmetric
[3133.52s] where I can make multiples of my money
[3135.44s] not get into it because I can make a 20
[3137.92s] or 40% punt I&#39;m not interested in that
[3140.839s] uh which is why I was so pissed when
[3142.28s] they were going to sell gxo at 60 or 70
[3145.2s] bucks uh I didn&#39;t get in for 60 or 70
[3148.24s] bucks I got in for 100 minimum uh and it
[3150.76s] could be a lot more if they continue to
[3152.68s] execute which we&#39;re going to talk about
[3154.0s] today most crowded stock in each sector
[3157.68s] like this is really valuable stuff I
[3159.88s] love this stuff I mean we&#39;ll be here for
[3161.96s] six hours if I go through all this which
[3163.88s] I&#39;m perfectly happy to do but um some of
[3166.319s] you uh have other things to do and I
[3168.52s] don&#39;t want your two two mile walk to
[3170.799s] turn into a 20 mile walk and uh you wind
[3173.48s] up in another state so uh hedge funds
[3175.92s] have decreed exposure to Staples this
[3177.92s] year uh I think there&#39;s some
[3180.119s] opportunities popping up in Staples
[3181.64s] believe it or not all styles are
[3183.64s] underweight Staples so that&#39;s where some
[3185.559s] opportunity is you look at the Hershey&#39;s
[3187.44s] you look to a lesser extent at coca
[3189.319s] colola you look at some of these I&#39;m
[3190.559s] seeing Staples pop up long which means
[3193.2s] rates are going down by the way I know
[3195.52s] no one believes that we&#39;re going to 5%
[3197.44s] we&#39;re not hang in there ladies and
[3200.079s] gentlemen long only the Hedge font
[3202.079s] exposure to energy is low versus
[3204.88s] history uh decrease exposure to
[3207.28s] materials of course that&#39;s where the
[3208.96s] opportunity is now underweight real
[3212.76s] estate uh all styles are underweight
[3215.04s] real estate sustained value run why okay
[3217.64s] so this is
[3220.0s] sa Savita
[3223.04s] saberian
[3224.839s] sagita I&#39;m getting her name wrong but
[3226.92s] you know who she is she&#39;s wonderful
[3228.48s] she&#39;s always on the the networks uh Fox
[3231.0s] Business CNBC uh she&#39;s a strategist at
[3233.64s] Bank of America so she&#39;s saying large
[3236.119s] cap is the best large kep value is the
[3237.839s] best hedge against duration risk cheap
[3239.64s] stocks outperform when profits pick up
[3241.24s] with expectations limited to periods of
[3242.76s] negative risk premum after decade of
[3244.88s] capital depriving dinging consolidation
[3247.76s] and balance sheet repair the Russell
[3249.16s] 1,000 value index quality is neck and
[3251.559s] neck with growth statistics favor value
[3253.4s] cheap neglected no concentration R risk
[3256.0s] high PE dispersion but this has been
[3258.28s] true for a while of course it doesn&#39;t
[3260.2s] work till it works uh how does it not
[3262.359s] work you Return To Zero interest rate
[3264.119s] policy which we&#39;re not going to do that
[3265.4s] implies a depression
[3267.44s] uh q no growth no inflation value very
[3271.64s] unlikely under Trump value and growth
[3274.04s] now neck and deck in terms of quality uh
[3277.119s] value stocks remain competitively pric
[3279.839s] priced versus credit 84 stocks 84% of
[3283.96s] stocks in the Russell 1000 value index
[3285.839s] offer excess earnings yields I.E EPS
[3288.559s] yield minus 10year real treasury yield
[3290.76s] above investment grade Bond spread uh
[3294.04s] this is what I talked about with Ash
[3296.68s] Webster value did not work during zero
[3299.4s] interest rate policy uh that was really
[3302.64s] the exception to the rule ladies and
[3304.24s] gentlemen and we&#39;re going to get into
[3305.68s] some data in just a
[3307.68s] second uh on average value outperforms
[3311.319s] growth by
[3313.2s] 4.4% in the last decade you you if you
[3316.2s] asked 50 people on the street uh what
[3319.4s] does better over time growth or value 49
[3322.599s] out of 50 uh are going to say growth
[3326.079s] only only growth you got to buy growth
[3327.44s] you got to buy growth AI man it&#39;s
[3329.16s] changing the world you know 3 years ago
[3331.52s] it was SAS before that it was internet
[3334.68s] of things you know the new flavor of the
[3337.16s] week but that is the exception not the
[3340.559s] rule okay and the rule is since 1927
[3345.0s] value outperforms growth buying quality
[3348.2s] businesses at low prices is how you make
[3349.96s] a fortune if you look at the Forbes 400
[3352.24s] and all the guys that manage money who
[3354.16s] are actually on it there&#39;s only one
[3355.599s] growth manager it&#39;s called Ron Baron and
[3357.92s] he got uh had this company called Tesla
[3360.68s] that he bet on in the early days and he
[3362.2s] stuck with and made unbelievable returns
[3364.44s] he&#39;s the only growth manager that I&#39;ve
[3366.52s] ever seen that had durable uh
[3369.039s] performance over over time and if you
[3371.359s] look at the growth managers who do well
[3373.039s] it&#39;s usually concentrated in one stock
[3375.76s] um live and die um but the guys on the
[3378.96s] forest 400 who manage money they they&#39;re
[3380.76s] all value guys I mean that&#39;s just the
[3382.48s] bottom line so whether it&#39;s Buffett
[3384.76s] gelly cooperman
[3386.92s] uh Tepper
[3389.48s] icon there&#39;s a reason for it ladies and
[3391.839s] gentlemen so uh value St value trades at
[3395.079s] an extreme discount to growth on a Ford
[3396.96s] PE so you know if I&#39;m just coming out of
[3399.0s] school and I just read the intelligent
[3400.64s] investor I I I wake up in the morning
[3403.24s] and I feel like I stepped in you know
[3404.88s] what like how lucky can you get you&#39;re
[3406.839s] in this generational opportunity where
[3409.72s] value is going to start to dramatically
[3411.359s] finally outperform growth it&#39;s two
[3413.44s] standard deviations belong the long-term
[3415.48s] mean the the per uh value relative to
[3418.799s] growth the last time it got this low was
[3421.92s] uh the early 2000s and then you had a
[3424.48s] period of seven years of dramatic
[3426.119s] outperformance of uh value worth is
[3429.2s] versus growth so you know if you&#39;re
[3432.0s] getting into the business in
[3435.0s] uh
[3437.0s] 2010 or
[3439.0s] 2011 and you were just or you know
[3442.039s] 92 and you you got the value bug you had
[3445.28s] to wait a while until started to
[3446.839s] outperform uh last time before 2001
[3450.319s] where it was just a generational
[3451.72s] opportunity to start buying value Was
[3453.76s] 1980 in 1981 the beginning of the Reagan
[3456.24s] Administration after they were taking
[3457.68s] rates down just like they did in last 12
[3460.2s] months and then for the next 10 years
[3461.839s] value dramatically outperformed so here
[3463.799s] we are ladies and gentlemen and uh No
[3466.96s] One Believes it and and that&#39;s what it
[3468.839s] has to be in order for it to be that
[3471.2s] great and um here on every metric price
[3475.4s] versus book
[3476.839s] uh price versus sales you don&#39;t get
[3478.64s] these value these relative
[3480.68s] valuations you get them once every 20
[3482.88s] years and you got to make hey while the
[3484.72s] sunshines and I think the next six seven
[3486.559s] years we&#39;re going to make be able to
[3488.319s] make more money in a shorter period of
[3490.16s] time than has ever been done in a very
[3492.119s] in a generation and that&#39;ll be it and
[3494.079s] you know uh you know we&#39;ll raise a ton
[3497.92s] of cash in the early 2030s and uh look
[3500.88s] for some asymmetric bets but this is
[3503.119s] this is going to be the most exciting 5
[3505.799s] six seven years for a value investor
[3508.0s] that I think we&#39;ve seen in 20 years 40
[3510.92s] years and then probably before that 60
[3512.68s] years when Buffett started his career in
[3514.359s] the 50s uh and you had the same exact
[3517.48s] setup and Buffett often acknowledges I
[3519.44s] just got lucky when I started if you
[3521.76s] believe in this philosophy and framework
[3523.76s] and you&#39;re starting now either as a
[3525.799s] client or in the
[3527.68s] industry you couldn&#39;t be luckier and um
[3531.48s] so that&#39;s that uh price of sales here is
[3534.119s] value has outperformed growth over the
[3535.76s] long term this is juxtaposing that 2,000
[3540.119s] trough two standard deviation uh low of
[3544.64s] relative forward PE of the Russell 1,000
[3547.44s] value versus the growth
[3549.28s] indices um so what they&#39;re basically
[3552.559s] saying
[3553.799s] is we
[3558.44s] trough this point here value versus
[3561.68s] growth trough in
[3563.839s] 2021 if you remember the peak when you
[3566.68s] had Ark uh went parabolic and all these
[3570.319s] you know money losing companies were
[3572.24s] trading at crazy valuations that was the
[3574.839s] absolute peak of the crazy town that was
[3577.88s] still zurp before they started raising
[3580.319s] rates and since then we&#39;ve started to
[3582.76s] see the early stages of value uh
[3585.92s] starting to come to life and fits and
[3587.96s] starts and just like it did in uh this
[3591.0s] would have been 2000 equals 2021 and
[3595.28s] what&#39;s starting to happen and its early
[3597.48s] days six plus years it&#39;s going to be
[3599.72s] awesome then you can just see it in the
[3601.319s] bar chart
[3602.88s] here uh relative return of growth versus
[3606.24s] value and here you go uh in the years
[3609.119s] when value outperforms it outperforms so
[3611.119s] big and that&#39;s most years ladies and
[3612.64s] gentlemen I know it&#39;s so hard to believe
[3614.64s] because this right here this Zer period
[3617.28s] that I&#39;m showing you is an AB is the
[3619.839s] exception not the rule and because of
[3622.119s] recency bias everyone thinks it&#39;s the
[3624.359s] rule and they&#39;re going to get
[3625.359s] slaughtered I mean that&#39;s
[3627.599s] just it&#39;s just math you know there there
[3630.44s] laws of attract there there laws of
[3633.079s] physics there laws of Statistics there
[3635.559s] are laws of gravity there are different
[3638.079s] things and I&#39;m not I&#39;m the most bullish
[3640.72s] guy
[3641.96s] you it&#39;s it&#39;s a strange thing to be
[3646.119s] seeing this level of extreme and being
[3648.2s] so bullish because I&#39;m being selective
[3650.4s] on where I&#39;m being bullish you know the
[3652.16s] biggest Fortunes in the shortest amount
[3653.92s] of time were made in the 70s and the the
[3657.28s] general indices from 1968 to
[3661.2s] 1981 did
[3663.72s] 0% 0% in price and that&#39;s where Buffett
[3668.119s] made all his money gabelli made all his
[3669.96s] money cooperman made the whole value
[3671.96s] Mafia made billions of dollars during
[3674.4s] that period while the indices did
[3676.44s] nothing and the nifty50 got their asses
[3679.48s] reamed and the nifty50 back then is the
[3683.44s] equivalent of the mag 7 today
[3686.44s] uh the difference was the nifty50 was a
[3689.0s] company called Avon Cosmetics which just
[3692.039s] went basically bankrupt sold to Cody for
[3694.72s] nothing Tupperware IBM blah blah blah
[3698.16s] all the High Flyers that got smoked and
[3700.16s] never recovered so
[3704.88s] um anyway you could tell I&#39;m excited but
[3707.76s] look at this year by year value
[3710.0s] outperformed 81 133% 8 82 even 83 out
[3715.88s] performed by 12% 85 outperformed by 11%
[3720.16s] every year 5% outperformance 12% 9% 15%
[3724.119s] 29% outperformance after the tech uh
[3727.079s] peak in 2000 then you had look at this
[3730.44s] this is crazy 2000 this was when they
[3734.16s] put Buffett on the cover and say the old
[3736.52s] man has lost his touch I think it was
[3738.2s] Forbes or fortune or whatever because
[3740.079s] while everyone was buying Global
[3742.279s] Crossing and Enron he was buying uh
[3745.92s] caola and American Express and Bank of
[3748.839s] America and in 2000 when everyone was
[3751.039s] negative he was positive and here&#39;s what
[3753.559s] happened value outperformed by
[3755.76s] 29% 2001 value outperformed by 15% 2002
[3760.24s] it outperformed by 12% 2004 outperformed
[3763.359s] by 10% outperformed by 2% outperformed
[3766.24s] by 13% and then zero interest rate
[3768.559s] policy kicked in and you had the swing
[3770.52s] to the pendulum uh but if you go back to
[3774.359s] 1927 this was really the only major
[3778.0s] exception uh except some part of the 60s
[3780.88s] where you had that level of
[3782.0s] outperformance during the nifty50
[3783.839s] largest five stocks represent 27% you
[3786.039s] can see here
[3787.559s] visibly uh I&#39;m just trying to make a
[3789.599s] point ladies and gentlemen I hope you&#39;re
[3791.279s] getting it and I hope you extract value
[3793.119s] from it because it&#39;s important
[3795.039s] accelerating profits growth would
[3796.4s] historically favor value value is
[3798.24s] greater than growth when profits
[3799.96s] accelerate value performance during the
[3802.119s] profit cycle 82 to present and we&#39;re
[3805.96s] seeing uh the acceleration right now
[3809.799s] largest 7 S&amp;P stocks trade at a 50%
[3812.799s] premium again this is reverting it&#39;s the
[3815.319s] beginning of the reversion there&#39;s a lot
[3816.839s] more reversion to go ladies and
[3818.64s] gentlemen just look at these if you&#39;re
[3820.2s] listening to it I really feel bad for
[3821.88s] you this week you should probably take
[3823.839s] it 30 minutes just to get out this block
[3826.039s] you can ignore the TV stuff just listen
[3828.4s] to that but this part&#39;s important uh
[3831.64s] more than one in three Russell 2000
[3833.44s] companies is unprofitable uh um yeah and
[3837.559s] this this is presented as it&#39;s a bad
[3839.64s] thing but if you look at all the periods
[3841.92s] where small caps dramatically
[3843.88s] outperformed they all started like this
[3846.359s] go look at small caps from 2001 to 2007
[3849.68s] they all started with the huge
[3851.24s] percentage unprofitable and then they
[3853.76s] absolutely dramatically outperformed
[3855.799s] early 90s same story 2010 same story I
[3861.119s] midcaps remain historically inexpensive
[3862.96s] relative to Mega caps we&#39;ve covered that
[3864.839s] before companies tend to outperform
[3867.2s] after spin-offs so uh we&#39;ve talked about
[3869.96s] that in the past spin-offs generate
[3871.52s] Alpha so we got to be on alert for more
[3873.64s] spin-offs uh equal weight S&amp;P 500 trough
[3876.599s] versus cap weighted
[3878.079s] index uh in July we talked about that
[3881.119s] with Ash Webster the breath started to
[3883.839s] broaden we had an Abrupt interruption in
[3886.319s] December because of the election because
[3888.359s] of rates in the dollar which again we
[3891.4s] know we uh know where the probabilities
[3895.079s] lie Pro respectively regarding those
[3897.0s] instruments that affect everything else
[3899.2s] hedge funds shine during periods of
[3901.079s] heightened
[3902.839s] volatility that&#39;s what we are entering
[3904.839s] with higher rates us regime indicator
[3907.44s] improved in November potentially
[3909.2s] entering recovery what does that mean
[3911.68s] what is a regime indicator
[3914.279s] well high quality lowrisk large size
[3918.319s] that is what we just came out of what
[3920.599s] are we going into ladies and gentlemen
[3922.88s] we just coming out of that we&#39;re going
[3924.92s] into value small size high risk uh
[3929.0s] perceived by turnarounds okay
[3931.64s] turnarounds are perceived as highrisk
[3933.24s] which is why no one wants them because
[3934.48s] no one actually likes to read past the
[3937.0s] price chart and actually understand the
[3938.64s] balance sheet and cash flows and
[3940.279s] solvency uh analysis uh which is great
[3943.68s] I&#39;m glad there&#39;s so little competition
[3945.88s] in that uh otherwise I&#39;d be out of a job
[3948.44s] so um so that&#39;s exciting so we&#39;re moving
[3951.64s] right into this phase one and then uh
[3955.2s] and so on so this is just where where
[3957.039s] it&#39;s beginning dividends historically
[3958.839s] followed EPS we expect dividend growth
[3960.839s] to accelerate to plus 12% in
[3964.279s] 20125 a lot of dividend stock
[3966.68s] opportunities Stanley Black and&amp; Decker
[3969.279s] back the whole gamut ample room to
[3972.48s] increase dividend payout ratio is 30%
[3975.279s] today versus the long-term average of
[3977.319s] 50% look at this this it&#39;s all this zero
[3980.72s] interest rate policy nonsense this is
[3982.76s] going to revert back dividend should
[3985.0s] contribute more total returns than the
[3986.68s] last decade the last decade was the
[3988.599s] exception not the rule historically from
[3991.0s] 1936 to 2012 before Zer dividend return
[3994.599s] was 40% of the total return price was
[3997.279s] only 60% in Zer zero interest rate
[4000.24s] policy dividend return was 16 price was
[4003.279s] 84% that game is changing ladies and
[4005.92s] gentlemen right side ising long duration
[4007.76s] growth versus cash return value within
[4010.079s] the S&amp;P has just begun Just Begun
[4014.68s] dividend yield exp inexpensive versus
[4017.079s] history we love that we covered that
[4019.599s] with
[4020.4s] Ash um this is just a a survey of
[4023.92s] alternative data sources being used we
[4026.2s] use some of them low PE tops the survey
[4029.72s] for n9th year
[4032.319s] running
[4033.44s] [Music]
[4037.359s] um a forward PE so so this is the metric
[4040.839s] that most managers are using which is
[4043.559s] kind of comical uh you&#39;re Europeans use
[4046.039s] more price to free cash flow that&#39;s
[4047.599s] interesting size increasingly matters
[4051.119s] they they use Target price no one uses
[4053.839s] price to
[4055.16s] sales
[4057.24s] um share repurchases Etc so it&#39;s just
[4060.24s] been a little bit crazy town because of
[4062.0s] free money money is no longer free
[4064.279s] people are just waking up to that fact
[4065.92s] that the real estate the real estate
[4067.4s] market has figured it out uh now the
[4069.64s] equities Market is starting to figure it
[4071.24s] out quintile uh Russell 1000 stocks what
[4074.76s] do we have here top dividend yield so
[4077.24s] you can see here this is basically a buy
[4079.079s] list B Baxter International I mean there
[4081.76s] are just a lot of great companies in
[4083.599s] here to pay attention to Scott&#39;s Miracle
[4085.96s] Grow
[4089.24s] um Nordstrom&#39;s getting takeen private
[4092.2s] Target maybe Ken view is interesting
[4094.52s] Staples no one wants that&#39;s kind of
[4096.64s] interesting Gilead&#39;s already started to
[4098.759s] move uh some of the refiners Pepsi has
[4101.4s] been beaten down metronic you can&#39;t give
[4103.239s] away Healthcare we like that so there&#39;s
[4105.56s] just a lot of stuff here skyworks is
[4107.679s] kind of interesting
[4109.12s] J&amp;J
[4110.759s] Amgen
[4117.159s] um M
[4119.52s] Cisco Molson
[4121.799s] Kors Kellan NOA Avalon Bay so
[4126.48s] yeah here is more what do you got City
[4131.08s] there new brands
[4135.64s] okay so here&#39;s the data on value versus
[4138.48s] growth so you can just get a perspective
[4140.799s] historically value stocks have
[4142.359s] outperformed growth stocks in the US
[4144.359s] Often by a striking amount the data
[4146.56s] covering nearly a century backs up the
[4148.759s] notion that value stocks those with
[4150.92s] lower relative prices have higher
[4153.199s] expected returns while disappointing
[4155.52s] periods emerge from time to time the
[4157.239s] principle that lower relative prices
[4159.719s] lead to higher expected returns Remains
[4162.48s] the Same value premiums have often shown
[4164.96s] up quick ly and en llarge magnitudes for
[4167.44s] example in years when value outperformed
[4169.96s] growth the average premium was nearly
[4173.48s] 15% 15% on average value stocks have
[4176.88s] outperformed growth Stocks by
[4179.96s] 4.4% annually in the US since
[4184.44s] 1927 so you can&#39;t see it or understand
[4189.44s] it here because of this Zer aberration
[4192.6s] but that&#39;s the aberration the rule is is
[4195.679s] price is what you pay value what you get
[4198.76s] and again unless you believe we are
[4202.12s] going back to Zer which means a
[4204.159s] depression deflation uh type environment
[4207.96s] then you want to be getting some
[4209.679s] exposure to uh getting more for the same
[4214.04s] amount of money more growth lower
[4216.48s] multiple same money while Street
[4219.6s] forecasts a bigger increase in earnings
[4221.4s] for small caps we covered that average
[4223.8s] small cap returns have been particularly
[4225.6s] strong when inflation has been 1 to
[4228.44s] 3% uh periods of rising m&amp;a activity
[4232.239s] have historically delivered strong
[4234.239s] Equity returns particularly you can see
[4237.56s] here uh for small caps and midcaps as
[4241.32s] well and then
[4246.159s] uh okay credit this from Seth golden
[4248.719s] credit card debt rising to new record
[4250.64s] levels is good credit card debt has
[4252.719s] fallen so people are saying credit card
[4254.36s] debts at record high
[4256.6s] well the only time that credit card debt
[4258.719s] goes down is when you&#39;re in a recession
[4260.76s] so the last thing you want to to root
[4263.04s] for is uh credit card balance is going
[4265.8s] down that&#39;s all I can say what matters
[4267.64s] is Debt Service as a percentage of
[4269.92s] disposable income and that&#39;s near
[4271.36s] multi-decade lows uh labor markets are
[4274.0s] fully rebalanced should continue to see
[4275.8s] wage and services
[4277.88s] disinflation
[4279.52s] uh us growth outperformance was driven
[4282.08s] by outsized increase in
[4283.88s] productivity two 12,000 people turning
[4287.12s] 35 every day in the US here&#39;s that
[4289.48s] market breath chart again that is
[4291.719s] probably the most important one of the
[4293.0s] week pboc People&#39;s Bank of China steps
[4296.36s] up liquidity injections via new tools so
[4298.88s] they&#39;re getting with it they&#39;re just
[4300.12s] kind of biting their time until the
[4301.92s] inauguration and as they did last time
[4305.0s] you can see the dramatic
[4307.04s] underperformance of the Dow in December
[4309.56s] was just a a weird situation that&#39;ll
[4312.679s] bounce back like a rubber band ball
[4314.76s] you&#39;re already seeing it uh today with
[4318.239s] some of the mag sevens getting hit Etc
[4321.44s] these were the charts that I talked
[4322.84s] about pmo buy all at zero that&#39;s usually
[4325.239s] a time to be buying stuff SPX buying
[4328.84s] stuff National Association of active
[4330.44s] investment managers down uh these are
[4332.84s] all good signs uh if you know how to
[4334.84s] pick stocks large gains tend to happen
[4336.88s] more more than you expected here&#39;s the
[4339.639s] late 90s it can go for a number of years
[4342.639s] uh 50s Etc Chinese government Buy
[4345.44s] dropped meaningfully in
[4347.84s] 2004 same story before the election uh
[4350.639s] before the inauguration we expect
[4352.56s] double- digit returns from most actively
[4354.88s] attractively valued Global markets so
[4359.28s] expected returns in US dollars us. is
[4361.52s] the lowest China and Brazil are the
[4363.719s] highest this is from Morning Star
[4365.719s] Investment Management S&amp;P after it falls
[4368.679s] at least three consecutive days to end
[4370.92s] the
[4371.679s] year uh on average a month later it&#39;s up
[4374.76s] 6% % so we&#39;ll see if that happens uh
[4377.4s] first year of the presidential cycle is
[4379.08s] usually weak the exception was Trump
[4381.159s] Trump&#39;s back so maybe this will be
[4383.0s] another exception we&#39;ll find out 20%
[4385.32s] yearly gain suggest more green but don&#39;t
[4387.239s] expect a bigger year than 2023 average
[4389.639s] return after these type of gains is
[4392.96s] 10% I think that&#39;s in the neighborhood
[4395.239s] of reasonable uh this is lining up 2000
[4398.32s] to uh
[4399.92s] 2021 again and how value is starting to
[4403.28s] come back in fits and starts and will
[4405.12s] will start to scream back sooner than
[4407.52s] people are
[4409.08s] expecting uh X recessions inflation
[4412.04s] tends to rise about 6 months after the
[4413.48s] first red cut we&#39;re on track with that
[4416.6s] dollar spot index around election days
[4418.48s] 2016 and 2024 so again uh people are
[4422.239s] picking up on what we&#39;ve been saying for
[4423.76s] months Tok or not months after Trump got
[4426.92s] elected dollar is going to go up then
[4428.92s] it&#39;s going to go down after the
[4429.96s] inauguration same with yields Tokyo CPI
[4433.239s] going up which means jgb these yields
[4435.92s] will be going up which means carry trade
[4438.6s] will be unwinding which means what all
[4440.88s] that hot money is coming out of Mag 7
[4445.08s] inflation in Japan&#39;s Central Capital
[4449.239s] inflation in Japan&#39;s capital accelerates
[4451.52s] keeps rate hike prospects intact rate
[4454.44s] hikes equals unwind carry trade equals
[4457.4s] unwind mag 7 or rate mag 7 to lower more
[4461.48s] realistic multiples in line with
[4463.8s] increased capex and lower Returns on
[4465.96s] that capx um decelerating return on
[4469.48s] invested capital China 10-year
[4472.04s] government bond yield same story we
[4474.32s] covered China plans record $411 billion
[4477.679s] special treasury bond IND uh issuance
[4480.159s] next year for fiscal spending no one&#39;s
[4482.6s] paying attention uh S&amp;P 500 Mo members
[4486.8s] below their 50-day moving average it&#39;s
[4488.56s] usually an opportunity to buy not sell
[4490.6s] like last October Dallas fed
[4492.88s] manufacturing turning up we&#39;re coming
[4494.56s] out of the manufacturing depression that
[4496.92s] we&#39;ve been in for 3 years um same story
[4501.52s] with the Chinese
[4502.88s] Yuan uh devalue before the inauguration
[4506.56s] China non-manufacturing PMI is turning
[4509.08s] up into expansion no one&#39;s paying
[4510.96s] attention to it China&#39;s service activity
[4513.159s] jumps as stimulus boosts local demand
[4516.08s] monthly Market breath we covered that in
[4519.04s] case that wasn&#39;t an important enough
[4520.639s] chart uh public versus private
[4522.88s] Enterprise Value to ebit a multiples
[4524.52s] here&#39;s automotive sales volume is
[4526.88s] through the roof that is good for
[4528.96s] albamar because they&#39;re selling all the
[4530.8s] EV story is there people are getting
[4533.08s] faked out because the demand is
[4534.719s] decelerating in the developed
[4538.88s] market for EVS but accelerating for
[4542.159s] hybrids and in China it&#39;s still through
[4544.32s] the roof because it&#39;s an unnatural
[4545.8s] stimulated market and that&#39;s going to
[4547.239s] continue that helps that Supply glut in
[4549.96s] lithium start to normalize over the next
[4552.08s] 12 to 18 months and albam Maro has the
[4554.199s] operating Leverage G the staying power
[4556.36s] with 3.4 billion of liquidity to hockey
[4558.96s] stick as a result uh wall Street&#39;s
[4562.0s] predictions for uh uh S&amp;P 500 end ofe
[4565.84s] targets the highest is Deutsche Bank at
[4567.56s] 7,000 the median is 6600 which implies
[4571.4s] you know 10 11% gain um we&#39;ll see what
[4575.56s] extent do you think the Magnificent
[4576.88s] Seven tech stocks will either be up or
[4578.76s] down in 2025 we will bucket the answers
[4581.8s] so slide as near as possible to your
[4583.88s] desired answer
[4587.8s] so they&#39;re
[4597.719s] expecting the the biggest concentration
[4600.32s] of people are expecting mag 7 to only be
[4603.36s] up 0 to
[4607.4s] 10% whereas last year they expected it
[4610.48s] to be up last December they expected
[4612.56s] this year to be up 20 to 30% and they
[4614.199s] were right so they&#39;re expecting way more
[4617.4s] subdued returns from mag 7 this year
[4620.44s] where do you see the 10-year treasury
[4622.08s] yields at the end of
[4624.6s] 2025 uh the biggest proportion are
[4627.08s] seeing it between 425 and 450 so lower
[4630.199s] than
[4631.04s] here uh and another big group is between
[4633.92s] 375 to
[4635.4s] 4 I think that&#39;s a a reasonable range I
[4638.44s] think four is the right
[4641.0s] number
[4642.12s] [Music]
[4643.48s] um what do you think the return of the
[4645.719s] S&amp;P 500 will be in 2025 this is all from
[4648.56s] Deutsche Bank by the way survey uh the
[4651.679s] bulk vast majority think the
[4655.159s] biggest 35% think it&#39;s going to be
[4657.76s] between 5 and 10% I&#39;m in that group last
[4661.08s] year the biggest group thought it was
[4662.28s] going to be between zero and 5% and it
[4664.719s] was it was much bigger so uh we&#39;ll see
[4668.12s] maybe they actually be right this year
[4670.159s] uh in your opinion do you think the
[4671.239s] following are more likely to double or
[4672.639s] have in the next big move
[4677.239s] Bitcoin and Nidia
[4680.199s] so in December of
[4682.719s] 2024
[4686.719s] 52% believe that Nvidia is likely to H
[4691.32s] more likely to have than to double last
[4693.639s] year it was only
[4695.679s] 41%
[4698.239s] um
[4700.44s] 61%
[4702.08s] believe that Bitcoin is is more likely
[4705.88s] to
[4707.32s] have
[4713.52s] um more people thought Nvidia would
[4715.96s] double last year and more people thought
[4718.84s] that Bitcoin would double last December
[4721.08s] so let&#39;s see if they&#39;re right again this
[4723.199s] year uh S&amp;P entry year declines we
[4726.52s] covered that that&#39;s just another
[4728.239s] variation of the Dietrich
[4732.08s] chart median 2 we s P return since 1950
[4737.12s] what they&#39;re trying to portray here
[4738.639s] Goldman Sachs is that the first half of
[4740.679s] January tends to be really good uh tends
[4743.28s] to be up 1.25% an average year Isn&#39;t So
[4746.36s] average that&#39;s from drick uh boy we
[4749.32s] brought you more data in a shorter
[4751.04s] amount of time this week than we ever
[4752.8s] have and probably ever will so enjoy it
[4756.04s] uh this is uh home prices turning down
[4758.92s] that&#39;s good economic surprise index down
[4761.6s] here&#39;s a Divergence with the 10-year
[4762.96s] yield so either the economic surprise
[4764.719s] prizes need to catch back up or the
[4767.28s] 10-year yield needs to catch back down I
[4769.12s] think it&#39;s going to be the latter in the
[4770.8s] short term
[4773.04s] [Music]
[4774.199s] um and I think the reason is going to be
[4777.719s] that companies are going to be guiding
[4780.04s] down due to the aberrational strength
[4783.96s] headwind of the US dollar in the fourth
[4786.239s] quarter so the surprises are going to be
[4788.84s] negative uh even though the dollar will
[4791.08s] start turning down which helps them in
[4792.88s] forward quarters uh uh uh it we we&#39;ll
[4797.36s] start to see this catch down which means
[4799.0s] 10year yields down which should be good
[4800.92s] for mortgage rates which should be good
[4802.679s] for housing which you can&#39;t give away
[4804.48s] which is another area we should be
[4805.84s] paying attention to earnings growth
[4808.0s] again small cap uh this is in the
[4810.199s] Russell 200000 because a lot of them are
[4811.8s] inflecting from negative to positive
[4814.04s] 53% that&#39;s unbelievable the small cap uh
[4818.12s] 600 again 21% corporate credit spreads
[4821.679s] record low Lottery financing going to
[4823.48s] happen 10e returns around the start of
[4825.719s] fed cutting cycles first
[4830.679s] cut okay so we we&#39;re we&#39;re below
[4838.28s] average for treasuries after the first
[4841.679s] cut but there&#39;s a huge catch up and it&#39;s
[4843.159s] always positive so you want to be a
[4845.12s] buyer TLT not a seller in this in the in
[4847.76s] the intermediate term for sure dollars
[4850.159s] Divergence from fair value it&#39;s
[4851.6s] excessively valued it&#39;s excessively
[4853.8s] crowded it&#39;s going to change uh I&#39;m
[4856.36s] optimistic 2025 will be better for me
[4858.36s] than 2024 uh top countries Indonesia is
[4861.32s] number one 90% of people believe that
[4863.44s] Columbia is number two 88% of people
[4865.48s] believe that China is number three 87%
[4868.48s] of the Chinese believe 2025 is going to
[4870.44s] be better than
[4871.84s] 2024 uh versus the United States we
[4876.48s] only we&#39;re way down on the list 70%
[4879.44s] believe that it&#39;s going to be better um
[4881.96s] and Japan 38% believe remember that was
[4884.719s] most crowded trade it was just hot money
[4886.28s] ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s going back to
[4888.8s] China uh small cap ramp and earnings we
[4891.4s] covered covered
[4893.6s] that uh NASDAQ made a gravestone dogee
[4897.8s] for all of you uh on a monthly basis so
[4901.28s] last time it did that was 2021 before
[4903.239s] you had the
[4904.56s] 2022 Tech
[4906.76s] selloff um so that looks like bad news
[4909.36s] for people in the mag 7 and in general
[4911.239s] indices and good news for us however
[4915.6s] uh the you know uh sentiment Trader says
[4919.0s] not always a great signal good signal
[4921.159s] sometimes but there here are you know 1
[4923.32s] two 3 four five 6 S 8 nine 10 uh other
[4927.56s] times and yeah top top top close to a
[4932.08s] top nowhere near a top uh close to a top
[4936.48s] top nowhere near a top so it&#39;s a mixed
[4939.28s] it&#39;s a coin flip so this doesn&#39;t
[4940.76s] necessarily mean that&#39;s going to repeat
[4943.639s] but it&#39;s something to pay attention to
[4946.8s] uh small cap earnings growth again
[4948.96s] here&#39;s the mag 7 here&#39;s the last 10
[4951.6s] bubbles oil in the early 2000s NASDAQ in
[4955.28s] the late 90s nikay in the late 80s gold
[4957.84s] in the late mid 70s nifty 50 which we
[4961.08s] just discussed in the 60s so the mag 7
[4963.6s] is the most ex stretched out of all of
[4965.239s] them again I don&#39;t I don&#39;t see a crash I
[4968.159s] see a reating in multiples and I see a
[4970.719s] new emergence of leadership the
[4972.56s] companies that benefit from AI versus
[4975.4s] the companies creating AI uh is is kind
[4978.36s] of how I&#39;m thinking about it we covered
[4980.84s] that this is from fund Strat S&amp;P down
[4985.08s] three days or more in a row in the last
[4986.52s] five trading days of the year the return
[4989.36s] median return for January the next year
[4991.28s] is plus 3.6 q1 plus 5.2 full year plus
[4995.199s] 12.4 I think that&#39;s well within the
[4997.8s] realm of possibility I love that
[4999.28s] empirical data Tom Lee smart guy
[5002.0s] corporate net interest payments near
[5003.92s] record low levels corporate balance
[5006.36s] sheets are in good shape ladies and
[5007.56s] gentlemen they&#39;re going to get even
[5008.6s] better refinancing down in the first
[5011.08s] half of
[5012.28s] 2025 the investment bankers are going to
[5015.36s] be busier than a one-arm paper hanger uh
[5018.4s] here&#39;s the Mosaic of returns we did see
[5020.96s] Emerging Markets finally get off the mat
[5023.28s] even Baba is up 10% but this is pocket
[5027.76s] change this is rounding errors this is
[5029.84s] nothing compared to what&#39;s going to be
[5031.04s] taking place um fixed income was the
[5033.679s] worst and as you can see what the reason
[5035.08s] I always show this quilt is because it
[5037.08s] rotates and I think we&#39;re going to see
[5038.6s] bonds uh
[5040.199s] outperform uh in 2025 Reit will benefit
[5045.48s] from that developed Market Equity was uh
[5048.44s] towards the lower level that could could
[5051.159s] bounce back and then us large cap was at
[5054.04s] the top but as you can see it doesn&#39;t
[5055.4s] stay at the top to long last time it was
[5057.08s] at the top was uh 2019 and then it
[5060.719s] dropped big by
[5062.199s] 2022 and then you had
[5064.84s] uh
[5067.239s] 200 oh that&#39;s the average
[5070.52s] um 2013 to 15 and then it drops so zero
[5074.84s] interest rate
[5076.8s] policy you have to believe rates are
[5079.119s] going back to zero to
[5081.679s] be unequivocally overweight and
[5084.76s] unworried about being in that
[5086.76s] concentrated
[5088.52s] bucket and I
[5091.28s] think we&#39;re getting close to the end of
[5094.52s] the data so we can get on to the article
[5096.4s] of the week but I didn&#39;t want to miss
[5098.719s] anything and I don&#39;t think I did
[5102.4s] um value versus growth
[5105.96s] again this hasn&#39;t been a better
[5109.04s] opportunity since
[5110.679s] 2001 just reemphasizing same with equal
[5113.679s] weight versus two um the index
[5117.159s] volatility is the toll we pay to invest
[5120.119s] various declines per year from 1928 to
[5122.92s] 2023
[5125.84s] um per year on average you get
[5130.76s] 7.23% dips you get
[5135.239s] 3.45% Corrections you get 1.1 10%
[5139.4s] correction per year you get 05 15%
[5143.96s] Corrections per year and you get3 30
[5146.8s] basis points of the the time you get a
[5149.44s] 20% bare Market one every 3.5 years so
[5152.96s] this is just part of it and you know the
[5155.199s] reason private equity and private credit
[5157.8s] have become so popular is because
[5160.08s] there&#39;s no Mark to Market so if you run
[5161.92s] a pension you get to stick in these
[5164.88s] vehicles which is marked to make make
[5167.119s] believe and the purveyors of these
[5170.28s] beautiful instruments that never go down
[5173.08s] um according to the marks that they take
[5175.56s] collect their 2% whether they&#39;re in
[5178.639s] actuality going up or down because
[5180.6s] they&#39;re marking it to whatever they want
[5183.719s] uh versus what the actual Market is the
[5185.88s] public markets tell you what it is but
[5187.48s] they don&#39;t have to mark to the public
[5189.04s] markets and then what happens is you get
[5191.719s] caught in a cycle and all of a sudden
[5193.76s] you are marking to make believe marking
[5195.679s] to make believe and you get marked down
[5197.639s] to zero and you say what happened I you
[5199.48s] know how did this happen overnight
[5201.4s] because you had no indications along the
[5203.48s] way of the real Market valuing it and
[5205.92s] giving you regular decisions to make it
[5208.76s] all you were looking for was to dampen
[5210.84s] volatility which is a guarantee to get
[5213.28s] all the volatility at once at when
[5215.719s] everyone gets the volatility and to get
[5217.48s] smoked so if you want low volatility
[5220.679s] because you think you&#39;re taking lower
[5222.199s] risk let me tell you you&#39;re taking much
[5225.4s] more Risk by entering quote unquote low
[5228.6s] volatility with perfect smooth Mark to
[5231.679s] markets where you want to to make your
[5234.08s] money is in well you do whatever you
[5237.48s] want to do all of this is opinion not
[5239.239s] advice I&#39;ve just been to many movies and
[5241.52s] I know how they end this fantasy about
[5244.199s] private credit being uh beautiful and
[5246.639s] private Equity being beautiful time will
[5249.4s] tell uh and when the chickens come home
[5251.6s] to roost those marks are going to be
[5253.48s] completely worthless and the 2% that
[5255.679s] they extracted regardless of the returns
[5257.8s] is going to prove to be uh to their
[5260.199s] benefit and
[5262.4s] um um irrespective of the marks coming
[5265.32s] down all at once so that&#39;s where it is
[5267.44s] I&#39;m not calling for that I think the
[5268.76s] econom is going to be strong for the
[5269.84s] next five six years so only the
[5271.32s] egregious actors but uh but they
[5275.52s] it&#39;s coming so uh here is sentiment
[5278.92s] again they&#39;re saying it&#39;s elevated but
[5280.56s] not at extremes we agree Bond
[5282.84s] allocations have been declining since
[5284.199s] mid
[5285.159s] 2023 that&#39;s when you want to be buying
[5287.4s] so that&#39;s that&#39;s uh TLT great financial
[5290.36s] crisis push stock allocations below the
[5292.4s] traditional 60 to 65% ban so while a lot
[5296.159s] of money&#39;s flowing in it&#39;s still
[5298.36s] relatively low and below average
[5300.32s] relative to you know 40 Years of History
[5302.84s] so there&#39;s upside room there there and
[5304.96s] that&#39;s that all right on to the news two
[5306.84s] stock picks for
[5308.159s] 2025 uh in 2024 is only losing sector so
[5311.639s] they&#39;re referring to materials which we
[5313.679s] love they&#39;re talking about da and liond
[5316.36s] Del basil I think those are two worth
[5318.44s] paying attention to uh this is China EV
[5322.239s] sales set to overtake traditional cars
[5325.119s] years ahead of the West that helps albam
[5327.84s] Maro that probably also helps Cooper
[5330.32s] standard has been doing a lot of
[5331.96s] business there uh that&#39;s just about Doge

[5440.92s] these opportunities so just embrace it
[5443.679s] and enjoy it and if you need to go for a
[5445.6s] walk and go play 18 holes uh do it while

[5487.08s] holiday spending clearly on track to
[5488.8s] reach record-breaking Heights even as
[5491.0s] credit card debt strangles Shoppers it&#39;s
[5493.32s] not strangling anyone Katherine dun Ley
[5497.04s] uh The Debt Service as a percentage of
[5499.52s] disposable income is still near
[5502.04s] multi-decade lows but we keep an eye on
[5505.199s] it uh you know debt being at credit card
[5508.6s] debt being at record levels GDP is at
[5510.639s] record levels in case you didn&#39;t get the
[5511.96s] memo so uh hang in there yes you&#39;re
[5515.199s] seeing some strain at dollar store in
[5517.679s] the lower end and that&#39;s just part of
[5519.28s] the thing but those are the people who
[5520.8s] did the best under Trump 1.0 so uh let
[5524.719s] give them a minute to find the coffee
[5526.159s] machine and we&#39;ll be Off to the Races
[5527.76s] China&#39;s record dividend payout
[5529.36s] intensifies pressure on the Yuan it&#39;s
[5531.08s] not the only reason AI boom may be good
[5533.6s] too good to be true this is from Josh
[5535.199s] Harlen over at the Wall Street Journal
[5537.08s] pending copyright infringement lawsuits
[5539.159s] could derail the industry&#39;s economic
[5540.8s] potential why because they&#39;re scraping
[5542.52s] everyone else&#39;s data and not paying for
[5544.159s] it so when they have to pay for it it&#39;s
[5545.88s] going to slow the game down a little bit
[5547.8s] but who&#39;s going to benefit are the
[5549.52s] companies like gxo and Amazon and
[5552.4s] companies that can apply AI in their
[5554.76s] operations and take costs out uh which
[5557.56s] we&#39;re going to talk about in gxo three
[5559.4s] Healthcare stocks to buy for 2025
[5561.679s] rebound so interesting Jacob&#39;s talking
[5564.52s] about M uh materials and Healthcare uh
[5568.76s] and the three stocks he&#39;s talking about
[5571.28s] here CVS human and siga I think uh in
[5575.08s] United Health I think there&#39;s going to
[5576.32s] be ponies in the pile certainly
[5577.84s] Healthcare so he&#39;s talking about am
[5581.199s] genen look he&#39;s got Healthcare right for
[5583.8s] sure how you want to express it is
[5585.679s] another story but love that 2025 FES
[5589.4s] five highest yielding dogs of the Dow
[5591.56s] could explode higher so um we talked
[5595.44s] about this a little last week what is it
[5596.96s] Chevron Verizon Amgen Johnson and
[5600.08s] Johnson MC so here are some healthcare
[5602.96s] stocks that I&#39;ve been be down a lot that
[5604.92s] I I think you&#39;re not going to get hurt
[5606.32s] and you might make a lot of money so
[5607.719s] that&#39;s a good thing to to do uh stock
[5610.239s] bears are going extinct time to
[5613.199s] worry time to time to be alert certainly
[5616.239s] the ones that are blindly pushing into
[5618.52s] indices and into concentrated areas that
[5621.44s] I think are going to get some air L out
[5623.04s] of the balloon why the Dow had such a
[5625.32s] miserable index in uh miserable December
[5628.04s] versus other
[5630.159s] indexes
[5631.679s] uh yeah we covered that
[5634.4s] um you can read the article for the why
[5636.679s] Eli Lily rates in dollar drug trial
[5639.84s] results could shake up Pharma stocks in
[5641.76s] 2025 watch Eli Lily fiser and more I
[5643.88s] think fiser you got to pay attention to
[5645.4s] at these levels uh certainly dividend
[5647.6s] yield is good too US dollar is writing a
[5650.159s] high Trump could put an end to all that
[5652.679s] this is from foreign exchange veteran
[5655.4s] caric sh San Caron we agree with carck

[5681.8s] Chinese eveve makers byd Neo and Lee uh
[5685.48s] end 2024 on a sales
[5688.04s] High here&#39;s Munger the wise ones bet
[5692.239s] heavily when the world offers them that
[5694.239s] opportunity they bet big when they have
[5696.159s] the odds it&#39;s what we&#39;ve spent the last
[5698.119s] hour and 23 minutes talking about the
[5700.159s] odds in
[5701.28s] 2025 they bet big when they have the
[5703.639s] odds and the rest of the time they don&#39;t
[5705.48s] it&#39;s just that
[5707.679s] simple Buffet you don&#39;t have to be
[5709.92s] smarter than the rest we just have to be
[5711.6s] more disciplined with than the rest not
[5714.159s] succumb to the emotional ups and downs
[5717.8s] uh but actually just know what you own
[5720.239s] and do it on low leverage and you just
[5722.56s] wait for the big paydays which come all
[5724.76s] at once you wait you wait you wait and
[5726.96s] then it&#39;s jackpot and then you reinvest
[5729.28s] you wait you wait you wait it&#39;s double
[5731.159s] or triple jackpot you reinvest you wait
[5734.32s] you wait you wait quadruple plus jackpot
[5738.04s] you reinvest etc etc R doio when you
[5740.8s] think that it&#39;s too hard remember that
[5742.32s] in the long run doing things that will
[5744.04s] make you successful is a lot easier than
[5745.96s] being unsuccessful there&#39;s no question
[5748.56s] about that uh article of the week no
[5750.84s] value in value qu that&#39;s a question so
[5754.04s] in a year like 2024 it&#39;s easy to forget
[5756.199s] the fact that since 1927 value has
[5758.159s] outperformed growth by 4.4% per year we
[5761.28s] covered this chart we covered most of
[5763.44s] these so we don&#39;t have to go through
[5764.639s] them again International as
[5766.92s] well covered the TV spots so that&#39;s all
[5769.8s] good and we can get right down to
[5771.119s] business with gxo Logistics
[5773.679s] update uh they had the rumor where they
[5776.32s] were going to be sold stock shot up to
[5779.28s] uh from 46 to 63 and then it wasn&#39;t
[5782.36s] going to be sold and it and
[5784.159s] shot down to 40 now 41 now it&#39;s
[5788.28s] 43 but as you can see the free cash flow
[5791.92s] is steady and solid revenues continue to
[5794.32s] grow they had record re revenues record
[5796.239s] eida good organic growth um and uh price
[5801.679s] Target upgrade by Oppenheimer to $67
[5804.719s] it&#39;s trading at $43 that&#39;s a 12mon price
[5807.56s] Target and that&#39;s after the news about
[5810.119s] the um CMA going to level two with
[5814.52s] regard to the winon
[5817.28s] acquisition uh there two overhangs on
[5819.44s] the stock ladies and gentlemen so you
[5820.92s] don&#39;t have to analyze the logistics
[5822.36s] business because they own it uh what you
[5824.48s] need to analyze is are these two
[5826.6s] overhangs worth a 20% a $20 drop in the
[5830.08s] stock and the answer is no um and I&#39;ll
[5834.159s] tell you why first and foremost this guy
[5838.719s] um um
[5844.119s] is retiring at um
[5848.92s] 65 which is a normal retirement age for
[5851.32s] a public company CEO maybe he could go
[5853.04s] to 6 67 he had a good run and you never
[5856.76s] know why but 65 if he was 55 I&#39;d be a
[5859.44s] little worried uh so now you&#39;ve got this
[5862.04s] whole waight who&#39;s going to be the new
[5863.679s] CEO so you&#39;re going to have an overhang
[5865.28s] on the stock it&#39;s not going to do much
[5866.4s] until they announce who&#39;s the new CEO
[5868.8s] and knowing Brad Jacobs who attracts
[5870.84s] winners he&#39;s going to get a rockstar in
[5873.04s] there the stock will it will be a major
[5875.159s] Catalyst there&#39;s nothing to turn around
[5876.679s] there the Stock&#39;s doing the the
[5878.04s] performance of the business is doing
[5879.48s] great which is why people were uh
[5882.639s] unsolicited
[5884.56s] unsolicited offering tenders to buy the
[5887.04s] company so
[5890.639s] um that&#39;s number
[5893.48s] one number two is the referral of winon
[5898.4s] acquisition to the CMA in the UK after
[5901.639s] the fact so they did the deal last March
[5904.92s] they are waiting to merge the companies
[5907.84s] they&#39;re running side bys side silos
[5910.199s] winon has lower margins than gxo but
[5915.719s] when they start to operate them as one
[5917.92s] unit that&#39;s where they&#39;re going to get
[5919.0s] the synergies and dramatically increase
[5920.84s] the margins of winon which is a great
[5922.52s] business and have an unbelievable
[5924.52s] business in the UK winon is is um is
[5928.28s] concentrated there so you know 3/4
[5931.08s] billion doll deal 735 million pounds and
[5935.679s] so you have to look at what&#39;s the worst
[5938.679s] case scenario the worst case scenario is
[5941.679s] the the CMA which is the UK regulator
[5944.44s] says you can&#39;t do the deal it&#39;s
[5945.92s] anti-competitive and if they were going
[5947.239s] to do that you would think they would do
[5948.88s] it before the acquisition and you think
[5950.679s] the company would be on track now you
[5952.8s] could say maybe this guy completely
[5955.0s] screwed up and that&#39;s why he&#39;s you know
[5956.76s] forced retired and that there certainly
[5958.599s] could be that and that&#39;s what the that&#39;s
[5960.36s] what the stock is saying to you right
[5961.639s] now down $40 down to $40 based on the
[5965.44s] underlying operations the business is
[5966.84s] saying there&#39;s a problem here what if
[5968.56s] winon gets un unround well if Winton
[5970.76s] gets unround Unwound you get your $753
[5974.28s] million back on the balance sheet number
[5976.08s] one you go make another acquisition or
[5978.0s] you invest in uh the business which they
[5980.56s] have a huge High return on operating
[5982.639s] operating return on invested capital of
[5984.679s] 30 plus perc so I don&#39;t mind them having
[5987.48s] 750 million on cash the most likely
[5990.08s] thing and the
[5991.44s] CEO uh discussed it in the earnings call
[5994.679s] which is why uh we we spend so much time
[5998.52s] on the earnings call which we&#39;re going
[5999.679s] to go into now is that it&#39;s very normal
[6002.639s] for these size Acquisitions to go into
[6006.36s] uh phase two with the CMA they require
[6009.199s] details they&#39;re trying to make sure it&#39;s
[6010.76s] not going to be a
[6011.8s] monopoly um look it&#39;s going to be a
[6014.719s] great business and um and I think
[6017.159s] they&#39;ll have to have some concessions
[6020.0s] about uh different things so it doesn&#39;t
[6022.08s] become a monopoly per se uh but they&#39;ll
[6025.639s] do that and it will be a great
[6027.119s] combination and everything will be fine
[6028.76s] it&#39;s just going to delay the synergies
[6030.639s] by a quarter or two uh but the the stock
[6035.44s] price is
[6038.199s] discounting an unwind of the
[6040.76s] deal and um and if there&#39;s no unwind
[6044.76s] which is where the probabilities are
[6047.44s] then you&#39;re going to get a reversion
[6048.56s] back to 50 and then from there you&#39;re
[6050.92s] going to get a CEO maybe 55 and then
[6053.52s] they&#39;re going to continue to perform on
[6054.88s] their 2027 plan and then we think it&#39;s a
[6057.44s] double plus so um again opinion not
[6060.8s] advice go to hedge fund tips click on
[6062.92s] terms it&#39;s right up here boom but um we
[6067.199s] don&#39;t we really don&#39;t get into anything
[6068.679s] unless we think it can be a double over
[6070.119s] a few years so um so that&#39;s that you can
[6074.0s] see the fundamentals continue to perform
[6076.28s] pre- Winton post
[6078.48s] winkon
[6080.119s] uh and they will continue to perform so
[6082.719s] let&#39;s cover some of the key things uh
[6085.159s] the revenue was up 28% year onye 3% of
[6088.92s] that was organic growth the rest was
[6090.56s] acquisitive their sales pipeline
[6092.199s] increased 30% to 2.4 billion they signed
[6096.119s] three4 of a billion dollars of new
[6097.76s] annualized Revenue in the quarter on
[6100.0s] track to win a record level of business
[6101.639s] in 2024 this doesn&#39;t even sound like a
[6104.08s] turnaround but it&#39;s priced like a
[6105.28s] turnaround which we love uh highest ever
[6107.719s] quarterly revenue of 3.2 billion signed
[6110.599s] 226 million of new business seeing
[6113.639s] demand for e-commerce capacity long-term
[6116.0s] structural Tailwind uh key Dr key growth
[6120.4s] driver for us over the past five
[6123.28s] years
[6124.88s] um generated almost $200 million of cash
[6128.239s] flow from
[6129.56s] operations 120 110 million of free cash
[6133.36s] flow and um they&#39;ve got uh five half a
[6138.76s] billion dollars of cash if the deal got
[6140.4s] Unwound they&#39;d have 1.25 billion doll of
[6142.76s] cash
[6144.04s] uh net 2.2 billion of net debt which is
[6148.56s] very reasonable considering the amount
[6150.08s] of free cash flow that they&#39;re
[6151.76s] generating their guidance they
[6153.96s] reaffirmed adjusted eBid of 800 to 835
[6158.239s] million two call it 283 of earnings uh
[6162.92s] $283 of uh of earnings and free cash
[6166.44s] flow conversion of 30 to 40%
[6170.76s] so highlights we covered here are some
[6173.92s] of the recent wins you can recognize
[6175.92s] some of these Brands Orlando LG guest
[6178.44s] L&#39;Oreal Jim shark uh bewd pie I don&#39;t
[6182.48s] know what that is that must be European
[6184.239s] new contract wins and Outsourcing
[6186.199s] underpin long-term growth so they got
[6189.44s] 29% of their new wins from competitors
[6191.76s] 40% from new activity uh from existing
[6194.52s] competitor existing clients and 31% from
[6199.52s] Outsourcing strong cash flow and
[6201.32s] investment grade balance sheet which we
[6205.04s] covered number one Pure Play contract
[6207.599s] Logistics provider 27 countries of
[6210.08s] operation 30% of Fortune F Fortune 100
[6213.4s] companies served $10 billion in 2023
[6216.52s] Revenue that&#39;s going up a lot
[6219.48s] um and so on so
[6222.48s] uh just want to get through some of the
[6224.8s] key things here you can see by region 40
[6228.28s] UK is 41% of their business us is 48 so
[6231.44s] it&#39;s a it is a play on the recovery in
[6234.199s] Europe they&#39;ve got 8% in the Netherlands
[6236.48s] 8% in France 5% in Spain 4% in Italy 6%
[6240.28s] in others so this is a beautiful
[6243.239s] leveraged uh play uh on a niche business
[6246.76s] in a market that we think is going to
[6248.599s] see great recovery in coming years and
[6251.36s] they are going to be the greatest
[6252.8s] beneficiary of that
[6254.679s] recovery um here are some of their other
[6257.239s] Blue Chip customers you can see bear
[6260.719s] guest lvmh Levis Lor Nike Pepsi TJX
[6266.44s] Samsung uh Kell NOA JD
[6270.8s] Heineken Red Bull Versace Boeing by the
[6275.56s] way Boeing they talked about a large US
[6279.199s] Aerospace company which they got huge
[6281.4s] new business so you know it&#39;s it&#39;s just
[6283.639s] an incredible business by 2027 they&#39;re
[6286.159s] going to do 16 billion at Top Line EOB
[6289.639s] about 1.3
[6291.88s] billion uh
[6294.48s] operating return on invested capital of
[6297.44s] 30% and
[6300.119s] um e adjusted EA kager so organic
[6304.48s] Revenue kager 10% so this thing is just
[6307.08s] going to be a machine and you get to
[6309.719s] those type of levels um minimum double
[6312.92s] but then you get multiple reating and
[6314.76s] that&#39;s where you get extra juice that
[6316.04s] you didn&#39;t expect when all the Lemmings
[6318.0s] start to follow in after the double High
[6320.4s] conversion of adjusted iida to free cash
[6322.719s] flow flow to cash flow and you can see
[6326.159s] the waterfall
[6328.52s] there all right let&#39;s get into some of
[6331.92s] the key highlights from the earnings
[6334.52s] call transcript that we haven&#39;t covered
[6337.639s] yet $750 million in new business year-to
[6343.04s] date uh We&#39;ve mentioned that we saw the
[6345.76s] bottom of the inventory cycle in the
[6347.88s] fourth quarter of last year we&#39;ve been
[6349.36s] talking about that for a year and a half
[6352.119s] that that was going to the bottom it
[6353.56s] certainly has proven the dstock restock
[6355.76s] as we head into this year&#39;s Peak we&#39;re
[6357.08s] seeing inventory levels returning to
[6358.639s] normal and demand for e-commerce
[6360.52s] capacity is
[6363.04s] accelerating as commercial activity
[6365.0s] picks up momentum our technology
[6366.599s] differentiation through the deployment
[6369.08s] of Automation and AI is creating a
[6371.76s] multiplier effect in the efficiencies we
[6373.76s] deliver to customers on the back of real
[6375.36s] world results we are proud to have been
[6377.199s] recognized with a supply chain
[6378.679s] Excellence award for our leadership and

[6384.8s] weeks

[6386.73s] [Music]
[6387.88s] um
[6391.239s] Etc uptick in e-commerce
[6395.04s] activity Tech F Logistics exper about a
[6397.92s] third of our new business wins year-to
[6399.4s] date have come from newly outsourced
[6400.84s] business around 40% of our 2.4 billion
[6403.76s] pipeline is made up of customers looking
[6406.4s] to outsourc for the first
[6410.88s] time the acceleration of out sourcing is
[6413.36s] in part a result of the recovery of
[6415.04s] e-commerce and it drives customers to
[6417.119s] look for a partner with scale Automation
[6419.96s] and the ability to manage complexity gxo
[6422.719s] as well position to capture growth from
[6424.88s] these Trends gxo has been piloting our
[6427.4s] first proprietary AI application in
[6429.92s] select warehouses in the US our tool
[6432.28s] streamlines our customers fulfillment
[6433.88s] processes by using machine learning to
[6435.52s] predict SKU demand in the near term the
[6438.4s] sheer volume data volume of data
[6440.679s] analyzed by our tool produces High
[6442.92s] highly accurate forecast of inventory
[6444.96s] flows down to the SKU level these
[6447.56s] insights enable our operation teams to
[6449.84s] optimize the layout of the warehouse and
[6451.96s] match Resources with demand our initial
[6454.239s] Pilots have far exceeded our
[6456.239s] expectations delivering predictive
[6458.44s] accuracy levels above 90% and
[6460.84s] productivity improvements of 3 to 4X in
[6463.92s] stock replenishments which Drive
[6465.96s] increased capacity of 6 to 8% at no
[6468.76s] additional cost we&#39;re thrilled with the
[6470.88s] early success of AI and we&#39;re scared
[6472.84s] scaling it across our footprint AI is
[6475.52s] going to change the way warehouses are
[6477.599s] run over the next few years and our
[6479.719s] leadership in the space is a key driver
[6482.159s] of our long-term profitable growth this
[6484.92s] is the next phase of the AI story ladies
[6486.92s] and gentlemen not the
[6488.88s] people um selling chips it&#39;s the regular
[6493.0s] businesses benefiting and improving
[6494.639s] profitability and productivity from the
[6496.84s] employment of that not a better search
[6499.679s] engine that&#39;s that game is you know that
[6503.0s] happen but that&#39;s not the that&#39;s not the
[6504.84s] key game so
[6507.88s] um very strong player in the Aerospace
[6510.48s] I&#39;m sure Aerospace we going to do
[6512.48s] incredibly well in Europe it&#39;s a huge
[6514.199s] Market very few competitors will be the
[6516.239s] new will be the new kid on the Block and
[6518.599s] I think we&#39;ll do really
[6520.92s] well uh so here this analyst asks in the
[6523.88s] Q&amp;A what about winon and the potential
[6526.48s] malol Wilson the current CEO uh talks
[6529.52s] about win Winton and he says let me
[6531.679s] cover the Winton port
[6536.44s] point and I&#39;ll hand you over to Baris in
[6539.36s] terms of a more detailed aspect on the
[6541.0s] margin so with Winton clearly you know
[6543.599s] we&#39;re reviewing the decisions the phase
[6545.56s] one decisions that came across last
[6547.28s] Friday so we&#39;re reviewing that in detail
[6549.56s] at the moment and clearly as we have on
[6551.96s] other projects we&#39;re going to be
[6553.679s] engaging very constructively and
[6556.28s] collaboratively with the CMA we&#39;re kind
[6559.159s] of remaining pretty confident that we&#39;re
[6561.679s] going to see a positive outcome to it
[6564.639s] it&#39;s possible that we&#39;ll go to phase two
[6566.56s] which they did and you know frankly I
[6568.56s] mean we are prepared for all the
[6570.96s] potential outcomes that this might bring
[6573.36s] and it is not an uncommon environment by
[6575.679s] the way for a deal of this size to go
[6578.8s] into phase
[6585.44s] two okay and then he goes on to talk
[6588.0s] about excluding winon winon we have
[6592.679s] improved our margin every quarter this
[6594.84s] year so you know Winton will be a drag
[6597.84s] until they can merge the operations of
[6600.04s] those or if it&#39;s Unwound margins will
[6602.52s] actually go back up uh when you look at
[6604.88s] winton&#39;s margins they are lower than
[6606.599s] ours at the moment but that is the
[6608.0s] upside in 2025 and onwards then we start
[6611.199s] integrating the business and we capture
[6613.119s] the
[6615.96s] synergies okay not actually uncommon for
[6618.32s] a deal this size to go into what the CMA
[6621.28s] class as a phase two type process it&#39;s a
[6624.44s] much more detailed process which is good
[6627.92s] good not bad and basically we&#39;ll work
[6630.48s] with the CMA to make some clarification
[6632.8s] in terms of the different Market
[6634.119s] verticals that exist in the UK UK is a
[6637.28s] highly competitive environment there&#39;s
[6638.92s] no question about that and as a British
[6641.4s] guy I&#39;m probably well equipped to
[6643.679s] comment on that it is a highly
[6645.679s] competitive environment so Our intention
[6647.8s] is to do some detailed work with the CMA
[6649.92s] teams over the coming months I think
[6652.079s] what that will do do is it will help us
[6654.36s] clarify greatly the situation and as I
[6657.159s] mentioned we&#39;re confident that we&#39;ll
[6659.32s] secure a good satisfactory positive
[6662.159s] outcome through the process one of the
[6665.36s] things that probably it will involve is
[6667.679s] where we had planned to commence
[6669.199s] integration of the two businesses in
[6670.76s] early January I think it&#39;s fair to say
[6673.119s] we might see a delay on that process
[6674.8s] probably stretching out into the
[6676.199s] beginning of the second quarter I don&#39;t
[6678.28s] think beyond that but that&#39;s our
[6679.84s] expectation at the moment because we
[6681.719s] have to respect the CMA they do a really
[6684.44s] good job and it&#39;s quite correct and
[6686.44s] proper that we work with them to seek
[6688.199s] clarification on the points that they&#39;ve
[6692.679s] raised all right so that is the most
[6695.92s] important Lynch pin that and who they&#39;re
[6698.44s] going to
[6700.32s] um name as the new
[6704.679s] CEO and the rest of these amazing
[6707.119s] business developments you can read on
[6708.4s] your own fear and greed is down to 28
[6710.199s] that&#39;s not what you see at tops
[6712.88s] um congratulations to all the new
[6714.92s] clients that came in during our 2024
[6717.04s] raises you could not be better
[6718.639s] positioned for what we believe will be a
[6720.239s] highly rewarding year in 2025 this view
[6723.0s] is based on much of the data we&#39;ve
[6724.159s] shared in recent weeks on our podcast
[6725.599s] videoast as well as our proprietary
[6727.04s] methods of expressing and executing upon
[6729.28s] those details on your behalf we reopened
[6731.4s] to smaller accounts 1 million plus again
[6733.239s] starting last week because we want to be
[6734.76s] fully positioned as soon as possible
[6736.8s] before the inauguration based on some of
[6738.48s] the data we&#39;ve referenced in our recent
[6739.92s] podcast videoast episodes and will&#39;ll
[6741.96s] remain open for for the next couple of
[6743.36s] weeks but no close no later than the
[6745.719s] inauguration congratulations to all of
[6747.44s] you I had the pleasure of speaking with
[6748.719s] and onboarding last week after we opened
[6750.84s] up we expect your applications to be
[6752.719s] approved before the end of this week
[6754.28s] some were approved yesterday that&#39;s why
[6755.599s] we put money to work today uh not
[6757.92s] yesterday but uh earlier in the weekend
[6759.92s] today uh so that we can begin deploying
[6762.199s] Capital immediately to see if you
[6763.599s] qualify that so you can click there all
[6765.56s] this is opinion not advice healthc care
[6767.599s] earnings top 30 weights have been
[6769.239s] revised down one
[6771.199s] 1.30% in the last 60
[6774.28s] days uh financials have been revised up
[6778.679s] 1.17 uh economic data we covered so
[6781.52s] that&#39;s it for the podcast part now we&#39;re
[6783.239s] going to go into the question and answer
[6785.239s] ask me anything questions uh so stick
[6788.28s] around if you like that part if not
[6790.199s] we&#39;ll be back next week same time same
[6793.159s] place uh question one comes from corro
[6798.0s] euronet kro
[6800.44s] fatte uh euronet world wide might be
[6803.719s] worth a deeper look I&#39;m curious what
[6805.44s] your thoughts are
[6818.599s] EFT let&#39;s see here
[6836.52s] what do they
[6852.76s] do payment and transaction process and
[6856.079s] Distribution Solutions for financial
[6858.199s] institutions
[6859.52s] retailers electronic fund transfer
[6861.88s] processes money
[6864.199s] transfer
[6865.719s] uh ATM stuff yeah look uh the numbers
[6869.36s] look great on this
[6872.28s] coros
[6873.46s] [Music]
[6874.679s] um I think it&#39;s definitely worth a look
[6877.239s] we would not be involved in this because
[6878.96s] we already have PayPal exposure we don&#39;t
[6881.32s] want two
[6883.0s] of similar sector necessarily but
[6887.079s] um you just have to understand what is
[6890.48s] their
[6894.079s] durable advantages their MO
[6896.48s] intact and if so
[6900.96s] um you probably have a decent situation
[6905.199s] here take a look at the balance
[6910.96s] sheet yeah I think this is reasonable
[6913.199s] good work uh definitely worth a further
[6915.76s] exploration ior Barry
[6923.4s] are there any single names you would
[6924.48s] Express to the Healthcare through uh
[6926.719s] where you&#39;re expressing through xbi do
[6928.56s] you think any individual names look good
[6929.84s] at the moment uh we like Baxter we own
[6931.92s] Baxter and we own
[6933.639s] xbi um you know we would look at fizer
[6937.36s] we&#39;d look at some others but
[6939.84s] um uh that&#39;s what we own at present
[6942.239s] we&#39;re not going to own six Healthcare
[6943.48s] stocks when you have a portfolio of 10
[6945.119s] 12 companies you generally only do one
[6947.88s] to maximum two per sector and between
[6950.28s] xbi and Baxter we we feel we have enough
[6952.44s] exposure uh at the moment but are
[6954.52s] keeping our mind open on to the next
[6957.28s] Ryan Wang are you how concerned are you
[6960.8s] that gxo acquisition of Winton could get
[6962.84s] blocked by the UK it&#39;s priced in as if
[6964.92s] it&#39;s already been blocked so if anything
[6967.159s] less than blocking happens the stock
[6968.719s] goes up uh so I&#39;m not worried what&#39;s
[6971.76s] your opinion on SLX seems like steel
[6974.079s] sector is ready for a
[6977.079s] bounce let&#39;s see I don&#39;t I generally
[6979.52s] don&#39;t like steel socks they just
[6982.36s] chronically suck I I don&#39;t see what you
[6984.4s] see so I&#39;m a pass even the companies I
[6986.88s] look at like Cliffs and I keep looking
[6989.36s] at them keep doing nothing that they&#39;re
[6991.36s] trading Vehicles they&#39;re not businesses
[6992.96s] you want to own for the long
[6994.52s] term
[6996.04s] um want to get your take on Bill acman
[6998.719s] this is from Jason Zen Bill amman&#39;s
[7001.119s] recent public awareness campaign on the
[7002.76s] asymmetric bet that is Fanny May and
[7004.52s] Freddy Mack on the conservative ship
[7006.52s] being lifted and their stocks
[7007.599s] potentially being a multibagger it&#39;s a
[7009.599s] special situation but not necessarily a
[7011.36s] turnaround would love your color on it
[7013.239s] thanks for all you do and provide Jason
[7015.4s] uh as far as I know he&#39;s owned it since
[7018.639s] uh Trump 1.0 and he was doing the same
[7021.88s] public awareness campaign uh during the
[7024.719s] first Administration and Trump never
[7027.119s] lifted the uh conservatorship so maybe
[7030.159s] he&#39;ll do it this time but if you follow
[7033.679s] that theory last time it was dead money
[7036.719s] evvy this is from Jared Davis
[7050.4s] Evolution
[7062.32s] AB financials look great I got to
[7065.119s] understand the
[7066.199s] business online casino systems to gaming
[7069.52s] operations in Europe I think someone
[7071.76s] else brought brought that up
[7074.76s] um
[7076.48s] this tends to be a
[7079.079s] very yeah I think this is like
[7080.8s] International game Tech in the US I tend
[7082.88s] to not like these because they do great
[7084.76s] until they don&#39;t and then they just blow
[7086.44s] up for no reason because it&#39;s like very
[7088.8s] cyclical it looks perfect now
[7090.92s] financially but
[7093.119s] um you&#39;d have to do a lot of work on it
[7096.159s] and just understand how it&#39;s going to
[7099.28s] out earn the normal cyclicality and the
[7102.56s] unpredictability of that business um all
[7106.44s] right what is your opinion not advice
[7109.239s] check terms on Starbucks and wi we
[7111.159s] covered both of these uh Starbucks was a
[7114.4s] turnaround I think it&#39;s going to
[7115.719s] continue to turn around the issue with
[7118.88s] both of them is there uh for
[7122.679s] us um Starbucks didn&#39;t really get cheap
[7125.719s] enough and I think competition is it&#39;s
[7129.28s] it&#39;s a it&#39;s a China play as is win and
[7132.079s] we have enough China exposure through
[7133.36s] Alibaba so we&#39;re not that
[7136.04s] interested
[7137.04s] [Music]
[7138.4s] um I just don&#39;t I like I think Baba is a
[7142.48s] much easier double than than win or um
[7146.04s] Starbucks at these levels so for that
[7147.92s] reason uh we&#39;re just agnostic good
[7151.48s] businesses they&#39;re going up the question
[7153.679s] is how much uh Tom you crush it on vno
[7157.239s] could you please take a look at HPP
[7159.28s] we&#39;ve looked at HPP a bunch of times
[7161.199s] this is uh a high lever there was a
[7163.56s] little inside buying this week um
[7166.44s] they&#39;re trading like they&#39;re going
[7167.44s] bankrupt and there&#39;s a decent chance
[7168.88s] they might but if they don&#39;t you got a
[7170.239s] $16 stock so on that basis I can&#39;t get
[7173.56s] Comfort I can&#39;t see all their leases I
[7175.88s] can&#39;t understand it uh as clearly as I
[7179.04s] could have understood Vado because I
[7180.679s] don&#39;t know the buildings I don&#39;t know
[7181.96s] the companies that inhabit it but uh you
[7184.92s] know it&#39;s largely mag 7 I think big Tech
[7188.0s] stuff I met one of the directors a
[7189.52s] couple of years ago and uh he was was
[7192.159s] pitching me on it at 15 and now it&#39;s uh
[7194.76s] 286 so I didn&#39;t bite at 15 uh I&#39;m not
[7199.44s] really interested in this one it&#39;s too
[7201.199s] much it&#39;s highrisk high reward but
[7203.199s] there&#39;s too much in the risk part and I
[7205.84s] I don&#39;t need to you know rule number one
[7207.4s] is don&#39;t lose money rule number two is
[7208.96s] don&#39;t forget rule number one I don&#39;t
[7210.8s] care if it takes me three years if I&#39;ve
[7212.28s] got a short thing if if if I&#39;ve got a
[7214.719s] gamble thing for like three up one down
[7217.32s] that&#39;s that&#39;s a Traders game and that&#39;s
[7219.28s] not what we do Sarah Wells ask what&#39;s
[7221.56s] your birth Tom well it isn&#39;t ask me
[7223.76s] anything question anything equals that
[7226.119s] it&#39;s July 22nd thanks for tuning in uh
[7229.44s] Chris Henderson ask can you take a look
[7231.48s] at a line if fits your healthc care
[7233.04s] theme we&#39;ve covered this one a few times
[7235.239s] the financials look great I just don&#39;t
[7237.239s] think there&#39;s a enough I think their
[7238.84s] moat uh has been attacked the stock has
[7241.52s] been dead money for seven eight years
[7246.96s] um
[7248.92s] and I think that um
[7254.32s] that&#39;s why I&#39;ve never gotten involved
[7256.32s] cash flow peaked four years ago
[7258.52s] continues to decline I I don&#39;t like it
[7261.32s] it&#39;s cheap it&#39;s a good business but it
[7263.0s] seems to be deteriorating I think the
[7264.679s] mode has been breached and for that
[7266.679s] reason I&#39;m not that interested even
[7268.84s] though I could be wrong um I don&#39;t have
[7271.32s] fomo Gene I just try to bet on sure
[7273.96s] things as much as I can digital Bridge
[7277.92s] dbrg um
[7286.48s] sector is super
[7289.4s] hot well cash flows are going down along
[7292.199s] with the price let&#39;s see
[7310.079s] dbrg digital infrastructure
[7312.52s] rure data center s ah I hate buying
[7317.599s] flavor of the weak
[7320.32s] stuff I had an another guy played golf
[7323.239s] with this week pitch me on another one
[7324.56s] of these things and
[7328.199s] like not not my not my thing let&#39;s just
[7331.92s] see what the financials are doing anyway
[7343.719s] my guess is it&#39;ll be like the other one
[7345.719s] where management keeps deluding
[7348.639s] everyone yeah share counts gone from 118
[7351.56s] million up to 160 in about two years so
[7355.159s] these are scumbags by the way this is
[7357.119s] what a scumbag management looks like it
[7359.239s] just keeps deteriorating because they
[7360.599s] keep deluding raising Capital paying
[7362.44s] themselves big money not interested
[7364.8s] don&#39;t like promoter don&#39;t like that
[7367.159s] whole thing Philip Andrew pinkos thought
[7371.96s] on
[7373.48s] ambev
[7376.639s] uh I think I&#39;d rather
[7379.76s] do I mean this is another one that&#39;s
[7381.88s] been dead money for 10 years so you
[7383.28s] can&#39;t even blame it on covid and
[7385.32s] gp1s I know it&#39;s probably got a high
[7387.8s] dividend yield and everything I it it&#39;s
[7389.76s] not for me this thing is
[7392.44s] uh I&#39;d rather buy diio best-in class
[7396.36s] deal with the Tariff risk uh or even
[7398.96s] Brown foreman and deal with the higher
[7402.4s] um margin
[7404.36s] Spirits
[7406.44s] um there&#39;s nothing not to love about the
[7409.119s] financials of this business but it just
[7410.639s] does nothing so I think the other way to
[7413.679s] think about this one
[7418.92s] is this would be a good play on
[7423.32s] the a good Brazil play let me see what
[7426.119s] the balance sheet looks like
[7437.96s] I can accept two or three years of dead
[7439.599s] money for one or two positions out of
[7441.52s] you know 10 to 12 I can&#39;t accept 10
[7443.76s] years uh I know Munger did it on um byd
[7447.44s] and then got a 10 or 20 bagger in a year
[7450.0s] but
[7451.36s] uh let&#39;s see tons of
[7457.239s] cash not a lot of
[7459.4s] debt uh look I
[7470.44s] I can&#39;t find anything wrong with it my
[7471.96s] man but
[7476.079s] um see what they&#39;re doing in the share
[7485.36s] count pretty static
[7492.119s] what is this a 5% dividend
[7503.0s] yield yeah
[7505.719s] 5.75 uh so this is like an anity 80 85%
[7509.48s] payout ratio so it just exists for the
[7511.44s] purpose of the
[7516.559s] dividend uh
[7518.48s] look I have nothing wrong with it
[7524.96s] um I just don&#39;t see an imminent Catalyst
[7528.0s] for this thing to be a beast so
[7538.92s] um all right next guy is Brian
[7542.56s] [Music]
[7547.48s] mlan Mattel
[7559.559s] okay Brian wants to be a client by the
[7561.96s] time he&#39;s 40 you will be if you learn
[7563.599s] the process uh let&#39;s see
[7569.84s] metel uh Mattel is just you
[7574.239s] know my kids don&#39;t even have toys
[7576.599s] everything&#39;s on the iPad so yeah they&#39;re
[7578.159s] moving into the entertainment business
[7579.679s] and all that stuff I I just don&#39;t like
[7581.36s] this business it it it just chronically
[7583.679s] sucks I mean if you&#39;re going to buy one
[7585.079s] of the toy companies you buy
[7586.96s] Hasbro
[7588.48s] but um they&#39;re just I I wouldn&#39;t want to
[7591.639s] buy it here they&#39;re just trading
[7592.92s] vehicles I I I don&#39;t like them I like
[7595.0s] them as much as I like mining stocks uh
[7597.36s] thoughts on oxy we cover this every
[7600.079s] single week because Buffett buys five
[7601.92s] more shares everyone wants to buy it uh
[7604.639s] you know he he bought it here okay he
[7608.36s] bought it at the end of 2019 he got a
[7610.36s] warrant deal because has to get help
[7612.04s] them Finance this this thing then the
[7614.239s] stock collapsed 90% so he&#39;s been buying
[7618.32s] it they&#39;re going to be less energy
[7620.679s] companies they&#39;re going to consolidate
[7622.199s] so he&#39;s benef he&#39;s betting on
[7626.36s] the consolidation he also had a ton of
[7628.96s] warrants that he&#39;s exercising which
[7630.52s] confuses everyone as to whether they&#39;re
[7632.199s] real buys or not
[7635.48s] um it&#39;s okay I look if go back to the
[7640.199s] podcast in 2020 and we were jumping
[7643.88s] around like a hyena like we are about
[7645.44s] some of the stock the China stocks now
[7648.04s] uh you know when we were buying Exxon
[7650.239s] Mobile in the low3s and uh Wells Fargo
[7653.48s] at 25 we buy down here I up here there&#39;s
[7656.48s] no asymmetry like it&#39;s not going to 150
[7658.76s] in a week so if you want something
[7660.599s] that&#39;s a little better than a bond
[7661.8s] that&#39;s going to pay a dividend and it
[7663.239s] might double in five years great uh I
[7667.04s] think there&#39;s that&#39;s what I&#39;m not seeing
[7669.28s] in energy which is why I&#39;m not getting
[7670.76s] excited which is why we&#39;re in Slumber J
[7672.559s] not Slumber J com stock which we&#39;ve
[7674.52s] already gotten more than a double and
[7676.599s] it&#39;s going to we&#39;re probably going to
[7677.599s] get another multibagger from that uh
[7680.76s] because there&#39;s asymmetry I&#39;m not seeing
[7682.8s] that in a lot of these energy stocks
[7684.36s] like we saw it in 2020 when we were
[7686.28s] jumping up like a hyena buy everything
[7688.079s] when oil went negative so for me it&#39;s a
[7690.599s] pass it&#39;s just it&#39;s just blah um Jay apt
[7694.84s] please take a look at carvana no
[7697.04s] interest I mean this is this is a this
[7700.8s] is
[7703.04s] so they&#39;re interested because it had a
[7704.559s] monster pullback of 15% the thing&#39;s up
[7707.28s] from $3 to $268 and now you want to buy
[7710.4s] it hard pass I mean they&#39;ve got a nice
[7714.079s] niche business it&#39;s probably okay it&#39;s
[7716.119s] not doubling from here anytime soon so
[7718.96s] for me it&#39;s a big pass Zara Bassam
[7723.88s] pgny uh let&#39;s take a look at that Zara
[7731.92s] oh that&#39;s interesting let&#39;s take a look
[7734.04s] I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be some type
[7735.76s] of Biotech which I&#39;m going to say I have
[7737.719s] no Edge but it does look like it&#39;s ready
[7739.96s] to rock and roll uh benefits management
[7742.96s] fertility and family building
[7746.559s] benefits this is a biotech which I have
[7748.92s] no Edge on uh so there&#39;s probably not
[7752.559s] going to be any value in doing financial
[7755.119s] analysis let&#39;s just see how long they&#39;re
[7756.559s] going to stay solvent for before they
[7758.119s] have the miracle breakthrough they
[7760.159s] raised 371 million of cash and they got
[7763.599s] no debt so they&#39;re going to live another
[7765.599s] day how much did they dilute the owners
[7767.92s] with that
[7768.92s] raise uh they took the Share account
[7773.239s] from 5.7 million shares to 100 million
[7779.48s] shares good no not in no no than I mean
[7784.559s] the problem is is when you get this
[7786.44s] thing up to $25 they&#39;re going to raise
[7789.04s] another $400 500 million in dump it on
[7791.76s] your head and drive it back down to two
[7793.4s] I I hate promotes like this I think it&#39;s
[7797.92s] it looks like it wants to work but let&#39;s
[7800.48s] just see if they have any Revenue this
[7801.84s] is the speculative stuff that gets
[7804.159s] people in a lot of
[7805.84s] trouble and sometimes they get lucky the
[7809.0s] worst part about it is they get lucky
[7811.599s] and then they take all of it and they go
[7813.44s] into another one thinking that their
[7814.88s] Luck&#39;s going to continue and they always
[7816.36s] give it back to the casino
[7820.119s] um all all right so they have revenues
[7822.52s] growing do they have any cash
[7836.559s] flow yeah it&#39;s starting to generate cash
[7839.679s] all right look
[7842.36s] um what can I tell you Zara I
[7846.44s] mean you really better understand the
[7849.04s] damn product and understand what is the
[7851.32s] mode is there a patent on it is there
[7853.8s] does it
[7855.96s] uh what does it who who does it compete
[7858.599s] with who can knock them off can generics
[7860.96s] you know do a bio similar fertility and
[7864.48s] family building benefit solution
[7865.92s] fertility solution includes different
[7867.76s] benefits plan
[7870.079s] design coner member Styles
[7873.559s] support
[7876.199s] uh yeah so in 2015 they changed their
[7879.48s] name so it probably went bankrupt
[7881.96s] and then they raise new money and
[7883.4s] they&#39;re back in it looks like it wants
[7885.4s] to go
[7888.28s] but this is a trade you got to
[7891.159s] understand the product it&#39;s not what we
[7892.32s] do I&#39;m looking at it it&#39;s like it&#39;s
[7894.119s] interesting but I just know they&#39;re
[7895.239s] going to dump another hundred million
[7897.48s] 100 million shares on your head the
[7899.04s] minute this thing goes to 20 because
[7901.119s] that&#39;s what these type of guys do
[7903.84s] so uh Aaron Seth thoughts on xmag S&amp;P
[7908.96s] 500 excluding the Magnificent seven yeah
[7912.079s] why
[7914.36s] not
[7915.88s] um a
[7926.28s] iot
[7929.28s] iot so it&#39;s gone from one to $6 no no no
[7934.52s] give me these things before they take
[7935.96s] off not after they just had
[7938.119s] multi-baggers a IO t power Fleet what do
[7943.0s] they
[7945.04s] do itive free no I&#39;m not interested uh I
[7948.8s] like your first one though Chris
[7950.119s] Patterson thank you for all your book
[7951.96s] recommendations over the year can you
[7953.28s] take a look at selones I like selones
[7955.679s] it&#39;s one of these materials companies
[7957.48s] that is uh beaten
[7969.0s] down haven&#39;t done anything with it yet
[7972.84s] don&#39;t know if I have space to do
[7974.079s] anything with it yet but I think over
[7975.639s] the next few years it&#39;ll be okay and I
[7978.4s] think it&#39;s interesting um on to the next
[7982.28s] and we&#39;ve covered that a few times Chris
[7984.559s] Tim
[7985.8s] oconnell celus Holdings we&#39;ve covered
[7988.88s] that a million times I think it&#39;s
[7990.639s] probably okay there&#39;s some legal issue
[7992.88s] you got to get comfortable with but um
[7996.639s] probably okay at these levels Jimmy
[7999.159s] Jones thoughts on investing in
[8002.639s] Brazil uh when do you think it should
[8004.76s] when when Lula dies and he falls down
[8006.44s] the stairs again and they get a
[8007.679s] conservative in uh it&#39;s going to go
[8009.679s] Bonkers but it&#39;s not there yet but
[8015.04s] um yeah it&#39;s like waiting for Gau I I
[8017.92s] just don&#39;t see any real asymmetry
[8020.44s] without massive risk in Brazil I think
[8022.32s] China&#39;s the better play right now but um
[8026.239s] yeah I think China&#39;s going to I think
[8027.44s] Brazil is going to work over the next
[8028.559s] few years as well uh with that said want
[8031.199s] to thank everyone for tuning in we&#39;ll be
[8032.599s] back next week same time same place in
[8034.4s] the meantime make it a great one bye for
[8036.239s] now
