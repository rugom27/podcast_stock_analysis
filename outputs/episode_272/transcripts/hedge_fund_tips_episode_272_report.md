**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Value stocks are historically undervalued compared to growth stocks.
- Expected earnings growth in healthcare and materials sectors.
- Anticipated rotation out of the overvalued Magnificent 7.
- Strong economic outlook for the next 5-6 years.
- Demographic tailwinds with 12,000 people turning 35 every day in the US.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The macro thesis revolves around a rotation from growth to value, driven by the end of the zero-interest-rate policy and a shift towards more normalized economic cycles. Hayes anticipates a weaker dollar, rising international equity performance, and a continued bull market with opportunities in undervalued sectors like healthcare and materials. He believes that the market is underestimating the potential for small-cap earnings growth and the benefits of AI implementation in various industries.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Value vs Growth Outperformance | 4.4% per year since 1927 | Value outperforms growth over the long term, and we are at the beginning of a generational opportunity for value investing. |
| Small Cap Earnings Growth | 57% for Russell 2000 | Small caps offer significantly higher earnings growth potential compared to the S&P 500, making them attractive investments. |
| US GDP Growth | 2.4% expected in 2025 | Solid GDP growth supports a continued bull market and reduces the likelihood of a recession. |
| JGB Yields | Rising | Rising JGB yields will cause an unwind of the carry trade, negatively impacting the Magnificent 7. |

## Featured Company Deep Dives
### GXO – High Conviction
GXO Logistics is a pure-play contract logistics provider poised for significant growth due to the e-commerce boom, outsourcing trends, and AI implementation. The stock is undervalued due to two temporary overhangs: the CEO's retirement and the CMA's review of the Winton acquisition. Hayes believes these overhangs are overblown, presenting a buying opportunity.

**Key Metrics:**
- Revenue up 28% year-over-year
- Sales pipeline increased 30% to $2.4 billion
- Operating return on invested capital of 30%
- AI implementation leading to 3-4x productivity improvements

**Valuation / Target:** $67 price target by Oppenheimer, potential to double
**Action:** Buy
