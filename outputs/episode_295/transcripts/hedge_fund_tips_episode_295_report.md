# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode 295
### June 7, 2024

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish, predicting new market highs by mid-summer, driven by low earnings expectations, trap bears, and a constructive trade deal with China. He advocates for aggressive investment in small caps, housing-related stocks, and specific turnaround stories like Albemarle, QXO, Stanley Black & Decker, and Generac. He criticizes the Fed's overly restrictive monetary policy and highlights opportunities in emerging markets and Chinese equities, particularly Alibaba.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Extremely Bullish → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Q2 earnings expectations are set low, paving the way for positive surprises.
- Trap bears who sold early will be forced to buy back in, driving prices higher.
- Constructive trade deal with China boosts earnings expectations and CEO confidence.
- The Fed is likely to cut rates, further fueling market growth.
- Small caps are poised for significant outperformance.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The macro thesis revolves around several key factors: the imminent reduction of capital requirements by Bessent which will create enormous demand for treasuries, the potential approval of stable coins which will create trillions in demand for treasuries, the Fed cutting rates due to low inflation and a weakening job market, a weakening dollar benefiting emerging markets, and the resurgence of Chinese equities due to easing trade tensions and strong earnings growth.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| May Consumer Inflation Report | Prices up only 0.1% | This supports the argument for the Fed to lower interest rates. 'We are 150 basis points too restrictive.' |
| Q2 Earnings Expectations | Reduced from 9.3% to 6% | Sets a low bar for companies to beat, driving market optimism. |
| 10-Year Treasury Yield | Down to 4.36% | Moving in line with the housing theme, benefiting our positioning. |
| Russell 2000 Earnings Growth | Projected 23% this year, 37% in 2026 | Small caps offer significantly higher earnings growth at half the multiple of large caps. |
| China Tech Earnings Growth | 15% | Significantly higher than US earnings growth, indicating a shift in global equity performance. |

## Risks & Contrarian Flags
- ⚠️ The Fed may not cut rates as aggressively as expected, hindering the housing recovery.
- ⚠️ The trade deal with China could fall apart, negatively impacting Chinese equities.
- ⚠️ The stable coin market may not grow as rapidly as anticipated, limiting demand for treasuries.
- ⚠️ Housing supply may surge, causing prices to decline despite lower rates.

## Technical Takeaways
The market is showing signs of being overbought in the short term, but the underlying trend remains strongly bullish. Any pullbacks should be viewed as buying opportunities, particularly in small caps and housing-related stocks. The high level of short interest in the S&P 500 suggests a potential melt-up is likely.
