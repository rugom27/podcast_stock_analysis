Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 2005th videocast podcast for the week ending June 12th, 2025. We got a lot to cover today, but as always, family first, then we&#39;ll get down to business. Uh that&#39;s Annabelle there. She set a new Nova Aquatics 9 to10 girls team record in the 400 meter freestyle with a time of 44204. She beat her previous record by 8 seconds at age 10. Ranks top 10 in the nation for 12 year olds in both the 200 IM and the 400 free. Great job on that, Annabelle. Moving along. Uh this was Oh, this was the Newport Beach TV Fest this weekend.

She turn she&#39;s turning 13 this month at Great Wolf Lodge, which uh oddly I was very much looking forward to because I think after 13 there aren&#39;t going to be too many more trips to Great Wolf Lodge. So, we stayed an extra day and went down the crazy slides. Uh there&#39;s Caitlyn, Annabelle, Mimi having a fun day. Uh got to meet uh uh client Jake W. Thank you so much for coming in from Canada.

And uh obviously thanks uh Mark, you know who you are, for for hosting me uh for an incredible uh 18 holes at your beautiful club this week. And that is that. Let&#39;s get down to business, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, first one is I want to thank Christian Dagger and Stuart Vney for having me on Fox Business yesterday to discuss general market outlook, etc. So, we&#39;re going to listen in here. The markets still plenty of green out there, but not that much. The Dow&#39;s up 30, NASDAQ&#39;s up 34. Tom Hayes joins me now. He&#39;s looking at the markets for us. You think the markets will go higher, make new highs this summer? Well, Stu, I got good news for you. We are going to push to new highs. And all that means is we&#39;re catching up with the rest of the world. Many indices around the world have hit new highs. That means we could push over 6150 by midsummer before we get to the normal fall uh volatility and chop. And and the reason is uh a couple things. First off, the bar is set very low for earnings for Q2. They&#39;ve taken it down from 9.3% at the end of March uh to just 6% right now. We did the exact same thing in Q1. We beat expectations. They were expected to grow 6%. They grew 13%. That&#39;s a good thing. Then you got all the trap bears who sold in the hole. They didn&#39;t believe that Trump would pull this off. Well, we just got the biggest deal announced today with China. So, this is a very constructive thing for earnings, for expectation, and for guidance. Remember, guidance was very cautious in Q1. I think CEOs are going to get a lot more confidence now they know the rules of the road moving forward. Uh we just got the uh couple of hours ago we got the May consumer inflation report. Prices up only 0.1% in the month of May. Should the Fed lower interest rates? I think President Trump is correct. We are going to have a situation of too late Powell. They claim that they are data dependent. They are prediction dependent. They are predicting that prices will go up from tariffs. Now we know what tariffs are. It&#39;s simply not going to be the case. We saw it in 2018. And President Trump is calling for a one percentage point cut. We&#39;re actually 150 basis points too restrictive, meaning the Fed funds rate above the rate of inflation. This is the fourth consecutive month in a row inflation has come in below expectations. It&#39;s time to start cutting. There&#39;s a 68% chance. It went up this morning of the first cut in September. That probably needs to move up to 80%. They should do 25 basis points in June. They won&#39;t do it because they&#39;re in the prediction business, not the data business. They should be in the data business do, but it&#39;s all going to be okay. The economy is strong. If they did do it, the market would be very happy to see that a cut in rates in June and July. Uh Tom Hayes, thanks for joining us. See you again soon. Thanks for having me. Still ahead, Trump&#39;s and we&#39;re back. And then on Friday, I had the pleasure to join Nicole Pedalites on Schwab Network. Want to thank old friend Alli Thompson for putting me on. We covered a lot. Covered three or four names in this and a key theme going into the second half. So, we&#39;ll listen in here. Welcome back to the watch list. Our next guest, Thomas J. Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital joins me. actually has some stock picks for your portfolio as well. What did you think of the week that was? I do want to talk about some of the earnings that you had on your radar for different reasons, but how do you think markets behaving? Yeah, I think this market wants to push higher, Nicole. I I think you have still a lot of trap bears who sold at the exact wrong time in the beginning of April. Over a trillion dollars of hedge fund and CTA money got flushed the day before Trump put out his tweet. now is a good time to buy. So, every bit of good news, and we&#39;ve had good news, 13.3% earnings growth for the quarter with 98% of the companies that had reported. Uh, that&#39;s that&#39;s up instead of expectations. We&#39;re at 6%. And we&#39;re going into the next quarter with reasonable expectations. So, I think on balance, this market wants to push higher. The jobs report uh was interesting considering the beige book talked about a slowdown in uh labor demand and a slowing in the economy. Uh I think that kind of surprised the market to the upside to see some strength. But the trend is down. The Fed will still be in the market cutting at the back half of the year. Right now it just seems unclear whether it&#39;s going to be one cut or two cut. You still have a 63% chance of one cut in September. So I think a lot of lot of good stuff and a lot of powder on the sidelines. So as this thing pushes higher, people are going to be forced in and particularly those who sold low, missed the recovery and now have to chase uh to to save their careers. Understood. Um yeah, if you sold in April, you were not happy today. That&#39;s true. At the bottom, right, you only lose money until you actually sell. You have a few names like Lululemon and Broadcom on your radar as far as earnings. What story do they tell? Well, Lulu, uh, I think the surprise there was that they were blaming the economy, saying that US consumers are being cautious and intentional. Uh, that&#39;s, uh, that seems a little suspicious in the sense that, uh, you&#39;re seeing a tremendous amount of competition from Aloe, from Athleta, from other companies coming to bear. So, they&#39;re blaming the economy, they&#39;re blaming the consumer. Their com store sales were up 1% year-on-year, which was a little bit anemic. And they brought their guidance midpoint down from, you know, $155 of earnings this year down to$,468. So, the market didn&#39;t like it. It flushed it down 20%. This is a high quality business, but the concern is that they&#39;re they&#39;re now saying they&#39;re going to raise prices due to the tariffs and that&#39;s going to impact their margins by 110 basis points for the full year. So declining margins, slow comps uh yearon year and the market just completely flushed it out. As it relates to Avago, uh yeah, they beat as well, but uh the guidance was less than uh very high expectations and it was a sell the news event. It had rallied 30% into into the print. So people took some profits. Uh the AI related business was up 46%. The non AI related business was a little bit anemic. People were a little bit concerned about that. Uh free cash flow still strong, buyback still strong, but the stock taking a breather. Yeah, understood. So right now if I look at AVGO, Broadcom, uh it is trading down about 4%. But has been a winner. One year up 87% and just in one month up 22%. You have names that you like. Alber Marorrow, QXO, Stanley Black &amp; Decker, and also Generrack. Um, is there a theme between these picks or are they uh each have their own story? Well, I&#39;m known as turnaround Tom, so I like I like businesses that are out of favor that are going going to recover. Uh, materials is expected to have the second highest earnings growth in 2026. We want to get positioned ahead of time. They&#39;re going to have 17% earnings growth. Albamaro big player number one uh top lithium producer in the world lowest cost producer some of their mines in Chile uh and uh and lithium is a very cyclical business you see it throughout the years even before EVs they have ample liquidity to make it through the over supply in the short term which we expect to rebalance in mid 2026 the operating leverage in this business is second to none once lithium rebalances as the smaller players shut down production Albamaro is going to be the big winner and as we&#39;re going to see demand from 1.2 million metric tons last year to 3.2 million 5 years out uh they&#39;re going to win. The whole EV story is all China. It&#39;s an unnatural subsidized government market uh in EVs. There&#39;s 60% of global EVs. That is not going to stop anytime soon. The Chinese government&#39;s going to keep pushing EV, which is going to benefit Albamaro as their competition goes out of business. They&#39;ll be last man standing, and they&#39;re going to mint money like it&#39;s going out of style. This stock uh is down huge. It can be up double to triple over the next 3 to four years. Uh we think this is a huge out of favor cyclical opportunity that this happens every 5 to 8 years and we are buying it at the trough. uh as it relates to housing also out of favor. Why? Because of higher rates. Rates are going to come down. Why? Bessent is focused on the SLR. He&#39;s going to reduce capital requirements uh which will create an enormous amount of demand by banks for treasuries. Uh they&#39;ll be back in the market in a big way. And then you have the Genius and he said that&#39;ll lower 10-year yields which is what mortgage rates are based on by anywhere from 30 to 70 basis points. Then you have the Genius Act. Stable coins could be approved where you&#39;re going to see right now the market for stable coins which are backed by US treasuries is about 250 billion. that could go up to 2 trillion over time, creating 2 trillion of new demand for treasuries, which will bring yields down on top of it. So, uh, so that&#39;s going to be very positive because mortgage rates are priced off the 10 years. So, I think the second half you&#39;re going to see a 30-year fixed mortgage. You can you can time stamp this. We&#39;re going to see a 30-year fixed mortgage below 6% before the end of the year. And animal spirits are going to be back. new housing starts, the federal lands are opening up from this administration. It&#39;s going to create a lot of land, believe it or not, in metropolitan areas uh to uh bridge the 3 to four million unit housing der uh in the US and the huge demand from millennials. So, how do we play it? We don&#39;t want to play the waring factions. We don&#39;t want to play the homebuilders that are going to be producing and race to the bottom as their margins contract as they fight each other on price. We want to take advantage of the arms dealers uh like QXO which is Brad Jacobs company. It&#39;s a building supply rollup. They started with Beacon Roofing. He paid 11 times IBIDA. He&#39;s going to double IBIDA over the next uh uh couple of years through implementing technology like he always does. Do a roll up. If you follow what he did in XBO Logistics, you made 50ome times your money. If you follow what he did in United Rentals, you made 70 times your money. I think this is going to be a five or six bagger over the next five to seven years. Uh even from these levels and even today, Wolf Research was out upgrading the stock. It&#39;s whatever it is, 178 bucks up to $44. Uh we think that&#39;s a little premature, but it&#39;s definitely going to get there and more over the next few years. Then you got Stanley Black &amp; Decker. If you&#39;re going to build houses, you need tools, Craftsman, Stanley, DeWalt, etc. They have been uh recovering margins after the COVID overstock. They&#39;ve detocked. Now they&#39;re restocking, increasing margins. The last time they got margins up to the level that uh management is guiding by 2027. They earned $8 a share in earnings. The stock traded north of 150. Right now, I think it&#39;s trading at $65. So, there&#39;s huge upside over the next three years. And then finally, is Generrack way to play the housing recovery. also interest rate sensitive because a lot of people uh finance uh home standby generators. They&#39;ve got 75% of the market. They are going to fly. Uh this stock is still down 75% even though it&#39;s generating record free cash flow. Revenues are recovering. Their commercial and industrial business is improving. They&#39;re going to be a lot of backup energy and storage for data centers. That&#39;s going to be a monstrous business in addition to the home standby and we&#39;re entering hurricane season. So, uh, other than that, how was the play, Mrs. Lincoln? We&#39;ve got a lot of stuff here for you, Nicole. All right. You really do. And turnaround, Tom. That&#39;s a good nickname. And it&#39;s t would fun taking a look at those key names, too, of Albert Marl, QXO, Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Generrack, and more. Thank you, Thomas J. Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Thank you, Tom. Coming up, And we&#39;re back. Uh then I want to thank my oldtime friend who gave me my first break on TV, Ellie Terret. She was a producer, NYC floor producer for the Clayman Countdown, put me on for the first time in uh 2019. Now she is the crypto cat queen. She always posts pictures of all of the um cats she saves. and she is doing an incredible podcast, Crypto in America. She hosts all the major crypto events. She is the go-to in that space. And she quoted me in her article on stable coins this week. Uh you can follow Ellie on Twitter. Uh if you don&#39;t already do it, if you have any interests in crypto or digital assets, uh she is the follow. Just put in Eleanor Terret Tet. It&#39;ll come up. Uh then finally want to thank Sam Clark and Hannah Mulain for having me on uh the BBC World Business Report with Rohan. It was more general questions about Elon Musk and about Disney&#39;s lawsuit against the AI company uh and such. So there&#39;s nothing really actionable. So you can listen to that on your own if you want to hear me talk general news. Have at it. And then uh quotes of the week, Warren Buffett. Whether we&#39;re talking about socks or stocks, I like buying quality merchandise when it&#39;s marked down. No question that&#39;s what we do here every week on Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. Uh, also Buffett says, &quot;We enjoy the process far more than the proceeds. If I remembered that as much in golf as I did in investing, I&#39;d be a lot more successful in golf. Uh, but uh, it comes and goes. I I had a a tough round this week, but uh coming off a couple weeks that were a bit stronger. So, we&#39;ll see. I think all the pieces are there. We got to just get that break in 80 done. I know those of you who&#39;ve been following along the trying to do that for about a year. Let&#39;s see if I can get it done this summer. Uh Rob, are not in investing. What&#39;s comfortable is rarely profitable. So, we&#39;re going to talk about some of that this week. Also want to acknowledge um a lot of you had asked for merch for hedge fund tips, the super fans who have been with us for six months, a year, two years, three years, four years. Uh and the response has been overwhelming. Thank you for the orders. Uh a little bit more koi with the photos. So when uh people do send in photos, we want to acknowledge them and you can see them right here when you click on uh number one hedge fund podcast. Also, while you&#39;re there, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult your financial adviser before doing doing anything. Uh, and a couple new ones we haven&#39;t covered. John Martin, uh, great picture with his mug right there. Love it. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. Uh, and, um, and I think we covered, uh, Mike last week in front of the Van Store and a lot of great others over the over the past weeks. So, uh, wanted to cover uh, data. Now, QXO, a lot of companies have been coming out. We&#39;ve been pounding the table. Did we get it? We didn&#39;t get in on the private deal at eight or nine bucks, but we did get in at 13 bucks uh a while back. People were very skeptical because we paid a premium to cash. Now it&#39;s uh almost getting close to a uh well, not a double yet, but it&#39;s uh uh up 65% in the last two months. Uh now, uh Beard was out. Wolf Wolf came out and upgraded it to $44 a share. Uh it&#39;s currently just over 20. Now be bar came out at $32 a share for all the reasons that we&#39;ve been saying for months uh and both when it was at 13 then it went down to 11 against us going back to Mr. R not what is comfortable is rarely profitable. So, you say, &quot;Well, what&#39;s the big deal? You bought it at 13, it went to 11, but now it&#39;s over 20.&quot; Uh, and it&#39;s going to 100, by the way, over the next handful of years. But, um, uh, most people aren&#39;t willing to do that. You know, they they don&#39;t they don&#39;t know what they own, so they set their 8% stop-loss and they miss all the multibaggers, guaranteed. So, uh, so that&#39;s that. And then, um, let&#39;s go to some of the sloomer slides from RBC. By the way, the 10-year yield today, I think, was down to 436. So, it&#39;s moving in the direction we&#39;ve been talking about in line with the housing theme, which we&#39;re going to spend more in the article of the week. So, uh this is just a couple days old. It&#39;s already stale. 479 to uh 436 or something and change. I just looked at it and uh and that&#39;s going to help a lot of our positioning and what we&#39;re set up for. Here&#39;s the all-time highs, 6147. And as I said with Vanney, we are going to likely exceed those before the end of the summer. If we take a couple week break here, a little chop in the meantime, don&#39;t lose sleep over it. There are so many trap bears that&#39;s going to force this thing up to new highs. And then in the fall, maybe we&#39;ll get a little chop. But for now, uh, when the when the music is playing, get up and dance. And we&#39;ve been certainly dancing this quarter like nobody&#39;s business. And been super happy about that. And kudos to all of you who came in when we said to come in and all the existing who said to who added money when we had to add when we told you to add money uh which was the first time in two years that we said add money now. And I will say uh as much as you look at the portfolio and see all your positions up uh and smile so wide you could eat a banana sideways year to date uh and certainly and quarter to date. um uh go through each of the names and you&#39;ll just see how much more opportunity is yet to come. It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s literally just getting started. So, um all right. So, that&#39;s more on the S&amp;P small caps. This is going to be the next money big money maker. Already made a big move off the bottom. This is also going to break to new highs. And then once it does, you&#39;re going to get yourself a measured move, which would be another 800 points to 3,200 on the minimum. This is now where the opportunity is. Skate to where the puck&#39;s going. highest short interest in history. Get yourself some small caps, ladies and gentlemen. Uh and uh and they&#39;re going to rock. Um oil&#39;s starting to get some bubbly. We continue to see comtock resources, which you guys all got in with us at 8 and $9 now at 25 and change. It&#39;s still got room. It&#39;ll probably take a breather in the next few weeks, but don&#39;t be phased out. The intrinsic value is higher and we&#39;re excited about that one. Moving along, Goldman Sachs equity sentiment indicator is still subdued. There&#39;s still light positioning. There&#39;s still going to be people forced in or career risk. They sold at the lows. They&#39;re going to have to continue to buy up. I like this chart from Allstart Charts. If small caps are about to enter a fresh period of outperformance, wouldn&#39;t this be a logical place to start? Historically, every major bull run this century saw small caps lead, usually nearing the beginning. Take a look. And again, we&#39;ve emphasized so much over the last 6 to9 months, the the parallels to 2001 to take advantage of. And now if you look at small caps versus large caps at this extreme multi-standard deviation move in relative relative undervaluation and I&#39;m telling you if you missed everything and you were skeptical of the trade and you got shaken out by the tariffs uh because you weren&#39;t listening to the podcast when we said buy everything uh eight weeks ago uh or six whatever it was the beginning of April then uh you still have opportunity. I mean, we&#39;ve had existing new money come in materially and new clients uh are able to send in money whenever they want and they do uh just recently and I had no problem putting lots of money to work uh even at these levels because it&#39;s not the general indices. We&#39;re not in the MAG seven. So even if you say well it&#39;s overvalued uh it the the names that we love will be overvalued in 12 to 24 months they are opportunities of a generation right now. Even though they a lot of them have moved up off the bottom. They&#39;re nowhere near intrinsic value. So if you&#39;re sitting on your hands or you&#39;ve had liquidity events, get after it. This is not a time to snooze because uh the train is leaving the station for for damn sure um in in an aggressive way. Uh next, monthly average returns based on whether the dollar increased or decreased in value that month by various asset classes. So you can see in a dollar down month, value did really well, small caps did really well, international did really well, commodities, emerging markets, etc. And that&#39;s what we are focused on. The dollar continues to weaken. For those of you who&#39;ve been with us for over a year, you know, we&#39;ve been saying it&#39;s coming and here it is. It&#39;s it&#39;s come in a major way. Emerging markets just starting to take off. We&#39;re excited. Uh we expect the US power markets to get critically tight over the next few years. That helps our com stock resources. S&amp;P 500 companies with next 12 months earnings growth above 25%. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I hate to say it, only one magnificent seven company fits in that list, which means if you are overweight, just indices or passive investing or MAG 7, you are going to underperform. We had been warning about that for a while. Yes, they will trade back up to the top of the range. No, they will not dramatically outperform that because their earnings growth is collapsing from 27% in Q1 of this year to 10.2%. 2% in Q1 of next year. Unmagnificent 497 going from negative to a unmagnificent 493, i.e. the rest of the S&amp;P that&#39;s not magnificent 7 is going to exceed the earnings growth of MAG 7 for the first time by Q1 of next year. So basically two more quarters out. The other 493 will have higher earnings growth than the MAG 7 and trading at half the multiple. you want. That&#39;s where you want to be. That&#39;s where tons of doubles and triples are going to be made and you&#39;re going to participate. Uh scheduled additions of solar, wind, and natural gas effective power generation capacity in Mid-Atlantic reading re region are not expected to offset coal and other retirements while power demand is expected to grow significantly. What does that help? Natural gas. What does that help? Generrack backup generators. Not to mention the the uh different climate events and hurricanes and everything that else that&#39;s happening that uh requires and the old unstable um the old unstable grid. So monthly payroll growth uh you saw past revisions downward. The key is to look at the trend. The trend continues to go lower. the Fed will have to cut. I continue to think we&#39;ll be two times this year down 50 basis points plus what Besson&#39;s going to do on the long end of the curve which we&#39;re going to cover later. Uh this is interesting. More and more firms are upgrading Baba now. HSBC Global Research published a report stating that the Ministry of Commerce&#39;s International Trade and Economic Cooperation Research Institute estimates that by 2030, instant shopping will bring a domestic incremental market opportunity of 2 trillion yuan. Alibaba plans to actively expand its market share, fully leveraging the strong relationships between Taoba and brands and merchants. Alme&#39;s delivery network and algorithms, as well as thirdparty operational data. Ellie May and Tao have achieved 40 million daily orders for food and other instant retail compared to JD&#39;s only $25 million daily orders. The firm maintains Alibaba buy rating and target price of $176. That&#39;s just for starters. Once we hit 176, they&#39;ll be taking their price targets up to $225 plus. Median S&amp;P stock short interest as a percentage of market cap is elevated. You can see here at 2.4%. Uh so that&#39;s going to be continue to be more pain. At the lows, no one was short. At the highs, uh excuse me, at yeah, at the lows during CO, no one was short. This is this is moving up and uh very similar thing you saw after the 2000 trough and you had a massive bull market in uh um small caps international and value overgrowth during that period. Again, just one more data point in the mosaic that we&#39;ve been covering for 6 months, pointing to what&#39;s already started to happen, which we had said when was unpopular, international would dramatically outperform uh uh domestic that has happened in spades year to date. And value would start to outperform growth. That is happening. And small cap will start to outperform large. That is on its way. if you missed the first two trains. 4-week average in share buybacks versus the S&amp;P 500. You can see share buybacks nearing a record uh announcements at a record. And this is stuff that you start to see off troughs like you did in uh 2020. And then again following the lows in 2022 when you couldn&#39;t give away Amazon and Google. We were buying it uh hand over fist. Those were easy doubles. And uh now we&#39;re seeing it again after the most recent tariff trough and people are skeptical the entire way up. They will be skeptical this whole way up. Next stop after we hit I think I think we&#39;ll probably hit new highs before we get the next major pullback. We&#39;ll get everyone sucked in at 6150 probably towards the end of July and then August and September will probably rip back down below 6,000 to scare the hell out of everyone before a fourth quarter final rally. Uh dollar performance continues to weaken both structurally and seasonally. That&#39;s going to continue through summer. That should continue to help emerging markets. Corporate buybacks yearto-date share repurchase program authorized 717 billion. We&#39;ve never seen anything like it. Continued bid in the market. Global equities allocation and flows. China is starting to now tick up from dispondency to apathy and from apathy we&#39;ll go to uh comfort and from comfort will go to euphoria and we&#39;re we&#39;re probably 18 months out from euphoria. Earnings growth estimates are soaring for Chinese stocks, not for US stocks. Look at this. And if you&#39;re listening versus watching, I strongly urge you to go to the YouTube.com, type in hedge fund tips, and pull up episode 295 so you can see all these charts and visualize what I&#39;m talking about here. Uh, revisions to forward 12-month earnings per share. China Tech is off the charts, 15%, US anemic at half a percent. Central banks cut rate at fastest pace in 2025 last month. That is global liquidity. You&#39;re seeing uh money supply now retake M2 money supply is now higher than it was in uh April 2022. It took three years to get back up to increasing money supply. That&#39;s liquidity. Stocks are going higher and um and the US will follow suit. Too late. Powell uh is probably going to be too late, but they&#39;ll catch up. So why I, by the way, I loved what President Trump said today. He go, you know, he he he laid out the reasons why Powell should cut a full 100 basis points. I&#39;ve been saying that they&#39;re 150 basis points too restrictive, above the inflation rate, which you saw both the PPI and the CPI come in below expectations for the fourth consecutive month in a row. And Trump talked about the $300 billion of interest savings for every hundred basis points or whatever whatever it is. Um and that probably, you know, gets you a lot further than the Doge cuts. Uh but the second thing he said is lower them. Now if you&#39;re you know be data dependent, not prediction dependent. And if and if you&#39;re right and inflation does go back up, just raise them. You know, it&#39;s much easier to fight off inflation than deflation. Deflation is a spiral you can&#39;t break. And once it starts, it&#39;s very very hard to restimulate and costs a lot of money. But inflation, if you&#39;re wrong and you, let&#39;s say he cut 50 basis points and uh the tariffs kick in and inflation goes up to 3 and a half%. And they wait a few months and it&#39;s not coming down, then just raise rates 50 basis points. It&#39;s not a big deal. It&#39;s it&#39;s much different than if inflation goes negative. Then you&#39;re toast. Then you can&#39;t bring back that sentiment. you can&#39;t bring that back that confidence and it&#39;s years of lost jobs and etc. And if you look at that unemployment trend uh or the jobs creation trend is is going down and it&#39;s better to get ahead of the curve because of the lag of the uh activation mechanism after you take the action takes 6 to9 months. So, retail purchases of Mag 7. Interestingly enough, retail has been right since CO and um interested to see they were buyers in the hole at the end of 2022 and they&#39;re not buyers now. And I think they&#39;re right. I think you get a trade to the top of the range for Mag 7. Everything else is going to be where the money&#39;s made. Small small size consistently outperforms in June. So, we&#39;ll see if we get follow through on the small caps. Share of first-time home buyers has declined from 50% to currently 24%. And that&#39;s what Powell doesn&#39;t get. Powell&#39;s being very narcissistic in his decision not to cut because he quote doesn&#39;t want to be Arthur Burn. So, he&#39;s struggling with his recency bias when it&#39;s comparing apples to oranges and the conditions and the dem demography are completely different than the 1970s when Arthur Burns was operating. And he&#39;s so concerned about his legacy that he&#39;s completely screwing over 75 million millennials who are trying to start a life and can&#39;t afford housing because of Jay Powell. because he screwed up so much on transitory. Now he&#39;s screwing so much on inflation is coming back that these people aren&#39;t able to buy starter homes until they&#39;re in their mid-4s and the poor kids have to grow up in apartments and condos versus running around on the lawn when they&#39;re 3, four, and 5 years old. So start thinking beyond yourself, Mr. Too late Powell, and start thinking about the bulk of the population who needs affordable housing. And the irony of what we&#39;re going to see this time, believe it or not, even if Powell doesn&#39;t do it, Besson&#39;s going to do it. And we&#39;re going to talk about how, is that when rates come down, okay, historically, houses almost trade like a bond. As rates come down, the prices go up. As uh rates go up, sometimes the prices come down. This time, I think it&#39;s going to be the opposite. As rates come down, you&#39;re going to see such an abundant supply hit the market all at once that houses are going to come down. So, not only is the interest payment going to come down and the mortgage rate going to be below 6% on the 30-year fix, but the amount of supply that&#39;s going to come on the market and the amount of building that and housing starts that&#39;s going to spur is really going to help out the millennials. And uh you know, I I&#39;ve already I&#39;m not a millennial. I know people say, &quot;I look young. I&#39;ve already got all the houses I want.&quot; I&#39;m talking about the economy. And if you want a healthy, growing job, massive economy, you want housing to do extremely well. And it just ain&#39;t going to do well until Powell gets his act together and starts one, two cuts and Besset will do what he has to do this summer. So, uh, hopefully this message lands because it&#39;s it&#39;s not about one person&#39;s legacy. It&#39;s about 75 million people who need affordable housing to start families. amilies and if we don&#39;t have family formation, uh, this country is going to be like Europe in 10 years. So, uh, we got to rock and roll. And by the way, not to pick on one guy, we need immigration. Hello. Uh, we need legal immigration, but we need material immigration legally, but open and aggressive to keep the population growing, to keep our global hegemony, economic hegemony, and the American dream humming. The capitalist formula requires population growth. Uh, so if we&#39;re not going to get it from birth, let&#39;s get it from legal immigration. And if rates come down and people have hope they can start a family, maybe you will get it from birth as well, which is the best. Uh, one-year change in active housing inventory for sale. Uh, it&#39;s starting to come up. It will it will do better as uh different actions are taken that we&#39;ve discussed. Annual buyback executions are just about a trillion dollars year-on-year growth. 5% year-on-year growth. That&#39;s very, very constructive. Non-farm payroll growth. It was healthc care driving the bus in the most recent report. Realized and consensus EPS growth for select US equity indexes. This is another one you need to stop the recorder and go look on YouTube because the Russell 2000, everyone&#39;s looking in the rearview mirror at small caps which had negative 14% earnings growth last year. This year it&#39;s going to grow at 23% earnings growth versus the S&amp;P at 7% and the multiple is less on small caps than it is on large caps. And next year, 2026, small cap earnings are going to grow 37% compared to the S&amp;P at 14% and the MAG 7 at 10.2%. So, uh, this is, you know, price is what you pay, value is what you get. If you can get 37% earnings growth for half the multiple of something growing at 10 or 14%, that&#39;s where you want to focus your efforts. just like 2001 through 2007. City earnings reversion index hit the highest since 2021 uh as of the last update through May 30th. So, we&#39;re starting to get positive revisions once again, which is typical during this seasonal part. Usually, you get the negative revisions through Q2 as we were talking about and then they start to inlect. Retail slowed down in May with the net monthly buying dropping to 23 billion. So, they were buyers in the hole and they&#39;ve been right. Now, they&#39;re slowing their buying, but they&#39;re hodlers and uh and we concur. Welcome to a new bull market. More reasons for bulls to smile. New bull markets start 20% off bare or near bare lows. And what happened next? So, we&#39;ve just had that rally off the bottom. 12 months out, you&#39;re up on average another 18.9%. firms are talking about the national reshoring initiative. We&#39;re seeing the manufacturing. So that&#39;s starting to come back. Um and that explains it. 69 degrees in here. Okay, moving along. Foreign investor net purchases of US equities. So that&#39;s gone down. And I think part of that has to do with the uh MAG 7. They were overcrowded in the same exact trade number one. And now they&#39;ve got currency risk because the dollar has been declining so quickly. So you&#39;re going to continue to see that outperformance. And that&#39;s one of the reasons on a micro level being out here in Orange County I&#39;ve been talking about. I think you&#39;re going to see the high-end start to get hit because that Chinese marginal bid that&#39;s been buying a ton of Orange County for the last few years while things have been bad in China. As China is starting to recover and you see the earnings growth and you see the markets starting to go up and you see uh the government changing their policies, the cost to get capital out is so high and the friction and the risk that while it was worth it in the last three or four years when the government was being irrational, now that the economy is growing again, the opportunities to earn and earnings growth are much higher that uh you&#39;re going to see that marginal bid into US real estate in Orange County uh probably collapse which is going to be an air pocket particularly at the highest end. I think the threes and fi and I know that sounds funny to say the threes and fives that the the smaller houses at three and five million in Orange County are will will be fine but the but the 15s and 20s I think we&#39;re going to start to see turn into sevens to tens uh over the next couple of years and that&#39;s going to create a lot of opportunity but uh S&amp;P intrayear declines versus calendar year returns turns. Okay. So you can see here despite average intraear drops of 14.1% and this year I think we have 20% annual returns were positive 34 out of 45 years. Uh upside chasing evidence in Russell 2000 uh options. So, more of what we said was coming. Those who shorted in the hole, which was a trillion dollars worth, now have to chase up. Now they&#39;re trying to catch up with options. You can&#39;t make this stuff up. And when the dealers sell options, what do they have to do? They&#39;ve got to buy the underlying stock. And it creates a little bit of a gamma squeeze situation. Uh, and that&#39;s why I think we go to new highs before uh, you know, by mid to to late July. percent of Russell 2000 5 Russell 2000 members above the 50-day moving average back to 80%. So we&#39;ve gone we&#39;ve gone through the mill now the game is on and people say well it&#39;s overbought. No no no no no when you see huge corrections like that you always see these overbought conditions continue for a long time after uh after the initial recovery and it&#39;s the the catch-up trade becomes so massive. We saw the exact same thing in COVID in 2020. Market traded back up. Everyone was waiting for a leg back down. It&#39;s overbought. It&#39;s overbought. It kept going for another year and a half. Um S&amp;P short interest a rocket ship higher. Multi-year highs with S&amp;P only 2% below all-time highs. Short interest represents future buying power with squeeze situations increasing during rallies. Melt up in S&amp;P should not be a surprise given short interest. So much for hedging. So there is uh from Seth Golden and you can see short interest exceeding the index here on the overlay and that is the formula for continuation higher just people caught on the wrong side of the boat. Consumer sentiment often diverges from consumer spending growth. So sentiment is at a trough just starting to turn up. Consumer momentum waines on falling gas prices and buying ahead pullback, buying ahead of tariffs. So maybe you&#39;ll see a little bit of Q2 softness. Earnings estimates surpass prior highs back up to 280. So um we were 279 for the next 12 month projection uh right before the the liberation day. Then it collapsed down to 277. Now it&#39;s back up to 280 for 12 month forward. So, back at a record high. That&#39;s positive. Buybacks continue to go up. Um, after two-month gains of 20% or more, 12 months out on average up 30%. That again is from Ryan Dietrich. Consumers expected change in year ahead inflation rate. Uh, in May, the New York survey versus the Michigan survey. Big divergence there. Uh, that blows with the wind. Fundamental long short ratio. They&#39;re massively short in the hole. So now they&#39;ve got to play catch-up and there&#39;s a lot of buying power that needs to still come back in. Russell&#39;s looking very good on a technical basis. Record short interest after this even after this huge rally off the lows which is fuel to continue the trend higher back up to new highs. That&#39;s an enormous opportunity ladies and gentlemen. Lot of new money has to go there. Um and um and we&#39;ll continue to participate. Market value of bonds as a percentage of the market value of stocks. This is from Paulson. Total marketable securities for all sectors of the US economy. Wow, that&#39;s interesting. The implication here is the value. Yeah, I I 100% see this. The value of bonds going up, which would be in line with um rates coming down, which will lead to two things. number one price going up across the board and a lot more issuance and refinancing uh at better rates. So again, Powell&#39;s holding everything up because he he doesn&#39;t want his book to be entitled. Jay Powell is the next Arthur Burns and uh screwing the whole world while he focuses on his legacy and his predictive powers of uh what he thinks inflation is going to do, what he thinks tariffs are going to do to prices versus being data dependent and based on right now acknowledging, oh, I&#39;m 150 basis points above neutral. Why don&#39;t I get to neutral and then if inflation becomes a problem, I can always do a 50point hike uh to cool it uh until it works through the mechanism. But instead, it&#39;s all about him. It&#39;s not about the country. It&#39;s not about the 75 million millennials who can&#39;t afford a house and start a family. Um next week, I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel. Natural gas consumption in the electric power sector continues to grow. Natural gas bot price trending up. Credible returns despite stumbles along the way. Oh, this is talking about draw downs from peak since 1985. And that&#39;s that stable coins are mainly backed by liquid assets i.e. T bills and money markets. Money markets are also a lot backed by government guaranteed securities, reverse repo and other. So that points to our view on stable coins uh driving another one to two trillion dollars of demand for treasury over time which will also have an impact on compressing yields, help us refinance, help the millennials etc. Year three of bull markets can be choppy. Uh we&#39;re technically at the beginning of a new bull market if you count the intrayear 20% draw down that we had in April. Uh this you kind of have to back up crypto stable coins market cap now 260 billion and if they get this genius act through probably going to a trillion to two trillion weaker dollar should be a material tailwind for earnings revisions breath. This is an important point in the second half that no one&#39;s really put into their models yet. Uh is that the weak dollar is going to help earnings as the S&amp;P 500 get a a meaningful amount of their earnings from abroad. Disney so what was a headwind now becomes a tailwind. Disney&#39;s now making even more from its theme park business than everything else combined. Uh that is staggering. 59% of the profits CPI month-on-month with new vehicles. So the incentives are starting to kick in. That&#39;s good for volumes. You&#39;ll see that in again in the second half. Even though you had a little pull forward for tariffs, uh, used car and trucks. This is why we always wanted to play the arms dealers, not the waring factions. The OEMs will continue to be a race to the bottom in terms of margins. The suppliers like Cooper Standard that are indispensable and have unique technology will start to do massive volume numbers which will go straight to the bottom line due to operating leverage. US growth by indicators, hard data versus soft data now starting to converge, i.e. the soft data is catching up to the hard data. Euro versus US dollar breaking out to new highs. that was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the beginning of the year except the loyal incredible listeners of hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. US natural gas combined cycle capacity in by initial operating year. What&#39;s the the plan is to bring on supply by then. We will be out of cooper of uh comtock resources. In the meantime, you will be in a deficit and c comtock will continue to do well for the foreseeable 12 to 18 to 24 months. planned US natural gas combined cycle capacity through 2028. Retail outflows from US equities amounted to 29 billion last month. That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m not sure where they&#39;re getting this data because some of it&#39;s conflicting, but according to this data set, they&#39;re they were doing exactly what they did at Q4 2022, which was the buying opportunity of the century. I think this is uh inverted based on the other data that we look at. But either way, if you look at the consistency of the data, what it says is you wanted to be a buyer when this was happening in the past. Uh figure 23 retail flows into European equities market implied Fed funds rate by well oh this is now outdated because as of today it went to two for this year back to two already uh as the 10-year yield came down to 436. housing affordability by state. You can see here and the ones that were kind of the towards the extremes, Florida and Texas are the ones that are starting to get hurt already. I think California is going to experience it yet uh next. Um and you know, I see subtle signs. You know, there two three or four million dollar houses um around the corner that were just built. you know, knockdowns. Everything down by the beach is a knockdown rebuild. And uh they&#39;re beautiful, modern, white, you know, 4,000 square feet, whatever. And uh they&#39;re both white. And rather than lower the price, the guy who built them uh is painting the front of one black. And my wife was like, &quot;That looks worse. I wonder why he&#39;s doing that.&quot; Why he&#39;s doing that is because he&#39;s in delusion. He thinks that it&#39;s not selling because the color is not the right color. uh it&#39;s not selling because the price is too high and the marginal bid is coming out of the market and um and I I think we&#39;re going to see an air pocket and uh that&#39;s going to create a lot of opportunity. So, uh, S&amp;P index based on the bull bear spread. Again, this is what you see at Lowe&#39;s. Everyone&#39;s buying puts in the, uh, this is the institutional investor bull bear spread. And then it it&#39;s not even we&#39;re not even at the overbought level. Like if you look during COVID, it gets overbought and then everyone said here, we&#39;re going back down to retest the lows. Um, or here in 2022 after the lows and then you get this little check back. We&#39;re not even ready to get our major check back. I think we go back to new highs and then we get our check back. Uh in 2016, same thing. We&#39;re like here. We&#39;re early stages of the recovery. Early stages of the recovery. Early stages. Early stages. When you get up here, you still get more gasoline in the tank. So, there&#39;s a lot a lot of stuff to do. And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been so aggressive about getting people deployed in the types of stocks that we&#39;re doing now before, you know, four, five, 6 months from now, we&#39;re up here and everything&#39;s already up another 50, 60%. Uh risk appetite over the next 30 days still subdued. That&#39;s when you want to be buying correctly. Uh picking stocks, not buying the indices, which is which have moved. China net EV sales continue to go up. That&#39;s helping Albamaro, Prime Book of Global Equities, Net Buying. These have been forced chasers, but off of every trough, you get the forced chase, which which is followed by at least a year plus of followrough. US IPO market, this is going to be the next game, Animal Spirits, you&#39;re seeing it with Circle IPO and a couple others trading well above issue price. Uh there&#39;s huge pent-up demand for Animal Spirits. That should help the banks a little bit. Uh this is the stuff that Trump is gutting is the regulation around building houses. Right now it takes 122 days to build a 750,000 ft data center. It takes 122 days to build a 1,700 ft starter home. That should not be the same approval process or red tape. Uh hedge funds are still short in the hole. They&#39;re just now getting positive. They&#39;re going to have to chase a lot more. Institutional clients, same thing. retail who have been right. They were buying in the hole in 2022. This is the correct data from Bank of America. That other Barkclay stuff was inverted. They they actually published it incorrectly. Um they were buyers and they&#39;ve been right since CO and they&#39;re buyers now and they&#39;re going to be right again. So, uh we covered the Sloomer. Let&#39;s just do some quick market stuff I wanted you to pay attention to here. After these spikes, you would think that the rally is over, but it&#39;s usually an indication that it&#39;s just beginning. And that&#39;s the same thing that we&#39;re seeing right now. That was the equity put call ratio 10day moving average here. We&#39;ve got the 1% EMA of advanced decline ratio. Again, coming off the mat, cumulative volume ratio, midle. Again, these are not at extremes where you want to be a seller. Even though we&#39;ve had this huge run, this just coming off the mat, look what happened in 2023, 2024, right after this huge followth through, huge followth through, huge followthrough, huge follow-through going all the way back to 2016. Huge follow through coming off these levels. So, I know it&#39;s hard to believe because you look at earnings and 21 times and blah blah blah. just know that there are so many trap bears and so much short interest that they&#39;re going to continue to rip their faces off. And remember what um I&#39;ve been saying, but you heard from Lutnik more importantly this week that they&#39;re going to have a slew of deals over the next few weeks announced and that&#39;s going to hurt all these people that are off sides and that&#39;s going to be benefit all of you who&#39;ve been paying attention and getting positioned and just minting money. So NASDAQ up down on B balance volume oscillator again. It&#39;s like oh this it&#39;s I&#39;m too late. I&#39;m too late. Well that&#39;s what happens off these huge draw downs and this is what you get. Yeah, maybe you get a little check back to scare everyone. But don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s early days coming off of that type of a draw down. Early days coming off of that type of draw down going all the way back every single time. Uh Burke high low, same thing. not extreme. Real estate still opportunity. CCI we covered this week. Healthc care still huge opportunity. We got a couple names we&#39;ve covered. The Baxters, the XBI, etc. And then um Mlen Summation Index, again, not really yet at extreme and similar to what you see coming off these big draw downs with a lot of follow-through to come. National Association of Active Investment Managers, not back up over 100 yet. Uh PMO by all is a little extended. So that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing a little chop. Uh PMO by Dow Jones, same thing. S&amp;P, same thing. So a little bit of chop we&#39;re seeing and that&#39;s kind of part of it. Uh but I would not get negative yet. I think there&#39;ll be a time to do that. There&#39;ll be a little cool off in the fall, but uh even then, you know, if you&#39;re not at intrinsic value, you just ride it out into the fourth quarter where you get your year-end rally. Uh PMO. Uh here&#39;s the bullish percent S&amp;P. Yeah, it&#39;s a little stretch, but it happens after every big draw down and you get followth through. That&#39;s where people get faked out. I will say this is if I had to give the keys to the kingdom uh that very few people understand is when you get these massive 20% draw downs. Everything looks overbought after the initial rally and all the people who sold into the hole when po Paul Tudtor Jones was saying we&#39;re going to get another 50% correction after the 20% correction and Ray Dalia was saying get out of stocks at the bottom. Um now that they&#39;re up 20% off the lows and everything looks overbought. Now, the people who got in like 3% ago, if you after the whole move up that were wrong at the lows, it&#39;s all psychology. So, as we push up a little bit more, you know, the first 3% pullback we get, they&#39;re going to get shaken out again and that&#39;s going to be the next rip your face off leg to the upside. And that&#39;s what fakes people out is after the big draw downs when everything looks overbought on the recovery rally. There might be a little bit of pullback just to get out the Johnny come lately 2 3% to just scare them out because they&#39;re they&#39;re weak money because they&#39;re already at losses because they sold low. Um it&#39;s the fuel for the next leg higher. That&#39;s what I&#39;m telling you. uh MLEN oscillator. Again, this is not extreme NYC MLEN oscillator. It&#39;s tough to top at these levels, especially coming off that type of correction. So, we continue to be excessively constructive. New highs this summer. Ant international and ant now some headlines. Ant international ant digital to seek stable coin licenses in Hong Kong. Game is on. Alibaba&#39;s Joe Sai says open sourcing its AI models will boost the firm&#39;s cloud business or number one in cloud. Trump says deal restoring China trade truce is done. Everyone bet against that. They were wrong. Yeah, there&#39;s some open ends, etc. The key is is that the volatility is done. The rules of the road are clearer and businesses can start to plan again. JP Morgan lifts you on forecast on easing tariffs risk. We said this was a critical component for Chinese equities recovery. Yes, they&#39;re up huge off the $60 lows in terms of BABA, but it&#39;s the first leg of the first leg, ladies and gentlemen. And you&#39;re going to start to see the yuan appreciate now that this trade stuff is uh figured out, mostly figured out. Uh and you&#39;re going to start to see inflows into China equities in the back half and probably starting very soon, if not now, this month. uh for seasonally this is a strong month for Chinese equities. So let&#39;s see if that holds true this year as well. Chinese stocks in Hong Kong enter bull market before US talks. Global investors are underinvested in China though may express interest says Morgan Stanley. Remember Morgan Stanley was the sell side that was was downgrading Baba in the hole at $80 and $60 and then it went straight up to $120. They were still still had a $60 price target. Now that it&#39;s doubled, now they&#39;re saying maybe they&#39;ll express interest. Well, at $200, I guarantee you Morgan Stanley will be upgrading Alibaba and putting a $300 price target on it. Uh, mark my words on that. Is China. And by the way, I&#39;m not picking on, you know, it&#39;s just the way it goes. Opinion follows trend. It&#39;s human nature. Um, you know, there there are a few people that are have genetic defects like me that that just see things a little bit different and are willing to take that shortterm pain when things are out of favor. That is that those folks do not wind up on the sell side. I can assure you that the sell side are a bunch of Momo guys that follow the trend and save their jobs. So, uh, is China reversing its uninvestable image? You bet. Bessant says $2 trillion dollar reasonable for dollar stable coin market lot of demand. PayPal seeks to launch USD stables coin on stellar. Uh this is only going to enhance. They&#39;re the sixth largest stable coin issuer right now. They will be a beneficiary. That was not even on anyone&#39;s bingo cards when we got involved. PayPal continues to climb. The thing is generating so much cash. It&#39;s going to buy in 20% of the float over the next two years. transaction margins going up. Free cash flow record. Uh it&#39;s it&#39;s just on a tear and Alex Chris is crushing it. So uh again in positive sign for you a 10-year Treasury auction was strong again in positive sign for US assets. US core inflation rises less than forecast and uh JPL continues to sit on his hands and suck his thumb. US payrolls increased 139. Okay. You also had a big downward revision last month. Here&#39;s the trend that I&#39;m showing you guys. This is showing weakening. This is deflationary, not inflationary, deflationary. Okay? So, you got to get ahead of that. Not be too late. Powell with his transient nonsense again. And uh and and because it&#39;s it&#39;s too costly to bring a country out of deflation, especially when you have no dry powder and you got so much interest service on the debt. You got to bring that interest service down like they did following World War II when debt to GDP was 120% like now. They brought it down to 63% by the mid1 1950s. And they did that by letting inflation run a little hot. So you inflate a little bit of that debt away and letting growth run out of control. Inflation 3 to 5%, GDP plus 5% and you bring that rate down from 120 down to 60 within 8 to 10 years. We can do it again, but we just need to write actors in the seats. And so far, we&#39;re missing one at the Fed. Disney takes full control of Hulu for billions less than Comcast wanted. Yee-haw baby, we love our Disney. Theme parks generate 67 billion in annual US economic impact. We love that. No one wanted it at 85. Everyone&#39;s starting to like it at 115. It&#39;s going higher. What stocks do best when the dollar weakens or strengthens? Uh, we covered that through the other charts. Anyway, investors pull out of US stocks and into Europe and emerging markets. Was on No One&#39;s Bingo card uh at the end of last year, except for all of these incredible headed headphone tips with Tom Hayes. Uh mug bearers, hatw wearers, t-shirt wearers, I&#39;m sorry, the golf shirts are still out of stock. We had a tremendous amount of interest in those. The t-shirt is actually even nicer, but uh they&#39;re they&#39;re all great. BFA&#39;s Hunter expects more emerging market gains as dollar drops. Amen. Hallelujah. Boeing books 303 new orders hits 737 max production target in Blockbuster May. Look, the business is doing great. We don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on with India. That was um sad story uh obviously for pray for the families and the victims etc. But that plane was built in 2009. Okay. So that is a that&#39;s before the salesman was running the shop and blowing things up uh prior to Kelly Ortberg. So I wouldn&#39;t make too much of that. If it if it proves to be Boeing&#39;s fault for a plane that&#39;s 16 years old, uh they&#39;ll have to write a check, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that all the other stuff is humming. I would say it&#39;s Air India. My bet is that there was a flaw in the maintenance versus the plane itself. Maybe parts that should have been replaced had not been replaced or maintenance was done improperly, but we don&#39;t know until we know. Uh so as we always say, better to be lucky than to be good. Two weeks ago when I said we took off the options had made too much money too quickly from, you know, the stock going from 135 to 210 in in a matter of a couple of months. We took those off, but we didn&#39;t sell one share of stock and we&#39;re comfortable holding every single share. We have not sold a share. Uh but we were luckier than uh anything to sell all those options at huge profits two weeks ago. Uh and uh and even if we get some short-term volatility with this on the stock, we&#39;re comfortable owning it for the long term for all the reasons we&#39;ve discussed. Namely, they are still a duopoly. And if you want to get it from Airbus, go for it. You can just wait 20 years for your next plane. Get to the back of the line. Small cap stocks are underloved. Why? Their time may be coming. That&#39;s from Jack Hugh. Jack is a incredible writer at Baron, so you can check that out. Also probably a listener of the podcast, although I can&#39;t confirm that. I do know there are a few over there that listen. US power grid getting critically tight. Time to consider backup power at home. Backup power aka the Kleenex of Home Sand by Generate Raiders. gener which is also going to benefit from lower rates which is also going to benefit from the housing theme which is also going to benefit from hurricane season coming now. Surging electricity demand is just one reason natural gas looks so appealing to investors. All the themes we&#39;ve got covered. The genius trade nobody wants stock market and sentiment results. Time for a rotation this time of year with the Stanley Cuff playoffs in full swing. I&#39;m reminded of one of the key frameworks we live by a great hill capital that comes straight from the great one himself Wayne Gretzky who famously said skate to where the puck is going not to where it has been this by the way for the new people listening you can find our article of the week at hedge funfundtips.com just uh scroll down to popular post and you can just click on that there kind of framework isn&#39;t exactly popular in today&#39;s investment world more often we see investors chasing the shiny object s aka the names making the headlines that are already up 5x and suddenly being called quote great buys. We prefer the names that no one wants, the ones left for dead. And we&#39;ve built a long track record of doing just that. Whether it was energy during COVID when oil prices went negative, big tech in the fall of 2022 when everyone was calling for a recession that had already come or banks and real estate after the mini banking crisis in 2023. We skate to where the puck is going. Even this year, look at Boeing. Just a few months ago, no one would wanted it in the 130s. Now at 2:15 everyone, it&#39;s all anyone wants to talk about. So the question today is where&#39;s the puck going next? That brings us to one of our favorite themes right now and the topic of this week&#39;s article, housing and rate sensitives. The consensus view is that rates will stay higher for longer and anything rate sensitive, especially housing related, is left for dead. We&#39;re happy to take the other side of that trade. What I&#39;m about to say is something you won&#39;t hear anywhere else. By the end of 2025, we expect to see 30-year fixed rate mortgages below 6%. When that happens, you will see the beach ball of pent-up demand held underwater for the past three years finally explode higher at that point. Housing related stocks and cyclicals will be the talk of town. So with mortgage rates currently sitting at 685, how do we see a path below 6% in the next 6 months? Treasury Secretary Scott Besson has a couple of arrows in his quiver that address that question, two of which we will highlight today. First off, the supplementary leverage ratio aka SLR introduced after the great financial crisis as part of the Basel 3 reforms requiring banks to hold a minimum capital level relative to their total assets. Scott Besson has argued and Jerome Powell has actually agre agreed that because the SLR does not factor in risk waitings, it effectively penalizes banks for holding US treasuries. Bessant has called loosening the SLRs a high priority and proposed exempting government guaranteed securities from banks total assets. Regulators are reportedly very close to making the change with an announcement possible as early as this summer. Bessent estimates that the exemption could free up as much as $2 trillion in bank balance sheet capacity, creating an overnight surge in demand for treasuries and lowering yields by 30 to 70 basis points. Here&#39;s a great interview from a few weeks ago where Bess goes over the SLR around the 13-minute mark, followed by an article that explains the change in detail. So, you can read through that at hedge funips.com. The genius act in stable coins. Buffett has always preached the importance of staying within one circle of competence. It&#39;s a principle we have long followed staying in our lane by focusing on high-quality businesses when they are temporarily impaired and sitting tight until they reach full value. I.e. our edge is time arbitrage. But even old school equity guys but like myself are starting to get excited about the potential impact of digital assets as it relates to demand for treasuries. Here&#39;s why. Right now, the stable coin market sits at roughly 250 billion, but remains largely unregulated and lacks any for formal legal framework. The Genius A, currently under review in Congress and possibly headed toward the Senate floor as soon as next week, would change that. The bill would require issuers to fully back stable coins with highquality liquid assets, including US treasuries, if passed. The estimates suggest that stable coin market could grow to more than two trillion by 2028. That kind of growth would create near overnight surge in demand for treasuries. So you have two billion from the SLR, another sorry two trillion from the SLR, two trillion from stable coin passage. You&#39;re talking 4 trillion in demand for treasuries. That&#39;s serious demand that will compress yields. That kind of growth would create a near overwright surge in demand for treasuries. Best in estimates between 1 to two trillion in incremental demand could materialize over the coming years. Even if those estimates are cut in half, you&#39;re still looking at a major tailwind for lower rate compression across the board. Here&#39;s a good breakdown of stable goods and the genius rate from the Treasury, etc. Stable coin issuers could be one of the largest holders of US treasuries by 2030, more than Japan, more than China, more than the UK, etc. Oh, and by the way, not only do our rate sensitive plays stand to benefit as yields come down with the Genius Act, but we also own PayPal, aka the issuer of the sixth largest stable coin in circulation, now approaching 1 billion market cap. QXO update. QXO is up 65% since we talked about it on Fox Business a couple months ago on April 4th. You can see the video here. is up much more since we originally covered it on the podcast. A few weeks ago, Brad Jacobs laid out his blueprint for turning QXO into the $50 billion powerhouse he envisions. His 5-year plan includes more than doubling IBIDA and driving over 500 basis points of margin expansion. In fact, his expectations for earnings upside for Beacon have materially increased since closing the deal. For us, QXO is a classic example of betting on the jockey. Brad Jacobs has a track record that speaks for itself. An investment in QX in XPO when he got involved would have been a 50 bagger. United Rentals would have been close to a 70 bagger. Altogether alongside Jacobs across his companies including United in including United Rentals Waste Management have generated more than 300 times investors money. On top of that, Brad Jacobs also puts his money where his mouth is and has some serious skin in the game with QXO. He wrote a $900 million check out of his own pocket and now owns 28% of the equity. The rest of QXO&#39;s leadership has material ownership and incentive plans tied to stockholder returns. This is the kind of position we are happy to buy. Throw in a filing cabinet and watch Brad Jacobs work his magic over the next few years. We think over the long term, this is a five to six bagger knowing Brad Jacobs, it could end up being much more. Here&#39;s the full QXO investor presentation which does a good job laying out the playbook for how Jacobs plans to build his next masterpiece and disrupt disrupt the building products distribution industry. Safe to say we are excited to be along for the ride. Can go through that at your leisure. Wolf Research put the $44 price target on the stock. 162% upside that came out just a few days ago. So, when we were pitching it at $13 and lower, it went to 11 against us after we bought it. Everyone said, &quot;You&#39;re an idiot for buying it at two times cash, blah, blah, blah.&quot; I said, &quot;I idiot I am.&quot; We bought more. Now, it&#39;s at 20 going to 50 going to 100. So, uh, bet on the jockey is the name of the game. Now, the reason being, the reason housing is one of our favorite themes isn&#39;t just because it stands to benefit from lower rates. We&#39;ve also discussed the strong demographic tailwinds, peak fam family formation in the 30 to 35 year old range group and for proving affordability driven by starter home revival, multi-million unit housing shortage and opening up of federal lands all supporting our thesis. Apollo put out a great housing outlook. Note a few weeks ago also highlighting some of these tailwinds. You can see the affordability at record lows not since seen s seen since the early 2000s. Uh, demographic tailwinds are a tailwind to housing demand. Median age of all home buyers is now 56 years old, up from 31 in 1981. This is like an extreme that will revert very very quickly. Total housing inventory per person is very low. US has an estimated deficit of 2.4 million homes. US homes are getting smaller. Median size of new single family homes is declining. We said this would start to happen two years ago. It&#39;s now happening. The whole game is going to be on. You see this going back to the early 2000s and then it just picks up. Uh this is the fastest Fed driven housing slowdown on record. Let me repeat that again. This is the fastest Feddriven i.e. legacy personal legacy selfish interest Feddriven housing slowdown on record. Next week I&#39;ll tell you how I really feel. Crown Castle update. This is also interest rate sensitive. You can see the free cash flow here. You can see the price. This is going to revert back. It&#39;s all a function of rates. In the meantime, you pick up a 4% dividend yield. You can read through the earnings. At the end of the day, here are the key points you need to know about Crown Castle. One, it&#39;s going higher in our view. A lot higher. Top priority remains closing the 8.5 billion sale of its small cell and fiber solutions business in the first half of 2026. Management continues to make solid progress working through the regulatory approval process once completed. Crown Castle will become the only publicly traded pure play tower company focused exclusively on the US. Management continues to expect annual AFO in the range of 2.27 billion to 2.42 once a transaction closes. Compared to current outlook of 1.7 to 1.8, Eight, the increase is largely driven by anticipated reductions in interest expense and significantly leaner cost structure of the standalone business. Three, management expects to repay $6 billion of debt with the transaction proceeds and allocate up to three billion toward share repurchases, roughly 7% of the current market cap. Four, organic revenue growth came in at 5.1% in Q1, ahead of the 4.5% fullear guidance. management reiterated guidance across the board and noted they were tracking towards the high end of the range and may even expand it as the year progresses. Mobile data demand continues to grow at a strong clip with the roll out of 5G network. CCI&#39;s customers have invested over 35 billion annually into their networks, helping to drive more than 5% organic growth in the tower business. Conversations with customers remain constructive and growing competitive pressure among carriers continues to be a strong tailwind for tower companies. Capex a long concern for capital intensive fiber business since it accounted for nearly 90% of the spending last year total just 40 million this year only 4% of revenues compared with 20% last year with the US tower business requiring minimal capex capital allocation will begin shifting toward returning capital to owners consolidated adjusted ebid margins for the quarter were 68% a 500 basis point improvement year-over-year as highly attractive tower businesses is no longer held back by the fiber and small cell segments. Eight, sprint churn should largely be done by the end of 2025 with management continuing to expect long-term churn rates of just 1 to 2%. Nine, management remains committed to maintaining an investment grade balance sheet with an average maturity length over six years, 89% fixed rate debt, and long-term average targets of six to six and a half times IBIDA and 10 beginning. I feel like I&#39;m David Letterman top 10 list. Beginning in the second quarter, management reduced the dividend to 4.5 uh still yielding 4.27% at today&#39;s prices. This new quarterly payout is expected to run at a rate of 75% to 80% of anticipated AFO. Okay, closing out the article. Our sentiment uh even Morning Star still has 125 fair value. Uh it&#39;s going higher, a lot higher than that. Uh sentiment is is up there, still not yet extreme. Same with active investment managers exposure still not fully at extreme. Consumer staples earnings revisions last 60 days. Rear view looking seasonally weaker, which is normal. They bring down estimates the first half, they ramp them up the second half. They&#39;re down 2.45 and 2.75% respectively. It&#39;s already in the stocks. Defensive have sold off. uh we&#39;re probably at the trough there. Consumer discretionary down just 33 basis points for this year and 1.06 for next year. So those are holding up. Some of those have run ahead of themselves. I think that&#39;s the shift we&#39;re also going to see in the next quarter. Uh let&#39;s just look at this inflation data. Came in headline below expectations at 2.4% 4% month on month only 10 basis points up. Uh and then today you saw PPI a similar story expected to be up uh core was expected to be up 3/10en of a percent was only up onetenth of% year-on-year 3% versus 3.1 estimates and PPI was supposed to be up 210 of 1% month-on-month uh headline and was only up onetenth of 1%. So Powell, wake up and smell the deflation. Disinflation. I&#39;d say you&#39;re on, you keep it up, it&#39;ll be deflation. Um, and by the way, very un popular view, but you do not want this this to catch up because once deflation starts, you can&#39;t stop it. Inflation, you can stop in 5 minutes with an emergency hike. Deflation, it&#39;ll cost trillions. Um, and a lot of heartache and unemployment. just so the guy can get his legacy guaranteed. Um, all right. So, earnings, they&#39;ve taken down estimates for Q2. I love this because the bar is low. At the end of March, Q2 estimates were 9.3%. They&#39;re now down to 4.9%. So, they set the bar low so they can step right over it. they will beat this just like they did in Q1 when they took it down to 6% earnings growth and they actually did 13.3% earnings growth. This my guess is it&#39;s expected to be 5%. It&#39;ll probably be 9 or 10% and that&#39;ll be enough to get us to new highs before we probably take a breather in the fall uh ahead of the year and follow through. So that&#39;s that. The podcast is over. Now we go on to the ask me anything questions from our amazing audience. Uh so if you like to stick around from that and you learn as we go through individual companies that the audience is asking me to look at uh please stick around. For the rest of you we&#39;ll be back next week, same time, same place. So here we go. Okay, question one comes from Austin McVan wanted to know your thoughts on S AIA. Let&#39;s take a look. Got to sign in here. That does that. Let&#39;s bring it up here. H S A I A. All right. I have a feeling this one&#39;s going to be good. Let&#39;s take a look. What is going on with the negative free cash flow, my man? Yeah, I this is Let me take a look at the balance sheet. I&#39;m going to say probably a pass on this until I see a quarter of break even cash flow. But let&#39;s take a look at the uh $19 billion 19 million of cash long-term debt 194. I&#39;m not sure about this one. Uh so you&#39;re saying stock crash due to weather? Stock doesn&#39;t crash due to weather. Stock crash due to mismanagement. You got a lot of negative free cash flow. partner tariff uncertainties. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It&#39;s not time yet. Wait till they get a quarter of positive free cash flow and if the stock is still down, jump on it. If it&#39;s not, if uh something is not good here. Okay. So, my I want to understand their turnaround story and then I want to see them execute on their turnaround story. But for right now, it&#39;s just a bleeding raccoon on the side of the road. Uh David Burgerer asked for thoughts on Carvana Short. Yeah, look, I understand what you&#39;re saying about Carvana, but the problem is they&#39;re generating a lot of cash. So the question is, do you want to short on valuation alone? Good luck. You might be right in the short term. Maybe it&#39;s overbought in the short term and you can do it as a fivem minute trade. But what is this thing? $68 billion market cap on a billion and a half of Ibida. Four times sales, 60 times IBIDA. Um, balance sheets. Okay. They got they got a lot of cash. If you look at the enterprise value here, is that correct? They got $20 billion of cash. Yeah. I wouldn&#39;t be shorting a company with $20 billion of cash. What do they have? 13. I don&#39;t know. You really have to You really have to be convinced that the business model is toast. I don&#39;t really know anything about it other than I I wouldn&#39;t short on valuation for this one. Brendan Garvey, love the pod. Current finance student who&#39;s considering the CFA. Any thought on the program? Current state of value as it adds value both to the person taking it in the reflection to employers. I would say uh if you&#39;re coming out of school with no world experience or investing credibility um it&#39;s indispensable like you have zero value without that information more or less. So I would, you know, unless you&#39;ve run a business for 20 years and, you know, you understand financials like the back of your hand, uh, I think it&#39;s absolutely indispensable and it&#39;s and it has nothing to do with should I get it to look good to employers. You should get it as an investment in yourself and in yourself only. So um, I think it&#39;s absolutely indispensable. I mean, if you had an NBA and you&#39;re like 30 or you&#39;d run a business for 10 years and made, you know, 10 20 million bucks and, you know, you understood financials and you understood businesses and you&#39;ve been investing for 10 years on your own and pretty good at it, it&#39;s probably not the highest and best use of time, but at your age, it&#39;s it&#39;s without question. That&#39;s table stakes. And then you may still not succeed. You may still not get hired. It does not give you a right to a job. it gives you an opportunity to a job, but without it uh unless you&#39;re at one of the Ivy&#39;s, I think, uh your odds are low. So, um I would do it for yourself first and foremost. Your employers will see it as a commitment that you&#39;re not just entering the career because you think it&#39;s a way to make money, but you&#39;re entering it because it&#39;s what you actually want to do. Um and I think you&#39;re on the right track. So, thanks for putting that in and I&#39;m sure that helped a lot of people. Theo D or I&#39;m sorry, Johan Hagen Hagen Bjork. Hi Tom. Johan Hagen Bjork. Okay, these are my guys in Sweden. A question from another member of the Swedish investment crew. Quote, beer and Baba. These are my fans in Sweden that have been tuning in uh for the last couple years while we built out the Baba position. I hope your basis is below 85 and you&#39;re making money and you&#39;re going to make a lot more money and be able to afford a lot more beer. Uh here is your and uh hopefully you&#39;re buying it from Guinness sold by Dagio. Uh what is your opinion of the off-road vehicle company Polaris? They are a dividend aristocrat making headwinds for macro demand. Look, this is another rates play. Um, I think we&#39;re getting close. I was looking at FOXF this week. I generally hate these businesses to be honest with you. They&#39;re garbage businesses, but I think at this level, you&#39;re probably right. Let&#39;s take a look at the financials. As a matter of fact, this might even be on my, you know, we have like a two-page list of targets that we do constant work on, and maybe out of 60 names, one or two will make it into the portfolio within 90 days. Uh, let&#39;s see. I think this didn&#39;t make it only because of the reason I hate the business, but I think you&#39;re going to be right on this one. I mean revenues are really collapsed here. Margins collapsed. Let me see the balance sheet. I mean if rates come Yeah. I mean it this is just another rate plan. I don&#39;t want to be overweight rate plays. But all right, they&#39;re bringing the share count down. Yeah, I mean the cash flow was really light last year. Let&#39;s see what it is on a quarterly basis. [Music] I like it. Beer and Baba. I like it. I like it. I think you&#39;re going to be fine. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do anything with it, but I do like it. All right, Theo wanted to come. Yeah. All right. So, so this guy is like asks us about BTMD and then one of my clients who&#39;s a wealthy OC guy said like everyone&#39;s taking it and it&#39;s causing a lot of divorces because apparently it makes old guys feel super duper young and act super duper young if you catch my drift. Is this the one? Let me just let me just see. Hormone optimization, hormone replacement, pellet therapy, bio end to end. So, apparently this stuff works. Um, and there&#39;s maybe only one supplier. Yeah, we just don&#39;t do individual biotech companies because we don&#39;t think we have an edge and we stay where we do have an edge. But I think on a financials basis, if you think you have an edge on the product and you feel damn comfortable that the mode is impenetrable, then have at it. Um question is is how bad are they going to delete dilute you over time? And you have no way of telling. They&#39;ve gone from 1 million shares to 35. What&#39;s to say they won&#39;t go to 100? So the it it might win and management are a bunch of scumbags and they give themselves unlimited amounts of options because they got the board in their pocket. I I I would I would spend all of your time studying the history of the CEO and what has he done for owners in the past? Because he could have the best thing in the world and you could be right about the product and you won&#39;t make a dime because he puts it all in his pocket. And you see that a lot with these type of companies. So, uh, investor relations, governance, executive leadership. Brett Christensen. Let&#39;s see what this guy has done. Myriad genetics was a disaster if I&#39;m not mistaken. My Y gn. Yeah. Train wreck. Uh, whole X. H O L X. What was he involved there? That looked like a success. And pod All right. Drove significant revenue growth. Utah Valley. He has a bachelor&#39;s from Utah Valley business school. No medical background. You better do a lot of work on this one. That&#39;s all I have to say. So, I&#39;ll leave it at that. I think you&#39;re going to be right about the product. The question is whether you&#39;re going to make money off the stock. And I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t do individual names like that. Hey, turnaround time. I have a question. Could you look at IPG? It&#39;s not even down 50%. So, it&#39;s not that interesting to us, but let&#39;s take a look. Sure. The balance sheet is okay. Revenues have been declining for four consecutive years. $4.2 billion of debt. Oh, they&#39;ve got two billion of cash, so that&#39;s good. billion dollars of free cash. That&#39;s pretty damn good. I&#39;m sorry. Revenues have not been dec uh flattish. All right. share accounts coming down. I mean, it&#39;s worth exploring. I don&#39;t like that kind of business, but I mean, if you want to take that risk for 50% move over three years, it&#39;s not going to be a high enough IR for us, and it&#39;s just not attractive enough. I I don&#39;t really like that business. So, I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be wrong, but I wouldn&#39;t get excited about it. Crispy Cream. This has been a perennial disapp. Let&#39;s see if they&#39;re not They might be so low if they don&#39;t. Oh my god. Stock is just getting destroyed. Weren&#39;t they supposed to have a deal with McDonald&#39;s? What did that Did that fall through? Is that the problem? Uh, donut. DN U T. No, there&#39;s nothing here. I mean, this thing&#39;s just losing cash hand over fist, no matter how cheap it is. Let&#39;s save the balance sheet. Let&#39;s see if you can even live to watch it turn around before they restructure it. 29 million of cash. Share count&#39;s gone up by 50% almost or 40%. How much debt? 800 million on 29 million of cash you got. So, it&#39;s trading like it&#39;s going out of business. Uh like not out of business, but bankrupt and they&#39;ll have to uh the debt holders will will own the company. Uh free cash flow negative. They&#39;ve never really generated returns on capital. Look, I think this is a trade, Jason. I mean, I can see the attractiveness of it. I think Crispy Cream will always be in business. The question is, will you own it or will the debt holders? And some risks are just not worth worth taking. I think this is one of those. And even if it triples or quadruples, I would have z errors of omission are okay. Errors of commission, like taking a binary gamble on whether a company goes bankrupt or not. I don&#39;t think is the best use of capital. Johnny S. He&#39;s asking about Maitwan. I don&#39;t like Muan. I like Baba. Um I think I think it muan could go the way of Grab. Not Grab. Um GrubHub and um all the metos. I I I just think that it&#39;s it&#39;s too crowded and even if it works, I I just I think it&#39;s a commodity business. Um I need a lot more outs in China and and I have it with Alibaba. I don&#39;t want to take China risk and take company risk. Muan has never been for me. It&#39;s not for me. Doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t go up when all of China goes up. I just don&#39;t want to take that risk. Anton Ellerman, what are your thoughts on Regeneron? Uh there are rumors a new ompic drug in development that will add protein and lose weight. Look, I like Regeneron, but I don&#39;t buy individual biotech stocks. So, you&#39;re just I mean, it&#39;s cheap enough and it&#39;s quality enough and management is good enough. It&#39;s become very bureaucratic. That&#39;s that&#39;s also slowed it down quite a bit. Um I think you&#39;re going to be right here, but I&#39;m not going to be involved with you. I&#39;ve looked at it a million times and I just can&#39;t get there. But I If you put a gun to my head and said you got to buy an individual biotech stock right now and hold it for the next five years, it would either be this or or Biogen. And I haven&#39;t done enough work on either of them. So, um, but I don&#39;t have to, so I won&#39;t do it. And let&#39;s just take a look here. I mean, they got more than enough cash for the turnaround plan to pay out. So, this drug better hit because their revenues have just been declining. So, I wouldn&#39;t bet against them. And I think at these levels, if you had to go into an individual biotech, this might be one of them. But you don&#39;t, so why would you? Uh, SNN, this is from Chris Williamson. It&#39;s a UK medical device worker. Uh, medical device. Yeah, I don&#39;t. It&#39;s It&#39;s just not down enough. It&#39;s like you&#39;re not really going to make a lot of money for taking any risk. I It&#39;s got to be a double or triple for me to get involved. And this one hasn&#39;t come in enough. So, yes, cash flow is recovering. Yes, it probably trades back up to 45. So, you&#39;ll make 50% over the next couple of years. Um, let&#39;s look at the balance sheet. I think there&#39;s a lot of things to do in medical devices. They are left for dead. I think the balance sheet&#39;s okay here from what I can see. Got to double check it with source materials. I think you&#39;re okay. I just don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to make a ton of money. I think you&#39;re going to make a little bit of money and I don&#39;t take risk for a little bit of money. Lyall M. Puma, I think we covered this. VF is a better play because you have More outs and more ways to win. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really know the brand. I don&#39;t like the brand. I mean, other than Ricky Fowler, I don&#39;t know anything about the brand. So, this is a European thing. I stay within my circle of competency. This is not within it. And I if I was going to buy another sneaker company, I&#39;d be buying Nike all day long. That I understand. That I think is a buy. But I don&#39;t like the upside as much as I like it in VF Corp when Bracken turns it around. So, um, I&#39;m going to just say I have nothing to say on this one. Not good, not bad, just nothing. Leaf Foster, BME on the LSE. This is an ETF, isn&#39;t it? No, it&#39;s not. General merchandise and grocery stores. Oh, is this like a uh lidles and uh like those lowcost supermarkets? Yeah. I mean, this reminds me of Tesco, which got smashed that Buffett owned, but billion pounds of debt. Cash flow. I think this might be interesting. I would have to understand the business more, but I think you&#39;re on the right track. I&#39;, you know, read the annual report, listen to the last eight earnings calls, start to understand the turnaround story. Uh, what&#39;s happening here with revenues? I think it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m actually going to write it down and maybe do a little work on it. UK play, which I&#39;m kind of interested in. Good work, Lee. Michael Silber. Is it okay for a company share count to go up due to an acquisition? Well, it depends if it&#39;s dilutive or accretive. And what does that mean? Is the multiple of the company that they&#39;re buying lower than the multiple of the stock that they&#39;re issuing? Uh, and then is the growth rate as fast for the company they&#39;re issuing versus their current shares? And then C, what is the synergies? What do the synergies look like? So, if I&#39;m issuing stock at 30 times earnings and I&#39;m buying a and I&#39;m growing at 10% and I&#39;m buying a company that&#39;s trading at 15 times and growing at 10%. I should probably do that all day and then if I can add some synergies on top of it, fine. Uh I prefer debt financing if they can do it reasonable rates and not dilute at all but uh in that arbitrage. But if I&#39;m growing at 30% and trading at 10 times and I buy a company that&#39;s growing at 20% at 20 times and I give stock, I just diluted my shareholders. So the answer is it&#39;s it&#39;s not an easy answer, but I tend to not like it. Um, love your podcast. From your experience, do you think the VF Corp investigation from Levi and Corsinski would negatively affect the stock? No. These are a bunch of scumbag ambulance chasers that just sue every stock that the price is down and hustle them for payoffs and it&#39;s just a friction in the economy because unfortunately we&#39;re not in a loser pays system. Uh and it&#39;s a cost of doing business. So, uh, these happen any stock that the price goes down more than 30%. These ambulance chasers file a suit and hope for a payoff and they usually get it, which is why they keep doing it. And, uh, hopefully that&#39;s something Trump can change. But, in the meantime, uh, it is what it is. And no, it&#39;ll have zero impact if they even, uh, have a case, which they don&#39;t. All right. Uh, thoughts on Domino&#39;s Pizza Enterprises in Australia? The Qataris, I think, just offered to buy Papa John&#39;s, which was a super cheap stock. Yeah, I think with this one all you got to look at is the margin. If I take a look at the revenue income statement here, I mean the revenues have really been anemic. So I want to understand why that is. There&#39;s no growth. So, explain how they&#39;re going to reacelerate growth. Um, it&#39;s just steady state. They should just be buying in stock and they&#39;re not. Let&#39;s see if we can figure out why. They&#39;ve only got 58 million in cash. little bit of leverage on the balance sheet. I think you&#39;re probably okay here. I kind of like it. Uh but do do some real work on it before you buy anything. But generally seems like an okay find and thanks for sending it in. Dylan Cook, thanks for your podcast videos. Take a look at Owens Corning. Uh yeah, we covered that one a few weeks ago. I think we said so. So So yeah, it hadn&#39;t come in enough for us. So uh I think it&#39;s okay, but I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer here. I&#39;d probably be an interested below 100 and it may not ever get there and I won&#39;t care one bit if it goes to new highs without me. But um it wasn&#39;t compelling enough for me at that level. It&#39;s okay. It will benefit from the housing. It&#39;ll probably be fine, but I need a double or triple, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to get that anytime soon on that. Uh, thank you for your content. Valuable knowledge you always share on online and on TV. ACMR, I&#39;m personally long the stock and see 34 to 40 as a good target. Okay. On what basis? a CMR. All right. Looks like they&#39;re just starting to generate some cash. Revenues are growing. Revenues are growing very fast. Share account&#39;s growing a little bit. Uh what do they do? manufactures and sells capital equipment packaging tool and wafer assembly and packaging customers front-end production wafer surfaces shares outstanding two times sales 10 times evida uh 16 times earnings. I don&#39;t know. I I I mean, I would never buy a stock at $25 for an upside of 34 to 40. Um but it seems okay. It&#39;s It&#39;s okay. I just think there are higher and better uses from these levels, but um I&#39;d have to understand the business a little bit more. Uh, Professor Tom, do you keep this from Jimmy Jones, you keep a certain percentage of cash in your portfolio from a sale or do you immediately deploy into equity that are still undervalued? I know, opinion, not advice. Okay. Uh, it depends on the opportunities. Like right now, I could deploy a huge amount of capital very, very, very quickly because there&#39;s still opportunities. But that window&#39;s closing. It&#39;ll probably be closed in the next 8 to 10 weeks. Um so when we like the the the huge proceeds we had from the Boeing options we were able to deploy that immediately. Uh if opportunities are are light we&#39;ll just deploy into shorts or we will just wait on cash until we find opportunities. But uh right now we could deploy unlimited amounts. like I I could deploy $2 billion tomorrow uh easily uh and have plenty of opportunities to do so. I think in six months it&#39;s going to be a lot harder, but um uh there&#39;s no limitations. If there&#39;s no opportunity, I&#39;ll hold cash or do shorts. Uh but there&#39;s always some type of opportunity because if it&#39;s risk on, defensives are in the gutter. if uh if um if the market&#39;s down a lot then risk assets are on sale. So uh there&#39;s also opportunities in the bond market. You know if you&#39;re in a real draw down you can do high yield. I mean we can go across all asset classes. Uh equities but we&#39;re concentrated equities is where we like to focus and um and there&#39;s usually something to do. We don&#39;t hold cash that long unless we see something really special happening. So, um I&#39;ll leave it at that. Okay. Now, see if we have one more and then we will move along. Ken View KVU. I met the CEO at the Al Smith dinner. I thought he was a spectacular guy, as was his wife. Um but yeah, never did anything with it. That was uh almost a year ago. I just don&#39;t think Tylot all over the counter stuff. [Music] Looks like they have a little bit of pricing power. I don&#39;t know why the share count has gone up so much. That&#39;s bothersome for a company that big. Unless they did a big acquisition. free cash flows come down quite a bit. It&#39;s t haved in the last year. Let&#39;s see what it&#39;s done on a quarterly basis. I mean, this is a defensive, so it is kind of interesting right now because defensives are out of favor in some pockets. I mean, you&#39;re not really getting a bargain for a slow going growing business. So, I I I would just have to understand what is the growth driver because I&#39;m not seeing growth yet. All I&#39;m seeing is growth in share count, not growth in earnings or cash flow or all the things that matter. So, uh, and they&#39;re, you know, a little bit leveraged. So, it&#39;s not, you know, just because the stocks down five two bucks doesn&#39;t get me very excited. Um, nothing really to do yet here. This is not this is not a good highest and best use of capital. I It&#39;s not to say it won&#39;t be okay. Griffis. This is from Wilhelm Kunberger. Uh G R I F. Is this a steel producer if I&#39;m not mistaken? G R I F H. This is definitely interesting. What is it? Please don&#39;t be in the steel business. No. Oh, plasma therapeutic company in Spain. Immunoglobin to treat immuno defici. Again, this is a wow. This is founded in 1909. Blood services, immunoglobin, liver cerosis. Oh god, I don&#39;t know. Is this a biotech company? I mean, I I like what I&#39;m seeing. I gotta be honest with you. So, free cash flow is going up. Revenues are going up. Margins look like they&#39;re stabilizing. Share count is steady. I think your uh pre-cash flow looks good. I think the risk is going to be Let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet. Billion dollars of cash and almost $9 billion of debt. That&#39;s your risk is the balance sheet leverage. So, you got to go through the public filings and find out when all their debt matures and what are the terms of their debt. uh how sustainable the cash flow recovery is because I think with everything else held equal, I think it&#39;s trading down because of that leverage and where rates are, but they&#39;re cutting in Europe and this is a Spanish-based company if I&#39;m not mistaken. Um I think you might have something here, Wilhelm. So, good job. Do more work before you do anything. Robert Wartanian, how do you like Ant Sports Brand for Asia? Growing food chain from the Philippines. Asian food paired with burgers and chicken. Uh, anti- sports. Oh, is this a Chinese company? Let&#39;s see in China cross trainining people&#39;s republic of China. I won&#39;t buy any companies in China other than Baba. I&#39;m not taking company and country risk. All the numbers look great. I can give you a hundred companies that look great in China. Baba is my only play in China. Only ever will be. I think the numbers look fine. I just wouldn&#39;t be involved personally. Uh so with that said, we&#39;ll be back next week. same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat.
