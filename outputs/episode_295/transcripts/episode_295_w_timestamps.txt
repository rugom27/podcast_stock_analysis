[0.64s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.879s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.52s] 2005th videocast podcast for the week
[7.759s] ending June 12th, 2025. We got a lot to
[10.719s] cover today, but as always, family
[12.8s] first, then we&#39;ll get down to business.
[14.639s] Uh that&#39;s Annabelle there. She set a new
[18.56s] Nova Aquatics 9 to10 girls team record
[21.68s] in the 400 meter freestyle with a time
[24.0s] of 44204. She beat her previous record
[27.279s] by 8 seconds at age 10. Ranks top 10 in
[30.88s] the nation for 12 year olds in both the
[33.76s] 200 IM and the 400 free. Great job on
[38.96s] that, Annabelle. Moving along. Uh this
[42.559s] was Oh, this was the Newport Beach TV
[45.76s] Fest this weekend. Want to thank Carrie
[48.16s] and Theo for uh hosting us there. You

[53.84s] son was there. He&#39;s an actor in White
[56.0s] Lotus and Billy Bob Thornton uh from
[60.239s] Land Man. If you haven&#39;t watched Land
[61.76s] Man, that was a fun time. Also got to
[64.4s] host uh Mimi&#39;s birthday. She turn she&#39;s
[68.72s] turning 13 this month at Great Wolf
[72.24s] Lodge, which uh oddly I was very much
[75.76s] looking forward to because I think after
[77.759s] 13 there aren&#39;t going to be too many
[79.6s] more trips to Great Wolf Lodge. So, we
[82.24s] stayed an extra day and went down the
[84.4s] crazy slides. Uh there&#39;s Caitlyn,
[86.88s] Annabelle, Mimi having a fun day. Uh got

[183.76s] you are, for for hosting me uh for an
[186.239s] incredible uh 18 holes at your beautiful
[188.879s] club this week. And that is that. Let&#39;s
[192.56s] get down to business, ladies and
[193.76s] gentlemen. Uh, first one is I want to
[197.44s] thank Christian Dagger and Stuart Vney
[199.68s] for having me on Fox Business yesterday
[202.159s] to discuss general market outlook, etc.
[204.319s] So, we&#39;re going to listen in here. The
[206.48s] markets still plenty of green out there,
[208.08s] but not that much. The Dow&#39;s up 30,
[210.239s] NASDAQ&#39;s up 34. Tom Hayes joins me now.
[213.28s] He&#39;s looking at the markets for us. You
[215.12s] think the markets will go higher, make
[216.879s] new highs this summer?
[219.68s] Well, Stu, I got good news for you. We
[221.68s] are going to push to new highs. And all
[223.92s] that means is we&#39;re catching up with the
[225.84s] rest of the world. Many indices around
[227.68s] the world have hit new highs. That means
[229.76s] we could push over 6150 by midsummer
[233.28s] before we get to the normal fall uh
[235.84s] volatility and chop. And and the reason
[237.84s] is uh a couple things. First off, the
[240.159s] bar is set very low for earnings for Q2.
[242.959s] They&#39;ve taken it down from 9.3% at the
[245.92s] end of March uh to just 6% right now. We
[248.959s] did the exact same thing in Q1. We beat
[252.319s] expectations. They were expected to grow
[254.159s] 6%. They grew 13%. That&#39;s a good thing.
[256.88s] Then you got all the trap bears who sold
[259.04s] in the hole. They didn&#39;t believe that
[260.479s] Trump would pull this off. Well, we just
[262.16s] got the biggest deal announced today
[264.0s] with China. So, this is a very
[265.84s] constructive thing for earnings, for
[267.759s] expectation, and for guidance. Remember,
[270.08s] guidance was very cautious in Q1. I
[272.32s] think CEOs are going to get a lot more
[273.84s] confidence now they know the rules of
[275.84s] the road moving forward. Uh we just got
[278.08s] the uh couple of hours ago we got the
[280.08s] May consumer inflation report. Prices up
[282.8s] only 0.1%
[285.68s] in the month of May. Should the Fed
[288.639s] lower interest rates?
[291.12s] I think President Trump is correct. We
[293.36s] are going to have a situation of too
[295.68s] late Powell. They claim that they are
[297.84s] data dependent. They are prediction
[300.4s] dependent. They are predicting that
[302.639s] prices will go up from tariffs. Now we
[304.56s] know what tariffs are. It&#39;s simply not
[306.4s] going to be the case. We saw it in 2018.
[309.12s] And President Trump is calling for a one
[311.759s] percentage point cut. We&#39;re actually 150
[314.8s] basis points too restrictive, meaning
[317.68s] the Fed funds rate above the rate of
[320.0s] inflation. This is the fourth
[321.919s] consecutive month in a row inflation has
[324.0s] come in below expectations. It&#39;s time to
[327.039s] start cutting. There&#39;s a 68% chance. It
[329.44s] went up this morning of the first cut in
[331.68s] September. That probably needs to move
[333.52s] up to 80%. They should do 25 basis
[335.919s] points in June. They won&#39;t do it because
[338.0s] they&#39;re in the prediction business, not
[339.52s] the data business. They should be in the
[341.039s] data business do, but it&#39;s all going to
[343.28s] be okay. The economy is strong. If they
[345.44s] did do it, the market would be very
[347.44s] happy to see that a cut in rates in June
[350.08s] and July. Uh Tom Hayes, thanks for
[351.919s] joining us. See you again soon. Thanks
[353.68s] for having me. Still ahead, Trump&#39;s
[356.72s] and we&#39;re back. And then on Friday, I
[360.24s] had the pleasure to join Nicole
[363.6s] Pedalites on Schwab Network. Want to
[366.72s] thank old friend Alli Thompson for
[369.6s] putting me on. We covered a lot. Covered
[372.08s] three or four names in this and a key
[374.88s] theme going into the second half. So,
[376.72s] we&#39;ll listen in here. Welcome back to
[378.639s] the watch list. Our next guest, Thomas
[381.039s] J. Hayes, chairman and managing member
[382.96s] of Great Hill Capital joins me. actually
[385.12s] has some stock picks for your portfolio
[387.6s] as well. What did you think of the week
[389.6s] that was? I do want to talk about some
[391.28s] of the earnings that you had on your
[393.28s] radar for different reasons, but how do
[395.6s] you think markets behaving?
[398.319s] Yeah, I think this market wants to push
[399.919s] higher, Nicole. I I think you have still
[402.96s] a lot of trap bears who sold at the
[405.52s] exact wrong time in the beginning of
[407.28s] April. Over a trillion dollars of hedge
[409.84s] fund and CTA money got flushed the day
[412.4s] before Trump put out his tweet. now is a
[414.72s] good time to buy. So, every bit of good
[417.68s] news, and we&#39;ve had good news, 13.3%
[421.199s] earnings growth for the quarter with 98%
[423.759s] of the companies that had reported. Uh,
[426.8s] that&#39;s that&#39;s up instead of
[428.479s] expectations. We&#39;re at 6%. And we&#39;re
[431.36s] going into the next quarter with
[432.8s] reasonable expectations. So, I think on
[435.12s] balance, this market wants to push
[437.039s] higher. The jobs report uh was
[439.759s] interesting considering the beige book
[441.68s] talked about a slowdown in uh labor
[443.919s] demand and a slowing in the economy. Uh
[446.639s] I think that kind of surprised the
[448.24s] market to the upside to see some
[449.759s] strength. But the trend is down. The Fed
[451.919s] will still be in the market cutting at
[453.68s] the back half of the year. Right now it
[455.68s] just seems unclear whether it&#39;s going to
[457.199s] be one cut or two cut. You still have a
[460.319s] 63%
[461.919s] chance of one cut in September. So I
[465.36s] think a lot of lot of good stuff and a
[467.199s] lot of powder on the sidelines. So as
[469.52s] this thing pushes higher, people are
[471.199s] going to be forced in and particularly
[472.72s] those who sold low, missed the recovery
[475.759s] and now have to chase uh to to save
[478.319s] their careers.
[480.24s] Understood. Um yeah, if you sold in
[482.8s] April, you were not happy today. That&#39;s
[485.36s] true. At the bottom, right, you only
[486.96s] lose money until you actually sell. You
[489.12s] have a few names like Lululemon and
[491.28s] Broadcom on your radar as far as
[493.52s] earnings. What story do they tell? Well,
[496.8s] Lulu, uh, I think the surprise there was
[499.52s] that they were blaming the economy,
[501.44s] saying that US consumers are being
[503.919s] cautious and intentional. Uh, that&#39;s,
[507.68s] uh, that seems a little suspicious in
[510.96s] the sense that, uh, you&#39;re seeing a
[512.88s] tremendous amount of competition from
[515.44s] Aloe, from Athleta, from other companies
[518.24s] coming to bear. So, they&#39;re blaming the
[519.919s] economy, they&#39;re blaming the consumer.
[521.839s] Their com store sales were up 1%
[524.159s] year-on-year, which was a little bit
[525.6s] anemic. And they brought their guidance
[527.519s] midpoint down from, you know, $155
[530.8s] of earnings this year down to$,468.
[534.0s] So, the market didn&#39;t like it. It
[535.839s] flushed it down 20%. This is a high
[538.32s] quality business, but the concern is
[540.56s] that they&#39;re they&#39;re now saying they&#39;re
[542.32s] going to raise prices due to the tariffs
[545.6s] and that&#39;s going to impact their margins
[547.68s] by 110 basis points for the full year.
[550.32s] So declining margins, slow comps uh
[554.08s] yearon year and the market just
[556.56s] completely flushed it out. As it relates
[558.24s] to Avago, uh yeah, they beat as well,
[561.279s] but uh the guidance was less than uh
[564.64s] very high expectations and it was a sell
[566.64s] the news event. It had rallied 30% into
[570.32s] into the print. So people took some
[572.959s] profits. Uh the AI related business was
[575.6s] up 46%. The non AI related business was
[579.12s] a little bit anemic. People were a
[581.04s] little bit concerned about that. Uh free
[583.92s] cash flow still strong, buyback still
[586.08s] strong, but the stock taking a breather.
[588.959s] Yeah, understood. So right now if I look
[591.92s] at AVGO, Broadcom, uh it is trading down
[595.519s] about 4%. But has been a winner. One
[598.399s] year up 87% and just in one month up
[601.2s] 22%. You have names that you like. Alber
[604.56s] Marorrow, QXO, Stanley Black &amp; Decker,
[607.76s] and also Generrack. Um, is there a theme
[610.24s] between these picks or are they uh each
[612.48s] have their own story? Well, I&#39;m known as
[615.44s] turnaround Tom, so I like I like
[617.6s] businesses that are out of favor that
[619.279s] are going going to recover. Uh,
[621.36s] materials is expected to have the second
[623.519s] highest earnings growth in 2026. We want
[626.399s] to get positioned ahead of time. They&#39;re
[627.76s] going to have 17% earnings growth.
[629.519s] Albamaro big player number one uh top
[632.24s] lithium producer in the world lowest
[634.399s] cost producer some of their mines in
[636.16s] Chile uh and uh and lithium is a very
[639.36s] cyclical business you see it throughout
[640.8s] the years even before EVs they have
[644.0s] ample liquidity to make it through the
[646.24s] over supply in the short term which we
[648.72s] expect to rebalance in mid 2026 the
[652.32s] operating leverage in this business is
[654.32s] second to none once lithium rebalances
[656.48s] as the smaller players shut down
[658.079s] production
[659.279s] Albamaro is going to be the big winner
[661.76s] and as we&#39;re going to see demand from
[664.56s] 1.2 million metric tons last year to 3.2
[669.36s] million 5 years out uh they&#39;re going to
[672.64s] win. The whole EV story is all China.
[675.36s] It&#39;s an unnatural subsidized government
[677.839s] market uh in EVs. There&#39;s 60% of global
[681.04s] EVs. That is not going to stop anytime
[683.68s] soon. The Chinese government&#39;s going to
[685.68s] keep pushing EV, which is going to
[688.24s] benefit Albamaro as their competition
[690.48s] goes out of business. They&#39;ll be last
[691.839s] man standing, and they&#39;re going to mint
[693.519s] money like it&#39;s going out of style. This
[695.76s] stock uh is down huge. It can be up
[699.12s] double to triple over the next 3 to four
[701.2s] years. Uh we think this is a huge out of
[703.68s] favor cyclical opportunity that this
[706.16s] happens every 5 to 8 years and we are
[709.2s] buying it at the trough. uh as it
[711.92s] relates to housing also out of favor.
[714.079s] Why? Because of higher rates. Rates are
[716.24s] going to come down. Why? Bessent is
[719.36s] focused on the SLR. He&#39;s going to reduce
[723.76s] capital requirements uh which will
[726.0s] create an enormous amount of demand by
[728.72s] banks for treasuries. Uh they&#39;ll be back
[732.0s] in the market in a big way. And then you
[734.48s] have the Genius and he said that&#39;ll
[736.56s] lower 10-year yields which is what
[738.48s] mortgage rates are based on by anywhere
[741.12s] from 30 to 70 basis points. Then you
[743.92s] have the Genius Act. Stable coins could
[746.24s] be approved where you&#39;re going to see
[748.16s] right now the market for stable coins
[749.839s] which are backed by US treasuries is
[752.24s] about 250 billion. that could go up to 2
[755.68s] trillion over time, creating 2 trillion
[758.24s] of new demand for treasuries, which will
[761.12s] bring yields down on top of it. So, uh,
[764.639s] so that&#39;s going to be very positive
[766.16s] because mortgage rates are priced off
[767.76s] the 10 years. So, I think the second
[769.12s] half you&#39;re going to see a 30-year fixed
[772.16s] mortgage. You can you can time stamp
[774.399s] this. We&#39;re going to see a 30-year fixed
[776.079s] mortgage below 6% before the end of the
[778.8s] year. And animal spirits are going to be
[780.8s] back. new housing starts, the federal
[782.88s] lands are opening up from this
[784.48s] administration. It&#39;s going to create a
[785.92s] lot of land, believe it or not, in
[787.44s] metropolitan areas uh to uh bridge the 3
[792.8s] to four million unit housing der uh in
[796.72s] the US and the huge demand from
[798.399s] millennials. So, how do we play it? We
[800.399s] don&#39;t want to play the waring factions.
[801.76s] We don&#39;t want to play the homebuilders
[802.959s] that are going to be producing and race
[805.2s] to the bottom as their margins contract
[807.279s] as they fight each other on price. We
[809.68s] want to take advantage of the arms
[812.16s] dealers uh like QXO which is Brad Jacobs
[815.36s] company. It&#39;s a building supply rollup.
[817.04s] They started with Beacon Roofing. He
[818.959s] paid 11 times IBIDA. He&#39;s going to
[820.8s] double IBIDA over the next uh uh couple
[823.6s] of years through implementing technology
[825.68s] like he always does. Do a roll up. If
[828.0s] you follow what he did in XBO Logistics,
[831.36s] you made 50ome times your money. If you
[833.68s] follow what he did in United Rentals,
[835.44s] you made 70 times your money. I think
[837.6s] this is going to be a five or six bagger
[839.44s] over the next five to seven years. Uh
[842.079s] even from these levels and even today,
[844.16s] Wolf Research was out upgrading the
[846.079s] stock. It&#39;s whatever it is, 178 bucks up
[849.04s] to $44. Uh we think that&#39;s a little
[852.32s] premature, but it&#39;s definitely going to
[854.079s] get there and more over the next few
[856.0s] years. Then you got Stanley Black &amp;
[858.16s] Decker. If you&#39;re going to build houses,
[859.44s] you need tools, Craftsman, Stanley,
[861.76s] DeWalt, etc. They have been uh
[865.04s] recovering margins after the COVID
[867.36s] overstock. They&#39;ve detocked. Now they&#39;re
[870.0s] restocking, increasing margins. The last
[872.24s] time they got margins up to the level
[874.48s] that uh management is guiding by 2027.
[877.519s] They earned $8 a share in earnings. The
[879.92s] stock traded north of 150. Right now, I
[882.16s] think it&#39;s trading at $65. So, there&#39;s
[884.24s] huge upside over the next three years.
[886.32s] And then finally, is Generrack way to
[888.48s] play the housing recovery. also interest
[891.279s] rate sensitive because a lot of people
[893.68s] uh finance uh home standby generators.
[896.8s] They&#39;ve got 75% of the market. They are
[899.36s] going to fly. Uh this stock is still
[902.079s] down 75% even though it&#39;s generating
[905.279s] record free cash flow. Revenues are
[908.72s] recovering. Their commercial and
[910.56s] industrial business is improving.
[912.399s] They&#39;re going to be a lot of backup
[914.32s] energy and storage for data centers.
[917.519s] That&#39;s going to be a monstrous business
[919.6s] in addition to the home standby and
[921.519s] we&#39;re entering hurricane season. So, uh,
[924.48s] other than that, how was the play, Mrs.
[926.24s] Lincoln? We&#39;ve got a lot of stuff here
[927.6s] for you, Nicole. All right. You really
[930.48s] do. And turnaround, Tom. That&#39;s a good
[932.639s] nickname. And it&#39;s t would fun taking a
[934.72s] look at those key names, too, of Albert
[936.8s] Marl, QXO, Stanley Black &amp; Decker,
[938.72s] Generrack, and more. Thank you, Thomas
[941.04s] J. Hayes, chairman and managing member
[943.04s] of Great Hill Capital. Thank you, Tom.
[945.6s] Coming up,
[947.519s] And we&#39;re back. Uh then I want to thank
[950.72s] my oldtime friend who gave me my first
[953.92s] break on TV, Ellie Terret. She was a
[957.199s] producer, NYC floor producer for the
[959.44s] Clayman Countdown, put me on for the
[961.6s] first time in uh 2019. Now she is the
[966.8s] crypto cat queen. She always posts
[969.12s] pictures of all of the um cats she
[972.72s] saves. and she is doing an incredible
[975.839s] podcast, Crypto in America. She hosts
[977.92s] all the major crypto events. She is the
[980.079s] go-to in that space. And she quoted me
[982.72s] in her article on stable coins this
[985.839s] week. Uh you can follow Ellie on
[988.72s] Twitter. Uh if you don&#39;t already do it,
[991.519s] if you have any interests in crypto or
[994.32s] digital assets, uh she is the follow.
[997.519s] Just put in Eleanor Terret Tet.
[1000.8s] It&#39;ll come up. Uh then finally want to
[1004.0s] thank Sam Clark and Hannah Mulain for
[1006.8s] having me on uh the BBC World Business
[1010.639s] Report with Rohan. It was more general
[1013.04s] questions about Elon Musk and about
[1015.36s] Disney&#39;s lawsuit against the AI company
[1018.56s] uh and such. So there&#39;s nothing really
[1020.079s] actionable. So you can listen to that on
[1021.839s] your own if you want to hear me talk
[1023.199s] general news. Have at it. And then uh
[1026.4s] quotes of the week, Warren Buffett.
[1028.16s] Whether we&#39;re talking about socks or
[1030.079s] stocks, I like buying quality
[1032.079s] merchandise when it&#39;s marked down. No
[1034.72s] question that&#39;s what we do here every
[1036.24s] week on Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes.
[1039.039s] Uh, also Buffett says, &quot;We enjoy the
[1041.199s] process far more than the proceeds. If I
[1044.799s] remembered that as much in golf as I did
[1047.199s] in investing, I&#39;d be a lot more
[1049.039s] successful in golf. Uh, but uh, it comes
[1052.559s] and goes. I I had a a tough round this
[1054.88s] week, but uh coming off a couple weeks
[1057.679s] that were a bit stronger. So, we&#39;ll see.
[1059.679s] I think all the pieces are there. We got
[1061.679s] to just get that break in 80 done. I
[1063.6s] know those of you who&#39;ve been following
[1064.799s] along the trying to do that for about a
[1066.96s] year. Let&#39;s see if I can get it done
[1068.4s] this summer. Uh Rob, are not in
[1070.4s] investing. What&#39;s comfortable is rarely
[1072.559s] profitable. So, we&#39;re going to talk
[1073.84s] about some of that this week. Also want
[1075.919s] to acknowledge
[1077.76s] um a lot of you had asked for merch for
[1079.76s] hedge fund tips, the super fans who have
[1081.44s] been with us for six months, a year, two
[1083.52s] years, three years, four years. Uh and
[1085.76s] the response has been overwhelming.
[1087.44s] Thank you for the orders. Uh a little
[1089.039s] bit more koi with the photos. So when uh
[1091.679s] people do send in photos, we want to
[1093.52s] acknowledge them and you can see them
[1095.36s] right here when you click on uh number
[1097.919s] one hedge fund podcast. Also, while
[1099.679s] you&#39;re there, click on terms. This is
[1101.039s] all opinion, not advice. Consult your
[1103.52s] financial adviser before doing doing
[1105.28s] anything. Uh, and a couple new ones we
[1107.52s] haven&#39;t covered. John Martin, uh, great
[1109.919s] picture with his mug right there. Love
[1112.0s] it. Price is what you pay. Value is what
[1114.08s] you get. Uh, and, um, and I think we
[1118.48s] covered, uh, Mike last week in front of
[1121.039s] the Van Store and a lot of great others
[1122.88s] over the over the past weeks. So, uh,
[1126.08s] wanted to cover uh, data. Now, QXO, a
[1129.679s] lot of companies have been coming out.
[1131.2s] We&#39;ve been pounding the table. Did we
[1132.88s] get it? We didn&#39;t get in on the private
[1134.32s] deal at eight or nine bucks, but we did
[1136.24s] get in at 13 bucks uh a while back.
[1139.12s] People were very skeptical because we
[1140.72s] paid a premium to cash. Now it&#39;s uh
[1142.96s] almost getting close to a uh well, not a
[1145.76s] double yet, but it&#39;s uh uh up 65% in the
[1149.52s] last two months. Uh now, uh Beard was
[1152.96s] out. Wolf Wolf came out and upgraded it
[1155.039s] to $44 a share. Uh it&#39;s currently just
[1158.24s] over 20. Now be bar came out at $32 a
[1161.2s] share for all the reasons that we&#39;ve
[1162.88s] been saying for months uh and both when
[1166.16s] it was at 13 then it went down to 11
[1168.48s] against us going back to Mr. R not what
[1172.4s] is comfortable is rarely profitable. So,
[1175.039s] you say, &quot;Well, what&#39;s the big deal? You
[1176.32s] bought it at 13, it went to 11, but now
[1178.08s] it&#39;s over 20.&quot; Uh, and it&#39;s going to
[1180.16s] 100, by the way, over the next handful
[1181.679s] of years. But, um,
[1185.039s] uh, most people aren&#39;t willing to do
[1186.4s] that. You know, they they don&#39;t they
[1187.919s] don&#39;t know what they own, so they set
[1189.2s] their 8% stop-loss and they miss all the
[1191.52s] multibaggers, guaranteed. So, uh, so
[1194.32s] that&#39;s that. And then, um, let&#39;s go to
[1197.44s] some of the sloomer slides from RBC.
[1202.64s] By the way, the 10-year yield today, I
[1204.24s] think, was down to 436. So, it&#39;s moving
[1206.24s] in the direction we&#39;ve been talking
[1207.52s] about in line with the housing theme,
[1209.52s] which we&#39;re going to spend more in the
[1210.799s] article of the week. So, uh this is just
[1213.36s] a couple days old. It&#39;s already stale.
[1214.88s] 479 to uh 436 or something and change. I
[1219.039s] just looked at it and uh and that&#39;s
[1221.919s] going to help a lot of our positioning
[1223.6s] and what we&#39;re set up for. Here&#39;s the
[1225.76s] all-time highs, 6147. And as I said with
[1228.72s] Vanney, we are going to likely exceed
[1231.52s] those before the end of the summer. If
[1234.0s] we take a couple week break here, a
[1235.679s] little chop in the meantime, don&#39;t lose
[1237.679s] sleep over it. There are so many trap
[1240.48s] bears that&#39;s going to force this thing
[1242.08s] up to new highs. And then in the fall,
[1244.159s] maybe we&#39;ll get a little chop. But for
[1245.679s] now, uh, when the when the music is
[1248.64s] playing, get up and dance. And we&#39;ve
[1250.32s] been certainly dancing this quarter like
[1251.919s] nobody&#39;s business. And been super happy
[1254.159s] about that. And kudos to all of you who
[1256.72s] came in when we said to come in and all
[1258.559s] the existing who said to who added money
[1260.64s] when we had to add when we told you to
[1262.72s] add money uh which was the first time in
[1264.64s] two years that we said add money now.
[1266.64s] And I will say uh as much as you look at
[1269.679s] the portfolio and see all your positions
[1271.84s] up uh and smile so wide you could eat a
[1274.4s] banana sideways year to date uh and
[1277.44s] certainly and quarter to date. um uh go
[1281.919s] through each of the names and you&#39;ll
[1283.44s] just see how much more opportunity is
[1284.96s] yet to come. It&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s literally
[1286.72s] just getting started. So, um all right.
[1290.32s] So, that&#39;s more on the S&amp;P small caps.
[1292.799s] This is going to be the next money big
[1294.64s] money maker. Already made a big move off
[1296.32s] the bottom. This is also going to break
[1298.32s] to new highs. And then once it does,
[1300.08s] you&#39;re going to get yourself a measured
[1301.44s] move, which would be another 800 points
[1303.44s] to 3,200 on the minimum. This is now
[1305.919s] where the opportunity is. Skate to where
[1307.6s] the puck&#39;s going. highest short interest
[1309.28s] in history. Get yourself some small
[1311.28s] caps, ladies and gentlemen. Uh and uh
[1313.919s] and they&#39;re going to rock. Um oil&#39;s
[1316.08s] starting to get some bubbly. We continue
[1318.159s] to see comtock resources, which you guys
[1320.96s] all got in with us at 8 and $9 now at 25
[1324.24s] and change. It&#39;s still got room. It&#39;ll
[1326.159s] probably take a breather in the next few
[1327.52s] weeks, but don&#39;t be phased out. The
[1329.28s] intrinsic value is higher and we&#39;re
[1331.52s] excited about that one. Moving along,
[1335.2s] Goldman Sachs equity sentiment indicator
[1337.919s] is still subdued. There&#39;s still light
[1340.0s] positioning. There&#39;s still going to be
[1341.36s] people forced in or career risk. They
[1343.76s] sold at the lows. They&#39;re going to have
[1345.12s] to continue to buy up. I like this chart
[1347.52s] from Allstart Charts. If small caps are
[1349.6s] about to enter a fresh period of
[1350.799s] outperformance, wouldn&#39;t this be a
[1352.4s] logical place to start? Historically,
[1354.32s] every major bull run this century saw
[1355.919s] small caps lead, usually nearing the
[1358.24s] beginning. Take a look. And again, we&#39;ve
[1361.039s] emphasized so much over the last 6 to9
[1363.679s] months, the the parallels to 2001
[1370.4s] to take advantage of. And now if you
[1372.88s] look at small caps versus large caps at
[1375.2s] this extreme multi-standard deviation
[1377.84s] move in relative relative undervaluation
[1382.72s] and I&#39;m telling you if you missed
[1384.64s] everything and you were skeptical of the
[1386.48s] trade and you got shaken out by the
[1388.159s] tariffs uh because you weren&#39;t listening
[1390.32s] to the podcast when we said buy
[1391.919s] everything uh eight weeks ago uh or six
[1395.679s] whatever it was the beginning of April
[1398.32s] then uh you still have opportunity. I
[1401.36s] mean, we&#39;ve had existing
[1404.24s] new money come in materially and new
[1407.2s] clients uh are able to send in money
[1409.039s] whenever they want and they do uh just
[1411.679s] recently and I had no problem putting
[1414.72s] lots of money to work uh even at these
[1417.52s] levels because it&#39;s not the general
[1420.24s] indices. We&#39;re not in the MAG seven. So
[1422.559s] even if you say well it&#39;s overvalued uh
[1426.48s] it the the names that we love will be
[1428.799s] overvalued in 12 to 24 months they are
[1431.679s] opportunities of
[1434.559s] a generation right now. Even though they
[1436.88s] a lot of them have moved up off the
[1438.4s] bottom. They&#39;re nowhere near intrinsic
[1440.4s] value. So if you&#39;re sitting on your
[1442.159s] hands or you&#39;ve had liquidity events,
[1444.4s] get after it. This is not a time to
[1446.159s] snooze because uh the train is leaving
[1448.64s] the station for for damn sure um in in
[1451.44s] an aggressive way. Uh next, monthly
[1454.24s] average returns based on whether the
[1456.159s] dollar increased or decreased in value
[1457.919s] that month by various asset classes. So
[1460.4s] you can see
[1462.799s] in a dollar down month, value did really
[1465.919s] well, small caps did really well,
[1467.919s] international did really well,
[1469.12s] commodities, emerging markets, etc. And
[1472.48s] that&#39;s what we are focused on. The
[1474.24s] dollar continues to weaken. For those of
[1475.76s] you who&#39;ve been with us for over a year,
[1477.52s] you know, we&#39;ve been saying it&#39;s coming
[1478.96s] and here it is. It&#39;s it&#39;s come in a
[1480.72s] major way. Emerging markets just
[1482.64s] starting to take off. We&#39;re excited. Uh
[1485.279s] we expect the US power markets to get
[1487.52s] critically tight over the next few
[1488.96s] years. That helps our com stock
[1490.4s] resources. S&amp;P 500 companies with next
[1493.44s] 12 months earnings growth
[1496.08s] above 25%. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I
[1499.44s] hate to say it, only one magnificent
[1502.64s] seven company fits in that list, which
[1506.799s] means if you are overweight, just
[1508.72s] indices or passive investing or MAG 7,
[1512.0s] you are going to underperform. We had
[1513.84s] been warning about that for a while.
[1515.84s] Yes, they will trade back up to the top
[1517.6s] of the range. No, they will not
[1519.6s] dramatically outperform that because
[1522.0s] their earnings growth is collapsing from
[1524.4s] 27% in Q1 of this year to 10.2%. 2% in
[1528.4s] Q1 of next year. Unmagnificent 497 going
[1532.0s] from negative to a unmagnificent 493,
[1535.76s] i.e. the rest of the S&amp;P that&#39;s not
[1537.76s] magnificent 7 is going to exceed the
[1540.559s] earnings growth of MAG 7 for the first
[1544.0s] time by Q1 of next year. So basically
[1547.36s] two more quarters out. The other 493
[1551.12s] will have higher earnings growth than
[1553.279s] the MAG 7 and trading at half the
[1555.52s] multiple. you want. That&#39;s where you
[1557.6s] want to be. That&#39;s where tons of doubles
[1559.679s] and triples are going to be made and
[1561.6s] you&#39;re going to participate. Uh
[1563.679s] scheduled additions of solar, wind, and
[1565.44s] natural gas effective power generation
[1567.12s] capacity in Mid-Atlantic reading re
[1569.36s] region are not expected to offset coal
[1573.279s] and other retirements while power demand
[1576.08s] is expected to grow significantly. What
[1578.24s] does that help? Natural gas. What does
[1580.32s] that help? Generrack backup generators.
[1583.6s] Not to mention the the uh different
[1585.84s] climate events and hurricanes and
[1587.52s] everything that else that&#39;s happening
[1589.52s] that uh requires and the old unstable
[1593.52s] um
[1595.52s] the old
[1599.12s] unstable grid. So
[1604.48s] monthly payroll growth uh you saw past
[1608.0s] revisions downward. The key is to look
[1610.159s] at the trend. The trend continues to go
[1612.08s] lower. the Fed will have to cut. I
[1614.159s] continue to think we&#39;ll be two times
[1616.559s] this year down 50 basis points plus what
[1619.2s] Besson&#39;s going to do on the long end of
[1620.72s] the curve which we&#39;re going to cover
[1621.84s] later.
[1625.279s] Uh this is interesting. More and more
[1627.52s] firms are upgrading Baba now. HSBC
[1630.08s] Global Research published a report
[1631.52s] stating that the Ministry of Commerce&#39;s
[1633.12s] International Trade and Economic
[1634.32s] Cooperation Research Institute estimates
[1636.48s] that by 2030, instant shopping will
[1638.559s] bring a domestic incremental market
[1640.88s] opportunity of 2 trillion yuan. Alibaba
[1644.799s] plans to actively expand its market
[1646.559s] share, fully leveraging the strong
[1648.08s] relationships between Taoba and brands
[1649.919s] and merchants. Alme&#39;s delivery network
[1651.919s] and algorithms, as well as thirdparty
[1653.6s] operational data. Ellie May and Tao have
[1655.919s] achieved 40 million daily orders for
[1659.2s] food and other instant retail compared
[1661.44s] to JD&#39;s only $25 million daily orders.
[1665.44s] The firm maintains Alibaba buy rating
[1668.159s] and target price of $176.
[1671.6s] That&#39;s just for starters. Once we hit
[1673.6s] 176, they&#39;ll be taking their price
[1675.12s] targets up to $225 plus. Median S&amp;P
[1678.72s] stock short interest as a percentage of
[1680.799s] market cap is elevated. You can see here
[1683.76s] at 2.4%.
[1686.159s] Uh so that&#39;s going to be continue to be
[1688.399s] more pain. At the lows, no one was
[1690.24s] short. At the highs, uh excuse me, at
[1694.559s] yeah, at the lows during CO, no one was
[1696.559s] short. This is this is moving up
[1700.799s] and uh very similar thing you saw after
[1703.36s] the 2000 trough and you had a massive
[1706.559s] bull market in
[1709.279s] uh um small caps international
[1713.36s] and value overgrowth during that period.
[1716.24s] Again, just one more data point in the
[1719.76s] mosaic that we&#39;ve been covering for 6
[1721.679s] months, pointing to what&#39;s already
[1724.64s] started to happen, which we had said
[1726.48s] when was unpopular, international would
[1728.88s] dramatically outperform
[1731.039s] uh uh domestic
[1733.52s] that has happened in spades year to
[1735.36s] date. And value would start to
[1737.039s] outperform growth. That is happening.
[1739.52s] And small cap will start to outperform
[1741.44s] large. That is on its way. if you missed
[1744.08s] the first two trains. 4-week average in
[1747.12s] share buybacks versus the S&amp;P 500. You
[1750.08s] can see share buybacks nearing a record
[1752.72s] uh announcements at a record. And this
[1755.44s] is stuff that you start to see off
[1756.96s] troughs like you did in uh 2020.
[1762.24s] And then again following the lows in
[1764.799s] 2022
[1766.48s] when you couldn&#39;t give away Amazon and
[1768.559s] Google. We were buying it uh hand over
[1770.96s] fist. Those were easy doubles. And uh
[1773.76s] now we&#39;re seeing it again after the most
[1775.84s] recent tariff trough and people are
[1778.24s] skeptical the entire way up. They will
[1780.08s] be skeptical this whole way up. Next
[1782.159s] stop after we hit I think I think we&#39;ll
[1784.159s] probably hit new highs before we get the
[1785.919s] next major pullback. We&#39;ll get everyone
[1787.84s] sucked in at 6150 probably towards the
[1790.48s] end of July and then August and
[1792.559s] September will probably rip back down
[1794.399s] below 6,000 to scare the hell out of
[1796.399s] everyone before a fourth quarter final
[1798.48s] rally. Uh dollar performance continues
[1802.08s] to weaken both structurally and
[1804.799s] seasonally. That&#39;s going to continue
[1806.399s] through summer. That should continue to
[1808.399s] help emerging markets. Corporate
[1810.88s] buybacks yearto-date share repurchase
[1814.08s] program authorized 717 billion. We&#39;ve
[1817.919s] never seen anything like it. Continued
[1820.559s] bid in the market. Global equities
[1823.76s] allocation and flows. China is starting
[1826.88s] to now tick up from dispondency to
[1831.2s] apathy and from apathy we&#39;ll go to uh
[1834.64s] comfort and from comfort will go to
[1837.12s] euphoria and we&#39;re we&#39;re probably 18
[1840.48s] months out from euphoria. Earnings
[1842.799s] growth estimates are soaring for Chinese
[1846.0s] stocks, not for US stocks. Look at this.
[1848.88s] And if you&#39;re listening versus watching,
[1850.72s] I strongly urge you to go to the
[1852.24s] YouTube.com, type in hedge fund tips,
[1854.399s] and pull up episode 295 so you can see
[1856.96s] all these charts and visualize what I&#39;m
[1859.12s] talking about here. Uh,
[1862.32s] revisions to forward 12-month earnings
[1864.32s] per share. China Tech is off the charts,
[1867.12s] 15%, US anemic at half a percent.
[1872.08s] Central banks cut rate at fastest pace
[1874.32s] in 2025 last month. That is global
[1877.279s] liquidity. You&#39;re seeing uh money supply
[1879.84s] now retake M2 money supply is now higher
[1884.399s] than it was in uh April 2022. It took
[1889.76s] three years to get back up to increasing
[1892.559s] money supply. That&#39;s liquidity. Stocks
[1895.12s] are going higher
[1902.799s] and um and the US will follow suit. Too
[1905.76s] late. Powell
[1908.0s] uh is probably going to be too late, but
[1909.76s] they&#39;ll catch up. So why I, by the way,
[1912.48s] I loved what President Trump said today.
[1914.24s] He go, you know, he he he laid out the
[1916.399s] reasons why Powell should cut a full 100
[1919.519s] basis points. I&#39;ve been saying that
[1921.6s] they&#39;re 150 basis points too
[1923.519s] restrictive, above the inflation rate,
[1926.32s] which you saw both the PPI and the CPI
[1928.559s] come in below expectations for the
[1930.64s] fourth consecutive month in a row. And
[1934.08s] Trump talked about the $300 billion of
[1936.159s] interest savings for every hundred basis
[1937.76s] points or whatever whatever it is. Um
[1940.48s] and that probably, you know, gets you a
[1942.32s] lot further than the Doge cuts. Uh but
[1944.799s] the second thing he said is lower them.
[1946.88s] Now if you&#39;re you know be data
[1949.519s] dependent, not prediction dependent. And
[1952.24s] if and if you&#39;re right and inflation
[1954.399s] does go back up, just raise them. You
[1956.24s] know, it&#39;s much easier to fight off
[1958.08s] inflation than deflation. Deflation is a
[1960.399s] spiral you can&#39;t break. And once it
[1962.0s] starts, it&#39;s very very hard to
[1963.44s] restimulate and costs a lot of money.
[1965.679s] But inflation, if you&#39;re wrong and you,
[1968.48s] let&#39;s say he cut 50 basis points and uh
[1971.919s] the tariffs kick in and inflation goes
[1974.159s] up to 3 and a half%. And they wait a few
[1977.039s] months and it&#39;s not coming down, then
[1978.96s] just raise rates 50 basis points. It&#39;s
[1981.039s] not a big deal. It&#39;s it&#39;s much different
[1983.919s] than if
[1985.84s] inflation goes negative. Then you&#39;re
[1987.44s] toast. Then you can&#39;t bring back that
[1989.279s] sentiment. you can&#39;t bring that back
[1990.799s] that confidence and it&#39;s years of lost
[1993.2s] jobs and etc. And if you look at that
[1995.36s] unemployment trend uh or the jobs
[1998.399s] creation trend is is going down and it&#39;s
[2001.279s] better to get ahead of the curve because
[2002.64s] of the lag of the uh activation
[2005.76s] mechanism after you take the action
[2007.519s] takes 6 to9 months. So, retail purchases
[2010.64s] of Mag 7. Interestingly enough, retail
[2015.279s] has been right since CO
[2018.24s] and um
[2024.159s] interested to see they were buyers in
[2026.559s] the hole at the end of 2022
[2033.519s] and they&#39;re not buyers now. And I think
[2035.36s] they&#39;re right. I think you get a trade
[2037.2s] to the top of the range for Mag 7.
[2038.96s] Everything else is going to be where the
[2040.0s] money&#39;s made. Small small size
[2042.0s] consistently outperforms in June. So,
[2043.84s] we&#39;ll see if we get follow through on
[2045.279s] the small caps. Share of first-time home
[2047.519s] buyers has declined from 50% to
[2049.28s] currently 24%. And that&#39;s what Powell
[2051.359s] doesn&#39;t get. Powell&#39;s being very
[2052.96s] narcissistic in his decision not to cut
[2056.48s] because he quote doesn&#39;t want to be
[2058.48s] Arthur Burn. So, he&#39;s struggling with
[2060.399s] his recency bias when it&#39;s comparing
[2062.8s] apples to oranges and the conditions and
[2064.56s] the dem demography are completely
[2066.399s] different than the 1970s when Arthur
[2069.119s] Burns was operating. And he&#39;s so
[2071.76s] concerned about his legacy that he&#39;s
[2073.679s] completely screwing over 75 million
[2076.72s] millennials who are trying to start a
[2078.32s] life and can&#39;t afford housing because of
[2080.56s] Jay Powell. because he screwed up so
[2082.56s] much on transitory. Now he&#39;s screwing so
[2085.119s] much on inflation is coming back that
[2088.159s] these people aren&#39;t able to buy starter
[2090.079s] homes until they&#39;re in their mid-4s and
[2092.0s] the poor kids have to grow up in
[2093.76s] apartments and condos versus running
[2095.599s] around on the lawn when they&#39;re 3, four,
[2097.2s] and 5 years old. So start thinking
[2099.599s] beyond yourself, Mr. Too late Powell,
[2102.32s] and start thinking about the bulk of the
[2104.24s] population who needs affordable housing.
[2107.52s] And the irony of what we&#39;re going to see
[2109.2s] this time, believe it or not, even if
[2111.2s] Powell doesn&#39;t do it, Besson&#39;s going to
[2112.72s] do it. And we&#39;re going to talk about
[2113.839s] how, is that when rates come down, okay,
[2118.16s] historically,
[2119.68s] houses almost trade like a bond. As
[2121.76s] rates come down, the prices go up. As uh
[2124.56s] rates go up, sometimes the prices come
[2126.48s] down.
[2128.0s] This time, I think it&#39;s going to be the
[2129.92s] opposite. As rates come down, you&#39;re
[2132.079s] going to see such an abundant supply hit
[2134.56s] the market all at once that houses are
[2137.119s] going to come down. So, not only is the
[2138.88s] interest payment going to come down and
[2140.32s] the mortgage rate going to be below 6%
[2142.4s] on the 30-year fix, but the amount of
[2144.88s] supply that&#39;s going to come on the
[2146.24s] market and the amount of building that
[2147.92s] and housing starts that&#39;s going to spur
[2150.48s] is really going to help out the
[2152.24s] millennials. And uh you know, I I&#39;ve
[2156.8s] already I&#39;m not a millennial. I know
[2159.04s] people say, &quot;I look young. I&#39;ve already
[2160.4s] got all the houses I want.&quot; I&#39;m talking
[2162.72s] about the economy. And if you want a
[2164.64s] healthy, growing job, massive economy,
[2168.48s] you want housing to do extremely well.
[2170.72s] And it just ain&#39;t going to do well until
[2172.96s] Powell gets his act together and starts
[2174.96s] one, two cuts and Besset will do what he
[2177.28s] has to do this summer. So, uh, hopefully
[2179.839s] this message lands because it&#39;s it&#39;s not
[2182.079s] about one person&#39;s legacy. It&#39;s about 75
[2184.24s] million people who need affordable
[2186.96s] housing to start families. amilies and
[2188.48s] if we don&#39;t have family formation, uh,
[2190.96s] this country is going to be like Europe
[2192.48s] in 10 years. So, uh, we got to rock and
[2194.48s] roll. And by the way, not to pick on one
[2197.119s] guy, we need immigration. Hello. Uh, we
[2200.88s] need legal immigration, but we need
[2203.2s] material immigration legally, but open
[2206.72s] and aggressive to keep the population
[2208.8s] growing, to keep our global hegemony,
[2211.359s] economic hegemony, and the American
[2213.44s] dream humming. The capitalist formula
[2215.44s] requires population growth. Uh, so if
[2218.24s] we&#39;re not going to get it from birth,
[2219.599s] let&#39;s get it from legal immigration.
[2222.56s] And if rates come down and people have
[2224.079s] hope they can start a family, maybe you
[2225.44s] will get it from birth as well, which is
[2226.88s] the best. Uh, one-year change in active
[2229.92s] housing inventory for sale.
[2232.64s] Uh, it&#39;s starting to come up. It will it
[2235.44s] will do better as uh different actions
[2239.2s] are taken that we&#39;ve discussed. Annual
[2240.88s] buyback executions are just about a
[2243.839s] trillion dollars year-on-year growth. 5%
[2248.0s] year-on-year growth. That&#39;s very, very
[2249.76s] constructive. Non-farm payroll growth.
[2252.88s] It was healthc care driving the bus in
[2254.72s] the most recent report. Realized and
[2256.72s] consensus EPS growth for select US
[2259.599s] equity indexes. This is another one you
[2261.839s] need to stop the recorder and go look on
[2263.92s] YouTube
[2265.68s] because the Russell 2000, everyone&#39;s
[2270.24s] looking in the rearview mirror at small
[2272.16s] caps which had negative 14% earnings
[2274.64s] growth last year. This year it&#39;s going
[2276.64s] to grow at 23% earnings growth versus
[2279.839s] the S&amp;P at 7% and the multiple is less
[2283.52s] on small caps than it is on large caps.
[2287.04s] And next year, 2026,
[2290.079s] small cap earnings are going to grow 37%
[2293.04s] compared to the S&amp;P at 14% and the MAG 7
[2297.52s] at 10.2%.
[2299.52s] So, uh, this is, you know, price is what
[2302.96s] you pay, value is what you get. If you
[2304.56s] can get 37% earnings growth for half the
[2307.76s] multiple of something growing at 10 or
[2311.28s] 14%, that&#39;s where you want to focus your
[2313.76s] efforts. just like 2001 through 2007.
[2316.32s] City earnings reversion index hit the
[2318.32s] highest since 2021 uh as of the last
[2321.04s] update through May 30th. So, we&#39;re
[2324.24s] starting to get positive revisions once
[2326.32s] again, which is typical during this
[2328.4s] seasonal part. Usually, you get the
[2329.76s] negative revisions through Q2 as we were
[2332.64s] talking about and then they start to
[2334.079s] inlect. Retail slowed down in May with
[2336.88s] the net monthly buying dropping to 23
[2340.96s] billion. So, they were buyers in the
[2342.96s] hole and they&#39;ve been right. Now,
[2344.72s] they&#39;re slowing their buying, but
[2346.079s] they&#39;re hodlers and uh and we concur.
[2348.8s] Welcome to a new bull market. More
[2351.599s] reasons for bulls to smile. New bull
[2353.44s] markets start 20% off bare or near bare
[2357.44s] lows. And what happened next? So, we&#39;ve
[2359.119s] just had that rally off the bottom. 12
[2361.28s] months out, you&#39;re up on average another
[2366.16s] 18.9%.
[2370.32s] firms are talking about the national
[2372.32s] reshoring initiative. We&#39;re seeing the
[2375.04s] manufacturing. So that&#39;s starting to
[2377.28s] come back. Um
[2384.16s] and
[2385.92s] that explains it. 69 degrees in here.
[2389.119s] Okay, moving along. Foreign investor net
[2391.359s] purchases of US equities.
[2395.2s] So that&#39;s gone down. And I think part of
[2397.52s] that has to do with the uh MAG 7. They
[2402.0s] were overcrowded in the same exact trade
[2404.88s] number one. And now they&#39;ve got currency
[2407.04s] risk because the dollar has been
[2408.64s] declining so quickly. So you&#39;re going to
[2410.96s] continue to see that outperformance. And
[2413.52s] that&#39;s one of the reasons
[2419.44s] on a micro level being out here in
[2422.0s] Orange County I&#39;ve been talking about. I
[2424.64s] think you&#39;re going to see the high-end
[2425.76s] start to get hit because that Chinese
[2428.48s] marginal bid
[2430.64s] that&#39;s been buying a ton of Orange
[2432.32s] County for the last few years while
[2434.32s] things have been bad in China. As China
[2436.88s] is starting to recover and you see the
[2438.8s] earnings growth and you see the markets
[2440.24s] starting to go up and you see uh the
[2442.64s] government changing their policies, the
[2444.88s] cost to get capital out is so high and
[2447.359s] the friction and the risk that while it
[2449.839s] was worth it in the last three or four
[2451.76s] years when the government was being
[2453.28s] irrational, now that the economy is
[2455.92s] growing again, the opportunities to earn
[2458.64s] and earnings growth are much higher
[2461.76s] that uh you&#39;re going to see that
[2464.16s] marginal bid into US real estate in
[2466.079s] Orange County uh probably collapse which
[2468.56s] is going to be an air pocket
[2471.119s] particularly at the highest end. I think
[2473.28s] the threes and fi and I know that sounds
[2475.04s] funny to say the threes and fives that
[2479.359s] the the smaller houses at three and five
[2481.52s] million in Orange County are will will
[2483.359s] be fine but the but the 15s and 20s I
[2486.24s] think we&#39;re going to start to see turn
[2488.079s] into sevens to tens uh over the next
[2491.2s] couple of years and that&#39;s going to
[2492.319s] create a lot of opportunity but uh S&amp;P
[2495.28s] intrayear declines versus calendar year
[2498.4s] returns turns.
[2504.319s] Okay. So you can see here
[2507.839s] despite average intraear drops of 14.1%
[2512.48s] and this year I think we have 20% annual
[2515.28s] returns were positive 34 out of 45
[2517.52s] years. Uh upside chasing evidence in
[2521.28s] Russell 2000 uh options. So, more of
[2526.0s] what we said was coming.
[2528.4s] Those who shorted in the hole, which was
[2530.079s] a trillion dollars worth, now have to
[2531.92s] chase up. Now they&#39;re trying to catch up
[2533.839s] with options. You can&#39;t make this stuff
[2535.839s] up. And when the dealers sell options,
[2537.44s] what do they have to do? They&#39;ve got to
[2538.8s] buy the underlying stock. And it creates
[2541.119s] a little bit of a gamma squeeze
[2542.72s] situation. Uh, and that&#39;s why I think we
[2545.52s] go to new highs before uh, you know, by
[2549.92s] mid to to late July.
[2552.8s] percent of Russell 2000 5 Russell 2000
[2556.319s] members above the 50-day moving average
[2558.8s] back to 80%. So we&#39;ve gone we&#39;ve gone
[2561.839s] through the mill now the game is on and
[2563.599s] people say well it&#39;s overbought. No no
[2564.96s] no no no when you see huge corrections
[2567.28s] like that you always see these
[2569.359s] overbought conditions continue for a
[2571.76s] long time after uh after the initial
[2575.2s] recovery and it&#39;s the the catch-up trade
[2578.24s] becomes so massive. We saw the exact
[2580.4s] same thing in COVID in 2020. Market
[2584.079s] traded back up. Everyone was waiting for
[2585.68s] a leg back down. It&#39;s overbought. It&#39;s
[2587.2s] overbought. It kept going for another
[2588.64s] year and a half. Um S&amp;P short interest a
[2592.56s] rocket ship higher. Multi-year highs
[2595.839s] with S&amp;P only 2% below all-time highs.
[2599.119s] Short interest represents future buying
[2600.8s] power with squeeze situations increasing
[2602.64s] during rallies. Melt up in S&amp;P should
[2604.88s] not be a surprise given short interest.
[2606.88s] So much for hedging. So there is uh from
[2609.68s] Seth Golden and you can see short
[2612.24s] interest exceeding the index here on the
[2615.119s] overlay and that is the formula for
[2617.28s] continuation higher just people caught
[2619.92s] on the wrong side of the boat. Consumer
[2621.52s] sentiment often diverges from consumer
[2624.16s] spending growth. So
[2630.64s] sentiment is at a trough just starting
[2632.64s] to turn up. Consumer momentum waines on
[2634.8s] falling gas prices and buying ahead
[2637.04s] pullback, buying ahead of tariffs. So
[2639.359s] maybe you&#39;ll see a little bit of Q2
[2641.119s] softness. Earnings estimates surpass
[2643.599s] prior highs back up to 280.
[2647.599s] So um we were 279 for the next 12 month
[2652.64s] projection uh right before the the
[2655.68s] liberation day. Then it collapsed down
[2658.4s] to 277. Now it&#39;s back up to 280 for 12
[2661.76s] month forward. So, back at a record
[2663.68s] high. That&#39;s positive. Buybacks continue
[2665.839s] to go up. Um, after two-month gains of
[2669.44s] 20% or more, 12 months out on average up
[2671.92s] 30%. That again is from Ryan Dietrich.
[2674.48s] Consumers expected change in year ahead
[2676.319s] inflation rate. Uh, in May, the New York
[2680.96s] survey versus the Michigan survey. Big
[2683.28s] divergence there. Uh, that blows with
[2686.0s] the wind. Fundamental long short ratio.
[2690.079s] They&#39;re massively short in the hole. So
[2691.92s] now they&#39;ve got to play catch-up and
[2693.44s] there&#39;s a lot of buying power that needs
[2695.04s] to still come back in. Russell&#39;s looking
[2697.28s] very good on a technical basis. Record
[2700.0s] short interest after this even after
[2701.839s] this huge rally off the lows which is
[2704.079s] fuel to continue the trend higher back
[2706.4s] up to new highs. That&#39;s an enormous
[2708.319s] opportunity ladies and gentlemen. Lot of
[2711.2s] new money has to go there. Um and um and
[2715.359s] we&#39;ll continue to participate. Market
[2718.0s] value of bonds as a percentage of the
[2719.68s] market value of stocks.
[2724.4s] This is from Paulson.
[2729.04s] Total marketable securities for all
[2730.8s] sectors of the US economy.
[2734.319s] Wow, that&#39;s interesting.
[2744.48s] The implication here
[2758.16s] is the value. Yeah, I I 100% see this.
[2762.0s] The value of bonds going up, which would
[2764.16s] be in line with um rates coming down,
[2768.72s] which will lead to two things. number
[2770.4s] one price going up across the board and
[2772.4s] a lot more issuance and refinancing
[2775.44s] uh at better rates. So again, Powell&#39;s
[2777.44s] holding everything up because he he
[2779.76s] doesn&#39;t want his book to be entitled.
[2782.319s] Jay Powell is the next Arthur Burns and
[2784.88s] uh screwing the whole world while he
[2787.68s] focuses on his legacy and his predictive
[2790.8s] powers of uh what he thinks inflation is
[2794.88s] going to do, what he thinks tariffs are
[2796.88s] going to do to prices versus being data
[2799.28s] dependent and based on right now
[2801.359s] acknowledging, oh, I&#39;m 150 basis points
[2804.48s] above neutral. Why don&#39;t I get to
[2806.8s] neutral and then if inflation becomes a
[2808.88s] problem, I can always do a 50point hike
[2812.64s] uh to cool it uh until it works through
[2816.72s] the mechanism. But instead, it&#39;s all
[2819.599s] about him. It&#39;s not about the country.
[2821.359s] It&#39;s not about the 75 million
[2822.88s] millennials who can&#39;t afford a house and
[2824.4s] start a family. Um next week, I&#39;ll tell
[2827.68s] you how I really feel. Natural gas
[2829.2s] consumption in the electric power sector
[2831.68s] continues to grow. Natural gas bot price
[2834.88s] trending up.
[2837.28s] Credible returns despite stumbles along
[2839.119s] the way.
[2841.76s] Oh, this is talking about draw downs
[2843.68s] from peak since 1985.
[2847.76s] And that&#39;s that stable coins are mainly
[2850.16s] backed by liquid assets i.e.
[2854.48s] T bills and money markets. Money markets
[2857.04s] are also a lot backed by government
[2859.2s] guaranteed securities, reverse repo and
[2861.28s] other. So that points to our view on
[2864.16s] stable coins uh driving another one to
[2868.24s] two trillion dollars of demand for
[2869.68s] treasury over time which will also have
[2872.24s] an impact on compressing yields, help us
[2874.64s] refinance, help the millennials etc.
[2878.0s] Year three of bull markets can be
[2880.0s] choppy.
[2885.119s] Uh we&#39;re technically at the beginning of
[2887.28s] a new bull market if you count the
[2889.04s] intrayear 20% draw down that we had in
[2892.8s] April. Uh this you kind of have to back
[2896.079s] up
[2899.44s] crypto stable coins market cap now 260
[2902.079s] billion and if they get this genius act
[2904.24s] through probably going to a trillion to
[2906.0s] two trillion weaker dollar should be a
[2908.559s] material tailwind for earnings revisions
[2911.04s] breath. This is an important point in
[2912.96s] the second half that no one&#39;s really put
[2914.64s] into their models yet. Uh is that the
[2917.04s] weak dollar is going to help earnings as
[2919.04s] the S&amp;P 500 get a a meaningful amount of
[2922.559s] their earnings from abroad. Disney so
[2925.359s] what was a headwind now becomes a
[2926.8s] tailwind. Disney&#39;s now making even more
[2928.8s] from its theme park business than
[2930.4s] everything else combined.
[2933.2s] Uh that is staggering. 59% of the
[2936.079s] profits CPI month-on-month with new
[2938.559s] vehicles. So the incentives are starting
[2940.16s] to kick in. That&#39;s good for volumes.
[2942.4s] You&#39;ll see that in again in the second
[2944.0s] half. Even though you had a little pull
[2945.52s] forward for tariffs, uh, used car and
[2948.24s] trucks. This is why we always wanted to
[2950.48s] play the arms dealers, not the waring
[2952.16s] factions. The OEMs will continue to be a
[2954.96s] race to the bottom in terms of margins.
[2957.04s] The suppliers like Cooper Standard that
[2958.96s] are indispensable and have unique
[2960.4s] technology will start to do massive
[2962.64s] volume numbers which will go straight to
[2964.319s] the bottom line due to operating
[2966.4s] leverage. US growth by indicators, hard
[2969.599s] data versus soft data now starting to
[2972.559s] converge, i.e. the soft data is catching
[2975.68s] up to the hard data.
[2983.92s] Euro versus
[2986.4s] US dollar breaking out to new highs.
[2988.64s] that was on no one&#39;s bingo card at the
[2990.64s] beginning of the year except the loyal
[2992.88s] incredible listeners of hedge fund tips
[2995.76s] with Tom Hayes.
[2998.72s] US natural gas combined cycle capacity
[3000.72s] in by initial operating year.
[3006.559s] What&#39;s the the plan is to bring on
[3010.559s] supply by then. We will be out of cooper
[3013.599s] of uh comtock resources. In the
[3015.599s] meantime, you will be in a deficit and c
[3020.319s] comtock will continue to do well for the
[3022.96s] foreseeable 12 to 18 to 24 months.
[3026.079s] planned US natural gas combined cycle
[3028.24s] capacity through 2028.
[3032.16s] Retail outflows from US equities
[3034.16s] amounted to 29 billion last month.
[3044.559s] That&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m not sure where
[3046.0s] they&#39;re getting this data because some
[3047.04s] of it&#39;s conflicting, but according to
[3049.04s] this data set, they&#39;re they were doing
[3052.559s] exactly what they did at Q4 2022, which
[3057.359s] was the buying opportunity of the
[3058.48s] century. I think this is uh inverted
[3062.319s] based on the other data that we look at.
[3064.16s] But either way, if you look at the
[3066.24s] consistency of the data, what it says is
[3068.0s] you wanted to be a buyer when this was
[3070.16s] happening in the past. Uh figure 23
[3073.52s] retail flows into European equities
[3076.96s] market implied Fed funds rate
[3080.64s] by
[3082.8s] well oh this is now outdated because as
[3084.64s] of today it went to two for this year
[3086.96s] back to two already uh as the 10-year
[3090.0s] yield came down to 436.
[3094.8s] housing affordability by state. You can
[3096.88s] see here
[3099.52s] and the ones that were kind of the
[3101.92s] towards the extremes, Florida and Texas
[3104.4s] are the ones that are starting to get
[3105.599s] hurt already. I think California is
[3107.76s] going to experience it yet uh next. Um
[3114.0s] and you know, I see subtle signs. You
[3115.839s] know, there two three or four million
[3118.559s] dollar houses um around the corner that
[3121.76s] were just built. you know, knockdowns.
[3123.52s] Everything down by the beach is a
[3125.04s] knockdown rebuild. And uh they&#39;re
[3127.76s] beautiful, modern, white, you know,
[3130.24s] 4,000 square feet, whatever.
[3132.96s] And uh they&#39;re both white. And rather
[3136.079s] than lower the price, the guy who built
[3138.079s] them uh is painting the front of one
[3141.119s] black. And my wife was like, &quot;That looks
[3143.76s] worse. I wonder why he&#39;s doing that.&quot;
[3144.96s] Why he&#39;s doing that is because he&#39;s in
[3146.4s] delusion. He thinks that it&#39;s not
[3147.92s] selling because the color is not the
[3151.2s] right color.
[3152.559s] uh it&#39;s not selling because the price is
[3154.72s] too high and the marginal bid is coming
[3156.4s] out of the market and um
[3159.52s] and I I think we&#39;re going to see an air
[3161.359s] pocket and uh that&#39;s going to create a
[3163.119s] lot of opportunity. So, uh, S&amp;P index
[3166.16s] based on the bull bear spread. Again,
[3169.2s] this is what you see at Lowe&#39;s.
[3171.68s] Everyone&#39;s buying puts in the, uh, this
[3174.0s] is the institutional investor bull bear
[3175.599s] spread. And then it it&#39;s not even we&#39;re
[3177.92s] not even at the overbought level. Like
[3180.0s] if you look during COVID, it gets
[3181.359s] overbought and then everyone said here,
[3183.359s] we&#39;re going back down to retest the
[3184.88s] lows. Um, or here in 2022 after the lows
[3190.0s] and then you get this little check back.
[3191.52s] We&#39;re not even ready to get our major
[3192.88s] check back. I think we go back to new
[3194.8s] highs and then we get our check back.
[3197.599s] Uh in 2016, same thing. We&#39;re like here.
[3201.119s] We&#39;re early stages of the recovery.
[3204.079s] Early stages of the recovery. Early
[3206.319s] stages. Early stages. When you get up
[3208.559s] here, you still get more gasoline in the
[3210.96s] tank. So, there&#39;s a lot a lot of stuff
[3212.88s] to do. And that&#39;s why I&#39;ve been so
[3214.16s] aggressive about getting people deployed
[3216.48s] in the types of stocks that we&#39;re doing
[3218.559s] now before, you know, four, five, 6
[3222.319s] months from now, we&#39;re up here and
[3223.839s] everything&#39;s already up another 50, 60%.
[3227.119s] Uh risk appetite over the next 30 days
[3230.24s] still subdued. That&#39;s when you want to
[3232.24s] be buying correctly. Uh picking stocks,
[3236.64s] not buying the indices, which is which
[3238.559s] have moved. China net EV sales continue
[3241.04s] to go up. That&#39;s helping Albamaro, Prime
[3243.92s] Book of Global Equities, Net Buying.
[3246.24s] These have been forced chasers, but off
[3248.079s] of every trough, you get the forced
[3250.319s] chase, which which is followed by
[3253.839s] at least a year plus of followrough. US
[3256.0s] IPO market, this is going to be the next
[3257.68s] game, Animal Spirits, you&#39;re seeing it
[3259.2s] with Circle IPO and a couple others
[3261.76s] trading well above issue price. Uh
[3264.559s] there&#39;s huge pent-up demand for Animal
[3266.88s] Spirits. That should help the banks a
[3268.319s] little bit. Uh this is the stuff that
[3270.88s] Trump is gutting is the regulation
[3273.52s] around building houses. Right now it
[3275.44s] takes 122 days to build a 750,000 ft
[3279.52s] data center. It takes 122 days to build
[3283.119s] a 1,700 ft starter home. That should not
[3286.319s] be the same approval process or red
[3288.4s] tape. Uh hedge funds are still short in
[3291.119s] the hole. They&#39;re just now getting
[3292.64s] positive. They&#39;re going to have to chase
[3294.16s] a lot more. Institutional clients, same
[3296.4s] thing. retail who have been right. They
[3299.52s] were buying in the hole in 2022. This is
[3301.359s] the correct data from Bank of America.
[3302.72s] That other Barkclay stuff was inverted.
[3305.119s] They they actually published it
[3306.48s] incorrectly. Um they were buyers and
[3309.04s] they&#39;ve been right since CO and they&#39;re
[3310.4s] buyers now and they&#39;re going to be right
[3312.0s] again. So, uh we covered the Sloomer.
[3315.68s] Let&#39;s just do some quick market stuff I
[3317.839s] wanted you to pay attention to here.
[3320.559s] After these spikes, you would think that
[3323.44s] the rally is over, but it&#39;s usually an
[3325.76s] indication that it&#39;s just beginning. And
[3327.76s] that&#39;s the same thing that we&#39;re seeing
[3329.119s] right now. That was the equity put call
[3333.359s] ratio 10day moving average
[3336.96s] here. We&#39;ve got the 1% EMA of advanced
[3340.0s] decline ratio. Again, coming off the
[3343.119s] mat,
[3345.52s] cumulative volume ratio, midle. Again,
[3348.079s] these are not at extremes where you want
[3349.44s] to be a seller. Even though we&#39;ve had
[3350.64s] this huge run, this just coming off the
[3352.72s] mat, look what happened in 2023, 2024,
[3356.319s] right after this huge followth through,
[3359.599s] huge followth through, huge
[3362.319s] followthrough, huge follow-through going
[3364.799s] all the way back to 2016. Huge follow
[3367.76s] through coming off these levels. So, I
[3370.72s] know it&#39;s hard to believe because you
[3372.079s] look at earnings and 21 times and blah
[3373.92s] blah blah. just know that there are so
[3376.16s] many trap bears and so much short
[3379.119s] interest that they&#39;re going to continue
[3381.52s] to rip their faces off. And remember
[3385.119s] what um I&#39;ve been saying, but you heard
[3388.24s] from Lutnik more importantly this week
[3390.16s] that they&#39;re going to have a slew of
[3391.44s] deals over the next few weeks announced
[3393.04s] and that&#39;s going to hurt all these
[3394.72s] people that are off sides and that&#39;s
[3396.48s] going to be benefit all of you who&#39;ve
[3398.88s] been paying attention and getting
[3400.4s] positioned and just minting money. So
[3402.88s] NASDAQ up down on B balance volume
[3406.799s] oscillator again. It&#39;s like oh this it&#39;s
[3409.599s] I&#39;m too late. I&#39;m too late. Well that&#39;s
[3412.4s] what happens off these huge draw downs
[3415.44s] and this is what you get. Yeah, maybe
[3416.96s] you get a little check back to scare
[3418.799s] everyone. But don&#39;t worry about it. It&#39;s
[3421.44s] early days coming off of that type of a
[3423.599s] draw down. Early days coming off of that
[3425.839s] type of draw down going all the way back
[3427.599s] every single time. Uh Burke high low,
[3430.559s] same thing. not extreme. Real estate
[3432.96s] still opportunity. CCI we covered this
[3435.2s] week. Healthc care still huge
[3436.96s] opportunity. We got a couple names we&#39;ve
[3438.64s] covered. The Baxters, the XBI, etc. And
[3442.799s] then um Mlen Summation Index, again, not
[3446.96s] really yet at extreme and similar to
[3449.28s] what you see coming off these big draw
[3451.52s] downs with a lot of follow-through to
[3453.52s] come. National Association of Active
[3455.52s] Investment Managers, not back up over
[3457.599s] 100 yet. Uh PMO by all is a little
[3460.16s] extended. So that&#39;s why we&#39;re seeing a
[3461.839s] little chop. Uh PMO by Dow Jones, same
[3465.52s] thing. S&amp;P, same thing. So a little bit
[3468.319s] of chop we&#39;re seeing and that&#39;s kind of
[3470.4s] part of it. Uh but I would not get
[3473.68s] negative yet. I think there&#39;ll be a time
[3475.839s] to do that. There&#39;ll be a little cool
[3477.359s] off in the fall, but uh even then, you
[3479.839s] know, if you&#39;re not at intrinsic value,
[3481.52s] you just ride it out into the fourth
[3483.44s] quarter where you get your year-end
[3484.799s] rally. Uh PMO. Uh here&#39;s the bullish
[3487.839s] percent S&amp;P. Yeah, it&#39;s a little
[3489.599s] stretch, but it happens after every big
[3492.4s] draw down and you get followth through.
[3495.68s] That&#39;s where people get faked out. I
[3498.079s] will say this is if I had to give the
[3500.079s] keys to the kingdom uh that very few
[3503.119s] people understand is when you get these
[3506.16s] massive 20% draw downs. Everything looks
[3510.0s] overbought after the initial rally and
[3513.599s] all the people who sold into the hole
[3515.599s] when po Paul Tudtor Jones was saying
[3518.16s] we&#39;re going to get another 50%
[3519.44s] correction after the 20% correction and
[3521.839s] Ray Dalia was saying get out of stocks
[3523.68s] at the bottom. Um now that they&#39;re up
[3527.28s] 20% off the lows and everything looks
[3529.359s] overbought.
[3531.28s] Now, the people who got in like 3% ago,
[3536.48s] if you after the whole move up that were
[3539.28s] wrong at the lows, it&#39;s all psychology.
[3542.24s] So, as we push up a little bit more, you
[3544.24s] know, the first 3% pullback we get,
[3546.72s] they&#39;re going to get shaken out again
[3548.079s] and that&#39;s going to be the next rip your
[3549.52s] face off leg to the upside. And that&#39;s
[3553.2s] what fakes people out is after the big
[3555.52s] draw downs when everything looks
[3557.92s] overbought on the recovery rally.
[3561.2s] There might be a little bit of pullback
[3563.28s] just to get out the Johnny come lately 2
[3565.44s] 3% to just scare them out because
[3567.76s] they&#39;re they&#39;re weak money because
[3569.68s] they&#39;re already at losses because they
[3571.44s] sold low. Um
[3575.839s] it&#39;s the fuel for the next leg higher.
[3578.16s] That&#39;s what I&#39;m telling you. uh MLEN
[3581.04s] oscillator. Again, this is not extreme
[3585.119s] NYC MLEN oscillator. It&#39;s tough to top
[3588.079s] at these levels, especially coming off
[3589.68s] that type of correction.
[3592.64s] So, we continue to be excessively
[3595.68s] constructive. New highs this summer. Ant
[3599.28s] international and ant now some
[3600.64s] headlines. Ant international ant digital
[3602.24s] to seek stable coin licenses in Hong
[3603.92s] Kong. Game is on. Alibaba&#39;s Joe Sai says
[3606.799s] open sourcing its AI models will boost
[3609.28s] the firm&#39;s cloud business or number one
[3611.04s] in cloud. Trump says deal restoring
[3614.319s] China trade truce is done. Everyone bet
[3616.72s] against that. They were wrong. Yeah,
[3618.48s] there&#39;s some open ends, etc. The key is
[3621.04s] is that the volatility is done. The
[3624.16s] rules of the road are clearer and
[3626.799s] businesses can start to plan again. JP
[3629.04s] Morgan lifts you on forecast on easing
[3631.119s] tariffs risk. We said this was a
[3633.28s] critical component for Chinese equities
[3636.88s] recovery. Yes, they&#39;re up huge off the
[3638.799s] $60 lows in terms of BABA, but it&#39;s the
[3641.839s] first leg of the first leg, ladies and
[3644.88s] gentlemen. And you&#39;re going to start to
[3646.24s] see the yuan appreciate now that this
[3648.079s] trade stuff is uh figured out, mostly
[3651.28s] figured out. Uh and you&#39;re going to
[3653.359s] start to see inflows into China equities
[3656.64s] in the back half and probably starting
[3659.44s] very soon, if not now, this month. uh
[3661.839s] for seasonally this is a strong month
[3663.599s] for Chinese equities. So let&#39;s see if
[3664.96s] that holds true this year as well.
[3666.72s] Chinese stocks in Hong Kong enter bull
[3668.72s] market before US talks. Global investors
[3671.68s] are underinvested in China though may
[3674.72s] express interest says Morgan Stanley.
[3676.88s] Remember Morgan Stanley was the sell
[3679.04s] side that was was downgrading Baba in
[3682.24s] the hole at $80 and $60 and then it went
[3686.88s] straight up to $120. They were still
[3689.28s] still had a $60 price target. Now that
[3691.44s] it&#39;s doubled, now they&#39;re saying maybe
[3693.76s] they&#39;ll express interest. Well, at $200,
[3696.079s] I guarantee you Morgan Stanley will be
[3698.48s] upgrading Alibaba and putting a $300
[3700.799s] price target on it. Uh, mark my words on
[3703.2s] that. Is China. And by the way, I&#39;m not
[3705.28s] picking on, you know, it&#39;s just the way
[3706.96s] it goes. Opinion follows trend. It&#39;s
[3710.24s] human nature. Um, you know, there there
[3715.04s] are a few people that are have genetic
[3717.839s] defects like me that that just see
[3721.04s] things a little bit different and are
[3723.2s] willing to take that shortterm pain when
[3725.44s] things are out of favor. That is that
[3727.359s] those folks do not wind up on the sell
[3729.359s] side. I can assure you that the sell
[3732.0s] side are a bunch of Momo guys that
[3733.76s] follow the trend and save their jobs.
[3735.92s] So, uh, is China reversing its
[3738.24s] uninvestable image? You bet. Bessant
[3741.2s] says $2 trillion dollar reasonable for
[3743.76s] dollar stable coin market lot of demand.
[3747.68s] PayPal seeks to launch USD stables coin
[3750.16s] on stellar. Uh this is only going to
[3752.88s] enhance. They&#39;re the sixth largest
[3754.72s] stable coin issuer right now. They will
[3757.2s] be a beneficiary. That was not even on
[3759.52s] anyone&#39;s bingo cards when we got
[3761.2s] involved. PayPal continues to climb. The
[3764.079s] thing is generating so much cash. It&#39;s
[3765.839s] going to buy in 20% of the float over
[3767.44s] the next two years. transaction margins
[3769.68s] going up. Free cash flow record. Uh it&#39;s
[3773.28s] it&#39;s just on a tear and Alex Chris is
[3775.28s] crushing it. So uh again in positive
[3778.16s] sign for you a 10-year Treasury auction
[3780.24s] was strong again in positive sign for US
[3782.0s] assets. US core inflation rises less
[3784.319s] than forecast and uh JPL continues to
[3788.079s] sit on his hands and suck his thumb. US
[3790.64s] payrolls increased 139.
[3793.599s] Okay. You also had a big downward
[3795.52s] revision last month. Here&#39;s the trend
[3797.52s] that I&#39;m showing you guys. This is
[3799.359s] showing weakening. This is deflationary,
[3802.559s] not inflationary,
[3804.559s] deflationary.
[3806.319s] Okay? So, you got to get ahead of that.
[3808.079s] Not be too late. Powell with his
[3809.68s] transient nonsense again. And uh and and
[3812.799s] because it&#39;s it&#39;s too costly to bring a
[3815.52s] country out of deflation, especially
[3817.599s] when you have no dry powder and you got
[3819.76s] so much interest service on the debt.
[3821.839s] You got to bring that interest service
[3823.039s] down like they did following World War
[3825.119s] II when debt to GDP was 120% like now.
[3828.799s] They brought it down to 63% by the mid1
[3832.319s] 1950s. And they did that by letting
[3834.72s] inflation run a little hot. So you
[3836.24s] inflate a little bit of that debt away
[3838.079s] and letting growth run out of control.
[3840.24s] Inflation 3 to 5%, GDP plus 5% and you
[3844.079s] bring that rate down from 120 down to 60
[3846.559s] within 8 to 10 years. We can do it
[3848.799s] again, but we just need to write actors
[3850.559s] in the seats. And so far, we&#39;re missing
[3852.559s] one at the Fed. Disney takes full
[3854.96s] control of Hulu for billions less than
[3856.72s] Comcast wanted. Yee-haw baby, we love
[3859.119s] our Disney. Theme parks generate 67
[3861.839s] billion in annual US economic impact. We
[3865.2s] love that. No one wanted it at 85.
[3868.0s] Everyone&#39;s starting to like it at 115.
[3870.48s] It&#39;s going higher. What stocks do best
[3872.88s] when the dollar weakens or strengthens?
[3875.52s] Uh, we covered that through the other
[3877.039s] charts. Anyway, investors pull out of US
[3878.96s] stocks and into Europe and emerging
[3880.48s] markets. Was on No One&#39;s Bingo card uh
[3883.2s] at the end of last year, except for all
[3885.039s] of these incredible headed headphone
[3886.96s] tips with Tom Hayes. Uh
[3890.64s] mug bearers, hatw wearers, t-shirt
[3893.44s] wearers, I&#39;m sorry, the golf shirts are
[3895.2s] still out of stock. We had a tremendous
[3897.28s] amount of interest in those. The t-shirt
[3899.92s] is actually even nicer, but uh they&#39;re
[3902.64s] they&#39;re all great. BFA&#39;s Hunter expects
[3906.0s] more emerging market gains as dollar
[3908.72s] drops. Amen. Hallelujah. Boeing books
[3911.839s] 303 new orders hits 737 max production
[3915.359s] target in Blockbuster May. Look, the
[3917.28s] business is doing great. We don&#39;t know
[3918.559s] what&#39;s going on with India. That was um
[3921.68s] sad story uh obviously for pray for the
[3924.4s] families and the victims etc. But that
[3926.799s] plane was built in 2009. Okay. So that
[3929.92s] is a that&#39;s before the salesman was
[3932.96s] running the shop and blowing things up
[3935.039s] uh prior to Kelly Ortberg. So I wouldn&#39;t
[3938.319s] make too much of that. If it if it
[3940.319s] proves to be Boeing&#39;s fault for a plane
[3942.16s] that&#39;s 16 years old, uh they&#39;ll have to
[3945.76s] write a check, but it doesn&#39;t change the
[3947.599s] fact that all the other stuff is
[3948.72s] humming. I would say it&#39;s Air India. My
[3952.559s] bet is that there was a flaw in the
[3954.96s] maintenance versus the plane itself.
[3958.079s] Maybe parts that should have been
[3959.28s] replaced had not been replaced or
[3960.72s] maintenance was done improperly, but we
[3963.52s] don&#39;t know until we know. Uh so as we
[3967.039s] always say, better to be lucky than to
[3968.48s] be good. Two weeks ago when I said we
[3970.319s] took off the options had made too much
[3972.4s] money too quickly from, you know, the
[3974.4s] stock going from 135 to 210 in in a
[3977.119s] matter of a couple of months. We took
[3979.119s] those off, but we didn&#39;t sell one share
[3980.96s] of stock and we&#39;re comfortable holding
[3983.119s] every single share. We have not sold a
[3984.96s] share. Uh but we were luckier
[3988.96s] than uh anything to sell all those
[3992.079s] options at huge profits two weeks ago.
[3994.88s] Uh and uh and even if we get some
[3997.599s] short-term volatility with this on the
[3999.359s] stock, we&#39;re comfortable owning it for
[4000.88s] the long term for all the reasons we&#39;ve
[4002.72s] discussed. Namely, they are still a
[4004.48s] duopoly. And if you want to get it from
[4006.24s] Airbus, go for it. You can just wait 20
[4008.88s] years for your next plane. Get to the
[4010.48s] back of the line. Small cap stocks are
[4012.16s] underloved. Why? Their time may be
[4014.16s] coming. That&#39;s from Jack Hugh. Jack is a
[4017.28s] incredible writer at Baron, so you can
[4019.76s] check that out. Also probably a listener
[4022.48s] of the podcast, although I can&#39;t confirm
[4024.079s] that. I do know there are a few over
[4026.4s] there that listen. US power grid getting
[4029.44s] critically tight. Time to consider
[4031.039s] backup power at home. Backup power aka
[4034.799s] the Kleenex of Home Sand by Generate
[4037.119s] Raiders. gener which is also going to
[4039.599s] benefit from lower rates which is also
[4041.119s] going to benefit from the housing theme
[4043.2s] which is also going to benefit from
[4045.2s] hurricane season coming now. Surging
[4048.64s] electricity demand is just one reason
[4050.24s] natural gas looks so appealing to
[4051.52s] investors. All the themes we&#39;ve got
[4053.599s] covered. The genius trade nobody wants
[4055.28s] stock market and sentiment results. Time
[4057.839s] for a rotation this time of year with
[4059.28s] the Stanley Cuff playoffs in full swing.
[4060.96s] I&#39;m reminded of one of the key
[4063.039s] frameworks we live by a great hill
[4064.319s] capital that comes straight from the
[4065.359s] great one himself Wayne Gretzky who
[4067.039s] famously said skate to where the puck is
[4069.68s] going not to where it has been
[4072.48s] this by the way for the new people
[4074.16s] listening you can find our article of
[4076.079s] the week at hedge funfundtips.com
[4078.72s] just uh scroll down to popular post and
[4080.88s] you can just click on that there
[4084.88s] kind of framework isn&#39;t exactly popular
[4086.88s] in today&#39;s investment world more often
[4088.72s] we see investors chasing the shiny
[4090.319s] object s aka the names making the
[4092.24s] headlines that are already up 5x and
[4094.24s] suddenly being called quote great buys.
[4096.48s] We prefer the names that no one wants,
[4098.159s] the ones left for dead. And we&#39;ve built
[4099.679s] a long track record of doing just that.
[4101.44s] Whether it was energy during COVID when
[4103.359s] oil prices went negative, big tech in
[4105.12s] the fall of 2022 when everyone was
[4106.719s] calling for a recession that had already
[4108.159s] come or banks and real estate after the
[4110.08s] mini banking crisis in 2023. We skate to
[4112.48s] where the puck is going. Even this year,
[4114.719s] look at Boeing. Just a few months ago,
[4116.159s] no one would wanted it in the 130s. Now
[4118.56s] at 2:15 everyone, it&#39;s all anyone wants
[4121.44s] to talk about. So the question today is
[4123.44s] where&#39;s the puck going next? That brings
[4125.52s] us to one of our favorite themes right
[4126.88s] now and the topic of this week&#39;s
[4128.319s] article, housing and rate sensitives.
[4130.159s] The consensus view is that rates will
[4131.679s] stay higher for longer and anything rate
[4133.52s] sensitive, especially housing related,
[4135.52s] is left for dead. We&#39;re happy to take
[4137.04s] the other side of that trade. What I&#39;m
[4138.96s] about to say is something you won&#39;t hear
[4140.159s] anywhere else. By the end of 2025, we
[4142.159s] expect to see 30-year fixed rate
[4144.08s] mortgages below 6%. When that happens,
[4147.359s] you will see the beach ball of pent-up
[4148.88s] demand held underwater for the past
[4150.48s] three years finally explode higher at
[4152.56s] that point. Housing related stocks and
[4154.4s] cyclicals will be the talk of town. So
[4156.56s] with mortgage rates currently sitting at
[4158.08s] 685, how do we see a path below 6% in
[4160.48s] the next 6 months? Treasury Secretary
[4162.48s] Scott Besson has a couple of arrows in
[4164.159s] his quiver that address that question,
[4166.239s] two of which we will highlight today.
[4168.08s] First off, the supplementary leverage
[4170.48s] ratio aka SLR introduced after the great
[4174.4s] financial crisis as part of the Basel 3
[4177.12s] reforms requiring banks to hold a
[4178.96s] minimum capital level relative to their
[4180.719s] total assets. Scott Besson has argued
[4183.359s] and Jerome Powell has actually agre
[4186.0s] agreed that because the SLR does not
[4189.12s] factor in risk waitings, it effectively
[4192.08s] penalizes banks for holding US
[4194.96s] treasuries.
[4197.44s] Bessant has called loosening the SLRs a
[4200.4s] high priority and proposed exempting
[4202.88s] government guaranteed securities from
[4204.64s] banks total assets. Regulators are
[4207.28s] reportedly very close to making the
[4209.52s] change with an announcement possible as
[4211.92s] early as this summer. Bessent estimates
[4214.239s] that the exemption could free up as much
[4216.08s] as $2 trillion in bank balance sheet
[4219.12s] capacity, creating an overnight surge in
[4221.679s] demand for treasuries and lowering
[4223.6s] yields by 30 to 70 basis points. Here&#39;s
[4227.84s] a great interview from a few weeks ago
[4229.36s] where Bess goes over the SLR around the
[4231.28s] 13-minute mark, followed by an article
[4232.88s] that explains the change in detail.
[4236.48s] So, you can read through that at hedge
[4238.239s] funips.com. The genius act in stable
[4240.56s] coins. Buffett has always preached the
[4242.0s] importance of staying within one circle
[4243.44s] of competence. It&#39;s a principle we have
[4245.92s] long followed staying in our lane by
[4247.52s] focusing on high-quality businesses when
[4249.12s] they are temporarily impaired and
[4250.4s] sitting tight until they reach full
[4252.88s] value. I.e. our edge is time arbitrage.
[4257.199s] But even old school equity guys but like
[4259.6s] myself are starting to get excited about
[4261.28s] the potential impact of digital assets
[4264.48s] as it relates to demand for treasuries.
[4266.719s] Here&#39;s why. Right now, the stable coin
[4268.239s] market sits at roughly 250 billion, but
[4270.719s] remains largely unregulated and lacks
[4272.8s] any for formal legal framework. The
[4274.8s] Genius A, currently under review in
[4276.64s] Congress and possibly headed toward the
[4278.08s] Senate floor as soon as next week, would
[4280.08s] change that. The bill would require
[4282.08s] issuers to fully back stable coins with
[4284.8s] highquality liquid assets, including US
[4286.88s] treasuries, if passed. The estimates
[4288.88s] suggest that stable coin market could
[4290.64s] grow to more than two trillion by 2028.
[4293.12s] That kind of growth would create near
[4294.64s] overnight surge in demand for
[4296.8s] treasuries. So you have two billion from
[4300.239s] the SLR, another sorry two trillion from
[4302.719s] the SLR, two trillion from stable coin
[4305.6s] passage. You&#39;re talking 4 trillion in
[4307.28s] demand for treasuries. That&#39;s serious
[4310.08s] demand that will compress yields. That
[4312.159s] kind of growth would create a near
[4313.84s] overwright surge in demand for
[4315.84s] treasuries. Best in estimates between 1
[4317.44s] to two trillion in incremental demand
[4319.04s] could materialize over the coming years.
[4321.12s] Even if those estimates are cut in half,
[4322.56s] you&#39;re still looking at a major tailwind
[4323.92s] for lower rate compression across the
[4326.0s] board. Here&#39;s a good breakdown of stable
[4327.6s] goods and the genius rate from the
[4329.28s] Treasury,
[4330.8s] etc.
[4333.36s] Stable coin issuers could be one of the
[4335.6s] largest holders of US treasuries by
[4338.239s] 2030, more than Japan, more than China,
[4341.679s] more than the UK, etc. Oh, and by the
[4344.0s] way, not only do our rate sensitive
[4346.159s] plays stand to benefit as yields come
[4348.239s] down with the Genius Act, but we also
[4350.48s] own PayPal, aka the issuer of the sixth
[4354.08s] largest stable coin in circulation, now
[4356.64s] approaching
[4360.4s] 1 billion market cap. QXO update. QXO is
[4364.159s] up 65% since we talked about it on Fox
[4366.64s] Business a couple months ago on April
[4369.04s] 4th. You can see the video here. is up
[4371.199s] much more since we originally covered it
[4373.36s] on the podcast. A few weeks ago, Brad
[4375.44s] Jacobs laid out his blueprint for
[4377.12s] turning QXO into the $50 billion
[4378.96s] powerhouse he envisions. His 5-year plan
[4381.28s] includes more than doubling IBIDA and
[4382.96s] driving over 500 basis points of margin
[4384.88s] expansion. In fact, his expectations for
[4387.199s] earnings upside for Beacon have
[4388.719s] materially increased since closing the
[4390.48s] deal. For us, QXO is a classic example
[4393.28s] of betting on the jockey. Brad Jacobs
[4395.36s] has a track record that speaks for
[4396.719s] itself. An investment in QX in XPO when
[4399.6s] he got involved would have been a 50
[4400.96s] bagger. United Rentals would have been
[4403.36s] close to a 70 bagger. Altogether
[4405.28s] alongside Jacobs across his companies
[4407.52s] including United in including United
[4409.44s] Rentals Waste Management have generated
[4411.199s] more than 300 times investors money. On
[4413.84s] top of that,
[4415.76s] Brad Jacobs also puts his money where
[4417.679s] his mouth is and has some serious skin
[4420.08s] in the game with QXO. He wrote a $900
[4423.04s] million check out of his own pocket and
[4424.8s] now owns 28% of the equity.
[4429.36s] The rest of QXO&#39;s leadership has
[4431.36s] material ownership and incentive plans
[4433.199s] tied to stockholder returns.
[4435.76s] This is the kind of position we are
[4437.12s] happy to buy. Throw in a filing cabinet
[4438.8s] and watch Brad Jacobs work his magic
[4440.719s] over the next few years. We think over
[4442.4s] the long term, this is a five to six
[4443.92s] bagger knowing Brad Jacobs, it could end
[4445.76s] up being much more. Here&#39;s the full QXO
[4449.52s] investor presentation which does a good
[4451.199s] job laying out the playbook for how
[4452.719s] Jacobs plans to build his next
[4454.239s] masterpiece and disrupt disrupt the
[4457.12s] building products distribution industry.
[4459.6s] Safe to say we are excited to be along
[4461.76s] for the ride.
[4464.4s] Can go through that at your leisure.
[4469.92s] Wolf Research put the $44 price target
[4472.64s] on the stock. 162% upside that came out
[4475.44s] just a few days ago. So, when we were
[4478.08s] pitching it at $13 and lower, it went to
[4482.0s] 11 against us after we bought it.
[4484.719s] Everyone said, &quot;You&#39;re an idiot for
[4486.08s] buying it at two times cash, blah, blah,
[4488.08s] blah.&quot; I said, &quot;I idiot I am.&quot; We bought
[4490.0s] more. Now, it&#39;s at 20 going to 50 going
[4492.88s] to 100. So, uh, bet on the jockey is the
[4496.08s] name of the game. Now, the reason being,
[4498.239s] the reason housing is one of our
[4499.6s] favorite themes isn&#39;t just because it
[4500.96s] stands to benefit from lower rates.
[4502.56s] We&#39;ve also discussed the strong
[4503.92s] demographic tailwinds, peak fam family
[4506.56s] formation in the 30 to 35 year old range
[4508.64s] group and for proving affordability
[4510.239s] driven by starter home revival,
[4512.32s] multi-million unit housing shortage and
[4514.56s] opening up of federal lands all
[4516.08s] supporting our thesis. Apollo put out a
[4517.84s] great housing outlook. Note a few weeks
[4519.76s] ago also highlighting some of these
[4521.44s] tailwinds. You can see the affordability
[4524.0s] at record lows not since seen s seen
[4526.8s] since the early 2000s. Uh, demographic
[4529.44s] tailwinds are a tailwind
[4532.32s] to housing demand.
[4535.28s] Median age of all home buyers is now 56
[4538.48s] years old, up from 31 in 1981. This is
[4543.76s] like an extreme that will revert very
[4546.719s] very quickly. Total housing inventory
[4549.12s] per person is very low. US has an
[4551.84s] estimated deficit of 2.4 million homes.
[4555.12s] US homes are getting smaller. Median
[4556.719s] size of new single family homes is
[4558.4s] declining. We said this would start to
[4559.76s] happen two years ago. It&#39;s now
[4561.199s] happening. The whole game is going to be
[4562.96s] on. You see this going back to the early
[4565.36s] 2000s and then it just picks up. Uh this
[4568.88s] is the fastest Fed driven housing
[4571.199s] slowdown on record. Let me repeat that
[4573.52s] again. This is the fastest Feddriven
[4577.28s] i.e. legacy personal legacy selfish
[4580.719s] interest Feddriven housing slowdown on
[4583.92s] record.
[4586.719s] Next week I&#39;ll tell you how I really
[4588.159s] feel. Crown Castle update. This is also
[4590.8s] interest rate sensitive. You can see the
[4592.239s] free cash flow here. You can see the
[4594.239s] price. This is going to revert back.
[4596.08s] It&#39;s all a function of rates. In the
[4598.0s] meantime, you pick up a 4% dividend
[4599.92s] yield. You can read through the
[4601.52s] earnings. At the end of the day, here
[4604.239s] are the key points you need to know
[4605.92s] about Crown Castle. One, it&#39;s going
[4607.84s] higher in our view. A lot higher. Top
[4610.32s] priority remains closing the 8.5 billion
[4612.48s] sale of its small cell and fiber
[4613.92s] solutions business in the first half of
[4615.36s] 2026. Management continues to make solid
[4617.84s] progress working through the regulatory
[4619.28s] approval process once completed. Crown
[4621.04s] Castle will become the only publicly
[4623.28s] traded pure play tower company focused
[4625.679s] exclusively on the US. Management
[4628.0s] continues to expect annual AFO in the
[4630.4s] range of 2.27 billion to 2.42 once a
[4634.159s] transaction closes. Compared to current
[4636.719s] outlook of 1.7 to 1.8, Eight, the
[4638.96s] increase is largely driven by
[4640.56s] anticipated reductions in interest
[4643.12s] expense and significantly leaner cost
[4645.6s] structure of the standalone business.
[4648.239s] Three, management expects to repay $6
[4652.4s] billion of debt with the transaction
[4654.96s] proceeds and allocate up to three
[4656.4s] billion toward share repurchases,
[4658.4s] roughly 7% of the current market cap.
[4660.48s] Four, organic revenue growth came in at
[4662.239s] 5.1% in Q1, ahead of the 4.5% fullear
[4665.44s] guidance. management reiterated guidance
[4668.0s] across the board
[4670.0s] and noted they were tracking towards the
[4672.32s] high end of the range and may even
[4673.679s] expand it as the year progresses. Mobile
[4676.64s] data demand continues to grow at a
[4678.08s] strong clip with the roll out of 5G
[4679.52s] network. CCI&#39;s customers have invested
[4681.44s] over 35 billion annually into their
[4683.199s] networks, helping to drive more than 5%
[4684.88s] organic growth in the tower business.
[4686.96s] Conversations with customers remain
[4688.96s] constructive and growing competitive
[4690.48s] pressure among carriers continues to be
[4692.4s] a strong tailwind for tower companies.
[4694.32s] Capex a long concern for capital
[4696.64s] intensive fiber business since it
[4698.08s] accounted for nearly 90% of the spending
[4700.4s] last year total just 40 million this
[4702.64s] year only 4% of revenues compared with
[4704.64s] 20% last year with the US tower business
[4707.04s] requiring minimal capex capital
[4708.64s] allocation will begin shifting toward
[4710.8s] returning capital to owners
[4714.88s] consolidated adjusted ebid margins for
[4716.8s] the quarter were 68% a 500 basis point
[4719.52s] improvement year-over-year as highly
[4722.239s] attractive tower businesses is no longer
[4724.48s] held back by the fiber and small cell
[4726.159s] segments. Eight,
[4728.64s] sprint churn should largely be done by
[4731.36s] the end of 2025 with management
[4733.12s] continuing to expect long-term churn
[4734.96s] rates of just 1 to 2%. Nine, management
[4737.84s] remains committed to maintaining an
[4739.36s] investment grade balance sheet with an
[4741.12s] average maturity length over six years,
[4742.8s] 89% fixed rate debt, and long-term
[4744.96s] average targets of six to six and a half
[4747.84s] times IBIDA and 10 beginning. I feel
[4751.44s] like I&#39;m David Letterman top 10 list.
[4753.44s] Beginning in the second quarter,
[4754.8s] management reduced the dividend to 4.5
[4757.52s] uh still yielding 4.27% at today&#39;s
[4760.239s] prices. This new quarterly payout is
[4761.92s] expected to run at a rate of 75% to 80%
[4765.28s] of anticipated AFO.
[4770.239s] Okay, closing out the article. Our
[4773.28s] sentiment
[4775.199s] uh even Morning Star still has 125 fair
[4777.679s] value. Uh it&#39;s going higher, a lot
[4781.199s] higher than that. Uh sentiment is is up
[4784.64s] there, still not yet extreme. Same with
[4787.28s] active investment managers exposure
[4789.679s] still not fully at extreme. Consumer
[4792.159s] staples earnings revisions last 60 days.
[4794.48s] Rear view looking seasonally weaker,
[4797.199s] which is normal. They bring down
[4798.48s] estimates the first half, they ramp them
[4800.0s] up the second half. They&#39;re down 2.45
[4802.48s] and 2.75% respectively. It&#39;s already in
[4805.52s] the stocks. Defensive have sold off. uh
[4808.159s] we&#39;re probably at the trough there.
[4810.159s] Consumer discretionary down just 33
[4813.44s] basis points for this year and 1.06
[4816.56s] for next year. So those are holding up.
[4818.719s] Some of those have run ahead of
[4819.92s] themselves. I think that&#39;s the shift
[4821.6s] we&#39;re also going to see in the next
[4823.679s] quarter.
[4825.84s] Uh let&#39;s just look at this inflation
[4827.44s] data. Came in headline below
[4831.28s] expectations at 2.4% 4% month on month
[4834.32s] only 10 basis points up. Uh and then
[4838.239s] today you saw PPI a similar story
[4840.239s] expected to be up uh core was expected
[4843.199s] to be up 3/10en of a percent was only up
[4845.92s] onetenth of% year-on-year 3% versus 3.1
[4849.76s] estimates and PPI was supposed to be up
[4852.08s] 210 of 1% month-on-month uh headline and
[4855.36s] was only up onetenth of 1%. So Powell,
[4859.679s] wake up and smell the deflation.
[4864.4s] Disinflation. I&#39;d say you&#39;re on, you
[4866.48s] keep it up, it&#39;ll be deflation.
[4869.12s] Um, and by the way, very un
[4872.64s] popular view, but you do not want this
[4875.28s] this to catch up because once deflation
[4878.48s] starts, you can&#39;t stop it. Inflation,
[4880.56s] you can stop in 5 minutes with an
[4882.08s] emergency hike. Deflation, it&#39;ll cost
[4884.719s] trillions. Um, and a lot of heartache
[4887.12s] and unemployment. just so the guy can
[4888.8s] get his legacy guaranteed.
[4892.4s] Um, all right. So, earnings,
[4899.199s] they&#39;ve taken down estimates for Q2. I
[4902.08s] love this because the bar is low. At the
[4904.0s] end of March, Q2 estimates were 9.3%.
[4907.36s] They&#39;re now down to 4.9%. So, they set
[4910.32s] the bar low so they can step right over
[4913.04s] it. they will beat this just like they
[4914.96s] did in Q1 when they took it down to 6%
[4918.0s] earnings growth and they actually did
[4919.76s] 13.3%
[4921.679s] earnings growth. This my guess is it&#39;s
[4924.159s] expected to be 5%. It&#39;ll probably be 9
[4926.159s] or 10% and that&#39;ll be enough to get us
[4928.48s] to new highs before we probably take a
[4930.88s] breather in the fall uh ahead of the
[4933.44s] year and follow through. So that&#39;s that.
[4936.719s] The podcast is over. Now we go on to the
[4940.96s] ask me anything questions from our
[4943.76s] amazing audience. Uh so if you like to
[4946.639s] stick around from that and you learn as
[4948.08s] we go through individual companies that
[4949.76s] the audience is asking me to look at uh
[4952.159s] please stick around. For the rest of you
[4953.52s] we&#39;ll be back next week, same time, same
[4955.36s] place. So here we go. Okay, question one
[4959.36s] comes from Austin McVan wanted to know
[4962.159s] your thoughts on S AIA.
[4971.84s] Let&#39;s take a look.
[4982.88s] Got to sign in here.
[4986.56s] That does that. Let&#39;s bring it up here.
[4998.4s] H
[5001.199s] S A I A. All right.
[5006.88s] I have a feeling this one&#39;s going to be
[5008.56s] good. Let&#39;s take a look.
[5018.0s] What is going on with the negative free
[5020.239s] cash flow, my man?
[5024.32s] Yeah, I
[5027.84s] this is
[5029.92s] Let me take a look at the balance sheet.
[5033.44s] I&#39;m going to say probably a pass on this
[5036.719s] until I see a quarter of break even cash
[5039.36s] flow. But let&#39;s take a look at the uh
[5043.6s] $19 billion 19 million of cash
[5049.28s] long-term debt 194.
[5052.719s] I&#39;m not sure about this one.
[5057.679s] Uh so you&#39;re saying stock crash due to
[5060.639s] weather? Stock doesn&#39;t crash due to
[5062.8s] weather. Stock crash due to
[5065.12s] mismanagement. You got a lot of negative
[5067.04s] free cash flow. partner tariff
[5069.52s] uncertainties. No, no, no, no, no, no,
[5071.92s] no. It&#39;s not time yet. Wait till they
[5074.0s] get a quarter of positive free cash flow
[5075.92s] and if the stock is still down, jump on
[5078.159s] it. If it&#39;s not, if uh something is not
[5084.159s] good here. Okay. So, my
[5091.44s] I want to understand their turnaround
[5093.12s] story and then I want to see them
[5094.4s] execute on their turnaround story. But
[5096.0s] for right now, it&#39;s just a bleeding
[5099.52s] raccoon on the side of the road.
[5102.56s] Uh David Burgerer asked for thoughts on
[5105.76s] Carvana Short.
[5115.84s] Yeah, look, I understand what you&#39;re
[5117.52s] saying about Carvana, but the problem is
[5122.88s] they&#39;re generating a lot of cash. So the
[5124.88s] question is, do you want to short on
[5126.48s] valuation alone?
[5129.36s] Good luck. You might be right in the
[5130.8s] short term. Maybe it&#39;s overbought in the
[5132.32s] short term and you can do it as a fivem
[5133.76s] minute trade. But what is this thing?
[5140.32s] $68 billion market cap on a billion and
[5143.04s] a half of Ibida. Four times sales, 60
[5146.32s] times IBIDA.
[5149.04s] Um,
[5164.48s] balance sheets. Okay.
[5166.88s] They got they got a lot of cash. If you
[5169.44s] look at the enterprise value here, is
[5171.679s] that correct? They got $20 billion of
[5173.6s] cash.
[5176.159s] Yeah. I wouldn&#39;t be shorting a company
[5177.76s] with $20 billion of cash.
[5181.92s] What do they have? 13.
[5187.6s] I don&#39;t know. You really have to You
[5189.199s] really have to be convinced that the
[5190.719s] business model is toast. I don&#39;t really
[5192.88s] know anything about it other than I I
[5194.8s] wouldn&#39;t short on valuation for this
[5196.4s] one.
[5198.159s] Brendan Garvey,
[5206.159s] love the pod. Current finance student
[5207.76s] who&#39;s considering the CFA. Any thought
[5209.36s] on the program? Current state of value
[5210.719s] as it adds value both to the person
[5213.28s] taking it in the reflection to
[5214.48s] employers. I would say
[5218.48s] uh
[5220.48s] if you&#39;re coming out of school with no
[5222.239s] world experience or investing
[5224.48s] credibility
[5226.48s] um it&#39;s indispensable like you have zero
[5229.04s] value without that information more or
[5231.679s] less. So I would, you know, unless
[5235.36s] you&#39;ve run a business for 20 years and,
[5237.679s] you know, you understand financials like
[5240.0s] the back of your hand,
[5242.719s] uh, I think it&#39;s absolutely
[5245.199s] indispensable and it&#39;s and it has
[5246.8s] nothing to do with should I get it to
[5248.719s] look good to employers. You should get
[5250.0s] it as an investment in yourself and in
[5252.48s] yourself only. So um, I think it&#39;s
[5255.84s] absolutely indispensable. I mean, if you
[5257.52s] had an NBA and you&#39;re like 30 or you&#39;d
[5260.48s] run a business for 10 years and made,
[5262.639s] you know, 10 20 million bucks and, you
[5265.84s] know, you understood financials and you
[5268.159s] understood businesses and you&#39;ve been
[5269.679s] investing for 10 years on your own and
[5272.4s] pretty good at it, it&#39;s probably not the
[5274.56s] highest and best use of time, but at
[5276.159s] your age, it&#39;s it&#39;s without question.
[5278.8s] That&#39;s table stakes. And then you may
[5281.04s] still not succeed. You may still not get
[5283.36s] hired. It does not give you a right to a
[5284.96s] job. it gives you an opportunity to a
[5286.48s] job, but without it uh unless you&#39;re at
[5289.04s] one of the Ivy&#39;s, I think, uh your odds
[5292.4s] are low. So, um I would do it for
[5296.08s] yourself first and foremost. Your
[5298.32s] employers will see it as a commitment
[5299.76s] that you&#39;re not just entering the career
[5301.92s] because you think it&#39;s a way to make
[5303.199s] money, but you&#39;re entering it because
[5304.4s] it&#39;s what you actually want to do. Um
[5307.12s] and I think you&#39;re on the right track.
[5308.48s] So, thanks for putting that in and I&#39;m
[5309.76s] sure that helped a lot of people. Theo D
[5314.159s] or I&#39;m sorry, Johan Hagen Hagen Bjork.
[5319.6s] Hi Tom. Johan Hagen Bjork. Okay, these
[5323.36s] are my guys in Sweden. A question from
[5326.719s] another member of the Swedish investment
[5328.8s] crew. Quote, beer and Baba. These are my
[5331.92s] fans in Sweden that have been tuning in
[5334.88s] uh for the last couple years while we
[5337.04s] built out the Baba position. I hope your
[5339.52s] basis is below 85 and you&#39;re making
[5342.96s] money and you&#39;re going to make a lot
[5344.4s] more money and be able to afford a lot
[5346.719s] more beer. Uh here is your and uh
[5350.48s] hopefully you&#39;re buying it from Guinness
[5352.32s] sold by Dagio.
[5354.96s] Uh what is your opinion of the off-road
[5357.44s] vehicle company Polaris? They are a
[5359.28s] dividend aristocrat making headwinds for
[5361.28s] macro demand. Look, this is another
[5363.44s] rates play.
[5367.04s] Um,
[5374.639s] I think we&#39;re getting close. I was
[5376.08s] looking at FOXF this week. I generally
[5379.44s] hate these businesses to be honest with
[5381.28s] you. They&#39;re garbage businesses, but I
[5383.28s] think at this level, you&#39;re probably
[5385.199s] right. Let&#39;s take a look at the
[5386.56s] financials.
[5389.44s] As a matter of fact, this might even be
[5391.04s] on my, you know, we have like a two-page
[5394.159s] list of targets that we do constant work
[5396.56s] on, and maybe out of 60 names, one or
[5398.639s] two will make it into the portfolio
[5400.239s] within 90 days.
[5403.28s] Uh, let&#39;s see.
[5410.8s] I think this didn&#39;t make it only because
[5412.4s] of the reason I hate the business, but I
[5414.4s] think you&#39;re going to be right on this
[5415.6s] one.
[5421.679s] I mean revenues are really collapsed
[5423.76s] here.
[5427.04s] Margins collapsed.
[5431.52s] Let me see the balance sheet.
[5441.52s] I mean if rates come Yeah. I mean it
[5443.52s] this is just another rate plan. I don&#39;t
[5445.04s] want to be overweight rate plays.
[5448.08s] But
[5456.4s] all right, they&#39;re bringing the share
[5457.6s] count down.
[5472.719s] Yeah, I mean the cash flow was really
[5474.8s] light last year.
[5477.36s] Let&#39;s see what it is on a quarterly
[5478.96s] basis.
[5498.99s] [Music]
[5502.639s] I like it. Beer and Baba. I like it. I
[5505.199s] like it. I think you&#39;re going to be
[5506.32s] fine. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll do anything
[5508.639s] with it, but I do like it. All right,
[5511.28s] Theo
[5513.6s] wanted to come.
[5524.48s] Yeah. All right. So, so this guy is like
[5529.199s] asks us about BTMD
[5534.0s] and then one of my clients
[5539.12s] who&#39;s a wealthy OC guy
[5542.4s] said like everyone&#39;s taking it and it&#39;s
[5545.04s] causing a lot of divorces because
[5546.719s] apparently it makes old guys feel super
[5548.8s] duper young and act super duper young if
[5551.84s] you catch my drift. Is this the one? Let
[5554.96s] me just let me just see.
[5559.12s] Hormone optimization,
[5562.48s] hormone replacement, pellet therapy,
[5566.56s] bio end to end. So, apparently this
[5569.92s] stuff works. Um, and there&#39;s maybe only
[5573.199s] one supplier.
[5581.04s] Yeah, we just don&#39;t do individual
[5583.199s] biotech companies because we don&#39;t think
[5584.8s] we have an edge and we stay where we do
[5586.4s] have an edge. But I think on a
[5588.239s] financials basis, if you think you have
[5589.92s] an edge on the product and you feel damn
[5592.32s] comfortable that the mode is
[5593.44s] impenetrable, then have at it. Um
[5598.32s] question is is how bad are they going to
[5599.84s] delete dilute you over time? And you
[5601.52s] have no way of telling. They&#39;ve gone
[5602.56s] from 1 million shares to 35. What&#39;s to
[5605.12s] say they won&#39;t go to 100? So the it it
[5607.76s] might win and management are a bunch of
[5610.4s] scumbags and they give themselves
[5612.0s] unlimited amounts of options because
[5613.6s] they got the board in their pocket. I I
[5615.76s] I would I would spend all of your time
[5620.56s] studying the history
[5624.48s] of the CEO
[5626.8s] and what has he done for owners in the
[5628.56s] past? Because he could have the best
[5629.92s] thing in the world and you could be
[5631.199s] right about the product and you won&#39;t
[5632.639s] make a dime because he puts it all in
[5634.239s] his pocket. And you see that a lot with
[5636.239s] these type of companies. So,
[5638.96s] uh, investor relations,
[5644.8s] governance,
[5646.48s] executive leadership.
[5649.6s] Brett Christensen. Let&#39;s see what this
[5651.92s] guy has done.
[5656.96s] Myriad genetics was a disaster if I&#39;m
[5659.36s] not mistaken.
[5661.52s] My Y gn.
[5667.52s] Yeah. Train wreck.
[5669.92s] Uh,
[5671.44s] whole X. H O L X.
[5680.88s] What was he involved there? That looked
[5682.56s] like a success.
[5687.44s] And pod
[5693.92s] All right.
[5696.56s] Drove significant revenue growth.
[5699.76s] Utah Valley. He has a bachelor&#39;s from
[5702.88s] Utah Valley
[5706.32s] business school. No medical background.
[5711.04s] You better do a lot of work on this one.
[5712.96s] That&#39;s all I have to say. So, I&#39;ll leave
[5715.36s] it at that. I think you&#39;re going to be
[5716.8s] right about the product. The question is
[5718.239s] whether you&#39;re going to make money off
[5719.28s] the stock. And I don&#39;t I don&#39;t know.
[5721.44s] That&#39;s why I don&#39;t do individual names
[5722.88s] like that. Hey, turnaround time. I have
[5724.639s] a question. Could you look at IPG?
[5768.32s] It&#39;s not even down 50%.
[5771.28s] So,
[5773.04s] it&#39;s not that interesting to us, but
[5774.719s] let&#39;s take a look. Sure. The balance
[5777.04s] sheet is okay.
[5781.36s] Revenues have been declining for
[5784.88s] four consecutive years.
[5790.48s] $4.2 billion of debt. Oh, they&#39;ve got
[5793.679s] two billion of cash, so that&#39;s good.
[5802.239s] billion dollars of free cash. That&#39;s
[5804.239s] pretty damn good.
[5813.52s] I&#39;m sorry. Revenues have not been dec uh
[5817.92s] flattish. All right.
[5830.4s] share accounts coming down.
[5836.719s] I mean, it&#39;s worth exploring. I don&#39;t
[5838.96s] like that kind of business, but
[5842.719s] I mean, if you want to take that risk
[5844.4s] for 50% move over three years, it&#39;s not
[5846.8s] going to be a high enough IR for us, and
[5849.119s] it&#39;s just not attractive enough. I I
[5850.88s] don&#39;t really like that business. So, I
[5852.8s] don&#39;t think you&#39;ll be wrong, but I
[5854.0s] wouldn&#39;t get excited about it. Crispy
[5856.0s] Cream. This has been a perennial disapp.
[5858.32s] Let&#39;s see if they&#39;re not They might be
[5861.52s] so low if they don&#39;t. Oh my god.
[5864.56s] Stock is just getting destroyed. Weren&#39;t
[5866.719s] they supposed to have a deal with
[5867.679s] McDonald&#39;s? What did that Did that fall
[5869.28s] through? Is that the problem? Uh, donut.
[5872.56s] DN U T.
[5881.679s] No, there&#39;s nothing here. I mean, this
[5883.28s] thing&#39;s just losing cash hand over fist,
[5886.56s] no matter how cheap it is. Let&#39;s save
[5888.32s] the balance sheet. Let&#39;s see if you can
[5889.92s] even live to watch it turn around before
[5892.0s] they restructure it.
[5894.719s] 29 million of cash.
[5911.6s] Share count&#39;s gone up by 50% almost or
[5915.199s] 40%.
[5919.04s] How much debt?
[5925.84s] 800 million on 29 million of cash you
[5928.56s] got. So, it&#39;s trading like it&#39;s going
[5930.08s] out of business. Uh like not out of
[5932.159s] business, but bankrupt and they&#39;ll have
[5933.679s] to uh the debt holders will will own the
[5935.84s] company. Uh free cash flow negative.
[5940.719s] They&#39;ve never really generated returns
[5942.48s] on capital.
[5946.8s] Look, I think this is a trade, Jason. I
[5949.679s] mean,
[5954.32s] I can see the attractiveness of it. I
[5956.4s] think Crispy Cream will always be in
[5958.239s] business. The question is,
[5961.04s] will you own it or will the debt
[5963.119s] holders? And some risks are just not
[5965.679s] worth worth taking. I think this is one
[5967.52s] of those. And even if it triples or
[5969.36s] quadruples, I would have z errors of
[5972.32s] omission are okay. Errors of commission,
[5974.48s] like taking a binary gamble on whether a
[5977.119s] company goes bankrupt or not. I don&#39;t
[5978.96s] think is the best use of capital. Johnny
[5981.28s] S.
[5990.8s] He&#39;s asking about Maitwan. I don&#39;t like
[5992.48s] Muan. I like Baba. Um I think I think it
[5998.0s] muan could go the way of Grab. Not Grab.
[6001.52s] Um
[6003.199s] GrubHub and um all the metos. I I I just
[6008.0s] think that it&#39;s it&#39;s too crowded and
[6011.36s] even if it works, I I just I think it&#39;s
[6013.6s] a commodity business. Um
[6018.0s] I need a lot more outs in China and and
[6020.239s] I have it with Alibaba. I don&#39;t want to
[6021.679s] take China risk and take company risk.
[6023.36s] Muan has never been for me. It&#39;s not for
[6025.52s] me. Doesn&#39;t mean it won&#39;t go up when all
[6027.199s] of China goes up. I just don&#39;t want to
[6028.88s] take that risk. Anton Ellerman,
[6032.88s] what are your thoughts on Regeneron?
[6035.199s] Uh there are rumors a new ompic drug in
[6038.159s] development that will add protein and
[6039.679s] lose weight. Look, I like Regeneron, but
[6042.639s] I don&#39;t buy individual biotech stocks.
[6045.44s] So,
[6047.04s] you&#39;re just I mean, it&#39;s cheap enough
[6049.28s] and it&#39;s quality enough and management
[6050.88s] is good enough. It&#39;s become very
[6052.48s] bureaucratic. That&#39;s that&#39;s also slowed
[6054.239s] it down quite a bit. Um I think you&#39;re
[6057.04s] going to be right here, but I&#39;m not
[6059.119s] going to be involved with you. I&#39;ve
[6061.28s] looked at it a million times and I just
[6063.04s] can&#39;t get there. But I
[6065.199s] If you put a gun to my head and said you
[6066.96s] got to buy an individual biotech stock
[6069.679s] right now and hold it for the next five
[6072.639s] years, it would either be this or or
[6074.4s] Biogen. And I haven&#39;t done enough work
[6076.0s] on either of them. So, um, but I don&#39;t
[6080.48s] have to, so I won&#39;t do it. And let&#39;s
[6083.76s] just take a look here.
[6104.56s] I mean, they got more than enough cash
[6105.92s] for the turnaround plan to pay out. So,
[6107.76s] this drug better hit because their
[6110.56s] revenues have just been declining. So, I
[6112.4s] wouldn&#39;t bet against them. And I think
[6113.76s] at these levels, if you had to go into
[6115.679s] an individual biotech, this might be one
[6118.0s] of them. But you don&#39;t, so why would
[6119.92s] you? Uh, SNN, this is from Chris
[6122.96s] Williamson. It&#39;s a UK medical device
[6125.84s] worker. Uh, medical device.
[6132.88s] Yeah, I don&#39;t. It&#39;s It&#39;s just not down
[6134.719s] enough. It&#39;s like you&#39;re not really
[6136.48s] going to make a lot of money for taking
[6137.92s] any risk. I It&#39;s got to be a double or
[6139.84s] triple for me to get involved. And this
[6142.0s] one hasn&#39;t come in enough. So, yes, cash
[6144.56s] flow is recovering. Yes, it probably
[6146.32s] trades back up to 45. So, you&#39;ll make
[6148.48s] 50% over the next couple of years. Um,
[6154.239s] let&#39;s look at the
[6156.96s] balance sheet.
[6164.56s] I think there&#39;s a lot of things to do in
[6166.719s] medical devices.
[6169.84s] They are left for dead.
[6176.08s] I think the balance sheet&#39;s okay here
[6177.84s] from what I can see.
[6180.0s] Got to double check it with source
[6181.6s] materials.
[6186.4s] I think you&#39;re okay. I just don&#39;t think
[6188.0s] you&#39;re going to make a ton of money. I
[6189.36s] think you&#39;re going to make a little bit
[6190.239s] of money and I don&#39;t take risk for a
[6192.32s] little bit of money. Lyall M. Puma,
[6198.8s] I think we covered this. VF is a better
[6201.76s] play because you have
[6205.44s] More outs and more ways to win.
[6232.719s] I don&#39;t I don&#39;t really know the brand. I
[6234.8s] don&#39;t like the brand. I mean, other than
[6237.119s] Ricky Fowler, I don&#39;t know anything
[6238.88s] about the brand. So,
[6241.36s] this is a European thing. I stay within
[6243.679s] my circle of competency. This is not
[6245.76s] within it. And I if I was going to buy
[6248.32s] another sneaker company, I&#39;d be buying
[6250.159s] Nike all day long. That I understand.
[6252.96s] That I think is a buy. But I don&#39;t like
[6255.679s] the upside as much as I like it in VF
[6257.76s] Corp when Bracken turns it around. So,
[6261.04s] um, I&#39;m going to just say I have nothing
[6263.679s] to say on this one. Not good, not bad,
[6266.159s] just nothing. Leaf Foster,
[6269.84s] BME on the LSE.
[6282.96s] This is an ETF, isn&#39;t it?
[6301.679s] No, it&#39;s not.
[6318.88s] General merchandise and grocery stores.
[6336.719s] Oh, is this like a uh
[6341.199s] lidles and uh
[6348.159s] like those lowcost supermarkets?
[6355.04s] Yeah. I mean, this reminds me of Tesco,
[6356.719s] which got smashed that Buffett owned,
[6359.36s] but
[6377.28s] billion pounds of debt. Cash flow.
[6399.36s] I think this might be interesting. I
[6401.199s] would have to understand the business
[6402.4s] more, but I think you&#39;re on the right
[6403.679s] track. I&#39;, you know, read the annual
[6406.0s] report, listen to the last eight
[6407.679s] earnings calls, start to understand the
[6409.44s] turnaround story. Uh, what&#39;s happening
[6412.96s] here with revenues?
[6421.119s] I think it&#39;s interesting. I&#39;m actually
[6423.199s] going to write it down and maybe do a
[6425.36s] little work on it.
[6430.239s] UK play, which I&#39;m kind of interested
[6432.159s] in. Good work, Lee.
[6436.56s] Michael Silber.
[6440.719s] Is it okay for a company share count to
[6443.119s] go up due to an acquisition? Well, it
[6446.08s] depends if it&#39;s dilutive or accretive.
[6448.639s] And what does that mean? Is the multiple
[6451.84s] of the company that they&#39;re buying lower
[6454.719s] than the multiple of the stock that
[6457.119s] they&#39;re issuing? Uh, and then is the
[6461.119s] growth rate as fast for the company
[6464.96s] they&#39;re issuing versus their current
[6468.4s] shares? And then C, what is the
[6471.92s] synergies? What do the synergies look
[6473.92s] like? So, if I&#39;m issuing stock at 30
[6476.56s] times earnings and I&#39;m buying a and I&#39;m
[6478.32s] growing at 10% and I&#39;m buying a company
[6481.76s] that&#39;s trading at 15 times and growing
[6484.239s] at 10%. I should probably do that all
[6487.04s] day and then if I can add some synergies
[6489.04s] on top of it, fine. Uh I prefer debt
[6492.0s] financing if they can do it reasonable
[6493.52s] rates and not dilute at all but uh in
[6496.32s] that arbitrage. But if I&#39;m growing at
[6499.76s] 30% and trading at 10 times and I buy a
[6503.52s] company that&#39;s growing at 20%
[6506.56s] at
[6508.8s] 20 times and I give stock, I just
[6511.28s] diluted my shareholders. So the answer
[6513.04s] is it&#39;s it&#39;s not an easy answer, but I
[6517.199s] tend to not like it.
[6520.4s] Um, love your podcast. From your
[6522.639s] experience,
[6525.6s] do you think the VF Corp investigation
[6528.639s] from Levi and Corsinski would negatively
[6531.76s] affect the stock? No. These are a bunch
[6533.84s] of scumbag ambulance chasers that just
[6536.32s] sue every stock that the price is down
[6538.96s] and hustle them for payoffs and it&#39;s
[6541.76s] just a friction in the economy because
[6543.76s] unfortunately we&#39;re not in a loser pays
[6545.679s] system. Uh and it&#39;s a cost of doing
[6548.239s] business. So, uh, these happen any stock
[6551.119s] that the price goes down more than 30%.
[6553.679s] These ambulance chasers file a suit and
[6555.84s] hope for a payoff and they usually get
[6557.6s] it, which is why they keep doing it.
[6559.52s] And, uh, hopefully that&#39;s something
[6560.96s] Trump can change. But, in the meantime,
[6563.92s] uh, it is what it is. And no, it&#39;ll have
[6565.76s] zero impact if they even, uh, have a
[6568.639s] case, which they don&#39;t. All right. Uh,
[6572.56s] thoughts on Domino&#39;s Pizza Enterprises
[6575.04s] in Australia?
[6585.92s] The Qataris, I think, just offered to
[6588.08s] buy
[6592.48s] Papa John&#39;s,
[6600.56s] which was a super cheap stock.
[6610.48s] Yeah, I think with this one all you got
[6612.0s] to look at is the margin. If I take a
[6614.48s] look at the revenue income statement
[6616.56s] here,
[6628.08s] I mean the revenues have really been
[6629.84s] anemic. So I want to understand why that
[6631.6s] is.
[6633.36s] There&#39;s no growth.
[6634.88s] So, explain how they&#39;re going to
[6635.92s] reacelerate growth.
[6640.239s] Um,
[6647.76s] it&#39;s just steady state. They should just
[6649.36s] be buying in stock and they&#39;re not.
[6651.92s] Let&#39;s see if we can figure out why.
[6653.6s] They&#39;ve only got 58 million in cash.
[6664.4s] little bit of leverage on the balance
[6665.76s] sheet. I think you&#39;re probably okay
[6667.28s] here. I kind of like it. Uh but do do
[6670.56s] some real work on it before you buy
[6672.239s] anything.
[6675.119s] But generally seems like an okay find
[6678.159s] and thanks for sending it in. Dylan
[6679.84s] Cook,
[6683.6s] thanks for your podcast videos. Take a
[6686.159s] look at Owens Corning.
[6689.76s] Uh yeah, we covered that one a few weeks
[6691.52s] ago. I think we said so. So So
[6698.719s] yeah, it hadn&#39;t come in enough for us.
[6700.8s] So uh I think it&#39;s okay, but I wouldn&#39;t
[6703.44s] be a buyer here. I&#39;d probably
[6707.36s] be an interested below 100 and it may
[6710.4s] not ever get there and I won&#39;t care one
[6712.96s] bit if it goes to new highs without me.
[6715.44s] But um it wasn&#39;t compelling enough for
[6717.52s] me at that level. It&#39;s okay. It will
[6720.639s] benefit from the housing. It&#39;ll probably
[6722.159s] be fine, but I need a double or triple,
[6724.0s] and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to get that
[6725.119s] anytime soon on that. Uh, thank you for
[6728.08s] your content. Valuable knowledge you
[6729.199s] always share on online and on TV. ACMR,
[6735.44s] I&#39;m personally long the stock and see 34
[6737.679s] to 40 as a good target.
[6740.32s] Okay. On what basis?
[6747.52s] a CMR.
[6767.84s] All right. Looks like they&#39;re just
[6769.119s] starting to generate some cash. Revenues
[6771.04s] are growing.
[6810.08s] Revenues are growing very fast.
[6819.679s] Share account&#39;s growing a little bit. Uh
[6821.92s] what do they do?
[6830.88s] manufactures and sells capital equipment
[6835.04s] packaging tool and wafer assembly and
[6837.04s] packaging customers front-end production
[6842.159s] wafer surfaces
[6847.52s] shares outstanding
[6850.56s] two times sales 10 times evida uh 16
[6854.96s] times earnings.
[6862.159s] I don&#39;t know. I I I mean, I would never
[6864.0s] buy a stock at $25 for an upside of 34
[6866.719s] to 40. Um but it seems okay. It&#39;s It&#39;s
[6870.719s] okay. I just think there are higher and
[6872.08s] better uses from these levels, but um
[6875.36s] I&#39;d have to understand the business a
[6876.88s] little bit more.
[6878.96s] Uh, Professor Tom, do you keep this from
[6881.599s] Jimmy Jones, you keep a certain
[6883.36s] percentage of cash in your portfolio
[6885.92s] from a sale or do you immediately deploy
[6887.76s] into equity that are still undervalued?
[6890.96s] I know, opinion, not advice. Okay. Uh,
[6894.08s] it depends on the opportunities. Like
[6895.84s] right now, I could deploy a huge amount
[6897.52s] of capital very, very, very quickly
[6899.199s] because there&#39;s still opportunities. But
[6900.48s] that window&#39;s closing. It&#39;ll probably be
[6902.159s] closed in the next 8 to 10 weeks. Um
[6909.599s] so when we like the the the huge
[6912.159s] proceeds we had from the Boeing options
[6914.0s] we were able to deploy that immediately.
[6916.239s] Uh if opportunities are are light we&#39;ll
[6919.52s] just deploy into shorts or we will just
[6922.4s] wait on cash until we find
[6923.92s] opportunities. But uh right now we could
[6926.159s] deploy unlimited amounts. like I I could
[6928.32s] deploy $2 billion tomorrow uh easily uh
[6932.48s] and have plenty of opportunities to do
[6934.8s] so. I think in six months it&#39;s going to
[6937.119s] be a lot harder, but um
[6941.28s] uh there&#39;s no limitations. If there&#39;s no
[6943.04s] opportunity, I&#39;ll hold cash or do
[6944.4s] shorts. Uh but there&#39;s always some type
[6946.56s] of opportunity because if it&#39;s risk on,
[6948.32s] defensives are in the gutter. if uh if
[6952.32s] um
[6954.0s] if the market&#39;s down a lot then risk
[6956.48s] assets are on sale. So uh there&#39;s also
[6959.199s] opportunities in the bond market. You
[6961.04s] know if you&#39;re in a real draw down you
[6962.639s] can do high yield. I mean we can go
[6964.32s] across all asset classes. Uh equities
[6966.8s] but we&#39;re concentrated equities is where
[6968.48s] we like to focus and um and there&#39;s
[6972.8s] usually something to do. We don&#39;t hold
[6974.719s] cash that long unless we see something
[6978.159s] really special happening. So, um I&#39;ll
[6980.4s] leave it at that.
[6982.48s] Okay. Now, see if we have one more
[6986.8s] and then we will move along. Ken View
[6994.56s] KVU.
[6996.08s] I met the CEO at the Al Smith dinner. I
[6998.32s] thought he was a spectacular guy,
[7001.28s] as was his wife.
[7004.32s] Um
[7010.719s] but yeah, never did anything with it.
[7012.4s] That was uh almost a year ago.
[7026.239s] I just don&#39;t think
[7038.239s] Tylot all over the counter stuff.
[7049.39s] [Music]
[7063.84s] Looks like they have a little bit of
[7065.04s] pricing power.
[7070.56s] I don&#39;t know why the share count has
[7071.92s] gone up so much. That&#39;s bothersome
[7074.4s] for a company that big. Unless they did
[7076.0s] a big acquisition.
[7085.44s] free cash flows come down quite a bit.
[7088.159s] It&#39;s t haved in the last year. Let&#39;s see
[7089.84s] what it&#39;s done on a quarterly basis.
[7098.239s] I mean, this is a defensive, so it is
[7100.56s] kind of interesting right now because
[7101.92s] defensives are out of favor
[7105.199s] in some pockets.
[7135.599s] I mean, you&#39;re not really getting a
[7136.96s] bargain for a slow going growing
[7138.639s] business. So, I I I would just have to
[7140.4s] understand
[7142.0s] what is the growth driver because I&#39;m
[7144.08s] not seeing growth yet. All I&#39;m seeing is
[7146.4s] growth in share count, not growth in
[7149.04s] earnings or cash flow or all the things
[7151.119s] that matter. So, uh, and they&#39;re, you
[7154.4s] know, a little bit leveraged. So, it&#39;s
[7158.159s] not, you know, just because the stocks
[7160.56s] down five two bucks doesn&#39;t get me very
[7164.08s] excited. Um,
[7167.04s] nothing really to do yet here. This is
[7168.96s] not this is not a good highest and best
[7171.52s] use of capital. I It&#39;s not to say it
[7173.44s] won&#39;t be okay. Griffis. This is from
[7175.599s] Wilhelm Kunberger.
[7178.08s] Uh
[7183.199s] G R I F.
[7186.719s] Is this a steel producer if I&#39;m not
[7188.88s] mistaken?
[7194.159s] G R I F
[7205.04s] H.
[7209.679s] This is definitely interesting. What is
[7211.119s] it? Please don&#39;t be in the steel
[7212.639s] business.
[7215.679s] No. Oh, plasma therapeutic company in
[7219.76s] Spain.
[7222.159s] Immunoglobin to treat immuno defici.
[7226.639s] Again, this is a wow. This is founded in
[7229.36s] 1909.
[7231.92s] Blood services, immunoglobin,
[7238.96s] liver cerosis.
[7241.119s] Oh god, I don&#39;t know. Is this a biotech
[7243.28s] company?
[7248.239s] I mean, I I like what I&#39;m seeing. I
[7249.92s] gotta be honest with you. So,
[7266.0s] free cash flow is going up. Revenues are
[7267.84s] going up. Margins look like they&#39;re
[7270.48s] stabilizing.
[7296.48s] Share count is steady.
[7306.8s] I think your uh pre-cash flow looks
[7309.52s] good. I think the risk is going to be
[7312.239s] Let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet.
[7314.08s] Billion dollars of cash
[7316.719s] and almost $9 billion of debt. That&#39;s
[7319.92s] your risk is the balance sheet leverage.
[7323.36s] So, you got to go through the public
[7325.36s] filings and find out when all their debt
[7327.04s] matures and what are the terms of their
[7328.8s] debt. uh how sustainable the cash flow
[7331.599s] recovery is because I think with
[7334.719s] everything else held equal, I think it&#39;s
[7337.44s] trading down because of that leverage
[7339.119s] and where rates are, but they&#39;re cutting
[7341.04s] in Europe and this is a Spanish-based
[7343.52s] company if I&#39;m not mistaken. Um I think
[7346.639s] you might have something here, Wilhelm.
[7348.4s] So, good job. Do more work before you do
[7350.639s] anything. Robert
[7353.679s] Wartanian,
[7357.199s] how do you like Ant Sports Brand for
[7359.599s] Asia? Growing food chain from the
[7361.599s] Philippines.
[7365.679s] Asian food paired with burgers and
[7367.52s] chicken.
[7371.679s] Uh,
[7375.599s] anti- sports.
[7398.56s] Oh, is this a Chinese company? Let&#39;s
[7402.4s] see
[7406.8s] in China cross trainining people&#39;s
[7410.08s] republic of China. I won&#39;t buy any
[7412.239s] companies in China other than Baba. I&#39;m
[7414.88s] not taking company and country risk. All
[7416.88s] the numbers look great. I can give you a
[7418.48s] hundred companies that look great in
[7419.92s] China. Baba is my only play in China.
[7422.159s] Only ever will be. I think the numbers
[7424.48s] look fine. I just wouldn&#39;t be involved
[7426.4s] personally. Uh so with that said, we&#39;ll
[7428.88s] be back next week. same time, same
[7430.4s] place. In the meantime, make it a great
[7432.48s] one. Bye for now.
