Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 322nd video cast podcast for the week ending December 18th, 2025. We got a lot of great stuff to cover this week, but as always, family first. Uh Annabelle had an impressive weekend at the Winter Age Group Championships. She swam a remarkable 211 in her 200 IM, securing the top spot in the nation in that event. Additionally, she broke the two-minute barrier in her 200yard freestyle. She further solidified her number one ranking lead in the 500yard freestyle with a time of 516. She went 28 seconds in the 50-yard backstroke and in the relays instead of swimming backstroke. Her coach made her anchor in both the 200yard medley relay and the 200yard freestyle relay. and both times she delivered by clocking 24 seconds in the 50-yard freestyle finish. As a result of her outstanding swims this weekend, Annabelle has now taken the top spot on the IMX leaderboard on USA swimming, which ranks swimmers by age across the nation based on their versatility in all strokes. So, congratulations to Annabelle. There's her top number one ranking 11year-old in the country. super excited. Uh that's the family after her meet. Uh and there she is at her new school Christmas concert. I went to see her singing as did Caitlyn. Uh there's another picture from the event and really proud and uh uh that was at her school uh and so on and uh and Mimi's doing a great job. So we got a lot of great stuff to cover today. Uh, first I want to thank Payton Jennings for having me on Fox Business Varnian Co. Talking Markets. We'll listen in here. Yes, it's Monday morning. It's always nice to see green on your screen. Dow up 250, NASDAQ up 170. Tom Hayes joining me now. Why the rally today, Tom? What's behind it? >> Well, t the season to be jolly, Stu. Uh, Santa comes to town the 15th of the month on average in December since 1950. We tend to rally from the 15th to the 30th of the month. City Bank was out this morning calling for a 13% rally in 2026. That mimics Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs. It's on the basis of a supportive Fed. We have the two Kevins. Kevin Walsh being the proper dove is good for equities. Uh, excuse me, Kevin Hasset being the proper dove. And Kevin Worsh being good for the bond market. He is a hawk in Dove's clothing. So, the market likes some potential certainty coming that way. And tax laws selling season is in the rear view mirror. >> Well, that's always good to hear. All right, Tom. Here's this. The core theme in 2026 will be a rotation out of Mac 7. You wrote that. Justify it. >> Yeah, we've been talking about this for a few months and it's starting to play out in spades. You have decelerating earnings growth and a very high multiple in the MAG 7. You have accelerating earnings growth and a very low multiple in the unmnificent 493. Midterm election years tend to be volatile and choppy. Average return for the S&P up 2.4%. What outperforms in those periods is defensives and healthcare, the unmagnificent 493. I think we're going to see a bid in energy as well, which is going to be surprising to a lot of people. Commercials have been a aggressive buyers of energy futures. They are always early and they are always right. So, expect slightly higher energy prices in 2026. So, it's going to be cyclicals, it's going to be industrials, it's going to be defensives, it's going to be less pronounced in tech taking a breather in 2026. Investors want to see a return on invested capital that they're not seeing yet. So, they're going elsewhere. >> Okay. We're trying to stick as positive as we can. So, we're looking at City Bank thinking the stock market will go up 13% in 2026. We'll stick with that. Tom Hayes, thanks for being here. We'll see you again later. And we got a new poll that shows President >> And we're back. And I want to uh go through our quotes of the week here uh from Warren Buffett. Price is what you pay. Value is what you get. That is a core tenant here at Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. For those of you been around for a while, um, you know, I had one client who I love, uh, super unbelievably successful guy, uh, called in about this stock and I and I said, you know, we just had a monster year. And he said, well, what about this one? Why isn't this one moving? I said, well, let me ask you a question. I said, um, is the business doing better this year than last year? Um, not the price. Is the business doing better this year than last year? And he said, "Yeah, it it is." And uh uh you know, price always catches up to fundamentally it catches up and it catches down. And um uh so he's like, "Yep, I got it." So, he's been with me for a long time and been through a few of these and then seen them take off and uh and that was a lot of fun. Uh John Templeton, to buy when others are despondently sell and to sell when others are euphorically buying takes the greatest courage but provides the greatest profit. And that is part of our core framework is we like to buy the highest quality assets in the most dislocated and hated areas of the markets and then sell them when everyone wants them and help them out. So I want to go through a bunch of the names that we've talked about on the podcast over time, many of which uh we have held or hold uh and go through it. This one is news, ladies and gentlemen. XBI, the biotech basket has now more than doubled off the lows here. You see it's just gone parabolic this year. Um, we took profits and not because we don't think it's going higher. I do think it's going uh probably another 40 50% higher, but we had to make room for a new position in the healthc care sector. Yes, a third position in the healthcare sector. And the only way to do it was to boot this out. And it just comes down to irr from here. You know, maybe it does 40 50% more over the next 3 years. Instead, we replaced it with a position we believe can be a triple three to four bagger uh in the next uh you know our normal time range, you know, three, four, five years. And we're super excited about that. We have put a mon monster pretty big position uh on it. And uh we'll be releasing that sometime after the new year after all new clients are in and fully positioned. Uh we'll go public with that um uh long-term holding idea. But we want to make sure all the new people coming in for this quarter are fully positioned because it's uh uh it's not like a a small cap like Cooper was, but it is a small midcap couple billion dollar company and we think has a massive amounts of upside. And I met a new friend here who's a competitor and uh he showed me his whole factory and operations this week. I walked through and um uh kind of explained how the industry works, answered my questions about uh the industry in general and and some things I wanted to know. And um uh we're we're super excited about that. But we can't just have a million positions because you're not going to dramatically outperform if you start getting uh too many positions. So we took profits on this. Uh again, we think it can go higher. We also trimmed a little bit um uh not a ton because we do think this one's going this one's going to go a lot higher than another 40 or 50%. Uh which is uh Albamarl. This thing's up almost triple off the bottom now. So we took some profits. Think it's going to consolidate for a little while but this is going a lot higher over time. So we still have a a core position in that. Um so just want to kind of go through these. Uh Albamaro building this is a weekly basis. So, I'm going to I'm doing this as an exercise because there are a lot of new listeners and I want to show you guys what it means to zoom out. So, we're going to look at what I consider a short-term chart, which is only the last 10 years, and then we'll go into a longer term chart, which is the last 30 years. Uh, but this is a normal consolidation. Uh, I love, you know, we did a article on Advanced Auto Parts a few weeks ago talking about what they've been doing and everything else and like there's some credit card nonsense noise out in the short term because 3 days the credit card sales were down and all these idiot sellside analysts are like, "Oh my god." You know, look, um, all I can tell you is this. The same company that downgraded PayPal this week at $60. Okay. Is the same company that upgraded Alibaba at $320 and downgraded Alibaba at $60 when we were buying it until the our fingers bled all over the keyboard. We were buying so much. So, um, we loved seeing the downgrade from Morgan Stanley this week on PayPal. uh super excited because uh they made us so much money downgrading the stock at 60 so we could get our hands on unlimited numbers of shares uh and and benefit from from their short-term folly. Uh and that's what we try to do is we look under the curtain. So Albamout still plenty to go but that's just three bagger off the bottom nearly is uh that's a lot in a short period of time. So it's going to consolidate and we wanted to reap some of the benefits. Uh Boeing up big. I mean was 130 in April. Uh now it's you know got up to 250. It's back over 200. This is long-term play duopoly. We love it. BABA. Everyone's like, "What's happening to the BABA?" I don't know. It's gone straight the f up and now it's consolidating gains like like stocks do when they go straight up in a short period of time. So chillax, ladies and gentlemen. We took off, as you know, all of our options six to 7x on the spreads. Uh but we we have kept our 100% of our position and uh no change there. Uh Baxter's coming off the lows here. We love this one in 2026. Defensives, healthc care, staples are going to do the best in the typically the most volatile year of the four-year cycle and we're excited to see that. Dividend payers in an even easing cycle. That whole group will go. BU's just coming off the mat. That's up almost double off the lows. Um, we haven't talked a lot about that because that was our our Chinese play for people who were not clients with us uh that got the lows in Baba and BU was a lagard. Um, and it's it's been a great one and um uh it was just a way to get people into China that missed the the Baba train. Uh Crown Castle, this is going to be a winner in 2026. Uh we've gone did an article a couple of weeks ago. dividend payer, pure play, paying down debt, sold off the unprofitable B business that was sucking all the cash. We love this play. Cooper Standard straight up. I mean, you all have been with me for a while. $510 initial basis in May of 2022 when we came out on the claiming countdown on Fox Business. Things been straight up to went up to 40. Eight bagger. Now it's at 35 headed to 100. This thing's going to earn over $10 at the top of this cycle a couple years out. Uh, and the only question is whether it's a 10 or 20 multiple excited comtock resources has been straight up. So, you're going to see a lot of these and be like, should I get out? They've moved so much. We're going to look at the monthly chart in a little bit and you're going to see how most of these haven't even begun even though they're up double and triple from where we started talking about them on the podcast. Uh, Dagio, this is going to be a 2026 play. Defensives, dividend payers, uh, staples in volatility. We absolutely love this here. Uh, play on the premiumization, people drinking less and drinking better, higher margin stuff. Disney, I'm taking the kids next week. Barring rain, we're going on Christmas Day. That's what they wanted to do. They make the calls. Uh, so that'll be fun. And, uh, Disney's just getting started. Uh, I mean, look, it's up off $85 basis, but it's it's it's got a long runway ahead. Estee Lauder has been a rocket ship off the lows. already doubled off the lows, just getting started. This is a long-term play. Uh Etsy cash flow's been strong. Stock is kind of consolidating here, waiting for some certainty from the new CEO, uh but continues to generate cash. They just authorize a huge buyback. So, we're comfortable there. Uh GenerRack, you know, continues to do exactly what it does every cycle. Has a huge run, then it works its way higher just like we're doing here. Then it consolidates back and and then it has its final parabolic move every five years. No change here. Still the leader in home standby generators and a monster call option on the data center play. They've got a half a billion dollar backlog on that as well. Canada Goose continues to provide record free cash flow, record revenues, familyowned. You know, it's doing more revenues and more free cash flow than it was up here at $50 and $70 a share. It's at 14. They rejected a $15 buyout or whatever it was. This thing will work higher over time. We love it. It's a play on the China recovery and it's going well. China luxury is going well. GXO Logistics, yes, it's doubled off the the lows from April and yes, it's just getting started. We did a full 1-hour interview, 45minute interview with the new CEO, Patrick Keller. Brad Jacobs finally stepped down as executive chairman as he has always done. Uh, and in United Rentals, I think after he stepped down as chairman, uh, I think it went up another 30 or 40 bags. So, um, uh, for those of you who think this story, Brad is stepping down, uh, for any other reason than to focus on QXO, you're strongly mistaken. He's stepping down because he feels confident he can step down now. It's in good hands. And uh and this story can just start to rip in the US with Patrick Keller at the helm from DHL, CEO of North America. Uh Hormell again getting ready for the defensive play in 2026. Dividend payers staples protein play. Skippies Planters uh Spam for those of you who eat Msubi, which is fake sushi with ham on it. That's a West Coast thing. West Coast. Uh, you got your Hormel. We're happy about that one. Intel has been a rocket ship this year. Double off the lows. No one wanted it in September of last year at 18 and 19 bucks when I went on Vney and Co. and Vney looked at me like I had three heads. Now it's up double. This is going to work higher over time. Consolidating parabolic gains in the short term. National Oil Well, Varco, uh, up 50% off the lows. Early days, ladies and gentlemen. This is going to be a multi-year play on energy. Fizer just getting started here. Uh short-term noise with nervous sellside people into year end with their bonuses. And uh this is going to be a perfect play. 7% yield for 2020 six easing cycle defensive healthc care lowest relative valuation in 25 years. generational opportunity. PayPal, record- free cash flow, revenue growing, margins increasing, and these sellside idiots can't get out of their way. This is these are the exact same idiots that were downgrading Alibaba at $60 a share. This thing is a cash flow monster. Alex Chris is delivering everything he said he would do. And this thing's going and they just applied to be a bank, which is another story, which is what SoFi did. And I'm telling you, this is a hundred times better business than SoFi will ever be in their wildest, wetest dreams. And by the way, you do not have a CEO that the minute the stock goes up is going to dump a $2 billion equity offering on your head like you see every time SoFi stock pops up, not drops a couple billion dollars on the retail investor's head. So, people just don't get it, but they'll eventually figure it out. In the short term, the market's a voting machine based on emotion, in the long term, it's a weighing machine based on fundamentals. And while everyone was bitching and moaning about PayPal is not moving, we were in the market buying it like crazy this week. So, thank you very much, Cellside. You're the same that gave us the opportunity in Alibaba and we have sent you Christmas cards because you made us a boatload of money off of your calls enabling us to get a ton of stock at cheap prices. Uh Papa John's pizza, wait till those dividend checks come from Trump. Right now they're going to the military. $1,776. Uh that's a lot of people. That money goes straight into consumer discretionary. Uh and uh I think that if the Supreme Court votes down the um the tariffs, he's just going to say he's not going to give it back to the foreign countries. He's going to just pay it all out in $2,000 dividend checks. And then he's going to work around the Supreme Court decision using other laws to still keep doing the tariffs on top of it. But the money he already collected, he's not returning that. He's just going to dividend it out. companies, restaurant companies that have been left for dead, consumer discretionary are going to boom. Uh G, uh QXO, that's Brad Jacob's new vehicle. I'm going to see him again in person in um January when I'm doing my TV in New York. And uh he invited me to his book signing and I'm reading his new book, How to Make a Few More Billion Dollars, which is absolutely amazing uh and very inspiring. We love that. Uh Stanley Black & Decker housing play rates going down. Housing's going to be a theme in 2026. We're excited. Took longer because Powell was belligerent, but now it's happening and it's going to work. Uh these are just general ETFs with general market stuff. VF Corp. Okay, again, uh doubled off the bottom. It's early days, ladies and gentlemen. I'm telling you, Bracken, this Bracken will take this thing back up close to if not all all-time highs over the next 5 years. This guy knows exactly what he's doing. If you missed the interview we did with him on the podcast, go to uh YouTube, type in hedge fund tips, Bracken Daryl, you'll see the CEO of VUPC Corp laying out the plan uh and he's executing. This thing is just getting started. Uh, and then XBI we took profits on so we could make room for rather than having something that can go up another 40 or 50% uh we're going to have something that we think can go up 3 to 4x over the next few years and new clients existing clients are already in it everywhere there was room new uh if you're not in it which is very few of you that have maybe accounts that have no margin capability like cash or IRA accounts uh just email me. I'll give you the name. You can either add money to your account or figure out how to, you know, do it on your own. And then um brand new clients will all have a position in this and existing clients all have a position in this. And many of you have actually sent in a lot of new money uh in the last few weeks. You all have positions in this. So uh very very excited for you and for everyone here. Moving along, uh this is the monthly version of all this stuff. So you could see XBI has a lot more upside but generally look we don't buy ETFs. We bought this because we don't buy individual stocks and we wanted to participate in the recovery of biotech and it's happened and it's going to continue to happen but there are just much higher IRS we can get uh and we had to make room doing that. So ring the register and move on uh VF Corp. So, look, huge move off the lows early early days, ladies and gentlemen. Uh, where you guys are going to get all tricked out is when it goes back up to like 35 or 40 and then it goes back to 25 before it goes up to 80. This is where a lot of you guys are going to lose. What's going to happen is it's going to go up to 30 35. All of you who didn't believe it at 12 and 15 are going to buy it at 35 and then it's going to drop a third down to 20 25 and it's going to stay there for a while. Maybe go down to 20 21 and take out all the whiny you know whats as I always like to talk about and just when everyone pukes out uh that's when it'll work its way up to new highs. So um so that's that. Stay tuned. Next five years you're going to see it happen in real time. Uh we have Stanley Black & Decker coming off the lows. This is a whole housing recovery play. Very much like the uh two 2001 lows. It just kept going lower and lower and then it tries to work itself higher. Checks back and then boom, back up to new highs. This will work itself up. It's taken all the costs out of the business. Add a little bit of tailwind in housing and we're off to the races. Uh Planet Pizza, you can see these long-term consolidations by huge secular rallies. I think we're going to see that. PayPal, same story. This is the PayPal is the poster child for the normal sentiment of the mammoth cycle. And I love it because I always get these nervous Nellies right around here at aversion, just so you guys are aware. Okay, here's here it is. Okay, so you have discouragement is down there. Wall of worry and then they drop the trapoor to aversion. That's where we are right now. And this is when everyone gets thrown out of their stock right down here because they got all excited. It was recovering. OH, WE'RE GOING BACK UP. And then all the people who couldn't buy it at 50 couldn't get enough at $89.90. Trapoor down to 60. I, you know, I was saying I hope it goes to 49 to really take the weak sisters out. But, you know, we're probably going to bottom around here, if not a little lower. And then, um, that's when we'll work back up to 90. At 90, there will be a lot of volatility. A lot of these guys will be like, "Oh, I'm back to even at 90." uh where they bought after the huge run. Uh and then once we get those guys out, it'll go straight back up. Stock will be 150, 200 bucks. And all the idiots that downgraded it at 60 will be upgrading it at 150, 170, 200, they won't be able to get enough. And they will be doing our work for us, creating a market for us to help everyone out who can't get enough at 200 when they wanted nothing at 60. That's how we use it. Fizer, okay, early days. It's moved up a few bucks. Now they're downgrading it. Now, no one's going to be able to figure out what happens in early next year when it goes to 30 and people are going to miss a 50% move. And if you have it positioned the way we do, that's means a lot more in terms of returns, etc. National Oil Well, Varco, so excited. 10 to $15. Okay, early days, ladies and gentlemen. This thing is going to work its way back up to 60 over the next three years. We're going to have a massive energy cycle that no one's expecting. Intel, same story. Consolidate, work higher over time when they get that fab humming. Hormell, you get a massive dividend while you wait. Been raising the dividend every single year for 60 years. Just barely getting its its sea legs back, turning back up. This will work its way over 50 over the next couple of years. Then you got um GXO. We covered everything with Patrick Kellaher last week. This hasn't even begun. uh goose we covered uh Generrack doing this normal wall of worry climbing its way back from the from the dead in 2023 when we initiated and now uh probably another couple years working its way higher back over 200 everyone will be like oh back to 200 I'm going to get out and that's when it makes its next parabolic move with the data centers with the housing recovery etc is in a similar spot uh as PayPal discouragement wall of worry aversion then it'll take it up here and no one will believe it and it'll go higher. Uh Estee Lauder monster double move off the lows this year and now uh people think it's over. It hasn't even begun. This this has not even begun. This is like the great financial crisis recovery. We're probably here right here in 2009. If you're watch, if you're listening to this versus watching this and you can't see this, I would strongly urge you guys to watch this week's uh version. Disney hasn't even started. It's just getting started. Uh Dagio, this is a generational buy opportunity. No one wants it. They think no one's ever going to drink again. I'm telling you, these people get on the GLP1s, they get off the GLP1s, and they still don't change their habits. It's just they're upgrading. It was mismanaged for a while. They had an absolute clown without a circus running the business. And like Warren Buffett says, buy a business that's so good, one day a ham sandwich will run it cuz uh that's exactly what happened. Now they've got an adult in the room. This thing is going to turn and over time it's going to work up to new highs. This is one of the greatest franchises in history. Comtock Resources again, everyone's so excited. It went from $8 our initial basis uh up to 30 and now it pulled back a little bit. Th this this is a multi-year move back to levels you haven't seen since the early 2000s and we've been talking about this for many many months. Cooper standard here we are ladies and gentlemen straight from 5 to 40. Now it's at 35. It's headed back higher over time. We're excited about that one. C uh Crown Castle getting paid a nice dividend while you wait. This thing's going to work higher now that they got rid of the uh cash sucking fiber business. Got rid of that albatross around their neck. Now it's a pure play. Money machine returning capital to owners. BYU we covered uh Baxter. This is going to be the healthc care play. You're going to wake up. It's going to be an announcement about the pump. It's all fixed and this is going to be a $30 stock and just getting started and no one's going to understand what happened and they didn't buy any in the hole. So, they don't benefit because they bought their first shares at 30 and they didn't buy a lot more at 20. So, uh they'll get to 30 and get out. Some of you will be smart. You'll get to 30 and you're up 50%. Or if you had some at 30 and you got more at 20, you'll be up like 33% and then as it works its way back, you'll be you'll make multibags over time, get paid a dividend while you wait. Baba, we know the story. It's got to consolidate this for a while and make its next move. Uh Boeing duopoly consolidating before its next big move. And Albamaro again, monster move shaved a little bit. Had to take a little bit, but this is this is just beginning. this will work higher over 200 over time. Uh just uh that's that. We just had to uh not be pigs, take some profits and uh Advance Auto, same story. Building its base. They're doing everything they said they were going to do. This will work its way higher. So uh that's the story. Uh we could end now, but actually we haven't started yet. We got a lot to cover this week. So uh let's go through some economic data. China car sales through the roof. You can see here record highs in December. That's benefiting Cooper Standard. This is from Stiffel uh by the way and they have a price target of $43 on the stock. You can see the forward multiples uh on uh 2027. Ibida estimates are six times forward and um so that's that Stiffel actually upgraded PayPal to 75. They applied for a bank uh so they can do uh service their business customers better similar to what SoFi did but they've got a much bigger install base already and that'll be a good thing. Here is the uh Sloomer data from RBC thanks to our friends over there. So yeah, big move off the bottom. Probably consolidating a little bit up here. Uh on this one, it's looking less a little more oversold than overbought. So maybe we could push through to new highs uh into year end. We shall see some different takes here. Equal weight just broke to new highs. That's good for market breath. Russell Small Cap just broke to new highs. This is a play that we've been talking about. This is going to be a big theme. Measured move points to 3,200 plus. This game is just getting started. Bullishness not fully at an extreme yet. Uh let's see what else. Europe breaking out to new highs. Germanyy's been consolidating for a while. We'll see what happens with that. Uh Hong Kong big move consolidation. It'll break through this and then just keep going. So Bob's got a lot more upside. Just going to take a few more years. And 10-year yield still in this range. You know, our call at the be when it was at five. Everyone said it was going to break through five. We said no, it's going below four before it goes above five. Uh and we thought it would happen by the end of this year. We got 12 days. We're at 4.11. Let's see if we can get down to 3.99. Um maybe if not this year, first quarter and next year. 10-year yield seems to be up against resistance and we did get down into the threes uh a little bit earlier this year. So, we actually did do it. Let's see if we can end the year there. I doubt it, but uh the dollar, I told you this was a false breakout back to resuming its downtrend. That's going to persist for some time. Uh Canadian dollar, see you skeptical Canadians, I told you you guys were going to be rich. The looney is going higher. Okay. So, smile for once and stop saying sorry all the time and uh enjoy your day in the sun because it's just beginning there uh Canada. So, we got a lot of Canadian friends there. Energy. Uh we'll maybe we'll go through this next week. A lot of commercial buying in the commitments of traders. This is going higher in 2026. Um like this uh fake out here that's going to catch everyone off sides. Maybe they take it down to 55 before they shoot straight up to 70. Uh 6570. I think we could have a move in oil over the next 18 months. And I think that's that on the Sloomer stuff. We've got some data we want to cover. PayPal got upgraded to 75 and then some idiot downgraded it. They're just doing us favors. They don't even know it yet. They're going to be on the same Christmas card list that the Babaell side guys who downgraded at 60 are on. Longerterm view of IPO activity starting to tick up again. Power generation capacity, we got to catch up. That's going to help the comtock resources and the Generex of the world. Retail net purchases of US equities starting to move up. Short interest is still high. Uh what do we got here? Big year for tax refunds. That's going to that's probably that's why the average draw down since 1950 in a midterm election year aka next year is 17.3%. I don't think we're going to get that. I do think we're going to get a 10 or 12% maybe even a 15% probably 10% at some point in the year. And the reason I don't think it's going to be 17% is because uh there is a lot of fiscal stimulus and you are in an easing cycle and mini QE is starting again. So, I think the the corrections are going to be run-of-the-mill that you get every 13 months on average you get a 10% correction. I think 2026 will be no different. I think there'll be a lot more volatility and consolidation, but this fiscal stimulus is real. The tax refunds, the deregulation, the Fed in the picture, a lot of positive things, and we'll we'll know more as we get more data. Uh biggest two-e outflow from tech funds since February of 2025. Interesting. Bottom. You guys, if you were here, you you knew it first. Bottom up consensus. Expect substantial margin expansion in 2026. Fund stress calling for a 10% return in 2026. I think that's reasonable. Um, that would be well above the average of a midterm election year of 2.4. I would I would take the under on fund strat this year. I'd say 5 to 7% on the indices. If you own outside the mag seven, uh you could make a lot more there. There going to be a lot of stocks under the surface that double and triple that don't even move the needle on the index. Uh because their weights are so low and that's where we're going to play and we're going to be smiling so wide. Look, we could eat three bananas sideways this year. We're going to eat, I hope, two to six bananas sideways next year. Uh I think we will and I'm pretty excited about it. Uh tariffs What tariffs? Yeah, we know uh travel Oracle's free cash flow. This is the problem with tech. If you're overweight, S&P index or MAG 7, this is what you're dealing with. The return on invested capital is not there yet. And the question is whether people will keep funding it to get it there. And with these type of numbers this early, the answer is the market doesn't know at the moment. And that's why we had monstrous gear even though we had zero mag 7. Uh cyclicals versus defenses. Cyclical starting to move by the way. Uh dividend yields. It's going to be a year. Main Street plays outperforming Wall Street plays. contribution. Oh, this is key. Contribution to S&P earnings growth. You can see here that the dynamic is changing. Whereas in 2024, the MAG 7 was the majority of the contribution. Starting next year, the unmagnificent 493 is going to be the majority of the contribution with the mag 7 being the minority of the contribution with their earnings growth dramatically decelerating which we have been covering uh for your presidential cycle. So you can see it again ladies and gentlemen kind of followed the map here. first year you get this down cycle early on. Then you get a move off the bottom. Then you get year-end kind of flat consolidation which continues into the first quarter of the second presidential year. Some weakness into the fall. That will be when defensives really pick up and then a rally into year end. Third and fourth years being very strong. So uh we tend to do exceptionally well when other people do poorly. Uh that's kind of our knitting and uh th this year was the exception. Every everyone did well. We did really really well. Um but uh we we're we're looking forward to next year's environment. We love volatility. Big tech has borrowed more in the current quarter than any full year in history other than 2017. Market doesn't love that right now unless we start to see some returns on that. Um what else we got here? We got a lot of stuff for you. This shows the bell curve of returns since 1928. This year it looks like it'll fall into this majority bucket at the top of the bell curve. Uh so we're probably due to one due for one of the tail ends. uh not the extreme tail end but um biggest 4-day percent declines in forward returns US versus international stocks this is starting to change international theme is going to continue dramatic outperformance in 2025 those of you who are with us in 2024 know that and have benefited from it uh that's going to persist over time as the dollar trends lower over time in fits and starts total returns you can see here emerging markets almost double The SNP LNG spurs biggest Gulf Coast pipeline boom in 18 years. Cyclicals versus defensive starting to tick up there. Realized correlation has gone low. That will pick up in the first quarter of next year. Uh this is average annual return spammer or French value based on backward looking what they're saying prospectively is based on what's happened in the recent past. Uh small value will be the largest performer large growth uh will will underperform by 400 basis points a year prospectively. This talks about fiscal impulse. The average December tends to pick up after the 15th. We'll see if that persists into year end. This is fund strat talking about the normal cycle of 2026. We just covered it in the presidential cycle which implies um fourth quarter weakness into the fall followed by year-end rally. This should look more like um uh kind of continuation sideways than weakness into the fall. So, we'll see how that goes. Expectation for rising bond yields are the highest since April 2022. I would take the other side of that. private equity, private credit still the most likely source of a credit event. We actually agree with consensus on that. Profit expectations most bullish since August 2021. Uh August 2021, if you know, um market short-term topped at the end of 2021, so we're not quite at an extreme there. allocation to stocks plus commodities highest since February 2022. Not yet extreme there. She talks about the OpenAI sprawling network circular deals. Transport companies have materially underperformed to the most extreme level since 2000. What did they do over the next 5 years? Dramatic outperformance. That helps the Boeings of the world. We would have loved to have UPS if they would change the CEO already. Um Kevin Walsh becomes favorite for next bed chair. Uh yeah, I would say that if if uh Wars is chosen, who I said on Vanney is a Hawk in Dove's clothing, uh I think you have a chance of a 15% correction in 2026 versus a 10 or 11%. Um I think he's the wrong pick. I think he's going to be another Powell who will be belligerent always. You know, I mean, look, there's there's a very strong aspect of the inflation calls over the last 5 years where you could say always wrong, never in doubt. I think he's moderated in recent months and he has a chance to go out as a champion if he does one more cut and get away with the murder that he caused. a lot of banks, a lot of people by missing it. It's no inflation. Then he had to go too fast, too aggressive. Uh I I think he's got a chance to win, but the point is Wars will be the same thing. He's going to say, "I'll do whatever you say." And then he's going to get in and he's going to be king and he's going to do whatever he wants. And he's an academic. And um I think the market is underestimating that risk right now. Uh the bond market will love it because it'll feel that the independence is intact. The equity market I think will suffer from it in the short term which will help us. But, uh, that's what I would that that that could be the biggest kind of mix in 2026 to watch out for cuz there's a lot of pressure around Trump to put in Wars because I think Wars can be controlled uh, versus Hasset is going to be more dovish and you know the the perception is is more inclined to do what Trump has been a proponent of since the day he was born as a real estate guy, which is lower rates. So, uh I think that we do if we ever want to bring debt to GDP down, I think we have to run growth hotter than normal, which is means inflation is going to run above trend, aka 3% is the new 2%. And like post World War II where we brought debt to GDP down from 120 down to 53 by 1957 or 63 by 1957. Uh we have an opportunity to do that with Hasset and much less opportunity to do it with WH and all you have to do is go back to the tape and the guy's been hawkish his entire career. Now all of a sudden he wants a job. He's tired of being stuck in academia, unable to get a job. So now he wants a big job. So he's saying he'll do whatever he's going to do. But I'm telling you, once he's in, he is the dovish clothes come off and he's going to be a hawk at the wrong time. And it's not going to be good because uh in a failed attempt to help the bond markets, he's going to effectively destroy them. So um next week, I'll tell you how I really feel. All right. wage growth e eases running close to prepandemic trend. That's good to see. And what else? Anything else super important here.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller says rates could be cut by as much as a full point. Amen. Hallelujah. Lifting off and looking good stock market and sentime results. Here is our article of the week. On Tuesday, we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America global fund manager survey. This month surveyed 238 institutional managers with 368 64 billion assets under management. You can tell a lot of people are on vacation. Here are the five key points. Fund manager sentiment based on cash levels, equity allocation, and global growth expectations rose to 7.4 4 from last month's 6.4, the highest level since July of 2021. So, getting a little frothier when they were despondent. Uh, two, global growth expectations are now the most optimistic since August 2021, rising a net 18%. Uh, strong global economy from last month's net 3%. However, while economic expectations continue to catch up to stock prices, they are only slightly above neutral and well below prior periods of froth. Three fund managers average cash level fell to a record low of 3.3% down from last month's 3.7%. There have been nine instances since 1998 when cash levels dropped below 3.6% with global stocks falling an average of 2% in the following months. So we're seeing some a little bit of chop here. Makes sense. Four fund managers continue to neglect the energy sector with allocations still a net 26% underweight and nearly two standard deviations below the average of the past 20 years making it the most underweight equity sector. When the rubber band gets stretched the mean reversion becomes inevitable. If you were with us during 2020 we uh absolutely made a killing on buying Exxon at $33 when oil went negative and uh we are at a situation similar. The only difference this time is I don't want the play the price sensitive plays. I don't think they've come down enough relative to the price of oil. Uh I want to play the derivative plays uh and the servicesers and we'd like that through national oil well Varco and more on the gas side with com stock than the oil uh side. So five managers have also left cons consumer staples four dead with allocation falling four percentage points to a net 20% underweight making it the second most underweight sector as volatility picks up in a midterm presidential cycle and money comes off the sidelines in search of yield. We expect staples to move back into vogue in a hurry uh 100%. You know, we we often do an article in December uh entitled the last shall be first. This time will be no different. The last is defensives and staples and healthc care in 2025. They are probably going to be amongst the best performers in 2026 and you will benefit. Boeing update. Boeing has come a long way from earlier this year when the uninvestable was the consensus call and merely mentioning the stock earned double takes. It is remarkable what happens when you put a leader with a true hands-on engineering background in charge of a company building some of the most complex machines on the planet. And not just any engineer. Kelly Ortberg is a true one of one of a kind with a long track record of turning an engineer first culture into massive shareholder value. At Rockwell Collins, he doubled sales in six years and more than quadrupled shareholder quadrupled shareholder value before selling the business at a nice premium to United Technologies in 2019. We have long flagged Ortberg as a true home run hire and key catalyst in the Boeing turnaround. And so far, he has proven to be the exact medicine the company needed. The Boeing thesis has always been a simple one for us. This is a national champion and proxy for US manufacturing that operates in a growing duopoly backed by a $636 billion backlog. A backs stop like that provides a long and forgiving runway for management to fix self-inflicted wounds, plenty of those, and work its way back on track. It certainly helps to have the world's greatest salesman and ultimate closer in the White House with a Boeing order increasingly serving as the price of admission in US trade negotiations. At this point, Boeing owes him a custom trophy. And if his pitch to sell beautiful Boeing planes has been impressive, just wait until Intel chip sales start next. So, greatest salesman in the history of Boeing. Of course, while piling on blockbuster orders makes for great headlines, demand has never been Boeing's problem. The entire story has come down to production. Deliver more airplanes, generate more cash. It's really that simple. As Kelly Orberg applies his playbook of operational excellence and whips Boeing back into shape, we expect that to translate into the long awaited and coveted greater than 10 billion of annual free cash flow target that the market still fails to appreciate. The way we see it, turbulence is in the rearview mirror. Smooth skies ahead. Kelly Ortberg, CNBC Post earnings, giving a great highlevel update on the state of the turnaround and how the administration's dealmaking is booking Boeing demand deep into the next decade. You should listen into that. We've highlighted the key from the most recent earnings report. You can read by the stars and the circles, but here are the 10 key points. Number one, for the first time since Q4 of 2023, Boeing generated positive free cash flow coming in at 238 million compared to a quarterly outflow of 1.96 billion last year. The improvement came from a higher commercial deliveries and better working capital both year and sequentially. Since the earnings call, management has updated fullear guidance and now expects an outflow of $2 billion versus the prior 2.5 billion. as the 700 million DOJ payment was pushed into 2026. Looking ahead, they expect to generate low positive singledigit billions in 2026, a major year-on-year step forward, and still view the path to more than 10 billion over the next few years is very achievable. Two, commercial airplane deliveries reached 160 for the quarter, up 38% year-onear, and the highest quarterly total since 2018. By August of this year, Boeing had already surpassed last year's fullear delivery count. Stronger deliveries lifted the commercial segment to 11.1 billion in revenue, up 49% year-on-year. The commercial backlog now stands at 535 billion and includes more than 5,900 airplanes with both the 737 and 787 sold firm into the next decade. Three. After stabilizing production at 38 per month and meeting all required KPIs, Boeing jointly agreed with the FAA in October to increase the 737 max output to 42 per month. Management expects the to exit the firm firmly at 42 per month rate and sees no supply chain constraints that would prevent further increases. Any production hikes beyond 42 per month will occur in increments of five no sooner than 6 months apart. And we'll use the exact same review process with the F FAA. Four. The 787 program continued to stabilize production at seven per month with management expecting to finish the year at eight per month and to move to 10 next year. South Carolina site expansion which effectively doubles the manufacturing footprint is aimed at supporting rates above 10 with current market demand allowing for rates in the teens. Management does expect some supply chain constraints specifically around seat certifications and noted that progress is being made with targeted actions underway with suppliers. Five. The defense, space, and security segment generated 6.9 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 25% year-onear from 5.54. Boeing booked 9 billion in orders from the segment, bringing the backlog to a record 76 billion. Management continues to make progress, de-risking development programs and improving profitability with quarterly operating margins at 1.7% compared to negative 43.1% last year. There have been no changes so far in 2025 for the defense business. A welcome change after more than 13 billion in changes over the past 5 years and management maint remains confident that the segment can return to historical performance level. Six, the global services segment delivered quarterly revenue of 5.4 billion, up 10% year-on-year from 4.9 billion. The segment booked 8 billion in orders during the quarter, bringing the year-to- date booktoill ratio to 1.2 and pushing backlog to about 25 billion. Profitability remains strong with operating margins of 17.5% up 50 basis points year-on-year and both the commercial and government business businesses again delivering doubledigit margins. Seven management recorded a 4.9 billion charge tied to the updated 777 X certification timeline which increased quarterly loss per share by $645. While there are no major technical issues with the airplane or its engine, authorization began, the next major phase of certification flight testing has been delayed, pushing the expected first delivery to 2027 instead of 2026. Management noted that demand for the aircraft remains strong and that they view the 777X as the company's next flagship. With the charge serving has a conservative estimate that could allow them to beat the updated timeline. The program is expected to be a free cash flow headwind of about 2 billion in 2026 with improvements in 2027 and cash flow neutrality by 2028 followed by positive contributions thereafter. eight cash investments in marketable securities stood at 23 billion at the quarter end with management expects to rise about 28 to about 28 billion now that both Jeepson and Spirit transactions have closed. Boeing also maintains access to 10 billion in undrawn credit facilities with strengthening the balance sheet and supporting the investment grade rating as a top priority against consolidated debt of 53 billion. Nine. During the call, management had guided for the Jeeppes deal to close during Q4 and for the Spirit deal deal to close shortly thereafter. Both transactions are now complete with the 10.55 billion allcash jeep deal closing in early November and the 8.3 billion Spirit acquisition closing in early December. Management noted that no other M&A is a focus at the moment. and 10. After more than 3,000 hours of lab testing and analysis, Boeing has a final set of design changes to permanently address the engine anti-ICE issue for the 7377 and 73710. Both aircraft are expected to receive certification in 2026 with the process expected to be straightforward. So, here are the earnings call. We highlighted the important parts.

Moving on. Estee Lauder update. Here are earnings. Let's go through the highlight reel with number one coming in at Estee Lauder reported Q1 revenue of 3.48 billion up 4% year-on-ear ahead of consensus by $98 million. Organic growth was 3%. A massive sequential acceleration from the 13% decline in Q4. Adjusted EPS of 32 cents also beat expectations by 14 cents and more than doubled versus the prior year period. Mainland China surprised to the upside in Q1 with revenue up 9% to 532 million as consumer sentiment continued to rebound. Estee ladder significant outperformed the prestige beauty market in China with retail sales growing at double-digit pace versus high singledigit growth for the industry. The company gained share across every category, marking five of the past six quarters of prestige beauty share gains led by seven brands posting doubledigit growth and Leil Labo delivering nearly tripledigit growth. Three, the America saw net sales decline 2% to 1.17 billion pressured by ongoing challenges in department stores and softness at certain retailers with elevated inventory levels. That said, Estee Lauder has maintained prestige beauty share per year to date with meaningful volumedriven share gains in the US. This was led by the Estee Lauder brand, which gained share across skincare, makeup, and fragrance for the brand's third consecutive quarter of overall gains. Four, profitability continued to improve with adjusted gross margins of 73.3%. Up 60 basis percent uh 60 basis points year-on-year from 72.7% for the full year. Management continues to expect gross margins to be flat to modestly positive versus 74% in 2025 while noting meaningful upside potential remains the most important metric in the estee turnaround. Adjusted operating margins expanded by 300 basis points in Q1 to 7.3% ahead of expectations. Management expects operating margins to improve sequentially throughout the year with fullear guidance of 9.4 to 9.9% as the business works its way back toward solid double-digit margins over time. Five profit recovery and growth plan continues to perform well with management expecting to be substantially completed in fiscal year 27 and the majority of the full rate benefits realized in the same year. The program is expected to result in 1.2 to 1.6 billion of restructuring and related charges with 697 million incurred to date and delivered annual gross benefits of 800 million to a billion dollars. This at this point SA Louderder has approved incentives representing more than 70% of the expected gross benefits and over 50% of the anticipated charges and nearly 60% of the projected net reduction in position. Six management continues to lean into higher growth, higher margin digital channels, launching several brands on Amazon's premium beauty store across the US, Canada, Japan, the UK, and Mexico. The company also expanded global distribution on Tik Tok shop with brands such as Mac, Clinique, and Dr. Jart, debuting during the quarter, and announced a new partnership with Spotify aimed at modernizing and scaling the DTC business and building a best-in-class omni channel platform. This accelerated push drove global online organic sales to double digit growth, up from mid-s single digits in Q4, performing the broader prestige beauty market in the online channel. Seven travel retail has begun to recover and show improving momentum with air traffic in the key highan market up 14% supporting strong demand and driving double-digit growth for during golden week. Importantly, inventory levels remain materially lower than a year ago, leaving the business far better right-sized relative to retail demand. Management continues to expect global travel retail to return to modest growth for the full year and plans to double down on the segment in the west and in the Americas where exposure is lower driven by distribution expansion and consumerf facing investments. Eight capex decline 32% year-on-year to 96 million during the quarter as management continues to prioritize higher return on invested uh ROI investments with fullear capex expected to run at 4% of projected sales. The focus remains on high ROI. Consumer facing incentives with investment in this area up 4% during the quarter during 14 net freestanding stores which management expects to drive meaningful improvement in returns over time. Nine. The fullear tariff related headwind is expected to be about 100 million impact to profitability with management continuing to leverage available trade programs and further optimize the regional manufacturing footprint to bring production closer to the consumer. These actions are expected to offset more than half the imp uh anticipated tariff impact. While management continues to evaluate additional PRGP initiatives and potential pricing actions and 10 management reaffirmed the fiscal year 2026 outlook calling for net sales growth of 2 to 5% and organic growth of 0 to 3% versus expected prestige beauty industry growth of 2 to 3%. Adjusted operating margins are set to expand for the first time in four years, driving fullear adjusted EPS of 187 to 207 versus 151 last year, representing 27 to 37 24 to 37% earnings growth. We love the sound of that. Uh here are the keys from the earnings call and um some additional commentary. Fear and greed at neutral 51 active managers a little bit overweight.

Uh transports earnings top 30 weights all also revised up but by 19 basis points for 2026. So earnings going up. Uh today we saw core CPI come in lower than expected, CPI come in lower than expected. We'll see as the data continues to come out in coming weeks. Uh earnings growth for forward multiple at 22.5. You back out the MAG 7. If you're not in the MAG 7, it probably drops down to 18 or 17. Much more reasonable. And earnings growth for the S&P for next year. Uh double digits with 309 per share in the S&P 500. All right, so the podcast is over. Now we're going to move on to the ask me anything questions. And uh we got quite a few good ones. So for those of you who enjoy that, stick around. We're going to start with Kyle M. Um, we covered Generrack and Advanced Auto Parts. We're excited about both of them, so we won't belabor that. Victor Lynn, uh, appreciate it. SLB, we've covered that a million times. We like it. We just like National Oil Well Varco better. Um, Monsanto, we don't like we that we've covered that a million times. Um, it's fine, but we don't we don't like it that much. Allan asks, "Do you reinvest dividends or take the cash?" I always take the cash and then I can proactively reinvest in the same stock if it's at a reasonable valuation, but more likely than not, if it's up a lot, I'll put it in something that's just getting started. Tim D, thoughts on Dualingo? I covered that before. Great product going to get wiped out probably by AI. Chris Williamson, can you look at path? UIP path looks good here. This is a software play. This is going to be another problem most likely with AI, but let's take a quick look there. Um, free cash flows leveled off. Revenues, margins have leveled off. So, it's a broken growth story is basically what you have here. Um, let's just take a quick look at a couple of things that are usually. So, it's training at 8.5 billion. All right, let's take a look at some of the financials here. First off, let's just see what they do. I mean, the key thing here is you better be a software expert and understand how uh end to end automation a range of robotic process US internationally blah blah blah tenant platform cloud automation cloud infrastructure. All right, let's take a look at the financials. revenues are down from 1.8 down to 1.4. So, complete broken growth story. Uh, let's just see here. Balance sheet looks healthy. Free cash flow is okay. Let's see what they're doing to the share account. So, look at this. Look at these filthy pigs. Number one, look at stockbased comp. half a billion dollars in 2022. And at the same time, the share count is going through the roof from 152 million to 546 million. Look, they created their own funeral. I I don't like I I won't do business with people like this. If they're going to just disrespect the owners of the business and deletute the hell out of them and pay themselves massive stock breaks comp before they generate any cash I you know and now it's a broken growth story and they got all these shares outstanding you can have it sold to you. I mean maybe the thing on a trading basis can this go higher absolutely but the culture is there. They're a bunch of pigs. Uh, Phipe Andrew Pinkos, can you please take a look at Paraggo? This thing is a value trap. If you want to buy a generic, buy Tea. We've said no about this stock a million times. At some point, we'll be wrong, but there's no signs of growth or recovery. Um, so I got 400 million of cash, 600 million of receivables, and they've got 1.1 billion of debt. So that's not terrible. Their cash flow is 256 million. That's fine. Low return on invested capital business and probably a pretty steady share count, but the revenues aren't going anywhere. They've been doing 4 billion a year forever. No change there. Are they buying in stock? Nope. But they're not issuing it either. Um it's just a dog. I I I I don't I don't think you're really going to get much more hurt here. Uh you have to understand the story. Like how are they going to differentiate themselves a little bit? Maybe they have some non-generic stuff starting up. But uh I've looked at this one a million times. Maybe now it's time to take another look because the price is down a lot. But um not for me. Brad Jay, what do you think of CarMax? Wonder if it's that Brad Jay. I doubt he'd be asking about CarMax, though. All right, let's see. I I don't like the used car business. business. I like the new car business right now, but I'll bet you it's going to work for those of you who can't get enough of it. Looks like revenues, margins, and uh free cash flow is kind of turning the corner a little bit. See what the balance sheet looks like. 204 million in cash, 151 in receivables, 16 billion of debt. Now that I wonder if that how much of that is inventory financing versus actual and that looks that might be floor leases or something like that. I'd have to I'd have to take a closer look at that. Let's take a look at free cash flow picking back up. Income statement hasn't shown any signs of recovery. Let's see. Still pretty soft. buying in the shares. I don't like the business, but I think it works here. So, have at it, Brad. If that's the real Brad J and you make money on this, I want I want you to sign my book when I see you in January. That's that's what I want. Uh JP, hey Tom, longtime listener. I've been very successful following the investing technique Hedge Fund Tips has taught. Thank you for all you share. Uh blah blah blah blah blah been reading a lot lately about automakers definitively coming to build out expanding hybrid offerings beginning January 2027. When do you think the market starts pricing in accelerated earnings growth for Cooper Standard? It already has. The stock moved well ahead of earnings. So now it's consolidating until they actually show them the earnings which they which they will in 2026 and 2027 for sure. Uh so uh yeah it's up 7x uh before they were even earning any material money. So uh market's already price pric pricing in accelerated earnings growth. Now they deliver more than expected and the thing is going to fly. Um fizer if you listen to our last when we announced that position we alluded to what we do but we won't get into any more details as for the benefit of clients only. Jack Hazard. Uh, can you tell Goose starting to selling super high-end hunting gear? Can you tell Goose to start selling super high-end hunting gear? Um, okay. Uh, maybe we'll see. Uh, interested in your thoughts on Maai. I think that's a Chinese liquor company. M O U T AI. I I told you I um it's probably fine. I I just won't buy any other Chinese companies other than Baba or Tencent. Mike Inman and I I've gone into it for a multitude of reasons. Uh, thank you for all your value listening for six months. Turned on to you from a good friend. Well, thank you very much. Oh, by the way, we didn't acknowledge all the people sending in pictures for the merch. Uh, by the way, um, a lot of you have listened to the podcast, made money off the ideas, and you call and you give us money to invest at Great Hill Capital, and we're very grateful for that. Some of you will never be able to uh, reciprocate the value, and and we're a-ok okay with that. We love just giving value, putting out good in the world, and we're going to continue to do that. If you want to reciprocate, uh my suggestion is share it. Share the if you're getting value and making money off of what we're doing for you, share it with one person you care about that loves the markets. An easy way to do that is to wear the merch, get a hat, get a mug. People will ask you questions, and uh it's an easy way to say, "Well, go ahead and listen in for a week or two and see what you think." And then some of you have been generous enough to send in your pictures and show to the hedge fund tips community. And I want to acknowledge Drew Burn who is a consistent supporter for many, many years. Uh and he sent in his picture. It looks like he's in Scotland or Ireland there on a golf course. And um uh that's him with his hat. And many of you have sent in incredible pictures. And keep them coming guys. People want to see other people in the community and we're very very grateful for that. Um K okay can you take a look at energy play KRO and give your thoughts you got it thank you for sharing and uh your question Kronos yeah I think you got one here my friend is this is defense um I think I'm going to like this and you're a quick quick learner Mike Inman. Well, okay. So, they still have a free cash flow problem. So, you're not out of the woods yet, partner. But let's take a look at the financials. Titanium oxide dioxide pigments. Oh, paints, coatings, plastic, paper, fiber, ceramics, foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, a products. Okay. Yeah. Still has a four 4% dividend yield while you wait. Let's take a look, partner. Why do they only have $27 million of cash? And it's not seasonal either. They just literally have $27 million of cash. Receivables have been pretty consistent at 330. The debt is 626 million. Uh well, now you know why the stock is down. What else do they have for assets here? Inventory restricted cash. Geez, I don't like this balance sheet, man. I think they'll find their way out of it, but you got to figure out how much untapped credit they have to get through this soft spot. Whatever is causing that, find out why they have such a soft spot. But last couple of quarters, they're having problems with their free cash flow. Don't like that. Let's see. Revenues seem okay. Interest expense has gone up a lot. So, look, it's trading like it's, you know, people are, it's not at $4 because people think it's definitely staying in business. Um, my bet would be that it will, but this is not a guaranteed thing. Revenues are okay. This business has been struggling for a while. This is a really lowquality business. I would call this a trading vehicle that you might catch a lucky double here, but it's too much risk for me. So, I'm going to pass and I'm going to be wrong and I'm going to watch you make a double. But Buffett always said, "Rule number one is don't lose money. Rule number two is don't forget rule number one." And the good news is when God was handing out FOMO jeans, fear of missing out jeans, he forgot Tom Hayes. So I hope you get a double and triple and I miss it. I'll be perfectly happy cheering for you. Uh JT investor asked for Kyle Marine, the egg company. It's usually pretty cyclical business. So it's a little bit off of its highs. Uh probably not for me. There's no real dislocation yet. Let's see what the free c record free cash flow. You've had a record stock price, record revenues. I like them before they're doing great, not after they're doing great. I I just um I just I just don't think you are I think this is tends to be a cyclical business. Everything seems to be going well right now and Let's see what happened to the share count. They must have done an acquisition. No, I just don't think you're getting enough of a discount. And I think you're buying when all the stars are already aligned. Even though you're getting a little discount, you're not getting enough. It's not It's not what we do here. Jimmy L. Uh yeah, Jimmy, go back to our article. We explained all that. Tim B, could you take a look at Brightar Lottery BRSL? This is like um I have no interest in this. Uh thanks for the question, Gregory. Let's see. All right. Here's a whole 10-page question about whether the election cycle still works. No one cares. We underwrite companies on an individual basis. If two filters, number one is if JP Morgan was going to finance me to buy the entire company with one catch, they'd be the debt financing, I'd have to be the equity financing with 100% of my net worth. So, if it works, the equity slug is small. I make 20x on my money. If it doesn't work, I'm applying as a greeter for Walmart. Uh, if we wouldn't do that deal, we won't be we won't buy even one share. Second filter is if I was to walk into the board of directors and offer to buy the entire company at the price that it was quoted in the public markets today, would they call security because they thought I was out of my mind to make such a low offer? If the answer is no, they would entertain the offer. We won't do the deal. So, doesn't meet these criteria, we are not interested. Uh this is Rahul wants to invest. Uh we'll be in touch. Uh, Rid Ridawan from Singapore. Avid listener since 2021. Nova Nordist, we've covered a million times. Not for us here. I think it's okay for you. We've covered that quite a bit. And I think you're probably okay here, but um I think it's going to take a little while to build that base. Sagar Kanaka. Uh oh. H I Oh, am I? Huh? Negative free cash flow. Revenues seem okay. Healthc care solutions products and healthcare services surgical supplies. Huh. And here comes the balance sheet. Let's see, ladies and gentlemen, they have $32 million in cash and they have $22 in receivables and they have $1.8 billion of debt. How do they have 2.4 billion in current liabilities? We got to just Yeah, 2.4 billion in debt with 32 million of cash. It's trading like it's going out of business because it potentially is. Um gosh, how did they screw this up? Oh, they issued 3.2 billion in debt. H still doing this kind of revenue. Did they do an equity offering? Is that why the stock got smashed? No. still paying themselves out. Stockbased comp I don't know. I mean, this is it's worth looking. Look, here's what I can tell you. If they don't go bankrupt, you will get a 10 bagger plus. So, size it accordingly. It's like a uh it's like an option. And if they do go bankrupt, you lose all your money. So, you know, you put a 2% position, it adds 20% uh or you lose 2%. I mean, it's not the worst a asymmetry, but um I got to I I I got to do more work on this one. This is super risky, but I think I I I actually think it'll work. Uh, but the fact that you could lose all your money means we won't be putting clients in this anytime soon. But I'm going to look at it a little bit more closely. It's a coin flip hedge. You get 10 tails, you lose one. I kind of like that. But um, all right, Carl uh, wants to do the 5 million. Okay, we will call you. Andrew wants to know about Sienna. I think take the money and run Matt, obviously a new listener. Matthew asks, "Can you take a look at QXO Inc.? It's a Brad Jacobs company which does building supplies." Yes, I've heard of it. you happen to own a s ton of stock uh from 12 and $13, but thank you for that and welcome to the podcast. Uh in the meantime, he's asking about HQY. Yeah. I mean, look, it's a lot of this good news. It's it's it's running on all cylinders. A lot of the good news is priced in. It could go higher. It's not for us. We like it. We like stocks when no one wants them, not when everyone wants them. Victor Funheller, uh, thank you for amazing podcast. I share it with everyone who's interested in markets. Curious your thoughts on onex nx. Brazilian company the German I don't know uh not for me next. Okay, Seth. Okay, we'll call you about that. And with that said, we'll be back next week.
