### N/A

**Executive Summary**

He emphasizes a focus on value and buying high-quality assets in dislocated markets.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Santa Claus rally expected from December 15th to 30th.
- Supportive Fed policies.
- Tax loss selling season is in the rear view mirror.
- Potential for a 13% rally in 2026 according to City Bank, mimicking Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
Hayes anticipates a rotation out of the MAG 7 into other sectors due to decelerating earnings growth in tech and accelerating earnings growth elsewhere. He expects defensives, healthcare, cyclicals, industrials and energy to outperform. He also sees a potential rise in energy prices and emphasizes the importance of dividend payers in an easing cycle. He believes that the market will experience volatility in 2026, but fiscal stimulus and an easing cycle will limit the downside.
