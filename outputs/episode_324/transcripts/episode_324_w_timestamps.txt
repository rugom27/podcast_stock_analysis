[00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:02] Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:05] 324th videocast podcast for the week
[00:08] ending January 1st, 2026. Welcome to the
[00:11]new year. Happy new year every everyone.
[00:14]Uh interesting week. Had a little food
[00:16]poisoning incident. Uh that's the bad
[00:18]news. The good news is this will be the
[00:20]first year ever that I achieved one of
[00:22]my top 10 goals for the year. On the
[00:25]first of the year, I hit my target
[00:27]weight basically overnight. Uh, so, uh,
[00:30]you know, turning a negative into a
[00:32]positive for sure. But it's good to be
[00:34]back. And, um, as always, family first,
[00:36]then we'll get down to business. I want
[00:38]to congratulate Annabelle Hayes, uh, who
[00:42]was recognized by Swimwam, the number
[00:44]one swimming publication in the world,
[00:47]uh, for the Swammy 2025 Swami Awards,
[00:50]age group swimmer of the year for 10 and
[00:52]10U. And here's what they had to say. Uh
[00:56]Annabal Hayes from Irvine Nova Aquatics
[00:59]recently turned 11, but she had an
[01:00]electric 2025 as a 10year-old. At the
[01:03]conclusion of the 24-25 SCY season and
[01:07]the 2025 LCM season, she held top 10
[01:10]times in the 18 events and the top time
[01:15]in the country in 11 events. It's
[01:18]unbelievable. Top time in the country in
[01:19]11 events. While she had a strong shortc
[01:22]course season which finished with her
[01:24]leading the country in three events, the
[01:26]100 free, 500 free, and 100 back, her
[01:29]long course season was where she made
[01:31]her mark on the all-time rankings. The
[01:34]only stroke where she didn't hold top 10
[01:36]times was breaststroke, but in long
[01:38]course she was the top swimmer in all
[01:41] four track distances of freestyle, both
[01:43] backstrokes, the 50 and the 200 IM. She
[01:46] set the second fastest times in history
[01:48] in the 100 back where her 10972 was just
[01:53] 4/10en off of Miriam Shehan's 2025 nag
[01:57] record time of 10936 and in the 200 IM
[02:00] where she swam 22987 to Miss Kayla Han's
[02:04] 2019 record of 22870. She also moved up
[02:08] to 14th in the 50 free, 28.90, fourth in
[02:11] the 200 free, 21542, sixth in the 400
[02:14] free, 44204,
[02:17] 20th in the 50 back uh 3331 and ninth in
[02:21] the 50
[02:23] uh 30.82. Hayes was also a member of two
[02:26] NAG record relays in 2025. Irvine Nova
[02:29] Aquatics broke the 10 and under SCY and
[02:31] LCM records in the 200 medley relay and
[02:34] Hayes was the backstroker on both
[02:36] relays. We don't have splits for the
[02:38] short course relay, but she led off in
[02:40] 3425 on the long course relay. So, super
[02:44] exciting. Uh really proud of all the
[02:46] hard work she's doing and uh nice to see
[02:48] top time in the country in 11 swimmer of
[02:51] the year. Way to go Annabelle. all the
[02:53] hard work is paying off and uh moving
[02:55] out to Cali was worth it and and Mimi's
[02:58] taking full advantage of that as well.
[03:00] We'll have more to share on her
[03:01] developments uh in coming weeks. But um
[03:03] this we got to spend some time in Disney
[03:05] which was a lot of fun. That's the girls
[03:08] with uh Caitlyn's dad, my father-in-law
[03:11] Steve. Uh that's the girls celebrating
[03:14] New Year's Eve last night at the club. I
[03:16] didn't make it to that one. I was kind
[03:18] of recovering from a couple off days
[03:20] after that uh surprise event. Uh here's
[03:23] some more at Disney
[03:26] and then uh couple here and then we'll
[03:28] get down to data and business. There's
[03:30] the girls at the aquarium in uh Long
[03:33] Beach this weekend. Uh jellyfish there.
[03:37] Pretty cool stuff. And then finally,
[03:40] Christmas Day with the doggies
[03:42] and a little walk in CDM, Christmas Eve
[03:46] at uh nothing more glorious than the uh
[03:51] view of scattered wrapping paper all
[03:55] over the floor as Andy Rooney used to
[03:57] say, "Treasure it." Uh and then on
[04:01] Friday, I had the privilege to join
[04:04] Varnian Co. want to thank Garrett
[04:06] Collins for having me on. and I was on
[04:07] with Ash Webster and we launched our
[04:10] newest healthc care position that
[04:11] everyone's been waiting for. So, we're
[04:13] going to listen in here. You're going to
[04:14] love this one
[04:16] >> for you. It's all been very quiet this
[04:18] morning. We're about 30 odd minutes into
[04:20] the session and all of the markets flat
[04:22] to just ever so slightly lower. Be
[04:25] interesting to see how the day pans out.
[04:27] John Thomas Hayes joins us now. Thomas,
[04:31] uh, you don't think any of the Mac 7
[04:34] stocks are going to double in 2026. Tell
[04:37] me what you think about it. Why?
[04:40] >> Well, Ash, I think 2026 is going to be
[04:42] the year of opportunity mixed with
[04:45] difficulty. Uh, our target price at
[04:48] Great Hill Capital is 7,300 for 2026,
[04:51] which is only up 6% from here. more
[04:54] volatility, some 10% corrections, but
[04:57] more opportunity under the surface than
[05:00] ever. So, we are not bearish. There will
[05:03] be more stocks up 50 to 100% next year.
[05:07] Uh they just won't be found in the
[05:08] current top 10 weights in the S&P 500. I
[05:12] would venture to say, Ash, there will
[05:14] not be even one magnificent seven stock
[05:17] that doubles in 2026. The real money is
[05:21] going to be made under the surface in
[05:23] cyclicals that benefit
[05:25] disproportionately from the easing
[05:27] cycle. More cuts, $40 billion a month in
[05:30] bond buying through April, fiscal
[05:32] stimulus from the uh tax refunds going
[05:34] up a,000 to 2,000 and possible dividend
[05:37] payments from the tariffs along with the
[05:39] warrior checks to our active military.
[05:42] So, we're going to see those ISM
[05:44] manufacturing surveys back in expansion
[05:46] over 50. But the cyclicals are going to
[05:49] benefit industrials, material, and
[05:51] energy over the Mag 7 and what's worked
[05:54] in the rear view mirror.
[05:57] >> All right, I want to get on to this
[05:58] stock. I don't know how you pronounce
[06:00] it. Is it Densly
[06:02] Serona? Densely Serona. The the stock
[06:05] ticker is X-Ray. Tell me about this. Why
[06:08] do you like it?
[06:09] >> Okay, this is a turnaround Tom special.
[06:13] This is a brand new position for Great
[06:16] Hill Capital in recent days. It's
[06:18] trading at seven times forward earnings.
[06:21] They've got $3.6 billion of revenues and
[06:24] they are the number one maker of dental
[06:26] supplies and technologies. They are
[06:28] around since 1899. So, they've been
[06:32] doing this for a while. It's a very
[06:34] cyclical business. Ash, and we are in
[06:37] the trough of the cycle. The stock is
[06:39] down 83% off its 2021 highs. They've got
[06:43] a 5.78%
[06:45] dividend, which is great, by the way.
[06:47] You can get paid while you wait. It's
[06:49] also great as a margin of safety of a
[06:51] turnaround story. If they cut the
[06:53] dividend, they've got an extra $120
[06:55] million of free cash flow if they need
[06:57] it. I don't think they'll have to cut
[06:59] the dividend. This stock, in our view,
[07:02] over the next three to five years could
[07:04] be a triple. They've got a brand new CEO
[07:06] in, Daniel Scavia. He was appointed in
[07:10] August in his last position at Globus
[07:12] Medical which was a public company. Uh
[07:15] the stock was a foragger over his 10year
[07:17] tenure. So we like this one.
[07:20] >> But I can hear that in your voice. Tom
[07:22] Hayes. Great stuff Tom. Great to see you
[07:25] and and merry Christmas to you. Uh
[07:28] coming up, Jasmine Crockett is
[07:32] >> so that one uh densely Cerrrona has
[07:35] become a very large position very very
[07:37] quickly and uh we're excited about that.
[07:40] We'll have more to say about it in
[07:41] coming weeks and want to go through some
[07:45] of these bullish percent charts so you
[07:46] can see sector by sector where we are
[07:49] this week and how we're headed into the
[07:52] new year. You can see um
[07:56] this basically is bullish percent. What
[07:59] what that is that's a point and figure
[08:00] thing. We don't use point and figure but
[08:02] it shows the amount of stocks that are
[08:06] in bullish positions based on this
[08:08] technical indicator. Uh communication
[08:10] services it's only 55% so we could see
[08:12] some follow-through that we didn't see
[08:14] in December in early January. Um NASDAQ
[08:18] composite is kind of towards the top
[08:20] end. uh consumer discretionary is
[08:23] towards the top end but not stretched.
[08:25] Energy is weak. We're going to talk a
[08:27] little bit about that. As a matter of
[08:28] fact, I want to just jump right to the
[08:30] energy chart here. This is crude oil.
[08:33] We've talked about the commitments of
[08:34] traders for many years. And um the
[08:37] commercial hedgers are often early and
[08:40] often correct. And what we see here in
[08:42] the green line below on the weekly chart
[08:44] is that they've been buying contracts
[08:46] like it's going out of style. And you
[08:48] can see those times where it gets to the
[08:50] extreme. You get at least a bounce and
[08:52] sometimes a trend reversal. Big upside
[08:55] in oil. This time past year was uh you
[08:59] know 10 bucks. Um here was a big trend
[09:03] reversal in uh 2020. That was a big tell
[09:07] for us. Uh this was in 2019 etc. And
[09:10] we're lined up for there. So, I do think
[09:14] you're going to see a little bit of um
[09:17] above trend inflation, something 3% in
[09:20] 2026.
[09:22] Uh and some of that's going to be oil
[09:24] now coming into the picture. I know
[09:26] that's counterintuitive, but uh the
[09:28] commercials tend to tell the whole
[09:30] story. Let's take a look on the monthly.
[09:32] You can see here again extreme that you
[09:35] see before big moves. So, uh energy is
[09:38] going up.
[09:40] Um,
[09:42] financials has moved here, bullish
[09:44] percent, so there's probably not a lot
[09:46] of juice in that right now. Gold miners
[09:48] has been extreme. Healthc care is kind
[09:51] of in the middle zone, 60.
[09:54] Uh, Dow has more room to run. The
[09:56] industrials,
[09:58] uh, industrials down only at 55%, that's
[10:00] probably got some juice here in the
[10:01] first quarter. InfoC, some of those are
[10:04] going to start to bounce back.
[10:06] Materials, same thing. So, you can see
[10:09] as expensive as the market feels,
[10:11] there's a lot of opportunity still to be
[10:14] had. And we're going to go into some of
[10:16] the data here. Real estate, that's going
[10:18] to be a function of rates, which is
[10:19] going to be a big deal in 2026.
[10:22] Um, we did get, by the way, very close.
[10:25] I thought we would see 599 on the
[10:27] 30-year fix before the end of the year.
[10:28] We got to 615. Not bad. Um,
[10:33] uh, here's S&P bullish percent at 60.
[10:36] So, we could have a little more follow
[10:37] through in the first quarter here.
[10:39] Staples just getting going, so we like
[10:41] that. Um,
[10:45] and utilities has been left for dead.
[10:47] There's nothing really in utilities that
[10:49] we love at the moment. Uh, then I want
[10:51] to look at the relative
[10:54] sector charts. This is uh US dollar to
[10:57] the S&P 500 relative performance. It's
[11:00] been weak. It's going to get weaker,
[11:01] ladies and gentlemen. Weaker dollar in
[11:03] 2026 will continue. we'll have some
[11:05] counter trend bounces. Uh, gold miners
[11:08] to S&P has been through the roof. I
[11:10] would say um it rarely gets to a ratio
[11:13] higher than this. So, if you've made
[11:15] some money in gold, count your
[11:16] blessings. I'm not telling, you know,
[11:18] this is all opinion, not advice, but I
[11:19] wouldn't be a buyer here. Um, biotech
[11:22] had a huge run in 2025. We took some
[11:24] profits there so we could get money for
[11:26] Densly Cerona.
[11:29] That'll probably work higher anyway. But
[11:32] um dense supply we think has higher IRRa
[11:34] potential over the next three years.
[11:36] Much higher. Uh US aerospace and defense
[11:40] relative to the S&P has had a big run.
[11:43] We love our Boeing. No changes there.
[11:46] Small caps just getting off the mat. We
[11:48] love this theme for 2026.
[11:51] Uh that is they benefit from the easing
[11:53] cycle. They benefit from lower rates and
[11:55] that game is just getting started. Real
[11:57] estate again down because of rates. That
[11:59] will change in 2026.
[12:03] And
[12:04] NASDAQ has been strong or QQQ has been
[12:07] strong. We think that's going to level
[12:09] off in 2026.
[12:11] And home builders, this is a rate play
[12:13] as well. We think that this double
[12:15] bottom should this relative double
[12:17] bottom should hold and we should start
[12:19] to see a recovery in housing uh
[12:22] homebuilders. But uh more importantly to
[12:24] us is the derivative plays like the QXO
[12:27] building supplies like Stanley Black &
[12:30] Decker like Generrack which will get
[12:32] more bang for the buck than buying the
[12:34] race to the bottom in margins in
[12:36] homebuilders. Uh this is materials
[12:39] relative to the S&P. We had a huge run
[12:42] on uh Albamaro in 2025. We think that
[12:45] trend is going to continue albeit at a
[12:48] slower pace. uh looking for some more
[12:50] exposure to materials.
[12:54] There's energy just waiting for the next
[12:56] move higher, consolidating the gains off
[12:58] the 2020 lows
[13:01] and ready for its next leg higher of a
[13:03] secular bull.
[13:05] Financials, nothing we love there. We
[13:07] like we still like it through PayPal. Um
[13:10] downside protected, upside really
[13:13] unlimited. We we love this story in
[13:14] 2026.
[13:17] Uh there's tech staples just getting off
[13:20] the mat. That's going to be a key theme.
[13:22] Defensives work in midterm election
[13:24] years. Uh this is going to be no
[13:27] different.
[13:32] Utilities down on the mat again. That's
[13:35] related to rates and healthcare started
[13:38] to rally the end of the year going to
[13:40] continue in 2026. consumer discretionary
[13:43] opportunity there. That started to work
[13:45] before the end of the year as we
[13:46] anticipated.
[13:48] Um, and that's that.
[13:53] So, what are the key themes for 2026?
[13:56] Number one,
[13:57] do not expect big returns in 2026 if
[14:01] you're sitting passively in indexes.
[14:04] Midterm years average since 1948
[14:07] uh NASDAQ is negative.5%
[14:11] S&P uh 4.6% Dow Jones 5.2%. Obviously
[14:17] this all depends on the year you start.
[14:19] If you start in 1950 that S&P goes
[14:21] lower. The point is they're not great
[14:23] numbers if you're just passive. However,
[14:26] do expect big returns in 2026 if you're
[14:30] focused on the right areas that benefit
[14:33] most from an easing cycle and weaker
[14:35] dollar. Fed easing cycle, we got cuts
[14:37] plus new QE. Uh they're actually now
[14:40] expected to buy $220 billion in T bills
[14:43] in 2026. That's QE, not light. That's
[14:46] real QE. Um cyclicals will benefit.
[14:49] Dividend payers will benefit. Companies
[14:51] with significant portion of their
[14:52] revenues will uh will benefit as the
[14:55] weaker dollar persists.
[14:58] In addition to easing federal tax
[15:00] refunds are expected to jump by up to
[15:03] 158 billion yearon-year which also
[15:05] favors cyclicals. Couple that you know
[15:08] GXO logistics 75% of revenues come from
[15:12] outside the US. That's a cyclical that
[15:14] will benefit from these conditions and
[15:16] national oil well Varco the energy
[15:18] services. Uh it's not only a cyclical
[15:21] dividend player, less sensitive to the
[15:23] price of oil, billion on the balance
[15:25] sheet, billion of free cash flow, 1.5
[15:27] billion of debt, best positioned in the
[15:30] group in our opinion. Warren Buffett,
[15:33] look at market fluctuations as your
[15:34] friend rather than your than your enemy.
[15:36] Profit from folly rather than
[15:38] participate in it.
[15:41] And then we have Seth Clarman. It turns
[15:43] out that value investing is something
[15:45] that's in your blood. There are people
[15:47] who just don't have the patience and
[15:49] discipline to do it and there are people
[15:51] who do. So, it leads me to think it's
[15:53] genetic. I think there's uh I think
[15:56] that's absolutely true. The older you
[15:57] get, the more you realize it and um
[15:59] that's that. Want to thank everyone who
[16:01] has been sharing the podcast which has
[16:04] made us top rated in the hedge fund
[16:06] category. Uh easiest way look many of
[16:09] you have made a lot of money off the
[16:10] ideas on the podcast and become clients.
[16:12] We're very grateful for that. Um
[16:16] and um some of you aren't at that level
[16:18] yet and you have reciprocated by sharing
[16:21] it with one or more people that you care
[16:24] about that love the markets that could
[16:25] benefit from this content. We thank you
[16:27] for that. Please continue to do that in
[16:29] 2026. One easy way to do it is get the
[16:32] merch, wear it, people will ask you
[16:34] about it. Uh and then we'll get you on
[16:36] the page with all these other awesome
[16:37] people in the hedge fund tips community.
[16:40] Let's get down to data. There are 37%
[16:43] more home sellers than buyers.
[16:46] So, uh this is to what we had talked
[16:50] about last year turning out to be a
[16:53] buyer market and that will continue. Uh
[16:57] it's going to be the opposite of what
[16:58] everyone's expecting. People think when
[17:00] rates go down that
[17:03] prices will go up. It's going to be the
[17:05] opposite. massive supply is going to hit
[17:07] the market and that's going to be a
[17:10] great thing for affordability. We look
[17:12] at ISM manufacturing services
[17:16] uh the PMI this as a result of the
[17:18] easing cycle we believe is going to
[17:20] accelerate back above 50 into expansion
[17:23] that is going to be an enormous boon for
[17:25] all of the cyclicals. Uh it's going to
[17:28] be a big big time for that. Wanted to
[17:31] just highlight Daniel Skavia's bio. Uh
[17:34] he's the CEO of
[17:38] Densly Cerona.
[17:41] He spent
[17:43] 10 years
[17:45] at
[17:47] Globus Medical where he was first the
[17:50] CFO, then the chief commercial officer,
[17:53] then the CEO. And during that 10-year
[17:56] period, uh Globus was a fourbagger
[17:59] stock. Prior to that, he was uh at J&J.
[18:03] He was at um
[18:07] several other major companies and now he
[18:10] is the new CEO which is one of the key
[18:12] components for our turnarounds with the
[18:14] catalyst and we really like what he's
[18:16] been saying on the first two calls. uh
[18:18] and um a friend who is a direct
[18:21] competitor uh gave me a tour of his
[18:23] factor factory and helped helped me
[18:25] understand the business and enabled us
[18:27] to uh have some confidence to make it a
[18:29] nicesized position pretty pretty quickly
[18:32] and um and we're excited about that one.
[18:34] So, more to come on that. Here's the
[18:37] current state of the mortgage market.
[18:38] 615 on the 30-year fixed, 540 on the 544
[18:43] on the 15-year fixed.
[18:47] This is PayPal total shares outstanding
[18:51] and PayPal buyback yield. You can see
[18:53] the shares outstanding have gone from
[18:56] 1.1 down to 940.
[18:59] Um
[19:01] and um
[19:05] the buyback yield is now about 10.5%
[19:11] per year. So every year your position in
[19:14] the company gets clo close, you know, 10
[19:17] and a half% larger without putting in
[19:20] new money and the business is turning at
[19:22] the same time. We love that story in
[19:25] 2026.
[19:27] Household income versus median home
[19:30] price.
[19:32] This is where we're going to see
[19:34] affordability drop back in 2026 as we've
[19:38] talked about.
[19:40] Let's get to some of the key here.
[19:42] Consumer staples positioning
[19:44] dramatically underweight. We love that
[19:46] theme in 2026.
[19:51] Here are year-end targets. We're at
[19:52] 7,300 on the S&P 500, which is only 6%
[19:56] from current levels. We think all the
[19:58] money is going to be made under the
[20:00] surface this year. Uh you got
[20:02] Oppenheimer at the most bullish at 8,100
[20:05] and you have Stiffel the most bearish at
[20:09] 7,000.
[20:11] Total housing inventory is now ticking
[20:13] up. That's going to be another
[20:14] contributing factor. Here's an important
[20:16] article from Financial Times. If the
[20:19] subsidy war drags on, Bernstein
[20:22] estimates Maitron's cash on his balance
[20:24] sheet will fall to uh R&B 74 billion
[20:28] next year, down from 110 billion in
[20:30] 2025. Alibaba's deeper pockets with 547
[20:35] billion R&B cash give it room to keep
[20:37] pressing its advantage next year.
[20:39] Maitan's share of the instant delivery
[20:41] market is forecast to fall from 73%
[20:44] in 2024 to 55% by 2027. While Alibaba's
[20:49] will rise from 21% share to 40% share
[20:51] over the same period according to
[20:53] research by Morning Star. Um Alibaba's
[20:56] renewed fight comes as it pushes to
[20:58] become China's leading everyday app for
[21:00] transactions across goods and services.
[21:01] Alibaba wants to weave together the
[21:03] entire consumer internet. What you buy,
[21:07] where you go, what you search for into a
[21:09] single integrated ecosystem. With that,
[21:12] it can cross-ell everything from takeout
[21:13] meals to travel bookings and fashion.
[21:18] Dinping is facing strong competition
[21:20] from Alibaba's mapping and navigation
[21:22] service AAP, China's fourth mostused app
[21:25] with 890 million active users. Uh so
[21:29] that's exciting stuff. They are being
[21:31] aggressive. I remember a few years ago I
[21:33] had a discussion with an analyst group
[21:35] that was uh had a you know was building
[21:37] a big position in Maitan. I said you
[21:39] need to buy Baba. They went with
[21:41] Machuan. Needless to say, they're out of
[21:43] Muan and uh Baba's up big time. Uh here
[21:47] is the hang sang
[21:50] index.
[21:52] You can see here this sideways
[21:55] consolidation
[21:56] and this reversion before a big move up.
[21:58] So we've got a lot more to to do in
[22:01] China through our Alibaba position in
[22:05] coming years.
[22:10] Nominal GDP has rebounded huge. That's
[22:12] positive for profit growth.
[22:15] M2 money supply is still above trend.
[22:20] This is the chart about the long-term
[22:22] midterm election year results for the
[22:25] indices.
[22:28] Healthcare, by the way, if you look at
[22:30] the NASDAQ at 0.5, healthcare is plus 9%
[22:34] in midterm election years.
[22:41] and
[22:44] higher market concentrations heightens
[22:46] risk. We agree we're avoiding those
[22:49] overly crowded areas of the market and
[22:51] that served us well in 2025. It's going
[22:53] to serve us even better in 2026.
[22:59] The R&B has strengthens against the
[23:01] dollar. We've been talking about that
[23:03] was a key component two years ago when
[23:05] we were pounding the table. Uh we've now
[23:07] seen that that's going to persist.
[23:20] Federal tax refunds expected to jump 44%
[23:25] in 2026. That's hugely stimulus for
[23:28] consumer discretionary like Papa John's,
[23:31] which we're going to cover. As a matter
[23:32] of fact, we have a special guest. Our
[23:34] analyst, Jeff Adams, is going to cover
[23:38] uh the analysis of this new position in
[23:40] just a few minutes. So, uh hang tight
[23:42] for that new edition. We're excited.
[23:44] Jeff has been learning through the
[23:46] podcast for four years. Uh been with us
[23:49] now for some time, full-time, uh um full
[23:54] tilt now. And we're just excited to uh
[23:58] uh to have him part of the team as we
[23:59] continue to grow. And he's doing a great
[24:02] job. So, uh, China internet giant shares
[24:05] longest
[24:08] log strongest year since 2007.
[24:11] Okay, so that was on not many people's
[24:13] bingo cards last year. Uh, except for
[24:16] those amazing viewers at Hedge Fund Tips
[24:18] with Tom Hayes. I think we're going to
[24:20] see more good things in 2026. On that
[24:23] front,
[24:28] Federal Reserve injected $16 billion of
[24:30] liquidity. That was December 30th. So,
[24:33] they are in the game again. Full tilt.
[24:35] It's good to see.
[24:41] And
[24:44] see, European stocks cap best year since
[24:47] 2021. That's the international theme
[24:49] we've been talking about. Dollar set for
[24:51] worst year since 2017. We were one of
[24:54] the few people calling that at the
[24:56] beginning of last year. Um, so you guys
[24:59] benefited from that. Here is the
[25:03] sixth years of presidential term
[25:06] seasonal pattern.
[25:13] I'm not sure how that's relevant. We'll
[25:14] keep that out. Um
[25:20] Oh, I see. They're trying to say it's
[25:23] Trump's sixth year without the gap.
[25:24] That's that's kind of a tenuous
[25:26] argument, but I do like this pattern for
[25:28] next year. A little bit of strength in
[25:30] the first quarter, weakness into the
[25:32] election and then strength in year end.
[25:34] Uh and a flattish type of year for the
[25:36] index indices.
[25:40] New home medium price is 3% lower than
[25:42] existing home price in August.
[26:02] Uh, not so magnificent. 2025 yearly
[26:04] returns for each MAG 7 stock in the S&P
[26:06] 500. We've been calling that for a
[26:08] while. Amazon was only up 5%. Apple,
[26:11] similar story. Microsoft,
[26:13] Meta, all underperform the indices.
[26:21] Volumes are a little frothy on the
[26:23] option side. Stay out of the crowded
[26:26] areas. Here
[26:46] are some key sayings from the master
[26:49] Warren Buffett. He who retired
[26:52] yesterday. Um, tremendous influence on
[26:55] my life. I wouldn't have this career if
[26:57] not for his generosity of sharing, which
[26:59] is part of the reason that we've done
[27:00] these podcasts. We're sharing in our own
[27:02] way. Not to uh say that we're providing
[27:05] the type of value that Warren Buffett
[27:07] could have, but we try to provide our
[27:09] best every single week. Um and um here's
[27:12] here are some of his quotes to my fellow
[27:14] shareholders. I will no longer be
[27:16] writing Berkshire's annual report or te
[27:18] talking endlessly at the annual meeting.
[27:20] As the British would say, I'm going
[27:22] quiet sort of. Greg Abel will become the
[27:24] boss at year end. He's a great manager,
[27:25] tireless worker, and honest
[27:27] communicator. We wish him an extended
[27:29] tenure. Greatness is defined by kindness
[27:32] and service, not wealth, fame, or power.
[27:35] Greatness does not come about through
[27:37] the accumulating great amounts of money,
[27:38] great amounts of publicity, or great
[27:40] power in government. When you help
[27:42] someone in any thousands of ways you
[27:43] help the world, kindness is costless,
[27:45] but also priceless. Whether you are
[27:47] religious or not, it's hard to beat the
[27:49] golden rule as a guide to behavior.
[27:50] That's from Warren Buffett. Mistakes are
[27:53] part of life. Perhaps one perhaps self-s
[27:56] serving observation. I'm I'm happy to
[27:57] say I feel better about the second half
[27:59] of my life than the first. My advice,
[28:01] don't beat yourself up over past
[28:02] mistakes. Learn at least a little from
[28:04] them and move on. It's never too late to
[28:06] improve. Get the right heroes and copy
[28:08] them. You can stop start with Tom
[28:10] Murphy. He was the best. Uh live a life
[28:13] that will make you proud of your
[28:15] obituary. Quote, "Remember Alfred Noble,
[28:17] later of Nobel Prize fame, who
[28:19] reportedly read his own obituary that
[28:21] was mistakenly printed when his brother
[28:23] died and a newspaper got mixed up? He
[28:25] was horrified at what he read and
[28:27] realized he should change his behavior."
[28:29] Don't count on a newsroom mixup. Decide
[28:31] what you would like your obituary to say
[28:33] and live the life to deserve it. And
[28:35] that's from the greatest Warren Buffett.
[28:39] Okay, moving on to some headlines.
[28:43] Hong Kong stocks log best year since
[28:45] 2017 as AI boom fuels tech rally. Xi
[28:50] declares China's economy set to hit 5%
[28:52] growth goal
[28:56] in 2026.
[28:58] Wait, 2025. Oh, I see. Okay. Uh what he
[29:02] called an extraordinary year.
[29:05] China unveils $51 billion in early
[29:08] spending to support economy.
[29:10] Beijing renews trade-in subsidy scheme
[29:13] amid domestic car markets gloomy
[29:14] outlook.
[29:17] Kind of cash for clunkers. Remember,
[29:19] Deep Seek China could have a new Nvidia
[29:21] threat. Again, they backtracked. They're
[29:24] now selling the two uh H200 chips as of
[29:28] December to China. That was a mistake
[29:30] made originally by the Biden
[29:32] administration and followed through with
[29:34] by the Trump administration. They've now
[29:36] backtracked on that. You took them from
[29:38] being dependent and giving us money to
[29:40] independent and taking money from us. Uh
[29:43] so they realized that was a mistake.
[29:44] Trump wants a weaker dollar. Some
[29:46] Chinese say he has a point. He is
[29:48] getting the weaker dollar. AI next leg
[29:50] is all about text pick and shovel
[29:52] stocks. I think you go past that. AI
[29:54] beneficiaries which we've covered many
[29:56] times on the podcast. Uh reason I'm
[29:58] bearish on tech stocks. This is from
[30:00] Jeffrey Pac over at Morning Star. You
[30:03] should check this out. Obviously, the
[30:05] concentration expected returns after the
[30:07] years that they've had. Um, and it's
[30:10] just not beneficial to chase what's
[30:13] crowded. Rarely do you outperform
[30:16] monetizers versus manufacturers, how the
[30:18] AI market could splinter in 2026. That's
[30:21] been a key theme. AI beneficiaries
[30:23] versus cost centers. Disney box office
[30:25] hit six billion for the first time since
[30:27] COVID thanks to Lilo and Stitch and
[30:29] Zootopia 2.
[30:32] Why Disney stock is the real winner from
[30:35] the Warner takeover battle.
[30:37] Fed [snorts] survey sees about $220
[30:40] billion dollars in bill buying over the
[30:42] next 12 months. That is full tilt QE.
[30:46] Mortgage rates end 2025 at yearly low
[30:48] signaling relief for 2026 buyers. That
[30:51] helps the housing theme. November
[30:53] pending home sales had fourth
[30:54] consecutive monthly rise. How hybrid
[30:58] models are helping keep automakers
[30:59] electrification plans afloat.
[31:03] Why oil stocks are worth a bet in 2026.
[31:06] That's from Jacob Sonenshine. We covered
[31:08] that. We continue to like our comtock
[31:10] resources and national oil wellvarco.
[31:14] Uh again, this is all opinion, not
[31:16] advice. Go to hedge fun.com, click on
[31:18] terms. Boeing stock is on a roll. Wyatt
[31:21] could gain 25% in the next year. We love
[31:23] the sound of that. Warren [snorts]
[31:25] Buffett stayed true to his ways in his
[31:28] final year as Bergkshire CEO. He spent
[31:31] the year issuing expensive deals,
[31:33] selling more stocks than he bought, and
[31:34] adding to the company's cash pile.
[31:36] [snorts]
[31:38] Chipotle and other restaurant stocks had
[31:40] an ugly 2025. How they can recover in
[31:43] 2026. That's why we have exposure
[31:45] through Papa John's. Investors warn of
[31:48] rotten private equity as funds strike
[31:50] circular deals. We've talked about that
[31:52] multiple times. It's a wild It's funny.
[31:54] All these headlines that are coming up,
[31:56] we've been talking about for months
[31:57] before they were news. Uh, it's in a
[32:00] wild year for markets. Investors did
[32:01] nothing who did nothing did just fine.
[32:05] And now you get to hear from Jeff Adams
[32:08] for the first time about one of our
[32:09] newest picks. We'll turn it over to
[32:11] Jeff.
[32:12] >> All right. Happy New Year everybody. I'm
[32:14] Jeff Adams, analyst at Great Hill
[32:16] Capital. And this week I'm going to be
[32:18] walking us through the article of the
[32:19] week, turnaround on the menu, stock
[32:21] market and sentiment results. And we're
[32:23] going to be covering one of our newest
[32:25] positions, Papa John's. So let's get
[32:27] right down to it. Uh Tom already went
[32:29] through the media this week. You can see
[32:32] here free cash flow starting to
[32:34] reacelerate and recover. Uh revenues are
[32:36] stabilizing on a per share basis. Sales,
[32:40] cash flow, earnings, dividend, all
[32:42] moving in the right direction. Uh
[32:44] getting close to a 5% dividend yield to
[32:46] wait.
[32:48] So, Papa John's is a new position that
[32:50] gives us a fresh slice of exposure to
[32:52] the restaurant space, a corner of the
[32:54] market that has been taken out behind
[32:56] the woodshed all year. You can see here
[32:59] consumer services, whether it's hotels,
[33:02] restaurants, or leisure, all beaten down
[33:04] to multi-year lows. Uh, looking at a
[33:07] performance chart of the restaurant
[33:08] index, uh, underperforming the S&P by 16
[33:12] percentage points.
[33:14] We first went public with our Papa
[33:16] John's thesis during an NYC TV
[33:18] appearance on December 3rd, 2025 at the
[33:21] 550 mark. Founded in 1984, Papa John's
[33:25] is a heavyweight in global quicks
[33:27] service pizza with 6,000 restaurants
[33:29] across 51 countries. It runs a highly
[33:32] asset light franchise-driven model, 91%
[33:35] franchisee operated with a North America
[33:38] concentrated footprint, roughly 60% of
[33:40] units where it commands leading share in
[33:42] 11 of its top 15 markets. Lucky for us,
[33:46] the company spent the past few years
[33:48] tripping over its own feet. The 2017
[33:50] founder controversy sparked a seuite
[33:53] revolving door with four CEOs in seven
[33:55] years and no real executional stability.
[33:58] Missteps piled up, most notably a
[34:01] marketing pivot that scrapped the local
[34:02] co-ops that built the brand in favor in
[34:05] favor of heavier national spend spending
[34:07] that failed to deliver. Just as the CEO
[34:10] behind the change jump ship for another
[34:12] job. At the same time, the menu
[34:15] ballooned with complexity that slowed
[34:17] operations and distracted from what made
[34:19] Papa John's great, making highquality
[34:22] pizza consistently. These self-inflicted
[34:24] wounds were compounded by rising input
[34:26] costs, a soft consumer backdrop, and
[34:29] aggressive QSR discounting, driving a
[34:32] 70% draw down from the late 2021 highs,
[34:34] and setting up what we view as an
[34:36] attractive turnaround, hiding in plain
[34:39] sight. Our confidence in the turnaround
[34:41] starts with the right jockey now riding
[34:43] the horse. New CEO Todd Pentagore is a
[34:45] proven winner in the restaurant space
[34:47] with more than 20 years of experience
[34:49] and QSR in his DNA. having grown up with
[34:52] a father who is a Wendy's franchisee.
[34:54] Most recently, he served as CEO of
[34:56] Wendy's from 2016 to 2024, where he led
[34:59] the turnaround by pushing digital,
[35:01] expanding internationally, and launching
[35:03] breakfast. Under his leadership, Wendy's
[35:06] overtook Burger King as the number two
[35:08] burger chain by sales and delivered the
[35:10] 12th straight year of same store sales
[35:13] growth, turning the stock into a
[35:15] three-bagger and earning high praise
[35:16] from Nelson Peltz for his tremendous
[35:19] contributions.
[35:22] Pentagore has been in the Papa John's
[35:23] kitchen for a little over a year now.
[35:25] And before he even figured out where the
[35:27] coffee machine was, he started running
[35:29] the exact same proven playbook. He laid
[35:32] out the strategy and early progress
[35:34] recently on a podcast re recapping his
[35:36] first year and the road ahead, which is
[35:39] well worth a listen. And you can check
[35:40] that podcast out here.
[35:43] Uh, the Papa John's turnaround isn't
[35:45] rocket science. It's back to the basics,
[35:47] blocking and tackling. Over the years,
[35:49] menu complexity layered far too many
[35:52] rhythm breakers that drove short-term
[35:53] sales, but failed to drive the repeat
[35:56] frequency that wins in QSR Pizza.
[35:59] Pentagore is simplifying the menu around
[36:00] core products, and it's already paying
[36:02] off with core pizza sales up 6% in Q2.
[36:06] consistency had also slipped. So
[36:08] something as simple as oven calibration,
[36:11] aka making sure every pizza comes out uh
[36:13] with the same quality and temperature
[36:15] kicked off in Q1 and is already
[36:17] improving quality and taste scores. When
[36:20] the product improves and execution gets
[36:22] simpler, volumes follow. Uh the digital
[36:26] pillar is just as important with nearly
[36:28] 80% of orders coming through digital
[36:30] platforms. Pop Johns should be leading,
[36:32] not lagging. To close the gap, Pentagore
[36:35] brought in Kevin Vasonei, an old Wendy's
[36:37] ally who previously served as Domino's
[36:40] CIO from 2012 to 2020. A stretch when
[36:43] the stock turned into more than a 12
[36:45] bagger as he built Domino's into one of
[36:47] the largest e-commerce engines in the
[36:50] world at the time, behind only Apple and
[36:52] Amazon in transactions. So, you can see
[36:55] here a nice headline. Uh Kevin Vasonei,
[36:58] the CIO who helped turn $16 billion
[37:01] Domino's Pizza into a digital success
[37:03] story, is leaving the company to join
[37:06] Wendy's, now Papa John's.
[37:09] Uh we're already beginning to see uh
[37:11] Vasone's fingerprints, a revamped app
[37:13] that cuts reorder time in half for
[37:15] favorite orders, which is 80% of volume.
[37:18] Uh full delivery tracking rolling out
[37:20] systemwide, which will be at 100% by Q1
[37:23] of 2026. and a loyalty overhaul for 40
[37:26] million accounts that shifted from a
[37:28] clunky $75 spend for $10 reward to an
[37:32] easier 15 for two structure driving
[37:34] frequency, repeat visits, and more than
[37:37] 50% higher conversion. These early moves
[37:40] are starting to deliver encouraging
[37:41] signs with international comp sales up
[37:43] 7% uh in Q3 and the allimportant North
[37:47] America comp sales beginning to
[37:48] stabilize and set for a recovery in 2026
[37:53] with product quality rebounding and comp
[37:55] stabilizing. Margins became become the
[37:58] next leg of the turnaround. management
[38:00] has identified at least 50 million in
[38:02] supply chain savings with 20 million
[38:04] hitting in 2026 plus another 25 million
[38:07] of GNA savings uh both fully phased by
[38:10] fiscal year 2028 and expected to deliver
[38:13] 100 basis points of four wall IBA margin
[38:16] expansion from the current 12% levels.
[38:19] They're also accelerating North America
[38:21] refranchising toward a mids singledigit
[38:23] company-owned target over the next two
[38:25] years. a capital light pivot aimed at
[38:28] profitable growth with an 85 restaurant
[38:30] deal already closed recently. Put
[38:33] accelerating comps and margin expansion
[38:34] together and we see a clear path to
[38:36] normalize earnings power north of $3 per
[38:39] share and a potential double over the
[38:41] next few years. And while we wait for
[38:44] the turnaround to play out, we collect
[38:46] close to a 5% dividend yield, the exact
[38:48] type of yield we expect to be in high
[38:50] demand as cash moves off the off the
[38:52] sidelines in the easing cycle. The
[38:54] dividend is backstopped by recovering
[38:56] free cash flow, roughly $60 million year
[38:59] to date, and a solid balance sheet with
[39:01] 3.4 times gross leverage, well below the
[39:04] 5.25 times covenants, and no major
[39:07] maturities until 2029 to 2030. You can
[39:10] see here dividend little over 5% and
[39:14] while yield is continues to be
[39:15] neglected.
[39:17] Not to mention, we expect a company like
[39:19] Papa John's to be a key beneficiary of a
[39:21] better consumer backdrop in 2026,
[39:24] something the market is giving zero
[39:26] credit for. There are plenty of arrows
[39:28] in the quiver to support that view.
[39:29] Whether it's the easing cycle with more
[39:31] rate cuts in QE, uh federal tax refunds
[39:34] up 44% year-over-year to 517 billion
[39:38] with households seeing up to one to
[39:40] $2,000 boosts. Or the cherry on top
[39:43] being the potential $2,000 tariff
[39:45] dividend checks. If those make it over
[39:47] the line, Papa John's will have a line
[39:50] out the door and ovens running overtime
[39:52] just to keep up. Despite all that
[39:54] discretionary firepower, consumer
[39:56] sentiment sits at rock bottom levels,
[39:58] worse than COVID and the GFC setting a
[40:01] bar as low as they come for upside
[40:03] surprises. And you can see here, federal
[40:05] tax refunds estimated up 44%
[40:08] year-over-year.
[40:10] Consumer sentiment washed out. Bottom
[40:13] line, this is a classic story of a
[40:15] strong brand that lost its way. Now led
[40:17] by a proven operator restoring the
[40:19] basics. The asset light model prints
[40:22] cash when run properly and the right
[40:24] pieces are finally in place. We're happy
[40:26] to own the turnaround, collect the
[40:28] dividend, and let the rest of the market
[40:30] rediscover Papa John's at much higher
[40:32] prices. Here's a more detailed look at
[40:35] the business and turnaround strategy
[40:36] from this year's investor day. You can
[40:39] check that out. all highlighted uh with
[40:42] the key points.
[40:44] We also broke down uh most recent
[40:46] earnings, Q3 earnings, highlighting all
[40:48] the key points. You can go through
[40:50] those.
[40:51] And on to the 10 key points. Number one,
[40:54] uh North America systemwide sales
[40:56] decreased 1.1% to 879.8 million with
[41:01] total comp sales down 2.7%.
[41:03] Management knowed the greatest order
[41:05] decline came from small ticket web
[41:07] customers and the majority of the comp
[41:09] pressure was driven by weakness in sides
[41:11] as soft consumer sentiment and a
[41:13] promotional QSR backdrop weighed on
[41:15] results. Core pizza sales were solid
[41:18] with units up 3% and pizzas per order up
[41:21] 4% although the negative mix shift left
[41:24] overall pizza sales roughly flat. Two,
[41:27] the international business continues its
[41:29] recovery with systemwide sales up 10.3%
[41:32] to 331.5 million and comp sales up 7.1%.
[41:37] Marking the fourth straight quarter of
[41:39] positive comps with sequential
[41:41] improvement each quarter. Management
[41:43] remains encouraged by what they see uh
[41:45] in Q4 and the long runway for expansion
[41:47] ahead. A key driver of recent growth has
[41:50] been the expanded croissant pizza
[41:52] offering into three additional markets
[41:55] generating significant media buzz and
[41:57] activation.
[41:58] Number three, management has identified
[42:01] at least 25 million of GNA savings
[42:03] through the ongoing review of the cost
[42:05] structure with at least half expected to
[42:07] be realized in 2026 and further
[42:09] efficiency opportunities likely ahead.
[42:12] These savings are in addition to the
[42:13] previously announced $50 million of
[42:15] supply chain savings uh driven by pro uh
[42:18] procurement vendor negotiations, freight
[42:21] and transportation improvements and
[42:23] reduced fixed cost leverage throughout
[42:25] the commissary network. Together,
[42:27] management expects these initiatives uh
[42:29] to be fully realized by fiscal year 2028
[42:32] and to deliver 100 basis points of
[42:34] restaurant level profitability
[42:35] improvement across both franchise and
[42:38] company-owned restaurants. Four, Papa
[42:40] John's is accelerating the
[42:42] reffranchising program over the next two
[42:44] years with the goal of reducing
[42:46] companyowned restaurants to a mid-s
[42:48] singledigit percentage uh of the North
[42:50] America system, which is expected to
[42:52] strengthen local markets and increase
[42:54] operational efficiency. Management noted
[42:56] they have already they already have a
[42:58] strong pipeline in place with existing
[43:00] buyers at attractive multiples and the
[43:02] sale of the ownership stake in the JV
[43:04] operating 85 restaurants closed in Q4.
[43:08] The transaction is expected to uh reduce
[43:10] consolidated revenues by 60 million but
[43:13] will have negligible negligible impact
[43:15] on net income. Number five, during Q3,
[43:18] Papa John's opened 45 restaurants
[43:20] systemwide, consisting of 18 openings
[43:22] North America and 27 in international
[43:25] markets, bringing the total restaurant
[43:27] count to just under 6,000. For the full
[43:30] year, management expects 85 to 95 gross
[43:33] new openings in North America and 180 to
[43:36] 200 gross new openings across
[43:38] international markets. Six management
[43:41] addressed the M&A speculation during
[43:42] earnings. There are previous reports of
[43:44] $64 per share takeout bid from Apollo
[43:47] known they remain focused on maximizing
[43:49] shareholder value and they are
[43:51] open-minded about the path to achieve
[43:53] it. At the time they stated the
[43:55] opportunity before the company to drive
[43:57] the greatest value creation is through
[43:59] the execution of the transformation
[44:01] strategy. We agree. We didn't get
[44:03] involved in the stock for 50% takeout
[44:05] and are pleased to see management
[44:07] staying focused on long-term value.
[44:09] Number seven, management continues to
[44:11] make progress on the digital front with
[44:13] the revamped loyalty program now
[44:15] accounting for nearly half of total
[44:17] sales and driving increased redemptions
[44:19] in higher order frequency. Total loyalty
[44:22] accounts have reached 40 million, up 1
[44:24] million sequentially, and the delivery
[44:26] tracking service is expected to be fully
[44:29] rolled out by Q1 of 2026 and is already
[44:32] live in about 60% of US restaurants.
[44:35] Number eight, net cash provided by
[44:37] operating activities increased to $106
[44:40] million year to date with free cash flow
[44:42] 59.2 million through Q3 compared to just
[44:45] 9 million in the same period last year.
[44:47] Uh the increasing cash flow has been
[44:50] driven by the timing of cash payments
[44:52] into the national marketing fund,
[44:54] favorable changes in working capital,
[44:56] lower cash taxes, and reduced spending
[44:59] related to the international
[45:00] transformation initiatives. Number nine,
[45:02] management revised the full year 2025
[45:05] outlook. Now expecting systemwide sales
[45:07] growth of up 1 to 2% down from the prior
[45:10] 2 to 5% range driven by a softer
[45:13] consumer backdrop and a more promotional
[45:15] QSR environment that is expected to
[45:17] persist into the start of 2026. North
[45:20] America comp sales are now expected to
[45:22] be down two to 2.5% versus the prior
[45:26] outlook of flat to up 2%. uh offsetting
[45:29] some of that weakness is international
[45:31] with comp sales guidance raised to up
[45:34] five to 6% from the prior up two to 4%.
[45:38] Number 10, uh the balance sheet remains
[45:40] in healthy place with total available
[45:42] liquidity of 52 million in cash and
[45:44] borrowings available on credit
[45:46] facilities and gross leverage of 3.4
[45:48] times well within the permissible limits
[45:50] of 5.25 times. And you can see here
[45:53] earnings earnings call highlights. We
[45:55] went through those uh highlighted,
[45:58] underlined with stars. You can check
[46:00] that out there.
[46:02] Now, on to the general market. Uh fear
[46:05] and greed index staying neutral at 49.
[46:08] Equity exposure flat week overweek at
[46:11] 100.7, a little stretched.
[46:14] And we are now open to smaller accounts
[46:17] of $1 million plus and will remain open
[46:19] through January 9th. Uh to see if you
[46:21] qualify and to take advantage of this
[46:23] opening, click here. larger accounts of
[46:25] five to10 million dollars plus can
[46:27] access bespoke service anytime here. Not
[46:30] a solicitation, opinion, not advice. Uh,
[46:33] that was a lot of fun going through
[46:34] that. I appreciate you listening and
[46:36] happy new year. Thank you.
[46:41] And we're back. Good job, Jeff. Uh,
[46:44] let's go to earnings. Top 30 weights of
[46:47] the real estate ETF. Uh, earnings power
[46:50] has been revised down by 81 basis
[46:53] points. utilities revised up by 75 basis
[46:58] points. Um, as far as the ask me
[47:02] anything questions, we are going to
[47:05] defer them to next week because we've
[47:08] got a couple good about nine good
[47:11] questions. We want to get back to them
[47:13] when people are back from vacation so
[47:15] everyone can hear them all at once. A
[47:16] lot about 2026 themes. Uh, so we're
[47:19] going to keep this one short. Our last
[47:20] few weeks have been, you know, two hours
[47:22] plus. uh get you off to your new year
[47:25] and then next year we'll catch up on the
[47:27] AMAs. For those of you who had sent them
[47:30] in, we'll cover yours next week. In the
[47:32] meantime, make it a great one. And by
[47:34] the way, we're going to be back, I
[47:35] believe, one day early earlier next week
[47:38] on Wednesday. So check us out. We'll see
[47:40] you then. In the meantime, happy new
[47:42] year everyone. Make it a great one and
[47:45] bye for now. [music]
