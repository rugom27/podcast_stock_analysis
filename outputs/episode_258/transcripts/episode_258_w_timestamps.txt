[241.879s] producer uh opening its shares on the
[244.64s] market to debut it&#39;s going to be IPO in
[246.84s] we haven&#39;t seen that stock open just yet
[249.2s] uh but perhaps in just a bit of time
[251.159s] after this opening bell join me now to
[253.12s] talk about what we see in the overall
[254.68s] Market is Thomas Hayes he&#39;s a chair and
[256.759s] managing member of great Hill Capital uh
[259.44s] Thomas always great to have you with me
[261.519s] and the Market&#39;s so in Focus today
[263.36s] especially after some of these stimulus
[265.199s] measures out of China overnight what can
[267.44s] you tell us this is enormous news this
[270.52s] is a regime change this is a game
[272.52s] changer the Chinese government finally
[275.56s] released the stimulus bazooka that
[278.4s] everyone has been waiting for and if you
[280.24s] look at it now it the green light is on
[282.6s] so you you&#39;ve got the US trading at 22
[284.8s] 23 times uh for good growth but in China
[288.68s] the growth is now going to be start
[290.16s] recovering and you&#39;re trading at 8 10
[291.8s] times for some of the biggest companies
[293.28s] in the in the world like Alibaba the
[295.44s] number one cloud provider in Asia like
[297.56s] 10 cent like so many so the market is
[299.919s] very excited because if growth comes
[301.479s] back in China which it will they said
[303.24s] we&#39;re going to do whatever it takes this
[305.8s] is a big deal that&#39;s going to be good
[307.52s] for all the developed markets as well
[309.84s] and certainly we see US Stocks opening
[311.88s] higher today still within those record
[313.8s] high territories the NASDAQ leading the
[316.12s] way the NASDAQ Composite that is tech
[318.12s] stocks and certainly solid economic data
[320.639s] what we saw overnight in China with
[322.639s] these stimulus measures do you foresee
[324.96s] an impact on US Stocks I do in the long
[328.639s] term okay so this stimulus you&#39;re going
[330.8s] to start to see growth come back in
[332.12s] China that&#39;s going to help us companies
[333.84s] if you recall companies like Nike have
[335.639s] been down because of China worries Este
[337.52s] La has been down because of China&#39;s
[339.0s] worries Starbucks has been down because
[340.759s] of China China worries so all these
[342.639s] companies are going to benefit as that
[343.88s] growth comes back they&#39;re issuing $286
[346.28s] billion of bonds for fiscal stimulus
[348.639s] everyone said well the monetary stimulus
[350.36s] is great we need fiscal we need fiscal
[352.12s] they said it&#39;s coming and and it will do
[354.56s] as much as it takes so all the
[356.6s] multinationals are going to be big
[357.96s] beneficiaries of this stimulus over
[359.639s] overnight we&#39;re pretty excited about it
[362.24s] well in terms of excitement we see
[364.44s] Executives from bkv this company set to
[366.68s] IPO today here at the New York Stock
[368.24s] Exchange signing the wall after that
[370.08s] celebratory opening bell Podium we&#39;ll be
[372.12s] speaking with those Executives including
[373.639s] the CEO momentarily I&#39;d love to get your
[376.479s] take uh Thomas as an investor with a
[379.24s] wide aperture as to what you make of the
[381.639s] natural gas space I love it as you know
[384.4s] Kristen for many years we&#39;ve talked I&#39;m
[386.319s] a contrarian I like to buy what&#39;s out of
[388.039s] favor what&#39;s high quality value out of
[389.88s] favor and I think natural gas right now
[391.319s] is an opportunity of a lifetime uh it&#39;s
[393.479s] trading in in in the doldrums no one
[396.039s] wants it and the demand for energy is
[397.759s] going up and it&#39;s the cleanest energy
[399.84s] that we have plentiful in plentiful
[401.96s] sources in the United States unlimited
[404.24s] amounts so companies like this going
[406.12s] public we own a company called Comstock
[408.96s] resources which Jerry Jones owns 71% of
[411.72s] the equity he&#39;s the owner of the Dallas
[413.08s] Cowboys so I think they&#39;re going to do
[414.68s] well I think comstock&#39;s going to do well
[416.599s] we&#39;ve got a little bit of range
[417.919s] resources that we&#39;ve owned for for
[419.599s] sometime that&#39;s up quite a bit so this
[421.68s] is the time to be buying China this is
[424.0s] the time to be buying natural gas and I
[426.24s] think their timing is perfect okay great
[428.639s] well I&#39;m sure the executive might want
[430.24s] to talk to you Thomas uh after this uh
[433.319s] Market open here a strong Market open
[435.36s] that we see at the stock exchange as we
[437.4s] look to round out the third quarter
[439.199s] September we see decent gains record
[442.08s] highs in V sentiment seems to be strong
[444.879s] heading into the fourth quarter we&#39;ll
[446.199s] have a new Factor like the election
[448.24s] what&#39;s the state of play right now for
[449.68s] us markets I think the FED with the
[452.0s] front-loaded rate cut last week cemented
[455.72s] what we&#39;ve been calling for a regime
[457.52s] change for many months so we&#39;re going to
[459.44s] have a shift you have to be selective
[460.919s] you can&#39;t just Chase those magnificent 7
[462.8s] anymore UNM magnificent 7 UNM
[465.199s] magnificent 493 is going to outperform
[467.319s] magnificent 7 why because their earnings
[469.639s] growth is accelerating while magnificent
[471.8s] 7 earnings growth is decelerating small
[474.599s] caps outperform large caps in the first
[476.479s] 12 months after a Fed cut by 11% so you
[479.12s] want to be small caps value outperforms
[481.479s] growth in the first 6 months after the
[483.159s] first fed cut so you want to have some
[484.919s] value exposure everyone&#39;s crowded into
[487.08s] defensives they&#39;ve been crowding into
[488.639s] Staples and utilities we think
[490.639s] discretionary is going to outperform so
[492.44s] the Nikes are going to come back the
[493.68s] lulus are going to come back the VF
[495.4s] Corps are going to come back and and
[497.36s] last but not least actually most
[499.199s] important Emerging Markets is going to
[502.12s] outperform developed markets that&#39;s in
[504.8s] part due to a weaker dollar the dollar
[506.56s] is going to Trend lower in coming months
[508.36s] and years that help helps Emerging
[510.12s] Markets the stimulus in China helps
[511.84s] Emerging Markets so all the places that
[513.8s] have been left for dead now it&#39;s
[515.44s] Christmas time it&#39;s opportunity to go
[517.2s] shopping so we&#39;re pretty excited okay
[519.32s] opportunity to go shopping I always like
[521.36s] that reference here Thomas uh so when it
[523.599s] comes to overall conditions obviously
[525.6s] that is key in the IPO Market hopefully
[528.04s] we&#39;ll see more of these International
[529.64s] companies going public here at the Stock
[531.44s] Exchange what else do our viewers need
[533.08s] to know especially as they Factor the
[535.08s] election into their equation yeah I
[537.36s] think this is a big thing cuz
[538.959s] historically since 1955 you tend to get
[541.16s] a lot of volatility in October ahead of
[543.32s] the election so US Stocks have run up a
[545.6s] little B little bit particularly the
[547.2s] Magnificent 7 which is such a heavy
[548.92s] weight so you have to be careful you
[550.519s] have to be selective if you&#39;re on margin
[552.32s] you might want to come off a margin
[553.6s] don&#39;t be too aggressive but we&#39;re
[555.56s] staying fully invested we&#39;ll RI out any
[557.88s] bumps and then I think after the
[559.6s] election once you get that certainty
[561.36s] doesn&#39;t really matter as much who&#39;s
[562.6s] elected as president so long as you have
[564.32s] gridlock not one party in the Senate
[567.16s] house and president as long as it&#39;s
[568.839s] mixed we&#39;re going to get a urine rally
[570.519s] after that so be a little careful uh the
[573.12s] option skew which is the cost to ensure
[576.24s] one and two standard deviation
[577.8s] Corrections just hit a 10 10year record
[580.399s] which doesn&#39;t mean you automatically get
[582.16s] a correction but it just means be be on
[584.519s] alert for a little bit of volatility in
[586.6s] October uh in case it shows up so off a
[589.12s] margin stay invested ride through the
[591.36s] bumps and I think uh by year end you&#39;re
[592.959s] going to be smiling smiling so wide you
[594.839s] could eat a banana sideways so uh Thomas
[597.8s] Hayes with great Hill Capital Thomas
[599.399s] thanks so much for joining great to get
[600.68s] your take this morning and let&#39;s take
[603.519s] a and we&#39;re back then straight to Yahoo
[607.92s] to be on with Brad Smith thanks to n
[611.6s] Saleem and Justin Oliver as well for
[614.279s] having me on more color on our current
[616.92s] Outlook to the markets and your
[618.72s] Investment Portfolio the S&amp;P 500 hitting
[621.399s] another intraday record high today after
[623.959s] a couple data points signal that the
[625.36s] economy is still on solid footing but
[627.36s] our next guest thinks that investors
[629.0s] might want to prepare for a little bit
[630.92s] of volatility ahead to discuss we&#39;ve got
[633.399s] Thomas Hayes who is the great Hill
[635.36s] Capital LLC chairman and managing member
[637.88s] here great to have you here in studio
[639.639s] with us Tom great to be with you so
[641.32s] let&#39;s discuss this I mean what type of
[643.8s] volatility profile should people still
[646.279s] be kind of keeping their portfolios
[649.48s] ready for to weather as well yeah Brad I
[652.079s] think we had a regime change got locked
[654.959s] in last week with the front-loaded 50
[656.68s] basis point cut and what that lies is
[659.8s] that the heaviest weights of the S&amp;P 500
[661.92s] the Magnificent 7 I think they&#39;re going
[663.48s] to be a little bit choppy U moving here
[665.519s] I think moving forward history suggests
[668.56s] that the
[670.04s] unmagnify will outperform the
[671.959s] Magnificent 7 that&#39;s because their
[674.0s] earnings growth is accelerating while
[676.079s] the Magnificent 7 is decelerating uh
[678.8s] history also suggests after the First
[680.48s] Rate cut small caps will outperform
[682.68s] large caps by over 11% in the first 12
[685.32s] months uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s a big deal
[687.639s] value outperforms growth in the for 6
[689.76s] months after the first cut and uh as you
[692.76s] probably noticed everyone has been
[694.68s] crowding into defensives ahead of the
[698.079s] FED cut so I think uh you&#39;re going to
[700.44s] see consumer discretionary start to
[702.72s] outperform Staples everyone&#39;s crowded
[704.44s] into Staples and utilities I think that
[706.0s] trade is up and finally this is the
[708.6s] topic dour today uh Emerging Markets
[712.079s] will start to outperform developed
[714.12s] markets after 10 years of not happening
[717.519s] uh the Chinese government overnight
[719.399s] launched the Bazooka everyone said oh
[721.839s] the monetary cuts are pretty good but we
[724.399s] need fiscal well they&#39;re issuing 286
[727.0s] billion dollar of bonds they&#39;re giving
[728.839s] out money things are happening and the
[730.92s] green light is on that&#39;s going to help
[733.639s] not only Emerging Markets it&#39;s going to
[735.04s] help multinationals like Nike that&#39;s
[736.76s] been down Lululemon that&#39;s been down
[738.44s] Starbucks that&#39;s been down on China F
[740.56s] yeah a huge uh stimulus effort that
[742.76s] they&#39;re putting forward here and having
[744.36s] more International uh impact here you
[746.72s] know it&#39;s it&#39;s been interesting to get
[748.24s] some perspectives on what quality looks
[751.199s] like what the characteristics of quality
[753.519s] investment and people who are trying to
[755.6s] put quality into their portfolio what
[757.639s] that looks like what are some of those
[759.519s] characteristics from your perspective as
[761.519s] well even as you think about the
[763.12s] defensive plays that people can make or
[764.92s] how you can make sure that your
[766.519s] portfolio is able to weather any type of
[768.48s] volatility right now yeah so the you
[772.199s] started with the kind of concerns about
[774.32s] a little bit of choppiness into October
[776.72s] what what made me a little bit on alert
[779.8s] is the fact that skew which is the cost
[783.199s] or the implied volatility the cost to
[785.079s] ensure one to two standard deviation
[787.6s] Corrections think about 10% plus
[789.48s] Corrections has actually Skyrocket
[791.68s] skyrocketed to a decade high that
[793.68s] doesn&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;re going to
[795.399s] have a correction right away it just
[797.56s] says it&#39;s time to be on alert on alert
[799.72s] because the smart money is taken out a
[801.199s] lot of insurance that differs from the
[803.6s] vix which measures the cost of the at
[806.399s] the money uh uh premium or insurance so
[809.8s] I think um if you&#39;re on margin you want
[812.8s] to be off margin we&#39;re fully invested
[814.279s] we&#39;re going to stay fully invested write
[815.92s] out any bumps in October uh after the
[818.48s] election clears provided it&#39;s a gridlock
[820.48s] outcome regardless of who becomes
[822.079s] president uh I think we get a year-end
[823.959s] rally so you don&#39;t want to be stopping
[825.88s] and starting I just think it&#39;s uh time
[828.0s] to be a little alert particularly if
[829.8s] you&#39;re a passive investor and you&#39;re
[831.48s] overweight the Magnificent 7 even if you
[833.6s] don&#39;t know it for it seems like months
[835.92s] now investors have had to hear about the
[838.36s] broadening win the Magnificent 7 and the
[841.48s] successes seen in the Magnificent 7 it
[844.04s] would brought out to broaden out to
[845.56s] other earnings growth or earnings growth
[847.839s] of other the other 493 companies as well
[850.72s] are we are we starting to see that and
[853.16s] and if so is it sustainable as we get
[855.959s] into the back half of this year and
[857.36s] earnings growth regardless of the
[859.44s] macroeconomic backdrop comes into Focus
[862.44s] we are seeing it because you&#39;re seeing
[863.8s] the equal weight index outperform the
[866.36s] cap weighted of late uh and this was an
[869.92s] inflection quarter where the UNM
[871.759s] magnificent 493 as you referenced
[874.04s] broadening uh just inflected and started
[876.519s] to accelerate earnings growth they had
[878.04s] negative earnings growth in the second
[879.48s] quarter so not only is it beginning it&#39;s
[881.839s] going to accelerate uh small cap
[883.959s] earnings growth 7% this year 37% next
[886.56s] year so the game is on it&#39;s exciting
[888.68s] it&#39;s a stock Pickers market and I&#39;ll
[890.6s] tell you the the voodoo of China there&#39;s
[893.24s] some high quality companies and to your
[894.8s] point how do you define quality is price
[897.36s] is what you pay value what you get so we
[899.279s] want to see a meaningful return on
[903.079s] invested Capital that means the debt and
[905.36s] Equity that the company&#39;s taken in what
[907.199s] kind of return are they getting when
[908.48s] they invest we like double digits low
[910.24s] double digits mid double digits so there
[912.04s] are companies over there and we like to
[913.639s] buy things that are out of favor as you
[915.12s] know we&#39;ve talked for many years uh so
[917.8s] uh in the US our best tech companies are
[919.8s] trading at 23 25 times in China their
[922.839s] best companies are trading at eight or
[924.44s] 10 times and they&#39;ve got a ton of cash
[926.16s] on their balance sheet and with this
[927.959s] stimulus their econom is going to re
[929.56s] accelerate and there&#39;s going to be huge
[931.16s] opportunities not just for us
[932.44s] multinationals that are trading down
[933.959s] because of China but for actually some
[935.6s] of the highest quality companies in
[937.519s] China that have been left for dead it&#39;s
[939.279s] really interesting Tom always a pleasure
[940.92s] to grab some of your insights thanks so
[942.24s] much for joining us in the studio here
[943.639s] thanks for having me Brad absolutely Tom
[945.079s] Hayes great Hill Capital chairman and
[947.36s] managing member and we&#39;re back and I
[951.079s] think among the most important 10 or 15
[954.0s] minutes of TV in
[955.959s] 2024 was David teer uh who also has
[960.6s] Alibaba as his number one position in
[963.519s] his
[964.44s] portfolio and uh he talked about
[967.12s] breaking his position limits because he
[969.199s] wanted to get even more if we get a
[972.12s] pullback and um and uh look what I could
[976.72s] you know let let me put it this way this
[979.839s] is this has definitely been a a great
[982.88s] few uh weeks for sure uh but I would
[987.24s] also say just as
[990.0s] those of you whove been with me know
[991.88s] that I was not despondent when it was at
[995.48s] $59 and we were buying it hand over fist
[998.519s] and
[999.72s] $65 uh and all of that uh I&#39;m not
[1003.199s] euphoric at $15 I think we&#39;re just
[1006.36s] getting started so we&#39;ll push higher
[1008.279s] we&#39;ll have a pullback to shake out all
[1009.839s] the hot money that doesn&#39;t believe in it
[1011.319s] and know what they own uh and then we&#39;ll
[1013.44s] push even higher and it&#39;ll be hated the
[1015.12s] whole way up but listen in to David teer
[1018.16s] this is you know obviously been greatly
[1020.639s] influenced by Warren Buffett and Charlie
[1022.68s] Munger and I&#39;d say the third person
[1024.6s] that&#39;s been very important in how I
[1026.28s] think and how I&#39;ve assembled my own
[1029.039s] framework and added my own inputs over
[1032.24s] the years has been David teer Legend you
[1036.079s] know it&#39;s funny I posted this on Twitter
[1039.039s] and all the responses were from people
[1040.919s] saying why would you trust them to pick
[1043.039s] stocks when he can&#39;t even pick a
[1044.36s] quarterback because he owns the
[1045.679s] Nashville Predators or one of the teams
[1048.4s] and uh
[1049.52s] you I I literally just have no response
[1051.32s] to that you know it&#39;s like uh so
[1055.12s] listening to the legend the master David
[1057.6s] terer here when we hear the said okay
[1060.679s] they go 50 they may go more we think oh
[1062.88s] mortgage rates in this country oh we
[1064.64s] think business uh loans in this country
[1066.72s] start or you know we think interests on
[1068.4s] the N you immediately thought China and
[1070.48s] and
[1071.32s] currency uh differences around the world
[1074.36s] so that was more important to you
[1076.08s] because the undervaluation is you you
[1078.24s] know listen you can look at your chart
[1079.64s] and look at a chart of Baba on your on
[1081.159s] your screen right there whatever stock
[1082.64s] you like in China they are even with the
[1085.2s] recent moves are like on a flatline low
[1087.6s] compared to where they have been in the
[1088.88s] past and you&#39;re sitting there with
[1090.28s] single multile um pees with double digit
[1094.88s] growth rates for the big stocks that
[1096.24s] trade over here that&#39;s kind of versus
[1098.84s] what you know the you your 20 plus on
[1100.64s] the S&amp;P right okay and then you have so
[1103.88s] the question was was China going to do
[1106.08s] the things that you want them to do okay
[1108.36s] are they going to do the easing measures
[1110.039s] they that you want them to do so yeah
[1112.88s] they came the other day and uh what&#39;s
[1114.52s] his name pan pan gong Chen and I
[1117.96s] apologize because I can&#39;t even speak
[1119.44s] English well you know he came out and he
[1121.88s] was like jovial it&#39;s like whoa jovial
[1125.679s] saying we&#39;re going to cut and we&#39;re
[1127.28s] going to and we&#39;ll give you more and he
[1129.08s] said we&#39;ll do more and more if needed
[1132.44s] now the Chinese to say we&#39;ll do more and
[1134.679s] more if needed they don&#39;t say that
[1137.4s] because it&#39;s not been healthy to say
[1139.08s] those sort of things in China but they
[1141.24s] said that the other night and I listened
[1142.84s] very carefully what government officials
[1144.48s] say so I took it that they did a lot
[1147.12s] they exceeded expectations and he
[1148.6s] promised to do more and more and more
[1151.36s] okay and that&#39;s very strange language
[1153.559s] especially for you know any Central
[1155.24s] Banker but especially over there so that
[1157.72s] was the first thing that happened and
[1159.88s] last night um you know they we heard
[1163.12s] that they were going to have some kind
[1164.0s] of meaning but they kind of blew away
[1166.4s] expectations on the physical stimulus
[1169.32s] you know that they were going to do now
[1170.84s] physical stimulus if you look at your
[1172.36s] charts if you like charts because you
[1173.6s] used to be a broker and that was a good
[1175.48s] way to do things fast um what can happen
[1178.52s] around the world when they do that
[1180.0s] that&#39;s what you have to ask yourself now
[1182.039s] so now you have the Fed so just a
[1183.6s] backdrop again the fed&#39;s easying you
[1185.039s] know you have a few more easings coming
[1187.84s] the Japanese they don&#39;t know what they
[1189.32s] want to do right now but it doesn&#39;t
[1190.96s] matter what people think they&#39;re going
[1192.08s] to be forced into things and I can talk
[1193.72s] about that in a second um the Europeans
[1196.88s] are lowering rates and now the Chinese
[1199.12s] are lowering rates okay and they&#39;re
[1200.88s] going to be they&#39;re aggressive in how
[1202.28s] they&#39;re going to do it and they they
[1203.559s] also believe this or not swap facilities
[1206.76s] to buy stocks want encouraging buyback
[1210.48s] of stocks encouraging BuyBacks right of
[1212.679s] stocks okay this is China all right this
[1215.96s] is stock BuyBacks not only encouraging
[1218.52s] it lending you money to do it and
[1222.0s] they&#39;re giving money like tal money
[1223.4s] where you can put money out and you have
[1225.159s] no losses if you want to do it you have
[1227.72s] you know how that thing works you have
[1228.96s] only the money you put up and you you
[1230.32s] can don&#39;t lose money that&#39;s a great deal
[1232.44s] for me I want to be over there and
[1233.559s] borrow for some of this stuff so what
[1235.64s] about the relationship between the
[1237.039s] United States and China how the Chinese
[1239.32s] government may or may not feel about
[1240.72s] American investors but maybe more
[1242.2s] importantly how the American government
[1243.72s] feels about us investors investing in
[1246.36s] China too what&#39;s the risk how do you I
[1248.28s] mean that would be a risk and that&#39;s why
[1250.559s] you have limits on how much you would
[1252.12s] invest however don&#39;t have the other
[1254.52s] thing I thought you were going to ask is
[1255.76s] about tariffs and stuff like that I do
[1258.28s] not care yeah this is internal stimulus
[1262.2s] in the physical stimulus they did last
[1263.84s] night they&#39;re going to encourage
[1264.799s] consumptions directly saying it so
[1267.48s] they&#39;re really doing all the things that
[1269.28s] people have asked them to do over these
[1271.12s] years so what will happen on World
[1273.2s] Markets so now you have you want to talk
[1275.36s] with the United States most of your
[1276.6s] viewers are here in the United States or
[1277.88s] Europe or Japan start you started on
[1280.039s] Japan okay so we can go we can go around
[1281.64s] the world obviously this is incredibly
[1283.84s] good for very undervalued Chinese
[1286.679s] equities okay in especially when the
[1288.88s] government&#39;s encouraging the BuyBacks
[1291.039s] BuyBacks BuyBacks and for you to take
[1293.0s] risk to buy stock take a loan out buy
[1295.039s] stock you can&#39;t lose money on your loan
[1297.24s] great deal for me I would you know if
[1298.919s] you want to be Chinese just s in a
[1300.32s] Chinese name no sorry um anyway sorry um
[1304.72s] so you have you know so United States so
[1306.52s] that&#39;s so you have this world and so I&#39;m
[1307.96s] trying to figure the United States so
[1309.12s] it&#39;s not really your first plot to to go
[1311.679s] to invest right now because you would
[1313.0s] say China first Asia second right Asia
[1316.0s] at large second okay Japan then Japan
[1319.559s] you know Korea those markets also
[1321.679s] actually a Asia and Europe and Europe
[1325.32s] before Japan and I&#39;ll tell and I will
[1327.2s] tell you why the problem with you know
[1329.84s] you have to be careful a little bit
[1331.279s] about Japan although I think it&#39;s still
[1332.76s] you want to be in the equity markets if
[1335.2s] you look what happens if China runs and
[1337.2s] they get the economy going and you get
[1338.6s] the animal spirits going what happens
[1340.88s] China chines throw a lot of money in
[1342.48s] their economy who&#39;s one of the biggest
[1344.559s] beneficiaries in their own economy is
[1346.76s] Japan and Japan if if they get if they
[1349.4s] start running faster they I don&#39;t care
[1352.039s] what this election is and they have
[1353.44s] they&#39;re worried about this candidate and
[1354.84s] that candidate some candidates want to
[1356.32s] might want to go to abenomics and I
[1358.36s] don&#39;t care they don&#39;t even understand it
[1360.6s] yet this just happened last night the
[1362.919s] market doesn&#39;t understand it yet what&#39;s
[1365.24s] going to happen Japan&#39;s going to run too
[1367.559s] fast if they really stimulate there and
[1369.52s] when Japan runs too fast they&#39;re going
[1371.919s] to have to raise rates and when they
[1373.88s] raise rates the Yen&#39;s going to
[1375.679s] appreciate if the Yen appreciates then
[1378.08s] you have to to be careful about the
[1379.32s] stock market not this the stock
[1380.96s] depending how it goes now the stock
[1382.32s] market in Yen terms used to still make
[1384.12s] money but how much does it move or not
[1386.2s] because of how it historically does
[1388.679s] right so you go you go around the world
[1390.52s] the
[1391.88s] US listen the problem with the
[1395.159s] US and then I can go European European
[1397.96s] the European index at 14 times multiple
[1400.2s] versus a 22 historically incredibly wide
[1403.6s] 22 here 21 22 whatever you want to say
[1406.4s] for next year so Europe yeah you look
[1408.679s] interesting we like last in Europe we&#39;re
[1411.24s] well Japan has the same sort of moldable
[1413.12s] right now and you can say we have much
[1414.559s] better stocks and much bigger tech
[1416.32s] stocks and that so the question here
[1418.64s] where you don&#39;t have necessarily a cheap
[1420.559s] market right it&#39;s not a cheap Market it
[1422.72s] probably is you know and I I I didn&#39;t
[1424.919s] listen to him I listen a little bit but
[1426.6s] what cooperman said yesterday but if you
[1428.08s] looked at it historically it&#39;s a little
[1429.72s] you know a little overvalued okay I
[1431.76s] would say that however I get concerned
[1434.279s] about one thing cuz I you know
[1436.039s] fortunately or unfortunately I was
[1438.159s] around around in the &#39;90s I was around
[1439.72s] in the &#39; 80s too but it was around the
[1441.24s] &#39;90s and um you know in that market
[1444.2s] where the where the fed you know um uh
[1447.919s] you know cut you know cut rates into y
[1450.32s] 2K you know in a good economy a
[1452.72s] relatively not a bad economy but a
[1454.4s] relatively okay economy you had that
[1456.84s] those those those you rich rich in rich
[1460.08s] in in before long-term credit rich in 97
[1464.039s] relatively Rich richer after long-term
[1466.32s] credit and you know bubble bubble in 99
[1469.52s] early 2000 so I don&#39;t love I&#39;m a value
[1474.08s] guy I don&#39;t love the US markets on a
[1476.279s] value standpoint but I sure as heck
[1478.559s] won&#39;t be short well because I would be
[1480.72s] nervous as heck about the the setup with
[1484.0s] Easy Money everywhere a relatively good
[1486.799s] economy you know and China just massive
[1489.72s] stimulus coming in so it makes me it
[1493.039s] would make me nervous not to be somewhat
[1495.2s] long the US now you know so that&#39;s
[1497.6s] that&#39;s how this set is you know so you
[1499.84s] have to be you can&#39;t be short the US you
[1502.32s] can&#39;t be short anything in Asia anything
[1504.919s] in Asia nothing and we&#39;re back and then
[1508.64s] on Friday I had a chance to go on with
[1511.72s] David Lynn on the David Lyn report and
[1514.12s] these videos always go viral I think got
[1516.48s] like 60 thou 65,000 views you&#39;re going
[1518.919s] to find out why it covers all of my
[1521.84s] thinking following the raid hike so
[1523.399s] we&#39;ll listen in here how should
[1525.2s] investors be positioned in a Fed easing
[1528.32s] cycle which sectors have tended to
[1530.76s] outperform in the past so what is coming
[1532.84s] up next Thomas hay is here to break down
[1534.919s] his Outlook he is a managing member of
[1536.64s] great Hill capital and the author of a
[1538.799s] great Finance um newsletter called hedge
[1541.48s] fund tips links down below uh you should
[1543.84s] check out Thomas was on the show a few
[1545.72s] months ago back in July and he told me
[1548.24s] if it&#39;s indeed true that 2% is a fantasy
[1551.0s] even for the US are you saying Thomas
[1553.88s] that the FED is likely to cut before the
[1556.48s] core PC gets down to 2% of I think it&#39;s
[1558.48s] at 2.6 now 100% I mean nothing in life
[1561.799s] is 100% I&#39;d say 99% I&#39;d say if you take
[1564.72s] that bet a thousand times 999 times
[1567.52s] you&#39;re G to be right maybe this will be
[1568.919s] the one in a thousand where you&#39;re wrong
[1570.559s] but I&#39;d take that bet over and over he
[1572.72s] got that call right so congratulations
[1574.399s] on another yet another great call that&#39;s
[1576.72s] been a you&#39;ve been on a great streak all
[1578.6s] year welcome back Tom thank you so much
[1580.52s] David uh grateful to be here so uh let&#39;s
[1583.12s] talk about um what happened this week so
[1585.44s] the Fed Cup by 50 basis points the
[1587.32s] market started rally ing uh the day
[1589.44s] after which was yesterday on Friday
[1591.24s] today on the 20th where stock markets
[1593.799s] are taking a bit of a breather from
[1595.2s] yesterday&#39;s rally I was looking at uh
[1597.72s] stats and uh let me just flip over to my
[1599.799s] screen here I was looking at the
[1600.88s] Historical performance of the S&amp;P 500 in
[1603.559s] the past Cycles when we had uh fed uh
[1606.399s] the FED cut by 50 basis points so here&#39;s
[1608.44s] the S&amp;P 500 I&#39;m going to Overlay this
[1610.279s] with the FED funds right here uh the FED
[1612.96s] cut in 2020 March 2020 uh by 50 basis
[1616.84s] points that was uh here
[1619.279s] and the S&amp;P immediately fell shortly
[1621.559s] after uh well that was because of the
[1623.399s] pandemic of course in 2008 it was
[1625.96s] similar issue actually effect cut uh
[1628.159s] right uh around uh uh here uh by 50
[1632.559s] basis points and then that was during
[1634.559s] the financial crisis right before the
[1636.72s] lean collapse and then in 2001 same
[1639.039s] story it was right at the cusp of the
[1641.2s] tech bubble bust at the time and so the
[1643.88s] question remains whether or not we are
[1645.52s] in a similar precarious situation which
[1648.2s] necessitates a 50 basis point cut
[1650.0s] because in each of these scenarios in
[1651.36s] the past we had a basically a big
[1653.84s] decline in a subsequent 6 months after a
[1656.32s] 50 basis point cut what&#39;s your outlook
[1658.6s] here yeah I think uh you could go back
[1661.76s] one more and take a look at
[1663.48s] 1995 yeah and then you could go back to
[1667.12s] 1982 so as you as you go back uh through
[1671.64s] history and particularly that double dip
[1674.559s] there um
[1678.76s] yeah recently for sure it&#39;s had a
[1681.6s] negative impact however if you look
[1684.159s] at March of
[1686.96s] 20120 uh the market bottomed on March
[1689.24s] 23rd and and I and I happen to know that
[1691.919s] because we got quoted in March 22 saying
[1694.2s] we were in the market starting to buy
[1695.679s] stocks uh and that was kind of put me on
[1698.2s] the map and put the podcast on the map
[1700.2s] and everything else that everyone said
[1701.919s] that saw that market watch because
[1703.24s] everyone thought the world was ending
[1704.48s] and we&#39;re like no you know let&#39;s take a
[1706.84s] look at some of these companies that are
[1707.88s] Market down and uh that cut uh you had
[1711.48s] one of the biggest rallies in the
[1712.559s] shortest amount of time from April
[1715.48s] through the end of the year now um 2008
[1719.559s] 2001 yes those were were bad situations
[1722.6s] and I think that also goes for if you
[1724.64s] look at the returns of the stock market
[1727.48s] following the first cut 50 or otherwise
[1729.84s] throughout history those cuts that where
[1734.519s] there was no recession in the first 12
[1736.44s] months versus when there was a recession
[1739.48s] in the first 12 months that the returns
[1741.76s] are completely different and and on
[1743.399s] balance no recession you&#39;re in the mid
[1746.08s] teens up on the SNP uh in the first 12
[1749.72s] months after the first cut and those
[1751.88s] where you had the recession skewed
[1753.64s] overall returns down because when you
[1756.44s] did have the recession the returns were
[1758.36s] abysmal despite the cut like like the
[1760.64s] two instances that you just pointed out
[1762.84s] I think given where we are GDP now at 3%
[1767.48s] uh G hasn&#39;t been a perfect indicator or
[1769.679s] predictor but it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a
[1771.519s] barometer let&#39;s put it that way uh and
[1774.64s] earnings growth expected to be about 15%
[1777.399s] next year it&#39;s very hard to get to a
[1781.24s] recession with that level of growth and
[1783.84s] considering you&#39;d need two consecutive
[1785.919s] quarters of negative GDP growth to
[1787.6s] define a recession and I think what
[1789.399s] continues to fake people off usually get
[1791.399s] a recession once every four years what&#39;s
[1794.0s] got everyone sideways and why none of
[1796.6s] their models and and forecasting is
[1798.88s] working is that we&#39;ve actually had two
[1803.24s] recessions in the last four years both
[1806.0s] in 2020 and in 2022 when you had two
[1810.559s] consecutive quarters of negative GDP
[1813.08s] which they didn&#39;t formally declare a
[1815.519s] recession because they some accounting
[1817.799s] for the labor market was uh Stronger at
[1820.039s] that point but it does it is that a
[1823.36s] negative technical recession so
[1825.24s] effectively if you pulled forward
[1828.24s] uh one recession that should have
[1830.44s] happened over an eight-year period I.E
[1832.44s] one every four years and we&#39;ve had two
[1834.44s] in four years the runway looks pretty
[1837.2s] good and the runway looks good
[1838.519s] particularly because the only thing that
[1839.919s] could have destroyed it was Powell
[1842.44s] screwing up which he was close to doing
[1846.12s] everyone kind of knows in retrospect uh
[1849.12s] some of us were prospectively saying but
[1850.84s] let&#39;s say in retrospect that he should
[1853.279s] have cut over the summer when the bank
[1855.88s] of Japan was hiking
[1858.159s] and uh uh you basically had a liquidity
[1862.32s] mismatch and and I was really looking
[1865.2s] out for today with the bank of Japan I
[1868.0s] thought that was very important that the
[1871.36s] FED cut 50 basis points because while
[1873.799s] the bank of Japan was expected to hold
[1876.519s] Pat which they ultimately did if they
[1878.919s] had gone 25 and the FED had only gone 25
[1881.76s] I think you would have seen close to a
[1883.44s] repeat of what we saw in early August
[1885.799s] when the Nik crashed 25% with 50 basis
[1889.24s] points from the FED if the bank of Japan
[1891.44s] had done 25 is what I was very curious
[1894.12s] to see how the market would absorb that
[1896.24s] the fact that they did
[1897.799s] zero uh and held Pat for the time being
[1901.679s] tells me that we kind of have some
[1905.24s] support here despite the seasonal
[1908.159s] Tendencies worst two weeks of September
[1911.36s] uh
[1912.12s] pre-election uh weakness is historically
[1914.679s] the case since
[1916.32s] 1955 uh that that may be overcome you
[1920.399s] know I I think and I&#39;ll talk about what
[1923.679s] how we&#39;ve been thinking about it this
[1925.399s] week but I think quite a few people are
[1927.919s] positioned for trouble before the
[1929.399s] election and given the fact that the
[1931.679s] market is designed to fool most of the
[1933.279s] people most of the time uh I&#39;m coming to
[1936.559s] the view that maybe it&#39;s less trouble
[1938.24s] than most people expect and the big
[1940.24s] surprise that would catch people a lot
[1942.12s] of people off off guard uh if you look
[1945.84s] at Option skew and other things where
[1948.279s] people are really expecting bad
[1950.32s] things uh would be if the market
[1952.36s] actually moves higher into the election
[1954.2s] which would go against all historical
[1956.12s] data and how people are positioned in
[1957.88s] their outlooks for the next six weeks
[1959.919s] before we continue with the interview I
[1961.44s] want to tell you about another way you
[1962.639s] can invest your Bitcoins and store them
[1964.72s] safely instead of using a traditional
[1966.799s] wallet or an exchange consider an IRA
[1969.84s] today sponsor itust capital is one such
[1972.44s] Ira that offers 35 crypto assets and the
[1975.0s] lowest trading fees in the crypto Ira
[1976.76s] space at 1% % only and being an IRA it
[1980.039s] also offers unique tax benefits if You&#39;

[2002.679s] are positioned for more trouble and I
[2005.0s] guess you mean more volatility up ahead
[2006.48s] before the election are you saying that
[2007.88s] have a net short position um in Futures
[2010.919s] right now yeah well here&#39;s how I would
[2014.36s] look at it so on Tuesday going in with
[2016.559s] the same
[2017.88s] framework that this would be odds are
[2021.48s] you know worst two weeks of the year or
[2023.399s] the last two weeks of September
[2024.88s] historically uh in a presidential
[2027.0s] election year you get a lot of
[2028.24s] volatility in September and a flush and
[2030.559s] a lot of volatility in September and a
[2032.919s] flush in late October before the
[2034.559s] election clears we started looking for
[2037.96s] okay number one could we Harvest some
[2040.159s] cash to be able to buy the weakness
[2041.96s] potential weakness in October and there
[2044.12s] was nothing in the portfolio that we
[2046.159s] felt was exuberantly valued where we
[2048.359s] would want to get out of the p position
[2050.079s] to raise cash all the cash that we were
[2052.2s] going to raise we did in July uh when
[2054.72s] some of the mag s were were just humming
[2056.679s] along uh and late June when when Nvidia
[2059.839s] was doing their split and everyone loved
[2061.52s] it at
[2062.639s] 139 um
[2066.04s] so so not only could we not find enough
[2069.679s] good ideas to harvest cash because we
[2071.399s] didn&#39;t want to sell them at at these
[2073.119s] levels we don&#39;t think they&#39;re near fair
[2074.72s] value or fully valued but we went
[2077.72s] through you know couple thousand stocks
[2080.76s] looking for ways to hedge the portfolio
[2082.679s] I.E put on shorts uh or index Hedges and
[2087.079s] the only fat pitch shorts that we were
[2089.839s] willing to put on that made that made
[2092.919s] sense from different things we were
[2094.879s] looking at in terms of fundamental
[2096.24s] analysis in terms of technical analysis
[2098.079s] they were all defensives meaning
[2101.16s] everyone has crowded into defensives
[2103.32s] Consumer Staples utilities ahead of the
[2107.2s] Fall so right now you&#39;re so overweight
[2110.119s] defensives relative to discretionary
[2112.599s] people are positioned for bad things so
[2114.52s] the last thing you want to do is short
[2117.68s] defensives into a potential turbulent
[2120.44s] period And the fact that so many people
[2122.119s] are already in defensives and positioned
[2124.48s] for a turbulent period tells me we may
[2126.68s] not get as much turbulence as people
[2129.32s] think so I&#39;m less looking at Futures
[2131.88s] commitment of traders that I would
[2133.64s] normally look at and that&#39;s a great
[2135.119s] go-to and it&#39;s and it&#39;s uh astute that
[2137.52s] you brought that up as the first thing
[2138.839s] to look at but uh vix is still a little
[2142.4s] bit elevated here which tells me hedging
[2144.56s] premium is
[2146.079s] expensive uh so you know sometimes the
[2150.68s] worst case scenario for people that are
[2152.52s] that are high conviction on either the
[2154.2s] thing going down or going up is that the
[2156.319s] market grinds sideways into to the
[2157.839s] election that would probably cause the
[2159.48s] most pain to the most amount of people
[2161.079s] uh actually uh since you brought up yeah
[2162.68s] let&#39;s talk about sectors now uh before
[2164.319s] we get on to the central bank diverges
[2166.24s] which you brought up earlier so this is
[2168.119s] the S&amp;P again in the bar chart the
[2169.8s] purple line is the xlp so Consumer
[2172.04s] Staples um ETF it&#39;s been underperforming
[2175.2s] all year still so um is that mostly just
[2177.56s] because of the tech out performance you
[2179.599s] think Tom well Tech waiting but but look
[2182.92s] at the look at the hockey sick
[2185.16s] move you know while from August through
[2189.44s] midt yeah and this this is what I&#39;m
[2192.44s] talking about when I say people are
[2194.4s] positioning so yeah over the last three
[2196.16s] months it&#39;s just been on a tear you&#39;re
[2197.48s] right let&#39;s so up this is last three
[2199.079s] months here yeah yeah Up&#39;s up go ahead
[2204.44s] yeah it&#39;s up six% S&amp;P it&#39;s only up three
[2206.44s] so yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s doubled the
[2209.0s] performance and that&#39;s kind of how I&#39;m
[2211.04s] thinking about and if you actually go
[2212.88s] back to to uh before the FED cut it was
[2216.44s] up eight in change
[2219.72s] right so just go back two days oh two
[2222.319s] days yeah yeah yeah you see that Peak on
[2224.24s] the red thing so it&#39;s up about um hang
[2228.319s] on let me go back oh I see what you&#39;re
[2229.4s] doing couple days here yeah right there
[2231.56s] right there yeah yeah so it&#39;s up another
[2234.839s] two so it&#39;s like up
[2237.119s] eight% so everyone was positioning for
[2240.64s] whatever what is all known which is the
[2243.28s] worst two months of the year on average
[2244.92s] is late September uh uh presidential
[2247.92s] election year since
[2249.56s] 1955 you know tend to be really really
[2252.52s] choppy and very big weakness into the
[2254.56s] end of October before the election
[2255.88s] clears and and the thing rallies so I
[2258.92s] didn&#39;t want to short defensives I didn&#39;t
[2261.8s] want to short Tech into the hole so
[2263.48s] basically we&#39;re just standing Pat fully
[2265.119s] invested low to no leverage and if we
[2267.92s] get weakness we&#39;ll find some cash to buy
[2270.2s] stuff uh and if the market Powers higher
[2272.839s] we&#39;ll take advantage which could be a
[2274.52s] real surprise if the market did push
[2276.88s] higher into election which I&#39;m not
[2278.4s] betting on but I&#39;m also no I&#39;m not also
[2281.16s] despite wanting to not betting against
[2285.0s] um that would probably surprise a lot of
[2287.56s] people and and there&#39;s a tendency the
[2288.96s] market to do that why did you bring up
[2290.76s] the election several times as a turning
[2292.4s] point I mean what fundamental difference
[2293.839s] would there be for the markets if let&#39;s
[2295.24s] say we had a Harris versus a trump win
[2297.56s] zero provided that we get a gridlock
[2301.079s] outcome so if Harris were to win it&#39;s
[2305.119s] probable that the Republicans the senate
[2308.56s] in which case none of the market bad
[2311.319s] things can happen I.E unreal taxing
[2313.8s] unrealized capital gains which is the
[2315.599s] most ridiculous thing ever if you want
[2318.0s] uh an economy to flourish I mean you
[2320.24s] would destroy all incentive for people
[2322.44s] to invest in businesses
[2325.8s] uh it&#39;s worrisome that someone would
[2329.8s] have advisors that would even Broach
[2331.88s] such an idea because it would be so
[2333.92s] devastating and they&#39;re saying well it&#39;s
[2335.24s] only for hundred million dollar people
[2336.8s] you just don&#39;t yeah I.E the people that
[2339.2s] create all the jobs would be
[2341.52s] disincentivized to grow companies
[2344.72s] because you can&#39;t keep reinvesting if
[2346.24s] you&#39;re taxed before you realize the gain
[2348.4s] it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mindboggling leaving that
[2351.079s] aside yeah and Trump&#39;s not full of good
[2353.599s] ideas either okay he&#39;s got a lot of good
[2355.88s] ideas as far as business friendly and uh
[2360.079s] I I&#39;m making no judgments about social
[2362.04s] friendlies or personalities or any of
[2364.2s] that um he&#39;s more business he&#39;s more
[2368.8s] anti-regulation so in theory the market
[2372.04s] should like that more I will tell you
[2374.64s] that if the repu Republicans won the
[2377.16s] presidency the Senate and the house
[2380.8s] that&#39;s not good historically for the
[2382.839s] stock market no matter what people think
[2385.96s] uh just as if the Democrats won the
[2388.52s] presidency the Senate and the house is
[2390.76s] not good for the stock market the best
[2393.52s] case scenario whether Trump or Harris
[2396.2s] wins is that the other party controls
[2398.8s] either the senate or the house or both
[2402.44s] and the name of the game is the market
[2405.0s] prefers if politicians can do very
[2407.599s] little the less politicians can do the
[2410.0s] Better Business will do the better
[2411.48s] markets will do over time I actually I
[2413.88s] spoke to somebody who uh is in the no on
[2416.2s] on the um unrealized capital gains uh
[2418.2s] proposal which uh by the way Congress
[2419.8s] has not approved or it probably un
[2421.56s] likely going to approve but uh but
[2424.92s] according to our calculations only about
[2426.68s] 10,000 individuals in the US would be
[2429.0s] affected uh entities like hedge funds
[2431.8s] like yourselves would would not we&#39;re
[2433.56s] not going to tax unrealized gains from
[2436.68s] uh llps and black rock or or any of that
[2439.16s] sort so perhaps it&#39;s not that big a deal
[2441.8s] even if it were to be implemented but
[2443.319s] that
[2444.28s] aside wait wait let me just let me let
[2446.92s] me stop there because it&#39;s such an
[2448.599s] important like I can&#39;t overemphasize how
[2451.48s] bad an idea this is like if I was going
[2453.4s] to write a book called How to cause a
[2456.119s] Great Depression chapter one would be
[2458.4s] entitled start taxing unrealized capital
[2461.48s] gains and you say it&#39;s only 10,000
[2463.68s] people how many public companies are
[2465.64s] there that matter 2,000 that matter
[2469.04s] 6,000 total so let&#39;s just say the ones
[2472.079s] that really matter to people&#39;s uh 401ks
[2475.8s] retirements pensions are 500 companies
[2478.64s] let&#39;s just be simplistic so those 10,000
[2481.92s] people control a material amount of
[2483.96s] those 500 companies and if they are
[2485.96s] forced liquid Liquidators with no ready
[2489.76s] buyers on the other side because who
[2491.48s] would be the ready buyers people who
[2493.079s] would also get hit by the unrealized TA
[2495.839s] capital gains and have no incentive to
[2498.48s] create that that market liquidity uh
[2501.28s] you&#39;re G to have hundreds of thousands
[2504.24s] to tens of millions of jobs destroyed
[2507.079s] because you you are old enough to have
[2509.52s] lived through what a
[2512.119s] liquidity uh dir of liquidity looks like
[2514.68s] in the great financial crisis that would
[2516.76s] be
[2517.76s] Amateur hour compared to what would
[2519.319s] happen if this was ever implemented well
[2520.8s] let me just ask you suppose it were to
[2522.56s] affect your fund suppose legislation
[2525.16s] were to be hypothetically uh implemented
[2528.68s] such that your fund would be taxed on an
[2530.56s] unrealized capital gains basis would you
[2532.119s] move
[2534.359s] offshore would you would you would you
[2536.56s] just leave the
[2538.24s] US uh I&#39;d probably retire and go play
[2540.92s] golf okay all
[2544.839s] right okay that settles that yeah um
[2548.839s] this aside though so taking the
[2551.24s] unrealized capital gains uh discussion
[2553.44s] aside Harris wants to raise top capital
[2555.52s] gains tax to
[2557.2s] 28% um what okay that look that I can
[2560.24s] live with we&#39;ve been to that movie
[2561.72s] before we&#39;ve been as high as 35% in the
[2564.44s] short term it would be bad for earnings
[2566.119s] so the market would would uh what was
[2569.119s] the word that Powell used the other day
[2571.44s] realign or re re uh what was the magic
[2575.079s] word he used realign or readjust to
[2577.4s] reconfigure anyway we could deal with
[2579.28s] that we&#39;ve dealt with 35% capital gains
[2581.319s] not no bueno but not a a life Ender it
[2585.96s] would not destroy the economy taxing
[2588.88s] unrealized capital gains would
[2590.119s] unequivocally do that even if it was
[2592.04s] limited to 10,000 people that control
[2595.4s] 80% of the
[2596.88s] stock okay so Capital higher cap higher
[2600.079s] higher corporate taxes is okay even
[2601.96s] though we may see lower margins and uh
[2604.559s] maybe slower spending capex yeah B idea
[2607.76s] but but tolerable all right uh on the
[2610.359s] Trump side I remember in well throughout
[2613.359s] 2016 to 2020 every time he announced new
[2616.8s] tariffs the markets just threw a hissy
[2618.76s] fit so I&#39;m guessing Capital markets
[2621.0s] don&#39;t like tariffs um have things
[2622.68s] changed now that we&#39;re more adjusted
[2624.88s] we&#39;ve had eight years of tariffs
[2626.52s] basically and sanctions another less
[2630.24s] than ideal solution for a complex
[2633.04s] problem so let me be fair and uh
[2636.44s] criticize both sides I guess is the
[2639.16s] answer uh and by the way both sides have
[2642.04s] some ideas that are sensible and I don&#39;t
[2644.68s] want to make this a political talk we&#39;re
[2646.48s] trying to keep it to markets tariffs
[2649.599s] Trump has historic Trump is a pragmatist
[2652.44s] by Nature okay so he&#39;s not an idealist
[2654.92s] and and and the ideologues are the most
[2657.52s] dangerous type of politicians because
[2659.92s] they&#39;re making decisions on the basis of
[2662.4s] a a Zeal and a philosophy and a
[2665.079s] framework uh that may or may not be
[2667.559s] Trump is kind of a dealmaker he&#39;ll put
[2669.64s] out these huge ideas and say we&#39;re going
[2671.48s] to tax everyone 100% And then when it
[2673.839s] comes down to it uh he kind of plays the
[2676.8s] crazy card to get people to the table
[2678.72s] and then he cuts a deal that he thinks
[2680.28s] is in the interest of the US people and
[2681.96s] creating jobs and putting America First
[2684.28s] etc etc is he is he perfect no is it a
[2687.88s] is it a practical way for a New York
[2691.079s] City real estate developer to go about
[2693.68s] implementing policy yeah that&#39;s the
[2695.559s] framework that he used used to build his
[2697.92s] business over time and it worked uh uh
[2700.839s] on balance for him over over many years
[2703.2s] and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s an okay way the
[2705.559s] market uh is used to taking people at
[2708.079s] their word So when you say we&#39;re going
[2710.2s] to put 100% tariffs it&#39;s like wow that
[2712.68s] would really be a bad idea too uh almost
[2715.4s] as bad as unrealized capital gains uh so
[2718.8s] it does get worried but I think after
[2720.359s] dealing for four years with Trump and
[2722.96s] knowing he puts out these Grand claims
[2725.52s] and then he tries to get to a practice
[2726.96s] iCal solution and more often than not
[2729.4s] does uh I think they would take it with
[2731.8s] a grain of salt and let him work his
[2733.599s] process are you looking forward to just
[2735.4s] the market stabilizing uh if not
[2737.599s] rallying shortly after the election just
[2739.76s] on the back of certainty for what we
[2742.96s] know basically we know who&#39;s going to be
[2745.28s] president now we know what the uh you
[2747.16s] know Administration is going to look
[2748.4s] like some certainty is good yeah I think
[2751.48s] unequivocally if we get gridlock and we
[2755.16s] have mixed government no not one party
[2757.76s] controlling all three branches uh we get
[2760.559s] that that rally uh as far as the indices
[2765.839s] though when you have inflation in this
[2769.96s] four to five percent range uh excuse me
[2773.48s] uh when you have uh uh rates in in this
[2779.559s] range 45% Etc if you look at multiples
[2783.839s] over time we&#39;re kind of in The Sweet
[2786.119s] Spot currently where multiples have
[2789.359s] actually averaged 22 23 times as as the
[2794.44s] um as rates go much lower which implies
[2798.24s] growth may be slowing demand for Capital
[2800.359s] may be slowing the multiple contracts or
[2803.28s] as rates go much higher which implies
[2805.599s] there&#39;s inflation and that type of thing
[2807.4s] multiples contract like the 70s you had
[2809.48s] singled digigit multiples because you
[2811.0s] had high rates which was fighting High
[2813.359s] inflation um but we&#39;re in the sweet spot
[2815.88s] where the market can actually actually
[2818.319s] sustain uh 21 to 23 times multiple but
[2821.76s] we&#39;re kind of knocking up against that
[2823.559s] so to your question does the market
[2826.24s] rally after the election I think a lot
[2828.96s] of companies rally after the election
[2831.2s] but it may not be those seven that are
[2833.64s] the most heavily weighted within the
[2835.599s] index they they&#39;ll do fine but I think
[2838.4s] that Trend that started in July that
[2840.319s] we&#39;ve talked about on on our past visits
[2843.119s] together persist and and all that means
[2846.359s] is
[2847.599s] margins are Contracting because of the
[2849.079s] spend for the mag 7 on AI and servers
[2852.0s] and all that stuff their earnings growth
[2854.16s] has dropped from 50% down to the High
[2856.079s] Teens whereas the other unmagnify that
[2859.88s] had negative earnings growth uh not only
[2862.319s] turned positive earnings growth in the
[2863.88s] most recent quarter but that accelerates
[2866.16s] up to Mid teens over the coming quarters
[2868.76s] so a lot of companies that are still
[2871.0s] down and out are going to be doubles and
[2872.96s] triples even if the indices have subdued
[2877.8s] returns that don&#39;t look like the
[2879.52s] rearview mirror of double digits maybe
[2881.68s] they look like high single digits but
[2884.28s] monstrous amounts of money could be made
[2885.839s] in small caps monstrous amount of money
[2888.52s] uh could be made in value which out
[2890.28s] outperforms growth in the first six
[2891.8s] months small caps outperforms large cap
[2894.16s] by 11% in the first 12 months after the
[2896.559s] first cut um and um the 50 basis point
[2900.96s] cut really will help a lot of small cap
[2903.0s] companies refinance and raise capital
[2905.24s] and uh continue to to grow earnings so I
[2908.119s] think that is a long answer to a short
[2911.16s] question it&#39;s nuanced indices upsh
[2915.16s] nicely but not bigly I
[2919.0s] guess dovetailing off our our last
[2921.48s] segment sure sure and um uh under the
[2925.359s] surface opportunities like we haven&#39;t
[2927.44s] seen since 2002 to 2007 Emerging Markets
[2931.0s] rally is going to be huge right huge but
[2934.839s] but seen only under the surface if
[2937.359s] you&#39;re just sitting in passive index
[2939.92s] funds you&#39;re going to be like okay it&#39;s
[2941.52s] okay things are going uppish uh but it&#39;s
[2944.2s] not going to be boom but if you saying
[2947.72s] look this is what performs best after
[2950.4s] the first cut I want I want some small
[2952.599s] cap exposure I want some Emerging Market
[2955.0s] exposure I want some value exposure
[2957.92s] those things that haven&#39;t worked for the
[2959.319s] last decade if you&#39;re in those you&#39;re
[2961.319s] going to be smiling so wide you could
[2962.559s] eat a banana sideways okay so to sum up
[2965.119s] you you you like uh small cat for now
[2967.76s] not so sure about Consumer Staples which
[2969.52s] we talked about earlier any speaking of
[2972.04s] consumer staples if you look at the Bank
[2974.079s] of America fund manager survey okay this
[2977.559s] week the exposure
[2981.68s] to Staples relative to
[2985.04s] discretionary is so stretched right now
[2988.96s] so I think and you saw it last night
[2992.04s] with the change of the CEO of Nike for
[2994.04s] instance Nike is an example of those
[2995.88s] discretionary stock that are left for
[2997.599s] dead Starbucks in a lesser extent Left
[3000.76s] for Dead starting to get change uh
[3003.76s] Lululemon we don&#39;t own any of those
[3005.799s] three which is why I&#39;m telling you about
[3006.92s] those three Lululemon some of these
[3008.559s] companies that have been been smashed
[3010.319s] because everyone&#39;s convinced this the
[3011.88s] consumer&#39;s dead um the consumer is not
[3014.76s] dead we&#39;ve seen retail sales and now
[3016.559s] they&#39;re over time the interest rate
[3018.96s] environment is become G to become more
[3021.359s] favorable I also think we&#39;re going to
[3023.119s] start to see in the next 12 months uh
[3025.76s] there is so much tapped home equity
[3028.04s] again I think we could see the HELOC
[3029.92s] game turning back on the
[3032.599s] consumer uh Leverage is at historic lows
[3036.359s] it just collapsed off the pre great
[3038.839s] financial crisis highs there is so much
[3041.559s] room for credit expansion and I think
[3043.96s] that&#39;s going to drive a multi-year
[3045.88s] expansion at least into the next decade
[3048.44s] that that means what for investors we
[3050.68s] should be basically more cyclical in our
[3053.48s] in our positioning we yeah that that&#39;s
[3056.68s] that is the framework that we&#39;re looking
[3058.16s] at and I think a decent an analog would
[3061.0s] be 2002 to 2007 where Tech started to
[3064.359s] underperform I don&#39;t think Tech crashes
[3067.04s] like it did back then I think it just
[3068.72s] underperforms relative to those groups
[3071.559s] that have performed less well so I like
[3073.0s] cyclicals I like discretionary I like
[3075.44s] small caps I like Emerging Markets I
[3077.92s] like value over growth in the near term
[3081.16s] um and there&#39;s so many Quality Companies
[3084.0s] available that are marked down 50 plus%
[3087.2s] that are going to be doubles over the
[3088.52s] next three years but how do you feel
[3090.24s] about bonds uh in the last segment of
[3092.559s] our conversation by the way I&#39;m looking
[3094.319s] over at uh let&#39;s flip over to my screen
[3096.119s] one more time uh this is the CME fed
[3098.88s] watch tool and all the way to June 20
[3102.599s] July 2025 the Market&#39;s pricing in a
[3105.68s] significant probability of um the FED
[3108.64s] funds rate hovering anywhere between 275
[3111.16s] to 350 which is you know considerably
[3113.599s] lower than what it is today uh first of
[3115.48s] all what do you feel about this
[3117.0s] projection um or expectation and how is
[3119.599s] it going to affect the bond
[3122.119s] market this is one that I think about a
[3124.92s] lot David and I I think
[3128.88s] that those expecting the FED funds rate
[3131.96s] to get to three quickly are going to be
[3135.48s] disappointed I&#39;m glad they did the front
[3137.839s] load because they were behind the curve
[3139.799s] I think they&#39;re 2 200 Bas they were 200
[3142.0s] basis points too restrictive and I also
[3144.88s] think that the inflation numbers are
[3148.04s] going to be bumpy for the I mean we you
[3151.4s] know we&#39;re we are creatures of recency
[3154.04s] bias I mean I haven&#39;t looked at crew
[3157.079s] today but whatever it is hovering around
[3158.76s] 70 I I think that&#39;s a temporary not a
[3161.28s] permanent issue I mean you could wake up
[3163.64s] tomorrow and the Chinese government
[3166.04s] could announce a massive stimulus
[3167.799s] because they&#39;re behind the ball on their
[3169.319s] 5% Target and all of a sudden crude goes
[3172.079s] to you know goes up 10% in two days
[3174.96s] because people start to expect
[3177.359s] greater demand and um and then all of a
[3181.16s] sudden that energy in the input cost of
[3184.119s] all of the materials starts to go up and
[3186.44s] people start to say oh maybe we&#39;re not
[3188.079s] going to 2.2% maybe we&#39;re going to 3.4%
[3192.04s] inflation and the fed&#39;s not going to
[3193.72s] start to rehke per se but they&#39;re going
[3196.2s] to slow it down so I
[3199.0s] think unless the labor market gets
[3201.88s] weaker in the next two prints I think
[3204.079s] we&#39;re going to move to a regime of 20
[3206.68s] five basis point uh cuts from this point
[3209.839s] forward and they&#39;re going to be spaced
[3211.88s] out and it wouldn&#39;t shock me if the
[3215.16s] terminal rate is higher than 3% maybe
[3218.44s] it&#39;s three and a half maybe I I wouldn&#39;t
[3221.4s] say four but I would say high threes and
[3224.4s] that&#39;s not bad news that&#39;s good news
[3227.16s] because it means soft Landing was
[3229.119s] achieved and the labor market didn&#39;t
[3231.839s] blow up and we got the midcycle adjust
[3236.799s] M correct and and we&#39;re reaccelerating
[3241.28s] so that&#39;s where what we&#39;re thinking
[3244.28s] about right now that also supports all
[3246.119s] of the groups that I&#39;ve talked to to you
[3248.24s] about that we&#39;re interested in and
[3249.839s] invested in uh
[3252.64s] so just as you know you&#39;ve seen the FED
[3256.599s] fund future go from expecting seven cuts
[3258.92s] when we got none to now you know to then
[3261.44s] expecting none and we got a 50 basis
[3263.319s] point and and then now expecting this
[3267.2s] I think it goes in extremes I think the
[3268.92s] cuts will continue but I think they&#39;ll
[3270.599s] be slower and smaller than the market
[3272.319s] thinks right now and that&#39;s that is a
[3274.599s] positive thing for the economy and the
[3276.04s] market I&#39;m going to flip over to the T
[3278.24s] year now um and I want to just take a
[3280.52s] look at how it&#39;s been behaving this is
[3282.44s] the 10year and let&#39;s just chart it over
[3285.16s] inflation so um if you take I think you
[3288.44s] know where I&#39;m going with this over the
[3289.92s] last what happened here okay so over the
[3292.64s] last basically 40 years there&#39;s been uh
[3295.92s] a Rel relationship I don&#39;t want to call
[3297.28s] it a very close correlationship
[3298.72s] correlation but a relationship between
[3300.359s] the 10-year and the inflation rate um
[3304.04s] given your outlook on the macro you just
[3305.799s] talked about the labor market and
[3307.079s] inflation stabilizing around uh 2.5%
[3310.16s] right now uh what do you think is going
[3312.24s] to happen to the Tang year and
[3313.24s] ultimately
[3314.559s] bonds okay so we had
[3318.079s] been massive Bond
[3321.64s] Bulls uh from
[3324.839s] uh from
[3326.839s] for some time and we&#39;ve gotten a rally
[3328.92s] and I think now we&#39;re going to get a
[3330.359s] counter Trend move I.E our our framework
[3334.16s] had been bonds up yields down that&#39;s
[3337.4s] worked and that was a very unpopular
[3339.599s] view just a year ago uh and that&#39;s been
[3342.599s] correct now that everyone is starting to
[3345.16s] say buy
[3346.4s] bonds uh I think we&#39;re going to get a
[3348.799s] counter Trend move I think yields are
[3350.119s] going to go up in the short term not
[3353.039s] crazily we&#39;re not going back to five or
[3354.96s] anything like that on the 10-year but I
[3358.319s] think a for handle it wouldn&#39;t Shock Me
[3361.24s] In coming months uh before we resume the
[3365.0s] the the downtrend in yields for some
[3367.319s] time so by the way do you expect
[3369.76s] corporates to uh to do better now that
[3371.92s] we have a lower rates lower chance of
[3373.88s] default Ye Ye yes yeah I think spreads
[3377.359s] are going to narrow as that as that
[3381.48s] window actually high yield spreads blew
[3384.359s] out a hair uh in in recent weeks I think
[3388.039s] now that markets are getting comfortable
[3390.799s] that the window is reopening for
[3393.16s] companies quote unquote with distress
[3394.799s] I.E small cap companies to
[3396.839s] refinance uh corporate bonds should do
[3398.88s] well we don&#39;t really traffic in that
[3400.599s] area so I don&#39;t want to make any like
[3401.96s] calls on corporate bonds but as far as
[3404.799s] the 10-year yield our short-term view
[3407.96s] which we don&#39;t trade on short-term view
[3410.88s] we you know we tend to hold our
[3412.4s] companies two to four to five years
[3414.4s] unless they perform way f faster than
[3416.88s] would would be expected in which case
[3418.92s] but uh that that&#39;s a champagne problem
[3422.96s] um I think he get a counter Trend move I
[3425.44s] think he probably get a counter Trend
[3426.72s] bounce on the dollar the trend for the
[3428.68s] dollar is lower uh again that was
[3431.839s] another thing that we were contrarian on
[3433.839s] has proven right it&#39;s gotten weaker now
[3435.92s] that everyone&#39;s getting on board with
[3437.359s] that view I think we get a contrarian uh
[3440.68s] shortterm bounce strength in the dollar
[3443.72s] and
[3445.16s] um and a short-term rise in yields the
[3449.48s] antithesis of what everyone&#39;s expecting
[3451.28s] you know oh when the FED Cuts rates will
[3453.839s] go down no what the FED actually did on
[3457.039s] Wednesday and we said in our podcast on
[3458.88s] Tuesday I said I didn&#39;t think it was
[3461.72s] probable that they would cut
[3463.52s] 50% but based on what I was looking at I
[3466.44s] said it was plausible that they would
[3469.359s] and on the basis of that people would
[3471.88s] expect yields to go lower they would go
[3473.319s] higher and the reason they would go
[3474.559s] higher is because basis points at this
[3478.799s] time dramatically increases the odds of
[3481.319s] a soft landing and a growth re
[3484.2s] acceleration which favors cyclicals
[3486.28s] which favors small caps which favors
[3488.839s] value um and what I was looking at in
[3492.52s] terms of yields being compressed and
[3494.48s] Staples and utilities you know utilities
[3496.96s] are up
[3497.839s] 50% as a basket since last fall and now
[3501.52s] everyone wants utilities I said there&#39;s
[3503.16s] going to be a counter Trend move those
[3505.28s] were the only like shooting a barrel
[3507.079s] shorts which we&#39;re not going to short
[3508.359s] defensives into a potential period of of
[3511.44s] volatility so how can the market cause
[3514.4s] the most pain to the most amount of
[3515.599s] people that would be a counter Trend
[3517.48s] move in yields which means utilities
[3519.16s] would go down uh bonds would go down
[3521.24s] yields would go up why because now that
[3523.44s] utilities are up 50% everyone&#39;s chasing
[3525.4s] them no one wanted them 50% ago in the
[3527.599s] fall of last year so I think that&#39;s the
[3529.64s] that&#39;s the trend and if that&#39;s the trend
[3532.72s] it&#39;s hard to see a scenario where you
[3534.48s] have a monstrous
[3536.559s] draw down in equities ahead of the
[3538.68s] election even though the probabilities
[3541.76s] would favor weakness into the election I
[3544.799s] think too many
[3546.72s] people are positioned for that and the
[3549.2s] market doesn&#39;t reward when everyone&#39;s
[3550.92s] crowded into one trade it tends to
[3553.119s] punish that this particularly tends to
[3555.2s] punish the Johnny come lately&#39;s and
[3556.76s] there have been a lot who would never be
[3559.68s] getting into utilities three months ago
[3562.68s] all crowded in now that they&#39;re up 50%
[3564.799s] final question I&#39;ll let you go Tom uh on
[3566.48s] Central Bank Divergence which actually
[3567.96s] we started with let&#39;s close off on that
[3569.559s] so like you pointed out central banks
[3571.4s] around the world kept rates and changed
[3573.64s] uh this week would this pose a risk uh
[3576.16s] in the next coming months suppose we
[3577.92s] continue to get this Divergence with a
[3579.4s] Fed cuts by 25 basis points like you
[3581.839s] said um or even 50 in in some extreme
[3584.559s] cases but other central banks stay Pat
[3586.64s] wouldn&#39;t that induce Capital flows out
[3588.2s] of the US into Japan or any other place
[3590.319s] that has relatively higher rates now
[3593.72s] that will be the trend over time I think
[3597.4s] the trend
[3598.92s] overtime it overtime meaning
[3601.119s] intermediate term 12 to 24 months is
[3605.24s] weaker
[3606.52s] dollar
[3608.039s] bonds rally over time I think the
[3610.839s] short-term counter trend is stronger
[3612.68s] dollar next few weeks uh yields out next
[3615.559s] few weeks but looking out a few months
[3618.48s] to more than a few months uh you&#39;ll
[3621.119s] resume a A downtrend in the dollar
[3623.64s] you&#39;ll resume uh bid in bonds that all
[3627.079s] favors the groups that we&#39;ve discussed
[3629.52s] so far uh and and the stage is setting
[3632.48s] for the for the area that no one wants
[3634.44s] to touch which is emerging markets and
[3636.559s] we&#39;ve been pounding the drum but you
[3638.16s] know sooner or later these Frameworks
[3640.92s] they repeat themselves over and over and
[3642.599s] over and the conditions are set the
[3644.319s] table is set right now uh that&#39;s going
[3646.72s] to be the next thing to surprise people
[3649.4s] just as when you couldn&#39;t give away the
[3651.88s] 10year uh some time back and we were
[3654.2s] pounding the table on that that that had
[3656.24s] a big big rally um for that instrument
[3660.64s] and now that everyone wants it you get
[3662.039s] the counter Trend move excellent where
[3663.64s] can we follow you Tom uh I&#39;m on Twitter

[3690.72s] right all year let&#39;s see what happens in
[3692.079s] the next couple of months you&#39;ve got a
[3693.28s] few months left to be wrong but uh
[3696.24s] exactly we got to keep our humility when
[3698.079s] when you&#39;re on a run like that uh so
[3701.24s] that that&#39;s the name of the game that&#39;s
[3702.52s] why we just try to stick to good
[3704.68s] companies at reasonable prices and then
[3706.48s] we play the time Arbitrage game so we
[3708.119s] don&#39;t have to be right about all these
[3709.559s] zigs and zags but I know you like the
[3711.559s] zigs and zags so I&#39;m grateful to be on
[3713.2s] and talk with you all right well we&#39;ll
[3714.64s] talk next time about sub that maybe
[3716.4s] haven&#39;t worked down your career that
[3717.48s] could be a fun
[3718.52s] discussion maybe a long one too all
[3720.92s] right thanks my friend thank you for
[3723.559s] watching yeah thank you for
[3732.599s] watching and we&#39;re back and then on
[3736.72s] Tuesday literally an hour and a half
[3739.24s] before they announced the stimulus you
[3740.839s] got to hear what I was saying to Sean
[3742.52s] Caleb on cgtn America
[3746.4s] basically on Chinese TV telling the
[3748.92s] Chinese government you know let&#39;s go you
[3751.2s] got to stimulate uh so I don&#39;t know if
[3754.76s] they heard it but it is their channel so
[3757.319s] uh they definitely acted pretty quickly
[3759.119s] on that well the fed&#39;s decision to cut
[3761.52s] that Benchmark interest rate has
[3763.079s] far-reaching consequences not just in
[3765.52s] the United States but across the globe
[3767.76s] worldwide the fed&#39;s decision to loosen
[3770.079s] its per strings could encourage other
[3772.279s] economies to do the same thing Reuters
[3775.079s] reports it has has tracked about nine
[3777.079s] emerging economies already cutting rates
[3779.319s] this cycle however experts say
[3781.599s] institutions such as the European
[3783.2s] Central Bank and the bank of England
[3785.0s] will be more cautious with fewer plans
[3787.72s] for more Cuts ahead the feds rate will
[3790.72s] also have an impact on foreign exchange
[3793.16s] rates as the world&#39;s principal Reserve
[3795.119s] currency the US dollar has a huge impact
[3797.599s] on the cost of borrowing for emerging
[3799.44s] markets now a weakened dollar could lift
[3802.88s] other currencies with the Yen and Swiss
[3805.16s] frank EXP expect to see some relief
[3807.44s] through 2025 now for a deeper dive into
[3810.52s] all this and how the fed&#39;s decision is
[3812.359s] going to impact economies all over the
[3813.92s] world let&#39;s bring in our friend Thomas
[3815.92s] Hayes he&#39;s the founder chairman and
[3817.92s] managing member of great Hill capital a
[3820.52s] long short Equity manager based in New
[3822.48s] York City Thomas great to have you back
[3824.319s] on I find this pretty fascinating let&#39;s
[3826.4s] broadly speaking kind of walk us through
[3829.0s] how you see the FED reserves rate cut
[3831.559s] influencing the global
[3833.559s] economy well Sean thanks for having me
[3835.559s] on
[3836.48s] I think the number one thing that
[3837.96s] happened with the 50 basis point cut and
[3840.119s] frontloading that cut to a large size is
[3842.96s] it took a hard Landing off the table
[3846.599s] what we saw as the immediate response as
[3849.4s] it relates to bonds was a buy the rumor
[3853.24s] sell the news so while everyone said
[3855.64s] well rates are going down now 50 basis
[3857.76s] points why did yields go up in the last
[3861.319s] few trading sessions following that 50
[3863.76s] basis point cut and that&#39;s because a a
[3865.799s] lot of it was priced in ahead of the cut
[3868.039s] but I I do think that is a counter Trend
[3870.64s] move counter Trend uh move higher in
[3873.799s] yields in the short term over the next
[3875.92s] couple of weeks counter Trend move
[3878.319s] higher in the US dollar a short term
[3880.96s] over the next few weeks but I think as
[3882.4s] you look at the intermediate term and
[3885.0s] the continued cuts and the continued
[3887.599s] reduction of restriction you&#39;re going to
[3889.16s] see a weakening of the dollar uh you&#39;re
[3891.64s] going to see rates come down and that
[3893.72s] bodess extremely well
[3896.319s] for emerging markets equities let&#39;s talk
[3900.279s] a bit more about the impact on these
[3902.599s] Emerging Markets because Emerging
[3904.119s] Markets borrow money and if the interest
[3906.68s] rate is going to be reduced it seems it
[3908.559s] is going to ease the burden on Nations
[3911.079s] borrowing These funds yeah there&#39;s no
[3913.64s] question uh what you see in periods like
[3916.2s] this of U uh easing cycle for the FED is
[3920.839s] emerging market equities tend to
[3923.52s] outperform developed Market equity ities
[3926.68s] uh in the US small caps tend to
[3929.039s] outperform large caps by 11% in the
[3932.16s] first 12 months value stocks outperform
[3935.48s] growth and consumer discretionary comes
[3939.039s] back and outperforms Consumer Staples
[3941.48s] we&#39;ve seen a huge crowding into consumer
[3945.52s] staples and utilities I.E defensive
[3948.48s] stocks ahead of the cut and now that we
[3951.279s] have cut uh the 50 basis point cut I
[3953.96s] think it&#39;s reset growth expectations if
[3957.279s] a hard Landing is off the table we could
[3959.44s] see higher than expected growth coming
[3961.4s] forward and that shifts the the type of
[3963.839s] stocks you want to be in now let&#39;s think
[3965.559s] back to that Friday when the rate cut
[3966.96s] came because the markets really didn&#39;t
[3968.279s] do much that day but they have rallied
[3970.319s] uh in the in the coming days uh after
[3972.279s] that so let&#39;s talk about the impact of
[3974.4s] the strength of the US dollar and global
[3976.44s] trade balances and I&#39;m curious about the
[3979.0s] fact you think that the US Central Bank
[3980.799s] cut is going to have on China if
[3984.4s] any well well
[3987.0s] historically uh Chinese equities is a
[3989.92s] large weight in the emerging market
[3991.64s] equities index and we believe that
[3994.799s] Chinese equities will start to
[3996.559s] outperform it is going to need some help
[3998.559s] from the Chinese government itself in
[4000.559s] terms of a larger more aggressive
[4002.68s] stimulus but the table is set if the
[4005.44s] Chinese government moves to stimulate uh
[4008.44s] you are going to see a dramatic
[4009.96s] outperformance of Chinese equities over
[4012.839s] us equities in the next 1 to 3 years if
[4015.64s] they fail to do that and they start to
[4017.52s] miss their growth targets uh it may be a
[4020.44s] more subdued response and a missed
[4022.92s] opportunity of a lifetime for the
[4024.48s] Chinese government and the Chinese
[4025.92s] people interesting okay how do interest
[4028.559s] rate Cuts impact International Capital
[4030.599s] flows especially in sectors like real
[4033.119s] estate and Technology to a certain
[4034.88s] degree as the global markets are pushing
[4037.0s] for this soft Landing you&#39;ve been
[4038.16s] talking about Nations tend to play
[4040.279s] Follow of the lader now we know that the
[4042.48s] Eurozone uh and the bank of England they
[4044.96s] made cuts ahead of time so other nations
[4048.72s] these emerging Nations uh they&#39;re going
[4050.4s] to be rising rates to Cil inflation to
[4052.4s] try to stimulate growth money goes where
[4055.24s] it&#39;s treated best so on balance uh money
[4058.68s] is going to flow into those places that
[4060.68s] have higher yields that&#39;s going to
[4062.559s] strengthen some of the Emerging Markets
[4064.319s] currencies I also believe a lot of
[4066.24s] currencies relative to the US dollar
[4067.599s] whether it&#39;s the Canadian dollar the
[4069.119s] British pound the Euro uh Emerging
[4071.559s] Market currencies over time and the big
[4074.16s] story that we have to keep our on is the
[4076.48s] Yen because while we&#39;ve had about 85 90
[4079.68s] Cuts around the world year to dat uh the
[4083.799s] bank of Japan is looking to start to
[4086.44s] curb inflation and they started with a
[4089.68s] hike in August we saw the result of that
[4092.52s] in the first week of August a big
[4094.68s] correction then they said oh we were
[4096.04s] just kidding we&#39;re not going to do that
[4097.279s] so much anymore certainly not until the
[4099.56s] FED got easy which they just did so I
[4102.4s] think before the end of the year we
[4104.159s] could see more tightening by Bank of
[4105.839s] Japan which is a stronger Yen against
[4108.56s] the dollar uh and maybe more subdued
[4111.64s] response in Japanese equities than we&#39;ve
[4114.279s] seen in recent years I like that just
[4116.359s] kidding okay with inflation cooling down
[4118.64s] do you think this rate cut is going to
[4120.199s] reignite inflationary pressures in other
[4122.719s] parts of the world you talked a bit
[4124.04s] about what happened in
[4126.64s] Japan uh Japan is not affected uh their
[4130.48s] inflation is affected by many many many
[4133.239s] years of e you know very easy easy
[4135.799s] policy by the bank of Japan so that that
[4137.679s] won&#39;t be impacted as much by the US
[4140.4s] policy I do think that US inflation
[4144.239s] should hover closer to a mean of 3% over
[4148.799s] the next few few years versus a mean of
[4151.6s] 2% I.E the fed target uh and that&#39;s
[4154.679s] probably a good thing when you have debt
[4156.0s] to GDP at
[4158.679s] 120% uh historically like we saw post
[4161.239s] World War II if you run inflation a
[4163.56s] little hotter than normal it&#39;s easier to
[4165.719s] bring those debt to GDP ratios down than
[4169.12s] if you start to get closer to deflation
[4172.159s] uh then the then the debt problem could
[4173.759s] be a bigger issue so I think 3% 3 three
[4176.799s] and a half is The Sweet Spot and that&#39;s
[4178.679s] probably the base case for the next few
[4180.56s] years qu quickly Thomas not a lot of
[4182.359s] time left here but I&#39;m curious if you
[4183.759s] think that the FED waited too long to
[4185.759s] cut interest rates because there was
[4187.199s] that concern if they cut 50 basis points
[4189.44s] then they waited too long and the
[4191.04s] markets were going to have an adverse
[4192.52s] reaction that first day when not a whole
[4194.64s] lot happened I think people were tense
[4197.04s] they waited too long and they&#39;re going
[4198.4s] to get away with it so I&#39;ll leave it at
[4201.239s] that uh I think that the frontload was
[4203.719s] positive we&#39;re going to see in the jobs
[4205.96s] report uh not this Friday but the Friday
[4208.159s] after uh and then that will determine
[4210.719s] how quickly they have to catch up look
[4212.56s] they were behind the curve on inflation
[4214.6s] but they caught up uh let&#39;s hope that uh
[4217.0s] they can catch up in time and I think
[4219.04s] they will in fact pull off the soft to
[4221.199s] no Landing uh by moving as aggressively
[4224.32s] and as quickly as they did well I think
[4225.719s] a lot of investors are hoping you&#39;re
[4227.12s] exactly right Thomas thank you so much
[4228.76s] we appreciate it thank you Sean okay and
[4232.32s] then I had two hits after last week&#39;s
[4235.08s] podcast uh one on Neil Cavuto want to
[4238.12s] thank Neil and Jenna d tomases That&#39;s
[4241.64s] Scott Martin who was uh super excited
[4244.48s] that day it was before the FED hike fed
[4247.679s] cut rather uh you can listening to that
[4250.12s] on your own uh that&#39;s just basically
[4252.44s] anticipating the uh the cut as well as
[4255.84s] CBS News I was on also the day of it
[4259.199s] talks about the implications of
[4260.48s] mortgages and consumers so you can
[4262.199s] listen to that on your own want to thank
[4265.6s] um Camille Smith for having me on CBS
[4269.08s] and then want to thank the New York Post
[4270.679s] for including me in the article about
[4272.84s] Nike shoes so on December 5th to 7th
[4277.719s] I&#39;ll be speaking in Sarasota at the
[4280.08s] money show you can click here to
[4282.44s] register for that event if you&#39;re going
[4284.56s] to be down in Florida take advantage and
[4287.679s] our quote of the week if from Seth
[4290.4s] claran the stock market is a story of
[4292.76s] cycles and of the human behavior that is
[4296.199s] responsible for overreactions in both
[4299.56s] directions and you know these are some
[4301.6s] of the quotes that got us through when
[4303.92s] everyone was flipping out when Baba went
[4305.84s] down for no apparent reason because the
[4307.8s] fundamentals continued to perform and in
[4310.6s] most cases improve and now we&#39;re just
[4314.08s] literally getting started I got to tell
[4315.88s] you the the big joke of today is all the
[4319.6s] texts and emails and phone calls oh wow
[4322.239s] you know congratulations blah blah blah
[4324.88s] I&#39;m like on what we&#39;re we&#39;re just
[4326.239s] getting started they&#39;re like should I
[4327.199s] sell some blah blah blah and and this is
[4329.52s] going to be the entire way up you&#39;re
[4331.48s] going to see people selling the short
[4334.84s] selling um buying the short-term tops
[4337.84s] and selling the short-term bottoms the
[4339.48s] whole way up because it won&#39;t be
[4340.8s] believed everyone will be skeptical and
[4343.0s] they&#39;ll miss the entire thing meanwhile
[4346.04s] saying if we get a pullback I want to go
[4348.36s] to
[4349.04s] 25% uh I&#39;m going to break all of my
[4351.679s] positioning rules and double it um so
[4354.84s] you know just a difference of opinion
[4358.4s] um moving right along to our data for
[4362.679s] the week we&#39;ve got a lot of it and
[4365.6s] that&#39;s why we are prepared luck is when
[4368.679s] preparation meets opportunity and that&#39;s
[4370.639s] what we try to do here and share with
[4373.239s] our awesome amazing
[4375.639s] treasured audience that you are so here
[4379.239s] is some data from G talking about uh
[4383.96s] what happens after the first cut and you
[4385.96s] can see on balance the returns are
[4388.36s] pretty solid except when there&#39;s a
[4390.84s] recession and the GDP just got revised
[4393.639s] up to 3% the Atlanta GD for Q2 Atlanta
[4397.76s] today Atlanta GDP is still hovering
[4400.56s] around 3% very hard to have a recession
[4402.52s] with 3% GDP which knocks these two
[4405.12s] columns out which means uh basically
[4407.76s] 100% positivity ratio without a
[4411.28s] recession uh this is a S&amp;P 500 after the
[4414.76s] NYSC mlen summation index cycled from
[4417.719s] below a 100 to above a thousand
[4420.12s] instances within 2% of a fiveyear high
[4422.84s] and what you can see here is as you look
[4425.0s] out two weeks two months 6 months and 12
[4428.92s] months uh the median and the mean are uh
[4434.08s] mid double digit mid- teens double
[4437.52s] digits manufacturing production for
[4439.96s] August month- on-month Vehicles went up
[4442.4s] 17.3% so that&#39;s a positive thing S&amp;P 500
[4446.36s] after first decrease in fed funds ratio
[4448.56s] after five or more increases and you see
[4451.719s] the mean gain 12 months out 13.4 so
[4455.4s] everyone you know finagles the inputs
[4458.32s] and everything else the bottom line is
[4460.56s] the cuts are a good thing particularly
[4462.36s] when you&#39;re not you&#39;re near New highs
[4464.36s] and you&#39;re not uh in or near a recession
[4467.679s] uh industrial production picked up
[4469.4s] that&#39;s a positive thing we&#39;ve talked
[4470.76s] about pmis in past weeks you also see
[4473.56s] margin debt this is from Seth
[4476.52s] golden um declined in August so very
[4480.639s] hard to say it&#39;s a bubble or investors
[4482.159s] are exuberant now on the flip side he
[4484.639s] also posted yeah so uh so that&#39;s that
[4488.719s] asset class quilt of returns that&#39;s from
[4491.32s] last week um we&#39;ll leave that this is it
[4495.159s] shows stocks bonds T bills gold and US
[4497.96s] dollar over time as a reminder you can&#39;t
[4501.52s] compete with stocks over the long-term
[4504.4s] 6.9% compounded and that includes the
[4506.76s] 1800s which were a complete disaster if
[4509.4s] you take out the 1800s it&#39;s more like N9
[4511.48s] or 10% including dividends uh versus
[4515.08s] bonds at you know three three and a half
[4517.44s] percent mix of price and wage inflation
[4520.44s] bodess well for profit margins that&#39;s
[4522.84s] from Goldman Sachs so you know 15%
[4527.4s] earnings growth next year margins
[4529.12s] increasing oh and by the way uh the uh
[4533.12s] albatross around the the global
[4535.04s] economy&#39;s neck has been China&#39;s slowing
[4537.08s] growth which just changed overnight when
[4538.92s] they announced fiscal stimulus in
[4540.44s] addition to the monetary wage growth is
[4543.0s] slowed points of continued moderation
[4544.84s] that&#39;s a good thing for uh inflation not
[4547.639s] ticking back up but it will it&#39;ll be
[4549.44s] about three three and a half percent and
[4550.84s] that&#39;s a good thing not a bad thing
[4552.6s] Goldman Sachs economists expect roughly
[4555.719s] stable employment so they&#39;re expecting
[4557.96s] this to go back down from their lips to
[4559.52s] God&#39;s ears although as they&#39;ve said
[4562.0s] historically they are doing God&#39;s work
[4563.84s] so they must know uh earnings estimates
[4566.92s] hanging in there at 278 for next year
[4569.12s] which is about 15% earnings growth
[4572.159s] 15.2 uh it&#39;s interesting the the chorus
[4575.08s] now is expectations are too high
[4578.48s] therefore the Market&#39;s too expensive and
[4580.84s] that was the exact same chorus last
[4583.639s] October when everyone was selling in the
[4585.36s] whole that expectations were too high
[4587.56s] and not only did they meet but they met
[4589.48s] they exceeded expectations for this year
[4592.6s] as the city group surprise economic
[4594.92s] surprise index is finally turning up not
[4598.44s] down up not down which is a which is
[4601.639s] what happens when the market goes up
[4604.08s] after you see stuff like that
[4608.48s] um 75 to 76 asset rally spurred by the
[4612.56s] FED cutting from 9% to 4% what
[4615.6s] outperformed small cap and value which
[4618.199s] we covered with Brad and with Kristen
[4621.52s] this morning um money market assets
[4624.84s] peaked nine months after the first cut
[4627.44s] so all but this was a jumbo cut so it
[4629.76s] might be much faster which means that
[4631.84s] Six Trillion or whatever whatever it is
[4634.719s] right now is going to be coming out of
[4637.84s] money market funds and into equities and
[4640.76s] that&#39;s why we&#39;ve been talking not just
[4643.28s] this year and last year and 2022 when
[4646.159s] you couldn&#39;t give away stocks and 2020
[4648.44s] when you couldn&#39;t give away stocks go
[4650.08s] back and look at the tapes we&#39;re buying
[4651.96s] Handover fist um but now you&#39;ve got all
[4655.719s] of this dry powder that in coming months
[4657.92s] is going to come back into equities even
[4659.84s] if you get a little short-term
[4661.44s] volatility and uh that&#39;s a good thing
[4663.56s] not a bad thing stocks on Pace to
[4665.44s] diverge from historic September slump uh
[4669.28s] and we&#39;re going to talk a little bit
[4670.48s] about that in the article of the week
[4673.28s] consensus projecting 18% EPS growth by
[4676.719s] year end
[4679.6s] 2025 uh that&#39;s a big deal us new vehicle
[4684.4s] sales forecast for August got taken up
[4687.96s] uh year on-ear to
[4689.92s] 8% and month- on Monon over July of 12%
[4695.4s] growth September was a little softer so
[4697.28s] we&#39;re going to look at some estimates in
[4698.56s] just a little bit but it is tracking to
[4701.28s] where we needed to track for Cooper
[4702.76s] standard which is a good thing and
[4705.08s] allows room for a positive upside
[4707.04s] surprise as rates come down as in as
[4709.92s] incentives go up into year end to clear
[4712.88s] those EVS that aren&#39;t selling and
[4715.08s] replace them with hybrids which are a
[4717.199s] money machine for Cooper
[4720.679s] standard evidence of ruring more jobs
[4724.08s] coming manufacturing construction you
[4726.199s] can look at the data manufacturing
[4727.76s] employment is finally ticking up after a
[4729.76s] two two and a half year depression is
[4732.76s] what manufacturing has been in uh
[4735.44s] manufacturing construction spending is
[4737.52s] hockey sticking on the electrical and
[4740.08s] electronic uh areas IE data centers Etc
[4743.639s] so that&#39;s going to be a positive
[4745.6s] thing us semiconductor additions these
[4749.84s] are uh facilities Intel uh the money
[4753.239s] from the government Micron Samsung
[4756.239s] Taiwan semiconductor Texas Instruments
[4758.48s] and you can see Arizona New Mexico Ohio
[4761.84s] this is jobs this is construction this
[4764.04s] is manufact uring this is Stanley Black
[4766.44s] and&amp; Decker tools and what are they
[4768.12s] going to need they&#39;re going to need
[4769.159s] backup systems from J this is going to
[4772.159s] be incredible uh corporate commentary on
[4775.28s] reshoring everyone&#39;s talking about
[4777.159s] reshoring across corporate conference
[4779.52s] calls it&#39;s through the roof construction
[4781.92s] pipeline for the US data centers is
[4784.719s] rising uh stuff is old capex is coming
[4788.48s] back manufacturing capacity starting to
[4790.6s] grow after 10 years of stagnation capex
[4794.28s] as a percentage of operating cash flow
[4796.8s] just off historic lows infrastructure
[4799.679s] spend is finally ticking up that Ira
[4801.96s] money is getting into the economy and um
[4806.52s] bil project announcements focus on roads
[4810.4s] Bridges and other major projects coming
[4813.52s] to a theater near you construction spend
[4816.08s] on US highways and streets is 140
[4818.719s] billion dollar last year keeps going up
[4822.239s] uh 15% year-on-year inflation adjusted
[4824.76s] growth employment growth is holding up
[4826.639s] for Highway Street and Bridge
[4828.159s] construction that&#39;s good value of
[4830.52s] construction put in place is growing
[4832.28s] value so you can just see the story is
[4835.12s] very very clear Motor Vehicles in Miles
[4838.639s] increased 10% since
[4841.639s] 20110 uh but the fatality rate rate is
[4844.8s] no longer declining okay the key thing
[4847.84s] here is that you&#39;ve got the average car
[4851.08s] on the road at 13.7 years which is a
[4853.6s] record all-time high
[4855.32s] and the amount of use per vehicle is
[4858.32s] going up every single year not down
[4861.36s] which means they&#39;re going to require
[4862.44s] more maintenance and more replacement
[4864.239s] it&#39;s huge pent up it was waiting for
[4866.44s] rates it&#39;s coming to a theater near you
[4869.04s] and it&#39;s going to be lower prices and
[4871.04s] lower financing costs um all day long
[4874.8s] coming from dealer incentives to clear
[4877.36s] the Lots before the end of the year and
[4879.32s] the production is going to ramp up
[4880.92s] Global car production you can see here
[4882.96s] the numbers ramping up and this is also
[4886.48s] very
[4887.639s] interesting a lot
[4890.12s] of the fiscal spend you can see here but
[4892.88s] a lot of people very very pessimistic
[4894.56s] but when you look at the Bull and Bear
[4896.04s] indicator from Bank of America it&#39;s not
[4898.4s] yet at an extreme and which is why we
[4900.239s] keep seeing these atypical
[4902.96s] seasonal
[4904.8s] um strength and why two or three weeks
[4908.8s] ago when we got on here and we said you
[4911.04s] know we really want to hedge or be
[4913.52s] tactically short but when we looked
[4914.96s] across 2,000 companies the only thing we
[4917.52s] could find that we wanted to short were
[4919.6s] defensives and you don&#39;t short
[4921.48s] defensives if you&#39;re looking for a
[4923.84s] market correction so what it tells me is
[4926.159s] everyone already hedged out and if you
[4928.12s] look at skew and if you look at vix
[4930.4s] ahead of the FED cut and um so probably
[4934.48s] the maximum pain trade the Market&#39;s
[4936.44s] designed to fool most of the people most
[4938.12s] of the time is that we grind sideways
[4940.96s] through the election uh for the passive
[4944.6s] investors the indices people the mag s
[4947.199s] people uh burn through all that put
[4949.48s] premium give them a goose egg for their
[4952.48s] efforts uh or push higher those would be
[4955.6s] the two pain trades based on how people
[4957.4s] are positioned with their insurance
[4959.199s] record levels of insurance record cost
[4961.679s] of insurance to protect against downside
[4964.44s] both uh skew particularly for one and
[4967.52s] two standard deviation events um and so
[4971.32s] on which is why we remain fully invested
[4973.36s] very low Leverage will ride any October
[4975.639s] bumps and and play the year in rally
[4977.719s] provided we get gridlock us to basement
[4980.239s] International outperformance US versus
[4982.36s] global equities this game is over ladies
[4984.92s] and gentlemen I&#39;m telling you uh
[4987.92s] it&#39;s this is amazing I mean if you
[4990.719s] thought the extreme was in 2000 it&#39;s
[4993.88s] pales in comparison to how extreme we
[4995.679s] are right now that is changing now China
[4998.6s] just decided that is changing you are
[5000.6s] going to see Emerging Markets outperform
[5002.679s] developed markets and it may very well
[5004.719s] be for the exact amount of time that
[5006.96s] they&#39;ve underperformed which is the last
[5008.92s] decade in a z Zer environment where mag
[5012.239s] 7 outperformed now I think you&#39;re going
[5014.92s] to see uh emerging markets in a
[5018.32s] normalized rate environment with China
[5021.04s] stimulus uh and the demographics uh
[5023.639s] dramatically outperform and this will
[5025.0s] revert back to the mean not to say the
[5026.8s] US will crash they&#39;ll just do a lot less
[5029.52s] well than uh how what we&#39;re positioned
[5033.0s] to take advantage of
[5036.48s] um okay us retail sales ticked up last
[5039.12s] month sign of ongoing consumer
[5043.08s] resilience gas stations were weak
[5046.44s] retailers were strong health and
[5048.36s] personal
[5049.36s] care industrial production is up that&#39;s
[5052.32s] good rebounds after Hurricane related
[5054.239s] drop manufacturing production that&#39;s
[5056.12s] Vehicles we talked about up
[5058.199s] 177% uh Max manufacturing production you
[5061.239s] can see it visually here here&#39;s the FED
[5063.48s] GDP now
[5065.159s] at uh
[5068.12s] 3% homeb Builder confidence is coming
[5070.639s] off the death you know it&#39;s like a
[5072.08s] Phoenix Rising From the Ashes uh as
[5074.679s] rates come down that will come back
[5076.56s] create more Supply rates come down more
[5078.679s] Supply coming on the market for housing
[5081.239s] uh us on Pace for more gas power
[5083.56s] capacity that is good
[5086.0s] for uh U us gas power plants that&#39;s
[5089.0s] going to be natural gas all day long
[5091.92s] Jerry Jones and great Hill capital are
[5094.76s] going to benefit with Comm stock

[5104.76s] situation we deal with exclusively with

[5109.04s] and institutions family offices uh
[5112.159s] prioritization of returning cash to
[5114.36s] shareholders at an 11-year high this is
[5116.96s] concerning to me uh and this is what
[5119.08s] I&#39;ve always said I&#39;d rather buy
[5120.36s] companies like the chinesee who are
[5122.159s] buying their stock trading at six and
[5123.76s] eight times earnings versus the
[5125.92s] Americans like Jensen Wong uh uh buying
[5130.639s] back $50 billion a stock at 42 times
[5134.8s] sales and dumping three4 of a billion on
[5137.84s] the retail uh investor after they
[5140.08s] announce a split uh you
[5143.04s] know it is what it is all right percent
[5145.96s] of debt that&#39;s floating rate small caps
[5148.4s] 27.4 that&#39;s why small caps are going to
[5150.52s] outperform over the first 12 months
[5153.08s] refinancing window opens that will help
[5155.4s] Cooper standard in the first quarter uh
[5157.76s] refinance all of their debt which will
[5159.32s] be another Catalyst small cap forward PE
[5161.56s] relative to S&amp;P
[5163.28s] 500 uh the last time it was this low was
[5166.44s] 2001 we continue to repeat 2002 to 2007
[5170.88s] good analog Emerging Markets small caps
[5173.199s] outperform value outperform value ETF
[5175.96s] flows are picking up this month see
[5177.92s] enough people are listening to my
[5179.239s] podcast these days there you go I&#39;m
[5181.36s] joking us multif family completions
[5183.52s] highest since
[5185.159s] 1974 that&#39;s probably going to be an area
[5187.719s] where you start to find your next batch
[5189.52s] of Bargains in the next 6 to 18 months
[5193.2s] [Music]
[5194.92s] um Regional valuation you can see where
[5197.96s] we are relative to the mean in the USA
[5200.56s] going back the last 20 years well on the
[5202.88s] top end the world well on the top well
[5205.4s] above the top end um
[5208.36s] Japan mid Europe
[5211.88s] mid um Asia Pacific X Japan mid and
[5215.679s] Emerging Markets mid 11 times versus 21
[5219.239s] times you tell me price is what you pay
[5221.48s] value is what you get Boeing&#39;s business
[5223.679s] is much more than just commercial planes
[5225.8s] you can see here six billion of their
[5227.92s] business defense space and security is
[5229.6s] six billion and Global Services is five
[5232.32s] billion so there&#39;s a huge Diversified
[5234.52s] amazing business we&#39;ve taken advantage
[5236.719s] of every day the strike goes on we buy
[5239.159s] more stock thank you very much I get to
[5241.32s] buy more share in a duopoly with a
[5244.239s] 10-year backlog of customers not a whole
[5246.719s] lot to think about there they&#39;ll get it
[5248.199s] settled one way or another US Stocks
[5250.8s] make up nearly 2third of the msci world
[5253.76s] Index this is another sign of extreme
[5256.32s] just like the mag 7 waiting in the S&amp;P
[5258.4s] 500 these will revert back to the mean
[5261.56s] and we&#39;ll see that without performance
[5263.32s] of emerging and xus versus Us in the
[5266.96s] next uh half to full decade and uh no
[5270.719s] one&#39;s position for it other than great
[5273.44s] Hill capital and a few others that
[5275.159s] listen to the podcast which we&#39;re very
[5277.04s] excited about them growth expectations
[5279.36s] remain weak which remains me makes me
[5281.44s] think that we can continue to climb the
[5283.08s] wall of worry this is from the fund
[5285.0s] manager survey this is not what you see
[5286.88s] near euphoric Tops This is what you see
[5289.08s] near bottoms where you want to be a
[5291.0s] buyer which makes no sense because we&#39;re
[5292.56s] a few percent from the or near or at
[5295.679s] all-time highs I think today uh dollar
[5298.56s] probably get a counter Trend bounce here
[5300.159s] before breaking lower which will
[5301.679s] continue to help emerging markets and
[5303.76s] intern National just like 2002 to 2007
[5307.92s] straight down ladies and gentlemen and I
[5310.239s] think we&#39;re going to have a similar
[5311.719s] regime in coming months and years
[5314.88s] Philadelphia manufacturing was up Bank
[5317.92s] of Japan kept interest ratees steady
[5319.639s] upgrades view on consumption they will
[5321.8s] be hiking probably before the end of the
[5324.36s] year probably after the election so be
[5326.92s] alert to that that will impact mag 7
[5330.08s] that will also impact Japanese equities
[5332.4s] I.E put pressure on both which leads to
[5335.199s] flows back into where China opinion
[5338.08s] follows Trend that all the Skeptics will
[5340.44s] be forced into it and it&#39;s interesting
[5342.84s] because you know while we&#39;re you know
[5345.4s] while we&#39;re you know Baba is up now
[5348.639s] almost 56 to 105 almost double off the
[5352.679s] bottom and the move hasn&#39;t even started
[5354.4s] yet and people will be chasing like
[5355.92s] nobody&#39;s business and they&#39;ll get really
[5357.48s] excited when it&#39;s up 200% off the bottom
[5359.679s] mark my words Japan customer inflation
[5362.56s] picked up in August a mid Bank of Japan
[5364.92s] rate hike
[5366.159s] view inflation means they&#39;re going to
[5368.32s] have to hike uh so keep an eye on that
[5370.56s] carry trade that&#39;s a that&#39;s a story a
[5373.44s] few months
[5374.48s] out um the other thing that&#39;s
[5376.88s] interesting here x recessions the first
[5378.88s] fed cut has marked the trough in the ISM
[5382.119s] Manufacturing PMI this is why small cap
[5385.88s] value cyclicals uh take off City
[5389.119s] economic surprise index turning up in a
[5391.159s] material way there&#39;s a new biggest bull
[5393.32s] on Wall Street raises its yearend
[5395.719s] Target to 6,100 that&#39;s Brian bsky here
[5399.159s] the CEOs can&#39;t buy enough stock at the
[5403.32s] top uh and they couldn&#39;t sell enough
[5406.36s] stock at the bottom you can&#39;t make this
[5408.679s] stuff up that they couldn&#39;t they would
[5411.6s] they you couldn&#39;t sell them a share when
[5414.08s] their stocks were down 50 and 75% and
[5416.96s] now that they&#39;re up double everyone
[5418.84s] wants to buy this is this is bad policy
[5421.4s] and that&#39;s one thing I&#39;m not going to
[5423.28s] say like I think China management is
[5425.719s] incredible or anything I just think that
[5428.48s] they get it I mean you buy your stock
[5430.88s] and you buy stocks generally quality
[5433.44s] when they&#39;re down not when they&#39;re up
[5435.8s] and um National Association active
[5438.48s] investment managers again moving up but
[5440.239s] not yet at extreme uh bull bear spread
[5442.8s] is towards extreme but it&#39;s a survey of
[5445.0s] 300 people so you know take it with a
[5447.4s] grain of salt uh average vix during
[5450.76s] election year since 1992 it should climb
[5453.199s] through October we&#39;ll see this year
[5454.8s] there you know between the cut the China
[5456.76s] stimulus it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting what&#39;s
[5458.6s] going on and everyone positioned short
[5461.239s] the the real pain would be a straight up
[5463.04s] but uh I think more likely a grind
[5465.239s] sideways in the US to search is to
[5468.96s] Google so mobile still have 95% share
[5472.8s] desktop is declining a little bit uh
[5475.679s] that&#39;s from
[5477.92s] Statia next ha half of bull market
[5481.44s] returns are in the made in the first 10%
[5484.88s] of the time this is very important and
[5487.119s] we&#39;ve actually just seen an example in
[5490.44s] Alibaba you know in 10% of the time
[5493.28s] we&#39;ve gotten a basically a double off
[5496.119s] the bottom 56 to
[5498.159s] 105 so you know that&#39;s why we
[5502.88s] say
[5504.48s] we we&#39;re patient we&#39;re low leverage and
[5507.56s] when it goes down we buy more because we
[5509.199s] want to be positioned when it turns it
[5511.119s] runs away without you and
[5514.48s] um it it&#39;s it&#39;s
[5518.4s] mindboggling AC like how much stock we
[5522.119s] were able to buy in the hole is
[5525.48s] staggering and it it&#39;s funny I was
[5528.04s] texting back and forth with a friend and
[5530.44s] I said I&#39;m G to send z a Christmas card
[5532.6s] because he took so long to finally do
[5535.719s] the stimulus probably a year longer than
[5537.52s] I expected I bought so much effing stock
[5540.36s] in the Hole uh down at lower levels than
[5542.92s] when I started that my basis is so much
[5545.239s] lower than where we are now thanks to
[5547.88s] him dragging his feet uh otherwise I
[5550.159s] wouldn&#39;t nearly have anywhere close to
[5552.0s] the size position we have and um so very
[5555.639s] grateful for that despite the extra
[5557.48s] white hairs uh there you go so
[5560.44s] conditions are right for Chinese stocks
[5561.96s] relative to Gold so this is from gaval
[5564.239s] from my friend uh who sent this
[5566.639s] over and it says China Market has been
[5569.239s] here before just before start of two
[5571.4s] bull markets this is the uh
[5574.56s] um Shanghai 180 Total return relative to
[5578.08s] gold in R&amp;B you can see when it gets
[5580.36s] down to these levels you start secular
[5581.96s] bull markets when&#39;s the last time it
[5583.4s] happened
[5585.96s] 2013 and then you got to go all the way
[5588.0s] back to the early 2000s average job
[5590.199s] growth per month in
[5592.6s] thousands uh pre-co average was 177,000
[5596.0s] we&#39;re at 174,000 so not yet in trouble
[5599.56s] the other thing that they&#39;re showing
[5601.119s] here the Som rule may be incorrect as
[5604.04s] the writer of the S rule uh said and
[5607.719s] that is that prime age non-employment
[5610.719s] rate is going down not up the general
[5614.08s] employment rate is going up so you can
[5615.84s] see this Divergence here and that&#39;s also
[5618.04s] in line with kind of what we said about
[5621.199s] inflation not inflation immigration
[5624.0s] adjusted unemployment rate was estimated
[5626.52s] to be four 3.6 versus 4.3 for the total
[5629.639s] inflation rate looks a lot like this
[5631.44s] Divergent here it unemployment at new
[5634.4s] high that&#39;s Tech mag 7 plus so keep that
[5637.04s] on your radar UK retail sales turning up
[5640.0s] so is Asos that tiny position we were
[5642.4s] going to cover it this week but you know
[5643.92s] with all the Baba news uh we&#39;ll probably
[5646.4s] push that out to either next quarter or
[5648.36s] the coming weeks that&#39;s a small position
[5650.28s] but we&#39;re looking to maybe add more on
[5652.239s] this UK recovery we do have a nice
[5654.32s] position in gxo to play the UK recovery
[5657.04s] so we&#39;re in no extreme rush and we made
[5659.639s] a lot of money on the Rolls-Royce
[5661.639s] recovery uh as well uh for those of you
[5664.32s] who&#39;ve been with us for a while UK
[5665.92s] retail sales beat expectations during
[5667.92s] August Sunny spell so I guess the Sun
[5670.36s] comes out and the Brits come out of the
[5671.88s] bar and spend money uh on stuff versus
[5674.679s] on Guinness which is a good thing not a
[5676.8s] bad thing earnings expectations for AI
[5679.159s] stock NOW lag the market so when was
[5683.8s] everyone buying it after earnings peaked
[5687.119s] and are now decelerating S&amp;P earnings
[5689.56s] are accelerating core to our theme
[5693.88s] uh dxy which is the dollar Index
[5696.44s] typically doesn&#39;t typically rally during
[5699.239s] cutting Cycles give this guy a raise
[5701.88s] Captain Obvious Autos benefit uh and
[5705.96s] then biggest relative overweight in
[5708.76s] defensive versus cyclical since May of
[5711.199s] 2020 what did you want to buy in May of
[5713.119s] 2020 if you were listening and what were
[5715.199s] we buying on the podcast cyclicals we
[5717.719s] were buying Banks we were buying oil in
[5719.76s] the Hole uh and uh and that made our 20
[5723.719s] 20 one of the best years ever this year
[5726.96s] uh has a shot uh we&#39;ll see how this
[5729.679s] plays out but it could be our best year
[5731.159s] ever we&#39;ll find out in a few months uh
[5734.199s] FMS risk appetite at 11mon low again not
[5738.08s] things you see at tops things you see
[5739.76s] closer to Bottoms this is the mag s
[5743.159s] profits decelerating rest of index
[5745.36s] accelerating we continue to reemphasize
[5747.32s] that each week dividends likely to
[5749.48s] contribute more to Total returns than
[5751.239s] during the last decade which would be a
[5753.04s] big deal big change from the Zer which
[5755.84s] implies what implies International with
[5758.44s] more dividends does better than domestic
[5760.44s] as well increase in volatility from July
[5763.159s] through November in presidential
[5764.52s] election years so we just keep our eye
[5766.04s] on it uh had a little volatility in
[5768.4s] August obviously with the carry trade
[5770.0s] early September um and we&#39;ll probably
[5772.8s] get another scare in October 12 month
[5775.639s] after first fed cut healthc care has
[5777.88s] highest hit rate um so that would be
[5781.32s] benefit us in terms of bio
[5784.84s] Tech
[5787.48s] um
[5789.36s] Etc the China stimulus a couple points
[5793.0s] well we&#39;ll go through that on the
[5793.96s] article of the week China reserve
[5795.4s] requirement ratio so we know that came
[5797.08s] down 50 basis point repo rate 20 basis
[5799.76s] points the key was the stimulus they&#39;re
[5801.52s] actually handing poor people $22 billion
[5804.199s] of checks they&#39;ve never really done that
[5806.08s] type of direct stimulus they&#39;re
[5807.84s] following the Western Playbook that
[5809.28s] worked so well during
[5811.76s] covid and they&#39;re issuing bonds for 280
[5815.44s] something billion dollars to start
[5817.04s] fiscal
[5817.96s] stimulus um which is a big big deal
[5821.04s] China Equity exposure at fiveyear lows
[5823.719s] just in time to miss the first 100% off
[5825.719s] the bottom uh pretty exciting stuff
[5828.679s] dollar is weakening relative to the
[5830.96s] Chinese Yuan remember we wanted to see
[5832.84s] two things Yuan strengthen and uh Bond
[5837.08s] Chinese bond yields start to go up they
[5839.08s] are beginning n stages that will
[5841.239s] accelerate now that the Bazooka stimulus
[5844.04s] bazooka not only monetary but fiscal and
[5846.44s] property has come out this week China
[5849.08s] hands out subsidies to car buyers
[5851.239s] subsidize away get the growth rate back
[5854.239s] Alibaba is the toll taker for all of
[5856.36s] China and we will benefit all day long
[5860.04s] fed officials leave door open to another
[5862.96s] large interest rate cut we now expect a
[5865.599s] series of consecutive 25 basis point
[5868.199s] cuts through June of
[5869.88s] 2025 Mar Market is now pricing 31 to 36
[5873.159s] basis points of cut for each of the next
[5875.4s] four meetings um which is from Goldman
[5878.8s] Sachs real personal consumption
[5881.52s] expenditure pce forecast are expected to
[5883.96s] go down we&#39;re going to find out tomorrow
[5885.32s] that&#39;s an important inflation number so
[5886.76s] we got tomorrow uh that could shake
[5888.88s] things up either up or down based on the
[5890.84s] inflation number I think my guess it
[5893.199s] probably comes close to in line and then
[5895.119s] the jobs report next Friday is a big one
[5897.56s] to watch as well equal weight index
[5899.92s] starting to outperform we covered that
[5901.56s] on one of the hits this morning uh
[5904.04s] cumulative record highs for the S&amp;P 500
[5906.96s] equal weight index what does that mean
[5909.28s] uh the unmagnify are doing what we said
[5911.92s] they would several months ago when we
[5913.239s] started pounding the table before the
[5915.4s] summer and is that mag 7 would
[5918.639s] underperform 493 would outperform that&#39;s
[5921.4s] been happening in
[5923.08s] Spades more capex more hyperscaler capex
[5926.56s] that&#39;s going to destroy their margins
[5928.76s] and um and their earnings power us share
[5931.8s] buyback authorization they keep buying
[5934.04s] uh up at the top and that&#39;s
[5935.56s] predominantly the mag 7 and they&#39;re
[5936.96s] going to get egg on their face for that
[5938.8s] it&#39;s just a matter of time this is from
[5940.639s] Brian Rich this shows like a seven year
[5944.119s] cycle up and down for the US dollar we
[5946.239s] just peaked two years ago and this
[5948.96s] implies we&#39;ve got another five or six
[5951.32s] years of weakening dollar which is
[5953.159s] emerging markets and international
[5954.84s] stocks outperform I love this this is
[5957.88s] from uh macro charts shows that uh
[5961.119s] there&#39;s only been three other times that
[5962.84s] short just got this high in China they
[5965.4s] all began monster monster rallies in
[5968.04s] Chinese equities same thing is happening
[5969.96s] now Chinese Yuan hits its strongest
[5971.96s] level against the dollar in over 16
[5973.76s] months as investors assess pboc stimulus
[5977.32s] all this stuff that we&#39;ve said for
[5978.96s] months was going to play out has played
[5981.159s] out conviction this was the second most
[5983.84s] crowded trade in the world was short
[5985.639s] China equities in September just behind
[5988.56s] long mag s and just in time to get their
[5991.639s] faces ripped off based on S&amp;P options
[5994.8s] the next two NFP prints are the main
[5996.76s] catalyst until the election so you can
[5998.599s] see here major events are at non-farm
[6002.679s] payrolls uh CPI numbers retail sales
[6006.04s] non-farm payrolls and then of course the
[6008.04s] election consumer confidence still low
[6010.119s] another reason to climb the wall of
[6011.639s] worry
[6012.679s] potentially um worrying a little bit
[6015.52s] more about jobs we talked about China we
[6017.88s] talked about the Yuan h s huge uh
[6021.48s] rolling returns we&#39;ll cover that one in
[6023.52s] the article record utilities inflows
[6026.239s] remember last fall pounding the table in
[6028.159s] October no one wanted them up 50%
[6031.28s] everyone wants some record flows into
[6033.84s] Utilities in the last week sell baby
[6036.4s] sell that&#39;s all I can tell you which
[6038.04s] tells me we&#39;re probably going to get a
[6039.36s] counter Trend bounce in yields on the
[6042.159s] tenure going up and that&#39;s actually
[6044.08s] started to happen up 10 basis points
[6046.159s] since the FED cut which was pretty uh
[6048.88s] easy to anticipate and we talked about
[6050.76s] it on the podcast Global Equity risk
[6053.48s] glove has risen from the August plunge
[6055.8s] to high neutral levels but is
[6058.36s] significantly below the extreme Euphoria
[6060.32s] seen in July which tells me there&#39;s
[6062.32s] potential room to Rum again cross
[6064.28s] currents nothing at extremes at present
[6066.92s] contrarians in China with the crowd
[6069.4s] elear forward returns for MSC China when
[6072.599s] China risk love hits Panic which has
[6075.44s] been now you&#39;ve seen it cases like 1998
[6077.96s] you get 54% UPS in the next few months
[6081.199s] uh 2005 a similar story
[6084.159s] uh Etc so the only time you got negative
[6087.04s] was in the middle of uh recessions which
[6090.04s] was the tech wreck and in the 2008 rest
[6093.639s] of the time like 2009 up 48% the first
[6096.239s] three months and then you look out a
[6098.0s] year later the indices up 60 plus perent
[6100.56s] 100% in 2005 Etc uh the stimulus will go
[6104.84s] through and then the sler let&#39;s just
[6106.76s] take a quick look uh thanks to my buddy
[6108.84s] for sending that and we&#39;ll just look at
[6111.119s] some of the big picture chart you can
[6112.56s] see the 10e yield I&#39;m waiting for a
[6114.44s] counter Trend move here maybe maybe as
[6116.599s] high as 4% I I doubt it looks a little
[6118.639s] over oversold um maybe not if you look
[6121.8s] at the daily maybe it just holds this
[6123.44s] trend line but just we&#39;ve already kind
[6125.599s] of got the counter Trend move that we
[6127.28s] that I talked about a couple of weeks
[6128.56s] ago but uh we&#39;ll keep an eye on that S&amp;P
[6132.92s] breaking out of a cup and handle maybe
[6134.599s] it goes back and retests at 5655 5651
[6138.8s] before resuming the uptrend maybe it
[6140.92s] keeps going we&#39;ll see the pain trade
[6143.36s] seems like a grind sideways copper is
[6145.159s] recovering with China H sang broke out
[6148.639s] uh now it&#39;s testing that I think it
[6150.159s] broke through that in the LA today and
[6153.28s] uh equal weight Industrials breaking out
[6156.119s] materials breaking out all the stuff
[6157.84s] that people didn&#39;t want uh here is from
[6160.76s] Cox Automotive now you know remember the
[6164.119s] we had that weak month when that they
[6166.0s] had that computer software train wreck
[6168.92s] in June and people took the SAR down
[6171.8s] from 15 157 or 158 down to
[6177.52s] 151 um now it&#39;s back up to 157 and that
[6181.4s] was updated yesterday so that&#39;s like
[6186.159s] a conservative thing if what I think can
[6190.599s] happen
[6191.76s] happens uh maybe we wind up with 16 and
[6194.599s] remember every 200,000 cars is like $3
[6198.679s] of earnings once you get above like 158
[6202.0s] for Cooper standards so you get $3 of
[6204.639s] earnings you got a 30 to $50 stock and
[6208.119s] um you know look who knows what you got
[6210.719s] but historically they trade between a 10
[6213.159s] to 20 times multiple when they&#39;re
[6214.56s] earning money Chinese you want okay we
[6217.36s] covered that on to the next China gives

[6617.28s] updates every week we like to cover one
[6618.96s] to two companies we own and or have
[6620.84s] discussed in previous podcast videoast
[6622.92s] we&#39;re going to do Comcast this is a
[6624.84s] natural gas overlaid with Comack um
[6628.92s] stock and as you can see like 2001
[6633.159s] period natural gas or 20 yeah 2001 to
[6636.92s] 2002 it was natural gas was very low
[6640.239s] spiked up retested before a huge secular
[6643.84s] Rally from 2002 to 2007
[6648.4s] again and the stock during that time
[6651.36s] went from
[6654.96s] about looks like about $10 to
[6658.239s] $399 over the
[6660.56s] next seven next five years I don&#39;t know
[6664.48s] that it&#39;ll go that much there&#39;s a lot
[6665.8s] more stock NOW
[6668.84s] however um if you look at proved
[6671.96s] reserves the market cap of the stock is
[6674.52s] about 3.2 billion the Enterprise Value
[6676.88s] is about five or six the proved reserves
[6679.52s] are worth about the same as the
[6681.0s] Enterprise Value the unproved reserves
[6684.04s] are worth another three times the market
[6686.52s] cap so you
[6688.28s] know basically you&#39;re getting you&#39;re
[6691.76s] paying for the approved Reserves at $10
[6694.92s] or $11 a share and you&#39;re getting
[6698.159s] another $30 worth of value that&#39;s not
[6701.28s] accounted for in the price of the stock
[6703.079s] because they it&#39;s not reported in the
[6704.96s] SEC
[6706.36s] pv10 uh so you know I think on the
[6708.88s] conservative side over time you probably
[6710.76s] have a 3540 stock
[6713.079s] uh over the next few years and um and
[6715.84s] just as things overshoot on the downside
[6718.079s] in despondency it&#39;ll probably overshoot
[6719.8s] on the upside in youforia which probably
[6721.44s] says 30 uh 50 70 or more and you got a
[6725.119s] $10 stock so you know uh and I got a
[6728.239s] good partner in this Jerry Jones keeps
[6730.8s] buying stock day and night he owns 71%
[6733.48s] of the equity uh the risk here is that
[6735.88s] you buy it at 11 and he buys in all the
[6738.679s] stock or does a tender at 15 or 20 and
[6741.28s] you only make 50 or 100 100% in a year
[6744.599s] um because he does an inside deal but
[6747.0s] you know I can live with
[6749.04s] that
[6750.88s] um all right we covered skew you listen
[6754.079s] to
[6754.96s] those now Alibaba
[6759.44s] update all right I didn&#39;t intend to do
[6761.719s] an update on Alibaba this week as we
[6763.36s] just did a comprehensive one in August
[6764.96s] you can see what we said in August at
[6766.32s] this link here or go to hedge fund
[6768.44s] tips.com and type in the search bar
[6770.76s] bobalicious stock market and censorate
[6772.96s] results fiscal stimulus this week so far
[6776.8s] okay we covered all that they did the
[6778.199s] monetary using the mortgage cuts the
[6779.88s] property down payments the handouts Etc
[6782.679s] now Baba&#39;s been trading between $65 to
[6784.88s] $80 most of the year now up 50% that&#39;s
[6787.599s] when it was $95 yesterday now it&#39;s 105
[6790.84s] uh off the lows and 95 and just getting
[6793.84s] started with G now serious about
[6796.079s] stimulus to meet 5% GDP growth Target
[6798.719s] both monetary and fiscal individual cond
[6801.8s] individual company fundamentals begin to
[6804.239s] matter again remember we&#39;ve been saying
[6807.599s] look we were buying it at 2014
[6811.719s] prices 10 years later the the only
[6814.8s] difference is revenues are now up 13x
[6818.599s] per share cash flow and earnings are up
[6821.0s] 6 and a half%
[6823.36s] so revenue is up 1300% earnings and cash
[6827.119s] flow up
[6828.4s] 650 price is the same that is a
[6831.44s] generational lifetime opportunity and
[6833.639s] that even goes at $105 as much as it
[6837.719s] went for $80 and $60 a few weeks ago uh
[6842.199s] you can see here how the business
[6843.52s] continued to grow despite the
[6845.36s] despondency cash flow per share earnings
[6847.079s] per share revenues per share return on
[6849.32s] Capital return on equity and very
[6851.8s] interesting time for all these managers
[6853.199s] to get short China equities uh second
[6856.239s] most crowded traded we covered this
[6858.4s] China&#39;s stimulus May rekindle its
[6860.04s] positive impact on global m one so money
[6863.84s] supply has been in the doldrums for them
[6865.92s] and their stock market reflects it down
[6868.04s] 80% that&#39;s what happens when money
[6869.76s] supply contracts and now it&#39;s starting
[6872.239s] to recover and as that liquidity comes
[6874.679s] in you&#39;re going to see monstrous
[6876.56s] multiples for individual companies and
[6878.8s] that&#39;s how we&#39;re positioned now two
[6880.719s] things to remember regarding Alibaba
[6882.88s] number one most important part of this
[6885.52s] week&#39;s podcast ladies and Gentlemen
[6887.44s] people will doubt and hate the rally all
[6889.719s] the way up the recency bias around
[6892.84s] fake outs will have them buying
[6895.639s] short-term tops and selling short-term
[6899.079s] bottoms all the way up what does that
[6900.639s] mean they&#39;ll buy at 105 it&#39;ll pull back
[6903.48s] to 95 they&#39;ll sell 95 it&#39;ll shoot up to
[6906.4s] 120 they&#39;ll buy 120 it&#39;ll pull back to
[6909.56s] 110 they&#39;ll sell 110 it&#39;ll shoot up to
[6912.56s] 160 they&#39;ll buy 160 it&#39;ll pull back to
[6915.36s] 140 they&#39;ll sell 140 it&#39;ll go up to 200
[6918.599s] they&#39;ll be buying till the cows come
[6920.04s] home we&#39;ll start laying off some to them
[6922.48s] it&#39;ll pull back to 150 go up to 220 plus
[6925.88s] they&#39;ll buy that and over and over and
[6928.32s] over you watch mark my words this will
[6930.199s] be what happens and
[6933.4s] um and that&#39;s that when it becomes a
[6936.0s] consensus long When Baba becomes a
[6939.159s] consensus long opinion follows Trend and
[6941.0s] commentators are
[6942.8s] uniformly enthusiastic about China and
[6945.639s] Alibaba we will lighten up we are a long
[6949.239s] way from that this is in its nent stages
[6953.239s] in my view when you think about quote
[6956.84s] this time is different on every pullback
[6959.52s] pull up this chart we posted in August
[6961.719s] and sit on your hands or go for a long
[6964.76s] long walk opinion not advice C terms
[6970.599s] um now onto the shorter term Market
[6973.28s] again we&#39;re not yet at an extreme with
[6975.119s] fear and greed we&#39;re getting
[6976.719s] closer uh same thing with National
[6978.8s] Association of active investment
[6980.079s] managers we are opening next
[6982.96s] uh we are going to be opening soon for
[6984.679s] our Q3 opening we&#39;ve been closed since
[6987.28s] July for the smaller accounts the 1 to 5
[6989.32s] million and the 5 to 10 can come in
[6992.079s] anytime at Open Enrollment bespoke
[6995.079s] service at their Leisure so we&#39;re
[6996.88s] excited to do that we&#39;ll keep it open
[6998.44s] for a week or two so if you&#39;re
[7000.48s] interested you can get in Q so you&#39;ll be
[7002.52s] the first callbacks when we go live uh
[7006.76s] early Q3 earnings exploration production
[7010.159s] sector top 30 weights in the last 60
[7012.32s] days revised down 8.5% and 11% so um
[7018.0s] this may be skewed by one or two
[7020.199s] companies but uh there will be some
[7022.719s] opportunity in this pile but that&#39;s a
[7024.56s] that&#39;s a downward Vision Industrials
[7026.599s] pretty much flat down 21 basis points
[7029.36s] for next year it&#39;s probably related to
[7031.04s] one company so keeping an eye on all of
[7033.28s] that
[7035.4s] and
[7038.28s] now oh very exciting podcast is over now

[7103.56s] even if the earnings power shows great
[7105.36s] strength being in the forecast usually
[7108.719s] not
[7119.159s] um Jean D oh this is this is a train
[7122.56s] wreck I do
[7124.4s] not I wouldn&#39;t touch this with a 10 foot
[7126.8s] pole this looks like a
[7130.0s] promote What&#39;s this called w g
[7135.04s] s Gene doctor this is one where you got
[7138.52s] to be um no stradamus and predict the
[7141.0s] future what technologies are going to
[7142.679s] work and
[7145.719s] uh I mean yeah there&#39;s still NE cash
[7148.36s] flow negative they&#39;re working their way
[7149.679s] their revenues are bumpy because it&#39;s
[7151.28s] all a promote about they&#39;re going to get
[7153.36s] something approved and it&#39;s going to
[7154.639s] change the world and sometimes it does
[7156.84s] but 999 out of a thousand it doesn&#39;t
[7160.159s] genomics related diagnostic I I have no
[7163.04s] expertise and no edge here they&#39;re in
[7164.8s] Stanford I could go visit them but
[7167.36s] uh uh not for me I mean they&#39;re going to
[7169.8s] just tell me that it&#39;s great and I know
[7171.92s] nothing about it and I&#39;m G to take a
[7173.599s] pass so
[7175.719s] um yeah pass on that for
[7180.56s] me

[7197.56s] going to go bankrupt AI will use I don&#39;t
[7200.04s] like it that textbook business it used
[7201.719s] to be a great business it might be a
[7203.84s] cigar butt and get one more puff out of
[7205.679s] it but uh I think this thing was one of
[7208.88s] these momo stocks that&#39;s just a train
[7210.76s] wreck not for me uh even if you get a
[7213.28s] deadcat bounce here you could probably
[7215.159s] get a deadcat bounce to 10 but why I&#39;m
[7217.32s] not I&#39;m not going to play that gamble
[7219.199s] Tim D thoughts on Celsius Holding stock
[7222.04s] down 70% uh revenues are expected to
[7224.719s] grow International expansion on the way
[7226.679s] I&#39;ve been looking at this one haven&#39;t
[7228.32s] done anything with it yet they&#39;re mired
[7230.04s] in a
[7230.88s] lawsuit um I might be interested but not
[7234.159s] yet so leave it at that and happy to
[7237.159s] miss it super happy to miss it um
[7241.199s] Darnell in Florida can you look at
[7244.8s] semar uh they&#39;re buying Bitcoin with
[7248.719s] cash flow to put on balance sheet in
[7250.52s] place of buying back shares yeah uh I&#39;m
[7253.04s] just not even going to look at that
[7255.92s] cumana that because I got to make bets
[7257.92s] on two things three things I got to make
[7259.599s] a bet on management I got to make a bet
[7261.239s] on bitcoin and I got to make a bet on
[7263.28s] whatever silly promote business that
[7265.199s] they&#39;re talking about and I&#39;m not
[7266.8s] interested human pretty beaten down uh
[7269.96s] this is from Paul Falcone uh looking at
[7272.84s] it very interesting uh I think it&#39;s
[7275.44s] probably actionable I&#39;m not going to
[7276.639s] spend a lot of time going through it
[7278.0s] because I&#39;ve briefly looked at it so I
[7280.36s] would say definitely worth exploring and
[7283.48s] doing the work on Paul Alex
[7286.36s] Ward love your show from the UK
[7288.36s] regularly stay up to 1 a.m. to listen
[7290.84s] what are your thoughts on reverse merger
[7292.199s] of K brands in Innovation group and
[7296.8s] Delta uh no interest in that I don&#39;t
[7299.52s] like reverse mergers and
[7303.159s] um I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m G to
[7306.159s] pass uh next Nate Kelsey thoughts on
[7310.8s] Leslie
[7312.599s] yeah this is the pool I I I would
[7315.32s] probably go for pool Corp so these
[7318.48s] things were huge when everyone was
[7319.92s] buying pools now they&#39;ve both both
[7321.639s] gotten
[7322.599s] smacked
[7326.04s] um I think I&#39;d wait for pool Corp to
[7330.119s] show signs of turning around just do the
[7332.079s] higher quality one Leslie&#39;s a promote
[7334.36s] you could double or triple your money
[7335.88s] but you could also go BK if they don&#39;t
[7338.36s] figure it out um Matt mer C
[7344.88s] GCT uh does being part of the Russell
[7347.199s] 2000 mean anything
[7349.679s] no uh better than not being part of it I
[7352.8s] guess gct&#39;s already been a 10 bagger and
[7355.88s] it&#39;s pulling off I I let me take a quick
[7361.28s] look gigal Cloud technology I have no
[7365.92s] idea description what do they do end to
[7369.28s] end BC Commerce e-commerce Solutions a
[7371.599s] bunch of gobbly I don&#39;t know what that
[7373.88s] means let&#39;s take a look at the
[7384.92s] financials all right so the free cash
[7386.92s] flows turning
[7388.44s] up
[7390.719s] um revenues are growing so they must
[7392.92s] have done an acquisition because they
[7394.4s] have this
[7396.04s] um big turn up three balance sheet looks
[7399.4s] okay
[7403.92s] uh not my type of business but um
[7407.719s] probably worth fundamentals look okay
[7411.32s] worth doing more work but I&#39;m I&#39;m pretty
[7413.76s] darn sure after I dig into it for an
[7415.639s] hour it&#39;s going to be a
[7417.079s] no um I know that you&#39;re not a fan of
[7420.0s] Walgreens would you put CVS in the same
[7421.8s] boat they have a little different
[7423.679s] business I would just stay away from
[7425.04s] both Life Is Life is hard enough just
[7427.48s] don&#39;t complicate life with stuff like
[7429.159s] that thoughts on Corning that&#39;s from
[7431.84s] from uh Brian
[7433.599s] David
[7436.4s] GW not yet I looked at this
[7441.239s] one uh not for me move
[7445.119s] on uh Jason says do you think Intel
[7449.8s] would and should take the merger of
[7451.639s] Qualcomm I would buy Qualcomm discreetly
[7454.079s] so if they merge I wouldn&#39;t lose sleep
[7455.8s] I&#39;d keep the stock I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
[7457.559s] going to happen I don&#39;t think they need
[7458.76s] them I don&#39;t think they really need
[7459.88s] anyone other than the government
[7461.239s] spending them the money they&#39;ve already
[7462.92s] committed and they&#39;ll be fine they&#39;re
[7464.119s] turning the corner and this is when
[7465.76s] everyone&#39;s panicking right when the four
[7467.679s] nodes in five nodes in four years is
[7469.52s] done and they got lunar Lake and they
[7471.119s] got 18a and they&#39;ve got gouty 3 and they
[7473.76s] got the whole thing so now they just
[7475.44s] need to cut off the forget the European
[7477.4s] Factories do the US factories get the US
[7479.84s] money crank it out and if you got a
[7482.76s] merge with them great do it I like both
[7485.199s] stocks so uh I&#39;m perfectly fine with it
[7488.159s] I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll happen though I
[7489.76s] think Ginger&#39;s worked too hard to get to
[7491.32s] where he is is I think he knows he&#39;s at
[7492.92s] the inflection point and uh who needs it
[7496.76s] um if you had to pick one of your
[7499.679s] holding makes you most excited Christmas
[7501.36s] morning think as a five bagger okay so
[7503.84s] number one um the ones that have the
[7506.84s] highest upside potential have the most
[7508.4s] amount of risk I would warn you guys on
[7510.719s] two things number one is getting too
[7513.32s] excited about one stock we always have 8
[7516.0s] to 12 companies and we&#39;re running a very
[7517.8s] concentrated portfolio for very
[7520.639s] sophisticated Ultra High net worth
[7522.48s] investors that can handle
[7524.52s] short-term Vol volatility for long-term
[7526.92s] outsize
[7528.36s] rewards um
[7531.239s] so
[7533.96s] um so I&#39;m not going to answer that but
[7536.159s] if you&#39;ve been listening long enough you
[7537.44s] know which company we have a huge
[7538.719s] position in that has the most multiple
[7540.8s] upside and um and the second thing is
[7545.159s] now that everything&#39;s working all at
[7547.079s] once uh everyone&#39;s going to get all
[7549.32s] excited and the next company I talk
[7552.079s] about they&#39;re going to put so much money
[7553.88s] in because they&#39;re getting in at the
[7555.079s] beginning versus after they&#39;ve already
[7556.599s] doubled and tripled and that&#39;s a huge
[7558.76s] mistake you need number one to do your
[7561.599s] own work number two talk to your own
[7563.32s] financial advisor uh or hire you know uh
[7567.84s] someone if you&#39;re qualified uh uh and
[7571.52s] three you need to be Diversified and not
[7574.0s] all in um uh and do your own homework
[7578.679s] before you do anything because it&#39;s the
[7581.28s] win fallacy when you have a hot hand to
[7584.4s] then you know think you&#39;re invincible
[7586.599s] and then the next one take double the
[7588.4s] risk uh you have to have the discipline
[7590.88s] to constantly be Diversified constantly
[7593.96s] accept humility and know that as long as
[7597.0s] your framework is sound you don&#39;t
[7599.4s] control which one is going to double in
[7601.36s] six months and which one&#39;s going to take
[7603.239s] six years uh although thank God they
[7606.44s] don&#39;t take that long although sometimes
[7608.04s] it feels like it uh but you you won&#39;t
[7610.48s] know which ones happen faster than you
[7612.36s] expect and which ones take a little
[7614.199s] longer than you expect but in aggregate
[7616.0s] if your framework is sound you can you
[7618.44s] can really do exceptionally well in the
[7620.559s] business so with that I&#39;ll leave it
[7622.599s] there and I think let me just make sure
[7626.0s] I&#39;m not missing anyone&#39;s questions
[7631.44s] here elf no thank
[7638.159s] you anyone else no
[7643.4s] oh gen pack I like it I&#39;ve looked at it
[7646.04s] I did nothing it&#39;s kind of getting away
[7647.8s] from me only thing that worried me a
[7650.0s] little bit about it I was looking at it
[7651.719s] in the low 30s I didn&#39;t do anything it&#39;s
[7654.159s] like a Consulting business so it&#39;s not
[7656.8s] as predictable as the businesses I like
[7658.84s] but U I did like it I wouldn&#39;t buy it up
[7661.679s] here if it pulls back down to the low
[7663.48s] 30s I may take a look at there&#39;s a spot
[7665.52s] in the portfolio but um I already own
[7668.88s] what I like so but nice find I agree
[7671.92s] with you
[7678.679s] um Kyle don&#39;t worry about the
[7680.679s] correlation to Yuan and HSI just worry
[7683.04s] about the fundamentals of the business
[7684.559s] and if you own a good business you just
[7686.04s] sit on your hands and let it realize
[7689.36s] intrinsic value and then hit Euphoria
[7692.119s] and that&#39;s when you lay it
[7693.92s] off um okay I think we&#39;re done with that
[7699.44s] said we&#39;ll see you next week same time
[7700.92s] same place in the meantime make it a
[7703.0s] great one by for now
