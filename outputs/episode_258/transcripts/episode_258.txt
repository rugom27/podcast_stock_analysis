thanks to Christian dagger and Preston misel for that so tune in on Tuesday morning to Varan company first thing here we&#39;ll do the media want to thank Jeff Cohen and Christen Scher for having me on the New York Stock Exchange this morning uh responding to the China stimulus Etc we&#39;re going to listen in here what a celebration here at the New York Stock Exchange bkv a natural gas producer uh opening its shares on the market to debut it&#39;s going to be IPO in we haven&#39;t seen that stock open just yet uh but perhaps in just a bit of time after this opening bell join me now to talk about what we see in the overall Market is Thomas Hayes he&#39;s a chair and managing member of great Hill Capital uh Thomas always great to have you with me and the Market&#39;s so in Focus today especially after some of these stimulus measures out of China overnight what can you tell us this is enormous news this is a regime change this is a game changer the Chinese government finally released the stimulus bazooka that everyone has been waiting for and if you look at it now it the green light is on so you you&#39;ve got the US trading at 22 23 times uh for good growth but in China the growth is now going to be start recovering and you&#39;re trading at 8 10 times for some of the biggest companies in the in the world like Alibaba the number one cloud provider in Asia like 10 cent like so many so the market is very excited because if growth comes back in China which it will they said we&#39;re going to do whatever it takes this is a big deal that&#39;s going to be good for all the developed markets as well and certainly we see US Stocks opening higher today still within those record high territories the NASDAQ leading the way the NASDAQ Composite that is tech stocks and certainly solid economic data what we saw overnight in China with these stimulus measures do you foresee an impact on US Stocks I do in the long term okay so this stimulus you&#39;re going to start to see growth come back in China that&#39;s going to help us companies if you recall companies like Nike have been down because of China worries Este La has been down because of China&#39;s worries Starbucks has been down because of China China worries so all these companies are going to benefit as that growth comes back they&#39;re issuing $286 billion of bonds for fiscal stimulus everyone said well the monetary stimulus is great we need fiscal we need fiscal they said it&#39;s coming and and it will do as much as it takes so all the multinationals are going to be big beneficiaries of this stimulus over overnight we&#39;re pretty excited about it well in terms of excitement we see Executives from bkv this company set to IPO today here at the New York Stock Exchange signing the wall after that celebratory opening bell Podium we&#39;ll be speaking with those Executives including the CEO momentarily I&#39;d love to get your take uh Thomas as an investor with a wide aperture as to what you make of the natural gas space I love it as you know Kristen for many years we&#39;ve talked I&#39;m a contrarian I like to buy what&#39;s out of favor what&#39;s high quality value out of favor and I think natural gas right now is an opportunity of a lifetime uh it&#39;s trading in in in the doldrums no one wants it and the demand for energy is going up and it&#39;s the cleanest energy that we have plentiful in plentiful sources in the United States unlimited amounts so companies like this going public we own a company called Comstock resources which Jerry Jones owns 71% of the equity he&#39;s the owner of the Dallas Cowboys so I think they&#39;re going to do well I think comstock&#39;s going to do well we&#39;ve got a little bit of range resources that we&#39;ve owned for for sometime that&#39;s up quite a bit so this is the time to be buying China this is the time to be buying natural gas and I think their timing is perfect okay great well I&#39;m sure the executive might want to talk to you Thomas uh after this uh Market open here a strong Market open that we see at the stock exchange as we look to round out the third quarter September we see decent gains record highs in V sentiment seems to be strong heading into the fourth quarter we&#39;ll have a new Factor like the election what&#39;s the state of play right now for us markets I think the FED with the front-loaded rate cut last week cemented what we&#39;ve been calling for a regime change for many months so we&#39;re going to have a shift you have to be selective you can&#39;t just Chase those magnificent 7 anymore UNM magnificent 7 UNM magnificent 493 is going to outperform magnificent 7 why because their earnings growth is accelerating while magnificent 7 earnings growth is decelerating small caps outperform large caps in the first 12 months after a Fed cut by 11% so you want to be small caps value outperforms growth in the first 6 months after the first fed cut so you want to have some value exposure everyone&#39;s crowded into defensives they&#39;ve been crowding into Staples and utilities we think discretionary is going to outperform so the Nikes are going to come back the lulus are going to come back the VF Corps are going to come back and and last but not least actually most important Emerging Markets is going to outperform developed markets that&#39;s in part due to a weaker dollar the dollar is going to Trend lower in coming months and years that help helps Emerging Markets the stimulus in China helps Emerging Markets so all the places that have been left for dead now it&#39;s Christmas time it&#39;s opportunity to go shopping so we&#39;re pretty excited okay opportunity to go shopping I always like that reference here Thomas uh so when it comes to overall conditions obviously that is key in the IPO Market hopefully we&#39;ll see more of these International companies going public here at the Stock Exchange what else do our viewers need to know especially as they Factor the election into their equation yeah I think this is a big thing cuz historically since 1955 you tend to get a lot of volatility in October ahead of the election so US Stocks have run up a little B little bit particularly the Magnificent 7 which is such a heavy weight so you have to be careful you have to be selective if you&#39;re on margin you might want to come off a margin don&#39;t be too aggressive but we&#39;re staying fully invested we&#39;ll RI out any bumps and then I think after the election once you get that certainty doesn&#39;t really matter as much who&#39;s elected as president so long as you have gridlock not one party in the Senate house and president as long as it&#39;s mixed we&#39;re going to get a urine rally after that so be a little careful uh the option skew which is the cost to ensure one and two standard deviation Corrections just hit a 10 10year record which doesn&#39;t mean you automatically get a correction but it just means be be on alert for a little bit of volatility in October uh in case it shows up so off a margin stay invested ride through the bumps and I think uh by year end you&#39;re going to be smiling smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways so uh Thomas Hayes with great Hill Capital Thomas thanks so much for joining great to get your take this morning and let&#39;s take a and we&#39;re back then straight to Yahoo to be on with Brad Smith thanks to n Saleem and Justin Oliver as well for having me on more color on our current Outlook to the markets and your Investment Portfolio the S&amp;P 500 hitting another intraday record high today after a couple data points signal that the economy is still on solid footing but our next guest thinks that investors might want to prepare for a little bit of volatility ahead to discuss we&#39;ve got Thomas Hayes who is the great Hill Capital LLC chairman and managing member here great to have you here in studio with us Tom great to be with you so let&#39;s discuss this I mean what type of volatility profile should people still be kind of keeping their portfolios ready for to weather as well yeah Brad I think we had a regime change got locked in last week with the front-loaded 50 basis point cut and what that lies is that the heaviest weights of the S&amp;P 500 the Magnificent 7 I think they&#39;re going to be a little bit choppy U moving here I think moving forward history suggests that the unmagnify will outperform the Magnificent 7 that&#39;s because their earnings growth is accelerating while the Magnificent 7 is decelerating uh history also suggests after the First Rate cut small caps will outperform large caps by over 11% in the first 12 months uh so that&#39;s that&#39;s a big deal value outperforms growth in the for 6 months after the first cut and uh as you probably noticed everyone has been crowding into defensives ahead of the FED cut so I think uh you&#39;re going to see consumer discretionary start to outperform Staples everyone&#39;s crowded into Staples and utilities I think that trade is up and finally this is the topic dour today uh Emerging Markets will start to outperform developed markets after 10 years of not happening uh the Chinese government overnight launched the Bazooka everyone said oh the monetary cuts are pretty good but we need fiscal well they&#39;re issuing 286 billion dollar of bonds they&#39;re giving out money things are happening and the green light is on that&#39;s going to help not only Emerging Markets it&#39;s going to help multinationals like Nike that&#39;s been down Lululemon that&#39;s been down Starbucks that&#39;s been down on China F yeah a huge uh stimulus effort that they&#39;re putting forward here and having more International uh impact here you know it&#39;s it&#39;s been interesting to get some perspectives on what quality looks like what the characteristics of quality investment and people who are trying to put quality into their portfolio what that looks like what are some of those characteristics from your perspective as well even as you think about the defensive plays that people can make or how you can make sure that your portfolio is able to weather any type of volatility right now yeah so the you started with the kind of concerns about a little bit of choppiness into October what what made me a little bit on alert is the fact that skew which is the cost or the implied volatility the cost to ensure one to two standard deviation Corrections think about 10% plus Corrections has actually Skyrocket skyrocketed to a decade high that doesn&#39;t guarantee that you&#39;re going to have a correction right away it just says it&#39;s time to be on alert on alert because the smart money is taken out a lot of insurance that differs from the vix which measures the cost of the at the money uh uh premium or insurance so I think um if you&#39;re on margin you want to be off margin we&#39;re fully invested we&#39;re going to stay fully invested write out any bumps in October uh after the election clears provided it&#39;s a gridlock outcome regardless of who becomes president uh I think we get a year-end rally so you don&#39;t want to be stopping and starting I just think it&#39;s uh time to be a little alert particularly if you&#39;re a passive investor and you&#39;re overweight the Magnificent 7 even if you don&#39;t know it for it seems like months now investors have had to hear about the broadening win the Magnificent 7 and the successes seen in the Magnificent 7 it would brought out to broaden out to other earnings growth or earnings growth of other the other 493 companies as well are we are we starting to see that and and if so is it sustainable as we get into the back half of this year and earnings growth regardless of the macroeconomic backdrop comes into Focus we are seeing it because you&#39;re seeing the equal weight index outperform the cap weighted of late uh and this was an inflection quarter where the UNM magnificent 493 as you referenced broadening uh just inflected and started to accelerate earnings growth they had negative earnings growth in the second quarter so not only is it beginning it&#39;s going to accelerate uh small cap earnings growth 7% this year 37% next year so the game is on it&#39;s exciting it&#39;s a stock Pickers market and I&#39;ll tell you the the voodoo of China there&#39;s some high quality companies and to your point how do you define quality is price is what you pay value what you get so we want to see a meaningful return on invested Capital that means the debt and Equity that the company&#39;s taken in what kind of return are they getting when they invest we like double digits low double digits mid double digits so there are companies over there and we like to buy things that are out of favor as you know we&#39;ve talked for many years uh so uh in the US our best tech companies are trading at 23 25 times in China their best companies are trading at eight or 10 times and they&#39;ve got a ton of cash on their balance sheet and with this stimulus their econom is going to re accelerate and there&#39;s going to be huge opportunities not just for us multinationals that are trading down because of China but for actually some of the highest quality companies in China that have been left for dead it&#39;s really interesting Tom always a pleasure to grab some of your insights thanks so much for joining us in the studio here thanks for having me Brad absolutely Tom Hayes great Hill Capital chairman and managing member and we&#39;re back and I think among the most important 10 or 15 minutes of TV in 2024 was David teer uh who also has Alibaba as his number one position in his portfolio and uh he talked about breaking his position limits because he wanted to get even more if we get a pullback and um and uh look what I could you know let let me put it this way this is this has definitely been a a great few uh weeks for sure uh but I would also say just as those of you whove been with me know that I was not despondent when it was at $59 and we were buying it hand over fist and $65 uh and all of that uh I&#39;m not euphoric at $15 I think we&#39;re just getting started so we&#39;ll push higher we&#39;ll have a pullback to shake out all the hot money that doesn&#39;t believe in it and know what they own uh and then we&#39;ll push even higher and it&#39;ll be hated the whole way up but listen in to David teer this is you know obviously been greatly influenced by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger and I&#39;d say the third person that&#39;s been very important in how I think and how I&#39;ve assembled my own framework and added my own inputs over the years has been David teer Legend you know it&#39;s funny I posted this on Twitter and all the responses were from people saying why would you trust them to pick stocks when he can&#39;t even pick a quarterback because he owns the Nashville Predators or one of the teams and uh you I I literally just have no response to that you know it&#39;s like uh so listening to the legend the master David terer here when we hear the said okay they go 50 they may go more we think oh mortgage rates in this country oh we think business uh loans in this country start or you know we think interests on the N you immediately thought China and and currency uh differences around the world so that was more important to you because the undervaluation is you you know listen you can look at your chart and look at a chart of Baba on your on your screen right there whatever stock you like in China they are even with the recent moves are like on a flatline low compared to where they have been in the past and you&#39;re sitting there with single multile um pees with double digit growth rates for the big stocks that trade over here that&#39;s kind of versus what you know the you your 20 plus on the S&amp;P right okay and then you have so the question was was China going to do the things that you want them to do okay are they going to do the easing measures they that you want them to do so yeah they came the other day and uh what&#39;s his name pan pan gong Chen and I apologize because I can&#39;t even speak English well you know he came out and he was like jovial it&#39;s like whoa jovial saying we&#39;re going to cut and we&#39;re going to and we&#39;ll give you more and he said we&#39;ll do more and more if needed now the Chinese to say we&#39;ll do more and more if needed they don&#39;t say that because it&#39;s not been healthy to say those sort of things in China but they said that the other night and I listened very carefully what government officials say so I took it that they did a lot they exceeded expectations and he promised to do more and more and more okay and that&#39;s very strange language especially for you know any Central Banker but especially over there so that was the first thing that happened and last night um you know they we heard that they were going to have some kind of meaning but they kind of blew away expectations on the physical stimulus you know that they were going to do now physical stimulus if you look at your charts if you like charts because you used to be a broker and that was a good way to do things fast um what can happen around the world when they do that that&#39;s what you have to ask yourself now so now you have the Fed so just a backdrop again the fed&#39;s easying you know you have a few more easings coming the Japanese they don&#39;t know what they want to do right now but it doesn&#39;t matter what people think they&#39;re going to be forced into things and I can talk about that in a second um the Europeans are lowering rates and now the Chinese are lowering rates okay and they&#39;re going to be they&#39;re aggressive in how they&#39;re going to do it and they they also believe this or not swap facilities to buy stocks want encouraging buyback of stocks encouraging BuyBacks right of stocks okay this is China all right this is stock BuyBacks not only encouraging it lending you money to do it and they&#39;re giving money like tal money where you can put money out and you have no losses if you want to do it you have you know how that thing works you have only the money you put up and you you can don&#39;t lose money that&#39;s a great deal for me I want to be over there and borrow for some of this stuff so what about the relationship between the United States and China how the Chinese government may or may not feel about American investors but maybe more importantly how the American government feels about us investors investing in China too what&#39;s the risk how do you I mean that would be a risk and that&#39;s why you have limits on how much you would invest however don&#39;t have the other thing I thought you were going to ask is about tariffs and stuff like that I do not care yeah this is internal stimulus in the physical stimulus they did last night they&#39;re going to encourage consumptions directly saying it so they&#39;re really doing all the things that people have asked them to do over these years so what will happen on World Markets so now you have you want to talk with the United States most of your viewers are here in the United States or Europe or Japan start you started on Japan okay so we can go we can go around the world obviously this is incredibly good for very undervalued Chinese equities okay in especially when the government&#39;s encouraging the BuyBacks BuyBacks BuyBacks and for you to take risk to buy stock take a loan out buy stock you can&#39;t lose money on your loan great deal for me I would you know if you want to be Chinese just s in a Chinese name no sorry um anyway sorry um so you have you know so United States so that&#39;s so you have this world and so I&#39;m trying to figure the United States so it&#39;s not really your first plot to to go to invest right now because you would say China first Asia second right Asia at large second okay Japan then Japan you know Korea those markets also actually a Asia and Europe and Europe before Japan and I&#39;ll tell and I will tell you why the problem with you know you have to be careful a little bit about Japan although I think it&#39;s still you want to be in the equity markets if you look what happens if China runs and they get the economy going and you get the animal spirits going what happens China chines throw a lot of money in their economy who&#39;s one of the biggest beneficiaries in their own economy is Japan and Japan if if they get if they start running faster they I don&#39;t care what this election is and they have they&#39;re worried about this candidate and that candidate some candidates want to might want to go to abenomics and I don&#39;t care they don&#39;t even understand it yet this just happened last night the market doesn&#39;t understand it yet what&#39;s going to happen Japan&#39;s going to run too fast if they really stimulate there and when Japan runs too fast they&#39;re going to have to raise rates and when they raise rates the Yen&#39;s going to appreciate if the Yen appreciates then you have to to be careful about the stock market not this the stock depending how it goes now the stock market in Yen terms used to still make money but how much does it move or not because of how it historically does right so you go you go around the world the US listen the problem with the US and then I can go European European the European index at 14 times multiple versus a 22 historically incredibly wide 22 here 21 22 whatever you want to say for next year so Europe yeah you look interesting we like last in Europe we&#39;re well Japan has the same sort of moldable right now and you can say we have much better stocks and much bigger tech stocks and that so the question here where you don&#39;t have necessarily a cheap market right it&#39;s not a cheap Market it probably is you know and I I I didn&#39;t listen to him I listen a little bit but what cooperman said yesterday but if you looked at it historically it&#39;s a little you know a little overvalued okay I would say that however I get concerned about one thing cuz I you know fortunately or unfortunately I was around around in the &#39;90s I was around in the &#39; 80s too but it was around the &#39;90s and um you know in that market where the where the fed you know um uh you know cut you know cut rates into y 2K you know in a good economy a relatively not a bad economy but a relatively okay economy you had that those those those you rich rich in rich in in before long-term credit rich in 97 relatively Rich richer after long-term credit and you know bubble bubble in 99 early 2000 so I don&#39;t love I&#39;m a value guy I don&#39;t love the US markets on a value standpoint but I sure as heck won&#39;t be short well because I would be nervous as heck about the the setup with Easy Money everywhere a relatively good economy you know and China just massive stimulus coming in so it makes me it would make me nervous not to be somewhat long the US now you know so that&#39;s that&#39;s how this set is you know so you have to be you can&#39;t be short the US you can&#39;t be short anything in Asia anything in Asia nothing and we&#39;re back and then on Friday I had a chance to go on with David Lynn on the David Lyn report and these videos always go viral I think got like 60 thou 65,000 views you&#39;re going to find out why it covers all of my thinking following the raid hike so we&#39;ll listen in here how should investors be positioned in a Fed easing cycle which sectors have tended to outperform in the past so what is coming up next Thomas hay is here to break down his Outlook he is a managing member of great Hill capital and the author of a great Finance um newsletter called hedge fund tips links down below uh you should check out Thomas was on the show a few months ago back in July and he told me if it&#39;s indeed true that 2% is a fantasy even for the US are you saying Thomas that the FED is likely to cut before the core PC gets down to 2% of I think it&#39;s at 2.6 now 100% I mean nothing in life is 100% I&#39;d say 99% I&#39;d say if you take that bet a thousand times 999 times you&#39;re G to be right maybe this will be the one in a thousand where you&#39;re wrong but I&#39;d take that bet over and over he got that call right so congratulations on another yet another great call that&#39;s been a you&#39;ve been on a great streak all year welcome back Tom thank you so much David uh grateful to be here so uh let&#39;s talk about um what happened this week so the Fed Cup by 50 basis points the market started rally ing uh the day after which was yesterday on Friday today on the 20th where stock markets are taking a bit of a breather from yesterday&#39;s rally I was looking at uh stats and uh let me just flip over to my screen here I was looking at the Historical performance of the S&amp;P 500 in the past Cycles when we had uh fed uh the FED cut by 50 basis points so here&#39;s the S&amp;P 500 I&#39;m going to Overlay this with the FED funds right here uh the FED cut in 2020 March 2020 uh by 50 basis points that was uh here and the S&amp;P immediately fell shortly after uh well that was because of the pandemic of course in 2008 it was similar issue actually effect cut uh right uh around uh uh here uh by 50 basis points and then that was during the financial crisis right before the lean collapse and then in 2001 same story it was right at the cusp of the tech bubble bust at the time and so the question remains whether or not we are in a similar precarious situation which necessitates a 50 basis point cut because in each of these scenarios in the past we had a basically a big decline in a subsequent 6 months after a 50 basis point cut what&#39;s your outlook here yeah I think uh you could go back one more and take a look at 1995 yeah and then you could go back to 1982 so as you as you go back uh through history and particularly that double dip there um yeah recently for sure it&#39;s had a negative impact however if you look at March of 20120 uh the market bottomed on March 23rd and and I and I happen to know that because we got quoted in March 22 saying we were in the market starting to buy stocks uh and that was kind of put me on the map and put the podcast on the map and everything else that everyone said that saw that market watch because everyone thought the world was ending and we&#39;re like no you know let&#39;s take a look at some of these companies that are Market down and uh that cut uh you had one of the biggest rallies in the shortest amount of time from April through the end of the year now um 2008 2001 yes those were were bad situations and I think that also goes for if you look at the returns of the stock market following the first cut 50 or otherwise throughout history those cuts that where there was no recession in the first 12 months versus when there was a recession in the first 12 months that the returns are completely different and and on balance no recession you&#39;re in the mid teens up on the SNP uh in the first 12 months after the first cut and those where you had the recession skewed overall returns down because when you did have the recession the returns were abysmal despite the cut like like the two instances that you just pointed out I think given where we are GDP now at 3% uh G hasn&#39;t been a perfect indicator or predictor but it&#39;s it&#39;s a it&#39;s a barometer let&#39;s put it that way uh and earnings growth expected to be about 15% next year it&#39;s very hard to get to a recession with that level of growth and considering you&#39;d need two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth to define a recession and I think what continues to fake people off usually get a recession once every four years what&#39;s got everyone sideways and why none of their models and and forecasting is working is that we&#39;ve actually had two recessions in the last four years both in 2020 and in 2022 when you had two consecutive quarters of negative GDP which they didn&#39;t formally declare a recession because they some accounting for the labor market was uh Stronger at that point but it does it is that a negative technical recession so effectively if you pulled forward uh one recession that should have happened over an eight-year period I.E one every four years and we&#39;ve had two in four years the runway looks pretty good and the runway looks good particularly because the only thing that could have destroyed it was Powell screwing up which he was close to doing everyone kind of knows in retrospect uh some of us were prospectively saying but let&#39;s say in retrospect that he should have cut over the summer when the bank of Japan was hiking and uh uh you basically had a liquidity mismatch and and I was really looking out for today with the bank of Japan I thought that was very important that the FED cut 50 basis points because while the bank of Japan was expected to hold Pat which they ultimately did if they had gone 25 and the FED had only gone 25 I think you would have seen close to a repeat of what we saw in early August when the Nik crashed 25% with 50 basis points from the FED if the bank of Japan had done 25 is what I was very curious to see how the market would absorb that the fact that they did zero uh and held Pat for the time being tells me that we kind of have some support here despite the seasonal Tendencies worst two weeks of September uh pre-election uh weakness is historically the case since 1955 uh that that may be overcome you know I I think and I&#39;ll talk about what how we&#39;ve been thinking about it this week but I think quite a few people are positioned for trouble before the election and given the fact that the market is designed to fool most of the people most of the time uh I&#39;m coming to the view that maybe it&#39;s less trouble than most people expect and the big surprise that would catch people a lot of people off off guard uh if you look at Option skew and other things where people are really expecting bad things uh would be if the market actually moves higher into the election which would go against all historical data and how people are positioned in their outlooks for the next six weeks before we continue with the interview I want to tell you about another way you can invest your Bitcoins and store them safely instead of using a traditional wallet or an exchange consider an IRA today sponsor itust capital is one such Ira that offers 35 crypto assets and

election are you saying that have a net short position um in Futures right now yeah well here&#39;s how I would look at it so on Tuesday going in with the same framework that this would be odds are you know worst two weeks of the year or the last two weeks of September historically uh in a presidential election year you get a lot of volatility in September and a flush and a lot of volatility in September and a flush in late October before the election clears we started looking for okay number one could we Harvest some cash to be able to buy the weakness potential weakness in October and there was nothing in the portfolio that we felt was exuberantly valued where we would want to get out of the p position to raise cash all the cash that we were going to raise we did in July uh when some of the mag s were were just humming along uh and late June when when Nvidia was doing their split and everyone loved it at 139 um so so not only could we not find enough good ideas to harvest cash because we didn&#39;t want to sell them at at these levels we don&#39;t think they&#39;re near fair value or fully valued but we went through you know couple thousand stocks looking for ways to hedge the portfolio I.E put on shorts uh or index Hedges and the only fat pitch shorts that we were willing to put on that made that made sense from different things we were looking at in terms of fundamental analysis in terms of technical analysis they were all defensives meaning everyone has crowded into defensives Consumer Staples utilities ahead of the Fall so right now you&#39;re so overweight defensives relative to discretionary people are positioned for bad things so the last thing you want to do is short defensives into a potential turbulent period And the fact that so many people are already in defensives and positioned for a turbulent period tells me we may not get as much turbulence as people think so I&#39;m less looking at Futures commitment of traders that I would normally look at and that&#39;s a great go-to and it&#39;s and it&#39;s uh astute that you brought that up as the first thing to look at but uh vix is still a little bit elevated here which tells me hedging premium is expensive uh so you know sometimes the worst case scenario for people that are that are high conviction on either the thing going down or going up is that the market grinds sideways into to the election that would probably cause the most pain to the most amount of people uh actually uh since you brought up yeah let&#39;s talk about sectors now uh before we get on to the central bank diverges which you brought up earlier so this is the S&amp;P again in the bar chart the purple line is the xlp so Consumer Staples um ETF it&#39;s been underperforming all year still so um is that mostly just because of the tech out performance you think Tom well Tech waiting but but look at the look at the hockey sick move you know while from August through midt yeah and this this is what I&#39;m talking about when I say people are positioning so yeah over the last three months it&#39;s just been on a tear you&#39;re right let&#39;s so up this is last three months here yeah yeah Up&#39;s up go ahead yeah it&#39;s up six% S&amp;P it&#39;s only up three so yeah so it&#39;s it&#39;s doubled the performance and that&#39;s kind of how I&#39;m thinking about and if you actually go back to to uh before the FED cut it was up eight in change right so just go back two days oh two days yeah yeah yeah you see that Peak on the red thing so it&#39;s up about um hang on let me go back oh I see what you&#39;re doing couple days here yeah right there right there yeah yeah so it&#39;s up another two so it&#39;s like up eight% so everyone was positioning for whatever what is all known which is the worst two months of the year on average is late September uh uh presidential election year since 1955 you know tend to be really really choppy and very big weakness into the end of October before the election clears and and the thing rallies so I didn&#39;t want to short defensives I didn&#39;t want to short Tech into the hole so basically we&#39;re just standing Pat fully invested low to no leverage and if we get weakness we&#39;ll find some cash to buy stuff uh and if the market Powers higher we&#39;ll take advantage which could be a real surprise if the market did push higher into election which I&#39;m not betting on but I&#39;m also no I&#39;m not also despite wanting to not betting against um that would probably surprise a lot of people and and there&#39;s a tendency the market to do that why did you bring up the election several times as a turning point I mean what fundamental difference would there be for the markets if let&#39;s say we had a Harris versus a trump win zero provided that we get a gridlock outcome so if Harris were to win it&#39;s probable that the Republicans the senate in which case none of the market bad things can happen I.E unreal taxing unrealized capital gains which is the most ridiculous thing ever if you want uh an economy to flourish I mean you would destroy all incentive for people to invest in businesses uh it&#39;s worrisome that someone would have advisors that would even Broach such an idea because it would be so devastating and they&#39;re saying well it&#39;s only for hundred million dollar people you just don&#39;t yeah I.E the people that create all the jobs would be disincentivized to grow companies because you can&#39;t keep reinvesting if you&#39;re taxed before you realize the gain it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s mindboggling leaving that aside yeah and Trump&#39;s not full of good ideas either okay he&#39;s got a lot of good ideas as far as business friendly and uh I I&#39;m making no judgments about social friendlies or personalities or any of that um he&#39;s more business he&#39;s more anti-regulation so in theory the market should like that more I will tell you that if the repu Republicans won the presidency the Senate and the house that&#39;s not good historically for the stock market no matter what people think uh just as if the Democrats won the presidency the Senate and the house is not good for the stock market the best case scenario whether Trump or Harris wins is that the other party controls either the senate or the house or both and the name of the game is the market prefers if politicians can do very little the less politicians can do the Better Business will do the better markets will do over time I actually I spoke to somebody who uh is in the no on on the um unrealized capital gains uh proposal which uh by the way Congress has not approved or it probably un likely going to approve but uh but according to our calculations only about 10,000 individuals in the US would be affected uh entities like hedge funds like yourselves would would not we&#39;re not going to tax unrealized gains from uh llps and black rock or or any of that sort so perhaps it&#39;s not that big a deal even if it were to be implemented but that aside wait wait let me just let me let me stop there because it&#39;s such an important like I can&#39;t overemphasize how bad an idea this is like if I was going to write a book called How to cause a Great Depression chapter one would be entitled start taxing unrealized capital gains and you say it&#39;s only 10,000 people how many public companies are there that matter 2,000 that matter 6,000 total so let&#39;s just say the ones that really matter to people&#39;s uh 401ks retirements pensions are 500 companies let&#39;s just be simplistic so those 10,000 people control a material amount of those 500 companies and if they are forced liquid Liquidators with no ready buyers on the other side because who would be the ready buyers people who would also get hit by the unrealized TA capital gains and have no incentive to create that that market liquidity uh you&#39;re G to have hundreds of thousands to tens of millions of jobs destroyed because you you are old enough to have lived through what a liquidity uh dir of liquidity looks like in the great financial crisis that would be Amateur hour compared to what would happen if this was ever implemented well let me just ask you suppose it were to affect your fund suppose legislation were to be hypothetically uh implemented such that your fund would be taxed on an unrealized capital gains basis would you move offshore would you would you would you just leave the US uh I&#39;d probably retire and go play golf okay all right okay that settles that yeah um this aside though so taking the unrealized capital gains uh discussion aside Harris wants to raise top capital gains tax to 28% um what okay that look that I can live with we&#39;ve been to that movie before we&#39;ve been as high as 35% in the short term it would be bad for earnings so the market would would uh what was the word that Powell used the other day realign or re re uh what was the magic word he used realign or readjust to reconfigure anyway we could deal with that we&#39;ve dealt with 35% capital gains not no bueno but not a a life Ender it would not destroy the economy taxing unrealized capital gains would unequivocally do that even if it was limited to 10,000 people that control 80% of the stock okay so Capital higher cap higher higher corporate taxes is okay even though we may see lower margins and uh maybe slower spending capex yeah B idea but but tolerable all right uh on the Trump side I remember in well throughout 2016 to 2020 every time he announced new tariffs the markets just threw a hissy fit so I&#39;m guessing Capital markets don&#39;t like tariffs um have things changed now that we&#39;re more adjusted we&#39;ve had eight years of tariffs basically and sanctions another less than ideal solution for a complex problem so let me be fair and uh criticize both sides I guess is the answer uh and by the way both sides have some ideas that are sensible and I don&#39;t want to make this a political talk we&#39;re trying to keep it to markets tariffs Trump has historic Trump is a pragmatist by Nature okay so he&#39;s not an idealist and and and the ideologues are the most dangerous type of politicians because they&#39;re making decisions on the basis of a a Zeal and a philosophy and a framework uh that may or may not be Trump is kind of a dealmaker he&#39;ll put out these huge ideas and say we&#39;re going to tax everyone 100% And then when it comes down to it uh he kind of plays the crazy card to get people to the table and then he cuts a deal that he thinks is in the interest of the US people and creating jobs and putting America First etc etc is he is he perfect no is it a is it a practical way for a New York City real estate developer to go about implementing policy yeah that&#39;s the framework that he used used to build his business over time and it worked uh uh on balance for him over over many years and I think it&#39;s it&#39;s an okay way the market uh is used to taking people at their word So when you say we&#39;re going to put 100% tariffs it&#39;s like wow that would really be a bad idea too uh almost as bad as unrealized capital gains uh so it does get worried but I think after dealing for four years with Trump and knowing he puts out these Grand claims and then he tries to get to a practice iCal solution and more often than not does uh I think they would take it with a grain of salt and let him work his process are you looking forward to just the market stabilizing uh if not rallying shortly after the election just on the back of certainty for what we know basically we know who&#39;s going to be president now we know what the uh you know Administration is going to look like some certainty is good yeah I think unequivocally if we get gridlock and we have mixed government no not one party controlling all three branches uh we get that that rally uh as far as the indices though when you have inflation in this four to five percent range uh excuse me uh when you have uh uh rates in in this range 45% Etc if you look at multiples over time we&#39;re kind of in The Sweet Spot currently where multiples have actually averaged 22 23 times as as the um as rates go much lower which implies growth may be slowing demand for Capital may be slowing the multiple contracts or as rates go much higher which implies there&#39;s inflation and that type of thing multiples contract like the 70s you had singled digigit multiples because you had high rates which was fighting High inflation um but we&#39;re in the sweet spot where the market can actually actually sustain uh 21 to 23 times multiple but we&#39;re kind of knocking up against that so to your question does the market rally after the election I think a lot of companies rally after the election but it may not be those seven that are the most heavily weighted within the index they they&#39;ll do fine but I think that Trend that started in July that we&#39;ve talked about on on our past visits together persist and and all that means is margins are Contracting because of the spend for the mag 7 on AI and servers and all that stuff their earnings growth has dropped from 50% down to the High Teens whereas the other unmagnify that had negative earnings growth uh not only turned positive earnings growth in the most recent quarter but that accelerates up to Mid teens over the coming quarters so a lot of companies that are still down and out are going to be doubles and triples even if the indices have subdued returns that don&#39;t look like the rearview mirror of double digits maybe they look like high single digits but monstrous amounts of money could be made in small caps monstrous amount of money uh could be made in value which out outperforms growth in the first six months small caps outperforms large cap by 11% in the first 12 months after the first cut um and um the 50 basis point cut really will help a lot of small cap companies refinance and raise capital and uh continue to to grow earnings so I think that is a long answer to a short question it&#39;s nuanced indices upsh nicely but not bigly I guess dovetailing off our our last segment sure sure and um uh under the surface opportunities like we haven&#39;t seen since 2002 to 2007 Emerging Markets rally is going to be huge right huge but but seen only under the surface if you&#39;re just sitting in passive index funds you&#39;re going to be like okay it&#39;s okay things are going uppish uh but it&#39;s not going to be boom but if you saying look this is what performs best after the first cut I want I want some small cap exposure I want some Emerging Market exposure I want some value exposure those things that haven&#39;t worked for the last decade if you&#39;re in those you&#39;re going to be smiling so wide you could eat a banana sideways okay so to sum up you you you like uh small cat for now not so sure about Consumer Staples which we talked about earlier any speaking of consumer staples if you look at the Bank of America fund manager survey okay this week the exposure to Staples relative to discretionary is so stretched right now so I think and you saw it last night with the change of the CEO of Nike for instance Nike is an example of those discretionary stock that are left for dead Starbucks in a lesser extent Left for Dead starting to get change uh Lululemon we don&#39;t own any of those three which is why I&#39;m telling you about those three Lululemon some of these companies that have been been smashed because everyone&#39;s convinced this the consumer&#39;s dead um the consumer is not dead we&#39;ve seen retail sales and now they&#39;re over time the interest rate environment is become G to become more favorable I also think we&#39;re going to start to see in the next 12 months uh there is so much tapped home equity again I think we could see the HELOC game turning back on the consumer uh Leverage is at historic lows it just collapsed off the pre great financial crisis highs there is so much room for credit expansion and I think that&#39;s going to drive a multi-year expansion at least into the next decade that that means what for investors we should be basically more cyclical in our in our positioning we yeah that that&#39;s that is the framework that we&#39;re looking at and I think a decent an analog would be 2002 to 2007 where Tech started to underperform I don&#39;t think Tech crashes like it did back then I think it just underperforms relative to those groups that have performed less well so I like cyclicals I like discretionary I like small caps I like Emerging Markets I like value over growth in the near term um and there&#39;s so many Quality Companies available that are marked down 50 plus% that are going to be doubles over the next three years but how do you feel about bonds uh in the last segment of our conversation by the way I&#39;m looking over at uh let&#39;s flip over to my screen one more time uh this is the CME fed watch tool and all the way to June 20 July 2025 the Market&#39;s pricing in a significant probability of um the FED funds rate hovering anywhere between 275 to 350 which is you know considerably lower than what it is today uh first of all what do you feel about this projection um or expectation and how is it going to affect the bond market this is one that I think about a lot David and I I think that those expecting the FED funds rate to get to three quickly are going to be disappointed I&#39;m glad they did the front load because they were behind the curve I think they&#39;re 2 200 Bas they were 200 basis points too restrictive and I also think that the inflation numbers are going to be bumpy for the I mean we you know we&#39;re we are creatures of recency bias I mean I haven&#39;t looked at crew today but whatever it is hovering around 70 I I think that&#39;s a temporary not a permanent issue I mean you could wake up tomorrow and the Chinese government could announce a massive stimulus because they&#39;re behind the ball on their 5% Target and all of a sudden crude goes to you know goes up 10% in two days because people start to expect greater demand and um and then all of a sudden that energy in the input cost of all of the materials starts to go up and people start to say oh maybe we&#39;re not going to 2.2% maybe we&#39;re going to 3.4% inflation and the fed&#39;s not going to start to rehke per se but they&#39;re going to slow it down so I think unless the labor market gets weaker in the next two prints I think we&#39;re going to move to a regime of 20 five basis point uh cuts from this point forward and they&#39;re going to be spaced out and it wouldn&#39;t shock me if the terminal rate is higher than 3% maybe it&#39;s three and a half maybe I I wouldn&#39;t say four but I would say high threes and that&#39;s not bad news that&#39;s good news because it means soft Landing was achieved and the labor market didn&#39;t blow up and we got the midcycle adjust M correct and and we&#39;re reaccelerating so that&#39;s where what we&#39;re thinking about right now that also supports all of the groups that I&#39;ve talked to to you about that we&#39;re interested in and invested in uh so just as you know you&#39;ve seen the FED fund future go from expecting seven cuts when we got none to now you know to then expecting none and we got a 50 basis point and and then now expecting this I think it goes in extremes I think the cuts will continue but I think they&#39;ll be slower and smaller than the market thinks right now and that&#39;s that is a positive thing for the economy and the market I&#39;m going to flip over to the T year now um and I want to just take a look at how it&#39;s been behaving this is the 10year and let&#39;s just chart it over inflation so um if you take I think you know where I&#39;m going with this over the last what happened here okay so over the last basically 40 years there&#39;s been uh a Rel relationship I don&#39;t want to call it a very close correlationship correlation but a relationship between the 10-year and the inflation rate um given your outlook on the macro you just talked about the labor market and inflation stabilizing around uh 2.5% right now uh what do you think is going to happen to the Tang year and ultimately bonds okay so we had been massive Bond Bulls uh from uh from for some time and we&#39;ve gotten a rally and I think now we&#39;re going to get a counter Trend move I.E our our framework had been bonds up yields down that&#39;s worked and that was a very unpopular view just a year ago uh and that&#39;s been correct now that everyone is starting to say buy bonds uh I think we&#39;re going to get a counter Trend move I think yields are going to go up in the short term not crazily we&#39;re not going back to five or anything like that on the 10-year but I think a for handle it wouldn&#39;t Shock Me In coming months uh before we resume the the the downtrend in yields for some time so by the way do you expect corporates to uh to do better now that we have a lower rates lower chance of default Ye Ye yes yeah I think spreads are going to narrow as that as that window actually high yield spreads blew out a hair uh in in recent weeks I think now that markets are getting comfortable that the window is reopening for companies quote unquote with distress I.E small cap companies to refinance uh corporate bonds should do well we don&#39;t really traffic in that area so I don&#39;t want to make any like calls on corporate bonds but as far as the 10-year yield our short-term view which we don&#39;t trade on short-term view we you know we tend to hold our companies two to four to five years unless they perform way f faster than would would be expected in which case but uh that that&#39;s a champagne problem um I think he get a counter Trend move I think he probably get a counter Trend bounce on the dollar the trend for the dollar is lower uh again that was another thing that we were contrarian on has proven right it&#39;s gotten weaker now that everyone&#39;s getting on board with that view I think we get a contrarian uh shortterm bounce strength in the dollar and um and a short-term rise in yields the antithesis of what everyone&#39;s expecting you know oh when the FED Cuts rates will go down no what the FED actually did on Wednesday and we said in our podcast on Tuesday I said I didn&#39;t think it was probable that they would cut 50% but based on what I was looking at I said it was plausible that they would and on the basis of that people would expect yields to go lower they would go higher and the reason they would go higher is because basis points at this time dramatically increases the odds of a soft landing and a growth re acceleration which favors cyclicals which favors small caps which favors value um and what I was looking at in terms of yields being compressed and Staples and utilities you know utilities are up 50% as a basket since last fall and now everyone wants utilities I said there&#39;s going to be a counter Trend move those were the only like shooting a barrel shorts which we&#39;re not going to short defensives into a potential period of of volatility so how can the market cause the most pain to the most amount of people that would be a counter Trend move in yields which means utilities would go down uh bonds would go down yields would go up why because now that utilities are up 50% everyone&#39;s chasing them no one wanted them 50% ago in the fall of last year so I think that&#39;s the that&#39;s the trend and if that&#39;s the trend it&#39;s hard to see a scenario where you have a monstrous draw down in equities ahead of the election even though the probabilities would favor weakness into the election I think too many people are positioned for that and the market doesn&#39;t reward when everyone&#39;s crowded into one trade it tends to punish that this particularly tends to punish the Johnny come lately&#39;s and there have been a lot who would never be getting into utilities three months ago all crowded in now that they&#39;re up 50% final question I&#39;ll let you go Tom uh on Central Bank Divergence which actually we started with let&#39;s close off on that so like you pointed out central banks around the world kept rates and changed uh this week would this pose a risk uh in the next coming months suppose we continue to get this Divergence with a Fed cuts by 25 basis points like you said um or even 50 in in some extreme cases but other central banks stay Pat wouldn&#39;t that induce Capital flows out of the US into Japan or any other place that has relatively higher rates now that will be the trend over time I think the trend overtime it overtime meaning intermediate term 12 to 24 months is weaker dollar bonds rally over time I think the short-term counter trend is stronger dollar next few weeks uh yields out next few weeks but looking out a few months to more than a few months uh you&#39;ll resume a A downtrend in the dollar you&#39;ll resume uh bid in bonds that all favors the groups that we&#39;ve discussed so far uh and and the stage is setting for the for the area that no one wants to touch which is emerging markets and we&#39;ve been pounding the drum but you know sooner or later these Frameworks they repeat themselves over and over and over and the conditions are set the table is set right now uh that&#39;s going to be the next thing to surprise people just as when you couldn&#39;t give away the 10year uh some time back and we were pounding the table on that that that had a big big rally um for that instrument and now that everyone wants it you get the counter Trend move excellent where can we follow you Tom uh I&#39;m on Twitter at hedge fund tips we have a podcast called hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes which is well- ranked in its uh Cate the hedge fund category it toggles between number one and number three and uh hedge fund tips.com is the blog okay we&#39;ll put the links down below yes you got a great podcast people should check out Tom Hayes&#39;s uh newsletter and podcast great great reading and great listening so uh thanks for coming back on uh appreciate your updates and uh yeah you&#39;ve been right all year let&#39;s see what happens in the next couple of months you&#39;ve got a few months left to be wrong but uh exactly we got to keep our humility when when you&#39;re on a run like that uh so that that&#39;s the name of the game that&#39;s why we just try to stick to good companies at reasonable prices and then we play the time Arbitrage game so we don&#39;t have to be right about all these zigs and zags but I know you like the zigs and zags so I&#39;m grateful to be on and talk with you all right well we&#39;ll talk next time about sub that maybe haven&#39;t worked down your career that could be a fun discussion maybe a long one too all right thanks my friend thank you for watching yeah thank you for watching and we&#39;re back and then on Tuesday literally an hour and a half before they announced the stimulus you got to hear what I was saying to Sean Caleb on cgtn America basically on Chinese TV telling the Chinese government you know let&#39;s go you got to stimulate uh so I don&#39;t know if they heard it but it is their channel so uh they definitely acted pretty quickly on that well the fed&#39;s decision to cut that Benchmark interest rate has far-reaching consequences not just in the United States but across the globe worldwide the fed&#39;s decision to loosen its per strings could encourage other economies to do the same thing Reuters reports it has has tracked about nine emerging economies already cutting rates this cycle however experts say institutions such as the European Central Bank and the bank of England will be more cautious with fewer plans for more Cuts ahead the feds rate will also have an impact on foreign exchange rates as the world&#39;s principal Reserve currency the US dollar has a huge impact on the cost of borrowing for emerging markets now a weakened dollar could lift other currencies with the Yen and Swiss frank EXP expect to see some relief through 2025 now for a deeper dive into all this and how the fed&#39;s decision is going to impact economies all over the world let&#39;s bring in our friend Thomas Hayes he&#39;s the founder chairman and managing member of great Hill capital a long short Equity manager based in New York City Thomas great to have you back on I find this pretty fascinating let&#39;s broadly speaking kind of walk us through how you see the FED reserves rate cut influencing the global economy well Sean thanks for having me on I think the number one thing that happened with the 50 basis point cut and frontloading that cut to a large size is it took a hard Landing off the table what we saw as the immediate response as it relates to bonds was a buy the rumor sell the news so while everyone said well rates are going down now 50 basis points why did yields go up in the last few trading sessions following that 50 basis point cut and that&#39;s because a a lot of it was priced in ahead of the cut but I I do think that is a counter Trend move counter Trend uh move higher in yields in the short term over the next couple of weeks counter Trend move higher in the US dollar a short term over the next few weeks but I think as you look at the intermediate term and the continued cuts and the continued reduction of restriction you&#39;re going to see a weakening of the dollar uh you&#39;re going to see rates come down and that bodess extremely well for emerging markets equities let&#39;s talk a bit more about the impact on these Emerging Markets because Emerging Markets borrow money and if the interest rate is going to be reduced it seems it is going to ease the burden on Nations borrowing These funds yeah there&#39;s no question uh what you see in periods like this of U uh easing cycle for the FED is emerging market equities tend to outperform developed Market equity ities uh in the US small caps tend to outperform large caps by 11% in the first 12 months value stocks outperform growth and consumer discretionary comes back and outperforms Consumer Staples we&#39;ve seen a huge crowding into consumer staples and utilities I.E defensive stocks ahead of the cut and now that we have cut uh the 50 basis point cut I think it&#39;s reset growth expectations if a hard Landing is off the table we could see higher than expected growth coming forward and that shifts the the type of stocks you want to be in now let&#39;s think back to that Friday when the rate cut came because the markets really didn&#39;t do much that day but they have rallied uh in the in the coming days uh after that so let&#39;s talk about the impact of the strength of the US dollar and global trade balances and I&#39;m curious about the fact you think that the US Central Bank cut is going to have on China if any well well historically uh Chinese equities is a large weight in the emerging market equities index and we believe that Chinese equities will start to outperform it is going to need some help from the Chinese government itself in terms of a larger more aggressive stimulus but the table is set if the Chinese government moves to stimulate uh you are going to see a dramatic outperformance of Chinese equities over us equities in the next 1 to 3 years if they fail to do that and they start to miss their growth targets uh it may be a more subdued response and a missed opportunity of a lifetime for the Chinese government and the Chinese people interesting okay how do interest rate Cuts impact International Capital flows especially in sectors like real estate and Technology to a certain degree as the global markets are pushing for this soft Landing you&#39;ve been talking about Nations tend to play Follow of the lader now we know that the Eurozone uh and the bank of England they made cuts ahead of time so other nations these emerging Nations uh they&#39;re going to be rising rates to Cil inflation to try to stimulate growth money goes where it&#39;s treated best so on balance uh money is going to flow into those places that have higher yields that&#39;s going to strengthen some of the Emerging Markets currencies I also believe a lot of currencies relative to the US dollar whether it&#39;s the Canadian dollar the British pound the Euro uh Emerging Market currencies over time and the big story that we have to keep our on is the Yen because while we&#39;ve had about 85 90 Cuts around the world year to dat uh the bank of Japan is looking to start to curb inflation and they started with a hike in August we saw the result of that in the first week of August a big correction then they said oh we were just kidding we&#39;re not going to do that so much anymore certainly not until the FED got easy which they just did so I think before the end of the year we could see more tightening by Bank of Japan which is a stronger Yen against the dollar uh and maybe more subdued response in Japanese equities than we&#39;ve seen in recent years I like that just kidding okay with inflation cooling down do you think this rate cut is going to reignite inflationary pressures in other parts of the world you talked a bit about what happened in Japan uh Japan is not affected uh their inflation is affected by many many many years of e you know very easy easy policy by the bank of Japan so that that won&#39;t be impacted as much by the US policy I do think that US inflation should hover closer to a mean of 3% over the next few few years versus a mean of 2% I.E the fed target uh and that&#39;s probably a good thing when you have debt to GDP at 120% uh historically like we saw post World War II if you run inflation a little hotter than normal it&#39;s easier to bring those debt to GDP ratios down than if you start to get closer to deflation uh then the then the debt problem could be a bigger issue so I think 3% 3 three and a half is The Sweet Spot and that&#39;s probably the base case for the next few years qu quickly Thomas not a lot of time left here but I&#39;m curious if you think that the FED waited too long to cut interest rates because there was that concern if they cut 50 basis points then they waited too long and the markets were going to have an adverse reaction that first day when not a whole lot happened I think people were tense they waited too long and they&#39;re going to get away with it so I&#39;ll leave it at that uh I think that the frontload was positive we&#39;re going to see in the jobs report uh not this Friday but the Friday after uh and then that will determine how quickly they have to catch up look they were behind the curve on inflation but they caught up uh let&#39;s hope that uh they can catch up in time and I think they will in fact pull off the soft to no Landing uh by moving as aggressively and as quickly as they did well I think a lot of investors are hoping you&#39;re exactly right Thomas thank you so much we appreciate it thank you Sean okay and then I had two hits after last week&#39;s podcast uh one on Neil Cavuto want to thank Neil and Jenna d tomases That&#39;s Scott Martin who was uh super excited that day it was before the FED hike fed cut rather uh you can listening to that on your own uh that&#39;s just basically anticipating the uh the cut as well as CBS News I was on also the day of it talks about the implications of mortgages and consumers so you can listen to that on your own want to thank um Camille Smith for having me on CBS and then want to thank the New York Post for including me in the article about Nike shoes so on December 5th to 7th I&#39;ll be speaking in Sarasota at the money show you can click here to register for that event if you&#39;re going to be down in Florida take advantage and our quote of the week if from Seth claran the stock market is a story of cycles and of the human behavior that is responsible for overreactions in both directions and you know these are some of the quotes that got us through when everyone was flipping out when Baba went down for no apparent reason because the fundamentals continued to perform and in most cases improve and now we&#39;re just literally getting started I got to tell you the the big joke of today is all the texts and emails and phone calls oh wow you know congratulations blah blah blah I&#39;m like on what we&#39;re we&#39;re just getting started they&#39;re like should I sell some blah blah blah and and this is going to be the entire way up you&#39;re going to see people selling the short selling um buying the short-term tops and selling the short-term bottoms the whole way up because it won&#39;t be believed everyone will be skeptical and they&#39;ll miss the entire thing meanwhile saying if we get a pullback I want to go to 25% uh I&#39;m going to break all of my positioning rules and double it um so you know just a difference of opinion um moving right along to our data for the week we&#39;ve got a lot of it and that&#39;s why we are prepared luck is when preparation meets opportunity and that&#39;s what we try to do here and share with our awesome amazing treasured audience that you are so here is some data from G talking about uh what happens after the first cut and you can see on balance the returns are pretty solid except when there&#39;s a recession and the GDP just got revised up to 3% the Atlanta GD for Q2 Atlanta today Atlanta GDP is still hovering around 3% very hard to have a recession with 3% GDP which knocks these two columns out which means uh basically 100% positivity ratio without a recession uh this is a S&amp;P 500 after the NYSC mlen summation index cycled from below a 100 to above a thousand instances within 2% of a fiveyear high and what you can see here is as you look out two weeks two months 6 months and 12 months uh the median and the mean are uh mid double digit mid- teens double digits manufacturing production for August month- on-month Vehicles went up 17.3% so that&#39;s a positive thing S&amp;P 500 after first decrease in fed funds ratio after five or more increases and you see the mean gain 12 months out 13.4 so everyone you know finagles the inputs and everything else the bottom line is the cuts are a good thing particularly when you&#39;re not you&#39;re near New highs and you&#39;re not uh in or near a recession uh industrial production picked up that&#39;s a positive thing we&#39;ve talked about pmis in past weeks you also see margin debt this is from Seth golden um declined in August so very hard to say it&#39;s a bubble or investors are exuberant now on the flip side he also posted yeah so uh so that&#39;s that asset class quilt of returns that&#39;s from last week um we&#39;ll leave that this is it shows stocks bonds T bills gold and US dollar over time as a reminder you can&#39;t compete with stocks over the long-term 6.9% compounded and that includes the 1800s which were a complete disaster if you take out the 1800s it&#39;s more like N9 or 10% including dividends uh versus bonds at you know three three and a half percent mix of price and wage inflation bodess well for profit margins that&#39;s from Goldman Sachs so you know 15% earnings growth next year margins increasing oh and by the way uh the uh albatross around the the global economy&#39;s neck has been China&#39;s slowing growth which just changed overnight when they announced fiscal stimulus in addition to the monetary wage growth is slowed points of continued moderation that&#39;s a good thing for uh inflation not ticking back up but it will it&#39;ll be about three three and a half percent and that&#39;s a good thing not a bad thing Goldman Sachs economists expect roughly stable employment so they&#39;re expecting this to go back down from their lips to God&#39;s ears although as they&#39;ve said historically they are doing God&#39;s work so they must know uh earnings estimates hanging in there at 278 for next year which is about 15% earnings growth 15.2 uh it&#39;s interesting the the chorus now is expectations are too high therefore the Market&#39;s too expensive and that was the exact same chorus last October when everyone was selling in the whole that expectations were too high and not only did they meet but they met they exceeded expectations for this year as the city group surprise economic surprise index is finally turning up not down up not down which is a which is what happens when the market goes up after you see stuff like that um 75 to 76 asset rally spurred by the FED cutting from 9% to 4% what outperformed small cap and value which we covered with Brad and with Kristen this morning um money market assets peaked nine months after the first cut so all but this was a jumbo cut so it might be much faster which means that Six Trillion or whatever whatever it is right now is going to be coming out of money market funds and into equities and that&#39;s why we&#39;ve been talking not just this year and last year and 2022 when you couldn&#39;t give away stocks and 2020 when you couldn&#39;t give away stocks go back and look at the tapes we&#39;re buying Handover fist um but now you&#39;ve got all of this dry powder that in coming months is going to come back into equities even if you get a little short-term volatility and uh that&#39;s a good thing not a bad thing stocks on Pace to diverge from historic September slump uh and we&#39;re going to talk a little bit about that in the article of the week consensus projecting 18% EPS growth by year end 2025 uh that&#39;s a big deal us new vehicle sales forecast for August got taken up uh year on-ear to 8% and month- on Monon over July of 12% growth September was a little softer so we&#39;re going to look at some estimates in just a little bit but it is tracking to where we needed to track for Cooper standard which is a good thing and allows room for a positive upside surprise as rates come down as in as incentives go up into year end to clear those EVS that aren&#39;t selling and replace them with hybrids which are a money machine for Cooper standard evidence of ruring more jobs coming manufacturing construction you can look at the data manufacturing employment is finally ticking up after a two two and a half year depression is what manufacturing has been in uh manufacturing construction spending is hockey sticking on the electrical and electronic uh areas IE data centers Etc so that&#39;s going to be a positive thing us semiconductor additions these are uh facilities Intel uh the money from the government Micron Samsung Taiwan semiconductor Texas Instruments and you can see Arizona New Mexico Ohio this is jobs this is construction this is manufact uring this is Stanley Black and&amp; Decker tools and what are they going to need they&#39;re going to need backup systems from J this is going to be incredible uh corporate commentary on reshoring everyone&#39;s talking about reshoring across corporate conference calls it&#39;s through the roof construction pipeline for the US data centers is rising uh stuff is old capex is coming back manufacturing capacity starting to grow after 10 years of stagnation capex as a percentage of operating cash flow just off historic lows infrastructure spend is finally ticking up that Ira money is getting into the economy and um bil project announcements focus on roads Bridges and other major projects coming to a theater near you construction spend on US highways and streets is 140 billion dollar last year keeps going up uh 15% year-on-year inflation adjusted growth employment growth is holding up for Highway Street and Bridge construction that&#39;s good value of construction put in place is growing value so you can just see the story is very very clear Motor Vehicles in Miles increased 10% since 20110 uh but the fatality rate rate is no longer declining okay the key thing here is that you&#39;ve got the average car on the road at 13.7 years which is a record all-time high and the amount of use per vehicle is going up every single year not down which means they&#39;re going to require more maintenance and more replacement it&#39;s huge pent up it was waiting for rates it&#39;s coming to a theater near you and it&#39;s going to be lower prices and lower financing costs um all day long coming from dealer incentives to clear the Lots before the end of the year and the production is going to ramp up Global car production you can see here the numbers ramping up and this is also very interesting a lot of the fiscal spend you can see here but a lot of people very very pessimistic but when you look at the Bull and Bear indicator from Bank of America it&#39;s not yet at an extreme and which is why we keep seeing these atypical seasonal um strength and why two or three weeks ago when we got on here and we said you know we really want to hedge or be tactically short but when we looked across 2,000 companies the only thing we could find that we wanted to short were defensives and you don&#39;t short defensives if you&#39;re looking for a market correction so what it tells me is everyone already hedged out and if you look at skew and if you look at vix ahead of the FED cut and um so probably the maximum pain trade the Market&#39;s designed to fool most of the people most of the time is that we grind sideways through the election uh for the passive investors the indices people the mag s people uh burn through all that put premium give them a goose egg for their efforts uh or push higher those would be the two pain trades based on how people are positioned with their insurance record levels of insurance record cost of insurance to protect against downside both uh skew particularly for one and two standard deviation events um and so on which is why we remain fully invested very low Leverage will ride any October bumps and and play the year in rally provided we get gridlock us to basement International outperformance US versus global equities this game is over ladies and gentlemen I&#39;m telling you uh it&#39;s this is amazing I mean if you thought the extreme was in 2000 it&#39;s pales in comparison to how extreme we are right now that is changing now China just decided that is changing you are going to see Emerging Markets outperform developed markets and it may very well be for the exact amount of time that they&#39;ve underperformed which is the last decade in a z Zer environment where mag 7 outperformed now I think you&#39;re going to see uh emerging markets in a normalized rate environment with China stimulus uh and the demographics uh dramatically outperform and this will revert back to the mean not to say the US will crash they&#39;ll just do a lot less well than uh how what we&#39;re positioned to take advantage of um okay us retail sales ticked up last month sign of ongoing consumer resilience gas stations were weak retailers were strong health and personal care industrial production is up that&#39;s good rebounds after Hurricane related drop manufacturing production that&#39;s Vehicles we talked about up 177% uh Max manufacturing production you can see it visually here here&#39;s the FED GDP now at uh 3% homeb Builder confidence is coming off the death you know it&#39;s like a Phoenix Rising From the Ashes uh as rates come down that will come back create more Supply rates come down more Supply coming on the market for housing uh us on Pace for more gas power capacity that is good for uh U us gas power plants that&#39;s going to be natural gas all day long Jerry Jones and great Hill capital are going to benefit with Comm stock resources uh all this is opinion not advice click on terms at hedge fund tips.com we don&#39;t know your financial situation we deal with exclusively with qualified clients accredited investors and institutions family offices uh prioritization of returning cash to shareholders at an 11-year high this is concerning to me uh and this is what I&#39;ve always said I&#39;d rather buy companies like the chinesee who are buying their stock trading at six and eight times earnings versus the Americans like Jensen Wong uh uh buying back $50 billion a stock at 42 times sales and dumping three4 of a billion on the retail uh investor after they announce a split uh you know it is what it is all right percent of debt that&#39;s floating rate small caps 27.4 that&#39;s why small caps are going to outperform over the first 12 months refinancing window opens that will help Cooper standard in the first quarter uh refinance all of their debt which will be another Catalyst small cap forward PE relative to S&amp;P 500 uh the last time it was this low was 2001 we continue to repeat 2002 to 2007 good analog Emerging Markets small caps outperform value outperform value ETF flows are picking up this month see enough people are listening to my podcast these days there you go I&#39;m joking us multif family completions highest since 1974 that&#39;s probably going to be an area where you start to find your next batch of Bargains in the next 6 to 18 months [Music] um Regional valuation you can see where we are relative to the mean in the USA going back the last 20 years well on the top end the world well on the top well above the top end um Japan mid Europe mid um Asia Pacific X Japan mid and Emerging Markets mid 11 times versus 21 times you tell me price is what you pay value is what you get Boeing&#39;s business is much more than just commercial planes you can see here six billion of their business defense space and security is six billion and Global Services is five billion so there&#39;s a huge Diversified amazing business we&#39;ve taken advantage of every day the strike goes on we buy more stock thank you very much I get to buy more share in a duopoly with a 10-year backlog of customers not a whole lot to think about there they&#39;ll get it settled one way or another US Stocks make up nearly 2third of the msci world Index this is another sign of extreme just like the mag 7 waiting in the S&amp;P 500 these will revert back to the mean and we&#39;ll see that without performance of emerging and xus versus Us in the next uh half to full decade and uh no one&#39;s position for it other than great Hill capital and a few others that listen to the podcast which we&#39;re very excited about them growth expectations remain weak which remains me makes me think that we can continue to climb the wall of worry this is from the fund manager survey this is not what you see near euphoric Tops This is what you see near bottoms where you want to be a buyer which makes no sense because we&#39;re a few percent from the or near or at all-time highs I think today uh dollar probably get a counter Trend bounce here before breaking lower which will continue to help emerging markets and intern National just like 2002 to 2007 straight down ladies and gentlemen and I think we&#39;re going to have a similar regime in coming months and years Philadelphia manufacturing was up Bank of Japan kept interest ratees steady upgrades view on consumption they will be hiking probably before the end of the year probably after the election so be alert to that that will impact mag 7 that will also impact Japanese equities I.E put pressure on both which leads to flows back into where China opinion follows Trend that all the Skeptics will be forced into it and it&#39;s interesting because you know while we&#39;re you know while we&#39;re you know Baba is up now almost 56 to 105 almost double off the bottom and the move hasn&#39;t even started yet and people will be chasing like nobody&#39;s business and they&#39;ll get really excited when it&#39;s up 200% off the bottom mark my words Japan customer inflation picked up in August a mid Bank of Japan rate hike view inflation means they&#39;re going to have to hike uh so keep an eye on that carry trade that&#39;s a that&#39;s a story a few months out um the other thing that&#39;s interesting here x recessions the first fed cut has marked the trough in the ISM Manufacturing PMI this is why small cap value cyclicals uh take off City economic surprise index turning up in a material way there&#39;s a new biggest bull on Wall Street raises its yearend Target to 6,100 that&#39;s Brian bsky here the CEOs can&#39;t buy enough stock at the top uh and they couldn&#39;t sell enough stock at the bottom you can&#39;t make this stuff up that they couldn&#39;t they would they you couldn&#39;t sell them a share when their stocks were down 50 and 75% and now that they&#39;re up double everyone wants to buy this is this is bad policy and that&#39;s one thing I&#39;m not going to say like I think China management is incredible or anything I just think that they get it I mean you buy your stock and you buy stocks generally quality when they&#39;re down not when they&#39;re up and um National Association active investment managers again moving up but not yet at extreme uh bull bear spread is towards extreme but it&#39;s a survey of 300 people so you know take it with a grain of salt uh average vix during election year since 1992 it should climb through October we&#39;ll see this year there you know between the cut the China stimulus it&#39;s it&#39;s interesting what&#39;s going on and everyone positioned short the the real pain would be a straight up but uh I think more likely a grind sideways in the US to search is to Google so mobile still have 95% share desktop is declining a little bit uh that&#39;s from Statia next ha half of bull market returns are in the made in the first 10% of the time this is very important and we&#39;ve actually just seen an example in Alibaba you know in 10% of the time we&#39;ve gotten a basically a double off the bottom 56 to 105 so you know that&#39;s why we say we we&#39;re patient we&#39;re low leverage and when it goes down we buy more because we want to be positioned when it turns it runs away without you and um it it&#39;s it&#39;s mindboggling AC like how much stock we were able to buy in the hole is staggering and it it&#39;s funny I was texting back and forth with a friend and I said I&#39;m G to send z a Christmas card because he took so long to finally do the stimulus probably a year longer than I expected I bought so much effing stock in the Hole uh down at lower levels than when I started that my basis is so much lower than where we are now thanks to him dragging his feet uh otherwise I wouldn&#39;t nearly have anywhere close to the size position we have and um so very grateful for that despite the extra white hairs uh there you go so conditions are right for Chinese stocks relative to Gold so this is from gaval from my friend uh who sent this over and it says China Market has been here before just before start of two bull markets this is the uh um Shanghai 180 Total return relative to gold in R&amp;B you can see when it gets down to these levels you start secular bull markets when&#39;s the last time it happened 2013 and then you got to go all the way back to the early 2000s average job growth per month in thousands uh pre-co average was 177,000 we&#39;re at 174,000 so not yet in trouble the other thing that they&#39;re showing here the Som rule may be incorrect as the writer of the S rule uh said and that is that prime age non-employment rate is going down not up the general employment rate is going up so you can see this Divergence here and that&#39;s also in line with kind of what we said about inflation not inflation immigration adjusted unemployment rate was estimated to be four 3.6 versus 4.3 for the total inflation rate looks a lot like this Divergent here it unemployment at new high that&#39;s Tech mag 7 plus so keep that on your radar UK retail sales turning up so is Asos that tiny position we were going to cover it this week but you know with all the Baba news uh we&#39;ll probably push that out to either next quarter or the coming weeks that&#39;s a small position but we&#39;re looking to maybe add more on this UK recovery we do have a nice position in gxo to play the UK recovery so we&#39;re in no extreme rush and we made a lot of money on the Rolls-Royce recovery uh as well uh for those of you who&#39;ve been with us for a while UK retail sales beat expectations during August Sunny spell so I guess the Sun comes out and the Brits come out of the bar and spend money uh on stuff versus on Guinness which is a good thing not a bad thing earnings expectations for AI stock NOW lag the market so when was everyone buying it after earnings peaked and are now decelerating S&amp;P earnings are accelerating core to our theme uh dxy which is the dollar Index typically doesn&#39;t typically rally during cutting Cycles give this guy a raise Captain Obvious Autos benefit uh and then biggest relative overweight in defensive versus cyclical since May of 2020 what did you want to buy in May of 2020 if you were listening and what were we buying on the podcast cyclicals we were buying Banks we were buying oil in the Hole uh and uh and that made our 20 20 one of the best years ever this year uh has a shot uh we&#39;ll see how this plays out but it could be our best year ever we&#39;ll find out in a few months uh FMS risk appetite at 11mon low again not things you see at tops things you see closer to Bottoms this is the mag s profits decelerating rest of index accelerating we continue to reemphasize that each week dividends likely to contribute more to Total returns than during the last decade which would be a big deal big change from the Zer which implies what implies International with more dividends does better than domestic as well increase in volatility from July through November in presidential election years so we just keep our eye on it uh had a little volatility in August obviously with the carry trade early September um and we&#39;ll probably get another scare in October 12 month after first fed cut healthc care has highest hit rate um so that would be benefit us in terms of bio Tech um Etc the China stimulus a couple points well we&#39;ll go through that on the article of the week China reserve requirement ratio so we know that came down 50 basis point repo rate 20 basis points the key was the stimulus they&#39;re actually handing poor people $22 billion of checks they&#39;ve never really done that type of direct stimulus they&#39;re following the Western Playbook that worked so well during covid and they&#39;re issuing bonds for 280 something billion dollars to start fiscal stimulus um which is a big big deal China Equity exposure at fiveyear lows just in time to miss the first 100% off the bottom uh pretty exciting stuff dollar is weakening relative to the Chinese Yuan remember we wanted to see two things Yuan strengthen and uh Bond Chinese bond yields start to go up they are beginning n stages that will accelerate now that the Bazooka stimulus bazooka not only monetary but fiscal and property has come out this week China hands out subsidies to car buyers subsidize away get the growth rate back Alibaba is the toll taker for all of China and we will benefit all day long fed officials leave door open to another large interest rate cut we now expect a series of consecutive 25 basis point cuts through June of 2025 Mar Market is now pricing 31 to 36 basis points of cut for each of the next four meetings um which is from Goldman Sachs real personal consumption expenditure pce forecast are expected to go down we&#39;re going to find out tomorrow that&#39;s an important inflation number so we got tomorrow uh that could shake things up either up or down based on the inflation number I think my guess it probably comes close to in line and then the jobs report next Friday is a big one to watch as well equal weight index starting to outperform we covered that on one of the hits this morning uh cumulative record highs for the S&amp;P 500 equal weight index what does that mean uh the unmagnify are doing what we said they would several months ago when we started pounding the table before the summer and is that mag 7 would underperform 493 would outperform that&#39;s been happening in Spades more capex more hyperscaler capex that&#39;s going to destroy their margins and um and their earnings power us share buyback authorization they keep buying uh up at the top and that&#39;s predominantly the mag 7 and they&#39;re going to get egg on their face for that it&#39;s just a matter of time this is from Brian Rich this shows like a seven year cycle up and down for the US dollar we just peaked two years ago and this implies we&#39;ve got another five or six years of weakening dollar which is emerging markets and international stocks outperform I love this this is from uh macro charts shows that uh there&#39;s only been three other times that short just got this high in China they all began monster monster rallies in Chinese equities same thing is happening now Chinese Yuan hits its strongest level against the dollar in over 16 months as investors assess pboc stimulus all this stuff that we&#39;ve said for months was going to play out has played out conviction this was the second most crowded trade in the world was short China equities in September just behind long mag s and just in time to get their faces ripped off based on S&amp;P options the next two NFP prints are the main catalyst until the election so you can see here major events are at non-farm payrolls uh CPI numbers retail sales non-farm payrolls and then of course the election consumer confidence still low another reason to climb the wall of worry potentially um worrying a little bit more about jobs we talked about China we talked about the Yuan h s huge uh rolling returns we&#39;ll cover that one in the article record utilities inflows remember last fall pounding the table in October no one wanted them up 50% everyone wants some record flows into Utilities in the last week sell baby sell that&#39;s all I can tell you which tells me we&#39;re probably going to get a counter Trend bounce in yields on the tenure going up and that&#39;s actually started to happen up 10 basis points since the FED cut which was pretty uh easy to anticipate and we talked about it on the podcast Global Equity risk glove has risen from the August plunge to high neutral levels but is significantly below the extreme Euphoria seen in July which tells me there&#39;s potential room to Rum again cross currents nothing at extremes at present contrarians in China with the crowd elear forward returns for MSC China when China risk love hits Panic which has been now you&#39;ve seen it cases like 1998 you get 54% UPS in the next few months uh 2005 a similar story uh Etc so the only time you got negative was in the middle of uh recessions which was the tech wreck and in the 2008 rest of the time like 2009 up 48% the first three months and then you look out a year later the indices up 60 plus perent 100% in 2005 Etc uh the stimulus will go through and then the sler let&#39;s just take a quick look uh thanks to my buddy for sending that and we&#39;ll just look at some of the big picture chart you can see the 10e yield I&#39;m waiting for a counter Trend move here maybe maybe as high as 4% I I doubt it looks a little over oversold um maybe not if you look at the daily maybe it just holds this trend line but just we&#39;ve already kind of got the counter Trend move that we that I talked about a couple of weeks ago but uh we&#39;ll keep an eye on that S&amp;P breaking out of a cup and handle maybe it goes back and retests at 5655 5651 before resuming the uptrend maybe it keeps going we&#39;ll see the pain trade seems like a grind sideways copper is recovering with China H sang broke out uh now it&#39;s testing that I think it broke through that in the LA today and uh equal weight Industrials breaking out materials breaking out all the stuff that people didn&#39;t want uh here is from Cox Automotive now you know remember the we had that weak month when that they had that computer software train wreck in June and people took the SAR down from 15 157 or 158 down to 151 um now it&#39;s back up to 157 and that was updated yesterday so that&#39;s like a conservative thing if what I think can happen happens uh maybe we wind up with 16 and remember every 200,000 cars is like $3 of earnings once you get above like 158 for Cooper standards so you get $3 of earnings you got a 30 to $50 stock and um you know look who knows what you got but historically they trade between a 10 to 20 times multiple when they&#39;re earning money Chinese you want okay we covered that on to the next China gives rare handouts to boost sentiment for long [Music] holiday um $22 billion set aside for financial direct assistance they don&#39;t do that they&#39;re doing that here&#39;s Jensen Wong selling three qus of a ion buying back stock to buy back his selling after jamming the retail person with tons of stock at the highs at 139 after the split China&#39;s stock market rally may just be getting started no kidding this is by the way by the way this is one of the best writers at Barons but you know up 100% in a in a handful of weeks um but he&#39;s right at it is getting started a little late because like three days ago all the Articles were negative but okay opinion follows Trend Chinese stocks extend gains after beijing&#39;s stimulus bazooka which we&#39;ve been waiting for for a long time Latin America currencies drop on PA F faded China optimis oh yeah so you had the the first monetary stimulus on Tuesday then because it because the it didn&#39;t go up two days in a row uh the headlines got negative and that that was perfect setup for them to rip their face off today what China biggest stimulus since it mean for investors okay um absolute positive Rec rescue

rate vows hedge funds snap up Chinese equities on stimulus optimism they didn&#39;t snap it up on stimulus optimism they snapped it up on short covering because they were all short in the whole second most crowded trade in history so amen the short covers are the first buyers and then they&#39;ll be forced to be natural buyers over time singles day preparation includes 5.7 billion to Aid Merchants

that Lit the kegfire because uh youth unemployment was at 18 and change and they&#39;re like uh no Moss we can&#39;t have these people rioting and have another tenan Square so they were proactive after after dragging it out as long as humanly possible again giving us the opportunity to have twice as much stock at lower prices than we would have had if it wasn&#39;t for them dragging their feet so Christmas card on the way China&#39;s poet burrow supercharges stimulus with housing rate V okay Intel strikes back it has a great chip for the first time in years that&#39;s from today yesterday and I&#39;m I&#39;m thinking they&#39;re talking about the gouty which we&#39;ve been talking about for months um yeah it&#39;s related to their 18a chip manufacturing process which is where the gouty is produced they&#39;re also referring to lunar Lake in this article this is good stuff I mean Cowboys owner full of gas stock market and sentiment results so we went through these Comstock resources up updates every week we like to cover one to two companies we own and or have discussed in previous podcast videoast we&#39;re going to do Comcast this is a natural gas overlaid with Comack um stock and as you can see like 2001 period natural gas or 20 yeah 2001 to 2002 it was natural gas was very low spiked up retested before a huge secular Rally from 2002 to 2007 again and the stock during that time went from about looks like about $10 to $399 over the next seven next five years I don&#39;t know that it&#39;ll go that much there&#39;s a lot more stock NOW however um if you look at proved reserves the market cap of the stock is about 3.2 billion the Enterprise Value is about five or six the proved reserves are worth about the same as the Enterprise Value the unproved reserves are worth another three times the market cap so you know basically you&#39;re getting you&#39;re paying for the approved Reserves at $10 or $11 a share and you&#39;re getting another $30 worth of value that&#39;s not accounted for in the price of the stock because they it&#39;s not reported in the SEC pv10 uh so you know I think on the conservative side over time you probably have a 3540 stock uh over the next few years and um and just as things overshoot on the downside in despondency it&#39;ll probably overshoot on the upside in youforia which probably says 30 uh 50 70 or more and you got a $10 stock so you know uh and I got a good partner in this Jerry Jones keeps buying stock day and night he owns 71% of the equity uh the risk here is that you buy it at 11 and he buys in all the stock or does a tender at 15 or 20 and you only make 50 or 100 100% in a year um because he does an inside deal but you know I can live with that um all right we covered skew you listen to those now Alibaba update all right I didn&#39;t intend to do an update on Alibaba this week as we just did a comprehensive one in August you can see what we said in August at this link here or go to hedge fund tips.com and type in the search bar bobalicious stock market and censorate results fiscal stimulus this week so far okay we covered all that they did the monetary using the mortgage cuts the property down payments the handouts Etc now Baba&#39;s been trading between $65 to $80 most of the year now up 50% that&#39;s when it was $95 yesterday now it&#39;s 105 uh off the lows and 95 and just getting started with G now serious about stimulus to meet 5% GDP growth Target both monetary and fiscal individual cond individual company fundamentals begin to matter again remember we&#39;ve been saying look we were buying it at 2014 prices 10 years later the the only difference is revenues are now up 13x per share cash flow and earnings are up 6 and a half% so revenue is up 1300% earnings and cash flow up 650 price is the same that is a generational lifetime opportunity and that even goes at $105 as much as it went for $80 and $60 a few weeks ago uh you can see here how the business continued to grow despite the despondency cash flow per share earnings per share revenues per share return on Capital return on equity and very interesting time for all these managers to get short China equities uh second most crowded traded we covered this China&#39;s stimulus May rekindle its positive impact on global m one so money supply has been in the doldrums for them and their stock market reflects it down 80% that&#39;s what happens when money supply contracts and now it&#39;s starting to recover and as that liquidity comes in you&#39;re going to see monstrous multiples for individual companies and that&#39;s how we&#39;re positioned now two things to remember regarding Alibaba number one most important part of this week&#39;s podcast ladies and Gentlemen people will doubt and hate the rally all the way up the recency bias around fake outs will have them buying short-term tops and selling short-term bottoms all the way up what does that mean they&#39;ll buy at 105 it&#39;ll pull back to 95 they&#39;ll sell 95 it&#39;ll shoot up to 120 they&#39;ll buy 120 it&#39;ll pull back to 110 they&#39;ll sell 110 it&#39;ll shoot up to 160 they&#39;ll buy 160 it&#39;ll pull back to 140 they&#39;ll sell 140 it&#39;ll go up to 200 they&#39;ll be buying till the cows come home we&#39;ll start laying off some to them it&#39;ll pull back to 150 go up to 220 plus they&#39;ll buy that and over and over and over you watch mark my words this will be what happens and um and that&#39;s that when it becomes a consensus long When Baba becomes a consensus long opinion follows Trend and commentators are uniformly enthusiastic about China and Alibaba we will lighten up we are a long way from that this is in its nent stages in my view when you think about quote this time is different on every pullback pull up this chart we posted in August and sit on your hands or go for a long long walk opinion not advice C terms um now onto the shorter term Market again we&#39;re not yet at an extreme with fear and greed we&#39;re getting closer uh same thing with National Association of active investment managers we are opening next uh we are going to be opening soon for our Q3 opening

weights in the last 60 days revised down 8.5% and 11% so um this may be skewed by one or two companies but uh there will be some opportunity in this pile but that&#39;s a that&#39;s a downward Vision Industrials pretty much flat down 21 basis points for next year it&#39;s probably related to one company so keeping an eye on all of that and now oh very exciting podcast is over now we&#39;re going to shift to ask me anything questions if you don&#39;t want to stick around for ask me anything thank you for tuning in we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place if you would like to tune oh by

spend the rest of the time with Caitlyn and the girls uh but happy to meet for 30 minutes and um I always enjoy meeting uh existing and potential clients on to ask me anything first question Lynn Porter could you look at wgs expected a good 30% this year and 14 next earnings increase 85% you ever buy companies where prices out or near highs even if the earnings power shows great strength being in the forecast usually not um Jean D oh this is this is a train wreck I do not I wouldn&#39;t touch this with a 10 foot pole this looks like a promote What&#39;s this called w g s Gene doctor this is one where you got to be um no stradamus and predict the future what technologies are going to work and uh I mean yeah there&#39;s still NE cash flow negative they&#39;re working their way their revenues are bumpy because it&#39;s all a promote about they&#39;re going to get something approved and it&#39;s going to change the world and sometimes it does but 999 out of a thousand it doesn&#39;t genomics related diagnostic I I have no expertise and no edge here they&#39;re in Stanford I could go visit them but uh uh not for me I mean they&#39;re going to just tell me that it&#39;s great and I know nothing about it and I&#39;m G to take a pass so um yeah pass on that for me um okay Divas lung asks love you podcast what&#39;s your opinion on CH I don&#39;t Market&#39;s betting they&#39;re going to go bankrupt AI will use I don&#39;t like it that textbook business it used to be a great business it might be a cigar butt and get one more puff out of it but uh I think this thing was one of these momo stocks that&#39;s just a train wreck not for me uh even if you get a deadcat bounce here you could probably get a deadcat bounce to 10 but why I&#39;m not I&#39;m not going to play that gamble Tim D thoughts on Celsius Holding stock down 70% uh revenues are expected to grow International expansion on the way I&#39;ve been looking at this one haven&#39;t done anything with it yet they&#39;re mired in a lawsuit um I might be interested but not yet so leave it at that and happy to miss it super happy to miss it um Darnell in Florida can you look at semar uh they&#39;re buying Bitcoin with cash flow to put on balance sheet in place of buying back shares yeah uh I&#39;m just not even going to look at that cumana that because I got to make bets on two things three things I got to make a bet on management I got to make a bet on bitcoin and I got to make a bet on whatever silly promote business that they&#39;re talking about and I&#39;m not interested human pretty beaten down uh this is from Paul Falcone uh looking at it very interesting uh I think it&#39;s probably actionable I&#39;m not going to spend a lot of time going through it because I&#39;ve briefly looked at it so I would say definitely worth exploring and doing the work on Paul Alex Ward love your show from the UK regularly stay up to 1 a.m. to listen what are your thoughts on reverse merger of K brands in Innovation group and Delta uh no interest in that I don&#39;t like reverse mergers and um I&#39;m gonna I&#39;m G to pass uh next Nate Kelsey thoughts on Leslie yeah this is the pool I I I would probably go for pool Corp so these things were huge when everyone was buying pools now they&#39;ve both both gotten smacked um I think I&#39;d wait for pool Corp to show signs of turning around just do the higher quality one Leslie&#39;s a promote you could double or triple your money but you could also go BK if they don&#39;t figure it out um Matt mer C GCT uh does being part of the Russell 2000 mean anything no uh better than not being part of it I guess gct&#39;s already been a 10 bagger and it&#39;s pulling off I I let me take a quick look gigal Cloud technology I have no idea description what do they do end to end BC Commerce e-commerce Solutions a bunch of gobbly I don&#39;t know what that means let&#39;s take a look at the financials all right so the free cash flows turning up um revenues are growing so they must have done an acquisition because they have this um big turn up three balance sheet looks okay uh not my type of business but um probably worth fundamentals look okay worth doing more work but I&#39;m I&#39;m pretty darn sure after I dig into it for an hour it&#39;s going to be a no um I know that you&#39;re not a fan of Walgreens would you put CVS in the same boat they have a little different business I would just stay away from both Life Is Life is hard enough just don&#39;t complicate life with stuff like that thoughts on Corning that&#39;s from from uh Brian David GW not yet I looked at this one uh not for me move on uh Jason says do you think Intel would and should take the merger of Qualcomm I would buy Qualcomm discreetly so if they merge I wouldn&#39;t lose sleep I&#39;d keep the stock I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to happen I don&#39;t think they need them I don&#39;t think they really need anyone other than the government spending them the money they&#39;ve already committed and they&#39;ll be fine they&#39;re turning the corner and this is when everyone&#39;s panicking right when the four nodes in five nodes in four years is done and they got lunar Lake and they got 18a and they&#39;ve got gouty 3 and they got the whole thing so now they just need to cut off the forget the European Factories do the US factories get the US money crank it out and if you got a merge with them great do it I like both stocks so uh I&#39;m perfectly fine with it I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll happen though I think Ginger&#39;s worked too hard to get to where he is is I think he knows he&#39;s at the inflection point and uh who needs it um if you had to pick one of your holding makes you most excited Christmas morning think as a five bagger okay so number one um the ones that have the highest upside potential have the most amount of risk I would warn you guys on two things number one is getting too excited about one stock we always have 8 to 12 companies and we&#39;re running a very concentrated portfolio for very sophisticated Ultra High net worth investors that can handle short-term Vol volatility for long-term outsize rewards um so um so I&#39;m not going to answer that but if you&#39;ve been listening long enough you know which company we have a huge position in that has the most multiple upside and um and the second thing is now that everything&#39;s working all at once uh everyone&#39;s going to get all excited and the next company I talk about they&#39;re going to put so much money in because they&#39;re getting in at the beginning versus after they&#39;ve already doubled and tripled and that&#39;s a huge mistake you need number one to do your own work number two talk to your own financial advisor uh or hire you know uh someone if you&#39;re qualified uh uh and three you need to be Diversified and not all in um uh and do your own homework before you do anything because it&#39;s the win fallacy when you have a hot hand to then you know think you&#39;re invincible and then the next one take double the risk uh you have to have the discipline to constantly be Diversified constantly accept humility and know that as long as your framework is sound you don&#39;t control which one is going to double in six months and which one&#39;s going to take six years uh although thank God they don&#39;t take that long although sometimes it feels like it uh but you you won&#39;t know which ones happen faster than you expect and which ones take a little longer than you expect but in aggregate if your framework is sound you can you can really do exceptionally well in the business so with that I&#39;ll leave it there and I think let me just make sure I&#39;m not missing anyone&#39;s questions here elf no thank you anyone else no oh gen pack I like it I&#39;ve looked at it I did nothing it&#39;s kind of getting away from me only thing that worried me a little bit about it I was looking at it in the low 30s I didn&#39;t do anything it&#39;s like a Consulting business so it&#39;s not as predictable as the businesses I like but U I did like it I wouldn&#39;t buy it up here if it pulls back down to the low 30s I may take a look at there&#39;s a spot in the portfolio but um I already own what I like so but nice find I agree with you um Kyle don&#39;t worry about the correlation to Yuan and HSI just worry about the fundamentals of the business and if you own a good business you just sit on your hands and let it realize intrinsic value and then hit Euphoria and that&#39;s when you lay it off um okay I think we&#39;re done with that said we&#39;ll see you next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one by for now
