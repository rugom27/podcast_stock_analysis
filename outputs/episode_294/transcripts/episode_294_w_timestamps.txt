[0.64s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.8s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.48s] 294th videocast podcast for the week
[7.919s] ending June 5th, 2025. As always, we&#39;re
[11.28s] going to do family first, then we&#39;ll get
[12.719s] right down to business. Mimi and
[14.719s] Annabelle and their respective water
[16.64s] polo teams played in the qualifying
[18.64s] tournament for the South Pacific zone,
[20.4s] which is the most competitive zone in
[21.92s] the nation for water polo. Both girls
[24.24s] had some incredible goals and both came
[26.08s] home with medals and are on to the USA
[28.72s] Water Polo Junior Olympics which will be
[31.359s] held at the end of July. So that&#39;s the
[34.8s] whole fam. Caitlyn, Mimi, Annabelle, and
[38.2s] myself. Uh they&#39;re holding their medals.
[41.76s] There&#39;s Mimi and me. There&#39;s Caitlyn and
[46.039s] Annabelle. Absolutely incredible
[49.2s] weekend. Then we&#39;ll just do two quick
[51.68s] goals and get right down to it here.
[54.559s] First and foremost, here&#39;s Mimi.
[62.719s] That was right under the wire. She just
[65.36s] got in under the clock, which was pretty
[68.24s] darn amazing. And then that&#39;s Mimi. And
[71.439s] then we had Annabelle right here. And
[75.76s] just
[76.88s] [Music]
[81.6s] All right. Doesn&#39;t get any better.
[83.52s] That&#39;s just a sampling or we&#39;ll be here
[85.04s] all night. Uh then I had the pleasure to
[87.759s] join Sean Calibs on CGTN America talking
[92.96s] Musk, Doge, and more. We&#39;re not going to
[95.439s] play this one because it there&#39;s nothing
[97.439s] in it that&#39;s going to make you money.
[99.52s] But if you like politics and policy, go
[102.32s] to hedge funips.com and play the whole
[104.4s] eight minutes. It was definitely
[105.92s] entertaining. Uh then I had the pleasure
[108.799s] today to join Adam Shapiro on his show
[112.159s] called T Talk Anomics with David Nelson.
[115.04s] You know David from Charles Payne. I
[117.119s] often go on right after him. Um and we
[120.799s] got to cover everything how things are
[122.96s] looking right now with the economy. So
[124.799s] we&#39;re going to listen in here. You&#39;re
[126.799s] probably not only recovered, but you
[128.8s] might even be higher than you were on
[130.8s] what did they call it? Liberation Day.
[132.599s] So, with that, let&#39;s bring in my
[136.0s] co-pilot tonight, our returning
[137.52s] champion, David Nelson. He is the chief
[140.16s] strategist at Bellpoint, and we
[141.92s] appreciate you doing uh being here as
[144.08s] always. He&#39;s also the host of the
[145.76s] MoneyRunner. He&#39;s got his own podcast,
[148.08s] his own uh weekly newsletter that you
[150.4s] can get on Substack. So, David, it&#39;s
[152.48s] always good to see you, and I want to
[153.76s] ask you real quick. Sure. Where are we
[156.48s] in this cycle? Because this is why
[158.879s] people pay you and not me.
[162.08s] Uh yeah, we we&#39;ve come a long way since
[164.0s] Liberation Day. We had a a quick move
[166.0s] down. We were probably down about almost
[168.319s] 15% at the lows. Uh and it was an
[171.519s] extraordinary comeback. And as we
[174.4s] learned over the last month, you know,
[176.879s] we&#39;ve always lived in fear that we were
[179.2s] one tweet away from the market being
[180.64s] down a,000 points. But what we learned
[182.8s] in the last couple of months, we&#39;re also
[184.56s] one tweet away from the market being up
[186.4s] a thousand points. And that&#39;s maybe the
[188.319s] lesson learned in the last couple of
[190.08s] months. uh maybe put the rhetoric aside
[193.599s] and and focus on on the knitting, focus
[196.0s] on the companies, focus on the earnings,
[197.92s] and try to put a lot of the politics
[199.599s] beside beside uh outside of your
[201.92s] portfolio. All right. Well, David&#39;s
[204.08s] going to be my co-pilot for the next
[205.92s] hour and our first guest. David&#39;s going
[208.48s] to help me get some insight out of this
[210.36s] individual. They always say you don&#39;t
[212.159s] need an introduction because you&#39;ve seen
[213.519s] David on CNBC, Fox Business, Yahoo
[215.76s] Finance. You&#39;ve seen our next guest on
[218.0s] CNBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg, Yahoo
[220.799s] Finance, the the usual culprits, and
[222.64s] that is Thomas Hayes, the founder and
[225.2s] the uh you&#39;re not only the founder, but
[227.2s] you&#39;re the manager over at Great Hill
[229.92s] Capital. So, it&#39;s good to have you here,
[232.08s] Thomas. It&#39;s good to see you. I haven&#39;t
[233.599s] spoken with you since my days at Yahoo
[235.44s] Finance and Fox Business. So, thank you
[238.08s] for doing this. And I got to ask you,
[239.36s] where do you see us in the cycle right
[240.959s] now? Because a lot of people were
[242.64s] saying, you know, the well, it&#39;s all
[244.64s] over. jump off the cliff. And boy were
[246.64s] they wrong. Yeah, no question about it.
[248.56s] I I&#39;ll tell you. And you had hedge funds
[251.28s] record sellers at the exact wrong time
[254.319s] in early April. Right. The day before
[256.799s] Trump put out now is a good time to buy
[258.639s] stocks. You had them selling a record $1
[260.479s] trillion in equities. So they&#39;re
[262.4s] trapped. You got a lot of trapped bears
[264.32s] that the market&#39;s taken off. And
[266.08s] actually intraday peak to trough was uh
[268.56s] just around 20%. Uh so you have these
[272.0s] guys that didn&#39;t believe it on the way
[273.28s] up, then were praying for a retest that
[275.919s] never came. So every bit of decent news,
[279.28s] you have forced buyers, okay? They they
[281.84s] first you had the shorts that were
[283.68s] covering, then you have now uh forced
[285.919s] people uh really looking to save their
[288.4s] jobs. I mean, they they they sold at the
[290.8s] bottom and now they&#39;ve missed the
[292.0s] recovery. So they&#39;re underperforming and
[294.479s] they&#39;re going to have to buy up. Then
[296.32s] you take earnings growth which came in
[298.56s] at 13.3%
[300.56s] uh uh for the first quarter which was
[303.199s] about double expectations. We&#39;re going
[305.28s] into the second quarter earnings season
[307.68s] expecting 5% earnings growth. You look
[309.84s] at Atlanta GDP now which you take with a
[312.24s] grain of salt but it&#39;s looking like a
[314.24s] recovery after a negative quarter of
[316.16s] GDP. We&#39;re not going to get two
[317.759s] consecutive quarters in a row because
[320.0s] Atlanta GDP is looking at 4.6%. So even
[322.88s] if they&#39;re half wrong, you&#39;re still over
[324.4s] 2% which means no two consecutive
[327.52s] quarters of negative GDP. Uh so you
[330.56s] know, you take the force buyers, the
[332.479s] trap bears, everyone was negative. Uh
[335.199s] you take decent earnings, you take
[336.88s] decent uh Atlanta GDP, and then you
[339.36s] offset it. Talk about crosswinds, Adam.
[342.24s] Uh and David is you&#39;ve got uh the ADP
[346.16s] numbers were a little weak this morning.
[347.84s] So that&#39;s kind of going to put put a
[349.36s] little pressure on the Fed and the big
[351.6s] number is coming out on on Friday with
[354.24s] the non-farmms payroll and and inflation
[356.479s] has been been low. So uh I will end it
[359.84s] with uh Trump saying too late Powell may
[363.199s] prove in fact to be correct. That was
[366.4s] okay. Before I let David jump in here,
[368.24s] just a couple of things. I did some
[369.68s] housekeeping. I&#39;ve got two powerhouses
[371.52s] here who understand these markets far
[373.039s] better than me. So you should be asking
[374.96s] the questions. I know you&#39;re watching on
[376.56s] X right now because we have the count.
[378.4s] All you got to do is put in your comment
[380.24s] in the chat. I&#39;ll make sure that either
[381.84s] Thomas and or David answers the question
[384.24s] you have about where we&#39;re headed and
[386.24s] and what Thomas just said about Too Late
[388.72s] Powell. That was President Trump&#39;s truth
[390.96s] social post this morning about ADP. Um
[394.24s] David, I&#39;m going to throw this to you
[395.68s] with this question. The ADP number, and
[398.96s] I assigned this to my staff. They&#39;re
[400.56s] writing this story overnight for
[402.08s] tomorrow. the ADP number always diverges
[406.24s] from the reality of the labor number
[408.319s] that we&#39;re going to get on um uh the
[410.319s] non-farm payroll number on Friday. So,
[413.28s] is ADP even worth I mean we we we clutch
[416.72s] the pearls Sturman drawn, you know, with
[419.039s] the ADP report, but is it worth
[421.199s] anything? The there&#39;s almost no
[422.96s] correlation between the two. You you
[424.639s] pointed it out correctly. There&#39;s have
[426.08s] been a lot of months where ADP had a
[428.4s] very weak number and then we have a
[429.84s] blockbuster number on on the following
[431.84s] Friday and vice versa. It&#39;s been exactly
[434.56s] opposite, you know, at other times. I&#39;m
[436.639s] not sure which is worse, the ADP numbers
[438.479s] or the BLS numbers because often it&#39;s
[440.88s] not really indicative of what&#39;s really
[442.56s] happening in the in the real economy.
[444.56s] So, I didn&#39;t pay any attention to ADP
[446.72s] this morning,
[448.8s] Thomas. Well, look, I think you got to
[450.96s] you got to pay attention to the trends
[452.56s] and and if you see a really weak number,
[454.479s] even if the number comes in strongish on
[457.28s] Friday, expectations are pretty low on
[459.199s] Friday. 130,000 down from 177,000. So,
[463.12s] all of this opens the possibility for
[465.36s] the Fed to save face. There&#39;s zero, very
[468.56s] low expectations of a cut in June, and
[470.88s] that could be the surprise. Uh 78%
[473.68s] chance of a cut in September. So, that
[475.36s] wouldn&#39;t be a surprise. I I guess this
[478.319s] the market uh shortterm is paying an
[481.68s] awful lot of attention to this. Uh I
[484.319s] guess to some degree the Apple
[486.16s] developers conference to see if they can
[488.08s] get their AI stuff together because
[489.84s] that&#39;s a big waiting in the S&amp;P but uh
[492.639s] le less important than how it&#39;s going to
[494.8s] impact and if you look at the uh beige
[497.199s] book that came out uh demand for labor
[500.24s] is slowing. So you&#39;re you&#39;re seeing it,
[503.039s] you know, look through ADP and start to
[504.96s] look at the beige book and what
[506.24s] businesses are saying and doing less
[509.44s] hours. Uh that could move the Fed&#39;s hand
[512.479s] and enable Powell at the same time to
[514.8s] save face not being look like he&#39;s
[517.12s] pressured by Trump. But you know to say
[519.36s] that you&#39;re data dependent and being 150
[522.24s] 175 basis points too restrictive because
[525.04s] you are predicting tariffs will raise
[528.8s] prices when it simply wasn&#39;t the case in
[531.76s] 2018
[533.44s] uh is not data dependent. They are
[535.44s] prediction dependent and they are
[537.24s] predicting that any tariffs will create
[540.399s] a short-term bump in inflation.
[542.24s] Otherwise they would acknowledge they&#39;re
[543.92s] 150 to 175 basis points too restrictive.
[547.12s] And and I&#39;m not saying this as an asset
[549.44s] owner. I&#39;m saying this you&#39;ve got the
[551.44s] bulk of our population trying to start a
[553.68s] life and trying to buy a house and
[555.76s] simply can&#39;t do it at
[557.399s] 7725 interest rates, record high prices.
[560.72s] Uh and Besson&#39;s got a couple uh uh
[563.44s] arrows in his quiver to deal with
[565.92s] mortgage rates with the uh SLR bringing
[569.04s] down capital requirements for banks this
[571.12s] summer. Maybe the Genius Act will create
[573.36s] some demand for treasuries as well.
[575.6s] bring bring yields down and enable
[577.68s] mortgage rates to get down below 6%
[579.76s] before the end of the year and that
[581.12s] would reignite housing and all ancillary
[583.279s] businesses. But um but but that&#39;s where
[585.76s] we are and and I think I think too late
[588.0s] Powell is a risk. Hopefully the jobs
[589.92s] report will give them cover to act
[592.0s] sooner rather than later. David David,
[595.279s] jump in here with a question. I&#39;m going
[596.56s] to be on the other side. I&#39;m going to be
[597.839s] on the other side of this. I think we&#39;re
[599.04s] worried about the wrong end of the yield
[600.32s] curve. Uh Pal, there&#39;s not a lot
[602.56s] Powell&#39;s going to be able to do for
[604.0s] housing. the only the only thing that&#39;s
[605.68s] going to happen for housing if you get
[607.36s] taking your yields down. And to do that,
[609.04s] you&#39;re going to have to get some kind of
[610.48s] fiscal
[612.0s] uh you know, fiscal sense that we&#39;re
[615.04s] starting to get our debt and deficits
[616.56s] under control. Right now,
[620.04s] uh investors in US treasuries are w
[623.36s] looking at a an interest rate. The juice
[626.16s] on our debt right now, it&#39;s literally
[628.399s] straight up straight up. It is
[630.72s] parabolic. And as long as that exists,
[633.92s] anybody that&#39;s going to want to invest
[636.0s] on the long end of their curve, they&#39;re
[637.519s] going to want some food on their plate.
[639.2s] The auctions will always happen and it
[641.6s] and we&#39;ll be able to sell our
[642.72s] treasuries, but the question is what
[644.32s] price? And at some point in time, you&#39;re
[646.32s] going to be having a conversation not
[647.76s] about five, but about six. Yeah. Well,
[650.56s] look, to the point I made about what
[652.32s] Besson said with the SLR, mortgage rates
[654.88s] are are contingent upon the longer end
[657.04s] of the curve, the 10-year. And what he
[658.8s] specifically said is by removing the the
[660.8s] capital requirements and exempting
[662.56s] treasuries, uh what you&#39;ll see is 30 to
[665.68s] 60 basis points lower in the US 10-year
[669.04s] Treasury yield. So he&#39;s handling it on
[670.959s] that front. Uh whether the stable coin
[673.68s] demand for additional treasuries will be
[675.44s] helpful or not is immaterial. But I&#39;ll
[677.2s] tell you what will be helpful uh on the
[678.959s] long end of the curve is if you continue
[680.88s] to see weakness in the labor market. And
[683.12s] uh and we&#39;re going to find out if that&#39;s
[684.959s] the case on on Friday. But uh but I I I
[688.16s] will say that while mortgage rates are
[691.2s] contingent on the 10-year yield, uh
[693.6s] don&#39;t forget that you have the HELOC
[696.0s] game, you have the uh five-year ARM game
[699.68s] that that is more dependent on the the
[701.92s] shorter end and to get people into the
[703.76s] housing rate uh into the housing market
[705.839s] on interestonies. That&#39;s the short end
[707.76s] of the curve. So Powell can do something
[709.839s] about affordability and instead he&#39;s
[712.0s] taken the uh starter home buyers from
[714.0s] age 33 to age you know 38 39 40 41 and
[717.92s] delaying a lot of people&#39;s lives which
[719.72s] unnecessarily when you look at the
[721.519s] inflation numbers came in
[723.959s] 2.1% PCE price index on Friday and he&#39;s
[727.2s] justifying a 425 Fed funds rate makes no
[730.16s] sense and it should be a buyer market in
[732.56s] the housing market right now because
[733.68s] there&#39;s a ton except in places like
[735.44s] Miami there&#39;s a ton of housing now that
[737.519s] is on the market waiting for those
[739.519s] buyers. I someone mentioned the word
[741.2s] debt. That was David. So, let&#39;s get to
[743.12s] the debt issue because I saw on Truth
[745.44s] Social today something that just made me
[747.04s] laugh. I&#39;ve interviewed Elizabeth
[748.56s] Warren. I&#39;ve interviewed President Trump
[750.8s] uh back years ago. And those two agree
[754.56s] they agree that it&#39;s time to eliminate
[757.839s] the uh the borrowing cap, the debt cap
[760.959s] uh in Congress and just have unlimited
[763.2s] borrowing power. What do you think,
[765.6s] David? I I I would eliminate the the
[767.839s] cap. It&#39;s a meaningless exercise. We we
[770.32s] bump up against this and we go through
[771.92s] the wranglings of it, you know, a couple
[774.32s] of times a year sometimes and it it&#39;s
[776.56s] meaningless. We&#39;ve already approved this
[778.399s] spending. You know, this spending was
[780.399s] already passed by Congress. Having in
[782.88s] there as an arbitrary stopping point, it
[786.24s] it it&#39;s nice to think that it&#39;s a cap.
[788.639s] It&#39;s not a cap. Has it ever worked?
[790.24s] We&#39;ve had a cap for the last half
[791.76s] decade, for the last decade, and it
[794.079s] hasn&#39;t done anything. So I I would say
[796.72s] push it aside. On that front, I guess
[798.72s] I&#39;m on the same side as Elizabeth as
[800.639s] Elizabeth and uh and Donald Thomas,
[803.68s] would you get rid of the cap? Yeah.
[805.12s] Look, I at the end of the day, we need a
[807.36s] little bit of what what people are
[808.959s] missing here is we&#39;re not getting out of
[811.2s] this 120% debt to GDP uh by austerity.
[815.2s] Okay, that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to happen.
[816.48s] And what Powell&#39;s missing here is uh
[819.2s] austerity is going to create a bigger
[821.279s] debt problem and create a lot of
[822.959s] defaults. What happened the last time we
[824.72s] were in this situation post World War
[826.24s] II? 120% debt to GDP. What did they do?
[829.2s] You had uh growth and you had above
[831.92s] trend inflation from 1948 uh to
[835.12s] basically 1958. Debt to GDP came down
[838.079s] from 120% down to 63%. And you did that
[841.68s] with a little bit above trend, 3 to 5%
[843.839s] inflation. You did that with lower
[845.76s] rates. Uh and you let the economy run
[848.48s] super hot. And with the deregulation
[850.56s] that this administration has on its
[852.48s] plate, the the tax cuts that they&#39;re
[854.56s] proposing, and by the way, it&#39;s
[856.32s] interesting when you actually go through
[858.24s] the thousands pages of the big beautiful
[860.72s] bill versus what the CBO and the media
[864.32s] is reporting about the bill. Uh the the
[866.959s] math is that uh the overall federal
[870.0s] budget baseline is smaller than the
[872.32s] current budget uh when you subtract
[874.959s] everything the bill unfunds from what
[877.6s] remains. Uh, okay. So, you know, throw
[879.68s] it if you don&#39;t have a uh, you know,
[881.44s] three days to read a thousand pages,
[883.44s] throw it into three different AI models
[885.519s] and they&#39;ll come out with that result.
[887.199s] And the one that doesn&#39;t anthropic that
[890.079s] that comes up with all the negative
[891.68s] headlines about the bill uh,
[893.6s] acknowledges if you dig deeper that they
[895.72s] are drawing their conclusions on the
[898.48s] basis of media headlines versus the text
[901.76s] document itself. And when you force it
[903.6s] to go back to the text document, it
[905.36s] comes up to a similar uh conclusion
[908.0s] which is the baseline is smaller than
[909.76s] the current budget when you back out uh
[912.0s] everything the bill unfunds from what
[913.68s] remains. So uh I I you know very few
[917.04s] people read the thousandpage bill and
[918.56s] that&#39;s why the negative headlines can
[920.16s] continue to fly because it&#39;s it&#39;s easy.
[923.04s] We know that Marjorie Taylor Green
[924.399s] didn&#39;t read it. She admitted that. But
[925.839s] hey, real quick, um, just want to remind
[927.76s] everybody we&#39;re getting this this data,
[929.76s] this information from David and Thomas
[932.16s] for free. David again has his podcast
[934.24s] and his newsletter, the the MoneyRunner.
[936.56s] Thomas has hedge fund tips with Tom
[938.639s] Hayes and and you can check this out at
[941.199s] his website and I believe you have where
[943.36s] the money is going. But I want to find
[945.279s] out where Elon Musk is going because
[947.68s] Elon Musk, talk about biting the hand
[949.6s] that fed you. And I realized he fed the
[951.36s] Trump administration or at least the
[952.8s] campaign hundreds of millions in
[954.759s] donations. But Musk is coming out
[957.36s] against BBB, the big beautiful bill, the
[959.759s] tax bill. Uh we&#39;re talking about debt
[962.0s] and he&#39;s calling it a calamity. I think
[963.92s] the CBO came out with its score that
[966.399s] it&#39;ll add 2.4 trillion to um debt uh to
[970.639s] the national debt over the next 10
[973.399s] years. And the reason I bring this up is
[977.199s] how does this land? How do you get
[978.8s] Republicans to line up and pass this
[981.199s] thing if you&#39;ve got Elon Musk saying
[984.48s] don&#39;t go there, Thomas? Yeah, look,
[986.72s] Elon&#39;s one of the most brilliant
[988.399s] entrepreneurs and creators in our
[990.0s] lifetime. He&#39;s he&#39;s the Thomas Edison of
[992.079s] our day. He&#39;s a genius. All of that
[993.68s] stuff. Okay. The fact of the matter is,
[995.839s] you know, he&#39;s also been out on Twitter
[997.519s] at certain times in the stock market and
[999.279s] called for a huge crash that never came
[1001.519s] uh and record highs. I mean, just
[1002.959s] because someone&#39;s brilliant and a
[1004.24s] billionaire doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re
[1005.36s] brilliant at everything that they do. uh
[1007.68s] you know, I&#39;m I&#39;m good at one thing,
[1009.279s] picking stocks. If you ask me about
[1011.279s] Bitcoin, and I and I offer an opinion,
[1013.519s] well, shame on you for listening to me.
[1015.04s] That&#39;s not what I do. That&#39;s not in my
[1016.48s] lane. Um now, that said, he&#39;s got a
[1019.44s] tremendous amount of experience having
[1021.6s] headed Doge for 130 days and cutting
[1023.839s] $175 billion of cost, $1.5 billion a
[1027.36s] day. At that pace, they could cut a
[1028.799s] trillion within a year and a half.
[1030.48s] They&#39;ve taken the ex Doge employees and
[1033.12s] made political appointments in every
[1034.959s] agent. So the the headline that it&#39;s
[1037.6s] going to be part of the DNA of
[1039.039s] government under this administration is
[1040.799s] not fluff. It&#39;s true. Uh and I think
[1043.439s] they will actually fulfill on a lot more
[1045.52s] cuts than than advertised or than is
[1047.919s] expected. So he has a lot of heft when
[1050.32s] he says that. I don&#39;t think he has a
[1052.799s] thousand hours to read it. But I can
[1054.32s] guarantee you if he fed it into Grock,
[1056.24s] which is probably one of the best AI
[1057.919s] models, which is his model, uh he&#39;d come
[1060.4s] to slightly different conclusions. At
[1062.64s] the end of the day, it&#39;s got to get
[1064.64s] passed. Okay? And we&#39;re not going to
[1068.08s] we&#39;re not going to balance it on a
[1069.52s] mathematical equation. The only way
[1071.039s] we&#39;re going to have a possibility of
[1072.799s] balancing it is if this economy runs hot
[1075.12s] as hell. And the only way they&#39;re going
[1076.72s] to run this economy hot as hell is is
[1079.88s] growthled strategies, massive
[1082.24s] deregulation, bringing down the capital
[1084.24s] requirements for banks, increasing
[1086.08s] lending, bringing down rates, and hoping
[1088.4s] for the best. hoping you know look there
[1090.32s] there is a faith that inflation doesn&#39;t
[1093.12s] get out of control and the recency bias
[1095.2s] of the last three years is oh watch out
[1097.039s] for inflation but that was a one-time
[1099.919s] you know supply shock that we had
[1101.76s] because the world shut down for two
[1103.28s] years and people keep extrapolating with
[1105.36s] recency bias that because it happened
[1107.36s] during a once in aundred year event it&#39;s
[1109.28s] guaranteed to happen and then you&#39;ve got
[1110.88s] the Arthur Burns nonsense from the 1970s
[1113.679s] which is a completely apples to orange
[1115.919s] comparison you know as they say in Texas
[1118.08s] that old dog don&#39;t hunt. So, uh, so I
[1121.12s] would suggest, uh, you know, that that
[1123.52s] we look at history clearly and look past
[1126.559s] the 70s and look to the 50s, the last
[1128.799s] time we were in this situation, 120%
[1131.919s] debt to GDP, and follow that playbook,
[1134.88s] which I do think the administration,
[1136.559s] minus Powell, is attempting to do uh,
[1139.679s] and we&#39;ll we&#39;re going to be just fine.
[1142.64s] What do you think, David? I I think you
[1145.36s] know the truth doesn&#39;t live on the
[1146.96s] extremes and and we have two extremes
[1149.039s] here. Uh yes uh the growth will solve a
[1152.72s] lot of problems but there&#39;s a balance
[1154.24s] here and if you go back to to to World
[1156.559s] War II post World War II and the growth
[1158.96s] that we had after that you got to
[1160.24s] remember where the entitlements were at
[1161.76s] the t at that time when FDR came up with
[1164.4s] social security the average life
[1166.4s] expectancy was 57 years old. No one was
[1169.12s] going to collect. Today it&#39;s a different
[1171.039s] equation and it&#39;s growing exponentially.
[1173.2s] As for Elon Musk, I think what
[1175.28s] frustrates Elon is he is the legislative
[1178.24s] process and he&#39;s a CEO. He&#39;s used to
[1180.96s] coming into a company, seeing the
[1182.799s] problems, identifying them, and fixing
[1184.88s] them quickly. Unfortunately, Congress
[1187.52s] doesn&#39;t work that way because
[1189.559s] politicians have competing priorities.
[1192.799s] Uh fixing the country, that&#39;s second on
[1195.76s] their list. The first thing is bring
[1197.44s] home the bacon and uh bring what what&#39;s
[1200.48s] what they need to do uh to get
[1202.48s] reelected. And that means bringing home
[1204.16s] legislative priorities that either bring
[1207.44s] projects to their district or protect
[1209.84s] themselves in the case of Medicaid. I
[1211.84s] can understand why Lisa Marowski, Susan
[1214.0s] Collins, and those they&#39;re never going
[1216.16s] to embrace anything in in the Medicaid
[1217.919s] cuts because the Democrats are going to
[1220.24s] use it uh against them and they&#39;re
[1222.08s] vulnerable. And that&#39;s the problem with
[1223.84s] the legislative process and it&#39;s why we
[1225.679s] end up with these big giant bills that
[1228.159s] are nothing more than a big giant
[1230.039s] compromise. But I agree the only
[1232.559s] solution here is we got to get the bill
[1234.4s] through. So let me ask the two of you my
[1237.2s] favorite question these days. Imagine
[1239.52s] you&#39;re 25 years old and you have 10,000
[1242.24s] bucks and you have to invest it. David,
[1244.48s] first, how would you allocate that given
[1246.88s] everything we&#39;re now facing? Where would
[1248.64s] you put that money to work? Well, if
[1250.08s] you&#39;re 25 years old, you&#39;re totally
[1251.76s] riskone. There&#39;s no such thing as a
[1253.44s] balanced portfolio. You don&#39;t you don&#39;t
[1254.799s] put it in treasuries. You&#39;re going to
[1256.48s] you&#39;re going to look at where the
[1257.44s] secular trend is at the moment. And
[1259.28s] that&#39;s clearly AI. That&#39;s the bright
[1261.919s] spot spot of this economy is clearly the
[1265.039s] biggest uh technological shift,
[1268.08s] technology shift in my lifetime. It will
[1271.2s] be the driver of capital investment for
[1273.28s] the next 10 maybe 20 years. So, that&#39;s
[1276.159s] where you would put your money right
[1277.44s] now. And you would just put it in there.
[1279.039s] you would forget about it. You&#39;d forget
[1280.48s] the volat volatility and just hang on.
[1284.0s] Thomas, all right, I take a different
[1285.76s] side. Uh, I think they&#39;re going to bring
[1288.4s] down the longer end of the curve as as
[1291.52s] advertised. I think that&#39;s going to be
[1293.36s] really exceptionally good for housing.
[1295.28s] Now, look, Adam, they call me turnaround
[1297.28s] Tom for a reason. I&#39;m always buying
[1298.64s] things that are out of favor and waiting
[1299.919s] for them to recover. So, what&#39;s what&#39;s
[1301.44s] dramatically out of favor as a function
[1302.96s] of rates being high is uh housing and
[1306.24s] housing related businesses. So, I don&#39;t
[1308.559s] want to deal with the waring factions. I
[1311.039s] don&#39;t want to buy Dr. Horton. I don&#39;t
[1312.64s] want to buy PY, but I do want to buy the
[1315.36s] building suppliers like QXO, uh, which
[1319.36s] Brad Jacobs is running as a rollup. He
[1321.679s] put $900 million of his own money. Uh,
[1324.799s] he did that in, uh, XPO Logistics in
[1328.24s] 2011. You basically made, you know, many
[1331.2s] bags like 69, 79 times your money over a
[1334.64s] period of 10 years. He did United
[1336.96s] Rentals, the equipment leasing in the
[1338.88s] late 90s. You basically made over 50
[1341.039s] times your money if you had invested
[1342.48s] with him over 15 years. And uh and he&#39;s
[1345.2s] doing a new one and and he&#39;s put a lot
[1346.88s] of his own money in it. He started with
[1348.799s] Beacon Roofing, you know, uh does a lot
[1351.28s] of commercial roofing. If your roof
[1353.2s] leaks, it&#39;s not a, you know, should we
[1355.039s] get the pink one or the blue one? Uh
[1357.12s] should we shouldn&#39;t we? It&#39;s like fix my
[1359.28s] roof, you know, I want the water out of
[1360.96s] my living room. And uh that&#39;s a great
[1362.72s] business. He paid 10 times IBIDA, but
[1364.4s] he&#39;ll do what he always does is bring in
[1366.64s] technology. He&#39;ll double IBIDA over the
[1368.64s] next few years and we&#39;ll be off to the
[1370.559s] races. He expects as usual, it&#39;s an $800
[1373.679s] billion business. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll roll up
[1376.0s] about 50 to 80 billion topline with
[1378.96s] double digit EBID margins, which
[1381.12s] effectively means your $16 stock will be
[1384.159s] 70 80 90 $100 uh probably five, six,
[1387.84s] seven years out. So AI or not, I don&#39;t
[1390.64s] think you&#39;re going to get too many five
[1392.24s] to seven baggers over the next handful
[1394.0s] of years with a proven winner who
[1395.44s] constantly makes money for his
[1396.72s] shareholders. And then if you want more
[1398.48s] subdued things, doubles and triples in
[1400.559s] the next few years, you buy something
[1402.4s] like a Generrack, which is tied to
[1404.32s] housing and interest rates, uh leader in
[1406.96s] home standby generators. It sounds
[1409.039s] silly, but with power outages going up,
[1411.6s] with data center backups on the
[1413.84s] commercial side, uh, and with home
[1416.0s] building, which is going to boom again
[1417.679s] with this administration, by the way,
[1419.28s] because they&#39;re going to open up about
[1421.2s] 500, it would take about
[1423.88s] 512,000 acres of public land uh, of the
[1427.44s] the tens of millions in order to uh, get
[1430.96s] 3 4 million new starter homes. So, you
[1434.08s] know, some of the areas are actually in
[1436.559s] rural, but actually quite a few are of
[1438.64s] the federally owned lands are, as people
[1441.2s] don&#39;t know, in metropolitan areas. So,
[1443.2s] they&#39;re going to open up the federal
[1444.24s] lands. Besson&#39;s going to change the
[1446.559s] capital requirements at banks to create
[1448.159s] a tremendous amount of demand for
[1450.08s] treasuries. Maybe you get the Genius Act
[1452.72s] legislation. And uh if you&#39;re Gen Z, you
[1455.44s] realize that the biggest part of portion
[1457.12s] of the population is uh the millennials,
[1459.919s] 72 millennials. They&#39;re in their
[1461.44s] mid-30s. They want to buy houses, they
[1463.6s] just can&#39;t. We need to build a bunch of
[1465.6s] 1500 square foot houses. Think Levittown
[1468.32s] post World War II versus not everyone
[1470.88s] needs a 4500 ft starter home with an
[1473.52s] indoor pool uh which is what the supply
[1475.84s] is in the market right now. So they need
[1477.6s] to uh rectify that imbalance. The
[1480.159s] administration knows this. They are
[1481.76s] taking the actions to do so. So I would
[1483.84s] play that theme. Uh I&#39;m not discounting
[1486.32s] AI. AI is going to be an unbelievable
[1488.24s] secular theme. So you&#39;re going to want
[1489.44s] to have some exposure. Question is how.
[1491.36s] But I think in terms of the next three
[1492.799s] years doubling and tripling, there&#39;s a
[1494.48s] lot of opportunity because some of these
[1495.76s] stocks are down 70 80% and the
[1498.24s] businesses are throwing off record free
[1499.84s] cash flow. I just did an interview with
[1502.48s] an analyst at my other, you know, my
[1504.559s] other job and we were talking about
[1507.12s] because of AI demand for electricity and
[1509.52s] where the investment opportunities are
[1511.039s] with grid build. Um, some people you saw
[1513.76s] the meta deal yesterday with nuclear,
[1516.72s] but what this individual was saying was
[1518.48s] NAT gas. Listen, everyone stand by.
[1520.72s] We&#39;re going to take a quick break and
[1522.24s] when we come back we&#39;re
[1523.88s] gonna and we&#39;re back and this is how you
[1527.84s] can follow Adam Shapiro if you like his
[1529.76s] show on
[1531.679s] uh X Twitter. AJ Shaps and there you go.
[1536.08s] Uh wanted to cover a couple of things.
[1538.72s] Here is a chart. This is bullish
[1541.76s] percent. We covered a lot. You could see
[1543.84s] many of the sectors are are um towards
[1546.559s] the top end of the range. I do think on
[1549.919s] balance with fits and starts this this
[1551.96s] this rally should continue through
[1555.0s] midsummer. Uh there&#39;s a lot of strength
[1557.279s] in the rally but some groups like
[1559.679s] staples bullish percent staples you can
[1562.159s] see is uh at the lowest level among the
[1565.2s] other sectors at 40%. And today we&#39;re
[1568.799s] covering ironically two staples uh which
[1572.799s] is going to be exciting. So, telecom is
[1575.36s] down there. Transports have had a move.
[1577.919s] Uh, utilities are down there. Got to see
[1580.559s] if there&#39;s any utilities to do. I don&#39;t
[1582.72s] think so yet, but Staples is an area I
[1585.12s] want to focus on. A lot of them gotten
[1586.559s] beaten down.
[1591.64s] Um, you can see some of these others
[1593.919s] have moved to the top of the range. And
[1595.36s] healthcare, staples, healthcare, all the
[1597.039s] defensives. And you know, we covered
[1599.76s] defensives relative to discretionary are
[1603.2s] uh and defensive positioning are at very
[1605.679s] low levels. So you you do want to have
[1607.52s] some of these if we hit some volatility.
[1609.6s] Uh and uh in the case of Hormell, they
[1612.4s] they&#39;re a dividend aristocrat, so you
[1614.159s] get paid almost 4% while you wait. We&#39;re
[1616.48s] going to cover that later today. Peter
[1618.72s] Lynch, time is on your side when you own
[1621.84s] shares of superior companies. Warren
[1624.559s] Buffett, look at market fluctuations as
[1627.52s] your friend rather than your enemy.
[1629.76s] Profit from folly rather than
[1631.44s] participate in it. It&#39;s amazing to see
[1634.799s] uh with, you know, uh Alibaba has been
[1638.08s] down a few points on the China
[1640.24s] uncertainty. They&#39;re supposed to talk on
[1642.08s] Friday. We&#39;ll see. Um and Cooper
[1645.36s] Standard on a couple of uh the steel
[1647.6s] tariffs and a couple of other things.
[1649.36s] And with those two down, the the
[1651.2s] portfolios just keep going up and up and
[1653.2s] up. and wait till those two two things
[1654.96s] rip back higher where we&#39;re going to be
[1657.039s] a super super exciting time to be in the
[1659.279s] markets and again super hats off for
[1661.84s] everyone who came in in the hole and
[1663.679s] everyone who added money in the hole and
[1666.32s] uh and still a lot more to do uh and
[1668.96s] we&#39;re going to talk about some uh as you
[1671.76s] heard with Adam
[1673.72s] Shapiro and I and we didn&#39;t cover it
[1676.72s] with Sean Caleb&#39;s but uh uh the housing
[1679.76s] theme and we&#39;ve covered that a lot QXO
[1682.48s] Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Generrack, etc.
[1685.2s] These things haven&#39;t even left the
[1686.96s] starting line. Yeah, they&#39;re up a little
[1688.559s] bit, but compared to where they&#39;re going
[1689.919s] to be. Uh so, a lot of exciting things.
[1692.399s] And we we spent a lot of time in the
[1695.039s] last week adding to some of our our uh
[1698.399s] specialized derivative overlays on those
[1700.399s] positions so that when they turn and how
[1703.039s] they turn and one material stock in
[1704.88s] particular um these things are all going
[1707.6s] to be between four and some of them are
[1710.559s] set up for expected value of 8x. So
[1713.2s] we&#39;re excited about that. Um Dallio, if
[1717.12s] you&#39;re not aggressive, you&#39;re not going
[1718.24s] to make money. That&#39;s why we do the
[1719.679s] derivative overlay special for our
[1721.279s] clients. If you&#39;re not defensive uh by
[1723.6s] using low leverage uh like we do with
[1726.48s] our clients, you&#39;re not going to keep
[1727.84s] money. So, it&#39;s a it&#39;s a balance of both
[1730.48s] uh quantified risk with high expected
[1732.799s] value coupled with a strong rockolid
[1737.2s] um concentrated portfolio of great
[1739.919s] businesses that we would want to own the
[1741.6s] whole business in each case. Sloomer,
[1744.559s] let&#39;s take a look at the charts from my
[1746.52s] buddy. You know who you are.
[1750.72s] Okay, let&#39;s take just broad
[1753.799s] overview. Okay, you can see the market&#39;s
[1756.48s] come back a lot, but not really
[1759.76s] overbought here on a weekly. You know,
[1761.76s] this thing has some room to run. That&#39;s
[1763.279s] why I think I do think I mean I know you
[1765.44s] got Tom Lee out calling for 6,600. Um,
[1769.12s] and this thing Fibonacci extension looks
[1771.36s] like 6,900. Question is when, you know,
[1774.48s] by the end of the year, I don&#39;t know.
[1776.72s] But certainly uh I think this thing
[1778.96s] wants to push to new highs particularly
[1780.799s] because the rest of the world is at new
[1782.64s] highs. So the S&amp;P kind of has to play
[1785.12s] catch-up and that&#39;s why I think we&#39;ve
[1787.039s] got more to go into mid July. Um
[1790.24s] advanced decline line is showing showing
[1792.32s] real strength. This is not yet
[1794.159s] overbought. The the uh the uh
[1797.039s] bearishness is not washed out and the
[1798.96s] bullishness is nowhere near euphoria. So
[1801.919s] I think we&#39;ve got more to do. The small
[1804.24s] caps I think is going to be huge
[1805.6s] opportunity. The 493 by the way by
[1809.88s] January 1st quarter 2026 will be the
[1814.08s] first time that the 493 earnings growth
[1817.279s] overtake the MAG7 earnings growth at
[1820.72s] 10.3%
[1822.799s] uh estimated earnings growth in Q1 uh
[1825.76s] versus 10.2% 2% for the Mag 7 and that
[1830.399s] is down big from
[1833.799s] um you know MAG 7 was at
[1836.919s] 33% growth. So by
[1840.279s] Q1 and and that is down from so Q that&#39;s
[1844.159s] just in one year Q1 of this year max 7
[1846.96s] was
[1847.96s] 27.7 and um 493 was 9.4% 4% earnings
[1853.159s] growth one year from one, you know, now
[1856.32s] it&#39;s three quarters from now. Uh that&#39;s
[1858.88s] going to flip and 493 will be better.
[1862.159s] And that&#39;s where there&#39;s that&#39;s why
[1863.36s] there&#39;s still so much incredible
[1864.64s] opportunity that will evaporate very
[1866.24s] very quickly. Uh I think if you&#39;re not
[1868.48s] in in the next, you know, six, seven
[1871.2s] weeks, you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going to
[1872.399s] miss a huge amount. Uh yeah, there will
[1875.84s] be like uh some groups that have been
[1878.72s] highf flyers that will get smashed and
[1880.399s] you might be able to buy them, but
[1883.96s] um that&#39;s the story there. Uh
[1888.0s] international equity outperformance is
[1889.679s] still going, record
[1891.48s] buybacks. Uh and the other thing I
[1894.08s] wanted to cover with regard to
[1897.519s] uh treasury yields and I touched on it
[1901.2s] with Adam about the SLR
[1906.0s] uh lowering capital require or exempting
[1907.96s] treasuries from banks having to hold
[1910.399s] capital against it. So the demand for
[1911.919s] treasuries would go up, 10-year yield
[1913.44s] would go down, real estate takes off.
[1915.44s] That&#39;s going to happen this summer. Then
[1916.96s] the other thing which I hadn&#39;t really
[1918.48s] spent a lot of time on because it&#39;s not
[1920.08s] my world although PayPal is is pretty
[1922.64s] big in stable coins uh and a good and my
[1925.519s] friend from Dubai was saying you know
[1926.88s] PayPal could be a play on stable coin I
[1928.799s] I agree I hadn&#39;t that that&#39;s just
[1930.799s] whipped cream like all the whipped cream
[1932.08s] you have in Baba that&#39;s not my core
[1933.6s] thesis but uh it could be big but what&#39;s
[1936.64s] bigger than that is if the Genius Act
[1938.399s] goes through it not only helps PayPal it
[1940.88s] helps uh massive demand for US
[1943.279s] treasuries because the stable coins is
[1946.799s] uh two and a half 250 billion market cap
[1950.0s] right now it could reach two trillion
[1952.24s] that means there&#39;ll be 1.75 trillion
[1954.88s] excess demand for US treasuries which
[1958.159s] will compress yields which will get it
[1960.159s] get all the debt refinanced at the same
[1962.08s] time getting massive growth tax cuts
[1964.0s] deregulation etc.
[1966.36s] Um, and if you actually uh put the big
[1970.399s] beautiful bill into uh the AI model of
[1973.919s] your choice, chat GBT, etc., what you&#39;re
[1976.159s] going to find is actually the bill is
[1978.72s] much more fiscally
[1980.279s] responsibility responsible than uh
[1983.2s] either the CBO, which has never been
[1984.88s] right about anything, or uh the negative
[1988.799s] headlines you&#39;re seeing all day. Uh, as
[1991.2s] it relates to Musk, I I said my piece on
[1993.2s] that with uh with Adam
[1996.0s] um did a huge service to the country uh
[1998.64s] in terms of cutting costs, but uh he&#39;s
[2001.2s] not a market prognosticator. Uh never
[2003.84s] has been and he has uh made a lot of bad
[2006.72s] calls over the years as it relates to
[2008.24s] the stock market as it relates to
[2009.6s] building businesses and and changing the
[2011.36s] world. No one&#39;s better uh and and no one
[2013.919s] can hold a candle to him. But in ter
[2015.6s] term as far as market stuff goes, uh
[2018.0s] that&#39;s not been his strong suit. So
[2020.399s] here&#39;s a huge opportunity. record short
[2022.96s] interest, record flushing, selling on
[2025.279s] small caps. Just hang in there. It&#39;s
[2027.2s] It&#39;s been building this monstrous base
[2029.84s] for three years, four years now. I think
[2032.559s] this is going to break out and it&#39;s not
[2034.08s] going to look back and it&#39;s going to be
[2035.2s] so massive, you can&#39;t even imagine. So,
[2037.84s] uh, we&#39;re loading up there. Uh, UK, same
[2041.279s] story. That&#39;s GXO. Hang Sang went back
[2044.32s] to retest this line. My guess is based
[2047.039s] on how things are set up, they&#39;ll, you
[2048.96s] know, fits and starts. they&#39;ll get some
[2050.8s] type of agreement or they already kick
[2052.32s] the can to August. Now, uh once they get
[2055.359s] some sense of positive news, this could
[2057.679s] just rip rip higher to new highs, which
[2060.159s] would take Baba with it back over 150
[2063.119s] and uh off to the races. So, we&#39;re
[2065.2s] excited about that. Whether it happens
[2067.679s] this week or in a couple months, I have
[2069.44s] no idea. But I will say uh Ishwinder
[2073.76s] sent me these two things. I&#39;ve covered
[2075.839s] these seasonality charts in the past. I
[2078.24s] kind of forgot about them. But if you
[2080.48s] look at the seasonality of China, Kweb,
[2083.679s] uh June is the best month of the year.
[2086.0s] And same for Alibaba,
[2088.56s] uh June is uh June, the back half of the
[2091.2s] year is the is the biggest time for uh
[2095.119s] Alibaba share price seasonality, and
[2097.44s] that&#39;s the 8-year basically
[2100.56s] uh 8-year range. Uh, so that could be
[2105.119s] pretty good. And it kind of coincides
[2106.8s] with Xi talking with Trump, who Trump
[2110.56s] said he&#39;s always liked and always will.
[2113.04s] So, um, I mean, that&#39;s probably a good
[2115.28s] way to sit down to dinner with that type
[2117.76s] of framework in mind. Yield starting to
[2120.32s] come back down. Dollar, uh, record, you
[2124.0s] know, hasn&#39;t been this low since, uh,
[2126.76s] 2021, basically early 2022. Uh, that
[2130.56s] theme continues to play out.
[2132.0s] International continues to outperform.
[2134.0s] The looney is breaking out. I told you
[2136.079s] my lovely Canadians, my buddies. Uh, you
[2139.359s] lost a little faith here with the
[2140.88s] overshoot. This is called dispondency.
[2142.88s] This is called Euphoria. We&#39;re headed
[2144.8s] back to Euphoria, ladies and gentlemen.
[2146.48s] It&#39;ll in fits in starts. It&#39;ll happen.
[2148.72s] Energy definitely looks like it&#39;s
[2150.0s] putting in a base. Comtock, it just
[2151.839s] won&#39;t stop. I mean, that thing is off to
[2154.16s] the races.
[2155.96s] Um, and there you go. I mean again I
[2159.44s] haven&#39;t found anything that&#39;s like super
[2161.04s] compelling if you gun to my head
[2163.2s] Hallebertton and Slumber but gun not to
[2165.52s] my head so I&#39;m not doing it.
[2168.119s] Uh then uh I I I think they&#39;re just
[2172.839s] better return on dollars invested in
[2176.24s] materials right now. Uh so that&#39;s where
[2179.119s] I want to be beat down and in housing
[2180.8s] and rate sensitive stuff and stuff that
[2182.72s] like I just know is a slam dunk. Whereas
[2185.48s] energy, it just the EMPs have not come
[2188.8s] down enough for for me to get doubles
[2190.64s] and triples with my eyes closed. So, uh,
[2194.32s] you know, we&#39;re already on a triple
[2196.079s] with, uh, comtock and I think we got a
[2198.4s] lot more to go there. Uh, so, so that&#39;s
[2201.359s] how we&#39;re expressing it and we&#39;re
[2202.88s] perfectly content with
[2204.839s] that. Let&#39;s take a look at some of
[2207.2s] these.
[2212.32s] I think all these go back to the top of
[2214.0s] the range as I&#39;d said, but with earnings
[2215.68s] decelerating by twothirds, earnings
[2217.92s] growth rate decelerating by 2/3, I think
[2220.24s] top of the range is going to be it for a
[2222.8s] while. And I think the 493 with
[2225.359s] accelerating earnings are going to
[2226.96s] continue to uh catch up and then
[2230.76s] exceed like the you know Caterpillars
[2233.68s] here, Packar, that&#39;s interesting.
[2240.16s] Amgen health care looking for more
[2242.32s] health care ladies and gentlemen I keep
[2244.24s] uh thinking about Fizer&#39;s pipeline is
[2246.8s] looking more and more attract attractive
[2248.8s] good dividend yield I don&#39;t like the CEO
[2250.72s] but
[2253.64s] um what else we got
[2258.119s] here that&#39;s that all right let&#39;s go down
[2261.44s] to the rest of the charts here
[2267.64s] Um, this
[2273.4s] one is from Allen. You know who you are.
[2277.04s] Consumer sentiment index and subsequent
[2278.96s] 12-month returns. We haven&#39;t had
[2281.04s] consumer sentiment this low since uh
[2283.64s] 1975, 1980,
[2287.72s] 1990, 2008 lows, 2011 lows, and 2022
[2293.8s] lows. Uh and each subsequent time, the
[2297.119s] next 12 months, you had 12 20 plus on
[2300.16s] average 20 plus% returns. whether it was
[2302.64s] 17, 15, 22, 29, 20, and 22 each time,
[2308.4s] it&#39;s a positive thing. Uh, Atlanta GDP
[2311.76s] now has shot up to 4.6% GDP for Q2. Even
[2317.04s] if they&#39;re half right, uh, you&#39;ve got
[2320.56s] uh, recession off the table because you
[2322.48s] don&#39;t have two consecutive quarters of
[2324.48s] negative GDP growth. By the way, thanks
[2326.48s] for all the orders and support on the
[2328.48s] merch. I know we sold out of the golf
[2330.48s] shirts. I think they should be back in
[2332.079s] store. Just keep checking. Got my
[2334.48s] beautiful mug
[2338.04s] here. And send in more pictures. I know
[2340.56s] a lot of you guys are shy about the
[2341.839s] pictures. We&#39;ll get you on the website.
[2344.24s] You can see some of the other folks uh
[2346.56s] who already did that, which we
[2348.16s] celebrated last week. Um M2 Money
[2350.8s] Supply, very difficult to be bearish
[2352.4s] when M2 money supply is back at an
[2355.04s] all-time high. It just overtook the high
[2357.839s] reached in April 2022 peak. People
[2361.68s] continue to flush out of Japanese
[2363.64s] equities.
[2366.2s] Um defensives as a percentage of the
[2369.28s] S&amp;P, lowest since 2000. That was a great
[2372.24s] time to buy defensives. So, we&#39;re going
[2374.079s] to cover two today. Uh Hong Kong
[2376.56s] listings through May, the highest since
[2379.04s] 2021. The game is back on. in China
[2382.24s] equities, foreign inflows to US equity
[2384.48s] funds annualizing at 138 billion. So,
[2388.079s] uh, and income needed to buy a home by
[2390.32s] state. This is really interesting. Uh,
[2392.72s] with New York, Montana, Washington, and
[2396.64s] California being the highest income
[2398.88s] required just to buy a
[2402.16s] uh, three-bedroom home. Unbelievable.
[2405.44s] You need to earn $210,000 to buy a
[2407.76s] simple threebedroom home in California.
[2411.76s] Um I I said my piece with Adam on uh
[2417.04s] Powell needs to do something and he
[2419.68s] needs to do it quickly and we need a
[2421.52s] little bit of inflation in order to uh
[2424.4s] outgrow debt to GDP and get back to 60
[2427.839s] 50 60% like we did post World War II.
[2431.119s] Uh, and that&#39;s that percentage of stocks
[2433.68s] that outperform the S&amp;P 500 index. That
[2437.92s] is now starting to come
[2444.119s] back. S&amp;P 500 is on track for its
[2447.04s] biggest monthly gain in May since
[2449.8s] 1990. That was so exciting to
[2452.16s] experience. Even years that gained 20%
[2455.04s] have a bad
[2456.359s] day. Uh, okay. That must have been on a
[2460.079s] bad day that he put that out.
[2462.119s] Dietrich, what do we got
[2464.28s] here? Earnings growth, as I said, was
[2466.64s] 13% expected to be 5% next quarter.
[2471.8s] Um but estimates holding up 300 still
[2475.2s] for next year which is
[2477.8s] 19.3 times next year&#39;s earnings which is
[2481.04s] the 5-year average
[2485.4s] is I&#39;m sorry 19.9 times 2026 earnings as
[2490.24s] of today. 5-year average is 19.9 times.
[2493.92s] Dollar weakness continued to be ahead a
[2496.24s] tailwind for S&amp;P earnings in the second
[2499.04s] half and for international stocks.
[2502.319s] Buyback announcements at a record 665
[2504.8s] billion. So all of this traders are now
[2506.8s] starting to plow into TLT. So that&#39;s
[2510.48s] good to see. Uh 28% of homes sold above
[2514.72s] final listing
[2516.359s] price. Okay. Not in Florida and Texas.
[2519.28s] Those markets are softening up a little
[2520.96s] bit. Uh that&#39;s
[2524.68s] usually
[2526.28s] a precursor for the rest of the country.
[2529.599s] Um the amount of supply and sellers
[2533.359s] versus buyers is now like a 500,000
[2536.0s] point spread. 500,000 difference. I
[2538.24s] think it&#39;s 1.5 million sellers to 1
[2540.8s] million buyers. Uh so that should put
[2543.28s] some pressure on prices.
[2547.96s] Uh,
[2550.2s] okay. No clear relationship between
[2553.2s] level of bond yields and equity returns.
[2554.88s] Data since 1940. That&#39;s from Robert
[2557.04s] Schiller and Goldman Sachs. That&#39;s
[2559.28s] interesting. But if you do value versus
[2560.72s] growth, it starts to matter. Bankruptcy
[2562.319s] filings are down. Credit card
[2564.24s] delinquencies are up though.
[2568.04s] Um, hedge funds were net sellers again.
[2572.359s] institutions were net sellers and retail
[2575.04s] were net buyers.
[2580.68s] Uh very very similar to the 2022 lows.
[2584.16s] They bought the dip and they&#39;ve been
[2585.599s] right since uh co pretty
[2590.76s] much. Despite improved sentiment,
[2593.2s] aggregate equity position was largely
[2594.96s] unchanged and overall remains light
[2596.8s] skewing the pain trade to the upside.
[2600.079s] So they&#39;ve got
[2611.56s] um they
[2619.24s] have the risk parody ones are the last
[2621.839s] ones to flip. They always get it wrong.
[2625.96s] Um, retail portfolio weights in MAG 7
[2629.2s] have been
[2633.48s] declining European stocks beat US by the
[2636.16s] most on record ever. Okay. And that was
[2639.52s] our big theme. Remember last four fourth
[2641.839s] quarter, listen to all the podcast, I
[2643.359s] said international. It was very hard to
[2645.28s] say when they they underperformed so
[2647.119s] dramatically last year. Now they&#39;ve
[2648.56s] outperformed uh by a record amount.
[2651.44s] Chinese firms see more just domestic
[2653.119s] revenue amid tariff
[2655.079s] risk automotive sales volume 2025. So
[2658.72s] everyone&#39;s saying oh it&#39;s a big drop um
[2662.48s] since last month but if you look year on
[2664.319s] year it&#39;s a big jump and that will
[2666.64s] continue. Treasury debt buyback
[2669.28s] paramount accepted. So you&#39;re seeing the
[2671.28s] Treasury now in the market. We&#39;re going
[2672.48s] to cover that in a second. Prime Book
[2674.48s] Global E equities there were sellers in
[2676.4s] the hole. Now they&#39;re massive buyers.
[2679.28s] That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s over. They
[2681.44s] always have to catch up and then you get
[2683.28s] months and months of follow
[2685.0s] through. Uh data centers empowered large
[2689.52s] large projects EV battery. Okay. Uh bull
[2692.96s] bear sentiment. You can see here this is
[2694.96s] not yet extreme. That&#39;s why we continue
[2697.04s] to think this is going into midsummer. I
[2700.0s] think August, September, we&#39;re going to
[2701.839s] get some chop. But um the next, you
[2704.92s] know, eight weeks is going to be a great
[2707.359s] opportunity.
[2708.88s] uh average daily equity flows versus the
[2711.92s] S&amp;P performance. All right, we skip
[2714.88s] that. Here it is. 500,000 more sellers
[2717.839s] than buyers. That&#39;s a huge huge
[2720.44s] spread. Last time you saw that was
[2724.44s] uh 2014 and 2015.
[2737.68s] Okay, so here is Ray Dallio&#39;s history of
[2740.48s] debt crash is imminent. Uh in 19 in 2015
[2745.52s] he said this is a 1937 repeat. We&#39;re
[2748.079s] going to crash. 2016 he said we&#39;re at
[2750.64s] the end of the dead cycle. Two
[2754.92s] uh I really don&#39;t like doing these type
[2757.28s] of charts to be honest with you. I mean
[2758.96s] the guy&#39;s made a ton of money. Obviously
[2760.96s] he&#39;s gotten a few things very very right
[2763.44s] and done an incredible job and put out a
[2765.68s] nice book. But you can see here over the
[2768.56s] last 12 years he&#39;s been negative every
[2771.119s] step of the way. And
[2773.96s] uh I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re wrong for 10
[2776.24s] years. Does that make you right? If
[2777.52s] you&#39;re right the you know 17th time you
[2779.839s] called for the end of the world and the
[2781.2s] market&#39;s up 400% in the interim. I I
[2783.52s] don&#39;t know. But
[2785.96s] um that&#39;s that you know this is just
[2788.48s] data. This is just one more data point.
[2790.24s] So when he goes on TV, by the way,
[2794.119s] um, who had that out? Um, Seth did. This
[2799.04s] one again, another absolute legend. But,
[2802.0s] you know, as as people get older, they
[2804.24s] get more defensive.
[2806.319s] And
[2811.24s] um he
[2813.16s] posted, Seth posted um Paul Tudtor Jones
[2817.28s] at the absolute lows in April saying the
[2820.48s] market was Here we
[2821.96s] go. Here we go. May 6, 2025. Paul Tudtor
[2827.2s] Jones says stock market will hit new
[2829.2s] lows even if Trump cuts China tariffs to
[2832.0s] 50%. Okay, so here&#39;s a guy who probably
[2835.839s] sold in the hole on April 6th and 7th
[2838.88s] and a month later the things rallied up
[2841.04s] and he&#39;s begging for a retest and it
[2843.2s] just never came and it&#39;s going to
[2844.319s] continue to push higher. It doesn&#39;t make
[2846.079s] him it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the
[2848.16s] guy&#39;s a legend and he made a fortune for
[2850.56s] himself and for his investors early in
[2853.119s] his career just like uh Ray Dallio did.
[2855.76s] They&#39;re both absolute legends. But just
[2858.24s] because they&#39;re billionaires doesn&#39;t
[2860.16s] mean they&#39;re right about everything. And
[2861.599s] what happens is, and the reason I&#39;m
[2863.44s] spending any time on this because I do
[2865.68s] admire what these guys accomplished,
[2871.56s] um, is that, you know, when
[2874.359s] they&#39;re when when you become that
[2877.28s] successful, their fingers are off the
[2879.119s] pulse or they&#39;re just it it I I just
[2882.8s] seen it over and over. you get to a
[2884.72s] certain age, you get very pessimistic
[2886.88s] and defensive and there&#39;s a chronic
[2890.72s] amount of
[2892.92s] um well, it was good when I was coming
[2895.359s] up, but now everyone else is screwed.
[2897.04s] And I think that&#39;s the way people deal
[2898.48s] with death. They just say, well, I was
[2900.48s] lucky to, you know, be in when I when I
[2903.52s] was in everything was great and you
[2905.28s] could make money. Now everyone&#39;s
[2907.4s] screwed. There&#39;s never been a better
[2909.359s] time in history to be starting out than
[2911.28s] right now. The fact that you can get on
[2913.28s] a device like this and communicate to a
[2915.76s] million people at once at basically zero
[2917.839s] cost if you have something valuable to
[2919.52s] say um never existed before. So the
[2922.559s] future&#39;s extremely bright. the fact that
[2924.16s] you can go into Grock or uh Chat GPT and
[2927.599s] put in a thousandpage uh beautiful build
[2930.16s] document and actually come out with a
[2932.4s] real summary, a substantive summary that
[2934.88s] you could make decisions on in, you
[2937.04s] know, 5 minutes uh versus spending 5
[2939.52s] days reading the thousandpoint bill and
[2942.319s] not being um influenced by fake
[2945.2s] headlines about how bad it is when in
[2947.359s] fact uh it&#39;s actually a very decent
[2950.64s] bill. And and I think unfortunately Elon
[2953.2s] Musk should put the bill into Grock
[2955.04s] because Grock is absolutely amazing and
[2957.2s] really understand what&#39;s in it. I&#39;m sure
[2958.96s] it could be better. I I agree with him.
[2960.88s] I&#39;d love to cut everything, but we&#39;re
[2962.559s] not going to get to uh if you cut as
[2965.76s] much as you think you to balance a
[2967.44s] mathematical equation and you leave out
[2969.599s] the most important factor, which is grow
[2971.119s] and inflate your way out of debt, you&#39;re
[2972.88s] going to have a depression. You know,
[2974.48s] you should be much more afraid of
[2977.359s] deflation and depression by cutting too
[2979.839s] much than a little bit of above trend
[2982.0s] inflation like you had from 1948 to 1958
[2984.96s] when they brought down debt to GDP
[2986.64s] through massive growth policies from 120
[2989.44s] down to 63. So,
[2992.2s] um, so anyway, tangent but worthwhile
[2995.92s] one. Uh, percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks
[3000.319s] outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the
[3002.079s] calendar year. So, this is starting to
[3003.52s] pick back up. Stock pickers paradise.
[3006.079s] More clues. The bulls are in charge.
[3008.319s] Performance after 5% in May. 12 months
[3011.359s] later up 19.9% which is consistent with
[3014.0s] the first chart we sold showed on
[3016.24s] consumer confidence. Slowing in April
[3018.64s] spending is likely payback after the
[3020.64s] tariff front running. That&#39;s natural.
[3022.8s] Same with cars. Dollar&#39;s relationships
[3024.96s] to US yields has broken down. That&#39;s
[3027.839s] when we play catchup. So, you&#39;re either
[3030.319s] going to have the yields catch down or
[3031.76s] the dollar catch up. Uh, I wouldn&#39;t be
[3034.0s] surprised if they kind of meet in the
[3035.28s] middle a little bit in the short term on
[3036.72s] the dollar, but I&#39;d be more inclined to
[3039.44s] expect yields to catch down with the SLR
[3042.88s] change and possibly the stable coin
[3045.119s] demand. China sending goods to US
[3047.839s] through Vietnam. I mean, I talk, look, I
[3051.92s] talk to
[3053.559s] uh friends that manufacture stuff and
[3056.64s] they&#39;re just like, you know, we&#39;re just
[3059.68s] the only ones that are winning are the
[3061.119s] shippers. We just send to a different
[3062.72s] country and it gets to where it gets to
[3064.96s] and that&#39;s how it works. So, this is
[3067.839s] kind of just nonsense. five-year rolling
[3070.24s] returns of USMCA uh MSCI USA minus
[3075.16s] MSCI world XUS versus US dollar index.
[3078.64s] So, as you can see, US, you know,
[3084.52s] again, international outperforms in
[3086.88s] Reagan&#39;s second term, then US
[3089.44s] outperforms under Clinton, then
[3091.359s] international outperforms under Bush,
[3094.0s] then uh US outperforms under Obama and
[3097.2s] Biden and first term of Trump. And then
[3099.76s] I think we&#39;re getting to the point where
[3102.44s] uh like Reagan uh international is going
[3105.52s] to outperform for the next four years.
[3106.96s] It&#39;s not because America&#39;s lost its
[3108.4s] exceptionalism. We&#39;ll always be the
[3109.76s] innovators. We&#39;ll always be the
[3110.88s] creators. We&#39;ll always be the biggest
[3112.92s] GDP. Uh all of that stuff certainly in
[3115.839s] our lifetimes. But um as far as equity
[3118.88s] performance, we pulled forward a lot.
[3120.24s] Now it&#39;s it&#39;s going to change and and
[3122.079s] that&#39;s that. Uh value stocks in versus
[3125.28s] international stocks. Manufacturing is
[3127.28s] currently just 8% of US
[3130.52s] jobs. Public construction spending is
[3133.44s] picking up. Here&#39;s the
[3137.48s] buybacks. Record announcement of
[3139.68s] buybacks, highest since
[3153.24s] 2018. That long endow Jones futures is
[3156.4s] starting to rise.
[3165.2s] third time we have most hated rally
[3167.2s] since 2020. And what
[3171.0s] uh Tom Lee is pointing out
[3174.599s] here. Here we go. Right at the top here,
[3177.92s] twothirds of fund managers say stocks
[3179.92s] are still in a bare market. They doubled
[3181.599s] again the next 18 months. Here, stock
[3184.559s] market just made the same mistake again.
[3186.079s] Here&#39;s why experts are worried about the
[3187.52s] latest rally. And then it doubled again.
[3190.0s] And here we go. We can see a new low
[3191.68s] relative to the April low. says fair
[3194.16s] leads Katie Stockton and we&#39;ll probably
[3197.119s] break out from here and double again.
[3198.64s] So, uh S&amp;P 500 after rallying from eight
[3203.599s] negative 18% below its 502- week high to
[3207.359s] negative3% below its 52-
[3210.599s] week that should be low to high
[3215.359s] uh within 50 days. One year later,
[3217.28s] you&#39;re up 20%. Again consistent with DRI
[3220.0s] numbers consistent with the um sentiment
[3224.839s] numbers extended is the market
[3227.2s] leadership for US equities come to an
[3228.8s] end for now. So this is uh a theme. So
[3232.24s] we just covered the US versus
[3233.68s] international going back to
[3234.72s] international
[3235.72s] outperformance and we are dealing with
[3243.29s] [Music]
[3245.4s] um another version of that with Europe
[3249.44s] out outperforming
[3250.839s] US covered the GDP
[3257.319s] now realized and consensus EPS growth
[3260.88s] for select
[3262.079s] US equity
[3263.96s] indices.
[3266.839s] Uh 2025, the Russell 2000 small caps
[3270.48s] already have 18% earnings growth versus
[3273.839s] the S&amp;P 500 at 7, I guess, blended. Not
[3278.319s] sure how they get to that. I guess year
[3279.76s] to date
[3282.44s] um estimated for next year
[3286.2s] is looks like about 13% on the S&amp;P for
[3290.52s] 2026. Well, we can just figure that
[3293.4s] out.
[3295.4s] 300 divided by 265 is 13%. Wow, I&#39;m
[3299.44s] pretty good at that.
[3301.559s] Um, and then next year for the Russell
[3304.8s] 2000, if you&#39;re not in small caps, with
[3308.28s] record short interest and expected
[3312.839s] 36% earnings growth with a mid- teens
[3316.16s] multiple, um, I don&#39;t know what else to
[3318.72s] tell you. Take up another hobby, but
[3320.72s] small caps are the place to be. Yeah,
[3323.04s] it&#39;s taking a while. You&#39;ve got this
[3324.64s] multi-year base, but this is going to be
[3326.4s] a beast. uh gap between S&amp;P 500 implied
[3330.64s] dividend yield and bond yields is even
[3333.4s] larger.
[3336.52s] Uh
[3343.88s] okay. Yeah, they dominate earnings
[3346.4s] growth, but look at the deceleration.
[3349.599s] It&#39;s unbelievable these headlines.
[3351.52s] Here&#39;s from Yahoo Finance. Magnificent 7
[3354.079s] are still dominating earnings growth.
[3355.68s] really they&#39;re going from 35% earnings
[3358.16s] growth last year
[3360.68s] to 9% earnings growth by Q3 of this year
[3364.799s] and then they&#39;ll they&#39;ll top out around
[3366.72s] 10% and the unmagnificent 493 are
[3370.64s] reacelerating from effectively flat back
[3374.079s] to 10% uh in the same time period and
[3377.359s] you can pay you
[3379.799s] know 3/4 2/3 to 3/4 of the multiple
[3385.359s] uh for more earnings growth and everyone
[3388.799s] else is looking in the rearview mirror
[3390.64s] versus through the
[3392.359s] windshield. Consumers expect a change in
[3394.72s] inflation rates. So that&#39;s that&#39;s up.
[3397.28s] That&#39;s usually the the peak. Here&#39;s the
[3399.28s] S&amp;P fighting with the 6,000 back to new
[3402.319s] highs. I think we&#39;re going to push
[3403.44s] through in coming weeks or days. Uh 2025
[3406.799s] is the Rocky Balboa
[3408.68s] market. Unsold. I mean, this is
[3411.04s] unbelievable. The market&#39;s only up 22
[3413.52s] basis. What is this? Oh, average return
[3417.599s] after a down day. I see. Unsold housing
[3419.92s] inventory is worth a
[3422.04s] record 698 billion. So, there&#39;s a lot of
[3425.52s] supply there. Uh there&#39;s 331 billion
[3429.52s] worth of stale inventory lingering on
[3431.359s] the market. That&#39;s US homes for sale.
[3433.28s] This is all Powell. All Powell. And you
[3435.76s] can tell me, look, if Powell lowered if
[3438.16s] if Powell lowered to the inflation rate,
[3440.64s] which is neutral, he&#39;s almost 200 basis
[3443.599s] points too restrictive right now. Um,
[3447.04s] you&#39;d have a whole proliferation of
[3450.72s] 7-year arms based off short rates. So,
[3452.799s] everyone says, &quot;Yeah, 30-year fix or
[3454.4s] based off the 10-year, but you&#39;d have a
[3456.4s] whole bunch of option arms at um, you
[3459.839s] know, five year, sevenyear to get these
[3461.52s] kids in the houses interest only. They
[3464.16s] could, you know, as their income go,
[3465.52s] they could get into a 30-year fix. Uh,
[3468.0s] and it would be unbelievable for the
[3470.24s] country and the building and the
[3471.52s] construction. I mean, you want to you
[3472.96s] want to talk about you forget about
[3474.76s] manufacturing iPhones and t-shirts in
[3477.119s] America. That&#39;s just stupid. But what we
[3479.599s] manufacture in America is houses. Okay?
[3482.4s] So, you get that game back on, the
[3484.64s] amount of jobs you&#39;re going to see is
[3486.4s] through the roof. The trades, the jobs,
[3488.24s] these are all highpaying uh skilled
[3491.04s] trade jobs. That&#39;s manu. We manufacture
[3493.52s] houses. That&#39;s what we do in America.
[3495.119s] So, we got to get the immigration back
[3497.76s] up, which is down. I&#39;m not talking
[3500.079s] necessarily uh illegal. I&#39;m talking
[3502.319s] legal, but open the gates. You don&#39;t
[3504.4s] have to charge people $5 million. We
[3506.799s] don&#39;t want a bunch of lazy trust fund
[3509.28s] people coming into our country. We want
[3512.28s] hungry, smart, hungry people who want to
[3516.0s] work and most of them will start
[3517.68s] businesses and employ a lot of people.
[3519.76s] That&#39;s what made America great and that
[3521.68s] was what will continue to make America
[3523.68s] great. Not a bunch of people uh writing
[3526.4s] $10 million checks for a Trump gold card
[3528.72s] and uh and sitting around uh
[3532.68s] uh drinking Dagio spirits. I
[3536.04s] mean that&#39;s not what we need. I mean it
[3538.48s] won&#39;t hurt us but it&#39;s not going to help
[3539.76s] us. Flows into foreign doiciled US
[3542.16s] equity ETFs
[3544.96s] uh down. So that&#39;s that&#39;s uh showing
[3547.68s] that global equities breaking out to new
[3553.799s] highs. Dollar short position stays close
[3556.319s] to highest since
[3559.16s] 2023. Mag 7, they&#39;re unwinding. Carry
[3565.079s] trade index of carry trade returns hit
[3568.48s] seven-year high in May.
[3571.839s] S&amp;P 500 trails the rest of the world by
[3574.24s] the most since 1993. Guys, go back to
[3576.88s] our Q4 podcast. Every single week we
[3578.96s] were saying international. It was so
[3580.96s] unpopular. And here we go. Uh, and
[3584.16s] that&#39;s that with the data. Uh, we
[3587.2s] covered that. Let&#39;s go through some of
[3588.72s] the headlines. Alibaba JD.com sales
[3591.68s] surge during 618 shopping festival on
[3593.76s] the back of subsidy program. Uh, action
[3596.88s] in Hong Kong equity market stirs most
[3598.88s] excitement in years. This game is just
[3600.4s] starting, guys. I had someone DM me,
[3602.88s] &quot;This is so hard to to hold.&quot; Then don&#39;t
[3605.44s] hold it. I I don&#39;t know what to tell
[3607.599s] you, but uh uh if you know what you own
[3610.799s] and you understand the company and
[3612.4s] you&#39;ve done your work, it&#39;s just uh
[3616.079s] there&#39;s nothing to really think about.
[3617.68s] All right. Mainland Chinese households
[3619.28s] set to buy another hundred billion
[3620.559s] dollars of of Hong Kong stocks. Remember
[3623.599s] the stock connect? Well, we said that
[3625.44s] and now it&#39;s happening. China consumers
[3627.359s] are spending in smaller cities. It&#39;s the
[3629.2s] power of the new middle class. Trickle
[3631.28s] of global inflows and Alibaba being the
[3633.92s] toll taker. 404 40 cents of every dollar
[3636.48s] of e-commerce. China is the biggest
[3638.24s] e-commerce country in the world. Trickle
[3640.16s] of global inflows to Chinese stocks
[3642.24s] could become a flood, says Cambridge
[3644.079s] Associates. Even after recent gains,
[3646.96s] China and Hong Kong stocks are still
[3648.48s] attractive versus US equities firms.
[3650.559s] Asia head says. Uh Ford reports 16%
[3653.92s] sales increase in May amid employee
[3656.04s] pricing, i.e. incentives, ladies and
[3659.04s] gentlemen. We&#39;ve talked about that since
[3660.799s] May 2022 when we put on the position at
[3663.52s] the low fives and now it&#39;s at 21 uh and
[3667.44s] just getting started. Proposed new auto
[3669.52s] loan tax deduction could help buyers get
[3671.92s] a break on interest payments. This is a
[3674.799s] big deal. Proposed new auto loan tax
[3677.76s] deduction could help buyers get a break
[3679.2s] on interest payments.
[3684.44s] Um there you go. Boeing to resume
[3687.52s] airplane deliveries to China next month,
[3689.68s] ramp up max production. CEO says, &quot;We
[3691.839s] love that. We took profits on all of our
[3693.92s] options last week at huge multiples. And
[3697.28s] uh we didn&#39;t sh sell one share of stock,
[3699.76s] nor will we for many for a long time to
[3702.64s] come. Boeing 737 max production tops 38
[3705.52s] jets per month for first time in years.
[3708.0s] Uh how Lilo and Stitch became one of the
[3710.48s] most profitable movies in years.
[3712.48s] originally was aimed for Disney Plus,
[3714.4s] but it was rerouted to a theatrical
[3716.319s] release and is on pace for at least 950
[3718.64s] million in ticket sales. How you doing,
[3720.64s] Disney? Is Treasury versus the Fed with
[3723.52s] the Fed sidelined? Bessent unleashes a
[3725.839s] record$10 billion bond buyback. You can
[3729.04s] read that at zero hedge. Feds daily
[3732.04s] still Fed&#39;s daily says still comfortable
[3735.119s] with two rate cuts in 2025. We agree
[3739.28s] whether it starts in June or September.
[3741.359s] September&#39;s at 78% chance. June would be
[3745.119s] possible if we got a a very weak report
[3747.599s] on Friday. Not holding my breath, but
[3749.839s] that uh that could be a catalyst that
[3752.48s] takes uh takes this rally parabolic to
[3754.799s] new highs into July. Um the end of easy
[3759.359s] US stock bet has been good to
[3762.44s] contrarians. More money flowed into long
[3765.52s] ignored diversification bets away from
[3768.319s] the
[3769.319s] US. Wall Street re sees deeper route as
[3772.96s] dollar nears 2023 low. Hedge funds buy
[3777.04s] stock at quickest pace since November
[3779.559s] 2024. Force buyers uh continue to come.
[3783.28s] That&#39;s from Goldman Sachs. That&#39;s what
[3784.96s] we&#39;ve been warning about since the lows.
[3787.119s] Uh warning in a good way and benefiting
[3789.76s] from in a better way. AI data center
[3792.24s] boom requires a lot of natural gas. How
[3794.16s] you doing comtock? Buy defensive stocks.
[3796.4s] You&#39;ll be glad you did. This from Jacob
[3798.079s] Sonenshine. Great article. We agree. Uh
[3801.2s] and that&#39;s the sector that hasn&#39;t yet
[3803.039s] caught up. So um let&#39;s talk about two of
[3805.599s] them. What the consumer wants, stock
[3807.119s] market and sentiment results. We&#39;re co
[3809.52s] covered Hormeell and
[3812.52s] Disney. Uh you can see the free cash
[3814.88s] flow here is doing great. They&#39;ve got
[3816.96s] plenty of runway. Gross margins are
[3818.96s] picking back up. They had a few
[3820.64s] missteps, but this stock will eventually
[3822.96s] double. And in the meantime, you collect
[3824.64s] 4%. Oh, and by the way, uh they they&#39;ve
[3828.16s] grown the dividend every single year.
[3831.039s] They uh for over 25 years, and we&#39;ll get
[3833.44s] into the details here. So, both
[3835.76s] companies we are covering this week are
[3837.2s] classic examples of what we like to call
[3839.44s] buying straw hats in the winter. In
[3841.28s] other words, these are highquality,
[3843.2s] durable businesses that we buy when they
[3845.2s] are temporarily impaired on the
[3846.559s] operating table. And time and time
[3848.4s] again, they miraculously leave the
[3850.4s] hospital walking on their feet, not
[3851.839s] lying on their backs. In the meantime,
[3853.52s] we sit on our hands, collect our
[3854.88s] dividends, and wait. Hormemell fits this
[3857.039s] description to a tea. This is a company
[3859.44s] that has been a compounding machine
[3861.119s] since 1891. Not 1991, not 2001, 1891. If
[3867.28s] you think this is the first cyclical
[3869.28s] draw down Hormel has seen in its 130
[3871.44s] year plus history, think again. The
[3873.76s] story this time is that consumers no
[3875.92s] longer want packaged or processed food.
[3878.0s] Legacy products are being left behind as
[3880.079s] demand perhaps with a shot of GLP1 in
[3882.48s] the arm shifts towards lean. I think
[3884.64s] they put those in the ass, but anyway,
[3887.039s] uh shifts towards lean high protein
[3889.039s] diets. That trend is music to Hormell&#39;s
[3892.079s] ears. Over the past couple of years,
[3894.319s] they have effectively pivoted to
[3895.839s] becoming a branded protein ccentric
[3897.92s] powerhouse. More than 60% of sales now
[3900.319s] come from meat and protein richch foods.
[3902.48s] Jenny Oo is the number one ground turkey
[3904.559s] brand. Applegate is a leader in premium
[3906.559s] organic meats. Planters continues to
[3908.64s] grow as a protein richch snack brand.
[3910.319s] All three are shooting the lights out
[3911.76s] and gaining share. Just listen to
[3913.44s] Hormell&#39;s recent earnings calls. Uh and
[3915.599s] by the way, you forgot about spam. Uh
[3918.72s] everyone in Hawaii eats spam. You can
[3920.88s] have this sushi made with spam. It&#39;s
[3923.119s] incredible. This quarter, my kids eat
[3925.359s] it. They know what it&#39;s actually called.
[3927.119s] Uh this quarter, management said the
[3930.24s] sushi with the spam because uh one of
[3932.4s] them doesn&#39;t. One of them only eats
[3934.24s] cheeseburgers and chicken. Her sushi is
[3936.48s] the spam with rice. I don&#39;t The other
[3938.96s] one will eat I mean unbelievable. She&#39;ll
[3941.599s] eat uh sashimi and you know she was
[3944.64s] eating sashimi when she was like nine.
[3946.319s] She orders more sophisticated things
[3947.92s] than than we do.
[3950.119s] Um okay. This quarter management said
[3953.68s] the word protein 15 times. Last year it
[3956.0s] was 12 times. Two years ago just four.
[3957.92s] They are leaning into the trend and are
[3959.52s] arguably one of the best ways to play
[3961.28s] it. Management is expecting a strong
[3963.2s] second half driven by, you guessed it,
[3964.64s] the core protein brands. Meanwhile, they
[3966.48s] are on track to deliver over 250 million
[3968.48s] in operating income growth by 2026 as
[3971.44s] they work to restore margins to
[3973.119s] historical levels. The way we see it,
[3974.88s] you have strong topline growth fueled by
[3976.88s] protein obsession, a margin inflection
[3978.799s] on deck, and a stock trading at a
[3980.72s] historic trough multiple. Give it a few
[3982.319s] more quarters like Q2, maybe say protein
[3984.319s] a few more times, and the stock should
[3986.079s] eventually earn a rerating and be back
[3987.92s] to fresh highs within the next two to
[3990.0s] three years. Until then, we&#39;re happy to
[3991.839s] sit tight and collect a near 4% dividend
[3994.24s] and growing, by the way, off our basis
[3996.559s] while we wait. So, you can go through
[3999.119s] all the sales numbers and stats. I think
[4002.24s] um you know, topline growth growing,
[4004.64s] margins increasing, reacelerating,
[4006.799s] perfectly targeted for what the consumer
[4009.28s] wants, 59 consecutive years of dividend
[4012.76s] increases. So, I mean, this is like what
[4015.119s] Buffett did with Coca-Cola. He now gets
[4018.0s] more dividends than his basis every
[4020.88s] single year uh when he bought it in
[4022.96s] 1989. The dividend keeps increasing. He
[4025.599s] bought it at a basis when it was in a
[4027.44s] draw down and uh now he gets more
[4031.76s] dividends
[4033.28s] uh per year than he originally spent on
[4035.76s] buying the stock. And that&#39;s what
[4037.119s] happens with these type of compounders.
[4039.28s] 96 plus years of dividend payments
[4041.44s] without interruption through the great
[4043.2s] depression, through the great financial
[4044.96s] crisis, etc. So you can see uh the
[4048.0s] Applegate growing and all these other
[4049.839s] things.
[4051.16s] Um what else are we looking at
[4053.88s] here? You can go go through the
[4056.079s] conference call. We&#39;ve highlighted all
[4057.44s] the important parts for you to really
[4059.76s] understand what you own. Uh and then
[4062.319s] Dagio. Okay, here&#39;s another stock in it
[4064.72s] down 50%. Uh same thing during the uh uh
[4069.28s] tech wreck in 2000 and during the great
[4071.359s] financial crisis in 2009. always
[4073.839s] recovers along with cash flow over and
[4076.4s] over. Same story. Cash flow declines, it
[4078.88s] recovers. Cash flow declines, it
[4080.319s] recovers. Re revenues have already
[4082.319s] increased. Now they&#39;re going to get the
[4083.68s] cash flow. Gross margins are starting to
[4085.44s] inflect. It&#39;s all right in front of you.
[4087.839s] This thing will be a double over the
[4090.079s] next few years. Uh and um just as Horell
[4093.92s] has been priced like packaged foods are
[4095.76s] a thing of past. By the way, they&#39;re
[4096.88s] buying in a ton of stock.
[4099.279s] uh down from 700 and basically
[4102.839s] 690 million ADRs outstanding to now 550
[4106.719s] million going down to 525. Just as
[4109.359s] Hormell has been priced like a packaged
[4110.96s] foods are a thing in the past, Diagio
[4112.96s] stock has been cut in half and is
[4114.799s] trading as if consumers will never sip
[4116.48s] alcohol again. We&#39;re more than happy to
[4118.48s] take the other side of that trade. Yes,
[4120.08s] consent consumers may be drinking a bit
[4121.92s] less, but the trend is clear. drinking
[4123.6s] less but drinking better. And no one is
[4125.6s] better positioned to benefit from the
[4126.96s] long-term global premium premiumization
[4129.279s] trend than Diagio with an
[4130.719s] industryleading portfolio of 200 plus
[4132.56s] brands spanning every category and price
[4134.719s] point. Once again, the market has fallen
[4136.319s] victim to recency bias extrapolating
[4138.239s] postcoid softness into a permanent
[4140.48s] impairment across the entire industry.
[4142.239s] But zooming out, DAIO&#39;s history tells a
[4144.719s] much different story. Every 5 to 10
[4146.319s] years, you see a cyclical downturn that
[4148.0s] plays out within the context of a
[4149.759s] long-term secular uptrend. The stock
[4151.759s] gets a bit ahead of its skis, digests
[4153.44s] for a couple years, and eventually
[4154.719s] recovers to new highs. Same story,
[4156.4s] different day. We expect this time to be
[4158.0s] no different. Fast forward to a couple
[4160.08s] years, and what you&#39;ll see is a stronger
[4162.0s] Dagio with a cleaned up balance sheet
[4163.52s] growing at mids singledigit clip,
[4165.52s] benefiting from margin tailwinds tied to
[4167.44s] premiumization, and a stock trading back
[4169.199s] above $200. In the meantime, we&#39;re happy
[4171.679s] to collect a nearly 4% dividend while
[4174.239s] the nervous Nellies keep asking if
[4175.839s] people will ever drink again. Meanwhile,
[4177.839s] they&#39;re drinking while they while
[4179.759s] they&#39;re so nervous. Uh, and by the way,
[4183.64s] similar to
[4187.239s] Hormell, what you can see with
[4197.08s] Diagio is an increasing
[4199.64s] dividend most every
[4203.159s] year for the most part and reacelerating
[4206.32s] even since in the last three years.
[4208.32s] They&#39;ve been growing that dividend and
[4210.239s] increasing buybacks. So, you can go
[4212.8s] through each segment as we laid out for
[4215.12s] you here in the
[4218.12s] article. Let&#39;s get to the top 10 points
[4221.96s] here and then we&#39;ll get on to the ask me
[4225.6s] anything questions. Nice to finally have
[4228.64s] a reasonably short podcast. While that
[4230.88s] loads, we&#39;re going to do exploration and
[4232.96s] production earnings are down. I don&#39;t
[4234.719s] think the stocks have come down enough
[4236.159s] yet for for for a lot of them which is
[4238.0s] why we haven&#39;t added earnings down 13%
[4240.8s] 12% for next year. They&#39;ll recover but
[4244.12s] um uh and then uh top 30 weights of
[4247.88s] industrials down 1% 1.5 and 1% for next
[4252.64s] year. Let&#39;s see who
[4255.96s] is the biggest contributor for that.
[4282.52s] RTX. Okay, Boeing&#39;s holding in there for
[4286.08s] next year. That&#39;s
[4288.04s] good. UNP
[4298.64s] in Pacific. Interesting. Okay. Um All
[4302.719s] right. Did all this get loaded? Yeah.
[4304.56s] You see the arcanic growth where it came
[4306.8s] from. All the growth year. This thing is
[4309.04s] back. It&#39;s reacelerating, guys. 75% of
[4311.76s] their brands are not affected by by US
[4314.0s] tariffs. 25% will be
[4316.199s] impacted. Uh consistent cash delivery.
[4319.28s] They&#39;re going to generate 3 billion of
[4321.679s] free cash flow peranom from fix fiscal
[4324.44s] 2026 forward. That&#39;s looks like a lot of
[4327.6s] runway for me. Bring their debt levels
[4329.28s] down. You know the story. Turnaround Tom
[4331.199s] does it again. This is how we do it.
[4333.199s] Ladies and gentlemen, durable businesses
[4334.96s] have been around for a hundred years if
[4337.76s] you know decades if not a hundred years
[4339.76s] generating cash inflecting margins
[4341.84s] reacelerating
[4343.6s] uh and and so on and so forth. Rinse
[4346.159s] repeat over and over. This one will be
[4348.48s] no different. We covered that. Uh
[4351.44s] economic data. I just want to point to
[4353.12s] Friday being important as it relates to
[4354.96s] whether we get a cut in June. Low
[4356.48s] probability or September. High
[4358.4s] probability is going to be this jobs
[4360.0s] number. Expecting 110,000 down from
[4362.679s] 167,000. Unemployment rate at 42. If
[4365.44s] this goes up to 4344,
[4368.0s] uh maybe there&#39;ll be some pressure and
[4370.159s] uh too late. Powell will will come to
[4373.28s] the table rather than try to predict the
[4375.36s] future of what inflation&#39;s going to be,
[4377.84s] you know, one year, 6 months, one year,
[4380.719s] two years down the road, uh, which which
[4383.52s] he can&#39;t do. So, for a group that says
[4385.6s] they&#39;re data dependent, it sounds to me
[4387.52s] like they&#39;re trying to make predictions
[4388.8s] because the data right now says they&#39;re
[4390.56s] 200 basis points too
[4392.679s] restrictive. Um, okay. So, with that
[4395.52s] said, we&#39;ll move on to the AMA. Those of
[4397.44s] you who like the AMA, let&#39;s go. Those of
[4399.04s] you who don&#39;t, we&#39;ll see you next week.
[4400.48s] same time, same place. Thanks for tuning
[4402.32s] in. And here we go with question number
[4404.92s] one
[4415.8s] from Nolan Connor bought Cooper Standard
[4418.8s] shortly after your first money show
[4421.0s] presentation. How do you generally look
[4423.199s] or set intrinsic exit price? Is it an
[4425.44s] estimate fair value multiple? Not
[4427.52s] looking for a specific number for CPS as
[4429.28s] a multibagger already, but just trying
[4431.679s] to build a mental framework. We&#39;ve
[4433.04s] covered this a million times. We think
[4434.32s] this thing&#39;s going to earn more than it
[4435.6s] did in 2017 at the peak of the cycle
[4438.08s] when we&#39;re doing 17.5 million. SAR, we
[4440.64s] think last time it earned 719, traded at
[4443.28s] 146 on a 20 times multiple. Peak
[4445.92s] multiple is 20 times, trough multiple
[4447.679s] was 10 times. We don&#39;t know which
[4449.36s] multiple we&#39;re going to get. So, if you
[4451.679s] look at it, we think it&#39;ll earn at least
[4453.679s] 10 bucks at the top of this cycle. So
[4456.48s] $10 trough multiple of 10 times is a
[4459.12s] $100 stock. Peak multiple of 20 times
[4461.84s] could be a lot more. Cut it in half if
[4463.679s] you&#39;re conservative. You still have a
[4465.04s] double or triple from here. And um uh we
[4468.96s] think it&#39;s got a lot of runway left. So
[4471.199s] um we&#39;ve covered that a lot. Welcome to
[4473.12s] the podcast. Thanks for joining us.
[4475.32s] Goran, huge thank you for your time and
[4477.52s] dedication. How do you feel about
[4478.92s] Tidewater uh for that second energy
[4481.28s] play? Uh we covered this one and the
[4483.84s] answer was no. Uh, let&#39;s see
[4491.719s] here. Yeah, I mean, this thing&#39;s already
[4494.0s] up 10x off the
[4496.52s] lows. Um, I think you&#39;re getting faked
[4499.84s] out
[4505.4s] because you&#39;re looking at price. I mean,
[4509.0s] obviously it&#39;s performing better, but I
[4511.36s] think you&#39;re going to find that
[4514.76s] uh the share count
[4519.08s] is too large. Let me take a
[4527.0s] look. Yeah, they&#39;ve doubled the share
[4529.28s] count just in the last six years. Uh I
[4532.88s] don&#39;t do business with people that cut
[4534.56s] my pie in half without asking me. He
[4537.199s] they basically stole half my money uh so
[4539.679s] they could keep their job. So uh no no
[4542.239s] bueno. I don&#39;t care if this thing goes
[4543.679s] up to a million. Not doing business with
[4546.04s] that
[4547.96s] scumbaggery. Uh as we say in Jersey
[4551.88s] scumbag. All right, moving on. Sweet
[4554.92s] green. This is from Chris
[4558.199s] Williamson.
[4563.08s] SG. I think I looked at this and the
[4565.679s] answer was maybe and I passed on it. Now
[4567.84s] it&#39;s still negative free cash flow. I
[4569.6s] did look at this and I passed on it. No,
[4572.08s] I know they&#39;re growing blah blah blah.
[4573.84s] It&#39;s a solid company though. Chopped
[4575.36s] went out of business. You know, it&#39;s it
[4576.96s] comes and goes. Aptive APV. This is
[4579.84s] another uh we covered this one. Aptv
[4583.679s] another auto parts thing. You&#39;re trying
[4585.28s] to play it a different way than Cooper.
[4587.679s] I think it&#39;s fine. I think Cooper&#39;s
[4589.48s] better. Um but let&#39;s see. A
[4597.719s] TV. See, with these cars, you I if this
[4600.96s] is Yeah. Cash flow&#39;s gone up, revenues
[4603.52s] gone up, margins are going back
[4605.48s] up. Yeah, you&#39;re probably fine with this
[4607.92s] one. But what do they do here?
[4610.76s] Cuz manufactured vehicle components,
[4613.92s] electrical, electronic, safety
[4615.92s] technology, commercial vehicle markets,
[4618.32s] signal and power solutions.
[4627.36s] Uh, definitely worth doing more work on
[4630.0s] for sure. I think you might might be on
[4632.08s] to something there. So, I&#39;m going to
[4633.199s] write that one down. Probably not going
[4635.12s] to do anything because I have my
[4636.4s] exposure to the auto industry, but um
[4641.92s] uh good
[4647.08s] work Johnny S.
[4651.04s] Hope you&#39;re great. Can you take a look
[4652.64s] at
[4666.12s] BTMD? Okay, this is a busted spa. We
[4669.28s] were talking about these as a
[4670.48s] possibility with my friends in Dubai as
[4673.6s] uh the other group of uninvestable. A
[4675.679s] lot of these are stigmatized just
[4677.04s] because they went through a spa and and
[4678.8s] some of them actually have decent
[4680.52s] businesses.
[4681.74s] [Music]
[4683.64s] Um provided they weren&#39;t sponsored by
[4687.96s] uh well you know
[4690.199s] who king of spaxs. All right. Uh
[4695.48s] BMD that&#39;s interesting. Uh 39 million of
[4699.28s] free cash flow. What&#39;s the market
[4703.4s] cap? Enterprise value is 130. What is
[4706.56s] this? A practice building business
[4708.8s] hormone optimization. Trains hormone
[4711.199s] optimization using bioididentical
[4713.199s] hormone replacement pellet therapy
[4716.0s] offers bio uh yeah look this is above my
[4719.12s] pay grade but the numbers look really
[4720.719s] good. So definitely worth uh doing some
[4723.12s] work
[4724.04s] on.
[4725.96s] Um.
[4731.87s] [Music]
[4745.96s] Hm. So, I got 100 million in
[4749.64s] debt, 38 million of free cash flow.
[4752.64s] Jesus.
[4754.88s] 39 million of
[4757.96s] cash income is
[4760.12s] growing. Hey man,
[4762.76s] uh Johnny S, I think you got a good one
[4766.32s] here, my man. So, I&#39;m going to do some
[4768.48s] work on this
[4769.88s] one. Nice work. All right, moving along.
[4776.239s] Daniel
[4778.44s] Borman,
[4785.96s] Pterodine. I think we cover this one
[4788.0s] every week. I think it&#39;s going to be
[4789.36s] fine. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get
[4790.64s] the bags that you&#39;re going to
[4792.0s] potentially get with
[4794.28s] um
[4797.56s] Intel, but it&#39;s a good enough business
[4802.199s] that you&#39;re not wrong. I just think
[4804.48s] there are higher and better uses of
[4805.92s] capital, but I&#39;m not going to say no,
[4807.92s] but it&#39;s not something that I would
[4810.199s] do. Um, River Ra, River
[4815.48s] Rahhee, take a look at
[4827.88s] PK play on the China recovery. A third
[4831.36s] of their Ibida is from Hawaii which is
[4833.44s] in a trough on visitation numbers from
[4835.92s] China. Yeah, that was the interesting
[4837.84s] thing. When I was in Hawaii, I said to
[4839.76s] one of the guys like where are all the
[4841.12s] Asians? Like why you know last time I
[4843.36s] was here it was all like Chinese and
[4845.12s] Japanese and that&#39;s kind of dried up. Um
[4849.199s] that will come back aggressively. I
[4851.44s] think there&#39;s a lot of back pent-up
[4852.719s] demand. I think you&#39;re right on this my
[4854.56s] man. Let&#39;s see here.
[4861.48s] Um, speaking of my man, I&#39;ve been
[4865.28s] listening to Charles Payne too much.
[4866.56s] I&#39;ll be on Charles Payne on the uh back
[4868.88s] in New York on the
[4871.0s] 21st. Uh, play some golf out in
[4873.4s] Connecticut. And then uh
[4877.64s] 203rd, Monday, I&#39;ll be on Charles Payne.
[4880.159s] 24th I will be on Varn and Co. All in
[4883.36s] studio. and 25th I&#39;ll be on the full
[4885.28s] hour of the Big Money Show. And in
[4888.719s] between there, I think I&#39;ve got 3:30 and
[4891.44s] 4 PM on Monday. Yahoo in studio, two
[4894.84s] hits, and
[4897.239s] probably
[4899.64s] Wednesday, either Monday or Wednesday
[4901.92s] morning, I&#39;ll have the New York Stock
[4903.92s] Exchange stuff with Kristen and possibly
[4906.56s] Schwab.
[4912.56s] Then I&#39;m going to try to get my friend
[4914.0s] Jason on Quaker Ridge uh and play that
[4917.52s] and then come back to Connecticut and
[4919.36s] show him our new course in Connecticut.
[4920.96s] They finished the back nine. It&#39;s
[4922.239s] incredible. I haven&#39;t played it yet.
[4923.6s] Super excited to get out there. Designed
[4925.76s] by Brian Schneider who did Old Banyan
[4928.48s] Top 50 course. Redid uh uh Garden City
[4933.6s] Tamarak. So super excited. The pictures
[4936.0s] are off the charts. Um
[4940.48s] uh I like this one. Let me just take a
[4942.239s] look at the balance sheet real
[4952.36s] quick. Okay, so you got three billion of
[4955.04s] debt secured by the buildings. You got
[4957.44s] Let&#39;s take a look at the free
[4960.12s] cash 500 million
[4964.52s] 400. Uh I think you&#39;re okay. I kind of
[4967.92s] like this one. kind of like this one in
[4970.639s] the discretionary category. Why not?
[4975.4s] Um, not bad. Good job, River. You guys
[4979.44s] are rocking it. Super excited. Tom
[4983.4s] Johnson,
[4985.8s] SVL, Shoe
[4989.96s] Carnival and
[4991.96s] Shoe
[4995.719s] Station. Okay, let&#39;s see. SC
[4999.48s] C
[5001.159s] SC
[5024.52s] VL. All right. So, revenues have come
[5027.199s] down a bit. Cash flow has kind of
[5030.04s] recovered. Gross margins are still weak.
[5033.84s] I mean, let&#39;s see. Are they selling
[5035.76s] sneakers? I mean, you look at
[5038.36s] Nike, casual sandals,
[5041.32s] everything.
[5044.199s] Uh, not in love with this. I&#39;d rather
[5046.56s] play it through
[5047.96s] Vans,
[5049.88s] but let&#39;s just take a look.
[5063.28s] 70 million of free cash.
[5082.4s] So there no long-term debt, just the
[5085.96s] leases.
[5096.04s] Yeah. Gross margins have to recover.
[5103.48s] Ah, you&#39;re probably okay. I like it.
[5106.8s] Good job, Tom. Man, we&#39;re getting some
[5108.88s] winners today. All right,
[5113.4s] SCVL
[5115.17s] [Music]
[5116.679s] Salvator. By the way, all this is
[5118.8s] opinion, not advice. Consult your
[5120.48s] financial adviser before you do
[5121.679s] anything. Go to hedge
[5123.159s] funtips.com. Click on terms,
[5127.12s] etc., etc., etc. Salvator Castro, EOS,
[5132.48s] EOLS.
[5138.639s] I guess it&#39;s a Botox
[5142.92s] knockoff. Yeah, the whole wellness thing
[5145.28s] is a big deal. All right, let&#39;s see
[5149.239s] here. Was this a
[5158.679s] spack? Still free cash flow negative.
[5161.04s] The revenues are growing pretty quickly.
[5170.639s] All right. 700 million enterprise
[5189.719s] value. So it&#39;s basically three times
[5192.4s] revs.
[5205.84s] This is a speculative play. So, you got
[5208.08s] to know the product inside out and
[5209.679s] upside down. And you&#39;ve got
[5217.08s] limited time to figure it out because
[5219.719s] you&#39;re losing cash. Your cash flow
[5222.639s] negative.
[5225.52s] got some cash in the bank. You got any
[5227.719s] debt? Yeah, it&#39;s not bad. Um, so this is
[5232.32s] just a product speculation, so you got
[5234.48s] to really be damn sure about the
[5235.92s] product. Uh, could certainly work, but,
[5238.8s] uh, kind of outside my realm of
[5240.96s] interest, but thank you for sending it
[5243.719s] in. Uh, okay.
[5253.44s] James
[5254.84s] asks, &quot;Just wondering what your opinion
[5257.52s] on how Trump&#39;s current steel tariffs
[5259.44s] will affect Cooper Sander for the rest
[5260.719s] of the year in 2026. Seems like it could
[5263.04s] be stuck in the mud for a while, Jim.&quot;
[5265.36s] Uh, yeah. No, it&#39;s not going to have an
[5267.92s] impact because you still have the
[5270.48s] average car on the road is 13 years
[5275.4s] old. You got millennials moving out. You
[5278.4s] got potentially the tax deduction on
[5280.0s] interest, you got incentives going up,
[5283.08s] um you got rates coming
[5285.719s] down, and you have massive pent-up
[5288.159s] demand. So, uh if steel tariffs adds
[5291.84s] three to $4,000 for car, um they&#39;ll just
[5295.84s] have to do employee pricing across the
[5297.44s] board, which is why we don&#39;t own the
[5299.44s] waring factions. I think the car
[5301.92s] producers, the OEMs are going to be
[5303.6s] producing a ton of cars at very thin
[5305.44s] margins and a race to the bottom. And
[5307.76s] the guys supplying the parts are going
[5309.12s] to make all the money. So, um, it&#39;s a
[5311.92s] rare part. Can you All right, David T.
[5314.239s] Can you revisit Cava? Okay. Everyone had
[5317.199s] a salad at Cava and they said, &quot;Great
[5319.92s] effing salad. Now, let&#39;s buy the stock.&quot;
[5322.32s] It doesn&#39;t always work that way. So,
[5326.52s] um, I like Cava, too. I have it all the
[5329.44s] time. It&#39;s right by my apartment in New
[5330.96s] York. And
[5341.239s] um what&#39;s surprising to me is this is
[5344.239s] still a relatively small
[5356.6s] business. All right. So
[5360.28s] it&#39;s all right. So it&#39;s a it&#39;s got a
[5362.96s] $9.5 billion enterprise value on 1
[5366.48s] billion of sales. Okay. So everyone says
[5369.199s] it&#39;s going to be the next
[5370.679s] Chipotle. So let&#39;s see what Chipotle
[5379.159s] is. So Chipotle&#39;s got an enterprise
[5382.0s] value seven times bigger. 77 $73 billion
[5387.12s] on 11 billion of
[5392.12s] sales. Um, I don&#39;t think Greek
[5395.76s] Mediterranean has near the runway
[5403.88s] as Mexican. Everyone loves
[5409.239s] Mexican. Uh, I love cava. I think if I
[5412.4s] had to eat chipotle or cava every day,
[5416.0s] it would be Chipotle. I could eat cava
[5417.76s] once a week, but like it&#39;s not salad
[5421.52s] deals come and go, but I think cava is
[5424.88s] is a little bit
[5426.6s] special. Um, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to
[5428.719s] become the next Chipotle. Could it
[5430.48s] become half of Chipotle?
[5433.159s] Yes, I think it could. I think for sure
[5435.679s] it could become a third of Chipotle,
[5437.52s] which case you&#39;re talking a 30 billion
[5439.199s] market cap.
[5440.9s] [Music]
[5446.28s] Uh, I don&#39;t think it deserves to be
[5448.4s] trading at 10 times sales, but I
[5450.32s] understand the whole growth story and
[5451.76s] all the comparisons. I I&#39;d be an
[5454.4s] aggressive buyer between 40 and 50. I
[5457.28s] don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see that. Uh,
[5459.76s] this is a broken Momo stock.
[5462.96s] It&#39;s going to take a little time to re
[5464.4s] to recover, but
[5467.159s] um I think if you bought it here long
[5469.84s] term and you don&#39;t care if it goes to 40
[5471.84s] before it goes to to 250, I think you&#39;re
[5475.12s] okay. I think you&#39;re probably okay. Let
[5477.28s] me just check the balance sheet and
[5478.84s] everything. I I like the idea. I hate
[5481.6s] speculating. Give me a company that&#39;s
[5483.28s] been around for hundred something years
[5484.88s] that&#39;s down 50% and I can make a double
[5487.04s] on the recovery in a couple years.
[5489.04s] That&#39;s interesting to me. this I got to
[5490.719s] guess the future. Are people going to
[5492.719s] like salad as much as they like
[5494.08s] burritos? And the answer is I have no
[5495.76s] idea. They never have before. Maybe now
[5497.92s] it&#39;s different, but um it&#39;s never worked
[5500.8s] in the past. Even if they have good
[5506.28s] hummus, you know, these guys didn&#39;t even
[5508.4s] put steak on their salad for for so
[5510.4s] long. Shows you how dumb they are. Like
[5512.239s] everyone loves steak and you know they
[5514.48s] fought it and they put these shitty
[5516.36s] meatballs and this falafel crap that no
[5519.44s] one likes. Put steak on the salad.
[5521.76s] Everyone will buy it. They figured that
[5523.44s] out. Now make the steak a little bit
[5525.36s] better and you can have a possible run.
[5527.36s] I mean Chipotle figured that out. They
[5530.159s] got a new chicken and new steak every
[5531.92s] single every single uh quarter.
[5539.4s] Um maybe they will figure it out. So
[5542.0s] they
[5543.0s] got some
[5545.4s] cash, no debt, just
[5549.239s] leases. Income&#39;s
[5553.56s] climbing. All right. You&#39;re paying a
[5555.52s] little too much, but again, if you&#39;re
[5557.6s] okay with it having before it triples, I
[5560.639s] think it&#39;s
[5561.48s] okay. I kind of like it to be honest
[5564.0s] with you. It&#39;s not something I would
[5565.92s] ever do with uh I
[5568.52s] mean, you could I wouldn&#39;t punt in my PA
[5571.679s] with this. I would never put it in a
[5573.44s] client account at this valuation, but at
[5575.679s] $40, $50, I&#39;d take a hard look. I do
[5577.84s] like the product. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s
[5579.6s] going to be Chipotle. I think it&#39;s going
[5581.36s] to become maybe a third at Chipotle,
[5583.04s] maybe a 3040 billion company. Um, so if
[5586.96s] I could get it down another, you know,
[5589.199s] 40% at some point, that would be pretty
[5592.159s] exciting to me. I&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s
[5593.92s] going to happen, but
[5598.199s] uh I&#39;m okay with it, David. Just know
[5601.28s] that I I&#39;m not I have no confidence that
[5603.84s] it&#39;s going to rebound from these levels,
[5605.84s] and it very well may, but um you&#39;re
[5609.36s] paying up for a lot of the future
[5612.52s] today. What&#39;s appealing about FMC versus
[5615.6s] others in the space?
[5618.76s] Um, yeah, I don&#39;t like we we&#39;ve covered
[5622.32s] all the others in the space. So, let&#39;s
[5623.84s] just do FMC because I&#39;m not going to do
[5625.6s] a 10-year analysis on on this stuff for
[5628.36s] you. Um, you got to do your own work on
[5631.44s] it. So, number one, it&#39;s down 2/3. I
[5634.4s] like that. Okay. Number two, it&#39;s been
[5637.28s] around
[5641.32s] for it&#39;s been public for uh 40 years.
[5648.88s] It&#39;s gone through many cyclical draw
[5651.28s] downs of more than 50% over and over and
[5654.32s] over. It shows me it&#39;s a pretty durable
[5656.76s] business. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening
[5662.28s] now. Cash flow has recovered. The share
[5665.36s] price has not. Revenues have not
[5667.92s] recovered off the peak. Uh that&#39;s
[5670.4s] reflected in stock price. Margins have
[5672.56s] not recovered. But all of these are in a
[5674.88s] depression. all the a stocks. So, this
[5676.719s] is one that&#39;s just been around a long
[5679.04s] time. Just look at Mosaic for a
[5683.0s] second. By the way, what kind of cash it
[5685.84s] is generating? It has the runway with
[5688.08s] the cash flow. How&#39;s the balance sheet
[5689.76s] on this one? I think you&#39;re going to be
[5693.199s] really good when this sector turns
[5695.199s] owning FMC at these levels.
[5699.56s] um balance
[5701.8s] sheet 57
[5706.28s] million they have a lot of debt. So
[5709.199s] that&#39;s that&#39;s the problem. That&#39;s why
[5710.88s] people are worried about it. That&#39;s why
[5712.239s] it&#39;s down 2/3. But they&#39;ve had a lot of
[5714.8s] debt for a long time. And when this
[5716.56s] cycle turns, the operating leverage is
[5720.76s] huge. Uh they&#39;re generating a half over
[5724.159s] $600 million of free cash. So that
[5727.199s] services an awful lot of debt. Even in a
[5729.679s] trough, they&#39;re generating that much
[5731.12s] cash. So what are they generating in a
[5735.88s] peak? 700. They&#39;re almost back to peak.
[5739.04s] 720 million of free cash flow.
[5745.159s] Um this is a high quality business. High
[5748.32s] return on invested capital. Balance
[5750.719s] sheet. We went into Let&#39;s see. Share
[5752.96s] account.
[5754.56s] I just like this one.
[5758.04s] Uh,
[5761.4s] normalized share counts going down. All
[5764.0s] the right
[5765.0s] things. Mosaic just looks like a
[5767.52s] show. It&#39;s back to the same levels it
[5770.04s] was 30 years ago. It&#39;s that&#39;s a trading
[5773.36s] stock. That&#39;s not a buy and hold. I
[5775.36s] think you buy
[5777.639s] FMC, not only do you recover to all-time
[5781.92s] highs, 127, but you wind up at, you
[5784.159s] know,
[5784.84s] 250 before the end of the next cycle. I
[5788.84s] mean, because it&#39;s a durable
[5794.679s] business, provides crop protection
[5797.04s] solutions to farmers in Latin America,
[5798.719s] North America, Europe. develop sales and
[5801.04s] markets crop protection chemicals
[5802.719s] including incesticides, herbicides,
[5805.36s] budget sides as well as biologicals,
[5808.639s] crop nutrition, seed treatment products,
[5811.76s] you know, all that beautiful stuff that
[5814.08s] uh RFK loves. Uh let&#39;s see.
[5824.76s] Mosaic crop
[5827.639s] nutrients phosphate potach mosaic
[5830.56s] fertilizers. I think if you want to play
[5832.639s] I mean it&#39;s not apples to oranges but
[5834.639s] I&#39;d play SMG Miracle Grow if you want
[5836.88s] fert fertilizer.
[5838.9s] [Music]
[5840.6s] Um, all right. There you
[5847.719s] go. We&#39;ll
[5849.8s] see. Longtime
[5852.44s] listener. Thanks for all you do.
[5854.48s] Stronger agreement. Healthcare is
[5855.84s] undervalued. Increasing my exposure over
[5857.76s] the last year. Have positions in XBI and
[5860.639s] BBC, which is a clinical trials ETF. Opt
[5863.44s] into securities lending at my brokerage.
[5866.08s] All right. So he&#39;s talking about this
[5867.52s] high borrow rate which is going to
[5869.52s] create the first buyers. The first
[5871.04s] buyers are short
[5873.0s] coverers. Uh why so much short
[5880.84s] interest short covering rally? Yeah, I
[5883.119s] think you answered your own question. I
[5884.719s] mean it&#39;s just that&#39;s what&#39;s to short
[5886.56s] right now and that&#39;ll that&#39;ll change
[5888.4s] when it changes and when it changes it
[5890.0s] will be violent and quick. Caleb Lusby a
[5893.679s] lot of you guys overthink stuff too by
[5895.28s] the way. Iceman, thank you for the
[5897.76s] amazing podcast and content. Watching on
[5899.679s] YouTube really drives home your data
[5901.199s] points. I&#39;m looking at
[5903.48s] Viaat at my airline. We use many of
[5906.0s] their
[5910.04s] products. I don&#39;t know. I think this
[5912.4s] business could wind up being all in um
[5916.0s] VSAT. I mean, to go on pay first class
[5918.48s] and not get internet connection because
[5920.0s] of VSAT is is a disaster. I think it&#39;s
[5923.04s] all going to be uh Musk&#39;s
[5928.44s] thing. Let&#39;s take a look at it. I think
[5932.08s] this has been a dog forever via SAT if
[5934.239s] I&#39;m not
[5935.8s] mistaken. Yeah, this thing looks like
[5937.92s] it&#39;s dead. I think it&#39;s all going to be
[5941.239s] um whatever Elon Mus thing is called.
[5952.04s] Starlink. All
[5968.92s] right. Still negative free cash flow.
[5971.28s] Revenues are
[5974.28s] growing. I mean, it&#39;s always been
[5976.239s] negative cash flow. Like, what is wrong
[5978.96s] with this business?
[5997.44s] Got a ton of cash.
[6009.28s] 7 billion of debt, two billion of
[6013.56s] cash. They&#39;ve always been a destroyer of
[6023.639s] capital. Must have made an acquisition.
[6025.76s] They had a big jump in
[6031.56s] revenues. They doubled their share
[6033.679s] account in the last six years. No.
[6036.719s] Scumbags.
[6038.32s] Not interested. I don&#39;t care if this
[6040.0s] thing bounces back up to 40. These guys
[6041.76s] are low lives. Not interested. All
[6044.48s] right, moving along. Marco
[6047.719s] Satc, thanks for all the great content
[6049.92s] and insights. You&#39;re welcome. Started
[6051.76s] looking at Smith and
[6054.36s] Wesson. Uh, yeah, these all look cheap.
[6057.36s] They always look cheap and they
[6059.96s] never
[6062.44s] work. Oh, this one looks like it&#39;s doing
[6064.88s] okay. Let&#39;s see.
[6073.96s] SWBI. So, it&#39;s negative free cash flow.
[6076.56s] Let&#39;s look on a quarterly
[6080.52s] basis. No, it&#39;s still negative free cash
[6083.36s] flow.
[6085.76s] Let&#39;s look at
[6094.44s] um revenues are down 50%. I I don&#39;t like
[6097.6s] this thing. No, not for me. On to the
[6101.199s] next. Some things shouldn&#39;t be public
[6102.96s] companies. That should be a private
[6104.159s] business and they just pay dividends to
[6105.679s] the owners. Ryman
[6110.52s] Healthcare, New Zealand, R
[6127.4s] YM
[6132.04s] H. Your gross margins are terrible. So,
[6134.8s] you got to you got to see that. recovery
[6136.8s] start to happen and how is it going to
[6152.44s] happen. These guys are also increasing
[6154.639s] the share count by more than I&#39;m
[6156.48s] comfortable with.
[6166.56s] Wait a
[6167.719s] second. Says you have positive free cash
[6170.08s] flow here. Why is it not showing that?
[6194.239s] You got $1 and a half billion dollars of
[6195.76s] debt and 35 million of cash. That&#39;s no
[6199.0s] bueno. Uh I&#39;m going to say pass. Double
[6201.84s] check those numbers. They might be
[6203.159s] wrong, but um I&#39;m going to pass on that
[6206.96s] one. Eric
[6208.84s] Klein cron growth cheap great balance
[6212.48s] sheet thoughts. Is this a pot stock?
[6217.04s] C R O
[6235.48s] N H Yeah, you need safe banking. I mean
[6260.08s] I actually went cash flow positive last
[6262.56s] year.
[6272.76s] $858 million of
[6277.719s] cash, no
[6280.119s] debt, income
[6286.119s] statement. I can only imagine how many
[6288.719s] shares they&#39;ve issued.
[6291.44s] Well, they&#39;ve doubled them in 2018, but
[6295.639s] uh they&#39;ve only grown modestly
[6300.199s] since. Didn&#39;t they get into the beverage
[6303.96s] business? Cannabis
[6318.6s] company. So, it&#39;s
[6321.48s] trading according to
[6326.04s] this and I have to double check this.
[6329.36s] It&#39;s trading at a discount to the cash
[6331.44s] on its balance sheet.
[6341.199s] This reminds me of I was in Puerto Rico
[6343.52s] at a family office conference and this
[6345.28s] guy sat down and like pitched me on
[6347.76s] Rick&#39;s cabaret for like an hour and
[6351.36s] going through all this return on
[6352.719s] capital. all this the guy read a book
[6355.28s] about Warren Buffett and he knows how to
[6357.36s] like steward capital and I said yeah
[6360.48s] except for the fact that no
[6362.4s] institutional manager can ever own the
[6365.119s] goddamn stock therefore you&#39;re never
[6367.44s] going to get any real sponsorship or
[6369.44s] have any liquidity if you need to get
[6371.28s] out in size. So, if you own 10,000
[6373.76s] shares and you&#39;re PA, who cares? That
[6376.08s] doesn&#39;t, you know, that&#39;s
[6377.88s] not Let me just see Rick&#39;s. Where&#39;s
[6380.96s] Rick&#39;s? RCI Hospitality. They changed
[6383.52s] the name thinking institutions will
[6385.04s] know. So, yeah, it&#39;s still down at $40 a
[6387.36s] year ago.
[6390.28s] Um, I mean, I think you got to
[6392.88s] understand if safe banking is coming. Uh
[6395.76s] you got to double check these numbers to
[6397.679s] see if that&#39;s
[6400.199s] true that they&#39;ve
[6403.159s] got you&#39;re basically buying I mean if
[6406.8s] they own if they&#39;ve got $858 million
[6409.76s] worth of cash and the thing is trading
[6413.96s] at 758
[6419.4s] million 746 million
[6430.239s] And you in theory
[6440.36s] have growing revenues.
[6469.52s] then it&#39;s probably worth doing some work
[6478.199s] on pre-rolls, oils, vaporizers, edibles,
[6482.52s] chemist, spinach, Lord Jones, Peace
[6485.28s] Natural brand names.
[6505.28s] I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t get excited about
[6507.119s] it, but I think you got enough margin of
[6509.44s] safety in it that if they get it right
[6512.0s] and the phase comes
[6514.52s] back, you could have a
[6517.0s] beast of a move, but this is kind of a
[6520.32s] gambling stock. But with the downside
[6523.84s] somewhat covered, unless they start
[6526.32s] burning cash again, then you&#39;re screwed.
[6528.88s] So, um, so that&#39;s that. With that said,
[6532.4s] we&#39;ll be back next week, same time, same
[6534.08s] place. In the meantime, make it a great
[6535.84s] one. Bye for now.
