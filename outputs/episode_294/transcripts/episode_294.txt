Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 294th videocast podcast for the week ending June 5th, 2025. As always, we&#39;re going to do family first, then we&#39;ll get right down to business. Mimi and Annabelle and their respective water polo teams played in the qualifying tournament for the South Pacific zone, which is the most competitive zone in the nation for water polo. Both girls had some incredible goals and both came home with medals and are on to the USA Water Polo Junior Olympics which will be held at the end of July. So that&#39;s the whole fam. Caitlyn, Mimi, Annabelle, and myself. Uh they&#39;re holding their medals. There&#39;s Mimi and me. There&#39;s Caitlyn and Annabelle. Absolutely incredible weekend. Then we&#39;ll just do two quick goals and get right down to it here. First and foremost, here&#39;s Mimi. That was right under the wire. She just got in under the clock, which was pretty darn amazing. And then that&#39;s Mimi. And then we had Annabelle right here. And just [Music] All right. Doesn&#39;t get any better. That&#39;s just a sampling or we&#39;ll be here all night. Uh then I had the pleasure to join Sean Calibs on CGTN America talking Musk, Doge, and more. We&#39;re not going to play this one because it there&#39;s nothing in it that&#39;s going to make you money. But if you like politics and policy, go to hedge funips.com and play the whole eight minutes. It was definitely entertaining. Uh then I had the pleasure today to join Adam Shapiro on his show called T Talk Anomics with David Nelson. You know David from Charles Payne. I often go on right after him. Um and we got to cover everything how things are looking right now with the economy. So we&#39;re going to listen in here. You&#39;re probably not only recovered, but you might even be higher than you were on what did they call it? Liberation Day. So, with that, let&#39;s bring in my co-pilot tonight, our returning champion, David Nelson. He is the chief strategist at Bellpoint, and we appreciate you doing uh being here as always. He&#39;s also the host of the MoneyRunner. He&#39;s got his own podcast, his own uh weekly newsletter that you can get on Substack. So, David, it&#39;s always good to see you, and I want to ask you real quick. Sure. Where are we in this cycle? Because this is why people pay you and not me. Uh yeah, we we&#39;ve come a long way since Liberation Day. We had a a quick move down. We were probably down about almost 15% at the lows. Uh and it was an extraordinary comeback. And as we learned over the last month, you know, we&#39;ve always lived in fear that we were one tweet away from the market being down a,000 points. But what we learned in the last couple of months, we&#39;re also one tweet away from the market being up a thousand points. And that&#39;s maybe the lesson learned in the last couple of months. uh maybe put the rhetoric aside and and focus on on the knitting, focus on the companies, focus on the earnings, and try to put a lot of the politics beside beside uh outside of your portfolio. All right. Well, David&#39;s going to be my co-pilot for the next hour and our first guest. David&#39;s going to help me get some insight out of this individual. They always say you don&#39;t need an introduction because you&#39;ve seen David on CNBC, Fox Business, Yahoo Finance. You&#39;ve seen our next guest on CNBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, the the usual culprits, and that is Thomas Hayes, the founder and the uh you&#39;re not only the founder, but you&#39;re the manager over at Great Hill Capital. So, it&#39;s good to have you here, Thomas. It&#39;s good to see you. I haven&#39;t spoken with you since my days at Yahoo Finance and Fox Business. So, thank you for doing this. And I got to ask you, where do you see us in the cycle right now? Because a lot of people were saying, you know, the well, it&#39;s all over. jump off the cliff. And boy were they wrong. Yeah, no question about it. I I&#39;ll tell you. And you had hedge funds record sellers at the exact wrong time in early April. Right. The day before Trump put out now is a good time to buy stocks. You had them selling a record $1 trillion in equities. So they&#39;re trapped. You got a lot of trapped bears that the market&#39;s taken off. And actually intraday peak to trough was uh just around 20%. Uh so you have these guys that didn&#39;t believe it on the way up, then were praying for a retest that never came. So every bit of decent news, you have forced buyers, okay? They they first you had the shorts that were covering, then you have now uh forced people uh really looking to save their jobs. I mean, they they they sold at the bottom and now they&#39;ve missed the recovery. So they&#39;re underperforming and they&#39;re going to have to buy up. Then you take earnings growth which came in at 13.3% uh uh for the first quarter which was about double expectations. We&#39;re going into the second quarter earnings season expecting 5% earnings growth. You look at Atlanta GDP now which you take with a grain of salt but it&#39;s looking like a recovery after a negative quarter of GDP. We&#39;re not going to get two consecutive quarters in a row because Atlanta GDP is looking at 4.6%. So even if they&#39;re half wrong, you&#39;re still over 2% which means no two consecutive quarters of negative GDP. Uh so you know, you take the force buyers, the trap bears, everyone was negative. Uh you take decent earnings, you take decent uh Atlanta GDP, and then you offset it. Talk about crosswinds, Adam. Uh and David is you&#39;ve got uh the ADP numbers were a little weak this morning. So that&#39;s kind of going to put put a little pressure on the Fed and the big number is coming out on on Friday with the non-farmms payroll and and inflation has been been low. So uh I will end it with uh Trump saying too late Powell may prove in fact to be correct. That was okay. Before I let David jump in here, just a couple of things. I did some housekeeping. I&#39;ve got two powerhouses here who understand these markets far better than me. So you should be asking the questions. I know you&#39;re watching on X right now because we have the count. All you got to do is put in your comment in the chat. I&#39;ll make sure that either Thomas and or David answers the question you have about where we&#39;re headed and and what Thomas just said about Too Late Powell. That was President Trump&#39;s truth social post this morning about ADP. Um David, I&#39;m going to throw this to you with this question. The ADP number, and I assigned this to my staff. They&#39;re writing this story overnight for tomorrow. the ADP number always diverges from the reality of the labor number that we&#39;re going to get on um uh the non-farm payroll number on Friday. So, is ADP even worth I mean we we we clutch the pearls Sturman drawn, you know, with the ADP report, but is it worth anything? The there&#39;s almost no correlation between the two. You you pointed it out correctly. There&#39;s have been a lot of months where ADP had a very weak number and then we have a blockbuster number on on the following Friday and vice versa. It&#39;s been exactly opposite, you know, at other times. I&#39;m not sure which is worse, the ADP numbers or the BLS numbers because often it&#39;s not really indicative of what&#39;s really happening in the in the real economy. So, I didn&#39;t pay any attention to ADP this morning, Thomas. Well, look, I think you got to you got to pay attention to the trends and and if you see a really weak number, even if the number comes in strongish on Friday, expectations are pretty low on Friday. 130,000 down from 177,000. So, all of this opens the possibility for the Fed to save face. There&#39;s zero, very low expectations of a cut in June, and that could be the surprise. Uh 78% chance of a cut in September. So, that wouldn&#39;t be a surprise. I I guess this the market uh shortterm is paying an awful lot of attention to this. Uh I guess to some degree the Apple developers conference to see if they can get their AI stuff together because that&#39;s a big waiting in the S&amp;P but uh le less important than how it&#39;s going to impact and if you look at the uh beige book that came out uh demand for labor is slowing. So you&#39;re you&#39;re seeing it, you know, look through ADP and start to look at the beige book and what businesses are saying and doing less hours. Uh that could move the Fed&#39;s hand and enable Powell at the same time to save face not being look like he&#39;s pressured by Trump. But you know to say that you&#39;re data dependent and being 150 175 basis points too restrictive because you are predicting tariffs will raise prices when it simply wasn&#39;t the case in 2018 uh is not data dependent. They are prediction dependent and they are predicting that any tariffs will create a short-term bump in inflation. Otherwise they would acknowledge they&#39;re 150 to 175 basis points too restrictive. And and I&#39;m not saying this as an asset owner. I&#39;m saying this you&#39;ve got the bulk of our population trying to start a life and trying to buy a house and simply can&#39;t do it at 7725 interest rates, record high prices. Uh and Besson&#39;s got a couple uh uh arrows in his quiver to deal with mortgage rates with the uh SLR bringing down capital requirements for banks this summer. Maybe the Genius Act will create some demand for treasuries as well. bring bring yields down and enable mortgage rates to get down below 6% before the end of the year and that would reignite housing and all ancillary businesses. But um but but that&#39;s where we are and and I think I think too late Powell is a risk. Hopefully the jobs report will give them cover to act sooner rather than later. David David, jump in here with a question. I&#39;m going to be on the other side. I&#39;m going to be on the other side of this. I think we&#39;re worried about the wrong end of the yield curve. Uh Pal, there&#39;s not a lot Powell&#39;s going to be able to do for housing. the only the only thing that&#39;s going to happen for housing if you get taking your yields down. And to do that, you&#39;re going to have to get some kind of fiscal uh you know, fiscal sense that we&#39;re starting to get our debt and deficits under control. Right now, uh investors in US treasuries are w looking at a an interest rate. The juice on our debt right now, it&#39;s literally straight up straight up. It is parabolic. And as long as that exists, anybody that&#39;s going to want to invest on the long end of their curve, they&#39;re going to want some food on their plate. The auctions will always happen and it and we&#39;ll be able to sell our treasuries, but the question is what price? And at some point in time, you&#39;re going to be having a conversation not about five, but about six. Yeah. Well, look, to the point I made about what Besson said with the SLR, mortgage rates are are contingent upon the longer end of the curve, the 10-year. And what he specifically said is by removing the the capital requirements and exempting treasuries, uh what you&#39;ll see is 30 to 60 basis points lower in the US 10-year Treasury yield. So he&#39;s handling it on that front. Uh whether the stable coin demand for additional treasuries will be helpful or not is immaterial. But I&#39;ll tell you what will be helpful uh on the long end of the curve is if you continue to see weakness in the labor market. And uh and we&#39;re going to find out if that&#39;s the case on on Friday. But uh but I I I will say that while mortgage rates are contingent on the 10-year yield, uh don&#39;t forget that you have the HELOC game, you have the uh five-year ARM game that that is more dependent on the the shorter end and to get people into the housing rate uh into the housing market on interestonies. That&#39;s the short end of the curve. So Powell can do something about affordability and instead he&#39;s taken the uh starter home buyers from age 33 to age you know 38 39 40 41 and delaying a lot of people&#39;s lives which unnecessarily when you look at the inflation numbers came in 2.1% PCE price index on Friday and he&#39;s justifying a 425 Fed funds rate makes no sense and it should be a buyer market in the housing market right now because there&#39;s a ton except in places like Miami there&#39;s a ton of housing now that is on the market waiting for those buyers. I someone mentioned the word debt. That was David. So, let&#39;s get to the debt issue because I saw on Truth Social today something that just made me laugh. I&#39;ve interviewed Elizabeth Warren. I&#39;ve interviewed President Trump uh back years ago. And those two agree they agree that it&#39;s time to eliminate the uh the borrowing cap, the debt cap uh in Congress and just have unlimited borrowing power. What do you think, David? I I I would eliminate the the cap. It&#39;s a meaningless exercise. We we bump up against this and we go through the wranglings of it, you know, a couple of times a year sometimes and it it&#39;s meaningless. We&#39;ve already approved this spending. You know, this spending was already passed by Congress. Having in there as an arbitrary stopping point, it it it&#39;s nice to think that it&#39;s a cap. It&#39;s not a cap. Has it ever worked? We&#39;ve had a cap for the last half decade, for the last decade, and it hasn&#39;t done anything. So I I would say push it aside. On that front, I guess I&#39;m on the same side as Elizabeth as Elizabeth and uh and Donald Thomas, would you get rid of the cap? Yeah. Look, I at the end of the day, we need a little bit of what what people are missing here is we&#39;re not getting out of this 120% debt to GDP uh by austerity. Okay, that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to happen. And what Powell&#39;s missing here is uh austerity is going to create a bigger debt problem and create a lot of defaults. What happened the last time we were in this situation post World War II? 120% debt to GDP. What did they do? You had uh growth and you had above trend inflation from 1948 uh to basically 1958. Debt to GDP came down from 120% down to 63%. And you did that with a little bit above trend, 3 to 5% inflation. You did that with lower rates. Uh and you let the economy run super hot. And with the deregulation that this administration has on its plate, the the tax cuts that they&#39;re proposing, and by the way, it&#39;s interesting when you actually go through the thousands pages of the big beautiful bill versus what the CBO and the media is reporting about the bill. Uh the the math is that uh the overall federal budget baseline is smaller than the current budget uh when you subtract everything the bill unfunds from what remains. Uh, okay. So, you know, throw it if you don&#39;t have a uh, you know, three days to read a thousand pages, throw it into three different AI models and they&#39;ll come out with that result. And the one that doesn&#39;t anthropic that that comes up with all the negative headlines about the bill uh, acknowledges if you dig deeper that they are drawing their conclusions on the basis of media headlines versus the text document itself. And when you force it to go back to the text document, it comes up to a similar uh conclusion which is the baseline is smaller than the current budget when you back out uh everything the bill unfunds from what remains. So uh I I you know very few people read the thousandpage bill and that&#39;s why the negative headlines can continue to fly because it&#39;s it&#39;s easy. We know that Marjorie Taylor Green didn&#39;t read it. She admitted that. But hey, real quick, um, just want to remind everybody we&#39;re getting this this data, this information from David and Thomas for free. David again has his podcast and his newsletter, the the MoneyRunner. Thomas has hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes and and you can check this out at his website and I believe you have where the money is going. But I want to find out where Elon Musk is going because Elon Musk, talk about biting the hand that fed you. And I realized he fed the Trump administration or at least the campaign hundreds of millions in donations. But Musk is coming out against BBB, the big beautiful bill, the tax bill. Uh we&#39;re talking about debt and he&#39;s calling it a calamity. I think the CBO came out with its score that it&#39;ll add 2.4 trillion to um debt uh to the national debt over the next 10 years. And the reason I bring this up is how does this land? How do you get Republicans to line up and pass this thing if you&#39;ve got Elon Musk saying don&#39;t go there, Thomas? Yeah, look, Elon&#39;s one of the most brilliant entrepreneurs and creators in our lifetime. He&#39;s he&#39;s the Thomas Edison of our day. He&#39;s a genius. All of that stuff. Okay. The fact of the matter is, you know, he&#39;s also been out on Twitter at certain times in the stock market and called for a huge crash that never came uh and record highs. I mean, just because someone&#39;s brilliant and a billionaire doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re brilliant at everything that they do. uh you know, I&#39;m I&#39;m good at one thing, picking stocks. If you ask me about Bitcoin, and I and I offer an opinion, well, shame on you for listening to me. That&#39;s not what I do. That&#39;s not in my lane. Um now, that said, he&#39;s got a tremendous amount of experience having headed Doge for 130 days and cutting $175 billion of cost, $1.5 billion a day. At that pace, they could cut a trillion within a year and a half. They&#39;ve taken the ex Doge employees and made political appointments in every agent. So the the headline that it&#39;s going to be part of the DNA of government under this administration is not fluff. It&#39;s true. Uh and I think they will actually fulfill on a lot more cuts than than advertised or than is expected. So he has a lot of heft when he says that. I don&#39;t think he has a thousand hours to read it. But I can guarantee you if he fed it into Grock, which is probably one of the best AI models, which is his model, uh he&#39;d come to slightly different conclusions. At the end of the day, it&#39;s got to get passed. Okay? And we&#39;re not going to we&#39;re not going to balance it on a mathematical equation. The only way we&#39;re going to have a possibility of balancing it is if this economy runs hot as hell. And the only way they&#39;re going to run this economy hot as hell is is growthled strategies, massive deregulation, bringing down the capital requirements for banks, increasing lending, bringing down rates, and hoping for the best. hoping you know look there there is a faith that inflation doesn&#39;t get out of control and the recency bias of the last three years is oh watch out for inflation but that was a one-time you know supply shock that we had because the world shut down for two years and people keep extrapolating with recency bias that because it happened during a once in aundred year event it&#39;s guaranteed to happen and then you&#39;ve got the Arthur Burns nonsense from the 1970s which is a completely apples to orange comparison you know as they say in Texas that old dog don&#39;t hunt. So, uh, so I would suggest, uh, you know, that that we look at history clearly and look past the 70s and look to the 50s, the last time we were in this situation, 120% debt to GDP, and follow that playbook, which I do think the administration, minus Powell, is attempting to do uh, and we&#39;ll we&#39;re going to be just fine. What do you think, David? I I think you know the truth doesn&#39;t live on the extremes and and we have two extremes here. Uh yes uh the growth will solve a lot of problems but there&#39;s a balance here and if you go back to to to World War II post World War II and the growth that we had after that you got to remember where the entitlements were at the t at that time when FDR came up with social security the average life expectancy was 57 years old. No one was going to collect. Today it&#39;s a different equation and it&#39;s growing exponentially. As for Elon Musk, I think what frustrates Elon is he is the legislative process and he&#39;s a CEO. He&#39;s used to coming into a company, seeing the problems, identifying them, and fixing them quickly. Unfortunately, Congress doesn&#39;t work that way because politicians have competing priorities. Uh fixing the country, that&#39;s second on their list. The first thing is bring home the bacon and uh bring what what&#39;s what they need to do uh to get reelected. And that means bringing home legislative priorities that either bring projects to their district or protect themselves in the case of Medicaid. I can understand why Lisa Marowski, Susan Collins, and those they&#39;re never going to embrace anything in in the Medicaid cuts because the Democrats are going to use it uh against them and they&#39;re vulnerable. And that&#39;s the problem with the legislative process and it&#39;s why we end up with these big giant bills that are nothing more than a big giant compromise. But I agree the only solution here is we got to get the bill through. So let me ask the two of you my favorite question these days. Imagine you&#39;re 25 years old and you have 10,000 bucks and you have to invest it. David, first, how would you allocate that given everything we&#39;re now facing? Where would you put that money to work? Well, if you&#39;re 25 years old, you&#39;re totally riskone. There&#39;s no such thing as a balanced portfolio. You don&#39;t you don&#39;t put it in treasuries. You&#39;re going to you&#39;re going to look at where the secular trend is at the moment. And that&#39;s clearly AI. That&#39;s the bright spot spot of this economy is clearly the biggest uh technological shift, technology shift in my lifetime. It will be the driver of capital investment for the next 10 maybe 20 years. So, that&#39;s where you would put your money right now. And you would just put it in there. you would forget about it. You&#39;d forget the volat volatility and just hang on. Thomas, all right, I take a different side. Uh, I think they&#39;re going to bring down the longer end of the curve as as advertised. I think that&#39;s going to be really exceptionally good for housing. Now, look, Adam, they call me turnaround Tom for a reason. I&#39;m always buying things that are out of favor and waiting for them to recover. So, what&#39;s what&#39;s dramatically out of favor as a function of rates being high is uh housing and housing related businesses. So, I don&#39;t want to deal with the waring factions. I don&#39;t want to buy Dr. Horton. I don&#39;t want to buy PY, but I do want to buy the building suppliers like QXO, uh, which Brad Jacobs is running as a rollup. He put $900 million of his own money. Uh, he did that in, uh, XPO Logistics in 2011. You basically made, you know, many bags like 69, 79 times your money over a period of 10 years. He did United Rentals, the equipment leasing in the late 90s. You basically made over 50 times your money if you had invested with him over 15 years. And uh and he&#39;s doing a new one and and he&#39;s put a lot of his own money in it. He started with Beacon Roofing, you know, uh does a lot of commercial roofing. If your roof leaks, it&#39;s not a, you know, should we get the pink one or the blue one? Uh should we shouldn&#39;t we? It&#39;s like fix my roof, you know, I want the water out of my living room. And uh that&#39;s a great business. He paid 10 times IBIDA, but he&#39;ll do what he always does is bring in technology. He&#39;ll double IBIDA over the next few years and we&#39;ll be off to the races. He expects as usual, it&#39;s an $800 billion business. He&#39;ll he&#39;ll roll up about 50 to 80 billion topline with double digit EBID margins, which effectively means your $16 stock will be 70 80 90 $100 uh probably five, six, seven years out. So AI or not, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get too many five to seven baggers over the next handful of years with a proven winner who constantly makes money for his shareholders. And then if you want more subdued things, doubles and triples in the next few years, you buy something like a Generrack, which is tied to housing and interest rates, uh leader in home standby generators. It sounds silly, but with power outages going up, with data center backups on the commercial side, uh, and with home building, which is going to boom again with this administration, by the way, because they&#39;re going to open up about 500, it would take about 512,000 acres of public land uh, of the the tens of millions in order to uh, get 3 4 million new starter homes. So, you know, some of the areas are actually in rural, but actually quite a few are of the federally owned lands are, as people don&#39;t know, in metropolitan areas. So, they&#39;re going to open up the federal lands. Besson&#39;s going to change the capital requirements at banks to create a tremendous amount of demand for treasuries. Maybe you get the Genius Act legislation. And uh if you&#39;re Gen Z, you realize that the biggest part of portion of the population is uh the millennials, 72 millennials. They&#39;re in their mid-30s. They want to buy houses, they just can&#39;t. We need to build a bunch of 1500 square foot houses. Think Levittown post World War II versus not everyone needs a 4500 ft starter home with an indoor pool uh which is what the supply is in the market right now. So they need to uh rectify that imbalance. The administration knows this. They are taking the actions to do so. So I would play that theme. Uh I&#39;m not discounting AI. AI is going to be an unbelievable secular theme. So you&#39;re going to want to have some exposure. Question is how. But I think in terms of the next three years doubling and tripling, there&#39;s a lot of opportunity because some of these stocks are down 70 80% and the businesses are throwing off record free cash flow. I just did an interview with an analyst at my other, you know, my other job and we were talking about because of AI demand for electricity and where the investment opportunities are with grid build. Um, some people you saw the meta deal yesterday with nuclear, but what this individual was saying was NAT gas. Listen, everyone stand by. We&#39;re going to take a quick break and when we come back we&#39;re gonna and we&#39;re back and this is how you can follow Adam Shapiro if you like his show on uh X Twitter. AJ Shaps and there you go. Uh wanted to cover a couple of things. Here is a chart. This is bullish percent. We covered a lot. You could see many of the sectors are are um towards the top end of the range. I do think on balance with fits and starts this this this rally should continue through midsummer. Uh there&#39;s a lot of strength in the rally but some groups like staples bullish percent staples you can see is uh at the lowest level among the other sectors at 40%. And today we&#39;re covering ironically two staples uh which is going to be exciting. So, telecom is down there. Transports have had a move. Uh, utilities are down there. Got to see if there&#39;s any utilities to do. I don&#39;t think so yet, but Staples is an area I want to focus on. A lot of them gotten beaten down. Um, you can see some of these others have moved to the top of the range. And healthcare, staples, healthcare, all the defensives. And you know, we covered defensives relative to discretionary are uh and defensive positioning are at very low levels. So you you do want to have some of these if we hit some volatility. Uh and uh in the case of Hormell, they they&#39;re a dividend aristocrat, so you get paid almost 4% while you wait. We&#39;re going to cover that later today. Peter Lynch, time is on your side when you own shares of superior companies. Warren Buffett, look at market fluctuations as your friend rather than your enemy. Profit from folly rather than participate in it. It&#39;s amazing to see uh with, you know, uh Alibaba has been down a few points on the China uncertainty. They&#39;re supposed to talk on Friday. We&#39;ll see. Um and Cooper Standard on a couple of uh the steel tariffs and a couple of other things. And with those two down, the the portfolios just keep going up and up and up. and wait till those two two things rip back higher where we&#39;re going to be a super super exciting time to be in the markets and again super hats off for everyone who came in in the hole and everyone who added money in the hole and uh and still a lot more to do uh and we&#39;re going to talk about some uh as you heard with Adam Shapiro and I and we didn&#39;t cover it with Sean Caleb&#39;s but uh uh the housing theme and we&#39;ve covered that a lot QXO Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Generrack, etc. These things haven&#39;t even left the starting line. Yeah, they&#39;re up a little bit, but compared to where they&#39;re going to be. Uh so, a lot of exciting things. And we we spent a lot of time in the last week adding to some of our our uh specialized derivative overlays on those positions so that when they turn and how they turn and one material stock in particular um these things are all going to be between four and some of them are set up for expected value of 8x. So we&#39;re excited about that. Um Dallio, if you&#39;re not aggressive, you&#39;re not going to make money. That&#39;s why we do the derivative overlay special for our clients. If you&#39;re not defensive uh by using low leverage uh like we do with our clients, you&#39;re not going to keep money. So, it&#39;s a it&#39;s a balance of both uh quantified risk with high expected value coupled with a strong rockolid um concentrated portfolio of great businesses that we would want to own the whole business in each case. Sloomer, let&#39;s take a look at the charts from my buddy. You know who you are. Okay, let&#39;s take just broad overview. Okay, you can see the market&#39;s come back a lot, but not really overbought here on a weekly. You know, this thing has some room to run. That&#39;s why I think I do think I mean I know you got Tom Lee out calling for 6,600. Um, and this thing Fibonacci extension looks like 6,900. Question is when, you know, by the end of the year, I don&#39;t know. But certainly uh I think this thing wants to push to new highs particularly because the rest of the world is at new highs. So the S&amp;P kind of has to play catch-up and that&#39;s why I think we&#39;ve got more to go into mid July. Um advanced decline line is showing showing real strength. This is not yet overbought. The the uh the uh bearishness is not washed out and the bullishness is nowhere near euphoria. So I think we&#39;ve got more to do. The small caps I think is going to be huge opportunity. The 493 by the way by January 1st quarter 2026 will be the first time that the 493 earnings growth overtake the MAG7 earnings growth at 10.3% uh estimated earnings growth in Q1 uh versus 10.2% 2% for the Mag 7 and that is down big from um you know MAG 7 was at 33% growth. So by Q1 and and that is down from so Q that&#39;s just in one year Q1 of this year max 7 was 27.7 and um 493 was 9.4% 4% earnings growth one year from one, you know, now it&#39;s three quarters from now. Uh that&#39;s going to flip and 493 will be better. And that&#39;s where there&#39;s that&#39;s why there&#39;s still so much incredible opportunity that will evaporate very very quickly. Uh I think if you&#39;re not in in the next, you know, six, seven weeks, you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going to miss a huge amount. Uh yeah, there will be like uh some groups that have been highf flyers that will get smashed and you might be able to buy them, but um that&#39;s the story there. Uh international equity outperformance is still going, record buybacks. Uh and the other thing I wanted to cover with regard to uh treasury yields and I touched on it with Adam about the SLR uh lowering capital require or exempting treasuries from banks having to hold capital against it. So the demand for treasuries would go up, 10-year yield would go down, real estate takes off. That&#39;s going to happen this summer. Then the other thing which I hadn&#39;t really spent a lot of time on because it&#39;s not my world although PayPal is is pretty big in stable coins uh and a good and my friend from Dubai was saying you know PayPal could be a play on stable coin I I agree I hadn&#39;t that that&#39;s just whipped cream like all the whipped cream you have in Baba that&#39;s not my core thesis but uh it could be big but what&#39;s bigger than that is if the Genius Act goes through it not only helps PayPal it helps uh massive demand for US treasuries because the stable coins is uh two and a half 250 billion market cap right now it could reach two trillion that means there&#39;ll be 1.75 trillion excess demand for US treasuries which will compress yields which will get it get all the debt refinanced at the same time getting massive growth tax cuts deregulation etc. Um, and if you actually uh put the big beautiful bill into uh the AI model of your choice, chat GBT, etc., what you&#39;re going to find is actually the bill is much more fiscally responsibility responsible than uh either the CBO, which has never been right about anything, or uh the negative headlines you&#39;re seeing all day. Uh, as it relates to Musk, I I said my piece on that with uh with Adam um did a huge service to the country uh in terms of cutting costs, but uh he&#39;s not a market prognosticator. Uh never has been and he has uh made a lot of bad calls over the years as it relates to the stock market as it relates to building businesses and and changing the world. No one&#39;s better uh and and no one can hold a candle to him. But in ter term as far as market stuff goes, uh that&#39;s not been his strong suit. So here&#39;s a huge opportunity. record short interest, record flushing, selling on small caps. Just hang in there. It&#39;s It&#39;s been building this monstrous base for three years, four years now. I think this is going to break out and it&#39;s not going to look back and it&#39;s going to be so massive, you can&#39;t even imagine. So, uh, we&#39;re loading up there. Uh, UK, same story. That&#39;s GXO. Hang Sang went back to retest this line. My guess is based on how things are set up, they&#39;ll, you know, fits and starts. they&#39;ll get some type of agreement or they already kick the can to August. Now, uh once they get some sense of positive news, this could just rip rip higher to new highs, which would take Baba with it back over 150 and uh off to the races. So, we&#39;re excited about that. Whether it happens this week or in a couple months, I have no idea. But I will say uh Ishwinder sent me these two things. I&#39;ve covered these seasonality charts in the past. I kind of forgot about them. But if you look at the seasonality of China, Kweb, uh June is the best month of the year. And same for Alibaba, uh June is uh June, the back half of the year is the is the biggest time for uh Alibaba share price seasonality, and that&#39;s the 8-year basically uh 8-year range. Uh, so that could be pretty good. And it kind of coincides with Xi talking with Trump, who Trump said he&#39;s always liked and always will. So, um, I mean, that&#39;s probably a good way to sit down to dinner with that type of framework in mind. Yield starting to come back down. Dollar, uh, record, you know, hasn&#39;t been this low since, uh, 2021, basically early 2022. Uh, that theme continues to play out. International continues to outperform. The looney is breaking out. I told you my lovely Canadians, my buddies. Uh, you lost a little faith here with the overshoot. This is called dispondency. This is called Euphoria. We&#39;re headed back to Euphoria, ladies and gentlemen. It&#39;ll in fits in starts. It&#39;ll happen. Energy definitely looks like it&#39;s putting in a base. Comtock, it just won&#39;t stop. I mean, that thing is off to the races. Um, and there you go. I mean again I haven&#39;t found anything that&#39;s like super compelling if you gun to my head Hallebertton and Slumber but gun not to my head so I&#39;m not doing it. Uh then uh I I I think they&#39;re just better return on dollars invested in materials right now. Uh so that&#39;s where I want to be beat down and in housing and rate sensitive stuff and stuff that like I just know is a slam dunk. Whereas energy, it just the EMPs have not come down enough for for me to get doubles and triples with my eyes closed. So, uh, you know, we&#39;re already on a triple with, uh, comtock and I think we got a lot more to go there. Uh, so, so that&#39;s how we&#39;re expressing it and we&#39;re perfectly content with that. Let&#39;s take a look at some of these. I think all these go back to the top of the range as I&#39;d said, but with earnings decelerating by twothirds, earnings growth rate decelerating by 2/3, I think top of the range is going to be it for a while. And I think the 493 with accelerating earnings are going to continue to uh catch up and then exceed like the you know Caterpillars here, Packar, that&#39;s interesting. Amgen health care looking for more health care ladies and gentlemen I keep uh thinking about Fizer&#39;s pipeline is looking more and more attract attractive good dividend yield I don&#39;t like the CEO but um what else we got here that&#39;s that all right let&#39;s go down to the rest of the charts here Um, this one is from Allen. You know who you are. Consumer sentiment index and subsequent 12-month returns. We haven&#39;t had consumer sentiment this low since uh 1975, 1980, 1990, 2008 lows, 2011 lows, and 2022 lows. Uh and each subsequent time, the next 12 months, you had 12 20 plus on average 20 plus% returns. whether it was 17, 15, 22, 29, 20, and 22 each time, it&#39;s a positive thing. Uh, Atlanta GDP now has shot up to 4.6% GDP for Q2. Even if they&#39;re half right, uh, you&#39;ve got uh, recession off the table because you don&#39;t have two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth. By the way, thanks for all the orders and support on the merch. I know we sold out of the golf shirts. I think they should be back in store. Just keep checking. Got my beautiful mug here. And send in more pictures. I know a lot of you guys are shy about the pictures. We&#39;ll get you on the website. You can see some of the other folks uh who already did that, which we celebrated last week. Um M2 Money Supply, very difficult to be bearish when M2 money supply is back at an all-time high. It just overtook the high reached in April 2022 peak. People continue to flush out of Japanese equities. Um defensives as a percentage of the S&amp;P, lowest since 2000. That was a great time to buy defensives. So, we&#39;re going to cover two today. Uh Hong Kong listings through May, the highest since 2021. The game is back on. in China equities, foreign inflows to US equity funds annualizing at 138 billion. So, uh, and income needed to buy a home by state. This is really interesting. Uh, with New York, Montana, Washington, and California being the highest income required just to buy a uh, three-bedroom home. Unbelievable. You need to earn $210,000 to buy a simple threebedroom home in California. Um I I said my piece with Adam on uh Powell needs to do something and he needs to do it quickly and we need a little bit of inflation in order to uh outgrow debt to GDP and get back to 60 50 60% like we did post World War II. Uh, and that&#39;s that percentage of stocks that outperform the S&amp;P 500 index. That is now starting to come back. S&amp;P 500 is on track for its biggest monthly gain in May since 1990. That was so exciting to experience. Even years that gained 20% have a bad day. Uh, okay. That must have been on a bad day that he put that out. Dietrich, what do we got here? Earnings growth, as I said, was 13% expected to be 5% next quarter. Um but estimates holding up 300 still for next year which is 19.3 times next year&#39;s earnings which is the 5-year average is I&#39;m sorry 19.9 times 2026 earnings as of today. 5-year average is 19.9 times. Dollar weakness continued to be ahead a tailwind for S&amp;P earnings in the second half and for international stocks. Buyback announcements at a record 665 billion. So all of this traders are now starting to plow into TLT. So that&#39;s good to see. Uh 28% of homes sold above final listing price. Okay. Not in Florida and Texas. Those markets are softening up a little bit. Uh that&#39;s usually a precursor for the rest of the country. Um the amount of supply and sellers versus buyers is now like a 500,000 point spread. 500,000 difference. I think it&#39;s 1.5 million sellers to 1 million buyers. Uh so that should put some pressure on prices. Uh, okay. No clear relationship between level of bond yields and equity returns. Data since 1940. That&#39;s from Robert Schiller and Goldman Sachs. That&#39;s interesting. But if you do value versus growth, it starts to matter. Bankruptcy filings are down. Credit card delinquencies are up though. Um, hedge funds were net sellers again. institutions were net sellers and retail were net buyers. Uh very very similar to the 2022 lows. They bought the dip and they&#39;ve been right since uh co pretty much. Despite improved sentiment, aggregate equity position was largely unchanged and overall remains light skewing the pain trade to the upside. So they&#39;ve got um they have the risk parody ones are the last ones to flip. They always get it wrong. Um, retail portfolio weights in MAG 7 have been declining European stocks beat US by the most on record ever. Okay. And that was our big theme. Remember last four fourth quarter, listen to all the podcast, I said international. It was very hard to say when they they underperformed so dramatically last year. Now they&#39;ve outperformed uh by a record amount. Chinese firms see more just domestic revenue amid tariff risk automotive sales volume 2025. So everyone&#39;s saying oh it&#39;s a big drop um since last month but if you look year on year it&#39;s a big jump and that will continue. Treasury debt buyback paramount accepted. So you&#39;re seeing the Treasury now in the market. We&#39;re going to cover that in a second. Prime Book Global E equities there were sellers in the hole. Now they&#39;re massive buyers. That doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s over. They always have to catch up and then you get months and months of follow through. Uh data centers empowered large large projects EV battery. Okay. Uh bull bear sentiment. You can see here this is not yet extreme. That&#39;s why we continue to think this is going into midsummer. I think August, September, we&#39;re going to get some chop. But um the next, you know, eight weeks is going to be a great opportunity. uh average daily equity flows versus the S&amp;P performance. All right, we skip that. Here it is. 500,000 more sellers than buyers. That&#39;s a huge huge spread. Last time you saw that was uh 2014 and 2015. Okay, so here is Ray Dallio&#39;s history of debt crash is imminent. Uh in 19 in 2015 he said this is a 1937 repeat. We&#39;re going to crash. 2016 he said we&#39;re at the end of the dead cycle. Two uh I really don&#39;t like doing these type of charts to be honest with you. I mean the guy&#39;s made a ton of money. Obviously he&#39;s gotten a few things very very right and done an incredible job and put out a nice book. But you can see here over the last 12 years he&#39;s been negative every step of the way. And uh I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re wrong for 10 years. Does that make you right? If you&#39;re right the you know 17th time you called for the end of the world and the market&#39;s up 400% in the interim. I I don&#39;t know. But um that&#39;s that you know this is just data. This is just one more data point. So when he goes on TV, by the way, um, who had that out? Um, Seth did. This one again, another absolute legend. But, you know, as as people get older, they get more defensive. And um he posted, Seth posted um Paul Tudtor Jones at the absolute lows in April saying the market was Here we go. Here we go. May 6, 2025. Paul Tudtor Jones says stock market will hit new lows even if Trump cuts China tariffs to 50%. Okay, so here&#39;s a guy who probably sold in the hole on April 6th and 7th and a month later the things rallied up and he&#39;s begging for a retest and it just never came and it&#39;s going to continue to push higher. It doesn&#39;t make him it doesn&#39;t change the fact that the guy&#39;s a legend and he made a fortune for himself and for his investors early in his career just like uh Ray Dallio did. They&#39;re both absolute legends. But just because they&#39;re billionaires doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re right about everything. And what happens is, and the reason I&#39;m spending any time on this because I do admire what these guys accomplished, um, is that, you know, when they&#39;re when when you become that successful, their fingers are off the pulse or they&#39;re just it it I I just seen it over and over. you get to a certain age, you get very pessimistic and defensive and there&#39;s a chronic amount of um well, it was good when I was coming up, but now everyone else is screwed. And I think that&#39;s the way people deal with death. They just say, well, I was lucky to, you know, be in when I when I was in everything was great and you could make money. Now everyone&#39;s screwed. There&#39;s never been a better time in history to be starting out than right now. The fact that you can get on a device like this and communicate to a million people at once at basically zero cost if you have something valuable to say um never existed before. So the future&#39;s extremely bright. the fact that you can go into Grock or uh Chat GPT and put in a thousandpage uh beautiful build document and actually come out with a real summary, a substantive summary that you could make decisions on in, you know, 5 minutes uh versus spending 5 days reading the thousandpoint bill and not being um influenced by fake headlines about how bad it is when in fact uh it&#39;s actually a very decent bill. And and I think unfortunately Elon Musk should put the bill into Grock because Grock is absolutely amazing and really understand what&#39;s in it. I&#39;m sure it could be better. I I agree with him. I&#39;d love to cut everything, but we&#39;re not going to get to uh if you cut as much as you think you to balance a mathematical equation and you leave out the most important factor, which is grow and inflate your way out of debt, you&#39;re going to have a depression. You know, you should be much more afraid of deflation and depression by cutting too much than a little bit of above trend inflation like you had from 1948 to 1958 when they brought down debt to GDP through massive growth policies from 120 down to 63. So, um, so anyway, tangent but worthwhile one. Uh, percentage of S&amp;P 500 stocks outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the calendar year. So, this is starting to pick back up. Stock pickers paradise. More clues. The bulls are in charge. Performance after 5% in May. 12 months later up 19.9% which is consistent with the first chart we sold showed on consumer confidence. Slowing in April spending is likely payback after the tariff front running. That&#39;s natural. Same with cars. Dollar&#39;s relationships to US yields has broken down. That&#39;s when we play catchup. So, you&#39;re either going to have the yields catch down or the dollar catch up. Uh, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if they kind of meet in the middle a little bit in the short term on the dollar, but I&#39;d be more inclined to expect yields to catch down with the SLR change and possibly the stable coin demand. China sending goods to US through Vietnam. I mean, I talk, look, I talk to uh friends that manufacture stuff and they&#39;re just like, you know, we&#39;re just the only ones that are winning are the shippers. We just send to a different country and it gets to where it gets to and that&#39;s how it works. So, this is kind of just nonsense. five-year rolling returns of USMCA uh MSCI USA minus MSCI world XUS versus US dollar index. So, as you can see, US, you know, again, international outperforms in Reagan&#39;s second term, then US outperforms under Clinton, then international outperforms under Bush, then uh US outperforms under Obama and Biden and first term of Trump. And then I think we&#39;re getting to the point where uh like Reagan uh international is going to outperform for the next four years. It&#39;s not because America&#39;s lost its exceptionalism. We&#39;ll always be the innovators. We&#39;ll always be the creators. We&#39;ll always be the biggest GDP. Uh all of that stuff certainly in our lifetimes. But um as far as equity performance, we pulled forward a lot. Now it&#39;s it&#39;s going to change and and that&#39;s that. Uh value stocks in versus international stocks. Manufacturing is currently just 8% of US jobs. Public construction spending is picking up. Here&#39;s the buybacks. Record announcement of buybacks, highest since 2018. That long endow Jones futures is starting to rise. third time we have most hated rally since 2020. And what uh Tom Lee is pointing out here. Here we go. Right at the top here, twothirds of fund managers say stocks are still in a bare market. They doubled again the next 18 months. Here, stock market just made the same mistake again. Here&#39;s why experts are worried about the latest rally. And then it doubled again. And here we go. We can see a new low relative to the April low. says fair leads Katie Stockton and we&#39;ll probably break out from here and double again. So, uh S&amp;P 500 after rallying from eight negative 18% below its 502- week high to negative3% below its 52- week that should be low to high uh within 50 days. One year later, you&#39;re up 20%. Again consistent with DRI numbers consistent with the um sentiment numbers extended is the market leadership for US equities come to an end for now. So this is uh a theme. So we just covered the US versus international going back to international outperformance and we are dealing with [Music] um another version of that with Europe out outperforming US covered the GDP now realized and consensus EPS growth for select US equity indices. Uh 2025, the Russell 2000 small caps already have 18% earnings growth versus the S&amp;P 500 at 7, I guess, blended. Not sure how they get to that. I guess year to date um estimated for next year is looks like about 13% on the S&amp;P for 2026. Well, we can just figure that out. 300 divided by 265 is 13%. Wow, I&#39;m pretty good at that. Um, and then next year for the Russell 2000, if you&#39;re not in small caps, with record short interest and expected 36% earnings growth with a mid- teens multiple, um, I don&#39;t know what else to tell you. Take up another hobby, but small caps are the place to be. Yeah, it&#39;s taking a while. You&#39;ve got this multi-year base, but this is going to be a beast. uh gap between S&amp;P 500 implied dividend yield and bond yields is even larger. Uh okay. Yeah, they dominate earnings growth, but look at the deceleration. It&#39;s unbelievable these headlines. Here&#39;s from Yahoo Finance. Magnificent 7 are still dominating earnings growth. really they&#39;re going from 35% earnings growth last year to 9% earnings growth by Q3 of this year and then they&#39;ll they&#39;ll top out around 10% and the unmagnificent 493 are reacelerating from effectively flat back to 10% uh in the same time period and you can pay you know 3/4 2/3 to 3/4 of the multiple uh for more earnings growth and everyone else is looking in the rearview mirror versus through the windshield. Consumers expect a change in inflation rates. So that&#39;s that&#39;s up. That&#39;s usually the the peak. Here&#39;s the S&amp;P fighting with the 6,000 back to new highs. I think we&#39;re going to push through in coming weeks or days. Uh 2025 is the Rocky Balboa market. Unsold. I mean, this is unbelievable. The market&#39;s only up 22 basis. What is this? Oh, average return after a down day. I see. Unsold housing inventory is worth a record 698 billion. So, there&#39;s a lot of supply there. Uh there&#39;s 331 billion worth of stale inventory lingering on the market. That&#39;s US homes for sale. This is all Powell. All Powell. And you can tell me, look, if Powell lowered if if Powell lowered to the inflation rate, which is neutral, he&#39;s almost 200 basis points too restrictive right now. Um, you&#39;d have a whole proliferation of 7-year arms based off short rates. So, everyone says, &quot;Yeah, 30-year fix or based off the 10-year, but you&#39;d have a whole bunch of option arms at um, you know, five year, sevenyear to get these kids in the houses interest only. They could, you know, as their income go, they could get into a 30-year fix. Uh, and it would be unbelievable for the country and the building and the construction. I mean, you want to you want to talk about you forget about manufacturing iPhones and t-shirts in America. That&#39;s just stupid. But what we manufacture in America is houses. Okay? So, you get that game back on, the amount of jobs you&#39;re going to see is through the roof. The trades, the jobs, these are all highpaying uh skilled trade jobs. That&#39;s manu. We manufacture houses. That&#39;s what we do in America. So, we got to get the immigration back up, which is down. I&#39;m not talking necessarily uh illegal. I&#39;m talking legal, but open the gates. You don&#39;t have to charge people $5 million. We don&#39;t want a bunch of lazy trust fund people coming into our country. We want hungry, smart, hungry people who want to work and most of them will start businesses and employ a lot of people. That&#39;s what made America great and that was what will continue to make America great. Not a bunch of people uh writing $10 million checks for a Trump gold card and uh and sitting around uh uh drinking Dagio spirits. I mean that&#39;s not what we need. I mean it won&#39;t hurt us but it&#39;s not going to help us. Flows into foreign doiciled US equity ETFs uh down. So that&#39;s that&#39;s uh showing that global equities breaking out to new highs. Dollar short position stays close to highest since 2023. Mag 7, they&#39;re unwinding. Carry trade index of carry trade returns hit seven-year high in May. S&amp;P 500 trails the rest of the world by the most since 1993. Guys, go back to our Q4 podcast. Every single week we were saying international. It was so unpopular. And here we go. Uh, and that&#39;s that with the data. Uh, we covered that. Let&#39;s go through some of the headlines. Alibaba JD.com sales surge during 618 shopping festival on the back of subsidy program. Uh, action in Hong Kong equity market stirs most excitement in years. This game is just starting, guys. I had someone DM me, &quot;This is so hard to to hold.&quot; Then don&#39;t hold it. I I don&#39;t know what to tell you, but uh uh if you know what you own and you understand the company and you&#39;ve done your work, it&#39;s just uh there&#39;s nothing to really think about. All right. Mainland Chinese households set to buy another hundred billion dollars of of Hong Kong stocks. Remember the stock connect? Well, we said that and now it&#39;s happening. China consumers are spending in smaller cities. It&#39;s the power of the new middle class. Trickle of global inflows and Alibaba being the toll taker. 404 40 cents of every dollar of e-commerce. China is the biggest e-commerce country in the world. Trickle of global inflows to Chinese stocks could become a flood, says Cambridge Associates. Even after recent gains, China and Hong Kong stocks are still attractive versus US equities firms. Asia head says. Uh Ford reports 16% sales increase in May amid employee pricing, i.e. incentives, ladies and gentlemen. We&#39;ve talked about that since May 2022 when we put on the position at the low fives and now it&#39;s at 21 uh and just getting started. Proposed new auto loan tax deduction could help buyers get a break on interest payments. This is a big deal. Proposed new auto loan tax deduction could help buyers get a break on interest payments. Um there you go. Boeing to resume airplane deliveries to China next month, ramp up max production. CEO says, &quot;We love that. We took profits on all of our options last week at huge multiples. And uh we didn&#39;t sh sell one share of stock, nor will we for many for a long time to come. Boeing 737 max production tops 38 jets per month for first time in years. Uh how Lilo and Stitch became one of the most profitable movies in years. originally was aimed for Disney Plus, but it was rerouted to a theatrical release and is on pace for at least 950 million in ticket sales. How you doing, Disney? Is Treasury versus the Fed with the Fed sidelined? Bessent unleashes a record$10 billion bond buyback. You can read that at zero hedge. Feds daily still Fed&#39;s daily says still comfortable with two rate cuts in 2025. We agree whether it starts in June or September. September&#39;s at 78% chance. June would be possible if we got a a very weak report on Friday. Not holding my breath, but that uh that could be a catalyst that takes uh takes this rally parabolic to new highs into July. Um the end of easy US stock bet has been good to contrarians. More money flowed into long ignored diversification bets away from the US. Wall Street re sees deeper route as dollar nears 2023 low. Hedge funds buy stock at quickest pace since November 2024. Force buyers uh continue to come. That&#39;s from Goldman Sachs. That&#39;s what we&#39;ve been warning about since the lows. Uh warning in a good way and benefiting from in a better way. AI data center boom requires a lot of natural gas. How you doing comtock? Buy defensive stocks. You&#39;ll be glad you did. This from Jacob Sonenshine. Great article. We agree. Uh and that&#39;s the sector that hasn&#39;t yet caught up. So um let&#39;s talk about two of them. What the consumer wants, stock market and sentiment results. We&#39;re co covered Hormeell and Disney. Uh you can see the free cash flow here is doing great. They&#39;ve got plenty of runway. Gross margins are picking back up. They had a few missteps, but this stock will eventually double. And in the meantime, you collect 4%. Oh, and by the way, uh they they&#39;ve grown the dividend every single year. They uh for over 25 years, and we&#39;ll get into the details here. So, both companies we are covering this week are classic examples of what we like to call buying straw hats in the winter. In other words, these are highquality, durable businesses that we buy when they are temporarily impaired on the operating table. And time and time again, they miraculously leave the hospital walking on their feet, not lying on their backs. In the meantime, we sit on our hands, collect our dividends, and wait. Hormemell fits this description to a tea. This is a company that has been a compounding machine since 1891. Not 1991, not 2001, 1891. If you think this is the first cyclical draw down Hormel has seen in its 130 year plus history, think again. The story this time is that consumers no longer want packaged or processed food. Legacy products are being left behind as demand perhaps with a shot of GLP1 in the arm shifts towards lean. I think they put those in the ass, but anyway, uh shifts towards lean high protein diets. That trend is music to Hormell&#39;s ears. Over the past couple of years, they have effectively pivoted to becoming a branded protein ccentric powerhouse. More than 60% of sales now come from meat and protein richch foods. Jenny Oo is the number one ground turkey brand. Applegate is a leader in premium organic meats. Planters continues to grow as a protein richch snack brand. All three are shooting the lights out and gaining share. Just listen to Hormell&#39;s recent earnings calls. Uh and by the way, you forgot about spam. Uh everyone in Hawaii eats spam. You can have this sushi made with spam. It&#39;s incredible. This quarter, my kids eat it. They know what it&#39;s actually called. Uh this quarter, management said the sushi with the spam because uh one of them doesn&#39;t. One of them only eats cheeseburgers and chicken. Her sushi is the spam with rice. I don&#39;t The other one will eat I mean unbelievable. She&#39;ll eat uh sashimi and you know she was eating sashimi when she was like nine. She orders more sophisticated things than than we do. Um okay. This quarter management said the word protein 15 times. Last year it was 12 times. Two years ago just four. They are leaning into the trend and are arguably one of the best ways to play it. Management is expecting a strong second half driven by, you guessed it, the core protein brands. Meanwhile, they are on track to deliver over 250 million in operating income growth by 2026 as they work to restore margins to historical levels. The way we see it, you have strong topline growth fueled by protein obsession, a margin inflection on deck, and a stock trading at a historic trough multiple. Give it a few more quarters like Q2, maybe say protein a few more times, and the stock should eventually earn a rerating and be back to fresh highs within the next two to three years. Until then, we&#39;re happy to sit tight and collect a near 4% dividend and growing, by the way, off our basis while we wait. So, you can go through all the sales numbers and stats. I think um you know, topline growth growing, margins increasing, reacelerating, perfectly targeted for what the consumer wants, 59 consecutive years of dividend increases. So, I mean, this is like what Buffett did with Coca-Cola. He now gets more dividends than his basis every single year uh when he bought it in 1989. The dividend keeps increasing. He bought it at a basis when it was in a draw down and uh now he gets more dividends uh per year than he originally spent on buying the stock. And that&#39;s what happens with these type of compounders. 96 plus years of dividend payments without interruption through the great depression, through the great financial crisis, etc. So you can see uh the Applegate growing and all these other things. Um what else are we looking at here? You can go go through the conference call. We&#39;ve highlighted all the important parts for you to really understand what you own. Uh and then Dagio. Okay, here&#39;s another stock in it down 50%. Uh same thing during the uh uh tech wreck in 2000 and during the great financial crisis in 2009. always recovers along with cash flow over and over. Same story. Cash flow declines, it recovers. Cash flow declines, it recovers. Re revenues have already increased. Now they&#39;re going to get the cash flow. Gross margins are starting to inflect. It&#39;s all right in front of you. This thing will be a double over the next few years. Uh and um just as Horell has been priced like packaged foods are a thing of past. By the way, they&#39;re buying in a ton of stock. uh down from 700 and basically 690 million ADRs outstanding to now 550 million going down to 525. Just as Hormell has been priced like a packaged foods are a thing in the past, Diagio stock has been cut in half and is trading as if consumers will never sip alcohol again. We&#39;re more than happy to take the other side of that trade. Yes, consent consumers may be drinking a bit less, but the trend is clear. drinking less but drinking better. And no one is better positioned to benefit from the long-term global premium premiumization trend than Diagio with an industryleading portfolio of 200 plus brands spanning every category and price point. Once again, the market has fallen victim to recency bias extrapolating postcoid softness into a permanent impairment across the entire industry. But zooming out, DAIO&#39;s history tells a much different story. Every 5 to 10 years, you see a cyclical downturn that plays out within the context of a long-term secular uptrend. The stock gets a bit ahead of its skis, digests for a couple years, and eventually recovers to new highs. Same story, different day. We expect this time to be no different. Fast forward to a couple years, and what you&#39;ll see is a stronger Dagio with a cleaned up balance sheet growing at mids singledigit clip, benefiting from margin tailwinds tied to premiumization, and a stock trading back above $200. In the meantime, we&#39;re happy to collect a nearly 4% dividend while the nervous Nellies keep asking if people will ever drink again. Meanwhile, they&#39;re drinking while they while they&#39;re so nervous. Uh, and by the way, similar to Hormell, what you can see with Diagio is an increasing dividend most every year for the most part and reacelerating even since in the last three years. They&#39;ve been growing that dividend and increasing buybacks. So, you can go through each segment as we laid out for you here in the article. Let&#39;s get to the top 10 points here and then we&#39;ll get on to the ask me anything questions. Nice to finally have a reasonably short podcast. While that loads, we&#39;re going to do exploration and production earnings are down. I don&#39;t think the stocks have come down enough yet for for for a lot of them which is why we haven&#39;t added earnings down 13% 12% for next year. They&#39;ll recover but um uh and then uh top 30 weights of industrials down 1% 1.5 and 1% for next year. Let&#39;s see who is the biggest contributor for that. RTX. Okay, Boeing&#39;s holding in there for next year. That&#39;s good. UNP in Pacific. Interesting. Okay. Um All right. Did all this get loaded? Yeah. You see the arcanic growth where it came from. All the growth year. This thing is back. It&#39;s reacelerating, guys. 75% of their brands are not affected by by US tariffs. 25% will be impacted. Uh consistent cash delivery. They&#39;re going to generate 3 billion of free cash flow peranom from fix fiscal 2026 forward. That&#39;s looks like a lot of runway for me. Bring their debt levels down. You know the story. Turnaround Tom does it again. This is how we do it. Ladies and gentlemen, durable businesses have been around for a hundred years if you know decades if not a hundred years generating cash inflecting margins reacelerating uh and and so on and so forth. Rinse repeat over and over. This one will be no different. We covered that. Uh economic data. I just want to point to Friday being important as it relates to whether we get a cut in June. Low probability or September. High probability is going to be this jobs number. Expecting 110,000 down from 167,000. Unemployment rate at 42. If this goes up to 4344, uh maybe there&#39;ll be some pressure and uh too late. Powell will will come to the table rather than try to predict the future of what inflation&#39;s going to be, you know, one year, 6 months, one year, two years down the road, uh, which which he can&#39;t do. So, for a group that says they&#39;re data dependent, it sounds to me like they&#39;re trying to make predictions because the data right now says they&#39;re 200 basis points too restrictive. Um, okay. So, with that said, we&#39;ll move on to the AMA. Those of you who like the AMA, let&#39;s go. Those of you who don&#39;t, we&#39;ll see you next week. same time, same place. Thanks for tuning in. And here we go with question number one from Nolan Connor bought Cooper Standard shortly after your first money show presentation. How do you generally look or set intrinsic exit price? Is it an estimate fair value multiple? Not looking for a specific number for CPS as a multibagger already, but just trying to build a mental framework. We&#39;ve covered this a million times. We think this thing&#39;s going to earn more than it did in 2017 at the peak of the cycle when we&#39;re doing 17.5 million. SAR, we think last time it earned 719, traded at 146 on a 20 times multiple. Peak multiple is 20 times, trough multiple was 10 times. We don&#39;t know which multiple we&#39;re going to get. So, if you look at it, we think it&#39;ll earn at least 10 bucks at the top of this cycle. So $10 trough multiple of 10 times is a $100 stock. Peak multiple of 20 times could be a lot more. Cut it in half if you&#39;re conservative. You still have a double or triple from here. And um uh we think it&#39;s got a lot of runway left. So um we&#39;ve covered that a lot. Welcome to the podcast. Thanks for joining us. Goran, huge thank you for your time and dedication. How do you feel about Tidewater uh for that second energy play? Uh we covered this one and the answer was no. Uh, let&#39;s see here. Yeah, I mean, this thing&#39;s already up 10x off the lows. Um, I think you&#39;re getting faked out because you&#39;re looking at price. I mean, obviously it&#39;s performing better, but I think you&#39;re going to find that uh the share count is too large. Let me take a look. Yeah, they&#39;ve doubled the share count just in the last six years. Uh I don&#39;t do business with people that cut my pie in half without asking me. He they basically stole half my money uh so they could keep their job. So uh no no bueno. I don&#39;t care if this thing goes up to a million. Not doing business with that scumbaggery. Uh as we say in Jersey scumbag. All right, moving on. Sweet green. This is from Chris Williamson. SG. I think I looked at this and the answer was maybe and I passed on it. Now it&#39;s still negative free cash flow. I did look at this and I passed on it. No, I know they&#39;re growing blah blah blah. It&#39;s a solid company though. Chopped went out of business. You know, it&#39;s it comes and goes. Aptive APV. This is another uh we covered this one. Aptv another auto parts thing. You&#39;re trying to play it a different way than Cooper. I think it&#39;s fine. I think Cooper&#39;s better. Um but let&#39;s see. A TV. See, with these cars, you I if this is Yeah. Cash flow&#39;s gone up, revenues gone up, margins are going back up. Yeah, you&#39;re probably fine with this one. But what do they do here? Cuz manufactured vehicle components, electrical, electronic, safety technology, commercial vehicle markets, signal and power solutions. Uh, definitely worth doing more work on for sure. I think you might might be on to something there. So, I&#39;m going to write that one down. Probably not going to do anything because I have my exposure to the auto industry, but um uh good work Johnny S. Hope you&#39;re great. Can you take a look at BTMD? Okay, this is a busted spa. We were talking about these as a possibility with my friends in Dubai as uh the other group of uninvestable. A lot of these are stigmatized just because they went through a spa and and some of them actually have decent businesses. [Music] Um provided they weren&#39;t sponsored by uh well you know who king of spaxs. All right. Uh BMD that&#39;s interesting. Uh 39 million of free cash flow. What&#39;s the market cap? Enterprise value is 130. What is this? A practice building business hormone optimization. Trains hormone optimization using bioididentical hormone replacement pellet therapy offers bio uh yeah look this is above my pay grade but the numbers look really good. So definitely worth uh doing some work on. Um. [Music] Hm. So, I got 100 million in debt, 38 million of free cash flow. Jesus. 39 million of cash income is growing. Hey man, uh Johnny S, I think you got a good one here, my man. So, I&#39;m going to do some work on this one. Nice work. All right, moving along. Daniel Borman, Pterodine. I think we cover this one every week. I think it&#39;s going to be fine. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get the bags that you&#39;re going to potentially get with um Intel, but it&#39;s a good enough business that you&#39;re not wrong. I just think there are higher and better uses of capital, but I&#39;m not going to say no, but it&#39;s not something that I would do. Um, River Ra, River Rahhee, take a look at PK play on the China recovery. A third of their Ibida is from Hawaii which is in a trough on visitation numbers from China. Yeah, that was the interesting thing. When I was in Hawaii, I said to one of the guys like where are all the Asians? Like why you know last time I was here it was all like Chinese and Japanese and that&#39;s kind of dried up. Um that will come back aggressively. I think there&#39;s a lot of back pent-up demand. I think you&#39;re right on this my man. Let&#39;s see here. Um, speaking of my man, I&#39;ve been listening to Charles Payne too much. I&#39;ll be on Charles Payne on the uh back in New York on the 21st. Uh, play some golf out in Connecticut. And then uh 203rd, Monday, I&#39;ll be on Charles Payne. 24th I will be on Varn and Co. All in studio. and 25th I&#39;ll be on the full hour of the Big Money Show. And in between there, I think I&#39;ve got 3:30 and 4 PM on Monday. Yahoo in studio, two hits, and probably Wednesday, either Monday or Wednesday morning, I&#39;ll have the New York Stock Exchange stuff with Kristen and possibly Schwab. Then I&#39;m going to try to get my friend Jason on Quaker Ridge uh and play that and then come back to Connecticut and show him our new course in Connecticut. They finished the back nine. It&#39;s incredible. I haven&#39;t played it yet. Super excited to get out there. Designed by Brian Schneider who did Old Banyan Top 50 course. Redid uh uh Garden City Tamarak. So super excited. The pictures are off the charts. Um uh I like this one. Let me just take a look at the balance sheet real quick. Okay, so you got three billion of debt secured by the buildings. You got Let&#39;s take a look at the free cash 500 million 400. Uh I think you&#39;re okay. I kind of like this one. kind of like this one in the discretionary category. Why not? Um, not bad. Good job, River. You guys are rocking it. Super excited. Tom Johnson, SVL, Shoe Carnival and Shoe Station. Okay, let&#39;s see. SC C SC VL. All right. So, revenues have come down a bit. Cash flow has kind of recovered. Gross margins are still weak. I mean, let&#39;s see. Are they selling sneakers? I mean, you look at Nike, casual sandals, everything. Uh, not in love with this. I&#39;d rather play it through Vans, but let&#39;s just take a look. 70 million of free cash. So there no long-term debt, just the leases. Yeah. Gross margins have to recover. Ah, you&#39;re probably okay. I like it. Good job, Tom. Man, we&#39;re getting some winners today. All right, SCVL [Music] Salvator. By the way, all this is opinion, not advice. Consult your financial adviser before you do anything. Go to hedge funtips.com. Click on terms, etc., etc., etc. Salvator Castro, EOS, EOLS. I guess it&#39;s a Botox knockoff. Yeah, the whole wellness thing is a big deal. All right, let&#39;s see here. Was this a spack? Still free cash flow negative. The revenues are growing pretty quickly. All right. 700 million enterprise value. So it&#39;s basically three times revs. This is a speculative play. So, you got to know the product inside out and upside down. And you&#39;ve got limited time to figure it out because you&#39;re losing cash. Your cash flow negative. got some cash in the bank. You got any debt? Yeah, it&#39;s not bad. Um, so this is just a product speculation, so you got to really be damn sure about the product. Uh, could certainly work, but, uh, kind of outside my realm of interest, but thank you for sending it in. Uh, okay. James asks, &quot;Just wondering what your opinion on how Trump&#39;s current steel tariffs will affect Cooper Sander for the rest of the year in 2026. Seems like it could be stuck in the mud for a while, Jim.&quot; Uh, yeah. No, it&#39;s not going to have an impact because you still have the average car on the road is 13 years old. You got millennials moving out. You got potentially the tax deduction on interest, you got incentives going up, um you got rates coming down, and you have massive pent-up demand. So, uh if steel tariffs adds three to $4,000 for car, um they&#39;ll just have to do employee pricing across the board, which is why we don&#39;t own the waring factions. I think the car producers, the OEMs are going to be producing a ton of cars at very thin margins and a race to the bottom. And the guys supplying the parts are going to make all the money. So, um, it&#39;s a rare part. Can you All right, David T. Can you revisit Cava? Okay. Everyone had a salad at Cava and they said, &quot;Great effing salad. Now, let&#39;s buy the stock.&quot; It doesn&#39;t always work that way. So, um, I like Cava, too. I have it all the time. It&#39;s right by my apartment in New York. And um what&#39;s surprising to me is this is still a relatively small business. All right. So it&#39;s all right. So it&#39;s a it&#39;s got a $9.5 billion enterprise value on 1 billion of sales. Okay. So everyone says it&#39;s going to be the next Chipotle. So let&#39;s see what Chipotle is. So Chipotle&#39;s got an enterprise value seven times bigger. 77 $73 billion on 11 billion of sales. Um, I don&#39;t think Greek Mediterranean has near the runway as Mexican. Everyone loves Mexican. Uh, I love cava. I think if I had to eat chipotle or cava every day, it would be Chipotle. I could eat cava once a week, but like it&#39;s not salad deals come and go, but I think cava is is a little bit special. Um, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to become the next Chipotle. Could it become half of Chipotle? Yes, I think it could. I think for sure it could become a third of Chipotle, which case you&#39;re talking a 30 billion market cap. [Music] Uh, I don&#39;t think it deserves to be trading at 10 times sales, but I understand the whole growth story and all the comparisons. I I&#39;d be an aggressive buyer between 40 and 50. I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see that. Uh, this is a broken Momo stock. It&#39;s going to take a little time to re to recover, but um I think if you bought it here long term and you don&#39;t care if it goes to 40 before it goes to to 250, I think you&#39;re okay. I think you&#39;re probably okay. Let me just check the balance sheet and everything. I I like the idea. I hate speculating. Give me a company that&#39;s been around for hundred something years that&#39;s down 50% and I can make a double on the recovery in a couple years. That&#39;s interesting to me. this I got to guess the future. Are people going to like salad as much as they like burritos? And the answer is I have no idea. They never have before. Maybe now it&#39;s different, but um it&#39;s never worked in the past. Even if they have good hummus, you know, these guys didn&#39;t even put steak on their salad for for so long. Shows you how dumb they are. Like everyone loves steak and you know they fought it and they put these shitty meatballs and this falafel crap that no one likes. Put steak on the salad. Everyone will buy it. They figured that out. Now make the steak a little bit better and you can have a possible run. I mean Chipotle figured that out. They got a new chicken and new steak every single every single uh quarter. Um maybe they will figure it out. So they got some cash, no debt, just leases. Income&#39;s climbing. All right. You&#39;re paying a little too much, but again, if you&#39;re okay with it having before it triples, I think it&#39;s okay. I kind of like it to be honest with you. It&#39;s not something I would ever do with uh I mean, you could I wouldn&#39;t punt in my PA with this. I would never put it in a client account at this valuation, but at $40, $50, I&#39;d take a hard look. I do like the product. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s going to be Chipotle. I think it&#39;s going to become maybe a third at Chipotle, maybe a 3040 billion company. Um, so if I could get it down another, you know, 40% at some point, that would be pretty exciting to me. I&#39;m not sure that that&#39;s going to happen, but uh I&#39;m okay with it, David. Just know that I I&#39;m not I have no confidence that it&#39;s going to rebound from these levels, and it very well may, but um you&#39;re paying up for a lot of the future today. What&#39;s appealing about FMC versus others in the space? Um, yeah, I don&#39;t like we we&#39;ve covered all the others in the space. So, let&#39;s just do FMC because I&#39;m not going to do a 10-year analysis on on this stuff for you. Um, you got to do your own work on it. So, number one, it&#39;s down 2/3. I like that. Okay. Number two, it&#39;s been around for it&#39;s been public for uh 40 years. It&#39;s gone through many cyclical draw downs of more than 50% over and over and over. It shows me it&#39;s a pretty durable business. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening now. Cash flow has recovered. The share price has not. Revenues have not recovered off the peak. Uh that&#39;s reflected in stock price. Margins have not recovered. But all of these are in a depression. all the a stocks. So, this is one that&#39;s just been around a long time. Just look at Mosaic for a second. By the way, what kind of cash it is generating? It has the runway with the cash flow. How&#39;s the balance sheet on this one? I think you&#39;re going to be really good when this sector turns owning FMC at these levels. um balance sheet 57 million they have a lot of debt. So that&#39;s that&#39;s the problem. That&#39;s why people are worried about it. That&#39;s why it&#39;s down 2/3. But they&#39;ve had a lot of debt for a long time. And when this cycle turns, the operating leverage is huge. Uh they&#39;re generating a half over $600 million of free cash. So that services an awful lot of debt. Even in a trough, they&#39;re generating that much cash. So what are they generating in a peak? 700. They&#39;re almost back to peak. 720 million of free cash flow. Um this is a high quality business. High return on invested capital. Balance sheet. We went into Let&#39;s see. Share account. I just like this one. Uh, normalized share counts going down. All the right things. Mosaic just looks like a show. It&#39;s back to the same levels it was 30 years ago. It&#39;s that&#39;s a trading stock. That&#39;s not a buy and hold. I think you buy FMC, not only do you recover to all-time highs, 127, but you wind up at, you know, 250 before the end of the next cycle. I mean, because it&#39;s a durable business, provides crop protection solutions to farmers in Latin America, North America, Europe. develop sales and markets crop protection chemicals including incesticides, herbicides, budget sides as well as biologicals, crop nutrition, seed treatment products, you know, all that beautiful stuff that uh RFK loves. Uh let&#39;s see. Mosaic crop nutrients phosphate potach mosaic fertilizers. I think if you want to play I mean it&#39;s not apples to oranges but I&#39;d play SMG Miracle Grow if you want fert fertilizer. [Music] Um, all right. There you go. We&#39;ll see. Longtime listener. Thanks for all you do. Stronger agreement. Healthcare is undervalued. Increasing my exposure over the last year. Have positions in XBI and BBC, which is a clinical trials ETF. Opt into securities lending at my brokerage. All right. So he&#39;s talking about this high borrow rate which is going to create the first buyers. The first buyers are short coverers. Uh why so much short interest short covering rally? Yeah, I think you answered your own question. I mean it&#39;s just that&#39;s what&#39;s to short right now and that&#39;ll that&#39;ll change when it changes and when it changes it will be violent and quick. Caleb Lusby a lot of you guys overthink stuff too by the way. Iceman, thank you for the amazing podcast and content. Watching on YouTube really drives home your data points. I&#39;m looking at Viaat at my airline. We use many of their products. I don&#39;t know. I think this business could wind up being all in um VSAT. I mean, to go on pay first class and not get internet connection because of VSAT is is a disaster. I think it&#39;s all going to be uh Musk&#39;s thing. Let&#39;s take a look at it. I think this has been a dog forever via SAT if I&#39;m not mistaken. Yeah, this thing looks like it&#39;s dead. I think it&#39;s all going to be um whatever Elon Mus thing is called. Starlink. All right. Still negative free cash flow. Revenues are growing. I mean, it&#39;s always been negative cash flow. Like, what is wrong with this business? Got a ton of cash. 7 billion of debt, two billion of cash. They&#39;ve always been a destroyer of capital. Must have made an acquisition. They had a big jump in revenues. They doubled their share account in the last six years. No. Scumbags. Not interested. I don&#39;t care if this thing bounces back up to 40. These guys are low lives. Not interested. All right, moving along. Marco Satc, thanks for all the great content and insights. You&#39;re welcome. Started looking at Smith and Wesson. Uh, yeah, these all look cheap. They always look cheap and they never work. Oh, this one looks like it&#39;s doing okay. Let&#39;s see. SWBI. So, it&#39;s negative free cash flow. Let&#39;s look on a quarterly basis. No, it&#39;s still negative free cash flow. Let&#39;s look at um revenues are down 50%. I I don&#39;t like this thing. No, not for me. On to the next. Some things shouldn&#39;t be public companies. That should be a private business and they just pay dividends to the owners. Ryman Healthcare, New Zealand, R YM H. Your gross margins are terrible. So, you got to you got to see that. recovery start to happen and how is it going to happen. These guys are also increasing the share count by more than I&#39;m comfortable with. Wait a second. Says you have positive free cash flow here. Why is it not showing that? You got $1 and a half billion dollars of debt and 35 million of cash. That&#39;s no bueno. Uh I&#39;m going to say pass. Double check those numbers. They might be wrong, but um I&#39;m going to pass on that one. Eric Klein cron growth cheap great balance sheet thoughts. Is this a pot stock? C R O N H Yeah, you need safe banking. I mean I actually went cash flow positive last year. $858 million of cash, no debt, income statement. I can only imagine how many shares they&#39;ve issued. Well, they&#39;ve doubled them in 2018, but uh they&#39;ve only grown modestly since. Didn&#39;t they get into the beverage business? Cannabis company. So, it&#39;s trading according to this and I have to double check this. It&#39;s trading at a discount to the cash on its balance sheet. This reminds me of I was in Puerto Rico at a family office conference and this guy sat down and like pitched me on Rick&#39;s cabaret for like an hour and going through all this return on capital. all this the guy read a book about Warren Buffett and he knows how to like steward capital and I said yeah except for the fact that no institutional manager can ever own the goddamn stock therefore you&#39;re never going to get any real sponsorship or have any liquidity if you need to get out in size. So, if you own 10,000 shares and you&#39;re PA, who cares? That doesn&#39;t, you know, that&#39;s not Let me just see Rick&#39;s. Where&#39;s Rick&#39;s? RCI Hospitality. They changed the name thinking institutions will know. So, yeah, it&#39;s still down at $40 a year ago. Um, I mean, I think you got to understand if safe banking is coming. Uh you got to double check these numbers to see if that&#39;s true that they&#39;ve got you&#39;re basically buying I mean if they own if they&#39;ve got $858 million worth of cash and the thing is trading at 758 million 746 million And you in theory have growing revenues. then it&#39;s probably worth doing some work on pre-rolls, oils, vaporizers, edibles, chemist, spinach, Lord Jones, Peace Natural brand names. I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t get excited about it, but I think you got enough margin of safety in it that if they get it right and the phase comes back, you could have a beast of a move, but this is kind of a gambling stock. But with the downside somewhat covered, unless they start burning cash again, then you&#39;re screwed. So, um, so that&#39;s that. With that said, we&#39;ll be back next week, same time, same place. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
