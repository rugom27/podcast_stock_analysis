# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode Various
### 2024-01-26

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on value stocks, small caps, and international equities, particularly China. He believes the market is mispricing these assets due to recency bias and that a rotation is imminent. He is lightening up on the Magnificent 7, anticipating decelerating growth and multiple compression. He highlights specific opportunities in Advanced Auto Parts, Cooper Standard, Comstock Resources, VF Corp, and Estee Lauder. He sees a Trump presidency as a catalyst for these trends, anticipating lower taxes, deregulation, and increased infrastructure spending.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish on value, small caps, and international; cautious on Mag 7 → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Value is the cheapest relative to growth since 1980 and 2000, both generational buy opportunities.
- Small caps offer the same earnings growth as the Mag 7 but at half the multiple.
- International equities are poised to outperform as the dollar weakens and global growth accelerates.
- Trump's policies will favor value sectors like industrials, materials, and energy.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is poised for a rotation from growth to value, large caps to small caps, and US to international equities. This rotation will be driven by decelerating earnings growth in the Mag 7, rising interest rates, and a shift in investor sentiment towards undervalued assets. A Trump presidency will accelerate these trends through lower taxes, deregulation, and increased infrastructure spending.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Value vs. Growth | Cheapest since 1980 | A generational buying opportunity for value stocks. |
| Small Cap Earnings Growth | 21% expected growth | Same growth as Mag 7 but at half the multiple. |
| International Earnings Growth | 13-14% expected growth | Higher growth than US at a lower multiple. |
| 10-Year Yield | Expecting closer to 4% than 5% | Bonds will get bid, yields will compress after inauguration. |
