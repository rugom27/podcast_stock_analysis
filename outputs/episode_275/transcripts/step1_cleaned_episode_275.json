  "cleaned_transcript": "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe're going to get right down to it uh we usually do family photos first but these are my friends that are like family who came out to visit us in California stayed with us for a couple days last week uh this is Robert and his lovely wife Desiree who by the way has been in the running for our club champion ship multiple years uh back in Connecticut uh but we we got to play the club out here in Orange County and that was absolutely incredible thanks for so so much for coming out to Rob and Desiree and we also had the privilege the next day to play Big Canyon in Newport Beach which was unbelievable thanks for setting that up uh and Jason for hosting us and then uh there&#39;s a picture of me it was actually cold that day this week it&#39;s been quite warm my game is coming coming back which is pretty awesome the markets close at 1:00 on Pacific Time now the flip side is I&#39;m up at 4:30 every morning which I don&#39;t mind today I was up at 1:30 because I miscalculated uh what time CNBC Indonesia was and it dawned on me that the the time spread might be different last night at 900 p.m. rather than waking up at 4:00 a.m. I had to wake up at 1:00 a.m. but uh uh you know world&#39;s smallest violin let&#39;s get down to the media I want to thank The Amazing Taylor rigs Jake Max Stu oppenheim millanie kapadia obviously Liz Clayman for having me on the Clayman countdown and Katherine Meyers so here I am with Taylor Smith excuse me Taylor Swift Taylor rigs uh been a long day The Amazing Taylor rigs love going on with her uh we talked two weeks ago and a followup on the conversation we had there how it&#39;s all coming into play here we go got it um all right moments ago we heard president Trump talking about interest rates in the Oval Office after he signed an executive order on crypto This Is Us the first fed meeting of the year it kicks off on Tuesday joining us now great Hill Capitol chairman Tom Hayes to count us down to the closing bell Tom we love having you um what do you make of some of the interest rate conversations that we&#39;ve been having particularly as we gear up for the big fed well you you heard Donald Trump this morning from Davos and thanks for having me Taylor uh saying he wants lower interest rates he wants that debt free financing we know the debt uh interest payments have gone from under a half a trillion to now going to be more than a trillion so he&#39;s going to continue to put pressure he&#39;s going to continue to cut costs with the Doge program so that the market has confidence we&#39;re being fiscally responsible and the market will take care of interest rates over time so I love filling in for Liz Clayman because you are my repeat guest the last time I was on with you you talked about right the last in is now going to be the first out right when you think about the performers in this market are you starting to see that play out yeah there&#39;s no question and I enjoyed being on with you a couple weeks ago I said the last shall be first and what are we seeing today we&#39;re seeing materials we&#39;re seeing health care we&#39;re seeing Industrials start to outperform and the reason is simple business friendly friendly environment cut taxes uh great environment for these type of businesses moving forward and price is what you pay value is what you get so we came into the year with the mag 7 having decelerating earnings growth uh uh for a high multiple decelerating to 21% earnings growth for 33 times versus the rest of the market at a much lower multiple and money is finding its way into the Great Value there I know but so we only have 30 seconds left I&#39;m looking at Boeing on your list it takes a lot of crossing your fingers to bet on Boeing right now or you&#39;re happy well the big thing is with turnarounds the key is solvency risk and Kelly ortberg took care of that by raising $20 billion of cash they still have a duopoly they still have a half a trillion dollar backlog so we like Boeing we like that story and Trump has said he wants the rest of the world spending massively on defense spending Boeing is going to be a beneficiary we like that story continuing Thomas Hayes thank you so much penny for your thoughts as well so let&#39;s take a look at this we&#39;re firmly in record territory the S&P and we&#39;re back uh on to the next this was a special segment I I did uh on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange when I was in town with Jared blicker and Sydney freed also want to thank Taylor choia Smith for putting this together this is a new uh podcast that they have which gets syndicated everywhere and this was an amazing go anywhere podcast that we covered uh China Baba everything you could possibly imagine Advanced Auto Parts turnarounds how we think about turnaround so I wanted to get this one early in the podcast this week so listen and [Music] here welcome to stocks and translation broadcasting from the New York Stock Exchange the heart of global Capital markets I&#39;m Jared blicker and at my side is the people&#39;s voice Sydney freed first please like subscribe and comment on stocks and translation on Spotify Apple music Amazon or YouTube guess what guys today we are welcoming Tom Hayes he is a chairman of great Hill Capital hello guys and today we are going to be talking about guess what we got Warren Buffett we got David teer talking about value and macro and no spoiler alert we&#39;ve got them in a finale you do not want to miss our word of the day or phrase of the day is vssd stands for volatility spreads and duration how the pros use these terms to read the bond market tea leaves and this episode is brought to you by the number 21% that is how much The Magnificent Seven profits are expected to grow this year which happens to be exactly the same for the S&P 600 that&#39;s small caps it&#39;s a 2025 Davy Goliath Market Showdown but we before we get to some of the more jargon busting uh parts of this show Tom why don&#39;t you just give us your big picture overview of where we are in the markets right now yeah I think uh for 2025 we can expect a good good year however not quite as good as 2024 uh we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of looking at high single digits to low double digits but I think the real story is going to be the rotation what is going to drive those gains and what is holding back bigger gains and that that has to do with rotation that we&#39;re going to talk about all right great so you are a value investor we want to start with another VW vstd which really doesn&#39;t have a lot to do with value but we&#39;re going to talk about it anyway we got volatility spread and duration so taking them one at a time volatility it measures price swings and then spreads that shows the difference in in yields between two different bonds so how far apart they are and then we have duration which measures how sensitive a bond is to changes in interest rates so if the FED raises or lowers rates how does that Bond react to it and I&#39;m just wondering how you use this information to judge what&#39;s happening right now because we&#39;ve seen huge rises in the tenure t-note yield which has been pressuring R risk markets you know it&#39;s interesting uh what we&#39;re seeing in the last few weeks is exactly what we saw after Trump 1.0 after the election before the inauguration and what what basically happened in 2016 he ran on being tariff man and the king of debt so what did the markets do as soon as he was elected dollar rallied yields blew out uh emerging markets and international stocks sold off and then after the inauguration what&#39;s surprising to most people that they forget is that bonds actually rallied yields compressed the dollar came down and and international stocks did exceptionally well China had one of its best years ever in 200 17 after the inauguration so I think there&#39;s a lot of bark to the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI&#39;m looking at Boeing on your list it takes a lot of crossing your fingers to bet on Boeing right now or you&#39;re happy well

ever in 200 17 after the inauguration so I think there&#39;s a lot of bark to the headlines  but but more modest bite because that bark is used as negotiation tactic and I think we&#39;re going to see uh a period in 2025 that&#39;s similar to 2017 in that how people are positioned today before the inauguration uh is probably a little bit off sides to how the year is going to go and H you want to go ahead how do you how do you see this playing out though so you&#39;re a value investor tell us like how you see this playing out sector-wise or style-wise yeah I think in terms of sectors uh what drove the boat late last year was The Magnificent 7 and what you saw with the Magnificent 7 was they had meaningful earnings growth 33% earnings growth last year uh that is actually decelerating in 2025 it&#39;s crazy to thing but it&#39;s decelerating down to 211% but the difference is the multiple has remained elevated so the multiple has has not been derated with the earnings growth uh conversely you look at something like small caps had anemic earnings growth the small cap 600 which is the more profitable index uh is going to grow from 8% earnings growth to 21% earnings growth but rather than paying 33 times you&#39;re paying 16 times so I think you&#39;re going to find the real opportunity in the unmagnify in international in small caps and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to see more subdued index returns uh of 8 to 12% because uh mag 7 is such a heavy weight and if they don&#39;t outperform the indices aren&#39;t going to go very far so what are some of your investment ideas that aren&#39;t mag s that are more 593 sorry 4993 I gave more uh Wells you want to do some audit uh Auto stocks you you ready to go to sleep now these These are exciting stocks uh I&#39;ve got one on the retail side and one on the wholesale side so the one on the retail side is called Advan Auto Parts uh this stock is down 80% and why because it was manag they overexpanded everyone knows Advance Auto you know they see it in their local area if they don&#39;t see O&#39;Reilly if they don&#39;t see auto can hear the I can hear the jingle yes yeah exactly so uh effectively Shane o Kelly came in he ran HD Supply for Home Depot a$7 billion business Harvard MBA West Point serious guy came in about a year ago to turn the thing around after they destroyed it uh what he did immediately was he took solvency risk off the table how did he do that he sold the Canada business raised one .5 billion of cash the westpack business paid down debt and now he&#39;s closing the unprofitable non-performing stores on the west coast and part of the reason they&#39;re not performing is because they are spread out so you don&#39;t get economies a scale with the distribution hubs so he&#39;s shutting that down that&#39;s 10% of stores uh he is expanding stores in the in the markets on in the Northeast and on the East Coast where he&#39;s number one and two consolidating the distribution centers here&#39;s all you need to know his Target for 2027 is $630 million in operating income they&#39;ve done that four times before uh 2018 2019 and two other years every single time that they hit that marker the stock traded between $180 and $220 a share it&#39;s a $45 stock right now you can&#39;t give it away maybe three times appreciation I love that you have specific investment picks like this how do you go about stock picking because you&#39;ve been on our err many times screener yeah and and you you always have like an interesting ideas and specific ideas how does an average person get specific ideas as opposed to just investing in ETFs yeah I think uh one it comes from experience two I&#39;ll give you the advice that Warren Buffett gives everyone which is read the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and once you can understand that the price that you see on your screen can sometimes deviate and sometimes deviate materially from the underlying fundamentals of the business that&#39;s when you that you read that book and one of two things is going to happen one it puts you to sleep find another career there are many ways to make money many paths to the top of the mountain number two the light bulb goes off and it changes your life that&#39;s what happened to me and every day like Buffett talks about I skip to work because it&#39;s like a treasure hunt uh

light bulb goes off and it changes your life that&#39;s what happened to me and every day like Buffett talks about I skip to work because it&#39;s like a treasure hunt uh there is  nowhere else in the world other than public markets where the price can get so dislocated from the underlying value either due to force selling structural selling over emotion you know for some of the prices that I pay for business it&#39;s like if I went into Advanced Auto Parts board today and I said I&#39;ll take out the entire company JP Morgan&#39;s going to finance me on the debt side I&#39;ll put up some of the equity I&#39;ll raise some Equity we&#39;ll buy the entire company at $45 a share I can guarantee you they would call security and have me escorted out of the building because they think I&#39;m absolutely Al Looney to never in a million years would they sell their business at $45 a share so um so those are the opportunities and that&#39;s actually one of my filters is would the board have me ask Ed out if I offer to buy the entire business at the price that was quoted in the market and uh and if the and if the answer is no they would take the meeting then that&#39;s probably not the stock for me Tom speaking of value here value um has actually been the dominant probably Factor if you want to call that in the market going back a hundred years but not this Century it&#39;s really only come in a few places comeing to vogan a few places and we&#39;ve I&#39;ve sat with a lot of guests and they&#39;ve said that low perpetually low interest rates that we&#39;ve seen this Century kind of killed off the macro trade that you know you&#39;re used to these boom bus Cycles but it&#39;s changed the game it did change the game so much and only now are we normalizing so is this\n\nhere is nowhere else in the world other than public markets where the price can get so dislocated from the underlying value either due to force selling structural selling over emotion you know for some of the prices that I pay for business it&#39;s like if I went into Advanced Auto Parts board today and I said I&#39;ll take out the entire company JP Morgan&#39;s going to finance me on the debt side I&#39;ll put up some of the equity I&#39;ll raise some Equity we&#39;ll buy the entire company at $45 a share I can guarantee you sounds wonderful they would call security and have me escorted out of the building because they think I&#39;m absolutely Al Looney to never in a million years would they sell their business at $45 a share so um so those are the opportunities and that&#39;s actually one of my filters is would the board have me ask Ed out if I offer to buy the entire business at the price that was quoted in the market and uh and if the and if the answer is no they would take the

and only now are we normalizing so is this\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthe time for Value yeah we we ring the bell on this show uh look value is the cheapest relative to growth since 1980 number one since 200000 number two both of those years were generational buy opportunities to buy if you remember the covers in 1999 2000 Warren Buffett has lost his touch that was the headlin except he was using that opportunity while everyone was buying Cisco and Global Crossing and Enron he was buying value stocks and he had dramatically outperformed 2,000 2001 2002 2003 2004 20056 you get the point and if you look back through history we get blinded as investors by recency bias and recency bias tells you since 2010 growth has kicked Val&#39;s butt okay and there&#39;s no two ways about it since 1927 value has outperformed growth not by a little by 45% per year every single year including the last 15 years not compounding that&#39;s it yeah yes if you believe we&#39;re normalizing interest rates and you don&#39;t have exposure to the 493 or or some level of value I think you&#39;re going to find yourself left in your dust I&#39;m not saying shift your portfolio overnight and go all value because we don&#39;t know no one can predict the future but what I am saying is if you can buy a high quality business at a reasonable price right now you want to start to do that in a normalizing environment and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing would you would you do that with an ETF like buy V or some value ETF or are you stock picking are you do you really need to find the winners and avoid the losers there yeah I think I think you run into if you wind up in a basket you know there&#39;s the term value traps so the turnarounds I look for it&#39;s not just like it&#39;s cheap because you can get stuck in cheap for long time I&#39;m looking for catalysts of change in many cases it&#39;s the new CEO okay so for instance we were just joking you like Vans I have three we have we have three pairs of the same see now that&#39;s not going to happen I had to endure this conversation already so so look let me tell you about vans so Vans I went on uh a network last year the stock was trading at 13 or $14 down from $83 and the host looked at me like I had two heads I said look I&#39;m betting on Brack and Daryl this guy was at Logitech back in 2013 when the stock was down 82% okay here&#39;s what happened over the next decade if you invested it was less than a decade if you invested $1 million when Bracken took the Helm of Logitech you made $26 million 26 bagger talk about turn around and this is not you know they weren&#39;t curing cancer these are commoditized camera and mice and keyboards which you could get anywhere else but somehow this guy figured out how to Brand Logitech to The Gamers and the game was on he&#39;s doing the exact same thing and not only does VF Corp own Vans which has struggled by the way it peaked during covid everyone bought Vans for three years ago they&#39;ve got three three there&#39;s there&#39;s a surfing Vibe early on in the pandemic didn&#39;t pan out exactly didn&#39;t didn&#39;t pan out so they&#39;ve worked through that so now they they&#39;ve gone through the dstock cycle they&#39;re going to the restock cycle but by the way they own Northface which did just did a collaboration with Kim Kardashian on skims they sold out within a matter of days the young kids are wearing the new school where the where the wave thing pops out from the side side of the thing so he&#39;s changing the game they&#39;re they&#39;re selling out you couldn&#39;t even get them in Christmas because they were selling out then he owns North he owns North Face he owns uh Timberland Dickies so he&#39;s got a portfolio he sold off Supreme to do what same thing that you saw with Shane o Kelly take solvency risk off the table that is number one in a turnaround story sold Supreme for $1.5 billion dollars paid down the debt now they&#39;ve got the runway to turnaround Vans uh uh Northface is doing great as Asia comes back it&#39;ll do even better Timberland Dickies you name it you got it I mean Bracken is a winner and he&#39;s gonna he&#39;s going to turn this thing around so the stock is now up from 1314 to 2122 down from 80 I think this can double again over the next couple of years hold that thought we need to take a short break but coming up we&#39;ve got a DAV and Goliath showdown between the mag seven and small caps then another Showdown on the runway featuring two iconic hedge fund Le Legends it is Buffett versus teer coming up all right we are back and this episode is brought to you by the number 21% that is the expected growth in earnings per share or profits of the mag 7 this year and it&#39;s also the expected EPS growth for the S&P 600 which covers small caps the key difference is what we call the multiple or how much you need to multiply the stock price to get to that number so the multiple on the mag 7 is 33 the multiple on the S&P 600 that small cap index is half of that basically 16 tell us about how you use this information yeah this is huge so when I&#39;m allocating this year I want to find special and unique situations in small cap why because I get the same growth for half the multiple price is what you pay value is what you get and the second Auto stock that I wanted to talk about is a small cap in particular it&#39;s called Cooper standard this stock is down not 80% this stock is down 90% okay same thing that happened they took solvency risk off the table they refinanced the debt all this is is a play on increasing volumes and if you remember from December volumes came in it surprised everyone 16.8 million annualized what you&#39;ve seen over the last 45 years is North American sell through sa uh it it it Peaks and troughs between 15.3 million to 17.1 the last time you had a peak was 2017 at 177.1 this company earned $7 a share and traded at $146 we started buying it at five and change it&#39;s now up to 13 and change um we believe that the next time we hit 17 million in volumes they&#39;re not only going to earn $7 they&#39;re going to earn $10 a share because they&#39;ve taken $400 million a cost out so these are the special unique situations in small caps where you can get involved uh you can take a risk you&#39;re not going to put your whole portfolio in a small cap stock you want to be careful and you you want to have a a portfolio 10 15 20 stocks you know the less confidence you have the more Diversified you need to be um the more you know buff buffet and Monger used to always say uh divers diversification is a hedge against not knowing what you&#39;re doing or some would call that inconfidence but yeah bigger picture do you have like a percentage breakdown you recommend for growth and value and large cap and small cap for people to be invested in yeah that&#39;s you know that&#39;s going to depend on their unique goals uh that&#39;s something that they definitely want to talk to a financial adviser because at different ages you want to have different levels of risk I deal exclusively with family offices and ultra high net worth accredited and qualified investors so um so that&#39;s really going to depend where you&#39;re at I think for a lot of people what makes sense is to passively index the bulk of their money and then if they have a small bucket where they want to start to learn and start to experience and start to experiment they&#39;re doing it with a very small and as they grow confidence and grow experience and grow knowledge then they can expand that bucket over time we but we&#39;ve had a number of people guess on this show that have told Sid and looked Us in the eye and said well you&#39;re young well they looked Sid in the eye not me said you&#39;re young uh you don&#39;t need the you don&#39;t need the rest of the S&P 500 you just need the NASDAQ you need some of the growth year stocks you don&#39;t need bonds what would you say to that yeah they said that in late 90s also I mean look I don&#39;t think this is the late 990s I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect a tech rack I do expect consolidation of some of these gains and some reating of the multiples um you know Sydney probably has to speak to her financial advisor about that uh I thought you were advising me right now but if you if you were my sister I&#39;d put you in a good good a few good companies and then I&#39;d probably have you indexing the rest so you slept well at night and you were comfortable with that uh and then over time you you could build up as the profits and as your account grew and uh as you got more comfortable with with that what about small caps though are those for and as the the group would you trade the Russell or the S&P 600 or you&#39;re just looking for individual yeah I mean we only you know we run a very concentrated book of 8 to 12 stocks uh is our portfolio different ball game for you different ball game uh I would say though that um I would start to ease into an uh a small cap index do it small if you&#39;re like 90% in like a 6040 portfolio maybe you maybe you put 5 10% into small caps and start to lean in that way the other thing you can do some people index with uh the S&P 500 there&#39;s a Vanguard ETF vti which is a more is a broader number of companies that you&#39;ll catch some of the small caps in that it&#39;s another way to index but with more exposure less concentration to the mag 7 that&#39;s another thing to think about as well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new S&P 500 ETF that will not weight any stock more than 3% so it&#39;s not quite equal weight it&#39;s not just all kinds of interesting products coming out like that uh if you don&#39;t have anything I I have one thing about diversification I&#39;ve asked but if you&#39;re if you have a long rway is there something valid to just like putting a little bit of money in every S&P sector is that is that this is a recurring thought like how can I get it all catch them all because people say diversification I&#39;m like what does that really mean like stocks bonds sure but like a little bit of money sounds like a good excuse for not knowing what you&#39;re talking exactly well I think um you&#39;re getting that effectively through the S&P 500 so if you you know if you if you look at uh the spider sector ETFs and then you look at the Holdings of each of them you&#39;re going to see like the top 10 Holdings are S&P component so effectively by doing that what that would change is your weighting so if you went equal weight by sector but that means you&#39;re going to have equal weight materials against equal weight uh Tech which by the way is not a horrible idea for 2025 I&#39;ll tell you why yes please do uh the two worst performing among the worst performing sectors were Healthcare and materials had low singled digigit returns in 2025 relative to the S&P over 20 20% here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen in 2025 they have among the highest expected earnings growth Healthcare is going to grow earnings 20.4% which is more than the S&P 500 of 13 14% And materials is going to grow earnings 17.4% so as a catch-up trade that becomes very very interesting I have a materials name if you&#39;re interested but otherwise we might get to that in a second here first we got to get to today&#39;s who wore it better we have two iconic investing investing Legends marching down the red carpet it is on one side the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett himself squaring off against the ma master of macro David teer Buffett the steadfast value investor who build his Empire on patience discipline and the occasional cigar butt strategy he is the epitome of Jesse livermore&#39;s buy it right and sit tight strategy on the other side you&#39;ve got teer a guy who just doesn&#39;t play the markets he moves them with just a few words on financial TV he stared down the global financial crisis and famously said load up the truck so in this battle of investing icons who wears the market better is it Buffett&#39;s Timeless value Playbook that shines in high rate environments or teers all weather Global macro tool kit ready to pounce on any opportunity here all right long-term Buffet hands down near-term Tepper I&#39;ll tell you why teer sure this is people are going to tune out when I say this uh I hope not it&#39;s certainly going to be controversial so keer went on TV a few months ago talking about China and and people vomited all over their desks once they heard that okay his number one position is Alibaba right now look I&#39;ve been wrong about Alibaba for over a year we just keep buying it and buying it and buying it because price is what you pay value is what you get it&#39;s the lowest amount of price for the greatest amount of value right now in the international market so if you think that there&#39;s more bark to Trump than bite and he wants to do a deal with China like we saw after the election in 2000 after the inauguration in 2017 when Alibaba went from $85 not coincidentally where it is right now to $187 in 11 months you might want to take a look at that there&#39;s something that has been happening in China for the last year year and a half is that they&#39;ve been doing this peac mail stimulus over and over and over and over very peacemeal but it&#39;s all building up and when it happens it&#39;s going to be uh very quickly and Alibaba is the tollkeeper it&#39;s the Tollgate for the middle class when they start spending they get a piece of all the action they&#39;ve got uh of all the AI startups if you want to play a China AI ETF it&#39;s called Alibaba why because every single a they are a seed fund every single AI startup goes to Alibaba and says we need Cloud we need uh AI tools we need all of this stuff and they say it&#39;s free just give us Equity we we&#39;ve got Equity as owners of Alibaba in pretty much every AI startup in China this is huge and and it&#39;s has zero value oh by the way they generate $25 billion of free cash flow every year oh by the way they&#39;re sitting on $ 55 billion of cash not a bad runway for a turnaround situation uh they can also lock up jackma at any time so t\n\nere all right long-term Buffet hands down near-term Tepper I&#39;ll tell you why teer sure this is people are going to tune out when I say this uh I hope not it&#39;s certainly going to be controversial so keer went on TV a few months ago talking about China

oh by the way they&#39;re sitting on $ 55 billion of cash not a bad runway for a turnaround situation uh they can also lock up jackma at any time so t\nhere is  risk there yeah well good news is he&#39;s out of the picture so lock lock him away uh I would say that um if China turns this thing is going it and I wouldn&#39;t even say if because this is actually what it looks like I know I don&#39;t have a lot of gray hairs but I but I&#39;ve been around and Jared knows I&#39;ve seen these cycles and and the last time China was this despondent was uh that would it happens every few years 2016 okay uh then you had 2009 then you had 2 2001 as the as the money moved out of US tech it moved into China Tech so look it&#39;s not a popular one it&#39;s why we own more than one stock okay you you can&#39;t be certain about anything but when it moves it&#39;s not going to be a little move it&#39;s going to be a big move and it&#39;s not going to let anyone in and I just don&#39;t know when that is I think it&#39;s imminent teer thinks it&#39;s imminent but no one knows Tom we&#39;re racing to the finish here what is your number one investment tip for 2025 I think that what you want to do is lighten up a little bit on mag 7 if you&#39;re overweight and if you&#39;re in indices whether you like it or not you&#39;re overweight some 40% index waiting uh is the mag 7 I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s trading at a little premium you know I joke Jensen Wong may be flying a little bit too close to the Sun like Icarus the good news is his wings haven&#39;t started to melt yet but

required by their investors to get a return on investment so they either lower the spend and risk seeding market share to their competition or they get more compute power per dollar of spend competition catches up and it&#39;s a race to the bottom for margins and this time will be no different well the selloff in January continue well after the inauguration we&#39;ll find out with Thomas Hayes managing member of great Hill Capital he also break down his sector allocation preferences and uh value versus growth an interesting theme for 2025 Thomas welcome back to the show happy new year thanks for having me David let&#39;s take a look at my screen right now this is the S&amp;P 500 ever since uh basically the uh top in December it&#39;s down roughly um 5% or so is this just a seasonal pullback that we&#39;re seeing or is uncertainty around the Trump Administration starting to pile up here yeah I think uh it&#39;s not dissimilar to the volatility we saw after the election in 2016 Trump 1.0 through the inauguration 2017 and then things kind of normalized I think what&#39;s got people sideways is yields blowing out 10-year yield accelerating first you had uh the FED uncertainty in December and then you had that super strong jobs report which uh worried the market that maybe we&#39;re not going to get the two cuts that the FED projected in their uh SCP and instead uh now we&#39;re at only 70% of one cut by October and the market is adjusting to that and and if you look at the general indices uh it&#39;s almost misleading you know you had Industrials small caps down almost 10% it was pretty violent interruption in December you you had seen a trend of regular broadening healthy broadening since July of last year and then uh as we got through the election and into that fed issue in December uh really an Abrupt pause in that in that broadening theme and I I do think we&#39;re going to resume that for a number of reasons we can cover today the 10e yield is that a signal of strength in the economy or expectations for further strength in the economy or simply that the inflation expectations are being pushed out higher uh which may or may not be good for equities it depends who you talk to I mean you know if you look at the University of Michigan uh uh inflation expectations jumped up a little bit uh last week both on the one-year and threeyear uh expectation to 3.3% that is embedded in the consumers expectation of tariffs increasing prices now you have seen the administration leak a couple of things number one maybe it&#39;ll be targeted to certain industries or subsets and number two it might be gradual we&#39;ve been of the camp it won&#39;t be as bad as advertised I think the advertisement was 60% tariffs across the board uh I think that&#39;s going to be more more modest and more reasonable like we saw in Trump 1.0 uh then on the flip side you do have uh the fact that the economy is growing you know you&#39;re you&#39;re gonna have mid teens earnings growth so uh there&#39;s a view that yields are expanding due to that and then there&#39;s a third Viewpoint that you got to issue9 trillion of debt to refinance in 2025 so that uh yields are blowing out in excess but what I will say is I&#39;m more of the camp that this is exactly what happened between the election and the inauguration in 2016 to 2017 Trump ran as the king of debt uh the king of the Tariff King uh he&#39;s run on the exact same platform in uh 2024 and the market is trying to digest to what extent will he be the king of these two initiatives uh and uh we&#39;re taking the under the market right now is taking the over I think the market is overestimating because as you saw in 2016 to 2007 17 while the dollar rallied after the November election and bonds yields uh really accelerated after the election after the inauguration bonds got bid yields compressed for the next year plus the dollar rolled over International stocks took off biotech stocks took off oil stocks collapsed uh so it was the exact opposite of what everyone was expecting and we think it could be some version of that rhyming not repeating yes and as a hedge fund manager are you positioned for more of a pullback right now or is it still risk on for you generally speaking uh we run a concentrated Equity portfolio that has a very low correlation to the S&amp;P 500 weights so the businesses we buy we we enter we do a lot of turnarounds and we&#39;re buying at a point in time where we feel the margin of safety is Extreme meaning that if the business was liquidated tomorrow we would make a profit if the turnaround plan plays we make a double or triple over a few years and and in some cases multibagger uh so we&#39;re less concerned with what the Market&#39;s doing on a day-to-day basis if the market pulled back 20% % uh in the next couple months it wouldn&#39;t change one view on any of the eight or 12 core positions in the portfolio uh and uh and and very likely if the indices pulled back which we don&#39;t anticipate anything of that magnitude but if they pulled back materially what that would tell me more likely is that the rotation that we&#39;ve been talking about is playing out because the indices pulling back is is evidence of the mag 7 predominantly getting hit because of the weights in the index and uh and and we&#39;re going to make our money in the 493 and international prospectively which would be less impacted by the overall uh Market liquidation Thomas you talked about some sectors uh that surprised uh some investors were would surprise some investors during a trump 2.0 so let&#39;s talk about um some of these so we actually discuss this in detail when Trump won the election link down below Thomas was on one of my first guests after uh November 7th um in particular energy is interesting um the oil price right now is moving up a lot higher now some of it had to do with um sanctions on Russia but perhaps expectations are that uh Trump is actually going to follow through on some of his promises what what do you think is going on in the energy sector right now yeah we have exposure to the energy sector to a company called Comstock resources uh Jerry Jones who owns the Cowboys owns about 66% of the stock at around $710 our basis is about a buck higher it&#39;s now trading around 20 we believe uh the intrinsic value of it both proved uh reserves pv10 that they have to report to the S&amp;P 500 around 20 30 bucks uh per share and then unproved we think is another $20 so we we don&#39;t really worry about the day-to-day vacillations in natural gas or in um or in in oil prices I would say that sentiment got so pessimistic on oil uh and oil stocks in December that uh it it was clear that we would get some some level of Bounce the problem with the integrated and even some of the servicers is that when we get involved in a in a business we we are looking for a meaningful irr over a few years 30% plus and I just didn&#39;t find the risk reward despite low quote unquote pees uh and high dividends and buying back shares Etc I just didn&#39;t find the asymmetry in the uh General oil and gas space that I did during 2020 when we were buying it hand over fist when oil turned negative uh that&#39;s when I like to get involved so for now our exposure is limited if you put a gun to my head and said how are you going to take advantage of the increased Drilling and the and the uh energy favorable policies from the Trump Administration I&#39;d be inclined to being servicers potentially like a Slumber J or something like that we have no position there but if we do expand our energy exposure Beyond Comstock that is where we would be looking and it would not surprise us at all if we see some follow through both in the sector because that&#39;s a component of value which we think is going to have a better year than than it did last year uh and um uh and some of the initiatives as far as the consolidation in the industry deals happening in the industry Etc it&#39;s just we&#39;re we&#39;re not getting enough juice for squeeze so we&#39;re looking elsewhere where we can get a lot of juice and uh how are you eyeing the tech sector now that Trump has probably signaled a doubling down of tariffs in the trade War globally is a tech sector at risk from tariffs and just more protectionism overall I think that as we look at the mag 7 which is an overweight in the indices so you are over dramatically overweight Tech if you own the S&amp;P 500 passively uh and atically overweight if if you&#39;re chasing the nvidias and uh and and the Googles and Etc the thing that our view is the the outperformance of the mag 7 last year was somewhat justified by the earnings power of the mag 7 last year so it&#39;s okay to have a 33 times multiple when you have 33% earnings growth the the problem going into this year is that earnings growth is going to decelerate for the mag 7 from 33% down to it was 21% as of a few days ago now I&#39;ve seen numbers down to 18% so your your earnings growth is going to almost have but the multiple is still at 33 time so that the multiple is still high it has not yet derated so that&#39;s not where I want to be where I want to be is w\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe have exposure to the energy sector to a company

has not yet derated so that&#39;s not where I want to be where I want to be is w\n\nthe earnings growth accelerating and the multiple has not rated to the upside one of those areas for sure is small caps uh you&#39;re going to see in the small cap 600 index earnings growth uh grow from 8% to 21% but you&#39;re only paying 16 times so half the multiple as the mag 7 for the same or slightly more earnings growth if you look at the Russell 2000 which has more non-profitable companies turning profitable that earnings growth I&#39;ve seen uh some estimates to be 50% this year so I think that&#39;s an area the other theme that we&#39;re looking at here David is the last shall be first right along the theme of the earnings growth relative to Value two of the worst performing sectors last year because they had among the worst performing earnings growth were health care and materials this year that is going to flip on its head because the healthc care is expected to grow earnings 20.4% which is meaningfully more than the S&amp;P at you know 14 15% and material is going to grow earnings at 17.4% so we like opportunities in those two beaten down sectors as well speaking of valuations here&#39;s a note from uh Goldman Sachs uh their strateg just put out a note on Monday um is reported by CNBC US stocks are expensive but uh GS says investors should keep buying them the US Stock Market is trading at eye watering valuation says his article after two straight big gear for the S&amp;P 500 but that&#39;s not good enough a good enough reason to back away from domestic companies uh the 2025 outlook for the unit be leased on Monday included a model portfolio for mod risk investors that recommended staying overweight us equities while trimming exposure to foreign stocks is that uh something that a view that you share okay so Goldman&#39;s 2024 Outlook was the most pessimistic on the street their Target price for end of year was 5,400 um you know the S&amp;P wound up well over 6,000 and at one point in the year was at 6,300 uh so they got it wrong they were the most wrong on the street now prospectively when value stocks speaking of prices what you pay value is what you get uh International uh is going to have 13 14% earnings growth that&#39;s xus uh compared to the us about 14% earnings growth the difference is US you&#39;re paying 22 times uh International you&#39;re paying 15 to 15 and a half times I think uh now more than ever just like the first year 2017 when Trump was elected when everyone thought you had to be all us International and Emerging Markets actually outperformed after the dollar rolled over after the inauguration so I would take the exact opposite of this note from Goldman Sachs this year just as taking the exact opposite of their note last year was the right call as well and it does and it does beg the question as to where Capital flows will head now that the bank of Japan in particular um is on a path of potentially raising rates while everybody else is cutting rates if not pausing yeah you by the way this is the most important thing to be watching in 2025 we got a preview of coming attractions in early August as the bank of Japan is forced to continue to raise rates and the Japanese Bond Yi jgb yields blow out uh what you&#39;re going to see is an unwind of the carry trade and the carry trade that free money trade that has been concentrated in quote unquote us except exceptionalism but predominantly mag 7 stocks is going to abruptly unwind because as that liquidity dries up it&#39;s coming out of where it&#39;s been placed and that has been in the mag 7 they&#39;ve not been buying you know small cap autoart wholesalers they&#39;ve not been buying uh Stanley Black and&amp; Decker tool makers uh they&#39;ve not been buying Baxter International medical device companies they&#39;ve been buying uh in via they&#39;ve been buying palent here they&#39;ve been buying all of those things which I think are are going to take a breather and by the way I&#39;m not saying short Tech this is 2,000 at all I&#39;m saying that they there&#39;s going to be a rting in multiples which will cause the performance of that basket to do less well than it did last year I.E low single to high single digits whereas uh bigger money can be made in in value uh across the board and and we can talk a little bit about the history of value versus growth and why growth uh people seem focused on due to recency buys if if you&#39;d like to to move move there well wait a minute is Apple still a growth stock didto Microsoft and well look I mean the the story with Apple has been multiple expansion right so historically it had traded at a 14 times multiple on 78% earnings growth or actually higher earnings growth back then and then it decelerated earnings growth to low to mid single digits which is where it is now and the multiple expanded into the 20s so uh you tell me whether that makes sense now the Bulls argument would be that uh Services Revenue increase and services profitability increased therefore it&#39;s it&#39;s uh deserving of such a higher multiple but at the end of the day if you have decelerating earnings growth an accelerating multiple expansion it&#39;s a formula for uh not bu you know not great things happening moving forward so I I would just say that uh we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have a view that the multiple has to go back to 14 times by any stretch of the imagination but we do have a view that some of the gains that have been fostered through multiple expansion versus earnings growth expansion should consolidate the gains for some time to digest the price growth relative to fundamental business growth that has occurred in the last two years okay so the main drivers of uh Tech earnings then going forward in 2025 in particular uh do you think it&#39;s still coming from AI do you think that that theme has sailed what&#39;s your take The Narrative of AI and the expectation of AI transforming lives is correct just like The Narrative of Amazon on changing the world in 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 was correct the problem was in that first part of the ShakeOut even though everyone was right about the story in 2000 it took 10 to 15 years to deliver the result I.E I press a button on my phone and you know here in California in sometimes the same day it shows up at my my front steps sometimes it takes a whole day to do it so all of that stuff happened the problem was you were paying as if it already happened in 2000 when it would take 15 more years to deliver which is why you saw in 2000 to 2002 the greatest company in the world Amazon down 90% in price despite the fundamentals of the business continuing to improve in each of those years 2000 2001 2002 2003 while the price was crashing the fundamentals were improving because you had simply paid too much for what was to come 10 to 15 years later as if it had already come 15 years earlier yeah so then bottom line sector over sorry please so so as it relates to AI um you know I made a joke Jensen Wong is is flying the good news is the bad news is Jensen Wong is flying too close to the Sun the good news is his wings aren&#39;t melting yet I mean you have a company that is trading at uh uh you know 30 30 times sales 40 50 times earnings and if you look at capex spand from from the mag 7 it&#39;s going to decelerate this year as it relates to AI because investors are demanding a you know they made record capb backs in 2024 on AI chips Jensen Wong was the beneficiary but now uh there&#39;s something called return on invested Capital that investors demand in order to allocate capital and it&#39;s eroding their return on invested uh return on invested capital or return on Equity depending which metric you like to look at because they&#39;re not getting the revenues commensurate with the spend uh in the near term so they have to temper that that&#39;s number one number two once you have all these large language models trained and and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s done as we move to the inference part once the language models are are trained the inference requires less Hardware because it&#39;s less demanding it just starts to make use of the large language models and the demand for the chips goes down so I do you think you&#39;re going to see a reating of some of these arms dealers in the AI race and and the and the third thing I would say about Nvidia is is like uh it&#39;s worked well because he&#39;s had no competition but like every semiconductor cycle and and you know a lot of people that are betting on Nvidia weren&#39;t even through puberty the last time this happened uh and they don&#39;t have any point of reference but competition is coming okay they&#39;re not curing cancer over at Nvidia that I can assure you and the chips will be replicated or even substandard versions that people can buy at quantity at price will start to replace particularly again as we move from large language models to the inference phase of the cycle uh and the purchasers of these technologies will be required by their investors to get return on investment so they either lower the spend and risk seeding market share to their competition or they get more compute power per dollar of spend through cheaper competitive chips and what we find as we find every single semiconductor cycle is that chips are a commodity and sooner or later competition catches up and it&#39;s a raise to the bottom for margins and this time will be no different\n\n beneficiary but now uh there's something called return on invested Capital that investors demand in order to allocate capital and it's eroding their return on invested uh return on invested capital or return on Equity depending which metric you like to look at because they're not getting the revenues commensurate with the spend uh in the near term so they have to temper that that's number one number two once you have all these large language models trained and and I'm not saying that's done as we move to the inference part once the language models are are trained the inference requires less Hardware

chips are a commodity and sooner or later competition catches up and it's a raise to the bottom for margins and this time will be no different two\n\nquestions on that um first good point on competition so uh competition from w\n\nhere is  going to be competition why hasn&#39;t it already happened is probably the question on the street Intel I know they got rid of their CEO they&#39;re searching for a new one um AMD hasn&#39;t caught up uh Taiwan semi I don&#39;t know what&#39;s your take well Taiwan Taiwan is in the best position they&#39;re in the the uh the be the thing is if if Taiwan can this is the thing that people forget if Taiwan semiconductor ceases to exist\n\nhere is going to be competition why hasn't it already happened is probably the question on the street Intel I know they got rid of their CEO they're searching for a new one um AMD hasn't caught up uh Taiwan semi I don't know what's your take well Taiwan Taiwan is in the best position they're in the the uh the be the thing is if if Taiwan can this is the thing that people forget if Taiwan semiconductor ceases to exist t\n\nno Nvidia so Nvidia can design chips but if they can&#39;t produce them they they have no business so as much as there&#39;s pessimism around the intels of the world which you know if they if they just liquidated the thing now investors would get their money back plus a few dollars um the US has invested eight billion dollars of real cash and then billions of subsidies and everything else so whether they stand up the Fab or not or or put it into a separate entity first thing they got to do is announce a new CEO I think when all is said and done what you&#39;ll find is that everything Pat gelsinger said was going to happen he had basically gotten he got into the 10 yard line and they and they they they took the ball away before he could cross the finish line he did the four nodes in five years he&#39;s uh he look he burned a lot of cash so he had to go the board got board so the name of the game is they need to hire someone and announce someone who&#39;s credible and then just finish Ginger&#39;s plan because everything&#39;s in place and if they can get the Fab business going either in the current entity or in a separate entity and they can uh catch up I think that one&#39;s got an interesting possibility relative to margin of safety of if you&#39;re conservative and you don&#39;t believe in their future as a Fab uh it&#39;s probably a double just on the Legacy business and if if they get the right CEO and if you do believe in gelsinger&#39;s full plan then this thing could be a multibagger but leaving that aside the amds will catch up uh the Marvel&#39;s the broad there there&#39;s a lot of people gunning for a piece of the Jensen Wong pie and like every cycle you can be assured that they will get some of it not all of it but they will get enough of it that um you&#39;ll see margin compression and you&#39;ll see a normalization of multiples last question on uh Ai and Nvidia this came in this week Nvidia stock Falls after Biden Administration releases updated export rules for AI chips so the Stock&#39;s been down about 12 133% since it&#39;s to in uh uh late December but uh anyway this came out it fell nearly 2% on Monday after the Biden Administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence chips to adversaries such as China the White House said that the rule will cap the number of AI chips called gpus that can be ordered by most countries without a special license smaller orders of 1,700 or fewer gpus would not count toward the export cap um is this significant for the industry at all or um or not so much I mean you expect this to be reversed uh it&#39;s significant for the industry but not for the reasons that you think number one in the short term it will hurt hurt the industry a little bit in the intermediate term to long term it will it will destroy the industry because what you basically did in the name of National Security is you&#39;ve taken uh a uh eager paying customer to us companies and said you can no longer buy from us so you&#39;ve given them no choice but to learn how to create that competency for themselves and how do they do that it&#39;s very simple they pick off the best talent uh they reverse engineer the technology and they do it themselves whereas if the government did not impose these restrictions they would stay dependent on us uh forever uh so effectively in the short term it looks like a win because they don&#39;t have the same technology in the intermediate term after they ship the the chips through other countries and ultimately get them and reverse engineer them and they front-loaded a bunch before of this anyway to buy them a few years to reverse engineer the technology and hire out all the best talent um uh the the big issue is maybe the competition that I&#39;m talking about is not coming from the the players that were anticipating and it&#39;s coming from players that are just now getting um uh going and from from China\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ngreat thank you very much uh close off let&#39;s close off on your sector overweights and underweights for 2025 suing everything together yeah I think uh three themes here first values outperform growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 so we want to be skewed toward adding value this year and the and the recency bias around value in the last since 2010 has been zero interest rate policy if you believe we&#39;re going back to to zero interest rate policy then stay overweight growth if you believe we&#39;re in a normalized environment which we do start adding some value uh into the portfolio the second theme is uh small over large you get the same or better earnings growth for half the multiple this year it worked in Trump 1.0 and the third theme is start to get some International exposure because like value and growth that runs in Cycles uh International and US runs in cycles and when you see a headline uh us exceptionalism the note that you referenced uh it&#39;s often time to start to get some Expos internationally again you know 13 14% earnings growth for 30% less multiple International is the thing as far as domestic last shall be First Health Care and um health care for sure and materials are ways to get value for massive earnings growth acceleration in 2025 uh and I think the one of the surprises of 2025 is that following the inauguration into the first quarter I think you&#39;re going to see bonds start to get bid 10 yields start to get bid yields compress uh and I I think that the uh the pounding the table around 5% is going to be more like 4% would be my bet as we move throughout the year uh I I take the under I&#39;d see the 10year yield closer to 4% then closer to 5% uh towards the end of the year for sure interesting\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nexclusive Thomas J&#39;s chairman and managing members great Hill Capital cnia America how are you Thomas it&#39;s been a while I&#39;m doing great thanks for having me Saina thank you for joining us in CNBC Indonesia just barely three days ago Donald Trump has been inaugurated as the 47 presidents of the United States of America so what is your outlook for the US economy yeah I think we&#39;re going to see a very positive high growth economy like we saw in the first few years of his first term uh certainly positive impact on the economy positive impact on the stock market and it&#39;s really going to be driven by tax cuts lower taxes lower regulation more business-friendly environment and I think the other aspect of what we&#39;re going to see safrina is a more broadening in the participation like we saw in the first term uh people at the lower level of the income strata are going to do a lot better just like they did in 2017 2018 2019 we&#39;re also going to see a lot more sector participation us markets have been pretty concentrated in Tech participation magnificent 7 I think we&#39;re going to start to see a lot more companies in Industrials manufacturing banking energy uh start to participate small caps Etc so a lot of broadening and uh and good performance in stock outside of the Magnificent 7 moving forward and also the labor force Market as you mention yes yeah there&#39;s no question about it uh they going to be uh better wages there going to be more jobs there&#39;s going to be a lot more investment in the US a lot more manufacturing you know manufacturing has been in a recession or even a a slump for two straight years I think you&#39;re going to see some policies and some investment that&#39;s going to make manufacturing boom again that&#39;s going to create a lot of high paying jobs and beside the manufacturing Industries in the United States what do you believe will be his key priorities to strengthen your domestic economy Thomas yeah I think there there are a few Sao number one is going to Unleash the Beast of US Energy we have unlimited beautiful natural resources\n\nmoving forward and also the labor force Market as you mention yes yeah there's no question about it uh they going to be uh better wages there going to be more jobs there's going to be a lot more investment in the US a lot more manufacturing you know manufacturing has been in a recession or even a a slump for two straight years I think you're going to see some policies and some investment that's going to make manufacturing boom again that's going to create a lot of high paying jobs and beside the manufacturing Industries in the United States what do you believe will be his key priorities to strengthen your domestic economy Thomas yeah I think there there are a few Sao number one is going to Unleash the Beast of US Energy we have unlimited beautiful natural resources uh drill baby drill he's going to open up leases on federal lands for drilling uh reduce regulations on offshore drilling so we're going to have an unlimited abundance of cheap uh energy to fuel industry you saw the Stargate investment project yesterday $500 billion that's going to require a tremendous amount of energy all types of energy certainly natural gas uh certainly oil certainly some nuclear is going to be in the picture certainly Renewables we're going to need that the other thing you're going to see is lower taxes for individuals lower taxes for corporations which is going to foster a lot of investment and high high nominal growth high high GDP growth uh the other thing you're going to see is a business-friendly environment that's going to attract a lot of foreign investment you saw Moshi Sun uh and others uh uh committing $500 billion doll to Stargate AI infrastructure investment and just today uh MBS from Saudi Arabia said we we would invest they would invest up to 600 100 billion dollar in the United States so a lot of people want to do business with Trump and America and then finally  is peace through strength getting us out of Wars uh creating a peaceful geopolitical environment through a strong National Defense and spending on defense so uh those are kind of the core tenants of things we're going to see that are going to lead to growth and stability under the Trump Administration right I would like to hear more and I want you to elaborate more about his inauguration speech essential topics with the popular catch price drill baby drill what do we need to anticipate from that as from the Emerging Markets point of view well I think that t\n\nis peace through strength getting us out of Wars uh creating a peaceful geopolitical environment through a strong National Defense and spending on defense so uh those are kind of the core tenants of things we&#39;re going to see that are going to lead to growth and stability under the Trump Administration right I would like to hear more and I want you to elaborate more about his inauguration speech essential topics with the popular catch price drill baby drill what do we need to anticipate from that as from the Emerging Markets point of view well I think that t\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  a perception that uh Trump is going to want to do trade Wars and tariff and Emerging Markets will do poorly and I think what we saw in the first Administration first Trump Administration was exactly the opposite so the the two things that people expected in Trump 1.0 when he ran as the Tariff King was that the US dollar was going to be very strong and emerging Mar market equities would be very weak after the inauguration in 2017 the exact opposite happened so right after he was elected the dollar rallied and emerging market stocks went down down uh right after he was inaugurated in 200 January 2017 you saw the dollar back off uh started to weaken in that first year you saw emerging markets and China stocks start to do exceptionally well in those first two years of the 2017 Administration so I think there&#39;s going to be a difference between what people expect I.E International emerging will do less well and what actually happens I think I think the whole world is going to do well and I think emerging market stocks are going to Boom uh I think that uh Commodities are going to do well and I think it&#39;s going to be fueled by a lot of investment a lot of growth lot of optimism and good policy uh win-win policy globally right right thank you um now moving on to the digital assets how do you anticipate the Trump administration&#39;s approach towards the the Bitcoin the digital assets the cryptocurrencies will there be significant new regulation in this particular sector I think it&#39;s going to be nuanced certainly it&#39;s going to be more crypto friendly he ran on that to uh really attract a lot of people who own crypto assets to vote for him uh and I think he&#39;ll follow through on what he promised so there will be a focus on Innovation there will be a focus on deregulation you see uh Scott bessent his treasury secretary has spoken positively about crypto Howard L lutnick his Commerce Secretary uh owns Bitcoin has invested in crypto companies vocal supporter of Bitcoin and then the SEC chairman Paul Atkins is ex expected to take a a softer approach to crypto regulation uh I would keep in mind though uh that further adoption and further rules are also going to Foster more competition more issuance so uh it&#39;s started out straight away with uh the Trump token and the Melania token so you know all these folks that are in uh Bitcoin and uh salana and other instruments may start to see a lot more competition for those crypto dollars because I think there&#39;s going to be a lot more issuance of different tokens and different crypto opportunities so it potentially could have an effect that people are not focused on which is delution you know people say well coin Bitcoin is the best thing ever because it&#39;s scarce uh but if the regulation becomes more friendly you could have a lot more tokens and crypto Investments that may in fact dilute the couple that currently have uh a duop on the crypto investment funds right Thomas and this is Trum 2.0 as we mentioned here and given the history of the previous trade War do you think we will foree the possibility of a trade War 2.0 between the US and China under this Trump&#39;s leadership I think that uh first and foremost I think that&#39;s a headline that&#39;s unfair I think what Trump wants to do is threaten big okay and then negotiate a favorable win-win deal okay and if you look at the big focused has been on China uh you know China is a small portion of our global trade it&#39;s about $600 billion of call it 5 trillion uh he came out of the gate and he said 60% Trump&#39;s tariffs on China day one well now we&#39;re talking about 10% tariffs on China and it wasn&#39;t on day one it&#39;s going to be pushed off till February so I think uh you know as it relates to China his number one thing is stop get stop allowing this fent andol to go through our borders it&#39;s hurting a lot of our people so he&#39;s going to use the tariffs to get the Chinese to cooperate on those issues that are very very important to the US uh there probably will be some level of tariffs but it will be a lot lower than advertised and then once that framework and agreement is in place I think it will Foster a lot more business between the two countries versus the previous administration that you know consistently said you know China was wrong and and never got to the table to do a good deal but how do you particular see the relations between Donald Trump and cim Bank I think they&#39;re actually a lot better than is advertised uh on the\n\nregulation becomes more friendly you could have a lot more tokens and crypto Investments that may in fact dilute the couple that currently have uh a duop on the crypto investment funds right Thomas and this is Trum 2.0 as we mentioned here and given the history of the previous trade War do you think we will foree the possibility of a trade War 2.0 between the US and China under this Trump&#39;s leadership I think that uh first and foremost I think that&#39;s a headline that&#39;s unfair I think what Trump wants to do is threaten big okay and then negotiate a favorable win-win deal okay and if you look at the big focused has been on China uh you know China is a small portion of our global trade it&#39;s about $600 billion of call it 5 trillion uh he came out of the gate and he said 60% Trump&#39;s

good deal but how do you particular see the relations between Donald Trump and cim Bank I think they&#39;re actually a lot better than is advertised uh on the\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nheadlines  I think they&#39;re already communicating it&#39;s been announced that they&#39;re communicating I think there&#39;s a level of mutual respect uh which and and um uh a willingness to talk and a willingness to come to a table look Donald Trump is an America first president he wants to do what&#39;s in the best interest of America but he understands in business in order to get what he wants he has to have a deal that makes sense for the other party he&#39;s been doing this for his entire career business career going over 60 years at this point and he will come to a favorable deal and I think we&#39;ll have very positive relations uh with China and with our other trade Partners after a little bit of volatility to come to good terms and that&#39;s the way negotiation works you ask for everything and then you come to a good winwin uh solution now for the geopolitical situations um given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza uh do you think the US under the administrations of Donald Trump should play a more active role in providing or seeking a r solution what do you think is Donald Trump&#39;s going to do well I think if if past this any prologue in Trump 1.0 we saw record World Peace uh it was really the situation so I do think he&#39;ll be involved I do you think that will be resolved much more quickly than it possibly could have under the previous bureaucrats an Administration I think that uh I think that leaders around the world respect and and respect Trump and and know he means business when when he says to come to the table and he&#39;s going to do a deal something&#39;s going to get done so I do see a situation where geopolitical issues are going to be much more muted we&#39;re going to get rid of all these multi-front wars uh we&#39;re going to come to some negotiated resolutions through Trump peace through strength and it will be good for the world and we can focus on business and Global Prosperity right wonderful insights always from you Thomas thank you so much for joining us in CNBC Indonesia take care thanks Saina appreciate it and I want to thank uh fitria angran and safrina nushan for having me on that one uh and then uh couple nights ago I was on cgtn America with Sean calebs also uh want to thank camia kilan for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here welcome back everyone he was chosen by Trump to in part cut government costs but it appears he has been cut Vivic ramaswami announced his departure from the Department of government efficiency or Doge to possibly run for governor of the state of Ohio however various source-based report say ramas Swami was Iced Out by Elon Musk ramas Swami was tapped by Trump alongside musk to streamline federal spending now with his exit musk is now fully in charge and leads the push to cut government waste some say ramas Swami&#39;s departure is reminiscent of the many leadership changes seen during Trump&#39;s first term in office so what exactly will Elon Musk do key initiatives include modernizing outdated systems as well as implementing cost-saving work force reductions drawing from his corporate experience musk aims to overhaul inefficient Federal process with a tech driven approach however these plans have sparked legal challenges and also raised concern about potential impacts on essential government services let&#39;s take a closer look at that and for that we&#39;re joined by Thomas Hayes founder and chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure welcome good to see you good to see you Sean okay so what do we know about Doge it seems like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a moving Target day two in office and we&#39;re back to this kind of chaos uh that seems to follow the the current president Elon Musk firmly entrenched but as we heard Vivic ramas Swami out and Trump saying Doge will be entrenched in the executive branch not an outside committee I know just threw a lot at you but how important is this going to be to the US economy and what Ripple effects do you expect to see through the markets well I think this is a big deal Sean because as you know the interest expense has ballooned in the last few years nearly doubling from uh under half a trillion to now over a trillion dollars a year due to interest rate increases and spending uh you know 120% debt to GDP so it&#39;s absolutely essential that not only does this uh initiative work uh but more importantly that it is perceived to be working because I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get $2 trillion of cuts and I think Elon Musk has intimated as much by saying well two trillion would be nice 1 billion is one trillion is more realistic I think if they got a half a trillion it would be huge to get out of this type of mess historically the number one thing you need is massive growth and I think this White House is keenly focused on massive growth through deregulation and through tax cuts and through other growth initiatives but we do need a perception of getting that spending under control and that&#39;s what doge is all about yeah this perception is important and look this isn&#39;t the first time a US president has vowed to cut the fat in federal government and Trump in his first term added more money to the federal deficit any president so tell me why this time things are going to be different well I think that there&#39;s no choice okay in order to uh get the interest rates under control he wants to bring interest rates down you can only control that through the FED which is an independent body uh and the long end of the curve is really going to tell you whether the market believes they are getting the spending under control but you know there are some sensible ideas that are coming out as a as a function of this dialogue plug which is you know consolidating a lot of these redundant government agencies or making them more uh efficient uh even you&#39;ve you&#39;ve heard the idea of reducing the number of them from 400 down to 100 which would be a tall order uh probably a wish list uh more than a reality but if we move in this direction it&#39;s going to send the right message to the market more people will want to buy our debt we can refinance at lower rates while we wait for growth to uh pick up a bit growth been good it could get better Thomas you make some great points and uh that t\n\n historically the number one thing you need is massive growth and I think this White House is keenly focused on massive growth through deregulation and through tax cuts and through other growth initiatives but we do need a perception of getting that spending under control and that&#39;s what doge is all about yeah this perception is important and look this isn&#39;t the first time a US president has vowed to cut the fat in federal government and Trump in his first term added more money to the federal deficit any president so tell me why this time things are going to be different well I think that there&#39;s no choice okay in order to uh get the interest rates under control he wants to bring interest rates down you can only control that through the FED which is an independent body uh and the long end of the curve is really going to tell you whether the market believes they are getting the spending under control but you know there are some sensible ideas that are coming out as a as a function of this dialogue plug which is you know consolidating a lot of these redundant government agencies or making them more uh efficient uh even you&#39;ve you&#39;ve heard the idea of reducing the number of them from 400 down to 100 which would be a tall order uh probably a wish list uh more than a reality but if we move in this direction it&#39;s going to send the right message to the market more people will want to buy our debt we can refinance at lower rates while we wait for growth to uh pick up a bit growth been good it could get better Thomas you make some great points and uh that t### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  a a need to do this to kind of streamline government so what role will Doge play uh if you will in cryptocurrency regulation and I ask this because the president the first lady have launched their own crypto so the fact that he has that and a billionaire is overseeing overall of this does it kind of smack of trouble down the road yeah the crypto thing is pretty gray at this moment because he did appoint David Sachs as the crypto Zar originally and then David had a lot of ties in Silicon Valley that did you know enabled him to be more of an advisor than take a major role uh in the administration so there&#39;s some ambiguity about crypto as far as Doge related to crypto crypto seems to be a separate initiative that that will be under the crypto are that will be under other purviews besides Doge doge is predominantly focused uh on reducing the cost okay so cuts on from Doge and more efficient Workforce so if you&#39;re a federal worker right now in any agency and there are a lot of them out there are you nervous are you anxious are you antsy and what are the markets looking for yeah I I do think you are I think the first thing that they did was do the executive order that you must come back to work in the office 5 days a week that will probably D Trim 5 to 10% of the workforce without them having to do much just to start with because not all people can work from the office uh 5 days a week that have family and other commitments so that will help uh we&#39;ve seen uh hopes or wish lists or assertions from the people uh involved or around Doge that they could cut 75% of government employees that is uh a tall order that is unlikely to be anywhere near met I would be a little concerned if you&#39;re not in an indispensable position I do think there&#39;s going to be consolidation of agencies I do think there&#39;s going to be a reduction of the workforce all the work is going to be done in person and as they bring in software and more efficient processes to the federal government uh that will reduce a lot of make work so I I would expect to see I&#39;m not uh thinking anywhere near 75% reduction but 10 to 20% is realistic okay uh you only have 30 seconds now Trump has had some major fallouts with people he&#39;s been close to to what happens if Trump and musk Collide and this friendship crashes and burns well I think it&#39;s a symbiotic relationship because musk uh certainly needs the administration for some of his initiatives with regard to uh SpaceX and uh uh automated driving and uh other other projects that musk is involved in and Trump needs the expertise you know the one thing that about Trump is he is very attentive to people who have uh areas of specific expertise and in many cases are uh wealthy or wealthier than he is he loves to listen to their viewpoints because he takes them very very seriously I think that adds a lot from elon&#39;s uh credibility as it relates to Tech as it relates to some of the initiatives where uh Donald Trump doesn&#39;t H quite have the background as a real estate developer and businessman he&#39;s not so focused on on some of the things that are happening in the economy now and that&#39;s where Elon can provide a tremendous amount of value for Trump for the administration for the country so right now it&#39;s really too symbiotic to have a Fallout unless we saw an instance where uh the spotlight started to get excessively stolen which uh I it gets crowded there really quickly exactly so so that&#39;s a risk but I I think it&#39;s less of a risk than people are making it out to be at the moment because they both meet each other okay we&#39;ll see Thomas always a pleasure my friend thank you so much thanks Sean okay we&#39;re gonna take a and we&#39;re back and there was one more here and\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally  today uh CNA which is like the BBC of Singapore and all of Asia huge station want to thank Audrey Tay and Sarah Al khi for having me on to talk more Trump and other implications listen in here Traders anticipating a new era of lower interest rates and cheaper oil helped push Wall Street to record highs overnight the S&P 500 hit an alltime inaday high above the 6,100 Milestone following comments from US president Donald Trump at the world economic Forum he said he would demand an immediate drop in borrowing costs the Dow and the NASDAQ both ended in the positive for a fourth straight session energy stocks tempered some of those gains with the S&P 500 energy sector on track for its worst weekly performance since late December Mr Trump also told Davos business Elites he plans to ask Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to dampen inflation his speech comes just before the fed&#39;s meeting next week where they are largely expected to keep interest rates unchanged there have been concerns that potential sweeping tariffs by the Trump Administration could add to inflationary pressures and slow the fed&#39;s policy easing path for more of the markets we have Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital thanks for your time Tomas so gains for Wall Street but it&#39;s really been concentrated in a very narrow part of the market despite expectations of growth under the Trump Administration so do you think it&#39;s time to move on to other previously unloved parts of the market or is it time to bet on these tried and tested names because of the uncertainty that we might see well Sarah I think what you saw today and thank you for having me by the way was a continuation of a trend that started last July which was the broadening of the market the what I call the unmagnify everything other than the Magnificent 7 and the S&P 500 really started to outperform up until December and right after the election and with some fed uncertainty in December uh mag mag 7 came back abruptly in De but now we&#39;re seeing a resumption of the trend the last shall be first those sectors that underperformed last year are beginning to outperform and you saw it healthc care was up today Industrials were up today materials were up and guess what was down magnificent 7 and that&#39;s the type of economy that we had under Trump 1.0 was a broad participation of regular everyday businesses starting to flourish from deregulation from lower taxes from lower energy more abundant energy and less regulations yeah speaking of energy we&#39;ve heard his comments about how he plans to to lower oil prices which could counter the inflationary effects of tariffs producers though of energy they won&#39;t be happy with that plan how realistic and how effective do you think the this these measures will be well I think he is going to be able to lower it short term I and I think the producers will be okay with it because the demand for energy is going to go up so dramatically with all the demand from AI from from the uh AI investment and data centers and the required energy we&#39;re going to need all the energy that we can possibly get whether it&#39;s natural gas whether it&#39;s oil whether it&#39;s coal whether it&#39;s nuclear whether it&#39;s Renewables uh everything is going to be part of that P in addition to lower energy cost to reduce inflation uh t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nthat&#39;s the type of economy that we had under Trump 1.0 was a broad

cost to reduce inflation uh there is  expectation that the department of government efficiency Doge will maybe not get to trillion of cuts maybe not even get $1 trillion of cuts but if they start to move towards a half of a trillion dollar of cuts it&#39;s going to signal to the market that this Administration is serious about fiscal responsibility and as a result of those actions what you are going to see is the market is going to bring interest rates down versus Trump simply demanding that interest rates go down\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand when they go they go uh whe it&#39;s the latest ones you know VF Corp is almost is is knocking on the door for a double Comstock is knocking on the door probably be a triple pretty soon uh and that&#39;s just the beginning there&#39;s so much awesome stuff happening uh got to take the long-term view uh Europe wasn&#39;t always such a bargain so it talks about the valuation Gap wide and that closing we&#39;ll talk a little bit about that this week here&#39;s a dollar CH chart people crowded in the most that they&#39;ve been this crowded into Long Dollar uh since you rubber banded back every other time in history let&#39;s get through these charts quickly because we got so much going on this week uh small caps bounced off this uh this trend line uh this is an interesting chart uh before 1992 the average recession was 19 months now it&#39;s eight months so that&#39;s something interesting to show uh going back to 1945 something to keep in mind maybe the FED is more active than they had been uh Price is Right fed&#39;s 50 basis point cut uh this shows 10year yield rolling average annualized returns and you can see when it gets this beaten down you get a move in TLT so I think someone asked on Twitter today do you still think yields are going down 100% uh it&#39;s not going to be because Trump demands that they go down but that this certainly won&#39;t hurt what it&#39;s going to be is Doge starts cutting the market starts to perceive all the things that we discussed on the interviews you can see here sentiment is at the right levels not levels you want to be a seller which we&#39;ve been talking about and we&#39;ve seen now that follow through um uh Commodities long-term return starting to pick up here we&#39;re seeing in natural gas and others small cap stocks need to stay above the 2021 highs uh they&#39;re they&#39;re going to do that I think that&#39;s going to be the big story here we&#39;re already starting to see today was a great example upturn now but flipflops Galore so this is talking about the phase one recoveries that we&#39;ve talked here&#39;s where we are where value small size starts to outperform coming after the uh high quality large size which we saw last year and this is just a normal regular regime you got to know what phase you&#39;re in and take advantage this is uh indicative of that going back to 2021 dividend yield inexpensive versus history we&#39;ve been talking about that for 6 months that is now playing out neglected by managers value versus growth best generational opportunity since uh 2001 and before that 1980 uh history doesn&#39;t rhyme repeat but it does rhyme and that&#39;s what&#39;s happening growth versus value at xco highs well above the uh Tech highs we&#39;ve covered all that and why it&#39;s based in fundamentals is not just looking at charts and saying it has to mean in revert why does it have to mean revert and you can look at the data and the earning earnings deceleration versus acceleration and the policies on the table like we covered with uh um Sarah on CNA so I just like to show this stuff value outperform growth after the last fed cut we&#39;re going to see more of that China City&#39;s home price tracker ticking higher and I&#39;m moving fast because we just got like so many\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmarket starts to perceive all the things that we discussed on the

consecutive days with more than 70% of stocks advancing so you see that coming out of big troughs that&#39;s good news uh and what happens uh one year later on average up 10.63% so breath is improving we uh don&#39;t need to over hit that also uh S&P 500 after not touching 200 day moving average ### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfor a certain period this is all the fun Strat stuff which is great and bespoke a year later you&#39;re up 13.4 which is in line with what we&#39;re thinking for the indices 8 to 12 and for under the surface fortunes are going to be made they won&#39;t move the needle on the indices because the weights are low right now those weights will go up just like what happened with energy in 2020 when we were pounding the hell with uh uh xon at $33 and said you know oil was negative we&#39;re saying buy the hell out of everything in oil and then after they all doubled and tripled everyone got interested in oil we were laying off uh and they did nothing for two years so uh housing affordability this has to change it&#39;s going to change Trump&#39;s going to find a way to deregulate build like crazy smaller Footprints more houses bring down the cost much more

much bigger headwind in 2025 so I think that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to see some guidance issues you had a strong Dollar in Q4 that&#39;s going to weaken but that&#39;s going to make guidance more conservative which is typical in the first quarter of every year guidance gets super conservative they&#39;ll use the FX as an excuse and then the dollar will weaken and they&#39;ll say oh what

we&#39;ve been in a manufacturing depression like 2007 to 2009 like 2000 to 2002 and then what happened straight up value small caps Industrials all the things that make the world go around super excited beige book activity ticking up China GDP you know 5.4 crushed estimates no one&#39;s talking about it they will they were all worried about that Trump and X had a beautiful call uh Trump said he was 60% day one now it&#39;s maybe 10% maybe do a phone call maybe that China helps with Russia and gets off the hook completely maybe they do a Tik Tock deal and maybe no one has any idea what&#39;s about to come except for the folks on this podcast um industrial production going up in China not down retail sales going up not down new home prices are starting to recover existing home prices starting to recover after four years uh China new home prices stabilized with stimulus push stimulus that&#39;s all pigging the python it&#39;s starting to come out it&#39;s going to come out all at once it&#39;s built up pushing the beach ball underwater when it comes out it comes out it hot and it comes out aggressive and you won&#39;t be able to catch it and um and that&#39;s going to be super duper fun because we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to make up on on one position you know two three years of irr in probably 6 n months and exceed our our IR hurdle that we internally uh uh commit to uh for what we do in terms of internal expectations and then set exp external expectations much lower so pretty excited about that Global LNG shortfalls are forecast until 2027 com stock baby you rocking and rolling I remember we couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t give it away at 8 now at 25 everyone&#39;s interested sending me all these natural gas articles and everything else it&#39;s

control with his executive orders pales in comparison to FDR Herbert Hoover Warren Harding uh it&#39;s Etc uh interest rates since 3 3000 BC we see these spikes everyone keeps looking at recency bias thinking it&#39;s going to be like 1980 it&#39;s just the opposite these are regular things that you see over the last few th thousand years they Spike up they come back down they Spike up mostly a downtrend with the exception of 1980 and that&#39;s why everyone&#39;s got their thinking backwards on this and um you know even uh in different periods so that&#39;s that top 10 companies percent of S&P market cap look this is this is crazy town ladies and gentlemen so you can you can chase these but eventually you&#39;re going to get hurt maybe it&#39;s two years from now you know there&#39;s a saying the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent that really only applies to people who use a ton of Leverage and are day trading you know people and get get you know sell the bottom buy the tops and get you know just whip sought around if you know what you own and you&#39;re pay paying a good price price is what you pay value is what you get you you don&#39;t worry about the short-term fluctuations you&#39;re not getting margin called cuz you&#39;re on very low to no leverage and you just ride it through until you get your doubles triples quadruples and then you lay it off to all the people that are excited about it that were selling to you in the hole when no one was excited about it and you rinse and repeat and you do it over and over this is not rocket science it just takes ice in your veins and for most people they say I you know I have you know uh regular temperature water in my veins I&#39;m going to lay it off to the guy with ice in his veins so I don&#39;t have to think about it and I can go be brilliant at my business that makes all the money and lay off the cash for someone else to manage so I don&#39;t have to think about it and uh and and they can go to the beach and enjoy life with their family uh percent of companies outperforming the S&P 500 since 1990 so we haven&#39;t seen this level of uh companies underperform the S&P since when since the early 2000s when what happened small caps value International started to dramatically outperform uh uh here we go same thing this is the uh relative performance to US versus xus and this is at a level of you know two three standard deviations above the mean well more than the internet bubble well more than nifty50 so keep piling into those and pray for pray for the best um uh you better make sure you put a lot in the basket when you go to church CU you&#39;re going to need it uh us value versus growth relative performance so yes we see this Zer error value and outperformed growth for uh you know 78 decades and then you have a zero interest rate uh policy for a while which is over unless you believe rates are going back to zero if you&#39;re stuck in this good luck ladies and gentlemen is all I have to say uh us duties collected we&#39;ve covered this before for everyone saying tariffs are going to cause a depression we have the lowest tariffs that we&#39;ve had in hundreds of year in in over uh century and even in the Spanish Flu 19808 we started at 6% uh uh of Duties collected on total Imports we&#39;re currently at like 3% so even if we went to 6% uh um they raised tariffs from 1918 to 1930 from 6% to 20 almost 20% before the depression so everyone saying if he does tariffs we&#39;re going into a depression obviously he&#39;s never read a history book and is kind of a joke but um there are plenty of people who don&#39;t read history books that are pretty you know uh always wrong and never in doubt and unburdened by the facts of history but um Global

these stocks are not priced for that and uh we could see something like we haven't seen in since 2016 which is uh 2017 where they just go parabolic in 11 months uh Equity positioning across sectors so no one's in real estate materials and Healthcare what's been doing the best Healthcare materials which we talked about before the end of the year No One believed us that's what's happened everyone's in Tech and uh they've been basically grinding sideways since the summer if you look at it honestly they were down going into December they had a rally so it feels like everything's going up go look at it back since July when we got out of the Amazon and the Google that more than doubled uh you'll see consensus on the US dollar is bullish contrarily to bullish we agree Dollar's going down yields are going down household debt to income is relatively low in the US consumer in good shape us net interest expense we covered um was a half a trillion now it's over a trillion they got to start making some Cuts with Doge we covered that on CNA uh covered the Chinese Yuan uh S&P 500 after mlen oscillator goes from negative 120 to positive 100 in 30 days one year later up 15.6% these are all breath

job job we covered all the uh media appearances Bank of America fund manager survey top five points most bullish Catalyst for 2025 remains China growth acceleration two managers are dramatically underweight materials and energy three second largest monthly rotation into EU stocks in 25 years four rotation into healthc care and commodi started the year we talked about that before the start of the Year hope you guys were able to take advantage macro Outlook still has plenty of room to improve we agree and Estee louder so we like to cover one or two stocks we&#39;ve talked about previously and uh in many cases have built a position uh Estee louder we&#39;re seeing cash flow start to re accelerate this was a cyclical trough pretty much uh attributable to little bit of mismanagements a lot of China weakness and now that&#39;s all coming back uh their long-term thing they&#39;re going to continue to earn a return on invested Capital well above their weighted average cost of capital which is the the definition of a high quality business and you can see historically they&#39;ve been growing at you know 23 on average over 20% return on invested Capital last two years they got hit that&#39;s going to re accelerate top Line&#39;s going to continue to grow people will pay anything to look good this is the best brand uh this owns Asia and Asia is coming back uh like crazy so you should read through all of his notations here on the Morning Star commentary but when you read it you are going to be really impressed and really interested this will take a little while because it got so destroyed but you know here&#39;s a stock that&#39;s down to whatever it is 70 bucks down from 300 and uh 350 uh at $80 I mean look it could hang around between 50 and 70 for 3 years before going back to 250 who cares but I think this one&#39;s probably going to recover pretty quickly with China and I&#39;m getting a lot more confidence in China where I want to get even more direct and indirect exposure to take advantage of something that happens every you know five six years that people forget these are cyclical things um they beat earnings they improved operational efficiency gross margin improved in the most recent quarter uh they got a new CEO who knows what he&#39;s doing so all these things position it to absolutely catapult the the rebound and China is the name of the

there are there uh Building Product suppliers or Regional Home Builders set to benefit look um I want to bet on Brad Jacobs he&#39;s going to do a rollup in the space he&#39;s he&#39;s whiffed on uh beacon beacon roof and suppli so far maybe he brings the offer up he&#39;ll get some plat form company he&#39;ll get it done this is the guy I want to bet with for the next 10 years on on uh home uh Home Building Supplies so uh I&#39;m sticking with Brad even though he hasn&#39;t gotten a deal done yet uh he&#39;s probably got more urgency to get it done and capacity to get it done than I have urgency for him to get it done as we&#39;re holders of qxo so I&#39;ll leave it at that uh Goran says uh look at vi v this is probably some software thing with no moat so I&#39;m going to probably not be interested but I&#39;ll take a look yeah so it&#39;s done nothing for 22 years why would anything change let&#39;s see if he has a thesis for it another stocking cycle about to begin I mean if they haven&#39;t had a stocking cycle in 22 years they&#39;re probably not going to have one now this looks like a dog and it probably is a bunch of management that dilutes owners and issues a ton of stock cash flows going down revenues are going down uh nothing I like about it yet let me just see if these guys are pigs and I can save our a lot of time if management doesn&#39;t respect equity and they make my slice of the pie smaller without my permission by duding me and issuing shares to themselves or at bad prices I will never do business with them um I I like to say they&#39;re either going to leave or I&#39;m going to leave and more likely it&#39;s going to be me leaving Okay so don&#39;t have an equity problem so what kind of problem do they have they have a lowquality business problem they get a a a return on invested Capital that&#39;s lower than their weighted average cost of capital and that&#39;s a sign of a bad business with no mop so uh I&#39;m going to be a pass on that one Patrick uh how did you come across your current stock selections uh Patrick I I mean it&#39;s so funny most just look at my daily reads which me very few people do I mean I read like 20 30 40 articles as I mean maybe more only 20 30 40 make it to my what I&#39;m reading today list that&#39;s starter then I get all the Wall Street research then I&#39;m constantly screening stocks every single day then I&#39;ve been reading annual reports and listening to conference calls for 20 some odd years so when I see something I I can react it&#39;s like how could Buffett do an 8 and a half billion deal with Goldman Sachs in 2008 from his bathtub because he&#39;s been studying the company for 20 years so he could allocate eight and a half billion dollars in five minutes not because he was being Reckless because he knew the company I know 90% of these companies and I see how they respond through cycles and when opportunity presents itself it&#39;s like the plumber you know he comes in in the old joke uh he comes in he Taps on the thing he says you know 400 bucks it&#39;s fixed they&#39;re like 400 bucks that only took you a minute he goes yeah it was only $4 for the minute it was 396 for the 20 years of expertise that told me where to tap on it h which took only one minute and that&#39;s that&#39;s really what it comes down to there&#39;s no shortcut you got to do the work and experience it and if you don&#39;t love the game go build a business and lay it off to someone who&#39;s good who does love the game and does it 247 that you&#39;re never going to be able to compete with because you don&#39;t have two sets of 24 hours in one day Don L uh do you think with the beginning of a Nat gas super cycle given AI needs Comstock or 100 or 200 could be a possibility dur due to euphoric markets Don who cares at this point uh I don&#39;t want to speculate all I can tell you is it&#39;s its liquidation value is still you know close to double where it is now uh and then I&#39;ll take a look at what the fundamentals look like and all the super cycle headline nonsense but look if I come out of it on an eight or $ n basis at $50 and I I sell a bunch of it and keep a little bit of it and it goes to 300 I&#39;m not going to lose sleep I already made a six bagger in a couple of years uh if I if I left a 12 or 24 bagger on the table I&#39;ll keep a tail on it I&#39;ll keep another 25% and let it run for a while but uh that&#39;s all speculation who cares about that but thank you for the nice question and highlighting one of the winners because uh for those of you who know we don&#39;t spend much time on our winners on this conference call we spend to tend to spend all the time on the ones that haven&#39;t left the station yet which we enjoy doing John Doe uh insurers like Fairfax and Marquel uh look I have no idea what their exposure is to the California stuff I know they&#39;re going to use it as an opportunity to um increase prices uh but no I&#39;m not buying marel here I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s up almost triple since since covid uh that&#39;s not when you buy insurers you buy insurers when no one wants some like Lincoln National a couple years that&#39;s when you buy insurers this is a lowquality business you bought it in the hole at 15 bucks you got a four bagger just on recovery you know cyclical type stuff it&#39;s probably still cheap here because it&#39;s a lowquality business but Markel is a high quality business and it&#39;s trading at all-time high so not interested Fairfax I mean these are all I want to be Warren Buffett well everyone wants to be Warren Buffett which is why they&#39;re fully priced so you&#39;re not really adding any value by buying something that&#39;s trading at fully valued so um yeah they&#39;re great businesses you won&#39;t lose money investing them over time but there&#39;s an opportunity cost and you know there&#39;s there&#39;s this whole kind of Cadre of people only buy the highest quality blah blah blah and then they buy them when they&#39;re everything is perfect and they&#39;re at all-time highs and a perfect return on Capital and what happens they hit a cycle the thing goes down 50% they were right about it being high quality they bought it at the wrong time which is why I like I like taking B andc players when they&#39;re absolutely decimated but I can be clear they&#39;re not going out of business because then I&#39;m going to get a triple and I don&#39;t have to have the best quality one breaking out and all this I can just buy a business that I know is not going out of business and make a double or triple over a few years rinse and repeat over and over so I&#39;ll leave that one there thank you for the question thanks for being a listener Philipe Andrew pinkos uh is asking about China listening to their last call they&#39;re very happy about China I&#39;m very happy about China uh GL Smith client is from Chris C uh I think many of these uh you know kind of value Pharma are going to start to do well but this is not a good use of capital you&#39;re lucky if you get a double over three or four years and you know it&#39;s kind of a lowquality uh business you got to understand the pipeline and if I don&#39;t have at least a guaranteed double in a short period of time I&#39;m not going to spend the time on it so with this one I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s trading flat because the business has been flat so so if you can tell me that there&#39;s some amazing drug in the pipeline I might listen but that&#39;s not the business I do uh you think this recently Indie semiconductor which foken company like Indie I&#39;m not interested in those tiny little players because they&#39;re going to get smoked out Sebastian

didn&#39;t really recover with everything else and maybe now&#39;s the time cash flows inflecting revenues inflecting margin&#39;s going up so look there&#39;s some positive stuff I think if you buy this you&#39;re fine maybe you make a double but I just let me take a closer look here because I I I&#39;ve looked at this thing over and over and done nothing and been right but maybe now I&#39;m going to start being wrong but errors of omission I&#39;m good with and just not errors of O commission you know it&#39;s never it&#39;s never been a business that earned above its cost of capital so it&#39;s a crappy business but when they catch a cycle they go and they didn&#39;t catch the last cycle they&#39;re still burning cash uh it got 800 million bucks and how much debt 1.7 billion let&#39;s see if that at least respect Equity a little bit uh yeah so so they&#39;re growing the share count a little bit Ah I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get hurt I think maybe you get a double it&#39;s okay Kevin McAllister uh Alx for China small cap exposure I don&#39;t want China small cap exposure it&#39;s got to be the highest I&#39;m not taking company and Country I understand the thought on it not not really interested Foot Locker Foot Locker is a play on Nike ladies and gentlemen why don&#39;t you just buy Nike I would just buy Nike don&#39;t buy Foot Locker I&#39;m not even going to look at it Mastercraft boat you know this is like Fu foxf uh interest rates coming down all the overstocks uh work through so maybe these Recreation things start to ro roll again C I mean with all the boat parades uh they&#39;re going to be having with the Trump Flags maybe they&#39;ll sell a lot of boats now let&#39;s see master craft why is this not coming up are you sure it&#39;s not Malibu Boats I think it&#39;s Malibu Boats and they sell Mastercraft uh I don&#39;t think this is ready yet I I I&#39;ve looked at this a bunch I don&#39;t like these recreational things you know the the RV businesses uh let&#39;s see Malibu Boats do they sell mastercrafts well it&#39;s the same thing I mean it&#39;s the same business ah let me see if these things are starting to inflect at all I mean revenues are still decimated as a matter of fact I have a friend who sells uh Boston Whalers and like Criss crafts and all that type of stuff and they&#39;ve gotten smoked the last couple of years I mean it&#39;s starting to stabilize a little bit I think you might be early I mean these revenues are getting smoked I would take a look at this inventory recovery is probably showing that they&#39;re working down inventories and and maybe a restock cycle uh uh this one let me just take a look here see if it&#39;s ever been a good business yeah I all right I get it um see if they&#39;re going to live another day 30 $26 million of cash is that right how much debt do they have not much and freak cash flow negative you really got to understand is the turnaround real I mean is this legit uh they&#39;re back to kind of preco is sales levels and back then it was kind of trading where it is now I think you got to do a lot more work but I definitely see what you potentially see Drew Robinson wary Parker no interest uh Jimmy Jones uh Baxter High PE ratio all the stocks we buy probably have high PE ratios because at the time we buy them they&#39;re in trough earning cycle so that we never even talk about pees on this this uh uh podcast we talk about cash flow we talk about revenues we talk about margins because when we&#39;re buying it they&#39;re down 60 80% and they&#39;re going to be at negative or or break even earnings so you&#39;re going to have a 100 times multiple if you&#39;re earning a penny and the stock is trading at $1 and uh and if they have uh no earnings in the short term which is very often in turnaround Tom&#39;s uh picks when they&#39;re down 80% uh but we&#39;ve seen them operate through Decades of cycles and we know that&#39;s what happens every cycle um you know they their multiples infinite so PE is not the right question the right question is uh what does their cash flow and earnings power look like proforma when the kidney business is out and they pay down debt their interest uh expense goes down and the multiple rates because the slowest growing part of their business the kid kidney business which pulled the multiple down from 18 down to 12 is now out of there and all they&#39;re left with is a fast growing business that warrants a higher multiple uh and it rates from you know 12 times to 18 times and gets gets momentum and Off to the Races so p is the wrong question uh mod is the right question no one no one even compares in the IV business and and the areas that they uh compete their pump business had a little bit of a softness they now got the new pump out that&#39;s going to absolutely kick ass and uh they&#39;re going to be Off to the Races so love that one uh Scott Wilson resonated most with your recommendations not advice by the way go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms all of this is opinion not advice talk to your financial adviser don&#39;t do anything yada yada yada read terms uh what is he talking here okay now Scott you&#39;re right on on point thanks for inviting me up to ohigh uh whenever I get up there I will definitely look you up and uh very grateful for your support over the year and recommending to your friend and colleagues you&#39;re on the right track those are good tools to have you could probably get value line at your uh local library uh if you want to do that and um very grateful for the kind words Jeremy uh all right do gp1s hurt Hershey yes they hurt Hershey they hurt diio but it&#39;s reflect in the price certainly in the case of diio Hershey there could be a little bit more hurt before it actually Rock and rolls but um Hershey&#39;s is just one of the greatest businesses and uh you know look not everyone&#39;s going to stay on these things that&#39;s just the nature of the Beast so I I look every week I look at Hershey and I&#39;m interested and I do nothing so this will probably be one that I miss I mean at 100 it&#39;s at 150 bucks if it got to 100 bucks I wouldn&#39;t even have to think about it cuz like so much is priced in uh and uh I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re on 80 gp1s you&#39;re still going to eat Reese&#39;s Pieces I mean who doesn&#39;t eat Reese the stuff is like crack I mean it&#39;s the best tasting thing in the world so and no one can replicate if you actually understand the Hershey business and how they have these special stones that take like 10 years to replicate and no one can replicate that particular flavor which is also the moat of the Coca-Cola Company um I think you&#39;ll find that um Hershey&#39;s going to be just fine so I would say I&#39;m interested in Hershey I&#39;m aware of the glp1 issue and there&#39;s not a big enough Motor Safety for me to back up the truck yet and I fully expect that it&#39;ll run away from me before it gets to a point where I would back up the truck and I&#39;m perfectly okay with errors of omission not errors of commission thoughts on Snap uh I hate this business I think uh no not for me if it turns around it turns around but it&#39;s the same manager and it&#39;s just been a dog forever uh the idea is that if Tik Tok gets out everyone&#39;s going to have to use snap I mean you got to go through the whole thing th this guy&#39;s no Zuckerberg this guy is uh uh different level he&#39;s in the bush League Zuckerberg is in the you know pro league and I just don&#39;t know how it turns around um I think there&#39;s a demographic that uses it every day but it&#39;s like 5 year to seven-year window the the new young people don&#39;t use it at all the uh middle young people use it a lot this has never been a good business uh just uh no not for me cheap for a reason Allan I covered the China thing on CPS let&#39;s try Bart Market access I

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwe're going to get right down to it uh we usually do family photos first but these are my friends that are like family who came out to visit us in California stayed with us for a couple days last week uh this is Robert and his lovely wife Desiree who by the way has been in the running for our club champion ship multiple years uh back in Connecticut uh but we we got to play the club out here in Orange County and that was absolutely incredible thanks for so so much for coming out to Rob and Desiree and we also had the privilege the next day to play Big Canyon in Newport Beach which was unbelievable thanks for setting that up uh and Jason for hosting us and then uh there&#39;s a picture of me it was actually cold that day this week it&#39;s been quite warm my game is coming coming back which is pretty awesome the markets close at 1:00 on Pacific Time now the flip side is I&#39;m up at 4:30 every morning which I don&#39;t mind today I was up at 1:30 because I miscalculated uh what time CNBC Indonesia was and it dawned on me that the the time spread might be different last night at 900 p.m. rather than waking up at 4:00 a.m. I had to wake up at 1:00 a.m. but uh uh you know world&#39;s smallest violin let&#39;s get down to the media I want to thank The Amazing Taylor rigs Jake Max Stu oppenheim millanie kapadia obviously Liz Clayman for having me on the Clayman countdown and Katherine Meyers so here I am with Taylor Smith excuse me Taylor Swift Taylor rigs uh been a long day The Amazing Taylor rigs love going on with her uh we talked two weeks ago and a followup on the conversation we had there how it&#39;s all coming into play here we go got it um all right moments ago we heard president Trump talking about interest rates in the Oval Office after he signed an executive order on crypto This Is Us the first fed meeting of the year it kicks off on Tuesday joining us now great Hill Capitol chairman Tom Hayes to count us down to the closing bell Tom we love having you um what do you make of some of the interest rate conversations that we&#39;ve been having particularly as we gear up for the big fed well you you heard Donald Trump this morning from Davos and thanks for having me Taylor uh saying he wants lower interest rates he wants that debt free financing we know the debt uh interest payments have gone from under a half a trillion to now going to be more than a trillion so he&#39;s going to continue to put pressure he&#39;s going to continue to cut costs with the Doge program so that the market has confidence we&#39;re being fiscally responsible and the market will take care of interest rates over time so I love filling in for Liz Clayman because you are my repeat guest the last time I was on with you you talked about right the last in is now going to be the first out right when you think about the performers in this market are you starting to see that play out yeah there&#39;s no question and I enjoyed being on with you a couple weeks ago I said the last shall be first and what are we seeing today we&#39;re seeing materials we&#39;re seeing health care we&#39;re seeing Industrials start to outperform and the reason is simple business friendly friendly environment cut taxes uh great environment for these type of businesses moving forward and price is what you pay value is what you get so we came into the year with the mag 7 having decelerating earnings growth uh uh for a high multiple decelerating to 21% earnings growth for 33 times versus the rest of the market at a much lower multiple and money is finding its way into the Great Value there I know but so we only have 30 seconds left I&#39;m looking at Boeing on your list it takes a lot of crossing your fingers to bet on Boeing right now or you&#39;re happy well the big thing is with turnarounds the key is solvency risk and Kelly ortberg took care of that by raising $20 billion of cash they still have a duopoly they still have a half a trillion dollar backlog so we like Boeing we like that story and Trump has said he wants the rest of the world spending massively on defense spending Boeing is going to be a beneficiary we like that story continuing Thomas Hayes thank you so much penny for your thoughts as well so let&#39;s take a look at this we&#39;re firmly in record territory the S&P and we&#39;re back uh on to the next this was a special segment I I did uh on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange when I was in town with Jared blicker and Sydney freed also want to thank Taylor choia Smith for putting this together this is a new uh podcast that they have which gets syndicated everywhere and this was an amazing go anywhere podcast that we covered uh China Baba everything you could possibly imagine Advanced Auto Parts turnarounds how we think about turnaround so I wanted to get this one early in the podcast this week so listen and [Music] here welcome to

are going to be talking about guess what we got Warren Buffett we got David teer talking about value and macro and no spoiler alert we&#39;ve got them in a finale you do not want to miss our word of the day or phrase of the day is vssd stands for volatility spreads and duration how the pros use these terms to read the bond market tea leaves and this episode is brought to you by the number 21% that is how much The Magnificent Seven profits are expected to grow this year which happens to be exactly the same for the S&P 600 that&#39;s small caps it&#39;s a 2025 Davy Goliath Market Showdown but we before we get to some of the more jargon busting uh parts of this show Tom why don&#39;t you just give us your big picture overview of where we are in the markets right now yeah I think uh for 2025 we can expect a good good year however not quite as good as 2024 uh we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of looking at high single digits to low double digits but I think the real story is going to be the rotation what is going to drive those gains and what is holding back bigger gains and that that has to do with rotation that we&#39;re going to talk about all right great so you are a value investor we want to start with another VW vstd which really doesn&#39;t have a lot to do with value but we&#39;re going to talk about it anyway we got volatility spread and duration so taking them one at a time volatility it measures price swings and then spreads that shows the difference in in yields between two different bonds so how far apart they are and then we have duration which measures how sensitive a bond is to changes in interest rates so if the FED raises or lowers rates how does that Bond react to it and I&#39;m just wondering how you use this information to judge what&#39;s happening right now because we&#39;ve seen huge rises in the tenure t-note yield which has been pressuring R risk markets you know it&#39;s interesting uh what we&#39;re seeing in the last few weeks is exactly what we saw after Trump 1.0 after the election before the inauguration and what what basically happened in 2016 he ran on being tariff man and the king of debt so what did the markets do as soon as he was elected dollar rallied yields blew out uh emerging markets and international stocks sold off and then after the inauguration what&#39;s surprising to most people that they forget is that bonds actually rallied yields compressed the dollar came down and and international stocks did exceptionally well China had one of its best years ever in 200 17 after the inauguration so I think

spend and risk seeding market share to their competition or they get more compute power per dollar of spend competition catches up and it&#39;s a race to the bottom for margins and this time will be no different well the selloff in January continue well after the inauguration we&#39;ll find out with Thomas Hayes managing member of great Hill Capital he also break down his sector allocation preferences and uh value versus growth an interesting theme for 2025 Thomas welcome back to the show happy new year thanks for having me David let&#39;s take a look at my screen right now this is the S&amp;P 500 ever since uh basically the uh top in December it&#39;s down roughly um 5% or so is this just a seasonal pullback that we&#39;re seeing or is uncertainty around the Trump Administration starting to pile up here yeah I think uh it&#39;s not dissimilar to the volatility we saw after the election in 2016 Trump 1.0 through the inauguration 2017 and then things kind of normalized I think what&#39;s got people sideways is yields blowing out 10-year yield accelerating first you had uh the FED uncertainty in December and then you had that super strong jobs report which uh worried the market that maybe we&#39;re not going to get the two cuts that the FED projected in their uh SCP and instead uh now we&#39;re at only 70% of one cut by October and the market is adjusting to that and and if you look at the general indices uh it&#39;s almost misleading you know you had Industrials small caps down almost 10% it was pretty violent interruption in December you you had seen a trend of regular broadening healthy broadening since July of last year and then uh as we got through the election and into that fed issue in December uh really an Abrupt pause in that in that broadening theme and I I do think we&#39;re going to resume that for a number of reasons we can cover today the 10e yield is that a signal of strength in the economy or expectations for further strength in the economy or simply that the inflation expectations are being pushed out higher uh which may or may not be good for equities it depends who you talk to I mean you know if you look at the University of Michigan uh uh inflation expectations jumped up a little bit uh last week both on the one-year and threeyear uh expectation to 3.3% that is embedded in the consumers expectation of tariffs increasing prices now you have seen the administration leak a couple of things number one maybe it&#39;ll be targeted to certain industries or subsets and number two it might be gradual we&#39;ve been of the camp it won&#39;t be as bad as advertised I think the advertisement was 60% tariffs across the board uh I think that&#39;s going to be more more modest and more reasonable like we saw in Trump 1.0 uh then on the flip side you do have uh the fact that the economy is growing you know you&#39;re you&#39;re gonna have mid teens earnings growth so uh there&#39;s a view that yields are expanding due to that and then there&#39;s a third Viewpoint that you got to issue9 trillion of debt to refinance in 2025 so that uh yields are blowing out in excess but what I will say is I&#39;m more of the camp that this is exactly what happened between the election and the inauguration in 2016 to 2017 Trump ran as the king of debt uh the king of the Tariff King uh he&#39;s run on the exact same platform in uh 2024 and the market is trying to digest to what extent will he be the king of these two initiatives uh and uh we&#39;re taking the under the market right now is taking the over I think the market is overestimating because as you saw in 2016 to 2007 17 while the dollar rallied after the November election and bonds yields uh really accelerated after the election after the inauguration bonds got bid yields compressed for the next year plus the dollar rolled over International stocks took off biotech stocks took off oil stocks collapsed uh so it was the exact opposite of what everyone was expecting and we think it could be some version of that rhyming not repeating yes and as a hedge fund manager are you positioned for more of a pullback right now or is it still risk on for you generally speaking uh we run a concentrated Equity portfolio that has a very low correlation to the S&amp;P 500 weights so the businesses we buy we we enter we do a lot of turnarounds and we&#39;re buying at a point in time where we feel the margin of safety is Extreme meaning that if the business was liquidated tomorrow we would make a profit if the turnaround plan plays we make a double or triple over a few years and and in some cases multibagger uh so we&#39;re less concerned with what the Market&#39;s doing on a day-to-day basis if the market pulled back 20% % uh in the next couple months it wouldn&#39;t change one view on any of the eight or 12 core positions in the portfolio uh and uh and and very likely if the indices pulled back which we don&#39;t anticipate anything of that magnitude but if they pulled back materially what that would tell me more likely is that the rotation that we&#39;ve been talking about is playing out because the indices pulling back is is evidence of the mag 7 predominantly getting hit because of the weights in the index and uh and and we&#39;re going to make our money in the 493 and international prospectively which would be less impacted by the overall uh Market liquidation Thomas you talked about some sectors uh that surprised uh some investors were would surprise some investors during a trump 2.0 so let&#39;s talk about um some of these so we actually discuss this in detail when Trump won the election link down below Thomas was on one of my first guests after uh November 7th um in particular energy is interesting um the oil price right now is moving up a lot higher now some of it had to do with um sanctions on Russia but perhaps expectations are that uh Trump is actually going to follow through on some of his promises what what do you think is going on in the energy sector right now yeah we have exposure to the energy sector to a company called Comstock resources uh Jerry Jones who owns the Cowboys owns about 66% of the stock at around $710 our basis is about a buck higher it&#39;s now trading around 20 we believe uh the intrinsic value of it both proved uh reserves pv10 that they have to report to the S&amp;P 500 around 20 30 bucks uh per share and then unproved we think is another $20 so we we don&#39;t really worry about the day-to-day vacillations in natural gas or in um or in in oil prices I would say that sentiment got so pessimistic on oil uh and oil stocks in December that uh it it was clear that we would get some some level of Bounce the problem with the integrated and even some of the servicers is that when we get involved in a in a business we we are looking for a meaningful irr over a few years 30% plus and I just didn&#39;t find the risk reward despite low quote unquote pees uh and high dividends and buying back shares Etc I just didn&#39;t find the asymmetry in the uh General oil and gas space that I did during 2020 when we were buying it hand over fist when oil turned negative uh that&#39;s when I like to get involved so for now our exposure is limited if you put a gun to my head and said how are you going to take advantage of the increased Drilling and the and the uh energy favorable policies from the Trump Administration I&#39;d be inclined to being servicers potentially like a Slumber J or something like that we have no position there but if we do expand our energy exposure Beyond Comstock that is where we would be looking and it would not surprise us at all if we see some follow through both in the sector because that&#39;s a component of value which we think is going to have a better year than than it did last year uh and um uh and some of the initiatives as far as the consolidation in the industry deals happening in the industry Etc it&#39;s just we&#39;re we&#39;re not getting enough juice for squeeze so we&#39;re looking elsewhere where we can get a lot of juice and uh how are you eyeing the tech sector now that Trump has probably signaled a doubling down of tariffs in the trade War globally is a tech sector at risk from tariffs and just more protectionism overall I think that as we look at the mag 7 which is an overweight in the indices so you are over dramatically overweight Tech if you own the S&amp;P 500 passively uh and atically overweight if if you&#39;re chasing the nvidias and uh and and the Googles and Etc the thing that our view is the the outperformance of the mag 7 last year was somewhat justified by the earnings power of the mag 7 last year so it&#39;s okay to have a 33 times multiple when you have 33% earnings growth the the problem going into this year is that earnings growth is going to decelerate for the mag 7 from 33% down to it was 21% as of a few days ago now I&#39;ve seen numbers down to 18% so your your earnings growth is going to almost have but the multiple is still at 33 time so that the multiple is still high it has not yet derated so that&#39;s not where I want to be where I want to be is w\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nwe have exposure to the energy sector to a company called Comstock resources uh Jerry Jones who owns the Cowboys owns about 66% of the stock at around $710 our

back shares Etc I just didn&#39;t find the asymmetry in the uh General oil and gas space that I did during 2020 when we were buying it hand over fist when oil turned negative uh that&#39;s when I like to get involved so for now our exposure is limited if you put a gun to my head and said how are you going to take advantage of the increased Drilling and the and the uh energy favorable policies from the Trump Administration I&#39;d be inclined to being servicers potentially like a Slumber J or something like that we have no position there but if we do expand our energy exposure Beyond Comstock that is where we would be looking and it would not surprise us at all if we see some follow through both in the sector because that&#39;s a component of value which we think is going to have a better year than than it did last year uh and um uh and some of the initiatives as far as the consolidation in the industry deals happening in the industry Etc it&#39;s just we&#39;re we&#39;re not getting enough juice for squeeze so we&#39;re looking elsewhere where we can get a lot of juice and uh how are you eyeing the tech sector now that Trump has probably signaled a doubling down of tariffs in the trade War globally is a tech sector at risk from tariffs and just more protectionism overall I think that as we look at the mag 7 which is an overweight in the indices so you are over dramatically overweight Tech if you own the S&amp;P 500 passively uh and atically overweight if if you&#39;re chasing the nvidias and uh and and the Googles and Etc the thing that our view is the the outperformance of the mag 7 last year was somewhat justified by the earnings power of the mag 7 last year so it&#39;s okay to have a 33 times multiple when you have 33% earnings growth the the problem going into this year is that earnings growth is going to decelerate for the mag 7 from 33% down to it was 21% as of a few days ago now I&#39;ve seen numbers down to 18% so your your earnings growth is going to almost have but the multiple is still at 33 time so that the multiple is still high it has not yet derated so that&#39;s not where I want to be where I want to be is w\n\nno Nvidia so Nvidia can design chips but if they can&#39;t produce them they they have no business so as much as there&#39;s pessimism around the intels of the world which you know if they if they just liquidated the thing now investors would get their money back plus a few dollars um the US has invested eight billion dollars of real cash and then billions of subsidies and everything else so whether they stand up the Fab or not or or put it into a separate entity first thing they got to do is announce a new CEO I think when all is said and done what you&#39;ll find is that everything Pat gelsinger said was going to happen he had basically gotten he got into the 10 yard line and they and they they they took the ball away before he could cross the finish line he did the four nodes in five years he&#39;s uh he look he burned a lot of cash so he had to go the board got board so the name of the game is they need to hire someone and announce someone who&#39;s credible and then just finish Ginger&#39;s plan because everything&#39;s in place and if they can get the Fab business going either in the current entity or in a separate entity and they can uh catch up I think that one&#39;s got an interesting possibility relative to margin of safety of if you&#39;re conservative and you don&#39;t believe in their future as a Fab uh it&#39;s probably a double just on the Legacy business and if if they get the right CEO and if you do believe in gelsinger&#39;s full plan then this thing could be a multibagger but leaving that aside the amds will catch up uh the Marvel&#39;s the broad there there&#39;s a lot of people gunning for a piece of the Jensen Wong pie and like every cycle you can be assured that they will get some of it not all of it but they will get enough of it that um you&#39;ll see margin compression and you&#39;ll see a normalization of multiples last question on uh Ai and Nvidia this came in this week Nvidia stock Falls after Biden Administration releases updated export rules for AI chips so the Stock&#39;s been down about 12 133% since it&#39;s to in uh uh late December but uh anyway this came out it fell nearly 2% on Monday after the Biden Administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence chips to adversaries such as China the White House said that the rule will cap the number of AI chips called gpus that can be ordered by most countries without a special license smaller orders of 1,700 or fewer gpus would not count toward the export cap um is this significant for the industry at all or um or not so much I mean you expect this to be reversed uh it&#39;s significant for the industry but not for the reasons that you think number one in the short term it will hurt hurt the industry a little bit in the intermediate term to long term it will it will destroy the industry because what you basically did in the name of National Security is you&#39;ve taken uh a uh eager paying customer to us companies and said you can no longer buy from us so you&#39;ve given them no choice but to learn how to create that competency for themselves and how do they do that it&#39;s very simple they pick off the best talent uh they reverse engineer the technology and they do it themselves whereas if the government did not impose these restrictions they would stay dependent on us uh forever uh so effectively in the short term it looks like a win because they don&#39;t have the same technology in the intermediate term after they ship the the chips through other countries and ultimately get them and reverse engineer them and they front-loaded a bunch before of this anyway to buy them a few years to reverse engineer the technology and hire out all the best talent um uh the the big issue is maybe the competition that I&#39;m talking about is not coming from the the players that were anticipating and it&#39;s coming from players that are just now getting um uh going and from from China\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ngreat thank you very much uh close off let&#39;s close off on your sector overweights and underweights for 2025 suing everything together yeah I think uh three themes here first values outperform growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 so we want to be skewed toward adding value this year and the and the recency bias around value in the last since 2010 has been zero interest rate policy if you believe we&#39;re going back to to zero interest rate policy then stay overweight growth if you believe we&#39;re in a normalized environment which we do start adding some value uh into the portfolio the second theme is uh small over large you get the same or better earnings growth for half the multiple this year it worked in Trump 1.0 and the third theme is start to get some International exposure because like value and growth that runs in Cycles uh International and US runs in cycles and when you see a headline uh us exceptionalism the note that you referenced uh it&#39;s often time to start to get some Expos internationally again you know 13 14% earnings growth for 30% less multiple International is the thing as far as domestic last shall be First Health Care and um health care for sure and materials are ways to get value for massive earnings growth acceleration in 2025 uh and I think the one of the surprises of 2025 is that following the inauguration into the first quarter I think you&#39;re going to see bonds start to get bid 10 yields start to get bid yields compress uh and I I think that the uh the pounding the table around 5% is going to be more like 4% would be my bet as we move throughout the year uh I I take the under I&#39;d see the 10year yield closer to 4% then closer to 5% uh towards the end of the year for sure interesting\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nexclusive Thomas J&#39;s chairman and managing members great Hill Capital cnia America how are you Thomas it&#39;s been a while I&#39;m doing great thanks for having me Saina thank you for joining us in CNBC Indonesia just barely three days ago Donald Trump has been inaugurated as the 47 presidents of the United States of America so what is your outlook for the US economy yeah I think we&#39;re going to see a very positive high growth economy like we saw in the first few years of his first term uh certainly positive impact on the economy positive impact on the stock market and it&#39;s really going to be driven by tax cuts lower taxes lower regulation more business-friendly environment and I think the other aspect of what we&#39;re going to see safrina is a more broadening in the participation like we saw in the first term uh people at the lower level of the income strata are going to do a lot better just like they did in 2017 2018 2019 we&#39;re also going to see a lot more sector participation us markets have been pretty concentrated in Tech participation magnificent 7 I think we&#39;re going to start to see a lot more companies in Industrials manufacturing banking energy uh start to participate small caps Etc so a lot of broadening and uh and good performance in stock outside of the Magnificent 7 moving forward and also the labor force Market as you mention yes yeah there&#39;s no question about it uh they going to be uh better wages there going to be more jobs there&#39;s going to be a lot more investment in the US a lot more manufacturing you know manufacturing has been in a recession or even a a slump for two straight years I think you&#39;re going to see some policies and some investment that&#39;s going to make manufacturing boom again that&#39;s going to create a lot of high paying jobs and beside the manufacturing Industries in the United States what do you believe will be his key priorities to strengthen your domestic economy Thomas yeah I think there there are a few Sao number one is going to Unleash the Beast of US Energy we have unlimited beautiful natural resources\n\nregulation becomes more friendly you could have a lot more tokens and crypto Investments that may in fact dilute the couple that currently have uh a duop on the crypto investment funds right Thomas and this is Trum 2.0 as we mentioned here and given the history of the previous trade War do you think we will foree the possibility of a trade War 2.0 between the US and China under this Trump&#39;s leadership I think that uh first and foremost I think that&#39;s a headline that&#39;s unfair I think what Trump wants to do is threaten big okay and then negotiate a favorable win-win deal okay and if you look at the big focused has been on China uh you know China is a small portion of our global trade it&#39;s about $600 billion of call it 5 trillion uh he came out of the gate and he said 60% Trump&#39;s tariffs on China day one well now we&#39;re talking about 10% tariffs on China and it wasn&#39;t on day one it&#39;s going to be pushed off till February so I think uh you know as it relates to China his number one thing is stop get stop allowing this fent andol to go through our borders it&#39;s hurting a lot of our people so he&#39;s going to use the tariffs to get the Chinese to cooperate on those issues that are very very important to the US uh there probably will be some level of tariffs but it will be a lot lower than advertised and then once that framework and agreement is in place I think it will Foster a lot more business between the two countries versus the previous administration that you know consistently said you know China was wrong and and never got to the table to do a good deal but how do you particular see the relations between Donald Trump and cim Bank I think they&#39;re actually a lot better than is advertised uh on the\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nheadlines  I think they&#39;re already communicating it&#39;s been announced that they&#39;re communicating I think there&#39;s a level of mutual respect uh which and and um uh a willingness to talk and a willingness to come to a table look Donald Trump is an America first president he wants to do what&#39;s in the best interest of America but he understands in business in order to get what he wants he has to have a deal that makes sense for the other party he&#39;s been doing this for his entire career business career going over 60 years at this point and he will come to a favorable deal and I think we&#39;ll have very positive relations uh with China and with our other trade Partners after a little bit of volatility to come to good terms and that&#39;s the way negotiation works you ask for everything and then you come to a good winwin uh solution now for the geopolitical situations um given the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza uh do you think the US under the administrations of Donald Trump should play a more active role in providing or seeking a r solution what do you think is Donald Trump&#39;s going to do well I think if if past this any prologue in Trump 1.0 we saw record World Peace uh it was really the situation so I do think he&#39;ll be involved I do you think that will be resolved much more quickly than it possibly could have under the previous bureaucrats an Administration I think that uh I think that leaders around the world respect and and respect Trump and and know he means business when when he says to come to the table and he&#39;s going to do a deal something&#39;s going to get done so I do see a situation where geopolitical issues are going to be much more muted we&#39;re going to get rid of all these multi-front wars uh we&#39;re going to come to some negotiated resolutions through Trump peace through strength and it will be good for the world and we can focus on business and Global Prosperity right wonderful insights always from you Thomas thank you so much for joining us in CNBC Indonesia take care thanks Saina appreciate it and I want to thank uh fitria angran and safrina nushan for having me on that one uh and then uh couple nights ago I was on cgtn America with Sean calebs also uh want to thank camia kilan for having me on we&#39;ll listen in here welcome back everyone he was chosen by Trump to in part cut government costs but it appears he has been cut Vivic ramaswami announced his departure from the Department of government efficiency or Doge to possibly run for governor of the state of Ohio however various source-based report say ramas Swami was Iced Out by Elon Musk ramas Swami was tapped by Trump alongside musk to streamline federal spending now with his exit musk is now fully in charge and leads the push to cut government waste some say ramas Swami&#39;s departure is reminiscent of the many leadership changes seen during Trump&#39;s first term in office so what exactly will Elon Musk do key initiatives include modernizing outdated systems as well as implementing cost-saving work force reductions drawing from his corporate experience musk aims to overhaul inefficient Federal process with a tech driven approach however these plans have sparked legal challenges and also raised concern about potential impacts on essential government services let&#39;s take a closer look at that and for that we&#39;re joined by Thomas Hayes founder and chairman and managing member of great Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure welcome good to see you good to see you Sean okay so what do we know about Doge it seems like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a moving Target day two in office and we&#39;re back to this kind of chaos uh that seems to follow the the current president Elon Musk firmly entrenched but as we heard Vivic ramas Swami out and Trump saying Doge will be entrenched in the executive branch not an outside committee I know just threw a lot at you but how important is this going to be to the US economy and what Ripple effects do you expect to see through the markets well I think this is a big deal Sean because as you know the interest expense has ballooned in the last few years nearly doubling from uh under half a trillion to now over a trillion dollars a year due to interest rate increases and spending uh you know 120% debt to GDP so it&#39;s absolutely essential that not only does this uh initiative work uh but more importantly that it is perceived to be working because I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to get $2 trillion of cuts and I think Elon Musk has intimated as much by saying well two trillion would be nice 1 billion is one trillion is more realistic I think if they got a half a trillion it would be huge to get out of this type of mess historically the number one thing you need is massive growth and I think this White House is keenly focused on massive growth through deregulation and through tax cuts and through other growth initiatives but we do need a perception of getting that spending under control and that&#39;s what doge is all about yeah this perception is important and look this isn&#39;t the first time a US president has vowed to cut the fat in federal government and Trump in his first term added more money to the federal deficit any president so tell me why this time things are going to be different well I think that there&#39;s no choice okay in order to uh get the interest rates under control he wants to bring interest rates down you can only control that through the FED which is an independent body uh and the long end of the curve is really going to tell you whether the market believes they are getting the spending under control but you know there are some sensible ideas that are coming out as a as a function of this dialogue plug which is you know consolidating a lot of these redundant government agencies or making them more uh efficient uh even you&#39;ve you&#39;ve heard the idea of reducing the number of them from 400 down to 100 which would be a tall order uh probably a wish list uh more than a reality but if we move in this direction it&#39;s going to send the right message to the market more people will want to buy our debt we can refinance at lower rates while we wait for growth to uh pick up a bit growth been good it could get better Thomas you make some great points and uh that t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally  today uh CNA which is like the BBC of Singapore and all of Asia huge station want to thank Audrey Tay and Sarah Al khi for having me on to talk more Trump and other implications listen in here Traders anticipating a new era of lower interest rates and cheaper oil helped push Wall Street to record highs overnight the S&P 500 hit an alltime inaday high above the 6,100 Milestone following comments from US president Donald Trump at the world economic Forum he said he would demand an immediate drop in borrowing costs the Dow and the NASDAQ both ended in the positive for a fourth straight session energy stocks tempered some of those gains with the S&P 500 energy sector on track for its worst weekly performance since late December Mr Trump also told Davos business Elites he plans to ask Saudi Arabia to lower the price of oil to dampen inflation his speech comes just before the fed&#39;s meeting next week where they are largely expected to keep interest rates unchanged there have been concerns that potential sweeping tariffs by the Trump Administration could add to inflationary pressures and slow the fed&#39;s policy easing path for more of the markets we have Thomas Hayes chairman and managing member at Great Hill Capital thanks for your time Tomas so gains for Wall Street but it&#39;s really been concentrated in a very narrow part of the market despite expectations of growth under the Trump Administration so do you think it&#39;s time to move on to other previously unloved parts of the market or is it time to bet on these tried and tested names because of the uncertainty that we might see well Sarah I think what you saw today and thank you for having me by the way was a continuation of a trend that started last July which was the broadening of the market the what I call the unmagnify everything other than the Magnificent 7 and the S&P 500 really started to outperform up until December and right after the election and with some fed uncertainty in December uh mag mag 7 came back abruptly in De but now we&#39;re seeing a resumption of the trend the last shall be first those sectors that underperformed last year are beginning to outperform and you saw it healthc care was up today Industrials were up today materials were up and guess what was down magnificent 7 and that&#39;s the type of economy that we had under Trump 1.0 was a broad participation of regular everyday businesses starting to flourish from deregulation from lower taxes from lower energy more abundant energy and less regulations yeah speaking of energy we&#39;ve heard his comments about how he plans to to lower oil prices which could counter the inflationary effects of tariffs producers though of energy they won&#39;t be happy with that plan how realistic and how effective do you think the this these measures will be well I think he is going to be able to lower it short term I and I think the producers will be okay with it because the demand for energy is going to go up so dramatically with all the demand from AI from from the uh AI investment and data centers and the required energy we&#39;re going to need all the energy that we can possibly get whether it&#39;s natural gas whether it&#39;s oil whether it&#39;s coal whether it&#39;s nuclear whether it&#39;s Renewables uh everything is going to be part of that P in addition to lower energy cost to reduce inflation uh t\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nthat&#39;s the type of economy that we had under Trump 1.0 was a broad participation of regular everyday businesses starting to flourish from deregulation from lower taxes from lower energy more abundant energy and less regulations yeah speaking of energy we&#39;ve heard his comments about how he plans to to lower oil

that the department of government efficiency Doge will maybe not get to trillion of cuts maybe not even get $1 trillion of cuts but if they start to move towards a half of a trillion dollar of cuts it&#39;s going to signal to the market that this Administration is serious about fiscal responsibility and as a result of those actions what you are going to see is the market is going to bring interest rates down versus Trump simply demanding that interest rates go down\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nand when they go they go uh whe it&#39;s the latest ones you know VF Corp is almost is is knocking on the door for a double Comstock is knocking on the door probably be a triple pretty soon uh and that&#39;s just the beginning there&#39;s so much awesome stuff happening uh got to take the long-term view uh Europe wasn&#39;t always such a bargain so it talks about the valuation Gap wide and that closing we&#39;ll talk a little bit about that this week here&#39;s a dollar CH chart people crowded in the most that they&#39;ve been this crowded into Long Dollar uh since you rubber banded back every other time in history let&#39;s get through these charts quickly because we got so much going on this week uh small caps bounced off this uh this trend line uh this is an interesting chart uh before 1992 the average recession was 19 months now it&#39;s eight months so that&#39;s something interesting to show uh going back to 1945 something to keep in mind maybe the FED is more active than they had been uh Price is Right fed&#39;s 50 basis point cut uh this shows 10year yield rolling average annualized returns and you can see when it gets this beaten down you get a move in TLT so I think someone asked on Twitter today do you still think yields are going down 100% uh it&#39;s not going to be because Trump demands that they go down but that this certainly won&#39;t hurt what it&#39;s going to be is Doge starts cutting the market starts to perceive all the things that we discussed on the interviews you can see here sentiment is at the right levels not levels you want to be a seller which we&#39;ve been talking about and we&#39;ve seen now that follow through um uh Commodities long-term return starting to pick up here we&#39;re seeing in natural gas and others small cap stocks need to stay above the 2021 highs uh they&#39;re they&#39;re going to do that I think that&#39;s going to be the big story here we&#39;re already starting to see today was a great example upturn now but flipflops Galore so this is talking about the phase one recoveries that we&#39;ve talked here&#39;s where we are where value small size starts to outperform coming after the uh high quality large size which we saw last year and this is just a normal regular regime you got to know what phase you&#39;re in and take advantage this is uh indicative of that going back to 2021 dividend yield inexpensive versus history we&#39;ve been talking about that for 6 months that is now playing out neglected by managers value versus growth best generational opportunity since uh 2001 and before that 1980 uh history doesn&#39;t rhyme repeat but it does rhyme and that&#39;s what&#39;s happening growth versus value at xco highs well above the uh Tech highs we&#39;ve covered all that and why it&#39;s based in fundamentals is not just looking at charts and saying it has to mean in revert why does it have to mean revert and you can look at the data and the earning earnings deceleration versus acceleration and the policies on the table like we covered with uh um Sarah on CNA so I just like to show this stuff value outperform growth after the last fed cut we&#39;re going to see more of that China City&#39;s home price tracker ticking higher and I&#39;m moving fast because we just got like so many\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nChina&#39;s fourth quarter GDP grows at 5.4% beating Market expectations of stimulus measures kick in now if Qualcomm was to buy them I would take Qualcomm stock at this price that&#39;s for sure uh I would even take tsmc stock potentially at this price um so there are some options where I would take paper and be a holder but not a lot of them China home prices fall at slower Pace we covered that fed may cut rates sooner and faster than expected if inflation keeps cooling key official predicts uh China urges State back funds to buy more stocks amid Market slump falling bond yields buy more stocks we love it cheap not Trump is why European an stocks are spiking this is from uh a very smart and usually pessimistic author named John authors I still follow his stuff because uh he&#39;s data driven chronically pessimistic tilt but I I I love the way he presents it and I learn from uh that Viewpoint and um it&#39;s just part of the Mosaic of information I like to intake uh BFA says benign Trump policies to spark rally in stock laggards this was the that I was looking for we couldn&#39;t agree more just look if passes any prologue we covered all that with um Sarah on CNA Chona China Social Security fund told to buy stocks I mean it doesn&#39;t get any clearer this is what terer was talking about this is what we&#39;ve been talking about they are going to throw the sink kitchen sink at this thing and they are going to juice the market now that they are talking and we&#39;re getting some more clarity on where tariffs are going to Shi out with Trump saying today we already tax them a lot because we already tariff them a lot because of me and he wants Partners to get this Russia War done start rebuilding the Ukraine uh the whole story a lot of money is going to be made rebuilding Ukraine by the way China eases rules for long-term funds to boost stock market exposure China guides mutual funds insurers to invest more in stocks you get the picture make up\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nstock market and sentiment results  kudos to Jeff Adams who helped out with this yesterday did a great job job we covered all the uh media appearances Bank of America fund manager survey top five points most bullish Catalyst for 2025 remains China growth acceleration two managers are dramatically underweight materials and energy three second largest monthly rotation into EU stocks in 25 years four rotation into healthc care and commodi started the year we talked about that before the start of the Year hope you guys were able to take advantage macro Outlook still has plenty of room to improve we agree and Estee louder so we like to cover one or two stocks we&#39;ve talked about previously and uh in many cases have built a position uh Estee louder we&#39;re seeing cash flow start to re accelerate this was a cyclical trough pretty much uh attributable to little bit of mismanagements a lot of China weakness and now that&#39;s all coming back uh their long-term thing they&#39;re going to continue to earn a return on invested Capital well above their weighted average cost of capital which is the the definition of a high quality business and you can see historically they&#39;ve been growing at you know 23 on average over 20% return on invested Capital last two years they got hit that&#39;s going to re accelerate top Line&#39;s going to continue to grow people will pay anything to look good this is the best brand uh this owns Asia and Asia is coming back uh like crazy so you should read through all of his notations here on the Morning Star commentary but when you read it you are going to be really impressed and really interested this will take a little while because it got so destroyed but you know here&#39;s a stock that&#39;s down to whatever it is 70 bucks down from 300 and uh 350 uh at $80 I mean look it could hang around between 50 and 70 for 3 years before going back to 250 who cares but I think this one&#39;s probably going to recover pretty quickly with China and I&#39;m getting a lot more confidence in China where I want to get even more direct and indirect exposure to take advantage of something that happens every you know five six years that people forget these are cyclical things um they beat earnings they improved operational efficiency gross margin improved in the most recent quarter uh they got a new CEO who knows what he&#39;s doing so all these things position it to absolutely catapult the the rebound and China is the name of the game this is a brand that&#39;s been around for you know century plus it&#39;s the best of the best it will continue to be the best of the best and if they see upand comers which is what they do they&#39;re phenomenal Capital allocators they just buy them and tuck them in just like diio best in the business so um gp1s are not going to hurt uh Este louder if anything it&#39;s going to help it the skinnier people get the better they want to look they&#39;re going to be doing makeup like crazy so and all that money they save on food and alcohol they can put put in on their face so uh so we love it uh as I said we close the raise congrats to everyone that came in if you&#39;re still in process you&#39;re still in the game if you have not reached out for the million dooll accounts you&#39;re going to have to wait at least till Q2 5 million plus accounts can come in any time we do bespoke service but for the smaller accounts we want to focus on investing

love going on with her uh we talked two weeks ago and a followup on the conversation we had there how it&#39;s all coming into play here we go got it um all right moments ago we heard president Trump talking about interest rates in the Oval Office after he signed an executive order on crypto This Is Us the first fed meeting of the year it kicks off on Tuesday joining us now great Hill Capitol chairman Tom Hayes to count us down to the closing bell Tom we love having you um what do you make of some of the interest rate conversations that we&#39;ve been having particularly as we gear up for the big fed well you you heard Donald Trump this morning from Davos and thanks for having me Taylor uh saying he wants lower interest rates he wants that debt free financing we know the debt uh interest payments have gone from under a half a trillion to now going to be more than a trillion so he&#39;s going to continue to put pressure he&#39;s going to continue to cut costs with the Doge program so that the market has confidence we&#39;re being fiscally responsible and the market will take care of interest rates over time so I love filling in for Liz Clayman because you are my repeat guest the last time I was on with you you talked about right the last in is now going to be the first out right when you think about the performers in this market are you starting to see that play out yeah there&#39;s no question and I enjoyed being on with you a couple weeks ago I said the last shall be first and what are we seeing today we&#39;re seeing materials we&#39;re seeing health care we&#39;re seeing Industrials start to outperform and the reason is simple business friendly friendly environment cut taxes uh great environment for these type of businesses moving forward and price is what you pay value is what you get so we came into the year with the mag 7 having decelerating earnings growth uh uh for a high multiple decelerating to 21% earnings growth for 33 times versus the rest of the market at a much lower multiple and money is finding its way into the Great Value there I know but so we only have 30 seconds left I&#39;m looking at Boeing on your list it takes a lot of crossing your fingers to bet on Boeing right now or you&#39;re happy well the big thing is with turnarounds the key is solvency risk and Kelly ortberg took care of that by raising $20 billion of cash they still have a duopoly they still have a half a trillion dollar backlog so we like Boeing we like that story and Trump has said he wants the rest of the world spending massively on defense spending Boeing is going to be a beneficiary we like that story continuing Thomas Hayes thank you so much penny for your thoughts as well so let&#39;s take a look at this we&#39;re firmly in record territory the S&P and we&#39;re back uh on to the next this was a special segment I I did uh on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange when I was in town with Jared blicker and Sydney freed also want to thank Taylor choia Smith for putting this together this is a new uh podcast that they have which gets syndicated everywhere and this was an amazing go anywhere podcast that we covered uh China Baba everything you could possibly imagine Advanced Auto Parts turnarounds how we think about turnaround so I wanted to get this one early in the podcast this week so listen and [Music] here welcome to stocks and translation broadcasting from the New York Stock Exchange the heart of global Capital markets I&#39;m Jared blicker and at my side is the people&#39;s voice Sydney freed first please like subscribe and comment on stocks and translation on Spotify Apple music Amazon or YouTube guess what guys today we are welcoming Tom Hayes he is a chairman of great Hill Capital hello guys and today we are going to be talking about guess what we got Warren Buffett we got David teer talking about value and macro and no spoiler alert we&#39;ve got them in a finale you do not want to miss our word of the day or phrase of the day is vssd stands for volatility spreads and duration how the pros use these terms to read the bond market tea leaves and this episode is brought to you by the number 21% that is how much The Magnificent Seven profits are expected to grow this year which happens to be exactly the same for the S&P 600 that&#39;s small caps it&#39;s a 2025 Davy Goliath Market Showdown but we before we get to some of the more jargon busting uh parts of this show Tom why don&#39;t you just give us your big picture overview of where we are in the markets right now yeah I think uh for 2025 we can expect a good good year however not quite as good as 2024 uh we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of looking at high single digits to low double digits but I think the real story is going to be the rotation what is going to drive those gains and what is holding back bigger gains and that that has to do with rotation that we&#39;re going to talk about all right great so you are a value investor we want to start with another VW vstd which really doesn&#39;t have a lot to do with value but we&#39;re going to talk about it anyway we got volatility spread and duration so taking them one at a time volatility it measures price swings and then spreads that shows the difference in in yields between two different bonds so how far apart they are and then we have duration which measures how sensitive a bond is to changes in interest rates so if the FED raises or lowers rates how does that Bond react to it and I&#39;m just wondering how you use this information to judge what&#39;s happening right now because we&#39;ve seen huge rises in the tenure t-note yield which has been pressuring R risk markets you know it&#39;s interesting uh what we&#39;re seeing in the last few weeks is exactly what we saw after Trump 1.0 after the election before the inauguration and what what basically happened in 2016 he ran on being tariff man and the king of debt so what did the markets do as soon as he was elected dollar rallied yields blew out uh emerging markets and international stocks sold off and then after the inauguration what&#39;s surprising to most people that they forget is that bonds actually rallied yields compressed the dollar came down and and international stocks did exceptionally well China had one of its best years ever in 200 17 after the inauguration so I think there&#39;s a lot of bark to the\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI&#39;m looking at Boeing on your list it takes a lot of crossing your fingers to bet on Boeing right now or you&#39;re happy well

the westpack business paid down debt and now he&#39;s closing the unprofitable non-performing stores on the west coast and part of the reason they&#39;re not performing is because they are spread out so you don&#39;t get economies a scale with the distribution hubs so he&#39;s shutting that down that&#39;s 10% of stores uh he is expanding stores in the in the markets on in the Northeast and on the East Coast where he&#39;s number one and two consolidating the distribution centers here&#39;s all you need to know his Target for 2027 is $630 million in operating income they&#39;ve done that four times before uh 2018 2019 and two other years every single time that they hit that marker the stock traded between $180 and $220 a share it&#39;s a $45 stock right now you can&#39;t give it away maybe three times appreciation ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI love that you have specific investment picks like this how do you go about stock picking because you&#39;ve been on our err many times screener yeah and and you you always have like an interesting ideas and specific ideas how does an average person get specific ideas as opposed to just investing in ETFs yeah I think uh one it comes from experience two I&#39;ll give you the advice that Warren Buffett gives everyone which is read the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and once you can understand that the price that you see on your screen can sometimes deviate and sometimes deviate materially from the underlying fundamentals of the business that&#39;s when you that you read that book and one of two things is going to happen one it puts you to sleep find another career there are many ways to make money many paths to the top of the mountain number two the light bulb goes off and it changes your life that&#39;s what happened to me and every day like Buffett talks about I skip to work because it&#39;s like a treasure hunt uh there is  nowhere else in the world other than public markets where the price can get so dislocated from the underlying value either due to force selling structural selling over emotion you know for some of the prices that I pay for business it&#39;s like if I went into Advanced Auto Parts board today and I said I&#39;ll take out the entire company JP Morgan&#39;s going to finance me on the debt side I&#39;ll put up some of the equity I&#39;ll raise some Equity we&#39;ll buy the entire company at $45 a share I can guarantee you they would call security and have me escorted out of the building because they think I&#39;m absolutely Al Looney to never in a million years would they sell their business at $45 a share so um so those are the opportunities and that&#39;s actually one of my filters is would the board have me ask Ed out if I offer to buy the entire business at the price that was quoted in the market and uh and if the and if the answer is no they would take the meeting then that&#39;s probably not the stock for me Tom speaking of value here value um has actually been the dominant probably Factor if you want to call that in the market going back a hundred years but not this Century it&#39;s really only come in a few places comeing to vogan a few places and we&#39;ve I&#39;ve sat with a lot of guests and they&#39;ve said that low perpetually low interest rates that we&#39;ve seen this Century kind of killed off the macro trade that you know you&#39;re used to these boom bus Cycles but it&#39;s changed the game it did change the game so much and only now are we normalizing so is this\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthe time for Value yeah we we ring the bell on this show uh look value is the cheapest relative to growth since 1980 number one since 200000 number two both of those years were generational buy opportunities to buy if you remember the covers in 1999 2000 Warren Buffett has lost his touch that was the headlin except he was using that opportunity while everyone was buying Cisco and Global Crossing and Enron he was buying value stocks and he had dramatically outperformed 2,000 2001 2002 2003 2004 20056 you get the point and if you look back through history we get blinded as investors by recency bias and recency bias tells you since 2010 growth has kicked Val&#39;s butt okay and there&#39;s no two ways about it since 1927 value has outperformed growth not by a little by 45% per year every single year including the last 15 years not compounding that&#39;s it yeah yes if you believe we&#39;re normalizing interest rates and you don&#39;t have exposure to the 493 or or some level of value I think you&#39;re going to find yourself left in your dust I&#39;m not saying shift your portfolio overnight and go all value because we don&#39;t know no one can predict the future but what I am saying is if you can buy a high quality business at a reasonable price right now you want to start to do that in a normalizing environment and that&#39;s exactly what we&#39;re doing would you would you do that with an ETF like buy V or some value ETF or are you stock picking are you do you really need to find the winners and avoid the losers there yeah I think I think you run into if you wind up in a basket you know there&#39;s the term value traps so the turnarounds I look for it&#39;s not just like it&#39;s cheap because you can get stuck in cheap for long time I&#39;m looking for catalysts of change in many cases it&#39;s the new CEO okay so for instance we were just joking you like Vans I have three we have we have three pairs of the same see now that&#39;s not going to happen I had to endure this conversation already so so look let me tell you about vans so Vans I went on uh a network last year the stock was trading at 13 or $14 down from $83 and the host looked at me like I had two heads I said look I&#39;m betting on Brack and Daryl this guy was at Logitech back in 2013 when the stock was down 82% okay here&#39;s what happened over the next decade if you invested it was less than a decade if you invested $1 million when Bracken took the Helm of Logitech you made $26 million 26 bagger talk about turn around and this is not you know they weren&#39;t curing cancer these are commoditized camera and mice and keyboards which you could get anywhere else but somehow this guy figured out how to Brand Logitech to The Gamers and the game was on he&#39;s doing the exact same thing and not only does VF Corp own Vans which has struggled by the way it peaked during covid everyone bought Vans for three years ago they&#39;ve got three three there&#39;s there&#39;s a surfing Vibe early on in the pandemic didn&#39;t pan out exactly didn&#39;t didn&#39;t pan out so they&#39;ve worked through that so now they they&#39;ve gone through the dstock cycle they&#39;re going to the restock cycle but by the way they own Northface which did just did a collaboration with Kim Kardashian on skims they sold out within a matter of days the young kids are wearing the new school where the where the wave thing pops out from the side side of the thing so he&#39;s changing the game they&#39;re they&#39;re selling out you couldn&#39;t even get them in Christmas because they were selling out then he owns North he owns North Face he owns uh Timberland Dickies so he&#39;s got a portfolio he sold off Supreme to do what same thing that you saw with Shane o Kelly take solvency risk off the table that is number one in a turnaround story sold Supreme for $1.5 billion dollars paid down the debt now they&#39;ve got the runway to turnaround Vans uh uh Northface is doing great as Asia comes back it&#39;ll do even better Timberland Dickies you name it you got it I mean Bracken is a winner and he&#39;s gonna he&#39;s going to turn this thing around so the stock is now up from 1314 to 2122 down from 80 I think this can double again over the next couple of years hold that thought we need to take a short break but coming up we&#39;ve got a DAV and Goliath showdown between the mag seven and small caps then another Showdown on the runway featuring two iconic hedge fund Le Legends it is Buffett versus teer coming up all right we are back and this episode is brought to you by the number 21% that is the expected growth in earnings per share or profits of the mag 7 this year and it&#39;s also the expected EPS growth for the S&P 600 which covers small caps the key difference is what we call the multiple or how much you need to multiply the stock price to get to that number so the multiple on the mag 7 is 33 the multiple on the S&P 600 that small cap index is half of that basically 16 tell us about how you use this information yeah this is huge so when I&#39;m allocating this year I want to find special and unique situations in small cap why because I get the same growth for half the multiple price is what you pay value is what you get and the second Auto stock that I wanted to talk about is a small cap in particular it&#39;s called Cooper standard this stock is down not 80% this stock is down 90% okay same thing that happened they took solvency risk off the table they refinanced the debt all this is is a play on increasing volumes and if you remember from December volumes came in it surprised everyone 16.8 million annualized what you&#39;ve seen over the last 45 years is North American sell through sa uh it it it Peaks and troughs between 15.3 million to 17.1 the last time you had a peak was 2017 at 177.1 this company earned $7 a share and traded at $146 we started buying it at five and change it&#39;s now up to 13 and change um we believe that the next time we hit 17 million in volumes they&#39;re not only going to earn $7 they&#39;re going to earn $10 a share because they&#39;ve taken $400 million a cost out so these are the special unique situations in small caps where you can get involved uh you can take a risk you&#39;re not going to put your whole portfolio in a small cap stock you want to be careful and you you want to have a a portfolio 10 15 20 stocks you know the less confidence you have the more Diversified you need to be um the more you know buff buffet and Monger used to always say uh divers diversification is a hedge against not knowing what you&#39;re doing or some would call that inconfidence but yeah bigger picture do you have like a percentage breakdown you recommend for growth and value and large cap and small cap for people to be invested in yeah that&#39;s you know that&#39;s going to depend on their unique goals uh that&#39;s something that they definitely want to talk to a financial adviser because at different ages you want to have different levels of risk I deal exclusively with family offices and ultra high net worth accredited and qualified investors so um so that&#39;s really going to depend where you&#39;re at I think for a lot of people what makes sense is to passively index the bulk of their money and then if they have a small bucket where they want to start to learn and start to experience and start to experiment they&#39;re doing it with a very small and as they grow confidence and grow experience and grow knowledge then they can expand that bucket over time we but we&#39;ve had a number of people guess on this show that have told Sid and looked Us in the eye and said well you&#39;re young well they looked Sid in the eye not me said you&#39;re young uh you don&#39;t need the you don&#39;t need the rest of the S&P 500 you just need the NASDAQ you need some of the growth year stocks you don&#39;t need bonds what would you say to that yeah they said that in late 90s also I mean look I don&#39;t think this is the late 990s I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect a tech rack I do expect consolidation of some of these gains and some reating of the multiples um you know Sydney probably has to speak to her financial advisor about that uh I thought you were advising me right now but if you if you were my sister I&#39;d put you in a good good a few good companies and then I&#39;d probably have you indexing the rest so you slept well at night and you were comfortable with that uh and then over time you you could build up as the profits and as your account grew and uh as you got more comfortable with with that what about small caps though are those for and as the the group would you trade the Russell or the S&P 600 or you&#39;re just looking for individual yeah I mean we only you know we run a very concentrated book of 8 to 12 stocks uh is our portfolio different ball game for you different ball game uh I would say though that um I would start to ease into an uh a small cap index do it small if you&#39;re like 90% in like a 6040 portfolio maybe you maybe you put 5 10% into small caps and start to lean in that way the other thing you can do some people index with uh the S&P 500 there&#39;s a Vanguard ETF vti which is a more is a broader number of companies that you&#39;ll catch some of the small caps in that it&#39;s another way to index but with more exposure less concentration to the mag 7 that&#39;s another thing to think about as well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new S&P 500 ETF that will not weight any stock more than 3% so it&#39;s not quite equal weight it&#39;s not just all kinds of interesting products coming out like that uh if you don&#39;t have anything I I have one thing about diversification I&#39;ve asked but if you&#39;re if you have a long rway is there something valid to just like putting a little bit of money in every S&P sector is that is that this is a recurring thought like how can I get it all catch them all because people say diversification I&#39;m like what does that really mean like stocks bonds sure but like a little bit of money sounds like a good excuse for not knowing what you&#39;re talking exactly well I think um you&#39;re getting that effectively through the S&P 500 so if you you know if you if you look at uh the spider sector ETFs and then you look at the Holdings of each of them you&#39;re going to see like the top 10 Holdings are S&P component so effectively by doing that what that would change is your weighting so if you went equal weight by sector but that means you&#39;re going to have equal weight materials against equal weight uh Tech which by the way is not a horrible idea for 2025 I&#39;ll tell you why yes please do uh the two worst performing among the worst performing sectors were Healthcare and materials had low singled digigit returns in 2025 relative to the S&P over 20 20% here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen in 2025 they have among the highest expected earnings growth Healthcare is going to grow earnings 20.4% which is more than the S&P 500 of 13 14% And materials is going to grow earnings 17.4% so as a catch-up trade that becomes very very interesting I have a materials name if you&#39;re interested but otherwise we might get to that in a second here first we got to get to today&#39;s who wore it better we have two iconic investing investing Legends marching down the red carpet it is on one side the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett himself squaring off against the ma master of macro David teer Buffett the steadfast value investor who build his Empire on patience discipline and the occasional cigar butt strategy he is the epitome of Jesse livermore&#39;s buy it right and sit tight strategy on the other side you&#39;ve got teer a guy who just doesn&#39;t play the markets he moves them with just a few words on financial TV he stared down the global financial crisis and famously said load up the truck so in this battle of investing icons who wears the market better is it Buffett&#39;s Timeless value Playbook that shines in high rate environments or teers all weather Global macro tool kit ready to pounce on any opportunity here all right long-term Buffet hands down near-term Tepper I&#39;ll tell you why teer sure this is people are going to tune out when I say this uh I hope not it&#39;s certainly going to be controversial so keer went on TV a few months ago talking about China and and people vomited all over their desks once they heard that okay his number one position is Alibaba right now look I&#39;ve been wrong about Alibaba for over a year we just keep buying it and buying it and buying it because price is what you pay value is what you get it&#39;s the lowest amount of price for the greatest amount of value right now in the international market so if you think that there&#39;s more bark to Trump than bite and he wants to do a deal with China like we saw after the election in 2000 after the inauguration in 2017 when Alibaba went from $85 not coincidentally where it is right now to $187 in 11 months you might want to take a look at that there&#39;s something that has been happening in China for the last year year and a half is that they&#39;ve been doing this peac mail stimulus over and over and over and over very peacemeal but it&#39;s all building up and when it happens it&#39;s going to be uh very quickly and Alibaba is the tollkeeper it&#39;s the Tollgate for the middle class when they start spending they get a piece of all the action they&#39;ve got uh of all the AI startups if you want to play a China AI ETF it&#39;s called Alibaba why because every single a they are a seed fund every single AI startup goes to Alibaba and says we need Cloud we need uh AI tools we need all of this stuff and they say it&#39;s free just give us Equity we we&#39;ve got Equity as owners of Alibaba in pretty much every AI startup in China this is huge and and it&#39;s has zero value oh by the way they generate $25 billion of free cash flow every year oh by the way they&#39;re sitting on $ 55 billion of cash not a bad runway for a turnaround situation uh they can also lock up jackma at any time so t\n\nere all right long-term Buffet hands down near-term Tepper I&#39;ll tell you why teer sure this is people are going to tune out when I say this uh I hope not it&#39;s certainly going to be controversial so keer went on TV a few months ago talking about China and and people vomited all over their desks once they heard that okay his number one position is Alibaba right now look I&#39;ve been wrong about Alibaba for over a year we just keep buying it and buying it and buying it because price is what you pay value is what you get it&#39;s the lowest amount of price for the greatest amount of value right now in the international market so if you think that there&#39;s more bark to Trump than bite and he wants to do a deal with China like we saw after the election in 2000 after the inauguration in 2017 when Alibaba went from $85 not coincidentally where it is right now to $187 in 11 months you might want to take a look at that there&#39;s something that has been happening in China for the last year year and a half is that they&#39;ve been doing this peac mail stimulus over and over and over and over very peacemeal but it&#39;s all building up and when it happens it&#39;s going to be uh very quickly and Alibaba is the tollkeeper it&#39;s the Tollgate for the middle class when they start spending they get a piece of all the action they&#39;ve got uh of all the AI startups if you want to play a China AI ETF it&#39;s called Alibaba why because every single a they are a seed fund every single AI startup goes to Alibaba and says we need Cloud we need uh AI tools we need all of this stuff and they say it&#39;s free just give us Equity we we&#39;ve got Equity as owners of Alibaba in pretty much every AI startup in China this is huge and and it&#39;s has zero value oh by the way they generate $25 billion of free cash flow every year oh by the way they&#39;re sitting on $ 55 billion of cash not a bad runway for a turnaround situation uh they can also lock up jackma at any time so t\nhere is  risk there yeah well good news is he&#39;s out of the picture so lock lock him away uh I would say that um if China turns this thing is going it and I wouldn&#39;t even say if because this is actually what it looks like I know I don&#39;t have a lot of gray hairs but I but I&#39;ve been around and Jared knows I&#39;ve seen these cycles and and the last time China was this despondent was uh that would it happens every few years 2016 okay uh then you had 2009 then you had 2 2001 as the as the money moved out of US tech it moved into China Tech so look it&#39;s not a popular one it&#39;s why we own more than one stock okay you you can&#39;t be certain about anything but when it moves it&#39;s not going to be a little move it&#39;s going to be a big move and it&#39;s not going to let anyone in and I just don&#39;t know when that is I think it&#39;s imminent teer thinks it&#39;s imminent but no one knows Tom we&#39;re racing to the finish here what is your number one investment tip for 2025 I think that what you want to do is lighten up a little bit on mag 7 if you&#39;re overweight and if you&#39;re in indices whether you like it or not you&#39;re overweight some 40% index waiting uh is the mag 7 I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s trading at a little premium you know I joke Jensen Wong may be flying a little bit too close to the Sun like Icarus the good news is his wings haven&#39;t started to melt yet but at 51 times earning 30 times sales decelerating growth still great growth but decelerating it you know having been through many semiconductor Cycles The Narrative is the same competition is coming right now the wings are fine because there&#39;s no competition competition will come all right we got to leave it there Tom I&#39;m thinking about becoming a value investor when I grow up but for now we got to wind things down here at stocks and translation be sure to check out all our other episodes on the Yahoo finance

pleasure to join the great David Lynn who has one of the most vibrant active audiences you could imagine you go on his show your phone rings like crazy because he&#39;s so good at asking\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nand digging deep so we&#39;re listening here the purchasers of these technologies will be required by their investors to get a return on investment so they either lower the spend and risk seeding market share to their competition or they get more compute power per dollar of spend competition catches up and it&#39;s a race to the bottom for margins and this time will be no different well the selloff in January continue well after the inauguration we&#39;ll find out with Thomas Hayes managing member of great Hill Capital he also break down his sector allocation preferences and uh value versus growth an interesting theme for 2025 Thomas welcome back to the show happy new year thanks for having me David let&#39;s take a look at my screen right now this is the S&amp;P 500 ever since uh basically the uh top in December it&#39;s down roughly um 5% or so is this just a seasonal pullback that we&#39;re seeing or is uncertainty around the Trump Administration starting to pile up here yeah I think uh it&#39;s not dissimilar to the volatility we saw after the election in 2016 Trump 1.0 through the inauguration 2017 and then things kind of normalized I think what&#39;s got people sideways is yields blowing out 10-year yield accelerating first you had uh the FED uncertainty in December and then you had that super strong jobs report which uh worried the market that maybe we&#39;re not going to get the two cuts that the FED projected in their uh SCP and instead uh now we&#39;re at only 70% of one cut by October and the market is adjusting to that and and if you look at the general indices uh it&#39;s almost misleading you know you had Industrials small caps down almost 10% it was pretty violent interruption in December you you had seen a trend of regular broadening healthy broadening since July of last year and then uh as we got through the election and into that fed issue in December uh really an Abrupt pause in that in that broadening theme and I I do think we&#39;re going to resume that for a number of reasons we can cover today the 10e yield is that a signal of strength in the economy or expectations for further strength in the economy or simply that the inflation expectations are being pushed out higher uh which may or may not be good for equities it depends who you talk to I mean you know if you look at the University of Michigan uh uh inflation expectations jumped up a little bit uh last week both on the one-year and threeyear uh expectation to 3.3% that is embedded in the consumers expectation of tariffs increasing prices now you have seen the administration leak a couple of things number one maybe it&#39;ll be targeted to certain industries or subsets and number two it might be gradual we&#39;ve been of the camp it won&#39;t be as bad as advertised I think the advertisement was 60% tariffs across the board uh I think that&#39;s going to be more more modest and more reasonable like we saw in Trump 1.0 uh then on the flip side you do have uh the fact that the economy is growing you know you&#39;re you&#39;re gonna have mid teens earnings growth so uh there&#39;s a view that yields are expanding due to that and then there&#39;s a third Viewpoint that you got to issue9 trillion of debt to refinance in 2025 so that uh yields are blowing out in excess but what I will say is I&#39;m more of the camp that this is exactly what happened between the election and the inauguration in 2016 to 2017 Trump ran as the king of debt uh the king of the Tariff King uh he&#39;s run on the exact same platform in uh 2024 and the market is trying to digest to what extent will he be the king of these two initiatives uh and uh we&#39;re taking the under the market right now is taking the over I think the market is overestimating because as you saw in 2016 to 2007 17 while the dollar rallied after the November election and bonds yields uh really accelerated after the election after the inauguration bonds got bid yields compressed for the next year plus the dollar rolled over International stocks took off biotech stocks took off oil stocks collapsed uh so it was the exact opposite of what everyone was expecting and we think it could be some version of that rhyming not repeating yes and as a hedge fund manager are you positioned for more of a pullback right now or is it still risk on for you generally speaking uh we run a concentrated Equity portfolio that has a very low correlation to the S&amp;P 500 weights so the businesses we buy we we enter we do a lot of turnarounds and we&#39;re buying at a point in time where we feel the margin of safety is Extreme meaning that if the business was liquidated tomorrow we would make a profit if the turnaround plan plays we make a double or triple over a few years and and in some cases multibagger uh so we&#39;re less concerned with what the Market&#39;s doing on a day-to-day basis if the market pulled back 20% % uh in the next couple months it wouldn&#39;t change one view on any of the eight or 12 core positions in the portfolio uh and uh and and very likely if the indices pulled back which we don&#39;t anticipate anything of that magnitude but if they pulled back materially what that would tell me more likely is that the rotation that we&#39;ve been talking about is playing out because the indices pulling back is is evidence of the mag 7 predominantly getting hit because of the weights in the index and uh and and we&#39;re going to make our money in the 493 and international prospectively which would be less impacted by the overall uh Market liquidation Thomas you talked about some sectors uh that surprised uh some investors were would surprise some investors during a trump 2.0 so let&#39;s talk about um some of these so we actually discuss this in detail when Trump won the election link down below Thomas was on one of my first guests after uh November 7th um in particular energy is interesting um the oil price right now is moving up a lot higher now some of it had to do with um sanctions on Russia but perhaps expectations are that uh Trump is actually going to follow through on some of his promises what what do you think is going on in the energy sector right now yeah we have exposure to the energy sector to a company called Comstock resources uh Jerry Jones who owns the Cowboys owns about 66% of the stock at around $710 our basis is about a buck higher it&#39;s now trading around 20 we believe uh the intrinsic value of it both proved uh reserves pv10 that they have to report to the S&amp;P 500 around 20 30 bucks uh per share and then unproved we think is another $20 so we we don&#39;t really worry about the day-to-day vacillations in natural gas or in um or in in oil prices I would say that sentiment got so pessimistic on oil uh and oil stocks in December that uh it it was clear that we would get some some level of Bounce the problem with the integrated and even some of the servicers is that when we get involved in a in a business we we are looking for a meaningful irr over a few years 30% plus and I just didn&#39;t find the risk reward despite low quote unquote pees uh and high dividends and buying back shares Etc I just didn&#39;t find the asymmetry in the uh General oil and gas space that I did during 2020 when we were buying it hand over fist when oil turned negative uh that&#39;s when I like to get involved so for now our exposure is limited if you put a gun to my head and said how are you going to take advantage of the increased Drilling and the and the uh energy favorable policies from the Trump Administration I&#39;d be inclined to being servicers potentially like a Slumber J or something like that we have no position there but if we do expand our energy exposure Beyond Comstock that is where we would be looking and it would not surprise us at all if we see some follow through both in the sector because that&#39;s a component of value which we think is going to have a better year than than it did last year uh and um uh and some of the initiatives as far as the consolidation in the industry deals happening in the industry Etc it&#39;s just we&#39;re we&#39;re not getting enough juice for squeeze so we&#39;re looking elsewhere where we can get a lot of juice and uh how are you eyeing the tech sector now that Trump has probably signaled a doubling down of tariffs in the trade War globally is a tech sector at risk from tariffs and just more protectionism overall I think that as we look at the mag 7 which is an overweight in the indices so you are over dramatically overweight Tech if you own the S&amp;P 500 passively uh and atically overweight if if you&#39;re chasing the nvidias and uh and and the Googles and Etc the thing that our view is the the outperformance of the mag 7 last year was somewhat justified by the earnings power of the mag 7 last year so it&#39;s okay to have a 33 times multiple when you have 33% earnings growth the the problem going into this year is that earnings growth is going to decelerate for the mag 7 from 33% down to it was 21% as of a few days ago now I&#39;ve seen numbers down to 18% so your your earnings growth is going to almost have but the multiple is still at 33 time so that the multiple is still high it has not yet derated so that&#39;s not where I want to be where I want to be is

    "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n why don&#39;t you just give us your big picture overview of where we are in the markets right now yeah I think uh for 2025 we can expect a good good year however not quite as good as 2024 uh we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of looking at high single digits to low double digits but I think the real story is going to be the rotation what is going to drive those gains and what is holding back bigger gains and that that has to do with rotation that we&#39;re going to talk about all right great so you are a value investor we want to start with another VW vstd which really doesn&#39;t have a lot to do with value but we&#39;re going to talk about it anyway we got volatility spread and duration so taking them one at a time volatility it measures price swings and then spreads that shows the difference in in yields between two different bonds so how far apart they are and then we have duration which measures how sensitive a bond is to changes in interest rates so if the FED raises or lowers rates how does that Bond react to it and I&#39;m just wondering how you use this information to judge what&#39;s happening right now because we&#39;ve seen huge rises in the tenure t-note yield which has been pressuring R risk markets you know it&#39;s interesting uh what we&#39;re seeing in the last few weeks is exactly what we saw after Trump 1.0 after the election before the inauguration and what what basically happened in 2016 he ran on being tariff man and the king of debt so what did the markets do as soon as he was elected dollar rallied yields blew out uh emerging markets and international stocks sold off and then after the inauguration what&#39;s surprising to most people that they forget is that bonds actually rallied yields compressed the dollar came down and and international stocks did exceptionally well China had one of its best years ever in 200 17 after the inauguration so I think there&#39;s a lot of bark to the headlines  but but more modest bite because that bark is used as negotiation tactic and I think we&#39;re going to see uh a period in 2025 that&#39;s similar to 2017 in that how people are positioned today before the inauguration uh is probably a little bit off sides to how the year is going to go and H you want to go ahead how do you how do you see this playing out though so you&#39;re a value investor tell us like how you see this playing out sector-wise or style-wise yeah I think in terms of sectors uh what drove the boat late last year was The Magnificent 7 and what you saw with the Magnificent 7 was they had meaningful earnings growth 33% earnings growth last year uh that is actually decelerating in 2025 it&#39;s crazy to thing but it&#39;s decelerating down to 211% but the difference is the multiple has remained elevated so the multiple has has not been derated with the earnings growth uh conversely you look at something like small caps had anemic earnings growth the small cap 600 which is the more profitable index uh is going to grow from 8% earnings growth to 21% earnings growth but rather than paying 33 times you&#39;re paying 16 times so I think you&#39;re going to find the real opportunity in the unmagnify in international in small caps and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to see more subdued index returns uh of 8 to 12% because uh mag 7 is such a heavy weight and if they don&#39;t outperform the indices aren&#39;t going to go very far so what are some of your investment ideas that aren&#39;t mag s that are more 593 sorry 4993 I gave more uh Wells you want to do some audit uh Auto stocks you you ready to go to sleep now these These are exciting stocks uh I&#39;ve got one on the retail side and one on the wholesale side so the one on the retail side is called Advan Auto Parts uh this stock is down 80% and why because it was manag they overexpanded everyone knows Advance Auto you know they see it in their local area if they don&#39;t see O&#39;Reilly if they don&#39;t see auto can hear the I can hear the jingle yes yeah exactly so uh effectively Shane o Kelly came in he ran HD Supply for Home Depot a$7 billion business Harvard MBA West Point serious guy came in about a year ago to turn the thing around after they destroyed it uh what he did immediately was he took solvency risk off the table how did he do that he sold the Canada business raised one .5 billion of cash the westpack business paid down debt and now he&#39;s closing the unprofitable non-performing stores on the west coast and part of the reason they&#39;re not performing is because they are spread out so you don&#39;t get economies a scale with the distribution hubs so he&#39;s shutting that down that&#39;s 10% of stores uh he is expanding stores in the in the markets on in the Northeast and on the East Coast where he&#39;s number one and two consolidating the distribution centers here&#39;s all you need to know his Target for 2027 is $630 million in operating income they&#39;ve done that four times before uh 2018 2019 and two other years every single time that they hit that marker the stock traded between $180 and $220 a share it&#39;s a $45 stock right now you can&#39;t give it away maybe three times appreciation I love that you have specific investment picks like this how do you go about stock picking because you&#39;ve been on our err many times screener yeah and and you you always have like an interesting ideas and specific ideas how does an average person get specific ideas as opposed to just investing in ETFs yeah I think uh one it comes from experience two I&#39;ll give you the advice that Warren Buffett gives everyone which is read the intelligent investor by Ben Graham and once you can understand that the price that you see on your screen can sometimes deviate and sometimes deviate materially from the underlying fundamentals of the business that&#39;s when you that you read that book and one of two things is going to happen one it puts you to sleep find another career there are many ways to make money many paths to the top of the mountain number two the light bulb goes off and it changes your life that&#39;s what happened to me and every day like Buffett talks about I skip to work because it&#39;s like a treasure hunt uh t\n\nthe earnings growth accelerating and the multiple has not rated to the upside one of those areas for sure is small caps uh you&#39;re going to see in the small cap 600 index earnings growth uh grow from 8% to 21% but you&#39;re only paying 16 times so half the multiple as the mag 7 for the same or slightly more earnings growth if you look at the Russell 2000 which has more non-profitable companies turning profitable that earnings growth I&#39;ve seen uh some estimates to be 50% this year so I think that&#39;s an area the other theme that we&#39;re looking at here David is the last shall be first right along the theme of the earnings growth relative to Value two of the worst performing sectors last year because they had among the worst performing earnings growth were health care and materials this year that is going to flip on its head because the healthc care is expected to grow earnings 20.4% which is meaningfully more than the S&amp;P at you know 14 15% and material is going to grow earnings at 17.4% so we like opportunities in those two beaten down sectors as well speaking of valuations here&#39;s a note from uh Goldman Sachs uh their strateg just put out a note on Monday um is reported by CNBC US stocks are expensive but uh GS says investors should keep buying them the US Stock Market is trading at eye watering valuation says his article after two straight big gear for the S&amp;P 500 but that&#39;s not good enough a good enough reason to back away from domestic companies uh the 2025 outlook for the unit be leased on Monday included a model portfolio for mod risk investors that recommended staying overweight us equities while trimming exposure to foreign stocks is that uh something that a view that you share okay so Goldman&#39;s 2024 Outlook was the most pessimistic on the street their Target price for end of year was 5,400 um you know the S&amp;P wound up well over 6,000 and at one point in the year was at 6,300 uh so they got it wrong they were the most wrong on the street now prospectively when value stocks speaking of prices what you pay value is what you get uh International uh is going to have 13 14% earnings growth that&#39;s xus uh compared to the us about 14% earnings growth the difference is US you&#39;re paying 22 times uh International you&#39;re paying 15 to 15 and a half times I think uh now more than ever just like the first year 2017 when Trump was elected when everyone thought you had to be all us International and Emerging Markets actually outperformed after the dollar rolled over after the inauguration so I would take the exact opposite of this note from Goldman Sachs this year just as taking the exact opposite of their note last year was the right call as well and it does and it does beg the question as to where Capital flows will head now that the bank of Japan in particular um is on a path of potentially raising rates while everybody else is cutting rates if not pausing yeah you by the way this is the most important thing to be watching in 2025 we got a preview of coming attractions in early August as the bank of Japan is forced to continue to raise rates and the Japanese Bond Yi jgb yields blow out uh what you&#39;re going to see is an unwind of the carry trade and the carry trade that free money trade that has been concentrated in quote unquote us except exceptionalism but predominantly mag 7 stocks is going to abruptly unwind because as that liquidity dries up it&#39;s coming out of where it&#39;s been placed and that has been in the mag 7 they&#39;ve not been buying you know small cap autoart wholesalers they&#39;ve not been buying uh Stanley Black and&amp; Decker tool makers uh they&#39;ve not been buying Baxter International medical device companies they&#39;ve been buying uh in via they&#39;ve been buying palent here they&#39;ve been buying all of those things which I think are are going to take a breather and by the way I&#39;m not saying short Tech this is 2,000 at all I&#39;m saying that they there&#39;s going to be a rting in multiples which will cause the performance of that basket to do less well than it did last year I.E low single to high single digits whereas uh bigger money can be made in in value uh across the board and and we can talk a little bit about the history of value versus growth and why growth uh people seem focused on due to recency buys if if you&#39;d like to to move move there well wait a minute is Apple still a growth stock didto Microsoft and well look I mean the the story with Apple has been multiple expansion right so historically it had traded at a 14 times multiple on 78% earnings growth or actually higher earnings growth back then and then it decelerated earnings growth to low to mid single digits which is where it is now and the multiple expanded into the 20s so uh you tell me whether that makes sense now the Bulls argument would be that uh Services Revenue increase and services profitability increased therefore it&#39;s it&#39;s uh deserving of such a higher multiple but at the end of the day if you have decelerating earnings growth an accelerating multiple expansion it&#39;s a formula for uh not bu you know not great things happening moving forward so I I would just say that uh we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have a view that the multiple has to go back to 14 times by any stretch of the imagination but we do have a view that some of the gains that have been fostered through multiple expansion versus earnings growth expansion should consolidate the gains for some time to digest the price growth relative to fundamental business growth that has occurred in the last two years okay so the main drivers of uh Tech earnings then going forward in 2025 in particular uh do you think it&#39;s still coming from AI do you think that that theme has sailed what&#39;s your take The Narrative of AI and the expectation of AI transforming lives is correct just like The Narrative of Amazon on changing the world in 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002 was correct the problem was in that first part of the ShakeOut even though everyone was right about the story in 2000 it took 10 to 15 years to deliver the result I.E I press a button on my phone and you know here in California in sometimes the same day it shows up at my my front steps sometimes it takes a whole day to do it so all of that stuff happened the problem was you were paying as if it already happened in 2000 when it would take 15 more years to deliver which is why you saw in 2000 to 2002 the greatest company in the world Amazon down 90% in price despite the fundamentals of the business continuing to improve in each of those years 2000 2001 2002 2003 while the price was crashing the fundamentals were improving because you had simply paid too much for what was to come 10 to 15 years later as if it had already come 15 years earlier yeah so then bottom line sector over sorry please so so as it relates to AI um you know I made a joke Jensen Wong is is flying the good news is the bad news is Jensen Wong is flying too close to the Sun the good news is his wings aren&#39;t melting yet I mean you have a company that is trading at uh uh you know 30 30 times sales 40 50 times earnings and if you look at capex spand from from the mag 7 it&#39;s going to decelerate this year as it relates to AI because investors are demanding a you know they made record capb backs in 2024 on AI chips Jensen Wong was the beneficiary but now uh there&#39;s something called return on invested Capital that investors demand in order to allocate capital and it&#39;s eroding their return on invested uh return on invested capital or return on Equity depending which metric you like to look at because they&#39;re not getting the revenues commensurate with the spend uh in the near term so they have to temper that that&#39;s number one number two once you have all these large language models trained and and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s done as we move to the inference part once the language models are are trained the inference requires less Hardware because it&#39;s less demanding it just starts to make use of the large language models and the demand for the chips goes down so I do you think you&#39;re going to see a reating of some of these arms dealers in the AI race and and the and the third thing I would say about Nvidia is is like uh it&#39;s worked well because he&#39;s had no competition but like every semiconductor cycle and and you know a lot of people that are betting on Nvidia weren&#39;t even through puberty the last time this happened uh and they don&#39;t have any point of reference but competition is coming okay they&#39;re not curing cancer over at Nvidia that I can assure you and the chips will be replicated or even substandard versions that people can buy at quantity at price will start to replace particularly again as we move from large language models to the inference phase of the cycle uh and the purchasers of these technologies will be required by their investors to get return on investment so they either lower the spend and risk seeding market share to their competition or they get more compute power per dollar of spend through cheaper competitive chips and what we find as we find every single semiconductor cycle is that chips are a commodity and sooner or later competition catches up and it&#39;s a raise to the bottom for margins and this time will be no different",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nhere is nowhere else in the world other than public markets where the price can get so dislocated from the underlying value either due to force selling structural selling over emotion you know for some of the prices that I pay for business it&#39;s like if I went into Advanced Auto Parts board today and I said I&#39;ll take out the entire company JP Morgan&#39;s going to finance me on the debt side I&#39;ll put up some of the equity I&#39;ll raise some Equity we&#39;ll buy the entire company at $45 a share I can guarantee you sounds wonderful they would call security and have me escorted out of the building because they think I&#39;m absolutely Al Looney to never in a million years would they sell their business at $45 a share so um so those are the opportunities and that&#39;s actually one of my filters is would the board have me ask Ed out if I offer to buy the entire business at the price that was quoted in the market and uh and if the and if the answer is no they would take the meeting then that&#39;s probably not the stock for me Tom speaking of value here value um has actually been the dominant probably Factor if you want to call that in the market going back a hundred years but not this Century it&#39;s really only come in a few places comeing to vogan a few places and we&#39;ve I&#39;ve sat with a lot of guests and they&#39;ve said that low perpetually low interest rates that we&#39;ve seen this Century kind of killed off the macro trade that you know you&#39;re used to these boom bus Cycles but it&#39;s changed the game it did change the game so much and only now are we normalizing so is this\n\n beneficiary but now uh there's something called return on invested Capital that investors demand in order to allocate capital and it's eroding their return on invested uh return on invested capital or return on Equity depending which metric you like to look at because they're not getting the revenues commensurate with the spend uh in the near term so they have to temper that that's number one number two once you have all these large language models trained and and I'm not saying that's done as we move to the inference part once the language models are are trained the inference requires less Hardware because it's less demanding it just starts to make use of the large language models and the demand for the chips goes down so I do you think you're going to see a reating of some of these arms dealers in the AI race and and the and the third thing I would say about Nvidia is is like uh it's worked well because he's had no competition but like every semiconductor cycle and and you know a lot of people that are betting on Nvidia weren't even through puberty the last time this happened uh and they don't have any

competitive chips and what we find as we find every single semiconductor cycle is that chips are a commodity and sooner or later competition catches up and it's a raise to the bottom for margins and this time will be no different two\n\nno Nvidia so Nvidia can design chips but if they can&#39;t produce them they they have no business so as much as there&#39;s pessimism around the intels of the world which you know if they if they just liquidated the thing now investors would get their money back plus a few dollars um the US has invested eight billion dollars of real cash and then billions of subsidies and everything else so whether they stand up the Fab or not or or put it into a separate entity first thing they got to do is announce a new CEO I think when all is said and done what you&#39;ll find is that everything Pat gelsinger said was going to happen he had basically gotten he got into the 10 yard line and they and they they they took the ball away before he could cross the finish line he did the four nodes in five years he&#39;s uh he look he burned a lot of cash so he had to go the board got board so the name of the game is they need to hire someone and announce someone who&#39;s credible and then just finish Ginger&#39;s plan because everything&#39;s in place and if they can get the Fab business going either in the current entity or in a separate entity and they can uh catch up I think that one&#39;s got an interesting possibility relative to margin of safety of if you&#39;re conservative and you don&#39;t believe in their future as a Fab uh it&#39;s probably a double just on the Legacy business and if if they get the right CEO and if you do believe in gelsinger&#39;s full plan then this thing could be a multibagger but leaving that aside the amds will catch up uh the Marvel&#39;s the broad there there&#39;s a lot of people gunning for a piece of the Jensen Wong pie and like every cycle you can be assured that they will get some of it not all of it but they will get enough of it that um you&#39;ll see margin compression and you&#39;ll see a normalization of multiples last question on uh Ai and Nvidia this came in this week Nvidia stock Falls after Biden Administration releases updated export rules for AI chips so the Stock&#39;s been down about 12 133% since it&#39;s to in uh uh late December but uh anyway this came out it fell nearly 2% on Monday after the Biden Administration released an updated export rule aimed at controlling the flow of artificial intelligence chips to adversaries such as China the White House said that the rule will cap the number of AI chips called gpus that can be ordered by most countries without a special license smaller orders of 1,700 or fewer gpus would not count toward the export cap um is this significant for the industry at all or um or not so much I mean you expect this to be reversed uh it&#39;s significant for the industry but not for the reasons that you think number one in the short term it will hurt hurt the industry a little bit in the intermediate term to long term it will it will destroy the industry because what you basically did in the name of National Security is you&#39;ve taken uh a uh eager paying customer to us companies and said you can no longer buy from us so you&#39;ve given them no choice but to learn how to create that competency for themselves and how do they do that it&#39;s very simple they pick off the best talent uh they reverse engineer the technology and they do it themselves whereas if the government did not impose these restrictions they would stay dependent on us uh forever uh so effectively in the short term it looks like a win because they don&#39;t have the same technology in the intermediate term after they ship the the chips through other countries and ultimately get them and reverse engineer them and they front-loaded a bunch before of this anyway to buy them a few years to reverse engineer the technology and hire out all the best talent um uh the the big issue is maybe the competition that I&#39;m talking about is not coming from the the players that were anticipating and it&#39;s coming from players that are just now getting um uh going and from from China\n### MISCELLANEOUS\ngreat thank you very much uh close off let&#39;s close off on your sector overweights and underweights for 2025 suing everything together yeah I think uh three themes here first values outperform growth by 4.4% per year since 1927 so we want to be skewed toward adding value this year and the and the recency bias around value in the last since 2010 has been zero interest rate policy if you believe we&#39;re going back to to zero interest rate policy then stay overweight growth if you believe we&#39;re in a normalized environment which we do start adding some value uh into the portfolio the second theme is uh small over large you get the same or better earnings growth for half the multiple this year it worked in Trump 1.0 and the third theme is start to get some International exposure because like value and growth that runs in Cycles uh International and US runs in cycles and when you see a headline uh us exceptionalism the note that you referenced uh it&#39;s often time to start to get some Expos internationally again you know 13 14% earnings growth for 30% less multiple International is the thing as far as domestic last shall be First Health Care and um health care for sure and materials are ways to get value for massive earnings growth acceleration in 2025 uh and I think the one of the surprises of 2025 is that following the inauguration into the first quarter I think you&#39;re going to see bonds start to get bid 10 yields start to get bid yields compress uh and I I think that the uh the pounding the table around 5% is going to be more like 4% would be my bet as we move throughout the year uh I I take the under I&#39;d see the 10year yield closer to 4% then closer to 5% uh towards the end of the year for sure interesting\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nexclusive Thomas J&#39;s chairman and managing members great Hill Capital cnia America how are you Thomas it&#39;s been a while I&#39;m doing great thanks for having me Saina thank you for joining us in CNBC Indonesia just barely three days ago Donald Trump has been inaugurated as the 47 presidents of the United States of America so what is your outlook for the US economy yeah I think we&#39;re going to see a very positive high growth economy like we saw in the first few years of his first term uh certainly positive impact on the economy positive impact on the stock market and it&#39;s really going to be driven by tax cuts lower taxes lower regulation more business-friendly environment and I think the other aspect of what we&#39;re going to see safrina is a more broadening in the participation like we saw in the first term uh people at the lower level of the income strata are going to do a lot better just like they did in 2017 2018 2019 we&#39;re also going to see a lot more sector participation us markets have been pretty concentrated in Tech participation magnificent 7 I think we&#39;re going to start to see a lot more companies in Industrials manufacturing banking energy uh start to participate small caps Etc so a lot of broadening and uh and good performance in stock outside of the Magnificent 7 moving forward and also the labor force Market as you mention yes yeah there&#39;s no question about it uh they going to be uh better wages there going to be more jobs there&#39;s going to be a lot more investment in the US a lot more manufacturing you know manufacturing has been in a recession or even a a slump for two straight years I think you&#39;re going to see some policies and some investment that&#39;s going to make manufacturing boom again that&#39;s going to create a lot of high paying jobs and beside the manufacturing Industries in the United States what do you believe will be his key priorities to strengthen your domestic economy Thomas yeah I think there there are a few Sao number one is going to Unleash the Beast of US Energy we have unlimited beautiful natural resources\n\nis peace through strength getting us out of Wars uh creating a peaceful geopolitical environment through a strong National Defense and spending on defense so uh those are kind of the core tenants of things we&#39;re going to see that are going to lead to growth and stability under the Trump Administration right I would like to hear more and I want you to elaborate more about his inauguration speech essential topics with the popular catch price drill baby drill what do we need to anticipate from that as from the Emerging Markets point of view well I think that t\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  a perception that uh Trump is going to want to do trade Wars and tariff and Emerging Markets will do poorly and I think what we saw in the first Administration first Trump Administration was exactly the opposite so the the two things that people expected in Trump 1.0 when he ran as the Tariff King was that the US dollar was going to be very strong and emerging Mar market equities would be very weak after the inauguration in 2017 the exact opposite happened so right after he was elected the dollar rallied and emerging market stocks went down down uh right after he was inaugurated in 200 January 2017 you saw the dollar back off uh started to weaken in that first year you saw emerging markets and China stocks start to do exceptionally well in those first two years of the 2017 Administration so I think there&#39;s going to be a difference between what people expect I.E International emerging will do less well and what actually happens I think I think the whole world is going to do well and I think emerging market stocks are going to Boom uh I think that uh Commodities are going to do well and I think it&#39;s going to be fueled by a lot of investment a lot of growth lot of optimism and good policy uh win-win policy globally right right thank you um now moving on to the digital assets how do you anticipate the Trump administration&#39;s approach towards the the Bitcoin the digital assets the cryptocurrencies will there be significant new regulation in this particular sector I think it&#39;s going to be nuanced certainly it&#39;s going to be more crypto friendly he ran on that to uh really attract a lot of people who own crypto assets to vote for him uh and I think he&#39;ll follow through on what he promised so there will be a focus on Innovation there will be a focus on deregulation you see uh Scott bessent his treasury secretary has spoken positively about crypto Howard L lutnick his Commerce Secretary uh owns Bitcoin has invested in crypto companies vocal supporter of Bitcoin and then the SEC chairman Paul Atkins is ex expected to take a a softer approach to crypto regulation uh I would keep in mind though uh that further adoption and further rules are also going to Foster more competition more issuance so uh it&#39;s started out straight away with uh the Trump token and the Melania token so you know all these folks that are in uh Bitcoin and uh salana and other instruments may start to see a lot more competition for those crypto dollars because I think there&#39;s going to be a lot more issuance of different tokens and different crypto opportunities so it potentially could have an effect that people are not focused on which is delution you know people say well coin Bitcoin is the best thing ever because it&#39;s scarce uh but if the regulation becomes more friendly you could have a lot more tokens and crypto Investments that may in fact dilute the couple that currently have uh a duop on the crypto investment funds right Thomas and this is Trum 2.0 as we mentioned here and given the history of the previous trade War do you think we will foree the possibility of a trade War 2.0 between the US and China under this Trump&#39;s leadership I think that uh first and foremost I think that&#39;s a headline that&#39;s unfair I think what Trump wants to do is threaten big okay and then negotiate a favorable win-win deal okay and if you look at the big focused has been on China uh you know China is a small portion of our global trade it&#39;s about $600 billion of call it 5 trillion uh he came out of the gate and he said 60% Trump&#39;s tariffs on China day one well now we&#39;re talking about 10% tariffs on China and it wasn&#39;t on day one it&#39;s going to be pushed off till February so I think uh you know as it relates to China his number one thing is stop get stop allowing this fent andol to go through our borders it&#39;s hurting a lot of our people so he&#39;s going to use the tariffs to get the Chinese to cooperate on those issues that are very very important to the US uh there probably will be some level of tariffs but it will be a lot lower than advertised and then once that framework and agreement is in place I think it will Foster a lot more business between the two countries versus the previous administration that you know consistently said you know China was wrong and and never got to the table to do a good deal but how do you particular see the relations between Donald Trump and cim Bank I think they&#39;re actually a lot better than is advertised uh on the\n\n historically the number one thing you need is massive growth and I think this White House is keenly focused on massive growth through deregulation and through tax cuts and through other growth initiatives but we do need a perception of getting that spending under control and that&#39;s what doge is all about yeah this perception is important and look this isn&#39;t the first time a US president has vowed to cut the fat in federal government and Trump in his first term added more money to the federal deficit any president so tell me why this time things are going to be different well I think that there&#39;s no choice okay in order to uh get the interest rates under control he wants to bring interest rates down you can only control that through the FED which is an independent body uh and the long end of the curve is really going to tell you whether the market believes they are getting the spending under control but you know there are some sensible ideas that are coming out as a as a function of this dialogue plug which is you know consolidating a lot of these redundant government agencies or making them more uh efficient uh even you&#39;ve you&#39;ve heard the idea of reducing the number of them from 400 down to 100 which would be a tall order uh probably a wish list uh more than a reality but if we move in this direction it&#39;s going to send the right message to the market more people will want to buy our debt we can refinance at lower rates while we wait for growth to uh pick up a bit growth been good it could get better Thomas you make some great points and uh that t### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  a a need to do this to kind of streamline government so what role will Doge play uh if you will in cryptocurrency regulation and I ask this because the president the first lady have launched their own crypto so the fact that he has that and a billionaire is overseeing overall of this does it kind of smack of trouble down the road yeah the crypto thing is pretty gray at this moment because he did appoint David Sachs as the crypto Zar originally and then David had a lot of ties in Silicon Valley that did you know enabled him to be more of an advisor than take a major role uh in the administration so there&#39;s some ambiguity about crypto as far as Doge related to crypto crypto seems to be a separate initiative that that will be under the crypto are that will be under other purviews besides Doge doge is predominantly focused uh on reducing the cost okay so cuts on from Doge and more efficient Workforce so if you&#39;re a federal worker right now in any agency and there are a lot of them out there are you nervous are you anxious are you antsy and what are the markets looking for yeah I I do think you are I think the first thing that they did was do the executive order that you must come back to work in the office 5 days a week that will probably D Trim 5 to 10% of the workforce without them having to do much just to start with because not all people can work from the office uh 5 days a week that have family and other commitments so that will help uh we&#39;ve seen uh hopes or wish lists or assertions from the people uh involved or around Doge that they could cut 75% of government employees that is uh a tall order that is unlikely to be anywhere near met I would be a little concerned if you&#39;re not in an indispensable position I do think there&#39;s going to be consolidation of agencies I do think there&#39;s going to be a reduction of the workforce all the work is going to be done in person and as they bring in software and more efficient processes to the federal government uh that will reduce a lot of make work so I I would expect to see I&#39;m not uh thinking anywhere near 75% reduction but 10 to 20% is realistic okay uh you only have 30 seconds now Trump has had some major fallouts with people he&#39;s been close to to what happens if Trump and musk Collide and this friendship crashes and burns well I think it&#39;s a symbiotic relationship because musk uh certainly needs the administration for some of his initiatives with regard to uh SpaceX and uh uh automated driving and uh other other projects that musk is involved in and Trump needs the expertise you know the one thing that about Trump is he is very attentive to people who have uh areas of specific expertise and in many cases are uh wealthy or wealthier than he is he loves to listen to their viewpoints because he takes them very very seriously I think that adds a lot from elon&#39;s uh credibility as it relates to Tech as it relates to some of the initiatives where uh Donald Trump doesn&#39;t H quite have the background as a real estate developer and businessman he&#39;s not so focused on on some of the things that are happening in the economy now and that&#39;s where Elon can provide a tremendous amount of value for Trump for the administration for the country so right now it&#39;s really too symbiotic to have a Fallout unless we saw an instance where uh the spotlight started to get excessively stolen which uh I it gets crowded there really quickly exactly so so that&#39;s a risk but I I think it&#39;s less of a risk than people are making it out to be at the moment because they both meet each other okay we&#39;ll see Thomas always a pleasure my friend thank you so much thanks Sean okay we&#39;re gonna take a and we&#39;re back and there was one more here and\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nhere is  a key note from hartnet over at the Bank of America fund manager survey I love looking at his contrarian

and others small cap stocks need to stay above the 2021 highs uh they're they're going to do that I think that's going to be the big story here we're already starting to see today was a great example upturn now but flipflops Galore so this is talking about the phase one recoveries that we've talked here's where we are where value small size starts to outperform coming after the uh high quality large size which we saw last year and this is just a normal regular regime you got to know what phase you're in and take advantage this is uh indicative of that going back to 2021 dividend yield inexpensive versus history we've been talking about that for 6 months that is now playing out neglected by managers value versus growth best generational opportunity since uh 2001 and before that 1980 uh history doesn't rhyme repeat but it does rhyme and that's what's happening growth versus value at xco highs well above the uh Tech highs we've covered all that and why it's based in fundamentals is not just looking at charts and saying it has to mean in revert why does it have to mean revert and you can look at the data and the earning earnings deceleration versus acceleration and the policies

urgency for him to get it done as we&#39;re holders of qxo so I&#39;ll leave it at that uh Goran says uh look at vi v this is probably some software thing with no moat so I&#39;m going to probably not be interested but I&#39;ll take a look yeah so it&#39;s done nothing for 22 years why would anything change let&#39;s see if he has a thesis for it another stocking cycle about to begin I mean if they haven&#39;t had a stocking cycle in 22 years they&#39;re probably not going to have one now this looks like a dog and it probably is a bunch of management that dilutes owners and issues a ton of stock cash flows going down revenues are going down uh nothing I like about it yet let me just see if these guys are pigs and I can save our a lot of time if management doesn&#39;t respect equity and they make my slice of the pie smaller without my permission by duding me and issuing shares to themselves or at bad prices I will never do business with them um I I like to say they&#39;re either going to leave or I&#39;m going to leave and more likely it&#39;s going to be me leaving Okay so don&#39;t have an equity problem so what kind of problem do they have they have a lowquality business problem they get a a a return on invested Capital that&#39;s lower than their weighted average cost of capital and that&#39;s a sign of a bad business with no mop so uh I&#39;m going to be a pass on that one Patrick uh how did you come across your current stock selections uh Patrick I I mean it&#39;s so funny most just look at my daily reads which me very few people do I mean I read like 20 30 40 articles as I mean maybe more only 20 30 40 make it to my what I&#39;m reading today list that&#39;s starter then I get all the Wall Street research then I&#39;m constantly screening stocks every single day then I&#39;ve been reading annual reports and listening to conference calls for 20 some odd years so when I see something I I can react it&#39;s like how could Buffett do an 8 and a half billion deal with Goldman Sachs in 2008 from his bathtub because he&#39;s been studying the company for 20 years so he could allocate eight and a half billion dollars in five minutes not because he was being Reckless because he knew the company I know 90% of these companies and I see how they respond through cycles and when opportunity presents itself it&#39;s like the plumber you know he comes in in the old joke uh he comes in he Taps on the thing he says you know 400 bucks it&#39;s fixed they&#39;re like 400 bucks that only took you a minute he goes yeah it was only $4 for the minute it was 396 for the 20 years of expertise that told me where to tap on it h which took only one minute and that&#39;s that&#39;s really what it comes down to there&#39;s no shortcut you got to do the work and experience it and if you don&#39;t love the game go build a business and lay it off to someone who&#39;s good who does love the game and does it 247 that you&#39;re never going to be able to compete with because you don&#39;t have two sets of 24 hours in one day Don L uh do you think with the beginning of a Nat gas super cycle given AI needs Comstock or 100 or 200 could be a possibility dur due to euphoric markets Don who cares at this point uh I don&#39;t want to speculate all I can tell you is it&#39;s its liquidation value is still you know close to double where it is now uh and then I&#39;ll take a look at what the fundamentals look like and all the super cycle headline nonsense but look if I come out of it on an eight or $ n basis at $50 and I I sell a bunch of it and keep a little bit of it and it goes to 300 I&#39;m not going to lose sleep I already made a six bagger in a couple of years uh if I if I left a 12 or 24 bagger on the table I&#39;ll keep a tail on it I&#39;ll keep another 25% and let it run for a while but uh that&#39;s all speculation who cares about that but thank you for the nice question and highlighting one of the winners because uh for those of you who know we don&#39;t spend much time on our winners on this conference call we spend to tend to spend all the time on the ones that haven&#39;t left the station yet which we enjoy doing John Doe uh insurers like Fairfax and Marquel uh look I have no idea what their exposure is to the California stuff I know they&#39;re going to use it as an opportunity to um increase prices uh but no I&#39;m not buying marel here I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s up almost triple since since covid uh that&#39;s not when you buy insurers you buy insurers when no one wants some like Lincoln National a couple years that&#39;s when you buy insurers this is a lowquality business you bought it in the hole at 15 bucks you got a four bagger just on recovery you know cyclical type stuff it&#39;s probably still cheap here because it&#39;s a lowquality business but Markel is a high quality business and it&#39;s trading at all-time high so not interested Fairfax I mean these are all I want to be Warren Buffett well everyone wants to be Warren Buffett which is why they&#39;re fully priced so you&#39;re not really adding any value by buying something that&#39;s trading at fully valued so um yeah they&#39;re great businesses you won&#39;t lose money investing them over time but there&#39;s an opportunity cost and you know there&#39;s there&#39;s this whole kind of Cadre of people only buy the highest quality blah blah blah and then they buy them when they&#39;re everything is perfect and they&#39;re at all-time highs and a perfect return on Capital and what happens they hit a cycle the thing goes down 50% they were right about it being high quality they bought it at the wrong time which is why I like I like taking B andc players when they&#39;re absolutely decimated but I can be clear they&#39;re not going out of business because then I&#39;m going to get a triple and I don&#39;t have to have the best quality one breaking out and all this I can just buy a business that I know is not going out of business and make a double or triple over a few years rinse and repeat over and over so I&#39;ll leave that one there thank you for the question thanks for being a listener Philipe Andrew pinkos uh is asking about China listening to their last call they&#39;re very happy about China I&#39;m very happy about China uh GL Smith client is from Chris C uh I think many of these uh you know kind of value Pharma are going to start to do well but this is not a good use of capital you&#39;re lucky if you get a double over three or four years and you know it&#39;s kind of a lowquality uh business you got to understand the pipeline and if I don&#39;t have at least a guaranteed double in a short period of time I&#39;m not going to spend the time on it so with this one I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s trading flat because the business has been flat so so if you can tell me that there&#39;s some amazing drug in the pipeline I might listen but that&#39;s not the business I do uh you think this recently Indie semiconductor which foken company like Indie I&#39;m not interested in those tiny little players because they&#39;re going to get smoked out Sebastian

negative free cash flow declining Revenue cyclical business um I already have one in uh albamar which I like Precious Metals mining I hate precious metals mining I I really I mean mine like the this thing is this is a trading vehicle I would not want to own this business it&#39;s a bad quality business but I it&#39;s probably going to work as a trade I&#39;ll leave it at that John dabc National oil W Varco yeah again it&#39;s a serer someone asks every few weeks I think it&#39;s probably okay I just I just don&#39;t love it enough I mean it&#39;s uh it&#39;s been dead money for years it didn&#39;t really recover with everything else and maybe now&#39;s the time cash flows inflecting revenues inflecting margin&#39;s going up so look there&#39;s some positive stuff I think if you buy this you&#39;re fine maybe you make a double but I just let me take a closer look here because I I I&#39;ve looked at this thing over and over and done nothing and been right but maybe now I&#39;m going to start being wrong but errors of omission I&#39;m good with and just not errors of O commission you know it&#39;s never it&#39;s never been a business that earned above its cost of capital so it&#39;s a crappy business but when they catch a cycle they go and they didn&#39;t catch the last cycle they&#39;re still burning cash uh it got 800 million bucks and how much debt 1.7 billion let&#39;s see if that at least respect Equity a little bit uh yeah so so they&#39;re growing the share count a little bit Ah I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get hurt I think maybe you get a double it&#39;s okay Kevin McAllister uh Alx for China small cap exposure I don&#39;t want China small cap exposure it&#39;s got to be the highest I&#39;m not taking company and Country I understand the thought on it not not really interested Foot Locker Foot Locker is a play on Nike ladies and gentlemen why don&#39;t you just buy Nike I would just buy Nike don&#39;t buy Foot Locker I&#39;m not even going to look at it Mastercraft boat you know this is like Fu foxf uh interest rates coming down all the overstocks uh work through so maybe these Recreation things start to ro roll again C I mean with all the boat parades uh they&#39;re going to be having with the Trump Flags maybe they&#39;ll sell a lot of boats now let&#39;s see master craft why is this not coming up are you sure it&#39;s not Malibu Boats I think it&#39;s Malibu Boats and they sell Mastercraft uh I don&#39;t think this is ready yet I I I&#39;ve looked at this a bunch I don&#39;t like these recreational things you know the the RV businesses uh let&#39;s see Malibu Boats do they sell mastercrafts well it&#39;s the same thing I mean it&#39;s the same business ah let me see if these things are starting to inflect at all I mean revenues are still decimated as a matter of fact I have a friend who sells uh Boston Whalers and like Criss crafts and all that type of stuff and they&#39;ve gotten smoked the last couple of years I mean it&#39;s starting to stabilize a little bit I think you might be early I mean these revenues are getting smoked I would take a look at this inventory recovery is probably showing that they&#39;re working down inventories and and maybe a restock cycle uh uh this one let me just take a look here see if it&#39;s ever been a good business yeah I all right I get it um see if they&#39;re going to live another day 30 $26 million of cash is that right how much debt do they have not much and freak cash flow negative you really got to understand is the turnaround real I mean is this legit uh they&#39;re back to kind of preco is sales levels and back then it was kind of trading where it is now I think you got to do a lot more work but I definitely see what you potentially see Drew Robinson wary Parker no interest uh Jimmy Jones uh Baxter High PE ratio all the stocks we buy probably have high PE ratios because at the time we buy them they&#39;re in trough earning cycle so that we never even talk about pees on this this uh uh podcast we talk about cash flow we talk about revenues we talk about margins because when we&#39;re buying it they&#39;re down 60 80% and they&#39;re going to be at negative or or break even earnings so you&#39;re going to have a 100 times multiple if you&#39;re earning a penny and the stock is trading at $1 and uh and if they have uh no earnings in the short term which is very often in turnaround Tom&#39;s uh picks when they&#39;re down 80% uh but we&#39;ve seen them operate through Decades of cycles and we know that&#39;s what happens every cycle um you know they their multiples infinite so PE is not the right question the right question is uh what does their cash flow and earnings power look like proforma when the kidney business is out and they pay down debt their interest uh expense goes down and the multiple rates because the slowest growing part of their business the kid kidney business which pulled the multiple down from 18 down to 12 is now out of there and all they&#39;re left with is a fast growing business that warrants a higher multiple uh and it rates from you know 12 times to 18 times and gets gets momentum and Off to the Races so p is the wrong question uh mod is the right question no one no one even compares in the IV business and and the areas that they uh compete their pump business had a little bit of a softness they now got the new pump out that&#39;s going to absolutely kick ass and uh they&#39;re going to be Off to the Races so love that one uh Scott Wilson resonated most with your recommendations not advice by the way go to hedge fund tips.com click on terms all of this is opinion not advice talk to your financial adviser don&#39;t do anything yada yada yada read terms uh what is he talking here okay now Scott you&#39;re right on on point thanks for inviting me up to ohigh uh whenever I get up there I will definitely look you up and uh very grateful for your support over the year and recommending to your friend and colleagues you&#39;re on the right track those are good tools to have you could probably get value line at your uh local library uh if you want to do that and um very grateful for the kind words Jeremy uh all right do gp1s hurt Hershey yes they hurt Hershey they hurt diio but it&#39;s reflect in the price certainly in the case of diio Hershey there could be a little bit more hurt before it actually Rock and rolls but um Hershey&#39;s is just one of the greatest businesses and uh you know look not everyone&#39;s going to stay on these things that&#39;s just the nature of the Beast so I I look every week I look at Hershey and I&#39;m interested and I do nothing so this will probably be one that I miss I mean at 100 it&#39;s at 150 bucks if it got to 100 bucks I wouldn&#39;t even have to think about it cuz like so much is priced in uh and uh I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re on 80 gp1s you&#39;re still going to eat Reese&#39;s Pieces I mean who doesn&#39;t eat Reese the stuff is like crack I mean it&#39;s the best tasting thing in the world so and no one can replicate if you actually understand the Hershey business and how they have these special stones that take like 10 years to replicate and no one can replicate that particular flavor which is also the moat of the Coca-Cola Company um I think you&#39;ll find that um Hershey&#39;s going to be just fine so I would say I&#39;m interested in Hershey I&#39;m aware of the glp1 issue and there&#39;s not a big enough Motor Safety for me to back up the truck yet and I fully expect that it&#39;ll run away from me before it gets to a point where I would back up the truck and I&#39;m perfectly okay with errors of omission not errors of commission thoughts on Snap uh I hate this business I think uh no not for me if it turns around it turns around but it&#39;s the same manager and it&#39;s just been a dog forever uh the idea is that if Tik Tok gets out everyone&#39;s going to have to use snap I mean you got to go through the whole thing th this guy&#39;s no Zuckerberg this guy is uh uh different level he&#39;s in the bush League Zuckerberg is in the you know pro league and I just don&#39;t know how it turns around um I think there&#39;s a demographic that uses it every day but it&#39;s like 5 year to seven-year window the the new young people don&#39;t use it at all the uh middle young people use it a lot this has never been a good business uh just uh no not for me cheap for a reason Allan I covered the China thing on CPS let&#39;s try Bart Market access I keep looking at it I&#39;m not really inclined to do anything I know why you&#39;re looking at it I think you&#39;re right to be looking at it I think it&#39;s what Mk yeah MK TX uh I just I mean everything looks right I just don&#39;t understand the moat and uh and it yeah I it definitely is worthy of trading platform for institutional broker dealer company liquidity Gade bonds Emerging Market debt I just find that these are raised to the bottoms I mean you had Knight that blew up I I don&#39;t like this business so I&#39;m going to just say no even though all the numbers look great

the indices 8 to 12 and for under the surface fortunes are going to be made they won&#39;t move the needle on the indices because the weights are low right now those weights will go up just like what happened with energy in 2020 when we were pounding the hell with uh uh xon at $33 and said you know oil was negative we&#39;re saying buy the hell out of everything in oil and then after they all doubled and tripled everyone got interested in oil we were laying off uh and they did nothing for two years so uh housing affordability this has to change it&#39;s going to change Trump&#39;s going to find a way to deregulate build like crazy smaller Footprints more houses bring down the cost much more earnings growth is expected to broaden we&#39;ve covered that a million times truck land demo uh

it&#39;s happening two weeks again and and then demand recovery equals higher margins we&#39;re seeing this in earnings things are positive ladies and gentlemen and uh animal spirits are certainly back the question is how much is priced in and the answer is a lot&#39;s priced in for mag 7 Not A lot&#39;s priced in for UNM mag 493 International small cap value the things that we&#39;re in which are now starting to get bid like crazy existing home sales da we know that story uh FX could be a much bigger headwind in 2025 so I think that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to see some guidance issues you had a strong Dollar in Q4 that&#39;s going to weaken but that&#39;s going to make guidance more conservative which is typical in the first quarter of every year guidance gets super conservative they&#39;ll use the FX as an excuse and then the dollar will weaken and they&#39;ll say oh what do you know we did better than expected\n\ntruck load demand is going up that&#39;s a good indicator

about ISM Manufacturing and service it&#39;s been dead for 2 years we&#39;ve been in a manufacturing depression like 2007 to 2009 like 2000 to 2002 and then what happened straight up value small caps Industrials all the things that make the world go around super excited beige book activity ticking up China GDP you know 5.4 crushed estimates no one&#39;s talking about it they will they were all worried about that Trump and X had a beautiful call uh Trump said he was 60% day one now it&#39;s maybe 10% maybe do a phone call maybe that China helps with Russia and gets off the hook completely maybe they do a Tik Tock deal and maybe no one has any idea what&#39;s about to come except for the folks on this podcast um industrial production going up in China not down retail sales going up not down new home prices are starting to recover existing home prices starting to recover after four years uh China new home prices stabilized with stimulus push stimulus that&#39;s all pigging the python it&#39;s starting to come out it&#39;s going to come out all at once it&#39;s built up pushing the beach ball underwater when it comes out it comes out it hot and it comes out aggressive and you won&#39;t be able to catch it and um and that&#39;s going to be super duper fun because we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to make up on on one position you know two three years of irr in probably 6 n months and exceed our our IR hurdle that we internally uh uh commit to uh for what we do in terms of internal expectations and then set exp external expectations much lower so pretty excited about that Global LNG shortfalls are forecast until 2027 com stock baby you rocking and rolling I remember we couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t give it away at 8 now at 25 everyone&#39;s interested sending me all these natural gas articles and everything else it&#39;s like okay uh thank you so Advanced decline breath is starting to improve all the things that we&#39;ve been pounding that got sidetracked in December are now coming back on Trend since uh J July of last year manufacturing production through the roof that&#39;s aircraft and parts that&#39;s exciting economic surprise index moving back up that&#39;s cities sources say Intel is an acquisition Target maybe it&#39;s Elon maybe it&#39;s someone else the key is it&#39;s in play one Catalyst or another either they get bought and if it&#39;s a good enough company hopefully we get stock and we can continue to ride it if it&#39;s a um uh or we could get a new CEO first and they say we&#39;re not for sale shortterm it&#39;ll sell down and then it&#39;ll go up because basically gelsinger&#39;s plan is 99% done they quit at the 10 yard line so we&#39;re excited about that Trump trade memorandum won&#39;t impose new tariffs day one we saw that 10-year yield is coming back down just like we thought it would after the uh election I&#39;m sorry after the inauguration uh we talked about that on CNA largest monthly rotation into EU stocks in the past 25 years when&#39;s the last time this happened going back to when 2001 which we talk about every single week and also in 2014 another great good time for those International stocks boom out of us into Euro Zone rock and roll baby why partially uh uh Japan&#39;s going to start hiking we&#39;ll talk about that uh Chinese uh stopped weakening their currency so we got a little bit of strength relative to Yuan that&#39;s what you see before rallies in China equities uh big big move one of the largest moves in over half a year decade to date inflows of Equity Funds nothing into International everything into us this is going to flip on its head in 2025 and 2026 here&#39;s the value of US trade goods by partner uh all you really need to know\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving along  uh number of executive orders by President so everyone&#39;s saying Trump is out of control with his executive orders pales in comparison to FDR Herbert Hoover Warren Harding uh it&#39;s Etc uh interest rates since 3 3000 BC we see these spikes everyone keeps looking at recency bias thinking it&#39;s going to be like 1980 it&#39;s just the opposite these are regular things that you see over the last few th thousand years they Spike up they come back down they Spike up mostly a downtrend with the exception of 1980 and that&#39;s why everyone&#39;s got their thinking backwards on this and um you know even uh in different periods so that&#39;s that top 10 companies percent of S&P market cap look this is this is crazy town ladies and gentlemen so you can you can chase these but eventually you&#39;re going to get hurt maybe it&#39;s two years from now you know there&#39;s a saying the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent that really only applies to people who use a ton of Leverage and are day trading you know people and get get you know sell the bottom buy the tops and get you know just whip sought around if you know what you own and you&#39;re pay paying a good price price is what you pay value is what you get you you don&#39;t worry about the short-term fluctuations you&#39;re not getting margin called cuz you&#39;re on very low to no leverage and you just ride it through until you get your doubles triples quadruples and then you lay it off to all the people that are excited about it that were selling to you in the hole when no one was excited about it and you rinse and repeat and you do it over and over this is not rocket science it just takes ice in your veins and for most people they say I you know I have you know uh regular temperature water in my veins I&#39;m going to lay it off to the guy with ice in his veins so I don&#39;t have to think about it and I can go be brilliant at my business that makes all the money and lay off the cash for someone else to manage so I don&#39;t have to think about it and uh and and they can go to the beach and enjoy life with their family uh percent of companies outperforming the S&P 500 since 1990 so we haven&#39;t seen this level of uh companies underperform the S&P since when since the early 2000s when what happened small caps value International started to dramatically outperform uh uh here we go same thing this is the uh relative performance to US versus xus and this is at a level of you know two three standard deviations above the mean well more than the internet bubble well more than nifty50 so keep piling into those and pray for pray for the best um uh you better make sure you put a lot in the basket when you go to church CU you&#39;re going to need it uh us value versus growth relative performance so yes we see this Zer error value and outperformed growth for uh you know 78 decades and then you have a zero interest rate uh policy for a while which is over unless you believe rates are going back to zero if you&#39;re stuck in this good luck ladies and gentlemen is all I have to say uh us duties collected we&#39;ve covered this before for everyone saying tariffs are going to cause a depression we have the lowest tariffs that we&#39;ve had in hundreds of year in in over uh century and even in the Spanish Flu 19808 we started at 6% uh uh of Duties collected on total Imports we&#39;re currently at like 3% so even if we went to 6% uh um they raised tariffs from 1918 to 1930 from 6% to 20 almost 20% before the depression so everyone saying if he does tariffs we&#39;re going into a depression obviously he&#39;s never read a history book and is kind of a joke but um there are plenty of people who don&#39;t read history books that are pretty you know uh always wrong and never in doubt and unburdened by the facts of history but um Global share of automotive car production by re country region uh China&#39;s kicking but they&#39;ve just been taking share from everyone and us has been losing share because we are in the business of healthcare and annuities not making cars uh but we&#39;re making enough cars that Cooper standard is going to rock and roll and Cooper is also benefiting from China uh as you if you listened to and read the most recent conference calls they were surprised how well their China Partnerships were going uh and I&#39;ll leave it at that you can do your own work on that Commodities 10year analyed returns coming back uh like a phoenix From the Ashes just like the early 2000s and other cyclical periods it&#39;s not often stocks break a record dating back 97 years it just did so with the six straight session with two out of every three stock in the S&P advancing uh that is very sign a positive sign of breath here&#39;s China anytime you&#39;ve seen shorted interest uh this extreme always preceded a major rally in China stocks we are twice as Extreme as we&#39;ve been during those periods which means the beach ball is pushed twice underwater when you have that level of pressure acute pressure when when it is released the move will be so abrupt and so massive that uh people will just miss it is really what it comes down to they&#39;ll be buying up double and triple and we&#39;ll be handily helping them out and giving them all that they need uh\n\nthe Spanish Flu 19808 we started at 6% uh

months delivers positive returns both 3 and 6 months forwarded some 92% of the time uh and you can see here 12 months out up 99.4% SNP earnings analysis uh what do we have here Q4 2024 earnings results relative to consensus up 88.9% 75% companies beating I think that's gone up we'll cover that with fax set a little bit later um stock have done quite well in the first year of a new presidential term lately you can see uh going back to 2025 It's Always a Good Year and quite a good year going back to 2009 so we'll see if that repeats I'm more uh conservative than this but uh i' I'd be more than willing to accept uh another amazing uh set of returns EU passenger car registrations going up just like us everywhere going up up up incentives going up volumes going up margins for

he's considering a 10% tariff on China beginning as soon as February 1st this was a few days ago today he was saying he has a great relationship with G and uh he wants G to help on the fent andol he wants G to help on uh Russia to get the war done and if G helps uh he's going to get Benny's and if he gets Benny's then these stocks are not priced for that and uh we could see something like we

of America fund manager survey top five points most bullish Catalyst for 2025 remains China growth acceleration two managers are dramatically underweight materials and energy three second largest monthly rotation into EU stocks in 25 years four rotation into healthc care and commodi started the year we talked about that before the start of the Year hope you guys were able to take advantage macro Outlook still has plenty of room to improve we agree and Estee louder so we like to cover one or two stocks we&#39;ve talked about previously and uh in many cases have built a position uh Estee louder we&#39;re seeing cash flow start to re accelerate this was a cyclical trough pretty much uh attributable to little bit of mismanagements a lot of China weakness and now that&#39;s all coming back uh their long-term thing they&#39;re going to continue to earn a return on invested Capital well above their weighted average cost of capital which is the the definition of a high quality business and you can see historically they&#39;ve been growing at you know 23 on average over 20% return on invested Capital last two years they got hit that&#39;s going to re accelerate top Line&#39;s going to continue to grow people will pay anything to look good this is the best brand uh this owns Asia and Asia is coming back uh like crazy so you should read through all of his notations here on the Morning Star commentary but when you read it you are going to be really impressed and really interested this will take a little while because it got so destroyed but you know here&#39;s a stock that&#39;s down to whatever it is 70 bucks down from 300 and uh 350 uh at $80 I mean look it could hang around between 50 and 70 for 3 years before going back to 250 who cares but I think this one&#39;s probably going to recover pretty quickly with China and I&#39;m getting a lot more confidence in China where I want to get even more direct and indirect exposure to take advantage of something that happens every you know five six years that people forget these are cyclical things um they beat earnings they improved operational efficiency gross margin improved in the most recent quarter uh they got a new CEO who knows what he&#39;s doing so all these things position it to absolutely catapult the the rebound and China is the name of the game this is a brand that&#39;s been around for you know century plus it&#39;s the best of the best it will continue to be the best of the best and if they see upand comers which is what they do they&#39;re phenomenal Capital allocators they just buy them and tuck them in just like diio best in the business so um gp1s are not going to hurt uh Este louder if anything it&#39;s going to help it the skinnier people get the better they want to look they&#39;re going to be doing makeup like crazy so and all that money they save on food and alcohol they can put put in on their face so uh so we love it uh as I said we close the raise congrats to everyone that came in if you&#39;re still in process you&#39;re still in the game if you have not reached out for the million dooll accounts you&#39;re going to have to wait at least till Q2 5 million plus accounts can come in any time we do bespoke service but for the smaller accounts we want to focus on investing the next 10 10 weeks uh and then revisit opening to the smaller accounts then uh defense and Aerospace earnings estimates uh down by 75 basis points in the last 60 days energy down 4.5% again outside of comto there&#39;s nothing that were table Pounders paying

      "small cap why because I get the same growth for half the multiple price is what you pay value is what you get and the second Auto stock that I wanted to talk about is a small cap in particular it's called Cooper standard this stock is down not 80% this stock is down 90% okay same thing that happened they took solvency risk off the table they refinanced the debt all this is is a play on increasing volumes and if you remember from December volumes came in it surprised everyone 16.8 million annualized what you've seen over the last 45 years is North American sell through sa uh it it it Peaks and troughs between 15.3 million to 17.1 the last time you had a peak was 2017 at 177.1 this company earned $7 a share and traded at $146 we started buying it at five and change it's now up to 13 and change um we believe that the next time we hit 17 million in volumes they're not only going to earn $7 they're going to earn $10 a share because they've taken $400 million a cost out so these are the special unique situations in small caps where you can get involved uh you can take a risk you're not going to put your whole portfolio in a small cap stock you want to be careful and you you want to have a a portfolio 10 15 20 stocks you know the less confidence you have the more Diversified you need to be um the more you know buff buffet and Monger used to always say uh divers diversification is a hedge against not knowing what you're doing or some would call that inconfidence but yeah bigger picture do you have like a percentage breakdown you recommend for growth and value and large cap and small cap for people to be invested in yeah that's you know that's going to depend on their unique goals uh that's something that they definitely want to talk to a financial adviser because at different ages you want to have different levels of risk I deal exclusively with family offices and ultra high net worth accredited and qualified investors so um so that's really going to depend where you're at I think for a lot of people what makes sense is to passively index the bulk of their money and then if they have a small bucket where they want to start to learn and start to experience and start to experiment they're doing it with a very small and as they grow confidence and grow experience and grow knowledge then they can expand that bucket over time we but we've had a number of people guess on this show that have told Sid and looked Us in the eye and said well you're young well they looked Sid in the eye not me said you're young uh you don't need the you don't need the rest of the S&P 500 you just need the NASDAQ you need some of the growth year stocks you don't need bonds what would you say to that yeah they said that in late 90s also I mean look I don't think this is the late 990s I don't I don't expect a tech rack I do expect consolidation of some of these gains and some reating of the multiples um you know Sydney probably has to speak to her financial advisor about that uh I thought you were advising me right now but if you if you were my sister I'd put you in a good good a few good companies and then I'd probably have you indexing the rest so you slept well at night and you were comfortable with that uh and then over time you you could build up as the profits and as your account grew and uh as you got more comfortable with with that what about small caps though are those for and as the the group would you trade the Russell or the S&P 600 or you're just looking for individual yeah I mean we only you know we run a very concentrated book of 8 to 12 stocks uh is our portfolio different ball game for you different ball game uh I would say though that um I would start to ease into an uh a small cap index do it small if you're like 90% in like a 6040 portfolio maybe you maybe you put 5 10% into small caps and start to lean in that way the other thing you can do some people index with uh the S&P 500 there's a Vanguard ETF vti which is a more is a broader number of companies that you'll catch some of the small caps in that it's another way to index but with more exposure less concentration to the mag 7 that's another thing to think about as well there's a there's a new S&P 500 ETF that will not weight any stock more than 3% so it's not quite equal weight it's not just all kinds of interesting products coming out like that uh if you don't have anything I I have one thing about diversification I've asked but if you're if you have a long rway is there something valid to just like putting a little bit of money in every S&P sector is that is that this is a recurring thought like how can I get it all catch them all because people say diversification I'm like what does that really mean like stocks bonds sure but like a little bit of money sounds like a good excuse for not knowing what you're talking exactly well I think um you're getting that effectively through the S&P 500 so if you you know if you if you look at uh the spider sector ETFs and then you look at the Holdings of each of them you're going to see like the top 10 Holdings are S&P component so effectively by doing that what that would change is your weighting so if you went equal weight by sector but that means you're going to have equal weight materials against equal weight uh Tech which by the way is not a horrible idea for 2025 I'll tell you why yes please do uh the two worst performing among the worst performing sectors were Healthcare and materials had low singled digigit returns in 2025 relative to the S&P over 20 20% here's what's going to happen in 2025 they have among the highest expected earnings growth Healthcare is going to grow earnings 20.4% which is more than the S&P 500 of 13 14% And materials is going to grow earnings 17.4% so as a catch-up trade that becomes very very interesting I have a materials name if you're interested but otherwise we might get to that in a second here first we got to get to today's who wore it better we have two iconic investing investing Legends marching down the red carpet it is on one side the Oracle of Omaha Warren Buffett himself squaring off against the ma master of macro David teer Buffett the steadfast value investor who build his Empire on patience discipline and the occasional cigar butt strategy he is the epitome of Jesse livermore's buy it right and sit tight strategy on the other side you've got teer a guy who just doesn't play the markets he moves them with just a few words on financial TV he stared down the global financial crisis and famously said load up the truck so in this battle of investing icons who wears the market better is it Buffett's Timeless value Playbook that shines in high rate environments or teers all weather Global macro tool kit ready to pounce on any opportunity here all right long-term Buffet hands down near-term Tepper I'll tell you why teer sure this is people are going to tune out when I say this uh I hope not it's certainly going to be controversial so keer went on TV a few months ago talking about China and and people vomited all over their desks once they heard that okay his number one position is Alibaba right now look I've been wrong about Alibaba for over a year we just keep buying it and buying it and buying it because price is what you pay value is what you get it's the lowest amount of price for the greatest amount of value right now in the international market so if you think that there's more bark to Trump than bite and he wants to do a deal with China like we saw after the election in 2000 after the inauguration in 2017 when Alibaba went from $85 not coincidentally where it is right now to $187 in 11 months you might want to take a look at that there's something that has been happening in China for the last year year and a half is that they've been doing this peac mail stimulus over and over and over and over very peacemeal but it's all building up and when it happens it's going to be uh very quickly and Alibaba is the tollkeeper it's the Tollgate for the middle class when they start spending they get a piece of all the action they've got uh of all the AI startups if you want to play a China AI ETF it's called Alibaba why because every single a they are a seed fund every single AI startup goes to Alibaba and says we need Cloud we need uh AI tools we need all of this stuff and they say it's free just give us Equity we we've got Equity as owners of Alibaba in pretty much every AI startup in China this is huge and and it's has zero value oh by the way they generate $25 billion of free cash flow every year oh by the way they're sitting on $ 55 billion of cash not a bad runway for a turnaround situation uh they can also lock up jackma at any time so t"
