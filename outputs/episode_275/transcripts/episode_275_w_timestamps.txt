[51.719s] up uh and Jason for hosting us and then
[54.879s] uh there&#39;s a picture of me it was
[56.399s] actually cold that day this week it&#39;s
[58.079s] been quite warm my game is coming coming
[60.28s] back which is pretty awesome the markets
[62.0s] close at 1:00 on Pacific Time now the
[64.96s] flip side is I&#39;m up at 4:30 every
[66.76s] morning which I don&#39;t mind today I was
[68.56s] up at 1:30 because I miscalculated uh
[72.439s] what time CNBC Indonesia was and it
[75.96s] dawned on me that the the time spread
[78.2s] might be different last night at 900
[80.2s] p.m. rather than waking up at 4:00 a.m.
[82.32s] I had to wake up at 1:00 a.m. but uh uh
[85.28s] you know world&#39;s smallest violin let&#39;s
[87.28s] get down to the media I want to thank
[89.96s] The Amazing Taylor rigs Jake Max Stu
[93.0s] oppenheim millanie kapadia obviously Liz
[96.439s] Clayman for having me on the Clayman
[98.119s] countdown and Katherine Meyers so here I
[100.759s] am with Taylor
[102.119s] Smith excuse me Taylor Swift Taylor rigs
[107.799s] uh been a long day The Amazing Taylor
[109.799s] rigs love going on with her uh we talked
[113.88s] two weeks ago and a followup on the
[115.759s] conversation we had there how it&#39;s all
[117.88s] coming into play here we go got it um
[121.439s] all right moments ago we heard president
[123.32s] Trump talking about interest rates in
[124.719s] the Oval Office after he signed an
[126.36s] executive order on crypto This Is Us the
[128.52s] first fed meeting of the year it kicks
[130.119s] off on Tuesday joining us now great Hill
[132.72s] Capitol chairman Tom Hayes to count us
[134.519s] down to the closing bell Tom we love
[136.92s] having you um what do you make of some
[139.4s] of the interest rate conversations that
[141.2s] we&#39;ve been having particularly as we
[142.8s] gear up for the big
[144.48s] fed well you you heard Donald Trump this
[147.12s] morning from Davos and thanks for having
[148.68s] me Taylor uh saying he wants lower
[151.48s] interest rates he wants that debt free
[153.28s] financing we know the debt uh interest
[155.44s] payments have gone from under a half a
[157.319s] trillion to now going to be more than a
[159.08s] trillion so he&#39;s going to continue to
[161.04s] put pressure he&#39;s going to continue to
[163.04s] cut costs with the Doge program so that
[165.4s] the market has confidence we&#39;re being
[167.68s] fiscally responsible and the market will
[169.879s] take care of interest rates over time so
[172.08s] I love filling in for Liz Clayman
[173.959s] because you are my repeat guest the last
[176.4s] time I was on with you you talked about
[178.08s] right the last in is now going to be the
[180.04s] first out right when you think about the
[182.04s] performers in this market are you
[183.959s] starting to see that play
[185.519s] out yeah there&#39;s no question and I
[188.0s] enjoyed being on with you a couple weeks
[189.48s] ago I said the last shall be first and
[191.2s] what are we seeing today we&#39;re seeing
[192.959s] materials we&#39;re seeing health care we&#39;re
[194.76s] seeing Industrials start to outperform
[197.599s] and the reason is simple business
[199.4s] friendly friendly environment cut taxes
[202.879s] uh great environment for these type of
[204.64s] businesses moving forward and price is
[207.159s] what you pay value is what you get so we
[209.319s] came into the year with the mag 7 having
[212.08s] decelerating earnings growth uh uh for a
[215.56s] high multiple decelerating to 21%
[217.519s] earnings growth for 33 times versus the
[220.28s] rest of the market at a much lower
[221.799s] multiple and money is finding its way
[223.72s] into the Great Value there I know but so
[226.04s] we only have 30 seconds left I&#39;m looking
[228.0s] at Boeing on your list it takes a lot of
[230.84s] crossing your fingers to bet on Boeing
[232.72s] right now or you&#39;re
[234.12s] happy well the big thing is with
[236.239s] turnarounds the key is solvency risk and
[238.76s] Kelly ortberg took care of that by
[240.64s] raising $20 billion of cash they still
[243.159s] have a duopoly they still have a half a
[245.28s] trillion dollar backlog so we like
[247.799s] Boeing we like that story and Trump has
[250.599s] said he wants the rest of the world
[252.56s] spending massively on defense spending
[255.28s] Boeing is going to be a beneficiary we
[257.479s] like that story continuing Thomas Hayes
[259.68s] thank you so much penny for your
[261.6s] thoughts as well so let&#39;s take a look at
[263.759s] this we&#39;re firmly in record territory
[265.44s] the
[266.24s] S&amp;P and we&#39;re back uh on to the next
[270.28s] this was a special segment I I did uh on
[273.4s] the floor of the New York Stock Exchange

[328.84s] chairman of great Hill Capital hello
[331.28s] guys and today we are going to be
[333.12s] talking about guess what we got Warren
[335.16s] Buffett we got David teer talking about
[337.24s] value and macro and no spoiler alert
[339.919s] we&#39;ve got them in a finale you do not
[342.0s] want to miss our word of the day or
[344.16s] phrase of the day is vssd stands for
[346.68s] volatility spreads and duration how the
[349.24s] pros use these terms to read the bond
[351.0s] market tea leaves and this episode is
[353.24s] brought to you by the number
[354.88s] 21% that is how much The Magnificent
[357.24s] Seven profits are expected to grow this
[359.759s] year which happens to be exactly the
[361.84s] same for the S&amp;P 600 that&#39;s small caps
[364.759s] it&#39;s a 2025 Davy Goliath Market Showdown
[367.84s] but we before we get to some of the more
[369.8s] jargon busting uh parts of this show Tom
[372.52s] why don&#39;t you just give us your big
[373.599s] picture overview of where we are in the
[375.44s] markets right now yeah I think uh for
[377.56s] 2025 we can expect a good good year
[381.68s] however not quite as good as 2024 uh
[384.72s] we&#39;re we&#39;re kind of looking at high
[386.759s] single digits to low double digits but I
[388.8s] think the real story is going to be the
[391.56s] rotation what is going to drive those
[393.8s] gains and what is holding back bigger
[396.44s] gains and that that has to do with
[398.039s] rotation that we&#39;re going to talk about
[399.639s] all right great so you are a value
[401.24s] investor we want to start with another
[403.16s] VW vstd which really doesn&#39;t have a lot
[405.56s] to do with value but we&#39;re going to talk
[406.88s] about it anyway we got volatility spread
[409.44s] and duration so taking them one at a
[411.36s] time volatility it measures price swings
[414.319s] and then spreads that shows the
[416.039s] difference in in yields between two
[417.879s] different bonds so how far apart they
[419.72s] are and then we have duration which
[421.639s] measures how sensitive a bond is to
[423.56s] changes in interest rates so if the FED
[425.919s] raises or lowers rates how does that
[427.919s] Bond react to it and I&#39;m just wondering
[430.84s] how you use this information to judge
[433.08s] what&#39;s happening right now because we&#39;ve
[434.44s] seen huge rises in the tenure t-note
[436.68s] yield which has been pressuring R risk
[438.84s] markets you know it&#39;s interesting uh
[440.919s] what we&#39;re seeing in the last few weeks
[444.16s] is exactly what we saw after Trump 1.0
[447.4s] after the election before the
[448.72s] inauguration
[450.08s] and what what basically happened in 2016
[452.4s] he ran on being tariff man and the king
[454.919s] of debt so what did the markets do as
[457.319s] soon as he was elected dollar rallied
[460.44s] yields blew out uh emerging markets and
[463.84s] international stocks sold off and then
[466.44s] after the inauguration what&#39;s surprising
[468.52s] to most people that they forget is that
[470.72s] bonds actually rallied yields compressed
[473.0s] the dollar came down and and
[475.0s] international stocks did exceptionally
[476.56s] well China had one of its best years
[478.599s] ever in 200 17 after the inauguration so
[481.759s] I think there&#39;s a lot of bark to the
[483.599s] headlines but but more modest bite
[486.28s] because that bark is used as negotiation
[488.4s] tactic and I think we&#39;re going to see uh
[490.8s] a period in
[492.599s] 2025 that&#39;s similar to 2017 in that how
[497.44s] people are positioned today before the
[499.919s] inauguration uh is probably a little bit
[502.44s] off sides to how the year is going to go
[504.68s] and H you want to go ahead how do you
[506.52s] how do you see this playing out though
[507.599s] so you&#39;re a value investor tell us like
[509.759s] how you see this playing out sector-wise
[511.68s] or style-wise yeah I think in terms of
[514.8s] sectors uh what drove the boat late last
[517.68s] year was The Magnificent 7 and what you
[520.519s] saw with the Magnificent 7 was they had
[523.64s] meaningful earnings growth 33% earnings
[525.839s] growth last year uh that is actually
[529.08s] decelerating in 2025 it&#39;s crazy to thing
[532.24s] but it&#39;s decelerating down to 211% but
[535.44s] the difference is the multiple has
[537.6s] remained elevated so the multiple has
[539.44s] has not been derated with the earnings
[541.079s] growth uh conversely you look at
[543.04s] something like small caps had anemic
[545.6s] earnings growth the small cap 600 which
[547.519s] is the more profitable index uh is going
[549.8s] to grow from 8% earnings growth to 21%
[552.0s] earnings growth but rather than paying
[553.32s] 33 times you&#39;re paying 16 times so I
[555.8s] think you&#39;re going to find the real
[557.079s] opportunity in the
[559.839s] unmagnify in international in small caps
[563.2s] and that&#39;s why we&#39;re going to see more
[564.6s] subdued index returns uh of 8 to 12%
[568.519s] because uh mag 7 is such a heavy weight
[571.04s] and if they don&#39;t outperform the indices
[572.92s] aren&#39;t going to go very far so what are
[574.8s] some of your investment ideas that
[576.959s] aren&#39;t mag s that are more 593 sorry
[580.44s] 4993 I gave more uh Wells you want to do
[584.399s] some audit uh Auto stocks you you ready
[586.68s] to go to sleep now these These are
[588.32s] exciting stocks uh I&#39;ve got one on the
[590.6s] retail side and one on the wholesale
[592.279s] side so the one on the retail side is
[594.24s] called Advan Auto Parts uh this stock is
[596.88s] down 80% and why because it was manag
[599.92s] they overexpanded everyone knows Advance
[602.24s] Auto you know they see it in their local
[603.959s] area if they don&#39;t see O&#39;Reilly if they
[605.56s] don&#39;t see auto can hear the I can hear
[607.36s] the jingle yes yeah exactly so uh
[610.36s] effectively Shane o Kelly came in he ran
[612.88s] HD Supply for Home Depot a$7 billion
[615.56s] business Harvard MBA West Point serious
[617.959s] guy came in about a year ago to turn the
[620.04s] thing around after they destroyed it uh
[622.72s] what he did immediately was he took
[624.519s] solvency risk off the table how did he
[626.64s] do that he sold the Canada business
[628.72s] raised one .5 billion of cash the
[631.04s] westpack business paid down debt and now
[634.2s] he&#39;s closing the unprofitable
[636.839s] non-performing stores on the west coast
[639.2s] and part of the reason they&#39;re not
[641.16s] performing is because they are spread
[643.639s] out so you don&#39;t get economies a scale
[645.48s] with the distribution hubs so he&#39;s
[647.24s] shutting that down that&#39;s 10% of stores
[649.92s] uh he is expanding stores in the in the
[651.959s] markets on in the Northeast and on the
[653.8s] East Coast where he&#39;s number one and two
[656.0s] consolidating the distribution centers
[658.399s] here&#39;s all you need to know his Target
[660.16s] for 2027 is $630 million in operating
[663.44s] income they&#39;ve done that four times
[665.88s] before uh 2018 2019 and two other years
[670.279s] every single time that they hit that
[672.44s] marker the stock traded between $180 and
[675.079s] $220 a share it&#39;s a $45 stock right now
[678.2s] you can&#39;t give it away maybe three times
[679.959s] appreciation I love that you have
[682.079s] specific investment picks like this how
[684.48s] do you go about stock picking because
[686.32s] you&#39;ve been on our err many times
[688.56s] screener yeah and and you you always
[691.32s] have like an interesting ideas and
[693.24s] specific ideas how does an average
[695.399s] person get specific ideas as opposed to
[697.76s] just investing in
[699.079s] ETFs yeah I think uh one it comes from
[702.0s] experience two I&#39;ll give you the advice
[703.76s] that Warren Buffett gives everyone which
[705.32s] is read the intelligent investor by Ben
[707.12s] Graham and once you can understand that
[710.0s] the price that you see on your screen
[712.04s] can sometimes deviate and sometimes
[713.88s] deviate materially from the underlying
[716.0s] fundamentals of the business that&#39;s when
[718.16s] you that you read that book and one of
[720.56s] two things is going to happen one it
[721.92s] puts you to sleep find another career
[724.079s] there are many ways to make money many
[725.519s] paths to the top of the mountain number
[727.04s] two the light bulb goes off and it
[728.399s] changes your life that&#39;s what happened
[729.72s] to me and every day like Buffett talks
[732.16s] about I skip to work because it&#39;s like a
[733.72s] treasure hunt uh there is nowhere else
[736.48s] in the world other than public markets
[738.92s] where the price can get so dislocated
[741.36s] from the underlying value either due to
[743.32s] force selling structural selling over
[746.199s] emotion you know for some of the prices
[748.68s] that I pay for business it&#39;s like if I
[750.04s] went into Advanced Auto Parts board
[751.68s] today and I said I&#39;ll take out the
[753.68s] entire company JP Morgan&#39;s going to
[755.44s] finance me on the debt side I&#39;ll put up
[757.959s] some of the equity I&#39;ll raise some
[759.36s] Equity we&#39;ll buy the entire company at
[761.32s] $45 a share I can guarantee you sounds
[764.279s] wonderful they would call security and
[766.48s] have me escorted out of the building
[767.88s] because they think I&#39;m absolutely Al
[769.0s] Looney to never in a million years would
[771.36s] they sell their business at $45 a share
[773.92s] so um so those are the opportunities and
[776.44s] that&#39;s actually one of my filters is
[778.12s] would the board have me ask Ed out if I
[780.24s] offer to buy the entire business at the
[783.32s] price that was quoted in the market and
[785.48s] uh and if the and if the answer is no
[787.36s] they would take the meeting then that&#39;s
[788.839s] probably not the stock for me Tom
[791.44s] speaking of value here value um has
[794.12s] actually been the dominant probably
[796.519s] Factor if you want to call that in the
[797.959s] market going back a hundred years but
[799.88s] not this Century it&#39;s really only come
[801.8s] in a few places comeing to vogan a few
[804.279s] places and we&#39;ve I&#39;ve sat with a lot of
[806.16s] guests and they&#39;ve said that low
[808.079s] perpetually low interest rates that
[809.959s] we&#39;ve seen this Century kind of killed
[812.0s] off the macro trade that you know you&#39;re
[814.16s] used to these boom bus Cycles but it&#39;s
[815.959s] changed the game it did change the game
[818.04s] so much and only now are we normalizing
[820.48s] so is this finally the time for Value
[823.199s] yeah we we ring the bell on this show uh
[827.36s] look value is the cheapest relative to
[829.639s] growth since 1980 number one since
[833.199s] 200000 number two both of those years
[836.04s] were generational buy opportunities to
[838.399s] buy if you remember the covers in 1999
[841.92s] 2000 Warren Buffett has lost his touch
[845.04s] that was the headlin except he was using
[847.24s] that opportunity while everyone was
[848.519s] buying Cisco and Global Crossing and
[850.6s] Enron he was buying value stocks and he
[853.12s] had dramatically outperformed 2,000 2001
[856.12s] 2002 2003 2004 20056 you get the point
[860.32s] and if you look back through history we
[862.639s] get blinded as investors by recency bias
[865.399s] and recency bias tells you since 2010
[868.12s] growth has kicked Val&#39;s butt okay and
[870.519s] there&#39;s no two ways about it since
[873.399s] 1927 value has outperformed growth not
[876.199s] by a little by
[878.24s] 45% per year every single year including
[881.519s] the last 15 years not compounding that&#39;s
[883.48s] it yeah yes if you believe we&#39;re
[885.48s] normalizing interest rates and you don&#39;t
[887.639s] have exposure to the 493 or or some
[890.639s] level of value I think you&#39;re going to
[892.36s] find yourself left in your dust I&#39;m not
[894.6s] saying shift your portfolio overnight
[896.88s] and go all value because we don&#39;t know
[898.48s] no one can predict the future but what I
[900.36s] am saying is if you can buy a high
[902.44s] quality business at a reasonable price
[904.44s] right now you want to start to do that
[905.839s] in a normalizing environment and that&#39;s
[907.44s] exactly what we&#39;re doing would you would
[908.8s] you do that with an ETF like buy V or
[912.0s] some value ETF or are you stock picking
[913.92s] are you do you really need to find the
[915.56s] winners and avoid the losers there yeah
[918.199s] I think I think you run into if you wind
[921.24s] up in a basket you know there&#39;s the term
[923.199s] value traps so the turnarounds I look
[925.32s] for it&#39;s not just like it&#39;s cheap
[927.279s] because you can get stuck in cheap for
[929.04s] long time I&#39;m looking for catalysts of
[930.92s] change in many cases it&#39;s the new CEO
[934.319s] okay so for instance we were just joking
[936.279s] you like Vans I have three we have we
[938.48s] have three pairs of the same see now
[940.959s] that&#39;s not going to happen I had to
[941.959s] endure this conversation already so so
[944.36s] look let me tell you about vans so Vans
[946.6s] I went on uh a network last year the
[949.279s] stock was trading at 13 or $14 down from
[952.0s] $83 and the host looked at me like I had
[954.36s] two heads I said look I&#39;m betting on
[956.56s] Brack and Daryl this guy was at Logitech
[959.04s] back in 2013 when the stock was down
[962.04s] 82% okay here&#39;s what happened over the
[964.48s] next decade if you invested it was less
[966.959s] than a decade if you invested $1 million
[969.319s] when Bracken took the Helm of Logitech
[971.6s] you made $26 million 26 bagger talk
[975.279s] about turn around and this is not you
[977.24s] know they weren&#39;t curing cancer these
[978.6s] are commoditized camera and mice and
[981.72s] keyboards which you could get anywhere
[983.04s] else but somehow this guy figured out
[984.44s] how to Brand Logitech to The Gamers and
[986.68s] the game was on he&#39;s doing the exact
[988.44s] same thing and not only does VF Corp own
[990.92s] Vans which has struggled by the way it
[992.639s] peaked during covid everyone bought Vans
[995.16s] for three years ago they&#39;ve got three
[996.959s] three there&#39;s there&#39;s a surfing Vibe
[998.48s] early on in the pandemic didn&#39;t pan out
[1000.399s] exactly didn&#39;t didn&#39;t pan out so they&#39;ve
[1002.92s] worked through that so now they they&#39;ve
[1004.92s] gone through the dstock cycle they&#39;re
[1006.199s] going to the restock cycle but by the
[1007.519s] way they own Northface which did just
[1009.8s] did a collaboration with Kim Kardashian
[1011.8s] on skims they sold out within a matter
[1014.6s] of days the young kids are wearing the
[1017.24s] new school where the where the wave
[1019.36s] thing pops out from the side side of the
[1021.36s] thing so he&#39;s changing the game they&#39;re
[1023.0s] they&#39;re selling out you couldn&#39;t even
[1024.199s] get them in Christmas because they were
[1025.36s] selling out then he owns North he owns
[1027.799s] North Face he owns uh Timberland Dickies
[1031.319s] so he&#39;s got a portfolio he sold off
[1033.039s] Supreme to do what same thing that you
[1035.28s] saw with Shane o Kelly take solvency
[1037.72s] risk off the table that is number one in
[1039.36s] a turnaround story sold Supreme for $1.5
[1042.039s] billion dollars paid down the debt now
[1044.12s] they&#39;ve got the runway to turnaround
[1045.799s] Vans uh uh Northface is doing great as
[1049.36s] Asia comes back it&#39;ll do even better
[1051.559s] Timberland Dickies you name it you got
[1053.559s] it I mean Bracken is a winner and he&#39;s
[1056.0s] gonna he&#39;s going to turn this thing
[1057.16s] around so the stock is now up from 1314
[1059.64s] to 2122 down from 80 I think this can
[1062.48s] double again over the next couple of
[1063.88s] years hold that thought we need to take
[1065.64s] a short break but coming up we&#39;ve got a
[1067.6s] DAV and Goliath showdown between the mag
[1069.6s] seven and small caps then another
[1071.76s] Showdown on the runway featuring two
[1073.6s] iconic hedge fund Le Legends it is
[1076.0s] Buffett versus teer coming up
[1081.14s] [Music]
[1085.88s] all right we are back and this episode
[1087.679s] is brought to you by the number 21% that
[1090.559s] is the expected growth in earnings per
[1092.559s] share or profits of the mag 7 this year
[1095.64s] and it&#39;s also the expected EPS growth
[1097.96s] for the S&amp;P 600 which covers small caps
[1101.0s] the key difference is what we call the
[1102.799s] multiple or how much you need to
[1104.0s] multiply the stock price to get to that
[1105.679s] number so the multiple on the mag 7 is
[1107.96s] 33 the multiple on the S&amp;P 600 that
[1111.0s] small cap index is half of that
[1112.72s] basically 16 tell us about how you use
[1115.52s] this information yeah this is huge so
[1117.799s] when I&#39;m allocating this year I want to
[1119.64s] find special and unique situations in
[1121.64s] small cap why because I get the same
[1123.84s] growth for half the multiple price is
[1125.679s] what you pay value is what you get and
[1127.6s] the second Auto stock that I wanted to
[1129.28s] talk about is a small cap in particular
[1131.52s] it&#39;s called Cooper standard this stock
[1133.88s] is down not 80% this stock is down 90%
[1137.6s] okay same thing that happened they took
[1139.4s] solvency risk off the table they
[1140.88s] refinanced the debt all this is is a
[1143.679s] play on increasing volumes and if you
[1146.6s] remember from December volumes came in
[1148.919s] it surprised everyone 16.8 million
[1151.32s] annualized what you&#39;ve seen over the
[1152.919s] last 45 years is North American sell
[1156.0s] through
[1157.08s] sa uh it it it Peaks and troughs between
[1160.799s] 15.3 million to 17.1 the last time you
[1164.64s] had a peak was
[1166.32s] 2017 at 177.1 this company earned $7 a
[1169.76s] share and traded at
[1171.2s] $146 we started buying it at five and
[1173.679s] change it&#39;s now up to 13 and change um
[1177.08s] we believe that the next time we hit 17
[1179.24s] million in volumes they&#39;re not only
[1180.4s] going to earn $7 they&#39;re going to earn
[1182.2s] $10 a share because they&#39;ve taken $400
[1184.32s] million a cost out so these are the
[1186.52s] special unique situations in small caps
[1189.159s] where you can get involved uh you can
[1191.799s] take a risk you&#39;re not going to put your
[1193.72s] whole portfolio in a small cap stock you
[1195.799s] want to be careful and you you want to
[1197.32s] have a a portfolio
[1199.159s] 10 15 20 stocks you know the less
[1202.12s] confidence you have the more Diversified
[1204.48s] you need to be um the more you know buff
[1208.159s] buffet and Monger used to always say uh
[1211.4s] divers diversification is a hedge
[1213.36s] against not knowing what you&#39;re
[1215.08s] doing or some would call that
[1216.919s] inconfidence but yeah bigger picture do
[1220.28s] you have like a percentage breakdown you
[1222.32s] recommend for growth and value and large
[1225.64s] cap and small cap for people to be
[1227.32s] invested in yeah that&#39;s you know that&#39;s
[1230.4s] going to depend on their unique goals uh
[1233.12s] that&#39;s something that they definitely
[1234.08s] want to talk to a financial adviser
[1235.4s] because at different ages you want to
[1236.76s] have different levels of risk I deal
[1238.919s] exclusively with family offices and
[1240.919s] ultra high net worth accredited and
[1242.72s] qualified investors so um so that&#39;s
[1245.44s] really going to depend where you&#39;re at I
[1246.84s] think for a lot of people what makes
[1248.6s] sense is to passively index the bulk of
[1250.76s] their money and then if they have a
[1252.32s] small bucket where they want to start to
[1254.44s] learn and start to experience and start
[1256.52s] to experiment they&#39;re doing it with a
[1257.84s] very small and as they grow confidence
[1259.76s] and grow experience and grow knowledge
[1261.84s] then they can expand that bucket over
[1263.4s] time we but we&#39;ve had a number of people
[1265.44s] guess on this show that have told Sid
[1267.0s] and looked Us in the eye and said well
[1268.679s] you&#39;re young well they looked Sid in the
[1270.279s] eye not me said you&#39;re young uh you
[1272.48s] don&#39;t need the you don&#39;t need the rest
[1274.2s] of the S&amp;P 500 you just need the NASDAQ
[1276.48s] you need some of the growth year stocks
[1278.08s] you don&#39;t need bonds what would you say
[1279.88s] to that yeah they said that in late 90s
[1283.24s] also I mean look I don&#39;t think this is
[1285.6s] the late 990s I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect a
[1287.44s] tech rack I do expect consolidation of
[1289.44s] some of these gains and some reating of
[1291.36s] the multiples um you know Sydney
[1295.039s] probably has to speak to her financial
[1296.559s] advisor about that uh I thought you were
[1299.0s] advising me right now but if you if you
[1300.6s] were my sister I&#39;d put you in a good
[1302.159s] good a few good companies and then I&#39;d
[1303.88s] probably have you indexing the rest so
[1305.4s] you slept well at night and you were
[1307.039s] comfortable with that uh and then over
[1309.48s] time you you could build up as the
[1311.08s] profits and as your account grew and uh
[1312.96s] as you got more comfortable with with
[1314.48s] that what about small caps though are
[1316.279s] those for and as the the group would you
[1318.96s] trade the Russell or the S&amp;P 600 or
[1320.76s] you&#39;re just looking for individual yeah
[1323.12s] I mean we only you know we run a very
[1324.64s] concentrated book of 8 to 12 stocks uh
[1327.52s] is our portfolio different ball game for
[1329.08s] you different ball game uh I would say
[1331.72s] though that um I would start to ease
[1335.159s] into an uh a small cap index do it small
[1338.6s] if you&#39;re like 90% in like a 6040
[1341.559s] portfolio maybe you maybe you put 5 10%
[1345.24s] into small caps and start to lean in
[1346.919s] that way the other thing you can do some
[1348.679s] people index with uh the S&amp;P 500 there&#39;s
[1351.559s] a Vanguard ETF vti which is a more is a
[1355.159s] broader number of companies that you&#39;ll
[1357.159s] catch some of the small caps in that
[1358.84s] it&#39;s another way to index but with more
[1360.44s] exposure less concentration to the mag 7
[1362.96s] that&#39;s another thing to think about as
[1364.279s] well there&#39;s a there&#39;s a new S&amp;P 500 ETF
[1367.52s] that will not weight any stock more than
[1369.799s] 3% so it&#39;s not quite equal weight it&#39;s
[1371.679s] not just all kinds of interesting
[1373.72s] products coming out like that uh if you
[1375.84s] don&#39;t have anything I I have one thing
[1377.36s] about diversification
[1380.0s] I&#39;ve asked but if you&#39;re if you have a
[1383.039s] long rway is there something valid to
[1386.32s] just like putting a little bit of money
[1387.88s] in every S&amp;P sector is that is that this
[1390.72s] is a recurring thought like how can I
[1392.279s] get it all catch them all because people
[1394.0s] say diversification I&#39;m like what does
[1395.76s] that really mean like stocks bonds sure
[1399.48s] but like a little bit of money sounds
[1401.279s] like a good excuse for not knowing what
[1402.52s] you&#39;re talking exactly well I think um
[1405.559s] you&#39;re getting that effectively through
[1407.0s] the S&amp;P 500 so if you you know if you if
[1409.559s] you look at uh the spider sector ETFs
[1412.84s] and then you look at the Holdings of
[1414.12s] each of them you&#39;re going to see like
[1415.36s] the top 10 Holdings are S&amp;P component so
[1418.0s] effectively by doing that what that
[1419.44s] would change is your weighting so if you
[1420.919s] went equal weight by sector but that
[1422.84s] means you&#39;re going to have equal weight
[1424.039s] materials against equal weight uh Tech
[1427.0s] which by the way is not a horrible idea
[1428.64s] for 2025 I&#39;ll tell you why yes please do
[1431.52s] uh the two worst performing among the
[1433.6s] worst performing sectors were Healthcare
[1436.36s] and materials had low singled digigit
[1440.2s] returns in 2025 relative to the S&amp;P over
[1442.76s] 20 20% here&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen in
[1444.72s] 2025 they have among the highest
[1446.799s] expected earnings growth Healthcare is
[1448.52s] going to grow earnings 20.4% which is
[1451.32s] more than the S&amp;P 500 of 13 14% And
[1455.279s] materials is going to grow earnings
[1457.52s] 17.4% so as a catch-up trade that
[1460.279s] becomes very very interesting I have a
[1461.84s] materials name if you&#39;re interested but
[1463.559s] otherwise we might get to that in a
[1465.039s] second here first we got to get to
[1466.279s] today&#39;s who wore it better we have two
[1468.44s] iconic investing investing Legends
[1470.48s] marching down the red carpet it is on
[1472.76s] one side the Oracle of Omaha Warren
[1474.799s] Buffett himself squaring off against the
[1477.36s] ma master of macro David teer Buffett
[1480.24s] the steadfast value investor who build
[1482.039s] his Empire on patience discipline and
[1484.159s] the occasional cigar butt strategy he is
[1486.48s] the epitome of Jesse livermore&#39;s buy it
[1488.84s] right and sit tight strategy on the
[1491.2s] other side you&#39;ve got teer a guy who
[1493.2s] just doesn&#39;t play the markets he moves
[1495.08s] them with just a few words on financial
[1496.96s] TV he stared down the global financial
[1499.399s] crisis and famously said load up the
[1501.799s] truck so in this battle of investing
[1504.12s] icons who wears the market better is it
[1506.48s] Buffett&#39;s Timeless value Playbook that
[1508.559s] shines in high rate environments or
[1510.32s] teers all weather Global macro tool kit
[1512.72s] ready to pounce on any opportunity here
[1516.039s] all right long-term Buffet hands down
[1520.0s] near-term Tepper I&#39;ll tell you why teer
[1522.2s] sure this is people are going to tune
[1523.84s] out when I say this uh I hope not it&#39;s
[1526.399s] certainly going to be controversial so
[1528.32s] keer went on TV a few months ago talking
[1530.279s] about China and and people vomited all
[1532.559s] over their desks once they heard that
[1534.44s] okay his number one position is Alibaba
[1536.799s] right now look I&#39;ve been wrong about
[1538.52s] Alibaba for over a year we just keep
[1540.64s] buying it and buying it and buying it
[1542.12s] because price is what you pay value is
[1543.76s] what you get it&#39;s the lowest amount of
[1545.679s] price for the greatest amount of value
[1547.24s] right now in the international market so
[1549.399s] if you think that there&#39;s more bark to
[1551.64s] Trump than bite and he wants to do a
[1553.399s] deal with China like we saw after the
[1555.72s] election in 2000 after the inauguration
[1557.96s] in 2017 when Alibaba went from $85 not
[1562.52s] coincidentally where it is right now to
[1564.36s] $187 in 11 months you might want to take
[1567.039s] a look at that there&#39;s something that
[1569.039s] has been happening in China for the last
[1570.96s] year year and a half is that they&#39;ve
[1572.48s] been doing this peac mail stimulus over
[1574.36s] and over and over and over very
[1576.08s] peacemeal but it&#39;s all building up and
[1578.039s] when it happens it&#39;s going to be uh very
[1581.0s] quickly and Alibaba is the tollkeeper
[1582.919s] it&#39;s the Tollgate for the middle class
[1584.6s] when they start spending they get a
[1586.2s] piece of all the action they&#39;ve got uh
[1588.48s] of all the AI startups if you want to
[1590.44s] play a China AI ETF it&#39;s called Alibaba
[1593.279s] why because every single a they are a
[1595.559s] seed fund every single AI startup goes
[1598.32s] to Alibaba and says we need Cloud we
[1600.279s] need uh AI tools we need all of this
[1602.6s] stuff and they say it&#39;s free just give
[1604.64s] us Equity we we&#39;ve got Equity as owners
[1607.0s] of Alibaba in pretty much every AI
[1609.279s] startup in China this is huge and and
[1611.919s] it&#39;s has zero value oh by the way they
[1614.0s] generate $25 billion of free cash flow
[1616.279s] every year oh by the way they&#39;re sitting
[1617.76s] on $ 55 billion of cash not a bad runway
[1620.84s] for a turnaround situation uh they can
[1623.72s] also lock up jackma at any time so there
[1625.72s] is risk there yeah well good news is
[1627.679s] he&#39;s out of the picture so lock lock him
[1629.6s] away uh I would say that um if China
[1633.44s] turns this thing is going it and I
[1635.88s] wouldn&#39;t even say if because this is
[1637.6s] actually what it looks like I know I
[1639.039s] don&#39;t have a lot of gray hairs but I but
[1640.64s] I&#39;ve been around and Jared knows I&#39;ve
[1642.52s] seen these cycles and and the last time
[1644.799s] China was this despondent was uh that
[1648.44s] would it happens every few years
[1650.76s] 2016 okay uh then you had 2009 then you
[1655.12s] had 2 2001 as the as the money moved out
[1658.32s] of US tech it moved into China Tech so
[1661.399s] look it&#39;s not a popular one it&#39;s why we
[1663.08s] own more than one stock okay you you
[1664.96s] can&#39;t be certain about anything but when
[1666.559s] it moves it&#39;s not going to be a little
[1668.2s] move it&#39;s going to be a big move and
[1669.36s] it&#39;s not going to let anyone in and I
[1670.72s] just don&#39;t know when that is I think
[1671.96s] it&#39;s imminent teer thinks it&#39;s imminent
[1673.88s] but no one knows Tom we&#39;re racing to the
[1676.12s] finish here what is your number one
[1678.279s] investment tip for
[1679.76s] 2025 I think that what you want to do is
[1684.84s] lighten up a little bit on mag 7 if
[1687.6s] you&#39;re overweight and if you&#39;re in
[1689.039s] indices whether you like it or not
[1690.519s] you&#39;re overweight some 40% index waiting
[1693.96s] uh is the mag 7 I think it&#39;s a it&#39;s
[1696.48s] trading at a little premium you know I
[1698.559s] joke Jensen Wong may be flying a little
[1700.6s] bit too close to the Sun like Icarus the
[1703.08s] good news is his wings haven&#39;t started
[1704.72s] to melt yet but at 51 times earning 30
[1708.679s] times sales decelerating growth still
[1711.36s] great growth but decelerating it you
[1713.799s] know having been through many
[1715.44s] semiconductor Cycles The Narrative is
[1718.08s] the same competition is coming right now
[1720.279s] the wings are fine because there&#39;s no
[1722.08s] competition competition will come all
[1723.919s] right we got to leave it there Tom I&#39;m
[1725.6s] thinking about becoming a value investor
[1727.2s] when I grow up but for now we got to
[1728.679s] wind things down here at stocks and

[1745.799s] podcast and we&#39;re back and then I had
[1749.279s] the pleasure to join the great David
[1751.84s] Lynn who has one of the most vibrant
[1754.919s] active audiences you could imagine you
[1757.32s] go on his show your phone rings like
[1759.08s] crazy because he&#39;s so good at asking
[1761.32s] questions and digging deep so we&#39;re
[1763.279s] listening here the purchasers of these
[1766.6s] technologies will be required by their
[1769.799s] investors to get a return on investment
[1772.24s] so they either lower the spend and risk
[1774.76s] seeding market share to their
[1776.84s] competition or they get more compute
[1780.159s] power per dollar of spend competition
[1783.08s] catches up and it&#39;s a race to the bottom
[1785.2s] for margins and this time will be no
[1787.279s] different well the selloff in January
[1788.96s] continue well after the inauguration
[1790.84s] we&#39;ll find out with Thomas Hayes
[1792.279s] managing member of great Hill Capital he
[1793.96s] also break down his sector allocation
[1796.399s] preferences and uh value versus growth
[1799.159s] an interesting theme for 2025 Thomas
[1801.159s] welcome back to the show happy new year
[1803.12s] thanks for having me David let&#39;s take a
[1804.84s] look at my screen right now this is the
[1806.48s] S&amp;P 500 ever since uh basically the uh
[1809.799s] top in December it&#39;s down roughly um 5%
[1814.44s] or so is this just a seasonal pullback
[1817.159s] that we&#39;re seeing or is uncertainty
[1819.279s] around the Trump Administration starting
[1820.96s] to pile up here yeah I think uh it&#39;s not
[1824.0s] dissimilar to the volatility we saw
[1826.12s] after the election in 2016 Trump 1.0
[1830.519s] through the inauguration 2017 and then
[1833.24s] things kind of normalized I think what&#39;s
[1835.12s] got people sideways is yields blowing
[1838.24s] out 10-year yield accelerating first you
[1841.44s] had uh the FED uncertainty in December
[1844.64s] and then you had that super strong jobs
[1847.12s] report which uh worried the market that
[1850.0s] maybe we&#39;re not going to get the two
[1851.48s] cuts that the FED projected in their uh
[1854.44s] SCP and instead uh now we&#39;re at only 70%
[1858.84s] of one cut by October and the market is
[1862.08s] adjusting to that and and if you look at
[1863.919s] the general indices uh it&#39;s almost
[1866.039s] misleading you know you had Industrials
[1867.96s] small caps down almost 10% it was pretty
[1871.12s] violent interruption in December you you
[1874.24s] had seen a trend of regular broadening
[1878.039s] healthy broadening since July of last
[1880.36s] year and then uh as we got through the
[1883.519s] election and into that fed issue in
[1886.799s] December uh really an Abrupt pause in
[1890.039s] that in that broadening theme and I I do
[1892.2s] think we&#39;re going to resume that for a
[1893.6s] number of reasons we can cover today the
[1895.88s] 10e yield is that a signal of strength
[1898.32s] in the economy or expectations for
[1900.399s] further strength in the economy or
[1901.799s] simply that the inflation expectations
[1904.12s] are being pushed out higher uh which may
[1906.24s] or may not be good for
[1907.519s] equities it depends who you talk
[1910.2s] to I mean you know if you look at the
[1913.039s] University of Michigan uh uh inflation
[1915.799s] expectations jumped up a little bit
[1918.519s] uh last week both on the one-year and
[1920.639s] threeyear uh expectation to
[1924.36s] 3.3% that is embedded in the consumers
[1928.12s] expectation of tariffs increasing prices
[1932.6s] now you have seen the administration
[1934.519s] leak a couple of things number one maybe
[1936.88s] it&#39;ll be targeted to certain industries
[1939.679s] or subsets and number two it might be
[1942.519s] gradual we&#39;ve been of the camp it won&#39;t
[1945.24s] be as bad as advertised I think the
[1947.919s] advertisement was 60% tariffs across the
[1950.76s] board uh I think that&#39;s going to be more
[1953.24s] more modest and more reasonable like we
[1955.48s] saw in Trump 1.0 uh then on the flip
[1959.44s] side you do have uh the fact that the
[1962.36s] economy is growing you know you&#39;re
[1963.919s] you&#39;re gonna have mid teens earnings
[1965.6s] growth so uh there&#39;s a view that yields
[1970.08s] are expanding due to that and then
[1973.0s] there&#39;s a third Viewpoint that you got
[1974.679s] to issue9 trillion of debt to refinance
[1977.84s] in 2025 so that uh yields are blowing
[1981.679s] out in excess but what I will say is I&#39;m
[1985.24s] more of the camp that this is exactly
[1987.32s] what happened between the election and
[1989.639s] the inauguration in 2016 to 2017 Trump
[1993.559s] ran as the king of debt uh the king of
[1997.919s] the Tariff King uh he&#39;s run on the exact
[2000.919s] same platform in uh
[2003.84s] 2024 and the market is trying to digest
[2007.279s] to what extent will he be the king of
[2009.72s] these two initiatives uh and uh we&#39;re
[2012.919s] taking the under the market right now is
[2015.0s] taking the over I think the market is
[2017.279s] overestimating because as you saw in
[2019.519s] 2016 to 2007 17 while the dollar rallied
[2024.6s] after the November election and bonds
[2027.679s] yields uh really accelerated after the
[2030.36s] election after the
[2031.639s] inauguration bonds got bid yields
[2034.039s] compressed for the next year plus the
[2036.12s] dollar rolled over International stocks
[2039.0s] took off biotech stocks took off oil
[2042.0s] stocks collapsed uh so it was the exact
[2045.559s] opposite of what everyone was expecting
[2047.72s] and we think it could be some version of
[2049.56s] that rhyming not repeating yes and as a
[2053.44s] hedge fund manager are you positioned
[2055.399s] for more of a pullback right now or is
[2057.96s] it still risk on for you generally
[2060.079s] speaking uh we run a concentrated Equity
[2063.72s] portfolio that has a very low
[2065.879s] correlation to the S&amp;P 500 weights so
[2069.48s] the businesses we buy we we enter we do
[2073.079s] a lot of turnarounds and we&#39;re buying at
[2075.32s] a point in time where we feel the margin
[2077.52s] of safety is Extreme meaning that if the
[2081.839s] business was liquidated tomorrow we
[2083.599s] would make a profit if the turnaround
[2085.639s] plan plays we make a double or triple
[2087.599s] over a few years and and in some cases
[2090.56s] multibagger uh so we&#39;re less concerned
[2093.399s] with what the Market&#39;s doing on a
[2094.639s] day-to-day basis if the market pulled
[2096.639s] back 20% % uh in the next couple months
[2099.88s] it wouldn&#39;t change one view on any of
[2101.839s] the eight or 12 core positions in the
[2104.2s] portfolio uh and uh and and very likely
[2107.839s] if the indices pulled back which we
[2109.68s] don&#39;t anticipate anything of that
[2111.2s] magnitude but if they pulled back
[2113.2s] materially what that would tell me more
[2115.92s] likely is that the rotation that we&#39;ve
[2118.599s] been talking about is playing out
[2120.88s] because the indices pulling back is is
[2123.48s] evidence of the mag 7 predominantly
[2126.88s] getting hit because of the weights in
[2128.52s] the index and uh and and we&#39;re going to
[2131.56s] make our money in the 493 and
[2133.56s] international prospectively which would
[2135.8s] be less impacted by the overall uh
[2138.16s] Market liquidation Thomas you talked
[2140.2s] about some sectors uh that surprised uh
[2142.839s] some investors were would surprise some
[2144.68s] investors during a trump 2.0 so let&#39;s
[2147.2s] talk about um some of these so we
[2149.68s] actually discuss this in detail when
[2151.319s] Trump won the election link down below
[2154.119s] Thomas was on one of my first guests
[2155.68s] after uh November 7th um in particular
[2158.52s] energy is interesting um the oil price
[2161.599s] right now is moving up a lot higher now
[2164.4s] some of it had to do with um sanctions
[2167.8s] on Russia but perhaps expectations are
[2171.079s] that uh Trump is actually going to
[2173.0s] follow through on some of his promises
[2175.04s] what what do you think is going on in
[2176.079s] the energy sector right now yeah we have
[2178.48s] exposure to the energy sector to a
[2180.44s] company called Comstock resources uh
[2183.4s] Jerry Jones who owns the Cowboys owns
[2186.079s] about 66% of the stock at around
[2189.0s] $710 our basis is about a buck higher
[2192.0s] it&#39;s now trading around 20 we believe uh
[2195.4s] the intrinsic value of it both proved uh
[2198.76s] reserves pv10 that they have to report
[2200.76s] to the S&amp;P 500 around 20 30 bucks uh per
[2204.96s] share and then unproved we think is
[2207.16s] another $20 so we we don&#39;t really worry
[2210.68s] about the day-to-day vacillations in
[2212.48s] natural gas or in um or in in oil prices
[2217.2s] I would say that sentiment got so
[2219.48s] pessimistic on oil uh and oil stocks in
[2222.52s] December that uh it it was clear that we
[2225.0s] would get some some level of Bounce the
[2227.28s] problem with the integrated and even
[2229.76s] some of the servicers is that when we
[2232.2s] get involved in a in a business we we
[2234.96s] are looking for a meaningful irr over a
[2238.24s] few years 30% plus and I just didn&#39;t
[2241.2s] find the risk reward despite low quote
[2243.599s] unquote pees uh and high dividends and
[2247.2s] buying back shares Etc I just didn&#39;t
[2249.319s] find the asymmetry in the uh General oil
[2252.599s] and gas space that I did during 2020
[2256.04s] when we were buying it hand over fist
[2257.64s] when oil turned negative uh that&#39;s when
[2260.24s] I like to get involved so for now our
[2262.319s] exposure is limited if you put a gun to
[2264.079s] my head and said how are you going to
[2265.92s] take advantage of the increased Drilling
[2268.56s] and the and the uh energy favorable
[2271.04s] policies from the Trump Administration
[2273.16s] I&#39;d be inclined to being servicers
[2275.56s] potentially like a Slumber J or
[2277.52s] something like that we have no position
[2279.44s] there but if we do expand our energy
[2281.28s] exposure Beyond Comstock that is where
[2283.8s] we would be looking and it would not
[2285.2s] surprise us at all if we see some follow
[2288.44s] through both in the sector because
[2290.52s] that&#39;s a component of value which we
[2292.16s] think is going to have a better year
[2294.0s] than than it did last year uh and um uh
[2299.2s] and some of the initiatives as far as
[2301.079s] the consolidation in the industry deals
[2303.52s] happening in the industry Etc it&#39;s just
[2305.68s] we&#39;re we&#39;re not getting enough juice for
[2307.64s] squeeze so we&#39;re looking elsewhere where
[2309.839s] we can get a lot of juice and uh how are
[2311.839s] you eyeing the tech sector now that
[2314.52s] Trump has probably signaled a doubling
[2317.72s] down of tariffs in the trade War
[2319.72s] globally is a tech sector at risk from
[2322.72s] tariffs and just more protectionism
[2325.319s] overall I think that as we look at the
[2328.24s] mag 7 which is an overweight in the
[2330.68s] indices so you are over dramatically
[2333.2s] overweight Tech if you own the S&amp;P 500
[2335.839s] passively uh and atically overweight if
[2338.48s] if you&#39;re chasing the nvidias and uh and
[2341.76s] and the Googles and Etc the thing that
[2344.92s] our view is the the outperformance of
[2350.76s] the mag 7 last year was somewhat
[2354.88s] justified by the earnings power of the
[2357.44s] mag 7 last year so it&#39;s okay to have a
[2360.72s] 33 times multiple when you have 33%
[2363.44s] earnings growth the the problem going
[2365.56s] into this year is that earnings growth
[2368.359s] is going to decelerate for the mag 7
[2371.28s] from 33% down to it was 21% as of a few
[2374.96s] days ago now I&#39;ve seen numbers down to
[2376.92s] 18% so your your earnings growth is
[2379.599s] going to almost have but the multiple is
[2382.359s] still at 33 time so that the multiple is
[2384.76s] still high it has not yet derated so
[2387.24s] that&#39;s not where I want to be where I
[2388.72s] want to be is where is the where is the
[2391.0s] earnings growth accelerating and the
[2393.96s] multiple has not rated to the upside one
[2396.44s] of those areas for sure is small caps uh
[2400.2s] you&#39;re going to see in the small cap 600
[2402.16s] index earnings growth uh grow from 8% to
[2406.52s] 21% but you&#39;re only paying 16 times so
[2410.68s] half the multiple as the mag 7 for the
[2413.04s] same or slightly more earnings growth if
[2415.16s] you look at the Russell 2000 which has
[2417.76s] more non-profitable companies turning
[2420.119s] profitable that earnings growth I&#39;ve
[2421.839s] seen uh some estimates to be 50% this
[2425.0s] year so I think that&#39;s an area the other
[2427.599s] theme that we&#39;re looking at here David
[2430.119s] is the last shall be first right along
[2433.64s] the theme of the earnings growth
[2434.88s] relative to Value two of the worst
[2436.92s] performing sectors last year because
[2438.72s] they had among the worst performing
[2440.44s] earnings growth were health care and
[2442.96s] materials this year that is going to
[2445.28s] flip on its head because the healthc
[2448.96s] care is expected to grow earnings
[2450.96s] 20.4% which is meaningfully more than
[2453.119s] the S&amp;P at you know 14 15% and material
[2457.56s] is going to grow earnings at
[2459.4s] 17.4% so we like opportunities in those
[2462.48s] two beaten down sectors as well speaking
[2464.44s] of valuations here&#39;s a note from uh
[2466.359s] Goldman Sachs uh their strateg just put
[2468.44s] out a note on Monday um is reported by
[2470.92s] CNBC US stocks are expensive but uh GS
[2473.76s] says investors should keep buying them
[2475.8s] the US Stock Market is trading at eye
[2477.76s] watering valuation says his article
[2479.96s] after two straight big gear for the S&amp;P
[2481.839s] 500 but that&#39;s not good enough a good
[2484.079s] enough reason to back away from domestic
[2486.16s] companies uh the 2025 outlook for the
[2488.359s] unit be leased on Monday included a
[2489.76s] model portfolio for mod risk investors
[2491.88s] that recommended staying overweight us
[2493.839s] equities while trimming exposure to
[2495.4s] foreign stocks is that uh something that
[2497.72s] a view that you share okay so
[2500.92s] Goldman&#39;s 2024 Outlook was the most
[2504.359s] pessimistic on the street their Target
[2506.319s] price for end of year was
[2509.079s] 5,400 um you know the S&amp;P wound up well
[2512.52s] over 6,000 and at one point in the year
[2514.64s] was at
[2515.599s] 6,300 uh so they got it wrong they were
[2518.04s] the most wrong on the street now
[2520.16s] prospectively when value stocks speaking
[2523.16s] of prices what you pay value is what you
[2524.839s] get uh International uh is going to have
[2527.72s] 13 14% earnings growth that&#39;s xus uh
[2531.68s] compared to the us about 14% earnings
[2533.839s] growth the difference is US you&#39;re
[2535.44s] paying 22 times uh International you&#39;re
[2538.119s] paying 15 to 15 and a half times I think
[2541.52s] uh now more than ever just like the
[2544.48s] first year 2017 when Trump was elected
[2547.24s] when everyone thought you had to be all
[2549.28s] us International and Emerging Markets
[2552.319s] actually outperformed after the dollar
[2554.4s] rolled over after the inauguration so I
[2557.2s] would take the exact opposite of this
[2559.559s] note from Goldman Sachs this year just
[2562.0s] as taking the exact opposite of their
[2564.119s] note last year was the right call as
[2565.76s] well and it does and it does beg the
[2568.0s] question as to where Capital flows will
[2570.04s] head now that the bank of Japan in
[2572.44s] particular um is on a path of
[2574.88s] potentially raising rates while
[2576.4s] everybody else is cutting rates if not
[2578.079s] pausing yeah you by the way this is the
[2580.319s] most important thing to be watching in
[2582.319s] 2025 we got a preview of coming
[2584.68s] attractions in early August as the bank
[2588.559s] of Japan is forced to continue to raise
[2591.64s] rates and the Japanese Bond Yi jgb
[2594.8s] yields blow out uh what you&#39;re going to
[2598.04s] see is an unwind of the carry trade and
[2600.839s] the carry trade that free money trade
[2603.64s] that has been concentrated in quote
[2606.16s] unquote us except exceptionalism but
[2607.839s] predominantly mag 7 stocks is going to
[2611.88s] abruptly unwind because as that
[2614.64s] liquidity dries up it&#39;s coming out of
[2616.8s] where it&#39;s been placed and that has been
[2618.92s] in the mag 7 they&#39;ve not been buying you
[2621.8s] know small cap autoart wholesalers
[2624.8s] they&#39;ve not been buying uh Stanley Black
[2627.599s] and&amp; Decker tool makers uh they&#39;ve not
[2630.44s] been buying Baxter International medical
[2633.16s] device companies they&#39;ve been buying uh
[2636.68s] in via they&#39;ve been buying palent here
[2639.359s] they&#39;ve been buying all of those things
[2641.16s] which I think are are going to take a
[2642.88s] breather and by the way I&#39;m not saying
[2645.88s] short Tech this is 2,000 at all I&#39;m
[2648.559s] saying that they there&#39;s going to be a
[2651.92s] rting in multiples which will cause the
[2654.4s] performance of that basket to do less
[2657.24s] well than it did last year I.E low
[2660.16s] single to high single digits whereas uh
[2663.44s] bigger money can be made in in value uh
[2667.119s] across the board and and we can talk a
[2668.96s] little bit about the history of value
[2670.68s] versus growth and why growth uh people
[2673.2s] seem focused on due to recency buys if
[2675.52s] if you&#39;d like to to move move there well
[2677.8s] wait a minute is Apple still a growth
[2679.28s] stock didto Microsoft and well look I
[2682.839s] mean the the story with Apple has been
[2686.0s] multiple expansion right so historically
[2688.4s] it had traded at a 14 times multiple on
[2691.4s] 78% earnings growth or actually higher
[2693.68s] earnings growth back then and then it
[2695.52s] decelerated earnings growth to low to
[2697.88s] mid single digits which is where it is
[2700.119s] now and the multiple expanded into the
[2702.2s] 20s so uh you tell me whether that makes
[2705.44s] sense now the Bulls argument would be
[2707.92s] that uh Services Revenue increase and
[2710.839s] services profitability increased
[2712.72s] therefore it&#39;s it&#39;s uh deserving of such
[2716.2s] a higher multiple but at the end of the
[2718.359s] day if you have decelerating earnings
[2720.599s] growth an accelerating multiple
[2722.559s] expansion it&#39;s a formula for uh not bu
[2726.4s] you know not great things happening
[2728.359s] moving forward so I I would just say
[2731.68s] that uh we don&#39;t we don&#39;t have a view
[2735.559s] that the multiple has to go back to 14
[2737.52s] times by any stretch of the
[2739.8s] imagination but we do have a view that
[2743.319s] some of the gains that have been
[2745.559s] fostered through multiple expansion
[2748.599s] versus earnings growth
[2750.839s] expansion should consolidate the gains
[2753.96s] for some time to digest the price growth
[2758.48s] relative to fundamental business growth
[2761.24s] that has occurred in the last two years
[2763.28s] okay so the main drivers of uh Tech
[2766.24s] earnings then going forward in 2025 in
[2769.16s] particular uh do you think it&#39;s still
[2771.04s] coming from AI do you think that that
[2774.52s] theme has sailed what&#39;s your take The
[2778.119s] Narrative of AI and the expectation of
[2781.4s] AI transforming lives is correct just
[2784.64s] like The Narrative of Amazon on changing
[2787.48s] the world in 1998 1999 2000 2001 2002
[2792.96s] was correct the problem was in that
[2795.92s] first part of the ShakeOut even though
[2798.16s] everyone was right about the story in
[2800.839s] 2000 it took 10 to 15 years to deliver
[2804.44s] the result I.E I press a button on my
[2807.52s] phone and you know here in California in
[2811.599s] sometimes the same day it shows up at my
[2813.48s] my front steps sometimes it takes a
[2815.16s] whole day to do it so all of that stuff
[2817.839s] happened the problem was you were paying
[2821.359s] as if it already happened in 2000 when
[2825.8s] it would take 15 more years to deliver
[2828.119s] which is why you saw in 2000 to 2002 the
[2831.599s] greatest company in the world Amazon
[2833.48s] down 90% in
[2836.68s] price despite the fundamentals of the
[2839.599s] business continuing to improve in each
[2842.48s] of those years 2000 2001 2002 2003 while
[2846.28s] the price was crashing the fundamentals
[2847.92s] were improving because you had simply
[2850.0s] paid too much for what was to come 10 to
[2852.88s] 15 years later as if it had already come
[2855.88s] 15 years earlier yeah so then bottom
[2858.96s] line sector over sorry please so so as
[2861.48s] it relates to AI um you know I made a
[2864.8s] joke Jensen Wong is is flying the good
[2867.599s] news is the bad news is Jensen Wong is
[2869.72s] flying too close to the Sun the good
[2871.88s] news is his wings aren&#39;t melting yet I
[2873.76s] mean you have a company that is trading
[2876.28s] at uh uh you know
[2879.8s] 30 30 times sales 40 50 times earnings
[2884.68s] and if you look at capex spand from from
[2887.44s] the mag 7 it&#39;s going to decelerate this
[2890.839s] year as it relates to AI because
[2894.4s] investors are demanding a you know they
[2896.119s] made record capb backs in 2024 on AI
[2899.72s] chips Jensen Wong was the beneficiary
[2901.88s] but now uh there&#39;s something called
[2903.88s] return on invested Capital that
[2905.44s] investors demand in order to allocate
[2907.44s] capital and it&#39;s eroding their return on
[2909.88s] invested uh return on invested capital
[2912.599s] or return on Equity depending which
[2914.119s] metric you like to look at because
[2916.24s] they&#39;re not getting the revenues
[2917.72s] commensurate with the spend uh in the
[2920.16s] near term so they have to temper that
[2922.4s] that&#39;s number one number two once you
[2924.76s] have all these large language models
[2927.76s] trained and and I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s
[2929.96s] done as we move to the inference part
[2933.079s] once the language models are are trained
[2935.4s] the inference requires less Hardware
[2939.0s] because it&#39;s less demanding it just
[2940.48s] starts to make use of the large language
[2942.4s] models and the demand for the chips goes
[2943.96s] down so I do you think you&#39;re going to
[2945.559s] see a reating of some of these arms
[2947.68s] dealers in the AI race and and the and
[2950.4s] the third thing I would say about Nvidia
[2952.16s] is is like uh it&#39;s worked well because
[2955.52s] he&#39;s had no competition but like every
[2958.599s] semiconductor cycle and and you know a
[2961.04s] lot of people that are betting on Nvidia
[2964.04s] weren&#39;t even through puberty the last
[2965.839s] time this happened
[2967.4s] uh and they don&#39;t have any point of
[2969.4s] reference but competition is coming okay
[2972.72s] they&#39;re not curing cancer over at Nvidia
[2974.88s] that I can assure you and the chips will
[2977.04s] be replicated or even substandard
[2979.68s] versions that people can buy at quantity
[2981.72s] at price will start to replace
[2983.92s] particularly again as we move from large
[2986.28s] language models to the inference phase
[2988.16s] of the cycle uh and the purchasers of
[2992.0s] these technologies will be required by
[2995.319s] their investors to get return on
[2997.68s] investment so they either lower the
[2999.559s] spend and risk seeding market share to
[3002.28s] their competition or they get more
[3005.48s] compute power per dollar of spend
[3008.48s] through cheaper competitive chips and
[3011.0s] what we find as we find every single
[3013.48s] semiconductor cycle is that chips are a
[3016.52s] commodity and sooner or later
[3018.839s] competition catches up and it&#39;s a raise
[3021.079s] to the bottom for margins and this time
[3023.119s] will be no different two questions on
[3024.839s] that um first good point on competition
[3027.319s] so uh competition from where is my
[3029.839s] question if there is going to be
[3031.48s] competition why hasn&#39;t it already
[3033.119s] happened is probably the question on the
[3034.52s] street Intel I know they got rid of
[3036.24s] their CEO they&#39;re searching for a new
[3037.64s] one um AMD hasn&#39;t caught up uh Taiwan
[3040.799s] semi I don&#39;t know what&#39;s your take well
[3042.96s] Taiwan Taiwan is in the best position
[3045.28s] they&#39;re in the the uh the be the thing
[3048.839s] is if if Taiwan can this is the thing
[3051.839s] that people forget if Taiwan
[3053.44s] semiconductor ceases to exist there is
[3055.96s] no Nvidia
[3057.44s] so Nvidia can design chips but if they
[3059.96s] can&#39;t produce them they they have no
[3062.0s] business so as much as there&#39;s pessimism
[3064.92s] around the intels of the world which you
[3066.92s] know if they if they just liquidated the
[3068.92s] thing now investors would get their
[3070.68s] money back plus a few dollars um the US
[3074.68s] has invested eight billion dollars of
[3076.76s] real cash and then billions of subsidies
[3078.839s] and everything else so whether they
[3080.28s] stand up the Fab or not or or put it
[3082.359s] into a separate entity first thing they
[3084.24s] got to do is announce a new CEO I think
[3086.68s] when all is said and done what you&#39;ll
[3088.079s] find is that everything Pat gelsinger
[3090.799s] said was going to happen he had
[3092.64s] basically gotten he got into the 10 yard
[3095.72s] line and they and they they they took
[3098.28s] the ball away before he could cross the
[3100.28s] finish line he did the four nodes in
[3102.24s] five years he&#39;s uh he look he burned a
[3105.319s] lot of cash so he had to go the board
[3107.0s] got board so the name of the game is
[3108.88s] they need to hire someone and announce
[3111.319s] someone who&#39;s credible and then just
[3113.359s] finish Ginger&#39;s plan because
[3115.559s] everything&#39;s in place and if they can
[3117.04s] get the Fab business going either in the
[3120.04s] current entity or in a separate entity
[3122.799s] and they can uh catch up I think that
[3124.799s] one&#39;s got an interesting possibility
[3127.64s] relative to margin of safety of if
[3129.88s] you&#39;re conservative and you don&#39;t
[3131.28s] believe in their future as a Fab uh it&#39;s
[3134.28s] probably a double just on the Legacy
[3135.96s] business and if if they get the right
[3137.96s] CEO and if you do believe in gelsinger&#39;s
[3140.799s] full plan then this thing could be a
[3142.28s] multibagger but leaving that aside the
[3144.76s] amds will catch up uh the Marvel&#39;s the
[3148.319s] broad there there&#39;s a lot of people
[3151.52s] gunning for a piece of the Jensen Wong
[3153.72s] pie and like every cycle you can be
[3156.319s] assured that they will get some of it
[3158.16s] not all of it but they will get enough
[3159.799s] of it that um you&#39;ll see margin
[3162.559s] compression and you&#39;ll see a
[3163.64s] normalization of multiples last question
[3165.88s] on uh Ai and Nvidia this came in this
[3168.319s] week Nvidia stock Falls after Biden
[3170.2s] Administration releases updated export
[3172.2s] rules for AI chips so the Stock&#39;s been
[3174.0s] down about 12 133% since it&#39;s to in uh
[3177.839s] uh late December but uh anyway this came
[3179.88s] out it fell nearly 2% on Monday after
[3182.0s] the Biden Administration released an
[3183.599s] updated export rule aimed at controlling
[3186.16s] the flow of artificial intelligence
[3187.72s] chips to adversaries such as China the
[3190.48s] White House said that the rule will cap
[3191.799s] the number of AI chips called gpus that
[3194.16s] can be ordered by most countries without
[3196.359s] a special license smaller orders of
[3198.079s] 1,700 or fewer gpus would not count
[3200.2s] toward the export cap um is this
[3202.599s] significant for the industry at all or
[3205.079s] um or not so much I mean you expect this
[3206.92s] to be reversed uh it&#39;s significant for
[3210.359s] the industry but not for the reasons
[3212.28s] that you think number one in the short
[3214.24s] term it will hurt hurt the industry a
[3216.0s] little bit in the intermediate term to
[3218.48s] long term it will it will destroy the
[3220.2s] industry because what you basically did
[3222.599s] in the name of National Security is
[3225.079s] you&#39;ve taken uh a uh eager paying
[3230.079s] customer to us companies and said you
[3232.839s] can no longer buy from us so you&#39;ve
[3234.839s] given them no choice but to learn how to
[3238.799s] create that competency for themselves
[3240.64s] and how do they do that it&#39;s very simple
[3242.68s] they pick off the best talent uh they
[3245.04s] reverse engineer the technology and they
[3246.92s] do it themselves whereas if the
[3248.24s] government did not impose these
[3250.799s] restrictions they would stay dependent
[3252.72s] on us uh forever uh so effectively in
[3256.44s] the short term it looks like a win
[3258.04s] because they don&#39;t have the same
[3259.2s] technology in the intermediate term
[3261.079s] after they ship the the chips through
[3263.2s] other countries and ultimately get them
[3264.88s] and reverse engineer them and they
[3266.599s] front-loaded a bunch before of this
[3268.359s] anyway to buy them a few years to
[3270.359s] reverse engineer the technology and hire
[3272.319s] out all the best talent um uh the the
[3276.16s] big issue is maybe the competition that
[3278.52s] I&#39;m talking about is not coming from the
[3280.799s] the players that were anticipating and
[3282.839s] it&#39;s coming from players that are just
[3284.92s] now getting um uh going and from from
[3289.72s] China great thank you very much uh close
[3292.24s] off let&#39;s close off on your sector
[3293.72s] overweights and underweights for 2025
[3295.68s] suing everything together yeah I think
[3297.839s] uh three themes here first values
[3300.0s] outperform growth by
[3302.04s] 4.4% per year since
[3304.599s] 1927 so we want to be skewed toward
[3308.119s] adding value this year and the and the
[3310.96s] recency bias around value in the last
[3313.52s] since 2010 has been zero interest rate
[3315.839s] policy if you believe we&#39;re going back
[3318.04s] to to zero interest rate policy then
[3320.119s] stay overweight growth if you believe
[3322.079s] we&#39;re in a normalized environment which
[3323.839s] we do start adding some value uh into
[3326.88s] the portfolio the second theme is uh
[3330.0s] small over large you get the same or
[3333.839s] better earnings growth for half the
[3335.4s] multiple this year it worked in Trump
[3337.799s] 1.0 and the third theme is start to get
[3340.44s] some International exposure because like
[3342.44s] value and growth that runs in Cycles uh
[3345.359s] International and US runs in cycles and
[3347.92s] when you see a headline uh us
[3351.24s] exceptionalism the note that you
[3353.28s] referenced uh it&#39;s often time to start
[3355.48s] to get some Expos
[3356.92s] internationally again you know 13 14%
[3360.319s] earnings growth for 30% less multiple
[3363.4s] International is the thing as far as
[3365.0s] domestic last shall be First Health Care
[3367.839s] and um health care for sure and
[3370.559s] materials are ways to get value for
[3373.079s] massive earnings growth acceleration in
[3375.76s] 2025 uh and I think the one of the
[3378.24s] surprises of 2025 is that following the
[3381.359s] inauguration into the first quarter I
[3383.799s] think you&#39;re going to see bonds start to
[3385.24s] get bid 10 yields start to get bid
[3387.559s] yields compress uh and I I think that
[3391.96s] the uh the pounding the table around 5%
[3395.68s] is going to be more like 4% would be my
[3399.48s] bet as we move throughout the year uh I
[3402.72s] I take the under I&#39;d see the 10year
[3404.52s] yield closer to 4% then closer to 5% uh
[3407.44s] towards the end of the year for sure
[3409.0s] interesting okay good thank you very
[3410.4s] much where can we learn more from you
[3411.48s] and hedge fund tips uh we have our blog

[3445.24s] great uh great resource for anybody
[3447.72s] interested in markets and updates thank
[3449.24s] you very much for your update today Tom
[3451.039s] we&#39;ll speak again soon take care thanks
[3452.96s] so much David thank you for watching
[3454.599s] don&#39;t forget to like And
[3464.16s] subscribe and we&#39;re back and then this
[3467.359s] morning at lovely 1:30 a.m. I had the
[3469.88s] pleasure to be on CNBC Indonesia closing
[3473.64s] bell talking Trump policies this is a
[3475.68s] good one so listen in here
[3478.359s] exclusive Thomas J&#39;s chairman and
[3480.72s] managing members great Hill Capital cnia
[3484.76s] America how are you Thomas it&#39;s been a
[3487.68s] while I&#39;m doing great thanks for having
[3489.88s] me Saina thank you for joining us in
[3491.68s] CNBC Indonesia just barely three days
[3494.72s] ago Donald Trump has been inaugurated as
[3496.839s] the 47 presidents of the United States
[3498.88s] of America so what is your outlook for
[3500.76s] the US
[3503.0s] economy yeah I think we&#39;re going to see
[3504.799s] a very positive
[3506.64s] high growth economy like we saw in the
[3508.799s] first few years of his first term uh
[3511.359s] certainly positive impact on the economy
[3514.28s] positive impact on the stock market and
[3516.64s] it&#39;s really going to be driven by tax
[3519.24s] cuts lower taxes lower regulation more
[3523.079s] business-friendly environment and I
[3525.16s] think the other aspect of what we&#39;re
[3526.92s] going to see safrina is a more
[3529.559s] broadening in the participation like we
[3532.24s] saw in the first term uh people at the
[3534.839s] lower level of the income strata are
[3536.599s] going to do a lot better just like they
[3538.52s] did in 2017 2018
[3541.839s] 2019 we&#39;re also going to see a lot more
[3544.96s] sector participation us markets have
[3547.96s] been pretty concentrated in Tech
[3550.72s] participation magnificent 7 I think
[3552.92s] we&#39;re going to start to see a lot more
[3555.039s] companies in Industrials manufacturing
[3558.079s] banking energy uh start to participate
[3560.839s] small caps Etc so a lot of broadening
[3564.079s] and uh and good performance in stock
[3566.4s] outside of the Magnificent 7 moving
[3568.28s] forward and also the labor force Market
[3570.44s] as you
[3571.88s] mention yes yeah there&#39;s no question
[3574.52s] about it uh they going to be uh better
[3576.599s] wages there going to be more jobs
[3578.48s] there&#39;s going to be a lot more
[3579.64s] investment in the US a lot more
[3581.599s] manufacturing you know manufacturing has
[3583.799s] been in a recession or even a a slump
[3587.72s] for two straight years I think you&#39;re
[3590.079s] going to see some policies and some
[3591.839s] investment that&#39;s going to make
[3592.92s] manufacturing boom again that&#39;s going to
[3595.0s] create a lot of high paying jobs and
[3597.2s] beside the manufacturing Industries in
[3598.92s] the United States what do you believe
[3600.599s] will be his key priorities to strengthen
[3603.28s] your domestic economy
[3606.48s] Thomas yeah I think there there are a
[3608.4s] few Sao number one is going to Unleash
[3612.039s] the Beast of US Energy we have unlimited
[3615.44s] beautiful natural resources uh drill
[3618.48s] baby drill he&#39;s going to open up leases
[3620.76s] on federal lands for drilling uh reduce
[3624.4s] regulations on offshore drilling so
[3626.44s] we&#39;re going to have an unlimited
[3628.24s] abundance of cheap uh energy to fuel
[3631.799s] industry you saw the Stargate investment
[3635.079s] project yesterday $500 billion that&#39;s
[3637.16s] going to require a tremendous amount of
[3639.599s] energy all types of energy certainly
[3641.68s] natural gas uh certainly oil certainly
[3645.0s] some nuclear is going to be in the
[3647.079s] picture certainly Renewables we&#39;re going
[3648.88s] to need that the other thing you&#39;re
[3650.4s] going to see is lower taxes for
[3653.119s] individuals lower taxes for corporations
[3656.119s] which is going to foster a lot of
[3657.88s] investment and high high nominal growth
[3661.44s] high high GDP growth uh the other thing
[3664.2s] you&#39;re going to see is a
[3665.4s] business-friendly environment that&#39;s
[3666.96s] going to attract a lot of foreign
[3669.559s] investment you saw Moshi Sun uh and
[3672.72s] others uh uh committing $500 billion
[3675.68s] doll to Stargate AI infrastructure
[3678.16s] investment and just today uh MBS from
[3681.68s] Saudi Arabia said we we would invest
[3684.319s] they would invest up to 600 100 billion
[3687.2s] dollar in the United States so a lot of
[3689.88s] people want to do business with Trump
[3691.48s] and America and then finally is peace
[3694.24s] through strength getting us out of Wars
[3697.839s] uh creating a peaceful geopolitical
[3700.52s] environment through a strong National
[3703.359s] Defense and spending on defense so uh
[3706.079s] those are kind of the core tenants of
[3707.839s] things we&#39;re going to see that are going
[3708.92s] to lead to growth and stability under
[3710.599s] the Trump Administration right I would
[3712.559s] like to hear more and I want you to
[3715.4s] elaborate more about his inauguration
[3717.599s] speech essential topics with the popular
[3721.039s] catch price drill baby drill what do we
[3724.359s] need to anticipate from that as from the
[3727.52s] Emerging Markets point of
[3730.96s] view well I think that there is a
[3734.319s] perception that uh Trump is going to
[3738.24s] want to do trade Wars and tariff and
[3741.359s] Emerging Markets will do poorly and I
[3743.799s] think what we saw in the first
[3745.96s] Administration first Trump
[3747.2s] Administration was exactly the opposite
[3749.68s] so the the two things that people
[3751.4s] expected in Trump 1.0 when he ran as the
[3754.4s] Tariff King was that the US dollar was
[3758.16s] going to be very strong and emerging Mar
[3761.48s] market equities would be very weak after
[3764.48s] the inauguration in 2017 the exact
[3768.52s] opposite happened so right after he was
[3771.96s] elected the dollar rallied and emerging
[3774.799s] market stocks went down down uh right
[3777.0s] after he was inaugurated in 200 January
[3780.319s] 2017 you saw the dollar back off uh
[3783.48s] started to weaken in that first year you
[3786.119s] saw emerging markets and China stocks
[3788.52s] start to do exceptionally well in those
[3790.799s] first two years of the 2017
[3793.16s] Administration so I think there&#39;s going
[3795.68s] to be a difference between what people
[3797.319s] expect I.E International emerging will
[3800.24s] do less well and what actually happens I
[3803.2s] think I think the whole world is going
[3804.72s] to do well and I think emerging market
[3806.68s] stocks are going to Boom uh I think that
[3809.839s] uh Commodities are going to do well and
[3812.039s] I think it&#39;s going to be fueled by a lot
[3813.48s] of investment a lot of growth lot of
[3815.319s] optimism and good policy uh win-win
[3819.079s] policy globally right right thank you um
[3823.119s] now moving on to the digital assets how
[3825.68s] do you anticipate the Trump
[3827.0s] administration&#39;s approach towards the
[3829.359s] the Bitcoin the digital assets the
[3833.279s] cryptocurrencies will there be
[3835.079s] significant new regulation in this
[3837.279s] particular
[3839.48s] sector I think it&#39;s going to be nuanced
[3842.4s] certainly it&#39;s going to be more crypto
[3844.72s] friendly he ran on that to uh really
[3847.4s] attract a lot of people who own crypto
[3849.88s] assets to vote for him uh and I think
[3852.4s] he&#39;ll follow through on what he promised
[3854.599s] so there will be a focus on Innovation
[3857.48s] there will be a focus on deregulation
[3860.119s] you see uh Scott bessent his treasury
[3863.0s] secretary has spoken positively about
[3865.319s] crypto
[3866.24s] Howard L lutnick his Commerce Secretary
[3869.599s] uh owns Bitcoin has invested in crypto
[3872.52s] companies vocal supporter of Bitcoin and
[3875.68s] then the SEC chairman Paul Atkins is ex
[3879.44s] expected to take a a softer approach to
[3882.559s] crypto regulation uh I would keep in
[3885.4s] mind though uh that further adoption and
[3889.079s] further rules are also going to Foster
[3891.76s] more competition more issuance so uh
[3895.44s] it&#39;s started out straight away with uh
[3897.68s] the Trump token and the Melania token so
[3901.599s] you know all these folks that are in uh
[3904.119s] Bitcoin and uh salana and other
[3907.24s] instruments may start to see a lot more
[3909.76s] competition for those crypto dollars
[3911.96s] because I think there&#39;s going to be a
[3913.119s] lot more issuance of different tokens
[3915.599s] and different crypto opportunities so it
[3918.799s] potentially could have an effect that
[3921.0s] people are not focused on which is
[3923.44s] delution you know people say well coin
[3926.279s] Bitcoin is the best thing ever because
[3927.96s] it&#39;s scarce uh but if the regulation
[3931.599s] becomes more friendly you could have a
[3933.24s] lot more tokens and crypto Investments
[3936.76s] that may in fact dilute the couple that
[3939.799s] currently have uh a duop on the crypto
[3943.24s] investment funds right Thomas and this
[3945.799s] is Trum 2.0 as we mentioned here and
[3949.0s] given the history of the previous trade
[3950.92s] War do you think we will foree the
[3954.839s] possibility of a trade War 2.0 between
[3957.68s] the US and China under this Trump&#39;s
[3963.119s] leadership I think that uh first and
[3966.2s] foremost I think that&#39;s a headline
[3968.279s] that&#39;s unfair I think what Trump wants
[3970.96s] to do is threaten big okay and then
[3975.2s] negotiate a favorable win-win deal okay
[3978.44s] and if you look at the big focused has
[3980.319s] been on China uh you know China is a
[3983.76s] small portion of our global trade it&#39;s
[3985.839s] about $600 billion of call it 5 trillion
[3990.64s] uh he came out of the gate and he said
[3992.279s] 60% Trump&#39;s tariffs on China day one
[3996.279s] well now we&#39;re talking about 10% tariffs
[3998.68s] on China and it wasn&#39;t on day one it&#39;s
[4001.24s] going to be pushed off till February so
[4003.48s] I think uh you know as it relates to
[4005.24s] China his number one thing is stop get
[4007.92s] stop allowing this fent andol to go
[4010.079s] through our borders it&#39;s hurting a lot
[4011.839s] of our people so he&#39;s going to use the
[4013.599s] tariffs to get the Chinese to cooperate
[4016.2s] on those issues that are very very
[4018.119s] important to the US uh there probably
[4020.88s] will be some level of tariffs but it
[4023.64s] will be a lot lower than advertised and
[4026.319s] then once that framework and agreement
[4028.72s] is in place I think it will Foster a lot
[4030.839s] more business between the two countries
[4033.52s] versus the previous administration that
[4035.599s] you know consistently said you know
[4037.359s] China was wrong and and never got to the
[4039.839s] table to do a good deal but how do you
[4041.92s] particular see the relations between
[4043.799s] Donald Trump and cim Bank
[4047.359s] I think they&#39;re actually a lot better
[4049.599s] than is advertised uh on the headlines I
[4052.799s] think they&#39;re already communicating it&#39;s
[4055.079s] been announced that they&#39;re
[4056.16s] communicating I think there&#39;s a level of
[4058.279s] mutual respect uh which and and um uh a
[4063.0s] willingness to talk and a willingness to
[4064.76s] come to a table look Donald Trump is an
[4067.0s] America first president he wants to do
[4069.319s] what&#39;s in the best interest of America
[4071.68s] but he understands in business in order
[4073.64s] to get what he wants he has to have a
[4075.96s] deal that makes sense for the other
[4077.359s] party he&#39;s been doing this for his
[4079.24s] entire career business career going over
[4081.72s] 60 years at this point and he will come
[4084.359s] to a favorable deal and I think we&#39;ll
[4086.119s] have very positive relations uh with
[4088.92s] China and with our other trade Partners
[4091.2s] after a little bit of volatility to come
[4093.4s] to good terms and that&#39;s the way
[4094.799s] negotiation works you ask for everything
[4097.12s] and then you come to a good winwin uh
[4100.199s] solution now for the geopolitical
[4103.0s] situations um given the ongoing
[4105.64s] humanitarian crisis in Gaza uh do you
[4108.88s] think the US under the administrations
[4111.0s] of Donald Trump should play a more
[4112.52s] active role in providing or seeking a r
[4115.4s] solution what do you think is Donald
[4116.839s] Trump&#39;s going to
[4118.96s] do well I think if if past this any
[4121.839s] prologue in Trump 1.0 we saw record
[4124.719s] World Peace uh it was really the
[4127.279s] situation so I do think he&#39;ll be
[4128.88s] involved I do you think that will be
[4130.52s] resolved much more quickly than it
[4132.799s] possibly could have under the previous
[4134.799s] bureaucrats an Administration I think
[4137.279s] that uh I think that leaders around the
[4139.4s] world respect and and respect Trump and
[4143.279s] and know he means business when when he
[4145.08s] says to come to the table and he&#39;s going
[4146.679s] to do a deal something&#39;s going to get
[4148.159s] done so I do see a situation where
[4151.6s] geopolitical issues are going to be much
[4154.12s] more muted we&#39;re going to get rid of all
[4155.88s] these multi-front wars uh we&#39;re going to
[4158.44s] come to some negotiated resolutions
[4160.319s] through Trump peace through strength and
[4163.359s] it will be good for the world and we can
[4164.839s] focus on business and Global Prosperity
[4167.159s] right wonderful insights always from you
[4168.88s] Thomas thank you so much for joining us
[4170.319s] in CNBC Indonesia take
[4172.44s] care thanks Saina appreciate
[4175.839s] it and I want to thank uh fitria angran
[4181.839s] and
[4183.239s] safrina nushan for having me on that one
[4187.52s] uh and then
[4190.239s] uh couple nights ago I was on cgtn
[4193.839s] America with Sean calebs also uh want to
[4199.48s] thank camia kilan for having me on we&#39;ll
[4202.239s] listen in here welcome back everyone he
[4204.96s] was chosen by Trump to in part cut
[4207.32s] government costs but it appears he has
[4209.28s] been cut Vivic ramaswami announced his
[4212.159s] departure from the Department of
[4213.64s] government efficiency or Doge to
[4215.8s] possibly run for governor of the state
[4217.4s] of Ohio however various source-based
[4219.64s] report say ramas Swami was Iced Out by
[4223.159s] Elon Musk ramas Swami was tapped by
[4225.8s] Trump alongside musk to streamline
[4228.239s] federal spending now with his exit musk
[4230.48s] is now fully in charge and leads the
[4232.76s] push to cut government waste some say
[4234.92s] ramas Swami&#39;s departure is reminiscent
[4236.92s] of the many leadership changes seen
[4239.159s] during Trump&#39;s first term in office so
[4241.52s] what exactly will Elon Musk do key
[4244.159s] initiatives include modernizing outdated
[4246.719s] systems as well as implementing
[4248.64s] cost-saving work force reductions
[4251.04s] drawing from his corporate experience
[4252.719s] musk aims to overhaul inefficient
[4254.48s] Federal process with a tech driven
[4256.64s] approach however these plans have
[4258.6s] sparked legal challenges and also raised
[4261.04s] concern about potential impacts on
[4263.08s] essential government services let&#39;s take
[4265.84s] a closer look at that and for that we&#39;re
[4268.28s] joined by Thomas Hayes founder and
[4269.84s] chairman and managing member of great
[4271.96s] Hill Capital Thomas always a pleasure
[4274.04s] welcome good to see you good to see you
[4276.44s] Sean okay so what do we know about Doge
[4278.08s] it seems like it&#39;s a it&#39;s a moving
[4279.76s] Target day two in office and we&#39;re back
[4281.56s] to this kind of chaos uh that seems to
[4283.719s] follow the the current president Elon
[4286.4s] Musk firmly entrenched but as we heard
[4288.64s] Vivic ramas Swami out and Trump saying
[4291.239s] Doge will be entrenched in the executive
[4293.56s] branch not an outside committee I know
[4296.0s] just threw a lot at you but how
[4297.28s] important is this going to be to the US
[4298.6s] economy and what Ripple effects do you
[4300.76s] expect to see through the markets well I
[4303.28s] think this is a big deal Sean because as
[4305.199s] you know the interest expense has
[4307.28s] ballooned in the last few years nearly
[4309.28s] doubling from uh under half a trillion
[4311.56s] to now over a trillion dollars a year
[4313.76s] due to interest rate increases and
[4315.92s] spending uh you know 120% debt to GDP so
[4320.0s] it&#39;s absolutely essential that not only
[4323.0s] does this uh initiative work uh but more
[4326.92s] importantly that it is perceived to be
[4329.92s] working because I I don&#39;t think we&#39;re
[4331.92s] going to get $2 trillion of cuts and I
[4334.12s] think Elon Musk has intimated as much by
[4337.52s] saying well two trillion would be nice 1
[4340.0s] billion is one trillion is more
[4341.52s] realistic I think if they got a half a
[4343.6s] trillion it would be huge to get out of
[4345.52s] this type of mess historically the
[4347.48s] number one thing you need is massive
[4350.04s] growth and I think this White House is
[4352.84s] keenly focused on massive growth through
[4355.0s] deregulation and through tax cuts and
[4357.4s] through other growth initiatives but we
[4359.32s] do need a perception of getting that
[4361.28s] spending under control and that&#39;s what
[4362.56s] doge is all about yeah this perception
[4364.52s] is important and look this isn&#39;t the
[4366.159s] first time a US president has vowed to
[4368.48s] cut the fat in federal government and
[4371.48s] Trump in his first term added more money
[4374.12s] to the federal deficit
[4375.639s] any president so tell me why this time
[4377.92s] things are going to be
[4379.48s] different well I think that there&#39;s no
[4382.199s] choice okay in order to uh get the
[4385.8s] interest rates under control he wants to
[4387.56s] bring interest rates down you can only
[4389.04s] control that through the FED which is an
[4390.92s] independent body uh and the long end of
[4394.08s] the curve is really going to tell you
[4395.48s] whether the market believes they are
[4397.32s] getting the spending under control but
[4399.44s] you know there are some sensible ideas
[4402.28s] that are coming out as a as a function
[4404.28s] of this dialogue plug which is you know
[4406.6s] consolidating a lot of these redundant
[4408.719s] government agencies or making them more
[4410.92s] uh efficient uh even you&#39;ve you&#39;ve heard
[4413.32s] the idea of reducing the number of them
[4416.12s] from 400 down to 100 which would be a
[4418.88s] tall order uh probably a wish list uh
[4421.52s] more than a reality but if we move in
[4424.08s] this direction it&#39;s going to send the
[4425.52s] right message to the market more people
[4427.08s] will want to buy our debt we can
[4428.719s] refinance at lower rates while we wait
[4431.4s] for growth to uh pick up a bit growth
[4435.239s] been good it could get better Thomas you
[4436.96s] make some great points and uh that there
[4438.96s] is a a need to do this to kind of
[4441.96s] streamline government so what role will
[4444.36s] Doge play uh if you will in
[4446.6s] cryptocurrency regulation and I ask this
[4448.84s] because the president the first lady
[4450.96s] have launched their own crypto so the
[4453.159s] fact that he has that and a billionaire
[4455.96s] is overseeing overall of this does it
[4459.32s] kind of smack of trouble down the
[4461.76s] road yeah the crypto thing is pretty
[4465.08s] gray at this moment because he did
[4467.84s] appoint David Sachs as the crypto Zar
[4471.44s] originally and then David had a lot of
[4473.6s] ties in Silicon Valley that did you know
[4476.44s] enabled him to be more of an advisor
[4478.4s] than take a major role uh in the
[4480.639s] administration so there&#39;s some ambiguity
[4482.88s] about crypto as far as Doge related to
[4485.8s] crypto crypto seems to be a separate
[4488.199s] initiative that that will be under the
[4489.96s] crypto are that will be under other
[4492.199s] purviews besides Doge doge is
[4494.32s] predominantly focused uh on reducing the
[4497.08s] cost okay so cuts on from Doge and more
[4501.4s] efficient Workforce so if you&#39;re a
[4503.639s] federal worker right now in any agency
[4506.12s] and there are a lot of them out there
[4507.719s] are you nervous are you anxious are you
[4510.08s] antsy and what are the markets looking
[4513.56s] for yeah I I do think you are I think
[4516.56s] the first thing that they did was do the
[4519.04s] executive order that you must come back
[4521.0s] to work in the office 5 days a week that
[4523.199s] will probably D Trim 5 to 10% of the
[4526.159s] workforce without them having to do much
[4528.12s] just to start with because not all
[4529.88s] people can work from the office uh 5
[4532.159s] days a week that have family and other
[4533.719s] commitments so that will help uh we&#39;ve
[4536.679s] seen uh hopes or wish lists or
[4539.96s] assertions from the people uh involved
[4542.76s] or around Doge that they could cut 75%
[4546.679s] of government employees that is uh a
[4548.96s] tall order that is unlikely to be
[4551.199s] anywhere near met I would be a little
[4553.199s] concerned if you&#39;re not in an
[4555.04s] indispensable position I do think
[4556.639s] there&#39;s going to be consolidation of
[4557.96s] agencies I do think there&#39;s going to be
[4560.0s] a reduction of the workforce all the
[4561.88s] work is going to be done in person and
[4563.96s] as they bring in software and more
[4566.12s] efficient processes to the federal
[4569.12s] government uh that will reduce a lot of
[4572.08s] make work so I I would expect to see I&#39;m
[4574.84s] not uh thinking anywhere near 75%
[4577.48s] reduction but 10 to 20% is realistic
[4580.32s] okay uh you only have 30 seconds now
[4581.96s] Trump has had some major fallouts with
[4583.84s] people he&#39;s been close to to what
[4585.6s] happens if Trump and musk Collide and
[4588.159s] this friendship crashes and
[4590.48s] burns well I think it&#39;s a symbiotic
[4593.32s] relationship because musk uh certainly
[4596.76s] needs the administration for some of his
[4598.639s] initiatives with regard to uh SpaceX and
[4602.88s] uh uh automated driving and uh other
[4606.159s] other projects that musk is involved in
[4608.36s] and Trump needs the expertise you know
[4610.44s] the one thing that about Trump is he is
[4613.12s] very attentive to people who have uh
[4616.719s] areas of specific expertise and in many
[4619.159s] cases are uh wealthy or wealthier than
[4622.08s] he is he loves to listen to their
[4624.239s] viewpoints because he takes them very
[4625.96s] very seriously I think that adds a lot
[4628.8s] from elon&#39;s uh credibility as it relates
[4632.6s] to Tech as it relates to some of the
[4634.44s] initiatives where uh Donald Trump
[4636.239s] doesn&#39;t H quite have the background as a
[4637.96s] real estate developer and businessman
[4639.8s] he&#39;s not so focused on on some of the
[4641.719s] things that are happening in the economy
[4643.239s] now and that&#39;s where Elon can provide a
[4645.639s] tremendous amount of value for Trump for
[4647.92s] the administration for the country so
[4649.88s] right now it&#39;s really too symbiotic to
[4652.159s] have a Fallout unless we saw an instance
[4654.92s] where uh the spotlight started to get
[4658.36s] excessively stolen which uh I it gets
[4660.639s] crowded there really quickly exactly so
[4663.48s] so that&#39;s a risk but I I think it&#39;s less
[4665.639s] of a risk than people are making it out
[4667.4s] to be at the moment because they both
[4668.92s] meet each other okay we&#39;ll see Thomas
[4671.04s] always a pleasure my friend thank you so
[4672.44s] much thanks Sean okay we&#39;re gonna take a
[4676.32s] and we&#39;re back
[4679.6s] and there was one more
[4683.04s] here and finally today uh CNA which is
[4687.08s] like the BBC of Singapore and all of
[4689.679s] Asia huge station want to thank Audrey
[4692.96s] Tay and Sarah Al khi for having me on to
[4698.44s] talk more Trump and other implications
[4701.04s] listen in
[4702.44s] here Traders anticipating a new era of
[4705.36s] lower interest rates and cheaper oil
[4707.56s] helped push Wall Street to record highs
[4709.92s] overnight the S&amp;P 500 hit an alltime
[4713.04s] inaday high above the 6,100 Milestone
[4716.76s] following comments from US president
[4718.4s] Donald Trump at the world economic Forum
[4720.76s] he said he would demand an immediate
[4722.56s] drop in borrowing costs the Dow and the
[4725.48s] NASDAQ both ended in the positive for a
[4728.96s] fourth straight session energy stocks
[4731.28s] tempered some of those gains with the
[4734.12s] S&amp;P 500 energy sector on track for its
[4737.4s] worst weekly performance since late
[4739.639s] December Mr Trump also told Davos
[4741.96s] business Elites he plans to ask Saudi
[4744.0s] Arabia to lower the price of oil to
[4746.52s] dampen inflation his speech comes just
[4749.199s] before the fed&#39;s meeting next week where
[4751.08s] they are largely expected to keep
[4752.76s] interest rates unchanged there have been
[4755.32s] concerns that potential sweeping tariffs
[4757.96s] by the Trump Administration could add to
[4760.199s] inflationary pressures and slow the
[4762.4s] fed&#39;s policy easing path
[4765.96s] for more of the markets we have Thomas
[4767.84s] Hayes chairman and managing member at
[4770.28s] Great Hill Capital thanks for your time
[4772.4s] Tomas so gains for Wall Street but it&#39;s
[4775.239s] really been concentrated in a very
[4777.08s] narrow part of the market despite
[4779.8s] expectations of growth under the Trump
[4782.4s] Administration so do you think it&#39;s time
[4784.36s] to move on to other previously unloved
[4787.8s] parts of the market or is it time to bet
[4790.639s] on these tried and tested names because
[4793.679s] of the uncertainty that we might
[4796.88s] see well Sarah I think what you saw
[4799.199s] today and thank you for having me by the
[4800.8s] way was a continuation of a trend that
[4804.679s] started last July which was the
[4806.44s] broadening of the market the what I call
[4808.719s] the
[4809.8s] unmagnify everything other than the
[4811.96s] Magnificent 7 and the S&amp;P 500 really
[4814.76s] started to outperform up until December
[4817.48s] and right after the election and with
[4819.32s] some fed uncertainty in December uh mag
[4822.52s] mag 7 came back abruptly in De but now
[4825.199s] we&#39;re seeing a resumption of the trend
[4827.4s] the last shall be first those sectors
[4829.6s] that underperformed last year are
[4831.96s] beginning to outperform and you saw it
[4833.96s] healthc care was up today Industrials
[4835.84s] were up today materials were up and
[4838.48s] guess what was down magnificent 7 and
[4840.88s] that&#39;s the type of economy that we had
[4842.92s] under Trump 1.0 was a broad
[4846.04s] participation of regular everyday
[4848.08s] businesses starting to flourish from
[4850.0s] deregulation from lower taxes from lower
[4853.12s] energy more abundant energy and less
[4855.6s] regulations yeah speaking of energy
[4858.28s] we&#39;ve heard his comments about how he
[4860.32s] plans to to lower oil prices which could
[4863.48s] counter the inflationary effects of
[4865.88s] tariffs producers though of energy they
[4868.36s] won&#39;t be happy with that plan how
[4870.88s] realistic and how effective do you think
[4873.52s] the this these measures will
[4876.8s] be well I think he is going to be able
[4879.679s] to lower it short term I and I think the
[4882.08s] producers will be okay with it because
[4883.84s] the demand for energy is going to go up
[4885.719s] so dramatically with all the demand from
[4888.239s] AI from from the uh AI investment and
[4891.199s] data centers and the required energy
[4893.28s] we&#39;re going to need all the energy that
[4894.8s] we can possibly get whether it&#39;s natural
[4896.719s] gas whether it&#39;s oil whether it&#39;s coal
[4898.84s] whether it&#39;s nuclear whether it&#39;s
[4900.6s] Renewables uh everything is going to be
[4903.159s] part of that P in addition to lower
[4905.679s] energy cost to reduce inflation uh there
[4908.199s] is expectation that the department of
[4910.76s] government efficiency Doge will maybe
[4913.92s] not get to trillion of cuts maybe not
[4916.639s] even get $1 trillion of cuts but if they
[4919.0s] start to move towards a half of a
[4920.84s] trillion dollar of cuts it&#39;s going to
[4923.0s] signal to the market that this
[4924.96s] Administration is serious about fiscal
[4927.239s] responsibility and as a result of those
[4929.639s] actions what you are going to see is the
[4931.239s] market is going to bring interest rates
[4933.84s] down versus Trump simply demanding that
[4936.48s] interest rates go down uh the market is
[4938.76s] too big for any one of us that&#39;s for
[4940.32s] sure yeah speaking of interest rates
[4942.239s] we&#39;re also looking ahead to the FED
[4943.96s] needing next week how much of the Trump
[4946.76s] Factor do you think will fare into their
[4949.199s] assessment and their their moves when it
[4952.0s] comes to
[4954.56s] policy yeah I think there&#39;s a 0% chance
[4957.56s] there will be an effect uh in policy for
[4960.639s] this meeting however if you recall the
[4963.679s] the the boat had shifted after everyone
[4965.76s] had shifted to one side of the boat
[4967.48s] after the December meeting and that is
[4969.52s] people expected one to zero cuts and
[4973.0s] some people are even talking about hikes
[4975.12s] until we got those inflation numbers and
[4978.0s] now people are more the market is more
[4980.08s] in line with the summary of economic
[4983.04s] projections that we got from the FED at
[4984.719s] the last meeting which is two cuts for
[4988.28s] 2025 but sometime later in the year if
[4990.76s] not March probably June and then
[4992.92s] September is more likely but I think the
[4995.56s] market is now aligned with the idea of
[4997.88s] two cuts versus this concept that maybe
[5000.32s] they were going to hike after we saw the
[5002.08s] inflation numbers that put the market at
[5003.679s] ease and think that will be reflected in
[5005.84s] some of the commentary coming out of the
[5007.32s] FED certainly uh very unlikely that we
[5009.88s] get a cut this month uh or sooner than
[5012.639s] March but more likely second half of the
[5014.76s] year two cuts for sure and that&#39;ll be
[5016.48s] positive for interest rates debt
[5018.08s] refinancing and the US net interest
[5020.96s] payments which have gone from under a
[5023.04s] half a half a trillion dollars to over a
[5025.159s] trillion so we we need to get that under
[5027.12s] control yeah um speaking of rates the US
[5030.84s] 10-year yield gaining before the Trump
[5033.76s] inauguration now where do you see us 10
[5037.159s] years
[5039.4s] headed I think this is very similar to
[5043.12s] what happened in 2016 Sarah after the
[5047.4s] election the rates went up dramatically
[5050.76s] after the inauguration they really
[5052.56s] rolled over and came down quite a bit in
[5054.96s] the year of 2017 his first year of his
[5057.8s] first term same thing with the dollar
[5059.92s] rallied after the election and then
[5061.679s] after the inauguration weakened quite a
[5063.56s] bit and AAL stocks did well after the
[5066.96s] inauguration part so I think we have the
[5069.04s] exact same theme happening rates went up
[5071.679s] dollar went up now it&#39;s after the
[5073.199s] inauguration they&#39;re starting to come in
[5074.639s] a little bit I would expect to see that
[5076.56s] theme which very few people are
[5078.0s] positioned for a lot of people are
[5079.56s] crowding into Long Dollar crowding into
[5082.08s] short bonds I think you want to be on
[5083.679s] the opposite side of that trade yields
[5086.199s] lower dollar lower for the next 12
[5088.719s] months and that will be take a lot of
[5090.639s] people by surprise but it will be good
[5092.199s] for the global economy good for the US
[5094.44s] good for markets Thomas we&#39;ll see how it
[5096.639s] all pans out appreciate your insights
[5098.44s] Thomas Hayes there chairman and managing
[5101.08s] member at a great Hill
[5104.84s] capital and we&#39;re back quote of the week
[5107.52s] from a guy I&#39;ve never heard of named
[5108.96s] Bill boner but what he says is if you
[5111.44s] look carefully almost all old money
[5114.32s] Secrets can be traced to a single Source
[5117.239s] a longer term Outlook we couldn&#39;t agree
[5121.56s] more and we try to impart that every
[5123.36s] single week and for those of you who&#39;ve
[5125.159s] been with us for a while you see these
[5127.0s] things they take time and when they go
[5129.119s] they go uh whe it&#39;s the latest ones you
[5133.8s] know VF Corp is almost is is knocking on
[5136.48s] the door for a double Comstock is
[5138.44s] knocking on the door probably be a
[5140.4s] triple pretty soon uh and that&#39;s just
[5142.639s] the beginning there&#39;s so much awesome
[5144.4s] stuff happening uh got to take the
[5146.36s] long-term view uh Europe wasn&#39;t always
[5148.6s] such a bargain so it talks about the
[5150.239s] valuation Gap wide and that closing
[5152.4s] we&#39;ll talk a little bit about that this
[5153.92s] week here&#39;s a dollar CH chart people
[5156.679s] crowded in the most that they&#39;ve been
[5158.8s] this crowded into Long Dollar uh since
[5162.04s] you rubber banded back every other time
[5164.0s] in history let&#39;s get through these
[5165.84s] charts quickly because we got so much
[5167.56s] going on this week uh small caps bounced
[5170.119s] off this uh this trend
[5172.28s] line uh this is an interesting chart uh
[5176.119s] before 1992 the average recession was 19
[5180.119s] months now it&#39;s eight months so that&#39;s
[5181.6s] something interesting to show
[5185.159s] uh going back to 1945 something to keep
[5187.92s] in mind maybe the FED is more active
[5189.6s] than they had been uh Price is Right
[5192.32s] fed&#39;s 50 basis point cut uh this
[5196.6s] shows 10year yield rolling average
[5199.44s] annualized returns and you can see when
[5201.199s] it gets this beaten down you get a move
[5203.8s] in TLT so I think someone asked on
[5206.04s] Twitter today do you still think yields
[5207.76s] are going down 100% uh it&#39;s not going to
[5210.92s] be because Trump demands that they go
[5213.44s] down but that this certainly won&#39;t hurt
[5215.239s] what it&#39;s going to be is Doge starts
[5216.96s] cutting the market starts to perceive
[5218.719s] all the things that we discussed on the
[5220.719s] interviews you can see here sentiment is
[5223.119s] at the right levels not levels you want
[5224.56s] to be a seller which we&#39;ve been talking
[5226.0s] about and we&#39;ve seen now that follow
[5228.6s] through
[5230.679s] um uh Commodities long-term return
[5233.639s] starting to pick up here we&#39;re seeing in
[5235.239s] natural gas and others small cap stocks
[5238.239s] need to stay above the 2021 highs uh
[5241.08s] they&#39;re they&#39;re going to do that I think
[5243.48s] that&#39;s going to be the big story here
[5245.199s] we&#39;re already starting to see today was
[5246.56s] a great example upturn now but flipflops
[5249.4s] Galore so this is talking about the
[5250.8s] phase one recoveries that we&#39;ve talked
[5252.679s] here&#39;s where we are where value small
[5254.44s] size starts to outperform coming after
[5258.44s] the uh high quality large size which we
[5262.679s] saw last year and this is just a normal
[5264.639s] regular regime you got to know what
[5266.239s] phase you&#39;re in and take advantage this
[5268.679s] is uh indicative of that going back to
[5270.88s] 2021 dividend yield inexpensive versus
[5273.719s] history we&#39;ve been talking about that
[5275.08s] for 6 months that is now playing out
[5277.639s] neglected by managers value versus
[5279.84s] growth best generational opportunity
[5282.239s] since uh 2001 and before that
[5285.199s] 1980 uh history doesn&#39;t rhyme repeat but
[5288.199s] it does rhyme and that&#39;s what&#39;s
[5289.52s] happening growth versus value at xco
[5292.04s] highs well above the uh Tech highs we&#39;ve
[5295.28s] covered all that and why it&#39;s based in
[5297.44s] fundamentals is not just looking at
[5298.84s] charts and saying it has to mean in
[5300.08s] revert why does it have to mean revert
[5302.52s] and you can look at the data and the
[5303.88s] earning earnings deceleration versus
[5305.719s] acceleration and the policies on the
[5307.48s] table like we covered with uh um Sarah
[5312.48s] on
[5314.0s] CNA so I just like to show this stuff
[5317.719s] value outperform growth after the last
[5319.52s] fed cut we&#39;re going to see more of that
[5322.04s] China City&#39;s home price tracker ticking
[5324.4s] higher and I&#39;m moving fast because we
[5326.28s] just got like so many ask me anything
[5328.4s] questions this week and so much great
[5330.76s] information it&#39;s like a fire hose in
[5332.159s] January it will slow down next week will
[5333.8s] probably be a lot slower and then you&#39;ll
[5335.719s] be saying that the podcast is too short
[5338.52s] uh but uh look I just do my thing it
[5341.679s] goes to show I mean this is like 10% of
[5343.88s] the work we do so um and by the way
[5346.239s] congratulations to all the clients that
[5347.639s] got in under the wire if you put in your
[5349.44s] paperwork and we&#39;ve talked and you
[5350.92s] didn&#39;t fund yet um uh but you&#39;re in the
[5354.36s] process of getting approved by
[5355.56s] interactive brokers we are closed to new
[5358.84s] uh inquiries but if you&#39;re finishing
[5360.44s] your process you can go ahead and do
[5362.0s] that super excited this is going to be
[5364.44s] one of those raises I believe that
[5365.92s] people have come in the last few
[5367.159s] quarters it&#39;s going to be like uh the
[5369.84s] raise in Fall of
[5373.52s] 2022 when everyone was Sellers and those
[5376.159s] of you who came in did unbelievable and
[5378.92s] uh March 2023 when I was pounding the
[5381.239s] table you got to come in now and a lot
[5382.719s] of you did and uh and and and it was
[5386.04s] just unbelievable so this is uh everyone
[5389.159s] in the boat right now we&#39;re going to
[5390.76s] rock and roll I&#39;m super excited for you
[5393.8s] uh those who come in in the future will
[5395.36s] find things for you to do but there are
[5396.88s] certain times when you got to take
[5398.36s] action and this is one of those times
[5399.76s] and I&#39;m super excited for everyone who
[5402.0s] stepped up to the call and um I&#39;m super
[5404.8s] excited for us and I&#39;m really more super
[5407.719s] excited for you I I I I&#39;ve been through
[5410.719s] these cycles and I know
[5413.28s] what&#39;s happening and and I&#39;m I&#39;m just
[5416.36s] I&#39;m excited for everyone that&#39;s that&#39;s
[5418.199s] uh that&#39;s with me um Chinese docs uh
[5422.679s] best week in three months
[5425.04s] uh consecutive days with more than 70%
[5427.28s] of stocks advancing so you see that
[5429.119s] coming out of big troughs that&#39;s good
[5430.92s] news uh and what
[5433.48s] happens uh one year later on average up
[5437.08s] 10.63% so breath is improving we uh
[5440.56s] don&#39;t need to over hit that also uh S&amp;P
[5445.88s] 500 after not touching 200 day moving
[5449.0s] average uh for a certain period this is
[5451.4s] all the fun Strat stuff which is great
[5453.159s] and bespoke a year later you&#39;re up 13.4
[5456.56s] which is in line with what we&#39;re
[5457.6s] thinking for the indices 8 to 12 and for
[5459.88s] under the surface fortunes are going to
[5461.6s] be made they won&#39;t move the needle on
[5463.119s] the indices because the weights are low
[5464.639s] right now those weights will go up just
[5466.44s] like what happened with energy in 2020
[5468.719s] when we were pounding the hell with uh
[5471.76s] uh xon at $33 and said you know oil was
[5474.52s] negative we&#39;re saying buy the hell out
[5476.08s] of everything in oil and then after they
[5478.119s] all doubled and tripled everyone got
[5479.76s] interested in oil we were laying off uh
[5482.0s] and they did nothing for two years so
[5484.639s] uh housing affordability this has to
[5486.76s] change it&#39;s going to change Trump&#39;s
[5488.56s] going to find a way to deregulate build
[5490.679s] like crazy smaller Footprints more
[5493.08s] houses bring down the cost much
[5496.04s] more earnings growth is expected to
[5498.36s] broaden we&#39;ve covered that a million
[5500.159s] times truck land demo uh truck load
[5503.239s] demand is going up that&#39;s a good
[5505.119s] indicator truck indicator and ISM move
[5508.04s] together trucks are going up ism is
[5510.239s] going to move up we&#39;re coming out of
[5511.52s] this manufacturing recession quickly
[5516.119s] um what else do we have here goods and
[5518.76s] services consumption uh starting to
[5523.44s] improve
[5525.239s] materials highest operating leverage you
[5527.6s] can see here Industrials consumer
[5530.52s] discretion energy we&#39;ve got the
[5532.8s] Industrials exposure we&#39;ve got the
[5534.32s] materials exposure healthc care is
[5536.0s] another piece which we&#39;ve been talking
[5537.44s] about in the context of last Shelby
[5539.04s] first with Taylor two weeks ago and now
[5541.56s] that it&#39;s happening two weeks again and
[5543.96s] and then demand recovery equals higher
[5546.56s] margins we&#39;re seeing this in earnings
[5549.159s] things are positive ladies and gentlemen
[5551.28s] and uh animal spirits are certainly back
[5553.679s] the question is how much is priced in
[5555.52s] and the answer is a lot&#39;s priced in for
[5557.32s] mag 7 Not A lot&#39;s priced in for UNM mag
[5560.0s] 493 International small cap value the
[5562.8s] things that we&#39;re in which are now
[5563.96s] starting to get bid like crazy existing
[5566.4s] home sales da we know that story uh FX
[5570.48s] could be a much bigger headwind in 2025
[5572.52s] so I think that&#39;s where you&#39;re going to
[5573.4s] see some guidance issues you had a
[5575.48s] strong Dollar in Q4 that&#39;s going to
[5577.52s] weaken but that&#39;s going to make guidance
[5579.28s] more conservative which is typical in
[5581.52s] the first quarter of every year guidance
[5583.239s] gets super conservative they&#39;ll use the
[5585.199s] FX as an excuse and then the dollar will
[5587.52s] weaken and they&#39;ll say oh what do you
[5588.679s] know we did better than expected uh
[5591.32s] secret to happiness is low expectations
[5593.719s] my buddy Rick got me a ballark I use
[5595.719s] every single day day that I play uh
[5598.84s] which just reminds me to chill out have
[5600.719s] fun and let things drop and I got to say
[5604.119s] uh my game was an absolute disaster when
[5606.6s] I came out here uh embarrassing disaster
[5609.32s] after 3 or 4 months off and it&#39;s
[5611.44s] starting to click again and it&#39;s super
[5614.119s] exciting um you know it&#39;s funny I anyway
[5619.52s] um all right we&#39;ll talk about my golf
[5621.719s] game another time uh moving
[5625.32s] along semiconductors this is talking
[5628.4s] about the return on invested Capital
[5629.84s] that I&#39;ve talked about with hyperscaler
[5631.719s] cap Xs decelerating and margin
[5633.92s] compressing and all that stuff they&#39;re
[5635.0s] not getting the return all this stuff
[5637.08s] that we think is going to happen how AI
[5639.199s] is going to make the world great is
[5640.4s] going to happen the question is how much
[5641.8s] is already priced the answer is uh
[5644.639s] enough for us to be more interested in
[5646.6s] some other opportunities that are going
[5647.76s] to be the beneficiaries versus the
[5649.44s] investors in all that capex uh
[5652.639s] seasonality weakest guidance period we
[5654.6s] just covered
[5657.48s] that GDP now is tracking at 3% that&#39;s
[5660.84s] not an environment that you see a
[5662.28s] recession for all the negative
[5664.56s] uh Nellies that were out there the last
[5666.52s] few weeks good luck fed Manufacturing
[5668.8s] Index through the roof this is all in
[5670.88s] line with what I&#39;ve been saying what
[5672.28s] follows when those indexes rock and roll
[5675.119s] is the ism we rock and roll years of
[5677.639s] stagnant economic cyclicality we are
[5680.0s] finally set for a reacceleration in 2025
[5683.199s] when they&#39;re talking about economic
[5684.4s] cyclicality they&#39;re talking about ISM
[5686.119s] Manufacturing and service it&#39;s been dead
[5688.56s] for 2 years we&#39;ve been in a
[5690.28s] manufacturing depression like 2007 to
[5693.119s] 2009 like 2000 to 2002 and then what
[5696.36s] happened straight up value small caps
[5698.76s] Industrials all the things that make the
[5700.4s] world go around super excited beige book
[5703.119s] activity ticking up China GDP you know
[5706.6s] 5.4 crushed estimates no one&#39;s talking
[5709.199s] about it they will they were all worried
[5710.679s] about that Trump and X had a beautiful
[5714.08s] call uh Trump said he was 60% day one
[5717.679s] now it&#39;s maybe 10% maybe do a phone call
[5720.679s] maybe that China helps with Russia and
[5722.6s] gets off the hook completely maybe they
[5724.239s] do a Tik Tock deal and maybe no one has
[5726.48s] any idea what&#39;s about to come except for
[5728.8s] the folks on this podcast um industrial
[5733.639s] production going up in China not down
[5736.08s] retail sales going up not down new home
[5739.36s] prices are starting to recover existing
[5742.719s] home prices starting to recover after
[5745.88s] four years uh China new home prices
[5749.199s] stabilized with stimulus push stimulus
[5751.88s] that&#39;s all pigging the python it&#39;s
[5753.76s] starting to come out it&#39;s going to come
[5755.08s] out all at once it&#39;s built up pushing
[5757.4s] the beach ball underwater when it comes
[5759.08s] out it comes out it hot and it comes out
[5761.8s] aggressive and you won&#39;t be able to
[5763.28s] catch it and um and that&#39;s going to be
[5765.92s] super duper fun because we&#39;re going to
[5768.119s] we&#39;re going to make up on on one
[5771.04s] position you know two three years of irr
[5774.199s] in probably 6 n months and exceed our
[5777.239s] our IR hurdle that we internally uh uh
[5781.36s] commit to uh for what we do in terms of
[5784.92s] internal expectations and then set exp
[5787.56s] external expectations much lower so
[5790.159s] pretty excited about that Global LNG
[5793.04s] shortfalls are forecast until 2027 com
[5796.56s] stock baby you rocking and rolling I
[5798.88s] remember we couldn&#39;t they couldn&#39;t give
[5800.88s] it away at 8 now at 25 everyone&#39;s
[5803.08s] interested sending me all these natural
[5805.0s] gas articles and everything else it&#39;s
[5806.639s] like okay uh thank you so Advanced
[5809.679s] decline breath is starting to improve
[5811.719s] all the things that we&#39;ve been pounding
[5813.84s] that got sidetracked in December are now
[5816.0s] coming back on Trend since uh J July of
[5819.92s] last year manufacturing production
[5821.96s] through the roof that&#39;s aircraft and
[5824.28s] parts that&#39;s exciting economic surprise
[5826.96s] index moving back up that&#39;s cities
[5829.56s] sources say Intel is an acquisition
[5831.56s] Target maybe it&#39;s Elon maybe it&#39;s
[5833.6s] someone else the key is it&#39;s in play one
[5836.639s] Catalyst or another either they get
[5838.32s] bought and if it&#39;s a good enough company
[5840.4s] hopefully we get stock and we can
[5841.96s] continue to ride it if it&#39;s a
[5845.44s] um uh or we could get a new CEO first
[5848.76s] and they say we&#39;re not for sale
[5850.4s] shortterm it&#39;ll sell down and then it&#39;ll
[5852.48s] go up because basically gelsinger&#39;s plan
[5855.28s] is 99% done they quit at the 10 yard
[5857.679s] line so we&#39;re excited about that Trump
[5860.4s] trade memorandum won&#39;t impose new
[5862.84s] tariffs day one we saw that 10-year
[5865.4s] yield is coming back down just like we
[5868.159s] thought it would after the uh
[5870.56s] election I&#39;m sorry after the
[5872.28s] inauguration
[5874.04s] uh we talked about that on
[5875.8s] CNA largest monthly rotation into EU
[5878.599s] stocks in the past 25 years when&#39;s the
[5881.0s] last time this happened going back to
[5882.44s] when 2001 which we talk about every
[5884.719s] single week and also in 2014 another
[5887.48s] great good time for those International
[5889.76s] stocks boom out of us into Euro Zone
[5892.52s] rock and roll baby why partially uh uh
[5896.0s] Japan&#39;s going to start hiking we&#39;ll talk
[5897.639s] about that uh Chinese uh stopped
[5900.8s] weakening their currency so we got a
[5902.84s] little bit of strength relative to Yuan
[5904.92s] that&#39;s what you see before rallies in
[5906.76s] China
[5907.88s] equities uh big big move one of the
[5910.32s] largest moves in over half a
[5913.08s] year decade to date inflows of Equity
[5916.48s] Funds nothing into International
[5918.44s] everything into us this is going to flip
[5920.239s] on its head in 2025 and 2026 here&#39;s the
[5923.719s] value of US trade goods by
[5927.32s] partner uh all you really need to know
[5931.96s] here is uh uh I didn&#39;t have this chart
[5935.44s] but basically
[5939.08s] China
[5942.0s] China China was like 590 billion of five
[5946.52s] trillion of trade they&#39;re actually not a
[5948.36s] huge amount um anyway moving
[5952.36s] along uh number of executive orders by
[5955.199s] President so everyone&#39;s saying Trump is
[5956.84s] out of control with his executive orders
[5958.76s] pales in comparison to FDR Herbert
[5960.88s] Hoover Warren Harding uh it&#39;s Etc uh
[5964.44s] interest rates since 3 3000 BC we see
[5967.199s] these spikes everyone keeps looking at
[5968.84s] recency bias thinking it&#39;s going to be
[5970.8s] like 1980 it&#39;s just the opposite these
[5972.76s] are regular things that you see over the
[5974.92s] last few th thousand years they Spike up
[5977.679s] they come back down they Spike up mostly
[5979.96s] a downtrend with the exception of 1980
[5982.76s] and that&#39;s why everyone&#39;s got their
[5984.239s] thinking backwards on this and um you
[5987.599s] know
[5991.4s] even uh in different periods so that&#39;s
[5994.599s] that top 10 companies percent of S&amp;P
[5997.52s] market cap look this is this is crazy
[5999.36s] town ladies and gentlemen so you can you
[6001.56s] can chase these but eventually you&#39;re
[6003.36s] going to get hurt maybe it&#39;s two years
[6004.92s] from now you know there&#39;s a saying the
[6006.679s] market can stay irrational longer than
[6008.239s] you can stay solvent that really only
[6009.92s] applies to people who use a ton of
[6011.4s] Leverage and are day trading you know
[6013.4s] people and get get you know sell the
[6015.52s] bottom buy the tops and get you know
[6017.92s] just whip sought around if you know what
[6019.48s] you own and you&#39;re pay paying a good
[6021.199s] price price is what you pay value is
[6022.679s] what you get you you don&#39;t worry about
[6023.84s] the short-term fluctuations you&#39;re not
[6025.32s] getting margin called cuz you&#39;re on very
[6027.48s] low to no leverage and you just ride it
[6029.8s] through until you get your doubles
[6031.04s] triples quadruples and then you lay it
[6032.76s] off to all the people that are excited
[6034.239s] about it that were selling to you in the
[6036.04s] hole when no one was excited about it
[6037.84s] and you rinse and repeat and you do it
[6039.28s] over and over this is not rocket science
[6041.4s] it just takes ice in your veins and for
[6043.48s] most people they say I you know I have
[6046.92s] you know uh regular temperature water in
[6049.4s] my veins I&#39;m going to lay it off to the
[6050.92s] guy with ice in his veins so I don&#39;t
[6052.28s] have to think about it and I can go be
[6054.119s] brilliant at my business that makes all
[6055.76s] the money and lay off the cash for
[6058.199s] someone else to manage so I don&#39;t have
[6059.599s] to think about it and uh and and they
[6062.119s] can go to the beach and enjoy life with
[6063.84s] their family uh percent of companies
[6066.0s] outperforming the S&amp;P 500 since 1990 so
[6069.639s] we haven&#39;t seen this level of uh
[6071.92s] companies underperform the S&amp;P since
[6075.04s] when since the early 2000s when what
[6077.76s] happened small caps value International
[6080.159s] started to dramatically
[6082.08s] outperform uh uh here we go same thing
[6086.04s] this is the
[6087.56s] uh relative performance to US versus
[6091.52s] xus and this is at a level of you know
[6095.56s] two three standard deviations above the
[6097.56s] mean well more than the internet bubble
[6100.04s] well more than nifty50 so keep piling
[6102.36s] into those and pray for pray for the
[6104.48s] best um uh you better make sure you put
[6109.0s] a lot in the basket when you go to
[6110.48s] church CU you&#39;re going to need it uh us
[6113.239s] value versus growth relative performance
[6115.159s] so yes we see this Zer error value and
[6117.92s] outperformed growth for uh you know 78
[6121.88s] decades and then you have a zero
[6123.88s] interest rate uh policy for a while
[6126.599s] which is over unless you believe rates
[6128.84s] are going back to zero if you&#39;re stuck
[6131.0s] in this good luck ladies and gentlemen
[6133.239s] is all I have to say uh us duties
[6135.8s] collected we&#39;ve covered this before for
[6137.4s] everyone saying tariffs are going to
[6138.48s] cause a depression we have the lowest
[6140.199s] tariffs that we&#39;ve had in hundreds of
[6141.96s] year in in over uh century and even in
[6145.48s] the Spanish Flu 19808 we started at 6%
[6149.88s] uh uh of Duties collected on total
[6152.4s] Imports we&#39;re currently at like 3% so
[6155.08s] even if we went to 6% uh um they raised
[6158.84s] tariffs from 1918 to 1930 from 6% to 20
[6164.52s] almost 20% before the depression so
[6166.8s] everyone saying if he does tariffs we&#39;re
[6168.119s] going into a depression obviously he&#39;s
[6170.08s] never read a history book and is kind of
[6171.76s] a joke but um there are plenty of people
[6174.599s] who don&#39;t read history books that are
[6176.56s] pretty you know uh always wrong and
[6178.88s] never in doubt and unburdened by the
[6180.92s] facts of history but um Global share of
[6184.119s] automotive car production by re country
[6187.08s] region uh China&#39;s kicking but they&#39;ve
[6189.719s] just been taking share from everyone and
[6192.199s] us has been losing share because we are
[6194.32s] in the business of healthcare and
[6196.119s] annuities not making cars uh but we&#39;re
[6199.76s] making enough cars that Cooper standard
[6201.48s] is going to rock and roll and Cooper is
[6203.4s] also benefiting from China uh as you if
[6206.4s] you listened to and read the most recent
[6209.04s] conference calls they were surprised how
[6211.4s] well their China Partnerships were going
[6213.8s] uh and I&#39;ll leave it at that you can do
[6215.52s] your own work on that Commodities 10year
[6217.679s] analyed returns coming back uh like a
[6220.32s] phoenix From the Ashes just like the
[6221.92s] early 2000s and other cyclical periods
[6225.92s] it&#39;s not often stocks break a record
[6227.48s] dating back 97 years it just did so with
[6230.48s] the six straight session with two out of
[6232.44s] every three stock in the S&amp;P advancing
[6236.04s] uh that is very sign a positive sign of
[6239.48s] breath here&#39;s China anytime you&#39;ve seen
[6241.719s] shorted interest uh this extreme always
[6245.0s] preceded a major rally in China stocks
[6247.719s] we are twice as Extreme as we&#39;ve been
[6250.199s] during those periods which means the
[6252.52s] beach ball is pushed twice underwater
[6254.639s] when you have that level of pressure
[6256.719s] acute pressure when when it is released
[6259.76s] the move will be so abrupt and so
[6261.92s] massive that uh people will just miss it
[6264.76s] is really what it comes down to they&#39;ll
[6266.119s] be buying up double and triple and we&#39;ll
[6268.199s] be handily helping them out and giving
[6270.639s] them all that they need uh here is uh
[6274.96s] new regime sends Chinese Tech outflows
[6276.599s] to extreme we view this contrarily and
[6280.44s] opportunistically uh we agree by the way
[6282.84s] nice chart here from
[6284.4s] renmac uh Seth golden uh forwarding fun
[6288.239s] Strat stuff when ism is less than 50 for
[6292.56s] uh at least 12 consecutive months
[6293.96s] delivers positive returns both 3 and 6
[6295.8s] months forwarded some 92% of the time uh
[6299.52s] and you can see here 12 months out up
[6302.44s] 99.4% SNP earnings
[6306.28s] analysis uh what do we have
[6309.119s] here Q4 2024 earnings results relative
[6313.0s] to consensus up
[6314.88s] 88.9% 75% companies beating I think
[6318.0s] that&#39;s gone up we&#39;ll cover that with fax
[6319.599s] set a little bit
[6320.8s] later um stock have done quite well in
[6323.88s] the first year of a new presidential
[6325.96s] term lately you can see uh going back to
[6328.36s] 2025 It&#39;s Always a Good Year and quite a
[6330.639s] good year going back to
[6333.96s] 2009 so we&#39;ll see if that repeats I&#39;m
[6337.48s] more uh conservative than this but uh i&#39;
[6341.599s] I&#39;d be more than willing to accept uh
[6344.04s] another amazing uh set of returns EU
[6347.96s] passenger car registrations going up
[6350.0s] just like us everywhere going up up up
[6353.0s] incentives going up volumes going up
[6355.159s] margins for oems going down units going
[6358.44s] up which benefits the suppliers Bank of
[6361.28s] Japan heads toward raid hike as Market
[6364.08s] take Trump in stride hike means carry
[6366.92s] trade on wine means mag seven pressure
[6369.88s] uh Trump says he&#39;s considering a 10%
[6371.76s] tariff on China beginning as soon as
[6373.04s] February 1st this was a few days ago
[6375.04s] today he was saying he has a great
[6376.36s] relationship with G and uh he wants G to
[6380.04s] help on the fent andol he wants G to
[6381.96s] help on uh Russia to get the war done
[6385.04s] and if G helps uh he&#39;s going to get
[6387.04s] Benny&#39;s and if he gets Benny&#39;s then
[6389.08s] these stocks are not priced for that and
[6391.44s] uh we could see something like we
[6393.4s] haven&#39;t seen in since 2016 which is uh
[6396.84s] 2017 where they just go parabolic in 11
[6399.88s] months uh Equity positioning across
[6402.4s] sectors so no one&#39;s in real estate
[6404.4s] materials and Healthcare what&#39;s been
[6405.679s] doing the best Healthcare materials
[6407.84s] which we talked about before the end of
[6409.239s] the year No One believed us that&#39;s
[6410.599s] what&#39;s happened everyone&#39;s in Tech and
[6413.719s] uh they&#39;ve been basically grinding
[6415.08s] sideways since the summer if you look at
[6417.08s] it honestly they were down going into
[6419.4s] December they had a rally so it feels
[6420.88s] like everything&#39;s going up go look at it
[6422.639s] back since July when we got out of the
[6425.119s] Amazon and the Google that more than
[6427.0s] doubled uh you&#39;ll see consensus on the
[6429.76s] US dollar is bullish contrarily to
[6431.84s] bullish we agree Dollar&#39;s going down
[6434.679s] yields are going down household debt to
[6436.599s] income is relatively low in the US
[6438.52s] consumer in good shape us net interest
[6441.4s] expense we covered
[6443.92s] um was a half a trillion now it&#39;s over a
[6446.199s] trillion they got to start making some
[6448.04s] Cuts with Doge we covered that on
[6450.44s] CNA uh covered the Chinese
[6453.76s] Yuan uh S&amp;P 500 after mlen oscillator
[6457.96s] goes from negative 120 to positive 100
[6460.76s] in 30 days one year later up
[6464.28s] 15.6% these are all breath things here&#39;s
[6466.88s] that December car sales volume which
[6468.719s] blew the blew the doors off expectations
[6471.239s] 16.8 mil annualize
[6473.36s] now if we actually get a number above 16
[6475.48s] annual we&#39;re going to Mint money at
[6477.04s] Cooper thing&#39;s going to shoot out a out
[6479.32s] of a cannon like a rocket and we&#39;re
[6481.719s] going to Mint even more coin uh if you
[6485.08s] all have been with us for a while we
[6486.56s] started building the position in May
[6488.56s] 2022 at
[6490.56s] $510 it&#39;s now 16 uh that it hasn&#39;t even
[6494.84s] begun uh is all I can is is our view
[6498.08s] moving on uh from my buddy oh sending me
[6501.119s] over this is some of sler
[6503.4s] stuff you can see the S&amp;P closed at
[6505.92s] record uh highs the momentum is just
[6507.76s] turning up on a weekly basis so that&#39;s
[6509.8s] good news 10-year yield rolling over
[6512.32s] momentum is overdone and weakening same
[6514.76s] with the dollar momentum overdone and
[6516.88s] weakening sentiment mid level that&#39;s not
[6519.719s] what you see at tops utility starting to
[6522.32s] bounce re starting to bounce we&#39;ve told
[6524.52s] it you that was coming here&#39;s albamar
[6527.04s] beautiful chart broke the trend back
[6529.08s] tested on its way up that&#39;s our material
[6531.199s] exposure in addition to comto very
[6533.28s] excited about that here is a key note
[6535.639s] from hartnet over at the Bank of America
[6538.599s] fund manager survey I love looking at
[6540.52s] his contrarian trades he&#39;s one of the
[6542.08s] best strategists in the business in my
[6543.76s] view sometimes he goes off the rails but

[6776.56s] Target uh China which is by the way
[6779.28s] that&#39;s all we need is a few weeks of
[6780.52s] people speculating that it&#39;s going to
[6781.719s] get bought until they announce a new CEO
[6784.0s] and then the new CEO will come out and
[6785.719s] say yeah we&#39;re kind of at the uh fifth
[6788.239s] yard line here we&#39;re about to spike the
[6790.079s] ball we&#39;re not selling to anyone uh
[6792.88s] China&#39;s fourth quarter GDP grows at 5.4%
[6795.88s] beating Market expectations of stimulus
[6797.639s] measures kick in now if Qualcomm was to
[6799.599s] buy them I would take Qualcomm stock at
[6801.28s] this price that&#39;s for sure
[6803.36s] uh I would even take tsmc stock
[6805.599s] potentially at this
[6806.92s] price um so there are some options where
[6811.04s] I would take paper and be a holder but
[6814.079s] not a lot of them China home prices fall
[6816.639s] at slower Pace we covered that fed may
[6819.159s] cut rates sooner and faster than

[6829.44s] more stocks we love it cheap not Trump
[6831.8s] is why European an stocks are spiking
[6834.239s] this is from uh a very smart and usually
[6837.4s] pessimistic author named John authors I
[6840.079s] still follow his stuff because uh he&#39;s
[6842.76s] data driven chronically pessimistic tilt
[6846.239s] but I I I love the way he presents it
[6849.639s] and I learn from uh that Viewpoint and
[6853.239s] um it&#39;s just part of the Mosaic of
[6855.28s] information I like to intake uh BFA says
[6858.159s] benign Trump policies to spark rally in
[6860.32s] stock laggards this was the that I was
[6862.88s] looking for we couldn&#39;t agree more just
[6865.96s] look if passes any prologue we covered
[6868.32s] all that with um Sarah on CNA Chona
[6873.52s] China Social Security fund told to buy
[6875.679s] stocks I mean it doesn&#39;t get any clearer
[6878.44s] this is what terer was talking about
[6879.96s] this is what we&#39;ve been talking about
[6881.599s] they are going to throw the sink kitchen
[6884.28s] sink at this thing and they are going to
[6885.88s] juice the market now that they are
[6888.639s] talking and we&#39;re getting some more
[6890.239s] clarity on where tariffs are going to
[6892.079s] Shi out with Trump saying today we
[6894.0s] already tax them a lot because we
[6895.84s] already tariff them a lot because of me
[6897.719s] and he wants Partners to get this Russia
[6899.48s] War done start rebuilding the Ukraine uh
[6903.4s] the whole story a lot of money is going
[6904.96s] to be made rebuilding Ukraine by the way
[6907.32s] China eases rules for long-term funds to

[6912.199s] mutual funds insurers to invest more in
[6914.32s] stocks you get the picture make up stock
[6916.639s] market and sentiment results kudos to
[6918.8s] Jeff Adams who helped out with this
[6920.719s] yesterday did a great job job we covered
[6923.28s] all the uh media appearances Bank of
[6925.719s] America fund manager survey top five
[6927.88s] points most bullish Catalyst for 2025
[6931.599s] remains China growth acceleration two
[6934.52s] managers are dramatically underweight
[6936.32s] materials and energy three second
[6939.119s] largest monthly rotation into EU stocks
[6941.4s] in 25 years four rotation into healthc
[6944.639s] care and commodi started the year we
[6946.719s] talked about that before the start of
[6948.239s] the Year hope you guys were able to take
[6950.8s] advantage macro Outlook still has plenty
[6952.88s] of room to improve we agree and Estee
[6956.32s] louder so we like to cover one or two
[6958.36s] stocks we&#39;ve talked about previously and
[6960.96s] uh in many cases have built a position
[6964.239s] uh Estee louder we&#39;re seeing cash flow
[6966.28s] start to re accelerate this was a
[6968.52s] cyclical trough pretty much uh
[6970.84s] attributable to little bit of
[6972.599s] mismanagements a lot of China weakness
[6975.599s] and now that&#39;s all coming back uh their
[6978.96s] long-term thing they&#39;re going to
[6980.199s] continue to earn a return on invested
[6983.0s] Capital well above their weighted
[6984.679s] average cost of capital which is the the
[6987.28s] definition of a high quality business
[6989.88s] and you can see historically they&#39;ve
[6992.199s] been growing at you know 23 on average
[6996.0s] over 20% return on invested Capital last
[6998.719s] two years they got hit that&#39;s going to
[7000.28s] re accelerate top Line&#39;s going to
[7002.079s] continue to grow people will pay
[7003.76s] anything to look good this is the best
[7005.679s] brand uh this owns Asia and Asia is
[7008.92s] coming back uh like crazy so you should
[7011.679s] read through all of his notations here
[7013.88s] on the Morning Star commentary but when
[7016.639s] you read it you are going to be really
[7019.639s] impressed and really interested this
[7022.4s] will take a little while because it got
[7023.92s] so destroyed but you know here&#39;s a stock
[7026.119s] that&#39;s down to whatever it is 70 bucks
[7028.88s] down from 300 and uh
[7033.239s] 350 uh at $80 I mean look it could hang
[7036.639s] around between 50 and 70 for 3 years
[7038.76s] before going back to 250 who cares but I
[7041.52s] think this one&#39;s probably going to
[7042.599s] recover pretty quickly with China and
[7045.4s] I&#39;m getting a lot more confidence in
[7047.159s] China where I want to get even more
[7049.48s] direct and indirect exposure to take
[7051.88s] advantage of something that happens
[7053.28s] every you know five six years that
[7055.0s] people forget these are cyclical things
[7058.0s] um they beat earnings they improved
[7060.56s] operational efficiency gross margin
[7062.56s] improved in the most recent quarter uh
[7064.96s] they got a new CEO who knows what he&#39;s
[7067.119s] doing so all these things position it to
[7070.28s] absolutely catapult the the rebound
[7072.679s] and China is the name of the game this
[7074.159s] is a brand that&#39;s been around for you
[7076.96s] know century plus it&#39;s the best of the
[7079.36s] best it will continue to be the best of
[7081.0s] the best and if they see upand comers
[7083.44s] which is what they do they&#39;re phenomenal
[7085.599s] Capital allocators they just buy them
[7087.4s] and tuck them in just like diio best in
[7089.48s] the business so um gp1s are not going to
[7092.639s] hurt uh Este louder if anything it&#39;s
[7094.76s] going to help it the skinnier people get
[7096.36s] the better they want to look they&#39;re
[7097.679s] going to be doing makeup like crazy so
[7099.56s] and all that money they save on food and
[7101.04s] alcohol they can put put in on their
[7102.84s] face so uh so we love it uh as I said we
[7106.36s] close the raise congrats to everyone
[7107.92s] that came in if you&#39;re still in process
[7109.88s] you&#39;re still in the game if you have not
[7111.44s] reached out for the million dooll
[7113.199s] accounts you&#39;re going to have to wait at
[7114.52s] least till Q2 5 million plus accounts
[7117.239s] can come in any time we do bespoke
[7119.159s] service but for the smaller accounts we
[7121.36s] want to focus on investing the next 10
[7123.32s] 10 weeks uh and then revisit opening to
[7125.8s] the smaller accounts then uh defense and
[7129.4s] Aerospace earnings estimates uh down by
[7132.599s] 75 basis points in the last 60 days
[7135.44s] energy down
[7137.36s] 4.5% again outside of comto there&#39;s
[7140.079s] nothing that were table Pounders paying
[7142.599s] attention to some servicers but not
[7144.4s] there yet uh 9 79% beat rate on the S&amp;P
[7148.88s] 500 estimates have held in there so
[7152.239s] that&#39;s all positive jobless numbers this
[7155.239s] week about in line nothing there and
[7158.599s] then on to the ask me anything questions
[7161.4s] so uh if you like short podcast tunee
[7164.159s] out now we&#39;ll see you next week if you
[7166.199s] like long podcast we got a ton of ask me
[7168.159s] anything questions we&#39;re going to get
[7169.4s] started with right from our beautiful
[7171.8s] incredible audience moving forward guys
[7174.199s] don&#39;t send me a question with 16 stocks
[7177.159s] to look at I don&#39;t have time and it&#39;s
[7179.32s] disrespectful to the other listeners um
[7182.239s] so I&#39;ll either just ignore those or uh
[7185.159s] we are going to have to start to curate
[7187.079s] questions because we&#39;re getting so many
[7189.48s] uh so make them good and make them count
[7191.36s] so you get in included if you don&#39;t get
[7193.119s] included don&#39;t take it personally
[7195.079s] there&#39;s just only so much bandwidth we
[7196.639s] have we can&#39;t be on for 4 hours every
[7198.44s] single week so JT investor seeing
[7202.04s] massive estimates about the ca wildfires
[7204.159s] he&#39;s saying are there are there uh
[7206.0s] Building Product suppliers or Regional
[7207.44s] Home Builders set to benefit look um I
[7211.44s] want to bet on Brad Jacobs he&#39;s going to
[7212.96s] do a rollup in the space he&#39;s he&#39;s
[7215.28s] whiffed on uh beacon beacon roof and
[7218.4s] suppli so far maybe he brings the offer
[7220.8s] up he&#39;ll get some plat form company
[7222.52s] he&#39;ll get it done this is the guy I want
[7224.0s] to bet with for the next 10 years on on
[7226.599s] uh home uh Home Building
[7229.719s] Supplies so uh I&#39;m sticking with Brad
[7233.0s] even though he hasn&#39;t gotten a deal done
[7234.52s] yet uh he&#39;s probably got more urgency to
[7238.719s] get it done and capacity to get it done
[7241.84s] than I have urgency for him to get it
[7243.8s] done as we&#39;re holders of qxo so I&#39;ll
[7246.159s] leave it at
[7247.239s] that uh Goran says uh look at vi v
[7254.199s] this is probably some software thing
[7255.8s] with no moat so I&#39;m going to probably
[7257.719s] not be interested but I&#39;ll take a look
[7260.639s] yeah so it&#39;s done nothing for 22 years
[7262.8s] why would anything change let&#39;s see if
[7265.4s] he has a thesis for
[7268.84s] it another stocking cycle about to begin
[7272.0s] I mean if they haven&#39;t had a stocking
[7273.719s] cycle in 22 years they&#39;re probably not
[7275.4s] going to have one now this looks like a
[7276.96s] dog and it probably is a bunch of
[7278.88s] management that dilutes owners and
[7281.48s] issues a ton of stock cash flows going
[7284.0s] down revenues are going down uh nothing
[7287.239s] I like about it yet let me just see if
[7289.28s] these guys are pigs and I can save our a
[7292.4s] lot of time if management doesn&#39;t
[7295.119s] respect equity and they make my slice of
[7297.199s] the pie smaller without my permission by
[7300.44s] duding me and issuing shares to
[7302.599s] themselves or at bad prices I will never
[7304.96s] do business with them um I I like to say
[7308.32s] they&#39;re either going to leave or I&#39;m
[7309.36s] going to leave and more likely it&#39;s
[7310.44s] going to be me leaving Okay so don&#39;t
[7312.079s] have an equity problem so what kind of
[7313.639s] problem do they have they have a
[7315.199s] lowquality business problem they get a a
[7317.4s] a return on invested Capital that&#39;s
[7319.04s] lower than their weighted average cost
[7320.84s] of capital and that&#39;s a sign of a bad
[7322.96s] business with no mop so uh I&#39;m going to
[7325.32s] be a pass on that one Patrick uh how did
[7329.679s] you come across your current stock
[7336.48s] selections uh Patrick I I mean it&#39;s so
[7341.199s] funny
[7342.8s] most just look at my daily reads which
[7345.639s] me very few people do I mean I read like
[7348.599s] 20 30 40 articles as I mean maybe more
[7352.32s] only 20 30 40 make it to my what I&#39;m
[7354.599s] reading today list that&#39;s starter then I
[7356.76s] get all the Wall Street research then
[7358.599s] I&#39;m constantly screening stocks every
[7360.4s] single day then I&#39;ve been reading annual
[7363.119s] reports and listening to conference
[7364.56s] calls for 20 some odd years so when I
[7367.88s] see something I I can react it&#39;s like
[7370.36s] how could Buffett do an 8 and a half
[7371.56s] billion
[7372.52s] deal with Goldman Sachs in 2008 from his
[7375.0s] bathtub because he&#39;s been studying the
[7376.88s] company for 20 years so he could
[7378.4s] allocate eight and a half billion
[7380.36s] dollars in five minutes not because he
[7382.28s] was being Reckless because he knew the
[7383.719s] company I know 90% of these companies
[7386.32s] and I see how they respond through
[7388.0s] cycles and when opportunity presents
[7390.079s] itself it&#39;s like the plumber you know he
[7391.92s] comes in in the old joke uh he comes in
[7395.8s] he Taps on the thing he says you know
[7397.92s] 400 bucks it&#39;s fixed they&#39;re like 400
[7400.36s] bucks that only took you a minute he
[7401.56s] goes yeah it was only $4 for the minute
[7404.32s] it was 396 for the 20 years of expertise
[7408.0s] that told me where to tap on it h which
[7410.8s] took only one minute and that&#39;s that&#39;s
[7412.639s] really what it comes down to there&#39;s no
[7413.96s] shortcut you got to do the work and
[7415.719s] experience it and if you don&#39;t love the
[7417.119s] game go build a business and lay it off
[7418.88s] to someone who&#39;s good who does love the
[7420.44s] game and does it 247 that you&#39;re never
[7422.239s] going to be able to compete with because
[7423.679s] you don&#39;t have two sets of 24 hours in
[7425.48s] one day Don L uh do you think with the
[7429.079s] beginning of a Nat gas super cycle given
[7431.0s] AI needs Comstock or 100 or 200 could be
[7435.04s] a possibility dur due to euphoric
[7436.76s] markets Don who cares at this point uh I
[7440.32s] don&#39;t want to speculate all I can tell
[7441.96s] you is it&#39;s its liquidation value is
[7444.719s] still you know close to double where it
[7447.079s] is now uh and then I&#39;ll take a look at
[7449.4s] what the fundamentals look like and all
[7451.0s] the super cycle headline nonsense but
[7453.599s] look if I come out of it on an eight or
[7455.44s] $ n basis at $50 and I I sell a bunch of
[7459.04s] it and keep a little bit of it and it
[7460.84s] goes to 300 I&#39;m not going to lose sleep
[7462.84s] I already made a six bagger in a couple
[7464.559s] of years uh if I if I left a 12 or 24
[7468.159s] bagger on the table I&#39;ll keep a tail on
[7470.0s] it I&#39;ll keep another 25% and let it run
[7472.199s] for a while but uh that&#39;s all
[7475.119s] speculation who cares about that but
[7477.119s] thank you for the nice question and
[7478.8s] highlighting one of the winners because
[7480.76s] uh for those of you who know we don&#39;t
[7482.199s] spend much time on our winners on this
[7484.92s] conference call we spend to tend to
[7486.559s] spend all the time on the ones that
[7488.119s] haven&#39;t left the station yet which we
[7489.92s] enjoy doing John Doe
[7492.32s] uh insurers like Fairfax and
[7495.8s] Marquel uh look I have no idea what
[7499.119s] their exposure is to the California
[7501.36s] stuff I know they&#39;re going to use it as
[7502.96s] an opportunity to um increase prices uh
[7508.679s] but no I&#39;m not buying marel here I mean
[7511.36s] it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s you know it&#39;s
[7514.239s] up almost triple since since covid uh
[7518.32s] that&#39;s not when you buy insurers you buy
[7519.76s] insurers when no one wants some like
[7522.199s] Lincoln National a couple years that&#39;s
[7524.679s] when you buy insurers this is a
[7526.36s] lowquality business you bought it in the
[7528.92s] hole at 15 bucks you got a four bagger
[7531.52s] just on recovery you know cyclical type
[7534.36s] stuff it&#39;s probably still cheap here
[7535.8s] because it&#39;s a lowquality business but
[7537.96s] Markel is a high quality business and
[7539.48s] it&#39;s trading at all-time high so not
[7541.639s] interested Fairfax I mean these are all
[7544.119s] I want to be Warren Buffett well
[7545.599s] everyone wants to be Warren Buffett
[7546.84s] which is why they&#39;re fully priced so
[7548.4s] you&#39;re not really adding any value by
[7550.92s] buying something that&#39;s trading at fully
[7552.679s] valued so um yeah they&#39;re great
[7555.8s] businesses you won&#39;t lose money
[7557.32s] investing them over time but there&#39;s an
[7558.88s] opportunity cost and you know there&#39;s
[7561.599s] there&#39;s this whole kind of Cadre of
[7564.239s] people only buy the highest quality blah
[7566.239s] blah blah and then they buy them when
[7568.36s] they&#39;re everything is perfect and
[7569.96s] they&#39;re at all-time highs and a perfect
[7571.76s] return on Capital and what happens they
[7573.32s] hit a cycle the thing goes down 50% they
[7575.719s] were right about it being high quality
[7577.159s] they bought it at the wrong time which
[7578.88s] is why I like I like taking B andc
[7581.119s] players when they&#39;re absolutely
[7582.639s] decimated but I can be clear they&#39;re not
[7584.28s] going out of business because then I&#39;m
[7585.52s] going to get a triple and I don&#39;t have
[7587.04s] to have the best quality one breaking
[7589.639s] out and all this I can just buy
[7591.599s] a business that I know is not going out
[7593.239s] of business and make a double or triple
[7595.199s] over a few years rinse and repeat over
[7597.4s] and over so I&#39;ll leave that one there
[7599.48s] thank you for the question thanks for
[7600.92s] being a listener Philipe Andrew
[7603.639s] pinkos uh is asking about China
[7606.04s] listening to their last call they&#39;re
[7607.719s] very happy about China I&#39;m very happy
[7609.84s] about China uh GL Smith client is from
[7612.719s] Chris C uh I think many of these uh you
[7616.559s] know kind of value Pharma are going to
[7619.119s] start to do well but this is not a good
[7621.36s] use of capital you&#39;re lucky if you get a
[7623.079s] double over three or four years and you
[7625.76s] know it&#39;s kind of a
[7627.32s] lowquality uh business you got to
[7629.719s] understand the pipeline and if I don&#39;t
[7631.199s] have at least a guaranteed double in a
[7633.079s] short period of time I&#39;m not going to
[7634.52s] spend the time on it so with this one I
[7638.159s] mean it&#39;s it&#39;s trading flat because the
[7640.28s] business has been flat so so if you can
[7642.119s] tell me that there&#39;s some amazing drug
[7644.4s] in the pipeline I might listen but
[7646.4s] that&#39;s not the business I do
[7649.52s] uh you think this recently Indie
[7653.32s] semiconductor which foken company like
[7656.84s] Indie I&#39;m not interested in those tiny
[7659.199s] little players because they&#39;re going to
[7660.4s] get smoked out Sebastian thoughts on
[7664.239s] vistian
[7669.239s] uh probably not for let me take a look
[7672.44s] at
[7673.679s] it I would
[7676.88s] say would I buy
[7680.159s] wait vistra energy would I buy no hell
[7683.52s] no why why are you bringing me a stock
[7685.4s] that&#39;s up 8X in a year I like no no
[7690.159s] thank you uh I hope it doubles again for
[7692.719s] you but I&#39;m not going to participate in
[7694.96s] it uh qxo we&#39;ve already talked about it
[7698.32s] if he executes right it&#39;s an 8 to 10 bag
[7700.28s] or over a decade
[7702.159s] uh just eat takeaway I&#39;m not interested
[7704.159s] I don&#39;t like delivery businesses I think
[7705.639s] they&#39;re commoditized Brian o Kelly uh
[7709.04s] Keeny listener for last year thank you
[7711.639s] for the value uh share my customer with
[7714.44s] my name my restaurant customers thank
[7715.96s] you that&#39;s very kind of you uh value ETF
[7719.0s] inside a 529 plan I I&#39;ve got no
[7721.48s] complaints on that I don&#39;t really like
[7723.199s] value ETFs because you get a lot of
[7724.92s] value traps I like to just buy companies
[7727.239s] but I don&#39;t think you get hurt there
[7728.559s] having some exposure that way Jacob sax
[7731.159s] off uh thank you for all you do blah
[7733.44s] blah blah AMD no I&#39;m I&#39;m not interested
[7736.48s] in those uh Allan asked me to take a
[7739.48s] look at Parago Parago is okay I think
[7741.88s] they&#39;re going to do fine they&#39;ve got a
[7743.719s] lot of over-the-counter stuff
[7746.52s] um they are Cash Generator I just don&#39;t
[7749.32s] know what the catalyst is for change
[7751.52s] here and
[7754.32s] uh I don&#39;t want to be stuck in a value
[7756.639s] trap but I do think this is going to
[7758.119s] work at some point you do have a margin
[7759.8s] of safety and and uh I think you know a
[7762.96s] lot of these uh single payers are going
[7765.88s] to have to move to more
[7768.559s] generics it&#39;s okay ah it&#39;s not for me
[7771.88s] I&#39;ve looked at it a million times Allan
[7773.44s] and I&#39;ve done nothing so that probably
[7774.8s] tells you everything you need to know
[7776.28s] Christopher hassa field ATS automation
[7780.28s] products
[7782.96s] EV Sy
[7786.92s] Rockwell all right ATS let&#39;s take a look
[7790.4s] it&#39;s one I don&#39;t know
[7803.719s] all right so
[7810.92s] ATS so you know they&#39;re they&#39;re
[7813.32s] basically Break Even cash flow they&#39;re
[7814.76s] growing the revenues margins are
[7818.0s] declining uh doesn&#39;t look like they&#39;re
[7821.0s] gener generating enough cash flow for me
[7823.159s] to get interested let&#39;s take a look
[7833.88s] here let&#39;s see the balance sheet looks
[7838.48s] like 125
[7843.559s] million 800 million Deb pretty leverage
[7846.599s] balance
[7847.599s] sheet uh where the where&#39;s the cash
[7851.559s] there it
[7858.92s] is n not for me not for me moving
[7873.92s] along uh okay A minor not interested in
[7878.88s] miners s
[7885.32s] BSW uh okay this looks like a cyclical
[7888.92s] thing
[7895.679s] sbsw negative free cash flow declining
[7898.239s] Revenue cyclical business um I already
[7901.679s] have one in uh albamar which I like
[7906.199s] Precious Metals mining I hate precious
[7907.84s] metals mining I I really I mean
[7915.36s] mine like the this thing is this is a
[7918.239s] trading vehicle I would not want to own
[7919.8s] this business it&#39;s a bad quality
[7921.239s] business but I it&#39;s probably going to
[7923.079s] work as a trade I&#39;ll leave it at that
[7925.0s] John dabc National oil W Varco yeah
[7930.119s] again it&#39;s a serer someone asks every
[7932.239s] few weeks I think it&#39;s probably okay I
[7935.559s] just I just don&#39;t love it enough I mean
[7938.4s] it&#39;s uh it&#39;s been dead money for years
[7941.28s] it didn&#39;t really recover with everything
[7943.4s] else and maybe now&#39;s the time cash flows
[7947.679s] inflecting revenues
[7949.32s] inflecting margin&#39;s going up so look
[7952.36s] there&#39;s some positive stuff I think if
[7953.88s] you buy this you&#39;re fine maybe you make
[7956.239s] a double but I
[7959.8s] just let me take a closer look here
[7963.76s] because I I I&#39;ve looked at this thing
[7966.32s] over and over and done nothing and been
[7968.119s] right but maybe now I&#39;m going to start
[7970.239s] being wrong
[7971.679s] but errors of omission I&#39;m good with and
[7974.04s] just not errors of O commission you know
[7976.719s] it&#39;s never it&#39;s never been a business
[7979.76s] that earned above its cost of capital so
[7982.52s] it&#39;s a crappy business but when they
[7985.199s] catch a cycle they go and they didn&#39;t
[7987.96s] catch the last cycle they&#39;re still
[7990.32s] burning
[7991.92s] cash uh it got 800 million bucks and how
[7996.28s] much debt 1.7
[7999.52s] billion let&#39;s see if that at least
[8001.76s] respect Equity a little
[8007.119s] bit uh yeah so so they&#39;re growing the
[8010.32s] share count a little bit
[8013.92s] Ah I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to get
[8015.92s] hurt I think maybe you get a double it&#39;s
[8018.8s] okay Kevin
[8023.96s] McAllister
[8025.76s] uh Alx for China small cap exposure I
[8028.8s] don&#39;t want China small cap exposure it&#39;s
[8030.4s] got to be the highest I&#39;m not taking
[8031.76s] company and Country I understand the
[8033.719s] thought on it not not really interested
[8037.079s] Foot Locker Foot Locker is a play on
[8039.28s] Nike ladies and gentlemen why don&#39;t you
[8040.84s] just buy Nike I would just buy Nike
[8042.48s] don&#39;t buy Foot Locker I&#39;m not even going
[8043.679s] to look at it Mastercraft boat you know
[8046.199s] this is like Fu
[8048.079s] foxf uh interest rates coming down all
[8051.36s] the overstocks uh work
[8054.36s] through so maybe these Recreation things
[8057.76s] start to ro roll again
[8062.52s] C I mean with all the boat parades uh
[8067.52s] they&#39;re going to be having with the
[8069.28s] Trump Flags maybe they&#39;ll sell a lot of
[8070.92s] boats now let&#39;s see master
[8074.84s] craft why is this not coming
[8077.199s] up are you sure it&#39;s not Malibu Boats
[8092.0s] I think it&#39;s Malibu Boats and they sell
[8096.04s] Mastercraft
[8098.52s] uh I don&#39;t think this is ready yet I I
[8101.4s] I&#39;ve looked at this a bunch I don&#39;t like
[8102.96s] these recreational things you know the
[8105.36s] the RV
[8107.719s] businesses uh let&#39;s see Malibu Boats do
[8111.159s] they sell
[8117.199s] mastercrafts well it&#39;s the same thing I
[8119.4s] mean it&#39;s the same business
[8125.04s] ah let me see if these things are
[8127.119s] starting to inflect at
[8144.719s] all I mean revenues are still decimated
[8147.559s] as a matter of fact I have a friend who
[8149.639s] sells uh
[8153.84s] Boston Whalers and like Criss crafts and
[8157.44s] all that type of stuff and they&#39;ve
[8158.96s] gotten smoked the last couple of years I
[8160.679s] mean it&#39;s starting to stabilize a little
[8162.52s] bit I think you might be early I mean
[8164.92s] these revenues are getting smoked I
[8167.239s] would take a look at this inventory
[8169.28s] recovery is probably showing that
[8170.76s] they&#39;re working down inventories and and
[8172.76s] maybe a restock cycle
[8177.559s] uh uh this one
[8181.28s] let me just take a look
[8189.04s] here see if it&#39;s ever been a good
[8192.92s] business yeah I all right I get it
[8197.84s] um see if they&#39;re going to live another
[8200.04s] day 30 $26 million of cash is that right
[8203.719s] how much debt do they
[8206.319s] have not
[8209.24s] much and freak cash
[8216.08s] flow negative you really got to
[8218.8s] understand is the turnaround real I mean
[8221.599s] is this legit uh they&#39;re back
[8225.28s] to kind of preco is sales
[8230.0s] levels and back then it was kind of
[8232.679s] trading where it is
[8235.2s] now I think you got to do a lot more
[8238.399s] work but I definitely see what you
[8240.88s] potentially see Drew Robinson wary
[8243.319s] Parker no interest uh Jimmy
[8247.479s] Jones uh Baxter High PE
[8251.28s] ratio all the stocks we buy probably
[8253.479s] have high PE ratios because at the time
[8255.24s] we buy them they&#39;re in trough earning
[8256.88s] cycle so that we never even talk about
[8260.439s] pees on this this uh uh podcast we talk
[8265.92s] about cash flow we talk about revenues
[8269.08s] we talk about margins because when we&#39;re
[8271.28s] buying it they&#39;re down 60 80% and
[8274.28s] they&#39;re going to be at negative or or
[8275.88s] break even earnings so you&#39;re going to
[8277.24s] have a 100 times multiple if you&#39;re
[8278.479s] earning a penny and the stock is trading
[8280.599s] at $1 and uh and if they have uh no
[8285.319s] earnings in the short term which is very
[8287.359s] often in turnaround Tom&#39;s uh picks when
[8290.28s] they&#39;re down 80% uh but we&#39;ve seen them
[8293.12s] operate through Decades of cycles and we
[8294.84s] know that&#39;s what happens every cycle um
[8297.639s] you know they their multiples infinite
[8299.519s] so PE is not the right question the
[8301.399s] right question is uh what does their
[8304.8s] cash flow and earnings power look like
[8306.439s] proforma when the kidney business is out
[8309.399s] and they pay down debt their interest uh
[8311.76s] expense goes down and the multiple rates
[8314.28s] because the slowest growing part of
[8315.76s] their business the kid kidney business
[8317.359s] which pulled the multiple down from 18
[8319.719s] down to 12 is now out of there and all
[8322.08s] they&#39;re left with is a fast growing
[8323.559s] business that warrants a higher multiple
[8325.92s] uh and it rates from you know 12 times
[8327.719s] to 18 times and gets gets momentum and
[8331.12s] Off to the Races so p is the wrong
[8332.92s] question uh mod is the right question no
[8335.639s] one no one even compares in the IV
[8337.719s] business and and the areas that they uh
[8340.599s] compete their pump business had a little
[8342.679s] bit of a softness they now got the new
[8345.04s] pump out that&#39;s going to absolutely kick
[8346.76s] ass and uh they&#39;re going to be Off to
[8348.96s] the Races so love that one uh Scott
[8356.439s] Wilson resonated most with your
[8358.319s] recommendations not advice by the way go
[8361.12s] to hedge fund tips.com click on terms
[8363.399s] all of this is opinion not advice talk
[8365.0s] to your financial adviser don&#39;t do
[8367.04s] anything yada yada yada read terms uh
[8370.96s] what is he talking
[8375.399s] here
[8384.28s] okay now Scott you&#39;re right on on point
[8387.439s] thanks for inviting me up to ohigh uh
[8389.6s] whenever I get up there I will
[8391.0s] definitely look you up and uh very
[8393.2s] grateful for your support over the year
[8395.479s] and recommending to your friend and
[8396.76s] colleagues you&#39;re on the right track
[8398.359s] those are good tools to have you could
[8400.12s] probably get value line at your uh local
[8402.92s] library uh if you want to do that and um
[8406.439s] very grateful for the kind words
[8408.8s] Jeremy
[8413.68s] uh all right do gp1s hurt Hershey yes
[8416.8s] they hurt Hershey they hurt diio but
[8420.0s] it&#39;s reflect in the price certainly in
[8421.96s] the case of diio Hershey there could be
[8424.399s] a little bit more hurt before it
[8425.92s] actually Rock and rolls but um Hershey&#39;s
[8429.319s] is just one of the greatest businesses
[8431.56s] and uh you know look not everyone&#39;s
[8433.72s] going to stay on these things that&#39;s
[8435.439s] just the nature of the Beast so I I look
[8438.72s] every week I look at Hershey and I&#39;m
[8440.64s] interested and I do nothing so this will
[8443.12s] probably be one that I miss I mean at
[8445.359s] 100 it&#39;s at 150 bucks if it got to 100
[8447.8s] bucks I wouldn&#39;t even have to think
[8449.0s] about it cuz like so much is priced in
[8452.72s] uh and uh I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re on 80
[8455.6s] gp1s you&#39;re still going to eat Reese&#39;s
[8457.76s] Pieces I mean who doesn&#39;t eat Reese the
[8459.72s] stuff is like crack I mean it&#39;s the best
[8462.399s] tasting thing in the world so and no one
[8464.6s] can replicate if you actually understand
[8466.359s] the Hershey business and how they have
[8468.359s] these special stones that take like 10
[8470.96s] years to replicate and no one can
[8472.479s] replicate that particular flavor which
[8474.24s] is also the moat of the Coca-Cola
[8476.88s] Company um I think you&#39;ll find that um
[8481.96s] Hershey&#39;s going to be just fine so I
[8484.96s] would say I&#39;m interested in Hershey I&#39;m
[8488.399s] aware of the glp1 issue and there&#39;s not
[8491.0s] a big enough Motor Safety for me to back
[8492.76s] up the truck yet and I fully expect that
[8495.479s] it&#39;ll run away from me before it gets to
[8497.28s] a point where I would back up the truck
[8498.72s] and I&#39;m perfectly okay with errors of
[8500.319s] omission not errors of commission
[8502.24s] thoughts on Snap uh I hate this business
[8505.479s] I think uh
[8510.84s] no not for me if it turns around it
[8513.399s] turns around but it&#39;s the same manager
[8515.08s] and it&#39;s just been a dog forever uh the
[8518.92s] idea is that if Tik Tok gets out
[8520.92s] everyone&#39;s going to have to use snap I
[8534.08s] mean you got to go through the whole
[8536.16s] thing th this guy&#39;s no Zuckerberg this
[8538.479s] guy is uh uh different level he&#39;s in the
