He sees a buying opportunity in the current weakness, particularly in names he already likes such as Alibaba, Cooper Standard, VF Corp and PayPal. He believes the market is misinterpreting the potential impact of Trump's tariffs on China and that a stimulus package is coming regardless of the election outcome. He is also positioning for a rally in bonds and a weaker dollar.",
