# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode Unknown
### Unknown

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on small caps, China, and bonds. He sees a buying opportunity in the current weakness, particularly in names he already likes such as Alibaba, Cooper Standard, VF Corp and PayPal. He believes the market is misinterpreting the potential impact of Trump's tariffs on China and that a stimulus package is coming regardless of the election outcome. He is also positioning for a rally in bonds and a weaker dollar.
