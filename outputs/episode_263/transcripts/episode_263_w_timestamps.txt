[0.68s] welcome to hedge fun tips with Tom Hayes
[3.399s] I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your 263rd
[6.279s] videoast podcast for the week ending
[8.76s] October 31st 2024 happy Halloween Mimi
[13.599s] and Annabelle are going as a Chick-fil-A
[17.119s] cow and a Chick-fil-A worker and if you
[20.68s] zoom in here I think we can
[23.0s] see that Annabelle has a name tag that
[27.24s] says Annabelle on it which is pretty
[29.08s] wild so so that&#39;s fun uh then yes last
[32.759s] night got to go to cistina which is a
[36.64s] great restaurant in New York if you&#39;re
[38.64s] ever through New York uh you definitely
[41.879s] want to check that out with my friends
[43.719s] from Dallas Chris and Brian you know who
[46.32s] you are uh and this is the chef and
[50.079s] owner uh this is jeppe Bruno and he owns
[53.96s] that and
[55.92s] Caravaggio uh he&#39;s always there I had a
[58.76s] chance to meet him for the first time
[60.079s] time when I went with uh Ellie terret
[63.64s] and Charlie gasparino sometime back and
[66.799s] so it was nice to be back you couldn&#39;t
[69.119s] believe uh the number of specials they
[72.159s] had number one I don&#39;t know how the
[73.64s] waiter remembered all of them and number
[75.479s] two uh we thought we were on Candid
[77.759s] Camera like it was a joke there were
[79.36s] literally like 30 dinner specials
[82.479s] between the appetizers and the main
[84.32s] course uh so like uh like like everyone
[87.36s] else we just ordered a cheeseburger Ju
[89.28s] Just kidding not exactly but uh leaving
[92.0s] that aside uh moving along uh we want to
[95.96s] get down to the charts of the week we&#39;ve
[100.079s] got a tremendous amount of stuff to
[101.56s] cover here um first off the misery index
[105.68s] which is the year-over-year CPI plus the
[109.119s] unemployment rate is approaching low
[111.68s] levels that we haven&#39;t seen since the
[113.32s] bull market in 2014 through
[117.119s] 2019 and the late 90s um this is
[120.88s] interesting the chips act could cover
[123.28s] nearly half of all Factory costs so you
[128.08s] can see here the breakdown of Intel
[130.16s] getting the most money this was a
[131.84s] bipartisan bill that will be followed
[134.4s] through we&#39;re going to talk about Intel
[135.68s] there after uh ours earnings were pretty
[139.0s] phenomenal uh or at least a step in the
[140.92s] right direction so they got eight
[142.16s] billion of Grants uh another two M
[145.2s] billion from military grants and
[147.12s] contracts another looks like about 10 10
[150.56s] billion of loans and then uh tax credits
[154.12s] of about
[155.72s] 25 billion so they&#39;re uh and they
[158.84s] haven&#39;t they haven&#39;t got one red Penny
[161.36s] of this yet so they&#39;re going to start
[163.68s] seeing this come in which is going to
[165.28s] help them they&#39;ve started to turn the
[166.76s] ship on their own and then when you get
[168.64s] this uh rocket fuel in the jet they&#39;re
[171.159s] going to rock and roll now uh 1976 to to
[175.8s] 2023 S&amp;P 500 seasonality you normally
[179.239s] get this kind kind of weakness right
[180.8s] before the election like we&#39;re seeing uh
[183.84s] October broke the six Monon winning
[187.319s] streak for the S&amp;P 500 the month close
[190.04s] negative you should expect that at the
[192.159s] end of October this is the dark blue
[194.599s] line for presidential election year and
[196.36s] then right after the election uh you
[198.319s] tend to get an awful lot of strength in
[200.959s] November and December uh even in
[203.319s] non-presidential years but certainly in
[205.08s] presidential years so uh that&#39;s an
[207.28s] opportunity and so on uh this is from
[210.48s] Mike zardi Regional Banks surged 15% and
[214.0s] 177% in the previous two election months
[218.12s] meaning November of 2020 and November of
[224.959s] 2020
[226.64s] 2016 those are huge moves that&#39;s also
[229.12s] consistent with what we&#39;ve been saying
[230.439s] that small caps do well in November and
[234.28s] December uh so so uh Banks K will be a
[238.64s] big beneficiary of that as
[240.64s] well some data here the GDP growth rate
[243.959s] still at 2.8 so all those calling for
[247.519s] the
[249.0s] recession uh didn&#39;t actually get it
[252.48s] because we we have the growth still
[254.56s] coming in pretty aggressively uh
[256.84s] inflation continues to come down core
[259.4s] pce came in at 2.2 today real consumer
[262.84s] spending was up
[264.32s] 3.7% so the consumer is strong and
[266.96s] confident uh intentions to purchase
[270.44s] automobiles in
[272.44s] October uh was the highest level going
[275.88s] all the way back to pre pandemic for the
[279.32s] first time ever that is pretty exciting
[283.479s] and we&#39;ll see the jobs report tomorrow
[285.32s] to determine whether we the 96% chance
[288.12s] of a 25 basis point cut
[291.759s] in November is accurate uh but one thing
[296.639s] that one of the listeners forwarded over
[298.8s] the week was from the Ford earnings call
[302.84s] that they were talking about an an
[305.68s] estimate
[307.24s] for AAR that is much higher than Cooper
[312.32s] standard is calling
[315.32s] for by the way it&#39;s my great mug hedge
[320.199s] fund tips remember opinion not advice go
[323.039s] to hedge fund tips.com and click on
[327.12s] terms um
[330.08s] so in their earnings call Ford said our
[333.56s] outlook for
[335.199s] 2024 assumes a flat to slightly higher
[337.68s] SAR in both us and Europe our planning
[340.28s] assumptions for the US is 16 million to
[344.919s] 16.5 million units that means production
[347.8s] is going to ramp up and the biggest
[350.84s] beneficiary will be Cooper standard so
[354.36s] that&#39;s pretty exciting to
[356.0s] see and that&#39;s from Ford next uh this
[359.4s] should shows that uh we had five
[361.24s] straight up months and closed a negative
[363.639s] month in October which is pretty
[366.16s] standard um you can see here the NASDAQ
[370.039s] season seasonality as we discussed same
[373.16s] story weekend late late October small
[375.96s] cap same thing uh and then very very
[379.0s] strong small caps tend to be extremely
[381.28s] strong
[382.199s] from uh November for November and
[385.12s] December this is from Seth golden
[387.039s] talking about those
[391.12s] the election return from October 27th to
[396.96s] December 31st
[399.479s] for SNP during election years is plus
[404.919s] 6.25% when you go down
[407.36s] to NASDAQ it&#39;s
[410.68s] 7.17% for that basically two months and
[413.599s] 3 days and if you go down to small caps
[416.16s] you get the highest returns in the
[417.56s] shortest amount of time of 7
[420.039s] 10.99% which is consistent with the
[422.479s] regional Banks which is a big part of
[425.36s] small
[427.759s] caps moving
[432.08s] along mentions of bottom surged which
[435.68s] historically indicated a bottoming EPS
[438.56s] cycle if you remember we&#39;ve been talking
[440.36s] about the Q3 pause in earnings before
[443.8s] the
[444.919s] reacceleration and the last time you see
[447.12s] saw pauses like this was at the bottom
[449.199s] during covid and the bottom during 2009
[453.039s] mentions of bottom have skyrocketed so
[455.68s] that means earnings are going to
[457.08s] aggressively re accelerate and
[459.68s] particularly in the
[462.36s] unmagnify relative to the Magnificent 7
[465.08s] which we saw in the last few days they
[467.479s] continue to overspend and their margins
[469.759s] are coming down a bit uh while the rest
[474.28s] of the S&amp;P 500 is going up and we&#39;re
[476.24s] going to see that in a pronounced way in
[477.96s] Q4 and the market is going to start to
[480.039s] Discount that right be right after the
[482.28s] election certainty
[484.36s] clears job openings by established side
[487.479s] establishment size so you can see weight
[489.44s] labor pressure is coming down job
[491.599s] openings are less so uh employers will
[495.0s] be able to have more uh influence over
[498.52s] what they pay for labor D Dallas fed
[501.36s] Manufacturing Index turning up this is
[503.599s] consistent with our recovery from the
[506.28s] manufacturing depression moving forward
[509.159s] and then
[510.159s] uh October
[511.719s] 2024 new vehicle sales
[514.76s] forecast you can see
[517.8s] here uh
[520.2s] 7.9% year on-year and then a huge
[523.2s] rebound from September up 10% so that&#39;s
[528.279s] going to be a big deal that should P
[529.68s] pull for forward some production for
[531.519s] Cooper standard and um that should be a
[534.92s] positive uh thing to see global
[537.16s] manufacturing PMI is turning off up so
[539.88s] that Global manufacturing recession
[541.72s] should start to re accelerate uh uh
[544.88s] excuse me the recovery should start to
[546.399s] re accelerate medium floor area
[548.8s] decreased as far as square feet per
[552.48s] houses and this is what I had talked
[554.399s] about in terms of all the
[558.76s] Millennials not needing to have a
[561.079s] starter home at 3500 or 4,500 Square ft
[565.68s] um and home builders are starting to C
[569.6s] and starting to provide a lot more of
[571.839s] these
[572.88s] 2100t houses uh like you saw more than
[576.48s] 15 years ago and then in the early 2000s
[580.279s] and then uh we talked consistently about
[583.64s] levit town after World War Two uh and
[586.72s] that&#39;s a normal thing when you have a
[588.279s] huge portion of the population starting
[590.44s] families to get reasonable size houses
[592.24s] so they can afford them start the family
[595.279s] and trade up over time UK births have
[597.959s] falling to the same level as deaths we
[600.72s] haven&#39;t seen that since
[602.12s] 1976 but yet they&#39;re having their
[604.839s] biggest annual growth in population in
[606.92s] 74 years so a lot of migration going
[609.079s] into the UK that should be constructive
[612.2s] for um GDP
[614.6s] Etc biggest outflow from China Equity
[617.68s] Funds since June of
[620.56s] 2015 um this is pretty wild
[625.399s] because
[627.24s] uh okay I didn&#39;t pull that chart start
[629.48s] up so I&#39;m going to have to do it
[632.399s] here and
[636.48s] here so let&#39;s just use K web as a proxy
[639.639s] for China
[644.44s] Tech so this was the last time you had
[647.24s] an outflow as big as you&#39;ve seen now and
[650.72s] then what did you have you had the K web
[653.399s] triple uh you probably had Baba triple
[656.44s] over the same period
[661.68s] yeah 2015 and then it tripled from
[665.48s] 55 uh not tripled quadrupled to 207 in
[669.2s] the next year and a half so uh Back to
[671.68s] the Future ladies and gentlemen uh
[673.76s] pretty exciting to see and then speaking
[676.72s] of which uh they are having an enormous
[680.56s] government meeting to basically
[682.279s] determine the size of the stimulus
[684.24s] that&#39;s going to come and they&#39;ve had
[687.72s] monstrous estimates if Trump gets
[690.44s] elected to offset the perceived threats
[693.16s] about tariffs speaking about the
[695.839s] perceived threats about tariffs I posted
[699.959s] this chart over the
[701.72s] weekend that got a lot of hits and was
[704.88s] misinterpreted by a lot of people but
[706.959s] that&#39;s on them um but you know there&#39;s
[710.279s] been a lot of fear
[712.88s] about Trump getting in and putting
[715.48s] tariffs on China and what that will mean
[717.88s] for Chinese stocks
[721.519s] and what I could say is in 2016 there
[725.079s] was a tremendous amount of fear about
[727.04s] President Trump getting elected uh and
[729.92s] putting tariffs on China and when he got
[733.44s] elected he did exactly what he said he
[735.44s] was going to do which is he put tariffs
[738.92s] on China and what happened to Alibaba
[741.24s] over the next uh four first off the the
[745.16s] first year and a half while he was in
[747.76s] Alibaba uh
[749.68s] doubled plus up 150% from 84 to over 200
[754.839s] and change and by the time he was out it
[757.36s] was up almost 4X uh from 84 from when he
[761.16s] got in to it hit
[762.959s] 312 uh during that same period and then
[765.88s] when the new Administration came in it
[767.8s] collapsed from uh 280 down to 66 and you
[772.32s] know a lot of people said well
[773.48s] correlation is not causation and uh to
[776.32s] that I say no s Sherlock but the point
[780.72s] was that the same Euphoria around
[783.8s] tariffs proved to be unfounded as it
[785.92s] related to the abilities of these
[787.959s] companies to
[789.639s] earn uh in their countries number one
[792.56s] certainly AB Baba a kweb
[795.24s] etc um and number two the studies that
[798.68s] I&#39;ve read about tariffs is even if he
[800.24s] went full boore and did 60% tariff and
[802.839s] it wasn&#39;t just a tactic to negotiate
[804.519s] with she he actually implemented it it
[807.12s] would have a negative impact on Chinese
[810.079s] GDP by
[811.44s] 1% I I would have thought it would be
[813.48s] like 10% uh we overestimate our
[816.16s] influence on their uh on their economy
[820.44s] and on that basis what they are planning
[824.279s] which will come out I think it&#39;s the
[826.0s] 5ifth to the eth they&#39;re having the the
[828.32s] big meeting uh I guess to see who&#39;s
[830.56s] going to be elected so if Trump is
[833.519s] elected the stimulus is probably going
[835.079s] to be five times bigger than if kamla is
[837.399s] elected and meanwhile the policies of
[839.68s] kamla would be more deleterious to the
[841.92s] Chinese because it&#39;s an ideological type
[844.92s] of um kind of creating a cold war versus
[849.04s] a pragmatic philosophy of uh ey for an
[852.24s] eye if you&#39;re going to tariff us we&#39;re
[853.639s] going to tariff you uh but we&#39;re still
[855.56s] going to do business and uh and move
[857.759s] ahead because we want to make money and
[859.079s] we want to create jobs so so this chart
[862.44s] I think is very important same frenzy as
[865.519s] a matter of fact it&#39;s funny because Baba
[868.199s] was in the same type of bottoming
[870.079s] process breaking out and then taking a
[873.24s] little breather before taking its big
[875.279s] run and this is a very similar situation
[877.72s] so
[879.8s] um I love seeing that I also see it on
[882.959s] gold biggest inflow to Gold funds since
[886.199s] July of 2020 well the last time you saw
[889.92s] that inflow into gold at this level in
[893.959s] such a short period of time was early
[896.88s] 2020 and what was that it was called a
[899.72s] top and it basically uh collapsed about
[902.959s] 30% overnight and then or 25% and then
[907.639s] continued downward I&#39;m sorry 20% Then
[910.32s] continued down 25% and basically never
[913.16s] hit that new high for uh three more
[916.6s] years after uh correcting 25% it&#39;s not
[920.399s] to say this is the exact top I would
[922.759s] just say this is not the time to be
[924.279s] chasing it um you can see the last time
[927.56s] you had this many consecutive Trad tring
[929.16s] sessions above the 200 day moving
[931.0s] average again we were closer to the top
[933.319s] than the bottom and then if you look at
[935.24s] commercials while all the uh hedge fund
[938.16s] guys and Retail guys and small Traders
[940.04s] are buying it like it&#39;s going out of
[941.519s] style the commercials and the smart
[943.44s] money are selling it so uh that doesn&#39;t
[946.199s] mean it turns on a dime it just means
[948.12s] that you&#39;re better off to be laying off
[950.44s] than adding uh us consumer sentiment
[953.519s] Rises to six-month high on rate relief
[959.8s] we haven&#39;t seen it show up for the
[961.079s] consumer yet but it will over time and
[964.04s] that goes back to uh which will cover
[966.8s] the seasonality of bonds everyone is
[969.0s] mistaken that they cut rates and bond
[972.319s] yields are going up and they&#39;re going to
[974.079s] keep going up and then people are trying
[975.8s] to justify it so they come up with this
[977.639s] narrative it&#39;s because of the high debt
[979.68s] or it&#39;s because of the Chinese selling
[981.16s] bonds or anything else and sometimes it
[983.48s] just has to do with the supply in the
[984.959s] market that happens every single October
[986.8s] and we&#39;ll look at the seasonality in a
[988.24s] minute because
[989.44s] October is the worst month of the year
[991.959s] for long bonds I.E prices go down yields
[996.319s] go up every single year and then
[999.6s] November is the best month of the year
[1001.639s] for bonds so sell the rumor buy the news
[1004.72s] you want to be a buyer of bonds into
[1007.0s] this weakness yields are going to come
[1009.519s] down over the next two months not up no
[1012.16s] matter what all the Cassandras tell you
[1014.959s] uh that&#39;s what&#39;s going to take place or
[1016.6s] that&#39;s where the odds are relative to
[1018.36s] what&#39;s going to take
[1019.68s] place University of Michigan inflation
[1022.36s] expectations collapsing uh US economic
[1026.079s] surprise index uh
[1029.079s] skyrocketing uh US dollar this is a
[1032.559s] counter Trend move again I repeat a
[1035.839s] counter Trend move it has been grinding
[1038.16s] sideways here uh after falling and this
[1041.439s] will start to recover its weakness and
[1044.6s] the Euro will start to Rally along with
[1046.839s] all the other currencies over
[1049.36s] time J Japan and maybe sooner than we
[1052.12s] expect maybe starting next month when we
[1053.679s] see bonds rally Japan 30-year government
[1057.32s] bond yield continues to go up which
[1060.0s] means the bank of Japan is going to have
[1062.08s] to
[1063.08s] continue uh to hike and um that will be
[1068.88s] very constructive for China very
[1070.84s] destructive for Japanese equities uh
[1073.52s] biggest outflow from Emerging Market
[1075.36s] Equity Funds since April of 20 of 2000
[1081.88s] rather and if you go back to April of
[1086.2s] 2000 and you bought Emerging Markets you
[1089.159s] made one of the quickest doubles in the
[1090.799s] shortest amount of time in history uh in
[1093.679s] basically less than a year nine months
[1095.76s] you doubled your money sentiment
[1097.84s] indicator and by the way the biggest
[1099.28s] weight is still China sentiment
[1101.36s] indicator is stretched but not insane
[1103.96s] according to Goldman Sachs moving along
[1107.679s] correlation of the s&amp; p500 versus the
[1110.08s] S&amp;P equal weighted index is at record
[1112.6s] lows not seen since when since 2001 and
[1116.679s] 2002 the the analog that we continue to
[1119.64s] point to for all of the ways that we&#39;re
[1122.12s] positioned to take advantage over the
[1123.559s] next few years and are starting to see
[1125.799s] slowing earnings growth for the
[1127.12s] Magnificent 7 so you could see here 50%
[1131.12s] earnings growth has dropped down to Mid
[1132.96s] teens whereas the
[1135.48s] unmagnify had basically negative
[1137.559s] earnings growth and has now flipped to
[1141.08s] positive and is reaccelerating to Mid
[1144.0s] team so you want to go where the growth
[1145.72s] is going to be happening versus the
[1148.159s] deceleration and we saw that this week
[1150.36s] in the mag 7 getting smacked today
[1153.12s] 10-year treasury yields uh this is a
[1155.96s] counter Trend move even Goldman Sachs
[1158.28s] agrees with me pointing to a
[1162.48s] 3.85% Target moving forward down from
[1165.72s] the 4.2 and change where we are at now I
[1168.919s] agree hedge fund asset managers turn
[1171.96s] dollar Bulls on Election risk again this
[1174.84s] is a counter Trend move it will get
[1176.679s] resolved in coming months uh and uh the
[1180.76s] age of population across different
[1182.76s] countries which is very interesting
[1185.559s] we&#39;ve been bullish on China we think
[1187.48s] China&#39;s got a a great run for the next
[1189.76s] few years and the US why because the
[1192.159s] bulk of their population is age 34 and
[1194.559s] you can see it played out in the numbers
[1196.24s] right here China&#39;s this navy blue line
[1199.799s] uh and um us is
[1204.44s] basically uh this red line here right
[1207.32s] around the exact same age so uh China&#39;s
[1210.08s] a little bit ahead that&#39;s why I think
[1211.4s] they&#39;ve got a three to five year run and
[1213.36s] I think us has another two years I think
[1215.88s] we&#39;ve got a seven or eight year run uh
[1218.4s] effectively straight up because of that
[1219.88s] population advantage and then you look
[1221.88s] at other countries like uh and Britain
[1225.76s] is also in that favorable situation uh
[1228.88s] uh other countries like EU
[1233.48s] Japan do not have that Advantage they
[1236.039s] are Beyond The Beneficial years and
[1239.4s] they&#39;re going to continue to be slow
[1240.88s] Dallas fed manufactur the advantage that
[1243.28s] the EU might have over China is that
[1246.64s] they can import more uh import more
[1249.12s] people more
[1250.28s] immigration uh which could help them in
[1252.679s] terms of population growth and age
[1255.159s] demographics which could really help
[1256.76s] them from from a labor force standpoint
[1259.08s] Dallas manufacturing we
[1262.919s] covered most positive reactions to beats
[1266.2s] since Q4 of 2018 so far uh long short
[1270.96s] Equity Funds very long US Stocks which
[1274.32s] is uh when they say stocks and
[1279.559s] equities they&#39;re referring to
[1282.559s] concentration in the S&amp;P which is
[1284.44s] effectively mag 7 and when you get that
[1286.96s] overweight like we saw in late 20 21
[1290.0s] what happened Tech got shellacked and we
[1292.32s] saw indications of that which is why we
[1294.679s] took off most of those positions in July
[1297.679s] uh after huge runs and the tail ends uh
[1300.72s] in in the past couple of months so
[1303.679s] treasury yields uh versus WTI Crude this
[1308.64s] Divergence always resolves in 2022 you
[1313.08s] had the opposite Divergence you had WTI
[1316.159s] at a peak and treasury yields at a
[1319.36s] contraction now you have treasury yields
[1321.76s] way up and uh WTI Crude weigh down I
[1326.0s] think this resolves I think they&#39;re
[1327.36s] going to wind up meeting in the middle
[1328.679s] yields are going to come down
[1329.88s] meaningfully and energy probably starts
[1332.6s] to go
[1334.52s] up us job openings as a matter of fact
[1337.64s] it&#39;s interesting Trump was talking about
[1340.36s] helping the oil industry by having OPEC
[1345.32s] cut barrels which is kind of interesting
[1348.36s] uh because I guess the energy industry
[1350.72s] said got got wise to him and said drill
[1352.52s] baby drill doesn&#39;t help us it may help
[1354.24s] you it doesn&#39;t help us so uh so maybe
[1356.72s] there&#39;s a compromise to be had there us
[1358.6s] job openings again jolts collapsing
[1361.52s] which gives the employers more pricing
[1363.559s] power for labor quits rate has gone down
[1367.559s] people are not quitting their jobs
[1368.919s] anymore because they can&#39;t name their
[1370.279s] price across the street and perceived
[1372.96s] likelihood of a recession over the next
[1374.52s] 12 months drop to a new low in October
[1381.559s] hedge funds are very short on green
[1383.679s] stocks you know I continue to look at
[1385.559s] some of these solar stocks and
[1388.4s] um and others because people are so
[1391.559s] short and
[1394.4s] uh
[1396.52s] uh the opposite of what people are
[1398.96s] expecting people think if Trump gets
[1400.4s] elected energy stocks go up when he was
[1402.64s] in last time they did terribly uh green
[1406.36s] stocks did horribly under Biden people
[1408.559s] thought they would do well they did
[1410.2s] better under Trump so I think there
[1411.799s] might be a pony in this pile I don&#39;t
[1413.64s] know if it&#39;s EVS or solar probably
[1416.48s] something in
[1417.64s] solar um so we continue to look uh maybe
[1421.32s] the way to play it is the way that we
[1422.84s] have with the started position in Alam
[1424.72s] Maro and just kind of deal with the
[1426.64s] picks and shovels related to these
[1429.039s] themes
[1430.6s] um uh that that&#39;s probably the way I&#39;ll
[1433.279s] wind up playing it but uh US tech stocks
[1435.72s] have been seeing more frequent fragility
[1438.039s] events with 2024 currently on track to
[1440.679s] have nearly the most since 1992 Sigma
[1445.039s] moves with magnitude greater than three
[1447.36s] for tech stocks in the S&amp;P
[1451.039s] 500 fragility events are also more
[1453.2s] extreme in the magnitude for the largest
[1455.0s] stocks of the S&amp;P currently exhibiting
[1456.84s] their largest magnitude since
[1459.2s] 1992 uh so basically they&#39;re saying the
[1462.12s] mag7 is vulnerable uh based on this uh
[1465.559s] data that they&#39;re collecting mentions of
[1468.36s] botom surged which is historically
[1471.48s] indicated a bottoming of the EPS cycle
[1473.919s] which we saw uh up further we&#39;ll Co
[1477.039s] cover that again initial jobless claims
[1480.12s] uh have come down so that&#39;s something to
[1482.399s] keep an eye on we&#39;ll see what happens
[1484.36s] with the jobs report tomorrow we need it
[1486.159s] to be a little bit weak but not too weak
[1489.039s] weak enough to keep the FED on track for
[1491.64s] the November
[1494.52s] cut although one war is uh based on the
[1498.399s] election outcome that they might be
[1500.96s] influenced to act in one way or another
[1504.88s] um but
[1506.919s] um but let&#39;s just see the data so far
[1509.48s] they&#39;ve been data data dependent so
[1511.2s] let&#39;s hope that continues wanted to show
[1513.159s] you some seasonality of a few of the
[1515.279s] names we&#39;ve discussed on the podcast
[1517.52s] some of which we own for clients and
[1520.039s] personally uh Cooper standard you can
[1522.24s] see the best time of the year for Cooper
[1523.96s] standard stock happens to be the end of
[1526.32s] the year in November and December
[1529.48s] uh TLT bonds again last month is the
[1531.96s] worst month of the year this month
[1533.64s] November is the best month of the year
[1536.96s] so we should see some compression in
[1538.72s] yields uh Regional Bank stocks tend to
[1541.799s] have their best three months October
[1543.36s] November December that&#39;s consistent with
[1545.12s] small caps o uh in November and December
[1548.039s] have monster months and then biotech is
[1550.679s] supposed to have a big month in November
[1552.64s] historically it does uh Advanced Auto
[1555.24s] Parts does well with small caps in
[1557.24s] December
[1558.84s] and uh even Estee louder which got
[1560.919s] shellacked today uh we&#39;re thinking about
[1564.0s] making it a sign more meaningful
[1567.08s] position uh bought some stock today
[1569.44s] doing some work on on that um you know
[1572.72s] it&#39;s never been a big position because
[1574.44s] it&#39;s too correlated to China and Alibaba
[1576.48s] and we have enough exposure there but I
[1578.52s] think now it&#39;s a high enough quality
[1580.279s] business they&#39;ve got the new CEO he&#39;ll
[1582.0s] probably have one more kitchen syn
[1583.559s] quarter uh the first quarter that he
[1586.0s] reports on and then the thing can can
[1588.6s] start to move and and turn with China um
[1591.48s] and it may turn quicker which is why
[1593.12s] we&#39;re opportunistically taking
[1596.159s] advantage
[1597.88s] Intel they just reported after the Bell
[1600.44s] the stock was up big
[1603.32s] um this
[1606.0s] is November is the best month of the
[1608.32s] year they&#39;re up 100% of the time in
[1610.32s] November so I think we&#39;re going to get
[1611.679s] some follow through with the after hour
[1614.919s] um
[1615.76s] Spike particularly after the election
[1618.559s] Etsy is a new position that we have not
[1621.24s] disclosed on the podcast that we entered
[1623.08s] a couple of weeks ago uh I think our
[1625.919s] basis is somewhere in the 49s and change
[1629.039s] uh we&#39;ll probably have another chance to
[1630.36s] buy it in the 40s but it&#39;s a nice siiz
[1632.2s] position they had great earnings we&#39;re
[1634.039s] not going to do anything comprehensive
[1635.799s] on that yet um but uh just putting that
[1639.0s] out there uh Seth golden talking about
[1642.279s] small caps looking good haven&#39;t broken
[1644.279s] out to new Highs but crawling their way
[1645.88s] higher we&#39;ve been talking about that for
[1647.559s] a while
[1649.159s] uh we have the seasonality here and then
[1652.679s] the first 10 trading days of November
[1655.12s] are amongst the best trading days of the
[1657.24s] year in a presidential election year
[1660.44s] this is
[1667.519s] um right
[1670.36s] here uh so that&#39;s the best 10-day period
[1672.76s] so we&#39;ll see how that plays out this
[1674.24s] year weak demand mentions are tracking
[1676.84s] at the lowest level in two years meaning
[1678.799s] demand has reacceleration across the S&amp;P
[1681.2s] 500 components mentions of bottoms which
[1684.12s] we discussed indicator suggests a 12%
[1687.48s] year-on-year EPS growth in Q4 versus 10%
[1691.399s] consensus so Q3 is the pause that
[1694.64s] refreshes Q4 uh it&#39;s looking like
[1697.6s] earnings are going to come in even
[1698.919s] higher than the street is expecting on
[1700.84s] the basis of this data and then here is
[1703.519s] the mag 7 and 493 are all slowing in Q3
[1707.679s] and then reaccelerating in Q4 which we
[1710.519s] have touched on paused before
[1712.76s] reacceleration and you can see by sector
[1716.279s] uh energy is going to be the most
[1717.96s] negative this quarter also negative next
[1720.64s] quarter and then starts to re accelerate
[1722.279s] next year they&#39;ll start to discount it
[1724.519s] uh Industrials negative this quarter
[1726.2s] then starts to re accelerate
[1727.919s] meaningfully uh next
[1730.32s] year and then materials re accelerate
[1733.279s] starting next quarter so that&#39;s like the
[1734.799s] Alba marals of the world will start to
[1736.919s] really do well Healthcare should re
[1738.96s] accelerate week quarter this quarter
[1740.76s] should start to do a lot better consumer
[1742.919s] discretionary which we&#39;ve talked about a
[1744.559s] lot uh com services and and utilities so
[1748.559s] uh that&#39;s a good road map and then worst
[1751.2s] inventory destocking cycle is likely
[1753.24s] behind us which we talked about so you
[1755.279s] can see here and this is just the
[1756.919s] beginning of the recovery When You See
[1758.48s] It move back up to that Baseline like
[1760.679s] you did in
[1761.88s] 2003 you had four more years of rally
[1764.36s] like you did in 2011 you had uh nine
[1767.6s] more years a rally like you did in
[1770.559s] 200 uh 2000 and then you had another two
[1773.76s] years of a rally so uh this is just
[1776.76s] beginning just re accelerating and you
[1779.0s] can see it in the Korean exports are
[1780.919s] still strong and the rail Freight card
[1782.96s] loads continue to rise software lagged
[1786.48s] semis by the biggest spread over the
[1788.279s] past two years except during the tech
[1790.399s] bubble uh so that&#39;s a a pretty big
[1794.0s] extreme there to start to pay attention
[1795.76s] to and we&#39;ll start to look at some stuff
[1797.519s] in soft
[1798.559s] software um Equity sentiment is getting
[1802.24s] warmer but not really extreme according
[1804.6s] to the bull bear indicator at
[1808.279s] uh Bank of America and then quarterly
[1811.64s] Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20
[1814.08s] years which is exactly what we saw in
[1817.159s] 2001 and 2002 before the 3 to four year
[1820.12s] run which had china Emerging Markets
[1823.039s] small caps and value dramatically
[1824.88s] outperformed the rest of the market
[1826.24s] while Tech had uh subdued
[1828.799s] returns to put it mildly uh Equity
[1831.6s] weighted S&amp;P 500 inflected higher versus
[1834.24s] cap weighted post June CPI report and
[1837.0s] that has persisted that&#39;s just the
[1838.6s] beginning of the game not the end of the
[1840.12s] game then we&#39;ve got our sler stuff from
[1843.2s] uh RBC thanks to my buddy over
[1845.679s] there uh and as you can see it looks
[1847.88s] like we topped out with yields in the
[1850.24s] past week at 4.3 and now we&#39;re bouncing
[1852.76s] off that resistance at the
[1855.08s] 61.8% level for those of you who care
[1857.6s] about Fibonacci levels uh we are not
[1860.799s] really one of them but we we pay
[1862.679s] attention to what other people are
[1863.88s] paying attention to and that&#39;s called
[1865.519s] Game Theory um then the S&amp;P
[1869.0s] 500 uh so you know you had this cup and
[1871.72s] handle it broke out it wouldn&#39;t
[1874.2s] be unexpected for it to go back and test
[1877.76s] the breakout level of 5669 on the S&amp;P
[1881.559s] 500 not saying it will but saying I
[1883.639s] wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we had that and
[1885.6s] that would probably be make a lot of
[1887.399s] sense
[1888.76s] mostly pre-election or if the election
[1891.2s] decision gets dragged out a few days in
[1893.12s] that uncertain period uh that&#39;s the kind
[1896.039s] of thing you could see semiconductors
[1898.72s] have been weak trying to get off the mat
[1900.96s] we&#39;ll see if uh November is seasonally a
[1903.72s] very strong period for semiconductors
[1905.679s] maybe Intel can play a role in leading
[1908.08s] some of them out of the woods uh S&amp;P we
[1911.44s] covered NASDAQ we covered gold price
[1914.639s] this is at the 261.5
[1917.96s] Bacci extension level uh which kind of
[1920.48s] confirms what we&#39;re saying you&#39;re
[1921.88s] probably at a top not a not a not a
[1924.279s] bottom for sure uh copper is kind of
[1927.08s] just consolidating looks exactly like
[1928.919s] the H hang say they call it Dr copper
[1931.44s] because it talks about the global
[1932.679s] economy which darts in China demand and
[1935.72s] the hangsang you had this huge rally up
[1937.88s] as we all know and now that it&#39;s
[1939.36s] checking back uh people are getting
[1942.88s] nervous they&#39;ve all forgot about what
[1944.559s] teer said uh God willing we get a
[1947.0s] pullback I&#39;m going to double down again
[1948.919s] and break my position limits and add
[1950.76s] more and we added back all of the option
[1953.44s] premium on Baba uh when um uh baba got
[1958.039s] back to 95 96 97 Range so we&#39;re reset uh
[1962.279s] for another year plus plus and uh and
[1966.799s] pretty excited about the opportunity
[1968.36s] that was served up Trend and cycle
[1971.32s] technical weekly
[1973.32s] chartbook uh see if there&#39;s anything new
[1976.24s] here from SL ler over at
[1979.559s] RBC again just talking about that check
[1982.12s] back here to the 5600 and change level
[1984.519s] as a
[1985.96s] possibility um not saying it will happen
[1988.72s] just saying I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if
[1990.0s] it did happen midcaps have been
[1991.44s] consolidating for a few months they
[1993.12s] could they shall should break higher
[1994.72s] here towards the end of the year along
[1996.0s] with small caps I think small caps break
[1998.08s] out in the next two months this is a
[2000.48s] large cup and handle uh so the implied
[2003.76s] measured move would be from 1,000 to
[2006.24s] 4700 so 400 points his FIB level has you
[2009.72s] at 1,700 my measured move would have you
[2011.96s] at 1,800 but the name of the game is
[2014.48s] earnings are going to re accelerate and
[2016.12s] support all this nonsense Voodoo about
[2018.519s] lines and charts but it just helps to
[2020.24s] zoom out and take a look at these things
[2021.919s] so you can see where you are here&#39;s the
[2023.76s] weekly Russell this thing looks
[2025.2s] beautiful uh to break out meaningfully
[2027.84s] and continue to go so that&#39;s going to be
[2029.6s] your best value to price price is what
[2032.159s] you pay value is what you&#39;re going to
[2033.44s] get uh in the market right now and all
[2035.88s] the impatient bobbleheads on TV
[2038.399s] that keep saying oh the small cap
[2040.0s] trade&#39;s not working blah blah blah um
[2042.76s] just take the stock away from them and
[2045.08s] they can buy it from you 30% higher uh
[2048.159s] hangsang index here as pessimistic as
[2050.8s] everyone is on China when you step back
[2053.359s] the the name of the game is you have
[2055.399s] rallies you have consolidations rallies
[2057.28s] consolidations and this will happen all
[2058.679s] the way up and the idea is to get the
[2061.04s] disbelievers to buy at the top take them
[2063.2s] out of their stock at the bottom get
[2064.72s] them to buy at the top take them out of
[2066.52s] their stock at the bottom get the them
[2067.839s] to buy at the top take them out of their
[2069.399s] stock at the bottom and then they will
[2071.52s] be the final buyers at uh at the peak uh
[2074.76s] with all the gold bugs right now 10year
[2077.599s] yield
[2078.76s] weekly um he&#39;s saying it&#39;s not really
[2082.2s] quite yet overbought given but you have
[2084.52s] this kind of downtrend line of the RSI
[2088.44s] or whatever nonsense the key is November
[2091.48s] bonds are going to Rally okay that
[2093.639s] that&#39;s that&#39;s my view and I&#39;m sticking
[2095.079s] to it could I be wrong and it goes to
[2096.879s] 446 before it goes to 385 sure I could
[2100.32s] be wrong and it does that I wouldn&#39;t bet
[2102.079s] on it as a matter of fact I would be
[2103.76s] opportunistically buying TLT not selling
[2106.04s] it uh dollar Index again a different
[2108.64s] view here hit this level of
[2110.599s] resistance we think it&#39;s going to start
[2112.48s] to weaken again could it be wrong and it
[2114.68s] goes to 106 before it goes below 100
[2117.079s] sure but I wouldn&#39;t bet on it once
[2120.92s] again Canadian dollar it&#39;s just putting
[2124.2s] in this base I think it&#39;s going to break
[2125.839s] through this downtrend line finally on
[2127.359s] the next move up maybe that starts in
[2129.0s] the next couple of months we need an
[2130.839s] election Catalyst all the stuff is kind
[2132.44s] of hanging out and count counter Trend
[2134.359s] moving and people chasing nonsense and
[2137.599s] here it looks like gold has a little
[2139.0s] move further to 2817 if you look at his
[2142.44s] FIB extension stuff copper uh just
[2145.599s] consolidating like the Hang saying in
[2147.2s] China before its next move higher if you
[2149.119s] want to play on something to break into
[2150.52s] new highs I&#39;d be selling gold and buying
[2152.64s] copper there&#39;s your pair trade for the
[2154.079s] next nine months sell gold buy copper um
[2157.319s] or
[2158.56s] sell Fang by China uh similar trade so
[2162.319s] that&#39;s that
[2164.52s] and don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else
[2166.88s] here Nvidia pressing up against the
[2169.16s] double top we&#39;ll see if it gets an ex
[2171.8s] extension you know it&#39;s interesting
[2173.599s] November is a strong month for
[2174.64s] semiconductors so maybe it does pop up
[2176.64s] here um but I&#39;ll leave that to you guys
[2179.24s] all I know is the odds of Nvidia
[2181.599s] doubling before uh many of these other
[2183.76s] stocks doubling are are very low because
[2185.8s] it would be a fourth of GD GDP
[2188.2s] but uh I&#39;ll leave that to others to
[2189.76s] chase the last few pennies uh Apple I
[2192.88s] think it was down a little bit after
[2194.079s] hours we&#39;ll see how that plays out any
[2197.0s] other key companies we want to cover
[2206.359s] here uh
[2211.359s] okay all right I think that&#39;s good for
[2214.04s] now from
[2215.8s] this oh he&#39;s got a lot of names in here
[2218.119s] this week okay uh quotes of the week
[2220.68s] when stocks are attractive you buy them
[2222.48s] sure they can go lower I&#39;ve bought
[2223.88s] stocks at $12 that went to $2 but then
[2225.96s] they later went to $30 you just don&#39;t
[2228.0s] know when you can find the bottom that&#39;s
[2229.48s] from Peter Lynch I too have had that
[2231.64s] happen uh with uh range resources at 11
[2234.96s] went down to one whatever it was 116 or
[2238.2s] something we brought our basis down to
[2239.76s] four and change now it&#39;s 30 plus and
[2242.359s] going to 60 why not on a guess not on
[2245.359s] Fibonacci nonsense on the B basis of the
[2248.119s] liquidation value approved and unproved
[2250.48s] similar situation we&#39;re going to see
[2252.04s] with com stock resources over the next
[2253.96s] few
[2256.48s] years Warren Buffett a market downturn
[2259.4s] doesn&#39;t bother us it is an opportunity
[2261.079s] to increase our ownership of great
[2263.04s] companies with great management at good
[2266.04s] prices so those of you who have been
[2268.24s] with us for a while you know we
[2269.64s] consistently do that over and over and
[2272.4s] over and um here are some indicators I
[2275.72s] just want to put on a bulletin board to
[2277.04s] give you an a where we may be here&#39;s the
[2279.319s] pmo buy all back down to zero that&#39;s
[2281.68s] always a good time to buy it&#39;s not quite
[2283.48s] there yet so maybe we get another day or
[2285.079s] two of weakness before the election or
[2287.52s] the election decision same with pmo by
[2290.04s] SPX this is what you see closer to the
[2292.56s] bottom than at the top um and then you
[2295.119s] also see some of these
[2297.04s] indicators pretty washed out on a daily
[2299.48s] basis the NASDAQ Advanced decline this
[2302.16s] is usually when you get bounces so given
[2305.079s] how oversold we are going into the jobs
[2308.359s] report it wouldn&#39;t shock me if we got a
[2310.0s] bounce Tomorrow based on some of these
[2311.44s] stretch things doesn&#39;t preclude the idea
[2313.72s] of getting two super stretched days in a
[2315.92s] row the odds don&#39;t favor it so I would
[2318.16s] be probably looking more for a bounce
[2320.079s] than a a crash um and certainly over the
[2324.04s] next few days if not tomorrow and uh and
[2327.52s] then you just see some of these great
[2328.76s] companies that are really beat down none
[2331.24s] of which we&#39;re buying we are looking at
[2332.8s] Dow holdings but probably not do
[2334.52s] anything there because we&#39;d have to sell
[2336.079s] something else to do it uh Nike someone
[2339.04s] has a question about that this week I
[2340.72s] have no problem with Nike at these
[2342.52s] levels uh it&#39;s just we own Vans and I
[2344.839s] think
[2345.76s] there&#39;s higher upside of multibagger in
[2349.96s] Vans being a certainly a double from our
[2352.88s] basis uh much lower than here but even a
[2355.88s] triple plus and Beyond versus Nike
[2358.839s] getting a double would be very very nice
[2360.92s] and a triple probably not likely in any
[2362.96s] reasonable time period but I&#39;m all for
[2365.079s] doubles over couple two three years
[2368.48s] I think Nike could do it but I wouldn&#39;t
[2370.319s] have the level of certainty as having
[2372.359s] Brack and Daryl uh doing a turnaround
[2374.76s] situation so that&#39;s why we&#39;ve uh you got
[2377.079s] to pick and choose um but you know a lot
[2379.68s] of these companies have come down so you
[2381.28s] just get a feel of the overall Market
[2382.8s] looking a lot of this stuff these are
[2384.76s] things I do on a regular basis daily
[2387.72s] basis uh here&#39;s a from Bloomberg Intel
[2390.28s] surges after results spark optimism over
[2394.04s] turnaround as a matter of fact we are
[2396.839s] going
[2397.5s] [Music]
[2399.72s] to where did I put
[2405.119s] that okay we&#39;re going to go ahead and
[2409.04s] play Pat Ginger right before his
[2412.52s] earnings call a couple of hours ago on
[2416.119s] CNBC with John Fort here we go Intel
[2419.24s] stock sharply higher right now in
[2420.88s] overtime up 12% after reporting results
[2423.76s] moments ago joining me now in a first on
[2425.52s] CNBC interview before the conference
[2427.52s] call is Intel CEO Pat Ginger Pat welcome
[2430.96s] I didn&#39;t know how investors were going
[2432.52s] to digest this one not used to seeing a
[2435.8s] non-gaap uh EPS loss here but this has
[2439.4s] to do with equipment bought uh covid
[2443.359s] time frame 10 nanometer that you just
[2445.64s] couldn&#39;t Lo that you just couldn&#39;t use
[2448.44s] is this over with this scale of these
[2452.599s] types of of charges many of them
[2455.28s] non-cash yeah thanks Chan and always a
[2457.599s] pleasure to uh chat with you you know
[2459.839s] and overall I just say we had underlying
[2461.92s] strength in the business this quarter
[2464.079s] but we had the one-time charges that
[2466.599s] were consistent with what we indicated
[2468.52s] on our last earnie&#39;s call the major
[2470.359s] restructuring that we have done you know
[2472.56s] the people actions against the business
[2474.8s] and as you say these one-time charges
[2477.319s] for the Intel 7 equipment you know
[2480.119s] simply put we had too much equipment you
[2482.2s] know somewhat induced by the covid era
[2484.76s] expectations of a much larger PC you
[2487.8s] know business at the time that equipment
[2490.119s] isn&#39;t useful as we move to the euv nodes
[2493.2s] Intel 3 intel 18a so we did take this
[2496.56s] one time uh write off associated with it
[2499.599s] in addition to the impairment charges
[2502.0s] which are largely en counting uh uh
[2504.8s] charges that are affected this quarter
[2506.96s] but when you look at the underlying
[2508.359s] business great progress on products on
[2510.72s] Foundry you know a beat and raise so
[2513.88s] obviously the markets are responding
[2515.56s] positively but our view is you know we
[2517.48s] have a lot of work to do and we had a
[2519.28s] lot that we got done this quarter so a
[2521.04s] really solid quarter of execution Give
[2523.119s] me the give and take between the client
[2525.24s] business and the data center business
[2527.0s] client Computing was just about in line
[2529.52s] slightly less than uh the consensus
[2532.44s] though I think after AMD investors might
[2534.44s] have been expecting that data center
[2536.2s] actually did a little bit better than a
[2538.359s] lot of analysts were expecting out there
[2540.319s] what what did you see demand wise yeah
[2543.44s] overall our client business we made
[2545.559s] significant adjustments with our
[2547.24s] customers to lower inventory levels so
[2549.4s] we go into the rest of the year with a
[2551.64s] very good inventory position and a very
[2553.92s] robust uh product line for our client uh
[2557.359s] business overall you know clearly uh
[2559.64s] different segments of the market like
[2560.96s] the desktop products we weren&#39;t quite a
[2563.52s] strong this quarter but overall we&#39;re on
[2566.2s] it for the aipc our leadership there
[2569.92s] very strong launch of lunar Lake our
[2573.0s] core Ultra product you know that just
[2575.2s] has really set the world right
[2577.8s] a tither on just how strong that product
[2580.44s] is battery life AI performance and on
[2583.64s] the data center side yeah a little bit
[2585.319s] better than was forecast in that
[2586.96s] business and clearly our Zeon 6 product
[2589.72s] line that is now uh in the market is
[2592.079s] starting to gain momentum there and our
[2594.88s] overall position for you know the Zeon
[2598.48s] as the AI data center CPU of choice has
[2602.64s] definitely been a positive for that area
[2604.76s] of the business as well overall very
[2607.119s] solid product execution quickly I want
[2609.48s] to go back to something that you just
[2610.8s] said uh because last quarter you said
[2614.2s] that you expected Q3 to be tough on
[2616.52s] inventory but then that would set you up
[2618.599s] well for uh a bounce or or uplift in Q4
[2622.52s] has that worked out as well less well
[2625.48s] than you expected so far yeah I think
[2628.0s] overall the PC market maybe slightly
[2630.52s] smaller right as people are looking at
[2632.76s] the finish of the year that said you
[2635.16s] know I think everybody is expecting
[2636.64s] growth in the overall PC market for next
[2639.64s] year based on a major Windows refresh AI
[2643.359s] PC a bit more Global strength China uh
[2647.0s] economy uh recovery so overall we
[2649.359s] believe we&#39;re very well set up for Q4
[2652.24s] and for next year in the level of
[2654.359s] inventory and our product portfolio with
[2656.88s] our customers okay now I&#39;m always asking
[2659.079s] about it tell me about gudy 3 I believe
[2661.599s] that was launching in Q3 you&#39;ve touted
[2664.96s] that it delivers 2x performance ments
[2667.48s] per dollar on inference and training
[2669.8s] versus h100 that said you are selling it
[2672.88s] for less of course and uh Nvidia does
[2675.76s] have Blackwell out how does the
[2677.4s] reception look for that product now long
[2680.599s] awaited as you&#39;re launching it yeah
[2683.079s] gouty 3 strong product and uh the
[2685.72s] efforts in having a strong you know set
[2688.96s] of use cases you&#39;ve seen that we announc
[2691.16s] with the IBM they&#39;re gouty 3 in the IBM
[2694.8s] AI Cloud we&#39;re getting good reception
[2696.839s] for from that and early Market uptake is
[2699.52s] very strong for gy 3 and we&#39;re really
[2701.92s] focusing on what I&#39;ll call the
[2703.839s] enterprise TCO inferencing Centric use
[2707.92s] cases where Zeon plus gouty really
[2711.44s] deliver a compelling offering for
[2714.359s] Enterprises who you know really are now
[2716.48s] saying oh that high-end AI cloud
[2719.2s] training is great how do I use it or how
[2721.96s] do I inference with it and that&#39;s where
[2724.2s] we&#39;re seeing our strength on both Zeon
[2726.359s] and gouty
[2728.359s] and we&#39;re back and then want to get to
[2731.76s] some of these
[2733.68s] here and we&#39;ll go into Intel more
[2736.04s] detailed probably next week uh Jim
[2739.319s] Kramer says to buy Stanley Black and&amp;
[2740.76s] Deckers post earnings plunge
[2742.079s] aggressively it&#39;s not a plunge it&#39;s up
[2744.0s] from whatever it&#39;s up $70
[2746.16s] or uh let&#39;s see Stanley Black and&amp;
[2750.0s] Decker they&#39;re doing everything they
[2751.44s] said they&#39;re going to do top Line&#39;s
[2752.68s] still a little soft but they&#39;ve taken
[2754.2s] the costs out um
[2758.4s] so all that operating leverage will kick
[2761.0s] in as rates continue to come down
[2763.68s] and Rehab jobs come up yeah from 65 to
[2767.64s] 92 so it plunged from 110 but it&#39;s you
[2772.079s] know all these things are relative
[2773.96s] especially when it&#39;s going to 200 plus
[2775.839s] and we&#39;ve been in this one and we&#39;ll
[2777.16s] continue to be in this one and if it did
[2779.359s] get an eight handle on it uh we could be
[2781.599s] able to buy it for new people which
[2782.92s] would be awesome but um it&#39;s not there
[2785.76s] yet uh
[2788.92s] um inel oh Boeing great news after work
[2793.04s] uh Boeing reaches new deal with Union in
[2796.44s] hopes of ending strike this was right
[2798.28s] after the close and uh so they&#39;re going
[2801.16s] to vote it on it on Monday it&#39;s no
[2803.04s] coincidence they&#39;re going to vote on it
[2804.48s] Monday right before the election because
[2807.559s] they may quickly
[2809.839s] be um faced with
[2813.24s] a an Administration that is less
[2819.04s] favorable towards uh
[2821.92s] union strikes particularly when it
[2824.24s] relates to holding up defense projects
[2826.359s] for the uh Department of Defense so I
[2829.64s] think that um they&#39;re going to vote Yes
[2832.24s] on Monday that&#39;s going to be a great
[2833.64s] thing for the stock they&#39;re they&#39;ve
[2835.24s] raised sufficient capital and then they
[2837.52s] can go back to generating a ton of cash
[2839.599s] and um we&#39;re excited about that Etsy
[2842.16s] beats quarterly estimates for gross
[2843.88s] merchandise sales board approves a
[2846.04s] billion
[2847.4s] share repurchase and this is a
[2849.079s] relatively small company so a billion
[2850.64s] dollar share repurchase moves the
[2853.76s] needle um their revenues came in much
[2856.359s] higher than expected 2.92 versus
[2859.8s] 2.89 uh I&#39;m
[2861.88s] sorry quarterly Revenue came in at
[2865.119s] um uh 662 versus 652 estimates and there
[2871.079s] was a lot to dig into there so that&#39;s a
[2872.64s] very positive Niche moded business
[2875.16s] specialized business gift giving does
[2876.839s] very well in November December uh so
[2879.2s] we&#39;ll probably get a bounce out of that
[2880.76s] and then uh decide how meaningfully we
[2882.96s] want it to be uh in the New Year Estee
[2885.8s] louder stock drops on disappointing
[2887.4s] guidance and cut dividend I think at
[2889.319s] this level you&#39;ve got a margin of safety
[2891.4s] you know people say wait two or three
[2892.8s] days after a big plunge but uh I think
[2895.72s] that that&#39;s going to be more
[2897.44s] constructive I you know the alternative
[2899.4s] is you wait to hear the new CEO in their
[2901.8s] first quarter but at these levels it
[2903.599s] starts to become uh kind of a giveaway
[2906.359s] it has your money it has your pant size
[2908.64s] here&#39;s what PayPal is doing with them
[2910.119s] the payments company is joining other
[2911.359s] Finance firms in the vast market for
[2913.4s] customer data they&#39;ve got more than um
[2916.48s] the vast majority of companies that&#39;s
[2917.8s] going to be a huge free cash flow
[2919.359s] generator for them and it&#39;s just
[2921.0s] beginning thanks to Alex Chris Michael
[2923.48s] bur is betting the house on Chinese
[2925.28s] stocks and this billionaire investor is
[2927.4s] too uh which is David teer should you
[2930.48s] follow them and the answer is you should
[2932.76s] do your own work but uh it&#39;s nice to see
[2935.0s] all the crowd is running in now that the
[2938.599s] stocks are up and they&#39;re going to go up
[2940.319s] a lot higher Star Chinese fund manager
[2942.68s] bets on Alibaba liquor stocks for
[2944.359s] shareholder
[2945.64s] returns uh okay welcome to the club
[2948.359s] china stimulus aims to boost consumption
[2950.48s] top official says Vice Finance Minister
[2953.48s] says fiscal moves will be quite large
[2956.16s] lawmakers expected to unveil fiscal
[2958.48s] package in early no November uh
[2961.2s] coincident with the election their
[2964.28s] National people&#39;s Congress standing
[2965.92s] committee meeting is scheduled to take
[2967.88s] place November 4th to November 8th uh
[2970.88s] there&#39;s a legal process to go through
[2972.28s] for China&#39;s fiscal policy so that&#39;s
[2975.839s] going to be a big deal bosses are
[2978.24s] calling workers back to the office
[2979.64s] that&#39;s good news to landlords you heard
[2981.48s] it here first a year and a half ago when
[2983.24s] said everyone said that was not going to
[2984.839s] happen we played vernado for a quick
[2987.04s] huge pop and um and that that game has
[2990.319s] just started
[2993.52s] Intel invest 300 million in China chip
[2996.359s] package and testing plant Intel and
[2999.52s] Samsung to explore Foundry Alliance to
[3003.04s] challenge Taiwan semiconductor it&#39;s an
[3005.359s] oligopoly ladies and gentlemen those are
[3007.04s] the three biggest so if they join forces
[3008.96s] that could be very positive both for
[3010.88s] Samsung and for Intel China&#39;s gen zers
[3013.799s] are into stocks they are so over the
[3016.24s] housing crisis this is huge this is the
[3018.68s] beginning days opinion follows Trend as
[3021.0s] price goes up that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do all
[3022.64s] they&#39;ve known for the last 20 years is
[3025.0s] housing goes up now that&#39;s not happening
[3027.44s] they&#39;re going to reallocate their funds
[3030.119s] to stocks and this game is just getting
[3033.16s] started China confidence consumer
[3035.68s] confidence seen as the key driver for
[3037.799s] growth so that is going to be the theme
[3040.52s] for that special meeting from November
[3042.96s] 4th to 8th where they decide the
[3045.0s] magnitude of the stimulus and if it&#39;s
[3046.76s] Trump it&#39;s going to be the biggest
[3048.24s] fiscal stimulus in the history of China
[3050.16s] in my personal opinion uh China&#39;s
[3053.28s] Central Bank adds $70 billion with new
[3056.04s] liquidity tool so they&#39;re doing these
[3058.119s] baby steps in the background waiting for
[3059.76s] the big bazooka timed right if and when
[3063.88s] uh Trump is elected as new president
[3066.04s] which the betting odds dramatically
[3067.4s] favor at the moment that&#39;s not to say
[3069.96s] that um things can ha change over three
[3073.28s] or four days but uh five days but
[3076.799s] um uh there&#39;s definitely a lot of
[3078.799s] momentum so super micro stock Falls
[3081.359s] further after 33% drop it was funny
[3084.599s] we&#39;ve gotten a bunch of
[3087.92s] uh asked me anything questions about
[3089.76s] this stock for a while and I continued
[3091.92s] to say Do not chase this and not for me
[3095.96s] and they kept saying but the numbers are
[3097.2s] so good the numbers are so good well it
[3098.68s] turns out the numbers were uh Incorrect
[3101.4s] and their auditor stepped down and the
[3103.119s] stock is collapsing uh so
[3106.799s] um so anyway there are telltale signs
[3109.559s] you can only have after you&#39;ve just been
[3111.96s] around for a long time and
[3114.4s] um uh tough for those things to get
[3116.92s] found out during a bull market though so
[3118.68s] that thing must have been egregious
[3119.839s] their financials must have been a
[3120.92s] complete disaster uh and they&#39;re they&#39;re
[3123.44s] they&#39;re toast on that front there&#39;s not
[3124.839s] to say there&#39;s not some value in the
[3126.2s] business but when you&#39;re cooking your
[3127.68s] books and you&#39;re a momentum stock like
[3129.28s] that you&#39;re toast uh and it will take
[3131.44s] years for them to
[3132.799s] rebuild um a stable investor base no
[3136.16s] matter whether or how decent they&#39;re
[3139.76s] underlying business may or may not be VF
[3142.96s] stock again these are all accusations
[3145.04s] but when a major big three accounting
[3147.359s] firm resigns as your auditor it&#39;s
[3148.92s] usually not a sign that the Stock&#39;s
[3150.28s] going up um VF stock surges after Q2
[3153.96s] sales beat profit swing we&#39;ll talk about
[3156.48s] that in detail today China home sales
[3158.88s] see first monthly increase in 2024 on
[3161.76s] stimulus so all these things are
[3163.64s] happening they&#39;re all being ignored
[3165.04s] they&#39;ll all be known when all the stocks
[3166.839s] are up 300% AliExpress invites us
[3170.119s] retailers to sell on the platform that
[3172.04s] continues to grow in leap Leaps and
[3173.76s] Bounds and interestingly enough
[3177.079s] many of you know we were a little
[3181.04s] bit
[3182.559s] um critical of one of the journalist uh
[3186.359s] at that had covered China for the last
[3188.64s] two years in in a very uh one-sided way
[3192.319s] we&#39;ll just put it that way and it seems
[3194.16s] that they&#39;ve shifted the coverage to a
[3195.68s] more balanced reporter who started their
[3198.16s] first article on China with Alibaba
[3200.48s] stock has soared it&#39;s still cheap enough
[3202.4s] to buy and she goes through a bunch of
[3204.4s] the data and the cloud story and
[3206.0s] basically everything I&#39;ve been saying
[3207.28s] about the stock um and uh and the growth
[3210.88s] prospects moving forward so that&#39;s nice
[3212.599s] to see some more balance that&#39;s what I
[3214.52s] expect from Barons that&#39;s what uh that&#39;s
[3216.359s] why Barons is my favorite Financial
[3218.0s] publication and I think the best
[3220.16s] publication in the business and uh it&#39;s
[3222.559s] nice to see that they&#39;re getting or
[3224.52s] staying with that theme uh versus
[3226.92s] getting sidetracked China&#39;s economy
[3228.88s] shows flashes of stimulus taking hold
[3232.119s] and the article of the week is pay or
[3234.559s] play stock market and sentiment results
[3236.799s] so we have will Ferell on the horse with
[3239.52s] the PayPal app and we have the Vans the
[3242.64s] new vans that I got uh last week and the
[3246.28s] company doing incredibly well as it
[3248.599s] relates to PayPal uh they beat on the
[3251.44s] bottom line and raised Guidance the
[3252.839s] revenue Miss was due to intentionally
[3254.76s] discontinuing brain tree Revenue that
[3256.839s] was either low margin or no margin
[3258.799s] business this Wall Street Journal
[3260.2s] article by telis demos which is also a
[3263.2s] superlative publication uh summarizes
[3266.44s] why the stock was red after reporting
[3268.04s] earnings and why it might see a lot of
[3269.599s] green in the future so uh as he says
[3272.599s] PayPal says it is sacrificing some
[3274.4s] volume growth to focus on the more
[3276.16s] profitable payment flows the market
[3278.119s] doesn&#39;t like the look for that for now
[3281.359s] but investors may come to embrace it if
[3283.079s] similar moves at other payment players
[3285.319s] are any guide so what they&#39;ve done is
[3288.2s] brain free is the non-branded stuff
[3290.96s] they&#39;ve increased the margin by adding
[3294.24s] value Services the different checkout
[3296.52s] we&#39;ve discussed the data business all
[3299.04s] the other things so they can make it a
[3300.799s] high margin business the part of the
[3302.76s] business that they were pushing through
[3304.2s] there that is low to no margin they&#39;ve
[3306.839s] just decided we like we&#39;ll just take 80%
[3309.44s] of your business that&#39;s profitable you
[3311.0s] can give the no margin business to
[3312.799s] someone else so the Wall Street Wall
[3315.72s] Street got upset that revenues didn&#39;t
[3318.92s] grow as fast but again this is exactly
[3322.039s] what they did with the unprofitable
[3324.4s] customers in Latin America you remember
[3325.92s] when he came came in he just fired them
[3327.52s] all and now they&#39;re back to Growing
[3329.64s] profitable customers and they&#39;re back to
[3331.359s] 432 million he&#39;s doing the same with
[3333.64s] this side of B with this side of the
[3335.52s] business and Tellis says um similar
[3338.96s] shifts in emphasis have been winning
[3340.839s] moves for shares of other payments
[3342.44s] players lately including a firm by now
[3344.92s] pay later provider its Shares are up
[3346.799s] 149% over the last 12 months Aiden which
[3350.28s] spooked the markets in 2023 by warning
[3352.359s] about increase in competition and
[3354.119s] commoditization in payments likewise
[3356.52s] shifted focus and has seen its shares
[3358.48s] jump 128% in the past year so uh this is
[3362.88s] a proven Playbook Alex Chris will do it
[3365.2s] better than all these folks have done
[3366.96s] but in the interim he had total payment
[3368.799s] volume up 9% net revenues up
[3371.76s] 6% uh operating income 1.5 billion up
[3375.0s] 18% operating margin up
[3377.96s] 18% um uh sorry uh 18.8% up 194 basis
[3383.92s] points transaction margin dollars up
[3387.4s] 8% and uh raising their full year non
[3390.24s] Gap guidance so all of these things are
[3393.16s] clicking
[3395.2s] um their teams drove transaction margin
[3398.64s] dollar growth and brain free because
[3401.16s] they cut off the unprofitable Revenue
[3403.16s] started contributing again to margin
[3405.359s] dollar growth which they hadn&#39;t before
[3408.039s] um they also ramped up fast lane and
[3410.96s] improved the Branded experience across
[3412.4s] the US Partnerships with key players
[3414.039s] like f serve Aiden Amazon Global
[3416.72s] Payments and Shopify these are all new
[3418.72s] Partnerships that have taken on their
[3420.079s] fast lane because it&#39;s better than
[3421.4s] anything else and it dramatically
[3422.64s] improves conversion for everyone so
[3424.88s] they&#39;re licensing it because they can&#39;t
[3426.52s] duplicate it and that&#39;s what makes
[3428.48s] PayPal um just leaving the station uh
[3432.64s] guidance raised for the full year
[3433.76s] reflects not only the third quarter
[3435.16s] outperformance but also a constructive a
[3437.2s] slightly more constructive view of the
[3439.079s] fourth quarter compared to what was
[3440.359s] implied in our last guide in July this
[3442.559s] is driven by more favorable view of
[3444.079s] transaction margin dollar growth which
[3445.799s] we plan to reinvest near-term back into
[3448.039s] strategic initiatives and marketing that
[3449.68s] are aimed at driving long-term durable
[3451.319s] growth I.E some of that&#39;s going into
[3453.52s] Will Ferrell&#39;s pocket to hop around on
[3455.72s] horses and tell everyone that he wants
[3457.72s] to pay from everywhere with all the
[3459.559s] rewards apps and the venmo and the
[3461.48s] PayPal
[3463.96s] app and getting mobile right and this is
[3466.68s] very much like Facebook in 2016 when
[3470.24s] everyone said they didn&#39;t get mobile
[3471.88s] they missed it and then they got it and
[3473.799s] everything took off PayPal is doing the
[3475.559s] same thing with payments their mobile
[3477.76s] game is going to the top shelf from the
[3480.48s] bottom uh basement floor is where it was
[3483.44s] when he took
[3484.599s] over free cash flow from operations one
[3488.359s] was 1
[3490.319s] point6 billion and free cash flow was
[3492.839s] 1.4 billion uh so they continue to buy
[3496.16s] back stock they returned 1.8 billion to
[3498.72s] shareholders by repurchasing
[3500.2s] approximately 28 million shares of stock
[3502.52s] this thing is going to continue to
[3503.72s] generate more and more cash and continue
[3506.119s] need to shrink the float and one day
[3508.319s] you&#39;re going to wake up and it&#39;s $130
[3510.48s] and then it&#39;s $180 and then it&#39;s $200
[3513.48s] and everyone says wow I remember that
[3514.839s] when that was a $58 stock when uh Tom
[3517.68s] was talking about it on his podcast I
[3519.24s] can&#39;t believe it the some of these
[3520.72s] things are obvious you just have to be
[3522.359s] patient and you have to be in the game
[3523.92s] so it&#39;s had this big move from 58 or 60
[3526.76s] to 80 now it&#39;s got going to consolidate
[3529.24s] in the high 70s before making the next
[3531.4s] move up but uh the key is it&#39;s it&#39;s
[3534.28s] gotten through the hard stuff and now
[3535.64s] it&#39;s going to continue to uh raise
[3538.559s] guidance continue to execute continue to
[3541.24s] uh build profitable sustainable growth
[3543.72s] and you can see on a line by line basis
[3546.0s] everything is moving in the right
[3547.359s] direction whether it happens too quickly
[3550.2s] on one metric for the Wall Street cell
[3552.48s] side or not quickly enough because
[3554.359s] people can&#39;t wait two or three months
[3556.28s] does not concern me I have a great
[3557.839s] company at an unbelievable basis and uh
[3560.839s] and we&#39;re going to ride this thing um
[3563.4s] just like will frell on his horse paying
[3566.119s] from everywhere you can see him in the
[3567.839s] ad
[3568.799s] there 1 million new PayPal debit card
[3571.799s] enrollments since September launch I
[3573.839s] mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up it
[3576.359s] just everything is humming here TR um
[3579.599s] active accounts are
[3581.92s] up monthly active accounts active
[3584.48s] accounts number of payment transactions
[3586.319s] up transactions per active account are
[3588.48s] up 9% so not only are more people using
[3590.68s] it the people are using it are using it
[3592.28s] more frequently because they&#39;re giving
[3593.599s] them more rewards more cash back than
[3596.24s] anywhere else and um and that stuff
[3599.2s] starts to multiply geometrically uh I
[3603.0s] want to go through some of these
[3605.72s] here uh evolve from a disparate payment
[3608.52s] products and point Solutions into a
[3610.039s] powerful Commerce platform as we Shi
[3612.28s] from payments company to a Commerce
[3613.68s] platform more of the world&#39;s leading
[3615.4s] Commerce players have partnered with us
[3617.2s] to add value for our mutual customers
[3619.799s] over the past two months we&#39;ve announced
[3621.2s] Partnerships with f serve 8 addan Amazon
[3626.079s] Global Payments and Shopify and we&#39;re
[3627.76s] actively discussing more collaborations
[3629.44s] in the industry these new and expanded
[3631.76s] relationships are clear demonstration
[3633.96s] our brand and Innovations and momentum
[3635.64s] are
[3636.799s] resonating uh so that&#39;s
[3639.839s] that new product experience are
[3642.0s] resulting on average more than 100 basis
[3643.96s] points of conversion lift for the
[3645.2s] vaulted checkout and up to 400 basis
[3647.44s] points of conversion upli uplift for
[3649.559s] onetime checkout we&#39;re also seeing a 15
[3651.68s] to 20% increase in buy now pay later use
[3654.039s] so all this stuff ladies and gentlem
[3656.48s] is staggering how quickly they are
[3658.68s] ramping it up and getting it
[3660.64s] adopted
[3664.079s] um second consecutive quarter in more
[3666.72s] than two years that brain tree is
[3668.48s] meaningfully contributing to transaction
[3671.16s] margin dollar growth that came from
[3673.319s] doing those things that um Street was
[3675.88s] angry at them for doing which is
[3677.2s] basically firing non-profitable negative
[3680.319s] yielding business and only dealing with
[3682.52s] profitable higher margin business by
[3685.119s] adding value ad versus being a commodity
[3690.72s] provider
[3692.92s] uh the scale of customers who are primed
[3695.24s] to spend with PayPal puts us way ahead
[3697.0s] of other guest checkout Solutions and is
[3698.799s] one of the reasons why so many platforms
[3701.0s] are choosing to partner with us we can&#39;t
[3702.599s] wait to get fast lane into the hands of
[3704.359s] more merchants not only on brain tree
[3706.599s] and ppcp but also through our
[3709.079s] Partnerships with f serve addan Global
[3712.16s] Payments next year moving to small and
[3713.92s] medium-sized businesses last months we B
[3715.92s] launch PayPal complete uh oh complete
[3718.839s] payments in new geographies
[3721.799s] including China and Hong Kong with more
[3725.24s] markets on the horizon in 2025 so
[3727.4s] they&#39;ve just launched in China and Hong
[3729.4s] Kong ladies and gentlemen that could be
[3731.52s] very constructive for them in the
[3733.839s] context of the China recovery the TR
[3736.48s] China stimulus and the um China uh
[3741.48s] consumer coming back so that&#39;s a that&#39;s
[3743.599s] a positive thing um
[3748.319s] in the PayPal debit card in addition
[3751.16s] these debit card users are now choosing
[3752.799s] PayPal brand to check out more
[3754.039s] frequently when they shop online early
[3755.72s] data from our existing customers shows a
[3758.039s] 5x increase in total omnis spend within
[3761.039s] the first two weeks of sign up so I mean
[3764.0s] these are things you don&#39;t hear anywhere
[3765.88s] else I I mean this is this is the key
[3769.079s] the the cell side was pissed off about
[3771.64s] transaction take rate declined by four
[3773.52s] basis points to 167 compared to
[3776.4s] uh three basis point decline last
[3778.839s] quarter but they talk about the
[3780.96s] improvements in brain chain venmo
[3782.359s] monetization that&#39;ll come back PayPal
[3784.48s] generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow
[3786.68s] finally we ended the quarter with 16.2
[3788.88s] billion of cash and 12 billion in
[3792.72s] debt uh they talk about the
[3796.039s] tradeoff co oh also Q4 is off to a good
[3799.119s] start consumer feels very strong to us
[3801.68s] at this point so all that&#39;s positive
[3804.119s] some questions from the analyst let&#39;s
[3805.52s] see if there&#39;s any big things here we
[3808.119s] talked about the margin and checkout
[3809.76s] conversion Etc now on to VF cor uh one
[3812.88s] year ago I was on the claim and
[3813.96s] countdown on Fox Business talking about
[3815.4s] the turnaround that would come at VF
[3817.24s] Corp it is now coming to fruition with a
[3819.92s] long exciting Runway ahead those of you
[3822.039s] know it was up some 27% in two sessions
[3825.96s] uh right after earnings and uh has
[3828.079s] stayed above $20 so you can listen to
[3830.88s] when I was pitching Liz when it was 15
[3833.0s] bucks uh a year ago and uh we&#39;re just
[3835.48s] getting started and now we&#39;re going to
[3837.16s] listen to Brack and Daryl joined Jim
[3839.48s] Kramer on CNBC following the earnings
[3841.279s] call yesterday here&#39;s what he had to
[3843.24s] sayal quarter from BF Corp the Footwear
[3846.0s] and apparel power you might know him as
[3847.44s] Vans North Face Timberlin Dickies many
[3849.68s] other brands those numbers sent the
[3851.76s] stock up
[3852.96s] 27% yesterday tax on another 3% today
[3856.599s] holy cow as management held an investor
[3858.92s] event here at the New York Stock sharer
[3860.839s] I got a chance to sit down with Brack
[3862.0s] and darl the president and COO of VF
[3863.64s] Corp whom you remember from when he ran
[3865.799s] Logitech where you create an insane
[3867.839s] amount of value can you work the same
[3869.68s] magic here take a
[3872.4s] look Brack I was worried about VF until
[3875.52s] I heard that you were taking the helm I
[3877.92s] knew you turned around Logitech I know
[3880.279s] you were not wanted to hear mous guy
[3882.559s] takes over fashion company but the truth
[3885.0s] is you made for this job weren&#39;t you you
[3887.079s] know I I look I&#39;m in I&#39;m in heaven here
[3889.559s] I mean I&#39;ve got I&#39;m surrounded by
[3891.2s] amazing iconic Brands and an incredible
[3894.039s] opportunity to create great products I
[3895.88s] just love this stuff now in you&#39;re
[3898.119s] laying things out and today was uh a
[3900.599s] good layout of the medium term you
[3902.0s] haven&#39;t laid out the bran yet however
[3904.599s] you did make it clear in a series of
[3907.24s] what I regard as very candid comments if
[3910.52s] we say it we do it what did you say and
[3914.72s] what have you done well what we what we
[3916.92s] said was we were going to bring we were
[3918.559s] going to uh bring down the debt level by
[3921.799s] by by selling some assets getting
[3923.72s] inventory control a good one you had to
[3925.44s] sell
[3926.359s] that&#39;s right and we and we said we&#39;d
[3927.559s] sell a brand asset we did so we we said
[3929.839s] we&#39;d sell some assets we did we sold
[3931.48s] planes hangers real estate we sold we
[3935.24s] sold uh Supreme which is a fantastic
[3937.48s] asset but didn&#39;t strategically belong in
[3939.279s] the portfolio and we said we&#39;d lower
[3941.279s] cost we took it down by $300 million so
[3943.92s] we what we&#39;ve been saying we&#39;ve been
[3945.559s] doing now that matters because uh one of
[3948.52s] the things that you have is talking
[3950.119s] about a compelling value proposition
[3952.24s] you&#39;re trading significantly off
[3954.4s] sustained historic High highly lever
[3956.599s] with a clear path to delever and then I
[3958.2s] thought this was incredible operating
[3959.96s] income when you&#39;ve come in historic lows
[3962.96s] yeah what a what a t is this the O J
[3965.599s] Stables you got
[3966.96s] here you know I think anytime you you&#39;re
[3969.88s] lucky enough like I&#39;ve been a few times
[3971.88s] to be brought into a turnaround uh your
[3974.359s] temptation is to look at the short term
[3976.16s] and say wow we can flip this really
[3977.88s] quick uh I&#39;ve learned you know the the
[3980.799s] real secret to turnarounds is think long
[3982.92s] term and so the opportunity is to really
[3985.839s] dramatically improve those operating
[3987.279s] margins but the cool thing is the really
[3989.48s] big opportunity for long-term investors
[3991.119s] and for and the reason I&#39;m here is
[3993.039s] long-term strong profitable growth and
[3995.16s] that&#39;s what I&#39;m really building well I
[3996.839s] remember when we first interview at
[3999.079s] Logitech which was really just a
[4000.68s] spectacular run everything excited you
[4004.359s] when I hear you now you talk about how
[4006.48s] much you like a Timberland boot that you
[4008.48s] were so excited about Dickies tell how
[4011.92s] there you go how can I not be excited
[4013.76s] but I&#39;m going to give you a little thing
[4015.319s] because my uh parents were from the
[4016.96s] fashion industry what the hell you doing
[4018.96s] charging half for everything and when
[4020.64s] it&#39;s better than the guys who chargeing
[4022.119s] home I mean I look at I look at the dick
[4025.16s] Dickies okay work pants 35 bucks and
[4027.72s] then I go to that carart yours are no
[4030.0s] yours are same as carart but if they
[4032.16s] have price is that is that correct I&#39;m
[4034.52s] sorry I&#39;ve got it correct yours are
[4035.72s] better but but but but to But to answer
[4038.2s] your question look one of the reasons I
[4039.68s] came to this company I could have done
[4041.079s] other things I came here because I
[4042.44s] didn&#39;t want to be in luxury I wanted to
[4044.44s] be in products that could sell to
[4046.16s] everybody you know I grew up in middle I
[4048.279s] grew up in Kentucky I grew up with a
[4050.44s] single mom I don&#39;t you know I love I
[4053.599s] love this world of where you walk in the
[4055.44s] street and you see people wearing your
[4056.599s] stuff you don&#39;t have to walk into the
[4058.0s] the high-end Fashion Mall and so this is
[4060.319s] my I feel so at home here now uh I do
[4063.48s] want to just get your impression of my
[4065.92s] impression I think that you have a brand
[4068.96s] go to Europe okay I like to go to Europe
[4070.48s] it&#39;s pretty cool and all I ever see is
[4072.48s] Northface I see Northface Northface
[4074.319s] Northface I go to uh to kuram okay the
[4077.599s] nicest Street in Berlin they&#39;re lining
[4079.559s] up for Northface and the last probably
[4082.0s] eight conference calls before you got
[4083.599s] here I never heard Northface how is that
[4086.0s] possible you know Northface is a
[4088.0s] phenomenal brand we&#39;ve really performed
[4089.96s] well in Europe very well in apack not as
[4093.319s] well here that&#39;s the reason you didn&#39;t
[4094.64s] hear about it but but but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll
[4096.64s] change that so I think at the end of the
[4098.52s] day we we&#39;re running a different
[4099.799s] operating model in the rest of the world
[4101.56s] than we were in the US and that created
[4104.199s] it made us bureaucratic slow and and not
[4106.679s] as effective now we&#39;ve changed brought
[4108.719s] the European operating model into the
[4110.719s] American that&#39;s what I and we&#39;re going
[4112.199s] to get our mojo here okay so what do we
[4114.239s] want to be how much online how much
[4116.56s] brick and mortar how much Walmart hey
[4119.48s] which you and I both know is not the
[4120.759s] Walmart that people think it is is cool
[4122.799s] as all get out with the big Dickies
[4124.64s] display how much Costco how much
[4126.88s] everybody else you know look I I one
[4129.6s] thing the the the underlying principle
[4132.08s] of all this is we want to sell where
[4134.08s] people are buying where people come to
[4135.759s] shop so we we love the retailers they&#39;re
[4138.359s] multibrand retailers they&#39;re cuz who&#39;s
[4140.4s] coming in there when you go in there
[4142.679s] you&#39;re thinking okay I might want this
[4144.159s] brand I might want that brand I want
[4145.48s] this category got to be there got to be
[4147.52s] there with great product great marketing
[4149.48s] we also want to be when people are
[4151.4s] loving Dickies or loving bands or the
[4153.279s] North Face or Timberland we want to we
[4155.719s] want them be able to go online and buy
[4157.239s] or go into one of our stores and buy so
[4158.679s] we want to be in all those places and
[4160.719s] let the consumers decide how what the
[4162.319s] proportion is now I believe uh that you
[4165.08s] have obviously have to work about
[4167.04s] markdown management absolutely right
[4168.679s] positioning of global Brands absolutely
[4170.319s] right but you&#39;re an inventor I have
[4172.12s] never seen you come on my show and not
[4173.839s] have seven new things of which I then
[4175.64s] got and my life was better including
[4177.44s] those I still wear you know the the
[4178.839s] great ear airbuds which is like a little
[4180.799s] better than somebody else what you got
[4182.6s] mine what are you thinking what are you
[4183.719s] thinking well I you know look the the
[4185.44s] the most oh give us something you&#39;re
[4186.96s] going to give me something come on give
[4188.239s] me something the crazy fun thing about
[4189.679s] this industry is that there&#39;s so many
[4191.239s] things you can create this is the this
[4193.88s] in in one year this has become um the
[4196.0s] number two shoe sold in Vans it&#39;s it&#39;s
[4198.56s] the called the new school I thought Vans
[4200.199s] was dead oh Vans is not dead Vans is
[4202.76s] just Vans is coming out mans is going to
[4204.96s] be strong now okay so I go into um I I
[4208.239s] mared dyl and lover Foot Locker and
[4210.32s] that&#39;s Nike put slap Nike on that and
[4212.719s] it&#39;s a $250 shoe what are you going for
[4214.96s] here well you know we&#39;re going to sell
[4216.96s] you&#39;re going to buy ALB stuff as much as
[4219.199s] as $129 $149 if you want a really
[4222.0s] specialized functional shoe we have a
[4223.719s] lot of upside room actually on price
[4225.84s] but we&#39;re also going to be Avail me and
[4227.239s] potatoes price so everybody can buy you
[4229.08s] know one of the hottest things in
[4230.32s] styling is high low you your Louis
[4232.44s] Vuitton bag you were your van shoes you
[4235.32s] oh my God yes this is I&#39;m I&#39;m quoting
[4237.199s] Sun Sun who who runs Vans You Who Came
[4239.84s] From L best ver in the industry hey this
[4242.84s] is the world we&#39;re in now no I see Bob C
[4245.159s] with the Air Force Ones and he&#39;s wearing
[4247.239s] it to I got to call I got to get in
[4248.64s] touch with Bob he should be wearing Vans
[4250.12s] or Timberland for sure we&#39;ll we&#39;ll call
[4251.8s] him after this definitely all right so
[4254.0s] time frame how much is I mean already
[4255.8s] You&#39; blown it away I thought that you
[4257.6s] you&#39;d have to have a year of just of
[4259.199s] reading and then the stock goes to 12
[4261.76s] and then you start the launching pad
[4263.199s] you&#39;re already at the launching pip
[4264.44s] what&#39;s next you know this is look as I
[4266.92s] said at the beginning the one thing I&#39;ve
[4268.239s] learned is we&#39;re you know to really turn
[4270.6s] around a business you should be thinking
[4272.239s] very long term because otherwise
[4273.76s] everything you do just comes undone so
[4275.88s] we&#39;re we&#39;re changing almost every
[4277.56s] variable inside the company and
[4279.08s] synchronizing it and that&#39;s going to
[4280.92s] start to click as the years go by and
[4283.56s] over time will become a Growth Company
[4285.719s] is it fun it&#39;s incredibly fun discover
[4288.56s] something new every day among these
[4289.92s] Brands I I am just having a ball
[4292.159s] bringing in inventive people turn to
[4294.32s] have a lot of great people already we&#39;re
[4295.96s] we&#39;ve got great people inside and we&#39;re
[4297.44s] bringing great people from the outside
[4298.8s] well look it is so terrific to see you
[4301.04s] with an iconic company that I have loved
[4303.36s] from when it was when it was wam mening
[4305.96s] in in Pennsylvania where we go and we
[4308.04s] fight over a pair of jeans at the bottom
[4309.719s] of a cardboard box remember was the
[4312.08s] terrific five bucks for a pair of jeans
[4313.719s] that last for they&#39;re still my closet
[4315.4s] Brack andow is the presiden of VF Corp I
[4318.56s] am so thrilled you&#39;re
[4321.44s] here coming
[4323.28s] up and we&#39;re
[4325.48s] back um so effectively they
[4330.8s] have improved beyond what they had
[4335.52s] anticipated they would improve in terms
[4338.159s] of
[4339.44s] the uh the year on-year declines are now
[4344.159s] narrowing and they&#39;re going to start to
[4345.92s] be uh we&#39;re going to start to see year-
[4348.199s] on-year flats and then we&#39;re going to
[4349.6s] start to see year year reacceleration
[4351.92s] and a growth story uh start to happen
[4354.52s] and and that&#39;s a big thing uh gross
[4356.6s] margin was up 120 basis points EPS was
[4360.12s] 52 cents versus - 1116 last year uh net
[4364.56s] debt is down but they got uh 1.5 billion
[4367.48s] in from Supreme so it&#39;s going to be down
[4368.92s] a lot more
[4371.32s] and uh
[4375.8s] for Q3 20 fiscal year
[4379.84s] 2025 expects on a continuing operation
[4382.48s] basis Revenue in the range of 2.7 to
[4384.88s] 2.75 billion down 1 to 3% year-over-year
[4387.96s] in reported dollars so this is really
[4390.08s] narrowing from double digits down to low
[4392.08s] single digits and uh and then we see
[4395.159s] obviously APAC in China was up bigly 6%
[4399.08s] uh despite what everyone else is saying
[4401.04s] and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s been positive
[4405.44s] expanded gross margins they go through
[4407.36s] all of this stuff new new school is
[4409.96s] selling out everywhere which we&#39;ve
[4412.36s] covered uh sold out in five minutes upon
[4414.84s] the launch in
[4418.56s] September uh super strong comparison
[4421.639s] back to
[4423.44s] school North Face is strong hitting on
[4426.199s] all cylinders uh greater China continued
[4429.159s] it strong
[4433.239s] momentum and let&#39;s see here we&#39;re
[4436.159s] running long on
[4437.719s] time uh and then the investor days when
[4440.08s] the real the stock really took off
[4442.32s] talked about long-term sustainable
[4443.76s] profitable growth like he did with Jim
[4445.719s] Kramer transforming its company
[4448.6s] performance
[4450.32s] category adjusted gross margin back up
[4452.88s] to 55% and how they&#39;re going to do that
[4455.4s] operating margin back to 10% net
[4458.04s] leverage 2.5 times or below and then you
[4461.44s] can see some of the slides from the
[4465.12s] investor day which came after the
[4467.08s] earnings day and you can see where
[4469.08s] growth margin is and where it&#39;s going
[4470.88s] and how they&#39;re going to get there uh is
[4473.32s] through reduction of sgna and getting
[4475.84s] that operating margin back to
[4479.08s] 10% uh and uh nine Focus work streams in
[4482.52s] action to drive 500 to $600 million of
[4485.0s] operating income expansion and they go
[4487.32s] through the game plan so this is not you
[4489.159s] know finger in the wind and uh hope hope
[4491.36s] that they get it done they are hitting
[4493.12s] on all cylinders and they&#39;re deliv in on
[4495.48s] what they said they were going to do
[4496.52s] from the moment he came in in that first
[4498.04s] quarter with the conference call which
[4499.8s] has really been amazing because you
[4501.04s] really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re dealing
[4502.08s] with when you just come in and the fact
[4504.0s] that he did know what he was dealing
[4505.32s] with and he put together the plan and
[4506.76s] he&#39;s been executing it and getting that
[4508.679s] European platform that works so well
[4510.44s] into the US and and implementing it
[4512.56s] across Brands and having collaboration
[4514.84s] across Brands is a big deal so uh what
[4518.44s] we&#39;ve done key account Partnerships
[4520.12s] cross brand execution segmentation and
[4522.8s] elevation what we&#39;re seeing growth in
[4524.48s] share capture quality of growth and
[4526.239s] inventory Health
[4527.96s] finally
[4530.4s] um and uh you can see at their Peak they
[4533.76s] were at 55% gross margin and 133%
[4536.92s] operating Mar margin their first test is
[4539.28s] to get back to 10% operating margin and
[4542.8s] 55% gross margin and then they&#39;ll grow
[4545.04s] for here quality
[4547.0s] growth we don&#39;t believe in high leverage
[4549.239s] we&#39;ll continue to reinvent ourselves to
[4551.04s] get back to that 10% reduce Leverage
[4555.04s] we are here for growth and to see an
[4556.44s] acceleration of Revenue Trend uh reduce
[4559.0s] leverage and build a sustainable
[4560.199s] long-term shareholder value reinvented
[4562.28s] grow uh fear and greed is kind of in the
[4564.32s] middle of the pack it probably came in a
[4565.92s] bit more today uh National Association
[4569.0s] of active investment managers dropped a
[4570.96s] little bit but let&#39;s see how much fear
[4573.32s] came into the market today my guess is
[4575.08s] not as much as you would
[4578.719s] hope uh all right so it dropped into the
[4580.88s] fear Zone at 44 down from 58 so that&#39;s a
[4584.28s] move in the right Direction uh defense
[4586.44s] and arrow space earnings top 30 weights
[4589.6s] uh estimates were down
[4592.0s] 2.03 probably some of that has to do
[4594.76s] with
[4596.56s] Boeing yeah and then once that strike
[4598.88s] gets resolved those estimates will start
[4600.52s] to go up overtime energy earnings we saw
[4603.4s] before that&#39;s going to be the worst
[4604.679s] sector down by 14.89%
[4608.48s] wow uh which companies are getting
[4611.36s] shellacked here Murphy
[4616.08s] CT looks like the smaller play
[4620.0s] players uh Fang that&#39;s Diamond Back
[4624.8s] ocidental big getting
[4627.76s] hit
[4630.48s] Bolero the
[4632.4s] refiners Philip
[4636.44s] 66 Chevron yeah so they&#39;re all down a
[4639.4s] lot kico
[4641.12s] Phillips okay uh economic data we went
[4644.52s] through of that earnings continue to
[4647.08s] come down I think we&#39;re going to see
[4648.36s] these estimates go back up after the
[4649.84s] fourth quarter but keeping an eye down
[4651.679s] from 7 278 to
[4654.96s] 275 uh and now we&#39;re going to get to our
[4658.04s] ask me anything questions so for those
[4659.76s] of you who don&#39;t stick around for the
[4661.679s] ask me anything thanks for tuning in
[4663.0s] we&#39;ll be back next week for those of you
[4664.96s] who love the ask me anything questions
[4666.76s] here we go we got a lot of them this
[4668.44s] week Kyle M hey Tom I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll cover
[4671.159s] it in depth next week but any initial
[4672.719s] thoughts on Cooper standard earnings and
[4674.32s] guidance
[4675.719s] um I hope they do terribly so I can buy
[4678.92s] more stock how&#39;s that uh I don&#39;t know I
[4683.239s] I mean I I don&#39;t
[4685.84s] really spend a lot of time guessing what
[4688.32s] they&#39;re going to do on a quarter by
[4689.44s] quter basis all I watch is incentives
[4692.4s] and and SAR North North American SAR so
[4695.0s] Ford is implying that the SAR is going
[4697.12s] to be a little stronger than everyone
[4698.44s] else thinks if that&#39;s the case Cooper
[4700.84s] standard will do better I mean if the
[4702.28s] volumes come in Cooper standard they&#39;ve
[4704.84s] got that thing run like a lean mean
[4706.4s] fighting machine and if as that SAR gets
[4708.8s] over 158 their cash flow Break Even
[4711.679s] every couple hundred th000 cars they&#39;re
[4713.639s] going to just mint money so um that&#39;s
[4716.159s] how I think about it and if it&#39;s this
[4717.639s] quarter great if it&#39;s not I&#39;ll buy more
[4719.52s] stock and then if it&#39;s next quarter I&#39;ll
[4721.679s] just have more stock when it goes back
[4723.4s] to 25 and Beyond Paul
[4726.44s] aasta hey Tom thanks for the information
[4728.6s] you provide I&#39;ve told a bunch of friends
[4730.44s] and family about your channel but most
[4731.8s] are a bunch of bums and don&#39;t invest in
[4733.719s] all well
[4735.6s] Paul I would just suggest you become who
[4737.76s] you hang around so um you know glad
[4742.44s] you&#39;re with us and uh and hopefully you
[4744.4s] can get some some great uh uh other PE
[4747.76s] like-minded people around you in your
[4749.199s] life that&#39;ll help you in your journey uh
[4751.92s] to improve uh but I do am grateful that
[4755.36s] you&#39;re recommending it with your friends
[4756.56s] and family because that&#39;s how we grow
[4758.8s] and for all of you who are not clients
[4760.96s] yet um uh the best way you can uh
[4767.0s] contribute and make sure that we
[4768.28s] continue to provide this uh for
[4769.8s] non-clients uh for for a long time to
[4772.44s] come is share it because the bigger it
[4774.239s] grows the more incentivized we are to
[4776.88s] continue to put this out on a regular
[4778.84s] basis for
[4780.04s] non-clients uh my question if you
[4782.56s] haven&#39;t commented any initial thoughts
[4784.92s] on Cooper standard well okay it sounds
[4786.679s] like everyone has the same question um
[4789.8s] yeah same same answer hi Tom I know you
[4792.159s] said before you wouldn&#39;t consider Nike
[4793.76s] since you have enough China exposure
[4795.04s] through Alibaba and Goose what price
[4797.08s] would you say it&#39;s undervalued I mean I
[4799.04s] would look at it here I think it&#39;s
[4801.639s] okay
[4805.719s] um you&#39;re never going to get the exact
[4808.0s] bottom and the market doesn&#39;t care where
[4809.6s] I think it&#39;s
[4810.84s] undervalued
[4814.719s] um but uh but yeah I I would I would be
[4817.76s] a buyer at these levels I think let me
[4819.36s] just take a look
[4828.4s] yeah this one&#39;s probably going to be
[4829.679s] fine so that&#39;s on the short
[4833.239s] list okay next Este louder we covered
[4840.12s] already Paul
[4845.56s] Davies curious why you think Canadian
[4848.96s] dollar we covered all that uh let&#39;s go
[4852.48s] on to Nova Nordisk
[4856.52s] uh this is from Paul
[4859.92s] Davies okay I was wondering why he was
[4862.679s] coming to me with Novo Nordisk he is a
[4865.56s] new listener so I want to welcome him in
[4869.52s] uh he is recommending a stock that&#39;s up
[4871.48s] 10x and has corrected 20% in Nova nordis
[4876.199s] I would say pass um there&#39;s a lot of
[4879.56s] competition coming into the glp1 phase
[4883.04s] which we talked about last year when we
[4884.84s] were getting pessimistic on uh not last
[4888.12s] year last this summer when we were
[4890.679s] getting pessimistic on um Eli Lily and
[4895.12s] we went on Yahoo in that segment where
[4897.96s] they make you talk about one stock you
[4899.96s] like and one stock you would uh not want
[4902.92s] to be buying and uh so it&#39;s come down
[4905.4s] from 972 to 829 over the last couple
[4910.0s] months I think you&#39;re going to see more
[4911.12s] and more price competition so for me no
[4913.76s] as great as Novo nordex has been in the
[4915.92s] rearview mirror I&#39;m not a fan
[4918.88s] prospectively um Landon asked about s
[4922.679s] ladder I think it&#39;s getting cheap enough
[4924.36s] here to put a starter position and then
[4927.56s] if it goes lower by more uh Drew same
[4930.56s] story
[4932.08s] on Estee louder willhelm same story
[4935.719s] Estee
[4936.719s] louder uh Tim is asking which options we
[4940.719s] buy for Alibaba that&#39;s for my client&#39;s
[4943.84s] benefit but but they&#39;re are long long
[4947.04s] dated uh Matt in North Carolina very
[4950.0s] grateful for your
[4951.96s] advice
[4955.0s] uh okay so he&#39;s asking about Advanced
[4957.84s] Auto Parts Advanced Auto Parts has done
[4959.96s] everything that they said they were
[4961.36s] going to do uh so no change there we we
[4964.76s] at we top up a few shares every day that
[4966.679s] is weak um same thing with uh Goose no
[4970.32s] change there so far both companies have
[4972.639s] executed on everything they said they
[4973.96s] were going to execute since we got
[4975.32s] involved with the turnaround uh and the
[4977.8s] Market&#39;s just not ready look a Advance
[4980.32s] Auto told you that the next two quarters
[4982.04s] were going to be soft uh is that all
[4984.32s] priced in yet I don&#39;t know could go
[4986.199s] lower before it goes higher but you&#39;re
[4987.4s] moving into a period where all of the
[4989.12s] leverage small caps start to run so if
[4991.88s] it&#39;s not an egregious quarter and Shane
[4993.88s] o Kelly who has a history of winning
[4995.52s] with Home Depot Supply and we&#39;re betting
[4997.159s] on the jockey here turning around the
[4999.199s] supply chain rebuilding the
[5000.76s] relationships with the professionals I
[5002.76s] think it&#39;ll be okay there hasn&#39;t been an
[5004.48s] aut part supplier that&#39;s had a great
[5005.92s] quarter this quarter so it&#39;s probably
[5007.36s] not going to be fantastic but I look
[5009.8s] through and if you look at you know it&#39;s
[5012.4s] funny I remember when meta
[5018.0s] fell and I think we said at
[5024.199s] like yeah it was around uh
[5028.76s] 150 uh that we started saying it looked
[5031.12s] very
[5031.92s] interesting uh and we did nothing with
[5034.199s] it and we wound up buying Google and
[5035.76s] Amazon and made a ton of money on those
[5038.6s] um but it dropped you know at 150 it
[5041.4s] made sense on every economic metric just
[5043.719s] like uh Estee louder makes sense at $70
[5047.36s] doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t go to $50 before
[5049.08s] it goes back to 200 so that&#39;s something
[5052.0s] you have to keep in mind to get the
[5053.08s] benefits of multi Baggers you got to
[5054.44s] deal with the short-term volatility
[5055.84s] which is why you use low to no leverage
[5057.6s] you know what you own uh and you stay on
[5060.04s] top of it you know it&#39;s
[5062.8s] interesting uh in the article of the
[5065.52s] week I go into extensive detail which is
[5068.4s] like I don&#39;t know 10% of what I do on a
[5070.8s] company if that um but it just gives you
[5074.199s] an idea like a starter point where to
[5076.28s] start to do stuff and I go into a
[5078.4s] tremendous amount of detail and it takes
[5079.8s] a tremendous amount of time and I do it
[5081.76s] because I&#39;m responsible for my client&#39;s
[5083.48s] money and generating returns over time
[5085.36s] so you get the benefit secondarily of
[5087.88s] that work my my clients get the benefit
[5090.08s] primarily from that work but I did
[5092.679s] notice that um
[5095.719s] a lot of people didn&#39;t even get through
[5098.119s] all this stuff because they&#39;re just
[5099.679s] looking for the quick cookie that they
[5101.4s] can eat and get their sugar high rather
[5103.239s] than doing work and that&#39;s a guaranteed
[5105.28s] formula to continually lose in life uh
[5108.04s] taking the shortcuts and the way I could
[5109.96s] tell that was based on how many people
[5112.04s] had viewed the article versus how many
[5115.44s] people had listened to the full
[5119.239s] interview with Brack and Daryl uh and it
[5122.76s] was like
[5126.6s] I want to say 100 to one so what it just
[5129.48s] tells me is is that the vast majority of
[5132.76s] participants were not detail oriented
[5135.159s] enough to take five minutes but they&#39;re
[5138.719s] willing to you know maybe willing to put
[5140.88s] their their money on that so for those
[5144.239s] of you who are kind of like
[5145.48s] do-it-yourselfers just note that you
[5148.6s] can&#39;t expect to get great results
[5151.119s] without a massive investment of time and
[5153.36s] understanding and that&#39;s why
[5155.159s] consistently on average the retail
[5156.639s] person gets shaken out at the bottom and
[5158.32s] they buy the top and they&#39;re chasing
[5159.76s] gold right now and they were chasing
[5162.159s] Invidia in the summer before it
[5163.96s] corrected
[5165.0s] 30% uh from June through through
[5168.239s] September um so
[5171.32s] look what we try to do here is just give
[5174.159s] you a durable repeatable starter point
[5177.52s] for a framework that you can apply over
[5180.28s] time and if you eat sleep and breede
[5182.28s] this you will you can do fantastic FC
[5184.679s] over time uh being patient and that&#39;s
[5188.239s] that&#39;s really the name of the game
[5189.6s] buying quality knowing what you own and
[5191.56s] playing the time Arbitrage game uh jts
[5194.04s] what are your thoughts on buying TLT
[5195.8s] here um either as a short-term tactical
[5199.119s] trade or longer term holding as part of
[5200.52s] fixed income allocation I think it&#39;s
[5202.719s] great I think we got a nice little
[5204.159s] pullback and I think we&#39;re ready to to
[5205.92s] flip the switch here uh Kyle philippo
[5209.96s] Vic says I know you said before you
[5212.199s] wouldn&#39;t consider uh I think think you
[5214.44s] just sent me the same question twice if
[5216.36s] that&#39;s not the same person uh What uh
[5220.04s] blah blah blah do you see the dollar
[5221.44s] reversing anytime soon yes we covered
[5223.56s] that
[5224.36s] Sagar can
[5226.92s] kanakia uh asking about Capri which is
[5229.92s] the owner of
[5233.76s] Kors Versace Etc let&#39;s take a look at
[5240.92s] Capri
[5242.76s] CP r
[5262.56s] all right so they you know the stock is
[5264.84s] following their cash flow which has been
[5267.44s] not good their gross margins but not
[5269.52s] good uh I would have to understand these
[5272.32s] Brands better I mean it has come down a
[5274.36s] decent
[5275.48s] amount um let&#39;s take a look at the
[5278.119s] balance sheet do a little bit
[5280.04s] of see if they&#39;re going to be a round to
[5282.32s] turn
[5290.719s] around so they got 200 million of
[5294.08s] cash let me make this a little bit
[5296.36s] smaller
[5302.239s] here 200 million of C and they
[5306.239s] have
[5309.4s] 1.2 billion of
[5327.76s] debt so a little bit lever there
[5341.08s] see still generating
[5362.52s] cash yeah I mean issue is is their sales
[5366.04s] are still below pre pandemic
[5368.36s] levels um I think this one is worth
[5372.08s] starting to do work but you&#39;re going to
[5373.48s] have to do a lot of work because it just
[5374.88s] seems like it&#39;s
[5376.32s] been uh a nonproductive asset for many
[5379.6s] many years I mean you&#39;re you&#39;re
[5381.92s] basically it&#39;s been in kind of a
[5384.0s] downtrend never really catches up it
[5386.199s] seems like based on how the stock has
[5389.28s] acted over the that last decade it just
[5391.56s] appears to have consistently poor
[5393.48s] management and capital allocation so it
[5396.239s] just gives me pause that it&#39;s never
[5397.88s] really had a good run um so I&#39;d just be
[5400.639s] worried about that cigar I think your
[5403.52s] framework is close but I I think for me
[5406.4s] this one is probably a
[5408.04s] pass um even though it could work as a
[5410.36s] trade uh would you mind revisiting Sofi
[5412.84s] I David I have zero interest in Sofi so
[5415.48s] uh no I would mind it I appreciate you
[5417.6s] listening but it&#39;s not a stock for me
[5420.239s] and when I reemphasize that certain
[5422.0s] stocks are not for me uh there&#39;s a
[5424.119s] reason for it uh Michael
[5426.32s] heidenrich uh enjoying the podcast and
[5428.76s] appreciate the useful information from
[5430.679s] week to
[5431.76s] week uh
[5436.239s] NTR okay NTR that&#39;s from Michael heyen
[5441.0s] Rick all
[5443.32s] right
[5450.32s] NTR okay
[5460.76s] all right so the stock has come down
[5462.159s] with cash flow and revenues this looks
[5463.92s] like a lot of the a
[5477.4s] stocks you know here here&#39;s another one
[5479.92s] though that&#39;s literally done nothing for
[5483.159s] 1520
[5484.92s] years
[5485.95s] [Music]
[5489.199s] um let&#39;s just understand
[5498.159s] why is this a fertilizer company yeah
[5502.04s] these companies even Mosaic I keep
[5503.96s] looking
[5505.92s] at and Bungie was one they just never
[5509.4s] get runs they&#39;re just like these
[5511.199s] companies that keep per picking their
[5513.199s] head up and get smashed down like a
[5515.8s] whack-a-mole so it&#39;s not a good enough
[5518.119s] quality business it&#39;s too cyclical and
[5520.28s] unpredictable uh but I definitely see
[5522.36s] why you chose it and it probably works
[5524.28s] for a trade but uh it&#39;s not something I
[5526.28s] want to have capital in for multiple
[5528.239s] Years also in order to take advantage of
[5530.8s] the biotech Secor do you recommend ETFs
[5533.119s] xbi are there better Expressions to
[5534.96s] consider uh I like xbi because you can&#39;t
[5537.28s] really predict when things are going to
[5538.639s] get approved so you get a basket of them
[5540.28s] when the sector&#39;s out of favor and then
[5542.76s] rates go down and you make a ton of
[5544.32s] money so uh we still have a material
[5546.679s] position and uh it&#39;s halfway there and
[5549.44s] it&#39;s going to go another double I think
[5551.6s] not not a double but from where it I&#39;ll
[5555.679s] just pull it
[5558.52s] up
[5562.119s] xbi yeah so you had this huge draw down
[5565.28s] in
[5566.56s] 2022 and then it rallied and we thought
[5569.0s] we were Geniuses and then it went back
[5570.679s] and tested it and now it&#39;s breaking out
[5573.44s] uh and we think it&#39;s going to you know
[5574.719s] work its way higher up to 120 140 and
[5577.639s] then we&#39;ll see what the world looks like
[5579.679s] there and maybe it pushes back to New
[5581.4s] highs over the next couple of years so
[5583.199s] uh so we like this it&#39;s moved a lot
[5585.08s] we&#39;re grateful for that but we do think
[5587.28s] that there&#39;s a lot more left in this
[5588.92s] investment so we&#39;re pretty excited about
[5590.719s] that thanks Bob Allan bod uh thanks turn
[5594.159s] around Tom for sharing your wisdom with
[5596.52s] us on the
[5597.639s] weekly although this is an a turnaround
[5600.0s] have you looked at Universal Music Group
[5603.08s] uh
[5604.76s] Bill Amman has a five billion position
[5607.199s] and it&#39;s currently his largest position
[5613.0s] uh I have looked at this I don&#39;t like
[5617.199s] it
[5622.679s] um now Universal Music
[5627.239s] Group let me put it in here
[5665.52s] yeah
[5669.36s] um yeah this is not the type of business
[5671.84s] I do so I&#39;ll just leave it there um not
[5674.48s] for
[5676.44s] me all
[5678.159s] right eron
[5681.52s] hoaa thanks for the job you do question
[5686.159s] i h u um important for US based on your
[5690.96s] experience if you want to share three
[5692.8s] best books You&#39; read
[5694.6s] recommend that we read I recommend the
[5696.84s] same thing to everyone that&#39;s just
[5698.119s] starting out read uh intelligent
[5700.08s] investor by Benjamin Graham if that
[5702.239s] light bulb goes off read security
[5704.32s] analysis and if the light bulb goes off
[5707.08s] read
[5708.04s] every annual letter that Warren
[5710.28s] Buffett&#39;s ever written since his
[5711.639s] partnership days in the 50s uh follow
[5714.159s] through through Burkshire hathway you
[5716.56s] can get most of those on his website and
[5718.8s] the rest you can just Google search for
[5721.239s] uh margin of safety by Seth claran is
[5723.28s] pretty good
[5724.52s] as well uh are you able to talk about K
[5727.28s] well we&#39;ve owned it for a long time so
[5729.8s] uh I don&#39;t know what is uh not to talk
[5733.36s] about but um this was one of our our big
[5737.36s] Buys in um
[5740.8s] 2023 and we continue to hold and we
[5743.119s] think this will work to new highs
[5745.199s] valario
[5746.24s] [Music]
[5749.4s] pomon do you have any thoughts about new
[5751.639s] Fortress energy no
[5765.76s] let&#39;s take a quick look at it but my
[5769.199s] instinct is stay away yeah cash flow
[5772.0s] continues to
[5775.96s] burn um
[5799.32s] so they have 7.4 billion of
[5802.119s] debt with 133 million of
[5807.4s] cash uh that&#39;s your problem right there
[5809.719s] my friend this is has a super high
[5812.719s] probability of be K unless they start
[5814.44s] selling off assets very quickly uh so
[5817.119s] for me it&#39;s a pass it looks like it was
[5818.639s] a promote not interested
[5821.7s] [Music]
[5824.76s] jackz glad to see Bob is started to
[5829.96s] move excited to see what CCP comes out
[5832.719s] during the national people&#39;s Congress in
[5834.159s] early November my sources are saying
[5835.8s] fiscal stimulus will be a percentage of
[5837.679s] Chinese GDP which will be the largest
[5840.199s] ever but we&#39;ll see my question for you
[5842.239s] this week is cor Sarah uh someone asked
[5844.52s] about corsera I don&#39;t like those type of
[5846.719s] businesses so I&#39;m going to
[5848.679s] pass um and clear secure you we&#39;ve
[5851.88s] covered those in recent weeks both of
[5853.48s] those are passes for me um I have no
[5856.56s] interest in
[5859.28s] those and uh
[5863.0s] you yeah it doesn&#39;t mean they they won&#39;t
[5865.8s] work for trades but we&#39;re not going to
[5867.119s] be involved in that stuff uh and that&#39;s
[5869.599s] it so we&#39;ll be back next week same time
[5872.28s] same place thanks for tuning in in in
