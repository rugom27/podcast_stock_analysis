  "cleaned_transcript": "### MISCELLANEOUS\nleaving that aside uh\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving along  uh we want to get down to the charts of the week we&#39;ve got a tremendous amount of stuff to cover here um first off the misery index which is the year-over-year CPI plus the unemployment rate is approaching low levels that we haven&#39;t seen since the bull market in 2014 through 2019 and the late 90s um this is interesting the chips act could cover nearly half of all Factory costs so you can see here the breakdown of Intel getting the most money this was a bipartisan bill that will be followed through we&#39;re going to talk about Intel there after uh ours earnings were pretty phenomenal uh or at least a step in the right direction so they got eight billion of Grants uh another two M billion from military grants and contracts another looks like about 10 10 billion of loans and then uh tax credits of about 25 billion so they&#39;re uh and they haven&#39;t they haven&#39;t got one red Penny of this yet so they&#39;re going to start seeing this come in which is going to help them they&#39;ve started to turn the ship on their own and then when you get this uh rocket fuel in the jet they&#39;re going to rock and roll now uh 1976 to to 2023 S&P 500 seasonality you normally get this kind kind of weakness right before the election like we&#39;re seeing uh October broke the six Monon winning streak for the S&P 500 the month close negative you should expect that at the end of October this is the dark blue line for presidential election year and then right after the election uh you tend to get an awful lot of strength in November and December uh even in non-presidential years but certainly in presidential years so uh that&#39;s an opportunity and so on uh this is from Mike zardi Regional Banks surged 15% and 177% in the previous two election months meaning November of 2020 and November of 2020 2016 those are huge moves that&#39;s also consistent with what we&#39;ve been saying that small caps do well in November and December uh so so uh Banks K will be a big beneficiary of that as well some data here the GDP growth rate still at 2.8 so all those calling for the recession uh didn&#39;t actually get it because we we have the growth still coming in pretty aggressively uh inflation continues to come down core pce came in at 2.2 today real consumer spending was up 3.7% so the consumer is strong and confident uh intentions to purchase automobiles in October uh was the highest level going all the way back to pre pandemic for the first time ever that is pretty exciting and we&#39;ll see the jobs report tomorrow to determine whether we the 96% chance of a 25 basis point cut in November is accurate uh but one thing that one of the listeners forwarded over the week was from the Ford earnings call that they were talking about an an estimate for AAR that is much higher than Cooper standard is calling for by the way it&#39;s my great mug hedge fund tips remember opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms um so in their earnings call Ford said our outlook for 2024 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAR in both us and Europe our planning assumptions for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units that means production is going to ramp up and the biggest beneficiary will be Cooper standard so that&#39;s pretty exciting to see and that&#39;s from Ford next uh this should shows that uh we had five straight up months and closed a negative month in October which is pretty standard um you can see here the NASDAQ season seasonality as we discussed same story weekend late late October small cap same thing uh and then very very strong small caps tend to be extremely strong from uh November for November and December this is from Seth golden talking about those the election return from October 27th to December 31st for SNP during election years is plus 6.25% when you go down to NASDAQ it&#39;s 7.17% for that basically two months and 3 days and if you go down to small caps you get the highest returns in the shortest amount of time of 7 10.99% which is consistent with the regional Banks which is a big part of small caps\n\ninflation continues to come down core pce came in at 2.2 today real consumer spending was up 3.7% so the consumer is strong and confident uh intentions to purchase automobiles in

that&#39;s from Ford next uh this should shows that uh we had five straight up months and closed a negative month in October which is pretty standard ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nyou can see here the NASDAQ season seasonality as we discussed same story weekend late late October small cap same thing uh and then very very strong small caps tend to be extremely strong from uh November for November and December this is from Seth golden talking about those the election return from October 27th to December 31st for SNP during election years is plus 6.25% when you go down to NASDAQ it&#39;s 7.17% for that basically two months and 3 days and if you go down to small caps you get the highest returns in the shortest amount of time of 7 10.99% which is consistent with the regional Banks which is a big part of small caps\n\nmentions of bottom have skyrocketed so that means earnings are going to aggressively re accelerate and particularly in the unmagnify relative to the Magnificent 7 which we saw in the last few days they continue to overspend and their margins are coming down a bit uh while the rest of the S&P 500 is going up and we&#39;re going to see that in a pronounced way in Q4 and the market is going to start to Discount that right be right after the election certainty clears Dallas fed Manufacturing Index turning up this is consistent with our recovery from the manufacturing depression moving forward and then uh October 2024 new vehicle sales forecast you can see here uh 7.9% year on-year and then a huge rebound from September up 10% so that&#39;s going to be a big deal that should P pull for forward some production for Cooper standard and um that should be a positive uh thing to see global manufacturing PMI is turning off up so that Global manufacturing recession should start to re accelerate uh uh excuse me the recovery should start to re accelerate UK births have falling to the same level as deaths we haven&#39;t seen that since 1976 but yet they&#39;re having their biggest annual growth in population in 74 years so a lot of migration going into the UK that should be constructive for um GDP Etc biggest outflow from China Equity Funds since June of 2015 um this is pretty wild because uh okay I didn&#39;t pull that chart start up so I&#39;m going to have to do it here and here so let&#39;s just use K web as a proxy for China Tech so this was the last time you had an outflow as big as you&#39;ve seen now and then what did you have you had the K web triple uh you probably had Baba triple over the same period yeah 2015 and then it tripled from 55 uh not tripled quadrupled to 207 in the next year and a half so uh Back to the Future ladies and gentlemen uh pretty exciting to see and then speaking of which uh they are having an enormous government meeting to basically determine the size of the stimulus that&#39;s going to come and they&#39;ve had monstrous estimates if Trump gets elected to offset the perceived threats about tariffs speaking about the perceived threats about tariffs I posted this chart over the weekend that got a lot of hits and was misinterpreted by a lot of people but that&#39;s on them um but you know there&#39;s been a lot of fear about Trump getting in and putting tariffs on China and what that will mean for Chinese stocks and what I could say is in 2016 there was a tremendous amount of fear about President Trump getting elected uh and putting tariffs on China and when he got elected he did exactly what he said he was going to do which is he put tariffs on China and what happened to Alibaba over the next uh four first off the the first year and a half while he was in Alibaba uh doubled plus up 150% from 84 to over 200 and change and by the time he was out it was up almost 4X uh from 84 from when he got in to it hit 312 uh during that same period and then when the new Administration came in it collapsed from uh 280 down to 66 and you know a lot of people said well correlation is not causation and uh to that I say no s Sherlock but the point was that the same Euphoria around tariffs proved to be unfounded as it related to the abilities of these companies to earn uh in their countries number one certainly AB Baba a kweb etc um and number two the studies that I&#39;ve read about tariffs is even if he went full boore and did 60% tariff and it wasn&#39;t just a tactic to negotiate with she he actually implemented it it would have a negative impact on Chinese GDP by 1% I I would have thought it would be like 10% uh we overestimate our influence on their uh on their economy and on that basis what they are planning which will come out I think it&#39;s the 5ifth to the eth they&#39;re having the the big meeting uh I guess to see who&#39;s going to be elected so if Trump is elected the stimulus is probably going to be five times bigger than if kamla is elected and meanwhile the policies of kamla would be more deleterious to the Chinese because it&#39;s an ideological type of um kind of creating a cold war versus a pragmatic philosophy of uh ey for an eye if you&#39;re going to tariff us we&#39;re going to tariff you uh but we&#39;re still going to do business and uh and move ahead because we want to make money and we want to create jobs so so this chart I think is very important same frenzy as a matter of fact it&#39;s funny because Baba was in the same type of bottoming process breaking out and then taking a little breather before taking its big run and this is a very similar situation so um I love seeing that I also see it on gold biggest inflow to Gold funds since July of 2020 well the last time you saw that inflow into gold at this level in such a short period of time was early 2020 and what was that it was called a top and it basically uh collapsed about 30% overnight and then or 25% and then continued downward I&#39;m sorry 20% Then continued down 25% and basically never hit that new high for uh three more years after uh correcting 25% it&#39;s not to say this is the exact top I would just say this is not the time to be chasing it biggest outflow from Emerging Market Equity Funds since April of 20 of 2000 rather and if you go back to April of 2000 and you bought Emerging Markets you made one of the quickest doubles in the shortest amount of time in history\n\nthat they cut rates and bond yields are going up and they're going to keep going up and then people are trying to justify it so they come up with this narrative it's because of the high debt or it's because of the Chinese selling bonds or anything else and sometimes it just has to do with the supply in the market that happens every single October and we'll look at the seasonality in a minute because October is the worst month of the year for long bonds I.E prices go down yields go up every single year and then November is the best month of the year for bonds so sell the rumor buy the news you want to be a buyer of bonds into this weakness yields are going to come down over the next two months not up no matter what all the Cassandras tell you uh that's what's going to take place or that's where the odds are relative to what's going to take place University of Michigan inflation expectations collapsing uh US economic surprise index uh skyrocketing uh US dollar this is a counter Trend move again I repeat a counter Trend move it has been grinding sideways here uh after falling and this will start to recover its weakness and the Euro will start to Rally along with all the other currencies over time J Japan and maybe sooner than we expect maybe starting next month when we see bonds rally Japan 30-year government bond yield continues to go up which means the bank of Japan is going to have to continue uh to hike and um that will be very constructive for China very destructive for Japanese equities uh biggest outflow from Emerging Market Equity Funds since April of 20 of 2000 rather and if you go back to April of 2000 and you bought Emerging Markets you made one of the quickest doubles in the shortest amount of time in history uh in basically less than a year nine months you doubled your money sentiment indicator and by the way the biggest weight is still China sentiment indicator is stretched but not insane according to Goldman Sachs\n\ncorrelation of the s&amp; p500 versus the S&amp;P equal weighted index is at record lows not seen since when since 2001 and 2002 the the analog that we continue to point to for all of the ways that we&#39;re positioned to take advantage over the next few years and are starting to see slowing earnings growth for the Magnificent 7 so you want to go where the growth is going to be happening versus the deceleration and we saw that this week in the mag 7 getting smacked today 10-year treasury yields uh this is a counter Trend move even Goldman Sachs agrees with me pointing to a 3.85% Target moving forward down from the 4.2 and change where we are at now I agree hedge fund asset managers turn dollar Bulls on Election risk again this is a counter Trend move it will get resolved in coming months uh and uh the age of population across different countries which is very interesting we&#39;ve been bullish on China we think China&#39;s got a a great run for the next few years and the US why because the bulk of their population is age 34 and you can see it played out in the numbers right here China&#39;s this navy blue line uh and um us is basically uh this red line here right around the exact same age so uh China&#39;s a little bit ahead that&#39;s why I think they&#39;ve got a three to five year run and I think us has another two years I think we&#39;ve got a seven or eight year run uh effectively straight up because of that population advantage and then you look at other countries like uh and Britain is also in that favorable situation uh uh other countries like EU Japan do not have that Advantage they are Beyond The Beneficial years and they&#39;re going to continue to be slow Dallas fed manufactur the advantage that the EU might have over China is that they can import more uh import more people more immigration uh which could help them in terms of population growth and age demographics which could really help them from from a labor force standpoint Dallas manufacturing we covered most positive reactions to beats since Q4 of 2018 so far uh long short Equity Funds very long US Stocks which is uh when they say stocks and equities they&#39;re referring to concentration in the S&amp;P which is effectively mag 7 and when you get that overweight like we saw in late 20 21 what happened Tech got shellacked and we saw indications of that which is why we took off most of those positions in July uh after huge runs and the tail ends uh in in the past couple of months so treasury yields uh versus WTI Crude this Divergence always resolves in 2022 you had the opposite Divergence you had WTI at a peak and treasury yields at a contraction now you have treasury yields way up and uh WTI Crude weigh down I think this resolves I think they&#39;re going to wind up meeting in the middle yields are going to come down meaningfully and energy probably starts to go up us job openings as a matter of fact it&#39;s interesting Trump was talking about helping the oil industry by having OPEC cut barrels which is kind of interesting uh because I guess the energy industry said got got wise to him and said drill baby drill doesn&#39;t help us it may help you it doesn&#39;t help us so uh so maybe there&#39;s a compromise to be had there us job openings again jolts collapsing which gives the employers more pricing power for labor quits rate has gone down people are not quitting their jobs anymore because they can&#39;t name their price across the street and perceived likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months drop to a new low in October hedge funds are very short on green stocks you know I continue to look at some of these solar stocks and um and others because people are so short and uh uh the opposite of what people are expecting people think if Trump gets elected energy stocks go up when he was in last time they did terribly uh green stocks did horribly under Biden people thought they would do well they did better under Trump so I think there might be a pony in this pile I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s EVS or solar probably something in solar um so we continue to look uh maybe the way to play it is the way that we have with the started position in Alam Maro and just kind of deal with the picks and shovels related to these themes um uh that that&#39;s probably the way I&#39;ll wind up playing it but uh US tech stocks have been seeing more frequent fragility events with 2024 currently on track to have nearly the most since 1992 Sigma moves with magnitude greater than three for tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 fragility events are also more extreme in the magnitude for the largest stocks of the S&amp;P currently exhibiting their largest magnitude since 1992 uh so basically they&#39;re saying the mag7 is vulnerable uh based on this uh data that they&#39;re collecting mentions of botom surged which is historically indicated a bottoming of the EPS cycle which we saw uh up further we&#39;ll Co cover that again initial jobless claims uh have come down so that&#39;s something to keep an eye on we&#39;ll see what happens with the jobs report tomorrow we need it to be a little bit weak but not too weak weak enough to keep the FED on track for the November cut although one war is uh based on the election outcome that they might be influenced to act in one way or another um but um but let&#39;s just see the data so far they&#39;ve been data data dependent so let&#39;s hope that continues wanted to show you some seasonality of a few of the names we&#39;ve discussed on the podcast some of which we own for clients and personally uh Cooper standard you can see the best time of the year for Cooper standard stock happens to be the end of the year in November and December uh TLT bonds again last month is the worst month of the year this month November is the best month of the year so we should see some compression in yields uh Regional Bank stocks tend to have their best three months October November December that&#39;s consistent with small caps o uh in November and December have monster months and then biotech is supposed to have a big month in November historically it does uh Advanced Auto Parts does well with small caps in December and uh even Estee louder which got shellacked today uh we&#39;re thinking about making it a sign more meaningful position uh bought some stock today doing some work on on that um you know it&#39;s never been a big position because it&#39;s too correlated to China and Alibaba and we have enough exposure there but I think now it&#39;s a high enough quality business they&#39;ve got the new CEO he&#39;ll probably have one more kitchen syn quarter uh the first quarter that he reports on and then the thing can can start to move and and turn with China um and it may turn quicker which is why we&#39;re opportunistically taking advantage Intel they just reported after the Bell the stock was up big um this is November is the best month of the year they&#39;re up 100% of the time in November so I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through with the after hour um Spike particularly after the election Etsy is a new position that we have not disclosed on the podcast that we entered a couple of weeks ago uh I think our basis is somewhere in the 49s and change uh we&#39;ll probably have another chance to buy it in the 40s but it&#39;s a nice siiz position they had great earnings we&#39;re not going to do anything comprehensive on that yet um but uh just putting that out there uh Seth golden talking about small caps looking good haven&#39;t broken out to new Highs but crawling their way higher we&#39;ve been talking about that for a while uh we have the seasonality here and then the first 10 trading days of November are amongst the best trading days of the year in a presidential election year this is um right here uh so that&#39;s the best 10-day period so we&#39;ll see how that plays out this year weak demand mentions are tracking at the lowest level in two years meaning demand has reacceleration across the S&amp;P 500 components mentions of bottoms which we discussed indicator suggests a 12% year-on-year EPS growth in Q4 versus 10% consensus so Q3 is the pause that refreshes Q4 uh it&#39;s looking like earnings are going to come in even higher than the street is expecting on the basis of this data and then\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstock today doing some work on on that um you know it's never been a big position because it's too correlated to China and Alibaba and we have enough exposure there but I think now it's a high enough quality business they've got the new CEO he'll probably

S&P 500 components mentions of bottoms which we discussed indicator suggests a 12% year-on-year EPS growth in Q4 versus 10% consensus so Q3 is the pause that refreshes Q4 uh it's looking like earnings are going to come in even higher than the street is expecting on the basis of this data and then here is  the mag 7 and 493 are all slowing in Q3 and then reaccelerating in Q4 which we have touched on paused before reacceleration and you can see by sector uh energy is going to be the most negative this quarter also negative next quarter and then starts to re accelerate next year they'll start to discount it uh Industrials negative this quarter then starts to re accelerate meaningfully uh next year and then materials re accelerate starting next quarter so that's like the Alba marals of the world will start to really do well Healthcare should re accelerate week quarter this quarter should start to do a lot better consumer discretionary which we've talked about a lot uh com services and and utilities so uh that's a good road map and then worst inventory destocking cycle is likely behind us which we talked about so you can see here and this is just the beginning of the recovery When You See It move back up to that Baseline like you did in 2003 you had four more years of rally like you did in 2011 you had uh nine more years a rally like you did in 200 uh 2000 and then you had another two years of a rally so uh this is just beginning just re accelerating and you can see it in the Korean exports are still strong and the rail Freight card loads continue to rise software lagged semis by the biggest spread over the past two years except during the tech bubble uh so that's a a pretty big extreme there to start to pay attention to and we'll start to look at some stuff in soft software um Equity sentiment is getting warmer but not really extreme according to the bull bear indicator at uh Bank of America and then quarterly Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20 years which is exactly what we saw in 2001 and 2002 before the 3 to four year run which had china Emerging Markets small caps and value dramatically outperformed the rest of the market while Tech had uh subdued returns to put it mildly uh Equity weighted S&P 500 inflected higher versus cap weighted post June CPI report and that has persisted that's just the beginning of the game not the end of the game then we've got our sler stuff from\n\nenergy is going to be the most negative this quarter also negative next quarter and then starts to re accelerate next year they&#39;ll start to discount it

4.3 and now we&#39;re bouncing off that resistance at the 61.8% level for those of you who care about Fibonacci levels uh we are not really one of them but we we pay attention to what other people are paying attention to and that&#39;s called Game Theory um then the S&P 500 uh so you know you had this cup and handle it broke out it wouldn&#39;t be unexpected for it to go back and test the breakout level of 5669 on the S&P 500 not saying it will but saying I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we had that and that would probably be make a lot of sense mostly pre-election or if the election decision gets dragged out a few days in that uncertain period uh that&#39;s the kind of thing you could see semiconductors have been weak trying to get off the mat we&#39;ll see if uh November is seasonally a very strong period for semiconductors maybe Intel can play a role in leading some of them out of the woods uh S&P we covered NASDAQ we covered gold price this is at the 261.5 Bacci extension level uh which kind of confirms what we&#39;re saying you&#39;re probably at a top not a not a not a bottom for sure uh copper is kind of just consolidating looks exactly like the H hang say they call it Dr copper because it talks about the global economy which darts in China demand and the hangsang you had this huge rally up as we all know and now that it&#39;s checking back uh people are getting nervous they&#39;ve all forgot about what teer said uh God willing we get a pullback I&#39;m going to double down again and break my position limits and add more and we added back all of the option premium on Baba uh when um uh baba got back to 95 96 97 Range so we&#39;re reset uh for another year plus plus and uh and pretty excited about the opportunity that was served up Trend and cycle technical weekly chartbook uh see if there&#39;s anything new here from SL ler over at\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nRBC  thanks to my buddy over there uh and as you can see it looks like we topped out

opportunity that was served up Trend and cycle technical weekly chartbook uh see if there&#39;s anything new here from SL ler over at\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nRBC  again just talking about that check back here to the 5600 and change level as a possibility um not saying it will happen just saying I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it did happen midcaps have been consolidating for a few months they could they shall should break higher here towards the end of the year along with small caps I think small caps break out in the next two months this is a large cup and handle uh so the implied measured move would be from 1,000 to 4700 so 400 points his FIB level has you at 1,700 my measured move would have you at 1,800 but the name of the game is earnings are going to re accelerate and support all this nonsense Voodoo about lines and charts but it just helps to zoom out and take a look at these things so you can see where you are here&#39;s the weekly Russell this thing looks beautiful uh to break out meaningfully and continue to go so that&#39;s going to be your best value to price price is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get uh in the market right now and all the impatient bobbleheads on TV that keep saying oh the small cap trade&#39;s not working blah blah blah um just take the stock away from them and they can buy it from you 30% higher uh hangsang index here as pessimistic as everyone is on China when you step back the the name of the game is you have rallies you have consolidations rallies consolidations and this will happen all the way up and

it uh dollar Index again a different view here hit this level of resistance we think it&#39;s going to start to weaken again could it be wrong and it goes to 106 before it goes below 100 sure but I

buy them sure they can go lower I&#39;ve bought stocks at $12 that went to $2 but then they later went to $30 you just don&#39;t know when you can find the bottom that&#39;s from Peter Lynch I too have had that happen uh with uh range resources at 11 went down to one whatever it was 116 or something we brought our basis down to four and change now it&#39;s 30 plus and going to 60 why not on a guess not on Fibonacci nonsense on the B basis of the liquidation value approved and unproved similar situation we&#39;re going to see with com stock resources over the next few years Warren Buffett a market downturn doesn&#39;t bother us it is an opportunity to increase our ownership of great companies with great management at good prices so those of you who have been with us for a while you know we consistently do that over and over and over and um here are some indicators I just want to put on a bulletin board to give you an a where we may be here&#39;s the pmo buy all back down to zero that&#39;s always a good time to buy it&#39;s not quite there yet so maybe we get another day or two of weakness before the election or the election decision same with pmo by SPX this is what you see closer to the bottom than at the top um and then you also see some of these indicators pretty washed out on a daily basis the NASDAQ Advanced decline this is usually when you get bounces so given how oversold we are going into the jobs report it wouldn&#39;t shock me if we got a bounce Tomorrow based on some of these stretch things doesn&#39;t preclude the idea of getting two super stretched days in a row the odds don&#39;t favor it so I would be probably looking more for a bounce than a a crash um and certainly over the next few days if not tomorrow and uh and then you just see some of these great companies that are really beat down none of which we&#39;re buying we are looking at Dow holdings but probably not do anything there because we&#39;d have to sell something else to do it uh Nike someone has a question about that this week I have no problem with Nike at these levels uh it&#39;s just we own Vans and I think there&#39;s higher upside of multibagger in Vans being a certainly a double from our basis uh much lower than here but even a triple plus and Beyond versus Nike getting a double would be very very nice and a triple probably not likely in any reasonable time period but I&#39;m all for doubles over couple two three years I think Nike could do it but I wouldn&#39;t have the level of certainty as having Brack and Daryl uh doing a turnaround situation so that&#39;s why we&#39;ve uh you got to pick and choose um but you know a lot of these companies have come down so you just get a feel of the overall Market looking a lot of this stuff these are things I do on a regular basis daily basis uh here&#39;s a from Bloomberg Intel surges after results spark optimism over turnaround as a matter of fact we are going [Music] to where did I put that okay we&#39;re going to go ahead and play Pat Ginger right before his earnings call a couple of hours ago on CNBC with John Fort here we go Intel stock sharply higher right now in overtime up 12% after reporting results moments ago joining me now in a first on CNBC interview before the conference call is Intel CEO Pat Ginger Pat welcome I didn&#39;t know how investors were going to digest this one not used to seeing a non-gaap uh EPS loss here but this has to do with equipment bought uh covid time frame 10 nanometer that you just couldn&#39;t Lo that you just couldn&#39;t use is this over with this scale of these types of of charges many of them non-cash yeah thanks Chan and always a pleasure to uh chat with you you know and overall I just say we had underlying strength in the business this quarter but we had the one-time charges that were consistent with what we indicated on our last earnie&#39;s call the major restructuring that we have done you know the people actions against the business and as you say these one-time charges for the Intel 7 equipment you know simply put we had too much equipment you know somewhat induced by the covid era expectations of a much larger PC you know business at the time that equipment isn&#39;t useful as we move to the euv nodes Intel 3 intel 18a so we did take this one time uh write off associated with it in addition to the impairment charges which are largely en counting uh uh charges that are affected this quarter but when you look at the underlying business great progress on products on Foundry you know a beat and raise so obviously the markets are responding positively but our view is you know we have a lot of work to do and we had a lot that we got done this quarter so a really solid quarter of execution Give me the give and take between the client business and the data center business client Computing was just about in line slightly less than uh the consensus though I think after AMD investors might have been expecting that data center actually did a little bit better than a lot of analysts were expecting out there what what did you see demand wise yeah overall our client business we made significant adjustments with our customers to lower inventory levels so we go into the rest of the year with a very good inventory position and a very robust uh product line for our client uh business overall you know clearly uh different segments of the market like the desktop products we weren&#39;t quite a strong this quarter but overall we&#39;re on it for the aipc our leadership there very strong launch of lunar Lake our core Ultra product you know that just has really set the world right a tither on just how strong that product is battery life AI performance and on the data center side yeah a little bit better than was forecast in that business and clearly our Zeon 6 product line that is now uh in the market is starting to gain momentum there and our overall position for you know the Zeon as the AI data center CPU of choice has definitely been a positive for that area of the business as well overall very solid product execution quickly I want to go back to something that you just said uh because last quarter you said that you expected Q3 to be tough on inventory but then that would set you up well for uh a bounce or or uplift in Q4 has that worked out as well less well than you expected so far yeah I think overall the PC market maybe slightly smaller right as people are looking at the finish of the year that said you know I think everybody is expecting growth in the overall PC market for next year based on a major Windows refresh AI PC a bit more Global strength China uh economy uh recovery so overall we believe we&#39;re very well set up for Q4 and for next year in the level of inventory and our product portfolio with our customers okay now I&#39;m always asking about it tell me about gudy 3 I believe that was launching in Q3 you&#39;ve touted that it delivers 2x performance ments per dollar on inference and training versus h100 that said you are selling it for less of course and uh Nvidia does have Blackwell out how does the reception look for that product now long awaited as you&#39;re launching it yeah gouty 3 strong product and uh the efforts in having a strong you know set of use cases you&#39;ve seen that we announc with the IBM they&#39;re gouty 3 in the IBM AI Cloud we&#39;re getting good reception for from that and early Market uptake is very strong for gy 3 and we&#39;re really focusing on what I&#39;ll call the enterprise TCO inferencing Centric use cases where Zeon plus gouty really deliver a compelling offering for Enterprises who you know really are now saying oh that high-end AI cloud training is great how do I use it or how do I inference with it and that&#39;s where we&#39;re seeing our strength on both Zeon and gouty and we&#39;re back and then want to get to some of these here and we&#39;ll go into Intel more detailed probably next week uh Jim Kramer says to buy Stanley Black and&amp; Deckers post earnings plunge aggressively it&#39;s not a plunge it&#39;s up from whatever it&#39;s up $70 or uh let&#39;s see Stanley Black and&amp; Decker they&#39;re doing everything they said they&#39;re going to do top Line&#39;s still a little soft but they&#39;ve taken the costs out um so all that operating leverage will kick in as rates continue to come down and Rehab jobs come up yeah from 65 to 92 so it plunged from 110 but it&#39;s you know all these things are relative especially when it&#39;s going to 200 plus and we&#39;ve been in this one and we&#39;ll continue to be in this one and if it did get an eight handle on it uh we could be able to buy it for new people which would be awesome but um it&#39;s not there yet uh um inel oh Boeing great news after work uh Boeing reaches new deal with Union in hopes of ending strike this was right after the close and uh so they&#39;re going to vote it on it on Monday it&#39;s no coincidence they&#39;re going to vote on it Monday right before the election because they may quickly be um faced with a an Administration that is less favorable towards uh union strikes particularly when it relates to holding up defense projects for the uh Department of Defense so I think that um they&#39;re going to vote Yes on Monday that&#39;s going to be a great thing for the stock they&#39;re they&#39;ve raised sufficient capital and then they can go back to generating a ton of cash and um we&#39;re excited about that Etsy beats quarterly estimates for gross merchandise sales board approves a billion share repurchase and this is a relatively small company so a billion dollar share repurchase moves the needle um their revenues came in much higher than expected 2.92 versus 2.89 uh I&#39;m sorry quarterly Revenue came in at um uh 662 versus 652 estimates and there was a lot to dig into there so that&#39;s a very positive Niche moded business specialized business gift giving does very well in November December uh so we&#39;ll probably get a bounce out of that and then uh decide how meaningfully we want it to be uh in the New Year Estee louder stock drops on disappointing guidance and cut dividend I think at this level you&#39;ve got a margin of safety you know people say wait two or three days after a big plunge but uh I think that that&#39;s going to be more constructive I you know the alternative is you wait to hear the new CEO in their first quarter but at these levels it starts to become uh kind of a giveaway it has your money it has your pant

on the horse with the PayPal app and we have the Vans the new vans that I got uh last week and the company doing incredibly well as it relates to PayPal uh they beat on the bottom line and raised Guidance the revenue Miss was due to intentionally discontinuing brain tree Revenue that was either low margin or no margin business this Wall Street Journal article by telis demos which is also a superlative publication uh summarizes why the stock was red after reporting earnings and why it might see a lot of green in the future so uh as he says PayPal says it is sacrificing some volume growth to focus on the more profitable payment flows the market doesn&#39;t like the look for that for now but investors may come to embrace it if similar moves at other payment players are any guide so what they&#39;ve done is brain free is the non-branded stuff they&#39;ve increased the margin by adding value Services the different checkout we&#39;ve discussed the data business all the other things so they can make it a high margin business the part of the business that they were pushing through there that is low to no margin they&#39;ve just decided we like we&#39;ll just take 80% of your business that&#39;s profitable you can give the no margin business to someone else so the Wall Street Wall Street got upset that revenues didn&#39;t grow as fast but again this is exactly what they did with the unprofitable customers in Latin America you remember when he came came in he just fired them all and now they&#39;re back to Growing profitable customers and they&#39;re back to 432 million he&#39;s doing the same with this side of B with this side of the business and Tellis says um similar shifts in emphasis have been winning moves for shares of other payments players lately including a firm by now pay later provider its Shares are up 149% over the last 12 months Aiden which spooked the markets in 2023 by warning about increase in competition and commoditization in payments likewise shifted focus and has seen its shares jump 128% in the past year so uh this is a proven Playbook Alex Chris will do it better than all these folks have done but in the interim he had total payment volume up 9% net revenues up 6% uh operating income 1.5 billion up 18% operating margin up 18% um uh sorry uh 18.8% up 194 basis points transaction margin dollars up 8% and uh raising their full year non Gap guidance so all of these things are clicking um their teams drove transaction margin dollar growth and brain free because they cut off the unprofitable Revenue started contributing again to margin dollar growth which they hadn&#39;t before um they also ramped up fast lane and improved the Branded experience across the US Partnerships with key players like f serve Aiden Amazon Global Payments and Shopify these are all new Partnerships that have taken on their fast lane because it&#39;s better than anything else and it dramatically improves conversion for everyone so they&#39;re licensing it because they can&#39;t duplicate it and that&#39;s what makes PayPal um just leaving the station uh guidance raised for the full year reflects not only the third quarter outperformance but also a constructive a slightly more constructive view of the fourth quarter compared to what was implied in our last guide in July this is driven by more favorable view of transaction margin dollar growth which we plan to reinvest near-term back into strategic initiatives and marketing that are aimed at driving long-term durable growth I.E some of that&#39;s going into Will Ferrell&#39;s pocket to hop around on horses and tell everyone that he wants to pay from everywhere with all the rewards apps and the venmo and the PayPal app and getting mobile right and this is very much like Facebook in 2016 when everyone said they didn&#39;t get mobile they missed it and then they got it and everything took off PayPal is doing the same thing with payments their mobile game is going to the top shelf from the bottom uh basement floor is where it was when he took over free cash flow from operations one was 1 point6 billion and free cash flow was 1.4 billion uh so they continue to buy back stock they returned 1.8 billion to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 28 million shares of stock this thing is going to continue to generate more and more cash and continue need to shrink the float and one day you&#39;re going to wake up and it&#39;s $130 and then it&#39;s $180 and then it&#39;s $200 and everyone says wow I remember that when that was a $58 stock when uh Tom was talking about it on his podcast I can&#39;t believe it the some of these things are obvious you just have to be patient and you have to be in the game so it&#39;s had this big move from 58 or 60 to 80 now it&#39;s got going to consolidate in the high 70s before making the next move up but uh the key is it&#39;s it&#39;s gotten through the hard stuff and now it&#39;s going to continue to uh raise guidance continue to execute continue to uh build profitable sustainable growth and you can see on a line by line basis everything is moving in the right direction whether it happens too quickly on one metric for the Wall Street cell side or not quickly enough because people can&#39;t wait two or three months does not concern me I have a great company at an unbelievable basis and uh and we&#39;re going to ride this thing um just like will frell on his horse paying from everywhere you can see him in the ad there 1 million new PayPal debit card enrollments since September launch I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up it just everything is humming here TR um active accounts are up monthly active accounts active accounts number of payment transactions up transactions per active account are up 9% so not only are more people using it the people are using it are using it more frequently because they&#39;re giving them more rewards more cash back than anywhere else and um and that stuff starts to multiply geometrically uh I want to go through some of these here uh evolve from a disparate payment products and point Solutions into a powerful Commerce platform as we Shi from payments company to a Commerce platform more of the world&#39;s leading Commerce players have partnered with us to add value for our mutual customers over the past two months we&#39;ve announced Partnerships with f serve 8 addan Amazon Global Payments and Shopify and we&#39;re actively discussing more collaborations in the industry these new and expanded relationships are clear demonstration our brand and Innovations and momentum are resonating uh so that&#39;s that new product experience are resulting on average more than 100 basis points of conversion lift for the vaulted checkout and up to 400 basis points of conversion upli uplift for onetime checkout we&#39;re also seeing a 15 to 20% increase in buy now pay later use so all this stuff ladies and gentlem is staggering how quickly they are ramping it up and getting it adopted um second consecutive quarter in more than two years that brain tree is meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth that came from doing those things that um Street was angry at them for doing which is basically firing non-profitable negative yielding business and only dealing with profitable higher margin business by adding value ad versus being a commodity provider uh the scale of customers who are primed to spend with PayPal puts us way ahead of other guest checkout Solutions and is one of the reasons why so many platforms are choosing to partner with us we can&#39;t wait to get fast lane into the hands of more merchants not only on brain tree and ppcp but also through our Partnerships with f serve addan Global Payments next year moving to small and medium-sized businesses last months we B launch PayPal complete uh oh complete payments in new geographies including China and Hong Kong with more markets on the horizon in 2025 so they&#39;ve just launched in China and Hong Kong ladies and gentlemen that could be very constructive for them in the context of the China recovery the TR China stimulus and the um China uh

only dealing with profitable higher margin business by adding value ad versus being a commodity provider uh the scale of customers who are primed to spend with PayPal puts us way ahead of other guest checkout Solutions and is one of the reasons why so many platforms are choosing to partner with us we can&#39;t wait to get fast lane into the hands of more merchants not only on brain tree and ppcp

it is now coming to fruition with a long exciting Runway ahead those of you know it was up some 27% in two sessions uh right after earnings and uh has stayed above $20 so you can listen to when I was pitching Liz when it was 15 bucks uh a year ago and uh we&#39;re just getting started and now we&#39;re going to listen to Brack and Daryl joined Jim Kramer on CNBC following the earnings call yesterday here&#39;s what he had to sayal quarter from BF Corp the Footwear and apparel power you might know him as Vans North Face Timberlin Dickies many other brands those numbers sent the stock up 27% yesterday tax on another 3% today holy cow as management held an investor event here at the New York Stock sharer I got a chance to sit down with Brack and darl the president and COO of VF Corp whom you remember from when he ran Logitech where you create an insane amount of value can you work the same magic here take a look Brack I was worried about VF until I heard that you were taking the helm I knew you turned around Logitech I know you were not wanted to hear mous guy takes over fashion company but the truth is you made for this job weren&#39;t you you know I I look I&#39;m in I&#39;m in heaven here I mean I&#39;ve got I&#39;m surrounded by amazing iconic Brands and an incredible opportunity to create great products I just love this stuff now in you&#39;re laying things out and today was uh a good layout of the medium term you haven&#39;t laid out the bran yet however you did make it clear in a series of what I regard as very candid comments if we say it we do it what did you say and what have you done well what we what we said was we were going to bring we were going to uh bring down the debt level by by by selling some assets getting inventory control a good one you had to sell that&#39;s right and we and we said we&#39;d sell a brand asset we did so we we said we&#39;d sell some assets we did we sold planes hangers real estate we sold we sold uh Supreme which is a fantastic asset but didn&#39;t strategically belong in the portfolio and we said we&#39;d lower cost we took it down by $300 million so we what we&#39;ve been saying we&#39;ve been doing now that matters because uh one of the things that you have is talking about a compelling value proposition you&#39;re trading significantly off sustained historic High highly lever with a clear path to delever and then I thought this was incredible operating income when you&#39;ve come in historic lows yeah what a what a t is this the O J Stables you got here you know I think anytime you you you&#39;re lucky enough like I&#39;ve been a few times to be brought into a turnaround uh your temptation is to look at the short term and say wow we can flip this really quick uh I&#39;ve learned you know the the real secret to turnarounds is think long term and so the opportunity is to really dramatically improve those operating margins but the cool thing is the really big opportunity for long-term investors and for and the reason I&#39;m\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\naround Logitech I know you were not wanted to hear mous guy takes over fashion company but the truth is you made

the cool thing is the really big opportunity for long-term investors and for and the reason I&#39;m here is\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTimberland boot that you were so excited about Dickies tell how there you go how can I not be excited but I&#39;m going to give you a little thing because my uh parents were from the fashion industry what the hell you doing charging half for everything and when it&#39;s better than the guys who chargeing home I mean I look at I look at the dick Dickies okay work pants 35 bucks and then I go to that carart yours are no yours are same as carart but if they have price is that is that correct I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve got it correct yours are better but but but but to But to answer your question look one of the reasons I came to this company I could have done other things I came here because I didn&#39;t want to be in luxury I wanted to be in products that could sell to everybody you know I grew up in middle I grew up in Kentucky I grew up with a single mom I don&#39;t you know I love I love this world of where you walk in the street and you see people wearing your stuff you don&#39;t have to walk into the the high-end Fashion Mall and so this is my I feel so at home here now uh I do want to just get your impression of my impression I think that you have a brand go to Europe okay I like to go to Europe it&#39;s pretty cool and all I ever see is Northface I see Northface Northface Northface I go to uh to kuram okay the nicest Street in Berlin they&#39;re lining up for Northface and the last probably eight conference calls before you got here I never heard Northface how is that possible you know Northface is a phenomenal brand we&#39;ve really performed well in Europe very well in apack not as well here that&#39;s the reason you didn&#39;t hear about it but but but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll change that so I think at the end of the day we we&#39;re running a different operating model in the rest of the world than we were in the US and that created it made us bureaucratic slow and and not as effective now we&#39;ve changed brought the European operating model into the American that&#39;s what I and we&#39;re going to get our mojo here okay so what do we want to be how much online how much brick and mortar how much Walmart hey which you and I both know is not the Walmart that people think it is is cool as all get out with the big Dickies display how much Costco how much everybody else you know look I I one thing the the the underlying principle of all this is we want to sell where people are buying where people come to shop so we we love the retailers they&#39;re multibrand retailers they&#39;re cuz who&#39;s coming in there when you go in there you&#39;re thinking okay I might want this brand I might want that brand I want this category got to be there got to be there with great product great marketing we also want to be when people are loving Dickies or loving bands or the North Face or Timberland we want to we want them be able to go online and buy or go into one of our stores and buy so we want to be in all those places and let the consumers decide how what the proportion is now I believe uh that you have obviously have to work about markdown management absolutely right positioning of global Brands absolutely right but you&#39;re an inventor I have never seen you come on my show and not have seven new things of which I then got and my life was better including those I still wear you know the the great ear airbuds which is like a little better than somebody else what you got mine what are you thinking what are you thinking well I you know look the the the most oh give us something you&#39;re going to give me something come on give me something the crazy fun thing about this industry is that there&#39;s so many things you can create this is the this in in one year this has become um the number two shoe sold in Vans it&#39;s it&#39;s the called the new school I thought Vans was dead oh Vans is not dead Vans is just Vans is coming out mans is going to be strong now okay so I go into um I I mared dyl and lover Foot Locker and that&#39;s Nike put slap Nike on that and it&#39;s a $250 shoe what are you going for here well you know we&#39;re going to sell you&#39;re going to buy ALB stuff as much as as $129 $149 if you want a really specialized functional shoe we have a lot of upside room actually on price but we&#39;re also going to be Avail me and potatoes price so everybody can buy you know one of the hottest things in styling is high low you your Louis Vuitton bag you were your van shoes you oh my God yes this is I&#39;m I&#39;m quoting Sun Sun who who runs Vans You Who Came From L best ver in the industry hey this is the world we&#39;re in now no I see Bob C with the Air Force Ones and he&#39;s wearing it to I got to call I got to get in touch with Bob he should be wearing Vans or Timberland for sure we&#39;ll we&#39;ll call him after this definitely all right so time frame how much is I mean already You&#39; blown it away I thought that you you&#39;d have to have a year of just of reading and then the stock goes to 12 and then you start the launching pad you&#39;re already at the launching pip what&#39;s next you know this is look as I said at the beginning the one thing I&#39;ve learned is we&#39;re you know to really turn around a business you should be thinking very long term because otherwise everything you do just comes undone so we&#39;re we&#39;re changing almost every variable inside the company and synchronizing it and that&#39;s going to start to click as the years go by and over time will become a Growth Company is it fun it&#39;s incredibly fun discover something new every day among these Brands I I am just having a ball bringing in inventive people turn to have a lot of great people already we&#39;re we&#39;ve got great people inside and we&#39;re bringing great people from the outside well look it is so terrific to see you with an iconic company that I have loved from when it was when it was wam mening in in Pennsylvania where we go and we fight over a pair of jeans at the bottom of a cardboard box remember was the terrific five bucks for a pair of jeans that last for they&#39;re still my closet Brack andow is the presiden of VF Corp I am so thrilled you&#39;re here coming up and we&#39;re back um so effectively they have improved beyond what they had anticipated they would improve in terms of the uh the year on-year declines are now narrowing and they&#39;re going to start to be uh we&#39;re going to start to see year- on-year flats and then we&#39;re going to start to see year year reacceleration and a growth story uh start to happen and and that&#39;s a big thing uh gross margin was up 120 basis points EPS was 52 cents versus - 1116 last year uh net debt is down but they got uh 1.5 billion in from Supreme so it&#39;s going to be down a lot more and uh for Q3 20 fiscal year 2025 expects on a continuing operation basis Revenue in the range of 2.7 to 2.75 billion down 1 to 3% year-over-year in reported dollars so this is really narrowing from double digits down to low single digits and uh and then we see obviously APAC in China was up bigly 6% uh despite what everyone else is saying and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s been positive expanded gross margins they go through all of this stuff new new school is selling out everywhere which we&#39;ve covered uh sold out in five minutes upon the launch in September uh super strong comparison back to school North Face is strong hitting on all cylinders uh greater China continued it strong momentum and let&#39;s see here we&#39;re running long on time uh and then the investor days when the real the stock really took off talked about long-term sustainable profitable growth like he did with Jim Kramer transforming its company performance category adjusted gross margin back up to 55% and how they&#39;re going to do that operating margin back to 10% net leverage 2.5 times or below and then you can see some of the slides from the investor day which came after the earnings day and you can see where growth margin is and where it&#39;s going and how they&#39;re going to get there uh is through reduction of sgna and getting that operating margin back to 10% uh and uh nine Focus work streams in action to drive 500 to $600 million of operating income expansion and they go through the game plan so this is not you know finger in the wind and uh hope hope that they get it done they are hitting on all cylinders and they&#39;re deliv in on what they said they were going to do from the moment he came in in that first quarter with the conference call which has really been amazing because you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re dealing with when you just come in and the fact that he did know what he was dealing with and he put together the plan and he&#39;s been executing it and getting that European platform that works so well into the US and and implementing it across Brands and having collaboration across Brands is a big deal so uh what we&#39;ve done key account Partnerships cross brand execution segmentation and elevation what we&#39;re seeing growth in share capture quality of growth and inventory Health\n\nlse is saying and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s been positive expanded gross margins they go through all of this stuff new new school is selling out everywhere which we&#39;ve covered uh sold out in five minutes upon the launch in September uh super strong comparison back to school

they were at 55% gross margin and 133% operating Mar margin their first test is to get back to 10% operating margin and 55% gross margin and then they&#39;ll grow for here quality growth we don&#39;t believe in high leverage we&#39;ll continue to reinvent ourselves to get back to that 10% reduce Leverage we are here for growth and to see an acceleration of Revenue Trend uh reduce leverage and build a sustainable long-term shareholder value reinvented grow uh fear and greed is kind of in the middle of the pack it probably came in a bit more today uh National Association of active investment managers dropped a little bit but let&#39;s see how much fear came into the market today my guess is not as much as you would hope uh all right so it dropped into the fear Zone at 44 down from 58 so that&#39;s a move in the right Direction uh defense and arrow space earnings top 30 weights uh estimates were down 2.03 probably some of that has to do with Boeing yeah and then once that strike gets resolved those estimates will start to go up overtime energy earnings we saw before that&#39;s going to be the worst sector down by 14.89% wow uh which companies are getting shellacked here Murphy CT looks like the smaller play players uh Fang that&#39;s Diamond Back ocidental big getting hit Bolero the refiners Philip 66 Chevron yeah so they&#39;re all down a lot kico Phillips okay uh economic data we went through of that earnings continue to come down I think we&#39;re going to see these estimates go back up after the fourth quarter but keeping an eye down from 7 278 to 275 uh and now

I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll cover it in depth next week but any initial thoughts on Cooper standard earnings and guidance um I hope they do terribly so I can buy more stock how&#39;s that uh I don&#39;t know I I mean I I don&#39;t really spend a lot of time guessing what they&#39;re going to do on a quarter by quter basis all I watch is incentives and and SAR North North American SAR so Ford is implying that the SAR is going to be a little stronger than everyone else thinks if that&#39;s the case Cooper standard will do better I mean if the volumes come in Cooper standard they&#39;ve got that thing run like a lean mean fighting machine and if as that SAR gets over 158 their cash flow Break Even every couple hundred th000 cars they&#39;re going to just mint money so um that&#39;s how I think about it and if it&#39;s this quarter great if it&#39;s not I&#39;ll buy more stock and then if it&#39;s next quarter I&#39;ll just have more stock when it goes back to 25 and Beyond \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhi Tom I know you said before you wouldn&#39;t consider Nike since you have enough China exposure through Alibaba and Goose what price would you say it&#39;s undervalued I mean I would look at it here I think it&#39;s okay um you&#39;re never going to get the exact bottom and the market doesn&#39;t care where I think it&#39;s undervalued um but uh but yeah I I would I would be a buyer at these levels I think let me just take a look yeah this one&#39;s probably going to be fine so that&#39;s on the short list okay next Este louder we covered already Paul Davies curious why you think Canadian dollar we covered all that uh let&#39;s go on to Nova Nordisk uh this is from Paul Davies okay I was wondering why he was coming to me with Novo Nordisk he is a new listener so I want to welcome him in uh he is recommending a stock that&#39;s up 10x and has corrected 20% in Nova nordis I would say pass um there&#39;s a lot of competition coming into the glp1 phase which we talked about last year when we were getting pessimistic on uh not last year last this summer when we were getting pessimistic on um Eli Lily and we went on Yahoo in that segment where they make you talk about one stock you like and one stock you would uh not want to be buying and uh so it&#39;s come down from 972 to 829 over the last couple months I think you&#39;re going to see more and more price competition so for me no as great as Novo nordex has been in the rearview mirror I&#39;m not a fan prospectively um Landon asked about s ladder I think it&#39;s getting cheap enough here to put a starter position and then if it goes lower by more uh Drew same story on Estee louder willhelm same story Estee louder uh Tim is asking which options we buy for Alibaba that&#39;s for my client&#39;s benefit but but they&#39;re are long long dated uh Matt in North Carolina very grateful for your advice uh okay so he&#39;s asking about Advanced Auto Parts Advanced Auto Parts has done everything that they said they were going to do uh so no change there we we at we top up a few shares every day that is weak um same thing with uh Goose no change there so far both companies have executed on everything they said they were going to execute since we got involved with the turnaround uh and the Market&#39;s just not ready look a Advance Auto told you that the next two quarters were going to be soft uh is that all priced in yet I don&#39;t know could go lower before it goes higher but you&#39;re moving into a period where all of the leverage small caps start to run so if it&#39;s not an egregious quarter and Shane o Kelly who has a history of winning with Home Depot Supply and we&#39;re betting on the jockey here turning around the supply chain rebuilding the relationships with the professionals I think it&#39;ll be okay there hasn&#39;t been an aut part supplier that&#39;s had a great quarter this quarter so it&#39;s probably not going to be fantastic but I look through and if you look at you know it&#39;s funny I remember when meta fell and I think we said at like yeah it was around uh 150 uh that we started saying it looked very interesting uh and we did nothing with it and we wound up buying Google and Amazon and made a ton of money on those um but it dropped you know at 150 it made sense on every economic metric just like uh Estee louder makes sense at $70 doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t go to $50 before it goes back to 200 so that&#39;s something you have to keep in mind to get the benefits of multi Baggers you got to deal with the short-term volatility which is why you use low to no leverage you know what you own uh and you stay on top of it you know it&#39;s interesting uh in the article of the week I go into extensive detail which is like I don&#39;t know 10% of what I do on a company if that um but it just gives you an idea like a starter point where to start to do stuff and I go into a tremendous amount of detail and it takes a tremendous amount of time and I do it because I&#39;m responsible for my client&#39;s money and generating returns over time so you get the benefit secondarily of that work my my clients get the benefit primarily from that work but I did notice that um a lot of people didn&#39;t even get through all this stuff because they&#39;re just looking for the quick cookie that they can eat and get their sugar high rather than doing work and that&#39;s a guaranteed formula to continually lose in life uh taking the shortcuts and the way I could tell that was based on how many people had viewed the article versus how many people had listened to the full interview with Brack and Daryl uh and it was like I want to say 100 to one so what it just tells me is is that the vast majority of participants were not detail oriented enough to take five minutes but they&#39;re willing to you know maybe willing to put their their money on that so for those of you who are kind of like do-it-yourselfers just note that you can&#39;t expect to get great results without a massive investment of time and understanding and that&#39;s why consistently on average the retail person gets shaken out at the bottom and they buy the top and they&#39;re chasing gold right now and they were chasing Invidia in the summer before it corrected 30% uh from June through through September um so look what we try to do\n\nder makes sense at $70 doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t go to $50 before it goes back to 200 so that&#39;s something you have to keep in mind to get the benefits of multi Baggers you got to deal with the short-term volatility which is why you use low to no leverage you know what you own uh and you stay on top of it you know it&#39;s interesting uh in the article of the

retail person gets shaken out at the bottom and they buy the top and they&#39;re chasing gold right now and they were chasing Invidia in the summer before it corrected 30% uh from June through through September um so look what we try to do\n\njts what are your thoughts on buying TLT here um either as a short-term tactical trade or longer term holding as part of fixed income allocation I think it&#39;s great I think we got a nice little pullback and I think we&#39;re ready to to flip the switch here uh Kyle philippo Vic says I know you said before you wouldn&#39;t consider uh I think think you just sent me the same question twice if that&#39s not the same person uh What uh blah blah blah do you see the dollar reversing anytime soon yes we covered that Sagar can kanakia uh asking about Capri which is the owner of Kors Versace Etc let&#39;s take a look at Capri CP r all right so they you know the stock is following their cash flow which has been not good their gross margins but not good uh I would have to understand these Brands better I mean it has come down a decent amount um let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet do a little bit of see if they&#39;re going to be a round to turn around so they got 200 million of cash let me make this a little bit smaller here 200 million of C and they have 1.2 billion of debt so a little bit lever there see still generating cash yeah I mean issue is is their sales are still below pre pandemic levels um I think this one is worth starting to do work but you&#39;re going to have to do a lot of work because it just seems like it&#39;s been uh a nonproductive asset for many many years I mean you&#39;re you&#39re basically it&#39;s been in kind of a downtrend never really catches up it seems like based on how the stock has acted over the that last decade it just appears to have consistently poor management and capital allocation so it just gives me pause that it&#39;s never really had a good run um so I&#39;d just be worried about that cigar I think your framework is close but I I think for me this one is probably a pass um even though it could work as a trade uh would you mind revisiting Sofi I David I have zero interest in Sofi so uh no I would mind it I appreciate you listening but it&#39;s not a stock for me and when I reemphasize that certain stocks are not for me uh there&#39;s a reason for it ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nMichael heidenrich uh enjoying the podcast and appreciate the useful information from week to week uh NTR okay NTR that&#39;s from Michael heyen Rick all right NTR okay all right so the stock has come down with cash flow and revenues this looks like a lot of the a stocks you know here here&#39;s another one though that&#39;s literally done nothing for 1520 years [Music] um let&#39;s just understand why is this a fertilizer company yeah these companies even Mosaic I keep looking at and Bungie was one they just never get runs they&#39;re just like these companies that keep per picking their head up and get smashed down like a whack-a-mole so it&#39;s not a good enough quality business it&#39;s too cyclical and unpredictable uh but I definitely see why you chose it and it probably works for a trade but uh it&#39;s not something I want to have capital in for multiple Years also in order to take advantage of the biotech Secor do you recommend ETFs xbi are there better Expressions to consider uh I like xbi because you can&#39;t really predict when things are going to get approved so you get a basket of them when the sector&#39;s out of favor and then rates go down and you make a ton of money so uh we still have a material position and uh it&#39;s halfway there and it&#39;s going to go another double I think not not a double but from where it I&#39;ll just pull it up xbi yeah so you had this huge draw down in 2022 and then it rallied and we thought we were Geniuses and then it went back and tested it and now it&#39;s breaking out uh and we think it&#39;s going to you know work its way higher up to 120 140 and then we&#39;ll see what the world looks like there and maybe it pushes back to New highs over the next couple of years so uh so we like this it&#39;s moved a lot we&#39;re grateful for that but we do think that there&#39;s a lot more left in this investment so we&#39;re pretty excited about that thanks Bob Allan bod uh thanks turn

    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nleaving that aside uh\n\nthat they cut rates and bond yields are going up and they're going to keep going up and then people are trying to justify it so they come up with this narrative it's because of the high debt or it's because of the Chinese selling bonds or anything else and sometimes it just has to do with the supply in the market that happens every single October and we'll look at the seasonality in a minute because October is the worst month of the year for long bonds I.E prices go down yields go up every single year and then November is the best month of the year for bonds so sell the rumor buy the news you want to be a buyer of bonds into this weakness yields are going to come down over the next two months not up no matter what all the Cassandras tell you uh that's what's going to take place or that's where the odds are relative to what's going to take place University of Michigan inflation expectations collapsing uh US economic surprise index uh skyrocketing uh US dollar this is a counter Trend move again I repeat a counter Trend move it has been grinding sideways here uh after falling and this will start to recover its weakness and the Euro will start to Rally along with all the other currencies over time J Japan and maybe sooner than we expect maybe starting next month when we see bonds rally Japan 30-year government bond yield continues to go up which means the bank of Japan is going to have to continue uh to hike and um that will be very constructive for China very destructive for Japanese equities uh biggest outflow from Emerging Market Equity Funds since April of 20 of 2000 rather and if you go back to April of 2000 and you bought Emerging Markets you made one of the quickest doubles in the shortest amount of time in history uh in basically less than a year nine months you doubled your money sentiment indicator and by the way the biggest weight is still China sentiment indicator is stretched but not insane according to Goldman Sachs\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nstock today doing some work on on that um you know it's never been a big position because it's too correlated to China and Alibaba and we have enough exposure there but I think now it's a high enough quality business they've got the new CEO he'll probably have one more kitchen syn quarter uh the first quarter that he reports on and then the thing can can start to move and and turn with China um and it may turn quicker which is why we're opportunistically taking advantage Intel they just reported after the Bell the stock was up big um this is November is the best month of the year they're up 100% of the time in November so I think we're going to get some follow through with the after hour um Spike particularly after the election Etsy is a new position that we have not disclosed on the podcast that we entered a couple of weeks ago uh I think our basis is somewhere in the 49s and change uh we'll probably have another chance to buy it in the 40s but it's a nice siiz position they had great earnings we're not going to do anything comprehensive on that yet um but uh just putting that out there uh Seth golden talking about small caps looking good haven't broken out to new Highs but crawling their way higher we've been talking about that for a while uh we have the seasonality here and then the first 10 trading days of November are amongst the best trading days of the year in a presidential election year this is um right here uh so that's the best 10-day period so we'll see how that plays out this year weak demand mentions are tracking at the lowest level in two years meaning demand has reacceleration across the S&P 500 components mentions of bottoms which we discussed indicator suggests a 12% year-on-year EPS growth in Q4 versus 10% consensus so Q3 is the pause that refreshes Q4 uh it's looking like earnings are going to come in even higher than the street is expecting on the basis of this data and then here is  the mag 7 and 493 are all slowing in Q3 and then reaccelerating in Q4 which we have touched on paused before reacceleration and you can see by sector uh energy is going to be the most negative this quarter also negative next quarter and then starts to re accelerate next year they'll start to discount it uh Industrials negative this quarter then starts to re accelerate meaningfully uh next year and then materials re accelerate starting next quarter so that's like the Alba marals of the world will start to really do well Healthcare should re accelerate week quarter this quarter should start to do a lot better consumer discretionary which we've talked about a lot uh com services and and utilities so uh that's a good road map and then worst inventory destocking cycle is likely behind us which we talked about so you can see here and this is just the beginning of the recovery When You See It move back up to that Baseline like you did in 2003 you had four more years of rally like you did in 2011 you had uh nine more years a rally like you did in 200 uh 2000 and then you had another two years of a rally so uh this is just beginning just re accelerating and you can see it in the Korean exports are still strong and the rail Freight card loads continue to rise software lagged semis by the biggest spread over the past two years except during the tech bubble uh so that's a a pretty big extreme there to start to pay attention to and we'll start to look at some stuff in soft software um Equity sentiment is getting warmer but not really extreme according to the bull bear indicator at uh Bank of America and then quarterly Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20 years which is exactly what we saw in 2001 and 2002 before the 3 to four year run which had china Emerging Markets small caps and value dramatically outperformed the rest of the market while Tech had uh subdued returns to put it mildly uh Equity weighted S&P 500 inflected higher versus cap weighted post June CPI report and that has persisted that's just the beginning of the game not the end of the game then we've got our sler stuff from\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nRussell this thing looks beautiful uh to break out meaningfully and continue to go so that&#39;s going to be your best value to price price is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get uh in the market right now and all the impatient bobbleheads on TV that keep saying oh the small cap trade&#39;s not working blah blah blah um just take the stock away from them and they can buy it from you 30% higher uh hangsang index here as pessimistic as everyone is on China when you step back the the name of the game is you have rallies you have consolidations rallies consolidations and this will happen all the way up and the idea is to get the disbelievers to buy at the top take them out of their stock at the bottom get them to buy at the top take them out of their stock at the bottom get the them to buy at the top take them out of their stock at the bottom and then they will be the final buyers at uh at the peak uh with all the gold bugs right now 10year yield weekly um he&#39;s saying it&#39;s not really quite yet overbought given but you have this kind of downtrend line of the RSI or whatever nonsense the key is November bonds are going to Rally okay that that&#39;s that&#39;s my view and I&#39;m sticking to it could I be wrong and it goes to 446 before it goes to 385 sure I could be wrong and it does that I wouldn&#39;t bet on it as a matter of fact I would be opportunistically buying TLT not selling it uh dollar Index again a different view here hit this level of resistance we think it&#39;s going to start to weaken again could it be wrong and it goes to 106 before it goes below 100 sure but I wouldn&#39;t bet on it once again Canadian dollar it&#39;s just putting in this base I think it&#39;s going to break through this downtrend line\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally  on the next move up maybe that starts in the next couple of months we need an election Catalyst all the stuff is kind of hanging out and count counter Trend moving and people chasing nonsense and here it looks like gold has a little move further to 2817 if you look at his FIB extension stuff copper uh just consolidating like the Hang saying in China before its next move higher if you want to play on something to break into new highs I&#39;d be selling gold and buying copper there&#39;s your pair trade for the next nine months sell gold buy copper um or sell Fang by China uh similar trade so that&#39;s that and don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything else here Nvidia pressing up against the double top we&#39;ll see if it gets an ex extension you know it&#39;s interesting November is a strong month for semiconductors so maybe it does pop up here um but I&#39;ll leave that to you guys all I know is the odds of Nvidia doubling before uh many of these other stocks doubling are are very low because it would be a fourth of GD GDP but uh I&#39;ll leave that to others to chase the last few pennies uh Apple I think it was down a little bit after hours we&#39;ll see how that plays out any other key companies we want to cover here uh okay all right I think that&#39;s good for now from this oh he&#39;s got a lot of names in here this week okay uh\n\nlse is saying and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s been positive expanded gross margins they go through all of this stuff new new school is selling out everywhere which we&#39;ve covered uh sold out in five minutes upon the launch in September uh super strong comparison back to school North Face is strong hitting on all cylinders uh greater China continued it strong momentum and let&#39;s see here we&#39;re running long on time uh and then the investor days when the real the stock really took off talked about long-term sustainable profitable growth like he did with Jim Kramer transforming its company performance category adjusted gross margin back up to 55% and how they&#39;re going to do that operating margin back to 10% net leverage 2.5 times or below and then you can see some of the slides from the investor day which came after the earnings day and you can see where growth margin is and where it&#39;s going and how they&#39;re going to get there uh is through reduction of sgna and getting that operating margin back to 10% uh and uh nine Focus work streams in action to drive 500 to $600 million of operating income expansion and they go through the game plan so this is not you know finger in the wind and uh hope hope that they get it done they are hitting on all cylinders and they&#39;re deliv in on what they said they were going to do from the moment he came in in that first quarter with the conference call which has really been amazing because you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re dealing with when you just come in and the fact that he did know what he was dealing with and he put together the plan and he&#39;s been executing it and getting that European platform that works so well into the US and and implementing it across Brands and having collaboration across Brands is a big deal so uh what we&#39;ve done key account Partnerships cross brand execution segmentation and elevation what we&#39;re seeing growth in share capture quality of growth and inventory Health\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally  um and uh you can see at their Peak they were at 55% gross margin and 133% operating Mar margin their first test is to get back to 10% operating margin and 55% gross margin and then they&#39;ll grow for here quality growth we don&#39;t believe in high leverage we&#39;ll continue to reinvent ourselves to get back to that 10% reduce Leverage we are here for growth and to see an acceleration of Revenue Trend uh reduce leverage and build a sustainable long-term shareholder value reinvented grow uh fear and greed is kind of in the middle of the pack it probably came in a bit more today uh National Association of active investment managers dropped a little bit but let&#39;s see how much fear came into the market today my guess is not as much as you would hope uh all right so it dropped into the fear Zone at 44 down from 58 so that&#39;s a move in the right Direction uh defense and arrow space earnings top 30 weights uh estimates were down 2.03 probably some of that has to do with Boeing yeah and then once that strike gets resolved those estimates will start to go up overtime energy earnings we saw before that&#39;s going to be the worst sector down by 14.89% wow uh which companies are getting shellacked here Murphy CT looks like the smaller play players uh Fang that&#39;s Diamond Back ocidental big getting hit Bolero the refiners Philip 66 Chevron yeah so they&#39;re all down a lot kico Phillips okay uh economic data we went through of that earnings continue to come down I think we&#39;re going to see these estimates go back up after the fourth quarter but keeping an eye down from 7 278 to 275 uh and now we&#39;re going to get to our",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving along  uh we want to get down to the charts of the week we&#39;ve got a tremendous amount of stuff to cover here um first off the misery index which is the year-over-year CPI plus the unemployment rate is approaching low levels that we haven&#39;t seen since the bull market in 2014 through 2019 and the late 90s um this is interesting the chips act could cover nearly half of all Factory costs so you can see here the breakdown of Intel getting the most money this was a bipartisan bill that will be followed through we&#39;re going to talk about Intel there after uh ours earnings were pretty phenomenal uh or at least a step in the right direction so they got eight billion of Grants uh another two M billion from military grants and contracts another looks like about 10 10 billion of loans and then uh tax credits of about 25 billion so they&#39;re uh and they haven&#39;t they haven&#39;t got one red Penny of this yet so they&#39;re going to start seeing this come in which is going to help them they&#39;ve started to turn the ship on their own and then when you get this uh rocket fuel in the jet they&#39;re going to rock and roll now uh 1976 to to 2023 S&P 500 seasonality you normally get this kind kind of weakness right before the election like we&#39;re seeing uh October broke the six Monon winning streak for the S&P 500 the month close negative you should expect that at the end of October this is the dark blue line for presidential election year and then right after the election uh you tend to get an awful lot of strength in November and December uh even in non-presidential years but certainly in presidential years so uh that&#39;s an opportunity and so on uh this is from Mike zardi Regional Banks surged 15% and 177% in the previous two election months meaning November of 2020 and November of 2020 2016 those are huge moves that&#39;s also consistent with what we&#39;ve been saying that small caps do well in November and December uh so so uh Banks K will be a big beneficiary of that as well some data here the GDP growth rate still at 2.8 so all those calling for the recession uh didn&#39;t actually get it because we we have the growth still coming in pretty aggressively uh inflation continues to come down core pce came in at 2.2 today real consumer spending was up 3.7% so the consumer is strong and confident uh intentions to purchase automobiles in October uh was the highest level going all the way back to pre pandemic for the first time ever that is pretty exciting and we&#39;ll see the jobs report tomorrow to determine whether we the 96% chance of a 25 basis point cut in November is accurate uh but one thing that one of the listeners forwarded over the week was from the Ford earnings call that they were talking about an an estimate for AAR that is much higher than Cooper standard is calling for by the way it&#39;s my great mug hedge fund tips remember opinion not advice go to hedge fund tips.com and click on terms um so in their earnings call Ford said our outlook for 2024 assumes a flat to slightly higher SAR in both us and Europe our planning assumptions for the US is 16 million to 16.5 million units that means production is going to ramp up and the biggest beneficiary will be Cooper standard so that&#39;s pretty exciting to see and that&#39;s from Ford next uh this should shows that uh we had five straight up months and closed a negative month in October which is pretty standard um you can see here the NASDAQ season seasonality as we discussed same story weekend late late October small cap same thing uh and then very very strong small caps tend to be extremely strong from uh November for November and December this is from Seth golden talking about those the election return from October 27th to December 31st for SNP during election years is plus 6.25% when you go down to NASDAQ it&#39;s 7.17% for that basically two months and 3 days and if you go down to small caps you get the highest returns in the shortest amount of time of 7 10.99% which is consistent with the regional Banks which is a big part of small caps\n\nmentions of bottom have skyrocketed so that means earnings are going to aggressively re accelerate and particularly in the unmagnify relative to the Magnificent 7 which we saw in the last few days they continue to overspend and their margins are coming down a bit uh while the rest of the S&P 500 is going up and we&#39;re going to see that in a pronounced way in Q4 and the market is going to start to Discount that right be right after the election certainty clears Dallas fed Manufacturing Index turning up this is consistent with our recovery from the manufacturing depression moving forward and then uh October 2024 new vehicle sales forecast you can see here uh 7.9% year on-year and then a huge rebound from September up 10% so that&#39;s going to be a big deal that should P pull for forward some production for Cooper standard and um that should be a positive uh thing to see global manufacturing PMI is turning off up so that Global manufacturing recession should start to re accelerate uh uh excuse me the recovery should start to re accelerate UK births have falling to the same level as deaths we haven&#39;t seen that since 1976 but yet they&#39;re having their biggest annual growth in population in 74 years so a lot of migration going into the UK that should be constructive for um GDP Etc biggest outflow from China Equity Funds since June of 2015 um this is pretty wild because uh okay I didn&#39;t pull that chart start up so I&#39;m going to have to do it here and here so let&#39;s just use K web as a proxy for China Tech so this was the last time you had an outflow as big as you&#39;ve seen now and then what did you have you had the K web triple uh you probably had Baba triple over the same period yeah 2015 and then it tripled from 55 uh not tripled quadrupled to 207 in the next year and a half so uh Back to the Future ladies and gentlemen uh pretty exciting to see and then speaking of which uh they are having an enormous government meeting to basically determine the size of the stimulus that&#39;s going to come and they&#39;ve had monstrous estimates if Trump gets elected to offset the perceived threats about tariffs speaking about the perceived threats about tariffs I posted this chart over the weekend that got a lot of hits and was misinterpreted by a lot of people but that&#39;s on them um but you know there&#39;s been a lot of fear about Trump getting in and putting tariffs on China and what that will mean for Chinese stocks and what I could say is in 2016 there was a tremendous amount of fear about President Trump getting elected uh and putting tariffs on China and when he got elected he did exactly what he said he was going to do which is he put tariffs on China and what happened to Alibaba over the next uh four first off the the first year and a half while he was in Alibaba uh doubled plus up 150% from 84 to over 200 and change and by the time he was out it was up almost 4X uh from 84 from when he got in to it hit 312 uh during that same period and then when the new Administration came in it collapsed from uh 280 down to 66 and you know a lot of people said well correlation is not causation and uh to that I say no s Sherlock but the point was that the same Euphoria around tariffs proved to be unfounded as it related to the abilities of these companies to earn uh in their countries number one certainly AB Baba a kweb etc um and number two the studies that I&#39;ve read about tariffs is even if he went full boore and did 60% tariff and it wasn&#39;t just a tactic to negotiate with she he actually implemented it it would have a negative impact on Chinese GDP by 1% I I would have thought it would be like 10% uh we overestimate our influence on their uh on their economy and on that basis what they are planning which will come out I think it&#39;s the 5ifth to the eth they&#39;re having the the big meeting uh I guess to see who&#39;s going to be elected so if Trump is elected the stimulus is probably going to be five times bigger than if kamla is elected and meanwhile the policies of kamla would be more deleterious to the Chinese because it&#39;s an ideological type of um kind of creating a cold war versus a pragmatic philosophy of uh ey for an eye if you&#39;re going to tariff us we&#39;re going to tariff you uh but we&#39;re still going to do business and uh and move ahead because we want to make money and we want to create jobs so so this chart I think is very important same frenzy as a matter of fact it&#39;s funny because Baba was in the same type of bottoming process breaking out and then taking a little breather before taking its big run and this is a very similar situation so um I love seeing that I also see it on gold biggest inflow to Gold funds since July of 2020 well the last time you saw that inflow into gold at this level in such a short period of time was early 2020 and what was that it was called a top and it basically uh collapsed about 30% overnight and then or 25% and then continued downward I&#39;m sorry 20% Then continued down 25% and basically never hit that new high for uh three more years after uh correcting 25% it&#39;s not to say this is the exact top I would just say this is not the time to be chasing it biggest outflow from Emerging Market Equity Funds since April of 20 of 2000 rather and if you go back to April of 2000 and you bought Emerging Markets you made one of the quickest doubles in the shortest amount of time in history",

should start to re accelerate uh uh excuse me the recovery should start to re accelerate UK births have falling to the same level as deaths we haven&#39;t seen that since 1976 but yet they&#39;re having their biggest annual growth in population in 74 years so a lot of migration going into the UK that should be constructive for um GDP Etc biggest outflow from China Equity Funds since June of 2015 um this is pretty wild because uh okay I didn&#39;t pull that chart start up so I&#39;m going to have to do it here and here so let&#39;s just use K web as a proxy for China Tech so this was the last time you had an outflow as big as you&#39;ve seen now and then what did you have you had the K web triple uh you probably had Baba triple over the same period yeah 2015 and then it tripled from 55 uh not tripled quadrupled to 207 in the next year and a half so uh Back to the Future ladies and gentlemen uh pretty exciting to see and then speaking of which uh they are having an enormous government meeting to basically determine the size of the stimulus that&#39;s going to come and they&#39;ve had monstrous estimates if Trump gets elected to offset the perceived threats about tariffs speaking about the perceived threats about tariffs I posted this chart over the weekend that got a lot of hits and was misinterpreted by a lot of people but that&#39;s on them um but you know there&#39;s been a lot of fear about Trump getting in and putting tariffs on China and what that will mean for Chinese stocks and what I could say is in 2016 there was a tremendous amount of fear about President Trump getting elected uh and putting tariffs on China and when he got elected he did exactly what he said he was going to do which is he put tariffs on China and what happened to Alibaba over the next uh four first off the the first year and a half while he was in Alibaba uh doubled plus up 150% from 84 to over 200 and change and by the time he was out it was up almost 4X uh from 84 from when he got in to it hit 312 uh during that same period and then when the new Administration came in it collapsed from uh 280 down to 66 and you know a lot of people said well correlation is not causation and uh to that I say no s Sherlock but the point was that the same Euphoria around tariffs proved to be unfounded as it related to the abilities of these companies to earn uh in their countries number one certainly AB Baba a kweb etc um and number two the studies that I&#39;ve read about tariffs is even if he went full boore and did 60% tariff and it wasn&#39;t just a tactic to negotiate with she he actually implemented it it would have a negative impact on Chinese GDP by 1% I I would have thought it would be like 10% uh we overestimate our influence on their uh on their economy and on that basis what they are planning which will come out I think it&#39;s the 5ifth to the eth they&#39;re having the the big meeting uh I guess to see who&#39;s going to be elected so if Trump is elected the stimulus is probably going to be five times bigger than if kamla is elected and meanwhile the policies of kamla would be more deleterious to the Chinese because it&#39;s an ideological type of um kind of creating a cold war versus a pragmatic philosophy of uh ey for an eye if you&#39;re going to tariff us we&#39;re going to tariff you uh but we&#39;re still going to do business and uh and move ahead because we want to make money and we want to create jobs so so this chart I think is very important same frenzy as a matter of fact it&#39;s funny because Baba was in the same type of bottoming process breaking out and then taking a little breather before taking its big run and this is a very similar situation so um I love seeing that I also see it on gold biggest inflow to Gold funds since July of 2020 well the last time you saw that inflow into gold at this level in such a short period of time was early 2020 and what was that it was called a top and it basically uh collapsed about 30% overnight and then or 25% and then continued downward I&#39;m sorry 20% Then continued down 25% and basically never hit that new high for uh three more years after uh correcting 25% it&#39;s not to say this is the exact top I would just say this is not the time to be chasing it biggest outflow from Emerging Market Equity Funds since April of 20 of 2000 rather and if you go back to April of 2000 and you bought Emerging Markets you made one of the quickest doubles in the shortest amount of time in history\n\nenergy is going to be the most negative this quarter also negative next quarter and then starts to re accelerate next year they&#39;ll start to discount it uh Industrials negative this quarter then starts to re accelerate meaningfully uh next year and then materials re accelerate starting next quarter so that&#39;s like the Alba marals of the world will start to really do well Healthcare should re accelerate week quarter this quarter should start to do a lot better consumer discretionary which we&#39;ve talked about a lot uh com services and and utilities so uh that&#39;s a good road map and then worst inventory destocking cycle is likely behind us which we talked about so you can see here and this is just the beginning of the recovery When You See It move back up to that Baseline like you did in 2003 you had four more years of rally like you did in 2011 you had uh nine more years a rally like you did in 200 uh 2000 and then you had another two years of a rally so uh this is just beginning just re accelerating and you can see it in the Korean exports are still strong and the rail Freight card loads continue to rise software lagged semis by the biggest spread over the past two years except during the tech bubble uh so that&#39;s a a pretty big extreme there to start to pay attention to and we&#39;ll start to look at some stuff in soft software um Equity sentiment is getting warmer but not really extreme according to the bull bear indicator at uh Bank of America and then quarterly Market breath in Q3 was the widest in 20 years which is exactly what we saw in 2001 and 2002 before the 3 to four year run which had china Emerging Markets small caps and value dramatically outperformed the rest of the market while Tech had uh subdued returns to put it mildly uh Equity weighted S&P 500 inflected higher versus cap weighted post June CPI report and that has persisted that&#39;s just the beginning of the game not the end of the game then we&#39;ve got our sler stuff from uh\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nRBC  thanks to my buddy over there uh and as you can see it looks like we topped out with yields in the past week at 4.3 and now we&#39;re bouncing off that resistance at the 61.8% level for those of you who care about Fibonacci levels uh we are not really one of them but we we pay attention to what other people are paying attention to and that&#39;s called Game Theory um then the S&P 500 uh so you know you had this cup and handle it broke out it wouldn&#39;t be unexpected for it to go back and test the breakout level of 5669 on the S&P 500 not saying it will but saying I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if we had that and that would probably be make a lot of sense mostly pre-election or if the election decision gets dragged out a few days in that uncertain period uh that&#39;s the kind of thing you could see semiconductors have been weak trying to get off the mat we&#39;ll see if uh November is seasonally a very strong period for semiconductors maybe Intel can play a role in leading some of them out of the woods uh S&P we covered NASDAQ we covered gold price this is at the 261.5 Bacci extension level uh which kind of confirms what we&#39;re saying you&#39;re probably at a top not a not a not a

you had this huge rally up as we all know and now that it&#39;s checking back uh people are getting nervous they&#39;ve all forgot about what teer said uh God willing we get a pullback I&#39;m going

wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it did happen midcaps have been consolidating for a few months they could they shall should break higher here towards the end of the year along with small caps I think small caps break out in the next two months this is a large cup and handle uh so the implied measured move would be from 1,000 to 4700 so 400 points his FIB level has you at 1,700 my measured move would have you at 1,800 but the name of the game is earnings are going to re accelerate and support all this nonsense Voodoo about lines and charts but it just helps to zoom out and take a look at these things so you can see where you are here&#39;s the weekly Russell this thing looks beautiful uh to break out meaningfully and continue to go so that&#39;s going to be your best value to price price is what you pay value is what you&#39;re going to get uh in the market right now and all the impatient bobbleheads on TV that keep saying oh the small cap trade&#39;s not working blah blah blah

point to for all of the ways that we&#39;re positioned to take advantage over the next few years and are starting to see slowing earnings growth for the Magnificent 7 so you want to go where the growth is going to be happening versus the deceleration and we saw that this week in the mag 7 getting smacked today 10-year treasury yields uh this is a counter Trend move even Goldman Sachs agrees with me pointing to a 3.85% Target moving forward down from the 4.2 and change where we are at now I agree hedge fund asset managers turn dollar Bulls on Election risk again this is a counter Trend move it will get resolved in coming months uh and uh the age of population across different countries which is very interesting we&#39;ve been bullish on China we think China&#39;s got a a great run for the next few years and the US why because the bulk of their population is age 34 and you can see it played out in the numbers right here China&#39;s this navy blue line uh and um us is basically uh this red line here right around the exact same age so uh China&#39;s a little bit ahead that&#39;s why I think they&#39;ve got a three to five year run and I think us has another two years I think we&#39;ve got a seven or eight year run uh effectively straight up because of that population advantage and then you look at other countries like uh and Britain is also in that favorable situation uh uh other countries like EU Japan do not have that Advantage they are Beyond The Beneficial years and they&#39;re going to continue to be slow Dallas fed manufactur the advantage that the EU might have over China is that they can import more uh import more people more immigration uh which could help them in terms of population growth and age demographics which could really help them from from a labor force standpoint Dallas manufacturing we covered most positive reactions to beats since Q4 of 2018 so far uh long short Equity Funds very long US Stocks which is uh when they say stocks and equities they&#39;re referring to concentration in the S&amp;P which is effectively mag 7 and when you get that overweight like we saw in late 20 21 what happened Tech got shellacked and we saw indications of that which is why we took off most of those positions in July uh after huge runs and the tail ends uh in in the past couple of months so treasury yields uh versus WTI Crude this Divergence always resolves in 2022 you had the opposite Divergence you had WTI at a peak and treasury yields at a contraction now you have treasury yields way up and uh WTI Crude weigh down I think this resolves I think they&#39;re going to wind up meeting in the middle yields are going to come down meaningfully and energy probably starts to go up us job openings as a matter of fact it&#39;s interesting Trump was talking about helping the oil industry by having OPEC cut barrels which is kind of interesting uh because I guess the energy industry said got got wise to him and said drill baby drill doesn&#39;t help us it may help you it doesn&#39;t help us so uh so maybe there&#39;s a compromise to be had there us job openings again jolts collapsing which gives the employers more pricing power for labor quits rate has gone down people are not quitting their jobs anymore because they can&#39;t name their price across the street and perceived likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months drop to a new low in October hedge funds are very short on green stocks you know I continue to look at some of these solar stocks and um and others because people are so short and uh uh the opposite of what people are expecting people think if Trump gets elected energy stocks go up when he was in last time they did terribly uh green stocks did horribly under Biden people thought they would do well they did better under Trump so I think there might be a pony in this pile I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s EVS or solar probably something in solar um so we continue to look uh maybe the way to play it is the way that we have with the started position in Alam Maro and just kind of deal with the picks and shovels related to these themes um uh that that&#39;s probably the way I&#39;ll wind up playing it but uh US tech stocks have been seeing more frequent fragility events with 2024 currently on track to have nearly the most since 1992 Sigma moves with magnitude greater than three for tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 fragility events are also more extreme in the magnitude for the largest stocks of the S&amp;P currently exhibiting their largest magnitude since 1992 uh so basically they&#39;re saying the mag7 is vulnerable uh based on this uh data that they&#39;re collecting mentions of botom surged which is historically indicated a bottoming of the EPS cycle which we saw uh up further we&#39;ll Co cover that again initial jobless claims uh have come down so that&#39;s something to keep an eye on we&#39;ll see what happens with the jobs report tomorrow we need it to be a little bit weak but not too weak weak enough to keep the FED on track for the November cut although one war is uh based on the election outcome that they might be influenced to act in one way or another um but um but let&#39;s just see the data so far they&#39;ve been data data dependent so let&#39;s hope that continues wanted to show you some seasonality of a few of the names we&#39;ve discussed on the podcast some of which we own for clients and personally uh Cooper standard you can see the best time of the year for Cooper standard stock happens to be the end of the year in November and December uh TLT bonds again last month is the worst month of the year this month November is the best month of the year so we should see some compression in yields uh Regional Bank stocks tend to have their best three months October November December that&#39;s consistent with small caps o uh in November and December have monster months and then biotech is supposed to have a big month in November historically it does uh Advanced Auto Parts does well with small caps in December and uh even Estee louder which got shellacked today uh we&#39;re thinking about making it a sign more meaningful position uh bought some stock today doing some work on on that um you know it&#39;s never been a big position because it&#39;s too correlated to China and Alibaba and we have enough exposure there but I think now it&#39;s a high enough quality business they&#39;ve got the new CEO he&#39;ll probably have one more kitchen syn quarter uh the first quarter that he reports on and then the thing can can start to move and and turn with China um and it may turn quicker which is why we&#39;re opportunistically taking advantage Intel they just reported after the Bell the stock was up big um this is November is the best month of the year they&#39;re up 100% of the time in November so I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through with the after hour um Spike particularly after the election Etsy is a new position that we have not disclosed on the podcast that we entered a couple of weeks ago uh I think our basis is somewhere in the 49s and change uh we&#39;ll probably have another chance to buy it in the 40s but it&#39;s a nice siiz position they had great earnings we&#39;re not going to do anything comprehensive on that yet um but uh just putting that out there uh Seth golden talking about small caps looking good haven&#39;t broken out to new Highs but crawling their way higher we&#39;ve been talking about that for a while uh we have the seasonality here and then the first 10 trading days of November are amongst the best trading days of the year in a presidential election year this is um right here uh so that&#39;s the best 10-day period so we&#39;ll see how that plays out this year weak demand mentions are tracking at the lowest level in two years meaning demand has reacceleration across the S&amp;P 500 components mentions of bottoms which we discussed indicator suggests a 12% year-on-year EPS growth in Q4 versus 10% consensus so Q3 is the pause that refreshes Q4 uh it&#39;s looking like earnings are going to come in even higher than the street is expecting on the basis of this data and then",

the thing can can start to move and and turn with China um and it may turn quicker which is why we&#39;re opportunistically taking advantage Intel they just reported after the Bell the stock was up big um this is November is the best month of the year they&#39;re up 100% of the time in November so I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through with the after hour um Spike particularly after the election Etsy is a new position that we have not disclosed on the podcast that we entered a couple of weeks ago uh I think our basis is somewhere in the 49s and change uh we&#39;ll probably have another chance to buy it in the 40s but it&#39;s a nice siiz position they had great earnings we&#39;re not going to do anything comprehensive on that yet um but uh just putting that out there uh Seth golden talking about small caps looking good haven&#39;t broken out to new Highs but crawling their way higher we&#39;ve been talking about that for a while uh we have the seasonality here and then the first 10 trading days of November are amongst the best trading days of the year in a presidential election year this is um right here uh so that&#39;s the best 10-day period so we&#39;ll see how that plays out this year weak demand mentions are tracking at the lowest level in two years meaning demand has reacceleration across the S&amp;P 500 components mentions of bottoms which we discussed indicator suggests a 12% year-on-year EPS growth in Q4 versus 10% consensus so Q3 is the pause that refreshes Q4 uh it&#39;s looking like earnings are going to come in even higher than the street is expecting on the basis of this data and then",
    "### TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\ncorrelation of the s&amp; p500 versus the S&amp;P equal weighted index is at record lows not seen since when since 2001 and 2002 the the analog that we continue to point to for all of the ways that we&#39;re positioned to take advantage over the next few years and are starting to see slowing earnings growth for the Magnificent 7 so you want to go where the growth is going to be happening versus the deceleration and we saw that this week in the mag 7 getting smacked today 10-year treasury yields uh this is a counter Trend move even Goldman Sachs agrees with me pointing to a 3.85% Target moving forward down from the 4.2 and change where we are at now I agree hedge fund asset managers turn dollar Bulls on Election risk again this is a counter Trend move it will get resolved in coming months uh and uh the age of population across different countries which is very interesting we&#39;ve been bullish on China we think China&#39;s got a a great run for the next few years and the US why because the bulk of their population is age 34 and you can see it played out in the numbers right here China&#39;s this navy blue line uh and um us is basically uh this red line here right around the exact same age so uh China&#39;s a little bit ahead that&#39;s why I think they&#39;ve got a three to five year run and I think us has another two years I think we&#39;ve got a seven or eight year run uh effectively straight up because of that population advantage and then you look at other countries like uh and Britain is also in that favorable situation uh uh other countries like EU Japan do not have that Advantage they are Beyond The Beneficial years and they&#39;re going to continue to be slow Dallas fed manufactur the advantage that the EU might have over China is that they can import more uh import more people more immigration uh which could help them in terms of population growth and age demographics which could really help them from from a labor force standpoint Dallas manufacturing we covered most positive reactions to beats since Q4 of 2018 so far uh long short Equity Funds very long US Stocks which is uh when they say stocks and equities they&#39;re referring to concentration in the S&amp;P which is effectively mag 7 and when you get that overweight like we saw in late 20 21 what happened Tech got shellacked and we saw indications of that which is why we took off most of those positions in July uh after huge runs and the tail ends uh in in the past couple of months so treasury yields uh versus WTI Crude this Divergence always resolves in 2022 you had the opposite Divergence you had WTI at a peak and treasury yields at a contraction now you have treasury yields way up and uh WTI Crude weigh down I think this resolves I think they&#39;re going to wind up meeting in the middle yields are going to come down meaningfully and energy probably starts to go up us job openings as a matter of fact it&#39;s interesting Trump was talking about helping the oil industry by having OPEC cut barrels which is kind of interesting uh because I guess the energy industry said got got wise to him and said drill baby drill doesn&#39;t help us it may help you it doesn&#39;t help us so uh so maybe there&#39;s a compromise to be had there us job openings again jolts collapsing which gives the employers more pricing power for labor quits rate has gone down people are not quitting their jobs anymore because they can&#39;t name their price across the street and perceived likelihood of a recession over the next 12 months drop to a new low in October hedge funds are very short on green stocks you know I continue to look at some of these solar stocks and um and others because people are so short and uh uh the opposite of what people are expecting people think if Trump gets elected energy stocks go up when he was in last time they did terribly uh green stocks did horribly under Biden people thought they would do well they did better under Trump so I think there might be a pony in this pile I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s EVS or solar probably something in solar um so we continue to look uh maybe the way to play it is the way that we have with the started position in Alam Maro and just kind of deal with the picks and shovels related to these themes um uh that that&#39;s probably the way I&#39;ll wind up playing it but uh US tech stocks have been seeing more frequent fragility events with 2024 currently on track to have nearly the most since 1992 Sigma moves with magnitude greater than three for tech stocks in the S&amp;P 500 fragility events are also more extreme in the magnitude for the largest stocks of the S&amp;P currently exhibiting their largest magnitude since 1992 uh so basically they&#39;re saying the mag7 is vulnerable uh based on this uh data that they&#39;re collecting mentions of botom surged which is historically indicated a bottoming of the EPS cycle which we saw uh up further we&#39;ll Co cover that again initial jobless claims uh have come down so that&#39;s something to keep an eye on we&#39;ll see what happens with the jobs report tomorrow we need it to be a little bit weak but not too weak weak enough to keep the FED on track for the November cut although one war is uh based on the election outcome that they might be influenced to act in one way or another um but um but let&#39;s just see the data so far they&#39;ve been data data dependent so let&#39;s hope that continues wanted to show you some seasonality of a few of the names we&#39;ve discussed on the podcast some of which we own for clients and personally uh Cooper standard you can see the best time of the year for Cooper standard stock happens to be the end of the year in November and December uh TLT bonds again last month is the worst month of the year this month November is the best month of the year so we should see some compression in yields uh Regional Bank stocks tend to have their best three months October November December that&#39;s consistent with small caps o uh in November and December have monster months and then biotech is supposed to have a big month in November historically it does uh Advanced Auto Parts does well with small caps in December and uh even Estee louder which got shellacked today uh we&#39;re thinking about making it a sign more

and a half ago when said everyone said that was not going to happen we played vernado for a quick huge pop and um and that that game has just started Intel invest 300 million in China chip package and testing plant Intel and Samsung to explore Foundry Alliance to challenge Taiwan semiconductor it&#39;s an oligopoly ladies and gentlemen those are the three biggest so if they join forces that could be very positive both for Samsung and for Intel China&#39;s gen zers are into stocks they are so over the housing crisis this is huge this is the beginning days opinion follows Trend as price goes up that&#39;s what they&#39;ll do all they&#39;ve known for the last 20 years is housing goes up now that&#39;s not happening they&#39;re going to reallocate their funds to stocks and this game is just getting started China confidence consumer confidence seen as the key driver for growth so that is going to be the theme for that special meeting from November 4th to 8th where they decide the magnitude of the stimulus and if it&#39;s Trump it&#39;s going to be the biggest fiscal stimulus in the history of China in my personal opinion uh China&#39;s Central Bank adds $70 billion with new liquidity tool so they&#39;re doing these baby steps in the background waiting for the big bazooka timed right if and when uh Trump is elected as new president which the betting odds dramatically favor at the moment that&#39;s not to say that um things can ha change over three or four days but uh five days but um uh there&#39;s definitely a lot of momentum so super micro stock Falls further

the numbers are so good the numbers are so good well it turns out the numbers were uh Incorrect and their auditor stepped down and the stock is collapsing uh so um so anyway there are telltale signs you can only have after you&#39;ve just been around for a long time and um uh tough for those things to get found out during a bull market though so that thing must have been egregious their

    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nso we have will Ferell on the horse with the PayPal app and we have the Vans the new vans that I got uh last week and the company doing incredibly well as it relates to PayPal uh they beat on the bottom line and raised Guidance the revenue Miss was due to intentionally discontinuing brain tree Revenue that was either low margin or no margin business this Wall Street Journal article by telis demos which is also a superlative publication uh summarizes why the stock was red after reporting earnings and why it might see a lot of green in the future so uh as he says PayPal says it is sacrificing some volume growth to focus on the more profitable payment flows the market doesn&#39;t like the look for that for now but investors may come to embrace it if similar moves at other payment players are any guide so what they&#39;ve done is brain free is the non-branded stuff they&#39;ve increased the margin by adding value Services the different checkout we&#39;ve discussed the data business all the other things so they can make it a high margin business the part of the business that they were pushing through there that is low to no margin they&#39;ve just decided we like we&#39;ll just take 80% of your business that&#39;s profitable you can give the no margin business to someone else so the Wall Street Wall Street got upset that revenues didn&#39;t grow as fast but again this is exactly what they did with the unprofitable customers in Latin America you remember when he came came in he just fired them all and now they&#39;re back to Growing profitable customers and they&#39;re back to 432 million he&#39;s doing the same with this side of B with this side of the business and Tellis says um similar shifts in emphasis have been winning moves for shares of other payments players lately including a firm by now pay later provider its Shares are up 149% over the last 12 months Aiden which spooked the markets in 2023 by warning about increase in competition and commoditization in payments likewise shifted focus and has seen its shares jump 128% in the past year so uh this is a proven Playbook Alex Chris will do it better than all these folks have done but in the interim he had total payment volume up 9% net revenues up 6% uh operating income 1.5 billion up 18% operating margin up 18% um uh sorry uh 18.8% up 194 basis points transaction margin dollars up 8% and uh raising their full year non Gap guidance so all of these things are clicking um their teams drove transaction margin dollar growth and brain free because they cut off the unprofitable Revenue started contributing again to margin dollar growth which they hadn&#39;t before um they also ramped up fast lane and improved the Branded experience across the US Partnerships with key players like f serve Aiden Amazon Global Payments and Shopify these are all new Partnerships that have taken on their fast lane because it&#39;s better than anything else and it dramatically improves conversion for everyone so they&#39;re licensing it because they can&#39;t duplicate it and that&#39;s what makes PayPal um just leaving the station uh guidance raised for the full year reflects not only the third quarter outperformance but also a constructive a slightly more constructive view of the fourth quarter compared to what was implied in our last guide in July this is driven by more favorable view of transaction margin dollar growth which we plan to reinvest near-term back into strategic initiatives and marketing that are aimed at driving long-term durable growth I.E some of that&#39;s going into Will Ferrell&#39;s pocket to hop around on horses and tell everyone that he wants to pay from everywhere with all the rewards apps and the venmo and the PayPal app and getting mobile right and this is very much like Facebook in 2016 when everyone said they didn&#39;t get mobile they missed it and then they got it and everything took off PayPal is doing the same thing with payments their mobile game is going to the top shelf from the bottom uh basement floor is where it was when he took over free cash flow from operations one was 1 point6 billion and free cash flow was 1.4 billion uh so they continue to buy back stock they returned 1.8 billion to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 28 million shares of stock this thing is going to continue to generate more and more cash and continue need to shrink the float and one day you&#39;re going to wake up and it&#39;s $130 and then it&#39;s $180 and then it&#39;s $200 and everyone says wow I remember that when that was a $58 stock when uh Tom was talking about it on his podcast I can&#39;t believe it the some of these things are obvious you just have to be patient and you have to be in the game so it&#39;s had this big move from 58 or 60 to 80 now it&#39;s got going to consolidate in the high 70s before making the next move up but uh the key is it&#39;s it&#39;s gotten through the hard stuff and now it&#39;s going to continue to uh raise guidance continue to execute continue to uh build profitable sustainable growth and you can see on a line by line basis everything is moving in the right direction whether it happens too quickly on one metric for the Wall Street cell side or not quickly enough because people can&#39;t wait two or three months does not concern me I have a great company at an unbelievable basis and uh and we&#39;re going to ride this thing um just like will frell on his horse paying from everywhere you can see him in the ad there 1 million new PayPal debit card enrollments since September launch I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up it just everything is humming here TR um active accounts are up monthly active accounts active accounts number of payment transactions up transactions per active account are up 9% so not only are more people using it the people are using it are using it more frequently because they&#39;re giving them more rewards more cash back than anywhere else and um and that stuff starts to multiply geometrically uh I want to go through some of these here uh evolve from a disparate payment products and point Solutions into a powerful Commerce platform as we Shi from payments company to a Commerce platform more of the world&#39;s leading Commerce players have partnered with us to add value for our mutual customers over the past two months we&#39;ve announced Partnerships with f serve 8 addan Amazon Global Payments and Shopify and we&#39;re actively discussing more collaborations in the industry these new and expanded relationships are clear demonstration our brand and Innovations and momentum are resonating uh so that&#39;s that new product experience are resulting on average more than 100 basis points of conversion lift for the vaulted checkout and up to 400 basis points of conversion upli uplift for onetime checkout we&#39;re also seeing a 15 to 20% increase in buy now pay later use so all this stuff ladies and gentlem is staggering how quickly they are ramping it up and getting it adopted um second consecutive quarter in more than two years that brain tree is meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth that came from doing those things that um Street was angry at them for doing which is basically firing non-profitable negative yielding business and only dealing with profitable higher margin business by adding value ad versus being a commodity provider uh the scale of customers who are primed to spend with PayPal puts us way ahead of other guest checkout Solutions and is one of the reasons why so many platforms are choosing to partner with us we can&#39;t wait to get fast lane into the hands of more merchants not only on brain tree and ppcp but also through our Partnerships with f serve addan Global Payments next year moving to small and medium-sized businesses last months we B launch PayPal complete uh oh complete payments in new geographies including China and Hong Kong with more markets on the horizon in 2025 so they&#39;ve just launched in China and Hong Kong ladies and gentlemen that could be very constructive for them in the context of the China recovery the TR China stimulus and the um China uh consumer coming back so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a positive thing um in the PayPal debit card in addition these debit card users are now choosing PayPal brand to check out more frequently when they shop online early data from our existing customers shows a 5x increase in total omnis spend within the first two weeks of sign up so I mean these are things you don&#39;t hear anywhere else I I mean this is this is the key the the cell side was pissed off about transaction take rate declined by four basis points to 167 compared to uh three basis point decline last quarter but they talk about the improvements in brain chain venmo monetization that&#39;ll come back PayPal generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\naround Logitech I know you were not wanted to hear mous guy takes over fashion company but the truth is you made for this job weren&#39;t you you know I I look I&#39;m in I&#39;m in heaven here I mean I&#39;ve got I&#39;m surrounded by amazing iconic Brands and an incredible opportunity to create great products I just love this stuff now in you&#39;re laying things out and today was uh a good layout of the medium term you haven&#39;t laid out the bran yet however you did make it clear in a series of what I regard as very candid comments if we say it we do it what did you say and what have you done well what we what we said was we were going to bring we were going to uh bring down the debt level by by by selling some assets getting inventory control a good one you had to sell that&#39;s right and we and we said we&#39;d sell a brand asset we did so we we said we&#39;d sell some assets we did we sold planes hangers real estate we sold we sold uh Supreme which is a fantastic asset but didn&#39;t strategically belong in the portfolio and we said we&#39;d lower cost we took it down by $300 million so we what we&#39;ve been saying we&#39;ve been doing now that matters because uh one of the things that you have is talking about a compelling value proposition you&#39;re trading significantly off sustained historic High highly lever with a clear path to delever and then I thought this was incredible operating income when you&#39;ve come in historic lows yeah what a what a t is this the O J Stables you got here you know I think anytime you you you&#39;re lucky enough like I&#39;ve been a few times to be brought into a turnaround uh your temptation is to look at the short term and say wow we can flip this really quick uh I&#39;ve learned you know the the real secret to turnarounds is think long term and so the opportunity is to really dramatically improve those operating margins but the cool thing is the really big opportunity for long-term investors and for and the reason I&#39;m here is\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nTimberland boot that you were so excited about Dickies tell how there you go how can I not be excited but I&#39;m going to give you a little thing because my uh parents were from the fashion industry what the hell you doing charging half for everything and when it&#39;s better than the guys who chargeing home I mean I look at I look at the dick Dickies okay work pants 35 bucks and then I go to that carart yours are no yours are same as carart but if they have price is that is that correct I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve got it correct yours are better but but but but to But to answer your question look one of the reasons I came to this company I could have done other things I came here because I didn&#39;t want to be in luxury I wanted to be in products that could sell to everybody you know I grew up in middle I grew up in Kentucky I grew up with a single mom I don&#39;t you know I love I love this world of where you walk in the street and you see people wearing your stuff you don&#39;t have to walk into the the high-end Fashion Mall and so this is my I feel so at home here now uh I do want to just get your impression of my impression I think that you have a brand go to Europe okay I like to go to Europe it&#39;s pretty cool and all I ever see is Northface I see Northface Northface Northface I go to uh to kuram okay the nicest Street in Berlin they&#39;re lining up for Northface and the last probably eight conference calls before you got here I never heard Northface how is that possible you know Northface is a phenomenal brand we&#39;ve really performed well in Europe very well in apack not as well here that&#39;s the reason you didn&#39;t hear about it but but but we&#39;ll we&#39;ll change that so I think at the end of the day we we&#39;re running a different operating model in the rest of the world than we were in the US and that created it made us bureaucratic slow and and not as effective now we&#39;ve changed brought the European operating model into the American that&#39;s what I and we&#39;re going to get our mojo here okay so what do we want to be how much online how much brick and mortar how much Walmart hey which you and I both know is not the Walmart that people think it is is cool as all get out with the big Dickies display how much Costco how much everybody else you know look I I one thing the the the underlying principle of all this is we want to sell where people are buying where people come to shop so we we love the retailers they&#39;re multibrand retailers they&#39;re cuz who&#39;s coming in there when you go in there you&#39;re thinking okay I might want this brand I might want that brand I want this category got to be there got to be there with great product great marketing we also want to be when people are loving Dickies or loving bands or the North Face or Timberland we want to we want them be able to go online and buy or go into one of our stores and buy so we want to be in all those places and let the consumers decide how what the proportion is now I believe uh that you have obviously have to

then got and my life was better including those I still wear you know the the great ear airbuds which is like a little better than somebody else what you got mine what are you thinking what are you thinking well I you know look the the the most oh give us something you&#39;re going to give me something come on give me something the crazy fun thing about this industry is that there&#39;s so many things you can create this is the this in in one year this has become um the number two shoe sold in Vans it&#39;s it&#39;s the called the new school I thought Vans was dead oh Vans is not dead Vans

he&#39;s wearing it to I got to call I got to get in touch with Bob he should be wearing Vans or Timberland for sure we&#39;ll we&#39;ll call him after this definitely all right so time frame how much is I mean already You&#39; blown it away I thought that you you&#39;d have to have a year of just of reading and then the stock goes to 12 and then you start the launching pad you&#39;re already at the launching pip what&#39;s next you know this is look as I said at the beginning the one thing I&#39;ve learned is we&#39;re you know to really turn around a business you should be thinking very long term because otherwise everything you do just comes undone so we&#39;re we&#39;re changing almost every variable inside the company and synchronizing it and that&#39;s going to start to click as the years go by and over time will become a Growth Company is it fun it&#39;s incredibly fun discover something new every day among these Brands I I am just having a ball bringing in inventive people turn to have a lot of great people already we&#39;re we&#39;ve got great people inside and we&#39;re bringing great people from the outside well look it is so terrific to see you with an iconic company that I have loved from when it was when it was wam mening in in Pennsylvania where we go and we fight over a pair of jeans at the bottom of a cardboard box remember was the terrific five bucks for a pair of jeans that last for they&#39;re still my closet Brack andow is the presiden of VF Corp I am so thrilled you&#39;re here coming up and we&#39;re back um so effectively they have improved beyond what they had anticipated they would improve in terms of the uh the year on-year declines are now narrowing and they&#39;re going to start to be uh we&#39;re going to start to see year- on-year flats and then we&#39;re going to start to see year year reacceleration and a growth story uh start to happen and and that&#39;s a big thing uh gross margin was up 120 basis points EPS was 52 cents versus - 1116 last year uh net debt is down but they got uh 1.5 billion in from Supreme so it&#39;s going to be down a lot more and uh for Q3 20 fiscal year 2025 expects on a continuing operation basis Revenue in the range of 2.7 to 2.75 billion down 1 to 3% year-over-year in reported dollars so this is really narrowing from double digits down to low single digits and uh and then we see obviously APAC in China was up bigly 6% uh despite what everyone else is saying and uh and that&#39;s that&#39;s been positive expanded gross margins they go through all of this stuff new new school is selling out everywhere which we&#39;ve covered uh sold out in five minutes upon the launch in September uh super strong comparison back to school North Face is strong hitting on all cylinders uh greater China continued it strong momentum and let&#39;s see here we&#39;re running long on time uh and then the investor days when the real the stock really took off talked about long-term sustainable profitable growth like he did with Jim Kramer transforming its company performance category adjusted gross margin back up to 55% and how they&#39;re going to do that operating margin back to 10% net leverage 2.5 times or below and then you can see some of the slides from the investor day which came after the earnings day and you can see where growth margin is and where it&#39;s going and how they&#39;re going to get there uh is through reduction of sgna and getting that operating margin back to 10% uh and uh nine Focus work streams in action to drive 500 to $600 million of operating income expansion and they go through the game plan so this is not you know finger in the wind and uh hope hope that they get it done they are hitting on all cylinders and they&#39;re deliv in on what they said they were going to do from the moment he came in in that first quarter with the conference call which has really been amazing because you really don&#39;t know what you&#39;re dealing with when you just come in and the fact that he did know what he was dealing with and he put together the plan and he&#39;s been executing it and getting that European platform that works so well into the US and and implementing it across Brands and having collaboration across Brands is a big deal so uh what we&#39;ve done key account Partnerships cross brand execution segmentation and elevation what we&#39;re seeing growth in share capture quality of growth and inventory Health",

National Association of active investment managers dropped a little bit but let&#39;s see how much fear came into the market today my guess is not as much as you would hope uh all right so it dropped into the fear Zone at 44 down from 58 so that&#39;s a move in the right Direction ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS defense and arrow space earnings top 30 weights uh estimates were down 2.03 probably some of

ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\nquestions\n\nhere we go we got a lot of them this week Kyle M hey Tom I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll cover it in depth next week but any initial thoughts on Cooper standard earnings and guidance um I hope they do terribly so I can buy more stock how&#39;s that uh I don&#39;t know I I mean I I don&#39;t really spend a lot of time guessing what they&#39;re going to do on a quarter by quter basis all I watch is incentives and and SAR North North American SAR so Ford is implying that the SAR is going to be a little stronger than everyone else thinks if that&#39;s the case Cooper standard will do better I mean if the volumes come in Cooper standard they&#39;ve got that thing run like a lean mean fighting machine and if as that SAR gets over 158 their cash flow Break Even every couple hundred th000 cars they&#39;re going to just mint money so um that&#39;s how I think about it and if it&#39;s this quarter great if it&#39;s not I&#39;ll buy more stock and then if it&#39;s next quarter I&#39;ll just have more stock when it goes back to 25 and Beyond \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nhi Tom I know you said before you wouldn&#39;t consider Nike since you have enough China exposure through Alibaba and Goose what price would you say it&#39;s undervalued I mean I would look at it here I think it&#39;s okay um you&#39;re never going to get the exact bottom and the market doesn&#39;t care where I think it&#39;s undervalued um but uh but yeah I I would I would be a buyer at these levels I think let me just take a look yeah this one&#39;s probably going to be fine so that&#39;s on the short list okay next Este louder we covered already Paul Davies curious why you think Canadian dollar we covered all that uh let&#39;s go on to Nova Nordisk uh this is from Paul Davies okay I was wondering why he was coming to me with Novo Nordisk he is a new listener so I want to welcome him in uh he is recommending a stock that&#39;s up 10x and has corrected 20% in Nova nordis I would say pass um there&#39;s a lot of competition coming into the glp1 phase which we talked about last year when we were getting pessimistic on uh not last year last this summer when we were getting pessimistic on um Eli Lily and we went on Yahoo in that segment where they make you talk about one stock you like and one stock you would uh not want to be buying and uh so it&#39;s come down from 972 to 829 over the last couple months I think you&#39;re going to see more and more price competition so for me no as great as Novo nordex has been in the rearview mirror I&#39;m not a fan prospectively um Landon asked about s ladder I think it&#39;s getting cheap enough here to put a starter position and then if it goes lower by more uh Drew same story on Estee louder willhelm same story Estee louder uh Tim is asking which options we buy for Alibaba that&#39;s for my client&#39;s benefit but but they&#39;re are long long dated uh Matt in North Carolina very grateful for your advice uh okay so he&#39;s asking about Advanced Auto Parts Advanced Auto Parts has done everything that they said they were going to do uh so no change there we we at we top up a few shares every day that is weak um same thing with uh Goose no change there so far both companies have executed on everything they said they were going to execute since we got involved with the turnaround uh and the Market&#39;s just not ready look a Advance Auto told you that the next two quarters were going to be soft uh is that all priced in yet I don&#39;t know could go lower before it goes higher but you&#39;re moving into a period where all of the leverage small caps start to run so if it&#39;s not an egregious quarter and Shane o Kelly who has a history of winning with Home Depot Supply and we&#39;re betting on the jockey here turning around the supply chain rebuilding the relationships with the professionals I think it&#39;ll be okay there hasn&#39;t been an aut part supplier that&#39;s had a great quarter this quarter so it&#39;s probably not going to be fantastic but I look through and if you look at you know it&#39;s funny I remember when meta fell and I think we said at like yeah it was around uh 150 uh that we started saying it looked very interesting uh and we did nothing with it and we wound up buying Google and Amazon and made a ton of money on those um but it dropped you know at 150 it made sense on every economic metric just like uh Estee louder makes sense at $70 doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t go to $50 before it goes back to 200 so that&#39;s something you have to keep in mind to get the benefits of multi Baggers you got to deal with the short-term volatility which is why you use low to no leverage you know what you own uh and you stay on top of it you know it&#39;s interesting uh in the article of the week I go into extensive detail which is like I don&#39;t know 10% of what I do on a company if that um but it just gives you an idea like a starter point where to start to do stuff and I go into a tremendous amount of detail and it takes a tremendous amount of time and I do it because I&#39;m responsible for my client&#39;s money and generating returns over time so you get the benefit secondarily of that work my my clients get the benefit primarily from that work but I did notice that um a lot of people didn&#39;t even get through all this stuff because they&#39;re just looking for the quick cookie that they can eat and get their sugar high rather than doing work and that&#39;s a guaranteed formula to continually lose in life uh taking the shortcuts and the way I could tell that was based on how many people had viewed the article versus how many people had listened to the full interview with Brack and Daryl uh and it was like I want to say 100 to one so what it just tells me is is that the vast majority of participants were not detail oriented enough to take five minutes but they&#39;re willing to you know maybe willing to put their their money on that so for those of you who are kind of like do-it-yourselfers just note that you can&#39;t expect to get great results without a massive investment of time and understanding and that&#39;s why consistently on average the retail person gets shaken out at the bottom and they buy the top and they&#39;re chasing gold right now and they were chasing Invidia in the summer before it corrected 30% uh from June through through September um so look what we try to do\n\njts what are your thoughts on buying TLT here um either as a short-term tactical trade or longer term holding as part of fixed income allocation I think it&#39;s great I think we got a nice little pullback and I think we&#39;re ready to to flip the switch here uh Kyle philippo Vic says I know you said before you wouldn&#39;t consider uh I think think you just sent me the same question twice if that&#39s not the same person uh What uh blah blah blah do you see the dollar reversing anytime soon yes we covered that Sagar can kanakia uh asking about Capri which is the owner of Kors Versace Etc let&#39;s take a look at Capri CP r all right so they you know the stock is following their cash flow which has been not good their gross margins but not good uh I would have to understand these Brands better I mean it has come down a decent amount um let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet do a little bit of see if they&#39;re going to be a round to turn around so they got 200 million of cash let me make this a little bit smaller here 200 million of C and they have 1.2 billion of debt so a little bit lever there see still generating cash yeah I mean issue is is their sales are still below pre pandemic levels um I think this one is worth starting to do work but you&#39;re going to have to do a lot of work because it just seems like it&#39;s been uh a nonproductive asset for many many years I mean you&#39;re you&#39re basically it&#39;s been in kind of a downtrend never really catches up it seems like based on how the stock has acted over the that last decade it just appears to have consistently poor management and capital allocation so it just gives me pause that it&#39;s never really had a good run um so I&#39;d just be worried about that cigar I think your framework is close but I I think for me this one is probably a pass um even though it could work as a trade uh would you mind revisiting Sofi I David I have zero interest in Sofi so uh no I would mind it I appreciate you listening but it&#39;s not a stock for me and when I reemphasize that certain stocks are not for me uh there&#39;s a reason for it ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nMichael heidenrich uh enjoying the podcast and appreciate the useful information from week to week uh NTR okay NTR that&#39;s from Michael heyen Rick all right NTR okay all right so the stock has come down with cash flow and revenues this looks like a lot of the a stocks you know here here&#39;s another one though that&#39;s literally done nothing for 1520 years [Music] um let&#39;s just understand why is this a fertilizer company yeah these companies even Mosaic I keep looking at and Bungie was one they just never get runs they&#39;re just like these companies that keep per picking their head up and get smashed down like a whack-a-mole so it&#39;s not a good enough quality business it&#39;s too cyclical and unpredictable uh but I definitely see why you chose it and it probably works for a trade but uh it&#39;s not something I want to have capital in for multiple Years also in order to take advantage of the biotech Secor do you recommend ETFs xbi are there better Expressions to consider uh I like xbi because you can&#39;t really predict when things are going to get approved so you get a basket of them when the sector&#39;s out of favor and then rates go down and you make a ton of money so uh we still have a material position and uh it&#39;s halfway there and it&#39;s going to go another double I think not not a double but from where it I&#39;ll just pull it up xbi yeah so you had this huge draw down in 2022 and then it rallied and we thought we were Geniuses and then it went back and tested it and now it&#39;s breaking out uh and we think it&#39;s going to you know work its way higher up to 120 140 and then we&#39;ll see what the world looks like there and maybe it pushes back to New highs over the next couple of years so uh so we like this it&#39;s moved a lot we&#39;re grateful for that but we do think that there&#39;s a lot more left in this investment so we&#39;re pretty excited about that thanks Bob Allan bod uh thanks turn around Tom for sharing your wisdom with us on the weekly although this is an a turnaround have you looked at Universal Music Group uh Bill

      "so we have will Ferell on the horse with the PayPal app and we have the Vans the new vans that I got uh last week and the company doing incredibly well as it relates to **PayPal** uh they beat on the bottom line and raised Guidance the revenue Miss was due to intentionally discontinuing brain tree Revenue that was either low margin or no margin business this Wall Street Journal article by telis demos which is also a superlative publication uh summarizes why the stock was red after reporting earnings and why it might see a lot of green in the future so uh as he says **PayPal** says it is sacrificing some volume growth to focus on the more profitable payment flows the market doesn&#39;t like the look for that for now but investors may come to embrace it if similar moves at other payment players are any guide so what they&#39;ve done is brain free is the non-branded stuff they&#39;ve increased the margin by adding value Services the different checkout we&#39;ve discussed the data business all the other things so they can make it a high margin business the part of the business that they were pushing through there that is low to no margin they&#39;ve just decided we like we&#39;ll just take 80% of your business that&#39;s profitable you can give the no margin business to someone else so the Wall Street Wall Street got upset that revenues didn&#39;t grow as fast but again this is exactly what they did with the unprofitable customers in Latin America you remember when he came came in he just fired them all and now they&#39;re back to Growing profitable customers and they&#39;re back to 432 million he&#39;s doing the same with this side of B with this side of the business and Tellis says um similar shifts in emphasis have been winning moves for shares of other payments players lately including a firm by now pay later provider its Shares are up 149% over the last 12 months Aiden which spooked the markets in 2023 by warning about increase in competition and commoditization in payments likewise shifted focus and has seen its shares jump 128% in the past year so uh this is a proven Playbook Alex Chris will do it better than all these folks have done but in the interim he had total payment volume up 9% net revenues up 6% uh operating income 1.5 billion up 18% operating margin up 18% um uh sorry uh 18.8% up 194 basis points transaction margin dollars up 8% and uh raising their full year non Gap guidance so all of these things are clicking um their teams drove transaction margin dollar growth and brain free because they cut off the unprofitable Revenue started contributing again to margin dollar growth which they hadn&#39;t before um they also ramped up fast lane and improved the Branded experience across the US Partnerships with key players like f serve Aiden Amazon Global Payments and Shopify these are all new Partnerships that have taken on their fast lane because it&#39;s better than anything else and it dramatically improves conversion for everyone so they&#39;re licensing it because they can&#39;t duplicate it and that&#39;s what makes **PayPal** um just leaving the station uh guidance raised for the full year reflects not only the third quarter outperformance but also a constructive a slightly more constructive view of the fourth quarter compared to what was implied in our last guide in July this is driven by more favorable view of transaction margin dollar growth which we plan to reinvest near-term back into strategic initiatives and marketing that are aimed at driving long-term durable growth I.E some of that&#39;s going into Will Ferrell&#39;s pocket to hop around on horses and tell everyone that he wants to pay from everywhere with all the rewards apps and the venmo and the **PayPal** app and getting mobile right and this is very much like Facebook in 2016 when everyone said they didn&#39;t get mobile they missed it and then they got it and everything took off **PayPal** is doing the same thing with payments their mobile game is going to the top shelf from the bottom uh basement floor is where it was when he took over free cash flow from operations one was 1 point6 billion and free cash flow was 1.4 billion uh so they continue to buy back stock they returned 1.8 billion to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 28 million shares of stock this thing is going to continue to generate more and more cash and continue need to shrink the float and one day you&#39;re going to wake up and it&#39;s $130 and then it&#39;s $180 and then it&#39;s $200 and everyone says wow I remember that when that was a $58 stock when uh Tom was talking about it on his podcast I can&#39;t believe it the some of these things are obvious you just have to be patient and you have to be in the game so it&#39;s had this big move from 58 or 60 to 80 now it&#39;s got going to consolidate in the high 70s before making the next move up but uh the key is it&#39;s it&#39;s gotten through the hard stuff and now it&#39;s going to continue to uh raise guidance continue to execute continue to uh build profitable sustainable growth and you can see on a line by line basis everything is moving in the right direction whether it happens too quickly on one metric for the Wall Street cell side or not quickly enough because people can&#39;t wait two or three months does not concern me I have a great company at an unbelievable basis and uh and we&#39;re going to ride this thing um just like will frell on his horse paying from everywhere you can see him in the ad there 1 million new **PayPal** debit card enrollments since September launch I mean you can&#39;t make this stuff up it just everything is humming here TR um active accounts are up monthly active accounts active accounts number of payment transactions up transactions per active account are up 9% so not only are more people using it the people are using it are using it more frequently because they&#39;re giving them more rewards more cash back than anywhere else and um and that stuff starts to multiply geometrically uh I want to go through some of these here uh evolve from a disparate payment products and point Solutions into a powerful Commerce platform as we Shi from payments company to a Commerce platform more of the world&#39;s leading Commerce players have partnered with us to add value for our mutual customers over the past two months we&#39;ve announced Partnerships with f serve 8 addan Amazon Global Payments and Shopify and we&#39;re actively discussing more collaborations in the industry these new and expanded relationships are clear demonstration our brand and Innovations and momentum are resonating uh so that&#39;s that new product experience are resulting on average more than 100 basis points of conversion lift for the vaulted checkout and up to 400 basis points of conversion upli uplift for onetime checkout we&#39;re also seeing a 15 to 20% increase in buy now pay later use so all this stuff ladies and gentlem is staggering how quickly they are ramping it up and getting it adopted um second consecutive quarter in more than two years that brain tree is meaningfully contributing to transaction margin dollar growth that came from doing those things that um Street was angry at them for doing which is basically firing non-profitable negative yielding business and only dealing with profitable higher margin business by adding value ad versus being a commodity provider uh the scale of customers who are primed to spend with **PayPal** puts us way ahead of other guest checkout Solutions and is one of the reasons why so many platforms are choosing to partner with us we can&#39;t wait to get fast lane into the hands of more merchants not only on brain tree and ppcp but also through our Partnerships with f serve addan Global Payments next year moving to small and medium-sized businesses last months we B launch **PayPal** complete uh oh complete payments in new geographies including China and Hong Kong with more markets on the horizon in 2025 so they&#39;ve just launched in China and Hong Kong ladies and gentlemen that could be very constructive for them in the context of the China recovery the TR China stimulus and the um China uh consumer coming back so that&#39;s a that&#39;s a positive thing um in the **PayPal** debit card in addition these debit card users are now choosing **PayPal** brand to check out more frequently when they shop online early data from our existing customers shows a 5x increase in total omnis spend within the first two weeks of sign up so I mean these are things you don&#39;t hear anywhere else I I mean this is this is the key the the cell side was pissed off about transaction take rate declined by four basis points to 167 compared to uh three basis point decline last quarter but they talk about the improvements in brain chain venmo monetization that&#39;ll come back **PayPal** generated 1.4 billion of free cash flow"
