[58.0s] girls weekend. and we went to a music
[59.76s] festival on the beach by our house

[145.959s] unbelievable. Uh, Robert became a seven
[148.56s] index in three years. Talk about an
[150.72s] athlete. And then Blake is lighting it
[153.36s] up. I mean, Blake is Blake&#39;s going to be
[156.48s] a plus by the end of the year. I can see
[158.16s] it. Uh, he is just on his game. It was
[161.92s] so great to get together. It was super
[163.68s] windy. Wind windy. It was a little bit
[165.12s] of castaway weather for us. My game on
[167.519s] the other hand was uh not good. It comes
[170.0s] and it goes and uh in the case of
[172.0s] Saturday morning coming off the delayed

[180.879s] a.m. uh it it didn&#39;t come together for
[183.28s] me for as an understatement this
[184.879s] morning. Got to join uh that&#39;s Mr.
[187.68s] Wonderful Kevin Oolir. Uh super nice guy
[192.319s] by the way in the green room. He was
[194.319s] beyond nice. I told him, &quot;Look, I got to
[196.08s] get a picture or my daughters are not
[197.44s] going to let me back in the house.&quot; And
[198.64s] he was like, &quot;Of course.&quot; And uh we
[200.64s] talked about some things. He was just in
[203.44s] uh the Middle East and I&#39;m going next
[205.68s] week. So uh shared some stories from
[208.319s] that and really nice to meet him. That&#39;s
[210.4s] at the New York Stock Exchange. That&#39;s
[212.48s] Kristen Scher&#39;s booth at the New York
[214.239s] Stock Exchange. That&#39;s Fox and Friends
[216.239s] outside the Fox studio. This is the
[218.72s] building for the newer people joining
[220.48s] us. Uh, this is one of my favorite
[222.64s] people in the world. Besides Stu, of
[224.64s] course, is Yasha. She makes uh everyone
[227.04s] look beautiful, even the ugliest of
[228.959s] mugs. Good job, Yasha. Um, this is the
[232.56s] New York Stock Exchange. This is Diane

[240.56s] on with her. And of course, Kristen
[242.72s] Scher. Uh, absolutely awesome time
[245.519s] seeing you down there. Uh, and then I
[248.08s] said, &quot;Hey, if you get swag, the hedge
[251.12s] fund tip swag, if you want to send in a
[254.08s] a photo, we&#39;ve gotten dozens upon dozens
[256.639s] of orders, starting to get the photos
[258.239s] come in as the orders are delivered. Not
[260.0s] everyone&#39;s going to want to send photos,
[261.199s] but I wanted to shout out John Croner.
[264.16s] He&#39;s been a supporter for several years,
[266.639s] three plus years he&#39;s been listening to
[268.479s] the podcast and he was the first one to
[270.72s] send in his picture with his hat, with
[273.12s] his mug, with his Baba and Cooper
[275.199s] standard screen parabolic move. Uh this
[278.16s] is a successful businessman from the
[280.32s] Midwest. His Babas chart going parabolic
[283.04s] moving back up. So super excited for
[285.12s] you. We&#39;ll get together, you know, five,
[286.96s] 10 of those in the next month and uh
[288.88s] post them here under number one hedge
[291.6s] fund tip number one hedge fund podcast

[305.52s] there. I&#39;m wearing mine today as well.
[307.36s] Don&#39;t leave home without it. Then, uh we
[311.12s] had the chance to
[317.199s] uh go
[318.919s] on which was absolutely awesome
[323.24s] with Kevin Oolir and the great Stu Vney
[328.4s] and uh talk about inflation, talk about
[331.199s] the Fed. I want to thank Christian
[333.919s] Dagger and Stuart Vney for that. We&#39;re
[336.24s] going to listen in here. Yeah, I can use
[339.12s] some of that. Uh let&#39;s get to the latest
[341.28s] read on inflation. Here we go. cooler
[343.12s] than expected in April. Consumer prices
[345.36s] up 2.3% in the last 12 months. Core
[348.4s] inflation that removes food and energy
[350.96s] up 2.8% the last 12 months. I want to
[353.84s] show you consumer energy prices. They
[356.0s] came down nearly 4% compared to the same
[358.72s] time last year. That&#39;s a sign that
[360.479s] Trump&#39;s plan to unleash American energy
[362.639s] is beginning to work. Tom Hayes joining
[365.12s] me to cover the market. Has the
[366.8s] inflation news uh from today kicked us
[369.52s] into another rally mode? I think so. I
[372.4s] think, look, we&#39;ve had the mother of all
[375.12s] short squeezes. In the beginning of
[376.8s] April, there were record forced sellers
[379.919s] until Trump put out that tweet on April
[381.759s] 9th. He said, &quot;Now&#39;s a good time to buy
[383.12s] stocks.&quot; The market&#39;s up 14%. Now you
[386.08s] have record forced buyers. And I&#39;ll tell
[388.4s] you what, with these inflation numbers,
[390.4s] I think too late Powell is going to be a
[392.56s] real thing. Inflation is lower than it
[394.639s] was in September when they cut 50 basis
[396.88s] points emergency cut. They&#39;re 150 basis
[399.84s] points too restrictive right now. So I
[402.08s] think you&#39;re going to see those odds
[403.36s] come back a little bit for June even
[405.28s] though they went out to September as of
[407.12s] the last few weeks. And I think there&#39;s
[409.039s] huge opportunity here. Then you take
[411.199s] earnings. We&#39;re double what was expected
[413.6s] this quarter in spite of all the
[415.319s] uncertainty. Guidance has held strong.
[417.52s] So we&#39;re very constructive on this
[419.28s] market. Every new trade deal creates
[421.84s] more forced buyers that sold $1.1
[425.52s] trillion dollars of equities at the
[427.759s] exact low in early April. Did you know
[430.56s] that you picked up my habit of
[432.4s] emphasizing points? I do that all the
[434.96s] time. I copy the best.
[437.44s] Both drummers.
[439.28s] So, okay, let&#39;s summarize here. Second
[441.68s] half of the year going into the second
[444.0s] half of the year, you see a nice rally
[445.599s] going. Yeah. And I think it&#39;s going to
[446.96s] be under the surface. If you look at
[448.319s] equal weight relative to cap weight,
[451.039s] there&#39;s huge opportunities. So many of
[452.479s] these companies that were hit by the
[454.24s] perception of tariffs, which is no
[455.84s] longer an excuse for the Fed because
[457.28s] they cut the tariffs, uh are are down
[460.08s] 50%, 60%. And these are great companies
[462.479s] that have made it through many cycles
[464.4s] that are going to come back and they&#39;re
[465.84s] going to come back very strong. Look at
[467.199s] Stanley Black &amp; Decker yesterday, up 17%
[470.639s] after the China deal was announced. Home
[472.8s] building is going to come back the
[473.919s] second half when uh Bessant works on the
[477.199s] long end of the curve with the SLR. Uh
[480.0s] that&#39;s going to bring down the 10-year
[481.52s] Treasury by 30 to 70 basis points and
[484.56s] you&#39;re going to see a boom in housing
[487.28s] construction also as Trump opens up
[489.84s] federal lands for starter homes. You
[491.599s] have become our resident
[493.16s] bully actually. But that&#39;s all good
[495.28s] stuff. Tom, thanks very much indeed.
[496.96s] Thank you, sir. uh House Republicans
[498.72s] just under and we&#39;re back. And then
[501.84s] yesterday I had a chance to go on the
[503.52s] Big Money Show and do the full hour with
[507.84s] Taylor Riggs, Brian Brenberg, Jackie
[511.44s] D&#39;Angelus, Dean McDow on Fox Business.
[515.2s] This was awesome. Uh thanks to Stephen
[517.279s] for cutting down the 40 minutes to the
[519.2s] most important eight minutes. Uh so
[521.12s] we&#39;re going to listen in here.
[523.44s] Welcome back to the second hour of the
[525.279s] Big Money Show. So, I&#39;m David McDow
[526.88s] joined by my co-host Taylor Riggs, Brian
[529.36s] Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, and joining
[531.6s] us for this hour, Great Hill Capital
[534.12s] Chairman Thomas Hayes.
[537.24s] Mark Thomas, how do you invest in this
[540.08s] kind of environment? Because it is a
[542.72s] market that is very much driven by what
[546.88s] the White House is doing. So, it&#39;s uh
[550.92s] trade, tariffs, trade negotiations.
[554.24s] Where does this go from here in 90 days
[556.64s] when the reciprocal tariffs uh on all
[559.76s] the other nations expire in July? But
[562.64s] then the president also comes out with
[565.04s] this uh order on prescription drugs.
[568.88s] Yeah. And if we can take a look at the
[571.12s] prescription drug stocks coming up in a
[573.36s] minute. You&#39;re you&#39;re really invested
[576.72s] based on I don&#39;t want to say whims, but
[578.959s] certainly the
[580.519s] maneuvering of the White House. And if
[583.839s] this was so
[585.399s] bad, wouldn&#39;t the drug makers be much
[588.0s] lower? That&#39;s ab absolutely right. I
[590.8s] think what Charles said about a lot of
[592.24s] people resisting it is so true. Do you
[594.24s] know right at the lows in early April,
[597.2s] you had one record selling in the hole
[599.6s] by hedge funds and by CTAs. They sold
[602.6s] $1.1 trillion of equities at the lows in
[606.399s] April. So now what you have as you&#39;ve
[608.399s] had this quick move up and then today
[610.0s] the good news is you have a whole slew
[612.8s] of forced buyers that are not only
[615.519s] covering their shorts but are forced to
[618.079s] chase up. So that is going to persist
[620.32s] for a little bit. And then you couple it
[622.48s] with the fact that even in the face of
[624.32s] all this uncertainty and all the
[626.0s] headlines that you mentioned, Dan, um
[628.8s] earnings came in twice as good as
[630.56s] expected,
[631.72s] 13.4% earnings growth versus 6%
[634.6s] estimated. Uh estimates didn&#39;t even come
[637.36s] down that much for 2025. They came down
[639.6s] from 270 to 265 about
[642.76s] 3.6%. But 2026 held up in the face of
[646.48s] this. So now that the floodgates are
[648.88s] open that they&#39;ve kind of resolved this,
[651.12s] this looks like a reasonable path
[652.72s] forward. Uh now now managements can can
[656.079s] have some confidence in moving ahead
[657.44s] with investment, moving ahead with the
[659.2s] different projects that they had on
[660.64s] hold. Uh and we&#39;re going to get through
[662.48s] this. Hard to paper, which they are. Um
[666.079s] then that the market could see some
[667.839s] disappointment. I would say one thing
[669.519s] about that, Jackie, it&#39;s like Warren
[670.88s] Buffett always said, if you wait for for
[672.48s] the Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring.
[674.8s] So, you know, we did a we did a
[676.72s] conference call with our clients on
[678.32s] April 7th when things looked really
[680.16s] really dark and we went company by
[682.72s] company and we went through their free
[684.56s] cash flow. We went through their
[685.92s] revenues. We went through their balance
[687.519s] sheet and we said, &quot;Look, this is
[689.44s] headline headline noise. These are
[692.0s] durable businesses that have made it
[693.68s] through multiple cycles. So, ignore the
[696.32s] short-term headlines. Yes, there, you
[698.64s] know, it&#39;s creating a lot of volatility.
[700.399s] You know what? They survive the most
[702.0s] high rates.&quot; Yeah. Well, I think Bessant
[705.6s] is on top of that, managing the long end
[708.0s] of the curve. They&#39;re going to
[708.88s] deregulate the banks. They&#39;re the banks
[710.8s] are going to be back in the market and
[712.16s] he&#39;s going to be able to take control of
[713.6s] the long end of the curve. Uh I remember
[715.76s] when the 10-year yield went up to 480
[717.76s] and everyone was saying 5% 5%. I said,
[720.079s] &quot;We&#39;re going below four before we go
[722.24s] above five.&quot; And I&#39;m holding true to
[724.16s] that. And I think the second half, the
[726.16s] biggest surprise in the second half of
[727.76s] this year is going to be you&#39;re going to
[730.8s] see mortgage rates, 30-year fixed rates
[733.519s] under 6%. And you&#39;re going to see a boom
[735.76s] in housing and construction and
[737.92s] suppliers to housing that we haven&#39;t
[739.68s] seen in years. And that&#39;s going to be uh
[742.519s] fueled by the Taylor Rigs of the world
[745.519s] that are having new families, moving out
[747.519s] to the suburbs, uh having the buying a
[751.68s] house, buying extra
[754.2s] cars is there. You bet. Get here and get
[757.519s] a good tax cut done with corporate tax
[759.519s] cuts. Man, I might be with you in the
[761.839s] second half of this year that it could
[763.12s] be really impressive. Yeah, there
[764.72s] there&#39;s no question. You know, it&#39;s
[766.24s] interesting. Trump put out that tr tweet
[768.48s] or truth on April 8th and he said now&#39;s
[770.959s] a good time to buy stocks and that was
[773.12s] the bottom and it absolutely rallied and
[776.0s] then last week he did the same thing. He
[777.92s] said watch out you know there was a
[779.76s] little uncertainty last week before the
[781.279s] UK deal. Watch out America is going to
[783.839s] boom and that was the intermediate term
[785.76s] bottom. So you got to listen to the
[787.12s] president. This guy is is on fire. I
[789.2s] mean, his calls have have been working
[791.6s] uh and uh and it&#39;s substantiated by
[793.6s] earnings and now we&#39;re getting certainty
[794.88s] and I think we move to growth just like
[796.639s] Brian was referencing when we start the
[799.04s] tax massive tax cuts and the
[801.6s] deregulation with banks with industry
[804.16s] with bringing manufacturing make it easy
[805.92s] to get zoning and and so on. So, so this
[808.959s] is 30 years old until they do that when
[811.68s] I now have parents asking if Newark is
[814.8s] no longer safe. What does that mean then
[817.04s] for consumer confidence? And then does
[818.72s] that urge Congress to step up? I think
[820.959s] they will step up. You know, you used to
[822.48s] fly into New New York airport uh and
[824.88s] Trump used to say it&#39;s like the third
[826.72s] world country. They were ugly. They were
[828.72s] dim. They were outdated. They were old.
[831.279s] They eventually got them fixed. JFK
[833.2s] looks pretty nice. Looks pretty nice.
[836.0s] New York is starting to to come around.
[838.079s] I sat in the airport in Orange County on
[840.72s] Friday. Bump bump bump bump. United to
[843.68s] Newark. I that was my direct flight all
[845.76s] the time. Once a month I come out here.
[847.44s] Um, I wound up I was supposed to be here
[850.16s] three o&#39;clock in Newark. I got to
[852.8s] LaGuardia at like midnight. Um, so it&#39;s
[855.68s] just part of the thing. They rerouted
[857.279s] me. They&#39;ll work it out. I will not be
[859.04s] flying into New York for the next few
[860.48s] months. I&#39;ll be flying into JFK or
[862.44s] LaGuardia. But as far as consumer
[864.56s] confidence, I think they&#39;ll just adjust.
[866.399s] They&#39;ll adapt. They&#39;ll get things fixed.
[868.56s] They&#39;ll get the money from Congress
[870.0s] probably quicker than we expect because
[871.68s] a lot of people have been hurt by this.
[873.76s] Uh, and we&#39;ll move forward. Uh, from an
[875.92s] investor standpoint, I would use the
[877.44s] opportunity. Any dip in high quality
[879.36s] airlines is an opportunity to buy.
[881.519s] Consumer confidence with these trade
[883.12s] deals is going to come back. Travel is
[885.44s] going to accelerate into the summer like
[887.04s] it does every single year. Uh, and uh,
[889.6s] and we&#39;ll be looking for opportunities.
[891.279s] Oh, you&#39;re so glass. Half full today.
[893.519s] Opportunities in the crisis. He&#39;s very
[896.0s] optimistic. Constantly on the phone,
[898.0s] which is so disruptive to your sleep
[899.68s] cycle. So, that&#39;s what I need to work
[901.76s] on. Well, you could just become a golfer
[903.68s] because if you pull your phone out while
[905.12s] you&#39;re golfing, people will look give
[906.88s] you the evil eye. Do not mess up the
[909.04s] round. So, I do it in small doses, four
[911.199s] hours at a time, but beyond that, I
[912.959s] think if I was disconnected for one day
[915.279s] or two days, my clients would fire me.
[917.04s] So, uh I need to be available, but four
[918.88s] hours at a time. Even at the retreat,
[920.639s] you get to use the phone in your room.
[922.48s] Yeah. So, you wouldn&#39;t disconnect. If
[924.32s] you send your clients on the retreat,
[925.76s] then they&#39;ll never contact you.
[927.6s] The best of all worlds. Dan, this one in
[930.24s] theory doesn&#39;t have to report to an
[932.0s] office, but it&#39;s because your computer
[933.92s] is right here. That&#39;s right. With with
[936.0s] opportunity comes responsibility. So, if
[938.32s] you can be out and about, you can be on
[940.079s] on your life, you know, doing your life,
[942.32s] but available. It&#39;s kind of a good blend
[944.8s] and flexibility. People have uh more
[947.279s] flexible lives. They can pick up their
[949.04s] kids at soccer practice, but still be
[950.8s] plugged in, answer emails if it&#39;s during
[952.72s] work hours. So, we just have to kind of
[954.8s] weigh the pros and the cons. And I think
[956.16s] just shut it off at certain times,
[957.68s] particularly when you&#39;re playing golf or
[959.36s] or uh or on the weekend or certainly in
[962.079s] bed. Maybe maybe get a white lotus box
[964.72s] outside your bedroom door and you drop
[966.399s] the phone in before you go. I&#39;m zooming
[968.32s] back over a trillion dollars in market
[970.24s] value with the stock rallying to its
[971.839s] highest level since February. Um I just
[974.48s] want to get your take, final thoughts.
[976.48s] You were very optimistic, glass half
[978.24s] full on this market. Um you think we
[980.399s] continue to rally from here? I think
[981.92s] we&#39;re going to get some follow through
[982.959s] in the next few days. I think everyone&#39;s
[984.8s] going to come into the market finally.
[986.24s] All the holdouts, all the people short
[988.16s] covering, they&#39;re going to chase up and
[989.839s] then we&#39;ll get some consolidation
[991.44s] probably a few days out, some sideways
[993.6s] grind, maybe a few percent pullback just
[995.6s] to punish the Johnny come lately and
[997.279s] then we push to new highs. I don&#39;t know
[998.8s] if that&#39;s in a couple of months or three
[1000.56s] or four, but that&#39;s the trajectory that
[1002.24s] we&#39;re on for sure. All right, we and
[1004.56s] we&#39;re back then. I and by the way I want
[1007.839s] to thank Madison Myrtto and Cassie
[1010.959s] Loloff for having me on the show in
[1012.959s] addition to obviously Taylor, Brian,
[1014.48s] Jackie and Dan. Uh then I had the chance
[1017.36s] to join Kristen Scher. Want to thank
[1020.16s] Kristen and Mill Montana. We&#39;re going to
[1022.56s] listen in here. Joining me now to talk
[1024.72s] more about these markets amid some very
[1027.28s] busy overnight action including at least
[1030.16s] in temporary trade deal between the US
[1032.24s] and China is Thomas Hayes. He&#39;s a chair
[1034.079s] and managing member at Greyhill Capital.
[1036.16s] Thomas, always great to have you on the
[1037.839s] show. I think last time you joined us,
[1039.679s] you were pretty bullish and since then,
[1041.12s] we&#39;ve seen the S&amp;P 500 rise. What do you
[1044.559s] make of this deal and where it puts us
[1046.559s] for equities? This is a landmark deal.
[1050.48s] This is a landmark morning. Uh
[1052.88s] particularly, here&#39;s the phrase of the
[1054.24s] day, trapped bears. Okay, we had record
[1058.32s] selling. $1.1 trillion was sold at the
[1061.84s] absolute lows in early April by hedge
[1064.88s] funds and CTAs. Now they&#39;re forced to
[1067.76s] cover. They&#39;re forced buyers. They&#39;re
[1069.44s] forced to chase up. You couple that with
[1072.559s] record amounts of buyback announcements.
[1075.96s] 665 billion of buybacks announced. These
[1079.2s] guys are in trouble. Okay, let let&#39;s
[1081.76s] just put it that way. As they chase up.
[1083.36s] So, I think we&#39;re going to get some
[1084.24s] follow through for the next few days.
[1086.16s] Once everyone gets in the boat 3 4 days
[1088.48s] from now we probably start to get a
[1090.559s] little bit of consolidation a little bit
[1092.16s] of pullback for the Johnny come lately.
[1094.0s] That&#39;s just the way it always works.
[1095.28s] Yeah. So what does this tell us? Has it
[1098.16s] been a change in true direction or is
[1100.559s] this still a very dynamic trading
[1103.28s] market? Yeah. I you know it&#39;s
[1105.76s] interesting. I look at earnings and
[1108.24s] earnings in the face of all of this
[1110.32s] uncertainty and all the let&#39;s be candid
[1112.72s] chaos that was going on for a couple of
[1114.559s] months. uh came in so much better than
[1116.88s] expected 13.4% versus 6% estimated with
[1120.4s] 90 90% recorded. Then you look at the
[1122.88s] guidance estimates didn&#39;t come down that
[1125.28s] much. They came down from 270 to 265
[1128.52s] 3.6% reduction. But 2026 held up at
[1132.96s] $300, which means we&#39;re only trading at
[1135.039s] 18.5 times compared to 18.3 times for
[1139.44s] the last 10year average. So there&#39;s a
[1142.24s] lot to do. I think you got to really
[1143.52s] start to look at the things that were
[1144.72s] hit hardest by tariffs are going to be
[1146.72s] the greatest recovery opportunities. And
[1148.48s] already we&#39;re seeing some of these
[1149.44s] semiconductors, technology names,
[1151.28s] riskier stocks, ones with a higher beta,
[1153.679s] certainly ones that sold off
[1154.88s] dramatically. I think the semiconductor
[1156.64s] index at one point was down 40% um in
[1159.36s] that April 2nd announcement. Those seem
[1161.2s] to be the ones coming back the most. Is
[1162.96s] that what you see? I think so. The other
[1164.88s] thing I&#39;m looking at is cyclicals
[1167.44s] relative to defensives is at a record
[1170.32s] all-time low positioning. So cyclicals,
[1173.039s] we start to look at consumer
[1174.08s] discretionary, we start to look at
[1175.36s] industrials, we start to look at
[1176.919s] materials. Uh maybe you even start to,
[1179.679s] you know, look a little bit over at
[1181.039s] energy because you you noted this
[1183.76s] morning that the S&amp;P was up certain
[1185.44s] percent, the Dow was up a certain
[1186.799s] percent. You know, was up more than all
[1188.32s] of them. Russell Small Cap index,
[1191.12s] largest short interest on record. So if
[1193.84s] this the game is on is really what it
[1196.0s] comes down to. And I and I think you&#39;ll
[1197.44s] see it in the indices for sure, but
[1199.28s] there are so many stocks that are still
[1200.88s] down 50%, 60%, 70% that are great
[1203.919s] businesses that have been around for
[1205.12s] decades that are going to start to fly.
[1207.28s] Interesting. Other particular stocks on
[1209.44s] your radar? Yeah. Uh Disney, we came out
[1212.08s] publicly like 3 4 weeks ago. It was a
[1213.6s] no-brainer. We said buy Disney at $85.
[1216.64s] Of course, the next few days it went
[1217.919s] down to like $82 because that&#39;s what
[1219.6s] always happens. But now it&#39;s at 108.
[1222.0s] It&#39;s going to continue to climb over the
[1223.679s] next two years, probably over 200 in our
[1225.76s] view. Uh, every all of their segments
[1228.159s] are growing at mid- teens, double
[1230.08s] digits. They just put guidance out for
[1232.799s] $17 billion of cash from operations this
[1235.679s] year. So, this is this is a well-run
[1237.72s] business. 180 million streaming
[1240.159s] subscribers. They grew 2.5 million. So,
[1243.28s] there&#39;s a lot of good things happen
[1244.32s] there. They&#39;ll continue to invest. We we
[1246.159s] saw the park in Abu Dhabi. They&#39;ll
[1248.159s] continue to invest in the cruise ships
[1249.52s] which have a very high return on
[1251.039s] invested capital like mid20s return on
[1253.44s] invested capital. So that business is
[1255.12s] going to continue to grow. And then the
[1256.96s] second one I have uh no one is going to
[1259.84s] buy when I when I when I put out this
[1261.919s] name. They&#39;re all going to like you know
[1264.159s] say this guy&#39;s crazy. And then a year
[1265.84s] from now we&#39;re going to be back on and
[1267.039s] be like do you remember last year? It&#39;s
[1269.039s] called Albamar. It&#39;s the number one
[1271.039s] lithium producer positioning for
[1273.12s] materials. materials is going to have
[1274.559s] the highest earnings growth, second
[1276.08s] highest earnings growth in 2026. You&#39;re
[1278.0s] getting positioned ahead of time.
[1279.36s] Lithium isn&#39;t a glut. Everyone thinks
[1281.039s] EVs are done except for the fact the US
[1283.36s] is 10% of the market. China is 60% of
[1285.52s] the market. It&#39;s not a natural market.
[1287.28s] It is a subsidized market. It is policy
[1289.6s] initiative. They grew EV sales 38% last
[1292.559s] month. Albamaro&#39;s lowest cost producer.
[1294.799s] They&#39;ve got these mines in Chile and
[1296.72s] they&#39;ve got $3.1 billion of liquidity to
[1299.039s] ride this out. So as all the smaller
[1300.64s] players go out of business as prices are
[1302.88s] down that shrinks supply album is left
[1305.84s] standing and the operating leverage is
[1307.76s] huge. This one you know we talked about
[1309.6s] Disney going up whatever it was a double
[1312.0s] plus from from this thing can go up a
[1313.84s] lot more than that over the next 3 to 5
[1315.919s] years as the the market demand for
[1318.4s] lithium from 1.2 million metric tonses
[1321.12s] today to 3.2 two just in five years. And
[1324.48s] and uh so we&#39;re not looking at a triple
[1326.72s] because the operating leverage in that
[1328.32s] business could be a lot more than that.
[1329.84s] So that&#39;s a good one. It&#39;s a long-term
[1331.36s] one. It&#39;s whatever $61 today. I&#39;m sure
[1333.76s] it&#39;ll go to 55 tomorrow, but a year from
[1336.24s] now it&#39;s going to be a lot higher. I can
[1337.84s] tell you that right now. And now where
[1339.12s] is the demand coming from, Thomas? You
[1340.72s] see it around the world or specifically
[1342.24s] in China? Predominantly China. Also, it
[1345.12s] it is going to be around the world
[1346.24s] because it is a cyclical thing, but also
[1348.24s] energy storage is a big component to
[1350.159s] this. It&#39;s not just EVs and as you need
[1352.96s] more and more of these devices and you
[1354.72s] need uh the demand is unlimited for this
[1358.08s] and and the tariffs really hit it. The
[1360.159s] glut in the cycle really hit it. But you
[1361.84s] know what? If you look at the long-term
[1362.96s] chart, this happens every 3 to 5 years
[1364.88s] for Albamaro. It happens every 3 to 5
[1366.799s] years for lithium. They have a few other
[1368.48s] businesses that&#39;ll support them through
[1369.84s] this. But they&#39;ll be the last man
[1371.52s] standing and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll reap all
[1372.799s] the benefits as we recover. You know,
[1374.32s] it&#39;s interesting. Um it&#39;s obvious right
[1376.48s] based on the market observations that we
[1378.72s] can see that the president is able to
[1380.96s] move the markets with his commentary and
[1383.28s] changes in policy. There is one other
[1385.919s] factor though and that&#39;s the Federal
[1387.84s] Reserve and how it decides to respond to
[1390.32s] these policy changes as well as some of
[1392.159s] the economic data that we&#39;ll get this
[1394.08s] week. What does that mean for the
[1396.159s] markets? The fact that the latest
[1398.0s] indication from Jerome Pal is that he is
[1400.0s] going to take his time. Yeah, I you know
[1402.72s] it&#39;s interesting. I was thinking about
[1404.72s] that on the way down here. Uh I was
[1407.039s] pretty certain we were going to have two
[1409.039s] cuts this year at the back half of the
[1410.48s] year. Uh moving forward, you know, if
[1413.919s] this continues in the same vein, I think
[1416.08s] one cut, we&#39;re probably still going to
[1418.0s] wind up with two cuts because we&#39;ll get
[1419.44s] this initial high and then we&#39;re going
[1420.72s] to say, well, you know what, there was
[1422.159s] some short-term damage done to small
[1424.48s] businesses. It&#39;s going to take them a
[1425.919s] couple quarters to recover. So, I think
[1427.76s] one to two is still a safe bet this
[1430.0s] year. I think Besson&#39;s working on the
[1431.76s] long end of the curve which is more
[1433.039s] important as it relates to housing as it
[1434.799s] relates to refinancing the debt. Uh so
[1437.36s] all in all very sanglin here and uh
[1440.159s] pleased to see this. It did come a bit
[1442.799s] sooner than we expected. So uh so we&#39;re
[1444.96s] we&#39;re we&#39;re not arguing about that
[1446.799s] that&#39;s for sure. All right, Thomas Hayes
[1448.799s] is a chair and managing member at
[1450.32s] Greyhill Capital joining me in studio on
[1452.32s] a very busy market day. Um thank you so
[1454.64s] much Thomas. Thanks for having me
[1455.84s] Kristen.
[1458.24s] And we&#39;re back and finally we join Diane
[1461.44s] King Hall. Want to thank Heidi Schultz
[1463.6s] and Ally Thompson for having me on.
[1466.32s] We&#39;ll listen in now. Joined by Tom
[1468.32s] Hayes, chairman and managing member
[1470.4s] Great Hill Capital. Tom, thank you so
[1472.799s] much for joining us today. Let&#39;s start
[1474.72s] out with this 90day pause that we&#39;re
[1476.72s] getting between the US and China. I
[1478.24s] think this caught a lot of people by
[1480.32s] surprise because many I talked to
[1482.48s] weren&#39;t expecting to see this this fast.
[1484.88s] What&#39;s your reaction? Yeah, we we
[1487.2s] expected resolution. We didn&#39;t expect it
[1489.36s] this quickly. Uh it&#39;s it&#39;s unreal. And
[1492.159s] right now it&#39;s exacerbated by the fact
[1495.2s] that the phrase of the day is called
[1497.52s] trapped bears. Okay, we had record
[1501.039s] selling by hedge funds and CTAs at the
[1503.84s] absolute low in early April. So now the
[1507.2s] market&#39;s come so far so fast even before
[1510.12s] today and they were praying for a retest
[1513.84s] of the lows that never came. So now
[1515.679s] they&#39;ve got to buy up. They&#39;re forced
[1517.039s] buyers. They&#39;re forced covering. So this
[1519.52s] could probably get some continuation,
[1522.159s] some followthrough for the next few days
[1523.76s] because so many people are structurally
[1525.2s] off sides. So what are you expecting
[1527.12s] now? Cuz yes, you you made the point
[1528.799s] about trap bears before we had any deal
[1531.52s] on the table between the US and China.
[1533.52s] And all we had on the table was the
[1535.36s] framework of a deal between the US and
[1537.36s] and UK. So you call them the trap bears.
[1539.44s] How do you see this forced buyer dynamic
[1541.12s] playing out? Well, they got to catch up.
[1543.2s] And and what&#39;s interesting is who&#39;s been
[1545.279s] buying from these trap bears. We have a
[1548.08s] record amount of announced buybacks from
[1551.36s] companies.
[1552.44s] $665 billion. So, they&#39;re buying, these
[1555.679s] poor guys are trying to cover their
[1557.279s] shorts, trying to catch up, trying to
[1559.76s] chase up uh uh the rally. So, my guess
[1562.24s] is this is going to continue for a few
[1565.039s] days. They&#39;re going to force them in
[1566.96s] after a huge move off the bottom even
[1569.279s] before today. And then we&#39;ll probably
[1571.2s] get a little bit of volatility as people
[1572.799s] digest like oh we&#39;ve got 90 days etc
[1575.12s] etc. So expect a little shortterm
[1577.36s] material followthrough but it&#39;s very
[1579.2s] interesting on uh April 7th or April 8th
[1583.6s] Trump went out on truth or Twitter or
[1586.64s] whatever social media platform and he
[1588.72s] said now&#39;s the time to buy stocks and no
[1591.679s] one believed him and the next day the
[1594.159s] market went up. Last week he did the
[1596.32s] exact same thing when people were
[1597.84s] getting pessimistic before the UK deal
[1599.919s] and he said America is going to boom and
[1603.12s] he also referenced stocks. So if they
[1604.96s] say you know everyone was looking for
[1606.96s] the Fed put and the Treasury put the
[1609.76s] Trump put is real. He&#39;s paying
[1611.6s] attention. He listens to people and why
[1614.0s] we were optimistic and why we were
[1615.52s] positioned for this not to happen so
[1616.88s] soon but positioned for this to happen
[1619.12s] uh eventually is because he&#39;s shown and
[1622.4s] the administration has shown flexibility
[1625.2s] and and rationality throughout this
[1627.039s] process. He genuinely does want to
[1629.919s] negotiate better deals. And if you
[1631.76s] remember the first term, the people with
[1634.48s] assets like me that manage money, we did
[1637.6s] okay. It was a good four years. that
[1640.24s] everyday people that work every day, the
[1642.64s] middle class, the lower middle class,
[1644.72s] they did better than ever during those
[1646.799s] four years. And that&#39;s what President
[1648.4s] Trump wants to see. And it&#39;s deals like
[1650.4s] this and initiatives like this that is
[1652.32s] that is going to create that. You won&#39;t
[1653.84s] see it in a week, but over the next few
[1656.0s] months and couple years, you&#39;re going to
[1657.919s] start to see that middle class. We&#39;ve we
[1659.76s] have seen more flexibility come up than
[1662.159s] come to pass than we initially saw at
[1665.36s] the beginning of April. Um, but I do
[1667.679s] wonder if some of that is because of the
[1669.76s] leadership shift shift that we saw with
[1672.88s] essentially the Treasury Secretary with
[1674.88s] uh Besset leading versus Navaro. They
[1677.279s] did put Navaro in the closet for a few
[1678.96s] weeks which was, you know, a welcome
[1681.039s] reprieve uh by yours included. However,
[1685.2s] I will say I, you know, Lutnik did get
[1687.919s] the job done with the UK and that kind
[1690.32s] of paved the way for positive talks with
[1692.48s] Bessant over the weekend. So, I got to
[1695.52s] give credit where credit&#39;s due. And, uh,
[1697.84s] President Trump has made no bones about
[1700.32s] he wants to be recognized as one of the
[1702.399s] greatest presidents in history. If stuff
[1704.64s] like this continues to happen and him
[1707.279s] cleaning up methods, messes that have
[1709.6s] been going on for decades. I&#39;m not
[1710.96s] blaming anyone administration.
[1712.799s] Republican administrations, Democratic
[1715.0s] administrations neglected to do this. If
[1717.36s] he cleans this up, he&#39;s got a shot at
[1719.12s] his goal for sure. Okay. And let&#39;s talk
[1721.279s] about you mentioned the buybacks at
[1722.72s] record levels. Uh so how important is
[1725.6s] that in terms of driving momentum? Well,
[1728.159s] there&#39;s no question you&#39;ve got CTAs and
[1730.72s] hedge funds covering now chasing up now
[1733.64s] $665 billion of buyback announcements.
[1736.399s] Oh, and by the way, earnings in the face
[1738.799s] of all of this uncertainty and
[1740.799s] craziness, earnings were came in much
[1742.88s] better than expected. 13.4% earnings
[1745.679s] growth versus 6% estimates. And the
[1748.399s] forward guidance hasn&#39;t come down that
[1750.32s] much for 2020. Some of them have and
[1752.72s] then some haven&#39;t even given guidance.
[1754.399s] Yeah. Yeah. Fair. But listen, let&#39;s look
[1756.0s] at S&amp;P earnings for 2025 came down to,
[1759.679s] you know, basically from 270 to 265
[1762.08s] about 3.5% since the beginning of the
[1764.0s] year. That&#39;s pretty material. However,
[1766.08s] 2026 backend loaded still $300 a share
[1769.679s] of earnings, which implies we&#39;re trading
[1771.6s] at about 18 1.5 times compared to the
[1773.76s] 10-year average of 183. Okay, there&#39;s
[1776.0s] still things to do. And then so speaking
[1777.84s] of things to do, I know you have some
[1779.44s] picks. Um, you like Disney. Tell us
[1782.24s] about your thesis there and if you still
[1783.919s] like it. Yeah, it, you know, it&#39;s
[1785.679s] interesting. We were pounding the table
[1788.08s] publicly for Disney. It got down to like
[1790.0s] 85 and then after we went out buy it at
[1792.399s] 85. I think it went to like 83 or 81, of
[1794.559s] course. Uh, and now it&#39;s at 108. We
[1797.44s] think over the next two years, this is a
[1798.96s] $200 stock. They&#39;re hitting on all
[1800.559s] cylinders, whether it&#39;s the parks,
[1802.799s] whether it&#39;s the cruise experience,
[1804.24s] whether it&#39;s the consumer products. And
[1805.76s] they just guided they said we&#39;re going
[1807.12s] to do $17 billion of cash from
[1810.24s] operations this year. That ship and by
[1812.559s] the way 180 million subscribers they&#39;re
[1814.96s] second to Netflix. They added 2 and a2
[1817.44s] million. They&#39;re going to do this ESPN.
[1819.12s] Their sports business is through the
[1820.399s] roof. So we continue to like it despite
[1822.96s] the fact it&#39;s moved up so much in the
[1824.399s] last few weeks. And the Abu Dhabi um
[1826.72s] Yeah, that doesn&#39;t hurt either. Yeah.
[1828.559s] And what else is on your list? Uh oh,
[1830.48s] here&#39;s one that no one&#39;s going to want
[1831.679s] to buy. Albam Marl. Okay. This is Okay.
[1834.799s] Tell me about this one. Yeah, you know
[1836.559s] me. I&#39;m early and people like there are
[1839.12s] sometimes some kicks on your list. I&#39;m
[1840.88s] like, huh? And then a year later we sit
[1842.64s] down, you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, that was pretty
[1843.679s] good.&quot; All right. So, Albamaro, number
[1846.08s] one lithium producer. Also lowest cost
[1848.799s] lithium producer. Lithium prices are in
[1850.799s] the garbage. Why? Because everyone says
[1852.399s] EVs are out of favor. Blah blah blah.
[1855.039s] China is 60% of the EV business. It&#39;s
[1857.36s] not a natural market. It&#39;s a government
[1859.12s] subsidized market. They have an
[1860.64s] initiative. They&#39;re going to continue to
[1861.84s] grow. They grew EV sales 38% last month
[1864.64s] in China. So what&#39;s going to happen? As
[1867.279s] one of the biggest producers, you just
[1868.559s] wait it out. Lithium prices are very
[1870.24s] cyclical. Every few years they go up and
[1872.0s] down. We&#39;re at the trough right now.
[1873.6s] They&#39;ve got $3.1 billion of liquidity to
[1876.88s] sit it out. All the small players will
[1878.48s] go out of business. That shrinks supply.
[1880.32s] Demand continues to go up. And energy
[1882.24s] storage is a big thing. Overall demand
[1884.399s] from 1.2 million metric tonses right now
[1886.64s] to 3.2 in the next 5 years. Albam
[1889.279s] Marorrow, you know, we talk about Disney
[1890.96s] going going up to 200. Albam Marorrow
[1893.12s] could be a triple over the next three to
[1894.559s] five years. Really? Okay. Because we
[1896.799s] just threw up a chart and you mentioned
[1898.48s] the trough of um I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re
[1900.159s] going to pull it back up again, but we
[1901.76s] just threw up a chart and you mentioned
[1903.279s] the trough of lithium. The chart looks
[1905.2s] like that. I&#39;m going to I&#39;m going to
[1906.399s] tell you something right now. It&#39;s at
[1907.519s] $61. It&#39;s going to go let&#39;s say it&#39;s
[1910.48s] going to go right after I get off the
[1911.679s] air. It&#39;ll probably go to $55. Everyone
[1913.519s] will say that guy&#39;s an idiot. two a year
[1915.84s] and a half from now, you&#39;re going to
[1916.88s] have me on, Diane. And the thing&#39;s going
[1918.399s] to be over 100, probably closer to 150.
[1921.039s] Okay. All right. You heard it here
[1922.24s] first. That&#39;s Tom Hayes, chairman and
[1924.24s] managing member of Great Hill Capital.
[1927.279s] Our thanks to Tom.
[1930.0s] And we&#39;re back. Quote of the week. The
[1932.799s] biggest mistake investors make is to
[1934.32s] believe that what happened in the recent
[1936.32s] past is likely to persist. That&#39;s Ray
[1939.6s] Dallio. Uh that&#39;s called recency bias.
[1942.08s] We cover it very frequently on the show.
[1944.32s] Here&#39;s my mug from my friends down in
[1947.12s] Dallas. Uh they know how to make mugs.
[1949.679s] We&#39;re going to, you know, make better
[1951.2s] and better stuff. Uh different stuff all
[1953.519s] the time. We&#39;ll we&#39;ll throw in some new
[1955.279s] stuff every now and
[1958.679s] then, but I always like to get the
[1960.88s] founding gear. Um Seth Clarin, the stock
[1964.88s] market is a story of cycles and the
[1967.2s] human behavior that is responsible for
[1969.279s] overreactions in both directions. Oh,
[1971.679s] and by the way, I want to acknowledge
[1973.279s] the new clients who came in. We open up
[1976.48s] once a quarter for the small accounts,
[1978.08s] the $1 million accounts, the minimum
[1980.24s] accounts, and then uh the people that
[1982.32s] are doing the bigger accounts. They can
[1984.159s] come in whenever they want, and we&#39;ve
[1986.0s] had a couple of those come in in the
[1987.679s] last week. So, uh very grateful for
[1989.679s] that. And welcome to uh welcome to the
[1993.679s] family. Okay. Seth uh Seth Clarin, stock
[1996.48s] market story of cycles and human
[1997.76s] behavior that&#39;s responsible
[1999.039s] overreactions in both directions. And
[2001.519s] when we did that special call for
[2003.2s] clients on April 7th or 8th, whatever it
[2006.159s] was the day before Trump tweeted, &quot;Now&#39;s
[2008.08s] a great time to buy stocks.&quot; Um we went
[2011.84s] through that and we said, &quot;Listen, look
[2013.76s] at the revenues. Look at the free cash
[2015.519s] flow. Look at the balance sheet.&quot; And we
[2017.36s] went company by company by company and
[2019.039s] and we said if there was ever a time if
[2022.08s] you you know we&#39;ve never asked number
[2023.84s] one we&#39;ve never asked anyone to invest.
[2025.519s] Okay people come to us that listen to
[2027.2s] the podcast or come from referrals of
[2029.039s] people etc. Number two we&#39;ve never asked
[2031.279s] existing clients to put in more money.
[2032.72s] They put in more money as they get more
[2034.159s] money as we deliver results. That&#39;s the
[2035.76s] way it works. Uh but we didn&#39;t do it
[2038.0s] twice. We did it in October 2022 and the
[2040.799s] people that took advantage of that uh
[2042.799s] just we crushed it. Okay. because they
[2044.88s] were throwing a uh uh Amazon out. They
[2048.72s] were throwing everything was getting
[2049.76s] thrown out with the bathwater. Amazon
[2051.839s] and Google were quick doubles in a year.
[2054.0s] And then um and then the last time we
[2056.159s] did it was just four weeks ago. And I
[2058.8s] was on April 11th on uh Vanney talking
[2065.04s] Disney at 85 and Boeing. Uh Boeing had
[2068.639s] already moved up. You know, we were
[2069.919s] pounding the table before that, but it
[2071.599s] was like 154. Both of them are up 30% in
[2075.28s] the last three weeks since then. It&#39;s
[2077.599s] it&#39;s unbelievable. Um so uh Bo Warren
[2082.0s] Buffett the most important quality of an
[2083.839s] investor is temperament not intellect
[2086.56s] and that&#39;s where we make our money is
[2089.359s] taking advantage of dislocation whether
[2091.76s] market which was the case four weeks ago
[2094.24s] sector which is what we do on a regular
[2096.24s] basis or individual company temp
[2099.119s] highquality companies when they&#39;re
[2100.56s] temporarily impaired. uh and um and
[2103.68s] rinse and repeat over and over again.
[2106.96s] GXO now getting to our data charts. GXO
[2111.96s] welcomes There we go. five new members
[2115.119s] to its board of directors. Brad Jacobs
[2117.76s] put this out on LinkedIn today and I
[2119.68s] noted the most important part. These
[2121.76s] leaders bring deep expertise in
[2123.2s] operational excellence and strategic
[2124.96s] growth across all aspects of the supply
[2126.56s] chain. They will add immediate value as
[2129.24s] GXO quote accelerates its path to
[2133.04s] becoming the world&#39;s leading logistics
[2137.119s] provider. Ladies and gentlemen, Numero
[2140.24s] Uno, the big kahuna. That is in a public
[2144.16s] release that they&#39;re stating their
[2145.839s] intention. And I commented in Brad&#39;s
[2149.16s] post. I said, &quot;You don&#39;t attract this
[2151.839s] quality of directors if the turnaround
[2154.56s] plan is not clear.&quot; these pe these type
[2156.8s] of people are not going to put their
[2158.0s] reputations on the line for a sinking
[2159.76s] ship. Uh Todd Cooper, you can go through
[2163.28s] all of these uh whether it&#39;s uh uh chief
[2167.28s] product supply officer from Proctor and
[2169.2s] Gamble, whether it&#39;s the chief supply
[2171.2s] chain officer at Honeywell
[2173.0s] International, whether it&#39;s the
[2177.64s] um uh chief financial officer from XBO
[2181.92s] Logistics, I mean on and on and on. And
[2184.56s] then we&#39;ve got our RBC stuff. Sloomer.
[2187.68s] You can see the quick recovery. We&#39;ve
[2189.76s] had V-shaped recovery so far with, by
[2192.96s] the way, momentum kind of just turning,
[2195.28s] which is also pretty surprising. Um,
[2199.68s] uh, so so you can kind of see where we
[2201.68s] are now. This is an area where you would
[2203.52s] normally find a little consolidation and
[2205.28s] a little bit of rest, but you know, if
[2207.2s] the deal things keep climbing across the
[2209.68s] tape and you got all these trapped bears
[2212.16s] that we talked
[2213.4s] about, you you don&#39;t want to be
[2215.68s] uninvested. That&#39;s what I can tell you
[2217.28s] right now. I mean, even if you get a 3
[2219.359s] 4% pullback to to knock out the Johnny
[2222.16s] come lately before we push push forward
[2224.24s] to new highs, um just just hang tight.
[2227.2s] It&#39;s it&#39;s pretty exciting. You&#39;re seeing
[2228.72s] the advanced decline line and breath is
[2231.28s] very very strong as it broke out above
[2233.2s] this. Sometimes you see these breakouts
[2235.119s] and then a back test before you go to
[2236.64s] new highs. So just be aware of that.
[2238.96s] Don&#39;t worry about it. Small caps just
[2241.04s] getting started. Short interest at a
[2243.119s] record high. Super excited about this
[2245.4s] group. A and by the way, those were the
[2247.68s] biggest movers yesterday. Um bullish and
[2250.72s] bearish sentiment survey. still super
[2252.96s] bearish but starting to slowly move
[2255.52s] bullish off of super extreme like you
[2257.92s] saw in the great financial crisis uh
[2260.88s] after the lows which is pretty exciting.
[2263.44s] MCI Europe uh you could see here
[2266.48s] starting to
[2267.72s] move. DAX is already at new highs broke
[2271.28s] out. I mean, this is the international
[2273.359s] relative to US story that
[2278.52s] um we came into the year strong pounding
[2281.359s] the table on that&#39;s playing out in real
[2283.2s] time. You probably get a short-term
[2285.359s] counter trend of that maybe with the DAX
[2287.28s] go back and retest US continued
[2289.52s] strength. Hang Sang just getting started
[2291.92s] into in its recovery. Super excited
[2293.76s] about Alibaba. They&#39;re going to report
[2295.839s] this week by the way. So, um 10-year
[2299.2s] yield trading in this range. This is
[2301.52s] going lower. Pay attention. Google SLR
[2305.52s] uh Bessant and you will see what&#39;s going
[2307.52s] to take place in the second half of this
[2309.44s] year when they change capital
[2311.2s] requirements. uh and uh
[2314.119s] government guaranteed securities like
[2316.56s] treasuries are exempt from capital
[2319.04s] requirements which means they&#39;re going
[2320.24s] to be able to hold a lot more which
[2322.32s] means they&#39;re going to be buying banks
[2324.96s] are going to be able to buy a ton uh of
[2328.079s] treasuries and they&#39;re they&#39;re incent
[2330.96s] the way they&#39;re structured they they buy
[2332.8s] the short end of the curve but what that
[2334.32s] will enable the Fed to do is uh sorry
[2338.079s] not the Fed the Treasury to do is
[2340.24s] operation twist where they can sell
[2342.16s] short-term and use the proceeds to buy
[2344.64s] long-term to bring down the long end of
[2346.24s] the curve which helps uh most
[2349.56s] importantly mortgage rates followed by
[2353.2s] auto rates to some extent um and brings
[2356.48s] down the refinancing cost for the
[2358.24s] country because if we can issue
[2360.16s] unlimited short-term to banks and and
[2363.359s] they can uh and they can earn then we
[2366.32s] can buy in the long end of the curve
[2368.24s] bring that down refinance the the uh
[2370.96s] long end of the curve at low rates and
[2373.92s] push out the maturities which is really
[2376.16s] what we want to do. Difference between
[2378.16s] US power demand growth and US GDP
[2382.52s] flipped with latest data. So uh you can
[2386.4s] see power demand is turning up. That&#39;s
[2388.48s] that&#39;s what you see when GDP goes up. So
[2391.2s] you can see that this was a fake out of
[2392.96s] inventory pull forwards 10-year
[2396.359s] yield. The counter trend move that we
[2398.96s] talked about. Maybe it goes back up to
[2401.2s] 583 before going into the 3s. Uh I
[2404.64s] wouldn&#39;t hold your breath, but it&#39;s
[2405.92s] certainly possible. Uh
[2409.16s] 4558 level maybe. Uh dollar index. This
[2413.119s] is the counter trend move that we called
[2414.64s] for two weeks ago. Here it is. Maybe
[2416.88s] goes up to the back of this uptrend
[2418.72s] channel and then breaks back down. It&#39;s
[2422.0s] kind of comical talking about all this
[2423.44s] technical stuff. It absolutely plays no
[2425.76s] real role in what we do in buying great
[2427.92s] companies, but people like it. Uh, give
[2430.96s] the people what they want. Gold rolling
[2433.28s] over here as the dollar has a counter
[2435.599s] trend move. This is interesting from
[2438.44s] Strategus. Great shop there for
[2440.64s] research. They&#39;ve got 20-day highs
[2443.2s] through 50% the first time since late
[2445.76s] 2023. And uh when you have percentage of
[2449.839s] stocks at a 20-day high that goes
[2452.24s] through 50%
[2454.4s] uh it tends to be a sign of immense
[2456.64s] strength and the the rally tends to
[2458.64s] follow through pretty dramatically even
[2461.119s] if you get a short-term check back
[2462.72s] before you power higher. And he goes all
[2465.2s] the way back and he shows all these
[2467.24s] instances recently in 2023 2022. Then he
[2471.52s] goes back to 2020
[2473.839s] uh and shows what happened when that
[2475.28s] type of stuff happens coming out of
[2476.88s] COVID. Then he shows it in
[2479.88s] 2018 coming out of
[2482.2s] uh of the first Powell mishap. Uh then
[2486.24s] he shows it in
[2489.24s] 2015 and these are all follow-through
[2491.76s] rallies. Then he goes back to 2008 to
[2494.72s] 2013 how it worked every pretty much
[2497.2s] every single time. Then he shows 1972 to
[2500.839s] 1983. So this is an interesting
[2503.2s] indicator. Even if the markets moved a
[2505.52s] lot, when these extremes happen, it
[2507.839s] means there&#39;s strength behind it. And
[2509.839s] even if you get short-term checkbacks,
[2511.44s] it tends to precede big
[2517.4s] rallies. US is 64% of global equity
[2522.079s] market versus 61% average of the 2020s.
[2525.28s] It hasn&#39;t been this high. You got to go
[2527.68s] all the way back to June of 2003 when it
[2530.48s] peaked at
[2531.64s] 55% of global equities. And that&#39;s one
[2534.56s] of
[2535.64s] the indicators pointing to the theme
[2538.4s] that we&#39;ve been talking about when it
[2539.92s] was unpopular that international would
[2541.839s] outperform US and it&#39;s dramatically
[2544.8s] outperformed this year and that trend
[2547.359s] will continue I think for the
[2549.2s] foreseeable future next handful of
[2551.28s] years. That doesn&#39;t mean the US is going
[2553.68s] to do poorly. What it means is that
[2556.88s] international pockets of international
[2558.96s] will outperform
[2561.119s] uh even if the US does okay which we
[2563.52s] believe it certainly will and then
[2566.48s] you&#39;ve got China PBOC cutting rates by
[2570.319s] the way global M2 money supply is
[2573.44s] booming uh which means liquidity is
[2576.8s] coming into the market and largely it&#39;s
[2579.839s] coming from China. China was a source of
[2585.44s] illquidity for three years, draining
[2588.079s] liquidity. Now they are a source of
[2590.76s] expanding liquidity from all their
[2593.119s] stimulative practices uh and um and
[2596.72s] easing. So this is going to be a
[2598.48s] positive thing not only for China for
[2600.64s] but for the rest of the world. They&#39;re
[2602.88s] finally picking up the baton that the
[2605.599s] western world uh ran with during COVID
[2608.56s] and afterward. Now they are uh picking
[2612.0s] up the charge uh moving forward. So
[2615.599s] here&#39;s the asset quilt of total returns.
[2618.64s] You can see EHA is dramatically
[2621.2s] outperforming. EA is positive. S&amp;P was
[2623.52s] negative. It might be might be positive
[2626.0s] or flat on the year after today.
[2627.839s] Emerging markets is outperforming all
[2630.16s] the things that we said. If you go back
[2632.319s] to the fourth quarter, I said the last
[2633.92s] shall be first, international, etc. and
[2636.8s] S&amp;P is towards the lowest, international
[2639.68s] is towards the highest. And uh and there
[2642.4s] you go. Dollar faces a secular decline.
[2644.64s] So you&#39;ll get these counter trend moves,
[2646.48s] but we know the trend is down in the
[2649.28s] intermediate
[2651.079s] term. One month since the bottom, had a
[2654.56s] bounce in tech, industrials, consumer
[2657.119s] discretionary, financials, real estate,
[2660.079s] uh etc. have done very well. biggest
[2663.119s] four-week outflow from US stocks since
[2665.359s] May of
[2667.16s] 2023. Biggest tech outflow in 11 weeks.
[2671.119s] So that&#39;s in the last week or so.
[2673.0s] Consumers momentum remains. So this is
[2676.8s] the difference between hard and soft
[2678.319s] data. They say they&#39;re miserable, but
[2680.16s] they keep spending money. Then we look
[2682.16s] at uh AutoSAR for April was
[2687.4s] 17.3 million, ladies and gentlemen. So
[2690.88s] obviously a little bit pull forward with
[2692.64s] the tariffs, but now we got to replenish
[2694.96s] the the detocking cycle and uh there
[2697.839s] going to be incentives for car owners
[2699.28s] and you&#39;ve got a 13.5 year average car
[2702.24s] on the road. Uh lot of things going on
[2705.119s] here. So if this 17 plus can can
[2707.92s] continue, we&#39;re going to continue to see
[2710.48s] extraordinary things from Cooper
[2713.28s] Standard. Okay, I wouldn&#39;t expect this
[2715.28s] to be a straight line, but look at where
[2716.72s] the trend is going. Just like every
[2719.04s] single recovery, which was our thesis
[2721.599s] from day one when we put on that first
[2723.599s] huge position at $5 and change in May of
[2727.319s] 2022 and went on the claim and countdown
[2729.839s] on June 6th and pitched the stock and
[2732.4s] here we are 5x so far and just getting
[2735.92s] started. We think this is going to be a
[2737.2s] multibagger even from these
[2739.96s] levels. International versus US stocks
[2743.04s] rolling fourmonth performance spread. So
[2744.96s] internationals outperforming US by
[2748.28s] 16.2%. Ladies and gentlemen, the last
[2750.72s] time you saw that spike was the early
[2752.48s] 2000s and that trend continued for 5
[2756.319s] years. It was one of the biggest periods
[2757.76s] of international outperformance over US.
[2760.8s] And uh and that&#39;s that uh number of
[2763.839s] consecutive weeks with AI bears above
[2766.68s] 50% was 11 weeks. You haven&#39;t seen that
[2769.52s] since the early 90s. You had an 8-year
[2771.52s] bull market after that and since the
[2773.44s] great financial crisis and you had a
[2775.92s] multi-year bull market after that. AI
[2779.44s] asset allocation lowest equity exposures
[2782.24s] since October 2023. Now is a time to be
[2785.2s] a buyer, not a seller. Global monetary
[2787.44s] stimulus is going through the roof. This
[2789.28s] is the threemon sum net number of rate
[2791.839s] cuts globally going up. What follows
[2794.4s] that? Global manufacturing PMIs. They&#39;re
[2796.88s] down here on the mat. They are going to
[2799.04s] spike up. firms plan to pass tariff
[2801.68s] related costs to consumers. Okay. Well,
[2804.24s] now the tariffs are a lot less than
[2805.92s] advertised. So, uh it&#39;s going to be less
[2808.079s] of a story. US companies buying back
[2810.0s] stock at a record pace. Most announced
[2812.64s] buybacks in more than a decade, 665
[2816.56s] billion in the first quarter of
[2819.0s] 2025. Watch what people do, not what
[2821.839s] they say. Best one-mon return since 2020
[2825.68s] uh off the COVID lows. That was a that
[2828.72s] was the best year. Unbelievable year. Uh
[2832.48s] rallies of this magnitude often have
[2835.24s] legs.
[2837.96s] Um one month rolling returns of these
[2840.56s] levels greater than 14% is often carried
[2842.56s] on with a forward 12-month return of 25%
[2845.68s] on average and positive 95% of the time
[2848.72s] since
[2849.72s] 1978. 56 instances. Average return after
[2853.76s] a month like that is six month return is
[2856.96s] like 14% 12-month return is 25%. Uh how
[2861.68s] you doing? Uh it&#39;s gonna be a fun time.
[2864.96s] So as Vney called me the resident bull
[2867.76s] uh I&#39;ll be willing to carry that title
[2870.319s] for some time to come. Uh average US
[2873.04s] gasoline price ahead of peak demand
[2875.56s] season. Uh EPS revision tracking near
[2878.56s] historical pattern a little bit better
[2880.16s] than historical pattern. uh announced
[2883.56s] buybacks versus actual. So, there&#39;s a
[2885.76s] lot of catch-up here. There&#39;s a further
[2887.119s] bid in the market. PBOC stimulus, we
[2890.24s] continue to cover active listings
[2892.8s] relative to the start of the year from
[2894.28s] realtor.com. They&#39;re picking up.
[2896.079s] Supplies coming on. That&#39;s good to
[2898.599s] see. Germany expected to inject up to $1
[2901.76s] trillion into the military and
[2903.72s] infrastructure. Okay, that&#39;s a lot of
[2905.76s] pressure from Trump. That&#39;s good.
[2911.76s] University of Michigan consumer
[2914.839s] confidence at points like this when it&#39;s
[2917.359s] so flushed out they tend to perceive
[2920.0s] very good things in the equity markets
[2922.319s] companies are maintaining guidance more
[2924.16s] than
[2925.0s] usual and that&#39;s one point that I&#39;ve
[2927.359s] made despite all the uncertainty fact
[2929.92s] that this year only came down 3.6% 6%
[2931.92s] and next year has held up. Now that you
[2934.4s] see a lot of the tariffs coming down to
[2936.079s] 10% from these astronomical levels, I
[2939.2s] think we&#39;re going to just see uh
[2940.96s] guidance start to go back up and people
[2943.359s] are going to get excited. Retail
[2944.64s] investors at lower levels than
[2947.0s] 2019. Net inflows to US versus
[2953.0s] Europe. Systematic positioning in US
[2956.079s] equities. This is what we&#39;ve been
[2957.44s] talking about with regard to the CTAs
[2959.44s] and hedge funds. they haven&#39;t sold this
[2961.839s] much in the hole, been this short since
[2964.88s] the COVID lows and they missed, you
[2967.599s] know, what was like a 90% rally
[2969.48s] thereafter. Uh, and I think the same
[2971.599s] thing is happening right now. What what
[2973.76s] was forced sellers is now going to be
[2975.76s] forced buyers every positive headline.
[2978.4s] So, these type of opportunities don&#39;t
[2980.24s] come around that often, ladies and
[2982.079s] gentlemen. Institutional position in S&amp;P
[2984.4s] 500. uh asset manager positioning well
[2988.0s] below the market&#39;s taken off without
[2990.24s] them. They are going to have to chase up
[2993.04s] just like every single time. Some
[2995.839s] potentially good
[2997.4s] news. S&amp;P drops 10% in two
[3001.4s] days. When did he publish that? Anyway,
[3004.16s] 12 months later, the S&amp;P is up
[3007.079s] 32.6%. So, we saw that in April.
[3009.98s] [Music]
[3013.96s] Uh here&#39;s the reciprocal tariffs,
[3016.72s] China&#39;s retaliatory tariffs, and now
[3018.8s] back down. So it went up to 14525, now
[3022.72s] it&#39;s down to 3010, which is a good place
[3026.4s] for
[3027.64s] it. ETF float. By the way, the big
[3031.24s] story, and my friend Jerry actually
[3033.76s] emailed me about this, who I met in
[3035.839s] Hawaii. He said uh the biggest thing and
[3039.28s] and this is a guy who ran one of the
[3041.119s] greatest banks of all time uh US bank
[3044.16s] and he said the biggest thing is the
[3046.0s] opening of China to US businesses. It&#39;s
[3048.4s] not the tariff rate and if they get
[3050.319s] these non-tariff barriers removed it is
[3052.88s] going to be boom time. Uh you know I&#39;ve
[3055.52s] said in past podcasts $1.1 trillion
[3059.28s] dollar of S&amp;P revenues comes from China
[3063.52s] from the S&amp;P 500. So if they open up
[3066.24s] more to US businesses, this is going to
[3068.48s] be a boom for China, a boom for the US
[3071.359s] like we&#39;ve never seen before. Our ETF
[3074.0s] flow tracker suggests national team has
[3076.0s] been buying to support the market in
[3078.44s] China. So uh you can see cumulative
[3081.04s] flows to the top five NT holding ashare
[3084.44s] ETFs. Uh net buyers. So the Chinese
[3087.52s] government is propping up the market
[3089.2s] until it takes on a life of its own. So
[3091.119s] they&#39;re they&#39;re in the game. They&#39;re
[3092.4s] finally they went from asleep at the
[3094.0s] wheel to in fifth gear and that&#39;s going
[3096.72s] to be a great thing. TW 2025 earnings
[3099.839s] growth estimates emerging markets 10.4%
[3104.0s] versus the US at
[3105.64s] 7.1% much lower multiple much higher
[3108.24s] growth. Where do you want to be? NASDAQ
[3110.48s] 100 re-enters bull market. So now it&#39;s
[3112.8s] up 20% after shortest bare market in
[3115.359s] history I guess. uh broadening other
[3117.839s] than COVID broadening breath equal
[3119.839s] weighted S&amp;P 500 beats main index for
[3122.319s] six straight sessions that means under
[3125.119s] the surface is what&#39;s making money and
[3127.88s] the the clients can see it in their P&amp;Ls
[3130.96s] I mean it&#39;s
[3134.2s] unbelie February was like oh my gosh
[3136.72s] it&#39;s like through the roof and and now
[3139.68s] it&#39;s we it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s better than
[3142.079s] where we beyond overtook our high water
[3145.76s] mark uh and it&#39;s uh from the first
[3148.48s] quarter which is just awesome. I mean
[3150.559s] and the market&#39;s not even recovered yet
[3152.48s] which is even more awesome. So super
[3154.96s] exciting times. Broadening breath
[3157.839s] uh equal weighted got that next realized
[3161.44s] and consensus EPS growth for select US
[3164.04s] indices.
[3166.76s] Uh so you see Russell 2000 has the
[3170.88s] biggest growth rate small caps record
[3173.599s] short interest and biggest earnings
[3175.44s] growth for this year and next year
[3177.119s] relative to midcap relative to NASDAQ
[3180.0s] relative to equal weight relative to
[3182.599s] S&amp;P highest earnings growth lowest
[3186.88s] multiple get your small caps ladies and
[3189.44s] gentlemen because those shorts I talked
[3191.2s] about MoAS mother of all short squeezes
[3194.72s] This morning on Vanney with regard to
[3196.96s] the market, forced sellers became forced
[3199.92s] buyers. It&#39;s going to be nothing
[3201.839s] compared to what you&#39;re going to see in
[3203.119s] small caps. There&#39;s going to be some
[3204.48s] face ripping rallies in small caps. Mark
[3208.079s] my words. You can count on that. Can
[3210.96s] stocks get back to positive in
[3213.8s] 2025?
[3219.64s] Um, there&#39;s no question about it.
[3221.92s] There&#39;s no question about it. uh US
[3224.0s] inflation
[3226.2s] rate is lower than it was in September
[3231.44s] when they did an emergency 50 basis
[3234.16s] point cut. Fed&#39;s too restrictive.
[3235.68s] They&#39;re going to wake up. They no longer
[3236.96s] have the tariff excuse because the
[3238.319s] tariffs have come down. They&#39;ve got to
[3240.079s] get it get in action and remove the
[3241.839s] restriction and let people buy homes and
[3243.68s] cars and get on with their
[3249.079s] lives versus screw a bunch of
[3251.2s] millennials who want to buy houses
[3252.559s] because you want a plaque that says I&#39;m
[3254.079s] not Arthur Burns. The gap between US
[3256.64s] hard and soft data growth is among the
[3259.28s] largest in the since the 1970s. We&#39;ve
[3262.96s] covered this. People are super
[3264.559s] pessimistic, but they&#39;re still shopping
[3266.16s] like there&#39;s no tomorrow. That&#39;s
[3268.559s] continues. Fund manager equity
[3270.76s] allocation lowest since May 2023. All
[3274.16s] these people have to chase up now. They
[3276.24s] all have career risk. They missed it.
[3277.839s] They sold in the hole 1.1 trillion. Now
[3280.559s] they got to buy up and they&#39;re going to
[3282.319s] be forced in at new highs. It&#39;s it the
[3284.96s] story just continues to repeat. Long
[3287.119s] gold is the most crowded trade in the
[3288.8s] fund manager survey. Um that thing is
[3292.4s] that&#39;s going to be over sooner sooner
[3294.079s] rather than later. I know no one
[3295.599s] believes me. Uh but you know, hang
[3298.92s] tight. Uh earnings
[3302.76s] sentiment has now come back up in the
[3306.16s] S&amp;P 500 like a hockey stick. So that&#39;s
[3308.4s] good to see. MAG7 has lagged the rest of
[3311.04s] the market year to date. That continues
[3312.8s] to be the case. S&amp;P 493 are up 1%. S&amp;P
[3318.319s] was down 3%. This was a couple of days
[3320.48s] ago. And the MAG 7 down 12%. That was a
[3324.079s] theme coming into 2024 five. Go back at
[3328.88s] the tapes was uh MAG7 will dramatically
[3332.04s] underperform. International will
[3333.839s] dramatically outperform. Both of those
[3335.599s] have held true. Goldman&#39;s positioning
[3338.24s] indicator deeply negative territory
[3340.8s] suggests there&#39;s room for stocks to
[3342.559s] rally. We
[3344.28s] agree. Uh what is this?
[3350.24s] Oh, this just
[3355.24s] shows S&amp;P stocks above the
[3358.359s] 20-day, 50-day, and 200 day moving
[3361.359s] average. So, the 200 has got plenty of
[3363.2s] room to run here. The S&amp;P just overtook
[3366.079s] the 200 day moving
[3367.96s] average. Take it for what it&#39;s worth.
[3369.92s] VIX below 20 is another another clue.
[3371.76s] The worst is over. 12 months out. Median
[3374.4s] return 10.3%.
[3378.319s] Advanced decline line continues to climb
[3381.52s] uh hits record high for the first time
[3383.2s] in a 100 days. One year later, average
[3385.68s] market&#39;s up
[3387.24s] 14.21%. Total US dollar futures
[3389.92s] positioning
[3391.44s] uh is getting shorter. So probably we
[3396.48s] have this counter trend rally go a bit
[3398.839s] lower first before getting a bigger
[3401.68s] bounce. We&#39;ll see what happens. uh we&#39;ll
[3403.92s] pay attention to the commitment of
[3405.119s] traders reports as stocks continue to
[3407.44s] claw back potential all-time highs.
[3409.359s] Remember that only twice in the past 75
[3411.599s] years did stocks peak in
[3413.96s] February. Uh stocks tend to peak in
[3418.799s] December or
[3420.76s] January according to this Carson data.
[3423.44s] Chart of the day better than expected 1Q
[3425.44s] earnings. They were expected to be 6%.
[3427.52s] They came in at 13.4. S&amp;P has surged
[3430.64s] since Trump said great time to buy. It
[3432.64s] surged by 14% since that tweet and by
[3436.68s] pure well it wasn&#39;t luck because I I&#39;ve
[3440.24s] just done this so many times I could
[3441.92s] tell we were at a peak crescendo of of
[3444.4s] fear and that&#39;s why I chose that day to
[3446.799s] do it and then sure enough that was the
[3449.28s] inflection uh which very similar to the
[3452.48s] COVID lows when I got quoted in that
[3454.319s] article uh and market watch saying we
[3457.2s] are buying during the 1918 Spanish flu
[3460.88s] the Dow was down 35 5% we&#39;re down 33%.
[3464.88s] Uh we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen,
[3466.4s] but with all these great companies
[3468.48s] marked down, we&#39;re buying high quality
[3469.92s] businesses. Two days later, the market
[3471.76s] bottomed and never looked back. Uh S&amp;P
[3474.319s] 500 rebound is one of the biggest under
[3476.48s] Trump
[3479.24s] era CTA positioning. Again, this is what
[3483.04s] we&#39;ve been talking about. They are
[3484.48s] forced buyers for the foreseeable
[3486.319s] future. Uh there&#39;ll be a few fits and
[3488.64s] starts. Climate related spending 12
[3491.119s] month moving average by type. So you can
[3494.079s] see government spending is going down.
[3497.68s] Uh premiums after loss, power outages,
[3501.2s] etc. All right, moving on to the next.
[3503.2s] US and China agree to slash tariffs for
[3505.119s] 90 days and major trade breakthrough.
[3507.119s] That was just awesome. JD grows the
[3509.119s] fastest since 2022 amid contest with
[3512.76s] Maitan. So that&#39;s cool to see. Their
[3515.839s] earnings were better than expected.
[3517.119s] China removes ban on Boeing deliveries
[3519.44s] after trade truce. I wonder if they
[3521.359s] still have their position in line or
[3522.72s] they got to stick with Comarmac. Um,
[3525.2s] something tells me Boeing will let them
[3526.96s] back in the door. Alibaba stock stores,
[3529.359s] it&#39;s not just the tariff pause. You can
[3532.16s] read all about the
[3534.2s] AI and uh Joe Sai highlighted the
[3537.599s] importance of artificial intelligence
[3539.04s] would be quote key driver of company&#39;s
[3541.28s] operation in the next three to five
[3543.119s] years. Every business of Alibaba will
[3544.96s] closely integrate with AI as the company
[3547.2s] believes with AI application. Not only
[3549.119s] does it help optimizing search

[3653.92s] Some details of President Trump&#39;s
[3655.68s] so-called big beautiful tax bill are
[3657.76s] out. Now, automobile investors have two
[3660.16s] matters con considered. The possibility
[3661.76s] that electric vehicle tax credits could
[3663.52s] vanish and the potential for a new tax
[3666.48s] break on cars assembled in the US. House
[3669.52s] Ways and Means Committee set to release
[3671.68s] so-called markup details of bud budget
[3673.44s] reconciliation bill. Beautiful bill. Uh
[3677.119s] details have emerged. Repeal of EV tax
[3679.44s] credits. Uh, consumer credits will be
[3682.559s] repealed almost immediately while
[3684.0s] business tax credits will be phased
[3686.359s] out. Right now, consumers can claim a
[3689.04s] deduction. Duh. Just created a leasing
[3692.44s] loophole. Looks like
[3695.0s] commercial gradual phase out. A new tax
[3697.68s] break for American assembled cars is
[3699.92s] also part of initial market.
[3701.52s] Essentially, car buyers could deduct
[3704.0s] interest on auto loans from their
[3706.4s] taxable income if the car was made in
[3709.4s] America. Boom. Shakalaka, ladies and
[3712.0s] gentlemen. I mean, what this will do to
[3713.839s] volumes for Cooper Standard uh will be
[3716.4s] through the roof. Let&#39;s see if it
[3717.599s] finally gets through. He talked about it
[3719.359s] in the campaign. Let&#39;s see if he can
[3721.04s] deliver. Americans hit the road as
[3723.119s] economic fears discourage flying. Run
[3725.52s] those 13 and 12year-old cars to the

[3734.64s] better than anyone else. Volume, baby
[3736.64s] volume. 17.3 million SAR in April. You
[3740.079s] can&#39;t I mean it doesn&#39;t get any better.
[3742.16s] It&#39;s going to get any better. That&#39;s for
[3743.68s] sure. Why JP Morgan says the US lag
[3746.0s] verse European stocks is just beginning.
[3748.48s] We actually agree with the sell side.

[3786.72s] only game in town. The only material
[3789.359s] buyer of this dip was Mr. and Mrs.

[3797.64s] sophisticated short bearish morons now
[3800.72s] have to chase up and buy the scraps.
[3802.96s] Corporate share back buybacks were a
[3804.96s] shock absorber in April sell-off.
[3807.2s] They&#39;re going to continue to e
[3809.079s] accelerate. Uh article of the week, the
[3811.44s] magic&#39;s still there. Stock market and
[3813.44s] sentiment
[3814.52s] results. We covered all the media. Let&#39;s
[3817.119s] get to the stocks. Disney update. Uh you
[3820.4s] can see here cash flow continues to
[3822.559s] explode off the charts. Uh and
[3826.839s] um basically back to record highs.
[3829.599s] Revenues at record highs. margins are
[3832.16s] starting to reacelerate again. Return on
[3834.559s] capital is reacelerating again. Uh
[3837.76s] pretty much every single unit was up. Uh
[3840.559s] revenues were up
[3842.039s] 7%. Um free cash flow more than doubled.
[3846.72s] Uh they they guided 17 billion dollar of
[3849.92s] cash from operations this year.$180
[3852.799s] million subscribers. They added two and
[3854.88s] a half million subscribers. They&#39;re
[3857.119s] opening the park in Abu Dhabi. I mean,
[3860.48s] it just goes on and on. And
[3863.96s] um this one&#39;s going to be a $200 stock.
[3866.64s] It&#39;s just a matter of time. So, no one
[3868.319s] wanted at 85. Everyone will want it at
[3870.72s] 150 to
[3875.559s] 180 and people will be naming their dog
[3878.079s] after Disney when it hits 200. Um so
[3882.559s] turbocharged investment in experiences
[3884.559s] $30 billion in domestic parks has led to
[3886.72s] more expansion projects underway
[3888.48s] globally than at any point in Disney&#39;s
[3890.52s] history. Uh strong film slate coming
[3894.24s] high margin of creative cruise business
[3896.079s] which we talked about the highest return
[3897.68s] on in capital of the whole entire
[3899.44s] product suite. Streaming cooking
[3902.0s] profitable becoming more and more
[3903.96s] profitable. Uh Disney parks main driver
[3908.319s] of EBIT continued to see strong
[3910.4s] attendance 6.5 billion in revenues up 9%
[3914.119s] yearonear 13% up in EBIT
[3917.799s] EBIT. Um so this continues to uh go.
[3922.88s] Viewership was up 32% yearonear with
[3926.24s] ESPN. You can&#39;t make this stuff up.
[3928.48s] Advertising market remains healthy. ESPN
[3931.039s] posting over 20% ad growth in the
[3933.359s] quarter. Operating cash flow expected to
[3935.68s] be 17 billion. Management raised
[3937.76s] guidance. Uh what else what else do you
[3940.0s] want to talk about ladies and gentlemen?
[3941.359s] I mean this isn&#39;t this is easy. This was
[3943.44s] so these things you don&#39;t have to think
[3945.119s] about. You don&#39;t have to think about you
[3947.039s] don&#39;t have to stay up at night thinking
[3948.4s] about should I buy Boeing at $130?
[3951.119s] Should I buy Disney at $85? These are
[3953.839s] no-brainers. And the problem is uh you
[3957.52s] know there&#39;s there&#39;s two ways to
[3958.96s] interpret the word no-brainer. and the
[3960.799s] the people that pass on these
[3962.319s] opportunities uh you know no comment.
[3964.96s] All right, so moving along
[3967.16s] GXO. So look, Price has followed cash
[3970.4s] flow. There&#39;s no uh accident about that.
[3973.359s] We saw they got the new
[3976.119s] um uh the new board members. These guys
[3979.599s] aren&#39;t coming on because they think the
[3981.039s] company&#39;s going to fail. They&#39;re coming
[3982.16s] on because they know it&#39;s going to be
[3983.2s] the best logistics company in the world
[3985.039s] and they&#39;re taking advantage of the
[3986.319s] weakness in the market to cobble up. The
[3988.64s] CMA decision is going to be finished.
[3990.64s] Um, first off, increased first quarter
[3993.44s] revenue was plus 21% year-over-year to
[3996.16s] three billion. Organic revenue grow
[3999.0s] 3%. Uh, sales pipeline to three
[4001.92s] three-year high of 2.5 billion. That&#39;s
[4004.16s] excluding the Winkitin business, which
[4006.319s] is under the CMA review after the fact.
[4010.4s] Uh, they also repurchased almost three
[4012.839s] million shares, 2.8 8 million reaffirm
[4016.16s] fullear organic revenue growth and
[4017.839s] adjusted EBID
[4022.359s] guidance.
[4024.28s] Okay, they have Boeing as a client by
[4026.48s] the way. That&#39;s pretty cool. New win,
[4030.359s] Aldi, Kimberly Clark, Nike,
[4034.92s] ASOS. Cash
[4036.92s] flow operating cash flow was 29 million.
[4041.839s] Free cash flow is negative, but that&#39;s
[4043.839s] normal this time of year. So, let&#39;s
[4045.119s] cover the key points. Sales pipeline
[4047.52s] three-year high at 2.5 billion, up 13%
[4049.92s] year-on-year. Winkington and CMA review
[4052.559s] process is now in its final stages with
[4054.24s] an outcome expected in a few weeks. An
[4056.319s] integration set to begin before the Q2
[4058.559s] earnings call. Management expects either
[4060.4s] full clearance, which would be $10 in
[4062.96s] the stock, maybe 20 of the deal, or a
[4066.559s] request to divest the grocery business,
[4068.559s] which makes up only about 6% of the
[4070.72s] original Winkington business and has
[4072.64s] much lower margins than the overall
[4074.4s] business. Management continues to expect
[4076.64s] 58 million in cost synergies once
[4078.48s] integrated, providing a margin tailwind
[4080.48s] as 2025 progresses. after announcing a
[4087.24s] 500 million share repurchase pro 5
[4091.359s] billion share repurchase program earlier
[4092.96s] in the year. Management
[4095.0s] purchased no 500 million put billion uh
[4099.04s] purchased 2.8 million shares for around
[4100.96s] 110 million. This reduced the share
[4102.56s] count by approximately 2.4% in this
[4105.279s] quarter alone. If Sustained GXO is on
[4107.199s] track to repurchase about 10% of the
[4109.04s] overall float this year, which means you
[4110.719s] own you get a 10% larger slice of the
[4113.679s] pie without putting out one new
[4117.48s] penny. GXO signed a landmark 10-year
[4120.48s] deal with England&#39;s National Health
[4121.92s] Service supply chain, the largest
[4123.679s] contract on record with a lifetime value
[4125.359s] of around 2.5 billion. Operations are
[4128.4s] expected to begin in early TW uh Q3. Uh
[4132.239s] management doesn&#39;t anticipate
[4134.159s] significant startup costs and expects
[4135.6s] the deal to be major catalyst for
[4137.04s] expansion to healthcare with a strong
[4139.199s] new pipeline of healthcare related
[4140.96s] customers expected to be announced in
[4142.48s] Q2. Surprise, surprise. Why do you think
[4144.56s] all these directors are coming on board?
[4146.4s] Management reaffirmed the 2025 outlook
[4148.48s] expecting organic revenue growth of 3 to
[4150.319s] 6% IBIDA 840 to 860 million normal
[4153.839s] operating environment. These results
[4155.359s] would have had led to an increase in the
[4157.279s] fullear outlook. To put this in context,
[4159.52s] management is projecting an 8% gross
[4161.52s] organic wins for the year. And in Q1
[4164.159s] alone, they booked 228 million,
[4166.08s] delivering about 7% organic growth. This
[4169.12s] essentially implies no incremental wins
[4170.88s] contributing to revenue for the rest of
[4172.319s] the year, despite an all-time high sales
[4174.159s] pipeline at 2.5 billion and the landmark
[4176.719s] NHS deal. Welcome to Sandbagger City.
[4179.279s] Six. Management has seen no material
[4181.04s] impact on the sales pipeline or customer
[4182.799s] demand due to tariffs and has no
[4184.239s] exposure to China. In fact, the added
[4186.159s] complexity of tariffs has provided a
[4187.679s] tailwind for outsourcing wins
[4189.04s] highlighting uh highlighted by a 41%
[4192.159s] increase in wins during Q1. Seven,
[4194.4s] operating return on invested capital was
[4196.159s] 45% well ahead of the long-term target
[4198.08s] of 30%. Free cash flow is an outflow of
[4200.4s] 48 million in line with normal
[4202.32s] seasonality and impacted by the delayed
[4204.48s] Wington synergies. Management continues
[4206.64s] to expect 25 to 30% 5% 25 to 35% of
[4210.239s] adjusted Ebida to free cash flow
[4211.84s] conversion for the full year.
[4218.04s] So call it 250 of free cash flow. AI and
[4222.56s] automation are now live at 20 different
[4224.8s] operations delivering record setting
[4226.32s] productivity improvements in stock
[4228.159s] replenishment, order allocation and item
[4230.56s] inspection management is beginning to
[4231.92s] see the first cost savings as results
[4233.6s] and expects to see savings continue
[4235.12s] ramping through 2025. North America was
[4237.44s] the strongest region in Q1 driven by
[4239.04s] strength in aerospace i.e. Boeing and
[4241.199s] industrial customers. Continental Europe
[4243.04s] continues to per perform well with
[4245.04s] slight weakness in volumes in the UK
[4246.48s] during Q1 expected to rebound through
[4248.239s] Q2. Overall, business is seeing similar
[4250.239s] trends heading into Q2. Weaker dollar
[4252.4s] and strengthening euro and pound are
[4254.32s] expected to be a strong tailwind for GXO
[4257.28s] in 2026 with an improvement over prior
[4260.159s] FX guidance if current rates hold
[4261.76s] through 2025. They&#39;re going to get
[4263.199s] better. So that&#39;s that. You can go
[4266.4s] through the call. We&#39;ve highlighted the
[4268.08s] important parts. And finally, Baxter
[4270.6s] update prices followed cash flow.
[4272.88s] There&#39;s no accident about that. But look
[4274.4s] what&#39;s happening to revenues. They&#39;re
[4275.679s] starting to recover. Return on capital
[4277.679s] is going up. Margins are going to
[4279.679s] improve from the cost cuts. Uh delever
[4282.56s] the balance sheet and moving forward to
[4285.6s] bigger and better things. You got to
[4286.8s] have a healthcare play. This is ours.
[4288.8s] This is going to be a good stock. You
[4290.88s] can go through the uh call and you can
[4294.719s] go through the analyst reports here.
[4297.84s] Fair value and this is in the midst of
[4299.76s] pessimism. Fair value 60% higher. Uh
[4303.04s] general almost it&#39;s actually more than
[4305.36s] 60% 55 it&#39;s almost 100%. Uh fear and
[4308.96s] greed starting to tick up. National
[4310.88s] Association of Active Investment
[4312.239s] Managers starting to play catch-up after
[4314.48s] the fact. Uh Russell 2000 earnings uh up
[4319.8s] 1.53% in the last 60 days. Top 30
[4322.239s] weights down 45 basis points for next
[4325.04s] year. S&amp;P earnings on the other hand are
[4327.56s] down 93 basis points for this year, 122
[4331.36s] basis points for next year, normal
[4333.76s] during this time of year. And then the
[4335.44s] CPI inflation number came in lower than
[4337.76s] expected, lowest in four years. And uh
[4340.96s] and now the Fed has no excuses with the
[4343.12s] tariffs. So uh with that said, let&#39;s get
[4346.239s] down to the ask me anything questions.
[4348.8s] For those of you who don&#39;t stick around
[4350.48s] for ask me anything, thank you for
[4352.08s] tuning in. We&#39;ll see you next week. For
[4353.92s] those of you who love the ask me
[4355.12s] anything, here we
[4356.6s] go. Jun Jin Jin Nan Chen asks about
[4362.48s] United. I continue to keep an eye on
[4364.56s] that. I continue to do nothing. Same
[4366.719s] thing that as they ask every single
[4368.719s] week, but
[4375.08s] um I think it&#39;s going to take some time.
[4378.48s] I I I would I should probably just stick
[4380.88s] an alert on this at $200 to $250. I
[4383.44s] don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever get it, but
[4384.64s] it&#39;s going to take some time. I mean,
[4385.92s] you basically got all these institutions
[4389.159s] completely just stuck in the stock. This
[4391.76s] thing has had a monster run, 60 bagger
[4394.88s] in, you know, a decade. I think this is
[4397.92s] going to consolidate for a while and uh
[4400.08s] I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a favorable
[4401.199s] environment for them. So, I&#39;m in no rush
[4402.64s] to do anything. Looks cheap relative to
[4404.8s] recency bias, but in absolute terms,
[4407.28s] it&#39;s run a lot. You still like Goose?
[4409.44s] Yes, I do. That was a tariff problem.
[4411.28s] They&#39;re going to be fine. China&#39;s coming
[4413.199s] back. We We have no problem with that,
[4415.28s] Jake. We haven&#39;t added, but uh we&#39;re
[4417.44s] very very comfortable with that. And
[4418.8s] GXO, absolutely, we&#39;ve added uh and um
[4422.159s] we&#39;re we&#39;re very comfortable with
[4424.199s] that. GXO, no-brainer there. Um, Mike
[4429.64s] Mos.
[4431.48s] Uh, we met
[4440.12s] at Oh, wow. Okay, cool. Uh, someone just
[4443.84s] invited me to play Aoyo
[4447.32s] Trabuko. That&#39;s a great course. The
[4449.679s] answer is yes. I&#39;d love to join you. Uh,
[4452.04s] Rick Richard VST is buying back a ton of
[4454.96s] stock. Do you ever consider any name
[4457.12s] near new highs that likely goes much
[4459.719s] higher?
[4463.0s] Um, no. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy anything at
[4466.4s] new highs.
[4470.28s] Um, my job is to find it when no one
[4473.04s] wants it, not when everyone wants it.
[4474.8s] This is a offshore driller, I think. Let
[4476.96s] me just double check. DST.
[4480.88s] there&#39;s someone promoting the out
[4482.239s] of this stock because I get the same
[4483.76s] question every single week and it seems
[4486.159s] like everyone&#39;s amped up on this and it
[4488.239s] sounds to me like they&#39;re going to get
[4489.679s] distributed on their heads. So, look,
[4492.48s] cash flow has been flat for three years.
[4494.48s] So, yeah, they&#39;re using that to buy back
[4496.8s] stock. What do they
[4498.6s] do? Is this a
[4502.44s] utility? Okay, so this is a utility. So,
[4505.44s] they&#39;re all thinking it&#39;s going to be
[4506.56s] the the uh AI derivative play. Just play
[4509.44s] it through coms. just play it through
[4510.88s] natural gas. It&#39;s a better derivative
[4512.8s] play at a lower price.
[4517.4s] Um, let me just take a look
[4520.52s] here. You missed this. Just it could go
[4524.4s] higher, but you missed it. I mean,
[4526.0s] bottom line is the time to be looking at
[4528.0s] this was when it was at $10 and $15 and
[4530.64s] and they couldn&#39;t give it away. At 200
[4532.56s] after a 10 bagger, you get the crumbs.
[4535.52s] if it goes to 250 to take that level of
[4537.88s] risk. Uh let&#39;s take a look
[4543.88s] here. Okay, so they&#39;re still
[4550.52s] growing and they&#39;re buying back shares.
[4553.04s] Okay, so that&#39;s that&#39;s not a bad thing,
[4554.96s] but they they bought
[4558.36s] back 30% of the float and the stock&#39;s up
[4562.4s] 10x.
[4565.719s] Um, generally a low return on invested
[4568.719s] capital business, free cash flow. Let&#39;s
[4571.84s] see what that&#39;s
[4576.44s] doing. It&#39;s down off last year. I just
[4580.56s] I&#39;ve I&#39;ve just seen this movie before. I
[4582.84s] understand like if you&#39;re just looking
[4586.8s] black and white at the data, if you&#39;re
[4588.56s] if you have 30 years of experiencing
[4591.04s] seeing these promotes come and go, you
[4593.28s] kind of just like, yeah, I&#39;ve seen this
[4595.28s] movie before. It&#39;s not going to end
[4596.96s] well. Does it go to 300 before it goes
[4598.719s] to 50? Maybe. But that&#39;s that&#39;s a
[4602.08s] trading gambling game. That&#39;s not really
[4604.08s] a game I want to play. Let&#39;s take a look
[4605.76s] at
[4610.199s] uh let&#39;s take a look
[4615.239s] at the
[4617.4s] liabilities long-term debt is 15
[4622.28s] billion up from five in 2016. Cash is so
[4627.04s] they got a billion dollars of cash and
[4628.48s] 15 billion dollars of debt and they&#39;re
[4631.36s] buying back stock like there&#39;s no
[4632.719s] tomorrow. Why don&#39;t you pay down a
[4634.159s] little bit of
[4642.12s] debt? Yeah, I I don&#39;t like that. I think
[4644.8s] this is a complete promote and they&#39;re
[4647.6s] buying back stock to get themselves out
[4649.28s] and and take a look at all the options
[4650.8s] they have. They&#39;re probably I I I&#39;ll bet
[4653.44s] there&#39;s a lot of exercising of options
[4655.28s] going on into that buyback. So, I&#39;m I&#39;m
[4657.92s] a pass unh same same thing. Uh good
[4661.12s] questions though, Rick. Uh Mike
[4663.719s] Mos, oh sorry, keep bringing that one
[4666.96s] up. Byron Firestone sent in a question
[4670.56s] earlier but forgot to include the United
[4672.159s] Healthcare. Everyone keeps asking me
[4673.52s] about No, not yet. Recency bias, ladies
[4676.159s] and gentlemen. You think it&#39;s cheap
[4677.679s] relative to this 10-year historic run.
[4680.719s] It I think the distribution is kind of
[4682.8s] just starting on that one. I I&#39;m not I&#39;m
[4685.36s] not going to touch that. I think in the
[4687.12s] short term it&#39;s going to bounce for
[4688.4s] sure. Uh, as a trade, yes, but as a
[4690.96s] long-term investment, no. It No. No.
[4696.76s] AEO from Dan S. I think we&#39;ve covered
[4700.159s] this a million times. Yeah, you get a
[4702.32s] bounce, but I
[4704.52s] mean, I like consumer discretionary
[4707.199s] right now. I think this is a trading
[4709.52s] stock. This is not the type of business
[4711.199s] I want to
[4712.679s] own. It&#39;ll be fine. It&#39;ll probably
[4714.96s] bounce up. You&#39;ll make eight or 10 bucks
[4716.56s] and get the hell out.
[4719.239s] Um,
[4720.58s] [Music]
[4724.44s] PII, same
[4726.36s] thing. Let&#39;s take a
[4728.44s] look. I don&#39;t like these uh recreational
[4731.44s] vehicle businesses. They&#39;re low quality,
[4733.44s] but they get beaten down enough. I know
[4736.719s] Fox FOXF was a big
[4740.12s] one. I mean, these revenues are like
[4744.0s] revenues and margins are just collapsing
[4745.76s] on this thing. I mean, maybe low rates
[4747.52s] will help
[4748.52s] it. I I don&#39;t like these businesses. I
[4751.44s] mean, let me look at FOFX. Everyone was
[4753.52s] asking when it was uh you know, when it
[4755.92s] was right here, everyone wanted to buy
[4757.679s] FOXF because of recency bias. You missed
[4760.08s] it. It&#39;s full distribution. This
[4761.84s] bottoming is going to take forever. I I
[4764.48s] I&#39;m just going to steer clear of that.
[4766.64s] Uh I don&#39;t like it, but it probably
[4769.44s] works as a trade. Muhammad
[4774.199s] A, hey, not a question but wanted to
[4776.56s] say, do you miss the good old days when
[4777.92s] China was uninvestable? Yeah, I do. I
[4780.56s] mean, you know, at some point you get,
[4783.679s] you know, it&#39;s like if it was still down
[4786.8s] in the 60s and 70s, would I be adding
[4788.88s] more? I mean, we got enough. I mean, we
[4790.8s] brought our basis down to 82 and change.
[4793.44s] I&#39;m fine. I mean, like, I got a so much
[4797.28s] Xi Jinping is getting a Christmas card
[4799.12s] for taking so long.
[4801.0s] Um, all right. That&#39;s David. All right.
[4809.08s] Brian. Okay. Brian Firestone. Byron
[4813.6s] Firestone asked, &quot;Hope you&#39;re well. Been
[4815.84s] sharing your podcast with all my friends
[4817.36s] and family because I think you&#39;re truly
[4818.88s] amazing. I&#39;ve learned a lot from you.&quot;
[4820.48s] Thank you. Very kind and I&#39;m very
[4822.4s] grateful for you doing that. Uh,
[4824.32s] hopefully be a client in the future, but
[4826.08s] not there assetwise yet. My question is
[4828.48s] that you&#39;ll get there. Uh my question is
[4830.56s] about Regeneron. Regeneron
[4831.76s] Pharmaceuticals seems like they are down
[4833.679s] about 55% from all-time high and
[4835.92s] earnings seems to have slowed since 2021
[4837.679s] but not over the past two years. Your
[4840.36s] thoughts? I&#39;ve been watching this one
[4842.719s] Byron. So um we haven&#39;t done anything
[4846.0s] yet. We generally don&#39;t like to buy
[4847.84s] individual biotech stocks. Uh we we own
[4851.04s] the basket XBI. I think that&#39;s the
[4853.04s] better way to play everything right now.
[4855.199s] But
[4857.88s] um it is a great
[4860.28s] company. I think their Ilia sales slowed
[4863.12s] last
[4865.4s] quarter. I mean cash flows come down.
[4868.159s] Revenues have been
[4869.64s] flat. Gross margins are really
[4872.56s] declining. So I I have to understand the
[4874.64s] turnaround story better.
[4878.92s] Um, this is one I&#39;d probably stick a
[4881.6s] alert on for under 500 and at 400 load
[4885.12s] the boat. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ll ever see
[4886.8s] that, but um I think it&#39;s going to take
[4889.6s] a little while to build a base on this
[4891.44s] one. I think you&#39;re right, but I think
[4893.76s] it&#39;s
[4895.08s] early and I want to see some signs of
[4897.76s] recovery first, which
[4899.22s] [Music]
[4901.48s] uh let me just take a look at a couple
[4903.92s] of things here.
[4928.48s] Yeah, still generating a lot of cash.
[4930.88s] What&#39;s going on with the share
[4937.48s] account? Pretty
[4940.92s] flat. Balance sheets probably fine.
[4960.28s] Yeah.
[4961.96s] Yeah. I mean, if you have a 10-year
[4964.08s] horizon, it&#39;s okay. I just don&#39;t see
[4965.76s] that it&#39;s actionable right yet.
[4969.719s] Um, Griffin
[4972.199s] Brown, what do you see will be the
[4974.08s] impacts of the drug price reductions on
[4975.6s] XBI? I wouldn&#39;t worry about it. They&#39;re
[4977.76s] just going to they&#39;re going to do spread
[4979.28s] it out across other countries. They&#39;re
[4980.96s] going to fight it. It&#39;s the drug
[4982.56s] companies always win. At the end of the
[4984.239s] day, it&#39;s always been that way. All
[4986.719s] right. Curious about
[4988.679s] IIPR. Um, in in one of those big new uh
[4992.0s] client accounts, XBI was a new position.
[4994.639s] It&#39;s no problem with that one. Um, and
[4998.32s] we generally never do ETFs except for
[5000.08s] that one sector. We only do individual
[5001.76s] companies. Curious about
[5011.239s] IIPR. This is for I think someone asked
[5013.76s] about this. There must be someone
[5014.96s] promoting this piece of crap. It&#39;s a
[5016.639s] like a
[5017.88s] weed
[5025.4s] re innovative industrial properties.
[5046.27s] [Music]
[5054.199s] Um regulated cannabis
[5057.08s] facilities taxes real year
[5062.36s] ended.
[5064.679s] Uh too many things outside of your
[5067.04s] control. Don&#39;t make life hard hard on
[5069.36s] yourself. just go
[5071.56s] after easier. Put that in the too hard
[5074.159s] pile. You can&#39;t you can&#39;t handicap
[5076.239s] what&#39;s going to happen in that industry.
[5077.92s] And if you can, there are probably
[5079.36s] better ways to play
[5085.239s] it. Mr.
[5087.39s] [Music]
[5088.84s] Hayes, when you decide to buy or sell
[5091.199s] stock based on fundamental
[5093.159s] thesis you have developed, do you ever
[5095.44s] use technical indicators to implement
[5096.96s] your buy or sell decision?
[5100.28s] Uh, pro
[5104.76s] tip. Yeah, I mean, I look at all the
[5107.28s] standard things, but they don&#39;t really
[5108.719s] play a bearing because if I&#39;m looking at
[5110.639s] it, it&#39;s already down a lot anyway. So,
[5112.4s] I&#39;m not worried about the last five or
[5114.28s] $10.
[5115.8s] Um, so the answer is no. That&#39;s more for
[5119.0s] trading. Uh, let&#39;s see here.
[5146.199s] Wait. All right. Here&#39;s a jokester
[5148.56s] saying he&#39;s Donald
[5153.48s] Trump. All right. That&#39;s not a question.
[5156.08s] That&#39;s a attempted joke. Appreciate it.
[5159.6s] Next time be funny and I will laugh. Uh,
[5162.639s] all right, Professor
[5167.8s] Tom. Yeah, portfolio waitings I can only
[5170.48s] go through with
[5171.8s] clients. Uh, Nar
[5178.44s] Bonsel
[5182.12s] Microchip. I think we&#39;ve covered this
[5184.32s] one. I don&#39;t like
[5188.6s] it, but it probably
[5193.719s] works.
[5203.88s] MCHP.
[5205.719s] Yeah, I don&#39;t know. With this much
[5208.92s] deterioration, the stock hasn&#39;t really
[5210.88s] fallen enough in my estimation to
[5214.0s] justify taking a bet. You know, if this
[5216.32s] if this was a $20 stock from 100 with
[5219.12s] this much deterioration in the business,
[5221.199s] I&#39;d be interested. But the fact that
[5222.48s] it&#39;s down like 30%, I don&#39;t like it. And
[5225.04s] there&#39;s no clear signs of turnaround
[5226.56s] yet, but it&#39;ll probably work as a trade.
[5235.96s] Um, all right. Here&#39;s a guy calling for
[5238.4s] the end of the world last week. I guess
[5241.44s] that was before the UK deal talking
[5243.36s] about must be reading a lot of Zero
[5246.159s] Hedge. Although Zero Hedge has turned
[5247.84s] more positive lately.
[5251.88s] Uh, all right. Drew Robinson says, &quot;Was
[5254.88s] reading the intelligent investor today
[5256.239s] and came across this line. quote, &quot;If he
[5258.48s] is the right kind of investor, he will
[5260.48s] take added satisfaction from the thought
[5262.8s] that his operations are exactly opposite
[5265.04s] from those of the crowd.&quot; End quote.
[5267.199s] Could not think of a more fitting line
[5268.719s] for the hedge fund tips community in
[5270.679s] 2025. I agree. Now to the question,
[5273.44s] thoughts on UPS may have covered this
[5275.04s] recently. I did cover it last week. I
[5276.88s] think it&#39;s right and I think it&#39;s a
[5278.4s] little bit early. So, um, I just think
[5282.48s] it&#39;s going to take a little time to
[5283.84s] build a base. they&#39;ve destroyed a lot of
[5285.44s] institutional holders. Uh I&#39;m willing to
[5288.56s] be wrong on that and miss it, but I
[5291.04s] think just give it a little bit more
[5292.8s] time. I I think if your time horizon is
[5295.6s] over five years, you should buy it now.
[5297.84s] But um I just I really like buying great
[5302.32s] businesses when they&#39;re just so
[5304.04s] destroyed. I mean, right now it&#39;s like,
[5306.08s] yeah, it&#39;s pulled back to where it was
[5310.92s] pre-COVID. Cash flow&#39;s starting to
[5312.96s] recover.
[5315.04s] margins are still
[5320.84s] crushed. Not yet for me, but I like the
[5323.52s] idea. Uh just not not right yet. So,
[5329.04s] with that said, we&#39;ll be back next week.
[5331.92s] I have no idea what time. I do know the
[5334.4s] place is going to be Dubai. I think
[5336.0s] it&#39;ll be on Tuesday. Uh in the meantime,
[5338.56s] make it a great one. Bye for now.
