**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Extremely Bullish → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Trapped bears forced to cover shorts
- Record buyback announcements
- Earnings exceeding expectations
- Trump's pro-market policies and accurate market calls
- Global M2 money supply booming, led by China

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is poised for continued upside due to a combination of technical factors (trapped shorts), strong earnings, and supportive macro policies. International markets and small caps are particularly attractive. The Fed is too restrictive and will eventually ease.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Earnings Growth | 13.4% vs 6% estimated | Earnings came in twice as good as expected, even in the face of uncertainty. |
| S&P 2026 Earnings | $300/share | We're only trading at 18.5 times compared to 18.3 times for the last 10-year average. So there's a lot to do. |
| Record Selling in April | $1.1 Trillion | Record selling in the hole by hedge funds and CTAs. Now you have a whole slew of forced buyers that are not only covering their shorts but are forced to chase up. |
| Buybacks | $665 Billion | Record amount of buyback announcements. These guys are in trouble. Okay, let let's just put it that way. As they chase up. |
| US Inflation Rate | Lower than September | US inflation rate is lower than it was in September when they did an emergency 50 basis point cut. Fed's too restrictive. |
| Global M2 Money Supply | Booming | Global M2 money supply is booming which means liquidity is coming into the market and largely it's coming from China. |
