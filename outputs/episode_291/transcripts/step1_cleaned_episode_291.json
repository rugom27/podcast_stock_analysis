Yahoo at 12:30 from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWe got tomorrow we've got the claimment countdown at 3:00 on Fox Business. We got Yahoo at 10 a.m. for the full hour. Yahoo at 12:30 from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nTrump put out that tweet on April 9th. He said, \"Now&#39;s a good time to buy stocks.\" The market&#39;s up 14%. Now you have record forced buyers. And I&#39;ll tell you what, with these inflation numbers, I think too late Powell is going to be a real thing. Inflation is lower than it was in September when they cut 50 basis points emergency cut. They&#39;re 150 basis points too restrictive right now. So I think you&#39;re going to see those odds come back a little bit for June even though they went out to September as of the last few weeks. And I think there&#39;s huge opportunity here. Then you take earnings. We&#39;re double what was expected this quarter in spite of all the uncertainty. Guidance has held strong. So we&#39;re very constructive on this market. Every new trade deal creates more forced buyers that sold $1.1 trillion dollars of equities at the exact low in early April. Did you know that\n\nLook at Stanley Black &amp; Decker yesterday, up 17% after the China deal was announced. Home building is going to come back the second half when uh Bessant works on the long end of the curve with the SLR. Uh that&#39;s going to bring down the 10-year Treasury by 30 to 70 basis points and you&#39;re going to see a boom in housing construction also as Trump opens up federal lands for starter homes.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nSo, it&#39;s uh trade, tariffs, trade negotiations. Where does this go from here in 90 days when the reciprocal tariffs uh on all the other nations expire in July? But then the president also comes out with this uh order on prescription drugs. Yeah. And if we can take a look at the prescription drug stocks coming up in a minute. You&#39;re you&#39;re really invested based on I don&#39;t want to say whims, but certainly the maneuvering of the White House. And if this was so bad, wouldn&#39;t the drug makers be much lower? That&#39;s ab absolutely right. I think what Charles said about a lot of people resisting it is so true. Do you know right at the lows in early April, you had one record selling in the hole by hedge funds and by CTAs. They sold $1.1 trillion of equities at the lows in April. So now what you have as you&#39;ve had this quick move up and then today the good news is you have a whole slew of forced buyers that are not only covering their shorts but are forced to chase up. So that is going to persist for a little bit. And then you couple it with the fact that even in the face of all this uncertainty and all the\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nHouse Republicans just under and we&#39;re back. And then yesterday I had a chance to go on the Big Money Show and do the full hour with Taylor Riggs, Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Dean McDow on Fox Business. Uh thanks to Stephen for cutting down the 40 minutes to the most important eight minutes. So, I&#39;m David McDow joined by my co-host Taylor Riggs, Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, and joining us for this hour, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. How do you invest in this kind of environment? Because it is a market that is very much driven by what the White House is doing. So, it&#39;s uh trade, tariffs, trade negotiations.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nWhere does this go from here in 90 days when the reciprocal tariffs uh on all the other nations expire in July? But then the president also comes out with this uh order on prescription drugs. Yeah. And if we can take a look at the prescription drug stocks coming up in a minute. You&#39;re you&#39;re really invested based on I don&#39;t want to say whims, but certainly the maneuvering of the White House. And if this was so bad, wouldn&#39;t the drug makers be much lower?

So now what you have as you&#39;ve had this quick move up and then today the good news is you have a whole slew of forced buyers that are not only covering their shorts but are forced to chase up. So that is going to persist for a little bit. And then you couple it with the fact that even in the face of all this uncertainty and all the headlines  that you mentioned, Dan, um earnings came in twice as good as expected, 13.4% earnings growth versus 6% estimated. Uh estimates didn&#39;t even come down that much for 2025. They came down from 270 to 265 about 3.6%. But 2026 held up in the face of this. So now that the floodgates are open that they&#39;ve kind of resolved this, this looks like a reasonable path forward. Uh now now managements can can have some confidence in moving ahead with investment, moving ahead with the different projects that they had on hold. Uh and we&#39;re going to get through this. Hard to paper, which they are. Um then that the market could see some disappointment. I would say one thing about that, Jackie, it&#39;s like Warren Buffett always said, if you wait for for the Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring. So, you know, we did a we did a conference call with our clients on April 7th when things looked really really dark and we went company by company and we went through their free cash flow. We went through their revenues. We went through their balance sheet and we said, &quot;Look, this is headline headline noise. These are durable businesses that have made it through multiple cycles. So, ignore the short-term\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nearnings came in twice as good as expected, 13.4% earnings growth versus 6% estimated. Uh estimates didn&#39;t even come down that much for 2025.

We went through their revenues. We went through their balance sheet and we said, &quot;Look, this is headline headline noise. These are durable businesses that have made it through multiple cycles. So, ignore the short-term\nheadlines . Yes, there, you know, it&#39;s creating a lot of volatility. You know what? They survive the most high rates.&quot; Yeah. Well, I think Bessant is on top of that, managing the long end of the curve. They&#39;re going to deregulate the banks. They&#39;re the banks are going to be back in the market and he&#39;s going to be able to take control of the long end of the curve. Uh I remember when the 10-year yield went up to 480 and everyone was saying 5% 5%. I said, &quot;We&#39;re going below four before we go above five.&quot; And I&#39;m holding true to that. And I think the second half, the biggest surprise in the second half of this year is going to be you&#39;re going to see mortgage rates, 30-year fixed rates under 6%. And you&#39;re going to see a boom in housing and construction and suppliers to housing that we haven&#39;t seen in years. And that&#39;s going to be uh fueled by the Taylor Rigs of the world that are having new families, moving out to the suburbs, uh having the buying a house, buying extra cars is there. You bet. Get here and get a good tax cut done with corporate tax cuts. Man, I might be with you in the second half of this year that it could be really impressive. Yeah, there there&#39;s no question. You know, it&#39;s interesting. Trump put out that tr tweet or truth on April 8th and he said now&#39;s a good time to buy stocks and that was the bottom and it absolutely rallied and then last week he did the same thing. He said watch out you know there was a little uncertainty last week before the UK deal. Watch out America is going to boom and that was the intermediate term bottom. So you got to listen to the president. This guy is is on fire. I mean, his calls have have been working uh and uh and it&#39;s substantiated by earnings and now we&#39;re getting certainty and I think we move to growth just like Brian was referencing when we start the tax massive tax cuts and the deregulation with banks with industry with bringing manufacturing make it easy to get zoning and and so on. So, so this is\n\nfrom an investor standpoint, I would use the opportunity. Any dip in high quality airlines is an opportunity to buy. Consumer confidence with these trade deals is going to come back. Travel is going to accelerate into the summer like it does every single year. Uh, and uh, and we&#39;ll be looking for opportunities. Oh, you&#39;re so glass. Half full today. Opportunities in the crisis. He&#39;s very optimistic. Constantly on the phone, which is so disruptive to your sleep cycle. So, that&#39;s what I need to work on. Well, you could just become a golfer because if you pull your phone out while you&#39;re golfing, people will look give you the evil eye. Do not mess up the round. So, I do it in small doses, four hours at a time, but beyond that, I think if I was disconnected for one day or two days, my clients would fire me. So, uh I need to be available, but four hours at a time. Even at the retreat, you get to use the phone in your room. Yeah. So, you wouldn&#39;t disconnect. If you send your clients on the retreat, then they&#39;ll never contact you. The best of all worlds. Dan, this one in theory doesn&#39;t have to report to an office, but it&#39;s because your computer is right here. That&#39;s right. With with opportunity comes responsibility. So, if you can be out and about, you can be on on your life, you know, doing your life, but available. It&#39;s kind of a good blend and flexibility. People have uh more flexible lives. They can pick up their kids at soccer practice, but still be plugged in, answer emails if it&#39;s during work hours. So, we just have to kind of weigh the pros and the cons. And I think just shut it off at certain times, particularly when you&#39;re playing golf or or uh or on the weekend or certainly in bed. Maybe maybe get a white lotus box outside your bedroom door and you drop the phone in before you go. I&#39;m zooming back over a trillion dollars in market value with the stock rallying to its highest level since February. Um I just want to get your take, final thoughts. You were very optimistic, glass half full on this market. Um you think we continue to rally from here? I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through in the next few days. I think everyone&#39;s going to come into the market\n\nI think we&#39;re going to get some follow through in the next few days. I think everyone&#39;s going to come into the market finally . All the holdouts, all the people short covering, they&#39;re going to chase up and then we&#39;ll get some consolidation probably a few days out, some sideways grind, maybe a few percent pullback just to punish the Johnny come lately and then we push to new highs.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think last time you joined us, you were pretty bullish and since then, we&#39;ve seen the S&amp;P 500 rise. What do you make of this deal and where it puts us for equities? This is a landmark deal. This is a landmark morning. Uh particularly, here&#39;s the phrase of the day, trapped bears. Okay, we had record selling. $1.1 trillion was sold at the absolute lows in early April by hedge funds and CTAs. Now they&#39;re forced to cover. They&#39;re forced buyers. They&#39;re forced to chase up. You couple that with record amounts of buyback announcements. 665 billion of buybacks announced. These guys are in trouble. Okay, let let&#39;s just put it that way. As they chase up. So, I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through for the next few days. Once everyone gets in the boat 3 4 days from now we probably start to get a little bit of consolidation a little bit of pullback for the Johnny come lately. That&#39;s just the way it always works. Yeah. So what does this tell us? Has it been a change in true direction or is this still a very dynamic trading market? Yeah. I you know it&#39;s interesting. I look at earnings and earnings in the face of all of this uncertainty and all the let&#39;s be candid chaos that was going on for a couple of months. uh came in so much better than expected 13.4% versus 6% estimated with 90 90% recorded. Then you look at the guidance estimates didn&#39;t come down that much. They came down from 270 to 265 3.6% reduction. But 2026 held up at $300, which means we&#39;re only trading at 18.5 times compared to 18.3 times for the last 10year average. So there&#39;s a lot to do. I think you got to really start to look at the things that were hit hardest by tariffs are going to be the greatest recovery opportunities. And already we&#39;re seeing some of these semiconductors, technology names, riskier stocks, ones with a higher beta, certainly ones that sold off dramatically. I think the semiconductor index at one point was down 40% um in that April 2nd announcement. Those seem to be the ones coming back the most. Is that what you see? I think so. The other thing I&#39;m looking at is cyclicals relative to defensives is at a record all-time low positioning. So cyclicals, we start to look at consumer discretionary, we start to look at industrials, we start to look at materials. Uh maybe you even start to, you know, look a little bit over at energy because you you noted this morning that the S&amp;P was up certain percent, the Dow was up a certain percent. You know, was up more than all of them. Russell Small Cap index, largest short interest on record. So if this the game is on is really what it comes down to. And I and I think you&#39;ll see it in the indices for sure, but there are so many stocks that are still down 50%, 60%, 70% that are great businesses that have been around for decades that are going to start to fly. Interesting. Other particular stocks on your radar? Yeah. Uh Disney, we came out publicly like 3 4 weeks ago. It was a no-brainer. We said buy Disney at $85. Of course, the next few days it went down to like $82 because that&#39;s what always happens. But now it&#39;s at 108. It&#39;s going to continue to climb over the next two years, probably over 200 in our view. Uh, every all of their segments are growing at mid- teens, double digits. They just put guidance out for $17 billion of cash from operations this year. So, this is this is a well-run business. 180 million streaming subscribers. They grew 2.5 million. So, there&#39;s a lot of good things happen there. They&#39;ll continue to invest. We we saw the park in Abu Dhabi. They&#39;ll continue to invest in the cruise ships which have a very high return on invested capital like mid20s return on invested capital. So that business is going to continue to grow. And then the second one I have uh no one is going to buy when I when I when I put out this name. They&#39;re all going to like you know say this guy&#39;s crazy. And then a year from now we&#39;re going to be back on and be like do you remember last year? It&#39;s called Albamar. It&#39;s the number one lithium producer positioning for materials. materials is going to have the highest earnings growth, second highest earnings growth in 2026. You&#39;re getting positioned ahead of time. Lithium isn&#39;t a glut. Everyone thinks EVs are done except for the fact the US is 10% of the market. China is 60% of the market. It&#39;s not a natural market. It is a subsidized market. It is policy initiative. They grew EV sales 38% last month. Albamaro&#39;s lowest cost producer. They&#39;ve got these mines in Chile and they&#39;ve got $3.1 billion of liquidity to ride this out. So as all the smaller players go out of business as prices are down that shrinks supply album is left standing and the operating leverage is huge. This one you know we talked about Disney going up whatever it was a double plus from from this thing can go up a lot more than that over the next 3 to 5 years as the the market demand for lithium from 1.2 million metric tonses today to 3.2 two just in five years. And and uh so we&#39;re not looking at a triple because the operating leverage in that business could be a lot more than that. So that&#39;s a good one. It&#39;s a long-term one. It&#39;s whatever $61 today. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll go to 55 tomorrow, but a year from now it&#39;s going to be a lot higher. I can tell you that right now.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nss. 180 million streaming subscribers. They grew 2.5 million. So, there&#39;s a lot of good things happen there. They&#39;ll continue to invest. We we saw the park in Abu Dhabi. They&#39;ll continue to invest in the cruise ships which have a very high return on invested capital like mid20s return on invested capital. So that business is going to continue to grow. And then the second one I have uh no one is going to buy when I when I when I put out this name. They&#39;re all going to like you know say this guy&#39;s crazy. And then a year from now we&#39;re going to be back on and be like do you remember last year? It&#39;s called Albamar. It&#39;s the number one lithium producer positioning for materials. materials is going to have the highest earnings growth, second highest earnings growth in 2026. You&#39;re getting positioned ahead of time. Lithium isn&#39;t a glut. Everyone thinks EVs are done except for the fact the US is 10% of the market. China is 60% of the market. It&#39;s not a natural market. It is a subsidized market. It is policy initiative. They grew EV sales 38% last month. Albamaro&#39;s lowest cost producer.

And and uh so we&#39;re not looking at a triple because the operating leverage in that business could be a lot more than that. So that&#39;s a good one. It&#39;s a long-term one. It&#39;s whatever $61 today. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll go to 55 tomorrow, but a year from now it&#39;s going to be a lot higher. I can tell you that right now. And now where is  the demand coming from, Thomas? You see it around the world or specifically in China? Predominantly China. Also, it it is going to be around the world because it is a cyclical thing, but also energy storage is a big component to this. It&#39;s not just EVs and as you need more and more of these devices and you need uh the demand is unlimited for this and and the tariffs really hit it. The glut in the cycle really hit it. But you know what? If you look at the long-term chart, this happens every 3 to 5 years for Albamaro. It happens every 3 to 5 years for lithium. They have a few other businesses that&#39;ll support them through this. But they&#39;ll be the last man standing and they&#39;ll reap all the benefits as we recover. You know, it&#39;s interesting. Um it&#39;s obvious right based on the market observations that we can see that the president is able to move the markets with his commentary and changes in policy. T\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat&#39;s where is  the demand coming from, Thomas? You see it around the world or specifically in China? Predominantly China. Also, it it is going to be around the world because it is a cyclical thing, but also energy storage is a big component to this. It&#39;s not just EVs and as you need more and more of these devices and you need uh the demand is unlimited for this and and the tariffs really hit it. The glut in the cycle really hit it. But you know what? If you look at the long-term chart, this happens every 3 to 5 years for Albamaro. It happens every 3 to 5 years for lithium. They have a few other businesses that&#39;ll support them through this. But they&#39;ll be the last man standing and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll reap all the benefits as we recover.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nYeah, I you know it&#39;s interesting. I was thinking about that on the way down here. Uh I was pretty certain we were going to have two cuts this year at the back half of the year. Uh moving forward, you know, if this continues in the same vein, I think one cut, we&#39;re probably still going to wind up with two cuts because we&#39;ll get this initial high and then we&#39;re going to say, well, you know what, there was some short-term damage done to small businesses. It&#39;s going to take them a couple quarters to recover. So, I think one to two is still a safe bet this year. I think Besson&#39;s working on the long end of the curve which is more important as it relates to housing as it relates to refinancing the debt. Uh so all in all very sanglin here and uh pleased to see this. It did come a bit sooner than we expected.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nthat&#39;s the Federal Reserve and how it decides to respond to these policy changes as well as some of the economic data that we&#39;ll get this week. What does that mean for the markets? The fact that the latest indication from Jerome Pal is that he is going to take his time. I was pretty certain we were going to have two cuts this year at the back half of the year. Uh moving forward, you know, if this continues in the same vein, I think one cut, we&#39;re probably still going to wind up with two cuts because we&#39;ll get this initial high and then we&#39;re going to say, well, you know what, there was some short-term damage done to small businesses. It&#39;s going to take them a couple quarters to recover. So, I think one to two is still a safe bet this year. I think Besson&#39;s working on the long end of the curve which is more important as it relates to housing as it relates to refinancing the debt.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwe expected resolution. We didn't expect it this quickly. Uh it's it's unreal. And right now it's exacerbated by the fact that the phrase of the day is called trapped bears. Okay, we had record selling by hedge funds and CTAs at the absolute low in early April. So now the market's come so far so fast even before today and they were praying for a retest of the lows that never came. So now they've got to buy up. They're forced buyers. They're forced covering. So this could probably get some continuation, some followthrough for the next few days because so many people are structurally off sides. So what are you expecting now? Cuz yes, you you made the point about trap bears before we had any deal on the table between the US and China. And all we had on the table was the framework of a deal between the US and and UK. So you call them the trap bears. How do you see this forced buyer dynamic playing out? Well, they got to catch up. And and what's interesting is who's been buying from these trap bears. We have a record amount of announced buybacks from companies. $665 billion. So, they're buying, these poor guys are trying to cover their shorts, trying to catch up, trying to chase up uh uh the rally. So, my guess is this is going to continue for a few days. They're going to force them in after a huge move off the bottom even before today. And then we'll probably get a little bit of volatility as people digest like oh we've got 90 days etc etc. So expect a little shortterm material followthrough but it's very interesting on uh April 7th or April 8th Trump went out on truth or Twitter or whatever social media platform and he said now's the time to buy stocks and no one believed him and the next day the market went up. Last week he did the exact same thing when people were getting pessimistic before the UK deal and he said America is going to boom and he also referenced stocks. So if they say you know everyone was looking for the Fed put and the Treasury put the Trump put is real. He's paying attention. He listens to people and why we were optimistic and why we were positioned for this not to happen so soon but positioned for this to happen uh eventually is because he's shown and the administration has shown flexibility and and rationality throughout this process. He genuinely does want to negotiate better deals. And if you remember the first term, the people with assets like me that manage money, we did okay. It was a good four years. that everyday people that work every day, the middle class, the lower middle class, they did better than ever during those four years. And that's what President Trump wants to see. And it's deals like this and initiatives like this that is that is going to create that. You won't see it in a week, but over the next few months and couple years, you're going to start to see that middle class. We've we have seen more flexibility come up than come to pass than we initially saw at the beginning of April. Um, but I do wonder if some of that is because of the leadership shift shift that we saw with essentially the Treasury Secretary with uh Besset leading versus Navaro. They did put Navaro in the closet for a few weeks which was, you know, a welcome reprieve uh by yours included. However, I will say I, you know, Lutnik did get the job done with the UK and that kind of paved the way for positive talks with Bessant over the weekend. So, I got to give credit where credit's due. And, uh, President Trump has made no bones about he wants to be recognized as one of the greatest presidents in history. If stuff like this continues to happen and him cleaning up methods, messes that have been going on for decades. I'm not blaming anyone administration. Republican administrations, Democratic administrations neglected to do this. If he cleans this up, he's got a shot at his goal for sure. Okay. And let's talk about you mentioned the buybacks at record levels. Uh so how important is that in terms of driving momentum? Well, there's no question you've got CTAs and hedge funds covering now chasing up now $665 billion of buyback announcements. Oh, and by the way, earnings in the face of all of this uncertainty and craziness, earnings were came in much better than expected. 13.4% earnings growth versus 6% estimates. And the forward guidance hasn't come down that much for 2020. Some of them have and then some haven't even given guidance. Yeah. Yeah. Fair. But listen, let's look at S&P earnings for 2025 came down to, you know, basically from 270 to 265 about 3.5% since the beginning of the year. That's pretty material. However, 2026 backend loaded still $300 a share of earnings, which implies we're trading at about 18 1.5 times compared to the 10-year average of 183. Okay, there's still things to do. And then so speaking of things to do, I know you have some picks. Um, you like Disney. Tell us about your thesis there and if you still like it. Yeah, it, you know, it's interesting. We were pounding the table publicly for Disney. It got down to like 85 and then after we went out buy it at 85. I think it went to like 83 or 81, of course. Uh, and now it's at 108. We think over the next two years, this is a $200 stock. They're hitting on all cylinders, whether it's the parks, whether it's the cruise experience, whether it's the consumer products. And they just guided they said we're going to do $17 billion of cash from operations this year. That ship and by the way 180 million subscribers they're second to Netflix. They added 2 and a2 million. They're going to do this ESPN. Their sports business is through the roof. So we continue to like it despite the fact it's moved up so much in the last few weeks. And the Abu Dhabi um Yeah, that doesn't hurt either. Yeah. And what else is on your list? Uh oh, here's one that no one's going to want to buy. Albam Marl. Okay. This is Okay. Tell me about this one. Yeah, you know me. I'm early and people like there are sometimes some kicks on your list. I'm like, huh? And then a year later we sit down, you're like, \"Oh, that was pretty good.\" All right. So, Albamaro, number one lithium producer. Also lowest cost lithium producer. Lithium prices are in the garbage. Why? Because everyone says EVs are out of favor. Blah blah blah. China is 60% of the EV business. It's not a natural market. It's a government subsidized market. They have an initiative. They're going to continue to grow. They grew EV sales 38% last month in China. So what's going to happen? As one of the biggest producers, you just wait it out. Lithium prices are very cyclical. Every few years they go up and down. We're at the trough right now. They've got $3.1 billion of liquidity to sit it out. All the small players will go out of business. That shrinks supply. Demand continues to go up. And energy storage is a big thing. Overall demand from 1.2 million metric tonses right now to 3.2 in the next 5 years. Albam Marorrow, you know, we talk about Disney going going up to 200. Albam Marorrow could be a triple over the next three to five years. Really? Okay. Because we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of um I don't know if they're going to pull it back up again, but we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of lithium. The chart looks like that. I'm going to I'm going to tell you something right now. It's at $61. It's going to go let's say it's going to go right after I get off the air. It'll probably go to $55. Everyone will say that guy's an idiot. two a year and a half from now, you're going to have me on, Diane. And the thing's going to be over 100, probably closer to 150.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nOkay. All right. You heard it here first. That's Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Our thanks to Tom. And we're back. Quote of the week. The biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist. That's Ray Dallio. Uh that's called recency bias. We cover it very frequently on the show.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAnd when we did that special call for clients on April 7th or 8th, whatever it was the day before Trump tweeted, \"Now's a great time to buy stocks.\" Um we went through that and we said, \"Listen, look at the revenues. Look at the free cash flow. Look at the balance sheet.\" And we went company by company by company and and we said if there was ever a time if you you know we've never asked number one we've never asked anyone to invest. Okay people come to us that listen to the podcast or come from referrals of people etc. Number two we've never asked existing clients to put in more money. They put in more money as they get more money as we deliver results. That's the way it works. Uh but we didn't do it twice. We did it in October 2022 and the people that took advantage of that uh just we crushed it. Okay. because they were throwing a uh uh Amazon out. They were throwing everything was getting thrown out with the bathwater. Amazon and Google were quick doubles in a year. And then um and then the last time we did it was just four weeks ago.

And then we&#39;ve got our RBC  stuff.\n\n Sloomer . You can see the quick recovery. We've had V-shaped recovery so far with, by the way, momentum kind of just turning, which is also pretty surprising. Um, so so you can kind of see where we are now. This is an area where you would normally find a little consolidation and a little bit of rest, but you know, if the deal things keep climbing across the tape and you got all these trapped bears that we talked about, you you don't want to be uninvested. That's what I can tell you right now. I mean, even if you get a 3 4% pullback to to knock out the Johnny come lately before we push push forward to new highs, um just just hang tight. It's it's pretty exciting. You're seeing the advanced decline line and breath is very very strong as it broke out above this. Sometimes you see these breakouts and then a back test before you go to new highs. So just be aware of that. Don't worry about it. Small caps just getting started. Short interest at a record high. Super excited about this group. A and by the way, those were the biggest movers yesterday. Um bullish and bearish sentiment survey. still super bearish but starting to slowly move bullish off of super extreme like you saw in the great financial crisis uh after the lows which is pretty exciting. MCI Europe uh you could see here starting to move. DAX is already at new highs broke out. I mean, this is the international relative to US story that um we came into the year strong pounding the table on that's playing out in real time. You probably get a short-term counter trend of that maybe with the DAX go back and retest US continued strength. Hang Sang just getting started into in its recovery. Super excited about Alibaba. They're going to report this week by the way. So, um 10-year yield trading in this range. This is going lower. Pay attention. Google SLR uh Bessant and you will see what's going to take place in the second half of this year when they change capital requirements. uh and uh government guaranteed securities like treasuries are exempt from capital requirements which means they're going to be able to hold a lot more which means they're going to be buying banks are going to be able to buy a ton uh of treasuries and they're they're incent the way they're structured they they buy the short end of the curve but what that will enable the Fed to do is uh sorry not the Fed the Treasury to do is operation twist where they can sell short-term and use the proceeds to buy long-term to bring down the long end of the curve which helps uh most importantly mortgage rates followed by auto rates to some extent um and brings down the refinancing cost for the country because if we can issue unlimited short-term to banks and and they can uh and they can earn then we can buy in the long end of the curve bring that down refinance the the uh long end of the curve at low rates and push out the maturities which is really what we want to do. Difference between US power demand growth and US GDP flipped with latest data. So uh you can see power demand is turning up. That's that's what you see when GDP goes up. So you can see that this was a fake out of inventory pull forwards 10-year yield. The counter trend move that we talked about. Maybe it goes back up to 583 before going into the 3s. Uh I wouldn't hold your breath, but it's certainly possible. Uh 4558 level maybe. Uh dollar index. This is the counter trend move that we called for two weeks ago. Here it is. Maybe goes up to the back of this uptrend channel and then breaks back down. It's kind of comical talking about all this technical stuff. It absolutely plays no real role in what we do in buying great companies, but people like it. Uh, give the people what they want. Gold rolling over here as the dollar has a counter trend move. This is interesting from Strategus. Great shop there for research. They've got 20-day highs through 50% the first time since late 2023. And uh when you have percentage of stocks at a 20-day high that goes through 50% uh it tends to be a sign of immense strength and the the rally tends to follow through pretty dramatically even if you get a short-term check back before you power higher. And he goes all the way back and he shows all these instances recently in 2023 2022. Then he goes back to 2020 uh and shows what happened when that type of stuff happens coming out of COVID. Then he shows it in 2018 coming out of uh of the first Powell mishap. Uh then he shows it in 2015 and these are all follow-through rallies. Then he goes back to 2008 to 2013 how it worked every pretty much every single time. Then he shows 1972 to 1983. So this is an interesting indicator. Even if the markets moved a lot, when these extremes happen, it means there's strength behind it. And even if you get short-term checkbacks, it tends to precede big rallies. US is 64% of global equity market versus 61% average of the 2020s. It hasn't been this high. You got to go all the way back to June of 2003 when it peaked at 55% of global equities. And that's one of the indicators pointing to the theme that we've been talking about when it was unpopular that international would outperform US and it's dramatically outperformed this year and that trend will continue I think for the foreseeable future next handful of years. That doesn't mean the US is going to do poorly. What it means is that international pockets of international will outperform uh even if the US does okay which we believe it certainly will and then you've got China PBOC cutting rates by the way global M2 money supply is booming uh which means liquidity is coming into the market and largely it's coming from China. China was a source of illquidity for three years, draining liquidity. Now they are a source of expanding liquidity from all their stimulative practices uh and um and easing. So this is going to be a positive thing not only for China for but for the rest of the world. They're\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n a 20-day high that goes through 50% uh it tends to be a sign of immense strength and the the rally tends to follow through pretty dramatically even if you get a short-term check back before you power higher.

You got to go all the way back to June of 2003 when it peaked at 55% of global equities.

China was a source of illquidity for three years, draining liquidity. Now they are a source of expanding liquidity from all their stimulative practices uh and um and easing. So this is going to be a positive thing not only for China for but for the rest of the world. They&#39;re finally\n\npicking up the baton that the western world uh ran with during COVID and afterward. Now they are uh picking up the charge uh moving forward. So here&#39;s the asset quilt of total returns. You can see EHA is dramatically outperforming. EA is positive. S&P was negative. It might be might be positive or flat on the year after today. Emerging markets is outperforming all the things that we said. If you go back to the fourth quarter, I said the last shall be first, international, etc. and S&P is towards the lowest, international is towards the highest. And uh and there you go. Dollar faces a secular decline. So you&#39;ll get these counter trend moves, but we know the trend is down in the intermediate term. One month since the bottom, had a bounce in tech, industrials, consumer discretionary, financials, real estate, uh etc. have done very well. biggest four-week outflow from US stocks since May of 2023. Biggest tech outflow in 11 weeks. So that&#39;s in the last week or so. Consumers momentum remains. So this is the difference between hard and soft data. They say they&#39;re miserable, but they keep spending money. Then we look at uh AutoSAR for April was 17.3 million, ladies and gentlemen. So obviously a little bit pull forward with the tariffs, but now we got to replenish the the detocking cycle and uh there going to be incentives for car owners and you&#39;ve got a 13.5 year average car on the road. Uh lot of things going on here. So if this 17 plus can can continue, we&#39;re going to continue to see extraordinary things from Cooper Standard. Okay, I wouldn&#39;t expect this to be a straight line, but look at where the trend is going. Just like every single recovery, which was our thesis from day one when we put on that first huge position at $5 and change in May of 2022 and went on the claim and countdown on June 6th and pitched the stock and here we are 5x so far and just getting started. We think this is going to be a multibagger even from these levels. International versus US stocks rolling fourmonth performance spread. So internationals outperforming US by 16.2%. Ladies and gentlemen, the last time you saw that spike was the early 2000s and that trend continued for 5 years. It was one of the biggest periods of international outperformance over US. And uh and that&#39;s that uh number of consecutive weeks with AI bears above 50% was 11 weeks. You haven&#39;t seen that since the early 90s. You had an 8-year bull market after that and since the great financial crisis and you had a multi-year bull market after that. AI asset allocation lowest equity exposures since October 2023. Now is a time to be a buyer, not a seller. Global monetary stimulus is going through the roof. This is the threemon sum net number of rate cuts globally going up. What follows that? Global manufacturing PMIs. They&#39;re down here on the mat. They are going to spike up. firms plan to pass tariff related costs to consumers. Okay. Well, now the tariffs are a lot less than advertised. So, uh it&#39;s going to be less of a story. US companies buying back stock at a record pace. Most announced buybacks in more than a decade, 665 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Watch what people do, not what they say. Best one-mon return since 2020 uh off the COVID lows. That was a that was the best year. Unbelievable year. Uh rallies of this magnitude often have legs. Um one month rolling returns of these levels greater than 14% is often carried on with a forward 12-month return of 25% on average and positive 95% of the time since 1978. 56 instances. Average return after a month like that is six month return is like 14% 12-month return is 25%. Uh how you doing? Uh it&#39;s gonna be a fun time. So as Vney called me the resident bull uh I&#39;ll be willing to carry that title for some time to come. Uh average US gasoline price ahead of peak demand season. Uh EPS revision tracking near historical pattern a little bit better than historical pattern. uh announced buybacks versus actual. So, there&#39;s a lot of catch-up here. There&#39;s a further bid in the market. PBOC stimulus, we continue to cover active listings relative to the start of the year from realtor.com. They&#39;re picking up. Supplies coming on. That&#39;s good to see. Germany expected to inject up to $1 trillion into the military and infrastructure. Okay, that&#39;s a lot of pressure from Trump. That&#39;s good. University of Michigan consumer confidence at points like this when it&#39;s so flushed out they tend to perceive very good things in the equity markets companies are maintaining guidance more than usual and that&#39;s one point that I&#39;ve made despite all the uncertainty fact that this year only came down 3.6% 6% and next year has held up. Now that you see a lot of the tariffs coming down to 10% from these astronomical levels, I think we&#39;re going to just see uh guidance start to go back up and people are going to get excited. Retail investors at lower levels than 2019. Net inflows to US versus Europe. Systematic positioning in US equities. This is what we&#39;ve been talking about with regard to the CTAs and hedge funds. they haven&#39;t sold this much in the hole, been this short since the COVID lows and they missed, you know, what was like a 90% rally thereafter. Uh, and I think the same thing is happening right now. What what was forced sellers is now going to be forced buyers every positive headline. So, these type of opportunities don&#39;t come around that often, ladies and gentlemen. Institutional position in S&P 500. uh asset manager positioning well below the market&#39;s taken off without them. They are going to have to chase up just like every single time. Some potentially good news. S&P drops 10% in two days. When did he publish that? Anyway, 12 months later, the S&P is up 32.6%. So, we saw that in April. [Music] Uh here&#39;s the reciprocal tariffs, China&#39;s retaliatory tariffs, and now back down. So it went up to 14525, now it&#39;s down to 3010, which is a good place for it. ETF float. By the way, the big story, and my friend Jerry actually emailed me about this, who I met in Hawaii. He said uh the biggest thing and and this is a guy who ran one of the greatest banks of all time uh US bank and he said the biggest thing is the opening of China to US businesses. It&#39;s not the tariff rate and if they get these non-tariff barriers removed it is going to be boom time. Uh you know I&#39;ve said in past podcasts $1.1 trillion dollar of S&P revenues comes from China from the S&P 500. So if they open up more to US businesses, this is going to be a boom for China, a boom for the US like we&#39;ve never seen before. Our ETF flow tracker suggests national team has been buying to support the market in China. So uh you can see cumulative flows to the top five NT holding ashare ETFs. Uh net buyers. So the Chinese government is propping up the market until it takes on a life of its own. So they&#39;re they&#39;re in the game. They&#39;re\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSystematic positioning in US equities.

TW 2025 earnings growth estimates emerging markets 10.4% versus the US at 7.1% much lower multiple much higher growth. Where do you want to be? NASDAQ 100 re-enters bull market. So now it&#39;s up 20% after shortest bare market in history I guess. uh broadening other than COVID broadening breath equal weighted S&P 500 beats main index for six straight sessions that means under the surface is what&#39;s making money and the the clients can see it in their P&amp;Ls I mean it&#39;s unbelie February was like oh my gosh it&#39;s like through the roof and and now it&#39;s we it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s better than where we beyond overtook our high water mark uh and it&#39;s uh from the first quarter which is just awesome. I mean and the market&#39;s not even recovered yet which is even more awesome. So super exciting times. Broadening breath uh equal weighted got that next realized and consensus EPS growth for select US indices. Uh so you see Russell 2000 has the biggest growth rate small caps record short interest and biggest earnings growth for this year and next year relative to midcap relative to NASDAQ relative to equal weight relative to S&amp;P highest earnings growth lowest multiple get your small caps ladies and gentlemen because those shorts I talked about MoAS mother of all short squeezes This morning on Vanney with regard to the market, forced sellers became forced buyers. It&#39;s going to be nothing compared to what you&#39;re going to see in small caps. There&#39;s going to be some face ripping rallies in small caps. Mark my words. You can count on that. Can stocks get back to positive in 2025? Um, there&#39;s no question about it. There&#39;s no question about it. uh US inflation rate is lower than it was in September when they did an emergency 50 basis point cut. Fed&#39;s too restrictive. They&#39;re going to wake up. They no longer have the tariff excuse because the tariffs have come down. They&#39;ve got to get it get in action and remove the restriction and let people buy homes and cars and get on with their lives versus screw a bunch of millennials who want to buy houses because you want a plaque that says I&#39;m not Arthur Burns. The gap between US hard and soft data growth is among the largest in the since the 1970s. We&#39;ve covered this. People are super pessimistic, but they&#39;re still shopping like there&#39;s no tomorrow. That&#39;s continues. Fund manager equity allocation lowest since May 2023. All these people have to chase up now. They all have career risk. They missed it. They sold in the hole 1.1 trillion. Now they got to buy up and they&#39;re going to be forced in at new highs. It&#39;s it the story just continues to repeat. Long gold is the most crowded trade in the fund manager survey. Um that thing is that&#39;s going to be over sooner sooner rather than later. I know no one believes me. Uh but you know, hang tight. Uh earnings sentiment has now come back up in the S&P 500 like a hockey stick. So that&#39;s good to see. MAG7 has lagged the rest of the market year to date. That continues to be the case. S&P 493 are up 1%. S&P was down 3%. This was a couple of days ago. And the MAG 7 down 12%. That was a theme coming into 2024 five. Go back at the tapes was uh MAG7 will dramatically underperform. International will dramatically outperform. Both of those have held true. Goldman&#39;s positioning indicator deeply negative territory suggests there&#39;s room for stocks to rally. We agree. Uh what is this? Oh, this just shows S&P stocks above the 20-day, 50-day, and 200 day moving average. So, the 200 has got plenty of room to run here. The S&P just overtook the 200 day moving average. Take it for what it&#39;s worth. VIX below 20 is another another clue. The worst is over. 12 months out. Median return 10.3%. Advanced decline line continues to climb uh hits record high for the first time in a 100 days. One year later, average market&#39;s up 14.21%. Total US dollar futures positioning uh is getting shorter. So probably we have this counter trend rally go a bit lower first before getting a bigger bounce. We&#39;ll see what happens. uh we&#39;ll pay attention to the commitment of traders reports as stocks continue to claw back potential all-time highs. Remember that only twice in the past 75 years did stocks peak in February. Uh stocks tend to peak in December or January according to this Carson data. Chart of the day better than expected 1Q earnings. They were expected to be 6%. They came in at 13.4. S&P has surged since Trump said great time to buy. It surged by 14% since that tweet and by pure well it wasn&#39;t luck because I I&#39;ve just done this so many times I could tell we were at a peak crescendo of of fear and that&#39;s why I chose that day to do it and then sure enough that was the inflection uh which very similar to the COVID lows when I got quoted in that article uh and market watch saying we are buying during the 1918 Spanish flu the Dow was down 35 5% we&#39;re down 33%. Uh we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, but with all these great companies marked down, we&#39;re buying high quality businesses. Two days later, the market bottomed and never looked back. Uh S&P 500 rebound is one of the biggest under Trump era CTA positioning. Again, this is what we&#39;ve been talking about. They are forced buyers for the foreseeable future.

Now, automobile investors have two matters con considered. The possibility that electric vehicle tax credits could vanish and the potential for a new tax break on cars assembled in the US. House Ways and Means Committee set to release so-called markup details of bud budget reconciliation bill. Beautiful bill. Uh details have emerged. Repeal of EV tax credits. Uh, consumer credits will be repealed almost immediately while business tax credits will be phased out. Right now, consumers can claim a deduction. Duh. Just created a leasing loophole. Looks like commercial gradual phase out. A new tax break for American assembled cars is also part of initial market. Essentially, car buyers could deduct interest on auto loans from their taxable income if the car was made in America. Boom. Shakalaka, ladies and gentlemen.

Uh revenues were up 7%. Um free cash flow more than doubled. Uh they they guided 17 billion dollar of cash from operations this year.$180 million subscribers.

All right, so\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmoving along  GXO. So look, Price has followed cash flow. There&#39;s no uh accident about that. We saw they got the new um uh the new board members. These guys aren&#39;t coming on because they think the company&#39;s going to fail. They&#39;re coming on because they know it&#39;s going to be the best logistics company in the world and they&#39;re taking advantage of the weakness in the market to cobble up. The CMA decision is going to be finished. Um, first off, increased first quarter revenue was plus 21% year-over-year to three billion. Organic revenue grow 3%. Uh, sales pipeline to three three-year high of 2.5 billion. That&#39;s excluding the Winkitin business, which is under the CMA review after the fact. Uh, they also repurchased almost three million shares, 2.8 8 million reaffirm fullear organic revenue growth and adjusted EBID guidance. Okay, they have Boeing as a client by the way. That&#39;s pretty cool. New win, Aldi, Kimberly Clark, Nike, ASOS. Cash flow operating cash flow was 29 million. Free cash flow is negative, but that&#39;s normal this time of year. So, let&#39;s cover the key points. Sales pipeline three-year high at 2.5 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Winkington and CMA review process is now in its final stages with an outcome expected in a few weeks. An integration set to begin before the Q2 earnings call. Management expects either full clearance, which would be $10 in the stock, maybe 20 of the deal, or a request to divest the grocery business, which makes up only about 6% of the original Winkington business and has much lower margins than the overall business. Management continues to expect 58 million in cost synergies once integrated, providing a margin tailwind as 2025 progresses. after announcing a 500 million share repurchase pro 5 billion share repurchase program earlier in the year. Management purchased no 500 million put billion uh purchased 2.8 million shares for around 110 million. This reduced the share count by approximately 2.4% in this quarter alone. If Sustained GXO is on track to repurchase about 10% of the overall float this year, which means you own you get a 10% larger slice of the pie without putting out one new penny. GXO signed a landmark 10-year deal with England&#39;s National Health Service supply chain, the largest contract on record with a lifetime value of around 2.5 billion. Operations are expected to begin in early TW uh Q3. Uh management doesn&#39;t anticipate significant startup costs and expects the deal to be major catalyst for expansion to healthcare with a strong new pipeline of healthcare related customers expected to be announced in Q2. Surprise, surprise. Why do you think all these directors are coming on board? Management reaffirmed the 2025 outlook expecting organic revenue growth of 3 to 6% IBIDA 840 to 860 million normal operating environment. These results would have had led to an increase in the fullear outlook. To put this in context, management is projecting an 8% gross organic wins for the year. And in Q1 alone, they booked 228 million, delivering about 7% organic growth. This essentially implies no incremental wins contributing to revenue for the rest of the year, despite an all-time high sales pipeline at 2.5 billion and the landmark NHS deal. Welcome to Sandbagger City. Six. Management has seen no material impact on the sales pipeline or customer demand due to tariffs and has no exposure to China. In fact, the added complexity of tariffs has provided a tailwind for outsourcing wins highlighting uh highlighted by a 41% increase in wins during Q1. Seven, operating return on invested capital was 45% well ahead of the long-term target of 30%. Free cash flow is an outflow of 48 million in line with normal seasonality and impacted by the delayed Wington synergies. Management continues to expect 25 to 30% 5% 25 to 35% of adjusted Ebida to free cash flow conversion for the full year. So call it 250 of free cash flow. AI and automation are now live at 20 different operations delivering record setting productivity improvements in stock replenishment, order allocation and item inspection management is beginning to see the first cost savings as results and expects to see savings continue ramping through 2025. North America was the strongest region in Q1 driven by strength in aerospace i.e. Boeing and industrial customers. Continental Europe continues to per perform well with slight weakness in volumes in the UK during Q1 expected to rebound through Q2. Overall, business is seeing similar trends heading into Q2. Weaker dollar and strengthening euro and pound are expected to be a strong tailwind for GXO in 2026 with an improvement over prior FX guidance if current rates hold through 2025. They&#39;re going to get better. So that&#39;s that. You can go through the call. We&#39;ve highlighted the important parts.

For those of you who don&#39;t stick around for\n\nask me anything , here we go. Jun Jin Jin Nan Chen asks about United. I continue to keep an eye on that. I continue to do nothing. Same thing that as they ask every single week, but um I think it&#39;s going to take some time. I I I would I should probably just stick an alert on this at $200 to $250. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever get it, but it&#39;s going to take some time. I mean, you basically got all these institutions completely just stuck in the stock. This thing has had a monster run, 60 bagger in, you know, a decade. I think this is going to consolidate for a while and uh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a favorable environment for them. So, I&#39;m in no rush to do anything. Looks cheap relative to recency bias, but in absolute terms, it&#39;s run a lot. You still like Goose? Yes, I do. That was a tariff problem. They&#39;re going to be fine. China&#39;s coming back. We We have no problem with that, Jake. We haven&#39;t added, but uh we&#39;re very very comfortable with that. And GXO, absolutely, we&#39;ve added uh and um we&#39;re we&#39;re very comfortable with that. GXO, no-brainer there. Um, Mike Mos. Uh, we met at Oh, wow. Okay, cool. Uh, someone just invited me to play Aoyo Trabuko. That&#39;s a great course. The answer is yes. I&#39;d love to join you. Uh, Rick Richard VST is buying back a ton of stock. Do you ever consider any name near new highs that likely goes much higher? Um, no. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy anything at new highs. Um, my job is to find it when no one wants it, not when everyone wants it. This is a offshore driller, I think. Let me just double check. DST. there&#39;s someone promoting the out of this stock because I get the same question every single week and it seems like everyone&#39;s amped up on this and it sounds to me like they&#39;re going to get distributed on their heads. So, look, cash flow has been flat for three years. So, yeah, they&#39;re using that to buy back stock. What do they do? Is this a utility? Okay, so this is a utility. So, they&#39;re all thinking it&#39;s going to be the the uh AI derivative play. Just play it through coms. just play it through natural gas. It&#39;s a better derivative play at a lower price. Um, let me just take a look here. You missed this. Just it could go higher, but you missed it. I mean, bottom line is the time to be looking at this was when it was at $10 and $15 and and they couldn&#39;t give it away. At 200 after a 10 bagger, you get the crumbs. if it goes to 250 to take that level of risk. Uh let&#39;s take a look here. Okay, so they&#39;re still growing and they&#39;re buying back shares. Okay, so that&#39;s that&#39;s not a bad thing, but they they bought back 30% of the float and the stock&#39;s up 10x. Um, generally a low return on invested capital business, free cash flow. Let&#39;s see what that&#39;s doing. It&#39;s down off last year. I just I&#39;ve I&#39;ve just seen this movie before. I understand like if you&#39;re just looking black and white at the data, if you&#39;re if you have 30 years of experiencing seeing these promotes come and go, you kind of just like, yeah, I&#39;ve seen this movie before. It&#39;s not going to end well. Does it go to 300 before it goes to 50? Maybe. But that&#39;s that&#39;s a trading gambling game. That&#39;s not really a game I want to play. Let&#39;s take a look at uh let&#39;s take a look at the liabilities long-term debt is 15 billion up from five in 2016. Cash is so they got a billion dollars of cash and 15 billion dollars of debt and they&#39;re buying back stock like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Why don&#39;t you pay down a little bit of debt? Yeah, I I don&#39;t like that. I think this is a complete promote and they&#39;re buying back stock to get themselves out and and take a look at all the options they have. They&#39;re probably I I I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s a lot of exercising of options going on into that buyback. So, I&#39;m I&#39;m a pass unh same same thing. Uh good\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nutility? Okay, so this is a utility. So, they're all thinking it's going to be the the uh AI derivative play. Just play it through coms. just play it through natural gas. It's a better derivative play at a lower price. Um, let me just take a look here. You missed this. Just it could go higher, but you missed it. I mean, bottom line is the time to be looking at this was when it was at $10 and $15 and and they couldn't give it away. At 200 after a 10 bagger, you get the crumbs. if it goes to 250 to take that level of risk. Uh let's take a look here. Okay, so they're still growing and they're buying back shares. Okay, so that's that's not a bad thing, but they they bought back 30% of the float and the stock's up 10x. Um, generally a low return on invested capital business, free cash flow. Let's see what that's doing. It's down off last year. I just I've I've just seen this movie before.

They're probably I I I'll bet there's a lot of exercising of options going on into that buyback. So, I'm I'm a pass unh same same thing. Uh good questions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nthough, Rick. Uh Mike Mos, oh sorry, keep bringing that one up. Byron Firestone sent in a question earlier but forgot to include the United Healthcare. Everyone keeps asking me about No, not yet. Recency bias, ladies and gentlemen. You think it's cheap relative to this 10-year historic run. It I think the distribution is kind of just starting on that one. I I'm not I'm not going to touch that. I think in the short term it's going to bounce for sure. Uh, as a trade, yes, but as a long-term investment, no. It No. No. AEO from Dan S. I think we've covered this a million times. Yeah, you get a bounce, but I mean, I like consumer discretionary right now. I think this is a trading stock. This is not the type of business I want to own. It'll be fine. It'll probably bounce up. You'll make eight or 10 bucks and get the hell out. Um, PII, same thing. Let's take a look. I don't like these uh recreational vehicle businesses. They're low quality, but they get beaten down enough. I know Fox FOXF was a big one. I mean, these revenues are like revenues and margins are just collapsing on this thing. I mean, maybe low rates will help it. I I don't like these businesses. I mean, let me look at FOFX. Everyone was asking when it was uh you know, when it was right here, everyone wanted to buy FOXF because of recency bias. You missed it. It's full distribution. This bottoming is going to take forever. I I I'm just going to steer clear of that. Uh I don't like it, but it probably works as a trade. Muhammad A, hey, not a question but wanted to say, do you miss the good old days when China was uninvestable? Yeah, I do. I mean, you know, at some point you get, you know, it's like if it was still down in the 60s and 70s, would I be adding more? I mean, we got enough. I mean, we brought our basis down to 82 and change. I'm fine. I mean, like, I got a so much Xi Jinping is getting a Christmas card for taking so long. Um, all right. That's David. All right. Brian. Okay. Brian Firestone asked, \"Hope you're well. Been sharing your podcast with all my friends and family because I think you're truly amazing. I've learned a lot from you.\" Thank you. Very kind and I'm very grateful for you doing that. Uh, hopefully be a client in the future, but not there assetwise yet. My question is that you'll get there. Uh my question is about Regeneron. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems like they are down about 55% from all-time high and earnings seems to have slowed since 2021 but not over the past two years. Your thoughts? I've been watching this one Byron. So um we haven't done anything yet. We generally don't like to buy individual biotech stocks. Uh we we own the basket XBI. I think that's the better way to play everything right now. But um it is a great company. I think their Ilia sales slowed last quarter. I mean cash flows come down. Revenues have been flat. Gross margins are really declining. So I I have to understand the turnaround story better. Um, this is one I'd probably stick a alert on for under 500 and at 400 load the boat. I don't know if I'll ever see that, but um I think it's going to take a little while to build a base on this one. I think you're right, but I think it's early and I want to see some signs of recovery first, which uh let me just take a look at a couple of things here. Yeah, still generating a lot of cash. What's going on with the share account? Pretty flat. Balance sheets probably fine. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you have a 10-year horizon, it's okay. I just don't see that it's actionable right yet. Um, Griffin Brown, what do you see will be the impacts of the drug price reductions on XBI? I wouldn't worry about it. They're just going to they're going to do spread it out across other countries. They're going to fight it. It's the drug companies always win. At the end of the day, it's always been that way. All right. Curious about IIPR. Um, in in one of those big new uh client accounts, XBI was a new position. It's no problem with that one. Um, and we generally never do ETFs except for that one sector. We only do individual companies. Curious about IIPR. This is for I think someone asked about this. There must be someone promoting this piece of crap. It's a like a weed re innovative industrial properties. Um regulated cannabis facilities taxes real year ended. Uh too many things outside of your control. Don't make life hard hard on yourself. just go after easier. Put that in the too hard pile. You can't you can't handicap what's going to happen in that industry. And if you can, there are probably better ways to play it. Mr. Hayes, when you decide to buy or sell stock based on fundamental thesis you have developed, do you ever use technical indicators to implement your buy or sell decision? Uh, pro tip. Yeah, I mean, I look at all the standard things, but they don't really play a bearing because if I'm looking at it, it's already down a lot anyway. So, I'm not worried about the last five or $10. Um, so the answer is no. That's more for trading. Uh, let's see here. Wait. All right. Here's a jokester saying he's Donald Trump. All right. That's not a question. That's a attempted joke. Appreciate it. Next time be funny and I will laugh. Uh, all right, Professor Tom. Yeah, portfolio waitings I can only go through with clients. Uh, Nar Bonsel Microchip. I think we've covered this one. I don't like it, but it probably works. MCHP. Yeah, I don't know. With this much deterioration, the stock hasn't really fallen enough in my estimation to justify taking a bet. You know, if this if this was a $20 stock from 100 with this much deterioration in the business, I'd be interested. But the fact that it's down like 30%, I don't like it. And there's no clear signs of turnaround yet, but it'll probably work as a trade. Um, all right. Here's a guy calling for the end of the world last week. I guess that was before the UK deal talking about must be reading a lot of Zero Hedge. Although Zero Hedge has turned more positive lately. Uh, all right. Drew Robinson says, \"Was reading the intelligent investor today and came across this line. quote, \"If he is the right kind of investor, he will take added satisfaction from the thought that his operations are exactly opposite from those of the crowd.\" End quote. Could not think of a more fitting line for the hedge fund tips community in 2025. I agree. Now to the question, thoughts on UPS may have covered this recently. I did cover it last week. I think it's right and I think it's a little bit early. So, um, I just think it's going to take a little time to build a base. they've destroyed a lot of institutional holders. Uh I'm willing to be wrong on that and miss it, but I think just give it a little bit more time. I I think if your time horizon is over five years, you should buy it now. But um I just I really like buying great businesses when they're just so destroyed. I mean, right now it's like, yeah, it's pulled back to where it was pre-COVID. Cash flow's starting to recover. margins are still crushed. Not yet for me, but I like the idea. Uh just not not right yet. So,\n\nNar Bonsel Microchip. I think we've covered this one. I don't like it, but it probably works. ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA MCHP. Yeah, I don't know. With this much deterioration, the stock hasn't really fallen enough in my estimation to justify taking a bet.

But um I just I really like buying great businesses when they're just so destroyed. I mean, right now it's like, yeah, it's pulled back to where it was pre-COVID. Cash flow's starting to recover. margins are still crushed. Not yet for me, but I like the idea. Uh just not not right yet. So,",

Yahoo at 12:30 from the New York Stock Exchange.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nTrump put out that tweet on April 9th. He said, \"Now&#39;s a good time to buy stocks.\" The market&#39;s up 14%. Now you have record forced buyers. And I&#39;ll tell you what, with these inflation numbers, I think too late Powell is going to be a real thing. Inflation is lower than it was in September when they cut 50 basis points emergency cut. They&#39;re 150 basis points too restrictive right now. So I think you&#39;re going to see those odds come back a little bit for June even though they went out to September as of the last few weeks. And I think there&#39;s huge opportunity here. Then you take earnings. We&#39;re double what was expected this quarter in spite of all the uncertainty. Guidance has held strong. So we&#39;re very constructive on this market. Every new trade deal creates more forced buyers that sold $1.1 trillion dollars of equities at the exact low in early April. Did you know that\n\nLook at Stanley Black &amp; Decker yesterday, up 17% after the China deal was announced. Home building is going to come back the second half when uh Bessant works on the long end of the curve with the SLR. Uh that&#39;s going to bring down the 10-year Treasury by 30 to 70 basis points and you&#39;re going to see a boom in housing construction also as Trump opens up federal lands for starter homes.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nSo, it&#39;s uh trade, tariffs, trade negotiations. Where does this go from here in 90 days when the reciprocal tariffs uh on all the other nations expire in July? But then the president also comes out with this uh order on prescription drugs. Yeah. And if we can take a look at the prescription drug stocks coming up in a minute. You&#39;re you&#39;re really invested based on I don&#39;t want to say whims, but certainly the maneuvering of the White House. And if this was so bad, wouldn&#39;t the drug makers be much lower? That&#39;s ab absolutely right. I think what Charles said about a lot of people resisting it is so true. Do you know right at the lows in early April, you had one record selling in the hole by hedge funds and by CTAs. They sold $1.1 trillion of equities at the lows in April. So now what you have as you&#39;ve had this quick move up and then today the good news is you have a whole slew of forced buyers that are not only covering their shorts but are forced to chase up. So that is going to persist for a little bit. And then you couple it with the fact that even in the face of all this uncertainty and all the\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nHouse Republicans just under and we&#39;re back. And then yesterday I had a chance to go on the Big Money Show and do the full hour with Taylor Riggs, Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, Dean McDow on Fox Business. Uh thanks to Stephen for cutting down the 40 minutes to the most important eight minutes. So, I&#39;m David McDow joined by my co-host Taylor Riggs, Brian Brenberg, Jackie D&#39;Angelus, and joining us for this hour, Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. How do you invest in this kind of environment? Because it is a market that is very much driven by what the White House is doing. So, it&#39;s uh trade, tariffs, trade negotiations.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nWhere does this go from here in 90 days when the reciprocal tariffs uh on all the other nations expire in July? But then the president also comes out with this uh order on prescription drugs. Yeah. And if we can take a look at the prescription drug stocks coming up in a minute. You&#39;re you&#39;re really invested based on I don&#39;t want to say whims, but certainly the maneuvering of the White House. And if this was so bad, wouldn&#39;t the drug makers be much lower?

So now what you have as you&#39;ve had this quick move up and then today the good news is you have a whole slew of forced buyers that are not only covering their shorts but are forced to chase up. So that is going to persist for a little bit. And then you couple it with the fact that even in the face of all this uncertainty and all the headlines  that you mentioned, Dan, um earnings came in twice as good as expected, 13.4% earnings growth versus 6% estimated. Uh estimates didn&#39;t even come down that much for 2025. They came down from 270 to 265 about 3.6%. But 2026 held up in the face of this. So now that the floodgates are open that they&#39;ve kind of resolved this, this looks like a reasonable path forward. Uh now now managements can can have some confidence in moving ahead with investment, moving ahead with the different projects that they had on hold. Uh and we&#39;re going to get through this. Hard to paper, which they are. Um then that the market could see some disappointment. I would say one thing about that, Jackie, it&#39;s like Warren Buffett always said, if you wait for for the Robins to sing, it&#39;s already spring. So, you know, we did a we did a conference call with our clients on April 7th when things looked really really dark and we went company by company and we went through their free cash flow. We went through their revenues. We went through their balance sheet and we said, &quot;Look, this is headline headline noise. These are durable businesses that have made it through multiple cycles. So, ignore the short-term\n\nI think we&#39;re going to get some follow through in the next few days. I think everyone&#39;s going to come into the market finally . All the holdouts, all the people short covering, they&#39;re going to chase up and then we&#39;ll get some consolidation probably a few days out, some sideways grind, maybe a few percent pullback just to punish the Johnny come lately and then we push to new highs.\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think last time you joined us, you were pretty bullish and since then, we&#39;ve seen the S&amp;P 500 rise. What do you make of this deal and where it puts us for equities? This is a landmark deal. This is a landmark morning. Uh particularly, here&#39;s the phrase of the day, trapped bears. Okay, we had record selling. $1.1 trillion was sold at the absolute lows in early April by hedge funds and CTAs. Now they&#39;re forced to cover. They&#39;re forced buyers. They&#39;re forced to chase up. You couple that with record amounts of buyback announcements. 665 billion of buybacks announced. These guys are in trouble. Okay, let let&#39;s just put it that way. As they chase up. So, I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through for the next few days. Once everyone gets in the boat 3 4 days from now we probably start to get a little bit of consolidation a little bit of pullback for the Johnny come lately. That&#39;s just the way it always works. Yeah. So what does this tell us? Has it been a change in true direction or is this still a very dynamic trading market? Yeah. I you know it&#39;s interesting. I look at earnings and earnings in the face of all of this uncertainty and all the let&#39;s be candid chaos that was going on for a couple of months. uh came in so much better than expected 13.4% versus 6% estimated with 90 90% recorded. Then you look at the guidance estimates didn&#39;t come down that much. They came down from 270 to 265 3.6% reduction. But 2026 held up at $300, which means we&#39;re only trading at 18.5 times compared to 18.3 times for the last 10year average. So there&#39;s a lot to do. I think you got to really start to look at the things that were hit hardest by tariffs are going to be the greatest recovery opportunities. And already we&#39;re seeing some of these semiconductors, technology names, riskier stocks, ones with a higher beta, certainly ones that sold off dramatically. I think the semiconductor index at one point was down 40% um in that April 2nd announcement. Those seem to be the ones coming back the most. Is that what you see? I think so. The other thing I&#39;m looking at is cyclicals relative to defensives is at a record all-time low positioning. So cyclicals, we start to look at consumer discretionary, we start to look at industrials, we start to look at materials. Uh maybe you even start to, you know, look a little bit over at energy because you you noted this morning that the S&amp;P was up certain percent, the Dow was up a certain percent. You know, was up more than all of them. Russell Small Cap index, largest short interest on record. So if this the game is on is really what it comes down to. And I and I think you&#39;ll see it in the indices for sure, but there are so many stocks that are still down 50%, 60%, 70% that are great businesses that have been around for decades that are going to start to fly. Interesting. Other particular stocks on your radar? Yeah. Uh Disney, we came out publicly like 3 4 weeks ago. It was a no-brainer. We said buy Disney at $85. Of course, the next few days it went down to like $82 because that&#39;s what always happens. But now it&#39;s at 108. It&#39;s going to continue to climb over the next two years, probably over 200 in our view. Uh, every all of their segments are growing at mid- teens, double digits. They just put guidance out for $17 billion of cash from operations this year. So, this is this is a well-run business. 180 million streaming subscribers. They grew 2.5 million. So, there&#39;s a lot of good things happen there. They&#39;ll continue to invest. We we saw the park in Abu Dhabi. They&#39;ll continue to invest in the cruise ships which have a very high return on invested capital like mid20s return on invested capital. So that business is going to continue to grow. And then the second one I have uh no one is going to buy when I when I when I put out this name. They&#39;re all going to like you know say this guy&#39;s crazy. And then a year from now we&#39;re going to be back on and be like do you remember last year? It&#39;s called Albamar. It&#39;s the number one lithium producer positioning for materials. materials is going to have the highest earnings growth, second highest earnings growth in 2026. You&#39;re getting positioned ahead of time. Lithium isn&#39;t a glut. Everyone thinks EVs are done except for the fact the US is 10% of the market. China is 60% of the market. It&#39;s not a natural market. It is a subsidized market. It is policy initiative. They grew EV sales 38% last month. Albamaro&#39;s lowest cost producer. They&#39;ve got these mines in Chile and they&#39;ve got $3.1 billion of liquidity to ride this out. So as all the smaller players go out of business as prices are down that shrinks supply album is left standing and the operating leverage is huge. This one you know we talked about Disney going up whatever it was a double plus from from this thing can go up a lot more than that over the next 3 to 5 years as the the market demand for lithium from 1.2 million metric tonses today to 3.2 two just in five years. And and uh so we&#39;re not looking at a triple because the operating leverage in that business could be a lot more than that. So that&#39;s a good one. It&#39;s a long-term one. It&#39;s whatever $61 today. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll go to 55 tomorrow, but a year from now it&#39;s going to be a lot higher. I can tell you that right now.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nthat&#39;s the Federal Reserve and how it decides to respond to these policy changes as well as some of the economic data that we&#39;ll get this week. What does that mean for the markets? The fact that the latest indication from Jerome Pal is that he is going to take his time. I was pretty certain we were going to have two cuts this year at the back half of the year. Uh moving forward, you know, if this continues in the same vein, I think one cut, we&#39;re probably still going to wind up with two cuts because we&#39;ll get this initial high and then we&#39;re going to say, well, you know what, there was some short-term damage done to small businesses. It&#39;s going to take them a couple quarters to recover. So, I think one to two is still a safe bet this year. I think Besson&#39;s working on the long end of the curve which is more important as it relates to housing as it relates to refinancing the debt.\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nfinally",

We went through their revenues. We went through their balance sheet and we said, &quot;Look, this is headline headline noise. These are durable businesses that have made it through multiple cycles. So, ignore the short-term\nheadlines . Yes, there, you know, it&#39;s creating a lot of volatility. You know what? They survive the most high rates.&quot; Yeah. Well, I think Bessant is on top of that, managing the long end of the curve. They&#39;re going to deregulate the banks. They&#39;re the banks are going to be back in the market and he&#39;s going to be able to take control of the long end of the curve. Uh I remember when the 10-year yield went up to 480 and everyone was saying 5% 5%. I said, &quot;We&#39;re going below four before we go above five.&quot; And I&#39;m holding true to that. And I think the second half, the biggest surprise in the second half of this year is going to be you&#39;re going to see mortgage rates, 30-year fixed rates under 6%. And you&#39;re going to see a boom in housing and construction and suppliers to housing that we haven&#39;t seen in years. And that&#39;s going to be uh fueled by the Taylor Rigs of the world that are having new families, moving out to the suburbs, uh having the buying a house, buying extra cars is there. You bet. Get here and get a good tax cut done with corporate tax cuts. Man, I might be with you in the second half of this year that it could be really impressive. Yeah, there there&#39;s no question. You know, it&#39;s interesting. Trump put out that tr tweet or truth on April 8th and he said now&#39;s a good time to buy stocks and that was the bottom and it absolutely rallied and then last week he did the same thing. He said watch out you know there was a little uncertainty last week before the UK deal. Watch out America is going to boom and that was the intermediate term bottom. So you got to listen to the president. This guy is is on fire. I mean, his calls have have been working uh and uh and it&#39;s substantiated by earnings and now we&#39;re getting certainty and I think we move to growth just like Brian was referencing when we start the tax massive tax cuts and the deregulation with banks with industry with bringing manufacturing make it easy to get zoning and and so on. So, so this is\n\nfrom an investor standpoint, I would use the opportunity. Any dip in high quality airlines is an opportunity to buy. Consumer confidence with these trade deals is going to come back. Travel is going to accelerate into the summer like it does every single year. Uh, and uh, and we&#39;ll be looking for opportunities. Oh, you&#39;re so glass. Half full today. Opportunities in the crisis. He&#39;s very optimistic. Constantly on the phone, which is so disruptive to your sleep cycle. So, that&#39;s what I need to work on. Well, you could just become a golfer because if you pull your phone out while you&#39;re golfing, people will look give you the evil eye. Do not mess up the round. So, I do it in small doses, four hours at a time, but beyond that, I think if I was disconnected for one day or two days, my clients would fire me. So, uh I need to be available, but four hours at a time. Even at the retreat, you get to use the phone in your room. Yeah. So, you wouldn&#39;t disconnect. If you send your clients on the retreat, then they&#39;ll never contact you. The best of all worlds. Dan, this one in theory doesn&#39;t have to report to an office, but it&#39;s because your computer is right here. That&#39;s right. With with opportunity comes responsibility. So, if you can be out and about, you can be on on your life, you know, doing your life, but available. It&#39;s kind of a good blend and flexibility. People have uh more flexible lives. They can pick up their kids at soccer practice, but still be plugged in, answer emails if it&#39;s during work hours. So, we just have to kind of weigh the pros and the cons. And I think just shut it off at certain times, particularly when you&#39;re playing golf or or uh or on the weekend or certainly in bed. Maybe maybe get a white lotus box outside your bedroom door and you drop the phone in before you go. I&#39;m zooming back over a trillion dollars in market value with the stock rallying to its highest level since February. Um I just want to get your take, final thoughts. You were very optimistic, glass half full on this market. Um you think we continue to rally from here? I think we&#39;re going to get some follow through in the next few days. I think everyone&#39;s going to come into the market\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwe expected resolution. We didn't expect it this quickly. Uh it's it's unreal. And right now it's exacerbated by the fact that the phrase of the day is called trapped bears. Okay, we had record selling by hedge funds and CTAs at the absolute low in early April. So now the market's come so far so fast even before today and they were praying for a retest of the lows that never came. So now they've got to buy up. They're forced buyers. They're forced covering. So this could probably get some continuation, some followthrough for the next few days because so many people are structurally off sides. So what are you expecting now? Cuz yes, you you made the point about trap bears before we had any deal on the table between the US and China. And all we had on the table was the framework of a deal between the US and and UK. So you call them the trap bears. How do you see this forced buyer dynamic playing out? Well, they got to catch up. And and what's interesting is who's been buying from these trap bears. We have a record amount of announced buybacks from companies. $665 billion. So, they're buying, these poor guys are trying to cover their shorts, trying to catch up, trying to chase up uh uh the rally. So, my guess is this is going to continue for a few days. They're going to force them in after a huge move off the bottom even before today. And then we'll probably get a little bit of volatility as people digest like oh we've got 90 days etc etc. So expect a little shortterm material followthrough but it's very interesting on uh April 7th or April 8th Trump went out on truth or Twitter or whatever social media platform and he said now's the time to buy stocks and no one believed him and the next day the market went up. Last week he did the exact same thing when people were getting pessimistic before the UK deal and he said America is going to boom and he also referenced stocks. So if they say you know everyone was looking for the Fed put and the Treasury put the Trump put is real. He's paying attention. He listens to people and why we were optimistic and why we were positioned for this not to happen so soon but positioned for this to happen uh eventually is because he's shown and the administration has shown flexibility and and rationality throughout this process. He genuinely does want to negotiate better deals. And if you remember the first term, the people with assets like me that manage money, we did okay. It was a good four years. that everyday people that work every day, the middle class, the lower middle class, they did better than ever during those four years. And that's what President Trump wants to see. And it's deals like this and initiatives like this that is that is going to create that. You won't see it in a week, but over the next few months and couple years, you're going to start to see that middle class. We've we have seen more flexibility come up than come to pass than we initially saw at the beginning of April. Um, but I do wonder if some of that is because of the leadership shift shift that we saw with essentially the Treasury Secretary with uh Besset leading versus Navaro. They did put Navaro in the closet for a few weeks which was, you know, a welcome reprieve uh by yours included. However, I will say I, you know, Lutnik did get the job done with the UK and that kind of paved the way for positive talks with Bessant over the weekend. So, I got to give credit where credit's due. And, uh, President Trump has made no bones about he wants to be recognized as one of the greatest presidents in history. If stuff like this continues to happen and him cleaning up methods, messes that have been going on for decades. I'm not blaming anyone administration. Republican administrations, Democratic administrations neglected to do this. If he cleans this up, he's got a shot at his goal for sure. Okay. And let's talk about you mentioned the buybacks at record levels. Uh so how important is that in terms of driving momentum? Well, there's no question you've got CTAs and hedge funds covering now chasing up now $665 billion of buyback announcements. Oh, and by the way, earnings in the face of all of this uncertainty and craziness, earnings were came in much better than expected. 13.4% earnings growth versus 6% estimates. And the forward guidance hasn't come down that much for 2020. Some of them have and then some haven't even given guidance. Yeah. Yeah. Fair. But listen, let's look at S&P earnings for 2025 came down to, you know, basically from 270 to 265 about 3.5% since the beginning of the year. That's pretty material. However, 2026 backend loaded still $300 a share of earnings, which implies we're trading at about 18 1.5 times compared to the 10-year average of 183. Okay, there's still things to do. And then so speaking of things to do, I know you have some picks. Um, you like Disney. Tell us about your thesis there and if you still like it. Yeah, it, you know, it's interesting. We were pounding the table publicly for Disney. It got down to like 85 and then after we went out buy it at 85. I think it went to like 83 or 81, of course. Uh, and now it's at 108. We think over the next two years, this is a $200 stock. They're hitting on all cylinders, whether it's the parks, whether it's the cruise experience, whether it's the consumer products. And they just guided they said we're going to do $17 billion of cash from operations this year. That ship and by the way 180 million subscribers they're second to Netflix. They added 2 and a2 million. They're going to do this ESPN. Their sports business is through the roof. So we continue to like it despite the fact it's moved up so much in the last few weeks. And the Abu Dhabi um Yeah, that doesn't hurt either. Yeah. And what else is on your list? Uh oh, here's one that no one's going to want to buy. Albam Marl. Okay. This is Okay. Tell me about this one. Yeah, you know me. I'm early and people like there are sometimes some kicks on your list. I'm like, huh? And then a year later we sit down, you're like, \"Oh, that was pretty good.\" All right. So, Albamaro, number one lithium producer. Also lowest cost lithium producer. Lithium prices are in the garbage. Why? Because everyone says EVs are out of favor. Blah blah blah. China is 60% of the EV business. It's not a natural market. It's a government subsidized market. They have an initiative. They're going to continue to grow. They grew EV sales 38% last month in China. So what's going to happen? As one of the biggest producers, you just wait it out. Lithium prices are very cyclical. Every few years they go up and down. We're at the trough right now. They've got $3.1 billion of liquidity to sit it out. All the small players will go out of business. That shrinks supply. Demand continues to go up. And energy storage is a big thing. Overall demand from 1.2 million metric tonses right now to 3.2 in the next 5 years. Albam Marorrow, you know, we talk about Disney going going up to 200. Albam Marorrow could be a triple over the next three to five years. Really? Okay. Because we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of um I don't know if they're going to pull it back up again, but we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of lithium. The chart looks like that. I'm going to I'm going to tell you something right now. It's at $61. It's going to go let's say it's going to go right after I get off the air. It'll probably go to $55. Everyone will say that guy's an idiot. two a year and a half from now, you're going to have me on, Diane. And the thing's going to be over 100, probably closer to 150.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nOkay. All right. You heard it here first. That's Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Our thanks to Tom. And we're back. Quote of the week. The biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist. That's Ray Dallio. Uh that's called recency bias.

TW 2025 earnings growth estimates emerging markets 10.4% versus the US at 7.1% much lower multiple much higher growth. Where do you want to be? NASDAQ 100 re-enters bull market. So now it&#39;s up 20% after shortest bare market in history I guess. uh broadening other than COVID broadening breath equal weighted S&P 500 beats main index for six straight sessions that means under the surface is what&#39;s making money and the the clients can see it in their P&amp;Ls I mean it&#39;s unbelie February was like oh my gosh it&#39;s like through the roof and and now it&#39;s we it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s better than where we beyond overtook our high water mark uh and it&#39;s uh from the first quarter which is just awesome. I mean and the market&#39;s not even recovered yet which is even more awesome. So super exciting times. Broadening breath uh equal weighted got that next realized and consensus EPS growth for select US indices. Uh so you see Russell 2000 has the biggest growth rate small caps record short interest and biggest earnings growth for this year and next year relative to midcap relative to NASDAQ relative to equal weight relative to S&amp;P highest earnings growth lowest multiple get your small caps ladies and gentlemen because those shorts I talked about MoAS mother of all short squeezes This morning on Vanney with regard to the market, forced sellers became forced buyers. It&#39;s going to be nothing compared to what you&#39;re going to see in small caps. There&#39;s going to be some face ripping rallies in small caps. Mark my words. You can count on that. Can stocks get back to positive in 2025? Um, there&#39;s no question about it. There&#39;s no question about it. uh US inflation rate is lower than it was in September when they did an emergency 50 basis point cut. Fed&#39;s too restrictive. They&#39;re going to wake up. They no longer have the tariff excuse because the tariffs have come down. They&#39;ve got to get it get in action and remove the restriction and let people buy homes and cars and get on with their lives versus screw a bunch of millennials who want to buy houses because you want a plaque that says I&#39;m not Arthur Burns. The gap between US hard and soft data growth is among the largest in the since the 1970s. We&#39;ve covered this. People are super pessimistic, but they&#39;re still shopping like there&#39;s no tomorrow. That&#39;s continues. Fund manager equity allocation lowest since May 2023. All these people have to chase up now. They all have career risk. They missed it. They sold in the hole 1.1 trillion. Now they got to buy up and they&#39;re going to be forced in at new highs. It&#39;s it the story just continues to repeat. Long gold is the most crowded trade in the fund manager survey. Um that thing is that&#39;s going to be over sooner sooner rather than later. I know no one believes me. Uh but you know, hang tight. Uh earnings sentiment has now come back up in the S&P 500 like a hockey stick. So that&#39;s good to see. MAG7 has lagged the rest of the market year to date. That continues to be the case. S&P 493 are up 1%. S&P was down 3%. This was a couple of days ago. And the MAG 7 down 12%. That was a theme coming into 2024 five. Go back at the tapes was uh MAG7 will dramatically underperform. International will dramatically outperform. Both of those have held true. Goldman&#39;s positioning indicator deeply negative territory suggests there&#39;s room for stocks to rally. We agree. Uh what is this? Oh, this just shows S&P stocks above the 20-day, 50-day, and 200 day moving average. So, the 200 has got plenty of room to run here. The S&P just overtook the 200 day moving average. Take it for what it&#39;s worth. VIX below 20 is another another clue. The worst is over. 12 months out. Median return 10.3%. Advanced decline line continues to climb uh hits record high for the first time in a 100 days. One year later, average market&#39;s up 14.21%. Total US dollar futures positioning uh is getting shorter. So probably we have this counter trend rally go a bit lower first before getting a bigger bounce. We&#39;ll see what happens. uh we&#39;ll pay attention to the commitment of traders reports as stocks continue to claw back potential all-time highs. Remember that only twice in the past 75 years did stocks peak in February. Uh stocks tend to peak in December or January according to this Carson data. Chart of the day better than expected 1Q earnings. They were expected to be 6%. They came in at 13.4. S&P has surged since Trump said great time to buy. It surged by 14% since that tweet and by pure well it wasn&#39;t luck because I I&#39;ve just done this so many times I could tell we were at a peak crescendo of of fear and that&#39;s why I chose that day to do it and then sure enough that was the inflection uh which very similar to the COVID lows when I got quoted in that article uh and market watch saying we are buying during the 1918 Spanish flu the Dow was down 35 5% we&#39;re down 33%. Uh we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, but with all these great companies marked down, we&#39;re buying high quality businesses. Two days later, the market bottomed and never looked back. Uh S&P 500 rebound is one of the biggest under Trump era CTA positioning. Again, this is what we&#39;ve been talking about. They are forced buyers for the foreseeable future. Uh there&#39;ll be a few fits and starts.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nClimate related spending 12 month moving average by type. So you can see government spending is going down.

They&#39;ll continue to invest. We we saw the park in Abu Dhabi. They&#39;ll continue to invest in the cruise ships which have a very high return on invested capital like mid20s return on invested capital. So that business is going to continue to grow. And then the second one I have uh no one is going to buy when I when I when I put out this name. They&#39;re all going to like you know say this guy&#39;s crazy. And then a year from now we&#39;re going to be back on and be like do you remember last year? It&#39;s called Albamar. It&#39;s the number one lithium producer positioning for materials. materials is going to have the highest earnings growth, second highest earnings growth in 2026. You&#39;re getting positioned ahead of time. Lithium isn&#39;t a glut. Everyone thinks EVs are done except for the fact the US is 10% of the market. China is 60% of the market. It&#39;s not a natural market. It is a subsidized market. It is policy initiative. They grew EV sales 38% last month. Albamaro&#39;s lowest cost producer. They&#39;ve got these mines in Chile and they&#39;ve got $3.1 billion of liquidity to ride this out. So as all the smaller players go out of business as prices are down that shrinks supply album is left standing and the operating leverage is huge. This one you know we talked about Disney going up whatever it was a double plus from from this thing can go up a lot more than that over the next 3 to 5 years as the the market demand for lithium from 1.2 million metric tonses today to 3.2 two just in five years. And and uh so we&#39;re not looking at a triple because the operating leverage in that business could be a lot more than that. So that&#39;s a good one. It&#39;s a long-term one. It&#39;s whatever $61 today. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll go to 55 tomorrow, but a year from now it&#39;s going to be a lot higher. I can tell you that right now. And now where is  the demand coming from, Thomas? You see it around the world or specifically in China? Predominantly China. Also, it it is going to be around the world because it is a cyclical thing, but also energy storage is a big component to this. It&#39;s not just EVs and as you need more and more of these devices and you need uh the demand is unlimited for this and and the tariffs really hit it. The glut in the cycle really hit it. But you know what? If you look at the long-term chart, this happens every 3 to 5 years for Albamaro. It happens every 3 to 5 years for lithium. They have a few other businesses that&#39;ll support them through this. But they&#39;ll be the last man standing and they&#39;ll reap all the benefits as we recover. You know, it&#39;s interesting. Um it&#39;s obvious right based on the market observations that we can see that the president is able to move the markets with his commentary and changes in policy. T\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat&#39;s where is  the demand coming from, Thomas? You see it around the world or specifically in China? Predominantly China.

I was thinking about that on the way down here. Uh I was pretty certain we were going to have two cuts this year at the back half of the year. Uh moving forward, you know, if this continues in the same vein, I think one cut, we&#39;re probably still going to wind up with two cuts because we&#39;ll get this initial high and then we&#39;re going to say, well, you know what, there was some short-term damage done to small businesses. It&#39;s going to take them a couple quarters to recover. So, I think one to two is still a safe bet this year. I think Besson&#39;s working on the long end of the curve which is more important as it relates to housing as it relates to refinancing the debt.

Winkington and CMA review process is now in its final stages with an outcome expected in a few weeks. An integration set to begin before the Q2 earnings call. Management expects either full clearance, which would be $10 in the stock, maybe 20 of the deal, or a request to divest the grocery business, which makes up only about 6% of the original Winkington business and has much lower margins than the overall business. Management continues to expect 58 million in cost synergies once integrated, providing a margin tailwind as 2025 progresses. after announcing a 500 million share repurchase pro 5 billion share repurchase program earlier in the year. Management purchased no 500 million put billion uh purchased 2.8 million shares for around 110 million. This reduced the share count by approximately 2.4% in this quarter alone. If Sustained GXO is on track to repurchase about 10% of the overall float this year, which means you own you get a 10% larger slice of the pie without putting out one new penny. GXO signed a landmark 10-year deal with England&#39;s National Health Service supply chain, the largest contract on record with a lifetime value of around 2.5 billion. Operations are expected to begin in early TW uh Q3. Uh management doesn&#39;t anticipate significant startup costs and expects the deal to be major catalyst for expansion to healthcare with a strong new pipeline of healthcare related customers expected to be announced in Q2. Surprise, surprise. Why do you think all these directors are coming on board? Management reaffirmed the 2025 outlook expecting organic revenue growth of 3 to 6% IBIDA 840 to 860 million normal operating environment. These results would have had led to an increase in the fullear outlook. To put this in context, management is projecting an 8% gross organic wins for the year. And in Q1 alone, they booked 228 million, delivering about 7% organic growth. This essentially implies no incremental wins contributing to revenue for the rest of the year, despite an all-time high sales pipeline at 2.5 billion and the landmark NHS deal. Welcome to Sandbagger City. Six. Management has seen no material impact on the sales pipeline or customer demand due to tariffs and has no exposure to China. In fact, the added complexity of tariffs has provided a tailwind for outsourcing wins highlighting uh highlighted by a 41% increase in wins during Q1. Seven, operating return on invested capital was 45% well ahead of the long-term target of 30%. Free cash flow is an outflow of 48 million in line with normal seasonality and impacted by the delayed Wington synergies. Management continues to expect 25 to 30% 5% 25 to 35% of adjusted Ebida to free cash flow conversion for the full year. So call it 250 of free cash flow. AI and automation are now live at 20 different operations delivering record setting productivity improvements in stock replenishment, order allocation and item inspection management is beginning to see the first cost savings as results and expects to see savings continue ramping through 2025. North America was the strongest region in Q1 driven by strength in aerospace i.e. Boeing and industrial customers. Continental Europe continues to per perform well with slight weakness in volumes in the UK during Q1 expected to rebound through Q2. Overall, business is seeing similar trends heading into Q2. Weaker dollar and strengthening euro and pound are expected to be a strong tailwind for GXO in 2026 with an improvement over prior FX guidance if current rates hold through 2025. They&#39;re going to get better. So that&#39;s that. You can go through the call. We&#39;ve highlighted the important parts. And\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nfinally , Baxter update prices followed cash flow. There&#39;s no accident about that. But look what&#39;s happening to revenues. They&#39;re starting to recover. Return on capital is going up. Margins are going to improve from the cost cuts. Uh delever the balance sheet and moving forward to bigger and better things. You got to have a healthcare play. This is ours. This is going to be a good stock. You can go through the uh call and you can go through the analyst reports here. Fair value and this is in the midst of pessimism. Fair value 60% higher. Uh general almost it&#39;s actually more than 60% 55 it&#39;s almost 100%.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nfear and greed starting to tick up. National Association of Active Investment Managers starting to play catch-up after the fact. Uh Russell 2000 earnings uh up 1.53% in the last 60 days. Top 30 weights down 45 basis points for next year. S&amp;P earnings on the other hand are down 93 basis points for this year, 122 basis points for next year, normal during this time of year. And then the CPI inflation number came in lower than expected, lowest in four years. And uh and now the Fed has no excuses with the tariffs. So uh\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nutility? Okay, so this is a utility. So, they're all thinking it's going to be the the uh AI derivative play. Just play it through coms. just play it through natural gas. It's a better derivative play at a lower price. Um, let me just take a look here. You missed this. Just it could go higher, but you missed it. I mean, bottom line is the time to be looking at this was when it was at $10 and $15 and and they couldn't give it away. At 200 after a 10 bagger, you get the crumbs. if it goes to 250 to take that level of risk. Uh let's take a look here. Okay, so they're still growing and they're buying back shares. Okay, so that's that's not a bad thing, but they they bought back 30% of the float and the stock's up 10x. Um, generally a low return on invested capital business, free cash flow. Let's see what that's doing. It's down off last year. I just I've I've just seen this movie before. I understand like if you're just looking black and white at the data, if you're if you have 30 years of experiencing seeing these promotes come and go, you kind of just like, yeah, I've seen this movie before. It's not going to end well. Does it go to 300 before it goes to 50? Maybe. But that's that's a trading gambling game. That's not really a game I want to play. Let's take a look at uh let's take a look at the liabilities long-term debt is 15 billion up from five in 2016. Cash is so they got a billion dollars of cash and 15 billion dollars of debt and they're buying back stock like there's no tomorrow. Why don't you pay down a little bit of debt? Yeah, I I don't like that. I think this is a complete promote and they're buying back stock to get themselves out and and take a look at all the options they have. They're probably I I I'll bet there's a lot of exercising of options going on into that buyback. So, I'm I'm a pass unh same same thing. Uh good questions",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nthat&#39;s where is  the demand coming from, Thomas? You see it around the world or specifically in China? Predominantly China. Also, it it is going to be around the world because it is a cyclical thing, but also energy storage is a big component to this. It&#39;s not just EVs and as you need more and more of these devices and you need uh the demand is unlimited for this and and the tariffs really hit it. The glut in the cycle really hit it. But you know what? If you look at the long-term chart, this happens every 3 to 5 years for Albamaro. It happens every 3 to 5 years for lithium. They have a few other businesses that&#39;ll support them through this. But they&#39;ll be the last man standing and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll reap all the benefits as we recover.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nYeah, I you know it&#39;s interesting. I was thinking about that on the way down here. Uh I was pretty certain we were going to have two cuts this year at the back half of the year. Uh moving forward, you know, if this continues in the same vein, I think one cut, we&#39;re probably still going to wind up with two cuts because we&#39;ll get this initial high and then we&#39;re going to say, well, you know what, there was some short-term damage done to small businesses. It&#39;s going to take them a couple quarters to recover. So, I think one to two is still a safe bet this year. I think Besson&#39;s working on the long end of the curve which is more important as it relates to housing as it relates to refinancing the debt. Uh so all in all very sanglin here and uh pleased to see this. It did come a bit sooner than we expected.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwe expected resolution. We didn't expect it this quickly. Uh it's it's unreal. And right now it's exacerbated by the fact that the phrase of the day is called trapped bears. Okay, we had record selling by hedge funds and CTAs at the absolute low in early April. So now the market's come so far so fast even before today and they were praying for a retest of the lows that never came. So now they've got to buy up. They're forced buyers. They're forced covering. So this could probably get some continuation, some followthrough for the next few days because so many people are structurally off sides. So what are you expecting now? Cuz yes, you you made the point about trap bears before we had any deal on the table between the US and China. And all we had on the table was the framework of a deal between the US and and UK. So you call them the trap bears. How do you see this forced buyer dynamic playing out? Well, they got to catch up. And and what's interesting is who's been buying from these trap bears. We have a record amount of announced buybacks from companies. $665 billion. So, they're buying, these poor guys are trying to cover their shorts, trying to catch up, trying to chase up uh uh the rally. So, my guess is this is going to continue for a few days. They're going to force them in after a huge move off the bottom even before today. And then we'll probably get a little bit of volatility as people digest like oh we've got 90 days etc etc. So expect a little shortterm material followthrough but it's very interesting on uh April 7th or April 8th Trump went out on truth or Twitter or whatever social media platform and he said now's the time to buy stocks and no one believed him and the next day the market went up. Last week he did the exact same thing when people were getting pessimistic before the UK deal and he said America is going to boom and he also referenced stocks. So if they say you know everyone was looking for the Fed put and the Treasury put the Trump put is real. He's paying attention. He listens to people and why we were optimistic and why we were positioned for this not to happen so soon but positioned for this to happen uh eventually is because he's shown and the administration has shown flexibility and and rationality throughout this process. He genuinely does want to negotiate better deals. And if you remember the first term, the people with assets like me that manage money, we did okay. It was a good four years. that everyday people that work every day, the middle class, the lower middle class, they did better than ever during those four years. And that's what President Trump wants to see. And it's deals like this and initiatives like this that is that is going to create that. You won't see it in a week, but over the next few months and couple years, you're going to start to see that middle class. We've we have seen more flexibility come up than come to pass than we initially saw at the beginning of April. Um, but I do wonder if some of that is because of the leadership shift shift that we saw with essentially the Treasury Secretary with uh Besset leading versus Navaro. They did put Navaro in the closet for a few weeks which was, you know, a welcome reprieve uh by yours included. However, I will say I, you know, Lutnik did get the job done with the UK and that kind of paved the way for positive talks with Bessant over the weekend. So, I got to give credit where credit's due. And, uh, President Trump has made no bones about he wants to be recognized as one of the greatest presidents in history. If stuff like this continues to happen and him cleaning up methods, messes that have been going on for decades. I'm not blaming anyone administration. Republican administrations, Democratic administrations neglected to do this. If he cleans this up, he's got a shot at his goal for sure. Okay. And let's talk about you mentioned the buybacks at record levels. Uh so how important is that in terms of driving momentum? Well, there's no question you've got CTAs and hedge funds covering now chasing up now $665 billion of buyback announcements. Oh, and by the way, earnings in the face of all of this uncertainty and craziness, earnings were came in much better than expected. 13.4% earnings growth versus 6% estimates. And the forward guidance hasn't come down that much for 2020. Some of them have and then some haven't even given guidance. Yeah. Yeah. Fair. But listen, let's look at S&P earnings for 2025 came down to, you know, basically from 270 to 265 about 3.5% since the beginning of the year. That's pretty material. However, 2026 backend loaded still $300 a share of earnings, which implies we're trading at about 18 1.5 times compared to the 10-year average of 183. Okay, there's still things to do. And then so speaking of things to do, I know you have some picks. Um, you like Disney. Tell us about your thesis there and if you still like it. Yeah, it, you know, it's interesting. We were pounding the table publicly for Disney. It got down to like 85 and then after we went out buy it at 85. I think it went to like 83 or 81, of course. Uh, and now it's at 108. We think over the next two years, this is a $200 stock. They're hitting on all cylinders, whether it's the parks, whether it's the cruise experience, whether it's the consumer products. And they just guided they said we're going to do $17 billion of cash from operations this year. That ship and by the way 180 million subscribers they're second to Netflix. They added 2 and a2 million. They're going to do this ESPN. Their sports business is through the roof. So we continue to like it despite the fact it's moved up so much in the last few weeks. And the Abu Dhabi um Yeah, that doesn't hurt either. Yeah. And what else is on your list? Uh oh, here's one that no one's going to want to buy. Albam Marl. Okay. This is Okay. Tell me about this one. Yeah, you know me. I'm early and people like there are sometimes some kicks on your list. I'm like, huh? And then a year later we sit down, you're like, \"Oh, that was pretty good.\" All right. So, Albamaro, number one lithium producer. Also lowest cost lithium producer. Lithium prices are in the garbage. Why? Because everyone says EVs are out of favor. Blah blah blah. China is 60% of the EV business. It's not a natural market. It's a government subsidized market. They have an initiative. They're going to continue to grow. They grew EV sales 38% last month in China. So what's going to happen? As one of the biggest producers, you just wait it out. Lithium prices are very cyclical. Every few years they go up and down. We're at the trough right now. They've got $3.1 billion of liquidity to sit it out. All the small players will go out of business. That shrinks supply. Demand continues to go up. And energy storage is a big thing. Overall demand from 1.2 million metric tonses right now to 3.2 in the next 5 years. Albam Marorrow, you know, we talk about Disney going going up to 200. Albam Marorrow could be a triple over the next three to five years. Really? Okay. Because we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of um I don't know if they're going to pull it back up again, but we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of lithium. The chart looks like that. I'm going to I'm going to tell you something right now. It's at $61. It's going to go let's say it's going to go right after I get off the air. It'll probably go to $55. Everyone will say that guy's an idiot. two a year and a half from now, you're going to have me on, Diane. And the thing's going to be over 100, probably closer to 150.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nOkay. All right. You heard it here first. That's Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Our thanks to Tom. And we're back. Quote of the week. The biggest mistake investors make is to believe that what happened in the recent past is likely to persist. That's Ray Dallio. Uh that's called recency bias. We cover it very frequently on the show.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAnd when we did that special call for clients on April 7th or 8th, whatever it was the day before Trump tweeted, \"Now's a great time to buy stocks.\" Um we went through that and we said, \"Listen, look at the revenues. Look at the free cash flow. Look at the balance sheet.\" And we went company by company by company and and we said if there was ever a time if you you know we've never asked number one we've never asked anyone to invest. Okay people come to us that listen to the podcast or come from referrals of people etc. Number two we've never asked existing clients to put in more money. They put in more money as they get more money as we deliver results. That's the way it works. Uh but we didn't do it twice. We did it in October 2022 and the people that took advantage of that uh just we crushed it. Okay. because they were throwing a uh uh Amazon out. They were throwing everything was getting thrown out with the bathwater. Amazon and Google were quick doubles in a year. And then um and then the last time we did it was just four weeks ago. And I was on April 11th on uh Vanney talking Disney at 85 and Boeing. Uh Boeing had already moved up. You know, we were pounding the table before that, but it was like 154. Both of them are up 30% in the last three weeks since then. It's it's unbelievable. Um so uh Bo Warren Buffett the most important quality of an investor is temperament not intellect and that's where we make our money is taking advantage of dislocation whether market which was the case four weeks ago sector which is what we do on a regular basis or individual company temp highquality companies when they're temporarily impaired. uh and um and rinse and repeat over and over again. GXO now getting to our data charts. GXO welcomes There we go. five new members to its board of directors. Brad Jacobs put this out on LinkedIn today and I noted the most important part. These leaders bring deep expertise in operational excellence and strategic growth across all aspects of the supply chain. They will add immediate value as GXO quote accelerates its path to becoming the world's leading logistics provider. Ladies and gentlemen, Numero Uno, the big kahuna. That is in a public release that they're stating their intention. And I commented in Brad's post. I said, \"You don't attract this quality of directors if the turnaround plan is not clear.\" these pe these type of people are not going to put their reputations on the line for a sinking ship. Uh Todd Cooper, you can go through all of these uh whether it's uh uh chief product supply officer from Proctor and Gamble, whether it's the chief supply chain officer at Honeywell International, whether it's the um uh chief financial officer from XBO Logistics, I mean on and on and on. And then we've got our\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n a 20-day high that goes through 50% uh it tends to be a sign of immense strength and the the rally tends to follow through pretty dramatically even if you get a short-term check back before you power higher. And he goes all the way back and he shows all these instances recently in 2023 2022. Then he goes back to 2020 uh and shows what happened when that type of stuff happens coming out of COVID. Then he shows it in 2018 coming out of uh of the first Powell mishap. Uh then he shows it in 2015 and these are all follow-through rallies. Then he goes back to 2008 to 2013 how it worked every pretty much every single time. Then he shows 1972 to 1983. So this is an interesting indicator. Even if the markets moved a lot, when these extremes happen, it means there&#39;s strength behind it. And even if you get short-term checkbacks, it tends to precede big rallies.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nUS is 64% of global equity market versus 61% average of the 2020s. It hasn&#39;t been this high. You got to go all the way back to June of 2003 when it peaked at 55% of global equities. And that&#39;s one of the indicators pointing to the theme that we&#39;ve been talking about when it was unpopular that international would outperform US and it&#39;s dramatically outperformed this year and that trend will continue I think for the foreseeable future next handful of years. That doesn&#39;t mean the US is going to do poorly. What it means is that international pockets of international will outperform uh even if the US does okay which we believe it certainly will and then you&#39;ve got China PBOC cutting rates by the way global M2 money supply is booming uh which means liquidity is coming into the market and largely it&#39;s coming from China. China was a source of illquidity for three years, draining liquidity. Now they are a source of expanding liquidity from all their stimulative practices uh and um and easing. So this is going to be a positive thing not only for China for but for the rest of the world. They&#39;re finally\n\npicking up the baton that the western world uh ran with during COVID and afterward. Now they are uh picking up the charge uh moving forward. So here&#39;s the asset quilt of total returns. You can see EHA is dramatically outperforming. EA is positive. S&P was negative. It might be might be positive or flat on the year after today. Emerging markets is outperforming all the things that we said. If you go back to the fourth quarter, I said the last shall be first, international, etc. and S&P is towards the lowest, international is towards the highest. And uh and there you go. Dollar faces a secular decline. So you&#39;ll get these counter trend moves, but we know the trend is down in the intermediate term. One month since the bottom, had a bounce in tech, industrials, consumer discretionary, financials, real estate, uh etc. have done very well. biggest four-week outflow from US stocks since May of 2023. Biggest tech outflow in 11 weeks. So that&#39;s in the last week or so. Consumers momentum remains. So this is the difference between hard and soft data. They say they&#39;re miserable, but they keep spending money. Then we look at uh AutoSAR for April was 17.3 million, ladies and gentlemen. So obviously a little bit pull forward with the tariffs, but now we got to replenish the the detocking cycle and uh there going to be incentives for car owners and you&#39;ve got a 13.5 year average car on the road. Uh lot of things going on here. So if this 17 plus can can continue, we&#39;re going to continue to see extraordinary things from Cooper Standard. Okay, I wouldn&#39;t expect this to be a straight line, but look at where the trend is going. Just like every single recovery, which was our thesis from day one when we put on that first huge position at $5 and change in May of 2022 and went on the claim and countdown on June 6th and pitched the stock and here we are 5x so far and just getting started. We think this is going to be a multibagger even from these levels. International versus US stocks rolling fourmonth performance spread. So internationals outperforming US by 16.2%. Ladies and gentlemen, the last time you saw that spike was the early 2000s and that trend continued for 5 years. It was one of the biggest periods of international outperformance over US. And uh and that&#39;s that uh number of consecutive weeks with AI bears above 50% was 11 weeks. You haven&#39;t seen that since the early 90s. You had an 8-year bull market after that and since the great financial crisis and you had a multi-year bull market after that. AI asset allocation lowest equity exposures since October 2023. Now is a time to be a buyer, not a seller. Global monetary stimulus is going through the roof. This is the threemon sum net number of rate cuts globally going up. What follows that? Global manufacturing PMIs. They&#39;re down here on the mat. They are going to spike up. firms plan to pass tariff related costs to consumers. Okay. Well, now the tariffs are a lot less than advertised. So, uh it&#39;s going to be less of a story. US companies buying back stock at a record pace. Most announced buybacks in more than a decade, 665 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Watch what people do, not what they say. Best one-mon return since 2020 uh off the COVID lows. That was a that was the best year. Unbelievable year. Uh rallies of this magnitude often have legs. Um one month rolling returns of these levels greater than 14% is often carried on with a forward 12-month return of 25% on average and positive 95% of the time since 1978. 56 instances. Average return after a month like that is six month return is like 14% 12-month return is 25%. Uh how you doing? Uh it&#39;s gonna be a fun time. So as Vney called me the resident bull uh I&#39;ll be willing to carry that title for some time to come. Uh average US gasoline price ahead of peak demand season. Uh EPS revision tracking near historical pattern a little bit better than historical pattern. uh announced buybacks versus actual. So, there&#39;s a lot of catch-up here. There&#39;s a further bid in the market. PBOC stimulus, we continue to cover active listings relative to the start of the year from realtor.com. They&#39;re picking up. Supplies coming on. That&#39;s good to see. Germany expected to inject up to $1 trillion into the military and infrastructure. Okay, that&#39;s a lot of pressure from Trump. That&#39;s good. University of Michigan consumer confidence at points like this when it&#39;s so flushed out they tend to perceive very good things in the equity markets companies are maintaining guidance more than usual and that&#39;s one point that I&#39;ve made despite all the uncertainty fact that this year only came down 3.6% 6% and next year has held up. Now that you see a lot of the tariffs coming down to 10% from these astronomical levels, I think we&#39;re going to just see uh guidance start to go back up and people are going to get excited. Retail investors at lower levels than 2019. Net inflows to US versus Europe. Systematic positioning in US equities. This is what we&#39;ve been talking about with regard to the CTAs and hedge funds. they haven&#39;t sold this much in the hole, been this short since the COVID lows and they missed, you know, what was like a 90% rally thereafter. Uh, and I think the same thing is happening right now. What what was forced sellers is now going to be forced buyers every positive headline. So, these type of opportunities don&#39;t come around that often, ladies and gentlemen. Institutional position in S&P 500. uh asset manager positioning well below the market&#39;s taken off without them. They are going to have to chase up just like every single time. Some potentially good news. S&P drops 10% in two days. When did he publish that? Anyway, 12 months later, the S&P is up 32.6%. So, we saw that in April. [Music] Uh here&#39;s the reciprocal tariffs, China&#39;s retaliatory tariffs, and now back down. So it went up to 14525, now it&#39;s down to 3010, which is a good place for it. ETF float. By the way, the big story, and my friend Jerry actually emailed me about this, who I met in Hawaii. He said uh the biggest thing and and this is a guy who ran one of the greatest banks of all time uh US bank and he said the biggest thing is the opening of China to US businesses. It&#39;s not the tariff rate and if they get these non-tariff barriers removed it is going to be boom time. Uh you know I&#39;ve said in past podcasts $1.1 trillion dollar of S&P revenues comes from China from the S&P 500. So if they open up more to US businesses, this is going to be a boom for China, a boom for the US like we&#39;ve never seen before. Our ETF flow tracker suggests national team has been buying to support the market in China. So uh you can see cumulative flows to the top five NT holding ashare ETFs. Uh net buyers. So the Chinese government is propping up the market until it takes on a life of its own. So they&#39;re they&#39;re in the game. They&#39;re\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nSystematic positioning in US equities.

Uh so you see Russell 2000 has the biggest growth rate small caps record short interest and biggest earnings growth for this year and next year relative to midcap relative to NASDAQ relative to equal weight relative to S&amp;P highest earnings growth lowest multiple get your small caps ladies and gentlemen because those shorts I talked about MoAS mother of all short squeezes This morning on Vanney with regard to the market, forced sellers became forced buyers. It&#39;s going to be nothing compared to what you&#39;re going to see in small caps. There&#39;s going to be some face ripping rallies in small caps. Mark my words. You can count on that. Can stocks get back to positive in 2025? Um, there&#39;s no question about it. There&#39;s no question about it. uh US inflation rate is lower than it was in September when they did an emergency 50 basis point cut. Fed&#39;s too restrictive. They&#39;re going to wake up. They no longer have the tariff excuse because the tariffs have come down. They&#39;ve got to get it get in action and remove the restriction and let people buy homes and cars and get on with their lives versus screw a bunch of millennials who want to buy houses because you want a plaque that says I&#39;m not Arthur Burns. The gap between US hard and soft data growth is among the largest in the since the 1970s. We&#39;ve covered this. People are super pessimistic, but they&#39;re still shopping like there&#39;s no tomorrow. That&#39;s continues. Fund manager equity allocation lowest since May 2023. All these people have to chase up now. They all have career risk. They missed it. They sold in the hole 1.1 trillion. Now they got to buy up and they&#39;re going to be forced in at new highs. It&#39;s it the story just continues to repeat. Long gold is the most crowded trade in the fund manager survey. Um that thing is that&#39;s going to be over sooner sooner rather than later. I know no one believes me. Uh but you know, hang tight. Uh earnings sentiment has now come back up in the S&P 500 like a hockey stick. So that&#39;s good to see. MAG7 has lagged the rest of the market year to date. That continues to be the case. S&P 493 are up 1%. S&P was down 3%. This was a couple of days ago. And the MAG 7 down 12%. That was a theme coming into 2024 five. Go back at the tapes was uh MAG7 will dramatically underperform. International will dramatically outperform. Both of those have held true. Goldman&#39;s positioning indicator deeply negative territory suggests there&#39;s room for stocks to rally. We agree. Uh what is this? Oh, this just shows S&P stocks above the 20-day, 50-day, and 200 day moving average. So, the 200 has got plenty of room to run here. The S&P just overtook the 200 day moving average. Take it for what it&#39;s worth. VIX below 20 is another another clue. The worst is over. 12 months out. Median return 10.3%. Advanced decline line continues to climb uh hits record high for the first time in a 100 days. One year later, average market&#39;s up 14.21%. Total US dollar futures positioning uh is getting shorter. So probably we have this counter trend rally go a bit lower first before getting a bigger bounce. We&#39;ll see what happens. uh we&#39;ll pay attention to the commitment of traders reports as stocks continue to claw back potential all-time highs. Remember that only twice in the past 75 years did stocks peak in February. Uh stocks tend to peak in December or January according to this Carson data. Chart of the day better than expected 1Q earnings. They were expected to be 6%. They came in at 13.4. S&P has surged since Trump said great time to buy. It surged by 14% since that tweet and by pure well it wasn&#39;t luck because I I&#39;ve just done this so many times I could tell we were at a peak crescendo of of fear and that&#39;s why I chose that day to do it and then sure enough that was the inflection uh which very similar to the COVID lows when I got quoted in that article uh and market watch saying we are buying during the 1918 Spanish flu the Dow was down 35 5% we&#39;re down 33%. Uh we don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen, but with all these great companies marked down, we&#39;re buying high quality businesses. Two days later, the market bottomed and never looked back. Uh S&P 500 rebound is one of the biggest under Trump era CTA positioning. Again, this is what we&#39;ve been talking about. They are forced buyers for the foreseeable future. Uh there&#39;ll be a few fits and starts.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nClimate related spending 12 month moving average by type. So you can see government spending is going down.

Great article there. Good observation. Goodbye EV tax credit. Hello aid for buyers of USmade cars. Some details of President Trump&#39;s so-called big beautiful tax bill are out. Now, automobile investors have two matters con considered. The possibility that electric vehicle tax credits could vanish and the potential for a new tax break on cars assembled in the US. House Ways and Means Committee set to release so-called markup details of bud budget reconciliation bill. Beautiful bill. Uh details have emerged. Repeal of EV tax credits. Uh, consumer credits will be repealed almost immediately while business tax credits will be phased out. Right now, consumers can claim a deduction. Duh. Just created a leasing loophole. Looks like commercial gradual phase out. A new tax break for American assembled cars is also part of initial market. Essentially, car buyers could deduct interest on auto loans from their taxable income if the car was made in America. Boom. Shakalaka, ladies and gentlemen.

National Association of Active Investment Managers starting to play catch-up after the fact. Uh Russell 2000 earnings uh up 1.53% in the last 60 days. Top 30 weights down 45 basis points for next year. S&amp;P earnings on the other hand are down 93 basis points for this year, 122 basis points for next year, normal during this time of year. And then the CPI inflation number came in lower than expected, lowest in four years. And uh and now the Fed has no excuses with the tariffs. So uh",
    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nwe expected resolution. We didn't expect it this quickly. Uh it's it's unreal. And right now it's exacerbated by the fact that the phrase of the day is called trapped bears. Okay, we had record selling by hedge funds and CTAs at the absolute low in early April. So now the market's come so far so fast even before today and they were praying for a retest of the lows that never came. So now they've got to buy up. They're forced buyers. They're forced covering. So this could probably get some continuation, some followthrough for the next few days because so many people are structurally off sides. So what are you expecting now? Cuz yes, you you made the point about trap bears before we had any deal on the table between the US and China. And all we had on the table was the framework of a deal between the US and and UK. So you call them the trap bears. How do you see this forced buyer dynamic playing out? Well, they got to catch up. And and what's interesting is who's been buying from these trap bears. We have a record amount of announced buybacks from companies. $665 billion. So, they're buying, these poor guys are trying to cover their shorts, trying to catch up, trying to chase up uh uh the rally. So, my guess is this is going to continue for a few days. They're going to force them in after a huge move off the bottom even before today. And then we'll probably get a little bit of volatility as people digest like oh we've got 90 days etc etc. So expect a little shortterm material followthrough but it's very interesting on uh April 7th or April 8th Trump went out on truth or Twitter or whatever social media platform and he said now's the time to buy stocks and no one believed him and the next day the market went up. Last week he did the exact same thing when people were getting pessimistic before the UK deal and he said America is going to boom and he also referenced stocks. So if they say you know everyone was looking for the Fed put and the Treasury put the Trump put is real. He's paying attention. He listens to people and why we were optimistic and why we were positioned for this not to happen so soon but positioned for this to happen uh eventually is because he's shown and the administration has shown flexibility and and rationality throughout this process. He genuinely does want to negotiate better deals. And if you remember the first term, the people with assets like me that manage money, we did okay. It was a good four years. that everyday people that work every day, the middle class, the lower middle class, they did better than ever during those four years. And that's what President Trump wants to see. And it's deals like this and initiatives like this that is that is going to create that. You won't see it in a week, but over the next few months and couple years, you're going to start to see that middle class. We've we have seen more flexibility come up than come to pass than we initially saw at the beginning of April. Um, but I do wonder if some of that is because of the leadership shift shift that we saw with essentially the Treasury Secretary with uh Besset leading versus Navaro. They did put Navaro in the closet for a few weeks which was, you know, a welcome reprieve uh by yours included. However, I will say I, you know, Lutnik did get the job done with the UK and that kind of paved the way for positive talks with Bessant over the weekend. So, I got to give credit where credit's due. And, uh, President Trump has made no bones about he wants to be recognized as one of the greatest presidents in history. If stuff like this continues to happen and him cleaning up methods, messes that have been going on for decades. I'm not blaming anyone administration. Republican administrations, Democratic administrations neglected to do this. If he cleans this up, he's got a shot at his goal for sure. Okay. And let's talk about you mentioned the buybacks at record levels. Uh so how important is that in terms of driving momentum? Well, there's no question you've got CTAs and hedge funds covering now chasing up now $665 billion of buyback announcements. Oh, and by the way, earnings in the face of all of this uncertainty and craziness, earnings were came in much better than expected. 13.4% earnings growth versus 6% estimates. And the forward guidance hasn't come down that much for 2020. Some of them have and then some haven't even given guidance. Yeah. Yeah. Fair. But listen, let's look at S&P earnings for 2025 came down to, you know, basically from 270 to 265 about 3.5% since the beginning of the year. That's pretty material. However, 2026 backend loaded still $300 a share of earnings, which implies we're trading at about 18 1.5 times compared to the 10-year average of 183. Okay, there's still things to do. And then so speaking of things to do, I know you have some picks. Um, you like Disney. Tell us about your thesis there and if you still like it. Yeah, it, you know, it's interesting. We were pounding the table publicly for Disney. It got down to like 85 and then after we went out buy it at 85. I think it went to like 83 or 81, of course. Uh, and now it's at 108. We think over the next two years, this is a $200 stock. They're hitting on all cylinders, whether it's the parks, whether it's the cruise experience, whether it's the consumer products. And they just guided they said we're going to do $17 billion of cash from operations this year. That ship and by the way 180 million subscribers they're second to Netflix. They added 2 and a2 million. They're going to do this ESPN. Their sports business is through the roof. So we continue to like it despite the fact it's moved up so much in the last few weeks. And the Abu Dhabi um Yeah, that doesn't hurt either. Yeah. And what else is on your list? Uh oh, here's one that no one's going to want to buy. Albam Marl. Okay. This is Okay. Tell me about this one. Yeah, you know me. I'm early and people like there are sometimes some kicks on your list. I'm like, huh? And then a year later we sit down, you're like, \"Oh, that was pretty good.\" All right. So, Albamaro, number one lithium producer. Also lowest cost lithium producer. Lithium prices are in the garbage. Why? Because everyone says EVs are out of favor. Blah blah blah. China is 60% of the EV business. It's not a natural market. It's a government subsidized market. They have an initiative. They're going to continue to grow. They grew EV sales 38% last month in China. So what's going to happen? As one of the biggest producers, you just wait it out. Lithium prices are very cyclical. Every few years they go up and down. We're at the trough right now. They've got $3.1 billion of liquidity to sit it out. All the small players will go out of business. That shrinks supply. Demand continues to go up. And energy storage is a big thing. Overall demand from 1.2 million metric tonses right now to 3.2 in the next 5 years. Albam Marorrow, you know, we talk about Disney going going up to 200. Albam Marorrow could be a triple over the next three to five years. Really? Okay. Because we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of um I don't know if they're going to pull it back up again, but we just threw up a chart and you mentioned the trough of lithium. The chart looks like that. I'm going to I'm going to tell you something right now. It's at $61. It's going to go let's say it's going to go right after I get off the air. It'll probably go to $55. Everyone will say that guy's an idiot. two a year and a half from now, you're going to have me on, Diane. And the thing's going to be over 100, probably closer to 150.\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nOkay. All right. You heard it here first. That's Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital. Our thanks to Tom. And we're back. Quote of the week.

We cover it very frequently on the show.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAnd when we did that special call for clients on April 7th or 8th, whatever it was the day before Trump tweeted, \"Now's a great time to buy stocks.\" Um we went through that and we said, \"Listen, look at the revenues. Look at the free cash flow. Look at the balance sheet.\" And we went company by company by company and and we said if there was ever a time if you you know we've never asked number one we've never asked anyone to invest. Okay people come to us that listen to the podcast or come from referrals of people etc. Number two we've never asked existing clients to put in more money. They put in more money as they get more money as we deliver results. That's the way it works. Uh but we didn't do it twice. We did it in October 2022 and the people that took advantage of that uh just we crushed it. Okay. because they were throwing a uh uh Amazon out. They were throwing everything was getting thrown out with the bathwater. Amazon and Google were quick doubles in a year. And then um and then the last time we did it was just four weeks ago. And I was on April 11th on uh Vanney talking Disney at 85 and Boeing. Uh Boeing had already moved up. You know, we were pounding the table before that, but it was like 154.

    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\n a 20-day high that goes through 50% uh it tends to be a sign of immense strength and the the rally tends to follow through pretty dramatically even if you get a short-term check back before you power higher. And he goes all the way back and he shows all these instances recently in 2023 2022. Then he goes back to 2020 uh and shows what happened when that type of stuff happens coming out of COVID. Then he shows it in 2018 coming out of uh of the first Powell mishap. Uh then he shows it in 2015 and these are all follow-through rallies. Then he goes back to 2008 to 2013 how it worked every pretty much every single time. Then he shows 1972 to 1983. So this is an interesting indicator. Even if the markets moved a lot, when these extremes happen, it means there&#39;s strength behind it. And even if you get short-term checkbacks, it tends to precede big rallies.\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nUS is 64% of global equity market versus 61% average of the 2020s. It hasn&#39;t been this high. You got to go all the way back to June of 2003 when it peaked at 55% of global equities. And that&#39;s one of the indicators pointing to the theme that we&#39;ve been talking about when it was unpopular that international would outperform US and it&#39;s dramatically outperformed this year and that trend will continue I think for the foreseeable future next handful of years. That doesn&#39;t mean the US is going to do poorly. What it means is that international pockets of international will outperform uh even if the US does okay which we believe it certainly will and then you&#39;ve got China PBOC cutting rates by the way global M2 money supply is booming uh which means liquidity is coming into the market and largely it&#39;s coming from China. China was a source of illquidity for three years, draining liquidity. Now they are a source of expanding liquidity from all their stimulative practices uh and um and easing. So this is going to be a positive thing not only for China for but for the rest of the world. They&#39;re finally",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\npicking up the baton that the western world uh ran with during COVID and afterward. Now they are uh picking up the charge uh moving forward. So here&#39;s the asset quilt of total returns. You can see EHA is dramatically outperforming. EA is positive. S&P was negative. It might be might be positive or flat on the year after today. Emerging markets is outperforming all the things that we said. If you go back to the fourth quarter, I said the last shall be first, international, etc. and S&P is towards the lowest, international is towards the highest. And uh and there you go. Dollar faces a secular decline. So you&#39;ll get these counter trend moves, but we know the trend is down in the intermediate term. One month since the bottom, had a bounce in tech, industrials, consumer discretionary, financials, real estate, uh etc. have done very well. biggest four-week outflow from US stocks since May of 2023. Biggest tech outflow in 11 weeks. So that&#39;s in the last week or so. Consumers momentum remains. So this is the difference between hard and soft data. They say they&#39;re miserable, but they keep spending money. Then we look at uh AutoSAR for April was 17.3 million, ladies and gentlemen. So obviously a little bit pull forward with the tariffs, but now we got to replenish the the detocking cycle and uh there going to be incentives for car owners and you&#39;ve got a 13.5 year average car on the road. Uh lot of things going on here. So if this 17 plus can can continue, we&#39;re going to continue to see extraordinary things from Cooper Standard. Okay, I wouldn&#39;t expect this to be a straight line, but look at where the trend is going. Just like every single recovery, which was our thesis from day one when we put on that first huge position at $5 and change in May of 2022 and went on the claim and countdown on June 6th and pitched the stock and here we are 5x so far and just getting started. We think this is going to be a multibagger even from these levels. International versus US stocks rolling fourmonth performance spread. So internationals outperforming US by 16.2%. Ladies and gentlemen, the last time you saw that spike was the early 2000s and that trend continued for 5 years. It was one of the biggest periods of international outperformance over US. And uh and that&#39;s that uh number of consecutive weeks with AI bears above 50% was 11 weeks. You haven&#39;t seen that since the early 90s. You had an 8-year bull market after that and since the great financial crisis and you had a multi-year bull market after that. AI asset allocation lowest equity exposures since October 2023. Now is a time to be a buyer, not a seller. Global monetary stimulus is going through the roof. This is the threemon sum net number of rate cuts globally going up. What follows that? Global manufacturing PMIs. They&#39;re down here on the mat. They are going to spike up. firms plan to pass tariff related costs to consumers. Okay. Well, now the tariffs are a lot less than advertised. So, uh it&#39;s going to be less of a story. US companies buying back stock at a record pace. Most announced buybacks in more than a decade, 665 billion in the first quarter of 2025. Watch what people do, not what they say. Best one-mon return since 2020 uh off the COVID lows. That was a that was the best year. Unbelievable year. Uh rallies of this magnitude often have legs. Um one month rolling returns of these levels greater than 14% is often carried on with a forward 12-month return of 25% on average and positive 95% of the time since 1978. 56 instances. Average return after a month like that is six month return is like 14% 12-month return is 25%. Uh how you doing? Uh it&#39;s gonna be a fun time. So as Vney called me the resident bull uh I&#39;ll be willing to carry that title for some time to come. Uh average US gasoline price ahead of peak demand season. Uh EPS revision tracking near historical pattern a little bit better than historical pattern. uh announced buybacks versus actual. So, there&#39;s a lot of catch-up here. There&#39;s a further bid in the market. PBOC stimulus, we continue to cover active listings relative to the start of the year from realtor.com. They&#39;re picking up. Supplies coming on. That&#39;s good to see. Germany expected to inject up to $1 trillion into the military and infrastructure. Okay, that&#39;s a lot of pressure from Trump. That&#39;s good. University of Michigan consumer confidence at points like this when it&#39;s so flushed out they tend to perceive very good things in the equity markets companies are maintaining guidance more than usual and that&#39;s one point that I&#39;ve made despite all the uncertainty fact that this year only came down 3.6% 6% and next year has held up. Now that you see a lot of the tariffs coming down to 10% from these astronomical levels, I think we&#39;re going to just see uh guidance start to go back up and people are going to get excited. Retail investors at lower levels than 2019. Net inflows to US versus Europe. Systematic positioning in US equities. This is what we&#39;ve been talking about with regard to the CTAs and hedge funds. they haven&#39;t sold this much in the hole, been this short since the COVID lows and they missed, you know, what was like a 90% rally thereafter. Uh, and I think the same thing is happening right now. What what was forced sellers is now going to be forced buyers every positive headline. So, these type of opportunities don&#39;t come around that often, ladies and gentlemen. Institutional position in S&P 500. uh asset manager positioning well below the market&#39;s taken off without them. They are going to have to chase up just like every single time. Some potentially good news. S&P drops 10% in two days. When did he publish that? Anyway, 12 months later, the S&P is up 32.6%. So, we saw that in April. [Music] Uh here&#39;s the reciprocal tariffs, China&#39;s retaliatory tariffs, and now back down. So it went up to 14525, now it&#39;s down to 3010, which is a good place for it. ETF float. By the way, the big story, and my friend Jerry actually emailed me about this, who I met in Hawaii. He said uh the biggest thing and and this is a guy who ran one of the greatest banks of all time uh US bank and he said the biggest thing is the opening of China to US businesses. It&#39;s not the tariff rate and if they get these non-tariff barriers removed it is going to be boom time. Uh you know I&#39;ve said in past podcasts $1.1 trillion dollar of S&P revenues comes from China from the S&P 500. So if they open up more to US businesses, this is going to be a boom for China, a boom for the US like we&#39;ve never seen before. Our ETF flow tracker suggests national team has been buying to support the market in China. So uh you can see cumulative flows to the top five NT holding ashare ETFs. Uh net buyers. So the Chinese government is propping up the market until it takes on a life of its own. So they&#39;re they&#39;re in the game.

Weaker dollar and strengthening euro and pound are expected to be a strong tailwind for GXO in 2026 with an improvement over prior FX guidance if current rates hold through 2025. They're going to get better. So that's that. You can go through the call. We've highlighted the important parts. And finally , Baxter update prices followed cash flow. There's no accident about that. But look what's happening to revenues. They're starting to recover. Return on capital is going up. Margins are going to improve from the cost cuts. Uh delever the balance sheet and moving forward to bigger and better things. You got to have a healthcare play. This is ours. This is going to be a good stock. You can go through the uh call and you can go through the analyst reports here. Fair value and this is in the midst of pessimism. Fair value 60% higher. Uh general almost it's actually more than 60% 55 it's almost 100%. Uh fear and greed starting to tick up. National Association of Active Investment Managers starting to play catch-up after the fact. Uh Russell 2000 earnings uh up 1.53% in the last 60 days. Top 30 weights down 45 basis points for next year. S&P earnings on the other hand are down 93 basis points for this year, 122 basis points for next year, normal during this time of year. And then the CPI inflation number came in lower than expected, lowest in four years. And uh and now the Fed has no excuses with the tariffs. So uh",
    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nwith that said , let&#39;s get down to the\nask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nquestions . For those of you who don&#39;t stick around for\n\nask me anything , here we go. Jun Jin Jin Nan Chen asks about United. I continue to keep an eye on that. I continue to do nothing. Same thing that as they ask every single week, but um I think it&#39;s going to take some time. I I I would I should probably just stick an alert on this at $200 to $250. I don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll ever get it, but it&#39;s going to take some time. I mean, you basically got all these institutions completely just stuck in the stock. This thing has had a monster run, 60 bagger in, you know, a decade. I think this is going to consolidate for a while and uh I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a favorable environment for them. So, I&#39;m in no rush to do anything. Looks cheap relative to recency bias, but in absolute terms, it&#39;s run a lot. You still like Goose? Yes, I do. That was a tariff problem. They&#39;re going to be fine. China&#39;s coming back. We We have no problem with that, Jake. We haven&#39;t added, but uh we&#39;re very very comfortable with that. And GXO, absolutely, we&#39;ve added uh and um we&#39;re we&#39;re very comfortable with that. GXO, no-brainer there. Um, Mike Mos. Uh, we met at Oh, wow. Okay, cool. Uh, someone just invited me to play Aoyo Trabuko. That&#39;s a great course. The answer is yes. I&#39;d love to join you. Uh, Rick Richard VST is buying back a ton of stock. Do you ever consider any name near new highs that likely goes much higher? Um, no. I don&#39;t I don&#39;t buy anything at new highs. Um, my job is to find it when no one wants it, not when everyone wants it. This is a offshore driller, I think. Let me just double check. DST. there&#39;s someone promoting the out of this stock because I get the same question every single week and it seems like everyone&#39;s amped up on this and it sounds to me like they&#39;re going to get distributed on their heads. So, look, cash flow has been flat for three years. So, yeah, they&#39;re using that to buy back stock. What do they do? Is this a utility? Okay, so this is a utility. So, they&#39;re all thinking it&#39;s going to be the the uh AI derivative play. Just play it through coms. just play it through natural gas. It&#39;s a better derivative play at a lower price. Um, let me just take a look here. You missed this. Just it could go higher, but you missed it. I mean, bottom line is the time to be looking at this was when it was at $10 and $15 and and they couldn&#39;t give it away. At 200 after a 10 bagger, you get the crumbs. if it goes to 250 to take that level of risk. Uh let&#39;s take a look here. Okay, so they&#39;re still growing and they&#39;re buying back shares. Okay, so that&#39;s that&#39;s not a bad thing, but they they bought back 30% of the float and the stock&#39;s up 10x. Um, generally a low return on invested capital business, free cash flow. Let&#39;s see what that&#39;s doing. It&#39;s down off last year. I just I&#39;ve I&#39;ve just seen this movie before. I understand like if you&#39;re just looking black and white at the data, if you&#39;re if you have 30 years of experiencing seeing these promotes come and go, you kind of just like, yeah, I&#39;ve seen this movie before. It&#39;s not going to end well. Does it go to 300 before it goes to 50? Maybe. But that&#39;s that&#39;s a trading gambling game. That&#39;s not really a game I want to play. Let&#39;s take a look at uh let&#39;s take a look at the liabilities long-term debt is 15 billion up from five in 2016. Cash is so they got a billion dollars of cash and 15 billion dollars of debt and they&#39;re buying back stock like there&#39;s no tomorrow. Why don&#39;t you pay down a little bit of debt? Yeah, I I don&#39;t like that. I think this is a complete promote and they&#39;re buying back stock to get themselves out and and take a look at all the options they have. They&#39;re probably I I I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s a lot of exercising of options going on into that buyback. So, I&#39;m I&#39;m a pass unh same same thing. Uh good\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nthough, Rick. Uh Mike Mos, oh sorry, keep bringing that one up. Byron Firestone sent in a question earlier but forgot to include the United Healthcare. Everyone keeps asking me about No, not yet. Recency bias, ladies and gentlemen. You think it's cheap relative to this 10-year historic run. It I think the distribution is kind of just starting on that one. I I'm not I'm not going to touch that. I think in the short term it's going to bounce for sure. Uh, as a trade, yes, but as a long-term investment, no. It No. No. AEO from Dan S. I think we've covered this a million times. Yeah, you get a bounce, but I mean, I like consumer discretionary right now. I think this is a trading stock. This is not the type of business I want to own. It'll be fine. It'll probably bounce up. You'll make eight or 10 bucks and get the hell out. Um, PII, same thing. Let's take a look. I don't like these uh recreational vehicle businesses. They're low quality, but they get beaten down enough. I know Fox FOXF was a big one. I mean, these revenues are like revenues and margins are just collapsing on this thing. I mean, maybe low rates will help it. I I don't like these businesses. I mean, let me look at FOFX. Everyone was asking when it was uh you know, when it was right here, everyone wanted to buy FOXF because of recency bias. You missed it. It's full distribution. This bottoming is going to take forever. I I I'm just going to steer clear of that. Uh I don't like it, but it probably works as a trade. Muhammad A, hey, not a question but wanted to say, do you miss the good old days when China was uninvestable? Yeah, I do. I mean, you know, at some point you get, you know, it's like if it was still down in the 60s and 70s, would I be adding more? I mean, we got enough. I mean, we brought our basis down to 82 and change. I'm fine. I mean, like, I got a so much Xi Jinping is getting a Christmas card for taking so long. Um, all right. That's David. All right. Brian. Okay. Brian Firestone asked, \"Hope you're well. Been sharing your podcast with all my friends and family because I think you're truly amazing. I've learned a lot from you.\" Thank you. Very kind and I'm very grateful for you doing that. Uh, hopefully be a client in the future, but not there assetwise yet. My question is that you'll get there. Uh my question is about Regeneron. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals seems like they are down about 55% from all-time high and earnings seems to have slowed since 2021 but not over the past two years. Your thoughts? I've been watching this one Byron. So um we haven't done anything yet. We generally don't like to buy individual biotech stocks. Uh we we own the basket XBI. I think that's the better way to play everything right now. But um it is a great company. I think their Ilia sales slowed last quarter. I mean cash flows come down. Revenues have been flat. Gross margins are really declining. So I I have to understand the turnaround story better. Um, this is one I'd probably stick a alert on for under 500 and at 400 load the boat. I don't know if I'll ever see that, but um I think it's going to take a little while to build a base on this one. I think you're right, but I think it's early and I want to see some signs of recovery first, which uh let me just take a look at a couple of things here. Yeah, still generating a lot of cash. What's going on with the share account? Pretty flat. Balance sheets probably fine. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, if you have a 10-year horizon, it's okay. I just don't see that it's actionable right yet. Um, Griffin Brown, what do you see will be the impacts of the drug price reductions on XBI? I wouldn't worry about it. They're just going to they're going to do spread it out across other countries. They're going to fight it. It's the drug companies always win. At the end of the day, it's always been that way. All right. Curious about IIPR. Um, in in one of those big new uh client accounts, XBI was a new position. It's no problem with that one. Um, and we generally never do ETFs except for that one sector. We only do individual companies. Curious about IIPR. This is for I think someone asked about this. There must be someone promoting this piece of crap. It's a like a weed re innovative industrial properties. Um regulated cannabis facilities taxes real year ended. Uh too many things outside of your control. Don't make life hard hard on yourself. just go after easier. Put that in the too hard pile. You can't you can't handicap what's going to happen in that industry. And if you can, there are probably better ways to play it. Mr. Hayes, when you decide to buy or sell stock based on fundamental thesis you have developed, do you ever use technical indicators to implement your buy or sell decision? Uh, pro tip. Yeah, I mean, I look at all the standard things, but they don't really play a bearing because if I'm looking at it, it's already down a lot anyway. So, I'm not worried about the last five or $10. Um, so the answer is no. That's more for trading. Uh, let's see here. Wait. All right. Here's a jokester saying he's Donald Trump. All right. That's not a question. That's a attempted joke. Appreciate it. Next time be funny and I will laugh. Uh, all right, Professor Tom. Yeah, portfolio waitings I can only go through with clients. Uh, Nar Bonsel Microchip. I think we've covered this one. I don't like it, but it probably works. MCHP. Yeah, I don't know. With this much deterioration, the stock hasn't really fallen enough in my estimation to justify taking a bet. You know, if this if this was a $20 stock from 100 with this much deterioration in the business, I'd be interested. But the fact that it's down like 30%, I don't like it. And there's no clear signs of turnaround yet, but it'll probably work as a trade. Um, all right. Here's a guy calling for the end of the world last week. I guess that was before the UK deal talking about must be reading a lot of Zero Hedge. Although Zero Hedge has turned more positive lately. Uh, all right. Drew Robinson says, \"Was reading the intelligent investor today and came across this line. quote, \"If he is the right kind of investor, he will take added satisfaction from the thought that his operations are exactly opposite from those of the crowd.\" End quote. Could not think of a more fitting line for the hedge fund tips community in 2025. I agree. Now to the question, thoughts on UPS may have covered this recently. I did cover it last week. I think it's right and I think it's a little bit early. So, um, I just think it's going to take a little time to build a base. they've destroyed a lot of institutional holders. Uh I'm willing to be wrong on that and miss it, but I think just give it a little bit more time. I I think if your time horizon is over five years, you should buy it now. But um I just I really like buying great businesses when they're just so destroyed. I mean, right now it's like, yeah, it's pulled back to where it was pre-COVID. Cash flow's starting to recover. margins are still crushed. Not yet for me, but I like the idea. Uh just not not right yet. So,\n\nNar Bonsel Microchip. I think we've covered this one.

Yeah, it, you know, it's interesting. We were pounding the table publicly for Disney. It got down to like 85 and then after we went out buy it at 85. I think it went to like 83 or 81, of course. Uh, and now it's at 108. We think over the next two years, this is a $200 stock. They're hitting on all cylinders, whether it's the parks, whether it's the cruise experience, whether it's the consumer products.

The chart looks like that. I'm going to I'm going to tell you something right now. It's at $61. It's going to go let's say it's going to go right after I get off the air. It'll probably go to $55.

      "This one you know we talked about Disney going up whatever it was a double plus from from this thing can go up a lot more than that over the next 3 to 5 years as the the market demand for lithium from 1.2 million metric tonses today to 3.2 two just in five years. And and uh so we&#39;re not looking at a triple because the operating leverage in that business could be a lot more than that. So that&#39;s a good one. It&#39;s a long-term one. It&#39;s whatever $61 today. I&#39;m sure it&#39;ll go to 55 tomorrow, but a year from now it&#39;s going to be a lot higher. I can tell you that right now.

Return on capital is reacelerating again. Uh pretty much every single unit was up. Uh revenues were up 7%. Um free cash flow more than doubled. Uh they they guided 17 billion dollar of cash from operations this year.$180 million subscribers. They added two and a half million subscribers. They&#39;re opening the park in Abu Dhabi. I mean, it just goes on and on. And um this one&#39;s going to be a $200 stock. It&#39;s just a matter of time. So, no one wanted at 85. Everyone will want it at 150 to 180 and people will be naming their dog after Disney when it hits 200. Um so turbocharged investment in experiences $30 billion in domestic parks has led to more expansion projects underway globally than at any point in Disney&#39;s history. Uh strong film slate coming high margin of creative cruise business which we talked about the highest return on in capital of the whole entire product suite.

Should I buy Disney at $85? These are no-brainers. And the problem is uh you know there&#39;s there&#39;s two ways to interpret the word no-brainer. and the the people that pass on these opportunities uh you know no comment. All right, so",
      "Other particular stocks on your radar? Yeah. Uh Disney, we came out publicly like 3 4 weeks ago. It was a no-brainer. We said buy Disney at $85. Of course, the next few days it went down to like $82 because that&#39;s what always happens. But now it&#39;s at 108. It&#39;s going to continue to climb over the next two years, probably over 200 in our view. Uh, every all of their segments are growing at mid- teens, double digits. They just put guidance out for $17 billion of cash from operations this year. So, this is this is a well-run business. 180 million streaming subscribers. They grew 2.5 million. So, there&#39;s a lot of good things happen there. They&#39;ll continue to invest. We we saw the park in Abu Dhabi. They&#39;ll continue to invest in the cruise ships which have a very high return on invested capital like mid20s return on invested capital. So that business is going to continue to grow. And then the second one I have uh no one is going to buy when I when I when I put out this name. They&#39;re all going to like you know say this guy&#39;s crazy. And then a year from now we&#39;re going to be back on and be like do you remember last year? It&#39;s called Albamar. It&#39;s the number one lithium producer positioning for materials. materials is going to have the highest earnings growth, second highest earnings growth in 2026. You&#39;re getting positioned ahead of time. Lithium isn&#39;t a glut. Everyone thinks EVs are done except for the fact the US is 10% of the market. China is 60% of the market. It&#39;s not a natural market. It is a subsidized market. It is policy initiative. They grew EV sales 38% last month. Albamaro&#39;s lowest cost producer. They&#39;ve got these mines in Chile and they&#39;ve got $3.1 billion of liquidity to ride this out. So as all the smaller players go out of business as prices are down that shrinks supply album is left standing and the operating leverage is huge. This one you know we talked about Disney going up whatever it was a double plus from from this thing can go up a lot more than that over the next 3 to 5 years as the the market demand for lithium from 1.2 million metric tonses today to 3.2 two just in five years."

Both of them are up 30% in the last three weeks since then. It&#39;s it&#39;s unbelievable. Um so uh Bo",
      "You don't have to think about you don't have to stay up at night thinking about should I buy Boeing at $130? Should I buy Disney at $85? These are no-brainers. And the problem is uh you know there's there's two ways to interpret the word no-brainer. and the the people that pass on these opportunities uh you know no comment. All right, so\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmoving along  GXO. So look, Price has followed cash flow. There's no uh accident about that. We saw they got the new um uh the new board members. These guys aren't coming on because they think the company's going to fail. They're coming on because they know it's going to be the best logistics company in the world and they're taking advantage of the weakness in the market to cobble up. The CMA decision is going to be finished. Um, first off, increased first quarter revenue was plus 21% year-over-year to three billion. Organic revenue grow 3%. Uh, sales pipeline to three three-year high of 2.5 billion. That's excluding the Winkitin business, which is under the CMA review after the fact. Uh, they also repurchased almost three million shares, 2.8 8 million reaffirm fullear organic revenue growth and adjusted EBID guidance. Okay, they have Boeing as a client by the way. That's pretty cool. New win, Aldi, Kimberly Clark, Nike, ASOS. Cash flow operating cash flow was 29 million. Free cash flow is negative, but that's normal this time of year. So, let's cover the key points. Sales pipeline three-year high at 2.5 billion, up 13% year-on-year. Winkington and CMA review process is now in its final stages with an outcome expected in a few weeks. An integration set to begin before the Q2 earnings call. Management expects either full clearance, which would be $10 in the stock, maybe 20 of the deal, or a request to divest the grocery business, which makes up only about 6% of the original Winkington business and has much lower margins than the overall business. Management continues to expect 58 million in cost synergies once integrated, providing a margin tailwind as 2025 progresses. after announcing a 500 million share repurchase pro 5 billion share repurchase program earlier in the year. Management purchased no 500 million put billion uh purchased 2.8 million shares for around 110 million. This reduced the share count by approximately 2.4% in this quarter alone. If Sustained GXO is on track to repurchase about 10% of the overall float this year, which means you own you get a 10% larger slice of the pie without putting out one new penny. GXO signed a landmark 10-year deal with England's National Health Service supply chain, the largest contract on record with a lifetime value of around 2.5 billion. Operations are expected to begin in early TW uh Q3. Uh management doesn't anticipate significant startup costs and expects the deal to be major catalyst for expansion to healthcare with a strong new pipeline of healthcare related customers expected to be announced in Q2. Surprise, surprise. Why do you think all these directors are coming on board? Management reaffirmed the 2025 outlook expecting organic revenue growth of 3 to 6% IBIDA 840 to 860 million normal operating environment. These results would have had led to an increase in the fullear outlook. To put this in context, management is projecting an 8% gross organic wins for the year. And in Q1 alone, they booked 228 million, delivering about 7% organic growth. This essentially implies no incremental wins contributing to revenue for the rest of the year, despite an all-time high sales pipeline at 2.5 billion and the landmark NHS deal. Welcome to Sandbagger City. Six. Management has seen no material impact on the sales pipeline or customer demand due to tariffs and has no exposure to China. In fact, the added complexity of tariffs has provided a tailwind for outsourcing wins highlighting uh highlighted by a 41% increase in wins during Q1. Seven, operating return on invested capital was 45% well ahead of the long-term target of 30%. Free cash flow is an outflow of 48 million in line with normal seasonality and impacted by the delayed Wington synergies. Management continues to expect 25 to 30% 5% 25 to 35% of adjusted Ebida to free cash flow conversion for the full year. So call it 250 of free cash flow. AI and automation are now live at 20 different operations delivering record setting productivity improvements in stock replenishment, order allocation and item inspection management is beginning to see the first cost savings as results and expects to see savings continue ramping through 2025. North America was the strongest region in Q1 driven by strength in aerospace i.e. Boeing and industrial customers. Continental Europe continues to per perform well with slight weakness in volumes in the UK during Q1 expected to rebound through Q2. Overall, business is seeing similar trends heading into Q2. Weaker dollar and strengthening euro and pound are expected to be a strong tailwind for GXO in 2026 with an improvement over prior FX guidance if current rates hold through 2025. They're going to get better. So that's that. You can go through the call. We've highlighted the important parts. And"
