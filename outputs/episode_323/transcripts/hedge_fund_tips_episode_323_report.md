# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode Not applicable
### Week Ending November 26, 2025

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on healthcare, small caps, and AI beneficiaries in 2026. He believes the market is underestimating the potential for economic growth due to combined fiscal and monetary stimulus. He is rotating out of crowded AI cost centers (hyperscalers) and into AI beneficiaries, dividend payers, and undervalued sectors like healthcare. He sees a generational buying opportunity in healthcare and expects small caps to outperform large caps. He is also positive on housing and energy. He is buying PayPal aggressively.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Fiscal and monetary policy guns blazing going into 2026
- Underestimation of economic growth potential
- Rotation into undervalued sectors
- Strong consumer spending and household balance sheets

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is poised for strong growth in 2026, driven by fiscal stimulus, monetary easing, and rising wages. Main Street will benefit from these policies, and sectors like healthcare and small caps will outperform. The consumer is resilient, and household balance sheets are strong. The Fed's QE light and global central bank cuts will add tremendous liquidity to the market.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Household Cash as % of Total Financial Assets | 7% (98th percentile, highest since 1950) | As rates come down, money market yields compress, forcing money into the stock market, benefiting dividend payers. |
| Small Cap Earnings Growth | 55% expected | Lower rates help small caps refinance, leading to outperformance. Triple the earnings growth for slightly less multiple is a formula for success. |
| Healthcare Outperformance in Midterm Election Years | Up 9% vs S&P up 2% since 1950 | Healthcare tends to do well in volatile periods and is a major AI beneficiary. |
| US Midcaps Trading at a PE | 15x vs 22x | Lowest rate we've seen since 1999 and 2000. International stocks outperform US peers. It will persist in 2026. |
