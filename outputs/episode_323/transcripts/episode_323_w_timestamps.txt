[00:00] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[00:02] Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your
[00:05] 323rd videocast podcast for the week
[00:08] ending December 24th, 2025. Happy
[00:11] Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas to
[00:14] everyone who's celebrating tomorrow. We
[00:16] got a lot of great stuff to cover today.
[00:18] So, we're going to get right down to it.
[00:19] But, as always, family first. want to
[00:23] thank our friends Jim and Parvina for
[00:25] having us on their incredible
[00:28] uh party for the boat parade we got to
[00:32] watch. Uh very very grateful. We had
[00:34] such an amazing time. There's Annabelle,
[00:36] Mimi, Caitlyn. Uh what a fun time.
[00:39] There's uh Annabelle out by the ocean
[00:42] with a a bird there. Uh more from the
[00:45] party. There's Annabelle in front of the
[00:47] Christmas tree. Uh, Zack made a
[00:50] incredible Christmas card here for hedge
[00:52] fund tips. Uh, more Christmas stuff with
[00:56] my Grinch Christmas sweater. Uh, that
[00:59] was a fun day. And that's that. Uh, h
[01:03] here's a picture with beautiful Caitlyn
[01:06] uh at the party. You can see some of the
[01:08] boat parade. Uh, Orange County is like
[01:11] nothing else uh in Connecticut. Uh, it's
[01:14] a lot different than snow. They have all
[01:16] the boats decorated up and uh driving
[01:19] around the harbor, which was just
[01:20] incredible. There's Mimi and Annabelle.
[01:24] Uh this is They do drones in the air.
[01:27] There's Santa on a surfboard, total
[01:29] California style. Ah, there he is. Uh
[01:32] drones with Santa on a sleigh.
[01:35] And you can get a sense of all these
[01:37] boats passing by in the harbor with
[01:40] their lights on. That's me and Mimi.
[01:42] What a what an incredible night.
[01:44] Um, and absolutely a tremendous amount
[01:47] of fun. Very grateful for that. Quote of
[01:49] the week. Uh, we have, "In the world of
[01:53] business, the people who are the most
[01:55] successful are doing what they love."
[01:57] That's from Warren Buffett. And the
[02:00] second quote from Peter Lynch, know what
[02:03] you own and know why you own it. These
[02:07] are two of the legends. I never feel
[02:09] like I've worked a day in this business.
[02:11] I absolutely love this and I try to uh
[02:14] impart that on on our incredible
[02:16] listeners here and our philosophy
[02:19] certainly is knowing what we own and why
[02:23] we own it which is why we can sit
[02:24] through the short-term volatility until
[02:26] the turnarounds take place uh and do it
[02:29] over and over and over again uh which is
[02:33] which is really great. And now I want to
[02:36] get down to some media.
[02:39] First and foremost, I would like to
[02:42] thank
[02:43] Payton Payton Jennings and Ash Webster
[02:47] for having me on Fox Business this
[02:50] morning on Christmas Eve to talk markets
[02:53] and outlook and AI and more. We're going
[02:56] to listen in here.
[02:57] >> Working Thomas Hayes joins us now. Uh
[03:00] Thomas, let's start with this. What's
[03:03] the biggest expected AI surprise do you
[03:06] think in 2026?
[03:09] >> Well, Ash, good to be with you. I think
[03:12] even bigger surprise was what happened
[03:13] in 2025
[03:15] with Intel being the number one
[03:18] performing AI stock. It outperformed
[03:22] Nvidia twice the returns. Nvidia up 36%
[03:26] uh as of yesterday. Intel up 81%. Now
[03:30] moving into 2026, I think the biggest
[03:32] surprise is the AI beneficiaries are
[03:36] going to outperform the AI cost centers.
[03:39] What does that mean? The beneficiaries
[03:41] are regular businesses, main street
[03:43] businesses, the unmnificent 493
[03:46] components of the S&P 500 that will be
[03:49] implementing AI to lower cost, increase
[03:52] productivity. The underperformers are
[03:55] going to be the AI cost centers which is
[03:58] are the hyperscalers that are doing all
[04:00] the capex right now. Capex as a
[04:03] percentage of operating cash flow for
[04:05] the hyperscalers uh mag 7 etc is over
[04:09] 60%. There's only one other industry
[04:12] that has capex that high that is big oil
[04:15] and that's why you're seeing some
[04:17] retreat uh market getting a little bit
[04:19] worried about return on invested
[04:20] capital. So, expect the normal companies
[04:23] to outperform in 2026. We started to see
[04:26] tastes of that in 2025 with Amazon up
[04:29] only 4%, Apple up only 8%, Microsoft up
[04:33] 15%, uh, and Intel up 81%.
[04:38] >> I got about 30 seconds. Uh but uh there
[04:42] are a lot of analysts who say look
[04:43] that's all great but we must have a
[04:46] broader market advance that it can't be
[04:48] this narrow uh you know sector of stocks
[04:52] leading the way. Do you do you agree
[04:54] with that?
[04:55] >> I agree and I think that's going to be
[04:58] surprising for people that that's
[04:59] exactly what takes place in 2026. uh as
[05:03] I said the regular everyday businesses
[05:05] implementing that and one of the biggest
[05:06] beneficiaries Ash is going to be health
[05:09] care uh that it uses it to increase
[05:12] margins lower costs but specifically for
[05:15] AI drug development health care tends to
[05:18] outperform in midterm election years
[05:20] when there's volatility on average since
[05:23] 1950 up 9% whereas the S&P up only 2%
[05:29] just over 2% so you definitely want to
[05:31] play the broadening theme and you want
[05:33] to play the groups that are utilizing
[05:37] AI, not the ones that are investing all
[05:38] the capex where most people are crowded
[05:41] in those stocks. So, if you're focused
[05:43] in there, you might want to trim back
[05:45] and and play the broadening theme in
[05:47] 2026.
[05:50] >> Great stuff. Really uh interesting and
[05:52] informative. Thomas Hayes, as always,
[05:54] thank you, Thomas, for joining us on
[05:56] this Christmas Eve. Great to see you.
[05:59] >> Thank you. Merry Christmas. We are.
[06:01] Merry Christmas to you. We're taking it.
[06:04] >> And we're back. Uh, and then I would
[06:08] also like to thank
[06:11] besides Payton Jennings over at Fox, I
[06:13] would like to thank Justin Oliver over
[06:16] at Yahoo Finance and Brian Sazi for
[06:20] having me on this morning to go into a
[06:23] pretty detailed outlook for 2026 and
[06:27] beyond. We're going to listen in here.
[06:29] >> All right. We are being reminded in the
[06:31] final stages of 2025 that it's the AI
[06:34] trade that stirs the drink for
[06:35] portfolios. This will probably be the
[06:37] case in 2026, especially as companies
[06:40] like Meta and Amazon spend hundreds of
[06:42] billions of dollars to build out AI
[06:44] infrastructure in this country. Thomas
[06:46] Hayes, great capital chairman and
[06:47] managing member and Angelo Poffus,
[06:49] Edward Jones, senior global investment
[06:51] strategist. Uh I know have some thoughts
[06:53] on the AI trade. Going to start with
[06:55] you. Uh, Thomas, what has surprised you
[06:58] this year on the AI trade?
[07:01] >> Well, uh, I I'll tell you, Brian, it
[07:03] wasn't a surprise for us, but I think it
[07:06] was a dramatic surprise for the market
[07:08] and may still surprise some people when
[07:11] they hear it right now. The number one
[07:14] performing AI stock for 2025
[07:18] was not Nvidia. It was Intel. Intel was
[07:24] up uh as of yesterday 81.4%
[07:29] year to date.
[07:30] >> Intel's still around Thomas. They're
[07:31] still around. They still do business.
[07:33] >> They still do business and the world,
[07:35] all of the chip designers are
[07:37] dramatically dependent on them
[07:40] succeeding in developing advanced chips
[07:43] and the US government is standing behind
[07:45] that because we don't want to be
[07:46] dependent exclusively on Taiwan
[07:48] semiconductor. So Intel was the number
[07:50] one chip and hyperscaler followed by
[07:53] AMD. So Intel was up 81%, AMD up 77%.
[07:58] Nvidia up 36% not bad but less than half
[08:02] of the returns of Intel. Microsoft only
[08:05] 15%, Apple 8%, Amazon 4%. So uh I think
[08:10] people were a little surprised that uh
[08:13] that the most popular names uh were more
[08:16] subdued than expected. And I do think
[08:17] that theme is going to persist, but but
[08:20] we'll get to that.
[08:21] >> Angelo, hit me with a surprise. I think
[08:23] uh that Intel move, the fact that it
[08:25] outperformed Nvidia certainly has
[08:27] surprised a lot of folks. What's uh
[08:28] what's been on your radar?
[08:29] >> Yeah, I think one thing that may
[08:31] surprise many of your viewers is that
[08:33] valuations for the tech sector are lower
[08:36] now than what they were at the start of
[08:39] the year. So basically what has happened
[08:41] is that earnings have been growing
[08:43] faster than prices. So that pushes back
[08:46] against all that AI bubble narrative
[08:49] because it is really earnings that have
[08:50] been doing the heavy lifting for the
[08:52] tech sector and that I think is a
[08:54] comforting message. Yes, tech is the
[08:56] most expensive segment of the market but
[08:59] it has been able to deliver earnings,
[09:01] solid earnings and what has happened
[09:03] late in the year is probably a healthy
[09:06] pause. Uh but the AI theme is likely to
[09:08] continue.
[09:09] >> These are surprises I needed. Tom and
[09:11] Angela, you have clearly brought your
[09:12] agame here on Christmas Eve. Tom, back
[09:14] to you. I think Angel makes a very good
[09:16] point on on valuation. So, question to
[09:19] you. Is AI are AI stocks still cheap?
[09:22] Then
[09:24] >> I think that we have to be a little bit
[09:27] careful as we look into 2026. I think
[09:30] the theme is not going to be the AI
[09:33] stocks. It uh or the AI cost centers
[09:36] rather when we think about hyperscalers
[09:38] and some of the chip names. The theme
[09:40] for 2026 and the biggest surprise is
[09:42] going to be AI beneficiaries. those that
[09:45] are implementing the technology into
[09:47] their businesses to improve productivity
[09:49] to improve margins and uh to to Angelo's
[09:54] point uh earnings have grown but if we
[09:57] look out three quarters it's expected
[10:00] that the earnings growth rate of the
[10:02] Magnificent 7 relative to the earnings
[10:06] growth of the unmagnificent 493 we could
[10:09] say cost centers versus AI beneficiaries
[10:13] is going to convert urge, meaning the
[10:16] unmagnificent 493's earnings growth rate
[10:18] will be equal to or greater than the
[10:22] Magnificent 7 earnings growth rate by
[10:24] the third quarter of this year. And
[10:25] that's why I think we're going to see as
[10:27] we see in midterm election years, the
[10:31] indices a little bit more subdued, a
[10:34] little bit more choppy, a little bit
[10:35] more volatile because the biggest
[10:37] weights of the S&P 500 are probably
[10:40] going to take a breather or consolidate
[10:43] their gains uh as that earning growth
[10:46] decelerates. The other thing that we
[10:48] have to keep in mind here Brian is that
[10:50] uh cap X as a percentage of uh operating
[10:54] cash flow now for the hyperscalers is uh
[10:58] exceeding levels of big oil greater than
[11:03] 60% of operating cash flow is now going
[11:05] to capex and that's part of the reason
[11:07] that that growth rate is declining and I
[11:10] think we're going to see a lot of money
[11:11] made under the surface in individual
[11:13] stocks the AI beneficiaries and maybe
[11:16] more subdued returns again from the AI
[11:19] cost centers aka hyperscalers and the
[11:22] stocks that most people are crowded into
[11:24] at the moment.
[11:24] >> Uh Angel talking about subdued returns
[11:28] this year hasn't been a great year
[11:29] relatively speaking for Meta and Amazon
[11:31] but Amazon in particular up only 5%. I
[11:34] mean that's ugly out uh performance
[11:35] versus the S&P 500 and the rest of the
[11:37] mag 7. If in January do you are would
[11:41] you be inclined to buy these AI lagards
[11:44] like a meta and Amazon?
[11:46] >> Our call for next year is rotation both
[11:49] within tech and outside of tech. Uh it
[11:52] is interesting that four of the seven
[11:54] magnificent seven names have lagged the
[11:56] S&P but that's followed the year
[11:59] multiple years of very strong
[12:00] outperformance. So I think some of that
[12:02] rotation is is healthy. uh we are seeing
[12:06] potentially the early stages of the move
[12:09] from the companies that really enable
[12:12] and facilitate the buildout of AI
[12:14] towards the companies that are adopting
[12:16] it and I think that's going to include a
[12:18] broader set of opportunities for
[12:21] investors and that is beyond tech as
[12:23] well thinking about industrials
[12:25] healthcare these are some sectors that
[12:27] we see potential benefits flow through
[12:29] but I think the name of the game is
[12:31] diversification not concentration in
[12:34] 2026 6.
[12:35] >> Tom, tell me if I'm totally off base
[12:37] here. So, you have the rate, you have
[12:38] the Fed cutting rates. Maybe they put
[12:40] come in with one more rate cut early
[12:42] next year. You have a whole class of of
[12:44] people that have been making bank off of
[12:46] CDs, lowrisk investments. Are they now
[12:49] forced back into this market to earn a
[12:51] good return?
[12:53] >> I they are forced back into the market,
[12:55] but guess where they're forced back into
[12:57] is probably one of the most unloved
[13:00] areas of the market. As a matter of
[13:02] fact, dividend payers are the most out
[13:05] of favor and lower relative valuation
[13:07] than they've had in 25 years.
[13:09] >> That makes no sense to me, Tom. I mean,
[13:11] we're supposed to like dividends. We're
[13:12] supposed to champion dividends. We want
[13:14] this check coming to our mailbox every
[13:15] every quarter.
[13:17] >> Well, there's no question. And to
[13:18] exactly to your point, as the Fed cuts
[13:20] and that free uh interest payments on
[13:23] those money markets goes down, they're
[13:24] going to be forced to find the yield
[13:25] elsewhere. That's going to be dividend
[13:27] payers. Now, what is dividend payers?
[13:29] Where do you find the dividend payers?
[13:31] Well, you tend to find them in defensive
[13:33] stocks, consumer staples, uh, healthc
[13:36] care, some of the the stocks. Now, if
[13:38] you look at healthcare in particular,
[13:40] lowest waiting in the, uh, S&P in a
[13:43] handful of years, lowest, uh, relative
[13:46] valuation to the S&P in 25 years, I
[13:49] would say right now is a generational
[13:51] buying opportunity in the healthc care
[13:53] sector. Oh, and by the way, in midterm
[13:56] election years, healthc care
[13:58] dramatically outperforms the indices.
[14:00] Since 1950, the S&P tends to be more
[14:03] subdued in midterm election years, about
[14:05] 2% returns. Well, guess what? Healthcare
[14:08] does over 9% and the last 3 four years,
[14:11] you couldn't give healthcare away. So,
[14:12] expect good things from healthcare uh
[14:14] for a couple of reasons. One, the
[14:16] dividend yields. Two, it tends to do
[14:19] well in uh volatile periods. And three,
[14:21] I think it's going to be one of the
[14:23] major AI beneficiaries, not cost
[14:26] centers, aka they're going to use AI to
[14:29] uh lower cost, increase productivity,
[14:32] and in a material way in drug
[14:35] development. So healthcare is the name
[14:37] of the game for 2026.
[14:40] >> Angelo, next year, is that the year of
[14:41] the dividend?
[14:43] I
[14:44] >> think uh it can have improved
[14:45] performance relative to the other years.
[14:47] We like midcaps as well. think about
[14:50] asset classes, midcaps, some
[14:52] international, still emerging markets.
[14:54] We talk about AI and technology, but
[14:56] there's a lot of innovation also
[14:58] happening beyond the US borders. Uh, and
[15:01] as you talked about the Fed and slightly
[15:03] cutting interest rates next year, that
[15:06] gap now between cash returns, returns on
[15:09] cities, money market funds, and either
[15:11] you talk about fixed income or dividend
[15:13] paying stocks, that gap is going to
[15:15] widen. So we could see some rotation out
[15:18] of heavy excess investments for many
[15:21] investors into cash towards other asset
[15:23] classes.
[15:24] >> Uh Tom, real quick, do you chase gold
[15:26] here?
[15:28] >> No, we like productive assets, but just
[15:30] to jump on what Angelo said, he pointed
[15:33] to midcaps. Well, look at the earnings
[15:34] grow expected growth rate of the S&P at
[15:37] 14%. How about small caps? Expected
[15:40] earnings growth of 55%.
[15:42] They're just coming off the mat. But I
[15:44] think you can get a lot of bang for your
[15:45] buck in 2026 in small caps as well.
[15:48] >> All right, guys. Uh, stick with me. We
[15:49] got a lot more coming up here on opening
[15:51] bid. Straight ahead, uh, not an opening
[15:52] bid, I should say, Morning Brief.
[15:53] Straight ahead of Morning Brief, I'll
[15:54] spotlight a few hot tickers lighting up
[15:56] the Alifines platform this morning. Got
[15:58] to get my shows right.
[16:00] Welcome back to Morning Brief presented
[16:02] by Robin Hood. Now, time for some of
[16:03] today's trending tickers. We're watching
[16:05] BP, Santa, and UiPath. First up, BP. The
[16:08] energy company says it has reached an
[16:10] agreement to sell a majority stake in
[16:11] its Castro Lubricants business. The
[16:13] shareholding has been sold to investment
[16:15] firm Stone Peak in a $10.1 billion deal.
[16:18] Upon completion of the transaction, a
[16:20] new joint venture will be incorporated,
[16:22] comprising a 65% Stone Peak and 35% BP
[16:25] ownership. BP noting that its retained
[16:27] stake provides exposure to Casual's
[16:29] growth plan while retaining optionality
[16:31] to realize further shareholder value in
[16:33] the future. Next, Santa Fe announcing it
[16:35] has entered into an agreement to acquire
[16:37] Dynavax technologies. The bioarmmer
[16:39] company aiming to augment its presence
[16:41] in adult immunization with Dynavax's
[16:43] vaccines, adding that Dynavax's adult
[16:45] hepatitis B vaccine and shingles
[16:47] candidate brings new options to Santa's
[16:49] portfolio. The acquisition involves a
[16:51] cash tender offer to acquire all
[16:53] outstanding shares of Dynavax,
[16:55] reflecting a total equity value of
[16:56] approximately $2.2 billion. Finally,
[17:00] UiPath seeing shares pop as the company
[17:02] is set to join the S&P Midcap 400 index.
[17:06] The stock will join the index uh before
[17:08] trading starts on January 2nd, 2026.
[17:11] UiPath is replacing Synopus Financial,
[17:14] which is being acquired by Pinnacle
[17:15] Financial Partners. This move for UiPath
[17:18] comes as the autom automation software
[17:20] company has seen over 20% gains so far
[17:22] this year and even solid gains this
[17:24] month following its earnings release.
[17:26] UiPath reported upbeat third quarter
[17:28] results that saw better than expected
[17:29] earnings and revenue.
[17:32] All right, 2026 is fast approaching, but
[17:34] first lessons learned in 2025 with an
[17:37] economic twist. As I wrote on my
[17:39] LinkedIn page this morning, I'm
[17:41] surprised consumer spending hasn't
[17:42] fallen off a cliff given tariff related
[17:44] price increases in a lot of categories
[17:46] found in supermarkets and malls. Yet
[17:49] consumer spending grew at a strong three
[17:50] and a half% pace in the third quarter,
[17:53] largely a function of strong spending by
[17:54] higher inome households. So what did I
[17:57] miss and what does it mean for next
[17:58] year? Tom Hayes, great capital chairman
[18:01] and managing member and Angelo Koffus,
[18:02] Edward Jones, senior global investment
[18:04] strategists are here. Uh Tom, back to
[18:06] you here on this. Can this spending
[18:09] within the highincome household, which I
[18:11] would argue has held up consumer
[18:13] spending this year and the broader stock
[18:15] market, can that continue at its pace
[18:16] next year?
[18:18] I think it can. I think you look at
[18:20] household balance sheets. Uh cash levels
[18:23] at 7% are the highest since 1950. So
[18:27] there's a lot of dry powder on the
[18:28] sidelines. I think uh I think you have a
[18:31] little bit more volatility picking up in
[18:33] the market in the midterm election year
[18:35] that might create a little more subdued.
[18:37] But if you look at consumer sentiment,
[18:39] man, it is washed out. And people are
[18:41] still spending. They're spending.
[18:43] They're saying, "I'm depressed." But
[18:44] apparently they're taking that
[18:45] depression and they're going to the
[18:47] stores and spending money because
[18:48] >> Tom, nobody wants to tell the world
[18:49] they're rich. Nobody wants to say it.
[18:51] They just want to live under the radar,
[18:52] buy their Rolexes, and just don't tell
[18:54] anybody, Tom.
[18:55] >> Yeah, but listen, you can't you can't
[18:56] make this up. Consumer sentiment is
[18:58] lower than it was during COVID, the
[19:00] great financial crisis, and the Vulkar
[19:03] crash in 1980 and and things are
[19:06] relatively good. So, I do think there's
[19:08] some tailwind behind this. I think the
[19:10] consumer can spend. We saw it yesterday
[19:12] uh spending at 3.5%. We saw it in GDP
[19:15] 4.3%. GDP now for Q4 is over 3%. Holiday
[19:20] spending looks pretty good this year. So
[19:23] I do think that's going to persist and I
[19:25] do think that you're going to continue
[19:26] to see an increase in real wage growth.
[19:29] Let's hope we see some more benefits to
[19:32] Main Street in 2026. Uh and I think that
[19:35] could be the theme moving forward versus
[19:37] just the upper end carrying the the
[19:39] water. uh seeing everyone participating
[19:42] and and benefiting from some of these uh
[19:45] progrowth economic policies.
[19:46] >> Angelo, is next year the year of Main
[19:48] Street? That main street finally starts
[19:50] to feel a bit better and they got out
[19:52] and spend in places outside of dollar
[19:55] stores.
[19:56] >> It's been more than two years that wages
[19:58] have been rising faster than inflation.
[20:00] It's a process that takes a while for
[20:03] consumers to feel confident that they
[20:04] are catching up. uh but the combination
[20:08] of still a solid labor market yet
[20:10] slowing and at the same time moderating
[20:13] gradually moderating inflation that is a
[20:15] good mix when we talk about the macro
[20:17] it's all about growth in inflation and
[20:19] we've seen positive surprises on both
[20:22] fronts so I think it looks favorable the
[20:25] backdrop for uh next year and as they
[20:27] say never underestimate uh the US
[20:30] consumer and especially as we talked
[20:33] about balance sheets continue to look
[20:35] and remain and healthy.
[20:36] >> Yeah, we can't help ourselves, Angela.
[20:38] We all want that 10th big screen TV. We
[20:40] all want it. We can't help ourselves.
[20:42] But Angel, is it as simple as to say
[20:44] that the stock market is at records and
[20:46] that's what fueling spending with higher
[20:48] income consumers or is there something
[20:50] else going on here we need to know
[20:51] about?
[20:52] >> No doubt. That is a big supportive
[20:54] factors. Uh the status, the 10% the
[20:58] higher the top 10% on the income
[21:00] categories, they account for 50% of the
[21:02] spending. And we've seen gains not only
[21:05] in equities in fixed income. Talk about
[21:07] investment grade bonds that had the best
[21:09] year since 2020. Real estate prices have
[21:13] been appreciating. And yes, we are stuck
[21:15] in this low hiring, low firing type of
[21:19] labor market. But at the same time, the
[21:21] employment rate remains uh historically
[21:24] low. Uh so, you know, I think that again
[21:27] is a positive as we head into the next
[21:29] year. Tom, hit me with a potential
[21:31] economic surprise for next year.
[21:34] >> Well, I think I think the surprise is
[21:36] we're underestimating what's happening.
[21:38] We're having both guns blazing with an
[21:42] easing cycle with the Fed. We continue
[21:44] to ease. We continue to cut. But oh, by
[21:47] the way, QE light is back. The Fed is
[21:50] going to be in the market buying $40
[21:53] billion of tea bills at least through
[21:56] April. So, that's going to add a
[21:58] tremendous amount of liquidity. had over
[22:00] 320
[22:02] global central bank cuts in 2025. Uh
[22:06] highest you've seen since since the
[22:08] great financial crisis that works on a
[22:09] lagged effect. So you have a lot of
[22:11] liquidity there. You got these tax
[22:13] refunds of a,000 to $2,000 going out to
[22:16] Main Street. You potentially have if the
[22:19] Supreme Court turns uh turns off the
[22:21] tariffs or or uh unwinds them in a way
[22:25] uh Trump is not going to give that money
[22:26] back to to foreign uh entities. he's
[22:29] going to pay it out as dividends and
[22:31] then he's going to figure out how to do
[22:32] the tariffs in another legal framework.
[22:35] So, you could have a a tremendous amount
[22:37] of fiscal stimulus coupled with an
[22:40] easing cycle coupled with rising wages
[22:43] and really benefit Main Street in 2026.
[22:46] So, I think people are kind of
[22:48] underestimating not just the earnings
[22:50] growth, not just uh uh Main Street, but
[22:53] fiscal and monetary policy guns blazing
[22:56] going into 2026. That's a positive.
[22:58] >> I'll weigh in with the surprise here. I
[23:00] think what we're going to see on on the
[23:02] on the GDP front is going to shock the
[23:03] hell out of people. And I mean to the
[23:05] upside. I mean, we have AI
[23:06] infrastructure being built out
[23:07] aggressively in this country. You guys
[23:08] are talking about higher wages. We've
[23:10] got rate cuts, lower rates from the Fed.
[23:12] I mean, Angelo, the ground is set for I
[23:15] think some serious upside to economic
[23:17] growth in this country next year. But if
[23:19] that does happen, what does that mean
[23:21] for the outlook for rates?
[23:23] Yeah, I think the key in all of this to
[23:25] connect all of these dots is
[23:27] productivity. Let's look at corporate
[23:29] profits. Corporate profits have been
[23:31] booming without companies adding much
[23:34] headcount and that implies real
[23:36] productivity gains. Maybe too early to
[23:39] say that all is AI. But since after the
[23:42] pandemic, we know that technological
[23:44] adoption really accelerated and
[23:46] potentially we are in this period of
[23:48] sustained productivity gains. So the
[23:50] goldilocks is if we can sustain above
[23:52] trend growth for a while without
[23:54] generating inflation. Our call is that
[23:57] with the economic growth holding steady
[24:00] potentially even above 2% the Fed
[24:04] slightly cutting rates towards 3 to 3
[24:06] and a half% maybe the 10-year yield
[24:09] doesn't have necessarily much downside
[24:11] below 4%. So, we're looking at
[24:14] rangebound yields, but still a Fed that
[24:16] kind of moves more closely to to that
[24:19] neutral rate again between 3 and 3 and a
[24:21] half%. So, not much downside, but you
[24:24] don't really need to as long as the
[24:25] economy continues to perform as it has.
[24:28] >> Tom, 30 seconds left. Do you have one
[24:30] investing resolution top of mind for
[24:32] yourself for next year?
[24:35] >> Well, I think we're going to keep doing
[24:36] what we did in 2025 because it worked. I
[24:38] I think the thing that is going to
[24:40] surprise people is that equalw weight
[24:43] indices could outperform cap weighted
[24:47] indices. I think people who are just
[24:48] stuck in regular cap weighted indices
[24:50] like the S&P 500 are going to be
[24:53] underwhelmed with their returns in 2026.
[24:57] And the people that venture out a little
[24:59] bit either the stock pickers I think
[25:01] there's going to be a fortunes made
[25:02] under the surface but the easy way to
[25:05] get exposure to that is with an equal
[25:07] weight index in which case uh would be
[25:10] the first time in some time where the
[25:12] the broadening and that participation
[25:14] overwhelms what what people expect in
[25:16] the indices uh and that's a sign of
[25:19] health. That's a good thing not a bad
[25:21] thing.
[25:21] >> The future favors the bold. Happy
[25:23] holidays to you uh both gents.
[25:25] Appreciate you taking the time here.
[25:26] here. We'll talk to you soon.
[25:27] >> Thank you.
[25:28] >> Thank you. All right, that
[25:30] >> we're back. Uh then I want to thank all
[25:34] of you. Uh apparently a lot of people
[25:36] did Christmas shopping and are getting a
[25:37] ton of hedge fund tips. Hats and mugs
[25:40] and shirts and hoodies have been super
[25:42] popular. I love the hoodies. They're
[25:44] super warm. And then sending in their
[25:46] incredible photos wearing the merch.
[25:48] That's the name of the game, guys. um um
[25:53] how this grows and why I keep putting it
[25:55] out free every week uh for clients and
[25:58] non-clients alike and delivering this
[26:00] value is because you guys are doing a
[26:02] great job of sharing. So, if you're
[26:04] getting value uh and uh and it's really
[26:07] helping you and you're making money,
[26:09] share it with one person you love that
[26:12] could benefit from this information.
[26:14] We'll continue to grow. We'll continue
[26:16] to put this out. And an easy way to do
[26:18] is wear the hat, wear the mug. uh and
[26:20] people will ask you about it and give
[26:22] back to the community and then send in a
[26:23] picture so we can get you on here with
[26:25] everyone else. We've got a lot of great
[26:27] data to cover this week. Let's start
[26:29] with this chart from PayPal. You can see
[26:32] the free cash flow yield is nearing a
[26:35] record high at 10% free cash flow buying
[26:40] the stock at this price. We're super
[26:42] excited for 2026.
[26:45] key article here from uh American Banker
[26:50] and he's talking about you know 200
[26:53] countries 430 million active customers
[26:55] 35 million uh merchants $2 trillion in
[26:59] payment volume
[27:01] they're doubling down to use PayPal's
[27:04] vast scale to power new forms of
[27:05] artificial intelligence blockchain in
[27:07] its digital wallet um he ran into its
[27:11] small business group we know all this
[27:13] PayPal's betting big on a gentic AI to
[27:16] support its omni channel payment strat
[27:19] strategy. Agentic commerce services.
[27:21] They're a leader there. Agentic commerce
[27:23] is the next phase, says Chris. We're
[27:25] making sure an AI agent can make
[27:27] payments, figure out where they are, and
[27:29] find out what store is down the street
[27:32] and what what it is they want. PayPal
[27:34] enabled its merchants to become
[27:35] discoverable with within perplexity
[27:38] uh through its identity verification.
[27:40] Couple other things. huge opportunity.
[27:44] Uh, PayPal's partnerships with
[27:46] Ingenerative Agentic will give it an
[27:48] advantage. Inclusion into chatb GPT's
[27:52] instant checkout will make PayPal's
[27:54] branded wallet available as a payment
[27:56] method within instant checkout for op
[27:59] for merchants who opt in. So, just on
[28:02] and on really great stuff. talking about
[28:04] their partnership. Google, Amazon, and
[28:07] PayPal through its partnership of with
[28:09] Google have agentic scale access to PDP
[28:13] partnership with Google gives Alex Chris
[28:14] a direct ride on Gemini's growth and
[28:17] agentic dominance. People are really
[28:20] underestimating this. This is why we
[28:21] continue to buy shares like crazy this
[28:23] week. Uh and uh we're going to see some
[28:26] exciting things from PayPal in 2026.
[28:29] Boost brand checkout and international
[28:31] payments are two areas PayPal hopes will
[28:33] drive its growth in the future. Uh
[28:39] has evolved towards a digital wallet
[28:41] etc. So
[28:46] it's talking about a aentic AI being
[28:48] transformative for the business. This is
[28:50] not embedded in the price of the stock.
[28:52] Not to mention 10% free cash flow yield
[28:54] 6 to7 billion. Oh, and by the way, they
[28:56] buy in 10% of the stock every single
[28:59] year. Uh, so your slice of the pie gets
[29:02] 10% bigger without putting a new penny.
[29:04] So, we're excited for that one. Biggest
[29:06] surprise of this year, not for the hedge
[29:08] fund tips with Tom Hayes community.
[29:11] Intel was the number one performing AI
[29:15] stock in the semiconductor and
[29:18] hyperscalers better than all of um
[29:22] better than every MAG 7. uh up 81%
[29:27] year to date as of yesterday's close.
[29:30] More than double the returns of Nvidia,
[29:33] more than 20 times the return of Amazon,
[29:36] more than 10 times the return of Apple,
[29:39] more than six times the return of Meta,
[29:42] more than five times the return of
[29:44] Microsoft. So, it's been a great great
[29:47] year. We're super excited. You couldn't
[29:48] give it away under 20 when we were
[29:50] pounding the table on Vanney last
[29:52] September of 2024. And uh and there
[29:55] there you go.
[29:57] Uh here is uh talking about sector
[29:59] rotation from Strategus. We've covered
[30:01] that a million times over. Uh capex is
[30:05] now returning
[30:08] um depressing cash return on equity.
[30:11] We've been talking about that theme and
[30:13] we reemphasized it with Ash Webster and
[30:16] Brian Sazy on the media hits this
[30:18] morning which you heard. Um, we've got
[30:23] US dollar index kind of mimicking what
[30:25] happened the first term of Trump's
[30:27] presidential election, first two years.
[30:30] Expect continued weakness. Ladies and
[30:32] gentlemen, by the way, that is going to
[30:36] help our newest position in healthcare,
[30:39] which all the new clients that have been
[30:40] coming in for this quarter have been
[30:42] getting in their portfolios. All the
[30:43] existing clients, pretty much every
[30:45] single one of you, I was able to find
[30:47] room uh and um and get in this. 64% of
[30:51] their sales are XUS. So, the weak dollar
[30:54] will will give them a boost in 2026.
[30:59] Uh as well as the healthc care theme. Uh
[31:03] we love this one and we can't wait to
[31:04] bring this out and release it. Um we're
[31:07] doing the write up and uh we're getting
[31:09] uh everyone uh lots of shares. So, super
[31:13] excited for that. On to the next.
[31:14] Healthc care stocks are undervalued.
[31:17] This is why we we took profits on XBI
[31:20] and the biotech and we've added a third
[31:24] healthc care position. We want to take
[31:25] advantage of this once in a generation.
[31:28] Healthcare has not been this cheap or
[31:31] this low a weight in the S&P going back
[31:34] 25 years. Not to mention, healthcare
[31:38] outperforms in midterm election years.
[31:40] uh up 9% versus the S&P up 2% since
[31:44] 1950. Those are averages. Healthc care
[31:47] positioning is starting to build up but
[31:50] uh nowhere near near where it's going to
[31:52] be. Uh mortgage rates are starting to
[31:54] converge with Treasury yields falling
[31:56] over which is going to be positive for
[31:58] housing. They think Generrack, Stanley
[32:00] Black & Deckers, QXO, etc.
[32:04] Um tech bubble. This is global
[32:07] defensives as a percent of global market
[32:09] cap. You haven't seen
[32:12] this level extreme since 2000 when tech
[32:16] cooled pretty aggressively and defensive
[32:19] staples and uh I would put it as the
[32:22] unmagnificent 493 the non-mag7 type
[32:25] components started to outperform. Uh
[32:28] this is really an opportunity for the
[32:30] way this community is positioned and
[32:32] clients have been positioned. Uh so
[32:34] we're super excited. Okay, core
[32:36] inflation eases to its lowest level
[32:38] since 2021. Uh, many of the pundits were
[32:41] calling for the opposite. Those of you
[32:42] who are on this podcast knew better and
[32:45] you took advantage. Nearly all major
[32:48] equity markets have outperformed the US
[32:50] in 2025 in local and in USD terms.
[32:54] Ladies and gentlemen, that was a core
[32:56] theme for us in 2025 and helped us shoot
[33:00] the lights out and we're very grateful
[33:03] uh for that transition to technology.
[33:06] Hybrids are poised to grow in coming
[33:07] years. That helps Cooper Standard value
[33:10] versus growth dynamics have been
[33:11] diverging between the US and Europe. In
[33:14] other words, Europe value has started to
[33:17] take off. US value just starting. But,
[33:20] you know, that's such a such a broad
[33:23] term. It's like with what we were able
[33:26] to achieve this year and we're
[33:28] considered like value tilt type manager.
[33:31] What we're doing is entirely different
[33:33] than traditional value which is just
[33:36] buying cheap stuff and getting trapped
[33:38] in it. doing turnarounds with a
[33:40] catalyst. And we're buying great
[33:41] businesses at at in excuse me, we're
[33:44] buying good businesses at great prices
[33:47] uh versus great businesses at good
[33:49] prices because great businesses at good
[33:51] prices, that's a good way to compound
[33:52] your money at 20%. Uh good business at
[33:55] great prices is how you can shoot the
[33:57] lights out over time if you know how to
[33:59] do the underlying fundamental analysis.
[34:02] Uh great prices uh are not always great
[34:04] prices if something is cheap for a
[34:06] reason. And that's what we do here and
[34:08] that's what we teach and help you try to
[34:10] understand is how to distinguish between
[34:12] temporary impairments and permanent
[34:14] impairments with good businesses. Uh
[34:17] household wealth is is growing for the
[34:20] bottom 50%.
[34:22] Uh let's see active equity flows.
[34:27] Uh CPI housing inflation coming down.
[34:32] It's good to see that household cash as
[34:34] a percentage of total financial assets
[34:36] is now 7%, 98th percentile, highest rate
[34:40] since 1950. I'm telling you what's going
[34:43] to happen, ladies and gentlemen. As
[34:44] rates continue to come down, money
[34:46] market yields continue to compress.
[34:48] That's all going to be forced into the
[34:49] stock market from people looking for
[34:51] yield and dividend payers are going to
[34:53] fly. Cheapest relative value, most
[34:56] underappreciated bucket of the market
[34:58] since 2000. Get ready for a dividend
[35:00] payer boom, which is consumer staples,
[35:03] defensives, healthc care, which we're
[35:04] positioned to take advantage of. It also
[35:07] helps housing by the way, which we are
[35:09] also positioned to take advantage of.
[35:11] Annualized returns of US stocks by size.
[35:14] Uh this shift is going to go to small
[35:17] caps because uh small cap earning growth
[35:19] 55% lower rates help small caps
[35:22] refinance. Uh and the multiple is lower
[35:25] than large caps. So you get triple the
[35:28] almost quadruple the ear expected
[35:30] earnings growth for slightly less
[35:32] multiple. That's a formula for success
[35:35] and lower rates is the catalyst. It is
[35:38] the spark that lights the fire. Uh
[35:41] almost everyone is very long stocks.
[35:42] When they say this though you know what
[35:45] that implies is indices indices are cap
[35:48] weighted. Cap weighted is mag seven. And
[35:51] yes those guys are getting and going to
[35:53] get relatively torched. Maybe not
[35:56] absolutely torched, but certainly
[35:58] relatively torched to those who are
[36:00] playing outside that crowded space.
[36:03] Japanese 10-year yield highest going
[36:06] back to 1999. This is what we call a
[36:10] carry trade unwind, ladies and
[36:12] gentlemen. That's part of the reason
[36:14] that you're having pressure on the MAG
[36:16] 7. And we were early in telling you this
[36:18] would happen about a year and a half
[36:20] ago. And here we are today. bull bear
[36:23] indicator stretched little bit of
[36:25] exuberance. If you're in the crowded
[36:27] stocks, I'd watch out after the first of
[36:29] the year. Uh or be a little bit
[36:31] cautious.
[36:33] Here is earnings growth. Russell 2000
[36:36] 55% next year, S&P 500 14%.
[36:41] Um we've got a lot of great data this
[36:45] week. Median size of new single family
[36:47] homes is declining. This was another
[36:49] thing that we called early on uh would
[36:52] would happen and that's going to improve
[36:54] the uh housing affordability. Not every
[36:57] 23 year old needs 4500 square f feet in
[37:00] an indoor pool. Uh how about like the
[37:02] 50s when we had the housing boom. Think
[37:05] Levittown 1,500 1200 square foot houses
[37:08] on a slab. Have your first kid or two
[37:11] and a dog. Uh upgrade get in the game.
[37:14] By 35 you're upgrading to a 4,000 foot
[37:17] house. And off to the races. Uh,
[37:20] existing home sales starting to pick up.
[37:23] New vehicle average transaction price
[37:26] has now leveled off. This is helping
[37:28] Cooper Standard. We're going to talk
[37:29] about that in a second. Uh, Lenar's
[37:32] average selling price net of incentives
[37:34] is down 21.4
[37:36] from its 2022 peak. When factoring in
[37:39] incentive spending, the decline narrows
[37:41] to two 10 negative 10.8% from peak. We
[37:45] want to see volumes helps QXO. Volumes
[37:48] helps Generrack. Volumes helps Stanley
[37:52] Black & Decker building. We don't care
[37:54] about the margins of the builders just
[37:56] like we don't care about the margins of
[37:58] the auto suppliers. We want to play
[37:59] Cooper Standard. We are a pick and
[38:01] shovel kind of guy and um let the rest
[38:05] dig for the gold and gamble and win or
[38:08] lose. We could care less. We're the c
[38:09] We're the house. We're the casino. We're
[38:12] not the gambler. Uh here we go. Looking
[38:16] at some restaurant stocks.
[38:20] This sector has been absolutely
[38:23] decimated, left for dead. We finally
[38:25] found a play in it with uh friend of
[38:29] mine uh was telling me I was saying the
[38:32] name of our pizza place in in my old old
[38:35] town in Connecticut. Uh Papa John's.
[38:38] Papa John's. We love this one,
[38:40] especially with one and $2,000 increases
[38:43] in tax refunds. You know, Papa John's is
[38:46] not It's funny. I sent out gift cards to
[38:49] all of my clients for Papa John's this
[38:51] year. Last year, we sent them vans. We
[38:53] always try to send something from the
[38:54] portfolio. Uh, number one, so they can
[38:57] uh see what they own, and number two, so
[38:59] we can boost earnings for their holdings
[39:01] as owners. Uh, and uh, so all these
[39:04] sentaires and billionaires are having
[39:06] their Papa John's, but uh, for the for
[39:09] the uh, regular folk getting normal
[39:12] people getting,000 to $2,000 refund
[39:15] checks in April and possibly $2,000
[39:18] tariff checks and the military who got
[39:21] $,776
[39:23] dividend checks. Uh, those people can
[39:26] feed a family of four for 20 bucks at
[39:28] Papa John's. And I'm telling you, when
[39:30] that extra discretionary income comes
[39:32] in, they're going to do it in spades.
[39:36] Russell 2000 earnings growth uh in this
[39:40] Bank of Goldman Sachs note consensus is
[39:43] 61% earnings growth, which would be the
[39:45] highest we've seen since uh 254 23 22
[39:51] 2021
[39:53] and then going all the way back to 2010.
[39:59] So, we're excited to see that. And that
[40:00] was kind of the norm in the early 2000s
[40:03] when uh small cap value outperformed
[40:06] everything. Expect similar outcomes in
[40:09] coming months and years.
[40:16] Uh
[40:20] so these are some factors that they're
[40:22] putting into play to make housing more
[40:24] readily available, lowering land use
[40:26] restrictions, etc., etc., etc. Herd
[40:29] mentality, unanimously bullish and and
[40:32] uh clustered. I think it's going to be a
[40:34] subdued ne for people who are crowded
[40:36] into passive indexes that are market cap
[40:39] weight. Um I think they're going to be
[40:42] sorely disappointed, zero to 8%. Uh and
[40:46] I think fortunes are going to be made
[40:48] under the surface by stock pickers who
[40:50] know what the hell they're doing and um
[40:53] people in the right sectors. And even if
[40:55] you can't do that, buying an equal
[40:57] weight over a cap weighted should help
[40:59] you along the way, probably by a few
[41:01] full percentage points of performance.
[41:04] Uh on to the next consumer sentiment,
[41:07] lowest since COVID lows, uh even lower
[41:10] than the great financial crisis and down
[41:12] to the Vulkar lows and and then back to
[41:14] the early 50s. Uh that's generally
[41:16] bullish. uh when it gets this um
[41:20] negative uh is usually a good time to be
[41:23] buying the right type of stocks. Owner's
[41:26] equity in real estate continues to
[41:28] climb. That's the wealth effect.
[41:31] Equity funds large inflows blah blah
[41:34] blah.
[41:35] All right, pretty good job with the data
[41:38] in a short holiday week.
[41:41] S&P once again concentrated in expensive
[41:44] names. Price to sales greater than 10
[41:46] times is an extreme even after adjusting
[41:49] for select number of mega caps. Uh it
[41:52] hasn't been this extreme since 2000. Uh
[41:55] both on the cap weighted and the equal
[41:58] weighted. So I would strongly
[42:01] remind you if you were in crowded
[42:03] trades, get someone who knows what the
[42:05] hell they're doing or get out of the
[42:07] crowded trades and lighten up. Don't be
[42:09] a pig. pigs get slaughtered. Uh Federal
[42:13] Reserve balance sheet down 2.43
[42:15] trillion. They're starting up again. QE
[42:18] light 40 billion a month of bond
[42:20] purchases. That is adding liquidity.
[42:24] That is QE again. That is positive for
[42:28] risk assets. Small cap equity position
[42:30] just starting to increase. Here are the
[42:33] leveraged long ETF assets. Uh as you can
[42:38] see when it hits this level of peak
[42:40] expect some more consolidation and
[42:42] that's again going to hit the most
[42:44] crowded trades in the cap weighted
[42:46] indexes. Analysts expect China AI capex
[42:50] to rise but at a much smaller scale than
[42:51] the US. Their earnings are going to rise
[42:53] much faster than their capex. In the US
[42:56] the opposite is true. US economy expands
[42:59] at the fastest rate in two years. We saw
[43:01] the GDP numbers this this week uh for
[43:04] Q3. for Q4 GDP now is at 3% also very
[43:09] positive.
[43:13] Uh normal December seasonality playing
[43:16] out we're right here tends to be
[43:18] strength into the end of the month. US
[43:20] midcaps trading at a PE of 15 times
[43:23] versus 22 times. That relative PE of.7
[43:27] is the lowest rate we've seen since 1999
[43:30] and 2000. So alongside the small cap
[43:33] theme, this is a generational
[43:35] opportunity to get exposure to midcaps
[43:38] like the new position we put into the
[43:39] portfolio like the VF corps of the world
[43:44] like uh quite a few of our number our
[43:46] companies are midcaps and that's going
[43:48] to benefit greatly in coming months and
[43:51] years. International stocks outperform
[43:53] US peers. We said that was coming this
[43:55] year. It will persist in 2026.
[43:59] And that's it for the data of the week.
[44:00] Now on to Alibaba has soared. China tech
[44:03] stocks can ride the AI wave further,
[44:06] says Goldman. Opinion follows trend.
[44:08] None of them were interested at $60.
[44:10] Everyone's interested at $150 and going
[44:13] higher. This stock has the potential to
[44:16] double again, but it's going to take
[44:18] another three years to do that, which
[44:20] slows down the IRRa. Uh, which is why
[44:23] new money, new client money is not
[44:26] aggressively going in there. We were
[44:28] buying till our fingers bled at 60 at
[44:31] the lows. Brought our basis down to 82.
[44:34] Now we're just enjoying the ride and
[44:36] holding all of our shares through to the
[44:40] promised land. How Warren Buffett did
[44:43] it. This is by Seth Clarman in the
[44:45] Atlantic. One of the best articles I've
[44:47] read. Go ahead and read that when you
[44:49] have time. Go to google.com.
[44:53] Cox automotive forecast. Despite Q4
[44:56] slowdown, new vehicle sales forecast to
[44:59] reach 16.3 million in 2025, up from
[45:03] 2024. Best results since 2019, which
[45:07] means Cooper Standard's going to be
[45:09] smiling so wide they can eat a banana
[45:11] sideways, minting money as the volumes
[45:14] grow. and we're nowhere near the cycle
[45:16] peak uh which we think it can earn $10 a
[45:19] share as opposed to its last peak at
[45:22] $7.19 a share of earnings in 2017 when
[45:26] it was $146 stock. Uh so we're early
[45:29] days and we're super excited on that
[45:32] front. Let's see what we've got here.
[45:34] We've got the Bloomberg
[45:38] uh massive security thing never letting
[45:40] me into my own subscription. EV sales
[45:43] growth is slowing. Are hybrids the
[45:45] solution? They are for Cooper Standard.
[45:48] We love the cost per vehicle and the
[45:50] amount of parts that they sell into
[45:52] hybrids. Disney stock is the analyst top
[45:54] this analyst top media pick. Wyatt can
[45:57] bounce back. Uh we love Disney. We've
[46:01] got it a lot of it in the mid80s. We've
[46:04] had it for some time and now they're
[46:05] talking about catalysts for acceleration
[46:09] between streaming, between parks,
[46:12] between cruise business, uh, highest
[46:14] return on capital business in 2026. We
[46:17] love it. We agree. Avatar 3 tops China
[46:20] box office in another win for Disney.
[46:23] They're crushing it at the box office,
[46:24] by the way, with all their films this
[46:26] year. Holiday retail spending rose 4.2%
[46:29] this season, driven by e-commerce and
[46:31] electronics. That's even more pronounced
[46:33] in China, which Alibaba is the toll
[46:36] taker, which we love. Retail stocks
[46:38] could get a tax refund boost in 2026.
[46:42] Picture of Nike sneakers. What they
[46:44] should have is a picture of Vans because
[46:46] skateboarding is all the rage. If you
[46:48] look at the Paris fashion show, it was
[46:50] all skater shoes. And with the high-end
[46:52] collabs they have with the Valentinos
[46:54] and everything else, it's going to be a
[46:56] great year for VF Corp and Bracken aka
[47:00] Growth Daryl. For those of you who
[47:02] missed the interview I did with the CEO
[47:04] of VF Corp aka Vans Timberlin Northface,
[47:08] uh just go to hedge fund tips uh I'm
[47:11] sorry, go to YouTube, type in hedge fund
[47:13] tips bracken darl and you will see that
[47:16] full interview early days on that stock
[47:18] despite its recent move higher. Bessant
[47:21] sees room for a future revamp of Fed's
[47:23] 2% target. You heard it here first. I
[47:25] said 3% is going to be the new 2% and uh
[47:29] we have not changed that view. Bessant
[47:32] is riding driving the bus. Home sales
[47:34] climb to a 9-month high as sellers
[47:37] finally give in. Affordability is
[47:39] happening. The air pocket is here and
[47:42] it's going to continue as rates lower.
[47:46] This time will be different because
[47:48] we're going to get a lot of boomer
[47:50] supply hit the market all at once.
[47:54] Everyone thinks when rates go down,
[47:55] prices will go back up. It's the
[47:57] opposite this time. A lot of supply is
[47:59] going to hit the market all at one time,
[48:02] and it's going to overwhelm the amount
[48:04] of buyers, which is going to put them in
[48:06] the driver's seat. Uh, which is
[48:10] well, anyway, that's that. Uh, this 27
[48:13] billion home builder says the feds are
[48:16] cooking up something big to address
[48:19] housing market affordability.
[48:22] Home builders are in discussions with
[48:23] the Trump administration. Uh he says,
[48:26] "Do I think something will come out of
[48:28] 2026? I'd be surprised if something
[48:30] isn't done. Whether that's portability
[48:32] of the mortgages, opening up federal
[48:34] land to build, a lot of options in the
[48:37] tank." Stanley Black & Decker's 1.8
[48:40] billion aerospace unit sale will ease
[48:43] debt load. What we look for in
[48:45] turnarounds besides solveny risk, we do
[48:47] the balance sheet first. We do catalyst.
[48:49] We look at the jockey. Often there's a
[48:52] new jockey. Uh and then we look at their
[48:54] outs. If for then anyone that plays
[48:56] poker, uh we always look for outs. And
[48:59] in the case of VF Corp, they had a lot
[49:01] of outs. They were able to sell Supreme,
[49:03] pay down debt. They were able to sell
[49:05] Dickies, pay down debt. Now they're in
[49:07] growth mode. Uh same thing with Stanley
[49:10] Black & Decker. They sold their $ 1.8
[49:13] billion aerospace unit. Now they are a
[49:16] lean mean fighting machine with massive
[49:18] operating leverage to ride the housing
[49:20] building recovery wave. Mergers and
[49:23] acquisitions soared this year that could
[49:25] make 2026 even bigger. Animal spirits
[49:28] are back. Small cap stocks are winners.
[49:30] Let the good times keep rolling. That's
[49:32] from Jacob Sonenshine. You heard it here
[49:34] first. We've been pounding the table on
[49:36] that theme and now it's playing out.
[49:38] Article of the week, setting up the
[49:40] second act stock market and sentiment
[49:42] results. We went through the media.
[49:43] We're going to talk Fizer which is a new
[49:46] newish position uh we bought uh in the
[49:49] past couple of months on weakness.
[49:52] You can see here free cash flow
[49:54] reacelerating revenues reacelerating
[49:57] margins reacelerating
[49:59] and so on. You see sales per share
[50:02] growing, cash flow per share growing,
[50:03] earnings per share growing, dividends
[50:06] per share continue to grow. You got a 7%
[50:08] yield right now alone. Get paid while
[50:11] you wait. uh margins are growing and
[50:15] share count uh is static, which is okay.
[50:18] They'll start buying back as thing cash
[50:21] flow continues to ramp up. Um or they
[50:25] can't find out external investments that
[50:27] give them a higher um return on invested
[50:31] capital than the inverse of uh call it 8
[50:34] times earnings. So 1 divided by 8
[50:38] and you got yourself an
[50:42] one divide by
[50:44] 8 a 12.5% earnings yield. So they need
[50:48] to find investments that yield greater
[50:50] than that which they're finding all day
[50:52] long in the CGEN in the meta uh as you
[50:56] look at the long-term results. So
[50:58] healthcare uh uh fizer is a name that
[51:02] comes came across our desk many times
[51:05] over the years and we recently pulled
[51:06] the trigger building a nice size
[51:08] position on weakness. Uh for those of
[51:11] you who've been on the last few
[51:12] podcasts, you know it's a unique or
[51:16] clients looking in their account, you
[51:17] know, we positioned uniquely in this
[51:20] position. Uh unlike anything we've done
[51:22] before, uh so that we can make a
[51:25] multibagger
[51:27] even if the stock itself is not a
[51:30] double, we can make four, fivex on our
[51:33] money. uh we've positioned that uniquely
[51:35] because of uh the Black Shoes model on
[51:38] um some of the instruments we're using
[51:41] to express that uh that positioning and
[51:43] we're we're very excited about. So we
[51:45] first laid out our thesis publicly on
[51:47] Fox Business December 4th along with
[51:50] several other media appearances that
[51:51] same week. We expanded on the the you
[51:54] can watch it there. We expanded on the
[51:55] thesis at a more granular level at the
[51:57] money show in Sarasota where we
[51:59] presented the full Fiser investment case
[52:02] see below presentation uh and the times
[52:05] are here 2357 to 33.
[52:08] Uh you can find that on my YouTube
[52:10] channel or just go to hedge funips.com
[52:13] and click on the article setting up the
[52:15] second act. While you're at hedge
[52:16] fun.com, click on terms. This is all
[52:18] opinion not advice. Consult your psychic
[52:21] before doing anything else. And um uh
[52:25] that's that
[52:28] this was a good presentation. You should
[52:29] check it out if you want an outlook of
[52:31] the whole 2026. Healthcare has been an
[52:33] area the market we've kept a close eye
[52:35] on and one where we've been looking to
[52:37] add additional exposure alongside our
[52:39] existing holding in Baxter
[52:40] International. And now we've got a third
[52:41] one which we announced uh that um we
[52:44] have and clients have been able to take
[52:46] advantage of and new clients who've come
[52:47] in early to take advantage since we
[52:50] opened last week for our quarterly
[52:51] openings for the small accounts of 1
[52:54] million plus and uh intraquarter for the
[52:57] large accounts of 5 million plus. Uh you
[53:00] guys all have it. Uh the sector has
[53:02] become one of the most dislocated
[53:04] sectors of the market battered by policy
[53:06] and regulatory headwinds and driven into
[53:09] three straight years of
[53:10] underperformance. This resulted in a 51
[53:12] point cumulative lag behind the broader
[53:15] market making it the worst stretch on
[53:17] record. We love those environments. The
[53:20] ensuing forced selling and rush for the
[53:23] exits pushed the sector's waiting to
[53:25] under 9%. A sharp retreat from over 15%
[53:28] in 2022 and reminiscent of levels not
[53:31] seen since the early 2000s. A setup that
[53:34] preceded a multi-year stretch of
[53:36] outperformance. Ladies and gentlemen,
[53:39] this shoot first ask questions later
[53:41] environment left a long list of
[53:42] high-quality healthcare companies on the
[53:44] clearance rack. We quickly quickly
[53:46] rolled up our sleeves and started
[53:48] digging through the rubble in search of
[53:49] a pony in the pile. What made the setup
[53:52] even more compelling was the backdrop of
[53:54] a midterm election year notorious for
[53:56] elevated volatility. Such conditions
[53:58] played directly into the strengths of
[54:00] resilience, durable demand sectors like
[54:02] healthcare, which has a consistent track
[54:04] record as a top performer in midterm
[54:07] cycles. In fact, the sector has
[54:08] outperformed in 11 of the last 13
[54:11] midterm years, posting average annual
[54:13] returns of 9.03% and dwarfing the
[54:16] broader market's modest 62 basis points
[54:19] of returns. With that framework in mind
[54:21] and a willingness to lean against the
[54:24] prevailing narrative, we went hunting
[54:27] within the sector and eventually zeroed
[54:29] in on a name offering asymmetric upside
[54:32] while trading at life support
[54:33] valuations. That name was Fizer, founded
[54:35] in 1849.
[54:37] Fiser stands alone as one of the world's
[54:39] greatest as one of the world's largest
[54:42] pharmaceutical companies with a broad
[54:44] portfolio spanning vaccines, oncology,
[54:46] and immunology immunology. If you think
[54:48] this is the first time fizer has found
[54:51] itself in the gutter over its 176-year
[54:54] operating history, think again. Through
[54:57] wars, depressions, and countless cycles,
[54:59] this company has seen it all and
[55:01] consistently emerged stronger on the
[55:03] other side. Today, Fizer markets nine
[55:06] blockbuster products led by Elicus and
[55:08] the Prevnar family and delivered the top
[55:11] selling COVID vaccine uh comati
[55:17] and oral treatment paxid during the
[55:20] pandemic. The stock remains down more
[55:22] than 60% from its COVID era highs when
[55:25] the company was effectively king of the
[55:26] world and its twin COVID franchise
[55:28] generated 90 billion in supplemental
[55:31] revenue and $40 billion in incremental
[55:34] free cash flow in 2021 and 2022 alone.
[55:36] That windfall faded much faster than
[55:38] management or the market anticipated by
[55:40] 2023. Revenues had fallen more than 40%
[55:43] forcing large inventory and intangible
[55:46] write downs and sending adjusted EPS
[55:48] down 72%. The resulting COVID volatility
[55:51] and uncertainty created a massive
[55:53] overhang on the stock. One we believe is
[55:55] now firmly in the rearview mirror. The
[55:56] core business has stabilized in the low
[55:59] $60 billion revenue range with earnings
[56:01] power recovered to a solid $3 plus
[56:04] baseline
[56:06] and COVID products representing just 8%
[56:08] of sales a fraction of the 57% peak in
[56:12] 2022.
[56:14] Despite this stabilization, the market
[56:16] continues to fixate on the lingering
[56:18] COVID shadow and the impending patent
[56:21] cliff with key blockbusters IBRs Eloquis
[56:25] uh Xandandy and Prevnar facing loss of
[56:28] exclusivity between 2026 and 2028
[56:32] putting 17 billion in annual revenue at
[56:34] risk. We believe this pessimism
[56:38] is far overdone and overlooks the heavy
[56:41] lifting management has already delivered
[56:43] to rightsize the business and offset
[56:44] these headwinds.
[56:46] Fiser launched a $7.2 billion cost
[56:49] savings program aimed at restoring
[56:51] operating margins to prepandemic levels
[56:53] while reinvesting $500 million to
[56:55] strengthen R&D productivity. Management
[56:57] has executed aggressively, already
[56:59] delivering $5.1 billion in savings and
[57:02] putting the company on track to achieve
[57:04] the full 7.2 billion by 2026, a full
[57:07] year ahead of schedule. More telling,
[57:10] rather than relying solely on cost cuts
[57:12] to offset patent expirations, management
[57:14] went on offense with the COVID cash,
[57:17] going shopping for the next generation
[57:19] of growth drivers. The $43 billion CGEN
[57:21] deal added four approved cancer drugs
[57:24] and a leading oncology pipeline that
[57:26] management expects to scale from 2
[57:28] billion in revenue to more than 10
[57:30] billion by 2030 most recently. And just
[57:33] when Fizer appeared out of the GLP1
[57:35] race, the 10 billion Metsera acquisition
[57:38] puts the company back in the center of
[57:40] the hundred billion plus obesity market
[57:44] with a differentiated once monthly
[57:46] platform targeting a 2028 launch and
[57:49] delivering $5 billion plus in peak
[57:51] annual sales potential.
[57:54] Combined with earlier boltzons like
[57:56] Arena, Biohaven, GBT and the licensing
[57:59] deal with 3S Bio, Fiser is well
[58:02] positioned to offset loss of exclusivity
[58:04] pressures and return to growth later
[58:06] this decade. Sometime we believe the
[58:08] market continue something we believe the
[58:10] market continues to materially
[58:12] underappreciate.
[58:14] Just at at just eight times earnings,
[58:17] the market is giving Fizer zero credit
[58:20] for anything going right, making it one
[58:22] of the cheapest large cap pharma names
[58:24] on offer. If management is even
[58:26] halfright on the road map, we see a
[58:28] clear path to a double over the next few
[58:30] years. If the full vision plays out and
[58:32] healthcare sentiment finds its way out
[58:34] of the doldrums, the upside is
[58:36] meaningfully higher. In the meantime,
[58:38] investors get paid a nearly 7% dividend
[58:42] yield to weight, more than four times
[58:44] the sector average, and backed by an
[58:46] 86year-old
[58:48] payment history.
[58:51] 86 years of dividend payment history.
[58:54] The dividend is supported by a strong
[58:56] balance sheet with $15 billion of cash
[58:58] and cash equivalents and more than 10
[59:00] billion of annual free cash flow
[59:03] generation. I love free cash flow
[59:07] generation. This life support valuation
[59:10] combined with an attractive dividend
[59:11] yield sets a firm floor and offers
[59:13] meaningfully meaningful downside
[59:15] protection. Meanwhile, the bar for
[59:17] positive surprises remains ex
[59:19] exceptionally low as the market price is
[59:22] in virtually no good news. As execution
[59:25] progresses and new growth engines begin
[59:27] to show through, we expect sentiment to
[59:29] turn and quickly. Until then, we are
[59:32] happy to sit tight, collect the
[59:33] dividend, and wait for this iconic
[59:35] American blue chip to reclaim its former
[59:38] glory. Earlier this month, management
[59:40] hosted an analyst and investor call to
[59:42] walk through 2026 guidance, recent
[59:45] acquisitions, and the long-term path
[59:48] back to growth. Here are the key
[59:50] takeaways
[59:53] highlighted and underlined. And here are
[59:55] the 10 key points. management fully
[59:57] reaffirmed its full year 2025 and
[01:00:00] adjusted EPS guidance of 3 to 315 and
[01:00:02] noted results are currently tracking
[01:00:04] toward the top end of the range. Fully
[01:00:07] year revenue guidance was narrowed to 62
[01:00:09] billion consistent with the prior 61
[01:00:11] to64 billion range two. Looking ahead to
[01:00:14] 2026, management expects revenue of 59.5
[01:00:17] billion to 62.5 broadly in line with
[01:00:20] expectations including 4% operational
[01:00:22] growth at the midpoint excluding COVID
[01:00:24] and loss of LOE. Ex adjusted EPS is
[01:00:28] guided to 280 to $3 modestly below
[01:00:30] street estimate of 305 as several
[01:00:32] headwinds weigh on results. These
[01:00:34] include 22 cents of dilution from the 3S
[01:00:36] bio and metsera deals, a $ 1.5 billion
[01:00:40] in decline in COVID revenue,
[01:00:42] representing 18% EPS headwind, 1.5
[01:00:46] billion of patent expirations, and a
[01:00:48] higher tax rate rising to 15% from 11%,
[01:00:52] a 12 cents headwind. Three, the Metsera
[01:00:55] acquisition is gaining traction with
[01:00:57] management guiding to at least 15
[01:00:59] obesity drug trials in 2026, the
[01:01:02] majority in phase three. The first MSEA
[01:01:04] product remains targeted for a 2028
[01:01:07] launch with meaningful contributions
[01:01:09] expected in the years that follow.
[01:01:11] management also believes it now has the
[01:01:13] most advanced GIPR oral candidate in the
[01:01:16] industry which it views as a significant
[01:01:19] opportunity to address the masses with
[01:01:21] the only key monthly clo do dosing data
[01:01:24] with the key monthly dosing data
[01:01:27] expected in Q1 four management cut 2025
[01:01:31] CO 19 sales expectations to 6.5 billion
[01:01:34] from 9 billion as global infection rates
[01:01:37] remain muted co revenue is expected to
[01:01:39] decline further to 5 billion in 2026,
[01:01:42] representing just 8.2% of total sales
[01:01:45] versus 57% in 2022 as Fizer continues to
[01:01:49] exit the COVID driven error. Five, Fiser
[01:01:51] expects 17 billion in annual revenue
[01:01:53] impact from the loss of exclusivity by
[01:01:56] 2030 relative to 2025 with a 1.5 billion
[01:02:00] LOE headwind anticipated in 2026.
[01:02:03] Management remains confident that the
[01:02:04] internal pipeline along with acquisition
[01:02:06] of Biohaven, CGN, and Metera and the
[01:02:09] licensing agreement with 3S Bio
[01:02:11] positions the company well for 2029 and
[01:02:13] beyond to be strong growth years. By the
[01:02:16] end of 2025, the portfolio recent of
[01:02:18] recently launched and acquired products
[01:02:20] is expected to generate 10 billion in
[01:02:22] revenue growing at double-digit rates
[01:02:24] with growth expected to accelerate into
[01:02:26] the latter part of the decade and help
[01:02:27] offset patent expiration headwind. Six.
[01:02:30] The cost realignment program is now on
[01:02:32] track to deliver the majority of the 7.2
[01:02:34] billion in total net cost savings by
[01:02:37] 2026, a full year ahead of prior
[01:02:39] expectations with 500 million rate
[01:02:41] reinvested to strengthen R&D
[01:02:43] productivity. 7 2026
[01:02:46] uh um
[01:02:49] uh
[01:02:53] sales SI SINA expenses are expected to
[01:02:57] be 12.5 billion to 13.5 billion down
[01:03:00] from 13.1 billion to 14
[01:03:04] SGNA expenses by the way okay are
[01:03:07] expected to be 12.5 to 13.5 down from
[01:03:10] 13.1 to 14.1 representing a 4%
[01:03:13] year-on-year decline as cost savings
[01:03:14] continue to materialize. This is
[01:03:16] expected to support the stable gross and
[01:03:18] operating margins for the year with
[01:03:19] adjusted gross margins projected in the
[01:03:21] mid 70% range and management seeing a
[01:03:24] clear path to consistently returning to
[01:03:26] the mid to high 70% range over time.
[01:03:31] Eight, Fiser expects robust operating
[01:03:34] cash flow in 2026 with the bulk of cash
[01:03:37] restructuring payments now behind the
[01:03:39] company and the final 2.6 6 billion
[01:03:42] repatriation tax payment occurring in
[01:03:44] 2026 with capex expected to be slightly
[01:03:47] above 3 billion for the year. This sets
[01:03:49] up solid free cash flow generation on a
[01:03:51] go forward basis. Nine management
[01:03:53] reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining
[01:03:55] and growing the dividend over time with
[01:03:56] the current quarterly dividend at 43 per
[01:04:00] share and the forward dividend yield now
[01:04:03] close to 7%.
[01:04:05] 10 management expects to exit the year
[01:04:07] with gross leverage slightly above the
[01:04:09] 2.7 times which is expected to remain
[01:04:12] relatively stable through the LOE
[01:04:14] period. Entering 2026, Fizer retains 6
[01:04:18] billion of business development
[01:04:20] capacity.
[01:04:22] We've highlighted all the key things in
[01:04:24] the earnings call and now we're going on
[01:04:27] to
[01:04:29] Albamaro.
[01:04:31] Uh note we have taken profits on a
[01:04:35] portion of this position as it is now up
[01:04:38] 139% or 2.4x
[01:04:42] off our blended basis of 6129 in a very
[01:04:46] short period of time. This is much
[01:04:48] faster than we expected. It remains a
[01:04:51] core position, but we don't want to be
[01:04:54] pigs, so we're taking some profits. Um,
[01:04:58] so here are the key things we've
[01:05:00] highlighted and underlined for you. Uh,
[01:05:02] 10 key points. Number one, revenue of
[01:05:05] 1.31 billion declined 3.5% year-on-year,
[01:05:08] but beat consensus by 28 million as 8%
[01:05:12] volume growth in both energy storage and
[01:05:15] ketchin was more than offset by price
[01:05:17] declines of 16% and 5% respectively.
[01:05:20] Adjusted loss per share of 19 cents beat
[01:05:23] street estimates by 69 cents and
[01:05:25] improved 88% from the 155 loss last
[01:05:28] year. Two, despite lower lithium prices
[01:05:31] in Q3, management made meaningful
[01:05:32] progress on profitability with adjusted
[01:05:34] EVID of 226 million up 7% yearonear and
[01:05:39] margins improving 170 basis points to
[01:05:41] 17.3 based on cost removed from the
[01:05:44] business and recovering lithium prices.
[01:05:45] management expects operating leverage
[01:05:47] could eventually push adjusted ebida
[01:05:48] margins above 30% uh $15 per kg LCE. For
[01:05:54] context, lithium prices are now over $14
[01:05:58] kilogram LCE, knocking on the door of
[01:06:01] management's target. Again, while this
[01:06:02] may seem like a big move from summer
[01:06:04] lows, it pays to zoom out. We are still
[01:06:06] in early days as it relates to lithium
[01:06:08] prices, which is why it remains a core
[01:06:11] position. Three, global lithium ion
[01:06:13] battery demand for stationary storage
[01:06:14] jumped 105% year-to- date, led by North
[01:06:17] America and Europe at 145% each and
[01:06:20] China at 60%. The market has been a
[01:06:23] major upside surprise for management
[01:06:25] with demand exceeding expectations and
[01:06:27] slower than expected supply growth
[01:06:29] tightening the market. Lithium demand
[01:06:31] for energy storage seems systems is now
[01:06:33] expected to increase more than 2.5x to a
[01:06:36] range of 430 to 1 1070 KTLCE by 2030
[01:06:42] from 200
[01:06:44] in 2024 implying a 15 to 30% kagger and
[01:06:48] potentially reaching half of total
[01:06:50] lithium demand four despite the noise
[01:06:53] global EV demand remains strong growing
[01:06:55] 30% year to date this mostly China
[01:06:57] continues to represent 60% of the global
[01:06:59] EV V market maintaining strong demand
[01:07:01] even after suppressing surpassing 50%
[01:07:04] market penetration. Europe accounts for
[01:07:06] 20% of the market with 31% growth while
[01:07:08] the US makes up just 10% of the market
[01:07:10] with 12% growth. Global EV demand still
[01:07:12] drives over 70% of lithium demand and
[01:07:15] management expects the market to remain
[01:07:17] healthy with continued growth ahead.
[01:07:19] Five operating cash flow came in at 356
[01:07:22] million in Q3, up 57% year-on-year,
[01:07:25] bringing year-to- date operating cash
[01:07:27] flow to 949, up 29%. Management
[01:07:30] continues to expect fullear operating
[01:07:31] cash flow conversion above 80% well
[01:07:33] above the long-term target of 60 70%. Uh
[01:07:37] driven by 350 million of customer
[01:07:39] prepayment earlier in the year and
[01:07:41] ongoing working capital improvements.
[01:07:42] Most importantly, management now expects
[01:07:44] to generate 300 to 400 million in free
[01:07:46] cash flow for the full year compared to
[01:07:48] the the year's original expectation of
[01:07:51] break even and last quarter's call for
[01:07:53] just positive. Six management announced
[01:07:56] agreements to sell its controlling 51%
[01:07:58] stake in Ketchin's refining catalyst
[01:08:01] solutions business and Ketchin's
[01:08:02] interest in the Euroat joint venture
[01:08:05] from combined pre-tax proceeds of 660
[01:08:07] million. Both transactions are expected
[01:08:09] to close in the first half of 2026 with
[01:08:11] proceeds supporting further balance
[01:08:13] sheet deleveraging 7.
[01:08:16] Albamaro further lowered fullear capex
[01:08:18] expectations to 600 million, a 65%
[01:08:21] decline from last year's 1.7 billion and
[01:08:24] exceeding the original plan for 50%
[01:08:26] reduction. As management focuses on
[01:08:27] projects with the highest returns on
[01:08:29] capital and fastest paybacks, looking to
[01:08:32] 2026, management sees a further 10%
[01:08:34] decline as reasonable, emphasizing that
[01:08:37] current capex remain maintains assets
[01:08:40] and reflects efficiency gains rather
[01:08:42] than underinvestment. Eight, management
[01:08:44] continues to strengthen the balance
[01:08:45] sheet with 1.9 billion in cash and cash
[01:08:48] equivalents and total liquidity of 3.5
[01:08:50] billion. Total debt stood at 3.6 billion
[01:08:52] fully fixed at a weighted average rate
[01:08:54] of 3.6% 6% resulting in net debt to
[01:08:56] adjusted Ebidov just 2.1 times.
[01:08:59] Following the catch-in transactions and
[01:09:01] the Q4 debt repayment of 440 million
[01:09:03] near-term cash is expected to reach $2
[01:09:05] billion. Nine management is now on track
[01:09:08] to deliver fullear run rate cost and
[01:09:10] productivity improvements of 450 million
[01:09:12] above the initial target of 300 to 400
[01:09:14] million with sales, administrative and
[01:09:16] R&D expenses now down 166 million or 22%
[01:09:20] year-to date. and 10 management now
[01:09:22] expects the fullear outlook to land at
[01:09:24] the higher end of the previously
[01:09:26] published 9 uh dollars per kg scenario
[01:09:29] which called for sales of 4.9 to 5.2
[01:09:32] billion and adjusted IBIDA of 800
[01:09:34] million to a billion driven by stronger
[01:09:35] lithium pricing and fullear volumes
[01:09:37] expected to exceed 10%. Keep in mind
[01:09:39] this guidance was issued in early
[01:09:41] November when prices were still below
[01:09:43] 11.5 kg suggesting meaningful upside to
[01:09:47] those numbers based on today's prices.
[01:09:49] Here's the earnings call highlighted.
[01:09:50] You can read it at the website
[01:09:52] hedgefundtips.com.
[01:09:54] And now on to the
[01:09:59] market. By the way,
[01:10:03] Morning Star has a $200 per share fair
[01:10:06] value estimate. Uh and uh and we think
[01:10:10] it can work its way up there over time.
[01:10:12] Not at the same pace that it's uh uh
[01:10:15] 2.4xed 4xed uh but um but certainly
[01:10:19] grind higher over time which we love and
[01:10:21] why it continues to remain a core
[01:10:24] position. Uh beer and greed is neutral
[01:10:28] for the market and congratulations to
[01:10:31] all the new clients that came in
[01:10:32] intraquarter Q4 with the larger sized

[01:11:35] quarterly openings like the smaller
[01:11:37] accounts. Not a solicitation,
[01:11:39] opinion, not advice. Consult a psychic
[01:11:42] before doing anything. Defense and
[01:11:44] aerospace earnings estimates and
[01:11:45] revisions. Top 30 weights. In the last
[01:11:48] 60 days, their earnings have been
[01:11:49] revised down by six basis points. So
[01:11:51] basically flat. Energy top 30 weights.
[01:11:54] Last 60 days revised up 23 basis points.
[01:11:57] Economic data has been better than
[01:11:59] expected this week. Uh even on the jobs
[01:12:01] front, estimates for earnings next year
[01:12:04] are still $39.
[01:12:07] Uh which has come up quite a bit since
[01:12:09] the summer. And now we're going on to
[01:12:12] many people's favorite part of the week,
[01:12:14] which is the ask me anything questions.
[01:12:17] For those of you who don't like the ask
[01:12:18] me anything questions, thanks for
[01:12:19] joining. Merry Christmas. For those of
[01:12:21] you who do, uh here we go. Our first
[01:12:24] question comes in from Ron Burgundy. Uh,
[01:12:27] sounds like uh someone from uh I forget
[01:12:30] what movie that was with Will Ferrell,
[01:12:32] but okay, Ron. Selinies. I don't know.
[01:12:34] Do we cover this one every week or every
[01:12:36] other week? Um, we continue to look at
[01:12:38] it. And what we continue to say is we
[01:12:42] like it, but that it's not without risk.
[01:12:45] They got balance sheet risk. If it
[01:12:47] works, you're going to be up 5x. Excuse
[01:12:50] me, not 5x. If it works, you're going to
[01:12:52] get yourself a triple. And uh I think
[01:12:56] you're going to be fine with this one.
[01:12:57] We'd love We would like to get more
[01:13:00] exposure to materials, but there are
[01:13:02] only so many positions we can have in
[01:13:04] the portfolio. Let's take a look at the
[01:13:06] balance sheet.
[01:13:08] 140 million of cash. You got 1.6 billion
[01:13:11] of receivables, and you got 11 billion
[01:13:14] of debt. So, you got to really know when
[01:13:16] that debt is coming due. I think they're
[01:13:18] going to figure it out. I think this
[01:13:20] cycle is going to change. a billion
[01:13:21] dollars of free cash flow. They'll
[01:13:23] figure it out. Let's look at the income
[01:13:25] statement if they did anything stupid
[01:13:26] raising equity. And the answer is
[01:13:37] uh
[01:13:40] no, they're bringing down the share
[01:13:41] count modestly. So, we like that. I
[01:13:44] think you're going to be okay here. We
[01:13:45] like the idea. Way to go, Ron Burgundy.
[01:13:48] On to the next. J El
[01:13:52] okay wants to
[01:13:56] know about Goose
[01:14:00] and Jay says they're burning cash. Well
[01:14:03] Jay, your numbers are wrong. They
[01:14:04] continue to generate record free cash
[01:14:06] flow, record revenues, stock is still
[01:14:09] down even though it's had a huge move
[01:14:11] off the lows and off of our basis. It's
[01:14:13] just getting started. So um check
[01:14:16] yourself before you wreck yourself. go
[01:14:18] directly to the SEC filings uh if you
[01:14:21] don't have Koi Fin that pulls directly
[01:14:23] from the SEC filings and uh go from
[01:14:25] there. Barry Kimbro, what's your
[01:14:27] thoughts on Align Tech? We don't like
[01:14:30] Align Tech, but we do like the space and
[01:14:35] uh we are
[01:14:38] going to leave that there. Line is not
[01:14:40] for us. It could work, but we have no
[01:14:42] edge there. Manny B Conmed, CNMD. I
[01:14:46] think we covered this a couple weeks
[01:14:48] ago.
[01:14:51] Uh, and I think we said okay.
[01:14:55] Let's just double check that.
[01:15:00] Yeah, I think you'll be okay there.
[01:15:02] Next, Jack Law Comber,
[01:15:07] uh, Dublin, Ireland. How you doing,
[01:15:08] Jack? WDFC.
[01:15:12] What is that? WD40.
[01:15:23] It's okay, but there are higher and
[01:15:24] better uses of your cash. Uh you're
[01:15:26] certainly not going to get a double off
[01:15:28] of it. And um
[01:15:30] you know, with declining revenues, well,
[01:15:33] no, revenues are okay. I just think it's
[01:15:35] rich. I I I wouldn't be a buyer here,
[01:15:37] but I don't think you're going to get
[01:15:38] hurt. Harry G. Bristol Meyers.
[01:15:43] It definitely clicks the healthc care
[01:15:45] box. This one's not for me, but um I
[01:15:47] think it's going to work with the whole
[01:15:48] sector. It's been flat. I think it's
[01:15:51] probably on its way to do better things
[01:15:53] than it's been doing for the last five
[01:15:55] plus years. So, I would say okay, but
[01:15:59] Fizer's better in terms of multiples you
[01:16:01] can get, depending how you express it.
[01:16:03] Jason M, uh Jason M, uh we're going to
[01:16:07] get back to you on that one. We can't
[01:16:09] talk about it now. You can interpret it
[01:16:11] that as you will. Tom, merry Christmas.
[01:16:14] Nike,
[01:16:16] uh, we like Nike. We like the
[01:16:18] turnaround. As a matter of fact, one of
[01:16:19] their directors,
[01:16:21] um, named Tim Apple, aka Tim Cook,
[01:16:25] bought a ton of stock, or not a ton, he
[01:16:27] bought $3 million of stock. And, uh, I
[01:16:31] think this one's going to work. I think
[01:16:32] it's going to take longer than everyone
[01:16:33] thinks. And I think VF Corp is a better
[01:16:35] bang for your buck because you're going
[01:16:36] to get a higher multiples. You know,
[01:16:39] when Nike recovers, you get a double.
[01:16:41] When VF recovers from our basis, you get
[01:16:45] three to five bags. And we like three to
[01:16:47] five bags that better than a double. So,
[01:16:50] uh, BHC, this is from Max M.
[01:16:56] BHC. Is this this, uh,
[01:17:00] yeah, it's B. This is a value trap. It's
[01:17:02] probably going to work. I mean, there
[01:17:04] all these guys pulse in. They've been in
[01:17:06] it forever and they continue to it's
[01:17:11] been a bad use of capital.
[01:17:13] Uh I just don't see the growth. It's
[01:17:16] okay. This is this is a value trap.
[01:17:18] That's not what we do. It could work,
[01:17:20] but I don't think it's going to be
[01:17:21] great. Uh, Wabash National WNC.
[01:17:31] Uh, revenues declining, cash flow
[01:17:34] declining. WNC.
[01:17:40] Yeah. I mean, but you're probably going
[01:17:41] to wind up with a double on this one.
[01:17:44] Let's just take a look at the balance
[01:17:45] sheet.
[01:17:47] Engineered solutions for logistics.
[01:17:49] Well, logistics is going up. We know
[01:17:51] that from our position with GXO.
[01:17:55] Let's just see if they're going to make
[01:17:57] stay in business until the cycle turn.
[01:18:00] So, this is an issue. They got 91
[01:18:02] million of cash and 160 million of
[01:18:05] receivables on
[01:18:09] $400 million of debt. That's not bad. Uh
[01:18:13] let's see what their cash flow is doing
[01:18:15] here.
[01:18:17] Yeah, they're going to live 100 million
[01:18:19] of cash. Let's take a look at their
[01:18:22] income statement
[01:18:29] bringing down the share count. I think
[01:18:31] you're okay there. Next, Kim Arnold,
[01:18:35] Amphasar Pharmaceuticals.
[01:18:40] Uh
[01:18:48] when we get to smaller companies,
[01:18:53] uh I tend to not do individual stocks
[01:18:58] because I have no edge on the drug
[01:19:00] approval. We're generalists.
[01:19:02] So I would say it's not for me. Next,
[01:19:07] Christian D.
[01:19:09] What's your opinion on Howard Hughes?
[01:19:12] Uh, they'll benefit from the housing
[01:19:14] recovery. This is a Aman's new vehicle.
[01:19:18] Um, not for me. Next, Brian Mlan.
[01:19:23] Uh,
[01:19:30] now New is a bag of bag of you know what
[01:19:33] I it's it'll work for bounds, but it's
[01:19:35] just been so mismanaged. Uh, Ricardo at
[01:19:38] Goto,
[01:19:39] first time caller, Goodyear tire. The
[01:19:42] answer is no. There's too much
[01:19:43] competition from the Koreans and the
[01:19:46] Japanese. And the other thing is this is
[01:19:48] going to work for a bounce and it's
[01:19:50] going to be fine in the short term. It's
[01:19:52] just such a crap business and it's just
[01:19:54] burning too much cash. Revenues are no
[01:19:56] showing no sign of recovery. So, it's a
[01:19:58] trade and a gamble, not an investment.
[01:20:01] VNOM, this is a lower quality energy
[01:20:04] producer. Uh, I think energy is going to
[01:20:07] play well in 2026. There's no way I'm
[01:20:10] buying it up here. So, hard pass. Jack
[01:20:13] G.
[01:20:14] Um,
[01:20:16] Jack, we covered that in the article of
[01:20:18] the week. What's causing that for next
[01:20:20] year and why are we not concerned? This
[01:20:23] is a new investor inquiry. Uh, just uh
[01:20:27] Greg's UK,
[01:20:30] Gre G.
[01:20:34] This is a Dunkin Donuts
[01:20:41] of the UK. Let's take a look at it.
[01:20:45] Negative free cash flow. Revenues are
[01:20:47] growing.
[01:20:50] Let's take a look at the balance sheet.
[01:20:59] $45 million of cash.
[01:21:02] How much debt?
[01:21:04] half a billion. I I wouldn't do this
[01:21:06] one. I I like it looks like it wants to
[01:21:08] bounce and maybe you'll get a double,
[01:21:09] but they're better uses of your money.
[01:21:11] Uh, another investor inquiry. Sim Simmon
[01:21:16] Simon Bu, we own it from much lower
[01:21:18] levels.
[01:21:21] Um, another investor
[01:21:26] and SM Energy from Sagar Kaneka.
[01:21:32] SM another energy company. We like that
[01:21:35] theme. Um
[01:21:38] I don't think this has come down enough
[01:21:40] relative to the price of energy. There
[01:21:41] are better energy plays like we like
[01:21:44] comtock which yes it's up almost triple
[01:21:46] from where we bought it but it's going
[01:21:47] higher. Uh national oil well Varco is
[01:21:50] only up 40 50% from where we bought it.
[01:21:53] That's going to be a multibagger even
[01:21:54] from these levels. I would play it that
[01:21:56] way. These EMP names I don't think have
[01:21:58] come down enough relative to the price.
[01:22:01] Plus, this one's burning a ton of cash.
[01:22:02] So, hard pass. Uh, and that's that. With
[01:22:06] that said, we'll see everyone next week.
[01:22:09] Um, we'll I don't know which day, but it
[01:22:12] will be same place uh either Wednesday
[01:22:15] or Thursday. In the meantime, make it a
[01:22:18] great one. Merry Christmas and bye for
[01:22:22] now.
[01:22:26] Heat. Heat.
[01:22:48] Heat.
[01:23:09] Hey, heat. Hey, heat.
