  "executive_summary": "Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on healthcare, small caps, and AI beneficiaries in 2026. He believes the market is underestimating the potential for economic growth due to combined fiscal and monetary stimulus. He is rotating out of crowded AI cost centers (hyperscalers) and into AI beneficiaries, dividend payers, and undervalued sectors like healthcare. He sees a generational buying opportunity in healthcare and expects small caps to outperform large caps. He is also positive on housing and energy. He is buying PayPal aggressively.",
