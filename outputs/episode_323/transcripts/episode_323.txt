Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 323rd videocast podcast for the week ending December 24th, 2025. Happy Christmas Eve. Merry Christmas to everyone who's celebrating tomorrow. We got a lot of great stuff to cover today. So, we're going to get right down to it. But, as always, family first. want to thank our friends Jim and Parvina for having us on their incredible uh party for the boat parade we got to watch. Uh very very grateful. We had such an amazing time. There's Annabelle, Mimi, Caitlyn. Uh what a fun time. There's uh Annabelle out by the ocean with a a bird there. Uh more from the party. There's Annabelle in front of the Christmas tree. Uh, Zack made a incredible Christmas card here for hedge fund tips. Uh, more Christmas stuff with my Grinch Christmas sweater. Uh, that was a fun day. And that's that. Uh, h here's a picture with beautiful Caitlyn uh at the party. You can see some of the boat parade. Uh, Orange County is like nothing else uh in Connecticut. Uh, it's a lot different than snow. They have all the boats decorated up and uh driving around the harbor, which was just incredible. There's Mimi and Annabelle. Uh this is They do drones in the air. There's Santa on a surfboard, total California style. Ah, there he is. Uh drones with Santa on a sleigh. And you can get a sense of all these boats passing by in the harbor with their lights on. That's me and Mimi. What a what an incredible night. Um, and absolutely a tremendous amount of fun. Very grateful for that. Quote of the week. Uh, we have, "In the world of business, the people who are the most successful are doing what they love." That's from Warren Buffett. And the second quote from Peter Lynch, know what you own and know why you own it. These are two of the legends. I never feel like I've worked a day in this business. I absolutely love this and I try to uh impart that on on our incredible listeners here and our philosophy certainly is knowing what we own and why we own it which is why we can sit through the short-term volatility until the turnarounds take place uh and do it over and over and over again uh which is which is really great. And now I want to get down to some media. First and foremost, I would like to thank Payton Payton Jennings and Ash Webster for having me on Fox Business this morning on Christmas Eve to talk markets and outlook and AI and more. We're going to listen in here. >> Working Thomas Hayes joins us now. Uh Thomas, let's start with this. What's the biggest expected AI surprise do you think in 2026? >> Well, Ash, good to be with you. I think even bigger surprise was what happened in 2025 with Intel being the number one performing AI stock. It outperformed Nvidia twice the returns. Nvidia up 36% uh as of yesterday. Intel up 81%. Now moving into 2026, I think the biggest surprise is the AI beneficiaries are going to outperform the AI cost centers. What does that mean? The beneficiaries are regular businesses, main street businesses, the unmnificent 493 components of the S&P 500 that will be implementing AI to lower cost, increase productivity. The underperformers are going to be the AI cost centers which is are the hyperscalers that are doing all the capex right now. Capex as a percentage of operating cash flow for the hyperscalers uh mag 7 etc is over 60%. There's only one other industry that has capex that high that is big oil and that's why you're seeing some retreat uh market getting a little bit worried about return on invested capital. So, expect the normal companies to outperform in 2026. We started to see tastes of that in 2025 with Amazon up only 4%, Apple up only 8%, Microsoft up 15%, uh, and Intel up 81%. >> I got about 30 seconds. Uh but uh there are a lot of analysts who say look that's all great but we must have a broader market advance that it can't be this narrow uh you know sector of stocks leading the way. Do you do you agree with that? >> I agree and I think that's going to be surprising for people that that's exactly what takes place in 2026. uh as I said the regular everyday businesses implementing that and one of the biggest beneficiaries Ash is going to be health care uh that it uses it to increase margins lower costs but specifically for AI drug development health care tends to outperform in midterm election years when there's volatility on average since 1950 up 9% whereas the S&P up only 2% just over 2% so you definitely want to play the broadening theme and you want to play the groups that are utilizing AI, not the ones that are investing all the capex where most people are crowded in those stocks. So, if you're focused in there, you might want to trim back and and play the broadening theme in 2026. >> Great stuff. Really uh interesting and informative. Thomas Hayes, as always, thank you, Thomas, for joining us on this Christmas Eve. Great to see you. >> Thank you. Merry Christmas. We are. Merry Christmas to you. We're taking it. >> And we're back. Uh, and then I would also like to thank besides Payton Jennings over at Fox, I would like to thank Justin Oliver over at Yahoo Finance and Brian Sazi for having me on this morning to go into a pretty detailed outlook for 2026 and beyond. We're going to listen in here. >> All right. We are being reminded in the final stages of 2025 that it's the AI trade that stirs the drink for portfolios. This will probably be the case in 2026, especially as companies like Meta and Amazon spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build out AI infrastructure in this country. Thomas Hayes, great capital chairman and managing member and Angelo Poffus, Edward Jones, senior global investment strategist. Uh I know have some thoughts on the AI trade. Going to start with you. Uh, Thomas, what has surprised you this year on the AI trade? >> Well, uh, I I'll tell you, Brian, it wasn't a surprise for us, but I think it was a dramatic surprise for the market and may still surprise some people when they hear it right now. The number one performing AI stock for 2025 was not Nvidia. It was Intel. Intel was up uh as of yesterday 81.4% year to date. >> Intel's still around Thomas. They're still around. They still do business. >> They still do business and the world, all of the chip designers are dramatically dependent on them succeeding in developing advanced chips and the US government is standing behind that because we don't want to be dependent exclusively on Taiwan semiconductor. So Intel was the number one chip and hyperscaler followed by AMD. So Intel was up 81%, AMD up 77%. Nvidia up 36% not bad but less than half of the returns of Intel. Microsoft only 15%, Apple 8%, Amazon 4%. So uh I think people were a little surprised that uh that the most popular names uh were more subdued than expected. And I do think that theme is going to persist, but but we'll get to that. >> Angelo, hit me with a surprise. I think uh that Intel move, the fact that it outperformed Nvidia certainly has surprised a lot of folks. What's uh what's been on your radar? >> Yeah, I think one thing that may surprise many of your viewers is that valuations for the tech sector are lower now than what they were at the start of the year. So basically what has happened is that earnings have been growing faster than prices. So that pushes back against all that AI bubble narrative because it is really earnings that have been doing the heavy lifting for the tech sector and that I think is a comforting message. Yes, tech is the most expensive segment of the market but it has been able to deliver earnings, solid earnings and what has happened late in the year is probably a healthy pause. Uh but the AI theme is likely to continue. >> These are surprises I needed. Tom and Angela, you have clearly brought your agame here on Christmas Eve. Tom, back to you. I think Angel makes a very good point on on valuation. So, question to you. Is AI are AI stocks still cheap? Then >> I think that we have to be a little bit careful as we look into 2026. I think the theme is not going to be the AI stocks. It uh or the AI cost centers rather when we think about hyperscalers and some of the chip names. The theme for 2026 and the biggest surprise is going to be AI beneficiaries. those that are implementing the technology into their businesses to improve productivity to improve margins and uh to to Angelo's point uh earnings have grown but if we look out three quarters it's expected that the earnings growth rate of the Magnificent 7 relative to the earnings growth of the unmagnificent 493 we could say cost centers versus AI beneficiaries is going to convert urge, meaning the unmagnificent 493's earnings growth rate will be equal to or greater than the Magnificent 7 earnings growth rate by the third quarter of this year. And that's why I think we're going to see as we see in midterm election years, the indices a little bit more subdued, a little bit more choppy, a little bit more volatile because the biggest weights of the S&P 500 are probably going to take a breather or consolidate their gains uh as that earning growth decelerates. The other thing that we have to keep in mind here Brian is that uh cap X as a percentage of uh operating cash flow now for the hyperscalers is uh exceeding levels of big oil greater than 60% of operating cash flow is now going to capex and that's part of the reason that that growth rate is declining and I think we're going to see a lot of money made under the surface in individual stocks the AI beneficiaries and maybe more subdued returns again from the AI cost centers aka hyperscalers and the stocks that most people are crowded into at the moment. >> Uh Angel talking about subdued returns this year hasn't been a great year relatively speaking for Meta and Amazon but Amazon in particular up only 5%. I mean that's ugly out uh performance versus the S&P 500 and the rest of the mag 7. If in January do you are would you be inclined to buy these AI lagards like a meta and Amazon? >> Our call for next year is rotation both within tech and outside of tech. Uh it is interesting that four of the seven magnificent seven names have lagged the S&P but that's followed the year multiple years of very strong outperformance. So I think some of that rotation is is healthy. uh we are seeing potentially the early stages of the move from the companies that really enable and facilitate the buildout of AI towards the companies that are adopting it and I think that's going to include a broader set of opportunities for investors and that is beyond tech as well thinking about industrials healthcare these are some sectors that we see potential benefits flow through but I think the name of the game is diversification not concentration in 2026 6. >> Tom, tell me if I'm totally off base here. So, you have the rate, you have the Fed cutting rates. Maybe they put come in with one more rate cut early next year. You have a whole class of of people that have been making bank off of CDs, lowrisk investments. Are they now forced back into this market to earn a good return? >> I they are forced back into the market, but guess where they're forced back into is probably one of the most unloved areas of the market. As a matter of fact, dividend payers are the most out of favor and lower relative valuation than they've had in 25 years. >> That makes no sense to me, Tom. I mean, we're supposed to like dividends. We're supposed to champion dividends. We want this check coming to our mailbox every every quarter. >> Well, there's no question. And to exactly to your point, as the Fed cuts and that free uh interest payments on those money markets goes down, they're going to be forced to find the yield elsewhere. That's going to be dividend payers. Now, what is dividend payers? Where do you find the dividend payers? Well, you tend to find them in defensive stocks, consumer staples, uh, healthc care, some of the the stocks. Now, if you look at healthcare in particular, lowest waiting in the, uh, S&P in a handful of years, lowest, uh, relative valuation to the S&P in 25 years, I would say right now is a generational buying opportunity in the healthc care sector. Oh, and by the way, in midterm election years, healthc care dramatically outperforms the indices. Since 1950, the S&P tends to be more subdued in midterm election years, about 2% returns. Well, guess what? Healthcare does over 9% and the last 3 four years, you couldn't give healthcare away. So, expect good things from healthcare uh for a couple of reasons. One, the dividend yields. Two, it tends to do well in uh volatile periods. And three, I think it's going to be one of the major AI beneficiaries, not cost centers, aka they're going to use AI to uh lower cost, increase productivity, and in a material way in drug development. So healthcare is the name of the game for 2026. >> Angelo, next year, is that the year of the dividend? I >> think uh it can have improved performance relative to the other years. We like midcaps as well. think about asset classes, midcaps, some international, still emerging markets. We talk about AI and technology, but there's a lot of innovation also happening beyond the US borders. Uh, and as you talked about the Fed and slightly cutting interest rates next year, that gap now between cash returns, returns on cities, money market funds, and either you talk about fixed income or dividend paying stocks, that gap is going to widen. So we could see some rotation out of heavy excess investments for many investors into cash towards other asset classes. >> Uh Tom, real quick, do you chase gold here? >> No, we like productive assets, but just to jump on what Angelo said, he pointed to midcaps. Well, look at the earnings grow expected growth rate of the S&P at 14%. How about small caps? Expected earnings growth of 55%. They're just coming off the mat. But I think you can get a lot of bang for your buck in 2026 in small caps as well. >> All right, guys. Uh, stick with me. We got a lot more coming up here on opening bid. Straight ahead, uh, not an opening bid, I should say, Morning Brief. Straight ahead of Morning Brief, I'll spotlight a few hot tickers lighting up the Alifines platform this morning. Got to get my shows right. Welcome back to Morning Brief presented by Robin Hood. Now, time for some of today's trending tickers. We're watching BP, Santa, and UiPath. First up, BP. The energy company says it has reached an agreement to sell a majority stake in its Castro Lubricants business. The shareholding has been sold to investment firm Stone Peak in a $10.1 billion deal. Upon completion of the transaction, a new joint venture will be incorporated, comprising a 65% Stone Peak and 35% BP ownership. BP noting that its retained stake provides exposure to Casual's growth plan while retaining optionality to realize further shareholder value in the future. Next, Santa Fe announcing it has entered into an agreement to acquire Dynavax technologies. The bioarmmer company aiming to augment its presence in adult immunization with Dynavax's vaccines, adding that Dynavax's adult hepatitis B vaccine and shingles candidate brings new options to Santa's portfolio. The acquisition involves a cash tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Dynavax, reflecting a total equity value of approximately $2.2 billion. Finally, UiPath seeing shares pop as the company is set to join the S&P Midcap 400 index. The stock will join the index uh before trading starts on January 2nd, 2026. UiPath is replacing Synopus Financial, which is being acquired by Pinnacle Financial Partners. This move for UiPath comes as the autom automation software company has seen over 20% gains so far this year and even solid gains this month following its earnings release. UiPath reported upbeat third quarter results that saw better than expected earnings and revenue. All right, 2026 is fast approaching, but first lessons learned in 2025 with an economic twist. As I wrote on my LinkedIn page this morning, I'm surprised consumer spending hasn't fallen off a cliff given tariff related price increases in a lot of categories found in supermarkets and malls. Yet consumer spending grew at a strong three and a half% pace in the third quarter, largely a function of strong spending by higher inome households. So what did I miss and what does it mean for next year? Tom Hayes, great capital chairman and managing member and Angelo Koffus, Edward Jones, senior global investment strategists are here. Uh Tom, back to you here on this. Can this spending within the highincome household, which I would argue has held up consumer spending this year and the broader stock market, can that continue at its pace next year? I think it can. I think you look at household balance sheets. Uh cash levels at 7% are the highest since 1950. So there's a lot of dry powder on the sidelines. I think uh I think you have a little bit more volatility picking up in the market in the midterm election year that might create a little more subdued. But if you look at consumer sentiment, man, it is washed out. And people are still spending. They're spending. They're saying, "I'm depressed." But apparently they're taking that depression and they're going to the stores and spending money because >> Tom, nobody wants to tell the world they're rich. Nobody wants to say it. They just want to live under the radar, buy their Rolexes, and just don't tell anybody, Tom. >> Yeah, but listen, you can't you can't make this up. Consumer sentiment is lower than it was during COVID, the great financial crisis, and the Vulkar crash in 1980 and and things are relatively good. So, I do think there's some tailwind behind this. I think the consumer can spend. We saw it yesterday uh spending at 3.5%. We saw it in GDP 4.3%. GDP now for Q4 is over 3%. Holiday spending looks pretty good this year. So I do think that's going to persist and I do think that you're going to continue to see an increase in real wage growth. Let's hope we see some more benefits to Main Street in 2026. Uh and I think that could be the theme moving forward versus just the upper end carrying the the water. uh seeing everyone participating and and benefiting from some of these uh progrowth economic policies. >> Angelo, is next year the year of Main Street? That main street finally starts to feel a bit better and they got out and spend in places outside of dollar stores. >> It's been more than two years that wages have been rising faster than inflation. It's a process that takes a while for consumers to feel confident that they are catching up. uh but the combination of still a solid labor market yet slowing and at the same time moderating gradually moderating inflation that is a good mix when we talk about the macro it's all about growth in inflation and we've seen positive surprises on both fronts so I think it looks favorable the backdrop for uh next year and as they say never underestimate uh the US consumer and especially as we talked about balance sheets continue to look and remain and healthy. >> Yeah, we can't help ourselves, Angela. We all want that 10th big screen TV. We all want it. We can't help ourselves. But Angel, is it as simple as to say that the stock market is at records and that's what fueling spending with higher income consumers or is there something else going on here we need to know about? >> No doubt. That is a big supportive factors. Uh the status, the 10% the higher the top 10% on the income categories, they account for 50% of the spending. And we've seen gains not only in equities in fixed income. Talk about investment grade bonds that had the best year since 2020. Real estate prices have been appreciating. And yes, we are stuck in this low hiring, low firing type of labor market. But at the same time, the employment rate remains uh historically low. Uh so, you know, I think that again is a positive as we head into the next year. Tom, hit me with a potential economic surprise for next year. >> Well, I think I think the surprise is we're underestimating what's happening. We're having both guns blazing with an easing cycle with the Fed. We continue to ease. We continue to cut. But oh, by the way, QE light is back. The Fed is going to be in the market buying $40 billion of tea bills at least through April. So, that's going to add a tremendous amount of liquidity. had over 320 global central bank cuts in 2025. Uh highest you've seen since since the great financial crisis that works on a lagged effect. So you have a lot of liquidity there. You got these tax refunds of a,000 to $2,000 going out to Main Street. You potentially have if the Supreme Court turns uh turns off the tariffs or or uh unwinds them in a way uh Trump is not going to give that money back to to foreign uh entities. he's going to pay it out as dividends and then he's going to figure out how to do the tariffs in another legal framework. So, you could have a a tremendous amount of fiscal stimulus coupled with an easing cycle coupled with rising wages and really benefit Main Street in 2026. So, I think people are kind of underestimating not just the earnings growth, not just uh uh Main Street, but fiscal and monetary policy guns blazing going into 2026. That's a positive. >> I'll weigh in with the surprise here. I think what we're going to see on on the on the GDP front is going to shock the hell out of people. And I mean to the upside. I mean, we have AI infrastructure being built out aggressively in this country. You guys are talking about higher wages. We've got rate cuts, lower rates from the Fed. I mean, Angelo, the ground is set for I think some serious upside to economic growth in this country next year. But if that does happen, what does that mean for the outlook for rates? Yeah, I think the key in all of this to connect all of these dots is productivity. Let's look at corporate profits. Corporate profits have been booming without companies adding much headcount and that implies real productivity gains. Maybe too early to say that all is AI. But since after the pandemic, we know that technological adoption really accelerated and potentially we are in this period of sustained productivity gains. So the goldilocks is if we can sustain above trend growth for a while without generating inflation. Our call is that with the economic growth holding steady potentially even above 2% the Fed slightly cutting rates towards 3 to 3 and a half% maybe the 10-year yield doesn't have necessarily much downside below 4%. So, we're looking at rangebound yields, but still a Fed that kind of moves more closely to to that neutral rate again between 3 and 3 and a half%. So, not much downside, but you don't really need to as long as the economy continues to perform as it has. >> Tom, 30 seconds left. Do you have one investing resolution top of mind for yourself for next year? >> Well, I think we're going to keep doing what we did in 2025 because it worked. I I think the thing that is going to surprise people is that equalw weight indices could outperform cap weighted indices. I think people who are just stuck in regular cap weighted indices like the S&P 500 are going to be underwhelmed with their returns in 2026. And the people that venture out a little bit either the stock pickers I think there's going to be a fortunes made under the surface but the easy way to get exposure to that is with an equal weight index in which case uh would be the first time in some time where the the broadening and that participation overwhelms what what people expect in the indices uh and that's a sign of health. That's a good thing not a bad thing. >> The future favors the bold. Happy holidays to you uh both gents. Appreciate you taking the time here. here. We'll talk to you soon. >> Thank you. >> Thank you. All right, that >> we're back. Uh then I want to thank all of you. Uh apparently a lot of people did Christmas shopping and are getting a ton of hedge fund tips. Hats and mugs and shirts and hoodies have been super popular. I love the hoodies. They're super warm. And then sending in their incredible photos wearing the merch. That's the name of the game, guys. um um how this grows and why I keep putting it out free every week uh for clients and non-clients alike and delivering this value is because you guys are doing a great job of sharing. So, if you're getting value uh and uh and it's really helping you and you're making money, share it with one person you love that could benefit from this information. We'll continue to grow. We'll continue to put this out. And an easy way to do is wear the hat, wear the mug. uh and people will ask you about it and give back to the community and then send in a picture so we can get you on here with everyone else. We've got a lot of great data to cover this week. Let's start with this chart from PayPal. You can see the free cash flow yield is nearing a record high at 10% free cash flow buying the stock at this price. We're super excited for 2026. key article here from uh American Banker and he's talking about you know 200 countries 430 million active customers 35 million uh merchants $2 trillion in payment volume they're doubling down to use PayPal's vast scale to power new forms of artificial intelligence blockchain in its digital wallet um he ran into its small business group we know all this PayPal's betting big on a gentic AI to support its omni channel payment strat strategy. Agentic commerce services. They're a leader there. Agentic commerce is the next phase, says Chris. We're making sure an AI agent can make payments, figure out where they are, and find out what store is down the street and what what it is they want. PayPal enabled its merchants to become discoverable with within perplexity uh through its identity verification. Couple other things. huge opportunity. Uh, PayPal's partnerships with Ingenerative Agentic will give it an advantage. Inclusion into chatb GPT's instant checkout will make PayPal's branded wallet available as a payment method within instant checkout for op for merchants who opt in. So, just on and on really great stuff. talking about their partnership. Google, Amazon, and PayPal through its partnership of with Google have agentic scale access to PDP partnership with Google gives Alex Chris a direct ride on Gemini's growth and agentic dominance. People are really underestimating this. This is why we continue to buy shares like crazy this week. Uh and uh we're going to see some exciting things from PayPal in 2026. Boost brand checkout and international payments are two areas PayPal hopes will drive its growth in the future. Uh has evolved towards a digital wallet etc. So it's talking about a aentic AI being transformative for the business. This is not embedded in the price of the stock. Not to mention 10% free cash flow yield 6 to7 billion. Oh, and by the way, they buy in 10% of the stock every single year. Uh, so your slice of the pie gets 10% bigger without putting a new penny. So, we're excited for that one. Biggest surprise of this year, not for the hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes community. Intel was the number one performing AI stock in the semiconductor and hyperscalers better than all of um better than every MAG 7. uh up 81% year to date as of yesterday's close. More than double the returns of Nvidia, more than 20 times the return of Amazon, more than 10 times the return of Apple, more than six times the return of Meta, more than five times the return of Microsoft. So, it's been a great great year. We're super excited. You couldn't give it away under 20 when we were pounding the table on Vanney last September of 2024. And uh and there there you go. Uh here is uh talking about sector rotation from Strategus. We've covered that a million times over. Uh capex is now returning um depressing cash return on equity. We've been talking about that theme and we reemphasized it with Ash Webster and Brian Sazy on the media hits this morning which you heard. Um, we've got US dollar index kind of mimicking what happened the first term of Trump's presidential election, first two years. Expect continued weakness. Ladies and gentlemen, by the way, that is going to help our newest position in healthcare, which all the new clients that have been coming in for this quarter have been getting in their portfolios. All the existing clients, pretty much every single one of you, I was able to find room uh and um and get in this. 64% of their sales are XUS. So, the weak dollar will will give them a boost in 2026. Uh as well as the healthc care theme. Uh we love this one and we can't wait to bring this out and release it. Um we're doing the write up and uh we're getting uh everyone uh lots of shares. So, super excited for that. On to the next. Healthc care stocks are undervalued. This is why we we took profits on XBI and the biotech and we've added a third healthc care position. We want to take advantage of this once in a generation. Healthcare has not been this cheap or this low a weight in the S&P going back 25 years. Not to mention, healthcare outperforms in midterm election years. uh up 9% versus the S&P up 2% since 1950. Those are averages. Healthc care positioning is starting to build up but uh nowhere near near where it's going to be. Uh mortgage rates are starting to converge with Treasury yields falling over which is going to be positive for housing. They think Generrack, Stanley Black & Deckers, QXO, etc. Um tech bubble. This is global defensives as a percent of global market cap. You haven't seen this level extreme since 2000 when tech cooled pretty aggressively and defensive staples and uh I would put it as the unmagnificent 493 the non-mag7 type components started to outperform. Uh this is really an opportunity for the way this community is positioned and clients have been positioned. Uh so we're super excited. Okay, core inflation eases to its lowest level since 2021. Uh, many of the pundits were calling for the opposite. Those of you who are on this podcast knew better and you took advantage. Nearly all major equity markets have outperformed the US in 2025 in local and in USD terms. Ladies and gentlemen, that was a core theme for us in 2025 and helped us shoot the lights out and we're very grateful uh for that transition to technology. Hybrids are poised to grow in coming years. That helps Cooper Standard value versus growth dynamics have been diverging between the US and Europe. In other words, Europe value has started to take off. US value just starting. But, you know, that's such a such a broad term. It's like with what we were able to achieve this year and we're considered like value tilt type manager. What we're doing is entirely different than traditional value which is just buying cheap stuff and getting trapped in it. doing turnarounds with a catalyst. And we're buying great businesses at at in excuse me, we're buying good businesses at great prices uh versus great businesses at good prices because great businesses at good prices, that's a good way to compound your money at 20%. Uh good business at great prices is how you can shoot the lights out over time if you know how to do the underlying fundamental analysis. Uh great prices uh are not always great prices if something is cheap for a reason. And that's what we do here and that's what we teach and help you try to understand is how to distinguish between temporary impairments and permanent impairments with good businesses. Uh household wealth is is growing for the bottom 50%. Uh let's see active equity flows. Uh CPI housing inflation coming down. It's good to see that household cash as a percentage of total financial assets is now 7%, 98th percentile, highest rate since 1950. I'm telling you what's going to happen, ladies and gentlemen. As rates continue to come down, money market yields continue to compress. That's all going to be forced into the stock market from people looking for yield and dividend payers are going to fly. Cheapest relative value, most underappreciated bucket of the market since 2000. Get ready for a dividend payer boom, which is consumer staples, defensives, healthc care, which we're positioned to take advantage of. It also helps housing by the way, which we are also positioned to take advantage of. Annualized returns of US stocks by size. Uh this shift is going to go to small caps because uh small cap earning growth 55% lower rates help small caps refinance. Uh and the multiple is lower than large caps. So you get triple the almost quadruple the ear expected earnings growth for slightly less multiple. That's a formula for success and lower rates is the catalyst. It is the spark that lights the fire. Uh almost everyone is very long stocks. When they say this though you know what that implies is indices indices are cap weighted. Cap weighted is mag seven. And yes those guys are getting and going to get relatively torched. Maybe not absolutely torched, but certainly relatively torched to those who are playing outside that crowded space. Japanese 10-year yield highest going back to 1999. This is what we call a carry trade unwind, ladies and gentlemen. That's part of the reason that you're having pressure on the MAG 7. And we were early in telling you this would happen about a year and a half ago. And here we are today. bull bear indicator stretched little bit of exuberance. If you're in the crowded stocks, I'd watch out after the first of the year. Uh or be a little bit cautious. Here is earnings growth. Russell 2000 55% next year, S&P 500 14%. Um we've got a lot of great data this week. Median size of new single family homes is declining. This was another thing that we called early on uh would would happen and that's going to improve the uh housing affordability. Not every 23 year old needs 4500 square f feet in an indoor pool. Uh how about like the 50s when we had the housing boom. Think Levittown 1,500 1200 square foot houses on a slab. Have your first kid or two and a dog. Uh upgrade get in the game. By 35 you're upgrading to a 4,000 foot house. And off to the races. Uh, existing home sales starting to pick up. New vehicle average transaction price has now leveled off. This is helping Cooper Standard. We're going to talk about that in a second. Uh, Lenar's average selling price net of incentives is down 21.4 from its 2022 peak. When factoring in incentive spending, the decline narrows to two 10 negative 10.8% from peak. We want to see volumes helps QXO. Volumes helps Generrack. Volumes helps Stanley Black & Decker building. We don't care about the margins of the builders just like we don't care about the margins of the auto suppliers. We want to play Cooper Standard. We are a pick and shovel kind of guy and um let the rest dig for the gold and gamble and win or lose. We could care less. We're the c We're the house. We're the casino. We're not the gambler. Uh here we go. Looking at some restaurant stocks. This sector has been absolutely decimated, left for dead. We finally found a play in it with uh friend of mine uh was telling me I was saying the name of our pizza place in in my old old town in Connecticut. Uh Papa John's. Papa John's. We love this one, especially with one and $2,000 increases in tax refunds. You know, Papa John's is not It's funny. I sent out gift cards to all of my clients for Papa John's this year. Last year, we sent them vans. We always try to send something from the portfolio. Uh, number one, so they can uh see what they own, and number two, so we can boost earnings for their holdings as owners. Uh, and uh, so all these sentaires and billionaires are having their Papa John's, but uh, for the for the uh, regular folk getting normal people getting,000 to $2,000 refund checks in April and possibly $2,000 tariff checks and the military who got $,776 dividend checks. Uh, those people can feed a family of four for 20 bucks at Papa John's. And I'm telling you, when that extra discretionary income comes in, they're going to do it in spades. Russell 2000 earnings growth uh in this Bank of Goldman Sachs note consensus is 61% earnings growth, which would be the highest we've seen since uh 254 23 22 2021 and then going all the way back to 2010. So, we're excited to see that. And that was kind of the norm in the early 2000s when uh small cap value outperformed everything. Expect similar outcomes in coming months and years. Uh so these are some factors that they're putting into play to make housing more readily available, lowering land use restrictions, etc., etc., etc. Herd mentality, unanimously bullish and and uh clustered. I think it's going to be a subdued ne for people who are crowded into passive indexes that are market cap weight. Um I think they're going to be sorely disappointed, zero to 8%. Uh and I think fortunes are going to be made under the surface by stock pickers who know what the hell they're doing and um people in the right sectors. And even if you can't do that, buying an equal weight over a cap weighted should help you along the way, probably by a few full percentage points of performance. Uh on to the next consumer sentiment, lowest since COVID lows, uh even lower than the great financial crisis and down to the Vulkar lows and and then back to the early 50s. Uh that's generally bullish. uh when it gets this um negative uh is usually a good time to be buying the right type of stocks. Owner's equity in real estate continues to climb. That's the wealth effect. Equity funds large inflows blah blah blah. All right, pretty good job with the data in a short holiday week. S&P once again concentrated in expensive names. Price to sales greater than 10 times is an extreme even after adjusting for select number of mega caps. Uh it hasn't been this extreme since 2000. Uh both on the cap weighted and the equal weighted. So I would strongly remind you if you were in crowded trades, get someone who knows what the hell they're doing or get out of the crowded trades and lighten up. Don't be a pig. pigs get slaughtered. Uh Federal Reserve balance sheet down 2.43 trillion. They're starting up again. QE light 40 billion a month of bond purchases. That is adding liquidity. That is QE again. That is positive for risk assets. Small cap equity position just starting to increase. Here are the leveraged long ETF assets. Uh as you can see when it hits this level of peak expect some more consolidation and that's again going to hit the most crowded trades in the cap weighted indexes. Analysts expect China AI capex to rise but at a much smaller scale than the US. Their earnings are going to rise much faster than their capex. In the US the opposite is true. US economy expands at the fastest rate in two years. We saw the GDP numbers this this week uh for Q3. for Q4 GDP now is at 3% also very positive. Uh normal December seasonality playing out we're right here tends to be strength into the end of the month. US midcaps trading at a PE of 15 times versus 22 times. That relative PE of.7 is the lowest rate we've seen since 1999 and 2000. So alongside the small cap theme, this is a generational opportunity to get exposure to midcaps like the new position we put into the portfolio like the VF corps of the world like uh quite a few of our number our companies are midcaps and that's going to benefit greatly in coming months and years. International stocks outperform US peers. We said that was coming this year. It will persist in 2026. And that's it for the data of the week. Now on to Alibaba has soared. China tech stocks can ride the AI wave further, says Goldman. Opinion follows trend. None of them were interested at $60. Everyone's interested at $150 and going higher. This stock has the potential to double again, but it's going to take another three years to do that, which slows down the IRRa. Uh, which is why new money, new client money is not aggressively going in there. We were buying till our fingers bled at 60 at the lows. Brought our basis down to 82. Now we're just enjoying the ride and holding all of our shares through to the promised land. How Warren Buffett did it. This is by Seth Clarman in the Atlantic. One of the best articles I've read. Go ahead and read that when you have time. Go to google.com. Cox automotive forecast. Despite Q4 slowdown, new vehicle sales forecast to reach 16.3 million in 2025, up from 2024. Best results since 2019, which means Cooper Standard's going to be smiling so wide they can eat a banana sideways, minting money as the volumes grow. and we're nowhere near the cycle peak uh which we think it can earn $10 a share as opposed to its last peak at $7.19 a share of earnings in 2017 when it was $146 stock. Uh so we're early days and we're super excited on that front. Let's see what we've got here. We've got the Bloomberg uh massive security thing never letting me into my own subscription. EV sales growth is slowing. Are hybrids the solution? They are for Cooper Standard. We love the cost per vehicle and the amount of parts that they sell into hybrids. Disney stock is the analyst top this analyst top media pick. Wyatt can bounce back. Uh we love Disney. We've got it a lot of it in the mid80s. We've had it for some time and now they're talking about catalysts for acceleration between streaming, between parks, between cruise business, uh, highest return on capital business in 2026. We love it. We agree. Avatar 3 tops China box office in another win for Disney. They're crushing it at the box office, by the way, with all their films this year. Holiday retail spending rose 4.2% this season, driven by e-commerce and electronics. That's even more pronounced in China, which Alibaba is the toll taker, which we love. Retail stocks could get a tax refund boost in 2026. Picture of Nike sneakers. What they should have is a picture of Vans because skateboarding is all the rage. If you look at the Paris fashion show, it was all skater shoes. And with the high-end collabs they have with the Valentinos and everything else, it's going to be a great year for VF Corp and Bracken aka Growth Daryl. For those of you who missed the interview I did with the CEO of VF Corp aka Vans Timberlin Northface, uh just go to hedge fund tips uh I'm sorry, go to YouTube, type in hedge fund tips bracken darl and you will see that full interview early days on that stock despite its recent move higher. Bessant sees room for a future revamp of Fed's 2% target. You heard it here first. I said 3% is going to be the new 2% and uh we have not changed that view. Bessant is riding driving the bus. Home sales climb to a 9-month high as sellers finally give in. Affordability is happening. The air pocket is here and it's going to continue as rates lower. This time will be different because we're going to get a lot of boomer supply hit the market all at once. Everyone thinks when rates go down, prices will go back up. It's the opposite this time. A lot of supply is going to hit the market all at one time, and it's going to overwhelm the amount of buyers, which is going to put them in the driver's seat. Uh, which is well, anyway, that's that. Uh, this 27 billion home builder says the feds are cooking up something big to address housing market affordability. Home builders are in discussions with the Trump administration. Uh he says, "Do I think something will come out of 2026? I'd be surprised if something isn't done. Whether that's portability of the mortgages, opening up federal land to build, a lot of options in the tank." Stanley Black & Decker's 1.8 billion aerospace unit sale will ease debt load. What we look for in turnarounds besides solveny risk, we do the balance sheet first. We do catalyst. We look at the jockey. Often there's a new jockey. Uh and then we look at their outs. If for then anyone that plays poker, uh we always look for outs. And in the case of VF Corp, they had a lot of outs. They were able to sell Supreme, pay down debt. They were able to sell Dickies, pay down debt. Now they're in growth mode. Uh same thing with Stanley Black & Decker. They sold their $ 1.8 billion aerospace unit. Now they are a lean mean fighting machine with massive operating leverage to ride the housing building recovery wave. Mergers and acquisitions soared this year that could make 2026 even bigger. Animal spirits are back. Small cap stocks are winners. Let the good times keep rolling. That's from Jacob Sonenshine. You heard it here first. We've been pounding the table on that theme and now it's playing out. Article of the week, setting up the second act stock market and sentiment results. We went through the media. We're going to talk Fizer which is a new newish position uh we bought uh in the past couple of months on weakness. You can see here free cash flow reacelerating revenues reacelerating margins reacelerating and so on. You see sales per share growing, cash flow per share growing, earnings per share growing, dividends per share continue to grow. You got a 7% yield right now alone. Get paid while you wait. uh margins are growing and share count uh is static, which is okay. They'll start buying back as thing cash flow continues to ramp up. Um or they can't find out external investments that give them a higher um return on invested capital than the inverse of uh call it 8 times earnings. So 1 divided by 8 and you got yourself an one divide by 8 a 12.5% earnings yield. So they need to find investments that yield greater than that which they're finding all day long in the CGEN in the meta uh as you look at the long-term results. So healthcare uh uh fizer is a name that comes came across our desk many times over the years and we recently pulled the trigger building a nice size position on weakness. Uh for those of you who've been on the last few podcasts, you know it's a unique or clients looking in their account, you know, we positioned uniquely in this position. Uh unlike anything we've done before, uh so that we can make a multibagger even if the stock itself is not a double, we can make four, fivex on our money. uh we've positioned that uniquely because of uh the Black Shoes model on um some of the instruments we're using to express that uh that positioning and we're we're very excited about. So we first laid out our thesis publicly on Fox Business December 4th along with several other media appearances that same week. We expanded on the the you can watch it there. We expanded on the thesis at a more granular level at the money show in Sarasota where we presented the full Fiser investment case see below presentation uh and the times are here 2357 to 33. Uh you can find that on my YouTube channel or just go to hedge funips.com and click on the article setting up the second act. While you're at hedge fun.com, click on terms. This is all opinion not advice. Consult your psychic before doing anything else. And um uh that's that this was a good presentation. You should check it out if you want an outlook of the whole 2026. Healthcare has been an area the market we've kept a close eye on and one where we've been looking to add additional exposure alongside our existing holding in Baxter International. And now we've got a third one which we announced uh that um we have and clients have been able to take advantage of and new clients who've come in early to take advantage since we opened last week for our quarterly openings for the small accounts of 1 million plus and uh intraquarter for the large accounts of 5 million plus. Uh you guys all have it. Uh the sector has become one of the most dislocated sectors of the market battered by policy and regulatory headwinds and driven into three straight years of underperformance. This resulted in a 51 point cumulative lag behind the broader market making it the worst stretch on record. We love those environments. The ensuing forced selling and rush for the exits pushed the sector's waiting to under 9%. A sharp retreat from over 15% in 2022 and reminiscent of levels not seen since the early 2000s. A setup that preceded a multi-year stretch of outperformance. Ladies and gentlemen, this shoot first ask questions later environment left a long list of high-quality healthcare companies on the clearance rack. We quickly quickly rolled up our sleeves and started digging through the rubble in search of a pony in the pile. What made the setup even more compelling was the backdrop of a midterm election year notorious for elevated volatility. Such conditions played directly into the strengths of resilience, durable demand sectors like healthcare, which has a consistent track record as a top performer in midterm cycles. In fact, the sector has outperformed in 11 of the last 13 midterm years, posting average annual returns of 9.03% and dwarfing the broader market's modest 62 basis points of returns. With that framework in mind and a willingness to lean against the prevailing narrative, we went hunting within the sector and eventually zeroed in on a name offering asymmetric upside while trading at life support valuations. That name was Fizer, founded in 1849. Fiser stands alone as one of the world's greatest as one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies with a broad portfolio spanning vaccines, oncology, and immunology immunology. If you think this is the first time fizer has found itself in the gutter over its 176-year operating history, think again. Through wars, depressions, and countless cycles, this company has seen it all and consistently emerged stronger on the other side. Today, Fizer markets nine blockbuster products led by Elicus and the Prevnar family and delivered the top selling COVID vaccine uh comati and oral treatment paxid during the pandemic. The stock remains down more than 60% from its COVID era highs when the company was effectively king of the world and its twin COVID franchise generated 90 billion in supplemental revenue and $40 billion in incremental free cash flow in 2021 and 2022 alone. That windfall faded much faster than management or the market anticipated by 2023. Revenues had fallen more than 40% forcing large inventory and intangible write downs and sending adjusted EPS down 72%. The resulting COVID volatility and uncertainty created a massive overhang on the stock. One we believe is now firmly in the rearview mirror. The core business has stabilized in the low $60 billion revenue range with earnings power recovered to a solid $3 plus baseline and COVID products representing just 8% of sales a fraction of the 57% peak in 2022. Despite this stabilization, the market continues to fixate on the lingering COVID shadow and the impending patent cliff with key blockbusters IBRs Eloquis uh Xandandy and Prevnar facing loss of exclusivity between 2026 and 2028 putting 17 billion in annual revenue at risk. We believe this pessimism is far overdone and overlooks the heavy lifting management has already delivered to rightsize the business and offset these headwinds. Fiser launched a $7.2 billion cost savings program aimed at restoring operating margins to prepandemic levels while reinvesting $500 million to strengthen R&D productivity. Management has executed aggressively, already delivering $5.1 billion in savings and putting the company on track to achieve the full 7.2 billion by 2026, a full year ahead of schedule. More telling, rather than relying solely on cost cuts to offset patent expirations, management went on offense with the COVID cash, going shopping for the next generation of growth drivers. The $43 billion CGEN deal added four approved cancer drugs and a leading oncology pipeline that management expects to scale from 2 billion in revenue to more than 10 billion by 2030 most recently. And just when Fizer appeared out of the GLP1 race, the 10 billion Metsera acquisition puts the company back in the center of the hundred billion plus obesity market with a differentiated once monthly platform targeting a 2028 launch and delivering $5 billion plus in peak annual sales potential. Combined with earlier boltzons like Arena, Biohaven, GBT and the licensing deal with 3S Bio, Fiser is well positioned to offset loss of exclusivity pressures and return to growth later this decade. Sometime we believe the market continue something we believe the market continues to materially underappreciate. Just at at just eight times earnings, the market is giving Fizer zero credit for anything going right, making it one of the cheapest large cap pharma names on offer. If management is even halfright on the road map, we see a clear path to a double over the next few years. If the full vision plays out and healthcare sentiment finds its way out of the doldrums, the upside is meaningfully higher. In the meantime, investors get paid a nearly 7% dividend yield to weight, more than four times the sector average, and backed by an 86year-old payment history. 86 years of dividend payment history. The dividend is supported by a strong balance sheet with $15 billion of cash and cash equivalents and more than 10 billion of annual free cash flow generation. I love free cash flow generation. This life support valuation combined with an attractive dividend yield sets a firm floor and offers meaningfully meaningful downside protection. Meanwhile, the bar for positive surprises remains ex exceptionally low as the market price is in virtually no good news. As execution progresses and new growth engines begin to show through, we expect sentiment to turn and quickly. Until then, we are happy to sit tight, collect the dividend, and wait for this iconic American blue chip to reclaim its former glory. Earlier this month, management hosted an analyst and investor call to walk through 2026 guidance, recent acquisitions, and the long-term path back to growth. Here are the key takeaways highlighted and underlined. And here are the 10 key points. management fully reaffirmed its full year 2025 and adjusted EPS guidance of 3 to 315 and noted results are currently tracking toward the top end of the range. Fully year revenue guidance was narrowed to 62 billion consistent with the prior 61 to64 billion range two. Looking ahead to 2026, management expects revenue of 59.5 billion to 62.5 broadly in line with expectations including 4% operational growth at the midpoint excluding COVID and loss of LOE. Ex adjusted EPS is guided to 280 to $3 modestly below street estimate of 305 as several headwinds weigh on results. These include 22 cents of dilution from the 3S bio and metsera deals, a $ 1.5 billion in decline in COVID revenue, representing 18% EPS headwind, 1.5 billion of patent expirations, and a higher tax rate rising to 15% from 11%, a 12 cents headwind. Three, the Metsera acquisition is gaining traction with management guiding to at least 15 obesity drug trials in 2026, the majority in phase three. The first MSEA product remains targeted for a 2028 launch with meaningful contributions expected in the years that follow. management also believes it now has the most advanced GIPR oral candidate in the industry which it views as a significant opportunity to address the masses with the only key monthly clo do dosing data with the key monthly dosing data expected in Q1 four management cut 2025 CO 19 sales expectations to 6.5 billion from 9 billion as global infection rates remain muted co revenue is expected to decline further to 5 billion in 2026, representing just 8.2% of total sales versus 57% in 2022 as Fizer continues to exit the COVID driven error. Five, Fiser expects 17 billion in annual revenue impact from the loss of exclusivity by 2030 relative to 2025 with a 1.5 billion LOE headwind anticipated in 2026. Management remains confident that the internal pipeline along with acquisition of Biohaven, CGN, and Metera and the licensing agreement with 3S Bio positions the company well for 2029 and beyond to be strong growth years. By the end of 2025, the portfolio recent of recently launched and acquired products is expected to generate 10 billion in revenue growing at double-digit rates with growth expected to accelerate into the latter part of the decade and help offset patent expiration headwind. Six. The cost realignment program is now on track to deliver the majority of the 7.2 billion in total net cost savings by 2026, a full year ahead of prior expectations with 500 million rate reinvested to strengthen R&D productivity. 7 2026 uh um uh sales SI SINA expenses are expected to be 12.5 billion to 13.5 billion down from 13.1 billion to 14 SGNA expenses by the way okay are expected to be 12.5 to 13.5 down from 13.1 to 14.1 representing a 4% year-on-year decline as cost savings continue to materialize. This is expected to support the stable gross and operating margins for the year with adjusted gross margins projected in the mid 70% range and management seeing a clear path to consistently returning to the mid to high 70% range over time. Eight, Fiser expects robust operating cash flow in 2026 with the bulk of cash restructuring payments now behind the company and the final 2.6 6 billion repatriation tax payment occurring in 2026 with capex expected to be slightly above 3 billion for the year. This sets up solid free cash flow generation on a go forward basis. Nine management reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining and growing the dividend over time with the current quarterly dividend at 43 per share and the forward dividend yield now close to 7%. 10 management expects to exit the year with gross leverage slightly above the 2.7 times which is expected to remain relatively stable through the LOE period. Entering 2026, Fizer retains 6 billion of business development capacity. We've highlighted all the key things in the earnings call and now we're going on to Albamaro. Uh note we have taken profits on a portion of this position as it is now up 139% or 2.4x off our blended basis of 6129 in a very short period of time. This is much faster than we expected. It remains a core position, but we don't want to be pigs, so we're taking some profits. Um, so here are the key things we've highlighted and underlined for you. Uh, 10 key points. Number one, revenue of 1.31 billion declined 3.5% year-on-year, but beat consensus by 28 million as 8% volume growth in both energy storage and ketchin was more than offset by price declines of 16% and 5% respectively. Adjusted loss per share of 19 cents beat street estimates by 69 cents and improved 88% from the 155 loss last year. Two, despite lower lithium prices in Q3, management made meaningful progress on profitability with adjusted EVID of 226 million up 7% yearonear and margins improving 170 basis points to 17.3 based on cost removed from the business and recovering lithium prices. management expects operating leverage could eventually push adjusted ebida margins above 30% uh $15 per kg LCE. For context, lithium prices are now over $14 kilogram LCE, knocking on the door of management's target. Again, while this may seem like a big move from summer lows, it pays to zoom out. We are still in early days as it relates to lithium prices, which is why it remains a core position. Three, global lithium ion battery demand for stationary storage jumped 105% year-to- date, led by North America and Europe at 145% each and China at 60%. The market has been a major upside surprise for management with demand exceeding expectations and slower than expected supply growth tightening the market. Lithium demand for energy storage seems systems is now expected to increase more than 2.5x to a range of 430 to 1 1070 KTLCE by 2030 from 200 in 2024 implying a 15 to 30% kagger and potentially reaching half of total lithium demand four despite the noise global EV demand remains strong growing 30% year to date this mostly China continues to represent 60% of the global EV V market maintaining strong demand even after suppressing surpassing 50% market penetration. Europe accounts for 20% of the market with 31% growth while the US makes up just 10% of the market with 12% growth. Global EV demand still drives over 70% of lithium demand and management expects the market to remain healthy with continued growth ahead. Five operating cash flow came in at 356 million in Q3, up 57% year-on-year, bringing year-to- date operating cash flow to 949, up 29%. Management continues to expect fullear operating cash flow conversion above 80% well above the long-term target of 60 70%. Uh driven by 350 million of customer prepayment earlier in the year and ongoing working capital improvements. Most importantly, management now expects to generate 300 to 400 million in free cash flow for the full year compared to the the year's original expectation of break even and last quarter's call for just positive. Six management announced agreements to sell its controlling 51% stake in Ketchin's refining catalyst solutions business and Ketchin's interest in the Euroat joint venture from combined pre-tax proceeds of 660 million. Both transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2026 with proceeds supporting further balance sheet deleveraging 7. Albamaro further lowered fullear capex expectations to 600 million, a 65% decline from last year's 1.7 billion and exceeding the original plan for 50% reduction. As management focuses on projects with the highest returns on capital and fastest paybacks, looking to 2026, management sees a further 10% decline as reasonable, emphasizing that current capex remain maintains assets and reflects efficiency gains rather than underinvestment. Eight, management continues to strengthen the balance sheet with 1.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and total liquidity of 3.5 billion. Total debt stood at 3.6 billion fully fixed at a weighted average rate of 3.6% 6% resulting in net debt to adjusted Ebidov just 2.1 times. Following the catch-in transactions and the Q4 debt repayment of 440 million near-term cash is expected to reach $2 billion. Nine management is now on track to deliver fullear run rate cost and productivity improvements of 450 million above the initial target of 300 to 400 million with sales, administrative and R&D expenses now down 166 million or 22% year-to date. and 10 management now expects the fullear outlook to land at the higher end of the previously published 9 uh dollars per kg scenario which called for sales of 4.9 to 5.2 billion and adjusted IBIDA of 800 million to a billion driven by stronger lithium pricing and fullear volumes expected to exceed 10%. Keep in mind this guidance was issued in early November when prices were still below 11.5 kg suggesting meaningful upside to those numbers based on today's prices. Here's the earnings call highlighted. You can read it at the website hedgefundtips.com. And now on to the market. By the way, Morning Star has a $200 per share fair value estimate. Uh and uh and we think it can work its way up there over time. Not at the same pace that it's uh uh 2.4xed 4xed uh but um but certainly grind higher over time which we love and why it continues to remain a core position.

Defense and aerospace earnings estimates and revisions. Top 30 weights. In the last 60 days, their earnings have been revised down by six basis points. So basically flat. Energy top 30 weights. Last 60 days revised up 23 basis points. Economic data has been better than expected this week. Uh even on the jobs front, estimates for earnings next year are still $39. Uh which has come up quite a bit since the summer. And now we're going on to many people's favorite part of the week, which is the ask me anything questions. For those of you who don't like the ask me anything questions, thanks for joining. Merry Christmas. For those of you who do, uh here we go. Our first question comes in from Ron Burgundy. Uh, sounds like uh someone from uh I forget what movie that was with Will Ferrell, but okay, Ron. Selinies. I don't know. Do we cover this one every week or every other week? Um, we continue to look at it. And what we continue to say is we like it, but that it's not without risk. They got balance sheet risk. If it works, you're going to be up 5x. Excuse me, not 5x. If it works, you're going to get yourself a triple. And uh I think you're going to be fine with this one. We'd love We would like to get more exposure to materials, but there are only so many positions we can have in the portfolio. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. 140 million of cash. You got 1.6 billion of receivables, and you got 11 billion of debt. So, you got to really know when that debt is coming due. I think they're going to figure it out. I think this cycle is going to change. a billion dollars of free cash flow. They'll figure it out. Let's look at the income statement if they did anything stupid raising equity. And the answer is uh no, they're bringing down the share count modestly. So, we like that. I think you're going to be okay here. We like the idea. Way to go, Ron Burgundy. On to the next. J El okay wants to know about Goose and Jay says they're burning cash. Well Jay, your numbers are wrong. They continue to generate record free cash flow, record revenues, stock is still down even though it's had a huge move off the lows and off of our basis. It's just getting started. So um check yourself before you wreck yourself. go directly to the SEC filings uh if you don't have Koi Fin that pulls directly from the SEC filings and uh go from there. Barry Kimbro, what's your thoughts on Align Tech? We don't like Align Tech, but we do like the space and uh we are going to leave that there. Line is not for us. It could work, but we have no edge there. Manny B Conmed, CNMD. I think we covered this a couple weeks ago. Uh, and I think we said okay. Let's just double check that. Yeah, I think you'll be okay there. Next, Jack Law Comber, uh, Dublin, Ireland. How you doing, Jack? WDFC. What is that? WD40. It's okay, but there are higher and better uses of your cash. Uh you're certainly not going to get a double off of it. And um you know, with declining revenues, well, no, revenues are okay. I just think it's rich. I I I wouldn't be a buyer here, but I don't think you're going to get hurt. Harry G. Bristol Meyers. It definitely clicks the healthc care box. This one's not for me, but um I think it's going to work with the whole sector. It's been flat. I think it's probably on its way to do better things than it's been doing for the last five plus years. So, I would say okay, but Fizer's better in terms of multiples you can get, depending how you express it. Jason M, uh Jason M, uh we're going to get back to you on that one. We can't talk about it now. You can interpret it that as you will. Tom, merry Christmas. Nike, uh, we like Nike. We like the turnaround. As a matter of fact, one of their directors, um, named Tim Apple, aka Tim Cook, bought a ton of stock, or not a ton, he bought $3 million of stock. And, uh, I think this one's going to work. I think it's going to take longer than everyone thinks. And I think VF Corp is a better bang for your buck because you're going to get a higher multiples. You know, when Nike recovers, you get a double. When VF recovers from our basis, you get three to five bags. And we like three to five bags that better than a double. So, uh, BHC, this is from Max M. BHC. Is this this, uh, yeah, it's B. This is a value trap. It's probably going to work. I mean, there all these guys pulse in. They've been in it forever and they continue to it's been a bad use of capital. Uh I just don't see the growth. It's okay. This is this is a value trap. That's not what we do. It could work, but I don't think it's going to be great. Uh, Wabash National WNC. Uh, revenues declining, cash flow declining. WNC. Yeah. I mean, but you're probably going to wind up with a double on this one. Let's just take a look at the balance sheet. Engineered solutions for logistics. Well, logistics is going up. We know that from our position with GXO. Let's just see if they're going to make stay in business until the cycle turn. So, this is an issue. They got 91 million of cash and 160 million of receivables on $400 million of debt. That's not bad. Uh let's see what their cash flow is doing here. Yeah, they're going to live 100 million of cash. Let's take a look at their income statement bringing down the share count. I think you're okay there. Next, Kim Arnold, Amphasar Pharmaceuticals. Uh when we get to smaller companies, uh I tend to not do individual stocks because I have no edge on the drug approval. We're generalists. So I would say it's not for me. Next, Christian D. What's your opinion on Howard Hughes? Uh, they'll benefit from the housing recovery. This is a Aman's new vehicle. Um, not for me. Next, Brian Mlan. Uh, now New is a bag of bag of you know what I it's it'll work for bounds, but it's just been so mismanaged. Uh, Ricardo at Goto, first time caller, Goodyear tire. The answer is no. There's too much competition from the Koreans and the Japanese. And the other thing is this is going to work for a bounce and it's going to be fine in the short term. It's just such a crap business and it's just burning too much cash. Revenues are no showing no sign of recovery. So, it's a trade and a gamble, not an investment. VNOM, this is a lower quality energy producer. Uh, I think energy is going to play well in 2026. There's no way I'm buying it up here. So, hard pass. Jack G. Um, Jack, we covered that in the article of the week. What's causing that for next year and why are we not concerned? This is a new investor inquiry. Uh, just uh Greg's UK, Gre G. This is a Dunkin Donuts of the UK. Let's take a look at it. Negative free cash flow. Revenues are growing. Let's take a look at the balance sheet. $45 million of cash. How much debt? half a billion. I I wouldn't do this one. I I like it looks like it wants to bounce and maybe you'll get a double, but they're better uses of your money. Uh, another investor inquiry. Sim Simmon Simon Bu, we own it from much lower levels. Um, another investor and SM Energy from Sagar Kaneka. SM another energy company. We like that theme. Um I don't think this has come down enough relative to the price of energy. There are better energy plays like we like comtock which yes it's up almost triple from where we bought it but it's going higher. Uh national oil well Varco is only up 40 50% from where we bought it. That's going to be a multibagger even from these levels. I would play it that way. These EMP names I don't think have come down enough relative to the price. Plus, this one's burning a ton of cash. So, hard pass. Uh, and that's that. With that said, we'll see everyone next week. Um, we'll I don't know which day, but it will be same place uh either Wednesday or Thursday. In the meantime, make it a great one. Merry Christmas and bye for now. Heat. Heat. Heat. Hey, heat. Hey, heat.
