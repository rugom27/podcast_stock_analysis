  "cleaned_transcript": "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think that uh actually magnificent 7 will do do okay but probably not as well as last year you know last year you had much higher earnings growth this year that uh earnings growth is going to decelerate for the Magnificent 7 from 33% down to 21% and you&#39;re paying 33 times uh 33 times earnings so I think the theme for 2025 could be the last shall be first and you could start to look at some sectors that really underperformed in 2024 before we get to those Kenny you weigh in do you see mag 7 as maybe not the biggest performer for 2025 I I I agree with Tom I think they&#39;re gonna I think they&#39;re still going to perform well I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see a repeat of what happened in 2024 but I think there&#39;s another group within Tech that&#39;s really starting to raise its head and that&#39;s the quantum Computing side there&#39;s been a lot of talk about over the last couple of weeks a lot of very interesting names they&#39;re having really really interesting action uh some of these stocks really being gobbled up because of what Quantum means for the future of AI and how it&#39;s going to continue to change kind of that landscape so while I agree with Tom that I don&#39;t think the mag 7&#39;s going to continue to have the great great year I&#39;m certainly not a seller of the mag s at all yeah that makes sense Thomas so talk to me what you mean the last shall be first explain well if you look at two sectors that dramatically underperformed healthc care and materials were both only up low single digits in 2024 but if you look forward to 2025 they have among the highest expected earnings growth Healthcare is going to grow earnings 20.4% uh percent materials is going to grow earnings 17.4% so we think there&#39;s a lot of opportunity there and we think it&#39;s consistent with value could start to see a bid those unmagnify could could start to see a bid in 2025 it&#39;s the cheapest value has been relative to growth since 2000 and since 1980 which were two generational opportunities to buy value Kenny do you agree with that particularly when it comes to healthcare I I do because that to Tom&#39;s point that those two sectors were the underperformers now if they grow at the rate Tom says they&#39;re going to grow that is the expectation so if they grow at that rate certainly that they should be uh close to the outperformers of 2025 now that&#39;s still up in the air right we have to see if they&#39;re going to if how this how earnings is going to start and what the projections look like to verify or not those earnings growth rate but one way or the other you know to to Tom&#39;s point the last could be first you could see some of these sectors that were the underperforming really kind of take over and I&#39;m assuming in healthcare it&#39;s not just what Eli Lil noo noris giving me my glp1 right there&#39;s got to be a better name in healthcare yeah we like uh xbi which is a basket of biotech stocks the same thing happened in Trump 1.0 as soon as he got elected the the whole basket sold off in anticipation he was going to tear up the Affordable Care Act Right now it&#39;s down because of RFK Jr after the inauguration biotech rallied in 2017 over 75 % the next 12 months we think there&#39;s huge opportunity why deregulation FDA is going to approve more drugs FTC is going to approve more deals big farmer record cash on their balance sheets they need Innovation they&#39;re going to use that cash to buy biotech companies at record low valuation Kenny do you agree that the RFK fear within healthc care will be sort of resolved soon as perhaps they realize that he I don&#39;t know maybe is is it more bark than it is bite no no I I actually think I actually think that having RFK come on as the health Zar might actually be good we&#39;ll see a lot of things maybe uh uh remade right there are there are Cals in this country that aren&#39;t allowed in other countries because of what we put them in here in this country and he&#39;s trying to fight against that to actually make them healthier so I&#39;m all for it but yes I do think we saw like big names in healthcare Lily and all that kind of come off on that original uh RFK uh move but I think we&#39;re going to see a bounce back in some of the biggest uh uh Healthcare names all right well I love having you both great to have you Thomas here in studio and Kenny always fun to see you there uh down in Florida I suppose all right now just to recap Market&#39;s open and we&#39;re back then on Tuesday morning I had the privilege to join uh the great Stuart vanney and that&#39;s Lauren Simonetti absolutely incredible I want to thank Preston miselle and of course Christian dagger for booking me on the show uh absolutely great we had we got to talk about my favorite subject which is NVIDIA and Icarus came into the story for those of you who know a little bit of Greek mythology we&#39;ll talk about that but we also talked about price versus value so we&#39;re going to listen in here let&#39;s bring in Thomas Thomas Hayes um you&#39;re watching a market for us now are Jensen hang&#39;s comments going to push Nvidia to new highs I think so you&#39;re familiar with the story of Icarus the bad news is Jensen Wong is flying too close to the Sun the good news news is his wings are not melting yet and uh I think that the the company&#39;s at $3.7 trillion it wants to probably push to 4 trillion that would be 8% I think Beyond then like every semiconductor cycle right now he has no competition competition is coming and as far as training the robots and training the cars virtually what could go wrong right versus having to put the cars out on the roads you&#39;re putting it in a in a studio we&#39;ll see what happens but on balances is a positive thing for NVIDIA probably pushes a little bit higher from most of the people watching this program who have any investment in the stock market have some money in the Magnificent 7even big tech stocks in a nutshell give us your forecast for the Magnificent s in 2025 okay but not quite as good as 2024 why because earnings growth is decelerating they had 33% earnings growth last year they&#39;re going to have 21% earnings growth this year and the multiple has not yet rated downward you compare that to the broadening of the rally small caps are accelerating earnings growth from 8% to 21% but you only pay 15 16 times for that earnings growth versus the mag 7 you&#39;re still paying 33 times same growth half the multiple where are you putting your money to small caps look better yeah I&#39;ll see about that Tom Hayes great stuff thanks for joining us the international long shoreman&#39;s and we&#39;re back then I had the privilege to join Kristen Scher down at the New York Stock Exchange this was a comprehensive 2020 five Outlook and two picks that we don&#39;t get a lot of opportunity to talk about uh so you&#39;re really going to enjoy this one uh and here we go as we dive into the markets now just one full week into January I do want to bring in Thomas Hayes is a chair and managing member at Grey Hill Capital Thomas great to have you on the show great to be here Kristen and as we start this New Year so much Focus as to what is in store for stocks we&#39;ve seen some choppiness the S&amp;P just about 3% though from its record high what are you watching yeah I think this year is going to be a year of slightly more subdued returns and a rotation so it&#39;s not going to be as easy as parking the money in the indices and watching the mag 7 take you to the promised land I think what you&#39;re seeing is uh the deceleration in the earnings growth of the mag magnificent 7 so they had 33% earnings growth in 2024 that&#39;s going to decelerate down to 21% in 2025 however you&#39;re paying 33 times earning for it so you haven&#39;t seen any D- rating in the mag 7 and if you contrast that to Small caps their earnings growth is going from 8% in 2024 to 21% in 2025 and you only pay 16 times so half the multiple for the same earnings growth I think we&#39;re going to see a lot of fits and starts as the market starts to recognize where the value is uhhuh what does that mean for the rest of the market knowing that the mag 7 is expensive yeah I think you&#39;re going to see huge opportunities under the surface in the unmagnify uh some of the areas that got hit exceptionally hard in December you know we we did see the broadening start in Earnest in July of last year and it really hummed along until November and then there was this abrupt Interruption as yields blew out as uh fears around the FED in December uh we saw the exact same thing in Trump 1.0 right after he got elected the dollar rallied yields rallied between the election and the inaug after the inauguration all of that cooled down MH because we&#39;re talking about yields and the economy I do want to get your take Thomas on the ad print that we saw today because yields have been such a topic of conversation in terms of the direction of this Market 122,000 a little bit less than was what was actually expected by economists what might this mean for that non-farm payrolls report on Friday yeah we keep toggling between bad news is good news good news is good news I think this is a situation given what yields have done we do want to see a little bit cooler labor market to keep the FED possibly in the game number one and to put a cap on yields yields have really blown out a little bit since the election just like we saw in 2016 I think a cooler report if the ADP is any indicator of the non-farm payrolls report on Friday that&#39;s going to be a very good thing for the market yields will start to calm down and compress uh and uh the FED stays in the game and equities will like that International has been out of favor for a long time does 2025 change that I think it&#39;s in line with the theme of what I&#39;m talking about price is what you pay value is what you get you&#39;re going to have over 133% earnings growth in international it&#39;s trading at 15.5 times earnings in the US you&#39;re going to get 14% earnings growth and it&#39;s trading at 22 23 times so the thing that people forget because we we&#39;re all creatures of habit recency bias right since 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year okay only in the zero interest rate environment since 2010 have you seen growth dramatically outperform value so unless you believe we&#39;re going back to zero interest rates you want to have some lower price value in your portfolio you don&#39;t have to ship the boat all the way right away but start to ease into to where where there&#39;s value and opportunity and still growth in earnings power particular stocks then Thomas that are on your radar yeah well I&#39;m known around these parts as turnaround Tom CU I like buying stocks that are down a lot but have an opportunity to turn around one is Advanced Auto Parts they&#39;re an auto retailer they got absolutely decimated they overexpanded they brought in a new CEO Shane o Kelly he came from HD Supply was a $7 billion business so what has he done he&#39;s taken solvency risk off the table he sold the westpack Canada business 1.5 billion paid down debt he&#39;s closing all the non-performing stores in the West Coast that are very spread out so they weren&#39;t getting economies scale 10% of the stores he&#39;s expanding in those regions where they&#39;re number one or number two consolidating the distribution centers they are targeting $630 million of operating income by 2027 the last two times they they traded at that level of operating income it was $180 to $220 stock it&#39;s trading at $45 today so this thing can really grow over the next couple years under the right leadership I want to talk about small caps as well we&#39;ve seen optimism return certainly with c following the election small caps have lagged behind those Magnificent Seven stocks as well we talk about growth we talk about value how does small caps fit in well I think small caps is where you&#39;re seeing the most value one of the names that we love is a company called Cooper standard again two Auto turnarounds for you you know people are are sleeping they listening to this but this is where the opportunity is going to be in 2025 2026 uh this company&#39;s down 90% it had a refinancing risk they got it refinanced in 2022 they do the ceiling systems around the doors boring stuff fluid transfer systems the operating leverage in this business is huge uh all this is is a is a play on volumes increasing we did 16.8 million annualized SAR in December if you remember those Auto numbers surprised everyone the volumes are coming back up the last time they did1 17 million the business earned $7 of $140 stock Stock&#39;s trading at $14 uh they&#39;ve taken $400 million of of uh uh cost out of the business so this thing we leave over the next two years could earn $7 to $10 a share which means you know you apply 10 times multiple it&#39;s it&#39;s really going to move all right Thomas Hayes in from the West Coast Thomas always a pleasure he&#39;s a chair and managing member at Great Hill capital thank you thanks for having me and we&#39;re back and from the NYSC obviously want to thank Kristen Scher want to thank Melissa Montanez and Jeff Cohen for having me on uh there and then\n\nconsolidating the distribution centers they are targeting $630 million of operating income by 2027 the last two times they they traded at that level of operating income it was $180 to $220 stock it's trading at $45 today so this thing can really grow over the next couple years under the right leadership I want to talk about small caps as well we've seen optimism return certainly with c following the election small caps have lagged behind those Magnificent Seven stocks as well we talk about growth we talk about value how does small caps fit in well I think small caps is where you're seeing the most value one of the names that we love is a company called Cooper standard again two Auto turnarounds for you you know people are are sleeping they listening to this but this is where the opportunity is going to be in 2025 2026 uh this company's down 90% it had a refinancing risk they got it refinanced in 2022 they do the ceiling systems around the doors boring stuff fluid transfer systems the operating leverage in this business is huge uh all this is is a is a play on volumes increasing we did 16.8 million annualized SAR in December if you remember those Auto numbers surprised everyone the volumes are coming back up the last time they did1 17 million the business earned $7 of $140 stock Stock's trading at $14 uh they've taken $400 million of of uh uh cost out of the business so this thing we leave over the next two years could earn $7 to $10 a share which means you know you apply 10 times multiple it's it's really going to move all right\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat we are seeing is a deceleration in earnings growth for the Magnificent 7 which kind of has driven the bus looking backwards uh earnings growth dropping from 33% last year to 21% this year however the multiple on the magnif Magnificent 7 has not yet derated uh in accordance with the earnings growth deceleration so I think they&#39;re going to perform less well they&#39;ll do okay this year but if you contrast that to kind of the broadening theme and take a look at the other end of the spectrum going from large cap growth to maybe small cap value uh you look at earnings growth acceleration uh in the small cap 600 earnings growth is growing from 8% last year to 21% this year the difference is for that same 21% earnings growth whether you talk about mag 7 or you talk about small caps uh is the price you pay and on mag 7 you&#39;re still paying 33 times earnings for 21% earnings growth on small cap you&#39;re paying 15 or 16 times earnings for the same 21% earnings growth so I think that this is in fact going to be the year of the stock picker you can look under the surface the idea of setting on autopilot and letting the IND indices take you to Paradise uh is probably going to be a little less well founded in 2025 than it was in 2024 Tom I know from previous conversations you kind of had that that nickname turnaround Tom so I know that value is where you like to be looking talk about your methodology I mean how do you separate a value opportunity from a value trap yeah I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a great thing to to point out and I agree with some of what Chris said we do like to see growth but but price is what you pay value is what you get so we do look for stocks that are down a lot in terms of price and then we try to distinguish whether value has been uh destructed on an equivalent basis and what we find across most of the durable businesses that we get involved in number one they&#39;ve been around for many many years they&#39;ve operated through many cycles they&#39;re going through a temporary impairment like they have through uh different Cycles whether they&#39;re cyclical business or they&#39;ve had different other headwinds in the past uh and the first thing that we do is we look for solvency risk so uh you know if the stock&#39;s down 50 or 60 or 70 or 80% uh the market is saying that there might be an existential crisis so the first thing that we say is are they going to make it through this cycle are they going to live another day so that comes down to balance sheet analysis looking at the debt looking at when the maturities come due and if I can get comfortable with then then the key is going to be leadership do they have a new jockey that has a track record of success that&#39;s a key factor and then\n\n is the price you pay and on mag 7 you're still paying 33 times earnings for 21% earnings growth on small cap you're paying 15 or 16 times earnings for the same 21% earnings growth so I think that this is in fact going to be the year of the stock picker you can look under the surface the idea of setting on autopilot and letting the IND indices take you to Paradise uh is probably going to be a little less well founded in 2025 than it was in 2024 Tom I know from previous conversations you kind of had that that nickname turnaround Tom so I know that value is where you like to be looking talk about your methodology I mean how do you separate a value opportunity from a value trap yeah I think that's that's a great thing to to point out and I agree with some of what Chris said we do like to see growth but but price is what you pay value is what you get so we do look for stocks that are down a lot in terms of price and then we try to distinguish whether value has been uh destructed on an equivalent basis and what we find across most of the durable businesses that we get involved in number one they've been around for many many years they've operated through many cycles they're going through a temporary impairment like they have through uh different Cycles whether they're cyclical business or they've had different other headwinds in the past uh and the first thing that we do is we look for solvency risk so uh you know if the stock's down 50 or 60 or 70 or 80% uh the market is saying that there might be an existential crisis so the first thing that we say is are they going to make it through this cycle are they going to live another day so that comes down to balance sheet analysis looking at the debt looking at when the maturities come due and if I can get comfortable with then then the key is going to be leadership do they have a new jockey that has a track record of success that's a key factor and then finally  is free cash flow do they have enough Runway to execute on the turnaround plan because obviously it's been mismanaged to some degree or the stock wouldn't be down 80% you know you but but these are durable businesses whether we're talking about you know Disney that was at one point down 60% Disney's not going anywhere Boeing 70% uh these are high quality durable businesses that fall fell on rough times but they're not going anywhere anytime soon so um uh now to distinguish between a value trap I think people get caught in that just because the price is down means it's cheap and that's not always necessarily the case often times a a stock that's down a lot deserves to be down a lot and may uh face an ex existential crisis so that's something that you need to be able to discern from experience and doing proper analysis and not just looking at price and two is uh doing Lazy asset analysis where you say well the the breakup Parts uh alone is worth more than the price that it's trading at but there's no Catalyst for a recovery of growth there's no turnaround story there's no new leadership and I think that's where people get stuck in quote unquote value traps and and by the way many of the greatest value traps are broken growth stocks okay that never ever recover people forget that as it relates to Value generally um what what I see in the market right now is people uh blinded by recency bias in that because since 2010 growth has outperform value therefore it's always going to P persist meaning what's happened in the recent past is going to persist and um if you look back to 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4 and a half % per year per year including this aberrational uh zero interest rate policy environment and my my kind of view t\n\nis free cash flow do they have enough Runway to execute on the turnaround plan because obviously it's been mismanaged to some degree or the stock wouldn't be down 80% you know you but but these are durable businesses whether we're talking about you know Disney that was at one point down 60% Disney's not going anywhere Boeing 70% uh these are high quality durable businesses that fall fell on rough times but they're not going anywhere anytime soon so um uh now to distinguish between a value trap I think people get caught in that just because the price is down means it's cheap and that's not always necessarily the case often times a a stock that's down a lot deserves to be down a lot and may uh face an ex existential crisis so that's something that you need to be able to discern from experience and doing proper analysis and not just looking at price and two is uh doing Lazy asset analysis where you say well the the breakup Parts uh alone is worth more than the price that it's trading at but there's no Catalyst for a recovery of growth there's no turnaround story there's no new leadership and I think that's where people get stuck in quote unquote value traps and and by the way many of the greatest value traps are broken growth stocks okay that never ever recover people forget that as it relates to Value generally um what what I see in the market right now is people uh blinded by recency bias in that because since 2010 growth has outperform value therefore it's always going to P persist meaning what's happened in the recent past is going to persist and um if you look back to 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4 and a half % per year per year including this aberrational uh zero interest rate policy environment and my my kind of view there is uh value and growth are tied at the HIP number one so it's it's not either or I don't buy something because it's a value stock or because it's a growth stock I buy because I'm getting a lot of value for uh Less Price than than the Alternatives highest and best use of the capital uh and I think that unless you believe that we're going back to zero interest rate policy or close to it uh not having some element of value and or International which is also trading at low multiples uh and small caps Etc is is um maybe a little risky at the moment if you got all your eggs in one basket because I think we are in a period of regime change and and that's going to create a lot of opportunities a lot more opportunity in 493 stock then in seven got it Tom I gotta ask you about your first pick I mean it's one of those names that just can't stay out of the news and not in a good way so uh sell me on Boeing here yeah well Boeing is uh is what we call a legal duopoly uh between Airbus and Boeing they deliver 99% of the commercial aircraft uh as far as the recent crashes which have been terrible they're predominantly concentrated to the older planes you know the risk the fear was that it was run the 737 Max which has had a ton of problems but they got rid of the old CEO fortunately we've got Kelly ortberg in who has an engineering background versus a sales background or financial engineering background and that's a good thing he's on the floor in Seattle he's fixing all of the problems he solved the uh the labor union strike and when he was at Rockwell Collins before he came here he created a lot of value for shareholders uh Rockwell Collins quadrupled in value for shareholders before it was sold in a period of six years he's a turnaround specialist uh they have a half a trillion doll backlog I mean imagine buying a business that had 10 years of demand that they couldn't possibly fulfill uh that they didn't have the capacity to fulfill all at once it's it's a great problem you got Airlines waiting and sure they can get angry and say you know the landing gear didn't come down right or the door had a problem Etc and they're working on fixing all of that but at the end of the day they can say fine I'm taking all my business to Airbus and rather than wait 10 years they're going to wait 20 years for their planes so that's not an option what they have to do is work with Boeing and that's what you've seen whether it's Southwest whether it's everything else and and the commonality across all the carriers is they have utmost confidence in Kelly ortberg's engineering PR safety uh excellence and turning the company around so with a stock down that's uh down that materially some you know 70 something percent it fell maybe Peak to trough uh and uh you have a business that's going to get back to free cash flow positive they raised uh $20 billion of cash to take solvency risk off the table all the components that I look for turnaround Tom looks for in a turnaround situation are perfectly in place pricing power uh durable sustainable moat performs through Cycles uh pricing power uh it's all there you just have to be patient now you play the time Arbitrage game and most people can't wait two to three years for a double uh but we're patient we like to do that rinse repeat over and over and we think Boeing is going to be one of our next ones uh Tom I I want to get back to your last pick um you know my household may or may not have spent some time on the website this holiday season uh it's Etsy obviously a lot of people know what the company does what's your case there yeah this is another one of my favorites down 80% uh we like to buy things down quite a bit but what's very interesting is the price is down 80 80% but like I say price is what you pay value is what you get uh they certainly their growth rate decelerated postco they had a huge surge in covid uh they are the fourth most trafficked e-commerce site in the US behind uh obviously Amazon Walmart and eBay 92 million users but what's beautiful about their business is it's a niche product handmade customized named uh products so it's not a race to the bottom in me too products where you're just competing on price which they couldn't compete against Amazon and Amazon had tried to compete with them years ago and realized they couldn't and got out of the business so uh and then you got a winner like Josh Silverman who was successful at eBay with shopping.com uh founded Evite sold that to Barry Diller over at IAC interactive and then when he was at Skype he grew 300 million users so um you know you have a situation where they made a couple they had the huge growth they've been able to keep that level of free cash flow keep the level of peak level of covid revenues and it's now trading at about a nine times free cash flow so they got so much cash gushing in healthy balance sheet a turnaround in plan they've got this gift mode they've better curated the website they're growing internationally they're focused on men they've got all these initiatives in place that are getting traction but at the same time they're buying in all the float so uh they just announced a b doll buyback they bought in about 9% of the shares in 2024 so effectively just from the free cash flow they could buy in the whole entire company in about you know nine nine years and uh and that alone if they didn't grow but it does look like growth is re accelerating and this is the perfect uh combination of characteristics that we look for in turnaround situations so we think this is going to be a great one over the next couple of years perfect and we're back so there 's not a whole lot more I need to say about the markets and by the way two of our picks were in here a shout out to Jeff Adams who wrote up our uh Boeing and Etsy uh from our from our previous podcast and articles was

Gupta and karolina Mandel for including me in their article on Reuters this week and on to our\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nCharlie Munger quote our job is to find a few intelligent things to do not to keep up with every damn thing in the world no one could say it better than Charlie Munger I want to talk a little bit about earnings growth uh for 2025 this has been a theme you heard it in a couple of the interviews particularly I think with Taylor rigs how healthc care had uh the worst performance Healthcare materials had very low performance in 2024 we expected to have uh a great performance in 2025 and you can get a sense of why they had you know di Minimus performance is because they had di Minimus earnings growth so in 2024 Healthcare grew earnings 4.1% uh that was you know more than half less less than half of what the S&P grew 99.5% and then materials grew negative 99.5% so so it makes some sense even Industrials didn&#39;t grow that much uh it makes some sense that these were the laggards and what grew uh Tech certainly had um um big growth 177% we sold off our uh our um uh Google and Amazon that we bought in Fall of 2022 during the summer they didn&#39;t do a whole lot more after that by the way it was effectively dead money uh after that they they&#39;ve started to move up a little bit and com services so they had the best earnings growth and they had the best performance however if you look into 2025 two of the top four expected earnings growth are healthc Care at 20.5 and materials at 17.0 so that&#39;s where there&#39;s opportunities we uh Express the materials we talked about through albam Maro we express the healthc care through xbi biotech if you recall uh during Trump when he got elected uh biotech and Healthcare so off in those two months because he was going to rip up the Affordable Car Act they rallied bigly uh as he would say 75% for biotech in the next year after the inauguration so that&#39;s how we&#39;re expressing that we also have Baxter which we&#39;re excited about uh Tech is also going to grow the key is how much is already priced in which we talked about in some of the interviews so we&#39;re not going to repeat that so uh Industrials is going to grow 18.8% we got exposure to that through the Stanley Black and&amp; Deckers of the world through the anax through the um uh you know Cooper standard in in in a certain way uh Etc so so we&#39;ve got all that energy is going to grow a little bit but not much we&#39;re still looking for some opportunity there um consumer discretionary which we talked about months ago when no one wanted it they&#39;ve outperformed so lots priced in there but this is where you&#39;re going to find the uh the real opportunity and the ones that were left behind that are now going to have the earnings growth so these things are not Mysteries this is why they outperform and why we get positioned for them but just as a friendly Public Service Announcement which we&#39;ve been talking about for many podcasts now is not to get faked out right now because crazy town is happening uh Gulf of America we&#39;re GNA Co-op the Panama Canal uh Canada is going to be the 51st state and Wayne Gretzky is going to be the governor not a bad idea by the way uh and uh what else are we going to do Greenland so you know this is silly stuff on on a headline by headline basis some of its diversions there&#39;s a semblance of Truth to some of it that makes sense of course uh how much of it will get done remains to be seen but this is the same time a type of Crazy Town speculation that you saw after Trump got elected in Trump one uh that as tariff man Baba sold off from 107 down to 84 by the way it&#39;s kind of interesting that Baba has done effectively the exact same thing since he got elected uh down to the low 80s and then it uh uh over the next 12 months less than 12 months it went from 84 to 187 after the election so uh it doesn&#39;t have to repeat and this is uh certainly you know not it&#39;s just to tell you that during those weird periods of uncertainty same with kweb um same with uh same with a lot of these healthc care biotech sold off big right after he got elected rallied the next year uh and so on and so forth energy did poorly but uh I&#39;m keeping an open mind on energy if something really comes a fat pitch down the middle it&#39;s just there&#39;s not enough upside for me to take the risk right now relative to some of the other opportunities in the portfolio and that uh we were able to allocate to so um so this is this is just normal stuff Staples sold off a lot there you know I&#39;m seeing some Staples I&#39;ve got my eye on the Hershey&#39;s I&#39;ve got my eye on the cokes I&#39;ve got my eye on uh a lot of these companies that have sold off that may be opportunities after the you know getting positioned ahead of the election but we we&#39;ve got that exposure that will benefit from healthc care we was going to rip up the Affordable Care Act afterwards uh huge huge run over 50% the next 12 months uh and so on and so forth so everything they thought would do well did poorly like energy everything I thought would do poorly did well so keep an open mind for the next few weeks don&#39;t do anything stupid uh if you&#39;ve got cash to put to work now is the time if you&#39;re picking wisely uh the opportunity window that was created by a once in a 100 Year event the generational opportunity the window is closing now we are set for takeoff and uh many of you have strapped on board and by the way congratulations to everyone that came this week some some of you are already approved funded and we&#39;ve been able to deploy in the last couple of days so super excited for you super excited for all the clients that are with me positioned in the same way for a rocket ship I you know I think this is going to be the most exciting year uh not for indices but for what we do and we&#39;re going to see some charts and correlations that kind of bear that out so let&#39;s go to our some of our charts here uh this is from Chris verone R to be December to be lower 20% of the time but it&#39;s January that has the more important role in setting the market tone for the next 6 months uh when January is positive the average 6mon forward S&amp;P performance is 6.9% so that&#39;s kind of a big deal as far as when December is negative it has less of an impact uh moving forward so so we&#39;ll keep an eye on January\n\neverything they thought would do well did poorly like energy everything I thought would do poorly did well so keep an open mind for the next few weeks don&#39;t do anything stupid uh if you&#39;ve got cash to put to work now is the time if you&#39;re picking wisely uh the opportunity window that was created by a once in a 100 Year event the generational opportunity the window is closing now we are set for takeoff and uh many of you have

Bank estimates of what rates would do uh nearly every single time uh uh cide was too pessimistic meaning they thought rates would stay much higher than they actually did you can see all these estimates and then what actually happened rates came down dramatically all these estimates that rates would be higher they stayed low higher low higher low Stay Stay higher low stay higher lower so uh you know we&#39;re kind of in the we&#39;re still in the camp that was a unconventional view last year that rates would probably they&#39;d probably stopped cutting around three and a half to 4% uh on the FED funds rate but now that&#39;s becoming more consensus so we&#39;ll see what happens but I think this was a really useful exercise that uh um don&#39;t be surprised if rates go lower than you think and bonds get bit higher and no one right now no one because you&#39;re getting the exact same fake out that we&#39;ve covered the last three weeks uh in the dollar rally and yields rallying after the Trump election like in 2016 and then after the inauguration what happened dollar rolled over weakened for the next year bonds got bid Yi compressed there are zero people talking like that right now everyone thinks it&#39;s the end of the world and I think what you&#39;re going to find is the opposite is true\n\nhere is Bank estimates of what rates would do uh nearly every single time

you&#39;re going to find is the opposite is true\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nmoving along this is bespoke S&P 500 2.6% decline was the worst end to a year since 1952 you know you had Industrials down 10% in December I mean you had this beautiful broadening from January from July through December uh then December you know after the election and with the FED stuff it just you know unraveled a acute Interruption it will resume it&#39;s just going to be after the after the inauguration and things settle down um yeah worst than to a year since 1952 that&#39;s pretty mindboggling another bullish sign in energy let&#39;s see small speculators are short natural gas for the first time since uh 2001 just as natural gas was breaking out this is super exciting ladies and Gentlemen We love comto some guy emailed me or dm&#39;d me on LinkedIn if you have an AMA question send it in at hedge fund tips.com please don&#39;t DM me unless you&#39;re a client you can call my cell phone if you&#39;re a client but um uh put it in on the uh on the website if uh if you want me to answer it but I&#39;m going to address it because he said you know is comto too late to get in you know we were pounding the table on Comstock at $78 $9 on this podcast now I think it got up to like19 or $20 and he says is it too late I think we&#39;re just getting started in in the cycle now uh you know it&#39;s up over 100% in a short period of time so but I think if you step back and we&#39;ve talked about proved and unproved reserves as it relates to that it&#39;s nowhere near its liquidation value you you saw what it did in 2000 same type of situation this thing can run for a long long time uh would I be a buyer at at you know $19 after it&#39;s rallied from 7 in like a few you know in a very short period of time since we&#39;ve been talking uh I&#39;d probably wait for a little bit of a pullback maybe back to 15 or 16 but you may never get it and uh you know I will start to evaluate where we are versus intrinsic value uh much higher than now but you know if I tell you to get in at $20 when I was telling you that you know about it at 789 and then it pulls back to 15 you know most people flip out because they don&#39;t know what they own um it doesn&#39;t really matter but if I was late to the party I&#39;d probably wait for a pullback and if it went to you know 50 60 70 without me I&#39;d be perfectly happy with that I could care less so there are plenty of opportunities so that&#39;s not the only one but it&#39;s interesting in terms of sentiment how people you know no one&#39;s interested at 789 except for the clients who give me money because they see the opportunities and they they&#39;re like let&#39;s go you know and uh you attract what you are bottom line if you&#39;re a winner you attract winners that&#39;s how it works and um and that&#39;s what I have with my clients they just unbelievable group of people that are just crushing it in the real world and um and and I&#39;m just uh honored to be a partner with them and uh and grow this over time so um so that&#39;s natural gas this is an amazing chart okay so this is all the idiots that are shorten the hole they&#39;re going to get their you know what&#39;s reamed uh and what what are we back to if those of you been with me for two months 2001 baby this is this is so many similarities it&#39;s so exciting because from 2001 to 2007 Emerging Markets China value outperform growth SM small outperform large you can&#39;t sell that narrative anywhere anytime any place and you won&#39;t be able to until 3 4 5 years from now after it&#39;s up triple and you get like the guy dming you after the thing&#39;s up over 100 150% is it too late um and then the beauty of those people is that it pulls back the minute they get in after 100% move it pulls back 25% the people that are in from you know 100% ago they don&#39;t care uh they just wait it out and then they get another double whereas the guy who got in late sells sells down 25% and misses it again then buys up again and the same thing&#39;s going to happen with Baba I I just I I almost can&#39;t wait for I I can&#39;t wait for Baba I I just want want to see all these people chase up at 200 and um and that&#39;s the story but corporate net interest payments near record lows so that is not what you see at recession time uh January is historically a strong month for the market so we&#39;ll see if we get some follow through here S&P annual performance 1953 to 2024 so you can see uh it wouldn&#39;t be abnormal to get a bunch of good sticks together like you got in the late &#39;90s but we should be open-minded for more subdued returns this year uh on the indices I think on you know there was so much money made in 2000 in 2001 and 2002 when when uh when people were losing 90% of their money in amazon.com by the way it&#39;s not because Amazon was a bad business the fundamentals were still improving it&#39;s just they paid too much money for what would ultimately take place 10 years down the road um you know people think that if you&#39;re cautious on a stock you&#39;re you&#39;re negative on the narrative and that has nothing to do with it it&#39;s price is what you pay value is what you get and um I think all of these things that are you know happening now with AI and Robotics and automated driving are going to change the world they&#39;re just not going to do it tomorrow and uh and these things are pricing like they&#39;ve been doing it already for 10 years uh and that&#39;s why you get the first wash out of a cycle and uh and then you buy it we&#39;ll be buying it when they&#39;re quote unquote value stocks when what they&#39;re promising now actually starts to happen the stocks will be down when it&#39;s actually happening in reality those stocks will be down 80% we&#39;ll be buying them hand over fist and that&#39;s where you get the real run like you got in Amazon in the you know post great financial crisis took a long time for that stock to recover uh ex growth is leading value by nine percentage points so what you can see\n\nI can't wait for Baba I just want to see all these people chase up at 200 and um and that's the story but corporate net interest payments near record lows so that is not what you see at recession time uh January is historically a strong month for the market so we'll see if we get some follow through here S&P annual performance 1953 to 2024 so you can see uh it wouldn't be abnormal to get a bunch of good sticks together like you got in the late '90s but we should be open-minded for more subdued returns this year uh on the indices I think on you know there was so much money made in 2000 in 2001 and 2002 when when uh when people were losing 90% of their money in amazon.com by the way it's not because Amazon was a bad business the fundamentals were still improving it's just they paid too much money for what would ultimately take place 10 years down the road um you know people think that if you're cautious on a stock you're you're negative on the narrative and that has nothing to do with it it's price is what you pay value is what you get and um I think all of these things that are you know happening now with AI and Robotics and automated driving are going to change the world they're just not going to do it tomorrow and uh and these things are pricing like they've been doing it already for 10 years uh and that's why you get the first wash out of a cycle and uh and then you buy it we'll be buying it when they're quote unquote value stocks when what they're promising now actually starts to happen the stocks will be down when it's actually happening in reality those stocks will be down 80% we'll be buying them hand over fist and that's where you get the real run like you got in Amazon in the you know post great financial crisis took a long time for that stock to recover uh ex growth is leading value by nine percentage points so what you can see here is  that what I talked about with Kristen and others is that this is an aberration right here this outperformance and growth versus value this happened in the Zer zero interest rate policy environment uh if you believe rates are going back to zero then fine you should bet on this H persisting but data going back to 1927 value outperforms growth by 45% per year that's where fortunes are made and by the way going back to 2021 remember when you had the concentration of all that Tech well for the next seven years value outperformed growth by about 100% if you add up all these numbers so um take the other side I mean maybe it takes five more years for that flip to happen that's that's certainly possible but not probable based on uh how far the rubber band is stretched four-year presidential election cycle weekly sweet spot so you have post elction here a little bumpiness the first half and then it drives higher uh interestingly here so you can see the different indices and so on four-year presidential cycle midterm year week and sweet spot so post election little weakness q1 strong Q2 uh and so on and so forth and then um the midterm next year should be a lot more challenging uh and I I would almost think yeah we'll we'll take it as it comes but uh I'm I'm way more C cautious about next year but wouldn't surprise me if we extend because this bull market is so young um and we had the recession in 2020 and 2022 already that we get some push forward because you usually get one every 4.1 years so we got two in two years which gives us like six years of run way um and we're two years in so I I would you know let's let's see how things play out there are a lot of variables here I mean if we if we if we if we ship tanks into Greenland we might have to re-evaluate Chinese assets aren't off to a good start what that says about economic stimul oh this why did I post this because our friend is back she must have been on vacation uh in India or something because she's back to bash China and uh uh without fail here she goes uh us private construction spending starting to turn up uh percentage of S&P 500 members above their 200 day moving averages so this is where you want to be buyers not sellers uh just looking at the odds above the 20-day moving average again the nysse stocks above the 20-day moving average so this is you know this is where you see saw the October 2000 lows the fall 2022 lows where we were pounding the hell and then March 2020 3 and by the way we picked up a ton of smart people back then both in October 2022 and in March of 2023 sending in money when the market was in turmoil because they were listeners to the podcast I said now now now just like I'm saying now now now before the before the inauguration let's go let's go these things are priced for death this is this 100-year window is closing and it's closing fast uh and there will always be opportunities but you're only going to have a once in a 100 Year event every hundred years and we are getting the re we are getting the residual benefits of how things positioned responding to that and recovering from that that now it's into money-making mode Roaring 20s of the recovery of all these things that got smattered dstock to restock cycle Etc uh active managers selling in the selling down of course as they always do here's earnings estimates solid returns are normal after a 20% gain this is from Ryan Dietrich at Carson average uh after 20 20% gain the average return is 10.6% that is going back to 1950 so I would I think that's a reasonable expectation I've been saying 8 to 12 I like that 10.6 makes a whole lot of sense I mean Automotive Sales thanks my buddy Allen this this is uh um 16.8% annual 16.8 million annualized S I mean obviously you had some pull forward with the Florida and the EV tax credits fear wind down but at the end if we got anything close to 68 I mean it would just be un the thing would at 168 if you got not an annualized but an annual 16.8 which I think we're going to get in the next couple of years uh Cooper earns over 10 bucks a share because of the $400 $500 million of cost they pulled out of it they earn when they were earning seven bucks at the last cycle Peak when we were doing 17.1 million SAR $146 stock 13 or $14 stock now uh as we're ramping up cash flow positive so why are they just what's the overhang the overhang is twofold rates are spiking up after the election which they did in 2016 to 2017 after the inauguration rates will go back down that will alleviate fears about uh refinancing although they don't have any maturities coming due imminently but we want to get them refinanced anyway that'll save additional interest costs which I think they'll be able to do in the first or second quarter while credit spread spreads are at record lows um and then it also helps financing on the cars particularly short rates which is which is also a positive things which helps volumes doesn't help margins for the oems but helps volumes which is all we care about because we make uh the certain amount per car and we make more on hybrids and EES than we do on IC so is that Trend hybrids are crushing it we love it that's more margin than we have in our models so we're excited ISM Manufacturing PMI turning up uh new orders turning up that's good uh and then here we go cyclicals over defensives ISM Manufacturing Pi this is going to be a catch-up play this is going to help Industrials and everything else\n\n so I would I think that's a reasonable expectation I've been saying 8 to 12 I like that 10.6 makes a whole lot of sense I mean Automotive Sales thanks my buddy Allen this this is uh um 16.8% annual 16.8 million annualized S I mean obviously you had

defensives ISM Manufacturing Pi this is going to be a catch-up play this is going to help Industrials and everything else\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the number they expected 16.5 annualized they got 168 this is just super exciting news super exciting news and super exciting news because I've been able to put a lot of new money into it in the 13 which I never thought I would ever be able to do with 16.8 annualized so I am super pumped uh and uh and super hopefully it's going to stay down until after the inauguration because people have these fake fears about tariffs they'll have some real tariffs but they they're always workarounds and things that can be done and passrs and everything else but um I pray that it stays down for another couple weeks so we can get everyone as much of this as humanly possible at a reasonable price uh hybrids time to shine so you can see here this just means more margin than expected so instead of earning $10 a share they could earn $12 per share potentially on 17 to 17.5 million which is the cycle Peak every cycle since 19 going 45 50 years back uh it troughs in the 15s it peaks in the 17s and uh the operating leverage of these businesses is unbelievable uh here are the winners by bran we could care less um Euro oh okay so all leverage funds are short the Euro that's going to absolutely rip higher um you're seeing you know Trudeau as as more and more well I don't even need to get into the reason why the Looney a good thing happened this week that's going to help the Looney uh hang in there for those of you who are Canadian uh Looney is going to have its day in the sun here just remember back to 20 one period Commodities you can't versus global equities can't give away same in 2020 when we were buying Exxon in the 30s when oil was trading negative so now it's the all borrows of the world it's other opportunities to play the Commodities trade uh Comstock of course and um and this is what helps the Emerging Markets countries and uh the Emerging Markets currencies when this inflects which it will which it shall which is also a function of Chinese stimulus and everything kicking in there which we're going to cover cta's exposure to oil shorten the whole I think oil's going up uh selling pressure in the energ sector there you go selling in the whole most crowded Longs index so look it's it's um it's in overshoot mode it can stay extended in overshoot but you don't have to play the pain of discipline or the pain of regret your choice uh this shows expensive relative to the last 10 years versus cheap relative what's cheap S&P 400 which is mid S&P 600 which is uh small uh and what's expensive growth and momentum so you can chase the shiny objects and be undisciplined and hope that there's another sucker that comes in behind you to lay it off to but uh chances are you'll be holding the bag that's that's what I have to say about that global valuations current and 25y year next 12 months price to earnings ratio uh so this just shows China is the cheapest relative to history and relative in absolute terms us is the most expensive keep that in mind when we covered the US versus International Cycles from Cali Cox over at rolz last week that was an awesome chart go back and review that uh if you want to think that us us is going to outperform Forever then you have a very myopic uh short-term view uh grounded in recency bias and that's where you get punished uh moving on corporate spreads this is where miracles happen uh refinancings happen interest expense for companies is at the lowest in years as we covered um and as a reminder for the shiny object crew southc stock bubble this is from December 7 1718 to December 1721 uh this was Isaac Newton not a dumb guy he uh got into South Seas stock bought a little bit he exited at a profit he bought a little bit at 200 exited at 400 his friends got rich at 600 he enters with all his money at 800 it goes to 950 and then he exits at 200 flat broke and this is this is exactly what you're going to see with um Baba you know is is basically what's what's going to happen but what what's more likely is that you know most people will enter here sell on these pullbacks then buy up again sell on the pullback then buy up again sell on the pullback then buy up again sell sell on the pullback at a loss and then start buying and and get smoked so um it's just it's not it's not about being smart or knowing better it's about observing history and learning you know you can learn from your own mistakes but it's a lot more costeffective to learn from watching other mistakes and there's so much written about mistakes throughout history if you'll take some time to educate yourself and experience and nothing beats experience but uh experience coupled with knowledge there's it's it's an unmatchable combination that can just set you up for a lifetime of happiness success and enjoyment let's just put it that way Trump AIDS ready Universal tariff plans with one key change this was uh put out then rebuked it's probably a lot of truth to it he said but only on certain sectors so it looks like the administration is walking back the blanket tariffs that had the whole Market worried Canadian dollar jumps on Trudeau and tariff reports uh so that was a spike up on the uh TR the Tariff announcements and the Trudeau resignation valuations get more lopsided more of that this is S&P equal versus the S&P 500 this is what they call technicians call a double bottom so you had that monster broadening from July through December then the abrupt Interruption uh and this will resume and\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nber 7 1718 to December 1721 uh this was Isaac Newton not a dumb guy he uh got into South Seas stock bought a little bit he exited at

that monster broadening from July through December then the abrupt Interruption uh and this will resume and finally  break out and uh I think 2025 is that year uh this is S&P 500 risk premium everyone keeps talking about this like it&#39;s a bad thing next 12 months forward earning yield minus the 10-year treasury yield and what that implies so they&#39;re saying oh stocks are expensive bad timing

that were cheap took up the reain and dramatically outperformed for the next seven years so this is bullish as hell if you know what to buy or you pay someone who knows what to buy uh a part of the profits to do it for you uh that&#39;s a home run so change in 10-year treasury year seasonality so you know there&#39;s a tendency in the postelection year to have some strength in the yields until uh early March so maybe it persist a little after the inauguration but I think we&#39;re we&#39;re pretty much there when when everyone&#39;s convinced we&#39;re going to 5% it means that the the move is probably done uh presidential cycle and returns year 1 average 6.6 uh median is 8.1% that&#39;s going back to 1928 this is Russell growth versus Russell 1000 value uh and you can see this you know this whole thing of the zero interest rate policy where growth outperformed is the aberration not the rule I can&#39;t reemphasize look at this from 20 2000 value outperform growth by 29% or all right let&#39;s put it the the way it&#39;s written growth underperformed value in 2000 by 29.4% growth underperformed value by 14.8% in 2001 growth underperform value by 12.4% in 20 2002 growth underperformed value by uh less than 1% in 2003 in 2004 growth underperformed value by 10.2% in 2005 growth underperformed value by 1.8% in 2006 growth underperformed value by 13.2% so this is the norm same in the 80s under Reagan 81 growth underperformed 83 84 86 88 growth underperformed um so there you go ladies and gentlemen\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\npremium everyone keeps talking about this like it&#39;s a bad thing next 12 months forward earning yield minus the 10-year treasury yield and what that implies so they&#39;re saying oh stocks are expensive bad timing to invest no the stocks

in meaningfully slower overall payroll growth so tomorrow&#39;s payroll report like I talked about with Kristen if that comes in softer like the ADP report did this week that is going to put a cap on yields and that&#39;s going to change a lot of Dynamics so just suck up the fits and starts for the next couple of weeks it&#39;s just going to be crazy town with\n\ncumulative flows into ETFs as a

going to put a cap on yields and that&#39;s going to change a lot of Dynamics so just suck up the fits and starts for the next couple of weeks it&#39;s just going to be crazy town with headlines  that&#39;s the way Trump likes it and um and then we should get back to some normaly and some beautiful rotation action big beautiful rotation make rotation great again so alternative measures of employment growth slowed in December so again that would imply a softer number tomorrow which keeps the FED in the game which puts a cap on yields all good all right pairwise correlations on a 12-month rolling basis have falling suggesting a more attractive opportunity set for Alpha generation you don&#39;t get these correlations this low until you go all the way back to 2017 right after Trump got elected by the way and all the things that took off which we&#39;re positioned for and then going back to 2001 so look these things don&#39;t repeat exactly but they rhyme like crazy and if you could just pay attention to patterns um it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not rocket science the Magnificent 7 is expected to generate earnings growth of 33% in 2024 which we talked about the rest of it S&P grow 3% so why did Max 7 they dramatically outperformed on earnings in 2024 uh but that&#39;s changing now UNM magnificent is going to low double digits the mag 7 is decelerating actually this is crazy town I thought mag 7 was decelerating to 21% they&#39;re decelerating to 18% and they&#39;re still trading at 33 times whereas the rest of the market is probably trading at 17 18 times with 11% earnings growth and then if you and then next year 16 uh uh mag 7 decelerates again to 16% and mag unmagnify accelerates to 133% so I don&#39;t need to you know here&#39;s all the countries cheapest is China uh most expensive us just another way of looking at it 10year treasury yield prior to First Cut and plus 100 days so historically you get this this bump and then a weakening on balance for the biggest weights this is very interesting treasury yield see Boost from Trump tariff threats so you haven&#39;t seen this type of shortterm boost uh actually this is wild ladies and gentlemen every time so remember we were pounding the table the fourth quarter of last year by TLT and it rallied like crazy off those lows okay so that setup is here again so this is a different way of viewing it other than the commitments of Traders and then when did when does it happen again it happened again in right here after the election before the inauguration and then boom ra yields uh bonds rallied yields compressed so I I don&#39;t know how many different ways to tell you other than I hope you&#39;re listening and uh and I know we&#39;re all going to benefit so that&#39;s why we do this every week here we go um here&#39;s sler over at\n\nthe Magnificent 7 is expected to generate earnings growth of 33% in 2024 which we talked about the rest of it S&P grow 3% so why did Max 7 they

interesting treasury yield see Boost from Trump tariff threats so you haven&#39;t seen this type of shortterm boost ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nover at RBC  thanks to my buddy over there what what do we got here uh okay so this is the S&P 500 yeah I think these things you know that&#39;s basically the max 7 now uh they&#39;re G to they got to consolidate it&#39;s bouncing back up here okay so that&#39;s the daily here&#39;s the equal weight this looks like it&#39;s put in a double bottom ready to move back up to 188 uh this is the NASDAQ kind of hanging out here after a breakout we&#39;ll see what happens with that then you&#39;ve got the Russell 2 2000s came broke out came all the way back in December to check I think this is going to be the story in 2025 sentiment is weakening a little bit then you got Europe has been just been grinding sideways for over a year I think that breaks out this year that&#39;s xus Tokyo week not interested hang saying again we came off those lows in early 2024 and then we checked back at the end of the year I think this is just to stair step higher over time and then just crank completely crank higher over time uh 10-year yield so you know it&#39;s up here against this resistance I think we&#39;re I think we&#39;re pretty much there if we get a few more weeks of hovering up here below five so be it just to bang out all the people shorten the hole suck in more shorts and then absolutely roast them all uh God bless him I can wait a few weeks not a big deal um so that&#39;s that and then you got the dollar same story here up against resistance at the 61.8 if that means anything I could care less uh a few more weeks suck in a lot more Longs and then just roast them and then Canadian dollar starting to come off the boil after Trudeau um I love these overshoots it gets you know it&#39;s just part of the game crude taking a little bit of a bid here on the daily that&#39;s that&#39;s expected gold has been weak everyone wanted it in in the fall now now it&#39;s uh let&#39;s see how that works out uh copper I think this is going to be a long story just like in 2001 I think uh the China stimulus they&#39;ve been P pushing a ton of stuff in the pipeline for a year and a half it&#39;s been peac meal but it&#39;s adding up materially and it&#39;s all going to hit at once and no one&#39;s going to be prepared for it and they&#39;re going to say what happened and and a lot of these stocks are going to double in a year and everyone&#39;s going to be interested in 2016 the best ideas are going to be CH they&#39;re all going to be touting China and international after 100% move and um you know uh that&#39;s the good news I mean I don&#39;t know if 100 I don&#39;t think 100% move is enough for us to be sold sold to you so we&#39;ll ride their exuberance for another year and then we&#39;ll just lay off to all the Johnny come lately but um uh all this stuff is just playing out as anticipated with a little overshoot on a couple but there we are semiconductors consolidating Nvidia we talked about with st uh you know 30 30 40 times sales 5050 times earnings decelerating growth um you know assumption that there will never be competition except every single semiconductor cycle for the last 40 years competition always comes uh a lot of people betting on this times it&#39;s different why because of recency bias because you know they weren&#39;t even through puberty the last semiconductor cycle and you know it&#39;s where we are uh Applied Materials okay so that&#39;s that anything else we want to see on This MC I like these drug stocks I like these big drug stocks Pepsi some of these things uh we&#39;re not doing anything yet you know Colgate probably interesting hasn&#39;t come down enough for us yet that&#39;s a great long-term business to own set and forget dividend Aristocrat grower a lot of these things haven&#39;t come down enough these High Flyers this ge story is perfect uh we were pounding on GE no one was listening I will say that uh I think this is going to be very similar to the Boeing turnaround story so when everyone&#39;s giving up on it uh that was the case with GE for sure and then the new CEO turns it around and Kelly ortberg is the guy Rockwell Collins six bagger in four four bagger in six years uh with Rockwell Collins wealth generator turnaround specialist uh as you can tell we bet a lot on our jockey all right so that was good stuff from slomer this just just keeping in p uh perspective what we&#39;ve been talking about since 2000 is we&#39;re only halfway through the cycle everyone was panicked here I said we got 10 plus more years now we&#39;ve got six plus more years and\n\nnow the game has changed you got 12,000 uh people turning 35 every year buying houses cars babies uh washing machines all that stuff&#39;s going to continue for five plus years until they&#39;re 40 is when the spending slows same thing happened in the roar in the 50s same thing happened in the Roaring 20s uh and so on and so forth and then we&#39;ll get extremely defensive uh in the early 2030s and we we will take the fortune that we make over the next 5 six years for clients and for ourselves and uh we will uh uh be able to buy unbelievable businesses uh forever businesses at you know 50 70 90% off um it&#39;ll be like it is right now for certain sectors it will be for many sectors and um and uh and that&#39;ll be unbelievable run so you know in the early 30s if I&#39;m in cash and the market keeps going up and up and I&#39;m talking about shorts and you&#39;re going to say Tom&#39;s lost his touch he used used to be so optimistic what happened to Tom you know he was a one of the greatest uh e Equity investors and and now he&#39;s just this pessimistic short what happened and then by 20 by by 2034 uh you&#39;ll be like oh okay all right so you know turnaround time is often early by the way turnarounds work both ways ladies and gentlemen uh uh sometimes early but over time mostly right uh you&#39;ll you&#39;ll know what&#39;s going on in the early 20 30s when I when I&#39;m less pessimistic that&#39;s a lot less fun uh I think the next six years is going to be a lot more fun but there we go emerging okay so uh someone sent me this emerging stocks enter correction as Traders weigh US policies um I&#39;m not really going to comment on it I&#39;m just going to show you a chart and you can draw your own conclusions with these uh dog\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nFMC shares pop as kbank says

predicts exponential boom in AI apps for 2025 well thank you for the prediction but being that Alibaba is the number one player we will be the number one beneficiary so appreciate the optimism for your competitor Bloomberg China&#39;s pboc vales more support for Innovation and consumption so again they just keep pushing the ball underwater when they when their hands are released the ball will absolutely pop uh GM Ford report best annual us Sal since 2019 as Auto Recovery continues I love it for Cooper standard people aren&#39;t paying attention and you get that opportunity as we have have been taking advantage of hand over fist pboc reiterates China cut rates Reserve ratio to be cut at appropriate time when is the appropriate time right after the inauguration natural gas stocks have momentum and cold weather so this is uh everyone getting excited after all these stocks are up more than 100% in a few weeks take Warren Buffett&#39;s advice don&#39;t buy any stock in 2025 unless it passes this test two very simple test number one uh Buffett first determines whether he can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out or more the only type of companies you can do that in are not in high flyers or IPOs or new technologies where you&#39;re guessing and praying and hoping and chasing the crowd but for durable businesses that have been through many cycles that have a proven moat and you can understand the cyclicality and how the the fundamentals move relative to the price the fundamentals May deviate 5 10 15% if it&#39;s a big turnaround and the price deviates 80% so we love that I mean that Arbitrage I&#39;ll play all day long for the rest of my life like nobody&#39;s business it&#39;s what I love to do I&#39;m good at one single thing this tiny little Narrow Lane and I don&#39;t deviate I really don&#39;t do private deals I don&#39;t uh invest in it I I just eat my own cooking everything I do everything I talk about is where I put all my money all my money is where my mouth is um and um and then the second test is to buy a stock only if it trades quote at a reasonable price relative to the lower end of his historic earnings range he will buy a stock only if it&#39;s reasonably valued using this approach again if the stock doesn&#39;t pass this second step he moves on so you know I have a different filter which is pretty much the same filter number one is um if this so I&#39;m more about protecting the downside the upside takes care of itself if this stock was to go to zero would they take me out on a stretcher because there can always be things that that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and there&#39;s no way you could know so that deals with sizing and risk so if you have a you know High conviction 8 10 12% position and the world ends and it takes you out you got your other nine that are doubles or triples over the next few years using the same framework they&#39;re going to more than amply compensate uh the good news is you know the DI Minimus probability of that ever happening is so small but you have to hedge against the possibility ever happening so that&#39;s number one number two is if I was to walk into the boardroom of this company and offer to buy the entire company at the price it was currently Mo marked in the public markets would the board call security to have me escorted out of the building because I was absolutely crazy and insulting to offer to buy the company at that price and if the answer is no meaning they would take the meeting because they think that might be a fair price then I&#39;m not interested I&#39;m not buying it and um and that you just learn with experience over time and that&#39;s why they call me turnaround Tom uh Chinese companies have sidest stepped Trump&#39;s tariffs they could do it again Ulta beauty stock jumps new CEO goes a long way it&#39;s another one we&#39;ve got our eyes on my kids are in Ulta and Sephora all the time uh China&#39;s Central Bank outlines monetary policies for 2025 emphasizing expanding domestic demand of which Alibaba is the number one toll taker for the middle class and upper class quality items Teemu sells the garbage disposable crap to poor people uh and uh their numbers as we&#39;ve said for many months either unsustainable which is now proving to be the case or unreliable which um we shall see stabilizing expectations and stimulating Vitality to ensure sustained Improvement in the Chinese economy uh AI has a cost problem what it means for the other for the stock market and five things to know so what they&#39;re just saying is that every $200 a month subscription that Sam Alman sells he loses money on because every search query costs 10 times the cost of a Google Search and um uh $1,000 of computing power per task so it&#39;s just a losing business and then the people that are buying all these chips are not getting an amp ample return on investment which is why you&#39;re getting decelerating uh earnings growth all these great things are going to come true okay just like all the great things that Amazon have done have come true the difference was Amazon fell 90% from 2000 to 2003 or whatever it was despite fundamentals kind of improving because they were people were already paying as if all the things that came true over the next 15 years were already happening and um uh it always takes a little longer all these things take a little bit longer so getting in on the second phase when people have thrown in the towel is really uh a great opportunity China confirmed xinping and Donald Trump have been in touch since the US election Trudeau resignation opens the door for Trump going easier on trade tariffs with Canada especially if Wayne Gretzky becomes Governor you can&#39;t make this stuff up I think I think would be great by the way you know he&#39;s a winner what else do you want to know uh Disney links inks deal to combine Hulu Plus live TV business into fubo I like this deal I use fubo because they have better Sports than YouTube TV I liked YouTube TV I use fubo uh and they let me screen screenshot uh some of the things when I do TV Etc which YouTube blocked me and all that stuff so uh they&#39;re too cute by half and um and then and and the interesting thing was I kept looking at fubo to buy and I just couldn&#39;t get my hands around I&#39;m like they&#39;re kind of you know you know kind of flailing in the wind and now with this deal we own 70% of fubo through our ownership in Disney I love this it&#39;s just like all the great things we own through Alibaba without actually having to own it uh directly uh on a standalone basis so this is a home run uh and that&#39;s that so Bob Iger strikes again good job there Disney

media wanted to do a gener update we haven&#39;t covered that a lot because we you know if you&#39;ve listened for a while you know we don&#39;t spend much time talking about our winners we we uh we&#39;ve been talking about uh generx well below $100 and then it shot up to 195 now it&#39;s at 160 look all you need to know here um we can go through every word of the transcript which we did but uh we don&#39;t have time for that um is free cash flows accelerating and free cash flows now at the levels you saw when it was a $524 stock it&#39;s at $158 so you know getting back to 200 and Beyond is easy peasy and then the question is where does the growth stall out on the next cycle is it is the stock 250 is it 300 does it get back to New all-time highs that&#39;s going to take a while I think new all-time Highs but uh this is the same story story uh over and over and uh they continue to bring the share count down earnings are recovering after a trough in 2023 they work through the dstock cycle now we&#39;re back into the restock cycle going to be at record earnings by 2026 2027 free cash flow per share is going through the roof sales per share have re accelerated to all-time highs because they brought in the share count and they&#39;re just dominating residential commercial and Industrial you see them every single way and they got their hands and the the whole Eco stuff that uh you know it&#39;s kind of a waste of time but they got to be there as just a blockout competition and this is the cycle of gener they have these huge growth runs uh like they did into 2021 they consolidate for a few years with a little bit of lower Revenue they recover after a couple down years and then back to the next growth cycle same thing rinse repeat and that&#39;s where we are right now just like Boeing no different uh us penetration rate is only 6.25% you can see some of their uh other states are at 21 to 25% like Michigan West Virginia Maine Louisiana where they have reg regular outages everyone has one every 1% additional penetration uh Look at California zero to 3% I mean you think California is going to sell a few generators in the next few months you you bet your bottom dollar when they&#39;re shutting power off in Los Angeles this a one every 1% is a $3.5 billion opportunity so um you know you get 14 more uh percent penetration or let&#39;s just say 10$ 35 billion opportunity I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s where fortunes are made ladies and gentlemen and uh you know the most important chart here which actually blew my mind uh well first one I love this one obviously Sal sales recovering margins recovering free cash flow just off the charts uh almost $500 million of free cash flow for 2020 before you can&#39;t give it away I love this well some people started bidding it it was a double and now it&#39;s come back a little bit so uh you can give it away people were were taking it at 194 uh but um anyway this is what&#39;s really cool because I&#39;m like how you know 6% penetration what what what happens this is the adoption curve of um central air conditioning it looks a lot like it you know in from 1945 to 1950 to 1960 the first 15 years of central air conditioning the penetration rate was only 6.25% uh which is basically 205 to 2024 of uh uh generators Home standby generators and then it just completely hockey sticked after 1965 and went straight from 10% generation uh penetration to 80 8% penetration I think with what you&#39;re seeing with the grids and the demand that AI is going to have on the grids and everything else and air conditioners and everything else the instability and the weather and all that stuff I don&#39;t know if we ever get to 88% but I I I would be surprised if we didn&#39;t get to 30 or 40% over the next 10 15 years you see the same adoption curve with Home Security Alarms we&#39;re basically at zero in 1980 within the first 20 years got up to 19% now at 29% portable generators up to uh went from 0 to 20% so and then home standby generators so I think more and more I think this is going to be a feature when people build new houses as well uh in a more meaningful way you see residential up 27% year on-year if you look at last 12 months up 10.4 net sales up 99.6% on the quarter gross profit up 9% net income up 88% free cash flow up 56.5 5% year onye uh uh and uh last 12 months free cash flow up 178% pretty exciting uh free cash flow last 12 months 584 so nine times I mean anyway so this is exciting here&#39;s the fear and greed Index this is not what you see at tops really could It Go lower before it goes higher yes um and then\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmargins recovering free cash flow just off the charts uh almost $500 million of free cash flow for

demand that AI is going to have on the grids and everything else and air conditioners and everything else the instability and the weather and all that stuff I don&#39;t know if we ever get to 88% but I I I would be surprised if we didn&#39;t get to 30 or 40% over the next 10 15 years you see the same adoption curve with Home Security Alarms we&#39;re basically at zero in 1980 within the first 20 years got up to 19% now at 29% portable generators up to uh went from 0 to 20% so and then home standby generators so I think more and more I think this is going to be a feature when people build new houses as well uh in a more meaningful way you see residential up 27% year on-year if you look at last 12 months up 10.4 net sales up 99.6% on the quarter gross profit up 9% net income up 88% free cash flow up 56.5 5% year onye uh uh and uh last 12 months free cash flow up 178% pretty exciting uh free cash flow last 12 months 584 so nine times I mean anyway so this is exciting\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nhere&#39;s the fear and greed Index this is not what you see at tops really could It Go lower before it goes higher yes\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nTech revised down by about 1% in the last 60 days top 30 weights and communication Services again both of these trading at the highest multiples communication Services was revised up 72 basis points so nothing material on either of those and now on to the\n\nlet's just say all of our raises and our first week of our q1 2025 opening you cannot be better position for what we believe will be a very highly rewarding year in 2025 this view is based on much of the data we&#39;ve shared in recent weeks on our podcast video cast as well as our proprietary methods of expressing and executing upon those views on your behalf we reopened to smaller accounts $1 million plus again starting last week because we want to be fully positioned as soon as possible before the inauguration based on some of the data we have referenced on recent podcast video episodes and will remain open for the next couple of weeks uh I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s no at this point we&#39;re get we&#39;re bumping up so it&#39;s probably not going to be two full weeks but something like a week and a half uh but close no later than the inauguration and that&#39;s probably too late congratulations to all I had the pleasure of speaking with and onboarding in the last week or so after we opened up we begun deploying capital on your behalf uh in a material way and if you&#39;re still in the process of the application approval uh you can call them directly uh it usually takes 24 to 48 hours uh and then we can start to deploy once that hits uh to see if you qualify and take advantage that you click here larger accounts 5 to 10 million can access B service at their preference at any time uh so that&#39;s that it&#39;s opinion not advice do whatever you want talk to your financial adviser let&#39;s talk about earnings are the name of the game uh Tech revised down by about 1% in the last 60 days top 30 weights and communication Services again both of these trading at the highest multiples communication Services was revised up 72 basis points so nothing material on either of those and now on to the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nquestion so if you uh are a fan of the\n\nask me anything\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nask me anything\nquestions\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nlet&#39;s start with number one from Chris C Uber Technologies let&#39;s take a look um this is not the type of I can&#39;t really predict who&#39;s going to win you know you see all these Whos driving around without drivers uh look I mean Dar is running a good business the cash flow continues to grow there&#39;s nothing wrong I just have to guess the future on this one and I don&#39;t like to guess the future so for me it&#39;s no I I think it looks reasonable um at a glance I think it&#39;s more of a trading vehicle than something you want to be in forever but um you know why am I getting this question at 60 instead of at 20 that&#39;s when it was an interesting one so that&#39;s not for me right now now it could be 100 could be 300 could be all that stuff but I&#39;m not going to guess the future I just like things that I can predict with reasonable certainty \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nTom I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on both Burberry and or carrying both luxury plays have been beaten down both change CEOs creative directors potential return a Chinese consumer is there room for a turn around I think so I mean we get a question on Curry on uh uh Burberry every single week I&#39;ve looked at it a few times and I&#39;ve continue to say no because even when China was doing well the stock couldn&#39;t get out of its own way it&#39;s done nothing for basically 12 years so for me and uh and I think that&#39;s consistent with the fundamentals I think it&#39;s just a dead brand and uh you know maybe you can get some miracle worker in there and get a pump for a couple years but look free cash flow is is well below 12 years ago the reason the Stock&#39;s gone nowhere and and uh nothing&#39;s happening is because the cash flow has gone nowhere it&#39;s gone down revenues have gone nowhere they&#39;ve gone down so uh just because the prices gone down doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a cheap stock uh so for me no no real interest CG might be a different story uh k e r i g yeah this thing is still in massive distribution but it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely probably more interesting uh k e r i n g I mean I mean this is not a mystery like the the stock has really gone down with free cash flow so you got to understand the turnaround situation looks like cash flow is starting to recover a little bit let&#39;s take a look at um I think this one let&#39;s see fashion leather goods jul okay Gucci St lauron Anana bad Bion blah blah blah blah yeah this is kind of more interesting it&#39;s a little more Diversified than um yeah I mean it&#39;s training 1.5 T sales uh you got a dividend on here I mean if you if you put a gun in my said head and said pick pick one I&#39;d say uh CG for sure but I don&#39;t think this thing&#39;s going to turn around right away I think this is going to take a couple years to uh find new buyers could be wrong on that but uh you know this is a lot of institutional destruction it&#39;s going to take a long time to rebuild a share base uh Kyle meum hey Tom you mentioned last week that a lot of Yen carry trade funds are focused on the mag s [Music] yeah I mean look if they&#39;re in the S&amp;P 500 they&#39;re focused on the mag 7 so um bottom line is when the Yen carry trade on wines the thing that&#39;s going to get hit the the biggest is the heaviest weights which is the mag7 which also has another reason which is decelerated earnings growth so nothing new there what do you think about GPC I know you&#39;re in investing in Autos like CPS and AAP I mean GPC is a better quality business but you have much less up side with the same amount of risk so uh I know that Mommy and Daddy tell you to buy the best quality company in the industry uh and that&#39;s perfectly fine and good advice uh you know but if you&#39;re looking for doubles and triples over a few years uh you&#39;re not going to get that when everyone&#39;s already seeing what you see and the stock is fully priced so uh for me it&#39;s a pass but if you bought it and held it I don&#39;t think you&#39;d really be disappointed but you&#39;re just not going to get double and triples Jessica Lily thank you for all you do you&#39;re welcome thank you I thought I would chime in as I&#39;ve been a nurse for 25 years when backers manufacturing facility went down due to weather we were completely backordered on IV fluid and no facility anywhere I talked to could get fluids it shows you that they basically have a monopoly on IV fluids so thank you for that feedback um m m uh cus since your interviews with Kiko then David limb to become okay what kind of economic oh you seem to be overall bullish on 2025 what kind of economic DAV surveys yield curves would you make you revaluate your current stance um yeah decline you know earnings coming down uh materially um what opinion would make you feel wrong so Mor is you know reading all the the Doom porn blogs I&#39;m sure and they&#39;re all telling them get out of your stocks blah blah blah um you know I don&#39;t want to be in certain stocks I I I definitely think there could be stocks that get hit hard I just I know what the margin of safety is in my stocks and like literally the market could collapse 50% tomorrow and I wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable in any one of my positions because I&#39;m buying them at with such a margin now might the price get impaired for a short period of time sure the price could get impaired for a short period of time but when you&#39;re running on low and no leverage it&#39;s not an issue it&#39;s you you still own the same percentage of the business uh and Etc so um you know for all these people saying the guild covers onver there were toast uh we&#39;re going to have a recession let me remind you we had the recession that everyone is looking for in 2022 with two quarters of negative GDP growth which followed a recession in 2020 we had two recessions that is the definition of of a technical recession in 2 years average is 4.1 so we pulled forward eight years of recessions in two years we have Runway we have liquidity when the facts change I will change my mind right now there&#39;s nothing that supports that fact other than a bunch of people trying to sell you clicks and take you out of your stocks at the exact wrong time now if your portfolio is paler in Nvidia good luck you may experience a DE while a good portion of the other stocks go up or you may experience a double I can&#39;t predict that because I can&#39;t value it I cannot predict the future so those are not stocks for me and again I will say and continue to reiterate there are many paths to the top of the mountain my path is not the only way there are plenty of ways to make money in and out of the stock market I just do the one that I am very good at and that I have confidence and I can sleep like a baby at night because I know what I own and they have relatively predictable business models cash flows revenues Etc now you can you can go into the prediction game and make a ton of money gamble in your right you could also hit you know 31 on the roulette wheel and you know multibag your money and your bet but the odds of reliably predicting the future and guessing on the next Technologies are limited which is why Buffett never did it and he was a greatest compounder of wealth in the history of humankind so uh okay Jesse James question on TMO as you think healthcare would recover uh would someone do well buying some more high quality life SS like thermofisher uh uh I think thermofisher is historically pretty good business uh so again this is a 15 bagger in 10 years where were you at $40 why now I mean let&#39;s take a look at the fundamentals doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be a 15 bagger again but odds don&#39;t favor it um yeah so cash flows have been flat for four years you know it&#39;s it&#39;s fully valued it&#39;s an okay business but I mean this is the type of thing that if you&#39;re lucky it goes from 5 544 maybe to 750 but like if if anything goes wrong this thing could fall to 250 in a minute so like you&#39;re you&#39;re okay but I just don&#39;t see the a I look for asymmetry so for me there&#39;s no asymmetry like there&#39;s always the risk of what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know in a stock so a business that I&#39;m going to get like a 20 30% return and I and I have a possibility of there&#39;s something out there lurking that I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t I&#39;m not interested in like I have to get paid double triple quadruple Plus for me to take any risk with capital and then I have to know my downside is totally protected so solvency risk comes first then cash flow then Revenue then understanding the cyclicality then understanding the management then understanding the the durable Mo the durability of the moat uh so for me to do all that work I got to get paid baby and and it&#39;s got to be a double triple so for these type of things it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not interesting to me but thank you for sending in a great question uh J JM Smith take a look at ew yeah we keep looking at ew every week um ew is fine uh but again show me how the cash flow is going to recover because it&#39;s absolutely collapsed so this probably will recover I I just uh it&#39;s worth doing work on for sure it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an okay call it&#39;s an okay call but you got to do your work and really understand how durable are their products I I I think it&#39;s a pretty solid compounder over time but for me it&#39;s it&#39;s a not I don&#39;t have any urgency to do a lot of work on this one I&#39;ll just leave it at that but it&#39;s interesting so I think your framework is good uh you just need to get some confidence in how they&#39;re going to turn around the free cash flow story and if you can get it towards that inflection you know you might have a over 3 to 5 years on this but more likely 50 to 75% which doesn&#39;t really pass my IR hurdle um Dan Abasi thanks for sharing your knowledge could you take a look at wns Holdings okay so this thing is haved what do they do cash flow has been flat for five years stock price is basically trading where it was five years ago no shocker gross margins let&#39;s take a look here first off what do they do voice analytical business transformation Services worldwide package good such as customer service analytics Human Resources outsourc I they do like 80 different things I can&#39;t even understand this so if you can actually figure out what the hell they do and how they&#39;re going to get this thing to uh re accelerate growth then I&#39;m interested just on the basis of what I&#39;m seeing uh it&#39;s not motivating me to do any further work on it to be honest with you so um it does look like a good trade but uh I&#39;m not that interested thank uh reload the page let me just see here balance sheet get this a little smaller okay that didn&#39;t help okay let&#39;s see here 240 liabilities 102 that&#39;s fine income statement income is growing what&#39;s happening [Music] to share count see share counts okay let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening in the margins it&#39;s holding up I do a little more work uh I would say that you have to understand why is it down and what is the plan and to get cash flow growing again make cash flow great again they&#39;ve not been doing that so what&#39;s the plan that&#39;s the name of the game Oleg Shak shakarov thoughts on Nike we&#39;ve covered this every week it&#39;s fine we like VF better be for the same reason because it&#39;s not an easy double uh like many of the other things that were in uh you&#39;ll just get a decent trade for a lot of risk R uh don&#39;t don&#39;t understand why you pick CCI over AMT because again Miriam I&#39;m not in things for 30 40% returns I&#39;m in things for double minimum and you&#39;re not going to get that from the quote highest quality business that&#39;s already fully priced uh when the we&#39;re looking for leverage without taking leverage so that when we when when the sector when everything turns we get the most bang for our buck and we get Asm not an incremental return to something that&#39;s fully valued because everyone already knows it&#39;s the best business in the group you know Advanced Auto Parts is the shittiest Auto retailer we know that we&#39;re not blind but it&#39;s the only one that the last four times it had 630 million doll of operating income it traded between $180 and $220 uh um and that&#39;s Management&#39;s Target New Management Catalyst Target uh for 2027 and the stock $45 so um that&#39;s that okay uh Mr Hayes I know main focus is China for emerging markets but what are your thoughts outlook on Mexico uh not for me I mean maybe I&#39;d buy Walmart Mexico or something I haven&#39;t even looked at it but no too much turbulence Trump is going to be like bashing them every day for paying for the wall taking the wall down I I have no idea but it&#39;s not going to be fun for Mexico but I do think Mexico&#39;s demographics business everything is great um I just don&#39;t really want to invest there Griffin Brown I just graduated as a public investor as a private investor you know would I want to set up a factory there yeah but I&#39;m not a private investor it&#39;s not what I do uh I just graduate college I this is like a five-page question uh how do you feel about Nike the same way I feel every week it&#39;s good not great it&#39;s going to work but not as much as some of our others uh thank you for the question Griffin Brown uh okay so thank you for that Griffin good stuff all right\n\nhat were in uh you&#39;ll just get a decent trade for a lot of risk R uh don&#39;t don&#39;t understand why you pick CCI over AMT because again Miriam I&#39;m not in things for 30 40% returns I&#39;m in things for double minimum and you&#39;re not going to get

Daniel Borman uh Daniel we cover TLT and bonds for like an hour every single week for the last three months so go back to that look at the commitment to Trader stuff we talk about look at the cycle stuff that we talk about look at the positioning stuff that we talk about uh and you will realize why we have that view also in terms of Baba what do you think of JD uh I like Baba I like Baba better than JD because Baba has the number one AI business if you want to own a piece of every single AI startup in China you want to own Alibaba if you want to benefit from AI apps and computer demand going exponential you want the number one cloud provider Baba if you want to benefit on a recovery of a middle class you bet on Baba uh Tollgate for all consumption you bet on Baba JD you only get one of those so uh if I have if I&#39;m a poker player which I am you want outs and um with Baba you get the most outs if one thing doesn&#39;t work as well there&#39;s like huge opportunities International is growing at 30 plus% it&#39;s priced it like it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t even exist so uh that&#39;s why I don&#39;t want JD or if I had to pick one or the other I mean you could buy Bas you could buy JD also it&#39;s probably fine but um Dak Brown notice you don&#39;t have any ads on your podcast because that&#39;s not what I do um all right Lucas Treno been listening a year and love what you do found three stocks all right Lucas I yeah there&#39;s no question there thanks Molly mcneel are there any places okay got that Jimmy Jones could you look at s swbi again Smith and Wesson I mean the best I gota be honest with you if you look at history the best time to buy these these gun companies is when a Democrat gets elected because everyone fears that their guns are going to get taken away if you look at the Obama Administration the thing went up 20x or whatever it was less than 20x it was like whatever 15x uh then under Biden again 10x so I you know no one&#39;s worried that Trump&#39;s going to take away their guns so they&#39;re not rushing to the stores negative free cash they&#39;re probably going to recover they haven&#39;t recovered yet uh I&#39;m still not interested Jimmy but it could work as a trade saber Corp oh yeah this is the software I had some guys pitch me on the private version of this and they spent an hour on the phone telling me why SA was going bankrupt or going out of business I I kind of liked it when they were pitching me on investing in their private deal uh does look like they&#39;re recovering but you know this is a lowquality business and if 10% of what they said is true um I don&#39;t really I&#39;m not that interested but I but they did get me interested more in investing in saber than they did in investing in their thing so uh they do I think they do like software for airline stuff let me just see yeah for the travel industry uh let&#39;s just take a look and see if anything&#39;s changed yeah I mean this is just this is digging into trash bin let me let me just double check here financials yeah looks like their revenues are recovering a little bit with the industry free cash flows probably going to turn positive see what their balance sheet looks like good amount of cash and oh $5 billion of debt that&#39;s not ideal and then uh see what they&#39;ve done yeah they&#39;ve they&#39;ve just diluted the hell out of their shareholders I I don&#39;t like these type of people I mean anyone that destroys their shareholders like that I&#39;m not interested in um okay new CEO but that&#39;s April of 2023 margins seem to be improving lot of Insider buying all right maybe maybe I mean I like your thinking for me I don&#39;t need to I like to sleep well at night that&#39;s not one that&#39;s not a way to do it uh got that sh thoughts on Petra Bross we&#39;ve covered this a million times not for me 21% dividend all you need is that socialist to wake up and cut the dividend I mean no way um Jason Zen Sebastian p uh National Retail properties n that&#39;s not for me and no there are not other reats I really want to look at other than crown castle right now I it&#39;s probably okay but it&#39;s pulled back like two cents so now you&#39;re excited with the 10% pullback it&#39;s there&#39;s no asymmetry there I&#39;m not interested I don&#39;t buy things for dividends um craft hind I think it&#39;s okay I think a bunch of these like Pepsi and uh Hershey and they&#39;re going to do probably a bit better this year I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer of Pepsi but yeah these things haven&#39;t come in enough so um that one&#39;s probably okay I took a brief look at it this week again uh what are your thoughts about macroeconomic challenges in Brazil also Latin America as a whole I&#39;m not ready to do anything in either of those markets the a imetry is better in China because the worst case is already in in China whereas those places it could get worse before it gets better but I think all Emerging Markets are going to work I just don&#39;t have any pound the table companies that are priced with the asymmetry I need to take the risk of $1 uh and get many dollars back and I&#39;m just not finding them to the level of comfort that I want there are beat up things I could buy but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have comfort you know it&#39;s taking country risk geopolitical risk company risk all of that stuff so you have to buy the highest quality and I&#39;m not finding the highest quality at levels that I want them so for now it&#39;s a pass but I&#39;m finding it all day long uh with Alibaba so that&#39;s where it is for today we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nthoughts on Petra Bross we&#39;ve

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI think that uh actually magnificent 7 will do do okay but probably not as well as last year you know last year you had much higher earnings growth this year that uh earnings growth is going to decelerate for the Magnificent 7 from 33% down to 21% and you&#39;re paying 33 times uh 33 times earnings so I think the theme for 2025 could be the last shall be first and you could start to look at some sectors that really underperformed in 2024 before we get to those Kenny you weigh in do you see mag 7 as maybe not the biggest performer for 2025 I I I agree with Tom I think they&#39;re gonna I think they&#39;re still going to perform well I don&#39;t think you&#39;re going to see a repeat of what happened in 2024 but I think there&#39;s another group within Tech that&#39;s really starting to raise its head and that&#39;s the quantum Computing side there&#39;s been a lot of talk about over the last couple of weeks a lot of very interesting names they&#39;re having really really interesting action uh some of these stocks really being gobbled up because of what Quantum means for the future of AI and how it&#39;s going to continue to change kind of that landscape so while I agree with Tom that I don&#39;t think the mag 7&#39;s going to continue to have the great great year I&#39;m certainly not a seller of the mag s at all yeah that makes sense Thomas so talk to me what you mean the last shall be first explain well if you look at two sectors that dramatically underperformed healthc care and materials were both only up low single digits in 2024 but if you look forward to 2025 they have among the highest expected earnings growth Healthcare is going to grow earnings 20.4% uh percent materials is going to grow earnings 17.4% so we think there&#39;s a lot of opportunity there and we think it&#39;s consistent with value could start to see a bid those unmagnify could could start to see a bid in 2025 it&#39;s the cheapest value has been relative to growth since 2000 and since 1980 which were two generational opportunities to buy value Kenny do you agree with that particularly when it comes to healthcare I I do because that to Tom&#39;s point that those two sectors were the underperformers now if they grow at the rate Tom says they&#39;re going to grow that is the expectation so if they grow at that rate certainly that they should be uh close to the outperformers of 2025 now that&#39;s still up in the air right we have to see if they&#39;re going to if how this how earnings is going to start and what the projections look like to verify or not those earnings growth rate but one way or the other you know to to Tom&#39;s point the last could be first you could see some of these sectors that were the underperforming really kind of take over and I&#39;m assuming in healthcare it&#39;s not just what Eli Lil noo noris giving me my glp1 right there&#39;s got to be a better name in healthcare yeah we like uh xbi which is a basket of biotech stocks the same thing happened in Trump 1.0 as soon as he got elected the the whole basket sold off in anticipation he was going to tear up the Affordable Care Act Right now it&#39;s down because of RFK Jr after the inauguration biotech rallied in 2017 over 75 % the next 12 months we think there&#39;s huge opportunity why deregulation FDA is going to approve more drugs FTC is going to approve more deals big farmer record cash on their balance sheets they need Innovation they&#39;re going to use that cash to buy biotech companies at record low valuation Kenny do you agree that the RFK fear within healthc care will be sort of resolved soon as perhaps they realize that he I don&#39;t know maybe is is it more bark than it is bite no no I I actually think I actually think that having RFK come on as the health Zar might actually be good we&#39;ll see a lot of things maybe uh uh remade right there are there are Cals in this country that aren&#39;t allowed in other countries because of what we put them in here in this country and he&#39;s trying to fight against that to actually make them healthier so I&#39;m all for it but yes I do think we saw like big names in healthcare Lily and all that kind of come off on that original uh RFK uh move but I think we&#39;re going to see a bounce back in some of the biggest uh uh Healthcare names all right well I love having you both great to have you Thomas here in studio and Kenny always fun to see you there uh down in Florida I suppose all right now just to recap Market&#39;s open and we&#39;re back then on Tuesday morning I had the privilege to join uh the great Stuart vanney and that&#39;s Lauren Simonetti absolutely incredible I want to thank Preston miselle and of course Christian dagger for booking me on the show uh absolutely great we had we got to talk about my favorite subject which is NVIDIA and Icarus came into the story for those of you who know a little bit of Greek mythology we&#39;ll talk about that but we also talked about price versus value so we&#39;re going to listen in here let&#39;s bring in Thomas Thomas Hayes um you&#39;re watching a market for us now are Jensen hang&#39;s comments going to push Nvidia to new highs I think so you&#39;re familiar with the story of Icarus the bad news is Jensen Wong is flying too close to the Sun the good news news is his wings are not melting yet and uh I think that the the company&#39;s at $3.7 trillion it wants to probably push to 4 trillion that would be 8% I think Beyond then like every semiconductor cycle right now he has no competition competition is coming and as far as training the robots and training the cars virtually what could go wrong right versus having to put the cars out on the roads you&#39;re putting it in a in a studio we&#39;ll see what happens but on balances is a positive thing for NVIDIA probably pushes a little bit higher from most of the people watching this program who have any investment in the stock market have some money in the Magnificent 7even big tech stocks in a nutshell give us your forecast for the Magnificent s in 2025 okay but not quite as good as 2024 why because earnings growth is decelerating they had 33% earnings growth last year they&#39;re going to have 21% earnings growth this year and the multiple has not yet rated downward you compare that to the broadening of the rally small caps are accelerating earnings growth from 8% to 21% but you only pay 15 16 times for that earnings growth versus the mag 7 you&#39;re still paying 33 times same growth half the multiple where are you putting your money to small caps look better yeah I&#39;ll see about that Tom Hayes great stuff thanks for joining us the international long shoreman&#39;s and we&#39;re back then I had the privilege to join Kristen Scher down at the New York Stock Exchange this was a comprehensive 2020 five Outlook and two picks that we don&#39;t get a lot of opportunity to talk about uh so you&#39;re really going to enjoy this one uh and here we go as we dive into the markets now just one full week into January I do want to bring in Thomas Hayes is a chair and managing member at Grey Hill Capital Thomas great to have you on the show great to be here Kristen and as we start this New Year so much Focus as to what is in store for stocks we&#39;ve seen some choppiness the S&amp;P just about 3% though from its record high what are you watching yeah I think this year is going to be a year of slightly more subdued returns and a rotation so it&#39;s not going to be as easy as parking the money in the indices and watching the mag 7 take you to the promised land I think what you&#39;re seeing is uh the deceleration in the earnings growth of the mag magnificent 7 so they had 33% earnings growth in 2024 that&#39;s going to decelerate down to 21% in 2025 however you&#39;re paying 33 times earning for it so you haven&#39;t seen any D- rating in the mag 7 and if you contrast that to Small caps their earnings growth is going from 8% in 2024 to 21% in 2025 and you only pay 16 times so half the multiple for the same earnings growth I think we&#39;re going to see a lot of fits and starts as the market starts to recognize where the value is uhhuh what does that mean for the rest of the market knowing that the mag 7 is expensive yeah I think you&#39;re going to see huge opportunities under the surface in the unmagnify uh some of the areas that got hit exceptionally hard in December you know we we did see the broadening start in Earnest in July of last year and it really hummed along until November and then there was this abrupt Interruption as yields blew out as uh fears around the FED in December uh we saw the exact same thing in Trump 1.0 right after he got elected the dollar rallied yields rallied between the election and the inaug after the inauguration all of that cooled down MH because we&#39;re talking about yields and the economy I do want to get your take Thomas on the ad print that we saw today because yields have been such a topic of conversation in terms of the direction of this Market 122,000 a little bit less than was what was actually expected by economists what might this mean for that non-farm payrolls report on Friday yeah we keep toggling between bad news is good news good news is good news I think this is a situation given what yields have done we do want to see a little bit cooler labor market to keep the FED possibly in the game number one and to put a cap on yields yields have really blown out a little bit since the election just like we saw in 2016 I think a cooler report if the ADP is any indicator of the non-farm payrolls report on Friday that&#39;s going to be a very good thing for the market yields will start to calm down and compress uh and uh the FED stays in the game and equities will like that International has been out of favor for a long time does 2025 change that I think it&#39;s in line with the theme of what I&#39;m talking about price is what you pay value is what you get you&#39;re going to have over 133% earnings growth in international it&#39;s trading at 15.5 times earnings in the US you&#39;re going to get 14% earnings growth and it&#39;s trading at 22 23 times so the thing that people forget because we we&#39;re all creatures of habit recency bias right since 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4.4% per year okay only in the zero interest rate environment since 2010 have you seen growth dramatically outperform value so unless you believe we&#39;re going back to zero interest rates you want to have some lower price value in your portfolio you don&#39;t have to ship the boat all the way right away but start to ease into to where where there&#39;s value and opportunity and still growth in earnings power particular stocks then Thomas that are on your radar yeah well I&#39;m known around these parts as turnaround Tom CU I like buying stocks that are down a lot but have an opportunity to turn around one is Advanced Auto Parts they&#39;re an auto retailer they got absolutely decimated they overexpanded they brought in a new CEO Shane o Kelly he came from HD Supply was a $7 billion business so what has he done he&#39;s taken solvency risk off the table he sold the westpack Canada business 1.5 billion paid down debt he&#39;s closing all the non-performing stores in the West Coast that are very spread out so they weren&#39;t getting economies scale 10% of the stores he&#39;s expanding in those regions where they&#39;re number one or number two consolidating the distribution centers they are targeting $630 million of operating income by 2027 the last two times they they traded at that level of operating income it was $180 to $220 stock it&#39;s trading at $45 today so this thing can really grow over the next couple years under the right leadership I want to talk about small caps as well we&#39;ve seen optimism return certainly with c following the election small caps have lagged behind those Magnificent Seven stocks as well we talk about growth we talk about value how does small caps fit in well I think small caps is where you&#39;re seeing the most value one of the names that we love is a company called Cooper standard again two Auto turnarounds for you you know people are are sleeping they listening to this but this is where the opportunity is going to be in 2025 2026 uh this company&#39;s down 90% it had a refinancing risk they got it refinanced in 2022 they do the ceiling systems around the doors boring stuff fluid transfer systems the operating leverage in this business is huge uh all this is is a is a play on volumes increasing we did 16.8 million annualized SAR in December if you remember those Auto numbers surprised everyone the volumes are coming back up the last time they did1 17 million the business earned $7 of $140 stock Stock&#39;s trading at $14 uh they&#39;ve taken $400 million of of uh uh cost out of the business so this thing we leave over the next two years could earn $7 to $10 a share which means you know you apply 10 times multiple it&#39;s it&#39;s really going to move all right Thomas Hayes in from the West Coast Thomas always a pleasure he&#39;s a chair and managing member at Great Hill capital thank you thanks for having me and we&#39;re back and from the NYSC obviously want to thank Kristen Scher want to thank Melissa Montanez and Jeff Cohen for having me on uh there and then\n\nconsolidating the distribution centers they are targeting $630 million of operating income by 2027 the last two times they they traded at that level of operating income it was $180 to $220 stock it's trading at $45 today so this thing can really grow over the next couple years under the right leadership I want to talk about small caps as well we've seen optimism return certainly with c following the election small caps have lagged behind those Magnificent Seven stocks as well we talk about growth we talk about value how does small caps fit in well I think small caps is where you're seeing the most value one of the names that we love is a company called Cooper standard again two Auto turnarounds for you you know people are are sleeping they listening to this but this is where the opportunity is going to be in 2025 2026 uh this company's down 90% it had a refinancing risk they got it refinanced in 2022 they do the ceiling systems around the doors boring stuff fluid transfer systems the operating leverage in this business is huge uh all this is is a is a play on volumes increasing we did 16.8 million annualized SAR in December if you remember those Auto numbers surprised everyone the volumes are coming back up the last time they did1 17 million the business earned $7 of $140 stock Stock's trading at $14 uh they've taken $400 million of of uh uh cost out of the business so this thing we leave over the next two years could earn $7 to $10 a share which means you know you apply 10 times multiple it's it's really going to move all right\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nwhat we are seeing is a deceleration in earnings growth for the Magnificent 7 which kind of has driven the bus looking backwards uh earnings growth dropping from 33% last year to 21% this year however the multiple on the magnif Magnificent 7 has not yet derated uh in accordance with the earnings growth deceleration so I think they&#39;re going to perform less well they&#39;ll do okay this year but if you contrast that to kind of the broadening theme and take a look at the other end of the spectrum going from large cap growth to maybe small cap value uh you look at earnings growth acceleration uh in the small cap 600 earnings growth is growing from 8% last year to 21% this year the difference is for that same 21% earnings growth whether you talk about mag 7 or you talk about small caps uh is the price you pay and on mag 7 you&#39;re still paying 33 times earnings for 21% earnings growth on small cap you&#39;re paying 15 or 16 times earnings for the same 21% earnings growth so I think that this is in fact going to be the year of the stock picker you can look under the surface the idea of setting on autopilot and letting the IND indices take you to Paradise uh is probably going to be a little less well founded in 2025 than it was in 2024 Tom I know from previous conversations you kind of had that that nickname turnaround Tom so I know that value is where you like to be looking talk about your methodology I mean how do you separate a value opportunity from a value trap yeah I think that&#39;s that&#39;s a great thing to to point out and I agree with some of what Chris said we do like to see growth but but price is what you pay value is what you get so we do look for stocks that are down a lot in terms of price and then we try to distinguish whether value has been uh destructed on an equivalent basis and what we find across most of the durable businesses that we get involved in number one they&#39;ve been around for many many years they&#39;ve operated through many cycles they&#39;re going through a temporary impairment like they have through uh different Cycles whether they&#39;re cyclical business or they&#39;ve had different other headwinds in the past uh and the first thing that we do is we look for solvency risk so uh you know if the stock&#39;s down 50 or 60 or 70 or 80% uh the market is saying that there might be an existential crisis so the first thing that we say is are they going to make it through this cycle are they going to live another day so that comes down to balance sheet analysis looking at the debt looking at when the maturities come due and if I can get comfortable with then then the key is going to be leadership do they have a new jockey that has a track record of success that&#39;s a key factor and then",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\nis free cash flow do they have enough Runway to execute on the turnaround plan because obviously it's been mismanaged to some degree or the stock wouldn't be down 80% you know you but but these are durable businesses whether we're talking about you know Disney that was at one point down 60% Disney's not going anywhere Boeing 70% uh these are high quality durable businesses that fall fell on rough times but they're not going anywhere anytime soon so um uh now to distinguish between a value trap I think people get caught in that just because the price is down means it's cheap and that's not always necessarily the case often times a a stock that's down a lot deserves to be down a lot and may uh face an ex existential crisis so that's something that you need to be able to discern from experience and doing proper analysis and not just looking at price and two is uh doing Lazy asset analysis where you say well the the breakup Parts uh alone is worth more than the price that it's trading at but there's no Catalyst for a recovery of growth there's no turnaround story there's no new leadership and I think that's where people get stuck in quote unquote value traps and and by the way many of the greatest value traps are broken growth stocks okay that never ever recover people forget that as it relates to Value generally um what what I see in the market right now is people uh blinded by recency bias in that because since 2010 growth has outperform value therefore it's always going to P persist meaning what's happened in the recent past is going to persist and um if you look back to 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4 and a half % per year per year including this aberrational uh zero interest rate policy environment and my my kind of view there is uh value and growth are tied at the HIP number one so it's it's not either or I don't buy something because it's a value stock or because it's a growth stock I buy because I'm getting a lot of value for uh Less Price than than the Alternatives highest and best use of the capital uh and I think that unless you believe that we're going back to zero interest rate policy or close to it uh not having some element of value and or International which is also trading at low multiples uh and small caps Etc is is um maybe a little risky at the moment if you got all your eggs in one basket because I think we are in a period of regime change and and that's going to create a lot of opportunities a lot more opportunity in 493 stock then in seven got it Tom I gotta ask you about your first pick I mean it's one of those names that just can't stay out of the news and not in a good way so uh sell me on Boeing here yeah well Boeing is uh is what we call a legal duopoly uh between Airbus and Boeing they deliver 99% of the commercial aircraft uh as far as the recent crashes which have been terrible they're predominantly concentrated to the older planes you know the risk the fear was that it was run the 737 Max which has had a ton of problems but they got rid of the old CEO fortunately we've got Kelly ortberg in who has an engineering background versus a sales background or financial engineering background and that's a good thing he's on the floor in Seattle he's fixing all of the problems he solved the uh the labor union strike and when he was at Rockwell Collins before he came here he created a lot of value for shareholders uh Rockwell Collins quadrupled in value for shareholders before it was sold in a period of six years he's a turnaround specialist uh they have a half a trillion doll backlog I mean imagine buying a business that had 10 years of demand that they couldn't possibly fulfill uh that they didn't have the capacity to fulfill all at once it's it's a great problem you got Airlines waiting and sure they can get angry and say you know the landing gear didn't come down right or the door had a problem Etc and they're working on fixing all of that but at the end of the day they can say fine I'm taking all my business to Airbus and rather than wait 10 years they're going to wait 20 years for their planes so that's not an option what they have to do is work with Boeing and that's what you've seen whether it's Southwest whether it's everything else and and the commonality across all the carriers is they have utmost confidence in Kelly ortberg's engineering PR safety uh excellence and turning the company around so with a stock down that's uh down that materially some you know 70 something percent it fell maybe Peak to trough uh and uh you have a business that's going to get back to free cash flow positive they raised uh $20 billion of cash to take solvency risk off the table all the components that I look for turnaround Tom looks for in a turnaround situation are perfectly in place pricing power uh durable sustainable moat performs through Cycles uh pricing power uh it's all there you just have to be patient now you play the time Arbitrage game and most people can't wait two to three years for a double uh but we're patient we like to do that rinse repeat over and over and we think Boeing is going to be one of our next ones uh Tom I I want to get back to your last pick um you know my household may or may not have spent some time on the website this holiday season uh it's Etsy obviously a lot of people know what the company does what's your case there yeah this is another one of my favorites down 80% uh we like to buy things down quite a bit but what's very interesting is the price is down 80 80% but like I say price is what you pay value is what you get uh they certainly their growth rate decelerated postco they had a huge surge in covid uh they are the fourth most trafficked e-commerce site in the US behind uh obviously Amazon Walmart and eBay 92 million users but what's beautiful about their business is it's a niche product handmade customized named uh products so it's not a race to the bottom in me too products where you're just competing on price which they couldn't compete against Amazon and Amazon had tried to compete with them years ago and realized they couldn't and got out of the business so uh and then you got a winner like Josh Silverman who was successful at eBay with shopping.com uh founded Evite sold that to Barry Diller over at IAC interactive and then when he was at Skype he grew 300 million users so um you know you have a situation where they made a couple they had the huge growth they've been able to keep that level of free cash flow keep the level of peak level of covid revenues and it's now trading at about a nine times free cash flow so they got so much cash gushing in healthy balance sheet a turnaround in plan they've got this gift mode they've better curated the website they're growing internationally they're focused on men they've got all these initiatives in place that are getting traction but at the same time they're buying in all the float so uh they just announced a b doll buyback they bought in about 9% of the shares in 2024 so effectively just from the free cash flow they could buy in the whole entire company in about you know nine nine years and uh and that alone if they didn't grow but it does look like growth is re accelerating and this is the perfect uh combination of characteristics that we look for in turnaround situations so we think this is going to be a great one over the next couple of years perfect and we're back so there 's not a whole lot more I need to say about the markets and by the way two of our picks were in here a shout out to Jeff Adams who wrote up our uh Boeing and Etsy uh from our from our previous podcast and articles was able to consolidate that you can download the whole report there are something like 78 picks from 44 different writers in that money show for 20125 think you'll find that valuable at hedge fund tips.com while you're there click on terms this is all opinion not advice talk to your financial adviser before you do anything we deal exclusively with accredited investors qualified institutions and the like uh want to thank Johan cherion sucti Gupta and karolina Mandel for including me in their article on Reuters this week and on to our\n\nI can't wait for Baba I just want to see all these people chase up at 200 and um and that's the story but corporate net interest payments near record lows so that is not what you see at recession time uh January is historically a strong month for the market so we'll see if we get some follow through here S&P annual performance 1953 to 2024 so you can see uh it wouldn't be abnormal to get a bunch of good sticks together like you got in the late '90s but we should be open-minded for more subdued returns this year uh on the indices I think on you know there was so much money made in 2000 in 2001 and 2002 when when uh when people were losing 90% of their money in amazon.com by the way it's not because Amazon was a bad business the fundamentals were still improving it's just they paid too much money for what would ultimately take place 10 years down the road um you know people think that if you're cautious on a stock you're you're negative on the narrative and that has nothing to do with it it's price is what you pay value is what you get and um I think all of these things that are you know happening now with AI and Robotics and automated driving are going to change the world they're just not going to do it tomorrow and uh and these things are pricing like they've been doing it already for 10 years uh and that's why you get the first wash out of a cycle and uh and then you buy it we'll be buying it when they're quote unquote value stocks when what they're promising now actually starts to happen the stocks will be down when it's actually happening in reality those stocks will be down 80% we'll be buying them hand over fist and that's where you get the real run like you got in Amazon in the you know post great financial crisis took a long time for that stock to recover uh ex growth is leading value by nine percentage points so what you can see here is  that what I talked about with Kristen and others is that this is an aberration right here this outperformance and growth versus value this happened in the Zer zero interest rate policy environment uh if you believe rates are going back to zero then fine you should bet on this H persisting but data going back to 1927 value outperforms growth by 45% per year that's where fortunes are made and by the way going back to 2021 remember when you had the concentration of all that Tech well for the next seven years value outperformed growth by about 100% if you add up all these numbers so um take the other side I mean maybe it takes five more years for that flip to happen that's that's certainly possible but not probable based on uh how far the rubber band is stretched four-year presidential election cycle weekly sweet spot so you have post elction here a little bumpiness the first half and then it drives higher uh interestingly here so you can see the different indices and so on four-year presidential cycle midterm year week and sweet spot so post election little weakness q1 strong Q2 uh and so on and so forth and then um the midterm next year should be a lot more challenging uh and I I would almost think yeah we'll we'll take it as it comes but uh I'm I'm way more C cautious about next year but wouldn't surprise me if we extend because this bull market is so young um and we had the recession in 2020 and 2022 already that we get some push forward because you usually get one every 4.1 years so we got two in two years which gives us like six years of run way um and we're two years in so I I would you know let's let's see how things play out there are a lot of variables here I mean if we if we if we if we ship tanks into Greenland we might have to re-evaluate Chinese assets aren't off to a good start what that says about economic stimul oh this why did I post this because our friend is back she must have been on vacation uh in India or something because she's back to bash China and uh uh without fail here she goes uh us private construction spending starting to turn up uh percentage of S&P 500 members above their 200 day moving averages so this is where you want to be buyers not sellers uh just looking at the odds above the 20-day moving average again the nysse stocks above the 20-day moving average so this is you know this is where you see saw the October 2000 lows the fall 2022 lows where we were pounding the hell and then March 2020 3 and by the way we picked up a ton of smart people back then both in October 2022 and in March of 2023 sending in money when the market was in turmoil because they were listeners to the podcast I said now now now just like I'm saying now now now before the before the inauguration let's go let's go these things are priced for death this is this 100-year window is closing and it's closing fast uh and there will always be opportunities but you're only going to have a once in a 100 Year event every hundred years and we are getting the re we are getting the residual benefits of how things positioned responding to that and recovering from that that now it's into money-making mode Roaring 20s of the recovery of all these things that got smattered dstock to restock cycle Etc uh active managers selling in the selling down of course as they always do here's earnings estimates solid returns are normal after a 20% gain this is from Ryan Dietrich at Carson average uh after 20 20% gain the average return is 10.6% that is going back to 1950 so I would I think that's a reasonable expectation I've been saying 8 to 12 I like that 10.6 makes a whole lot of sense I mean Automotive Sales thanks my buddy Allen this this is uh um 16.8% annual 16.8 million annualized S I mean obviously you had some pull forward with the Florida and the EV tax credits fear wind down but at the end if we got anything close to 68 I mean it would just be un the thing would at 168 if you got not an annualized but an annual 16.8 which I think we're going to get in the next couple of years uh Cooper earns over 10 bucks a share because of the $400 $500 million of cost they pulled out of it they earn when they were earning seven bucks at the last cycle Peak when we were doing 17.1 million SAR $146 stock 13 or $14 stock now uh as we're ramping up cash flow positive so why are they just what's the overhang the overhang is twofold rates are spiking up after the election which they did in 2016 to 2017 after the inauguration rates will go back down that will alleviate fears about uh refinancing although they don't have any maturities coming due imminently but we want to get them refinanced anyway that'll save additional interest costs which I think they'll be able to do in the first or second quarter while credit spread spreads are at record lows um and then it also helps financing on the cars particularly short rates which is which is also a positive things which helps volumes doesn't help margins for the oems but helps volumes which is all we care about because we make uh the certain amount per car and we make more on hybrids and EES than we do on IC so is that Trend hybrids are crushing it we love it that's more margin than we have in our models so we're excited ISM Manufacturing PMI turning up uh new orders turning up that's good uh and then here we go cyclicals over defensives ISM Manufacturing Pi this is going to be a catch-up play this is going to help Industrials and everything else\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nI love this it's just like all the great things we own through Alibaba without actually having to own it uh directly uh on a standalone basis so this is a home run uh and that's that so Bob Iger strikes again good job there Disney stock gets an upgrade amid content Renaissance and streaming profit growth remember when we got involved 70s 8s you couldn't give it away uh people said the streaming is losing money it's never going to turn well they did it they turned profitable they're huge they I mean same story over and over we had to go through the whole bass family to convince you and this and that this happens every Cycles but that's what Buffett's talking about of being able to estimate the turnarounds and the cyclical because you see these things happen over and over again they just found a new way to sell the content their amazing Content Library in 1984 when the bass family took a huge position in it they went from uh you know movie theaters to VHS then they caught another run in the 90s with DVDs and now they're catching another run with with streaming but streaming is better than DVDs because it recurs every single month uh you weren't selling someone one new DVD every single month guaranteed uh which is just beautiful so\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nfed isn't certain where interest rates will head minutes show inflation and Trump are concerned so uh my guess is nowhere until probably June but let's see how it goes China ramps up you unless the labor part if the labor market starts weakening a little bit they will be all over that and cutting again in March they seem a little bit more worried about the labor market than inflation China ramps up Yuan support with record Hong Kong bill issue so they're on it here we're ramping up just in time for people to be on the wrong side of the trade so\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nstock market and sentiment results uh we covered all the media wanted to do a gener update we haven&#39;t covered that a lot because we you know if you&#39;ve listened for a while you know we don&#39;t spend much time talking about our winners we we uh we&#39;ve been talking about uh generx well below $100 and then it shot up to 195 now it&#39;s at 160 look all you need to know here um we can go through every word of the transcript which we did but uh we don&#39;t have time for that um is free cash flows accelerating and free cash flows now at the levels you saw when it was a $524 stock it&#39;s at $158 so you know getting back to 200 and Beyond is easy peasy and then the question is where does the growth stall out on the next cycle is it is the stock 250 is it 300 does it get back to New all-time highs that&#39;s going to take a while I think new all-time Highs but uh this is the same story story uh over and over and uh they continue to bring the share count down earnings are recovering after a trough in 2023 they work through the dstock cycle now we&#39;re back into the restock cycle going to be at record earnings by 2026 2027 free cash flow per share is going through the roof sales per share have re accelerated to all-time highs because they brought in the share count and they&#39;re just dominating residential commercial and Industrial you see them every single way and they got their hands and the the whole Eco stuff that uh you know it&#39;s kind of a waste of time but they got to be there as just a blockout competition and this is the cycle of gener they have these huge growth runs uh like they did into 2021 they consolidate for a few years with a little bit of lower Revenue they recover after a couple down years and then back to the next growth cycle same thing rinse repeat and that&#39;s where we are right now just like Boeing no different uh us penetration rate is only 6.25% you can see some of their uh other states are at 21 to 25% like Michigan West Virginia Maine Louisiana where they have reg regular outages everyone has one every 1% additional penetration uh Look at California zero to 3% I mean you think California is going to sell a few generators in the next few months you you bet your bottom dollar when they&#39;re shutting power off in Los Angeles this a one every 1% is a $3.5 billion opportunity so um you know you get 14 more uh percent penetration or let&#39;s just say 10$ 35 billion opportunity I mean that&#39;s that&#39;s where fortunes are made ladies and gentlemen and uh you know the most important chart here which actually blew my mind uh well first one I love this one obviously Sal sales recovering margins recovering free cash flow just off the charts uh almost $500 million of free cash flow for 2020 before you can&#39;t give it away I love this well some people started bidding it it was a double and now it&#39;s come back a little bit so uh you can give it away people were were taking it at 194 uh but um anyway this is what&#39;s really cool because I&#39;m like how you know 6% penetration what what what happens this is the adoption curve of um central air conditioning it looks a lot like it you know in from 1945 to 1950 to 1960 the first 15 years of central air conditioning the penetration rate was only 6.25% uh which is basically 205 to 2024 of uh uh generators Home standby generators and then it just completely hockey sticked after 1965 and went straight from 10% generation uh penetration to 80 8% penetration I think with what you&#39;re seeing with the grids and the demand that AI is going to have on the grids and everything else and air conditioners and everything else the instability and the weather and all that stuff I don&#39;t know if we ever get to 88% but I I I would be surprised if we didn&#39;t get to 30 or 40% over the next 10 15 years you see the same adoption curve with Home Security Alarms we&#39;re basically at zero in 1980 within the first 20 years got up to 19% now at 29% portable generators up to uh went from 0 to 20% so and then home standby generators so I think more and more I think this is going to be a feature when people build new houses as well uh in a more meaningful way you see residential up 27% year on-year if you look at last 12 months up 10.4 net sales up 99.6% on the quarter gross profit up 9% net income up 88% free cash flow up 56.5 5% year onye uh uh and uh last 12 months free cash flow up 178% pretty exciting uh free cash flow last 12 months 584 so nine times I mean anyway so this is exciting here&#39;s the fear and greed Index this is not what you see at tops really could It Go lower before it goes higher yes um and then\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmargins recovering free cash flow just off the charts uh almost $500 million of free cash flow for

    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\nthey've been able to keep that level of free cash flow keep the level of peak level of covid revenues and it's now trading at about a nine times free cash flow so they got so much cash gushing in healthy balance sheet a turnaround in plan they've got this gift mode they've better curated the website they're growing internationally they're focused on men they've got all these initiatives in place that are getting traction but at the same time they're buying in all the float so uh they just announced a b doll buyback they bought in about 9% of the shares in 2024 so effectively just from the free cash flow they could buy in the whole entire company in about you know nine nine years and uh and and that alone if they didn't grow but it does look like growth is re accelerating and this is the perfect uh combination of characteristics that we look for in turnaround situations so we think this is going to be a great one over the next couple of years perfect and we're back so there 's not a whole lot more I need to say about the markets and by the way two of our picks were in here a shout out to Jeff Adams who wrote up our uh Boeing and Etsy uh from our from our previous podcast and articles was able to consolidate that you can download the whole report there are something like 78 picks from 44 different writers in that money show for 20125 think you'll find that valuable at hedge fund tips.com while you're there click on terms this is all opinion not advice talk to your financial adviser before you do anything we deal exclusively with accredited investors qualified institutions and the like uh want to thank Johan cherion sucti Gupta and karolina Mandel for including me in their article on Reuters this week and on to our\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\n\n### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nCharlie Munger quote our job is to find a few intelligent things to do not to keep up with every damn thing in the world no one could say it better than Charlie Munger I want to talk a little bit about earnings growth uh for 2025 this has been a theme you heard it in a couple of the interviews particularly I think with Taylor rigs how healthc care had uh the worst performance Healthcare materials had very low performance in 2024 we expected to have uh a great performance in 2025 and you can get a sense of why they had you know di Minimus performance is because they had di Minimus earnings growth so in 2024 Healthcare grew earnings 4.1% uh that was you know more than half less less than half of what the S&P grew 99.5% and then materials grew negative 99.5% so so it makes some sense even Industrials didn&#39;t grow that much uh it makes some sense that these were the laggards and what grew uh Tech certainly had um um big growth 177% we sold off our uh our um uh Google and Amazon that we bought in Fall of 2022 during the summer they didn&#39;t do a whole lot more after that by the way it was effectively dead money uh after that they they&#39;ve started to move up a little bit and com services so they had the best earnings growth and they had the best performance however if you look into 2025 two of the top four expected earnings growth are healthc Care at 20.5 and materials at 17.0 so that&#39;s where there&#39;s opportunities we uh Express the materials we talked about through albam Maro we express the healthc care through xbi biotech if you recall uh during Trump when he got elected uh biotech and Healthcare so off in those two months because he was going to rip up the Affordable Car Act they rallied bigly uh as he would say 75% for biotech in the next year after the inauguration so that&#39;s how we&#39;re expressing that we also have Baxter which we&#39;re excited about uh Tech is also going to grow the key is how much is already priced in which we talked about in some of the interviews so we&#39;re not going to repeat that so uh Industrials is going to grow 18.8% we got exposure to that through the Stanley Black and&amp; Deckers of the world through the anax through the um uh you know Cooper standard in in in a certain way uh Etc so so we&#39;ve got all that energy is going to grow a little bit but not much we&#39;re still looking for some opportunity there um consumer discretionary which we talked about months ago when no one wanted it they&#39;ve outperformed so lots priced in there but this is where you&#39;re going to find the uh the real opportunity and the ones that were left behind that are now going to have the earnings growth so these things are not Mysteries this is why they outperform and why we get positioned for them but just as a friendly Public Service Announcement which we&#39;ve been talking about for many podcasts now is not to get faked out right now because crazy town is happening uh Gulf of America we&#39;re GNA Co-op the Panama Canal uh Canada is going to be the 51st state and Wayne Gretzky is going to be the governor not a bad idea by the way uh and uh what else are we going to do Greenland so you know this is silly stuff on on a headline by headline basis some of its diversions there&#39;s a semblance of Truth to some of it that makes sense of course uh how much of it will get done remains to be seen but this is the same time a type of Crazy Town speculation that you saw after Trump got elected in Trump one uh that as tariff man Baba sold off from 107 down to 84 by the way it&#39;s kind of interesting that Baba has done effectively the exact same thing since he got elected uh down to the low 80s and then it uh uh over the next 12 months less than 12 months it went from 84 to 187 after the election so uh it doesn&#39;t have to repeat and this is uh certainly you know not it&#39;s just to tell you that during those weird periods of uncertainty same with kweb um same with uh same with a lot of these healthc care biotech sold off big right after he got elected rallied the next year uh and so on and so forth energy did poorly but uh I&#39;m keeping an open mind on energy if something really comes a fat pitch down the middle it&#39;s just there&#39;s not enough upside for me to take the risk right now relative to some of the other opportunities in the portfolio and that uh we were able to allocate to so um so this is this is just normal stuff Staples sold off a lot there you know I&#39;m seeing some Staples I&#39;ve got my eye on the Hershey&#39;s I&#39;ve got my eye on the cokes I&#39;ve got my eye on uh a lot of these companies that have sold off that may be opportunities after the you know getting positioned ahead of the election but we we&#39;ve got that exposure that will benefit from healthc care we was going to rip up the Affordable Care Act afterwards uh huge huge run over 50% the next 12 months uh and so on and so forth so everything they thought would do well did poorly like energy everything I thought would do poorly did well so keep an open mind for the next few weeks don&#39;t do anything stupid uh if you&#39;ve got cash to put to work now is the time if you&#39;re picking wisely uh the opportunity window that was created by a once in a 100 Year event the generational opportunity the window is closing now we are set for takeoff and uh many of you have strapped on board and by the way congratulations to everyone that came this week some some of you are already approved funded and we&#39;ve been able to deploy in the last couple of days so super excited for you super excited for all the clients that are with me positioned in the same way for a rocket ship I you know I think this is going to be the most exciting year uh not for indices but for what we do and we&#39;re going to see some charts and correlations that kind of bear that out so let&#39;s go to our some of our charts here uh this is from Chris verone R to be December to be lower 20% of the time but it&#39;s January that has the more important role in setting the market tone for the next 6 months uh when January is positive the average 6mon forward S&amp;P performance is 6.9% so that&#39;s kind of a big deal as far as when December is negative it has less of an impact uh moving forward so so we&#39;ll keep an eye on January",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\neverything they thought would do well did poorly like energy everything I thought would do poorly did well so keep an open mind for the next few weeks don&#39;t do anything stupid uh if you&#39;ve got cash to put to work now is the time if you&#39;re picking wisely uh the opportunity window that was created by a once in a 100 Year event the generational opportunity the window is closing now we are set for takeoff and uh many of you have strapped on board and by the way congratulations to everyone that came this week some some of you are already approved funded and we&#39;ve been able to deploy in the last couple of days so super excited for you super excited for all the clients that are with me positioned in the same way for a rocket ship I you know I think this is going to be the most exciting year uh not for indices but for what we do and we&#39;re going to see some charts and correlations that kind of bear that out so let&#39;s go to our some of our charts here uh this is from Chris verone R to be December to be lower 20% of the time but it&#39;s January that has the more important role in setting the market tone for the next 6 months uh when January is positive the average 6mon forward S&amp;P performance is 6.9% so that&#39;s kind of a big deal as far as when December is negative it has less of an impact uh moving forward

thought rates would stay much higher than they actually did you can see all these estimates and then what actually happened rates came down dramatically all these estimates that rates would be higher they stayed low higher low higher low Stay Stay higher low stay higher lower so uh you know we&#39;re kind of in the we&#39;re still in the camp that was a unconventional view last year that rates would probably they&#39;d probably stopped cutting around three and a half to 4% uh on the FED funds rate but now that&#39;s becoming more consensus so we&#39;ll see what happens but I think this was a really useful exercise that uh um don&#39;t be surprised if rates go lower than you think and bonds get bit higher and no one right now no one because you&#39;re getting the exact same fake out that we&#39;ve covered the last three weeks uh in the dollar rally and yields rallying after the Trump election like in 2016 and then after the inauguration what happened dollar rolled over weakened for the next year bonds got bid Yi compressed there are zero people talking like that right now everyone thinks it&#39;s the end of the world and I think what you&#39;re going to find is the opposite is true\n\nhere is Bank estimates of what rates would do uh nearly every single time uh uh cide was too pessimistic meaning they thought rates would stay much higher than they actually did you can see

2.6% decline was the worst end to a year since 1952 you know you had Industrials down 10% in December I mean you had this beautiful broadening from January from July through December uh then December you know after the election and with the FED stuff it just you know unraveled a acute Interruption it will resume it&#39;s just going to be after the after the inauguration and things settle down um yeah worst than to a year since 1952 that&#39;s pretty mindboggling another bullish sign in energy let&#39;s see small speculators are short natural gas for the first time since uh 2001 just as natural gas was breaking out this is super exciting ladies and Gentlemen We love comto some guy emailed me or dm&#39;d me on LinkedIn if you have an AMA question send it in at hedge fund tips.com please don&#39;t DM me unless you&#39;re a client you can call my cell phone if you&#39;re a client but um uh put it in on the uh on the website if uh if you want me to answer it but I&#39;m going to address it because he said you know is comto too late to get in you know we were pounding the table on Comstock at $78 $9 on this podcast now I think it got up to like19 or $20 and he says is it too late I think we&#39;re just getting started in in the cycle now uh you know it&#39;s up over 100% in a short period of time so but I think if you step back and we&#39;ve talked about proved and unproved reserves as it relates to that it&#39;s nowhere near its liquidation value you you saw what it did in 2000 same type of situation this thing can run for a long long time uh would I be a buyer at at you know $19 after it&#39;s rallied from 7 in like a few you know in a very short period of time since we&#39;ve been talking uh I&#39;d probably wait for a little bit of a pullback maybe back to 15 or 16 but you may never get it and uh you know I will start to evaluate where we are versus intrinsic value uh much higher than now but you know if I tell you to get in at $20 when I was telling you that you know about it at 789 and then it pulls back to 15 you know most people flip out because they don&#39;t know what they own um it doesn&#39;t really matter but if I was late to the party I&#39;d probably wait for a pullback and if it went to you know 50 60 70 without me I&#39;d be perfectly happy with that I could care less so there are plenty of opportunities so that&#39;s not the only one but it&#39;s interesting in terms of sentiment how people you know no one&#39;s interested at 789 except for the clients who give me money because they see the opportunities and they they&#39;re like let&#39;s go you know and uh you attract what you are bottom line if you&#39;re a winner you attract winners that&#39;s how it works and um and that&#39;s what I have with my clients they just unbelievable group of people that are just crushing it in the real world and um and and I&#39;m just uh honored to be a partner with them and uh and grow this over time so um so that&#39;s natural gas this is an amazing chart okay so this is all the idiots that are shorten the hole they&#39;re going to get their you know what&#39;s reamed uh and what what are we back to if those of you been with me for two months 2001 baby this is this is so many similarities it&#39;s so exciting because from 2001 to 2007 Emerging Markets China value outperform growth SM small outperform large you can&#39;t sell that narrative anywhere anytime any place and you won&#39;t be able to until 3 4 5 years from now after it&#39;s up triple and you get like the guy dming you after the thing&#39;s up over 100 150% is it too late um and then the beauty of those people is that it pulls back the minute they get in after 100% move it pulls back 25% the people that are in from you know 100% ago they don&#39;t care uh they just wait it out and then they get another double whereas the guy who got in late sells sells down 25% and misses it again then buys up again and the same thing&#39;s going to happen with Baba I I just I I almost can&#39;t wait for I I can&#39;t wait for Baba I I just want want to see all these people chase up at 200 and um and that&#39;s the story but corporate net interest payments near record lows so that is not what you see at recession time uh January is historically a strong month for the market so we&#39;ll see if we get some follow through here S&P annual performance 1953 to 2024 so you can see uh it wouldn&#39;t be abnormal to get a bunch of good sticks together like you got in the late &#39;90s but we should be open-minded for more subdued returns this year uh on the indices I think on you know there was so much money made in 2000 in 2001 and 2002 when when uh when people were losing 90% of their money in amazon.com by the way it&#39;s not because Amazon was a bad business the fundamentals were still improving it&#39;s just they paid too much money for what would ultimately take place 10 years down the road um you know people think that if you&#39;re cautious on a stock you&#39;re you&#39;re negative on the narrative and that has nothing to do with it it&#39;s price is what you pay value is what you get and um I think all of these things that are you know happening now with AI and Robotics and automated driving are going to change the world they&#39;re just not going to do it tomorrow and uh and these things are pricing like they&#39;ve been doing it already for 10 years uh and that&#39;s why you get the first wash out of a cycle and uh and then you buy it we&#39;ll be buying it when they&#39;re quote unquote value stocks when what they&#39;re promising now actually starts to happen the stocks will be down when it&#39;s actually happening in reality those stocks will be down 80% we&#39;ll be buying them hand over fist and that&#39;s where you get the real run like you got in Amazon in the you know post great financial crisis took a long time for that stock to recover uh ex growth is leading value by nine percentage points so what you can see\n\nI can't wait for Baba I just want to see all these people chase up at 200 and um and that's the story but corporate net interest payments near record lows so that is not what you see at recession time uh January is historically a strong month for the market so we'll see if we get some follow through here S&P annual performance 1953 to 2024 so you can see uh it wouldn't be abnormal to get a bunch of good sticks together like you got in the late '90s but we should be open-minded for more subdued returns this year uh on the indices I think on you know there was so much money made in 2000 in 2001 and 2002 when when uh when people were losing 90% of their money in amazon.com by the way it's not because Amazon was a bad business the fundamentals were still improving it's just they paid too much money for what would ultimately take place 10 years down the road um you know people think that if you're cautious on a stock you're you're negative on the narrative and that has nothing to do with it it's price is what you pay value is what you get and um I think all of these things that are you know happening now with AI and Robotics and automated driving are going to change the world they're just not going to do it tomorrow and uh and these things are pricing like they've been doing it already for 10 years uh and that's why you get the first wash out of a cycle and uh and then you buy it we'll be buying it when they're quote unquote value stocks when what they're promising now actually starts to happen the stocks will be down when it's actually happening in reality those stocks will be down 80% we'll be buying them hand over fist and that's where you get the real run like you got in Amazon in the you know post great financial crisis took a long time for that stock to recover uh ex growth is leading value by nine percentage points so what you can see here is  that what I talked about with Kristen and others is that this is an aberration right here this outperformance and growth versus value this happened in the Zer zero interest rate policy environment uh if you believe rates are going back to zero then fine you should bet on this H persisting but data going back to 1927 value outperforms growth by 45% per year that's where fortunes are made and by the way going back to 2021 remember when you had the concentration of all that Tech well for the next seven years value outperformed growth by about 100% if you add up all these numbers so um take the other side I mean maybe it takes five more years for that flip to happen that's that's certainly possible but not probable based on uh how far the rubber band is stretched four-year presidential election cycle weekly sweet spot so you have post elction here a little bumpiness the first half and then it drives higher uh interestingly here so you can see the different indices and so on four-year presidential cycle midterm year week and sweet spot so post election little weakness q1 strong Q2 uh and so on and so forth and then um the midterm next year should be a lot more challenging uh and I I would almost think yeah we'll we'll take it as it comes but uh I'm I'm way more C cautious about next year but wouldn't surprise me if we extend because this bull market is so young um and we had the recession in 2020 and 2022 already that we get some push forward because you usually get one every 4.1 years so we got two in two years which gives us like six years of run way um and we're two years in so I I would you know let's let's see how things play out there are a lot of variables here I mean if we if we if we if we ship tanks into Greenland we might have to re-evaluate Chinese assets aren't off to a good start what that says about economic stimul oh this why did I post this because our friend is back she must have been on vacation uh in India or something because she's back to bash China and uh uh without fail here she goes uh us private construction spending starting to turn up uh percentage of S&P 500 members above their 200 day moving averages so this is where you want to be buyers not sellers uh just looking at the odds above the 20-day moving average again the nysse stocks above the 20-day moving average so this is you know this is where you see saw the October 2000 lows the fall 2022 lows where we were pounding the hell and then March 2020 3 and by the way we picked up a ton of smart people back then both in October 2022 and in March of 2023 sending in money when the market was in turmoil because they were listeners to the podcast I said now now now just like I'm saying now now now before the before the inauguration let's go let's go these things are priced for death this is this 100-year window is closing and it's closing fast uh and there will always be opportunities but you're only going to have a once in a 100 Year event every hundred years and we are getting the re we are getting the residual benefits of how things positioned responding to that and recovering from that that now it's into money-making mode Roaring 20s of the recovery of all these things that got smattered dstock to restock cycle Etc uh active managers selling in the selling down of course as they always do here's earnings estimates solid returns are normal after a 20% gain this is from Ryan Dietrich at Carson average uh after 20 20% gain the average return is 10.6% that is going back to 1950 so I would I think that's a reasonable expectation I've been saying 8 to 12 I like that 10.6 makes a whole lot of sense I mean Automotive Sales thanks my buddy Allen this this is uh um 16.8% annual 16.8 million annualized S I mean obviously you had some pull forward with the Florida and the EV tax credits fear wind down but at the end if we got anything close to 68 I mean it would just be un the thing would at 168 if you got not an annualized but an annual 16.8 which I think we're going to get in the next couple of years uh Cooper earns over 10 bucks a share because of the $400 $500 million of cost they pulled out of it they earn when they were earning seven bucks at the last cycle Peak when we were doing 17.1 million SAR $146 stock 13 or $14 stock now uh as we're ramping up cash flow positive so why are they just what's the overhang the overhang is twofold rates are spiking up after the election which they did in 2016 to 2017 after the inauguration rates will go back down that will alleviate fears about uh refinancing although they don't have any maturities coming due imminently but we want to get them refinanced anyway that'll save additional interest costs which I think they'll be able to do in the first or second quarter while credit spread spreads are at record lows um and then it also helps financing on the cars particularly short rates which is which is also a positive things which helps volumes doesn't help margins for the oems but helps volumes which is all we care about because we make uh the certain amount per car and we make more on hybrids and EES than we do on IC so is that Trend hybrids are crushing it we love it that's more margin than we have in our models so we're excited ISM Manufacturing PMI turning up uh new orders turning up that's good uh and then here we go cyclicals over defensives ISM Manufacturing Pi this is going to be a catch-up play this is going to help Industrials and everything else\n\n so I would I think that's a reasonable expectation I've been saying 8 to 12 I like that 10.6 makes a whole lot of sense I mean Automotive Sales thanks my buddy Allen this this is uh um 16.8% annual 16.8 million annualized S I mean obviously you had some pull forward with the Florida and the EV tax credits fear wind down but at the end if we got anything close to 68 I mean it would just be un the thing would at 168 if you got not an annualized but an annual 16.8 which I think we're going to get in the next couple of years uh Cooper earns over 10 bucks a share because of the $400 $500 million of cost they pulled out of it they earn when they were earning seven bucks at the last cycle Peak when we were doing 17.1 million SAR $146 stock 13 or $14 stock now uh as we're ramping up cash flow positive so why are they just what's the overhang the overhang is twofold rates are spiking up after the election which they did in 2016 to 2017 after the inauguration rates will go back down that will alleviate fears about uh refinancing although they don't have any maturities coming due imminently but we want to get them refinanced anyway that'll save additional interest costs which I think they'll be able to do in the first or second quarter while credit spread spreads are at record lows um and then it also helps financing on the cars particularly short rates which is which is also a positive things which helps volumes doesn't help margins for the oems but helps volumes which is all we care about because we make uh the certain amount per car and we make more on hybrids and EES than we do on IC so is that Trend hybrids are crushing it we love it that's more margin than we have in our models so we're excited ISM Manufacturing PMI turning up uh new orders turning up that's good uh and then here we go cyclicals over defensives ISM Manufacturing Pi this is going to be a catch-up play this is going to help Industrials and everything else\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nhere is  the number they expected 16.5 annualized they got 168 this is just super exciting news super exciting news and super exciting news because I've been able to put a lot of new money into it in the 13 which I never thought I would ever be able to do with 16.8 annualized so I am super pumped uh and uh and super hopefully it's going to stay down until after the inauguration because people have these fake fears about tariffs they'll have some real tariffs but they they're always workarounds and things that can be done and passrs and everything else but um I pray that it stays down for another couple weeks so we can get everyone as much of this as humanly possible at a reasonable price uh hybrids time to shine so you can see here this just means more margin than expected so instead of earning $10 a share they could earn $12 per share potentially on 17 to 17.5 million which is the cycle Peak every cycle since 19 going 45 50 years back uh it troughs in the 15s it peaks in the 17s and uh the operating leverage of these businesses is unbelievable uh here are the winners by bran we could care less um Euro oh okay so all leverage funds are short the Euro that's going to absolutely rip higher um you're seeing you know Trudeau as as more and more well I don't even need to get into the reason why the Looney a good thing happened this week that's going to help the Looney uh hang in there for those of you who are Canadian uh Looney is going to have its day in the sun here just remember back to 20 one period Commodities you can't versus global equities can't give away same in 2020 when we were buying Exxon in the 30s when oil was trading negative so now it's the all borrows of the world it's other opportunities to play the Commodities trade uh Comstock of course and um and this is what helps the Emerging Markets countries and uh the Emerging Markets currencies when this inflects which it will which it shall which is also a function of Chinese stimulus and everything kicking in there which we're going to cover cta's exposure to oil shorten the whole I think oil's going up uh selling pressure in the energ sector there you go selling in the whole most crowded Longs index so look it's it's um it's in overshoot mode it can stay extended in overshoot but you don't have to play the pain of discipline or the pain of regret your choice uh this shows expensive relative to the last 10 years versus cheap relative what's cheap S&P 400 which is mid S&P 600 which is uh small uh and what's expensive growth and momentum so you can chase the shiny objects and be undisciplined and hope that there's another sucker that comes in behind you to lay it off to but uh chances are you'll be holding the bag that's that's what I have to say about that global valuations current and 25y year next 12 months price to earnings ratio uh so this just shows China is the cheapest relative to history and relative in absolute terms us is the most expensive keep that in mind when we covered the US versus International Cycles from Cali Cox over at rolz last week that was an awesome chart go back and review that uh if you want to think that us us is going to outperform Forever then you have a very myopic uh short-term view uh grounded in recency bias and that's where you get punished uh moving on corporate spreads this is where miracles happen uh refinancings happen interest expense for companies is at the lowest in years as we covered um and as a reminder for the shiny object crew southc stock bubble this is from December 7 1718 to December 1721 uh this was Isaac Newton not a dumb guy he uh got into South Seas stock bought a little bit he exited at a profit he bought a little bit at 200 exited at 400 his friends got rich at 600 he enters with all his money at 800 it goes to 950 and then he exits at 200 flat broke and this is this is exactly what you're going to see with um Baba you know is is basically what's what's going to happen but what what's more likely is that you know most people will enter here sell on these pullbacks then buy up again sell on the pullback then buy up again sell on the pullback then buy up again sell sell on the pullback at a loss and then start buying and and get smoked so um it's just it's not it's not about being smart or knowing better it's about observing history and learning you know you can learn from your own mistakes but it's a lot more costeffective to learn from watching other mistakes and there's so much written about mistakes throughout history if you'll take some time to educate yourself and experience and nothing beats experience but uh experience coupled with knowledge there's it's it's an unmatchable combination that can just set you up for a lifetime of happiness success and enjoyment let's just put it that way Trump AIDS ready Universal tariff plans with one key change this was uh put out then rebuked it's probably a lot of truth to it he said but only on certain sectors so it looks like the administration is walking back the blanket tariffs that had the whole Market worried Canadian dollar jumps on Trudeau and tariff reports uh so that was a spike up on the uh TR the Tariff announcements and the Trudeau resignation valuations get more lopsided more of that this is S&P equal versus the S&P 500 this is what they call technicians call a double bottom so you had that monster broadening from July through December then the abrupt Interruption uh and this will resume and\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\npremium everyone keeps talking about this like it&#39;s a bad thing next 12 months forward earning yield minus the 10-year treasury yield and what that implies so they&#39;re saying oh stocks are expensive bad timing to invest no the stocks that are driving the multiple I.E the earnings yield are too expensive and what happened during those periods is value small cap Emerging Markets International all the things that were cheap took up the reain and dramatically outperformed for the next seven years so this is bullish as hell if you know what to buy or you pay someone who knows what to buy uh a part of the profits to do it for you uh that&#39;s a home run so change in 10-year treasury year seasonality so you know there&#39;s a tendency in the postelection year to have some strength in the yields until uh early March so maybe it persist a little after the inauguration but I think we&#39;re we&#39;re pretty much there when when everyone&#39;s convinced we&#39;re going to 5% it means that the the move is probably done uh presidential cycle and returns year 1 average 6.6 uh median is 8.1% that&#39;s going back to 1928 this is Russell growth versus Russell 1000 value uh and you can see this you know this whole thing of the zero interest rate policy where growth outperformed is the aberration not the rule I can&#39;t reemphasize look at this from 20 2000 value outperform growth by 29% or all right let&#39;s put it the the way it&#39;s written growth underperformed value in 2000 by 29.4% growth underperformed value by 14.8% in 2001 growth underperform value by 12.4% in 20 2002 growth underperformed value by uh less than 1% in 2003 in 2004 growth underperformed value by 10.2% in 2005 growth underperformed value by 1.8% in 2006 growth underperformed value by 13.2% so this is the norm same in the 80s under Reagan 81 growth underperformed 83 84 86 88 growth underperformed um so there you go ladies and gentlemen\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nmoving along  cumulative flows into ETFs as a percentage of AUM uh money&#39;s moved out of Commodities in mass since 2022 uh till now so there&#39;s going to be a pony in that pile just like in 2001 this month&#39;s calendar configuration has historically resulted in meaningfully slower overall payroll growth so tomorrow&#39;s payroll report like I talked about with Kristen if that comes in softer like the ADP report did this week that is going to put a cap on yields and that&#39;s going to change a lot of Dynamics so just suck up the fits and starts for the next couple of weeks it&#39;s just going to be crazy town with",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nI can't wait for Baba I just want to see all these people chase up at 200 and um and that's the story but corporate net interest payments near record lows so that is not what you see at recession time uh January is historically a strong month for the market so we'll see if we get some follow through here S&P annual performance 1953 to 2024 so you can see uh it wouldn't be abnormal to get a bunch of good sticks together like you got in the late '90s but we should be open-minded for more subdued returns this year uh on the indices I think on you know there was so much money made in 2000 in 2001 and 2002 when when uh when people were losing 90% of their money in amazon.com by the way it's not because Amazon was a bad business the fundamentals were still improving it's just they paid too much money for what would ultimately take place 10 years down the road um you know people think that if you're cautious on a stock you're you're negative on the narrative and that has nothing to do with it it's price is what you pay value is what you get and um I think all of these things that are you know happening now with AI and Robotics and automated driving are going to change the world they're just not going to do it tomorrow and uh and these things are pricing like they've been doing it already for 10 years uh and that's why you get the first wash out of a cycle and uh and then you buy it we'll be buying it when they're quote unquote value stocks when what they're promising now actually starts to happen the stocks will be down when it's actually happening in reality those stocks will be down 80% we'll be buying them hand over fist and that's where you get the real run like you got in Amazon in the you know post great financial crisis took a long time for that stock to recover uh ex growth is leading value by nine percentage points so what you can see here is  that what I talked about with Kristen and others is that this is an aberration right here this outperformance and growth versus value this happened in the Zer zero interest rate policy environment uh if you believe rates are going back to zero then fine you should bet on this H persisting but data going back to 1927 value outperforms growth by 45% per year that's where fortunes are made and by the way going back to 2021 remember when you had the concentration of all that Tech well for the next seven years value outperformed growth by about 100% if you add up all these numbers so um take the other side I mean maybe it takes five more years for that flip to happen that's that's certainly possible but not probable based on uh how far the rubber band is stretched four-year presidential election cycle weekly sweet spot so you have post elction here a little bumpiness the first half and then it drives higher uh interestingly here so you can see the different indices and so on four-year presidential cycle midterm year week and sweet spot so post election little weakness q1 strong Q2 uh and so on and so forth and then um the midterm next year should be a lot more challenging uh and I I would almost think yeah we'll we'll take it as it comes but uh I'm I'm way more C cautious about next year but wouldn't surprise me if we extend because this bull market is so young um and we had the recession in 2020 and 2022 already that we get some push forward because you usually get one every 4.1 years so we got two in two years which gives us like six years of run way um and we're two years in so I I would you know let's let's see how things play out there are a lot of variables here I mean if we if we if we if we ship tanks into Greenland we might have to re-evaluate Chinese assets aren't off to a good start what that says about economic stimul oh this why did I post this because our friend is back she must have been on vacation uh in India or something because she's back to bash China and uh uh without fail here she goes uh us private construction spending starting to turn up uh percentage of S&P 500 members above their 200 day moving averages so this is where you want to be buyers not sellers uh just looking at the odds above the 20-day moving average again the nysse stocks above the 20-day moving average so this is you know this is where you see saw the October 2000 lows the fall 2022 lows where we were pounding the hell and then March 2020 3 and by the way we picked up a ton of smart people back then both in October 2022 and in March of 2023 sending in money when the market was in turmoil because they were listeners to the podcast I said now now now just like I'm saying now now now before the before the inauguration let's go let's go these things are priced for death this is this 100-year window is closing and it's closing fast uh and there will always be opportunities but you're only going to have a once in a 100 Year event every hundred years and we are getting the re we are getting the residual benefits of how things positioned responding to that and recovering from that that now it's into money-making mode Roaring 20s of the recovery of all these things that got smattered dstock to restock cycle Etc uh active managers selling in the selling down of course as they always do here's earnings estimates solid returns are normal after a 20% gain this is from Ryan Dietrich at Carson average uh after 20 20% gain the average return is 10.6% that is going back to 1950 so I would I think that's a reasonable expectation I've been saying 8 to 12 I like that 10.6 makes a whole lot of sense I mean Automotive Sales thanks my buddy Allen this this is uh um 16.8% annual 16.8 million annualized S I mean obviously you had some pull forward with the Florida and the EV tax credits fear wind down but at the end if we got anything close to 68 I mean it would just be un the thing would at 168 if you got not an annualized but an annual 16.8 which I think we're going to get in the next couple of years uh Cooper

Industrials and everything else\n\nthe Magnificent 7 is expected to generate earnings growth of 33% in 2024 which we talked about the rest of it S&P grow 3% so why did Max 7 they dramatically outperformed on earnings in 2024 uh but that&#39;s changing now UNM magnificent is going to low double digits the mag 7 is decelerating actually this is crazy town I thought mag 7 was decelerating to 21% they&#39;re decelerating to 18% and they&#39;re still trading at 33 times whereas the rest of the market is probably trading at 17 18 times with 11% earnings growth and then if you and then next year 16 uh uh mag 7 decelerates again to 16% and mag unmagnify accelerates to 133% so I don&#39;t need to you know here&#39;s all the countries cheapest is China uh most expensive us just another way of looking at it 10year treasury yield prior to First Cut and plus 100 days so historically you get this this bump and then a weakening on balance for the biggest weights this is very interesting treasury yield see Boost from Trump tariff threats so you haven&#39;t seen this type of shortterm boost ### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nover at RBC  thanks to my buddy over there what what do we got here uh okay so this is the S&P 500 yeah I think these things you know that&#39;s basically the max 7 now uh they&#39;re G to they got to consolidate it&#39;s bouncing back up here okay so that&#39;s the daily here&#39;s the equal weight this looks like it&#39;s put in a double bottom ready to move back up to 188 uh this is the NASDAQ kind of hanging out here after a breakout we&#39;ll see what happens with that then you&#39;ve got the Russell 2 2000s came broke out came all the way back in December to check I think this is going to be the story in 2025 sentiment is weakening a little bit then you got Europe has been just been grinding sideways for over a year I think that breaks out this year that&#39;s xus Tokyo week not interested hang saying again we came off those lows in early 2024 and then we checked back at the end of the year I think this is just to stair step higher over time and then just crank completely crank higher over time uh 10-year yield so you know it&#39;s up here against this resistance I think we&#39;re I think we&#39;re pretty much there if we get a few more weeks of hovering up here below five so be it just to bang out all the people shorten the hole suck in more shorts and then absolutely roast them all uh God bless him I can wait a few weeks not a big deal um so that&#39;s that and then you got the dollar same story here up against resistance at the 61.8 if that means anything I could care less uh a few more weeks suck in a lot more Longs and then just roast them and then Canadian dollar starting to come off the boil after Trudeau um I love these overshoots it gets you know it&#39;s just part of the game crude taking a little bit of a bid here on the daily that&#39;s that&#39;s expected gold has been weak everyone wanted it in in the fall now now it&#39;s uh let&#39;s see how that works out uh copper I think this is going to be a long story just like in 2001 I think uh the China stimulus they&#39;ve been P pushing a ton of stuff in the pipeline for a year and a half it&#39;s been peac meal but it&#39;s adding up materially and it&#39;s all going to hit at once and no one&#39;s going to be prepared for it and they&#39;re going to say what happened and and a lot of these stocks are going to double in a year and everyone&#39;s going to be interested in 2016 the best ideas are going to be CH they&#39;re all going to be touting China and international after 100% move and um you know uh that&#39;s the good news I mean I don&#39;t know if 100 I don&#39;t think 100% move is enough for us to be sold sold to you so we&#39;ll ride their exuberance for another year and then we&#39;ll just lay off to all the Johnny come lately but um uh all this stuff is just playing out as anticipated with a little overshoot on a couple but there we are semiconductors consolidating Nvidia we talked about with st uh you know 30 30 40 times sales 5050 times earnings decelerating growth um you know assumption that there will never be competition except every single semiconductor cycle for the last 40 years competition always comes uh a lot of people betting on this times it&#39;s different why because of recency bias because you know they weren&#39;t even through puberty the last semiconductor cycle and you know it&#39;s where we are uh Applied Materials okay so that&#39;s that anything else we want to see on This MC I like these drug stocks I like these big drug stocks Pepsi some of these things uh we&#39;re not doing anything yet you know Colgate probably interesting hasn&#39;t come down enough for us yet that&#39;s a great long-term business to own set and forget dividend Aristocrat grower a lot of these things haven&#39;t come down enough these High Flyers this ge story is perfect uh we were pounding on GE no one was listening I will say that uh I think this is going to be very similar to the Boeing turnaround story so when everyone&#39;s giving up on it uh that was the case with GE for sure and then the new CEO turns it around and Kelly ortberg is the guy Rockwell Collins six bagger in four four bagger in six years uh with Rockwell Collins wealth generator turnaround specialist uh as you can tell we bet a lot on our jockey all right so that was good stuff from slomer this just just keeping in p uh perspective what we&#39;ve been talking about since 2000 is we&#39;re only halfway through the cycle everyone was panicked here I said we got 10 plus more years now we&#39;ve got six plus more years and\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nmargins recovering free cash flow just off the charts uh almost $500 million of free cash flow for 2020 before you can&#39;t give it away I love this well some people started bidding it it was a double and now it&#39;s come back a little bit so uh you can give it away people were were taking it at 194 uh but um anyway this is what&#39;s really cool because I&#39;m like how you know 6% penetration what what what happens this is the adoption curve of um central air conditioning it looks a lot like it you know in from 1945 to 1950 to 1960 the first 15 years of central air conditioning the penetration rate was only 6.25% uh which is basically 205 to 2024 of uh uh generators Home standby generators and then it just completely hockey sticked after 1965 and went straight from 10% generation uh penetration to 80 8% penetration I think with what you&#39;re seeing with the grids and the demand that AI is going to have on the grids and everything else and air conditioners and everything else the instability and the weather and all that stuff I don&#39;t know if we ever get to 88% but I I I would be surprised if we didn&#39;t get to 30 or 40% over the next 10 15 years you see the same adoption curve with Home Security Alarms we&#39;re basically at zero in 1980 within the first 20 years got up to 19% now at 29% portable generators up to uh went from 0 to 20% so and then home standby generators so I think more and more I think this is going to be a feature when people build new houses as well uh in a more meaningful way you see residential up 27% year on-year if you look at last 12 months up 10.4 net sales up 99.6% on the quarter gross profit up 9% net income up 88% free cash flow up 56.5 5% year onye uh uh and uh last 12 months free cash flow up 178% pretty exciting uh free cash flow last 12 months 584 so nine times I

ratio to be cut at appropriate time when is the appropriate time right after the inauguration natural gas stocks have momentum and cold weather so this is uh everyone getting excited after all these stocks are up more than 100% in a few weeks take Warren Buffett&#39;s advice don&#39;t buy any stock in 2025 unless it passes this test two very simple test number one uh Buffett first determines whether he can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out or more the only type of companies you can do that in are not in high flyers or IPOs or new technologies where you&#39;re guessing and praying and hoping and chasing the crowd but for durable businesses that have been through many cycles that have a proven moat and you can understand the cyclicality and how the the fundamentals move relative to the price the fundamentals May deviate 5 10 15% if it&#39;s a big turnaround and the price deviates 80% so we love that I mean that Arbitrage I&#39;ll play all day long for the rest of my life like nobody&#39;s business it&#39;s what I love to do I&#39;m good at one single thing this tiny little Narrow Lane and I don&#39;t deviate I really don&#39;t do private deals I don&#39;t uh invest in it I I just eat my own cooking everything I do everything I talk about is where I put all my money all my money is where my mouth is um and um and then the second test is to buy a stock only if it trades quote at a reasonable price relative to the lower end of his historic earnings range he will buy a stock only if it&#39;s reasonably valued using this approach again if the stock doesn&#39;t pass this second step he moves on so you know I have a different filter which is pretty much the same filter number one is um if this so I&#39;m more about protecting the downside the upside takes care of itself if this stock was to go to zero would they take me out on a stretcher because there can always be things that that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and there&#39;s no way you could know so that deals with sizing and risk so if you have a you know High conviction 8 10 12% position and the world ends and it takes you out you got your other nine that are doubles or triples over the next few years using the same framework they&#39;re going to more than amply compensate uh the good news is you know the DI Minimus probability of that ever happening is so small but you have to hedge against the possibility ever happening so that&#39;s number one number two is if I was to walk into the boardroom of this company and offer to buy the entire company at the price it was currently Mo marked in the public markets would the board call security to have me escorted out of the building because I was absolutely crazy and insulting to offer to buy the company at that price and if the answer is no meaning they would take the meeting because they think that might be a fair price then I&#39;m not interested I&#39;m not buying it and um and that you just learn with experience over time and that&#39;s why they call me turnaround Tom uh Chinese companies have sidest stepped Trump&#39;s tariffs they could do it again Ulta beauty stock jumps new CEO goes a long way it&#39;s another one we&#39;ve got our eyes on my kids are in Ulta and Sephora all the time uh China&#39;s Central Bank outlines monetary policies for 2025 emphasizing expanding domestic demand of which Alibaba is the number one toll taker for the middle class and upper class quality items Teemu sells the garbage disposable crap to poor people uh and uh their numbers as we&#39;ve said for many months either unsustainable which is now proving to be the case or unreliable which um we shall see stabilizing expectations and stimulating Vitality to ensure sustained Improvement in the Chinese economy uh AI has a cost problem what it means for the other for the stock market and five things to know so what they&#39;re just saying is that every $200 a month subscription that Sam Alman sells he loses money on because every search query costs 10 times the cost of a Google Search and um uh $1,000 of computing power per task so it&#39;s just a losing business and then the people that are buying all these chips are not getting an amp ample return on investment which is why you&#39;re getting decelerating uh earnings growth all these great things are going to come true okay just like all the great things that Amazon have done have come true the difference was Amazon fell 90% from 2000 to 2003 or whatever it was despite fundamentals kind of improving because they were people were already paying as if all the things that came true over the next 15 years were already happening and um uh it always takes a little longer all these things take a little bit longer so getting in on the second phase when people have thrown in the towel is really uh a great opportunity China confirmed xinping and Donald Trump have been in touch since the US

change CEOs creative directors potential return a Chinese consumer is there room for a turn around I think so I mean we get a question on Curry on uh uh Burberry every single week I&#39;ve looked at it a few times and I&#39;ve continue to say no because even when China was doing well the stock couldn&#39;t get out of its own way it&#39;s done nothing for basically 12 years so for me and uh and I think that&#39;s consistent with the fundamentals I think it&#39;s just a dead brand and uh you know maybe you can get some miracle worker in there and get a pump for a couple years but look free cash flow is is well below 12 years ago the reason the Stock&#39;s gone nowhere and and uh nothing&#39;s happening is because the cash flow has gone nowhere it&#39;s gone down revenues have gone nowhere they&#39;ve gone down so uh just because the prices gone down doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a cheap stock uh so for me no no real interest CG might be a different story uh k e r i g yeah this thing is still in massive distribution but it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely probably more interesting uh k e r i n g I mean I mean this is not a mystery like the the stock has really gone down with free cash flow so you got to understand the turnaround situation looks like cash flow is starting to recover a little bit let&#39;s take a look at um I think this one let&#39;s see fashion leather goods jul okay Gucci St lauron Anana bad Bion blah blah blah blah yeah this is kind of more interesting it&#39;s a little more Diversified than um yeah I mean it&#39;s training 1.5 T sales uh you got a dividend on here I mean if you if you put a gun in my said head and said pick pick one I&#39;d say uh CG for sure but I don&#39;t think this thing&#39;s going to turn around right away I think this is going to take a couple years to uh find new buyers could be wrong on that but uh you know this is a lot of institutional destruction it&#39;s going to take a long time to rebuild a share base uh Kyle meum hey Tom you mentioned last week that a lot of Yen carry trade funds are focused on the mag s [Music] yeah I mean look if they&#39;re in the S&amp;P 500 they&#39;re focused on the mag 7 so um bottom line is when the Yen carry trade on wines the thing that&#39;s going to get hit the the biggest is the heaviest weights which is the mag7 which also has another reason which is decelerated earnings growth so nothing new there what do you think about GPC I know you&#39;re in investing in Autos like CPS and AAP I mean GPC is a better quality business but you have much less up side with the same amount of risk so uh I know that Mommy and Daddy tell you to buy the best quality company in the industry uh and that&#39;s perfectly fine and good advice uh you know but if you&#39;re looking for doubles and triples over a few years uh you&#39;re not going to get that when everyone&#39;s already seeing what you see and the stock is fully priced so uh for me it&#39;s a pass but if you bought it and held it I don&#39;t think you&#39;d really be disappointed but you&#39;re just not going to get double and triples Jessica Lily thank you for all you do you&#39;re welcome thank you I thought I would chime in as I&#39;ve been a nurse for 25 years when backers manufacturing facility went down due to weather we were completely backordered on IV fluid and no facility anywhere I talked to could get fluids it shows you that they basically have a monopoly on IV fluids so thank you for that feedback um m m uh cus since your interviews with Kiko then David limb to become okay what kind of economic oh you seem to be overall bullish on 2025 what kind of economic DAV surveys yield curves would you make you revaluate your current stance um yeah decline you know earnings coming down uh materially um what opinion would make you feel wrong so Mor is you know reading all the the Doom porn blogs I&#39;m sure and they&#39;re all telling them get out of your stocks blah blah blah um you know I don&#39;t want to be in certain stocks I I I definitely think there could be stocks that get hit hard I just I know what the margin of safety is in my stocks and like literally the market could collapse 50% tomorrow and I wouldn&#39;t feel uncomfortable in any one of my positions because I&#39;m buying them at with such a margin now might the price get impaired for a short period of time sure the price could get impaired for a short period of time but when you&#39;re running on low and no leverage it&#39;s not an issue it&#39;s you you still own the same percentage of the business uh and Etc so um you know for all these people saying the guild covers onver there were toast uh we&#39;re going to have a recession let me remind you we had the recession that everyone is looking for in 2022 with two quarters of negative GDP growth which followed a recession in 2020 we had two recessions that is the definition of of a technical recession in 2 years average is 4.1 so we pulled forward eight years of recessions in two years we have Runway we have liquidity when the facts change I will change my mind right now there&#39;s nothing that supports that fact other than a bunch of people trying to sell you clicks and take you out of your stocks at the exact wrong time now if your portfolio is paler in Nvidia good luck you may experience a DE while a good portion of the other stocks go up or you may experience a double I can&#39;t predict that because I can&#39;t value it I cannot predict the future so those are not stocks for me and again I will say and continue to reiterate there are many paths to the top of the mountain my path is not the only way there are plenty of ways to make money in and out of the stock market I just do the one that I am very good at and that I have confidence and I can sleep like a baby at night because I know what I own and they have relatively predictable business models cash flows revenues Etc now you can you can go into the prediction game and make a ton of money gamble in your right you could also hit you know 31 on the roulette wheel and you know multibag your money and your bet but the odds of reliably predicting the future and guessing on the next Technologies are limited which is why Buffett never did it and he was a greatest compounder of wealth in the history of humankind so uh okay Jesse James question on TMO as you think healthcare would recover uh would someone do well buying some more high quality life SS like thermofisher uh uh I think thermofisher is historically pretty good business uh so again this is a 15 bagger in 10 years where were you at $40 why now I mean let&#39;s take a look at the fundamentals doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be a 15 bagger again but odds don&#39;t favor it um yeah so cash flows have been flat for four years you know it&#39;s it&#39;s fully valued it&#39;s an okay business but I mean this is the type of thing that if you&#39;re lucky it goes from 5 544 maybe to 750 but like if if anything goes wrong this thing could fall to 250 in a minute so like you&#39;re you&#39;re okay but I just don&#39;t see the a I look for asymmetry so for me there&#39;s no asymmetry like there&#39;s always the risk of what you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know in a stock so a business that I&#39;m going to get like a 20 30% return and I and I have a possibility of there&#39;s something out there lurking that I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t I&#39;m not interested in like I have to get paid double triple quadruple Plus for me to take any risk with capital and then I have to know my downside is totally protected so solvency risk comes first then cash flow then Revenue then understanding the cyclicality then understanding the management then understanding the the durable Mo the durability of the moat uh so for me to do all that work I got to get paid baby and and it&#39;s got to be a double triple so for these type of things it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not interesting to me but thank you for sending in a great question uh J JM Smith take a look at ew yeah we keep looking at ew every week um ew is fine uh but again show me how the cash flow is going to recover because it&#39;s absolutely collapsed so this probably will recover I I just uh it&#39;s worth doing work on for sure it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an okay call it&#39;s an okay call but you got to do your work and really understand how durable are their products I I I think it&#39;s a pretty solid compounder over time but for me it&#39;s it&#39;s a not I don&#39;t have any urgency to do a lot of work on this one I&#39;ll just leave it at that but it&#39;s interesting so I think your framework is good uh you just need to get some confidence in how they&#39;re going to turn around the free cash flow story and if you can get it towards that inflection you know you might have a over 3 to 5 years on this but more likely 50 to 75% which doesn&#39;t really pass my IR hurdle um Dan Abasi thanks for sharing your knowledge could you take a look at wns Holdings okay so this thing is haved what do they do cash flow has been flat for five years stock price is basically trading where it was five years ago no shocker gross margins let&#39;s take a look here first off what do they do voice analytical business transformation Services worldwide package good such as customer service analytics Human Resources outsourc I they do like 80 different things I can&#39;t even understand this so if you can actually figure out what the hell they do and how they&#39;re going to get this thing to uh re accelerate growth then I&#39;m interested just on the basis of what I&#39;m seeing uh it&#39;s not motivating me to do any further work on it to be honest with you so um it does look like a good trade but uh I&#39;m not that interested thank uh reload the page let me just see here balance sheet get this a little smaller okay that didn&#39;t help okay let&#39;s see here 240 liabilities 102 that&#39;s fine income statement income is growing what&#39;s happening [Music] to share count see share counts okay let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening in the margins it&#39;s holding up I do a little more work uh I would say that you have to understand why is it down and what is the plan and to get cash flow growing again make cash flow great again they&#39;ve not been doing that so what&#39;s the plan that&#39;s the name of the game Oleg Shak shakarov thoughts on Nike we&#39;ve covered this every week it&#39;s fine we like VF better be for the same reason because it&#39;s not an easy double uh like many of the other things that were in uh you&#39;ll just get a decent trade for a lot of risk R uh don&#39;t don&#39;t understand why you pick CCI over AMT because again Miriam I&#39;m not in things for 30 40% returns I&#39;m in things for double minimum and you&#39;re not going to get that from the quote highest quality business that&#39;s already fully priced uh when the we&#39;re looking for leverage without taking leverage so that when we when when the sector when everything turns we get the most bang for our buck and we get Asm not an incremental return to something that&#39;s fully valued because everyone already knows it&#39;s the best business in the group you know Advanced Auto Parts is the shittiest Auto retailer we know that we&#39;re not blind but it&#39;s the only one that the last four times it had 630 million doll of operating income it traded between $180 and $220 uh um and that&#39;s Management&#39;s Target New Management Catalyst Target uh for 2027 and the stock $45 so um that&#39;s that okay uh Mr Hayes I know main focus is China for emerging markets but what are your thoughts outlook on Mexico uh not for me I mean maybe I&#39;d buy Walmart Mexico or something I haven&#39;t even looked at it but no too much turbulence Trump is going to be like bashing them every day for paying for the wall taking the wall down I I have no idea but it&#39;s not going to be fun for Mexico but I do think Mexico&#39;s demographics business everything is great um I just don&#39;t really want to invest there Griffin Brown I just graduated as a public investor as a private investor you know would I want to set up a factory there yeah but I&#39;m not a private investor it&#39;s not what I do uh I just graduate college I this is like a five-page question uh how do you feel about Nike the same way I feel every week it&#39;s good not great it&#39;s going to work but not as much as some of our others uh thank you for the question Griffin Brown uh okay so thank you for that Griffin good stuff all right\n\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nthoughts on Petra Bross we&#39;ve covered this a million times not for me 21% dividend all you need is that socialist to wake up and cut the dividend I mean no way um Jason Zen Sebastian p uh National Retail properties n that&#39;s not for me and no there are not other reats I really want to look at other than crown castle right now I it&#39;s probably okay but it&#39;s pulled back like two cents so now you&#39;re excited with the 10% pullback it&#39;s there&#39;s no asymmetry there I&#39;m not interested I don&#39;t buy things for dividends um craft hind I think it&#39;s okay I think a bunch of these like Pepsi and uh Hershey and they&#39;re going to do probably a bit better this year I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer of Pepsi but yeah these things haven&#39;t come in enough so um that one&#39;s probably okay I took a brief look at it this week again uh what are your thoughts about macroeconomic challenges in Brazil also Latin America as a whole I&#39;m not ready to do anything in either of those markets the a imetry is better in China because the worst case is already in in China whereas those places it could get worse before it gets better but I think all Emerging Markets are going to work I just don&#39;t have any pound the table companies that are priced with the asymmetry I need to take the risk of $1 uh and get many dollars back and I&#39;m just not finding them to the level of comfort that I want there are beat up things I could buy but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t have comfort you know it&#39;s taking country risk geopolitical risk company risk all of that stuff so you have to buy the highest quality and I&#39;m not finding the highest quality at levels that I want them so for now it&#39;s a pass but I&#39;m finding it all day long uh with Alibaba so that&#39;s where it is for today we&#39;ll be back next week same time same place in the meantime make it a great one",

this year so ba founder Robin Lee predicts exponential boom in AI apps for 2025 well thank you for the prediction but being that Alibaba is the number one player we will be the number one beneficiary so appreciate the optimism for your competitor Bloomberg China&#39;s pboc vales more support for Innovation and consumption so again they just keep pushing the ball underwater when they when their hands are released the ball will absolutely pop uh GM Ford report best annual us Sal since 2019 as Auto Recovery continues I love it for Cooper standard people aren&#39;t paying attention and you get that opportunity as we have have been taking advantage of hand over fist pboc reiterates China cut rates Reserve ratio to be cut at appropriate time when is the appropriate time right after the inauguration natural gas stocks have momentum and cold weather so this is uh everyone getting excited after all these stocks are up more than 100% in a few weeks take Warren Buffett&#39;s advice don&#39;t buy any stock in 2025 unless it passes this test two very simple test number one uh Buffett first determines whether he can sensibly estimate an earnings range for five years out or more the only type of companies you can do that in are not in high flyers or IPOs or new technologies where you&#39;re guessing and praying and hoping and chasing the crowd but for durable businesses that have been through many cycles that have a proven moat and you can understand the cyclicality and how the the fundamentals move relative to the price the fundamentals May deviate 5 10 15% if it&#39;s a big turnaround and the price deviates 80% so we love that I mean that Arbitrage I&#39;ll play all day long for the rest of my life like nobody&#39;s business it&#39;s what I love to do I&#39;m good at one single thing this tiny little Narrow Lane and I don&#39;t deviate I really don&#39;t do private deals I don&#39;t uh invest in it I I just eat my own cooking everything I do everything I talk about is where I put all my money all my money is where my mouth is um and um and then the second test is to buy a stock only if it trades quote at a reasonable price relative to the lower end of his historic earnings range he will buy a stock only if it&#39;s reasonably valued using this approach again if the stock doesn&#39;t pass this second step he moves on so you know I have a different filter which is pretty much the same filter number one is um if this so I&#39;m more about protecting the downside the upside takes care of itself if this stock was to go to zero would they take me out on a stretcher because there can always be things that that you don&#39;t know that you don&#39;t know and there&#39;s no way you could know so that deals with sizing and risk so if you have a you know High conviction 8 10 12% position and the world ends and it takes you out you got your other nine that are doubles or triples over the next few years using the same framework they&#39;re going to more than amply compensate uh the good news is you know the DI Minimus probability of that ever happening is so small but you have to hedge against the possibility ever happening so that&#39;s number one number two is if I was to walk into the boardroom of this company and offer to buy the entire company at the price it was currently Mo marked in the public markets would the board call security to have me escorted out of the building because I was absolutely crazy and insulting to offer to buy the company at that price and if the answer is no meaning they would take the meeting because they think that might be a fair price then I&#39;m not interested I&#39;m not buying it and um and that you just learn with experience over time and that&#39;s why they call me turnaround Tom uh Chinese companies have sidest stepped Trump&#39;s tariffs they could do it again Ulta beauty stock jumps new CEO goes a long way it&#39;s another one we&#39;ve got our eyes on my kids are in Ulta and Sephora all the time uh China&#39;s Central Bank outlines monetary policies for 2025 emphasizing expanding domestic demand of which Alibaba is the number one toll taker for the middle class and upper class quality items Teemu sells the garbage disposable crap to poor people uh and uh their numbers as we&#39;ve said for many months either unsustainable which is now proving to be the case or unreliable which um we shall see stabilizing expectations and stimulating Vitality to ensure sustained Improvement in the Chinese economy uh AI has a cost problem what it means for the other for the stock market and five things to know so what they&#39;re just saying is that every $200 a month subscription that Sam Alman sells he loses money on because every search query costs 10 times the cost of a Google Search and um uh $1,000 of computing power per task so it&#39;s just a losing business and then the people that are buying all these chips are not getting an amp ample return on investment which is why you&#39;re getting decelerating uh earnings growth all these great things are going to come true okay just like all the great things that Amazon have done have come true the difference was Amazon fell 90% from 2000 to 2003 or whatever it was despite fundamentals kind of improving because they were people were already paying as if all the things that came true over the next 15 years were already happening and um uh it always takes a little longer all these things take a little bit longer so getting in on the second phase when people have thrown in the towel is really uh a great opportunity China confirmed xinping and Donald Trump have been in touch since the US election Trudeau resignation opens the door for Trump going easier on trade tariffs with Canada especially if Wayne Gretzky becomes Governor you can&#39;t make this stuff up I think I think would be great by the way you know he&#39;s a winner what else do you want to know uh Disney links inks deal to combine Hulu Plus live TV business into fubo I like this deal I use fubo because they have better Sports than YouTube TV I liked YouTube TV I use fubo uh and they let me screen screenshot uh some of the things when I do TV Etc which YouTube blocked me and all that stuff so uh they&#39;re too cute by half and um and then and and the interesting thing was I kept looking at fubo to buy and I just couldn&#39;t get my hands around I&#39;m like they&#39;re kind of you know you know kind of flailing in the wind and now with this deal we own 70% of fubo through our ownership in Disney I love this it&#39;s just like all the great things we own through Alibaba without actually having to own it uh directly uh on a standalone basis so this is a home run uh and that&#39;s that so Bob Iger strikes again good job there Disney stock gets an upgrade amid content Renaissance and streaming profit growth remember when we got involved 70s 8s you couldn&#39;t give it away uh people said the streaming is losing money it&#39;s never going to turn well they did it they turned profitable they&#39;re huge they I mean same story over and over we had to go through the whole bass family to convince you and this and that this happens every Cycles but that&#39;s what Buffett&#39;s talking about of being able to estimate the turnarounds and the cyclical because you see these things happen over and over again they just found a new way to sell the content their amazing Content Library in 1984 when the bass family took a huge position in it they went from uh you know movie theaters to VHS then they caught another run in the 90s with DVDs and now they&#39;re catching another run with with streaming but streaming is better than DVDs because it recurs every single month uh you weren&#39;t selling someone one new DVD every single month guaranteed uh which is just beautiful so fed isn&#39;t certain where interest rates will head minutes show inflation and Trump are concerned so uh my guess is nowhere until probably June but let&#39;s see how it goes China ramps up you unless the labor part if the labor market starts weakening a little bit they will be all over that and cutting again in March they seem a little bit more worried about the labor market than inflation China ramps up Yuan support with record Hong Kong bill issue so they&#39;re on it here we&#39;re ramping up just in time for people to be on the

      "### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nTom I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on both Burberry and or carrying both luxury plays have been beaten down both change CEOs creative directors potential return a Chinese consumer is there room for a turn around I think so I mean we get a question on Curry on uh uh Burberry every single week I&#39;ve looked at it a few times and I&#39;ve continue to say no because even when China was doing well the stock couldn&#39;t get out of its own way it&#39;s done nothing for basically 12 years so for me and uh and I think that&#39;s consistent with the fundamentals I think it&#39;s just a dead brand and uh you know maybe you can get some miracle worker in there and get a pump for a couple years but look free cash flow is is well below 12 years ago the reason the Stock&#39;s gone nowhere and and uh nothing&#39;s happening is because the cash flow has gone nowhere it&#39;s gone down revenues have gone nowhere they&#39;ve gone down so uh just because the prices gone down doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a cheap stock uh so for me no no real interest CG might be a different story uh k e r i g yeah this thing is still in massive distribution but it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely probably more interesting uh k e r i n g I mean I mean this is not a mystery like the the stock has really gone down with free cash flow so you got to understand the turnaround situation looks like cash flow is starting to recover a little bit let&#39;s take a look at um I think this one let&#39;s see fashion leather goods jul okay Gucci St lauron Anana bad Bion blah blah blah blah yeah this is kind of more interesting it&#39;s a little more Diversified than um yeah I mean it&#39;s training 1.5 T sales uh you got a dividend on here I mean if you if you put a gun in my said head and said pick pick one I&#39;d say uh CG for sure but I don&#39;t think this thing&#39;s going to turn around right away I think this is going to take a couple years to uh find new buyers could be wrong on that but uh you know this is a lot of institutional destruction it&#39;s going to take a long time to rebuild a share base"
