[130.319s] this is going to give a broad
[132.28s] comprehensive overview got to join

[144.959s] Brooke halis produced a segment thanks
[147.68s] to Katherine Myers obviously thanks to
[149.599s] Liz Clayman and Taylor rigs so we&#39;re
[152.4s] going to listen in here show joining me
[154.8s] now great Hill Capital chairman Thomas
[157.36s] Hayes and slat Stone wealth Chief Market
[159.519s] strategist Kenny pocari great to have
[162.12s] you both with me uh Thomas let me start
[164.36s] with you just in terms of the action
[165.879s] today big Tech you know leading today
[168.76s] all lies on tonight do you see big Tech
[171.4s] AI as another sort of big theme powering
[174.08s] this rally for the rest of the year I
[176.319s] think that uh actually magnificent 7
[179.44s] will do do okay but probably not as well
[182.599s] as last year you know last year you had
[184.36s] much higher earnings growth this year
[186.12s] that uh earnings growth is going to
[187.44s] decelerate for the Magnificent 7 from
[189.319s] 33% down to 21% and you&#39;re paying 33
[192.799s] times uh 33 times earnings so I think
[195.2s] the theme for 2025 could be the last
[198.44s] shall be first and you could start to
[200.92s] look at some sectors that really
[202.4s] underperformed in 2024 before we get to
[205.319s] those Kenny you weigh in do you see mag
[207.72s] 7 as maybe not the biggest performer for
[212.48s] 2025 I I I agree with Tom I think
[214.92s] they&#39;re gonna I think they&#39;re still
[216.04s] going to perform well I don&#39;t think
[217.36s] you&#39;re going to see a repeat of what
[218.959s] happened in 2024 but I think there&#39;s
[220.959s] another group within Tech that&#39;s really
[222.64s] starting to raise its head and that&#39;s
[223.959s] the quantum Computing side there&#39;s been
[225.56s] a lot of talk about over the last couple
[227.2s] of weeks a lot of very interesting names
[229.239s] they&#39;re having really really interesting
[231.56s] action uh some of these stocks really
[233.56s] being gobbled up because of what Quantum
[236.239s] means for the future of AI and how it&#39;s
[238.76s] going to continue to change kind of that
[240.48s] landscape so while I agree with Tom that
[242.439s] I don&#39;t think the mag 7&#39;s going to
[243.879s] continue to have the great great year
[245.48s] I&#39;m certainly not a seller of the mag s
[247.64s] at all yeah that makes sense Thomas so
[250.079s] talk to me what you mean the last shall
[252.079s] be first explain well if you look at two
[255.12s] sectors that dramatically underperformed
[257.239s] healthc care and materials were both
[258.959s] only up low single digits in 2024 but if
[262.759s] you look forward to 2025 they have among
[265.28s] the highest expected earnings growth
[267.24s] Healthcare is going to grow earnings
[268.56s] 20.4%
[270.08s] uh percent materials is going to grow
[272.24s] earnings
[273.8s] 17.4% so we think there&#39;s a lot of
[275.72s] opportunity there and we think it&#39;s
[277.28s] consistent with value could start to see
[280.6s] a bid those
[282.479s] unmagnify could could start to see a bid
[284.919s] in 2025 it&#39;s the cheapest value has been
[288.44s] relative to growth since 2000 and since
[291.36s] 1980 which were two generational
[293.44s] opportunities to buy value Kenny do you
[296.0s] agree with that particularly when it
[297.68s] comes to healthcare
[300.0s] I I do because that to Tom&#39;s point that
[302.039s] those two sectors were the
[303.16s] underperformers now if they grow at the
[305.8s] rate Tom says they&#39;re going to grow that
[307.4s] is the expectation so if they grow at
[309.6s] that rate certainly that they should be
[311.96s] uh close to the outperformers of 2025
[314.759s] now that&#39;s still up in the air right we
[316.36s] have to see if they&#39;re going to if how
[318.24s] this how earnings is going to start and
[319.88s] what the projections look like to verify
[321.96s] or not those earnings growth rate but
[323.84s] one way or the other you know to to
[325.52s] Tom&#39;s point the last could be first you
[327.479s] could see some of these sectors that
[328.72s] were the underperforming really kind of
[330.759s] take over and I&#39;m assuming in healthcare
[332.8s] it&#39;s not just what Eli Lil noo noris
[336.12s] giving me my glp1 right there&#39;s got to
[338.36s] be a better name in healthcare yeah we
[341.039s] like uh xbi which is a basket of biotech
[343.8s] stocks the same thing happened in Trump
[345.919s] 1.0 as soon as he got elected the the
[348.6s] whole basket sold off in anticipation he
[350.759s] was going to tear up the Affordable Care
[352.319s] Act Right now it&#39;s down because of RFK
[354.88s] Jr after the inauguration biotech
[357.24s] rallied in 2017 over 75 % the next 12
[360.72s] months we think there&#39;s huge opportunity
[362.44s] why deregulation FDA is going to approve
[364.8s] more drugs FTC is going to approve more
[366.88s] deals big farmer record cash on their
[368.96s] balance sheets they need Innovation
[370.36s] they&#39;re going to use that cash to buy
[371.8s] biotech companies at record low
[373.72s] valuation Kenny do you agree that the
[375.759s] RFK fear within healthc care will be
[379.56s] sort of resolved soon as perhaps they
[382.16s] realize that he I don&#39;t know maybe is is
[384.72s] it more bark than it is
[387.24s] bite no no I I actually think I actually
[390.36s] think that having RFK come on as the
[392.52s] health Zar might actually be good we&#39;ll
[394.52s] see a lot of things maybe uh uh remade
[397.68s] right there are there are Cals in this
[399.199s] country that aren&#39;t allowed in other
[400.4s] countries because of what we put them in
[402.199s] here in this country and he&#39;s trying to
[403.96s] fight against that to actually make them
[405.68s] healthier so I&#39;m all for it but yes I do
[408.199s] think we saw like big names in
[409.639s] healthcare Lily and all that kind of
[411.36s] come off on that original uh RFK uh move
[414.68s] but I think we&#39;re going to see a bounce
[416.08s] back in some of the biggest uh uh
[418.12s] Healthcare names all right well I love
[420.039s] having you both great to have you Thomas
[421.879s] here in studio and Kenny always fun to
[423.599s] see you there uh down in Florida I
[425.96s] suppose all right now just to recap
[428.36s] Market&#39;s
[429.319s] open and we&#39;re back then on Tuesday
[433.479s] morning I had the privilege to join uh
[436.599s] the great Stuart vanney and that&#39;s
[439.08s] Lauren Simonetti absolutely incredible I
[442.36s] want to thank Preston miselle and of
[445.039s] course Christian dagger for booking me
[447.36s] on the show uh absolutely great we had
[450.36s] we got to talk about my favorite subject
[452.879s] which is NVIDIA and Icarus came into the
[455.68s] story for those of you who know a little
[457.16s] bit of Greek mythology we&#39;ll talk about
[459.72s] that but we also talked about price
[461.879s] versus value so we&#39;re going to listen in
[463.68s] here let&#39;s bring in Thomas Thomas Hayes
[466.36s] um you&#39;re watching a market for us now
[469.0s] are Jensen hang&#39;s comments going to push
[471.68s] Nvidia to new highs I think so you&#39;re
[474.56s] familiar with the story of Icarus the
[476.199s] bad news is Jensen Wong is flying too
[478.319s] close to the Sun the good news news is
[480.199s] his wings are not melting yet and uh I
[482.72s] think that the the company&#39;s at $3.7
[485.12s] trillion it wants to probably push to 4
[487.68s] trillion that would be 8% I think Beyond
[490.319s] then like every semiconductor cycle
[493.159s] right now he has no competition
[494.68s] competition is coming and as far as
[497.08s] training the robots and training the
[498.599s] cars virtually what could go wrong right
[501.24s] versus having to put the cars out on the
[502.879s] roads you&#39;re putting it in a in a studio
[505.0s] we&#39;ll see what happens but on balances
[507.4s] is a positive thing for NVIDIA probably
[509.08s] pushes a little bit higher from most of
[510.599s] the people watching this program who
[512.2s] have any investment in the stock market
[514.24s] have some money in the Magnificent 7even
[516.399s] big tech stocks in a nutshell give us
[518.719s] your forecast for the Magnificent s in
[521.279s] 2025 okay but not quite as good as 2024
[524.92s] why because earnings growth is
[526.72s] decelerating they had 33% earnings
[529.0s] growth last year they&#39;re going to have
[530.279s] 21% earnings growth this year and the
[532.76s] multiple has not yet rated downward you
[535.959s] compare that to the broadening of the
[537.519s] rally small caps are accelerating
[540.0s] earnings growth from 8% to 21% but you
[543.48s] only pay 15 16 times for that earnings
[546.0s] growth versus the mag 7 you&#39;re still
[547.56s] paying 33 times same growth half the
[550.16s] multiple where are you putting your
[551.279s] money to small caps look better yeah
[553.48s] I&#39;ll see about that Tom Hayes great
[555.0s] stuff thanks for joining us the
[556.6s] international long
[559.079s] shoreman&#39;s and we&#39;re back then I had the
[562.519s] privilege to join Kristen Scher down at
[564.6s] the New York Stock Exchange this was a
[567.24s] comprehensive 2020 five Outlook and two
[572.12s] picks that we don&#39;t get a lot of
[573.399s] opportunity to talk about uh so you&#39;re
[575.76s] really going to enjoy this one uh and
[578.2s] here we go as we dive into the markets
[581.36s] now just one full week into January I do
[583.72s] want to bring in Thomas Hayes is a chair
[585.56s] and managing member at Grey Hill Capital
[587.839s] Thomas great to have you on the show
[589.76s] great to be here Kristen and as we start
[591.72s] this New Year so much Focus as to what
[593.92s] is in store for stocks we&#39;ve seen some
[596.16s] choppiness the S&amp;P just about 3% though
[598.88s] from its record high what are you
[601.0s] watching yeah I think this year is going
[603.04s] to be a year of slightly more subdued
[605.36s] returns and a rotation so it&#39;s not going
[607.44s] to be as easy as parking the money in
[608.839s] the indices and watching the mag 7 take
[611.36s] you to the promised land I think what
[613.32s] you&#39;re seeing is uh the
[615.6s] deceleration in the earnings growth of
[617.76s] the mag magnificent 7 so they had 33%
[621.0s] earnings growth in 2024 that&#39;s going to
[623.36s] decelerate down to 21% in
[626.44s] 2025 however you&#39;re paying 33 times
[629.0s] earning for it so you haven&#39;t seen any
[630.92s] D- rating in the mag 7 and if you
[633.519s] contrast that to Small caps their
[635.959s] earnings growth is going from 8% in 2024
[638.88s] to 21% in 2025 and you only pay 16 times
[643.519s] so half the multiple for the same
[645.36s] earnings growth I think we&#39;re going to
[646.6s] see a lot of fits and starts as the
[649.079s] market starts to recognize where the
[650.88s] value is uhhuh what does that mean for
[652.839s] the rest of the market knowing that the
[654.76s] mag 7 is expensive yeah I think you&#39;re
[658.079s] going to see huge opportunities under
[660.12s] the surface in the
[662.639s] unmagnify uh some of the areas that got
[664.76s] hit exceptionally hard in December you
[667.12s] know we we did see the broadening start
[669.24s] in Earnest in July of last year and it
[671.88s] really hummed along until November and
[673.92s] then there was this abrupt Interruption
[676.32s] as yields blew out as uh fears around
[679.04s] the FED in December uh we saw the exact
[682.16s] same thing in Trump 1.0 right after he
[684.839s] got elected the dollar rallied yields
[687.44s] rallied between the election and the
[688.92s] inaug
[689.8s] after the inauguration all of that
[691.44s] cooled down MH because we&#39;re talking
[693.519s] about yields and the economy I do want
[695.079s] to get your take Thomas on the ad print
[697.8s] that we saw today because yields have
[699.839s] been such a topic of conversation in
[701.72s] terms of the direction of this Market
[703.92s] 122,000 a little bit less than was what
[706.8s] was actually expected by economists what
[710.36s] might this mean for that non-farm
[712.0s] payrolls report on Friday yeah we keep
[714.36s] toggling between bad news is good news
[716.32s] good news is good news I think this is a
[718.72s] situation given what yields have done we
[721.2s] do want to see a little bit cooler labor
[724.24s] market to keep the FED possibly in the
[726.399s] game number one and to put a cap on
[728.04s] yields yields have really blown out a
[729.48s] little bit since the election just like
[730.959s] we saw in 2016 I think a cooler report
[734.24s] if the ADP is any indicator of the
[735.959s] non-farm payrolls report on Friday
[737.8s] that&#39;s going to be a very good thing for
[739.079s] the market yields will start to calm
[741.399s] down and compress uh and uh the FED
[744.079s] stays in the game and equities will like
[745.839s] that International has been out of favor
[748.76s] for a long time does 2025 change that I
[752.839s] think it&#39;s in line with the theme of
[754.639s] what I&#39;m talking about price is what you
[756.12s] pay value is what you get you&#39;re going
[757.44s] to have over 133% earnings growth in
[760.16s] international it&#39;s trading at 15.5 times
[762.839s] earnings in the US you&#39;re going to get
[764.839s] 14% earnings growth and it&#39;s trading at
[767.12s] 22 23 times so the thing that people
[770.32s] forget because we we&#39;re all creatures of
[772.56s] habit recency bias right since
[776.199s] 1927 value has outperformed growth by
[780.32s] 4.4% per year okay only in the zero
[784.8s] interest rate environment since 2010
[787.88s] have you seen growth dramatically
[789.76s] outperform value so unless you believe
[792.68s] we&#39;re going back to zero interest rates
[794.639s] you want to have some lower price value
[797.12s] in your portfolio you don&#39;t have to ship
[798.76s] the boat all the way right away but
[801.12s] start to ease into to where where
[802.6s] there&#39;s value and opportunity and still
[804.079s] growth in earnings power particular
[805.76s] stocks then Thomas that are on your
[807.839s] radar yeah well I&#39;m known around these
[810.12s] parts as turnaround Tom CU I like buying
[812.24s] stocks that are down a lot but have an
[815.16s] opportunity to turn around one is
[816.839s] Advanced Auto Parts they&#39;re an auto
[818.44s] retailer they got absolutely decimated
[821.0s] they overexpanded they brought in a new
[822.959s] CEO Shane o Kelly he came from HD Supply
[825.68s] was a $7 billion business so what has he
[827.44s] done he&#39;s taken solvency risk off the
[829.6s] table he sold the westpack Canada
[831.279s] business 1.5 billion paid down debt he&#39;s
[834.079s] closing all the non-performing stores in
[835.8s] the West Coast that are very spread out
[837.759s] so they weren&#39;t getting economies scale
[839.92s] 10% of the stores he&#39;s expanding in
[842.72s] those regions where they&#39;re number one
[844.48s] or number two consolidating the
[846.399s] distribution centers they are targeting
[848.8s] $630 million of operating income by 2027
[852.88s] the last two times they they traded at
[855.36s] that level of operating income it was
[857.0s] $180 to $220 stock it&#39;s trading at $45
[860.399s] today so this thing can really grow over
[862.44s] the next couple years under the right
[863.759s] leadership I want to talk about small
[865.279s] caps as well we&#39;ve seen optimism return
[868.279s] certainly with c
[870.079s] following the election small caps have
[872.36s] lagged behind those Magnificent Seven
[874.199s] stocks as well we talk about growth we
[876.44s] talk about value how does small caps fit
[878.24s] in well I think small caps is where
[880.199s] you&#39;re seeing the most value one of the
[881.72s] names that we love is a company called
[883.639s] Cooper standard again two Auto
[885.72s] turnarounds for you you know people are
[887.72s] are sleeping they listening to this but
[889.519s] this is where the opportunity is going
[890.639s] to be in 2025 2026 uh this company&#39;s
[893.639s] down 90% it had a refinancing risk they
[896.32s] got it refinanced in 2022 they do the
[898.6s] ceiling systems around the doors boring
[900.639s] stuff fluid transfer systems the
[902.639s] operating leverage in this business is
[904.279s] huge uh all this is is a is a play on
[907.6s] volumes increasing we did 16.8 million
[910.839s] annualized SAR in December if you
[912.48s] remember those Auto numbers surprised
[914.079s] everyone the volumes are coming back up
[916.519s] the last time they did1 17 million the
[918.519s] business earned $7 of $140 stock Stock&#39;s
[921.44s] trading at
[922.44s] $14 uh they&#39;ve taken $400 million of of
[926.24s] uh uh cost out of the business so this
[928.44s] thing we leave over the next two years
[930.199s] could earn $7 to $10 a share which means
[932.68s] you know you apply 10 times multiple
[934.279s] it&#39;s it&#39;s really going to move all right
[935.92s] Thomas Hayes in from the West Coast
[938.279s] Thomas always a pleasure he&#39;s a chair
[939.92s] and managing member at Great Hill
[941.279s] capital thank you thanks for having
[943.759s] me and we&#39;re back and from the NYSC
[946.959s] obviously want to thank Kristen Scher
[948.399s] want to thank Melissa Montanez and Jeff
[953.36s] Cohen for having me on uh there and then
[957.36s] finally I had to privilege to join Mike
[960.759s] lson on the money show with Mish and M
[965.44s] Schneider and from market gug and Chris
[968.44s] Preston on cabit network you can go to
[971.199s] the website and uh listen to the entire
[973.959s] thing but we&#39;ve abbreviated it here just
[976.759s] to go through some of the picks and also
[978.6s] the framework that turnaround Tom that&#39;s
[981.399s] my nickname uses to find turnarounds I
[984.68s] think you&#39;ll find this extremely
[986.199s] beneficial uh thanks again to uh Mike uh
[989.519s] obviously Kim Kim gitler over there who
[992.279s] uh owns the whole thing at the money
[994.319s] show legendary for decade plus business
[997.199s] of uh prominent speakers throughout the
[999.12s] years financial markets absolutely
[1001.16s] incredible organization so here we go do
[1003.6s] you think it&#39;s important to to ask
[1005.12s] something right off the bat and that&#39;s
[1006.759s] you know is this finally going to be the
[1008.199s] stock Pickers Market we keep talking
[1009.839s] about you know we&#39;ve had this just buy
[1011.48s] big Tech and you&#39;re fine otherwise uh
[1014.12s] Tom why don&#39;t you start with that and
[1015.24s] let me know if that is the case why or
[1016.72s] why not yeah I think that&#39;s a great
[1019.079s] question that&#39;s a million dollar
[1020.319s] question for this year Mike thanks for
[1022.04s] having me uh I think what we&#39;re seeing
[1024.36s] though if we&#39;re realistic and objective
[1026.52s] about what&#39;s going on in the market uh
[1029.199s] what we are seeing is a deceleration in
[1033.0s] earnings growth for the Magnificent 7
[1035.28s] which kind of has driven the bus looking
[1038.16s] backwards uh earnings growth dropping
[1041.12s] from 33% last year to 21% this year
[1046.0s] however the multiple on the magnif
[1048.24s] Magnificent 7 has not yet
[1051.0s] derated uh in accordance with the
[1053.44s] earnings growth deceleration so I think
[1056.36s] they&#39;re going to perform less well
[1058.2s] they&#39;ll do okay this year but if you
[1060.88s] contrast that to kind of the broadening
[1063.24s] theme and take a look at the other end
[1065.16s] of the spectrum going from large cap
[1067.24s] growth to maybe small cap value uh you
[1069.919s] look at earnings growth
[1072.32s] acceleration uh in the small cap 600
[1075.52s] earnings growth is growing from 8% last
[1078.159s] year to
[1079.52s] 21% this year the difference is for that
[1082.88s] same 21% earnings growth whether you
[1085.559s] talk about mag 7 or you talk about small
[1088.039s] caps uh is the price you pay and on mag
[1090.88s] 7 you&#39;re still paying 33 times earnings
[1093.76s] for 21% earnings growth on small cap
[1096.039s] you&#39;re paying 15 or 16 times earnings
[1098.799s] for the same 21% earnings growth so I
[1101.84s] think that this is in fact going to be
[1104.72s] the year of the stock picker you can
[1106.84s] look under the surface the idea of
[1108.799s] setting on autopilot and letting the IND
[1111.6s] indices take you to Paradise uh is
[1114.559s] probably going to be a little less well
[1117.08s] founded in 2025 than it was in
[1120.679s] 2024 Tom I know from previous
[1122.72s] conversations you kind of had that that
[1123.88s] nickname turnaround Tom so I know that
[1125.76s] value is where you like to be looking
[1127.72s] talk about your methodology I mean how
[1129.039s] do you separate a value opportunity from
[1131.76s] a value trap yeah I think that&#39;s that&#39;s
[1134.48s] a great thing to to point out and I
[1136.88s] agree with some of what Chris said we do
[1138.36s] like to see growth but but price is what
[1141.08s] you pay value is what you get so we do
[1143.0s] look for stocks that are down a lot in
[1144.52s] terms of price and then we try to
[1147.0s] distinguish whether value has been uh
[1151.08s] destructed on an equivalent basis and
[1153.159s] what we find across most of the durable
[1155.28s] businesses that we get involved in
[1157.44s] number one they&#39;ve been around for many
[1159.84s] many years they&#39;ve operated through many
[1161.64s] cycles they&#39;re going through a temporary
[1164.159s] impairment like they have through uh
[1166.4s] different Cycles whether they&#39;re
[1167.799s] cyclical business or they&#39;ve had
[1169.559s] different other headwinds in the past uh
[1172.039s] and the first thing that we do is we
[1174.039s] look for solvency risk so uh you know if
[1177.52s] the stock&#39;s down 50 or 60 or 70 or
[1181.039s] 80% uh the market is saying that there
[1185.28s] might be an existential crisis so the
[1187.12s] first thing that we say is are they
[1188.679s] going to make it through this cycle are
[1190.679s] they going to live another day so that
[1192.12s] comes down to balance sheet analysis
[1193.96s] looking at the debt looking at when the
[1195.84s] maturities come due and if I can get
[1197.96s] comfortable with then then the key is
[1200.0s] going to be leadership do they have a
[1201.64s] new jockey that has a track record of
[1203.88s] success that&#39;s a key factor and then
[1206.159s] finally is free cash flow do they have
[1207.84s] enough Runway to execute on the
[1209.88s] turnaround plan because obviously it&#39;s
[1211.6s] been mismanaged to some degree or the
[1213.52s] stock wouldn&#39;t be down 80% you know you
[1215.72s] but but these are durable businesses
[1217.799s] whether we&#39;re talking about you know
[1219.6s] Disney that was at one point down 60%
[1223.24s] Disney&#39;s not going anywhere Boeing 70%
[1226.48s] uh these are high quality durable
[1228.72s] businesses that fall fell on rough times
[1230.64s] but they&#39;re not going anywhere anytime
[1232.4s] soon so um uh now to distinguish between
[1236.0s] a value trap I think people get caught
[1239.36s] in that just because the price is down
[1241.64s] means it&#39;s cheap and that&#39;s not always
[1243.72s] necessarily the case often times a a
[1247.0s] stock that&#39;s down a lot deserves to be
[1248.52s] down a lot and may uh face an ex
[1251.64s] existential crisis so that&#39;s something
[1253.72s] that you need to be able to discern from
[1255.96s] experience and doing proper analysis and
[1257.919s] not just looking at price and
[1260.32s] two is uh doing Lazy asset analysis
[1264.88s] where you say well the the breakup Parts
[1267.76s] uh alone is worth more than the price
[1270.159s] that it&#39;s trading at but there&#39;s no
[1272.039s] Catalyst for a recovery of growth
[1274.08s] there&#39;s no turnaround story there&#39;s no
[1275.799s] new leadership and I think that&#39;s where
[1277.6s] people get stuck in quote unquote value
[1279.4s] traps and and by the way many of the
[1282.159s] greatest value traps are broken growth
[1285.159s] stocks okay that never ever recover
[1287.76s] people forget that as it relates to
[1289.84s] Value generally um what what I see in
[1294.12s] the market right now is people uh
[1297.039s] blinded by recency bias in that because
[1301.279s] since
[1302.76s] 2010 growth has outperform value
[1305.559s] therefore it&#39;s always going to P persist
[1307.72s] meaning what&#39;s happened in the recent
[1309.0s] past is going to persist and um if you
[1313.08s] look back to
[1314.84s] 1927 value has outperformed growth by 4
[1318.0s] and a half % per year per year including
[1322.159s] this aberrational uh zero interest rate
[1325.159s] policy environment and my my kind of
[1327.44s] view there is uh value and growth are
[1331.32s] tied at the HIP number one so it&#39;s it&#39;s
[1333.32s] not either or I don&#39;t buy something
[1334.88s] because it&#39;s a value stock or because
[1336.48s] it&#39;s a growth stock I buy because I&#39;m
[1338.679s] getting a lot of value for uh Less Price
[1342.279s] than than the Alternatives highest and
[1343.799s] best use of the capital uh and I think
[1346.96s] that unless you believe
[1349.76s] that we&#39;re going back to zero interest
[1352.52s] rate policy or close to it uh not having
[1357.039s] some element of value and or
[1359.6s] International which is also trading at
[1361.2s] low
[1362.0s] multiples uh and small caps Etc is is um
[1366.96s] maybe a little risky at the moment if
[1368.88s] you got all your eggs in one basket
[1370.32s] because I think we are in a period of
[1373.32s] regime change and and that&#39;s going to
[1375.08s] create a lot of opportunities a lot more
[1376.6s] opportunity in 493 stock then in seven
[1380.12s] got it Tom I gotta ask you about your
[1382.08s] first pick I mean it&#39;s one of those
[1383.159s] names that just can&#39;t stay out of the
[1384.6s] news and not in a good way so uh sell me
[1387.12s] on Boeing here yeah well Boeing is uh is
[1391.52s] what we call a legal duopoly uh between
[1394.799s] Airbus and Boeing they deliver 99% of
[1397.72s] the commercial aircraft uh as far as the
[1400.4s] recent crashes which have been terrible
[1403.0s] they&#39;re predominantly concentrated to
[1405.2s] the older planes you know the risk the
[1407.44s] fear was that it was run the 737 Max
[1409.76s] which has had a ton of problems but they
[1411.76s] got rid of the old CEO fortunately we&#39;ve
[1414.44s] got Kelly ortberg in who has an
[1416.84s] engineering background versus a sales
[1418.72s] background or financial engineering
[1420.52s] background and that&#39;s a good thing he&#39;s
[1422.52s] on the floor in Seattle he&#39;s fixing all
[1424.88s] of the problems he solved the uh the
[1428.0s] labor union strike and when he was at
[1430.799s] Rockwell Collins before he came here he
[1433.799s] created a lot of value for shareholders
[1435.679s] uh Rockwell Collins quadrupled in value
[1438.12s] for shareholders before it was sold in a
[1440.08s] period of six years he&#39;s a turnaround
[1442.32s] specialist uh they have a half a
[1444.36s] trillion doll backlog I mean imagine
[1447.0s] buying a business that had 10 years of
[1449.12s] demand that they couldn&#39;t possibly
[1452.2s] fulfill uh that they didn&#39;t have the
[1454.159s] capacity to fulfill all at once it&#39;s
[1456.44s] it&#39;s a great problem you got Airlines
[1458.48s] waiting and sure they can get angry and
[1460.64s] say you know the landing gear didn&#39;t
[1462.4s] come down right or the door had a
[1464.64s] problem Etc and they&#39;re working on
[1466.039s] fixing all of that but at the end of the
[1467.96s] day they can say fine I&#39;m taking all my
[1470.0s] business to Airbus and rather than wait
[1471.72s] 10 years they&#39;re going to wait 20 years
[1473.12s] for their planes so that&#39;s not an option
[1475.2s] what they have to do is work with Boeing
[1476.72s] and that&#39;s what you&#39;ve seen whether it&#39;s
[1478.44s] Southwest whether it&#39;s everything else
[1480.12s] and and the commonality across all the
[1482.44s] carriers is they have utmost confidence
[1484.559s] in Kelly ortberg&#39;s engineering PR safety
[1487.72s] uh excellence and turning the company
[1489.48s] around so with a stock down that&#39;s uh
[1492.08s] down that materially some you know 70
[1495.12s] something percent it fell maybe Peak to
[1497.2s] trough uh
[1498.88s] and uh you have a business that&#39;s going
[1500.72s] to get back to free cash flow positive
[1502.72s] they raised uh $20 billion of cash to
[1505.88s] take solvency risk off the table all the
[1508.679s] components that I look for turnaround
[1511.12s] Tom looks for in a turnaround situation
[1513.6s] are perfectly in place pricing power uh
[1516.2s] durable sustainable moat performs
[1518.44s] through Cycles uh pricing power uh it&#39;s
[1521.72s] all there you just have to be patient
[1523.559s] now you play the time Arbitrage game and
[1525.279s] most people can&#39;t wait two to three
[1527.12s] years for a double uh but we&#39;re patient
[1529.52s] we like to do that rinse repeat over and
[1531.32s] over and we think Boeing is going to be
[1532.84s] one of our next ones uh Tom I I want to
[1535.279s] get back to your last pick um you know
[1536.88s] my household may or may not have spent
[1538.88s] some time on the website this holiday
[1540.64s] season uh it&#39;s Etsy obviously a lot of
[1543.0s] people know what the company does what&#39;s
[1544.64s] your case there yeah this is another one
[1547.08s] of my favorites down 80% uh we like to
[1550.679s] buy things down quite a bit but what&#39;s
[1553.32s] very interesting is the price is down 80
[1555.279s] 80% but like I say price is what you pay
[1557.52s] value is what you get
[1559.279s] uh they certainly their growth rate
[1562.0s] decelerated postco they had a huge surge
[1564.72s] in covid uh they are the fourth most
[1568.159s] trafficked e-commerce site in the US
[1571.2s] behind uh obviously Amazon Walmart and
[1575.2s] eBay 92 million users but what&#39;s
[1578.2s] beautiful about their business is it&#39;s a
[1580.279s] niche product handmade customized named
[1584.32s] uh products so it&#39;s not a race to the
[1586.08s] bottom in me too products where you&#39;re
[1587.84s] just competing on price which they
[1589.399s] couldn&#39;t compete against Amazon and
[1591.72s] Amazon had tried to compete with them
[1593.679s] years ago and realized they couldn&#39;t and
[1595.24s] got out of the business so uh and then
[1597.64s] you got a winner like Josh Silverman who
[1599.679s] was successful at eBay with shopping.com
[1601.96s] uh founded Evite sold that to Barry
[1605.32s] Diller over at IAC interactive and then
[1608.36s] when he was at Skype he grew 300 million
[1611.279s] users so um you know you have a
[1614.64s] situation where they made a couple they
[1616.64s] had the huge growth they&#39;ve been able to
[1619.039s] keep that level of free cash flow keep
[1621.799s] the level of peak level of covid
[1624.2s] revenues and it&#39;s now trading at about a
[1626.72s] nine times free cash flow so they got so
[1630.039s] much cash gushing in healthy balance
[1632.64s] sheet a turnaround in plan they&#39;ve got
[1634.72s] this gift mode they&#39;ve better curated
[1636.72s] the website they&#39;re growing
[1637.96s] internationally they&#39;re focused on men
[1639.919s] they&#39;ve got all these initiatives in
[1641.36s] place that are getting traction but at
[1643.48s] the same time they&#39;re buying in all the
[1645.64s] float so uh they just announced a b doll
[1648.72s] buyback they bought in about 9% of the
[1651.399s] shares in
[1652.64s] 2024 so effectively just from the free
[1655.2s] cash flow they could buy in the whole
[1656.64s] entire company in about you know nine
[1659.279s] nine years and uh and and that alone if
[1662.919s] they didn&#39;t grow but it does look like
[1664.64s] growth is re accelerating and this is
[1666.679s] the perfect uh combination of
[1669.159s] characteristics that we look for in
[1670.799s] turnaround situations so we think this
[1672.32s] is going to be a great one over the next
[1673.559s] couple of years perfect and we&#39;re back
[1677.72s] so there &#39;s not a whole lot more I need
[1679.64s] to say about the markets and by the way
[1681.2s] two of our picks were in here a shout
[1683.44s] out to Jeff Adams who wrote up our uh
[1686.76s] Boeing and Etsy uh from our from our
[1690.279s] previous podcast and articles was able
[1692.88s] to consolidate that you can download the
[1694.76s] whole report there are something like 78
[1697.679s] picks from 44 different writers in that
[1700.64s] money show for
[1702.36s] 20125 think you&#39;ll find that valuable at
[1704.559s] hedge fund tips.com while you&#39;re there
[1707.12s] click on terms this is all opinion not
[1710.44s] advice talk to your financial adviser
[1712.32s] before you do anything we deal
[1714.08s] exclusively with accredited investors
[1715.919s] qualified institutions and the like uh
[1719.2s] want to thank Johan cherion sucti Gupta
[1724.6s] and karolina Mandel for including me in
[1727.32s] their article on Reuters this week and
[1731.48s] on to our quotes of the week this is uh
[1734.519s] there&#39;s never been a more appropriate
[1735.96s] time to talk about this from ran one of
[1738.84s] my mentors in the 20s he also mentored
[1740.799s] Tony Robbins by the way in his 20s Jim
[1743.679s] was around for a long time unfortunately
[1745.32s] passed away a handful of years ago and
[1747.6s] his quote was everyone must choose one
[1750.159s] of two pains the pain of discipline or
[1753.519s] the pain of regret and uh you can&#39;t have
[1757.0s] it both ways and I think in an
[1758.799s] environment where you&#39;re seeing a little
[1760.36s] bit of Crazy Town stuff um happening and
[1764.519s] for some of you that were given the fomo
[1767.32s] gene got passed me over when he handed
[1769.36s] out fomo jeans thank God uh
[1772.08s] literally um and you&#39;re seeing things
[1775.12s] that make no sense from evaluation
[1776.799s] standpoint you got to stick to your
[1778.519s] discipline during periods like this
[1780.399s] because sooner or later the chickens
[1781.96s] come home to roost and you don&#39;t want to
[1783.76s] be caught holding the bag and uh and
[1786.44s] that&#39;s the discipline you know whether
[1787.76s] it&#39;s doing your push-ups every morning
[1790.0s] or uh not chasing the shiny objects when
[1792.6s] they make no sense uh these disciplines
[1795.88s] over time compound into really a
[1799.399s] pleasurable outcomes for sure Charlie
[1801.519s] Munger quote our job is to find a few
[1804.44s] intelligent things to do not to keep up
[1807.039s] with every damn thing in the
[1808.88s] world no one could say it better than
[1811.159s] Charlie Munger I want to talk a little
[1813.44s] bit about earnings growth uh for 2025
[1817.6s] this has been a theme you heard it in a
[1819.32s] couple of the interviews particularly I
[1821.84s] think with Taylor rigs how healthc care
[1825.039s] had uh the worst performance Healthcare
[1827.24s] materials had very low performance in
[1829.08s] 2024 we expected to have uh a great
[1832.24s] performance in 2025 and you can get a
[1835.0s] sense of why they had you know di
[1838.039s] Minimus performance is because they had
[1839.72s] di Minimus earnings growth so in 2024
[1842.799s] Healthcare grew earnings
[1845.0s] 4.1% uh that was you know more than half
[1849.48s] less less than half of what the S&amp;P grew
[1853.24s] 99.5% and then materials grew negative
[1856.679s] 99.5% so so it makes some sense even
[1860.88s] Industrials didn&#39;t grow that much uh it
[1863.6s] makes some sense that these were the
[1865.159s] laggards and what grew uh Tech certainly
[1868.2s] had
[1869.639s] um um big growth 177% we sold off our uh
[1875.44s] our um uh Google and Amazon that we
[1879.039s] bought in Fall of 2022 during the summer
[1881.48s] they didn&#39;t do a whole lot more after
[1883.159s] that by the way it was effectively dead
[1884.72s] money uh after that they they&#39;ve started
[1886.96s] to move up a little bit and com services
[1889.2s] so they had the best earnings growth and
[1891.279s] they had the best performance however if
[1894.559s] you look into
[1896.679s] 2025 two of the top four expected
[1900.24s] earnings growth are healthc Care at 20.5
[1902.76s] and materials at 17.0 so that&#39;s where
[1904.84s] there&#39;s opportunities we uh Express the
[1907.48s] materials we talked about through albam
[1909.279s] Maro we express the healthc care through
[1911.519s] xbi biotech if you recall uh during
[1914.559s] Trump when he got elected uh biotech and
[1917.2s] Healthcare so off in those two months
[1919.12s] because he was going to rip up the
[1920.279s] Affordable Car Act they rallied bigly uh
[1923.72s] as he would say 75% for biotech in the
[1926.32s] next year after the inauguration so
[1928.679s] that&#39;s how we&#39;re expressing that we also
[1930.12s] have Baxter which we&#39;re excited about uh
[1932.679s] Tech is also going to grow the key is
[1935.039s] how much is already priced in which we
[1936.639s] talked about in some of the interviews
[1938.76s] so we&#39;re not going to repeat that so uh
[1941.2s] Industrials is going to grow 18.8% we
[1943.76s] got exposure to that through the Stanley
[1945.76s] Black and&amp; Deckers of the world through
[1947.519s] the anax through the
[1950.12s] um uh you know Cooper standard in in in
[1952.919s] a certain way uh Etc so so we&#39;ve got all
[1956.12s] that energy is going to grow a little
[1957.48s] bit but not much we&#39;re still looking for
[1959.0s] some opportunity there um consumer
[1962.2s] discretionary which we talked about
[1963.919s] months ago when no one wanted it they&#39;ve
[1965.679s] outperformed so lots priced in there but
[1968.279s] this is where you&#39;re going to find the
[1970.519s] uh the real opportunity and the ones
[1972.039s] that were left behind that are now going
[1973.44s] to have the earnings growth so these
[1975.039s] things are not Mysteries this is why
[1978.32s] they outperform and why we get
[1980.72s] positioned for them but just as a
[1983.039s] friendly Public Service Announcement
[1985.24s] which we&#39;ve been talking about for many
[1987.0s] podcasts now is not to get faked out
[1990.639s] right now because crazy town is
[1992.679s] happening uh Gulf of America we&#39;re GNA
[1996.76s] Co-op the Panama Canal uh Canada is
[1999.679s] going to be the 51st state and Wayne
[2002.559s] Gretzky is going to be the governor not
[2004.96s] a bad idea by the way uh and uh what
[2008.039s] else are we going to do Greenland so you
[2010.039s] know this is silly stuff on on a
[2012.919s] headline by headline basis some of its
[2015.639s] diversions there&#39;s a semblance of Truth
[2017.679s] to some of it that makes sense of course
[2020.159s] uh how much of it will get done remains
[2021.96s] to be seen but this is the same time a
[2024.639s] type of Crazy Town speculation that you
[2026.519s] saw after Trump got elected in Trump one
[2030.12s] uh that as tariff man Baba sold off from
[2033.32s] 107 down to 84 by the way it&#39;s kind of
[2035.799s] interesting that Baba has done
[2038.08s] effectively the exact same thing since
[2040.6s] he got elected uh down to the low 80s
[2043.72s] and then it uh uh over the next 12
[2046.48s] months less than 12 months it went from
[2048.839s] 84 to 187 after the election so uh it
[2052.839s] doesn&#39;t have to repeat and this is uh
[2055.119s] certainly you know not it&#39;s just to tell
[2059.119s] you that during those weird periods of
[2062.0s] uncertainty same with
[2063.639s] kweb um same with uh same with a lot of
[2067.28s] these healthc care biotech sold off big
[2070.599s] right after he got elected rallied the
[2072.76s] next year uh and so on and so forth
[2075.76s] energy did poorly but uh I&#39;m keeping an
[2078.159s] open mind on energy if something really
[2079.96s] comes a fat pitch down the middle it&#39;s
[2081.679s] just there&#39;s not enough upside for me to
[2084.159s] take the risk right now relative to some
[2086.2s] of the other opportunities in the
[2087.879s] portfolio and that uh we were able to
[2089.679s] allocate to so
[2092.879s] um so this is this is just normal stuff
[2096.72s] Staples sold off a lot there you know
[2098.88s] I&#39;m seeing some Staples I&#39;ve got my eye
[2100.599s] on the Hershey&#39;s I&#39;ve got my eye on the
[2102.16s] cokes I&#39;ve got my eye on uh a lot of
[2104.96s] these companies that have sold off that
[2107.599s] may be opportunities after the you know
[2110.2s] getting positioned ahead of the election
[2111.64s] but we we&#39;ve got that exposure that will
[2113.44s] benefit from healthc care we was going
[2115.48s] to rip up the Affordable Care Act
[2117.24s] afterwards uh huge huge run over 50% the
[2120.52s] next 12 months uh and so on and so forth
[2124.4s] so everything they thought would do well
[2125.92s] did poorly like energy everything I
[2127.88s] thought would do poorly did well so keep
[2131.88s] an open mind for the next few weeks
[2134.68s] don&#39;t do anything stupid uh if you&#39;ve
[2137.28s] got cash to put to work now is the time
[2140.2s] if you&#39;re picking wisely uh the
[2143.68s] opportunity window that was created by a
[2145.92s] once in a 100 Year event the
[2148.2s] generational opportunity the window is
[2150.04s] closing now we are set for takeoff and
[2153.72s] uh many of you have strapped on board
[2155.24s] and by the way congratulations to
[2156.359s] everyone that came this week some some
[2157.72s] of you are already approved funded and
[2159.48s] we&#39;ve been able to deploy in the last
[2161.48s] couple of days so super excited for you
[2164.24s] super excited for all the clients that
[2165.76s] are with me positioned in the same way
[2167.48s] for a rocket ship I you know I think
[2169.839s] this is going to be the most exciting
[2171.2s] year uh not for indices but for what we
[2174.16s] do and we&#39;re going to see some charts
[2177.24s] and correlations that kind of bear that
[2179.56s] out so let&#39;s go
[2181.68s] to our some of our charts here uh this
[2185.56s] is from Chris verone R to be December to
[2187.4s] be lower 20% of the time but it&#39;s
[2189.76s] January that has the more important role
[2191.28s] in setting the market tone for the next
[2192.76s] 6
[2193.64s] months uh when January is positive the
[2198.52s] average 6mon forward S&amp;P performance is
[2203.16s] 6.9% so that&#39;s kind of a big deal as far
[2206.319s] as when December is negative it has less
[2209.079s] of an
[2210.119s] impact uh moving forward so so we&#39;ll
[2213.28s] keep an eye on January bod well this is
[2216.359s] from my super golf buddy Cavin P you
[2220.16s] know who you are uh um played in a bunch
[2224.359s] of tournaments together and look forward
[2226.359s] to seeing him when I&#39;m on the East Coast
[2228.28s] this summer get up get back up to the
[2229.92s] club and knock it around but uh uh what
[2233.28s] he sent me was this chart of uh wanted
[2238.4s] to highlight the report for a beautiful
[2240.4s] updated version of one of alphaville&#39;s
[2242.319s] favorite uh ever chart formats implied
[2245.44s] rate forecast over time and what rates
[2248.8s] have actually done so what you can see
[2251.56s] here is Bank estimates of what rates
[2254.8s] would do uh nearly every single time uh
[2261.0s] uh cide was too pessimistic meaning they
[2264.88s] thought rates would stay much higher
[2267.96s] than they actually did you can see all
[2270.119s] these estimates and then what actually
[2271.68s] happened rates came down dramatically
[2273.599s] all these estimates that rates would be
[2275.24s] higher they stayed low higher low higher
[2278.24s] low Stay Stay higher low stay higher
[2281.92s] lower so uh you know we&#39;re kind of in
[2285.76s] the we&#39;re still in the camp that was
[2288.96s] a unconventional view last year that
[2292.44s] rates would probably they&#39;d probably
[2294.48s] stopped cutting around three and a half
[2296.56s] to
[2297.76s] 4% uh on the FED funds rate but now
[2302.24s] that&#39;s becoming more consensus so we&#39;ll
[2304.0s] see what happens but I think this was a
[2305.48s] really useful exercise that uh
[2308.48s] um don&#39;t be surprised if rates go lower
[2312.0s] than you think and bonds get bit higher
[2314.28s] and no one right now no one because
[2316.68s] you&#39;re getting the exact same fake out
[2319.2s] that we&#39;ve covered the last three weeks
[2321.76s] uh in the dollar rally and yields
[2326.119s] rallying after the Trump election like
[2328.839s] in 2016 and then after the inauguration
[2331.96s] what happened dollar rolled over
[2334.319s] weakened for the next year bonds got bid
[2337.2s] Yi compressed there are zero people
[2340.56s] talking like that right now everyone
[2342.319s] thinks it&#39;s the end of the world and I
[2344.4s] think what you&#39;re going to find is the
[2345.76s] opposite is true moving along this is
[2348.88s] bespoke S&amp;P 500 2.6% decline was the
[2352.839s] worst end to a year since 1952 you know
[2355.4s] you had Industrials down 10% in December
[2359.8s] I mean you had this beautiful broadening
[2362.079s] from January from July through December
[2365.68s] uh then December you know after the
[2367.4s] election and with the FED stuff it just
[2369.48s] you know unraveled a acute Interruption
[2373.319s] it will resume it&#39;s just going to be
[2375.52s] after the after the inauguration and
[2377.88s] things settle down
[2380.079s] um yeah worst than to a year since 1952
[2383.44s] that&#39;s pretty mindboggling another
[2385.359s] bullish sign in energy let&#39;s see small
[2388.16s] speculators are short natural gas for
[2389.76s] the first time since uh 2001 just as
[2393.24s] natural gas was breaking out this is
[2396.24s] super exciting ladies and Gentlemen We
[2398.0s] love comto some guy emailed me or dm&#39;d
[2403.24s] me on LinkedIn if you have an AMA
[2405.04s] question send it in at hedge fund
[2406.56s] tips.com please don&#39;t DM me unless
[2408.4s] you&#39;re a client you can call my cell
[2409.96s] phone if you&#39;re a client but
[2412.76s] um uh put it in on the uh on the website
[2416.28s] if uh if you want me to answer it but
[2418.599s] I&#39;m going to address it because he said
[2421.599s] you know is comto too late to get in you
[2423.88s] know we were pounding the table on
[2425.28s] Comstock at $78 $9 on this podcast now I
[2429.119s] think it got up to like19 or $20 and he
[2432.079s] says is it too late I think we&#39;re just
[2434.119s] getting started in in the cycle now uh
[2437.16s] you know it&#39;s up over 100% in a short
[2439.48s] period of time
[2441.04s] so but I think if you step back and
[2443.48s] we&#39;ve talked about proved and unproved
[2445.119s] reserves as it relates to that it&#39;s
[2446.44s] nowhere near its liquidation value you
[2449.4s] you saw what it did in 2000 same type of
[2451.88s] situation this thing can run for a long
[2454.24s] long time uh would I be a buyer at at
[2458.28s] you know $19 after it&#39;s rallied from 7
[2462.64s] in like a few you know in a very short
[2464.72s] period of time since we&#39;ve been talking
[2467.119s] uh I&#39;d probably wait for a little bit of
[2468.68s] a pullback maybe back to 15 or 16 but
[2470.52s] you may never get it and uh you know I
[2473.4s] will start to evaluate where we are
[2476.28s] versus intrinsic value uh much higher
[2478.8s] than now but you know if I tell you to
[2480.48s] get in at $20 when I was telling you
[2483.119s] that you know about it at
[2484.839s] 789 and then it pulls back to 15
[2488.359s] you know most people flip out because
[2490.04s] they don&#39;t know what they own um it
[2492.599s] doesn&#39;t really matter but if I was late
[2495.28s] to the party I&#39;d probably wait for a
[2496.92s] pullback and if it went to you know 50
[2499.24s] 60 70 without me I&#39;d be perfectly happy
[2501.64s] with that I could care less so there are
[2503.72s] plenty of opportunities so that&#39;s not
[2505.68s] the only one but it&#39;s interesting in
[2507.68s] terms of sentiment how people you know
[2510.599s] no one&#39;s interested at 789 except for
[2513.28s] the clients who give me money because
[2514.88s] they see the opportunities and they
[2517.24s] they&#39;re like let&#39;s go you know and uh
[2519.8s] you attract what you are bottom line if
[2521.72s] you&#39;re a winner you attract winners
[2523.119s] that&#39;s how it works and um and that&#39;s
[2526.04s] what I have with my clients they just
[2527.56s] unbelievable group of people that are
[2529.839s] just crushing it in the real world and
[2532.599s] um and and I&#39;m just uh honored to be a
[2534.88s] partner with them and uh and grow this
[2537.24s] over time so um so that&#39;s natural gas
[2541.28s] this is an amazing chart okay so this is
[2543.64s] all the idiots that are shorten the hole
[2545.44s] they&#39;re going to get their
[2548.04s] you know what&#39;s reamed uh and what what
[2550.92s] are we back to if those of you been with
[2552.839s] me for two months 2001 baby this is this
[2555.68s] is so many similarities it&#39;s so exciting
[2560.079s] because from 2001 to 2007 Emerging
[2564.0s] Markets China value outperform growth SM
[2567.0s] small outperform large you can&#39;t sell
[2569.359s] that narrative anywhere anytime any
[2571.48s] place and you won&#39;t be able to until 3 4
[2573.48s] 5 years from now after it&#39;s up triple
[2575.319s] and you get like the guy dming you after
[2577.359s] the thing&#39;s up over 100 150% is it too
[2580.319s] late um and then the beauty of those
[2582.839s] people is that it pulls back the minute
[2585.76s] they get in after 100% move it pulls
[2587.8s] back 25% the people that are in from you
[2590.64s] know 100% ago they don&#39;t care uh they
[2593.24s] just wait it out and then they get
[2594.599s] another double whereas the guy who got
[2596.16s] in late sells sells down 25% and misses
[2599.319s] it again then buys up again and the same
[2601.48s] thing&#39;s going to happen with Baba I I
[2603.16s] just I I almost can&#39;t wait for I I can&#39;t
[2605.68s] wait for Baba I I just want want to see
[2607.88s] all these people chase up at 200 and um
[2611.64s] and that&#39;s the story but corporate net
[2613.76s] interest payments near record lows so
[2616.8s] that is not what you see at recession
[2619.8s] time uh January is historically a strong
[2623.44s] month for the market so we&#39;ll see if we
[2625.319s] get some follow through
[2627.52s] here S&amp;P annual performance 1953 to 2024
[2632.16s] so you can
[2633.8s] see uh it wouldn&#39;t be abnormal to get a
[2636.16s] bunch of good sticks together like you
[2637.8s] got in the late &#39;90s but we should be
[2639.68s] open-minded for more subdued returns
[2641.64s] this year uh on the indices I think on
[2644.839s] you know there was so much money made in
[2646.72s] 2000 in 2001 and 2002 when when
[2652.72s] uh when people were losing 90% of their
[2655.44s] money in amazon.com by the way it&#39;s not
[2658.52s] because Amazon was a bad business the
[2660.079s] fundamentals were still improving it&#39;s
[2661.52s] just they paid too much money for what
[2664.359s] would ultimately take place 10 years
[2666.4s] down the road
[2667.92s] um you know people think that if you&#39;re
[2670.24s] cautious on a stock you&#39;re you&#39;re
[2673.44s] negative on the narrative and that has
[2677.16s] nothing to do with it it&#39;s price is what
[2679.04s] you pay value is what you get and um I
[2683.0s] think all of these things that are you
[2685.28s] know happening now with AI and Robotics
[2689.28s] and automated driving are going to
[2691.2s] change the world they&#39;re just not going
[2692.8s] to do it tomorrow and uh and these
[2695.04s] things are pricing like they&#39;ve been
[2696.48s] doing it already for 10 years uh and
[2699.839s] that&#39;s why you get the first wash out of
[2703.16s] a cycle and uh and then you buy it we&#39;ll
[2706.119s] be buying it when they&#39;re quote unquote
[2707.64s] value stocks when what they&#39;re promising
[2709.72s] now actually starts to happen the stocks
[2712.0s] will be down when it&#39;s actually
[2713.76s] happening in reality those stocks will
[2715.24s] be down 80% we&#39;ll be buying them hand
[2717.2s] over fist and that&#39;s where you get the
[2718.76s] real run like you got in Amazon in the
[2721.16s] you know post great financial
[2724.119s] crisis took a long time for that stock
[2726.44s] to recover
[2728.16s] uh ex growth is leading value by nine
[2731.599s] percentage points so what you can see
[2734.24s] here is that what I talked about with
[2739.04s] Kristen and others is
[2742.319s] that this is an aberration right here
[2745.72s] this outperformance and growth versus
[2747.119s] value this happened in the Zer zero
[2749.079s] interest rate policy environment uh if
[2751.76s] you believe rates are going back to zero
[2753.24s] then fine you should bet on this H
[2755.079s] persisting but data going back to 1927
[2759.119s] value outperforms growth by 45% per year
[2761.92s] that&#39;s where fortunes are made and by
[2763.52s] the way going back to 2021 remember when
[2765.839s] you had the concentration of all that
[2767.24s] Tech well for the next seven years value
[2770.079s] outperformed growth by about 100% if you
[2772.48s] add up all these numbers so um take the
[2775.44s] other side I mean maybe it takes five
[2777.44s] more years for that flip to happen
[2779.2s] that&#39;s that&#39;s certainly possible but not
[2782.079s] probable based on uh how far the rubber
[2784.119s] band is stretched four-year presidential
[2786.92s] election cycle weekly sweet spot so you
[2789.599s] have post elction here a little
[2791.839s] bumpiness the first half and then it
[2793.92s] drives higher uh
[2797.359s] interestingly here so you can see the
[2799.44s] different indices and so on four-year
[2801.359s] presidential cycle midterm year week and
[2804.28s] sweet spot so post election little
[2806.28s] weakness q1 strong
[2808.359s] Q2 uh and so on and so forth and then
[2812.96s] um the midterm next year should be a lot
[2815.88s] more challenging uh and I I would almost
[2820.24s] think yeah we&#39;ll we&#39;ll take it as it
[2822.559s] comes but uh I&#39;m I&#39;m way more C cautious
[2825.839s] about next year
[2827.52s] but wouldn&#39;t surprise me if we extend
[2830.4s] because this bull market is so young um
[2833.64s] and we had the recession in 2020 and
[2836.2s] 2022 already that we get some push
[2839.28s] forward because you usually get one
[2840.599s] every 4.1 years so we got two in two
[2844.04s] years which gives us like six years of
[2846.559s] run
[2847.88s] way um and we&#39;re two years in so I I
[2851.88s] would you know let&#39;s let&#39;s see how
[2853.92s] things play out there are a lot of
[2854.96s] variables here I mean if we if we if we
[2858.119s] if we ship tanks into Greenland we might
[2861.079s] have to re-evaluate Chinese assets
[2863.72s] aren&#39;t off to a good start what that
[2865.48s] says about economic stimul oh this why
[2867.8s] did I post this because our friend is
[2869.92s] back she must have been on vacation uh
[2872.2s] in India or something because she&#39;s back
[2874.119s] to bash China and uh uh without fail
[2877.76s] here she goes uh us private construction
[2881.319s] spending starting to turn up uh
[2884.8s] percentage of S&amp;P 500 members above
[2887.16s] their 200 day moving averages so this is
[2889.04s] where you want to be buyers not sellers
[2891.72s] uh just looking at the odds above the
[2894.319s] 20-day moving average again the nysse
[2896.599s] stocks above the 20-day moving average
[2898.44s] so this is you know this is where you
[2900.0s] see saw the October 2000 lows the fall
[2902.839s] 2022 lows where we were pounding the
[2905.079s] hell and then March 2020 3 and by the
[2907.8s] way we picked up a ton of smart people
[2910.48s] back then both in October 2022 and in
[2913.44s] March of
[2914.359s] 2023 sending in money when the market
[2916.92s] was in turmoil because they were
[2918.359s] listeners to the podcast I said now now
[2920.28s] now just like I&#39;m saying now now now
[2922.079s] before the before the inauguration let&#39;s
[2924.28s] go let&#39;s go these things are priced for
[2926.079s] death this is this 100-year window is
[2928.88s] closing and it&#39;s closing fast uh and
[2931.64s] there will always be opportunities but
[2933.52s] you&#39;re only going to have a once in a
[2934.76s] 100 Year event every hundred years and
[2937.799s] we are getting the re we are getting the
[2939.839s] residual benefits of how things
[2942.079s] positioned responding to that and
[2943.839s] recovering from that that now it&#39;s into
[2946.28s] money-making mode Roaring 20s of the
[2948.319s] recovery of all these things that got
[2949.72s] smattered dstock to restock cycle
[2953.48s] Etc uh active managers selling in the
[2956.04s] selling down of course as they always do
[2959.119s] here&#39;s earnings estimates solid returns
[2960.92s] are normal after a 20% gain this is from
[2963.28s] Ryan Dietrich at
[2965.16s] Carson average uh after 20 20% gain the
[2969.2s] average return is
[2972.079s] 10.6% that is going back to 1950 so I
[2975.76s] would I think that&#39;s a reasonable
[2977.2s] expectation I&#39;ve been saying 8 to 12 I
[2979.0s] like that 10.6 makes a whole lot of
[2981.599s] sense I mean Automotive Sales thanks my
[2985.4s] buddy Allen this this is
[2988.359s] uh um 16.8% annual 16.8 million
[2992.96s] annualized S I mean obviously you had
[2995.16s] some pull forward with the Florida
[2997.24s] and the EV tax credits fear wind down
[3000.24s] but at the end if we got anything close
[3002.2s] to 68 I mean it would just be un the
[3004.52s] thing would at 168 if you got not an
[3008.2s] annualized but an annual 16.8 which I
[3011.04s] think we&#39;re going to get in the next
[3012.079s] couple of years uh Cooper earns over 10
[3015.04s] bucks a share because of the $400 $500
[3016.88s] million of cost they pulled out of it
[3018.68s] they earn when they were earning seven
[3020.079s] bucks at the last cycle Peak when we
[3022.319s] were doing 17.1 million SAR $146 stock
[3026.24s] 13 or $14 stock now uh as we&#39;re ramping
[3030.64s] up cash flow positive so why are they
[3033.839s] just what&#39;s the overhang the overhang is
[3036.16s] twofold rates are spiking up after the
[3038.799s] election which they did in 2016 to 2017
[3041.799s] after the inauguration rates will go
[3043.359s] back down that will alleviate fears
[3045.24s] about uh refinancing although they don&#39;t
[3047.04s] have any maturities coming due
[3048.28s] imminently but we want to get them
[3050.839s] refinanced anyway that&#39;ll save
[3052.4s] additional interest costs which I think
[3054.0s] they&#39;ll be able to do in the first or
[3055.359s] second quarter while credit spread
[3056.64s] spreads are at record lows um and then
[3060.52s] it also helps financing on the cars
[3062.68s] particularly short rates which is which
[3064.319s] is also a positive things which helps
[3066.48s] volumes doesn&#39;t help margins for the
[3068.24s] oems but helps volumes which is all we
[3070.4s] care about because we make uh the
[3072.319s] certain amount per car and we make more
[3074.319s] on hybrids and EES than we do on IC so
[3076.559s] is that Trend hybrids are crushing it we
[3078.92s] love it that&#39;s more margin than we have
[3080.72s] in our models so we&#39;re excited ISM
[3083.16s] Manufacturing PMI turning up uh new
[3086.2s] orders turning up that&#39;s good uh and
[3091.079s] then here we go cyclicals over
[3093.839s] defensives ISM Manufacturing Pi this is
[3096.16s] going to be a catch-up play this is
[3097.68s] going to help Industrials and everything
[3100.28s] else here is the number they expected
[3102.799s] 16.5 annualized they got 168 this is
[3107.88s] just super exciting news super exciting
[3111.48s] news and super exciting news because
[3113.599s] I&#39;ve been able to put a lot of new money
[3115.079s] into it in the 13 which I never thought
[3117.72s] I would ever be able to do with 16.8
[3120.04s] annualized so I am super pumped uh and
[3123.76s] uh and super hopefully it&#39;s going to
[3126.04s] stay down until after the inauguration
[3127.92s] because people have these fake fears
[3129.4s] about tariffs they&#39;ll have some real
[3131.16s] tariffs but they they&#39;re always
[3132.4s] workarounds and things that can be done
[3134.04s] and passrs and everything else but um I
[3137.96s] pray that it stays down for another
[3139.64s] couple weeks so we can get everyone as
[3142.119s] much of this as humanly possible at a
[3144.839s] reasonable price uh hybrids time to
[3147.559s] shine so you can see here this just
[3150.24s] means more margin than expected so
[3153.64s] instead of earning $10 a share they
[3155.28s] could earn $12 per share potentially on
[3157.72s] 17 to 17.5 million which is the cycle
[3160.76s] Peak every cycle since
[3162.68s] 19 going 45 50 years back uh it troughs
[3166.64s] in the 15s it peaks in the 17s and uh
[3169.88s] the operating leverage of these
[3171.079s] businesses is
[3172.76s] unbelievable uh here are the winners by
[3174.839s] bran we could care less
[3178.64s] um
[3180.359s] Euro oh okay so all leverage funds are
[3183.64s] short the Euro that&#39;s going to
[3185.359s] absolutely rip higher um you&#39;re seeing
[3188.68s] you know Trudeau as as more and
[3192.2s] more well I don&#39;t even need to get into
[3194.68s] the reason why the Looney a good thing
[3196.68s] happened this week that&#39;s going to help
[3197.88s] the Looney uh hang in there for those of
[3200.28s] you who are Canadian uh Looney is going
[3203.48s] to have its day in the sun here just
[3205.04s] remember back to 20 one period
[3207.64s] Commodities you can&#39;t versus global
[3209.359s] equities can&#39;t give away same in 2020
[3211.64s] when we were buying Exxon in the 30s
[3213.799s] when oil was trading negative so now
[3216.319s] it&#39;s the all borrows of the world it&#39;s
[3218.04s] other opportunities to play the
[3219.72s] Commodities trade uh Comstock of course
[3223.4s] and um and this is what helps the
[3225.24s] Emerging Markets countries and uh the
[3227.88s] Emerging Markets currencies when this
[3229.839s] inflects which it will which it shall
[3232.079s] which is also a function of Chinese
[3234.16s] stimulus and everything kicking in there
[3237.52s] which we&#39;re going to cover cta&#39;s
[3239.28s] exposure to oil shorten the whole I
[3241.16s] think oil&#39;s going up uh selling pressure
[3244.0s] in the energ sector there you go selling
[3246.44s] in the whole most crowded Longs index so
[3250.599s] look it&#39;s it&#39;s
[3253.319s] um it&#39;s in overshoot mode it can stay
[3255.92s] extended in overshoot but you don&#39;t have
[3257.52s] to play the pain of discipline or the
[3259.44s] pain of regret your choice uh this shows
[3262.359s] expensive relative to the last 10 years
[3264.24s] versus cheap relative what&#39;s cheap
[3267.04s] S&amp;P 400 which is mid S&amp;P 600 which is
[3271.52s] uh
[3273.16s] small uh and what&#39;s expensive growth and
[3276.16s] momentum so you can chase the shiny
[3278.359s] objects and be undisciplined and hope
[3280.799s] that there&#39;s another sucker that comes
[3282.28s] in behind you to lay it off to but uh
[3285.16s] chances are you&#39;ll be holding the bag
[3287.44s] that&#39;s that&#39;s what I have to say about
[3288.839s] that global valuations current and 25y
[3292.119s] year next 12 months price to earnings
[3294.359s] ratio uh so this just shows China is the
[3296.799s] cheapest relative to history and
[3298.599s] relative in absolute terms us is the
[3300.52s] most expensive keep that in mind when we
[3303.119s] covered the US versus International
[3305.64s] Cycles from Cali Cox over at rolz last
[3309.359s] week that was an awesome chart go back
[3311.64s] and review that uh if you want to think
[3314.44s] that us us is going to outperform
[3317.52s] Forever then you have a very myopic uh
[3320.76s] short-term view uh grounded in recency
[3323.48s] bias and that&#39;s where you get punished
[3325.839s] uh moving on corporate spreads this is
[3328.839s] where miracles happen uh refinancings
[3332.68s] happen interest expense for companies is
[3335.44s] at the lowest in years as we covered um
[3338.88s] and as a reminder for the shiny object
[3341.039s] crew southc stock bubble this is from
[3344.4s] December 7 1718 to December
[3350.16s] 1721 uh this was Isaac Newton not a dumb
[3352.92s] guy he uh got into South Seas stock
[3357.48s] bought a little bit he exited at a
[3359.44s] profit he bought a little bit at 200
[3361.359s] exited at
[3362.839s] 400 his friends got rich at 600 he
[3366.039s] enters with all his money at 800 it goes
[3368.68s] to 950 and then he exits at 200 flat
[3372.76s] broke and this is this is exactly what
[3375.079s] you&#39;re going to see with um Baba you
[3380.039s] know is is basically what&#39;s what&#39;s going
[3381.799s] to happen but what what&#39;s more likely is
[3384.559s] that you know most people will enter
[3387.319s] here sell on these pullbacks then buy up
[3390.72s] again sell on the pullback then buy up
[3393.68s] again sell on the pullback then buy up
[3397.28s] again sell sell on the pullback at a
[3400.72s] loss and then start buying and and get
[3402.96s] smoked so um it&#39;s just it&#39;s not it&#39;s not
[3408.44s] about being smart or knowing better it&#39;s
[3411.2s] about observing history and learning you
[3414.839s] know you can learn from your own
[3416.28s] mistakes but it&#39;s a lot more
[3418.72s] costeffective to learn from watching
[3420.76s] other mistakes and there&#39;s so much
[3422.319s] written about mistakes throughout
[3424.559s] history if you&#39;ll take some time to
[3427.2s] educate yourself and experience and
[3429.0s] nothing beats experience but uh
[3431.319s] experience coupled with knowledge
[3433.839s] there&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an unmatchable
[3435.799s] combination that can just set you up for
[3437.72s] a lifetime of happiness success and
[3439.68s] enjoyment let&#39;s just put it that way
[3441.599s] Trump AIDS ready Universal tariff plans
[3443.88s] with one key change this was uh put out
[3447.079s] then rebuked it&#39;s probably a lot of
[3449.2s] truth to it he said but only on certain
[3453.319s] sectors so it looks like the
[3454.92s] administration is walking back the
[3457.079s] blanket tariffs that had the whole
[3459.319s] Market worried Canadian dollar jumps on
[3462.28s] Trudeau and tariff reports uh so that
[3465.2s] was a spike up on the uh TR the Tariff
[3468.119s] announcements and the Trudeau
[3470.76s] resignation valuations get more lopsided
[3473.76s] more of that this is S&amp;P equal versus
[3476.76s] the S&amp;P 500 this is what they call
[3479.559s] technicians call a double bottom so you
[3482.24s] had that monster broadening from July
[3485.319s] through December then the abrupt
[3488.319s] Interruption uh and this will resume and
[3490.599s] finally break out and uh I think 2025 is
[3493.559s] that year uh this is S&amp;P 500 risk
[3497.119s] premium everyone keeps talking about
[3500.079s] this like it&#39;s a bad thing next 12
[3502.319s] months forward earning yield minus the
[3504.52s] 10-year treasury yield
[3506.76s] and what that implies so they&#39;re saying
[3509.76s] oh stocks are expensive bad timing to
[3511.28s] invest no the stocks that are driving
[3514.48s] the multiple I.E the earnings yield are
[3516.96s] too expensive and what happened during
[3518.88s] those periods is value small cap
[3521.64s] Emerging Markets International all the
[3523.799s] things that were cheap took up the reain
[3526.16s] and dramatically outperformed for the
[3527.799s] next seven years so this is bullish as
[3529.839s] hell if you know what to buy or you pay
[3532.28s] someone who knows what to buy uh a part
[3534.72s] of the profits to do it for you uh
[3537.039s] that&#39;s a home run so change in 10-year
[3539.52s] treasury year seasonality so you know
[3542.0s] there&#39;s a tendency in the postelection
[3544.48s] year to have some strength in the yields
[3548.28s] until uh early March so maybe it persist
[3552.28s] a little after the inauguration but I
[3553.839s] think we&#39;re we&#39;re pretty much there when
[3555.96s] when everyone&#39;s convinced we&#39;re going to
[3557.24s] 5% it means that the the move is
[3559.72s] probably done uh presidential cycle and
[3562.88s] returns year 1 average 6.6
[3567.4s] uh median is
[3569.119s] 8.1% that&#39;s going back to
[3571.92s] 1928 this is Russell growth versus
[3574.559s] Russell 1000
[3576.599s] value uh and you can see this you know
[3580.44s] this whole thing of the zero interest
[3584.24s] rate policy where growth outperformed is
[3586.24s] the aberration not the rule I can&#39;t
[3587.96s] reemphasize look at this from 20
[3590.4s] 2000 value outperform growth by
[3593.839s] 29% or all right let&#39;s put it the the
[3596.119s] way it&#39;s written growth underperformed
[3598.96s] value in 2000 by
[3601.52s] 29.4% growth underperformed value by
[3604.52s] 14.8% in 2001 growth underperform value
[3608.48s] by 12.4% in 20 2002 growth
[3611.92s] underperformed value by uh less than 1%
[3615.839s] in 2003 in 2004 growth underperformed
[3619.68s] value by 10.2% in 2005 growth
[3622.88s] underperformed value by 1.8% in 2006
[3626.319s] growth underperformed value by
[3628.48s] 13.2% so this is the norm same in the
[3631.839s] 80s under Reagan 81 growth
[3634.44s] underperformed 83 84 86 88 growth
[3639.44s] underperformed um so there you go ladies
[3642.96s] and gentlemen moving
[3646.4s] along cumulative flows
[3649.119s] into ETFs as a percentage of
[3652.52s] AUM uh money&#39;s moved out of Commodities
[3655.599s] in mass since
[3658.52s] 2022 uh till now so there&#39;s going to be
[3660.76s] a pony in that pile just like in 2001
[3663.96s] this month&#39;s calendar configuration has
[3665.64s] historically resulted in meaningfully
[3667.96s] slower overall payroll growth so
[3669.68s] tomorrow&#39;s payroll report like I talked
[3671.72s] about with Kristen if that comes in
[3674.079s] softer like the ADP report did this week
[3677.839s] that is going to put a cap on yields and
[3679.52s] that&#39;s going to change a lot of Dynamics
[3681.079s] so just suck up the fits and starts for
[3683.76s] the next couple of weeks it&#39;s just going
[3685.2s] to be crazy town with headlines that&#39;s
[3686.96s] the way Trump likes it and um and then
[3690.96s] we should get back to some normaly and
[3692.72s] some beautiful rotation action big
[3695.28s] beautiful rotation make rotation great
[3698.16s] again so alternative measures of
[3700.799s] employment growth slowed in December so
[3703.88s] again that would imply a softer number
[3705.599s] tomorrow which keeps the FED in the game
[3707.799s] which puts a cap on yields all good all
[3712.0s] right pairwise correlations on a
[3713.88s] 12-month rolling basis have falling
[3715.92s] suggesting a more attractive opportunity
[3717.599s] set for Alpha generation you don&#39;t get
[3719.839s] these correlations this low until you go
[3722.359s] all the way back to 2017 right after
[3724.76s] Trump got elected by the way and all the
[3727.039s] things that took off which we&#39;re
[3728.24s] positioned for and then going back to
[3730.0s] 2001 so look these things don&#39;t repeat
[3733.4s] exactly but they rhyme like crazy and if
[3735.88s] you could just pay attention to patterns
[3739.359s] um it&#39;s you know it&#39;s not rocket science
[3742.599s] the Magnificent 7 is expected to
[3744.76s] generate earnings growth of 33% in 2024
[3747.76s] which we talked about the rest of it S&amp;P
[3749.799s] grow 3% so why did Max 7 they
[3752.76s] dramatically outperformed on earnings in
[3755.76s] 2024 uh but that&#39;s changing now UNM
[3758.88s] magnificent is going to low double
[3761.079s] digits the mag 7 is decelerating
[3763.96s] actually this is crazy town I thought
[3766.119s] mag 7 was decelerating to 21% they&#39;re
[3769.559s] decelerating to 18% and they&#39;re still
[3771.559s] trading at 33 times whereas the rest of
[3774.72s] the market is probably trading at 17 18
[3777.88s] times with 11% earnings growth and then
[3780.319s] if you and then next year 16 uh uh mag 7
[3783.92s] decelerates again to 16% and mag
[3787.44s] unmagnify accelerates to 133% so I don&#39;t
[3790.92s] need to you know here&#39;s all the
[3792.279s] countries cheapest is China uh most
[3795.039s] expensive us just another way of looking
[3796.92s] at it 10year treasury yield prior to
[3800.48s] First Cut and plus 100 days so
[3803.2s] historically you get this this bump and
[3806.359s] then a weakening on balance for the
[3808.839s] biggest
[3809.799s] weights this is very interesting
[3812.319s] treasury yield see Boost from Trump
[3814.96s] tariff threats so you haven&#39;t seen this
[3817.359s] type of
[3818.559s] shortterm
[3820.279s] boost uh actually this is wild ladies
[3823.16s] and gentlemen every time so remember we
[3825.48s] were pounding the table the fourth
[3827.16s] quarter of last year by TLT and it
[3829.16s] rallied like crazy off those lows okay
[3832.039s] so that setup is here again so this is a
[3835.24s] different way of viewing it other than
[3836.76s] the commitments of Traders and then when
[3838.52s] did when does it happen again it
[3840.24s] happened again in right here after the
[3843.48s] election before the inauguration and
[3845.88s] then boom ra yields uh bonds rallied
[3849.16s] yields compressed so I I don&#39;t know how
[3851.76s] many different ways to tell you other
[3853.279s] than I hope you&#39;re listening and uh and
[3855.68s] I know we&#39;re all going to benefit so
[3857.44s] that&#39;s why we do this every week here we
[3859.68s] go um here&#39;s sler over at RBC thanks to
[3863.72s] my buddy over there what what do we got
[3866.48s] here
[3868.4s] uh okay so this is the S&amp;P
[3871.92s] 500 yeah I think these things you know
[3874.68s] that&#39;s basically the max 7 now uh
[3877.799s] they&#39;re G to they got to consolidate
[3880.079s] it&#39;s bouncing back up here okay so
[3881.88s] that&#39;s the daily here&#39;s the equal weight
[3884.0s] this looks like it&#39;s put in a double
[3885.359s] bottom ready to move back up to
[3888.039s] 188 uh this is the NASDAQ kind of
[3891.039s] hanging out here after a breakout we&#39;ll
[3892.68s] see what happens with that then you&#39;ve
[3894.76s] got the Russell 2 2000s came broke out
[3897.76s] came all the way back in December to
[3899.599s] check I think this is going to be the
[3901.48s] story in
[3903.2s] 2025 uh sentiment is weakening a little
[3906.48s] bit then you got Europe has been just
[3909.24s] been grinding sideways for over a year I
[3911.319s] think that breaks out this year that&#39;s
[3912.839s] xus Tokyo week not
[3916.44s] interested hang saying again we came off
[3919.279s] those lows in early
[3921.88s] 2024 and then we checked back at the end
[3924.2s] of the year I think this is just to
[3925.839s] stair step higher over time and then
[3928.76s] just crank completely crank higher over
[3931.68s] time uh 10-year yield so you know it&#39;s
[3934.72s] up here against this resistance I think
[3936.88s] we&#39;re I think we&#39;re pretty much there if
[3938.48s] we get a few more weeks of hovering up
[3940.96s] here below five so be it just to bang
[3944.079s] out all the people shorten the hole suck
[3946.119s] in more shorts and then absolutely roast
[3948.4s] them all uh God bless him I can wait a
[3950.839s] few weeks not a big deal um so that&#39;s
[3955.079s] that and then you got the dollar same
[3957.119s] story here up against resistance at the
[3959.279s] 61.8 if that means anything I could care
[3962.119s] less uh a few more weeks suck in a lot
[3964.76s] more Longs and then just roast them and
[3967.52s] then Canadian dollar starting to come
[3969.44s] off the boil after
[3971.88s] Trudeau um I love these overshoots it
[3975.119s] gets you know it&#39;s just part of the
[3977.52s] game crude taking a little bit of a bid
[3980.279s] here on the daily that&#39;s that&#39;s expected
[3982.44s] gold has been weak everyone wanted it in
[3984.76s] in the fall now now it&#39;s uh let&#39;s see
[3987.44s] how that works out uh copper I think
[3989.92s] this is going to be a long story just
[3991.52s] like in 2001 I think uh the China
[3994.279s] stimulus they&#39;ve been P pushing a ton of
[3996.48s] stuff in the pipeline for a year and a
[3998.119s] half it&#39;s been peac meal but it&#39;s adding
[3999.72s] up materially and it&#39;s all going to hit
[4001.599s] at once and no one&#39;s going to be
[4002.599s] prepared for it and they&#39;re going to say
[4004.44s] what happened and and a lot of these
[4005.839s] stocks are going to double in a year and
[4007.24s] everyone&#39;s going to be interested in
[4009.16s] 2016 the best ideas are going to be CH
[4012.119s] they&#39;re all going to be touting China
[4013.52s] and international after 100% move and um
[4017.599s] you know
[4020.359s] uh that&#39;s the good news I mean I don&#39;t
[4022.68s] know if 100 I don&#39;t think 100% move is
[4025.359s] enough for us to be sold sold to you so
[4027.16s] we&#39;ll ride their exuberance for another
[4029.76s] year and then we&#39;ll just lay off to all
[4031.16s] the Johnny come lately but um uh all
[4034.48s] this stuff is just playing out as
[4036.359s] anticipated with a little overshoot on a
[4038.079s] couple but there we are semiconductors
[4040.64s] consolidating Nvidia we talked about
[4042.92s] with
[4043.64s] st uh you know 30 30 40 times sales 5050
[4047.72s] times earnings decelerating
[4049.76s] growth
[4051.319s] um you know assumption that there will
[4053.599s] never be competition except every single
[4055.599s] semiconductor cycle for the last 40
[4057.48s] years competition always comes uh a lot
[4060.44s] of people betting on this times it&#39;s
[4062.0s] different why because of recency bias
[4064.039s] because you know they weren&#39;t even
[4065.48s] through puberty the last semiconductor
[4067.2s] cycle and you know it&#39;s where we are uh
[4069.92s] Applied Materials okay so that&#39;s that
[4072.44s] anything else we want to see on This MC
[4075.16s] I like these drug stocks I like these
[4077.44s] big drug stocks Pepsi some of these
[4080.079s] things uh we&#39;re not doing anything yet
[4083.279s] you know Colgate probably interesting
[4085.76s] hasn&#39;t come down enough for us yet
[4087.48s] that&#39;s a great long-term business to own
[4089.079s] set and forget dividend Aristocrat
[4091.2s] grower a lot of these things haven&#39;t
[4093.039s] come down enough these High Flyers this
[4095.4s] ge story is
[4097.759s] perfect uh we were pounding on GE no one
[4100.92s] was listening I will say that uh I think
[4103.759s] this is going to be very similar to the
[4104.96s] Boeing turnaround story so when
[4107.48s] everyone&#39;s giving up on it uh that was
[4109.64s] the case with GE for sure and then the
[4112.12s] new CEO turns it around and Kelly
[4114.6s] ortberg is the guy Rockwell Collins six
[4117.239s] bagger in four four bagger in six years
[4120.319s] uh with Rockwell Collins wealth
[4122.719s] generator turnaround
[4125.0s] specialist uh as you can tell we bet a
[4127.359s] lot on our
[4128.799s] jockey all right so that was good stuff
[4131.04s] from slomer this just just keeping in p
[4133.319s] uh perspective what we&#39;ve been talking
[4135.12s] about since 2000 is we&#39;re only halfway
[4137.96s] through the cycle everyone was panicked
[4139.44s] here I said we got 10 plus more years
[4141.839s] now we&#39;ve got six plus more years and um
[4146.239s] uh that&#39;s just the way it works it&#39;s
[4147.839s] demographically driven he doesn&#39;t really
[4149.359s] go into the demographics of it but you
[4151.44s] basically have Gen X which was a smaller
[4153.64s] generation than the Boomers so you get
[4155.159s] this 15 years of uh consolidation you
[4157.56s] went from 80 million people to 65 that&#39;s
[4160.04s] why you get this that&#39;s why the FED
[4161.4s] could print unlimited money with no
[4162.88s] inflation now the game has changed you
[4165.08s] got 12,000 uh people turning 35 every
[4168.48s] year buying houses cars babies uh
[4171.759s] washing machines all that stuff&#39;s going
[4173.319s] to continue for five plus years until
[4175.12s] they&#39;re 40 is when the spending slows
[4177.48s] same thing happened in the roar in the
[4179.0s] 50s same thing happened in the Roaring
[4181.239s] 20s uh and so on and so forth and then
[4183.92s] we&#39;ll get extremely defensive uh in the
[4186.12s] early 2030s and we we will take the
[4188.64s] fortune that we make over the next 5 six
[4191.04s] years for clients and for ourselves and
[4194.199s] uh we will uh uh be able to buy
[4197.48s] unbelievable businesses uh forever
[4200.4s] businesses at you know 50 70 90% off um
[4204.88s] it&#39;ll be like it is right now for
[4207.64s] certain sectors it will be for many
[4209.96s] sectors and um and uh and that&#39;ll be
[4215.239s] unbelievable run so you know in the
[4217.8s] early 30s if I&#39;m in cash and the market
[4220.159s] keeps going up and up and I&#39;m talking
[4222.719s] about shorts and you&#39;re going to say
[4224.12s] Tom&#39;s lost his touch he used used to be
[4225.64s] so optimistic what happened to Tom you
[4228.0s] know he was a one of the greatest uh e
[4230.64s] Equity investors and and now he&#39;s just
[4232.6s] this pessimistic short what happened and
[4234.88s] then by 20 by by
[4237.4s] 2034 uh you&#39;ll be like oh okay all right
[4241.28s] so you know turnaround time is often
[4243.6s] early by the way turnarounds work both
[4245.48s] ways ladies and gentlemen
[4248.48s] uh uh sometimes early but over time
[4251.88s] mostly right uh you&#39;ll you&#39;ll know
[4254.04s] what&#39;s going on in the early 20 30s when
[4255.88s] I when I&#39;m less pessimistic that&#39;s a lot
[4257.6s] less fun uh I think the next six years
[4259.76s] is going to be a lot more fun but there
[4261.4s] we go emerging okay so uh someone sent
[4264.0s] me this emerging stocks enter correction
[4266.44s] as Traders weigh US policies
[4271.52s] um I&#39;m not really going to comment on it
[4274.04s] I&#39;m just going to show you a chart and
[4275.44s] you can draw your own conclusions with
[4277.96s] these uh dog
[4281.36s] headlines uh so does this look like
[4284.239s] something you should be dramatic Ally
[4285.56s] worried about or does this like look
[4287.719s] like something that you hold because you
[4289.88s] know if you were down here buying in the
[4292.12s] hole when absolutely no one wanted it
[4294.84s] the last year and a half China Emerging
[4297.199s] Markets everything else when we pound in
[4298.84s] the table every week it&#39;s made progress
[4301.0s] not not nearly as much progress as we
[4302.92s] know it&#39;s going to make um but it&#39;s no
[4305.88s] different than it was in the early 2000s
[4308.4s] ladies and gentlemen you know you saw
[4310.0s] this type of thing then it then this
[4312.56s] fake out and it comes back and then it
[4314.88s] just you know it kind of checks back and
[4316.719s] then you get these parabolic moves and I
[4319.239s] think we&#39;re setting up for something
[4320.56s] similar here so these are the type of
[4322.48s] things to take you out of your stocks at
[4324.36s] the exact wrong time for stupid people
[4326.96s] who don&#39;t do their own research get
[4328.52s] faked out by stuff like this so um so
[4332.679s] thank god um and that creates
[4334.96s] opportunity for people like you FMC
[4337.48s] shares pop as kbank says sell off is
[4339.92s] overdone this is in the material space
[4342.159s] again there&#39;s just so much to do in
[4343.6s] materials from we&#39;re looking at Dow CH
[4346.6s] chemical selones we&#39;re I mean it&#39;s it&#39;s
[4350.12s] unlimited
[4351.52s] FMC Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow Mosaic we&#39;re
[4355.199s] not doing anything with that one for
[4356.6s] sure um but there&#39;s there&#39;s going to be
[4360.639s] a lot of money made in materials this
[4362.199s] year so ba founder Robin Lee predicts
[4365.96s] exponential boom in AI apps for 2025
[4369.4s] well thank you for the prediction but
[4371.08s] being that Alibaba is the number one
[4372.8s] player we will be the number one
[4374.04s] beneficiary so appreciate the optimism
[4376.56s] for your competitor Bloomberg China&#39;s
[4379.36s] pboc vales more support for Innovation
[4381.96s] and consumption so again they just keep
[4384.679s] pushing the ball underwater when they
[4387.36s] when their hands are released the ball
[4389.239s] will absolutely pop uh GM Ford report
[4393.28s] best annual us Sal since 2019 as Auto
[4396.36s] Recovery continues I love it for Cooper
[4399.159s] standard people aren&#39;t paying attention
[4401.52s] and you get that opportunity as we have
[4405.12s] have been taking advantage of hand over
[4408.12s] fist pboc reiterates China cut rates
[4411.28s] Reserve ratio to be cut at appropriate
[4413.239s] time when is the appropriate time right
[4415.239s] after the inauguration natural gas
[4417.56s] stocks have momentum and cold weather so
[4420.44s] this is uh everyone getting excited
[4423.28s] after all these stocks are up more than
[4424.8s] 100% in a few weeks take Warren
[4427.28s] Buffett&#39;s advice don&#39;t buy any stock in
[4429.48s] 2025 unless it passes this test two very
[4432.88s] simple test number one uh Buffett first
[4436.48s] determines whether he can sensibly
[4438.239s] estimate an earnings range for five
[4440.96s] years out or more the only type of
[4442.92s] companies you can do that in are not in
[4444.679s] high flyers or IPOs or new technologies
[4447.56s] where you&#39;re guessing and praying and
[4449.56s] hoping and chasing the crowd but for
[4451.52s] durable businesses that have been
[4453.12s] through many cycles that have a proven
[4455.159s] moat and you can understand the
[4457.0s] cyclicality and how the the fundamentals
[4459.199s] move relative to the price the
[4460.639s] fundamentals May deviate 5 10 15% if
[4464.199s] it&#39;s a big turnaround
[4465.679s] and the price deviates 80% so we love
[4468.56s] that I mean that Arbitrage I&#39;ll play all
[4470.679s] day long for the rest of my life like
[4472.52s] nobody&#39;s business it&#39;s what I love to do
[4474.52s] I&#39;m good at one single thing this tiny
[4476.84s] little Narrow Lane and I don&#39;t deviate I
[4478.8s] really don&#39;t do private deals I don&#39;t uh
[4481.32s] invest in it I I just eat my own cooking
[4483.52s] everything I do everything I talk about
[4485.56s] is where I put all my money all my money
[4487.199s] is where my mouth is um and um and then
[4491.4s] the second test is to buy a stock only
[4494.44s] if it trades quote at a reasonable price
[4497.28s] relative to the lower end of his
[4499.4s] historic earnings range he will buy a
[4502.28s] stock only if it&#39;s reasonably valued
[4503.88s] using this approach again if the stock
[4506.639s] doesn&#39;t pass this second step he moves
[4508.48s] on so you know I have a different filter
[4511.84s] which is pretty much the same filter
[4513.36s] number one is um if this so I&#39;m more
[4517.88s] about protecting the downside the upside
[4519.56s] takes care of itself if this stock was
[4521.12s] to go to zero would they take me out on
[4522.6s] a stretcher because there can always be
[4524.6s] things that that you don&#39;t know that you
[4525.92s] don&#39;t know and there&#39;s no way you could
[4527.52s] know so that deals with sizing and risk
[4531.36s] so if you have a you know High
[4532.96s] conviction 8 10 12% position and the
[4536.08s] world ends and it takes you out you got
[4538.32s] your other nine that are doubles or
[4539.92s] triples over the next few years using
[4542.159s] the same framework they&#39;re going to more
[4543.8s] than amply compensate uh the good news
[4546.04s] is you know the DI Minimus probability
[4549.52s] of that ever happening is so small but
[4552.199s] you have to hedge against the
[4554.4s] possibility
[4555.44s] ever happening so that&#39;s number one
[4557.12s] number two is if I was to walk into the
[4561.08s] boardroom of this
[4562.84s] company and offer to buy the entire
[4565.84s] company at the price it was currently Mo
[4568.08s] marked in the public markets would the
[4572.76s] board call security to have me escorted
[4575.36s] out of the building because I was
[4577.04s] absolutely crazy and insulting to offer
[4579.719s] to buy the company at that price and if
[4581.96s] the answer is no meaning they would take
[4584.199s] the meeting because they think that
[4585.52s] might be a fair price then I&#39;m not
[4587.32s] interested I&#39;m not buying it and um and
[4589.92s] that you just learn with experience over
[4591.6s] time and that&#39;s why they call me
[4593.28s] turnaround Tom uh Chinese companies have
[4596.12s] sidest stepped Trump&#39;s tariffs they
[4597.6s] could do it again Ulta beauty stock
[4600.08s] jumps new CEO goes a long way it&#39;s
[4602.12s] another one we&#39;ve got our eyes on my
[4603.44s] kids are in Ulta and Sephora all the
[4606.199s] time uh China&#39;s Central Bank outlines
[4608.88s] monetary policies for
[4610.52s] 2025 emphasizing expanding domestic
[4613.92s] demand of which
[4615.96s] Alibaba is the number one toll taker for
[4617.88s] the middle class and upper class quality
[4620.0s] items Teemu sells the garbage disposable
[4622.56s] crap to poor people uh and uh their
[4625.4s] numbers as we&#39;ve said for many months
[4628.12s] either unsustainable which is now
[4629.719s] proving to be the case or unreliable
[4632.44s] which um we shall see stabilizing
[4635.719s] expectations and stimulating Vitality to
[4637.48s] ensure sustained Improvement in the
[4639.32s] Chinese economy uh AI has a cost problem
[4642.56s] what it means for the other for the
[4643.96s] stock market and five things to know so
[4646.12s] what they&#39;re just saying is that every
[4648.04s] $200 a month subscription that Sam Alman
[4651.44s] sells he loses money on because every
[4654.48s] search query costs 10 times the cost of
[4656.88s] a Google Search and um uh $1,000 of
[4662.04s] computing power per task so it&#39;s just a
[4665.159s] losing business and then the people that
[4666.96s] are buying all these chips are not
[4669.32s] getting an amp ample return on
[4671.04s] investment which is why you&#39;re getting
[4672.92s] decelerating uh earnings growth all
[4675.48s] these great things are going to come
[4676.639s] true okay just like all the great things
[4679.52s] that Amazon have done have come true the
[4681.96s] difference was
[4683.44s] Amazon fell 90% from 2000 to 2003 or
[4689.199s] whatever it was despite fundamentals
[4692.12s] kind of improving because they were
[4694.48s] people were already paying as if all the
[4697.92s] things that came true over the next 15
[4700.159s] years were already happening and um uh
[4704.84s] it always takes a little longer all
[4706.56s] these things take a little bit longer so
[4709.04s] getting in on the second phase when
[4710.44s] people have thrown in the towel is
[4712.159s] really uh a great opportunity China
[4715.56s] confirmed xinping and Donald Trump have
[4718.32s] been in touch since the US election
[4721.0s] Trudeau resignation opens the door for
[4722.88s] Trump going easier on trade tariffs with
[4726.0s] Canada especially if Wayne Gretzky
[4728.199s] becomes
[4731.12s] Governor you can&#39;t make this stuff up I
[4733.96s] think I think would be great by the way
[4736.04s] you know he&#39;s a winner what else do you
[4737.52s] want to know uh Disney links inks deal
[4741.08s] to combine Hulu Plus live TV business
[4743.92s] into fubo I like this deal I use fubo
[4746.92s] because they have better Sports than
[4748.159s] YouTube TV I liked YouTube TV I use fubo
[4752.04s] uh and they let me screen screenshot uh
[4755.08s] some of the things when I do TV Etc
[4757.44s] which YouTube blocked me and all that
[4759.12s] stuff so uh they&#39;re too cute by half and
[4763.44s] um and then
[4765.239s] and and the interesting thing was I kept
[4767.159s] looking at
[4769.28s] fubo to buy and I just couldn&#39;t get my
[4772.96s] hands around I&#39;m like they&#39;re kind of
[4774.88s] you know you know kind of flailing in
[4777.6s] the wind and now with this deal we own
[4779.679s] 70% of fubo through our ownership in
[4783.52s] Disney I love this it&#39;s just like all
[4785.159s] the great things we own through Alibaba
[4787.08s] without actually having to own it uh
[4789.679s] directly uh on a standalone basis so
[4792.28s] this is a home run uh
[4798.679s] and that&#39;s that so Bob Iger strikes
[4802.32s] again good job there Disney stock gets
[4804.639s] an upgrade amid content Renaissance and
[4807.08s] streaming profit growth remember when we
[4809.08s] got involved 70s 8s you couldn&#39;t give it
[4811.48s] away uh people said the streaming is
[4813.639s] losing money it&#39;s never going to turn
[4815.56s] well they did it they turned profitable
[4817.679s] they&#39;re huge they I mean same story over
[4821.04s] and over we had to go through the whole
[4822.4s] bass family to convince you and this and
[4824.199s] that this happens every Cycles but
[4825.76s] that&#39;s what Buffett&#39;s talking about of
[4827.04s] being able to estimate the turnarounds
[4828.639s] and the cyclical because you see these
[4830.239s] things happen over and over again they
[4832.44s] just found a new way to sell the content
[4834.36s] their amazing Content Library in 1984
[4836.52s] when the bass family took a huge
[4837.96s] position in it they went from uh you
[4841.12s] know movie theaters to VHS then they
[4843.32s] caught another run in the 90s with DVDs
[4845.92s] and now they&#39;re catching another run
[4847.28s] with with streaming but streaming is
[4849.04s] better than DVDs because it recurs every
[4851.199s] single month uh you weren&#39;t selling
[4853.32s] someone one new DVD every single month
[4855.56s] guaranteed uh which is just beautiful so
[4858.199s] fed isn&#39;t certain where interest rates
[4859.639s] will head minutes show inflation and
[4861.159s] Trump are concerned so uh my guess is
[4863.719s] nowhere until probably June but let&#39;s
[4866.719s] see how it goes China ramps up you
[4869.08s] unless the labor part if the labor
[4871.159s] market starts weakening a little bit
[4872.679s] they will be all over that and cutting
[4875.199s] again in March they seem a little bit
[4877.719s] more worried about the labor market than
[4880.08s] inflation China ramps up Yuan support
[4882.8s] with record Hong Kong bill issue
[4885.159s] so they&#39;re on it here we&#39;re ramping up
[4887.159s] just in time for people to be on the
[4889.04s] wrong side of the trade so here is the
[4891.56s] power up stock market and sentiment
[4894.239s] results uh we covered all the media
[4896.639s] wanted to do a gener update we haven&#39;t
[4898.36s] covered that a lot because we you know
[4901.12s] if you&#39;ve listened for a while you know
[4902.36s] we don&#39;t spend much time talking about
[4903.679s] our winners we we uh we&#39;ve been talking
[4906.159s] about uh generx well below $100 and then
[4909.199s] it shot up to 195 now it&#39;s at 160 look
[4912.679s] all you need to know here um we can go
[4914.96s] through every word of the transcript
[4916.32s] which we did but uh we don&#39;t have time
[4918.159s] for that um is free cash flows
[4921.159s] accelerating and free cash flows now at
[4922.96s] the levels you saw when it was a $524
[4925.36s] stock it&#39;s at $158 so you know getting
[4929.159s] back to 200 and Beyond is easy peasy and
[4932.4s] then the question is where does the
[4934.239s] growth stall out on the next cycle is it
[4936.4s] is the stock 250 is it 300 does it get
[4938.88s] back to New all-time highs that&#39;s going
[4940.639s] to take a while I think new all-time
[4942.159s] Highs but uh this is the same story
[4944.719s] story uh over and over and uh they
[4948.04s] continue to bring the share count down
[4950.08s] earnings are recovering after a trough
[4952.6s] in 2023 they work through the dstock
[4955.4s] cycle now we&#39;re back into the restock
[4957.12s] cycle going to be at record earnings by
[4959.12s] 2026 2027 free cash flow per share is
[4962.84s] going through the roof sales per share
[4965.04s] have re accelerated to all-time highs
[4966.92s] because they brought in the share count
[4968.679s] and they&#39;re just dominating residential
[4970.92s] commercial and Industrial you see them
[4972.639s] every single way and they got their
[4974.08s] hands and the the whole Eco stuff that
[4977.28s] uh you know it&#39;s kind of a waste of time
[4979.04s] but they got to be there as just a
[4980.719s] blockout competition and this is the
[4982.8s] cycle of gener they have these huge
[4985.159s] growth runs uh like they did into 2021
[4987.8s] they consolidate for a few years with a
[4989.96s] little bit of lower Revenue they recover
[4991.679s] after a couple down years and then back
[4993.6s] to the next growth cycle same thing
[4995.48s] rinse repeat and that&#39;s where we are
[4997.199s] right now just like Boeing no different
[4999.56s] uh us penetration rate is only 6.25% you
[5002.48s] can see some of their uh other states
[5005.04s] are at 21 to 25% like Michigan West
[5008.92s] Virginia Maine Louisiana where they have
[5011.56s] reg regular outages everyone has one
[5014.239s] every 1% additional penetration uh Look
[5017.6s] at California zero
[5019.6s] to 3% I mean you think California is
[5022.679s] going to sell a few generators in the
[5024.08s] next few months you you bet your bottom
[5026.08s] dollar when they&#39;re shutting power off
[5027.48s] in Los Angeles this a one every 1% is a
[5030.84s] $3.5
[5032.36s] billion opportunity so um you know you
[5036.92s] get 14
[5038.56s] more uh percent penetration or let&#39;s
[5041.32s] just say 10$ 35 billion opportunity I
[5044.48s] mean that&#39;s that&#39;s where fortunes are
[5045.88s] made ladies and gentlemen and uh you
[5048.0s] know the most important chart here which
[5049.92s] actually blew my mind uh well first one
[5053.28s] I love this one obviously Sal sales
[5055.159s] recovering margins recovering free cash
[5057.719s] flow just off the charts uh almost $500
[5061.8s] million of free cash flow for 2020
[5064.4s] before you can&#39;t give it away I love
[5066.36s] this well some people started bidding it
[5068.239s] it was a double and now it&#39;s come back a
[5070.28s] little bit so uh you can give it away
[5073.88s] people were were taking it at
[5076.159s] 194 uh but um anyway this is what&#39;s
[5080.08s] really cool because I&#39;m like how you
[5082.28s] know 6% penetration what what what
[5084.719s] happens this is the adoption curve of
[5089.719s] um central air conditioning it looks a
[5093.36s] lot like it you know in from
[5095.92s] 1945 to
[5099.159s] 1950 to 1960 the first 15 years of
[5103.119s] central air conditioning the penetration
[5105.08s] rate was only
[5107.96s] 6.25% uh which is basically 205 to
[5111.639s] 2024 of uh uh generators Home standby
[5116.04s] generators and then it just completely
[5118.56s] hockey sticked after 1965 and went
[5120.639s] straight from 10% generation uh
[5122.92s] penetration to 80 8% penetration I think
[5125.76s] with what you&#39;re seeing with the grids
[5128.28s] and the demand that AI is going to have
[5130.4s] on the grids and everything else and air
[5132.8s] conditioners and everything else the
[5134.04s] instability and the weather and all that
[5136.32s] stuff I don&#39;t know if we ever get to 88%
[5138.56s] but I I I would be surprised if we
[5140.8s] didn&#39;t get to 30 or 40% over the next 10
[5143.6s] 15 years you see the same adoption curve
[5146.36s] with Home Security Alarms we&#39;re
[5148.32s] basically at zero in 1980 within the
[5150.719s] first 20 years got up to 19% now at 29%
[5154.88s] portable generators up to uh went from 0
[5158.36s] to
[5159.159s] 20% so and then home standby generators
[5161.96s] so I think more and more I think this is
[5163.88s] going to be a feature when people build
[5165.28s] new houses as well uh in a more
[5167.8s] meaningful way you see residential up
[5170.56s] 27% year on-year if you look at last 12
[5174.04s] months up 10.4 net sales up 99.6% on the
[5177.96s] quarter gross profit up 9% net income up
[5180.32s] 88% free cash flow up
[5183.239s] 56.5 5% year onye uh uh and uh last 12
[5189.28s] months free cash flow up
[5192.96s] 178% pretty exciting uh free cash
[5197.04s] flow last 12 months 584 so nine times I
[5202.36s] mean anyway so this is exciting here&#39;s
[5205.32s] the fear and greed Index this is not
[5207.08s] what you see at tops really could It Go
[5209.04s] lower before it goes higher yes um and
[5212.36s] then finally congratulations to all the
[5213.679s] new clients that came in through during
[5215.04s] our 2024 well let&#39;s just say all of our
[5217.28s] raises and our first week of our q1 2025
[5220.719s] opening you cannot be better position
[5222.52s] for what we believe will be a very
[5224.119s] highly rewarding year in 2025 this view
[5226.119s] is based on much of the data we&#39;ve
[5227.239s] shared in recent weeks on our podcast
[5228.679s] video cast as well as our proprietary
[5230.199s] methods of expressing and executing upon
[5232.28s] those views on your behalf we reopened
[5234.32s] to smaller accounts $1 million plus
[5236.04s] again starting last week because we want
[5238.56s] to be fully positioned as soon as
[5240.239s] possible before the inauguration based
[5242.119s] on some of the data we have referenced
[5243.639s] on recent podcast video episodes and
[5245.719s] will remain open for the next couple of
[5247.52s] weeks uh I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s no at
[5250.119s] this point we&#39;re get we&#39;re bumping up so
[5251.88s] it&#39;s probably not going to be two full
[5253.28s] weeks but something like a week and a
[5254.84s] half uh but close no later than the
[5257.199s] inauguration and that&#39;s probably too
[5259.04s] late congratulations to all I had the
[5261.04s] pleasure of speaking with and onboarding
[5262.48s] in the last week or so after we opened
[5264.56s] up we begun deploying capital on your
[5266.44s] behalf uh in a material way and if
[5269.52s] you&#39;re still in the process of the
[5270.84s] application approval uh you can call
[5272.92s] them directly uh it usually takes 24 to
[5275.4s] 48 hours uh and then we can start to
[5278.36s] deploy once that hits uh to see if you
[5281.119s] qualify and take advantage that you
[5282.4s] click here larger accounts 5 to 10
[5285.04s] million can access B service at their
[5287.159s] preference at any
[5288.52s] time uh so that&#39;s that it&#39;s opinion not
[5291.4s] advice do whatever you want talk to your
[5292.96s] financial adviser let&#39;s talk about
[5295.76s] earnings are the name of the game uh
[5299.36s] Tech revised down by about 1% in the
[5302.96s] last 60 days top 30 weights and
[5304.88s] communication Services again both of
[5306.84s] these trading at the highest multiples
[5308.28s] communication Services was revised up 72
[5311.239s] basis points so nothing material on
[5313.28s] either of those and now on to the ask me
[5315.88s] anything question so if you uh are a fan
[5318.52s] of the ask me anything questions stick
[5320.08s] around if you just like the podcast
[5322.0s] thanks for tuning in let&#39;s start with
[5324.04s] number one from Chris C Uber
[5327.6s] Technologies let&#39;s take a
[5329.92s] look um
[5334.159s] this is not the type of I can&#39;t really
[5337.0s] predict who&#39;s going to win you know you
[5339.48s] see all these Whos driving around
[5341.88s] without
[5344.119s] drivers uh look I mean Dar is running a
[5347.28s] good business the cash flow continues to
[5351.119s] grow there&#39;s nothing wrong I just have
[5353.52s] to guess the future on this one and I
[5355.4s] don&#39;t like to guess the future so for me
[5357.88s] it&#39;s no I I think it looks
[5360.159s] reasonable um at a glance I think it&#39;s
[5364.32s] more of a trading vehicle than something
[5366.199s] you want to be in forever but um you
[5369.48s] know why am I getting this question at
[5371.239s] 60 instead of at 20 that&#39;s when it was
[5374.0s] an interesting one so that&#39;s not for me
[5377.52s] right now now it could be 100 could be
[5379.239s] 300 could be all that stuff but I&#39;m not
[5382.159s] going to guess the future I just like
[5383.56s] things that I can predict with
[5385.719s] reasonable certainty stigen Ain uh Tom
[5390.119s] I&#39;d like to hear your thoughts on both
[5391.48s] Burberry and or carrying both luxury
[5394.199s] plays have been beaten down both change
[5395.76s] CEOs creative directors potential return
[5398.119s] a Chinese consumer is there room for a
[5400.0s] turn around I think so I mean we get a
[5402.239s] question on Curry on
[5404.52s] uh uh Burberry every single week I&#39;ve
[5408.56s] looked at it a few times and I&#39;ve
[5409.88s] continue to say no because even when
[5412.76s] China was doing well the stock couldn&#39;t
[5415.0s] get out of its own way it&#39;s done nothing
[5416.639s] for basically 12 years so for me and uh
[5421.0s] and I think that&#39;s consistent with the
[5422.92s] fundamentals I think it&#39;s just a dead
[5425.36s] brand and uh you know maybe you can get
[5427.92s] some miracle worker in there and get a
[5429.76s] pump for a couple years but look free
[5431.88s] cash flow is
[5433.52s] is well below 12 years ago the reason
[5436.6s] the Stock&#39;s gone nowhere and and uh
[5439.199s] nothing&#39;s happening is because the cash
[5441.04s] flow has gone nowhere it&#39;s gone down
[5443.84s] revenues have gone nowhere they&#39;ve gone
[5445.52s] down so uh just because the prices gone
[5448.199s] down doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a cheap stock uh
[5450.119s] so for me no no real interest CG might
[5453.199s] be a different story
[5455.28s] uh k e r i
[5460.6s] g yeah this thing is still in massive
[5463.639s] distribution but it&#39;s it&#39;s definitely
[5466.36s] probably more
[5468.159s] interesting uh k
[5472.0s] e
[5473.96s] r i n g
[5486.719s] I mean I mean this is not a mystery like
[5489.199s] the the stock has really gone down with
[5491.96s] free cash flow so you got to understand
[5493.36s] the turnaround situation looks like cash
[5495.6s] flow is starting to recover a little bit
[5497.119s] let&#39;s take a look at
[5500.719s] um I think this one let&#39;s see fashion
[5503.48s] leather
[5505.36s] goods
[5507.56s] jul okay Gucci St lauron Anana bad Bion
[5513.119s] blah blah blah blah
[5514.52s] yeah this is kind of more interesting
[5516.239s] it&#39;s a little more
[5517.48s] Diversified than
[5524.679s] um yeah I mean it&#39;s training 1.5 T sales
[5530.84s] uh you got a dividend on
[5535.719s] here I mean if you if you put a gun in
[5537.88s] my said head and said pick pick one I&#39;d
[5541.4s] say uh CG for sure
[5546.44s] but I don&#39;t think this thing&#39;s going to
[5547.92s] turn around right away I think this is
[5549.08s] going to take a couple years to uh find
[5551.199s] new buyers could be wrong on that but uh
[5554.4s] you know this is a lot of institutional
[5556.36s] destruction it&#39;s going to take a long
[5557.6s] time to rebuild a share
[5559.239s] base uh
[5562.0s] Kyle meum hey Tom you mentioned last
[5564.96s] week that a lot of Yen carry trade funds
[5566.52s] are focused on the mag s
[5568.91s] [Music]
[5578.08s] yeah I mean look if they&#39;re in the S&amp;P
[5579.679s] 500 they&#39;re focused on the mag 7 so um
[5583.44s] bottom line is when the Yen carry trade
[5585.719s] on wines the thing that&#39;s going to get
[5587.32s] hit the the biggest is the heaviest
[5588.88s] weights which is the mag7 which also has
[5591.159s] another reason which is decelerated
[5592.76s] earnings growth so nothing new there
[5594.88s] what do you think about GPC I know
[5596.8s] you&#39;re in investing in Autos like CPS
[5598.679s] and AAP I mean GPC is a better quality
[5601.6s] business but you have much less up side
[5604.159s] with the same amount of risk so uh I
[5608.04s] know that Mommy and Daddy tell you to
[5610.36s] buy the best quality company in the
[5612.28s] industry uh and that&#39;s perfectly fine
[5614.719s] and good advice uh you know but if
[5618.0s] you&#39;re looking for doubles and triples
[5619.92s] over a few years uh you&#39;re not going to
[5622.08s] get that when everyone&#39;s already seeing
[5623.6s] what you see and the stock is fully
[5625.56s] priced so uh for me it&#39;s a pass but if
[5628.88s] you bought it and held it I don&#39;t think
[5630.639s] you&#39;d really be disappointed but you&#39;re
[5632.8s] just not going to get double and triples
[5635.28s] Jessica
[5636.32s] Lily thank you for all you do you&#39;re
[5638.56s] welcome thank you I thought I would
[5640.32s] chime in as I&#39;ve been a nurse for 25
[5642.08s] years when backers manufacturing
[5644.48s] facility went down due to weather we
[5646.239s] were completely backordered on IV fluid
[5648.28s] and no facility anywhere I talked to
[5649.92s] could get fluids it shows you that they
[5651.679s] basically have a monopoly on IV fluids
[5654.119s] so thank you for that
[5656.119s] feedback um m
[5659.639s] m uh cus
[5664.639s] since your interviews with Kiko then
[5666.52s] David limb to become okay what kind of
[5671.56s] economic oh you seem to be overall
[5673.639s] bullish on 2025 what kind of economic
[5675.48s] DAV surveys yield curves would you make
[5678.08s] you revaluate your current
[5679.84s] stance um yeah decline you know earnings
[5683.239s] coming down uh
[5685.0s] materially
[5687.08s] um what opinion would make you feel
[5689.119s] wrong so Mor is you know reading all the
[5691.679s] the Doom porn blogs I&#39;m sure and they&#39;re
[5694.4s] all telling them get out of your stocks
[5696.04s] blah blah blah um you know I don&#39;t want
[5699.8s] to be in certain stocks I I I definitely
[5702.48s] think there could be stocks that get hit
[5704.199s] hard I just I know what the margin of
[5706.84s] safety is in my stocks and like
[5709.52s] literally the market could collapse 50%
[5712.119s] tomorrow and I wouldn&#39;t feel
[5713.76s] uncomfortable in any one of my positions
[5715.92s] because I&#39;m buying them at with such a
[5717.44s] margin now might the price get impaired
[5719.6s] for a short period of time sure the
[5721.04s] price could get impaired for a short
[5722.119s] period of time but when you&#39;re running
[5723.28s] on low and no leverage it&#39;s not an issue
[5726.48s] it&#39;s you you still own the same
[5728.08s] percentage of the business uh and Etc so
[5732.6s] um you know for all these people saying
[5734.8s] the guild covers onver there were toast
[5736.88s] uh we&#39;re going to have a recession let
[5738.32s] me remind you we had the recession that
[5741.6s] everyone is looking for in
[5744.119s] 2022 with two quarters of negative GDP
[5746.92s] growth which followed a recession in
[5749.679s] 2020 we had two recessions that is the
[5752.96s] definition of of a technical recession
[5755.44s] in 2 years average is 4.1 so we pulled
[5759.119s] forward eight years of recessions in two
[5762.32s] years we have Runway we have liquidity
[5766.8s] when the facts change I will change my
[5769.0s] mind right now there&#39;s nothing that
[5770.76s] supports that fact other than a bunch of
[5773.199s] people trying to sell you clicks and
[5774.76s] take you out of your stocks at the exact
[5776.96s] wrong time now if your portfolio is
[5779.8s] paler in Nvidia good luck you may
[5782.56s] experience a DE while a good portion of
[5785.239s] the other stocks go up or you may
[5787.44s] experience a double I can&#39;t predict that
[5789.28s] because I can&#39;t value it I cannot
[5791.96s] predict the future so those are not
[5793.88s] stocks for me and again I will say and
[5796.6s] continue to
[5798.04s] reiterate there are many paths to the
[5801.04s] top of the mountain my path is not the
[5803.76s] only way there are plenty of ways to
[5805.56s] make money in and out of the stock
[5807.6s] market I just do the one that I am very
[5810.56s] good at and that I have confidence and I
[5812.52s] can sleep like a baby at night because I
[5814.159s] know what I own and they have relatively
[5816.56s] predictable business models cash flows
[5818.48s] revenues Etc now you can you can go into
[5822.08s] the prediction game and make a ton of
[5823.639s] money gamble in your right you could
[5825.679s] also hit you know 31 on the roulette
[5828.4s] wheel and you
[5830.48s] know multibag your money and your bet
[5833.679s] but the odds of reliably predicting the
[5838.08s] future and guessing on the next
[5839.84s] Technologies are limited which is why
[5841.639s] Buffett never did it and he was a
[5843.28s] greatest compounder of wealth in the
[5844.719s] history of humankind so uh okay Jesse
[5848.679s] James question on TMO as you think
[5851.04s] healthcare would
[5852.4s] recover uh would someone do well buying
[5854.92s] some more high quality life SS like
[5857.199s] thermofisher uh uh I think thermofisher
[5861.08s] is historically pretty good
[5865.04s] business
[5867.28s] uh so again this is a 15 bagger in 10
[5870.52s] years where were you at $40 why now I
[5873.96s] mean let&#39;s take a look at the
[5876.239s] fundamentals doesn&#39;t mean it can&#39;t be a
[5878.199s] 15 bagger again
[5880.679s] but odds don&#39;t favor it
[5887.32s] um yeah so cash flows have been flat for
[5889.88s] four
[5891.88s] years you know it&#39;s it&#39;s fully valued
[5894.52s] it&#39;s an okay business but I mean this is
[5896.32s] the type of thing that if you&#39;re lucky
[5898.239s] it goes from 5
[5901.0s] 544 maybe to 750 but like if if anything
[5906.28s] goes wrong this thing could fall to 250
[5907.96s] in a minute so
[5910.04s] like
[5911.8s] you&#39;re you&#39;re okay but I just don&#39;t see
[5915.76s] the a I look for asymmetry so for me
[5918.719s] there&#39;s no asymmetry like there&#39;s always
[5921.119s] the risk of what you don&#39;t know that you
[5922.76s] don&#39;t know in a stock so a business that
[5925.0s] I&#39;m going to get like a 20 30% return
[5927.48s] and I and I have a possibility of
[5929.679s] there&#39;s something out there lurking that
[5931.08s] I don&#39;t know that I don&#39;t I&#39;m not
[5932.32s] interested in like I have to get paid
[5934.36s] double triple quadruple Plus for me to
[5937.119s] take any risk with capital and then I
[5939.4s] have to know my downside is totally
[5941.76s] protected so solvency risk comes first
[5944.239s] then cash flow then Revenue then
[5946.96s] understanding the cyclicality then
[5948.8s] understanding the management then
[5950.679s] understanding the the the durable Mo the
[5952.639s] durability of the moat uh so for me to
[5955.08s] do all that work I got to get paid baby
[5957.239s] and and it&#39;s got to be a double triple
[5958.92s] so for these type of
[5961.119s] things it&#39;s it&#39;s uh it&#39;s not interesting
[5964.0s] to me but thank you for sending in a
[5965.4s] great question uh J JM Smith take a look
[5970.0s] at
[5970.88s] ew yeah we keep looking at ew every week
[5974.44s] um ew is
[5976.28s] fine uh but
[5982.159s] again show me how the cash flow is going
[5984.599s] to recover because it&#39;s absolutely
[5986.239s] collapsed so
[6005.52s] this probably will recover I I just
[6014.679s] uh it&#39;s worth doing work on for sure
[6018.4s] it&#39;s it&#39;s it&#39;s an okay call it&#39;s an okay
[6021.04s] call but you got to do your work and
[6022.52s] really understand how durable are their
[6026.119s] products I I I think it&#39;s a pretty solid
[6028.96s] compounder over time but for me it&#39;s
[6031.8s] it&#39;s a
[6034.0s] not I don&#39;t have any urgency to do a lot
[6036.76s] of work on this one I&#39;ll just leave it
[6038.119s] at that but it&#39;s interesting so I think
[6041.88s] your framework is
[6043.679s] good uh you just need to get some
[6046.159s] confidence in how they&#39;re going to turn
[6047.599s] around the free cash flow story and if
[6049.199s] you can get it towards that inflection
[6052.28s] you know you might have a over 3 to 5
[6054.159s] years on this but more likely 50 to 75%
[6056.88s] which doesn&#39;t really pass my IR
[6059.8s] hurdle
[6063.44s] um Dan
[6066.52s] Abasi thanks for sharing your knowledge
[6068.52s] could you take a look at
[6072.92s] wns
[6074.92s] Holdings okay so this thing is
[6077.4s] haved what do they do
[6088.599s] cash flow has been flat for five
[6092.48s] years stock price is basically trading
[6095.199s] where it was five years ago no
[6099.48s] shocker gross
[6109.76s] margins let&#39;s take a look here first off
[6114.44s] what do they
[6117.96s] do voice analytical business
[6120.56s] transformation Services
[6124.36s] worldwide package
[6128.599s] good such as customer service analytics
[6132.84s] Human Resources outsourc I they do like
[6135.04s] 80 different things I can&#39;t even
[6136.76s] understand this so if you can actually
[6138.52s] figure out what the hell they do and how
[6141.639s] they&#39;re going to get this thing to
[6144.32s] uh re accelerate growth then I&#39;m
[6146.76s] interested just on the basis of what I&#39;m
[6149.119s] seeing uh it&#39;s not motivating me to do
[6151.56s] any further work on it to be honest with
[6153.28s] you so um it does look like a good trade
[6157.4s] but
[6159.239s] uh I&#39;m not that interested thank
[6162.8s] uh reload the
[6166.48s] page let me just see here
[6174.56s] balance
[6177.119s] sheet get this a little
[6189.679s] smaller
[6196.599s] okay that didn&#39;t help okay let&#39;s see
[6200.28s] here
[6205.8s] 240
[6207.36s] liabilities 102 that&#39;s fine income
[6213.36s] statement income is growing what&#39;s
[6215.96s] happening
[6216.7s] [Music]
[6218.199s] to share
[6226.96s] count see share counts okay
[6235.159s] let&#39;s see what&#39;s happening in the
[6240.44s] margins it&#39;s holding up
[6245.48s] I do a little more work uh I would say
[6253.92s] that you have to
[6256.639s] understand why is it
[6260.96s] down and what is the plan
[6265.159s] and to get cash flow growing again make
[6269.239s] cash flow great again they&#39;ve not been
[6270.88s] doing that so what&#39;s the plan that&#39;s the
[6273.32s] name of the game
[6275.96s] Oleg Shak
[6279.0s] shakarov thoughts on Nike we&#39;ve covered
[6281.32s] this every week it&#39;s fine we like VF
[6284.119s] better be for the same reason because
[6286.28s] it&#39;s not an easy double uh like many of
[6289.48s] the other things that were in uh you&#39;ll
[6291.44s] just get a decent trade for a lot of
[6292.84s] risk
[6293.639s] R uh don&#39;t don&#39;t understand why you pick
[6297.56s] CCI over AMT because again Miriam I&#39;m
[6301.199s] not in things for 30 40% returns I&#39;m in
[6304.36s] things for double minimum and you&#39;re not
[6306.36s] going to get that from the quote highest
[6308.119s] quality business that&#39;s already fully
[6310.239s] priced uh when the we&#39;re looking for
[6314.639s] leverage without taking leverage so that
[6317.28s] when we when when the sector when
[6319.639s] everything turns we get the most bang
[6321.199s] for our buck and we get Asm not an
[6324.08s] incremental return to something that&#39;s
[6325.84s] fully valued because everyone already
[6327.28s] knows it&#39;s the best business in the
[6328.8s] group you know Advanced Auto Parts is
[6330.96s] the shittiest Auto retailer we know that
[6333.48s] we&#39;re not blind but it&#39;s the only one
[6336.239s] that the last four times it had 630
[6338.96s] million doll of operating income it
[6340.679s] traded between $180 and
[6342.96s] $220 uh um and that&#39;s Management&#39;s
[6345.92s] Target New Management Catalyst Target uh
[6349.28s] for
[6350.56s] 2027 and the stock $45 so um that&#39;s that
[6356.199s] okay uh Mr Hayes I know main focus is
[6358.639s] China for emerging markets but what are
[6360.04s] your thoughts outlook on
[6362.159s] Mexico uh not for me I mean maybe I&#39;d
[6365.36s] buy Walmart Mexico or something I
[6366.88s] haven&#39;t even looked at it but no too
[6368.96s] much turbulence Trump is going to be
[6370.48s] like bashing them every day for paying
[6372.679s] for the wall taking the wall down I I
[6375.0s] have no idea but it&#39;s not going to be
[6376.96s] fun for Mexico but I do think Mexico&#39;s
[6379.36s] demographics business everything is
[6381.639s] great um
[6385.52s] I just don&#39;t really want to invest there
[6386.96s] Griffin Brown I just graduated as a
[6389.719s] public investor as a private investor
[6391.36s] you know would I want to set up a
[6392.88s] factory there yeah but I&#39;m not a private
[6394.199s] investor it&#39;s not what I do uh I just
[6396.52s] graduate
[6406.159s] college I this is like a five-page
[6408.84s] question uh how do you feel about Nike
[6410.8s] the same way I feel every week it&#39;s good
[6412.4s] not great it&#39;s going to work but not as
[6414.199s] much as some of our others uh thank you
[6416.119s] for the question Griffin Brown uh okay
[6419.08s] so thank you for that
[6420.639s] Griffin good stuff all right moving
[6426.679s] along Daniel
[6433.08s] Borman uh Daniel we cover TLT and bonds
[6437.599s] for like an hour every single week for
[6439.719s] the last three months so go back to that
[6442.88s] look at the commitment to Trader stuff
[6444.32s] we talk about look at the cycle stuff
[6446.48s] that we talk about look at the
[6448.56s] positioning stuff that we talk about uh
[6451.52s] and you will realize why we have that
[6453.88s] view also in terms of Baba what do you
[6456.4s] think of
[6457.599s] JD uh I like Baba I like Baba better
[6461.4s] than JD because Baba has the number one
[6463.28s] AI business if you want to own a piece
[6465.0s] of every single AI startup in China you
[6467.639s] want to own Alibaba if you want to
[6470.36s] benefit from AI apps and computer demand
[6473.4s] going exponential you want the number
[6475.08s] one cloud provider Baba if you want to
[6476.8s] benefit on a recovery of a middle class
[6478.719s] you bet on Baba uh Tollgate for all
[6482.52s] consumption you bet on Baba JD you only
[6484.84s] get one of those so uh if I have if I&#39;m
[6487.96s] a poker player which I am you want outs
[6490.88s] and um with Baba you get the most outs
[6494.04s] if one thing doesn&#39;t work as well
[6495.28s] there&#39;s like huge opportunities
[6496.88s] International is growing at 30 plus%
[6499.119s] it&#39;s priced it like it&#39;s like it doesn&#39;t
[6501.119s] even exist so uh that&#39;s why I don&#39;t want
[6504.0s] JD or if I had to pick one or the other
[6506.599s] I mean you could buy Bas you could buy
[6507.88s] JD also it&#39;s probably fine but
[6512.32s] um Dak
[6515.239s] Brown notice you don&#39;t have any ads on
[6517.8s] your podcast because that&#39;s not what I
[6519.44s] do um all right Lucas
[6522.76s] Treno been listening a year and love
[6525.28s] what you do found three
[6530.48s] stocks all right Lucas I yeah there&#39;s no
[6533.159s] question there thanks Molly mcneel are
[6535.96s] there any
[6537.599s] places okay got that Jimmy
[6543.239s] Jones could you look at s swbi
[6551.119s] again Smith and Wesson
[6587.84s] I mean the best I gota be honest with
[6590.04s] you if you look at history the best time
[6591.8s] to buy these these gun companies is when
[6594.44s] a Democrat gets elected because everyone
[6596.0s] fears that their guns are going to get
[6597.239s] taken away if you look at the Obama
[6598.8s] Administration the thing went up 20x or
[6601.52s] whatever it was less than 20x it was
[6604.199s] like whatever
[6606.36s] 15x uh then under Biden again 10x so I
[6611.28s] you know no one&#39;s worried that Trump&#39;s
[6612.56s] going to take away their guns so they&#39;re
[6613.88s] not rushing to the stores negative free
[6615.56s] cash they&#39;re probably going to recover
[6617.119s] they haven&#39;t recovered
[6620.159s] yet uh
[6623.08s] I&#39;m still not interested Jimmy but it
[6626.04s] could work as a trade
[6669.48s] saber
[6675.32s] Corp oh yeah this is the software I had
[6678.56s] some guys pitch me on the private
[6679.92s] version of this and they spent an hour
[6681.4s] on the phone telling me why SA was going
[6683.119s] bankrupt or going out of business I I
[6685.88s] kind of liked it when they were pitching
[6687.119s] me on investing in their private deal uh
[6689.84s] does look like they&#39;re recovering but
[6691.96s] you know this is a lowquality business
[6693.88s] and if 10% of what they said is
[6696.88s] true
[6699.04s] um I don&#39;t really I&#39;m not that
[6701.4s] interested but I but they did get me
[6703.4s] interested more in investing in saber
[6705.239s] than they did in investing in their
[6706.639s] thing so uh they do I think they do like
[6709.0s] software for airline stuff let me just
[6710.88s] see
[6725.639s] yeah for the travel industry uh let&#39;s
[6728.119s] just take a look and see if anything&#39;s
[6730.239s] changed yeah I mean this is just this is
[6733.4s] digging into trash bin let me let me
[6735.44s] just double check here
[6760.719s] financials yeah looks like their
[6762.44s] revenues are recovering a little bit
[6763.92s] with the industry
[6773.76s] free cash flows probably going to turn
[6776.8s] positive see what their balance sheet
[6779.56s] looks
[6782.56s] like good amount of
[6785.84s] cash and oh $5 billion of debt that&#39;s
[6789.679s] not
[6792.76s] ideal and then
[6796.76s] uh see what they&#39;ve done yeah they&#39;ve
[6799.28s] they&#39;ve just diluted the hell out of
[6801.36s] their shareholders I I don&#39;t like these
[6803.719s] type of people I mean anyone that
[6805.56s] destroys their shareholders like that
[6807.0s] I&#39;m not interested
[6808.44s] in
[6810.239s] um okay new CEO but that&#39;s April of
[6815.04s] 2023 margins seem to be
[6817.599s] improving lot of Insider buying all
[6819.92s] right maybe maybe I mean I like your
[6821.92s] thinking for me I don&#39;t need to I like
[6825.0s] to sleep well at night that&#39;s not one
[6826.96s] that&#39;s not a way to do it uh got that sh
[6832.76s] thoughts on Petra Bross we&#39;ve covered
[6834.159s] this a million times not for me 21%
[6836.679s] dividend all you need is that socialist
[6838.199s] to wake up and cut the dividend I mean
[6840.28s] no
[6841.639s] way um Jason
[6844.599s] Zen Sebastian
[6848.28s] p uh
[6866.88s] National Retail properties
[6870.88s] n that&#39;s not for
[6874.96s] me and no there are not other reats I
[6877.52s] really want to look at other
[6880.0s] than crown castle right
[6882.639s] now I it&#39;s probably okay but it&#39;s pulled
[6885.119s] back like two cents so now you&#39;re
[6886.92s] excited with the 10% pullback
[6889.28s] it&#39;s there&#39;s no asymmetry there I&#39;m not
[6891.719s] interested I don&#39;t buy things for
[6893.84s] dividends um craft
[6898.96s] hind I think it&#39;s
[6902.199s] okay I think a bunch of these like Pepsi
[6905.36s] and uh Hershey and they&#39;re going to do
[6909.48s] probably a bit better this
[6917.88s] year I wouldn&#39;t be a buyer of Pepsi but
[6921.599s] yeah these things haven&#39;t come in enough
[6923.239s] so um that one&#39;s probably okay I took a
[6926.4s] brief look at it this week
[6934.8s] again uh what are your thoughts about
[6936.639s] macroeconomic challenges in Brazil also
[6938.48s] Latin America as a whole I&#39;m not ready
[6939.88s] to do anything in either of those
[6941.04s] markets the a imetry is better in China
[6943.079s] because the worst case is already in in
[6944.719s] China whereas those places it could get
[6946.96s] worse before it gets better but I think
[6948.92s] all Emerging Markets are going to work I
[6950.52s] just don&#39;t have any pound the table
[6952.44s] companies that are priced with the
[6954.239s] asymmetry I need to take the risk of $1
[6957.28s] uh and get many dollars back and I&#39;m
[6958.96s] just not finding them to the level of
[6960.599s] comfort that I want there are beat up
[6962.4s] things I could buy but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
[6963.88s] have comfort you know it&#39;s taking
[6965.96s] country risk geopolitical risk company
[6968.36s] risk all of that stuff so you have to
[6970.8s] buy the highest quality and I&#39;m not
[6971.96s] finding the highest quality at levels
[6973.32s] that I want them so for now it&#39;s a pass
[6976.0s] but I&#39;m finding it all day long uh with
[6978.04s] Alibaba so that&#39;s where it is for today
[6980.56s] we&#39;ll be back next week same time same
[6982.52s] place in the meantime make it a great
[6984.28s] one bye for now
