# Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes – Episode Not applicable
### January 2025

**Executive Summary**
> Tom Hayes is extremely bullish on value stocks, small caps, international equities, healthcare (XBI), materials, Comstock Resources (CTO), Generac (GNRC), Boeing (BA), Etsy (ETSY), and Alibaba (BABA). He believes the market is in a regime change where value will outperform growth, and that the post-inauguration period will be ripe for a significant rally in these undervalued sectors. He is cautious on the Magnificent Seven, believing their earnings growth is decelerating and their multiples are too high. He emphasizes the importance of buying stocks with a margin of safety and a clear turnaround story.

**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Bullish on specific sectors and stocks, cautious on indices and growth stocks. → 9/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆

- Value stocks are historically cheap relative to growth.
- Small caps are poised for earnings growth acceleration.
- International equities offer better value than US equities.
- Post-inauguration period typically sees a rally.
- Market is in a regime change favoring value.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is undergoing a regime change where value will outperform growth after a decade of growth dominance due to zero interest rate policies. The post-inauguration period will see yields compress and a rally in undervalued sectors. International and emerging markets are poised to outperform the US. A weaker labor market will keep the Fed in the game, supporting equities.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Small Speculators Short Natural Gas | First time since 2001 | Super exciting, indicating a potential breakout in natural gas. |
| Corporate Net Interest Payments | Near record lows | Not what you see at recession time, indicating economic strength. |
| US vs International Earnings Growth | International 13% vs US 14% | International offers better value at lower multiples. |
| Automotive Sales | 16.8 million annualized SAR in December | Super exciting news, indicating a strong recovery in the auto sector. |
| Euro Short Positions | All leveraged funds are short the Euro | The Euro is going to absolutely rip higher. |

## Featured Company Deep Dives
### GNRC – High Conviction
Generac is poised for significant growth due to increasing grid instability, AI-driven demand for power, and a low penetration rate of home standby generators. The company is experiencing accelerating free cash flows and is dominating the residential, commercial, and industrial markets.

**Key Metrics:**
- Sales recovering
- Margins recovering
- Free cash flow off the charts
- US penetration rate only 6.25%

**Valuation / Target:** Getting back to $200 and beyond is easy peasy.  Previous high was $524.
**Action:** Buy
