  "cleaned_transcript": "### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nWe got a lot to cover today.\n\nfinally  broke 80 for the first time. I hit goal one, but as you can see, I got a long way to go with the index to get down to a 99. I'm at a 104. It's going to take a lot more than one lucky round. Uh, that was a grind. I almost blew it on the on the 18th hole, by the way. I thought I put it in the water. It was six yards short. Uh driver, sixiron, 56, two putt, uh par five over the water. Super excited. 39 on the front, easy peasy. 40 on the back. Works for every single shot. Uh but I got it done. So, uh we'll see if I can get the second part of the goal before officially playing golf.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nLot of earnings noise this week. Tremendous amount of companies earnings. Some shot up and then reversed and then some shot down and then reversed higher, etc., etc. Short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. And what I wanted to do with all the noise is just kind of step back and take a look at the companies that have reported that we've talked about on this podcast and own some for clients. And personally, uh, Albamaro crushed it. Stock shot all the way up close to, you know, 90 and change, reversed a little bit, but if you zoom out, you can see it's starting its recovery and we are in the nent stages. So any weakness can be bought. Uh we'll be going through these uh this week. I think we're doing Intel and PayPal. We we can't do 10 companies in one call. We'll be here until the cows come home. Uh but if there's something urgent to talk about, I would uh Boeing again shot up. This thing has moved a lot. 135 to 230 in about, you know, four, five, six weeks. I think it's, you know, we we we told you a couple weeks back we took profits on all of our options which were up huge. Um and we've shaved a little bit of stock. Uh that's just to just because there are companies that haven't moved 100% that we wanted to get more of this week. Uh so we did a little just a tad of harvesting there, but um I could see us buying it back if it pulls back below 200. um but or just riding the rest of it and being perfectly happy because it's still a very sizable position. Baxter uh appears like it, you know, for lack of a better word, the bed. Uh not the case. That was what we call a kitchen sink quarter to clear the deck for the new CEO of uh Baxter who's coming in and we've covered many times in the podcast. This guy's a winner. Sevenbagger in his last company. He's going to turn this thing around. This is going to be easy peasy. this they they the deck is cleared with the spin-off with the right downs with everything else. Revenues are stable. This thing's going to be three, four, 5x. It's just going to be a matter of time. And now we got the right guy in doing it. I know everyone's running for cover. I'm telling you, I have never been so busy in the market in one day in probably since early April uh when the um uh liberation day when we were just buying everything under the sun in the whole. Well, today was one of those days between buying the out of uh Baxter, buying the out of VFC Corp, Intel. Um it was Christmas today and uh let's see. Back VF Corp, Intel, No. Uh National Oil Well, Varco. I mean, they were just giving stuff away today and we were like, \"Thank you very much.\" And what's so amazing is like you look on a daily, you're like, \"Oh, are these going to be okay?\" And then you look at the numbers, you're like, \"Of course they're going to be okay.\" And then you zoom out, which is what we do here and what we teach, and you look at the album. We even bought some album for a few clients that had a high higher basis. Um, trimmed some Boeing. Uh, actually trimmed a hair, a small hair of Generrack just to raise some cash because that's also run up huge from uh the low 100s to almost 200 in a few weeks. So, that's probably going to breathe. It's had two, three monster days here following earnings. Um, so but backter like this is what it does when it's flushing out where there's 2009 to 2011 uh 2001 to 2003 you get this initial down and then you get this rollover waterfall where everyone says it's over and then it just works its way back to new highs. Uh Crown Castle um that spiked up on earnings now it's resting a little bit. You could see the recovery is just beginning there. Uh, Cooper Standard. By the way, I thought today we were only allowed to get bad news until after hours when they took guidance up and the stock shot up to $29. We'll see if we get some follow through. It's broke into new highs there. Um, 2673 was the high after last earnings and um when he came on to our podcast um so now it's at new highs, highest levels since back in 2021. and next stop to take out is $48. So, uh, so let's see how that earnings call goes and the follow through and everything else uh going on. Comtock again, huge move from $7 to $30. Of course, it's going to retrace back to 17. Uh, we almost\nbought some today, but I think we' we'd like to see it get lower. If we could get it down to 15 again, we'd we'd load back up the truck for people that don't have enough. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nEtsy, great earnings. Stock shot up. So what happened is Powell again had to do Powell be his belligerent useless Fed chair self uh and um basically have a very hawkish meeting. So what you saw in the last two days is cyclicals which have been crushing it since the April bottom um got smacked uh yesterday because basically the policy that he was signaling implied that he's going to crash the economy because he's uh wants to stay restrictive and that's why you saw tech get bid they'll do better in a deflationary um uh higher unemployment environment, which is the policy path that he was signaling yesterday. It won't be executed because Trump is going to announce a shadow Fed and Powell is going to become a lame duck. I wouldn't actually be surprised if um they do wind up firing him because at, you know, $600 billion of unnecessary interest costs, uh it's reckless. It's bad for the taxpayers. It's bad for housing. It's bad for employment. You're seeing weak employment. this guy's got his head up his ass and he needs to go. So, um, so that's that. But again, one one Fed meeting, it makes zero difference to the recovery of these companies. It makes a big difference for the price movement, the short-term emotional voting machine over a few days after his meeting. But, as always, the first move is usually the wrong move. expect Trump to ratchet up the pressure and uh at the end of the day, love him or hate him, Trump always wins. This guy's going to be toast. Uh what he did yesterday was a step above being quote unquote data dependent. What he did was a big FU to the president and um uh that old that old dog don't hunt. That's not going to last very long. And you're going to see that ratchet up very very quickly as he as more and more public figures come out and belittle him and they start to put the dissenters on a pedestal and they start to get the spotlight and completely undermine Powell's belligerance. So, um, next week I'll tell you how I really feel about the meeting yesterday, but this week, uh, let's stick to the facts, which is Etsy, uh, again, just starting the recovery, shot up after earnings, retraced after Powell. Uh, that will all go away. Generrack huge move up here back to the highs that we saw earlier when we didn't take profits and it went back down to 99. This thing's going a lot higher, but we did trim. We we took a huge amount of options profits. We had some spreads that were up double double and a half. Uh we had uh some straight options that were up a lot uh and a few shares. But uh this is still a core position for us and we think it's going to ride a lot a lot higher. You can see this is just starting to recover. But we wanted some cash to buy the things that are down. Uh we bought some Intel of course we'll talk about today. again it's just in this bottoming process just like it did in 2009 just like it did in 2002 people are getting up in arms and we are buying the stock uh national oil well Varco same story you know you start to see the recovery then you get this bottoming fake out process and then you go straight up so this is just a fake out here we bought a ton more today uh PayPal same story this recovery is just starting another fake out here. Uh we'll go through those earnings. Stanley Black & Decker again, people bitching about that. This recovery is just starting. Same story. Complete flush out, little uncertainty, and then straight back to new highs. This time will be no different. I think the catalyst for that one is just Powell either needs to be undermined or needs to be removed. One of those two things is imminent. Um BF Corp, uh Bracken, unbelievable earnings. The stock shot up to $15. Then you had Powell open his big mouth and all the cyclicals got hit. So, uh, this was down. But, uh, Bracken did an amazing interview with Jim Kramer, which we're going to listen to in just a little bit, and he laid out the whole case. By the way, the one thing he said at the end is the most important thing he said of the whole thing. He's personally purchased over $3 million of stock. Uh which is kind of a rounding error compared to what we have, but um uh it's nice to see that's money he pulled out of his own pocket buying in the hole. We love that. This is the same type of bottoming process you saw in 20201, 2009, 2010. It's a cyclical thing. That's what these businesses do. And uh back off to the races. So this was a gift. Mana from Heaven, buying it till our fingers fell off today. And uh super excited and we had to raise the cash. You know, we we we have uh limits on um what we want to do and things that are doubles in, you know, two 3 months. They're they're going to take a breather. We use some cash. We'll probably buy some of that back, but but to not buy more at these levels, uh for the Stanley's, for the VF Corps, for the Intels, uh for the Baxters, for the Varcos, uh these gifts, these are kind of the last stop on the bus before you rock it to the moon. And uh we didn't want to miss it. So that's that. Uh the big story with Cooper to obviously next week, we'll be going into this very strongly. uh they took North American production guidance down. That's just numbers that they get from the industry rags. I think those are going to be too low. But despite taking production numbers way down uh to 14.9 million from industry, they were able to take adjusted Ibida up from their initial guidance midpoint of 217 a.5 all the way up to 235 midpoint. So almost another $20 million of IBIDA more than they expected. Uh and that's why I think you're seeing the stock up over 29. Would love to see it get a three handle in front in the next week. That would be amazing. VF Corp jumps after earnings beat as turnaround takes hold. Uh that was the case until Powell came out and shot his mouth off unnecessarily, but it's immaterial. I'm going to be sending him a Christmas card along with Xihinping. Uh thanking him for allowing us to get more VF Corp. Um that one will be a detailed one next week. So Jeff, we're doing um CPS, VFC, and probably Etsy next week. Generrack we don't have to cover because it went up. Uh oh no you need to do backs. So probably backter VF court CPS next. Um\n\nthe hole. We love that. This is the same type of bottoming process you saw in 20201, 2009, 2010. It's a cyclical thing. That's what these businesses do. And uh back off to the races. So this was a gift. Mana from Heaven, buying it till our fingers fell off today. And uh super excited and we had to raise the cash. You know, we we we have uh limits on um what we want to do and things that are doubles in, you know, two 3 months. They're they're going to take a breather. We use some cash. We'll probably buy some of that back, but but to not buy more at these levels, uh for the Stanley's, for the VF Corps, for the Intels, uh for the Baxters, for the Varcos, uh these gifts, these are kind of the last stop on the bus before you rock it to the moon. And uh we didn't want to miss it. So that's that's what we did. Uh the big story with Cooper to obviously next week, we'll be going into this very strongly. uh they took North American production guidance down. That's just numbers that they get from the industry rags. I think those are going to be too low. But despite taking production numbers way down uh to 14.9 million from industry, they were able to take adjusted Ibida up from their initial guidance midpoint of 217 a.5 all the way up to 235 midpoint. So almost another $20 million of IBIDA more than they expected. Uh and that's why I think you're seeing the stock up over 29. Would love to see it get a three handle in front in the next week. That would be amazing. VF Corp jumps after earnings beat as turnaround takes hold. Uh that was the case until Powell came out and shot his mouth off unnecessarily, but it's immaterial. I'm going to be sending him a Christmas card along with Xihinping. Uh thanking him for allowing us to get more VF Corp. Um that one will be a detailed one next week. So Jeff, we're doing um CPS, VFC, and probably Etsy next week. Generrack we don't have to cover because it went up. Uh oh no you need to do backs. So probably backter VF court CPS next. ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  the interview of Brack and Daryl talks quarterly results with Jim Kramer on CNBC. >> Has VF Corp\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nHas VF Corp finally gotten its groove back? This program apparel company, you know, is maybe Vans or Northace. Timberland report a magnificent quarter this morning. The stocks at least shot up 3% today, though was up much more than earlier. Here's a stock that's been a real dog for a long time, frankly. But two years ago, the board brought in Bracken Daryl, formerly the CEO of Logitech, to turn things around. And now it looks like he's starting to pull it off. Earlier today, we spoke with Bracken Daryl, the president CEO of VF Corp. We are going to go over what I think is one of the most controversial stories that shouldn't be. It shouldn't be because we have Bracken Daryl who's in charge of it. So, it's only just a matter of time.\n\nSo I'm going to ask you, can Vans be turned around in the next year? >> You know, Vans is going to be turned around and it's I'm not giving you exact time frame, but Vans is absolutely going to be turned around. We've got green shoes at the very top. You know, we've got at this year's uh this year's Paris Fashion Week was just last month, there were probably more skatike shoes there than than have been in a decade. And and you know, these these trends start at the top. So, there's really good luxury trends in our stores. We're we're overpopulating with premium product. The Oxford Street store in London, the Fifth Avenue store in New York. So, I see the green shoots, too, and it's and it feels good. >> Well, let me just ask you, uh, why has it been so hard? What happened to make what I regard as being a premium exciting brand into a brand that's really seemed to be even for you a not easy turn? You know, there are three things that really happened there. First, we the innovation pipeline got very stale. they just didn't launch new products. And then the second thing was they really overextended into value doors with those same shoes that were going very very broad. They look the same, we're the same. So we just overdid it with with a couple of styles and then the marketing got stale. So So those three things though we were really reversing engines. So it's taken longer because we've had to really reset the distribution. So we've pulled back on value doors. We've reduced the scope of what we're selling in there. We've reduced our own number of doors by about almost 20%. Um and and you know the the net effect of all that is it's just a it's a slower turn in this industry. It takes time to get new products out. So we've got a great team though, a super leader and we're we're going to be a machine rolling out new products over the over the next year and year and a half.\n\nIn the interim it is very telling that Northace remains not only a premium brand but one that has gotten very exciting again. It never lost it in Europe. I think the people in Europe are just always very exciting about it. But United States which has been of course an obviously important market seems to have caught fire. So give us a sense of where Northace is now. >> You know Northace is as you said it's always been a terrific brand. It really stands for exploration. You know that's appealing to everybody. What we're doing now is we're we're continuing to innovate in the core business but we're also bringing out more and more footwear. our bags and packs business which is one of the oldest part. Both those segments of the business grew to over 20% globally and we're we're just going to keep pouring it on and we've got so many opportunities in just bringing out more product for the spring and summer as we go into next spring and summer. So there's a lot of opportunity on Northace globally. >> All right. Now, uh Timberland, it seems very exciting. A 9% growth. This is a brand that we remember as being fantastic. Then it got small. Can it get big again? >> I think so. Oh, I mean, I think really Timberland is is one of our one of those brands for us that is the brand itself is so much bigger than the business, you know, and and the the potential, you know, we've really caught fire on the yellow boot, as you said, but we've also got really clear signs that the boat shoe, remember those boat shoes that we used to wear when we were kids? Those are starting to pick up steam again, especially in Europe and even here in the US. And we're really working hard to fuel both those engines and then bring on more and more new products and more and more apparel. So, we've got a lot of opportunities in Timberland, too.\n\nI always feel old when I do that, but Altra people are I thought it was like a I thought it was like a cigarette. Altra is a hot shoe. >> It's about as far from the cigarette as you can get. It's It's the best trail running shoe you can buy. It's the biggest actually in trail running. We're tied for number one in trail running. We're also moving up fast. the fastest growing of the top eight shoes in or eight eight brands in road running, believe it or not. And it's gone from about, you know, $60 million we bought it to about 250 this year. Should be 250 or 250 plus this year. So, it's really on fire. It's a great shoe. Has a unique point of difference. This wide toe box that's really healthier for your foot. So, the people get in it are hooked. And here's the really unbelievable thing. It's a $250 million business at run rate with less than 10% awareness in the US. And probably that's aided awareness meaning have you ever heard of Altra? And so people like you like 90% of people like and and outside the US it's even smaller. So we can scale this business.\n\n>> I think so. Oh, I mean, I think really Timberland is is one of our one of those brands for us that is the brand itself is so much bigger than the business, you know, and and the the potential, you know, we've really caught fire on the yellow boot, as you said, but we've also got really clear signs that the boat shoe, remember those boat shoes that we used to wear when we were kids? Those are starting to pick up steam again, especially in Europe and even here in the US. And we're really working hard to fuel both those engines and then bring on more and more new products and more and more apparel. So, we've got a lot of opportunities in Timberland, too. >> Right now, I had to ask around the the office. I always feel old when I do that, but Altra people are I thought it was like a I thought it was like a cigarette. Altra is a hot shoe. >> It's about as far from the cigarette as you can get. It's It's the best trail running shoe you can buy. It's the biggest actually in trail running. We're tied for number one in trail running. We're also moving up fast. the fastest growing of the top eight shoes in or eight eight brands in road running, believe it or not. And it's gone from about, you know, $60 million we bought it to about 250 this year. Should be 250 or 250 plus this year. So, it's really on fire. It's a great shoe. Has a unique point of difference. This wide toe box that's really healthier for your foot. So, the people get in it are hooked. And here's the really unbelievable thing. It's a $250 million business at run rate with less than 10% awareness in the US. And probably that's aided awareness meaning have you ever heard of Altra? And so people like you like 90% of people like and and outside the US it's even smaller. So we can scale this business. >> All right. That's important because I'd love to see without having to spend more money. I don't want you to buy anything till you get your balance sheet where you want it. But that's very exciting. Now now t\n\n look, look, I think uh we don't have to be carart. We have to be we have to be the best Dickies we can possibly be. We haven't the last few years. Now the the trends on there are improving too. So the the there was a a turnaround to do there and it's it really dampened this quarter got in the single digits and I'm really optimistic about that business too. I've got a fantastic team there led by a super guy Chris goal out of GAP and he's brought in some just a superstar team there. So just like Sune at at uh Advance and Caroline Brown and Nina Flood I've got four really great big brand leaders now. >> All right. And then last thing and I know that you're dealing with the tariffs. you've been able to mitigate some, not all. Uh, how life-threatening is a tariff to VF court? >> Look, you know, the tariffs are are the great thing about the tariffs is that they tr they they treat everybody equally in our industry. Just everybody's kind of in the same boat. So, in an environment like that, we can deal with it. So, we're taking cost out, relocating factories, and we're raising prices. And we will manage it all as we go into 27. We'll manage it all. So that during 27 we'll offset all the tariffs between those three mechanisms. So it's not life-threatening. We will manage it. >> Well, if if you had to raise price is is the consumer strong enough to be able to take price. >> I think so. You know, we're going to do it very strategically. You know, and as I said, the good thing is you when you're looking at alternatives, you know, if everybody's raising price, and I suspect they will be in our industry because everybody's going to have the same cost increase, then it prices will go up. And then it comes back to let the best brands win. And we believe we have great brands. >> Well, I think your situation is Oh, God. I want to own the stock myself. Not allowed to, but I think it's really time for Brack and Daryl, president CEO of VFO. Brack, I love when you're on the show. Thanks very much. Thank you so much. >> Hey, Jim. I just have to say, you know, I now bought on my own. I've taken $3 million of my own money, one by one by one, and bought stock myself. So, I'm obviously more than just a believer. I'm I'm personally invested beyond what you normally get as a CEO. I like a CEO's all in with his own money rather than just having the shareholders give it to him just because it's much more real that way. Thank you, Bracken. Great to see you again. >> Thank you. >> That's Bracken Daryl, president CEO of VF Corp. And we're back. Uh then Baxter, as you can see here, complete kitchen sink quarter setting the table for the new CEO. We'll cover that one in detail next week. We were buyers today. You'll probably get another couple of days where you can buy the stock. Uh Andrew hitters coming in huge home run. Uh Seven Bagger Plus in his past thing healthc care business and uh this time will be no different. So we're excited about that. Generrack shot the lights out. Fantastic job. Res's crushing it. We'll cover that in detail. Now on to D. Now on to some data. After pandemic lull, Disney's operating profit is growing once again, poised to hit new highs. Most shorted stocks are beating the S&P 500. So short and small was the theme up till yesterday when Powell um came out aggressively hawkish as an FU to the president. Um I can assure you he will not be the one to have the last word. Uh and this trend is going to continue. But the outperformance of small and shorted was 11 percentage points greater than uh the S&P 500 i.e. mag 7 over that period. And uh I think the short-term interruption from yesterday is going to quickly resolve itself back to back to trend. Uh China's augmented budget deficit widens. They're they're stimulating. Here's some uh sellside stuff on Varco maintaining their price target at $20. Uh after earnings, GenerRack uh raising their price target to 210 opinion follows trend. Boeing raised the price target to $250. Uh Varco again different firm $190. QXO opinion follows trend target up to $33. uh Intel ref recovery roadmap roadmap taking shape uh we'll cover that one VF corp uh upside as return to topline growth comes into focus uh comtock uh here's UBS putting a sell on it of course the all the eur European banks are always the most bearish uh Varco they took it to $18 not concerned this is a cyclical play when it goes it gallops just like comtock Just like range. I love this is um gosh, do we have that mammoth cycle? Let's see. Mammoth stock market cycle. This is where we are on a lot of the names. is right here. So, we've gone through a lot of this on these names and now you get into a version where you get this final check back before you get to denial and it would break out. We're we're here right now on Cooper Standard. Okay, so we had that shoot up collapse. Now we're here and now we're breaking through. This is going to return in confidence. Um, PayPal, we're here. You can see it. Yeah. Take a look at this. PayPal basically right down here. Headed back up to denial and then straight up Baba. Same thing. This is perfect. Actually, if you look at BABA, people are so depressed about this. You can't even see the move in the last few weeks. So, you had all this there. Then you go up. Then you test it. You're right here. You're literally right here in denial. It's breaking out above this right here in denial. And then you're going to get returning confidence is where you get the parabolic move. They're all basically there. PayPal. Um, Baxter is probably down here somewhere. Baxter's right here. Max discouragement. Uh, let's take a look here. Generrack. [Music] It's going to be a longer call than I thought. Oh, this is perfect. Look at this. Look at this Generrack. It's just retesting that. It's right here. It's literally right here. So, this is what we're going to get is that this little pullback will probably reload before a next parabolic move. Then you got um VF Corp. Where's VF Corp? VF Corp is probably right down here. Perfect. The spike up and a test down. You're probably right. You might be here. You might be here or you might be here. But either way, I think you're probably here in a version Cooper Standard. [Music] It's just breaking out now. This is pretty amazing. Cooper Standards just breaking out. This is huge. Um I'm excited. Thank God for today. Thank god I was in front of the screens just just ready with my licking my chops and pressing the buy buttons on these that we had one more bite at the apple like the backers in discouragement the Intels's in discouragement the VF corpse in discouragement or aversion um what what else was there today. Dagio, Intel, Varco, Stanley. We bought some Stanley Black & Decker today. Stanley is probably I think it's right here. Let's take a look at Stanley. Boy, this is not how I expected the uh podcast to go today, but I'm having fun doing this. All right. So, you had this recovery and then a final flush and now it's starting to recover final flush. I think you're probably here probably somewhere between aversion and denial on Stanley Black & Decker. All right, so that's that. Let's get back to some data before we take any more tangents. But sometimes the tangents are where the best stuff is. All right. US firms exceed profit estimate estimates at strongest rate in four years. Earnings are going fine. Mainland China's capital inflows into Hong Kong have topped the last year's total. That game is on. They'll get a handshake picture with Trump. Stocks will go crazy. The earnings will support it. Off to the races. Growth in credit card spending. We need to relever the private sector, delever the public sector. Each component of speculating training indicator elevated versus history. Okay. So, we're seeing that this is what we talked about last week. [Music] This was a key point I wanted to cover. The reason I said last week, I said last week, you know, we're growing into a period. We've obviously had a huge move. Uh but I would not expect a big crash of 20%. you're at the most you're going to see during this weak seasonal period of August through October is 5 to 10% pullback to be bought and um and some volatility at the most and I and I wouldn't get too cute with it because there are too many people behind the benchmark that have to buy every single dip that got destroyed in April. Uh and that's why I would stay very constructive. The other reason why is that on average going back a 100red years the market gets a 20% plus uh intraear bare market correction every 4.2 years on average. We have now had three of those in the last 5 years in 2020 in 2022 and in 2025 peaked to trough about 20%. So, we've pulled forward something like 12 years of these uh 20% corrections in a matter of 5 years. Uh I think what you're going to see is a lot of recency bias uh thinking we're going right back to that and idiots on TV calling for a big crash in 2026. Yeah, it's a it's an election year. It tends to be choppy the midterm election years, etc. Fine. If we finish the last fourth quarter super strong, uh, of course you're going to get a pullback in probably February, March, and into the election. But, uh, I don't think we're going to get another 20% correction. We're kind of, uh, overused on that front. Um, I think the five or 10s are going to be perfect and they're going to be bought. Okay. Cyclical sector breath has weakened relative to defensive. Uh, defensives have been given away. defensives are the are the Backaxers of the world, the Diagios of the world, the Crown Castles of the world, um the Hormels of the world. I think those are going to start to get bid. I think people are underestimating those and that they probably get bid in the fall when when you start to see a little chop. AI boom drives largest US grid capacity cost to another record. Again, this is helping the Generax. This is helping the car the comm stocks over the long term. Commodity prices rally in July. Lithium Albamaro. Uh sharp increases in speculative trading typically signal above average short-term equity returns. So you've got um 36 months out. 12 months out you you tend to get another 12%. So that's that's your sweet spot is 12 months out which would make sense. And then you get a little weakness into that election. Chart of the week flows into cyclicals versus defensives. Cyclicals have gone straight up until yesterday's um sermon on the mount. Uh defensives have been left for dead. I think defensives get bid. Cyclicals may have to take a rest after that uh for a few weeks, but um that creates opportunity. Earnings growth expected to pick up in 2025. Uh those are starting to be revised upward. If you remember, we we're through the downgrading uh uh cycle. Technology versus consumer staples. I think you got to have some staples exposure. Whether it's Dagio, whether it's Baxter, whether it's uh um Horell, whether it's, you know, someone mentioned Clorox on the call. Uh these type of stocks. This is tech relative to defensives. I think uh I think this is going to shift pretty soon. uh at least in the short term. Lithium in China surges. So, Albamaro is I mean that that thing is going to just be you you're seeing it start to start to gallop. People can't believe it. It's going to gallop. Uh US firms exceed profit estimates at strongest rate in four years. Uh 46% of companies so far have expressed optimism. That's above average. MSCI China index return by year since 2010. Uh so year to date is is starting to perform. FINRA margin debt over the W Wilshire total market index. Uh this is pretty interesting. Margin debt relative to the index is near all-time lows. Uh similar to what you saw after the tech wreck, which you know implies there's there's again uh room for private sector releveraging and public sector dleveraging. And um the only way to delever the public sector is to run growth hot and run inflation above trend and uh have growth rise faster than interest cost as we've done it before in the past. Uh rally has more room to broaden out. We agree uh it's fits and starts can never take the first two days after Fed meeting serious. And I do think Trump is going to hit him right in the right in the solar plexes and and knock this knock the wind out of him. I think I think yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. There was no reason to be that hawkish. Um, okay. Growth sectors are outperforming, values outperforming in Europe. That's the last few weeks. A little bit of a divergence. Uh, US transmission power outages have become more frequent and grid reliability is worse today than in the early 2000s. You're seeing it in Generax results. average household would need 220% more electricity to go all electric. Online retail spending growth has generally outpaced services and overall retail spending growth throughout 2025. So far, uh relative strength versus the S&P 500 in the last year. Staples have been extremely weak relative to the&p 500. Staples and healthcare, that's where you're going to see some opportunity. Staples healthcare and real estate, I think that's where you're going to see some outperformance in the next 18 months. materials, same thing. Uh utilities, I I wouldn't get too interested in that. Financials, selective, I like uh discretionary, same thing. So, industrials have had a run. Um technologies had a run. So, you know, you've seen it in Generrack, you've seen it in Boeing. Um so, you know, probably short term they're going to have to consolidate those gains. there's just no two ways around it, which is why we did a little trimming, but nothing serious. Uh energy is where you're going to find opportunity. So, this is kind of where all the gains have come from. Unfortunately, we've had enough exposure and just crushed it the way we were positioned. But, uh now these that were positioned for where the puck is going are going to start to go as well, which we're excited for. Um, year-to- date sector performance. So, healthcare discretionary, energy, staples, worst performers, industrials, tech, utilities, comm services, best average S&P company, one-day reaction to earning misses. So, this has been the worst one-day earnings reaction to earnings misses. The average company down 5.2%. Um, the last time you saw that were the lows in Q3 2022. So, just keep that in mind that these companies that are getting hit the hardest, they're probably bottoming here because back here, this was when tech was getting hit the hardest.

Uh, US and EU's power demand expected to accelerate sharply. That's great for commto range resources, etc. Uh, let's make a deal. M&A starting to come back. Wall Street forecast revert back from the tariff uh turmoil. Opinion follows trend. They're all taking their S&P uh targets back up. Small caps unmissable deep discount premium and large cap book multiples is the widest in 25 years going all the way back to the early 2000s. Miss that at your peril. Small and shorted is the theme for the next handful of months. uh through year end. United States GDP growth rate was strong. Stable coins are the 18th largest external holder of treasuries. Expect that to be even higher now that the Genius Act is through, which is part of the reason we're having Andrew on is he's going to explain to us how that works because I think half the stable coins are um on the Ethereum blockchain. I I don't know anything about this stuff. Like I I read it. I just I don't understand it which is but it's important that we know it because we're invested in things that are affected by it and it'll be good information for everyone to have from seriously the best person in the business to learn about it because he helped develop it. So um spending services spending services spending downshifts running well well below trend in 2025. uh potential wall of worry for 2025 performance in August the second term of postelection years. Okay, so uh August tends to be a little weaker. Maybe this is a little precursor. Uh talking about housing affordability, net share of survey who uh say jobs are plentiful. So you're seeing more weakening jobs data. Six charts on S&P 500 activities firming up. Revenue per employee. Sales and EPS beats are strong. Leverage ratio lowest since 2015. Again, opportunity to relever as rates come down. Um, corporate activity, M&A plus IPO starting to tick back up. Capsex to sales is strong and improving for X tech sectors as well. Russell 3000 short interest is near records. That's not the time to be a seller. It's the time to be a buyer. They're the first buyers as they get smashed like like the shorts in the hole in early August are still that short in small caps which will be the first buyers. Um, next is rise of stable coins which we've covered. Two complacent Russell 2000 bottomup consensus estimates. Okay, hardly moved. Uh, two Fed, that's what the way it always look. It's always darkest before done. Two Fed governors descent at July FOMC meeting. It's the largest number of government descents since 1993. So, the natives are getting restless and uh and now internally he's getting dissent in addition to President Trump's dissent and common sense argument that we're paying 600 billion dollars more with taxpayers money on interest than we need to be, particularly when inflation is quelled. And by the way, your target shouldn't be 2% right now. If you get to 2% we are going to have a catastrophe a deflationary crash with the amount of debt that we have in the system particularly in the public sector not in the private sector. Your goal should be 3% inflation. Your goal should be to to actually increase inflation to 3% and lower rates to the neutral rate which would be 3% uh if you're if you're targeting 3% inflation and get growth humming like we did coming out of World War II when debt to GDP was 120% and we brought it down to 63% within a decade less than a decade higher total private again this is collapsing Powell needs to pay attention net call volume for the most shorted stocks versus the rest. So shorts, everything's setting up for short squeezes and those are concentrated in small caps, which is why we've been pounding the table. Continue to be accumulating small caps on pullbacks. FX is a tailwind for Q2. That'll continue in the back half. Dividend yield still inexpensive versus history. Neglected. A lot of our names fall into that category. That's where the opportunity is. Value, same story. Um, FINRA margin balance barely coming off the mat. So, there's a huge opportunity to relever up. Capex increasing across the board. Case Schiller home price national index coming down negative for the first time uh in a few years. And then going back to that um since the great financial crisis, Ben Graham, the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to the optimist and buys from the pessimist. There were a lot of beautiful pessimists in the market today and we took full advantage of it. And there were some optimists in a couple names where we helped them out with a few of our shares. ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAlibaba to launch AI powered glasses, creating a Chinese rival to Meta.

In the short term, the market's a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine. It is weighing garbage fundamentals. Okay? Both on the weighing machine and the voting machine. But Lip Bhan is here to save the day, and we're going to discuss how. With Q2 earning season now in full swing, Intel was the first of our names to report earlier last week. Headline numbers were strong across the board. Revenue came in at 12.9 billion flat yearonear, beating consensus by nearly $1 billion. Let me repeat that. revenues beat consensus by a billion dollars, which means the downward spiral has stopped and now it's stabilizing and then it can start to recover and landing $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. So, not only did they beat by a billion, they were up $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. In fact, Q2 was the third straight quarter of revenue coming ahead of expectations. You could not tell that by the stock price and the short-term emotional voting machine. Earnings were weighed down by restructuring costs and onetime equipment impairment charges. Excluding those, Intel delivered EPS of 10 cents a share ahead of both prior guidance and consensus estimates of 1 cent a share. Not only that, but Q3 guidance held up well with revenue expected between 12.6 6 and 13.6 billion compared to the streets 12.66 billion. Keep in mind Q3 has historically posted high singledigit sequential growth. Current guidance implies -2 to plus 6% due to potential tariff pull forward. That sets a low bar for a beat if demand holds up. But despite the beat and solid guidance, shares fell by nearly 10% after the report. In our view, a gift from the gods. What spooked the market and continues to weigh on the stock comes down to the foundry business and the about face and strategies that Lip Bhutan is bringing to the table and rightfully so.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nresults .

What spooked the market and continues to weigh on the stock comes down to the foundry business and the about face and strategies that Lip Bhutan is bringing to the table and rightfully so.\nHere is  what was added to the K 10 Q and what Lip Bhutan means by making it his top priority to quote become a more financially disciplined foundry. He did not say get out of the foundry business. He said, \"Become a more financially disciplined foundry.\" And quote, \"If we were able to secure a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A, our next generation semiconductor manufacturing process technology, we may pause. If we are okay, here I love this. Here we go. If we are unable to secure a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A, our next generation semiconductor manufacturing process technology, we may pause or discontinue our pursuit of next generation leading edge process technologies which may have significant strategic business, financial and operational and reputational risks and repercussions. This is a complete Uturn from Pat Gellinger's build it and they will come mentality. In Lip Bhutan's own words, quote, \"Over the past several years, the company invested too much too soon without adequate demand. Going forward, our investment in Intel 14A will be based on confirmed consumer commitments. There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense.\" He's now stewarding our capital the way we would steward our capital because he's got skin in the game. He wrote, you know, uh, uh, Bracken wrote a $3 million check for stock. Lip Bhutan wrote a $25 million personal check for stock. Okay. And the shift in strategy is being viewed as putting the foundry future in jeopardy, meaning without landing an external customer, no 14A, and no future Intel internal production. We have a much different take. The foundry business has been a cash incinerator for years, losing $3 billion this quarter alone with an operating margin of71.7%. There's no planet where that is sustainable. And Lip Bhutan has made it clear he is not willing to eat those losses forever. Until Intel sees external customers stepping up with volume commitments, they are scaling back the massive capex buildout. In other words, they are no longer the bag holders. And believe it or not, they actually have the leverage here. Intel is one of only three leading edge chip fabs left in the world. No company that is currently relying on the kindness of strangers for Advanced Foundry. Whether it's Nvidia, Amazon, or anyone else wants to have all their eggs in the TSMC basket. This is essentially a warning shot to engage and get serious or Intel will walk away from the foundry business. No company in their right mind wants that. At the same time, it doesn't hurt to have the US government as your co-investor and subsidizer chief. The government is committed to reducing dependence on Taiwan semiconductor monopoly and creating a duopoly with Intel. I wouldn't bet against the richest Treasury in the world to make that happen. Many bet against the government's commitment to EVs through Tesla subsidies. Ask them how that turned out. The fact of the matter is that the US cannot afford to let Intel struggle. And just last week, we got further confir confirmation with the AI action plan showing exactly how serious they are. Restore American semiconductor manufacturing. America must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US soil. Streamline regulations that slow semiconductor manufacturing efforts. Support nextgen manufacturing. Prioritize investment in these emerging technologies and usher a new industrial renaissance. uh chips and RD programs, etc. But again, while all the focus is on Foundry and reinventing the future, our original thesis has always been that AI and Foundry are just whipped cream on top. We believe continue to believe the legacy PC and service business server business, which makes up 60% of the sales, is worth $45 to $50 per share on its own. That gives us all the margin of safety we need and makes the short-term noise and uncertainty exactly that, just noise. People seem to forget that despite all of Intel's issues, they are still like they they are still like we like to call what we like to call the leader of mediocre chips. They continue to dominate market share in both PCs and servers with 70 to 80% share in the client market and 55% share in servers. This remains the core of our thesis and Lip Bhutan has made it clear that this is where the focus needs to be. They are fully committed to doubling down, engaging with customers early in the product cycle and winning back share. That is music to our ears. And let's not forget, we have a miracle worker at the helm in lip ban. The chart of Cadence Design Systems before and after he took over says everything you need to know. He stepped in after an 86% collapse in this cadence stock. Over the next 14 years, Cadence be became a 68 bagger. 68 bags. 1 million became 68 million by the time he left. Intel is his next turnaround project. And in his own words, he wants to quote pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations. So this is not only about money. This is about his final run legacy. If t\n\nRestore American semiconductor manufacturing. America must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US soil.

This is about his final run legacy. If there is  one person who can pull it off, it's Lip Banan. Lip Bhutan would have never taken the job if he didn't truly believe Intel could be turned around. He spent two years on the board before resigning. clearly in disagreement with Pat Gellzinger's spending spree and direction. The point is he knows the business inside and out and and the industry by the way and there are no surprises for him. He isn't chasing money. The only thing he's chasing is admission into the semiconductor CEO Hall of Fame. And if his track record wasn't enough, within 30 days of taking the job, he wrote a $25 million check out of his own pocket at a $24 cost basis. that puts you in at lower prices than Lip Bhutan. Uh, one of the best operators in the industry. Betting against Lip Boutan has never been a profitable trade and we don't think this time will be any different. Here's everything you need to know following Q2 earnings. You can go through that step by step. We highlighted all the important parts and the deck and the 10 key points. revenue of 12.9 billion beat consensus by roughly 1 billion and came in nearly 500 million uh above the high end of prior guidance. Intel products revenue reached 11.8 billion up slightly sequentially and ahead of expectations across both client and server segments. On the client side, demand continues to benefit from the co era PC refresh cycle with AIPCs representing a growing share of the mix. And in the server business, Granite Rapids is ramping as planned with hyperscalers continue to refresh their CPU installed base 2. Gross margins are expected to face near-term pressure due to the significant ramp up of Lunar Lake Q3 and Panther Lake later this year as cost per wafer remains high in the early stages. However, as volumes increase, management expect gross margins to expand into 2026, continue improving for several years. Management anticipates 40 to 60% fall through for gross margins next three next year leaning towards high-end if volume scale as expected. Three, management remains on track to achieve 2025 operating expense target of 17 billion with plans to reduce opex further to 16 billion next year. Four, 18A reached a mile key milestone at the start of production wafers in Arizona and remains on track for introduction by the end of 2025. It will serve as the foundation for at least the next three generations of Intel client and server products. Most importantly, management continues to expect reasonable returns on investment from Intel products alone. However, as 18A ramps up to high volume, management expects to be in a stronger position to attract external customers as performance yields improve, driving very strong returns over the long term. Five, the first Panther Lake processor SKU remains on track to begin shipping later this year with additional SKUs coming in the first half of 2026. Six, Intel Foundry revenue rose 3% year-over-year to 4.4 4 billion but continues to bleed significant cash posting an operating loss of 3.2 billion up from a 2.8 billion LA uh loss a year ago. Lip Bhutan's top priority is becoming more financially disciplined foundry scaling back capex until there are firm consumer customer volume commitments for 14A as part of this shift. Intel canceled manufacturing products in Germany and Poland and slowed construction in Ohio to better align with market demand. Seven management announced additional layoffs building on the 15% reduction announced last quarter with the target of cutting headcount by to 75,000 employees by year end. That compares to a peak of 132,000 under Gellzinger with most of the reduction already complete. As a result, the company has eliminated 50% of management layers and remains on track to implement its return to office mandate beginning in September. Can you believe it's 2025 and they're just now doing a return to office mandate? Like you can't make this stuff up. Capital expenditures for the full year are expected to total 18 billion, 5 billion below the original guidance set at the start of the year. Management noted that maintenance capex accounts for about half of the current level or roughly 9 billion and expects both growth gross and net capex to decline further in 2026. Deleveraging the balance sheet is top priority in 2025. Management raised 922 million through the mobile eye offering in July and is on track to complete the 4.46 billion sale of Alther Altera stake in Q3. Additional opportunities to monetize non-core assets is also under review. And 10 Q3 guidance includes a revenue range of 12.6 to 13.6 billion down uh 210 of 1% year-on-year gross margins of 36% up 18 basis points and EPS of flat up 46 cents year. Revenue guidance assumes prior quarters benefited from tariff pull forward with management conservatively projecting growth of -2% to plus 6%. Traditionally, Q3 sees high singledigit sequential growth, setting a low bar if demand holds up. So, here are the key things from the earnings call. We've highlighted in green what you need to know. And now on to PayPal. Again, just pulling up the mammoth cycle here. This is um dispondency. Looks like we're now in aversion. So, this would be uh rather discouragement, anxiety. We got up to at $90 93. Then back to 55. We were in aversion. Now we're getting back up to denial before we bust out to the parabolic move. Going back to the mammoth cycle. If you're not watching this on YouTube, um I would highly encourage that you will get four times as much value. But if you can only do it listening, it's better than nothing. Uh so here you can see cash flow near record all-time high, price near record all-time low. Certainly in the last 10 years, revenues continue to reach records. Uh return on invested capital is accelerating up to low double digits from high single digits. Gross margins are starting to reacelerate. PE is near record low. Price to free cash flow near record low. Uh uh balance sheet is better than ever. free cash flow per share is double what it was a few years ago. Common shares outstanding uh has come down about uh looks like about 15% over the last 3 four years. Uh revenues up a third since 2021. PayPal delivered another lights out quarter this week. revenue of 8.3 billion up 5.1% yearonear beat consensus by 220 million while non-GAAP EPS of 140 came in 10 cents ahead of expectations management also raised fullear EPS guidance to 515 from uh to 530 from 495 to 5 to 510 and lifted fullyear transaction margin dollars essentially gross profit to 51 15.35 to 15.5 billion from prior guidance of 15.2 2 to 15.4. Going through the earnings call, it is hard to find anything not to like. The highlight color is overwhelmingly green. The one soft spot was adjusted free cash flow with ca which came in at just 656 million, down 42% year-onear and well below the 1.62 billion the street expected. In typical shoot first ask\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquestions  later fashion. That was not enough for Mr. Market. Uh that was enough for Mr. market to send the stock down by nearly 10%. That sell-off looks even sillier when you realize the slowdown was entirely due to timing shifts in working capital, not any slowdown in the business or permanent impairment. These effects are expected to reverse in the second half if you are an investor and not a trader. The only number that should matter is management reaffirmed fullear free cash flow guidance of six to7 billion this machine spits out of cash uh in the year which is just mind-boggling which implies a nearly 10% free cash flow yield at the midpoint to be sure sell the stock because free cash flow is lumpy be which has long been the norm for PayPal to those who saw saw these results, listened to the call, and still decided to sell. We will gladly be mailing you Christmas cards for the next few years. Uh, we already knew Alex Chris was a winner based on what he accomplishment leading the small business group at into it, but each quarter continues to raise our confidence even higher. Remember, short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. I've built my career on finding opportunities where price disconnects from improving fundamentals. And when investors are bending over backwards to find reasons to sell, just know that dispondency tends to revert to euphoria. That flip might be closer than anyone realizes. We'll be happy to return the early Christmas favor and hand out some shares when the stock is trading well over $150. Here's everything you need to know following the results. You can go through this profitable growth is greater than empty calories. You can see this lumpy cash flow 6 to7 billion years. Uh all these decks we highlighted the important things. Go through it. Here are the 10 key points. Number one, PayPal posted its sixth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with transaction margin dollars reaching 3.8 84 billion, up 7% yearonear, 8% excluding interest on customer balances. Transaction margin rose to 46.4% up 62 basis points yearon year. Declining transaction margin dollar growth had always been central to the bare case with drops of 3% in 2022 and negative 5% in 2023. Alex Chris has flipped that on its head, delivering 5% growth in 2024 and guiding for another 5 to 6% growth in 2025 and targeting high singledigit growth by 2027 with a long-term ambition of 10%. Two, Venmo posted revenue growth over 20%, its highest since 2023. Total payment volume grew 12% during the quarter, accelerating quarter over-arter to the fastest rate in three years. Pay with Venmo total payment volume grew more than 45% while monthly active accounts for the Venmo's debit card rose over 40%. These debit card users have some of the most attractive economics in the ecosystem with both Venmo and PayPal debit card users showing 6x the transaction activity and 3x the average revenue per account. We have always said Venmo is a verb and when Alex Chris took over, there were real doubts about whether Venmo could return to growth. Fast forward today, it's on track for well over $2 billion in revenue by 2027 and just getting started. Three, one of the most important pivots in strategy under Alex Chris has been choosing profitable growth over what he called empty calorie revenues, aka firing unprofitable PSP. Brainree customers as expected. Brainree total payment volume growth has slowed dramatically posting just 2% for the past two quarters down from 18% a year ago with PSP consistently making up over 40% of total payment volume. The shift created short-term revenue headwind of roughly 5% in recent quarters. The good news is that not only have transaction margin dollars improved meaningfully, but the business has also reached an inflection point. Management expects break brain-free total payment volume to reacelerate in the second half of the year and beyond following peak pressure from contract renegotiations and the removal of low margin volumes. Just take a look at this inflection for online branded checkout grew 5% year-on-year. A slight deceleration from 6% growth in the prior quarter and one of the few soft spot uh soft spots in the report. The slowdown was driven by weakness in tariff impacted regions such as Asia-based marketplaces. Without that pressure, growth would have held steady at 6%. The good news is that softness has already stabilized in Q3. Management continues to guide for fullear growth in the mid single digits with improvement expected over the coming quarters and a path to 8 to 10% growth by 2027. This is largely driven by continued adoption of the new checkout experience which made up 30% of US branded as of February 2025 and has already reached over 60% on track to exceed 80% of global transactions by 2027. Five, buy now pay later continues to accelerate and with volume growth of more than 20% and monthly active accounts up 18% outpacing the overall market as PayPal gains share in the space. These customers bring highly attractive economics with average order value more than 80% higher than a standard checkout transaction. Management also noted ongoing improvements in charge off and stable low delinquency rates with plans to expand into additional markets to increase marketing efforts throughout the year. Six total active accounts grew by nearly 2 million from Q1, up 2% for the quarter, reaching an all-time high of 438 million. Monthly active accounts also rose 2% year-onear to 226 million as the largest two-sided platform in the world continues to get bigger. Seven adjusted free cash flow came in at 66 656 million, well below street consensus of 100 1.62 billion. While a soft number caught the market off guard, management said this was simply due to timing shifts in working capital that are expected to reverse in the second half. More importantly, they reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to 7 billion with a B, implying a nearly 10% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Eight share repurchases totaled $1.5 billion for the quarter, bringing the trailing 12 month to total to $6 billion and reducing the share count by 7%. Your pi, your slice of the pie got 7% bigger without putting one new dollar of cash into the company. Management still expects to buy back $6 billion of stock this year, implying a buyback yield well over 8% at current prices with 13.7 billion in cash and investments versus 1.5 billion in debt.

We think t\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  plenty of dry powder for management to ramp up repurchases if Mr. Market continues on one of his manic bouts. Nine management noted that recent talk of certain banks charging for access to customer data which triggered a sharp sell-off in the stock is immaterial to PayPal. They confirmed the company will not be impacted by any such pricing changes. 10 management raised fullear guidance now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.15 to $5.30 11 to 14% earnings growth compared to prior guidance of 495 to 510 6 to10% growth. Transaction margin dollars were also raised to a range of 15.35 billion to 155 5 to 6% growth versus previous guidance of four to 5% growth. They reaffirmed free cash flow estimates of 6 to 7 billion, share repurchases of 6 billion and capex of around a billion. This guidance still looks relatively conservative with the low end assuming up to a couple of points of decelerating in e-commerce spending, though management has seen no evidence thus far. Here are the key points from the earnings call highlighted in green. and uh you can go through those and quick Boeing update.

But just to hit on a few quick points of Boeing, if you wanted to see a textbook example, dispondency reverting to Euphoria, look no further than Boeing. Just a few months you couldn't give away the stock in the early 130s. We were on an island saying that we were bullish and got looked at like we had three heads. Now it's at 225 and it's all anyone wants to talk about. As for Q2, it all comes to two words. Kelly Ortberg in his own words, 2025 is Boeing's turnaround year. We could not agree more. As we always say, the number one thing you want to see in a turnaround is free cash flow, especially for a company like Boeing. And they absolutely delivered adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was a usage of 200 million compared to consensus estimates of a $1.8 billion usage and a year ago figure of4.3 billion. Management now sees a usage of just three billion as a reasonable fullear target compared to prior guidance of four to five billion cash burn. Most importantly, the long-term 10 billion of free cash flow target remains intact. That free cash flow is being powered by a business firing on all cylinders. Boeing recorded the highest number of deliveries in both Q2 and the first half of the year since 2018 along with its strongest quarterly revenue in six years. Meanwhile, the 737 program is now running at a production rate of 38 per month and is expected to climb to 42 in the months ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, this thing is going higher. It probably consolidates in the short term. Uh many thanks to Kelly Ortberg for his miracle work in progress. An amazing run we've had in the last couple of months.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nGeneral market. Um a little bit elevated. Active investment managers taking some risk off. Uh again, I think it's more of a sideways chop than it's going to be any material corrections beyond a five normal five to healthy 5 to 10% pullback. NASDAQ top 30 weights earnings estimates went up for this year by almost 1% and next year by 1.14%. Dow same thing earnings are going up 1.25% this year. Uh 56 basis points next year that's top 30. Well, that is the 30. Um, continuing jobless claims. Nothing really big here. Let me just see. GDP came in stronger than expected. That's that fact.

So, here we go. And here's our first question from York Bourgeoa. Hope your earning season been going great. Uh with com stock now below 20. Could you describe the comparison between them and national oil well Varco and where you put new money? Uh look, we own com stock from eight bucks. So we're not really chasing up here. Although I am tempted to buy some stock at this these levels, but Varco is a much better bargain cuz it's just getting started. So, um they're two different businesses. I I I could buy I mean, if if com goes back to 15, I I'd put new money to work there, but I mean with an $8 basis, I'm not going to bring my basis up uh just because of a simple pullback. I like Varco here for a new stock for the long term. Brennan Birkhart, I'm 14 years old and have been trading. My dad introduced me to your podcast. He's a big fan of your work and encouraged me to start listening. Hey, welcome, man. Congratulations. 14. Uh, you're a little late. I started when I was 10, but uh, you know, I think you'll catch up. No worries. Uh, while doing some research, came across the stock grab. My dad suggested I like balance sheet cash flow, revenue. From what I saw, the company seems to have low debt, strong cash flow, solid financials. What am I missing? You're missing. We covered this one a couple weeks ago. I hate the food delivery business. Um, I think it's garbage business, but uh, we've covered this one a few times in the last few weeks. I think it probably works as a trade. I think your instinct is correct on this one, Brennan, but um, it's not the type of business that I would on want to own for anything more than a trade. Um, it is recovering, it is growing, but let's just take a quick look here. So, you know, it's trading at seven times sales, um, 200 times earnings, and I think the growth rate has leveled off and there's a lot of competition in that. So, for me, it's not what I'm interested in, but I think you're probably right from a trading standpoint, but from an own forever, not there's no real moat. Eaton Daniel trying to work on my mental valuation muscle and just wanting your thoughts. VFC Corp said they have 300 save 300 million in their cost structure. Expect another 500 to 600 million in savings to flow to net operating income. So just on a savings growth assuming no growth they could be trading 10 to 15 times 800 million this sounds like 8 billion to 12 billion uh valuation from today's 4.5. So double to triple with no growth and possibly another triple on top over the next 5 years assuming fixed costs stay flat and growth comes back at single digit. Um I think you're in the ballpark. I think I look I think Bracken is going to take this thing uh from our original model uh we had underwritten it for originally we had underwritten it for $50 and then we rerated to 100 after he made some uh adjustments on probably about a year in and we've have no change to outlook. Everything he said he's going to do is hitting on all cylinders. He got a little sidetracked with the tariff thing but it's completely immaterial because everyone has that as you saw in his interviews. So, you're roughly in the ballpark.

Um I don't I don't really like this business, but um this is more of a value trap. If you want to buy it for the yield, have at it. It's just it's just um if you're going to go into alcohol, you want to be on the premium premiumization side. People are drinking less and higher quality. I mean, there's nothing not to love here in terms of the free cash flow growth. Uh I think their balance sheet though might have a little bit of leverage, more leverage than we're comfortable with. Four billion of cash. No. I mean, I don't see anything egregiously wrong with this business at all. I just don't think you're going to get the move you expect to get, but I don't think you're going to get hurt either. So, um I just think there are higher and better uses. And uh let me just see what that is happening with the revenue trends, it's been headed down, but I I don't think you get hurt with it, but I don't think you make a lot of money either. Okay. S T I N G N J N Stigen Ain. Thoughts on Worldline? WL NPA No real signs of recovery in revenue or free cash flow or return on invested capital. I I I wouldn't just buy PayPal. You got a winner running it. Why are you going to screw around digging in the dumpster? You dig in the dumpster, you get fleas. Can you look at algen uh a line? They got destroyed recently. You know, people have been bringing up this stock every week and I continue to say no. I don't think there's any change in that. I'm a pass. I think there's too much competition. I don't think they have a moat. Jay Hammond, uh, Wholesome owns Elevate Roofing Products. Is wholesome a buy? Not for me. Revenue is going down and stock price is an all-time high. Hard pass. Just buy QXO. bet with Brad Henry Hasselfeld. Love the show. Share it with everyone I know. Thank you so much. I appreciate that. Um, best way, best compliment you guys can do. Best way you can pay back. Share it with two or three people you know who love markets and could really benefit from having a positive framework, a stable framework, not chasing shiny objects and eventually getting taken out to the woodshed. Um, all right. So, here's a guy nervous that uh about Mag 7. They're pushing higher. Feels like they're never going to end. Blah blah blah. Do not chase them. That's all I can tell you. Um they will be the first ones to get hit this fall when you have choppy volatility. Johnny asks, \"What do you think of the financials for SPT? What is this thing? Sprout social influencer strategy. I I mean social media management I I have no edge on what their competitive mode is. So hard pass. I stay away from companies like that. Uh could work. It's just not it's outside my framework. Isaiah G uh following work in completely different industry following enriching rep recommend to my peers whenever I can. By the way go to hedge funips.com click on terms. This is all opinion not advice for educational purposes only. Uh Monster Beverage as a short um this is one of the best performing stocks of all time and he wants to short it. Cash flow is at a record high. Price is not revenues keep growing. There's nothing to short here. So I I mean could it go down in the short term as a short-term trade? Yeah. But I that that is a sucker game. stay away. Uh, next, Martin Nova, Nova Nordisk. Uh, this is what I told you guys last fall that everyone said these things would go to the sky and uh, you know, I looked like I was bearish and everyone's like, \"Oh, they're going to keep going higher.\" And every single one of them is now down at least 25% with Novo now down 66%. Not yet. Too many broken suckers who bought up. Uh it's going to take time to build a base. At least a half a year. You got time to buy this thing. Let it go lower. Uh, next, Morning Stars NOV view looked more bearish than bullish with a price target of only $17. Are they always bearish? I I don't care about secondary work. I do my own work and this is a cyclical play that you have to have experience going through cycles. This thing when it turns is going to be 4x 5x bags. And now is the period over the next few years where that's going to happen in our view. Um, regardless of what Morning Star says looking in the rearview mirror, uh, I was thinking recently, man, this is from Gareth Hancock. I was thinking recently, man, the only Tom Hayes pick that hasn't performed this year is VF Corp. Uh, what do you think? I loaded up last night just before earnings and I'm now roaring at my screen. Well, Gareth, welcome back to Earth, homeboy. Uh, you just got smoked, but uh hopefully you had some dry powder to buy in the 11s and uh and take your basis down because this thing is going to be many, many bags over the next 5 years. Um, and probably a lot sooner actually. What do you think about UNH? No. Anytime there's a DOJ investigation, t\n\nMonster Beverage as a short um this is one of the best performing stocks of all time and he wants to short it. Cash flow is at a record high.

You're actually not. Here's a clean bill of health. They just basically it drags on for two years. Management takes their eye off the ball. If you have to play health care, I'd buy like humanity or something like that. I wouldn't even mess with the lower quality. Sentine. I know it looks attractive, but they got all that Medicaid exposure. It's just I'd go with something a little higherend. John Barry, uh, do you think Whirlpool is now a buy? This is a housing play, so I don't need another housing play. We've got enough between um Gener Stanley Black & Decker and QXO to housing and rates play and so is so is Cooper Standard rates play. So um I mean their revenues just show zero sign of recovering. So I I mean no I don't I don't really I think you're right but there's no factual basis. I think you're totally right. Like looking at it as a trader, I agree with you. Looking at it fundamentally, I I have no interest to commit any capital. Dan lease unhooj. Happy to be wrong on that one. Stephen, uh, that's a new client. Next, Greg inquiry. Greg Alimari CNC. No, I would go higher end to Humanana Edgard Abriu Novo. No, just covered ArtM. Uh, love the podcast. Continued optimism when everyone else is panicking. Not sure if this has already been covered. Thoughts on UPS? Uh, continue to have my eye on it. I think you're going to be right on UPS. But it's probably time to buy UPS. Let me just take a look. So, we got 19 billion of debt. The only issue is the balance sheet's a little bit leveraged, but other than that, uh, I don't think you're going to get hurt buying it here. I think you buy if you really want to be in it. I think there are higher and better uses of capital and I think it's going to take longer to build a base than you think. But uh I'd buy like half the position here and if it goes down to 70, finish up your position and then you you know in three or five years you probably have a double double and a half. Uh but I could definitely see it starting to turn here. Let me just see what is uh what earnings estimates are for this one. By the way, you get a nice dividend while you wait, which will probably be cut, but for now it's nice. Uh, let's see. Yeah, a lot of pessimism in the stock. I I kind of like it. I kind of like it. I know we've looked at it a million times. I kept saying lower lower, but now it's getting to the point where it's, you know, you it's not going to all Stephen Frampton cut guidance and the dividend. Yeah. Uh Stephen, and by the way, thanks Stephen. He does all the incredible video work on our social platforms. I think you're right, Stephen, but I think uh it's got to go lower uh and we have to see some signs of the turnaround before we guess that the turnaround's coming. But I think generally you are correct. Uh I just think there are higher and better uses at the moment. Robert Smith considering buying Dow, cutting the dividend. Yeah. If I I like Albam Maro for for um materials exposure. We we keep looking at this one every week. I don't know what turned me off about it. Let me just see. Yeah, it's still negative free cash flows. Let's look for some signs of turnaround before we get involved. But yeah, it's probably getting close. Uh, Jack Lomer, 20-year-old listening from Dublin, Ireland. Love listening to podcast every week, gaining loads of valuable insights and your opinions, not advice. With recession risk in the US appearing to diminish and some economic indicators improving, why does broad market consensus remain so bearish on the US dollar? Is it solely to do with slowing growth from US perspective or consensus uh way too bearish? Um, I think we are going to get a counter trend bounce because if you recall last year I was bearish on the dollar when everyone was bullish. Now people are starting to become everyone's starting to become bearish. So we probably do get a large counter trend balance but the trend is down. We we are going to have to inflate away this debt and uh grow above trend and Trump wants a weaker dollar and he'll say he wants a stronger dollar but it's going to help our earnings. It's going to help our exports. It's going to make us more competitive and it's what we need in the short term. If we have a high dollar, we're going to have problems with the amount of debt that we owe. So, um, expect a counter trend bounce followed by a continued downtrend.

I'd love to see it like spike up to 150 and then kind of stabilize here for a while. uh from a entry standpoint cuz this thing was a you know this was a 12 13 14 bagger and when they break they take an awful long time to build a base usually years and I don't know if this has been building a base long enough just from a entry standpoint from a fundamental standpoint I kind of agree with you but I I just don't know the business well enough I'd rather you know personally being in what I what I know which is Baxter but Um, I can't find anything dramatically wrong with it other than the fact is I don't have confidence that the bottom's in.

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nWe got a lot to cover today.\n\n look, look, I think uh we don't have to be carart. We have to be we have to be the best Dickies we can possibly be. We haven't the last few years. Now the the trends on there are improving too. So the the there was a a turnaround to do there and it's it really dampened this quarter got in the single digits and I'm really optimistic about that business too. I've got a fantastic team there led by a super guy Chris goal out of GAP and he's brought in some just a superstar team there. So just like Sune at at uh Advance and Caroline Brown and Nina Flood I've got four really great big brand leaders now. >> All right. And then last thing and I know that you're dealing with the tariffs. you've been able to mitigate some, not all. Uh, how life-threatening is a tariff to VF court? >> Look, you know, the tariffs are are the great thing about the tariffs is that they tr they they treat everybody equally in our industry. Just everybody's kind of in the same boat. So, in an environment like that, we can deal with it. So, we're taking cost out, relocating factories, and we're raising prices. And we will manage it all as we go into 27. We'll manage it all. So that during 27 we'll offset all the tariffs between those three mechanisms. So it's not life-threatening. We will manage it. >> Well, if if you had to raise price is is the consumer strong enough to be able to take price. >> I think so. You know, we're going to do it very strategically. You know, and as I said, the good thing is you when you're looking at alternatives, you know, if everybody's raising price, and I suspect they will be in our industry because everybody's going to have the same cost increase, then it prices will go up. And then it comes back to let the best brands win. And we believe we have great brands. >> Well, I think your situation is Oh, God. I want to own the stock myself. Not allowed to, but I think it's really time for Brack and Daryl, president CEO of VFO. Brack, I love when you're on the show. Thanks very much. Thank you so much. >> Hey, Jim. I just have to say, you know, I now bought on my own. I've taken $3 million of my own money, one by one by one, and bought stock myself. So, I'm obviously more than just a believer. I'm I'm personally invested beyond what you normally get as a CEO. I like a CEO's all in with his own money rather than just having the shareholders give it to him just because it's much more real that way. Thank you, Bracken. Great to see you again. >> Thank you. >> That's Bracken Daryl, president CEO of VF Corp. And we're back. Uh then Baxter, as you can see here, complete kitchen sink quarter setting the table for the new CEO. We'll cover that one in detail next week. We were buyers today. You'll probably get another couple of days where you can buy the stock. Uh Andrew hitters coming in huge home run. Uh Seven Bagger Plus in his past thing healthc care business and uh this time will be no different. So we're excited about that. Generrack shot the lights out. Fantastic job. Res's crushing it. We'll cover that in detail. Now on to D. Now on to some data. After pandemic lull, Disney's operating profit is growing once again, poised to hit new highs. Most shorted stocks are beating the S&P 500. So short and small was the theme up till yesterday when Powell um came out aggressively hawkish as an FU to the president. Um I can assure you he will not be the one to have the last word. Uh and this trend is going to continue. But the outperformance of small and shorted was 11 percentage points greater than uh the S&P 500 i.e. mag 7 over that period. And uh I think the short-term interruption from yesterday is going to quickly resolve itself back to back to trend. Uh China's augmented budget deficit widens. They're they're stimulating. Here's some uh sellside stuff on Varco maintaining their price target at $20. Uh after earnings, GenerRack uh raising their price target to 210 opinion follows trend. Boeing raised the price target to $250. Uh Varco again different firm $190. QXO opinion follows trend target up to $33. uh Intel ref recovery roadmap roadmap taking shape uh we'll cover that one VF corp uh upside as return to topline growth comes into focus uh comtock uh here's UBS putting a sell on it of course the all the eur European banks are always the most bearish uh Varco they took it to $18 not concerned this is a cyclical play when it goes it gallops just like comtock Just like range. I love this is um gosh, do we have that mammoth cycle? Let's see. Mammoth stock market cycle. This is where we are on a lot of the names. is right here. So, we've gone through a lot of this on these names and now you get into a version where you get this final check back before you get to denial and it would break out. We're we're here right now on Cooper Standard. Okay, so we had that shoot up collapse. Now we're here and now we're breaking through. This is going to return in confidence. Um, PayPal, we're here. You can see it. Yeah. Take a look at this. PayPal basically right down here. Headed back up to denial and then straight up Baba. Same thing. This is perfect. Actually, if you look at BABA, people are so depressed about this. You can't even see the move in the last few weeks. So, you had all this there. Then you go up. Then you test it. You're right here. You're literally right here in denial. It's breaking out above this right here in denial. And then you're going to get returning confidence is where you get the parabolic move. They're all basically there. PayPal. Um, Baxter is probably down here somewhere. Baxter's right here. Max discouragement. Uh, let's take a look here. Generrack. [Music] It's going to be a longer call than I thought. Oh, this is perfect. Look at this. Look at this Generrack. It's just retesting that. It's right here. It's literally right here. So, this is what we're going to get is that this little pullback will probably reload before a next parabolic move. Then you got um VF Corp. Where's VF Corp? VF Corp is probably right down here. Perfect. The spike up and a test down. You're probably right. You might be here. You might be here or you might be here. But either way, I think you're probably here in a version Cooper Standard. [Music] It's just breaking out now. This is pretty amazing. Cooper Standards just breaking out. This is huge. Um I'm excited. Thank God for today. Thank god I was in front of the screens just just ready with my licking my chops and pressing the buy buttons on these that we had one more bite at the apple like the backers in discouragement the Intels's in discouragement the VF corpse in discouragement or aversion um what what else was there today. Dagio, Intel, Varco, Stanley. We bought some Stanley Black & Decker today. Stanley is probably I think it's right here. Let's take a look at Stanley. Boy, this is not how I expected the uh podcast to go today, but I'm having fun doing this. All right. So, you had this recovery and then a final flush and now it's starting to recover final flush. I think you're probably here probably somewhere between aversion and denial on Stanley Black & Decker. All right, so that's that. Let's get back to some data before we take any more tangents. But sometimes the tangents are where the best stuff is. All right. US firms exceed profit estimate estimates at strongest rate in four years. Earnings are going fine. Mainland China's capital inflows into Hong Kong have topped the last year's total. That game is on. They'll get a handshake picture with Trump. Stocks will go crazy. The earnings will support it. Off to the races. Growth in credit card spending. We need to relever the private sector, delever the public sector. Each component of speculating training indicator elevated versus history. Okay. So, we're seeing that this is what we talked about last week. [Music] This was a key point I wanted to cover. The reason I said last week, I said last week, you know, we're growing into a period. We've obviously had a huge move. Uh but I would not expect a big crash of 20%. you're at the most you're going to see during this weak seasonal period of August through October is 5 to 10% pullback to be bought and um and some volatility at the most and I and I wouldn't get too cute with it because there are too many people behind the benchmark that have to buy every single dip that got destroyed in April. Uh and that's why I would stay very constructive. The other reason why is that on average going back a 100red years the market gets a 20% plus uh intraear bare market correction every 4.2 years on average. We have now had three of those in the last 5 years in 2020 in 2022 and in 2025 peaked to trough about 20%. So, we've pulled forward something like 12 years of these uh 20% corrections in a matter of 5 years. Uh I think what you're going to see is a lot of recency bias uh thinking we're going right back to that and idiots on TV calling for a big crash in 2026. Yeah, it's a it's an election year. It tends to be choppy the midterm election years, etc. Fine. If we finish the last fourth quarter super strong, uh, of course you're going to get a pullback in probably February, March, and into the election. But, uh, I don't think we're going to get another 20% correction. We're kind of, uh, overused on that front. Um, I think the five or 10s are going to be perfect and they're going to be bought. Okay. Cyclical sector breath has weakened relative to defensive. Uh, defensives have been given away. defensives are the are the Backaxers of the world, the Diagios of the world, the Crown Castles of the world, um the Hormels of the world. I think those are going to start to get bid. I think people are underestimating those and that they probably get bid in the fall when when you start to see a little chop. AI boom drives largest US grid capacity cost to another record. Again, this is helping the Generax. This is helping the car the comm stocks over the long term. Commodity prices rally in July. Lithium Albamaro. Uh sharp increases in speculative trading typically signal above average short-term equity returns. So you've got um 36 months out. 12 months out you you tend to get another 12%. So that's that's your sweet spot is 12 months out which would make sense. And then you get a little weakness into that election. Chart of the week flows into cyclicals versus defensives. Cyclicals have gone straight up until yesterday's um sermon on the mount. Uh defensives have been left for dead. I think defensives get bid. Cyclicals may have to take a rest after that uh for a few weeks, but um that creates opportunity. Earnings growth expected to pick up in 2025. Uh those are starting to be revised upward. If you remember, we we're through the downgrading uh uh cycle. Technology versus consumer staples. I think you got to have some staples exposure. Whether it's Dagio, whether it's Baxter, whether it's uh um Horell, whether it's, you know, someone mentioned Clorox on the call. Uh these type of stocks. This is tech relative to defensives. I think uh I think this is going to shift pretty soon. uh at least in the short term. Lithium in China surges. So, Albamaro is I mean that that thing is going to just be you you're seeing it start to start to gallop. People can't believe it. It's going to gallop. Uh US firms exceed profit estimates at strongest rate in four years. Uh 46% of companies so far have expressed optimism. That's above average. MSCI China index return by year since 2010. Uh so year to date is is starting to perform. FINRA margin debt over the W Wilshire total market index. Uh this is pretty interesting. Margin debt relative to the index is near all-time lows. Uh similar to what you saw after the tech wreck, which you know implies there's there's again uh room for private sector releveraging and public sector dleveraging. And um the only way to delever the public sector is to run growth hot and run inflation above trend and uh have growth rise faster than interest cost as we've done it before in the past. Uh rally has more room to broaden out. We agree uh it's fits and starts can never take the first two days after Fed meeting serious. And I do think Trump is going to hit him right in the right in the solar plexes and and knock this knock the wind out of him. I think I think yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. There was no reason to be that hawkish. Um, okay. Growth sectors are outperforming, values outperforming in Europe. That's the last few weeks. A little bit of a divergence. Uh, US transmission power outages have become more frequent and grid reliability is worse today than in the early 2000s. You're seeing it in Generax results. average household would need 220% more electricity to go all electric. Online retail spending growth has generally outpaced services and overall retail spending growth throughout 2025. So far, uh relative strength versus the S&P 500 in the last year. Staples have been extremely weak relative to the&p 500. Staples and healthcare, that's where you're going to see some opportunity. Staples healthcare and real estate, I think that's where you're going to see some outperformance in the next 18 months. materials, same thing. Uh utilities, I I wouldn't get too interested in that. Financials, selective, I like uh discretionary, same thing. So, industrials have had a run. Um technologies had a run. So, you know, you've seen it in Generrack, you've seen it in Boeing. Um so, you know, probably short term they're going to have to consolidate those gains. there's just no two ways around it, which is why we did a little trimming, but nothing serious. Uh energy is where you're going to find opportunity. So, this is kind of where all the gains have come from. Unfortunately, we've had enough exposure and just crushed it the way we were positioned. But, uh now these that were positioned for where the puck is going are going to start to go as well, which we're excited for. Um, year-to- date sector performance. So, healthcare discretionary, energy, staples, worst performers, industrials, tech, utilities, comm services, best average S&P company, one-day reaction to earning misses. So, this has been the worst one-day earnings reaction to earnings misses. The average company down 5.2%. Um, the last time you saw that were the lows in Q3 2022. So, just keep that in mind that these companies that are getting hit the hardest, they're probably bottoming here because back here, this was when tech was getting hit the hardest. Down\n\nwhen cyclicals are getting hit the hardest. They're going to be the ones that that lead the next leg. Bull markets built on quiet strength. Quarterly estimates going up. Uh, US and EU's power demand expected to accelerate sharply. That's great for commto range resources, etc. Uh, let's make a deal. M&A starting to come back. Wall Street forecast revert back from the tariff uh turmoil. Opinion follows trend. They're all taking their S&P uh targets back up. Small caps unmissable deep discount premium and large cap book multiples is the widest in 25 years going all the way back to the early 2000s. Miss that at your peril. Small and shorted is the theme for the next handful of months. uh through year end. United States GDP growth rate was strong. Stable coins are the 18th largest external holder of treasuries. Expect that to be even higher now that the Genius Act is through, which is part of the reason we're having Andrew on is he's going to explain to us how that works because I think half the stable coins are um on the Ethereum blockchain. I I don't know anything about this stuff. Like I I read it. I just I don't understand it which is but it's important that we know it because we're invested in things that are affected by it and it'll be good information for everyone to have from seriously the best person in the business to learn about it because he helped develop it. So um spending services spending services spending downshifts running well well below trend in 2025. uh potential wall of worry for 2025 performance in August the second term of postelection years. Okay, so uh August tends to be a little weaker. Maybe this is a little precursor. Uh talking about housing affordability, net share of survey who uh say jobs are plentiful. So you're seeing more weakening jobs data. Six charts on S&P 500 activities firming up. Revenue per employee. Sales and EPS beats are strong. Leverage ratio lowest since 2015. Again, opportunity to relever as rates come down. Um, corporate activity, M&A plus IPO starting to tick back up. Capsex to sales is strong and improving for X tech sectors as well. Russell 3000 short interest is near records. That's not the time to be a seller. It's the time to be a buyer. They're the first buyers as they get smashed like like the shorts in the hole in early August are still that short in small caps which will be the first buyers. Um, next is rise of stable coins which we've covered. Two complacent Russell 2000 bottomup consensus estimates. Okay, hardly moved. Uh, two Fed, that's what the way it always look. It's always darkest before done. Two Fed governors descent at July FOMC meeting. It's the largest number of government descents since 1993. So, the natives are getting restless and uh and now internally he's getting dissent in addition to President Trump's dissent and common sense argument that we're paying 600 billion dollars more with taxpayers money on interest than we need to be, particularly when inflation is quelled. And by the way, your target shouldn't be 2% right now. If you get to 2% we are going to have a catastrophe a deflationary crash with the amount of debt that we have in the system particularly in the public sector not in the private sector. Your goal should be 3% inflation. Your goal should be to to actually increase inflation to 3% and lower rates to the neutral rate which would be 3% uh if you're if you're targeting 3% inflation and get growth humming like we did coming out of World War II when debt to GDP was 120% and we brought it down to 63% within a decade less than a decade higher total private again this is collapsing Powell needs to pay attention net call volume for the most shorted stocks versus the rest. So shorts, everything's setting up for short squeezes and those are concentrated in small caps, which is why we've been pounding the table. Continue to be accumulating small caps on pullbacks. FX is a tailwind for Q2. That'll continue in the back half. Dividend yield still inexpensive versus history. Neglected. A lot of our names fall into that category. That's where the opportunity is. Value, same story. Um, FINRA margin balance barely coming off the mat. So, there's a huge opportunity to relever up. Capex increasing across the board. Case Schiller home price national index coming down negative for the first time uh in a few years. And then going back to that um since the great financial crisis, Ben Graham, the intelligent investor is a realist who sells to the optimist and buys from the pessimist. There were a lot of beautiful pessimists in the market today and we took full advantage of it. And there were some optimists in a couple names where we helped them out with a few of our shares. ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nAlibaba to launch AI powered glasses, creating a Chinese rival to Meta.

In the short term, the market's a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine. It is weighing garbage fundamentals. Okay? Both on the weighing machine and the voting machine. But Lip Bhan is here to save the day, and we're going to discuss how. With Q2 earning season now in full swing, Intel was the first of our names to report earlier last week. Headline numbers were strong across the board. Revenue came in at 12.9 billion flat yearonear, beating consensus by nearly $1 billion. Let me repeat that. revenues beat consensus by a billion dollars, which means the downward spiral has stopped and now it's stabilizing and then it can start to recover and landing $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. So, not only did they beat by a billion, they were up $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. In fact, Q2 was the third straight quarter of revenue coming ahead of expectations. You could not tell that by the stock price and the short-term emotional voting machine. Earnings were weighed down by restructuring costs and onetime equipment impairment charges. Excluding those, Intel delivered EPS of 10 cents a share ahead of both prior guidance and consensus estimates of 1 cent a share. Not only that, but Q3 guidance held up well with revenue expected between 12.6 6 and 13.6 billion compared to the streets 12.66 billion. Keep in mind Q3 has historically posted high singledigit sequential growth. Current guidance implies -2 to plus 6% due to potential tariff pull forward. That sets a low bar for a beat if demand holds up. But despite the beat and solid guidance, shares fell by nearly 10% after the report. In our view, a gift from the gods. What spooked the market and continues to weigh on the stock comes down to the foundry business and the about face and strategies that Lip Bhutan is bringing to the table and rightfully so.",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nfinally  broke 80 for the first time. I hit goal one, but as you can see, I got a long way to go with the index to get down to a 99. I'm at a 104. It's going to take a lot more than one lucky round. Uh, that was a grind. I almost blew it on the on the 18th hole, by the way. I thought I put it in the water. It was six yards short. Uh driver, sixiron, 56, two putt, uh par five over the water. Super excited. 39 on the front, easy peasy. 40 on the back. Works for every single shot. Uh but I got it done. So, uh we'll see if I can get the second part of the goal before officially playing golf.\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\nUS transmission power outages have become more frequent and grid reliability is worse today than in the early 2000s. You're seeing it in Generax results. average household would need 220% more electricity to go all electric. Online retail spending growth has generally outpaced services and overall retail spending growth throughout 2025. So far, uh relative strength versus the S&P 500 in the last year. Staples have been extremely weak relative to the&p 500. Staples and healthcare, that's where you're going to see some opportunity. Staples healthcare and real estate, I think that's where you're going to see some outperformance in the next 18 months. materials, same thing. Uh utilities, I I wouldn't get too interested in that. Financials, selective, I like uh discretionary, same thing. So, industrials have had a run. Um technologies had a run. So, you know, you've seen it in Generrack, you've seen it in Boeing. Um so, you know, probably short term they're going to have to consolidate those gains. there's just no two ways around it, which is why we did a little trimming, but nothing serious. Uh energy is where you're going to find opportunity. So, this is kind of where all the gains have come from. Unfortunately, we've had enough exposure and just crushed it the way we were positioned. But, uh now these that were positioned for where the puck is going are going to start to go as well, which we're excited for. Um, year-to- date sector performance. So, healthcare discretionary, energy, staples, worst performers, industrials, tech, utilities, comm services, best average S&P company, one-day reaction to earning misses. So, this has been the worst one-day earnings reaction to earnings misses. The average company down 5.2%. Um, the last time you saw that were the lows in Q3 2022. So, just keep in mind that these companies that are getting hit the hardest, they're probably bottoming here because back here, this was when tech was getting hit the hardest. Down\n\near growth in the mid single digits with improvement expected over the coming quarters and a path to 8 to 10% growth by 2027. This is largely driven by continued adoption of the new checkout experience which made up 30% of US branded as of February 2025 and has already reached over 60% on track to exceed 80% of global transactions by 2027. Five, buy now pay later continues to accelerate and with volume growth of more than 20% and monthly active accounts up 18% outpacing the overall market as PayPal gains share in the space. These customers bring highly attractive economics with average order value more than 80% higher than a standard checkout transaction. Management also noted ongoing improvements in charge off and stable low delinquency rates with plans to expand into additional markets to increase marketing efforts throughout the year. Six total active accounts grew by nearly 2 million from Q1, up 2% for the quarter, reaching an all-time high of 438 million. Monthly active accounts also rose 2% year-onear to 226 million as the largest two-sided platform in the world continues to get bigger. Seven adjusted free cash flow came in at 66 656 million, well below street consensus of 100 1.62 billion. While a soft number caught the market off guard, management said this was simply due to timing shifts in working capital that are expected to reverse in the second half. More importantly, they reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to 7 billion with a B, implying a nearly 10% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Eight share repurchases totaled $1.5 billion for the quarter, bringing the trailing 12 month to total to $6 billion and reducing the share count by 7%. Your pi, your slice of the pie got 7% bigger without putting one new dollar of cash into the company. Management still expects to buy back $6 billion of stock this year, implying a buyback yield well over 8% at current prices with 13.7 billion in cash and investments versus 1.5 billion in debt. We think t\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nhere is  plenty of dry powder for management to ramp up repurchases if Mr. Market continues on one of his manic bouts. Nine management noted that recent talk of certain banks charging for access to customer data which triggered a sharp sell-off in the stock is immaterial to PayPal. They confirmed the company will not be impacted by any such pricing changes. 10 management raised fullear guidance now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.15 to $5.30 11 to 14% earnings growth compared to prior guidance of 495 to 510 6 to10% growth. Transaction margin dollars were also raised to a range of 15.35 billion to 155 5 to 6% growth versus previous guidance of four to 5% growth. They reaffirmed free cash flow estimates of 6 to 7 billion, share repurchases of 6 billion and capex of around a billion. This guidance still looks relatively conservative with the low end assuming up to a couple of points of decelerating in e-commerce spending, though management has seen no evidence thus far. Here are the key points from the earnings call highlighted in green. and uh you can go through those and quick Boeing update. Had a lot of companies report fantastic",
    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nLot of earnings noise this week. Tremendous amount of companies earnings. Some shot up and then reversed and then some shot down and then reversed higher, etc., etc. Short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. And what I wanted to do with all the noise is just kind of step back and take a look at the companies that have reported that we've talked about on this podcast and own some for clients. And personally, uh, Albamaro crushed it. Stock shot all the way up close to, you know, 90 and change, reversed a little bit, but if you zoom out, you can see it's starting its recovery and we are in the nent stages. So any weakness can be bought. Uh we'll be going through these uh this week. I think we're doing Intel and PayPal. We we can't do 10 companies in one call. We'll be here until the cows come home. Uh but if there's something urgent to talk about, I would uh Boeing again shot up. This thing has moved a lot. 135 to 230 in about, you know, four, five, six weeks. I think it's, you know, we we we told you a couple weeks back we took profits on all of our options which were up huge. Um and we've shaved a little bit of stock. Uh that's just to just because there are companies that haven't moved 100% that we wanted to get more of this week. Uh so we did a little just a tad of harvesting there, but um I could see us buying it back if it pulls back below 200. um but or just riding the rest of it and being perfectly happy because it's still a very sizable position. Baxter uh appears like it, you know, for lack of a better word, the bed. Uh not the case. That was what we call a kitchen sink quarter to clear the deck for the new CEO of uh Baxter who's coming in and we've covered many times in the podcast. This guy's a winner. Sevenbagger in his last company. He's going to turn this thing around. This is going to be easy peasy. this they they the deck is cleared with the spin-off with the right downs with everything else. Revenues are stable. This thing's going to be three, four, 5x. It's just going to be a matter of time. And now we got the right guy in doing it. I know everyone's running for cover. I'm telling you, I have never been so busy in the market in one day in probably since early April uh when the um uh liberation day when we were just buying everything under the sun in the whole. Well, today was one of those days between buying the out of uh Baxter, buying the out of VFC Corp, Intel. Um it was Christmas today and uh let's see. Back VF Corp, Intel, No. Uh National Oil Well, Varco. I mean, they were just giving stuff away today and we were like, \"Thank you very much.\" And what's so amazing is like you look on a daily, you're like, \"Oh, are these going to be okay?\" And then you look at the numbers, you're like, \"Of course they're going to be okay.\" And then you zoom out, which is what we do here and what we teach, and you look at the album. We even bought some album for a few clients that had a high higher basis. Um, trimmed some Boeing. Uh, actually trimmed a hair, a small hair of Generrack just to raise some cash because that's also run up huge from uh the low 100s to almost 200 in a few weeks. So, that's probably going to breathe. It's had two, three monster days here following earnings. Um, so but backter like this is what it does when it's flushing out where there's 2009 to 2011 uh 2001 to 2003 you get this initial down and then you get this rollover waterfall where everyone says it's over and then it just works its way back to new highs. Uh Crown Castle um that spiked up on earnings now it's resting a little bit. You could see the recovery is just beginning there. Uh, Cooper Standard. By the way, I thought today we were only allowed to get bad news until after hours when they took guidance up and the stock shot up to $29. We'll see if we get some follow through. It's broke into new highs there. Um, 2673 was the high after last earnings and um when he came on to our podcast um so now it's at new highs, highest levels since back in 2021. and next stop to take out is $48. So, uh, so let's see how that earnings call goes and the follow through and everything else uh going on. Comtock again, huge move from $7 to $30. Of course, it's going to retrace back to 17. Uh, we almost\nbought some today, but I think we' we'd like to see it get lower. If we could get it down to 15 again, we'd we'd load back up the truck for people that don't have enough. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nEtsy, great earnings. Stock shot up. So what happened is Powell again had to do Powell be his belligerent useless Fed chair self uh and um basically have a very hawkish meeting. So what you saw in the last two days is cyclicals which have been crushing it since the April bottom um got smacked uh yesterday because basically the policy that he was signaling implied that he's going to crash the economy because he's uh wants to stay restrictive and that's why you saw tech get bid they'll do better in a deflationary um uh higher unemployment environment, which is the policy path that he was signaling yesterday. It won't be executed because Trump is going to announce a shadow Fed and Powell is going to become a lame duck. I wouldn't actually be surprised if um they do wind up firing him because at, you know, $600 billion of unnecessary interest costs, uh it's reckless. It's bad for the taxpayers. It's bad for housing. It's bad for employment. You're seeing weak employment. this guy's got his head up his ass and he needs to go. So, um, so that's that. But again, one one Fed meeting, it makes zero difference to the recovery of these companies. It makes a big difference for the price movement, the short-term emotional voting machine over a few days after his meeting. But, as always, the first move is usually the wrong move. expect Trump to ratchet up the pressure and uh at the end of the day, love him or hate him, Trump always wins. This guy's going to be toast. Uh what he did yesterday was a step above being quote unquote data dependent. What he did was a big FU to the president and um uh that old that old dog don't hunt. That's not going to last very long. And you're going to see that ratchet up very very quickly as he as more and more public figures come out and belittle him and they start to put the dissenters on a pedestal and they start to get the spotlight and completely undermine Powell's belligerance. So, um, next week I'll tell you how I really feel about the meeting yesterday, but this week, uh, let's stick to the facts, which is Etsy, uh, again, just starting the recovery, shot up after earnings, retraced after Powell. Uh, that will all go away. Generrack huge move up here back to the highs that we saw earlier when we didn't take profits and it went back down to 99. This thing's going a lot higher, but we did trim. We we took a huge amount of options profits. We had some spreads that were up double double and a half. Uh we had uh some straight options that were up a lot uh and a few shares. But uh this is still a core position for us and we think it's going to ride a lot a lot higher. You can see this is just starting to recover. But we wanted some cash to buy the things that are down. Uh we bought some Intel of course we'll talk about today. again it's just in this bottoming process just like it did in 2009 just like it did in 2002 people are getting up in arms and we are buying the stock uh national oil well Varco same story you know you start to see the recovery then you get this bottoming fake out process and then you go straight up so this is just a fake out here we bought a ton more today uh PayPal same story this recovery is just starting another fake out here. Uh we'll go through those earnings. Stanley Black & Decker again, people bitching about that. This recovery is just starting. Same story. Complete flush out, little uncertainty, and then straight back to new highs. This time will be no different. I think the catalyst for that one is just Powell either needs to be undermined or needs to be removed. One of those two things is imminent. Um BF Corp, uh Bracken, unbelievable earnings. The stock shot up to $15. Then you had Powell open his big mouth and all the cyclicals got hit. So, uh, this was down. But, uh, Bracken did an amazing interview with Jim Kramer, which we're going to listen to in just a little bit, and he laid out the whole case. By the way, the one thing he said at the end is the most important thing he said of the whole thing. He's personally purchased over $3 million of stock. Uh which is kind of a rounding error compared to what we have, but um uh it's nice to see that's money he pulled out of his own pocket buying in the hole. We love that. This is the same type of bottoming process you saw in 20201, 2009, 2010. It's a cyclical thing. That's what these businesses do. And uh back off to the races. So this was a gift. Mana from Heaven, buying it till our fingers fell off today. And uh super excited and we had to raise the cash. You know, we we we have uh limits on um what we want to do and things that are doubles in, you know, two 3 months. They're they're going to take a breather. We use some cash. We'll probably buy some of that back, but but to not buy more at these levels, uh for the Stanley's, for the VF Corps, for the Intels, uh for the Baxters, for the Varcos, uh these gifts, these are kind of the last stop on the bus before you rock it to the moon. And uh we didn't want to miss it. So that's that. Uh the big story with Cooper to obviously next week, we'll be going into this very strongly. uh they took North American production guidance down. That's just numbers that they get from the industry rags. I think those are going to be too low. But despite taking production numbers way down uh to 14.9 million from industry, they were able to take adjusted Ibida up from their initial guidance midpoint of 217 a.5 all the way up to 235 midpoint. So almost another $20 million of IBIDA more than they expected. Uh and that's why I think you're seeing the stock up over 29. Would love to see it get a three handle in front in the next week. That would be amazing. VF Corp jumps after earnings beat as turnaround takes hold. Uh that was the case until Powell came out and shot his mouth off unnecessarily, but it's immaterial. I'm going to be sending him a Christmas card along with Xihinping. Uh thanking him for allowing us to get more VF Corp. Um that one will be a detailed one next week. So Jeff, we're doing um CPS, VFC, and probably Etsy next week. Generrack we don't have to cover because it went up. Uh oh no you need to do backs. So probably backter VF court CPS next. Um\n\nthe hole. We love that. This is the same type of bottoming process you saw in 20201, 2009, 2010. It's a cyclical thing. That's what these businesses do. And uh back off to the races. So this was a gift. Mana from Heaven, buying it till our fingers fell off today. And uh super excited and we had to raise the cash. You know, we we we have uh limits on um what we want to do and things that are doubles in, you know, two 3 months. They're they're going to take a breather. We use some cash. We'll probably buy some of that back, but but to not buy more at these levels, uh for the Stanley's, for the VF Corps, for the Intels, uh for the Baxters, for the Varcos, uh these gifts, these are kind of the last stop on the bus before you rock it to the moon. And uh we didn't want to miss it. So that's that's what we did. Uh the big story with Cooper to obviously next week, we'll be going into this very strongly. uh they took North American production guidance down. That's just numbers that they get from the industry rags. I think those are going to be too low. But despite taking production numbers way down uh to 14.9 million from industry, they were able to take adjusted Ibida up from their initial guidance midpoint of 217 a.5 all the way up to 235 midpoint. So almost another $20 million of IBIDA more than they expected. Uh and that's why I think you're seeing the stock up over 29. Would love to see it get a three handle in front in the next week. That would be amazing. VF Corp jumps after earnings beat as turnaround takes hold. Uh that was the case until Powell came out and shot his mouth off unnecessarily, but it's immaterial. I'm going to be sending him a Christmas card along with Xihinping. Uh thanking him for allowing us to get more VF Corp. Um that one will be a detailed one next week. So Jeff, we're doing um CPS, VFC, and probably Etsy next week. Generrack we don't have to cover because it went up. Uh oh no you need to do backs. So probably backter VF court CPS next. ### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nhere is  the interview of Brack and Daryl talks quarterly results with Jim Kramer on CNBC. >> Has VF Corp\n\n look, look, I think uh we don't have to be carart. We have to be we have to be the best Dickies we can possibly be. We haven't the last few years. Now the the trends on there are improving too. So the the there was a a turnaround to do there and it's it really dampened this quarter got in the single digits and I'm really optimistic about that business too. I've got a fantastic team there led by a super guy Chris goal out of GAP and he's brought in some just a superstar team there. So just like Sune at at uh Advance and Caroline Brown and Nina Flood I've got four really great big brand leaders now. >> All right. And then last thing and I know that you're dealing with the tariffs. you've been able to mitigate some, not all. Uh, how life-threatening is a tariff to VF court? >> Look, you know, the tariffs are are the great thing about the tariffs is that they tr they they treat everybody equally in our industry. Just everybody's kind of in the same boat. So, in an environment like that, we can deal with it. So, we're taking cost out, relocating factories, and we're raising prices. And we will manage it all as we go into 27. We'll manage it all. So that during 27 we'll offset all the tariffs between those three mechanisms. So it's not life-threatening. We will manage it. >> Well, if if you had to raise price is is the consumer strong enough to be able to take price. >> I think so. You know, we're going to do it very strategically. You know, and as I said, the good thing is you when you're looking at alternatives, you know, if everybody's raising price, and I suspect they will be in our industry because everybody's going to have the same cost increase, then it prices will go up. And then it comes back to let the best brands win. And we believe we have great brands. >> Well, I think your situation is Oh, God. I want to own the stock myself. Not allowed to, but I think it's really time for Brack and Daryl, president CEO of VFO. Brack, I love when you're on the show. Thanks very much. Thank you so much. >> Hey, Jim. I just have to say, you know, I now bought on my own. I've taken $3 million of my own money, one by one by one, and bought stock myself. So, I'm obviously more than just a believer. I'm I'm personally invested beyond what you normally get as a CEO. I like a CEO's all in with his own money rather than just having the shareholders give it to him just because it's much more real that way. Thank you, Bracken. Great to see you again. >> Thank you. >> That's Bracken Daryl, president CEO of VF Corp. And we're back. Uh then Baxter, as you can see here, complete kitchen sink quarter setting the table for the new CEO. We'll cover that one in detail next week. We were buyers today. You'll probably get another couple of days where you can buy the stock. Uh Andrew hitters coming in huge home run. Uh Seven Bagger Plus in his past thing healthc care business and uh this time will be no different. So we're excited about that. Generrack shot the lights out. Fantastic job. Res's crushing it. We'll cover that in detail. Now on to D. Now on to some data. After pandemic lull, Disney's operating profit is growing once again, poised to hit new highs. Most shorted stocks are beating the S&P 500. So short and small was the theme up till yesterday when Powell um came out aggressively hawkish as an FU to the president. Um I can assure you he will not be the one to have the last word. Uh and this trend is going to continue. But the outperformance of small and shorted was 11 percentage points greater than uh the S&P 500 i.e. mag 7 over that period. And uh I think the short-term interruption from yesterday is going to quickly resolve itself back to back to trend. Uh China's augmented budget deficit widens. They're they're stimulating. Here's some uh sellside stuff on Varco maintaining their price target at $20. Uh after earnings, GenerRack uh raising their price target to 210 opinion follows trend. Boeing raised the price target to $250. Uh Varco again different firm $190. QXO opinion follows trend target up to $33. uh Intel ref recovery roadmap roadmap taking shape uh we'll cover that one VF corp uh upside as return to topline growth comes into focus uh comtock uh here's UBS putting a sell on it of course the all the eur European banks are always the most bearish uh Varco they took it to $18 not concerned this is a cyclical play when it goes it gallops just like comtock Just like range. I love this is um gosh, do we have that mammoth cycle? Let's see. Mammoth stock market cycle. This is where we are on a lot of the names. is right here. So, we've gone through a lot of this on these names and now you get into a version where you get this final check back before you get to denial and it would break out. We're we're here right now on Cooper Standard. Okay, so we had that shoot up collapse. Now we're here and now we're breaking through. This is going to return in confidence. Um, PayPal, we're here. You can see it. Yeah. Take a look at this. PayPal basically right down here. Headed back up to denial and then straight up Baba. Same thing. This is perfect. Actually, if you look at BABA, people are so depressed about this. You can't even see the move in the last few weeks. So, you had all this there. Then you go up. Then you test it. You're right here. You're literally right here in denial. It's breaking out above this right here in denial. And then you're going to get returning confidence is where you get the parabolic move. They're all basically there. PayPal. Um, Baxter is probably down here somewhere. Baxter's right here. Max discouragement. Uh, let's take a look here. Generrack. [Music] It's going to be a longer call than I thought. Oh, this is perfect. Look at this. Look at this Generrack. It's just retesting that. It's right here. It's literally right here. So, this is what we're going to get is that this little pullback will probably reload before a next parabolic move. Then you got um VF Corp. Where's VF Corp? VF Corp is probably right down here. Perfect. The spike up and a test down. You're probably right. You might be here. You might be here or you might be here. But either way, I think you're probably here in a version Cooper Standard. [Music] It's just breaking out now. This is pretty amazing. Cooper Standards just breaking out. This is huge. Um I'm excited. Thank God for today. Thank god I was in front of the screens just just ready with my licking my chops and pressing the buy buttons on these that we had one more bite at the apple like the backers in discouragement the Intels's in discouragement the VF corpse in discouragement or aversion um what what else was there today. Dagio, Intel, Varco, Stanley. We bought some Stanley Black & Decker today. Stanley is probably I think it's right here. Let's take a look at Stanley. Boy, this is not how I expected the uh podcast to go today, but I'm having fun doing this. All right. So, you had this recovery and then a final flush and now it's starting to recover final flush. I think you're probably here probably somewhere between aversion and denial on Stanley Black & Decker. All right, so that's that. Let's get back to some data before we take any more tangents. But sometimes the tangents are where the best stuff is. All right. US firms exceed profit estimate estimates at strongest rate in four years. Earnings are going fine. Mainland China's capital inflows into Hong Kong have topped the last year's total. That game is on. They'll get a handshake picture with Trump. Stocks will go crazy. The earnings will support it. Off to the races. Growth in credit card spending. We need to relever the private sector, delever the public sector. Each component of speculating training indicator elevated versus history. Okay. So, we're seeing that this is what we talked about last week. [Music] This was a key point I wanted to cover. The reason I said last week, I said last week, you know, we're growing into a period. We've obviously had a huge move. Uh but I would not expect a big crash of 20%. you're at the most you're going to see during this weak seasonal period of August through October is 5 to 10% pullback to be bought and um and some volatility at the most and I and I wouldn't get too cute with it because there are too many people behind the benchmark that have to buy every single dip that got destroyed in April. Uh and that's why I would stay very constructive. The other reason why is that on average going back a 100red years the market gets a 20% plus uh intraear bare market correction every 4.2 years on average. We have now had three of those in the last 5 years in 2020 in 2022 and in 2025 peaked to trough about 20%. So, we've pulled forward something like 12 years of these uh 20% corrections in a matter of 5 years. Uh I think what you're going to see is a lot of recency bias uh thinking we're going right back to that and idiots on TV calling for a big crash in 2026. Yeah, it's a it's an election year. It tends to be choppy the midterm election years, etc. Fine. If we finish the last fourth quarter super strong, uh, of course you're going to get a pullback in probably February, March, and into the election. But, uh, I don't think we're going to get another 20% correction. We're kind of, uh, overused on that front. Um, I think the five or 10s are going to be perfect and they're going to be bought. Okay. Cyclical sector breath has weakened relative to defensive. Uh, defensives have been given away. defensives are the are the Backaxers of the world, the Diagios of the world, the Crown Castles of the world, um the Hormels of the world. I think those are going to start to get bid. I think people are underestimating those and that they probably get bid in the fall when when you start to see a little chop. AI boom drives largest US grid capacity cost to another record. Again, this is helping the Generax. This is helping the car the comm stocks over the long term. Commodity prices rally in July. Lithium Albamaro. Uh sharp increases in speculative trading typically signal above average short-term equity returns. So you've got um 36 months out. 12 months out you you tend to get another 12%. So that's that's your sweet spot is 12 months out which would make sense. And then you get a little weakness into that election. Chart of the week flows into cyclicals versus defensives. Cyclicals have gone straight up until yesterday's um sermon on the mount. Uh defensives have been left for dead. I think defensives get bid. Cyclicals may have to take a rest after that uh for a few weeks, but um that creates opportunity. Earnings growth expected to pick up in 2025. Uh those are starting to be revised upward. If you remember, we we're through the downgrading uh uh cycle. Technology versus consumer staples. I think you got to have some staples exposure. Whether it's Dagio, whether it's Baxter, whether it's uh um Horell, whether it's, you know, someone mentioned Clorox on the call. Uh these type of stocks. This is tech relative to defensives. I think uh I think this is going to shift pretty soon. uh at least in the short term. Lithium in China surges. So, Albamaro is I mean that that thing is going to just be you you're seeing it start to start to gallop. People can't believe it. It's going to gallop. Uh US firms exceed profit estimates at strongest rate in four years. Uh 46% of companies so far have expressed optimism. That's above average. MSCI China index return by year since 2010. Uh so year to date is is starting to perform. FINRA margin debt over the W Wilshire total market index. Uh this is pretty interesting. Margin debt relative to the index is near all-time lows. Uh similar to what you saw after the tech wreck, which you know implies there's there's again uh room for private sector releveraging and public sector dleveraging. And um the only way to delever the public sector is to run growth hot and run inflation above trend and uh have growth rise faster than interest cost as we've done it before in the past. Uh rally has more room to broaden out. We agree uh it's fits and starts can never take the first two days after Fed meeting serious. And I do think Trump is going to hit him right in the right in the solar plexes and and knock this knock the wind out of him. I think I think yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. There was no reason to be that hawkish. Um, okay. Growth sectors are outperforming, values outperforming in Europe. That's the last few weeks. A little bit of a divergence. Uh, US transmission power outages have become more frequent and grid reliability is worse today than in the early 2000s. You're seeing it in Generax results. average household would need 220% more electricity to go all electric. Online retail spending growth has generally outpaced services and overall retail spending growth throughout 2025. So far, uh relative strength versus the S&P 500 in the last year. Staples have been extremely weak relative to the&p 500. Staples and healthcare, that's where you're going to see some opportunity. Staples healthcare and real estate, I think that's where you're going to see some outperformance in the next 18 months. materials, same thing. Uh utilities, I I wouldn't get too interested in that. Financials, selective, I like uh discretionary, same thing. So, industrials have had a run. Um technologies had a run. So, you know, you've seen it in Generrack, you've seen it in Boeing. Um so, you know, probably short term they're going to have to consolidate those gains. there's just no two ways around it, which is why we did a little trimming, but nothing serious. Uh energy is where you're going to find opportunity. So, this is kind of where all the gains have come from. Unfortunately, we've had enough exposure and just crushed it the way we were positioned. But, uh now these that were positioned for where the puck is going are going to start to go as well, which we're excited for. Um, year-to- date sector performance. So, healthcare discretionary, energy, staples, worst performers, industrials, tech, utilities, comm services, best average S&P company, one-day reaction to earning misses. So, this has been the worst one-day earnings reaction to earnings misses. The average company down 5.2%. Um, the last time you saw that were the lows in Q3 2022. So, just keep that in mind that these companies that are getting hit the hardest, they're probably bottoming here because back here, this was when tech was getting hit the hardest. Down",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nLot of earnings noise this week. Tremendous amount of companies earnings. Some shot up and then reversed and then some shot down and then reversed higher, etc., etc. Short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. And what I wanted to do with all the noise is just kind of step back and take a look at the companies that have reported that we've talked about on this podcast and own some for clients. And personally, uh, Albamaro crushed it. Stock shot all the way up close to, you know, 90 and change, reversed a little bit, but if you zoom out, you can see it's starting its recovery and we are in the nent stages. So any weakness can be bought. Uh we'll be going through these uh this week. I think we're doing Intel and PayPal. We we can't do 10 companies in one call. We'll be here until the cows come home. Uh but if there's something urgent to talk about, I would uh Boeing again shot up. This thing has moved a lot. 135 to 230 in about, you know, four, five, six weeks. I think it's, you know, we we we told you a couple weeks back we took profits on all of our options which were up huge. Um and we've shaved a little bit of stock. Uh that's just to just because there are companies that haven't moved 100% that we wanted to get more of this week. Uh so we did a little just a tad of harvesting there, but um I could see us buying it back if it pulls back below 200. um but or just riding the rest of it and being perfectly happy because it's still a very sizable position. Baxter uh appears like it, you know, for lack of a better word, the bed. Uh not the case. That was what we call a kitchen sink quarter to clear the deck for the new CEO of uh Baxter who's coming in and we've covered many times in the podcast. This guy's a winner. Sevenbagger in his last company. He's going to turn this thing around. This is going to be easy peasy. this they they the deck is cleared with the spin-off with the right downs with everything else. Revenues are stable. This thing's going to be three, four, 5x. It's just going to be a matter of time. And now we got the right guy in doing it. I know everyone's running for cover. I'm telling you, I have never been so busy in the market in one day in probably since early April uh when the um uh liberation day when we were just buying everything under the sun in the whole. Well, today was one of those days between buying the out of uh Baxter, buying the out of VFC Corp, Intel. Um it was Christmas today and uh let's see. Back VF Corp, Intel, No. Uh National Oil Well, Varco. I mean, they were just giving stuff away today and we were like, \"Thank you very much.\" And what's so amazing is like you look on a daily, you're like, \"Oh, are these going to be okay?\" And then you look at the numbers, you're like, \"Of course they're going to be okay.\" And then you zoom out, which is what we do here and what we teach, and you look at the album. We even bought some album for a few clients that had a high higher basis. Um, trimmed some Boeing. Uh, actually trimmed a hair, a small hair of Generrack just to raise some cash because that's also run up huge from uh the low 100s to almost 200 in a few weeks. So, that's probably going to breathe. It's had two, three monster days here following earnings. Um, so but backter like this is what it does when it's flushing out where there's 2009 to 2011 uh 2001 to 2003 you get this initial down and then you get this rollover waterfall where everyone says it's over and then it just works its way back to new highs. Uh Crown Castle um that spiked up on earnings now it's resting a little bit. You could see the recovery is just beginning there. Uh, Cooper Standard. By the way, I thought today we were only allowed to get bad news until after hours when they took guidance up and the stock shot up to $29. We'll see if we get some follow through. It's broke into new highs there. Um, 2673 was the high after last earnings and um when he came on to our podcast um so now it's at new highs, highest levels since back in 2021. and next stop to take out is $48. So, uh, so let's see how that earnings call goes and the follow through and everything else uh going on. Comtock again, huge move from $7 to $30. Of course, it's going to retrace back to 17. Uh, we almost\nbought some today, but I think we' we'd like to see it get lower. If we could get it down to 15 again, we'd we'd load back up the truck for people that don't have enough. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nEtsy, great earnings. Stock shot up. So what happened is Powell again had to do Powell be his belligerent useless Fed chair self uh and um basically have a very hawkish meeting. So what you saw in the last two days is cyclicals which have been crushing it since the April bottom um got smacked uh yesterday because basically the policy that he was signaling implied that he's going to crash the economy because he's uh wants to stay restrictive and that's why you saw tech get bid they'll do better in a deflationary um uh higher unemployment environment, which is the policy path that he was signaling yesterday. It won't be executed because Trump is going to announce a shadow Fed and Powell is going to become a lame duck. I wouldn't actually be surprised if um they do wind up firing him because at, you know, $600 billion of unnecessary interest costs, uh it's reckless. It's bad for the taxpayers. It's bad for housing. It's bad for employment. You're seeing weak employment. this guy's got his head up his ass and he needs to go. So, um, so that's that. But again, one one Fed meeting, it makes zero difference to the recovery of these companies. It makes a big difference for the price movement, the short-term emotional voting machine over a few days after his meeting. But, as always, the first move is usually the wrong move. expect Trump to ratchet up the pressure and uh at the end of the day, love him or hate him, Trump always wins. This guy's going to be toast. Uh what he did yesterday was a step above being quote unquote data dependent. What he did was a big FU to the president and um uh that old that old dog don't hunt. That's not going to last very long. And you're going to see that ratchet up very very quickly as he as more and more public figures come out and belittle him and they start to put the dissenters on a pedestal and they start to get the spotlight and completely undermine Powell's belligerance. So, um, next week I'll tell you how I really feel about the meeting yesterday, but this week, uh, let's stick to the facts, which is Etsy, uh, again, just starting the recovery, shot up after earnings, retraced after Powell. Uh, that will all go away. Generrack huge move up here back to the highs that we saw earlier when we didn't take profits and it went back down to 99. This thing's going a lot higher, but we did trim. We we took a huge amount of options profits. We had some spreads that were up double double and a half. Uh we had uh some straight options that were up a lot uh and a few shares. But uh this is still a core position for us and we think it's going to ride a lot a lot higher. You can see this is just starting to recover. But we wanted some cash to buy the things that are down. Uh we bought some Intel of course we'll talk about today. again it's just in this bottoming process just like it did in 2009 just like it did in 2002 people are getting up in arms and we are buying the stock uh national oil well Varco same story you know you start to see the recovery then you get this bottoming fake out process and then you go straight up so this is just a fake out here we bought a ton more today uh PayPal same story this recovery is just starting another fake out here. Uh we'll go through those earnings. Stanley Black & Decker again, people bitching about that. This recovery is just starting. Same story. Complete flush out, little uncertainty, and then straight back to new highs. This time will be no different. I think the catalyst for that one is just Powell either needs to be undermined or needs to be removed. One of those two things is imminent. Um BF Corp, uh Bracken, unbelievable earnings. The stock shot up to $15. Then you had Powell open his big mouth and all the cyclicals got hit. So, uh, this was down. But, uh, Bracken did an amazing interview with Jim Kramer, which we're going to listen to in just a little bit, and he laid out the whole case. By the way, the one thing he said at the end is the most important thing he said of the whole thing. He's personally purchased over $3 million of stock. Uh which is kind of a rounding error compared to what we have, but um uh it's nice to see that's money he pulled out of his own pocket buying in the hole. We love that. This is the same type of bottoming process you saw in 20201, 2009, 2010. It's a cyclical thing. That's what these businesses do. And uh back off to the races. So this was a gift. Mana from Heaven, buying it till our fingers fell off today. And uh super excited and we had to raise the cash. You know, we we we have uh limits on um what we want to do and things that are doubles in, you know, two 3 months. They're they're going to take a breather. We use some cash. We'll probably buy some of that back, but but to not buy more at these levels, uh for the Stanley's, for the VF Corps, for the Intels, uh for the Baxters, for the Varcos, uh these gifts, these are kind of the last stop on the bus before you rock it to the moon. And uh we didn't want to miss it. So that's that. Uh the big story with Cooper to obviously next week, we'll be going into this very strongly. uh they took North American production guidance down. That's just numbers that they get from the industry rags. I think those are going to be too low. But despite taking production numbers way down uh to 14.9 million from industry, they were able to take adjusted Ibida up from their initial guidance midpoint of 217 a.5 all the way up to 235 midpoint. So almost another $20 million of IBIDA more than they expected. Uh and that's why I think you're seeing the stock up over 29. Would love to see it get a three handle in front in the next week. That would be amazing. VF Corp jumps after earnings beat as turnaround takes hold. Uh that was the case until Powell came out and shot his mouth off unnecessarily, but it's immaterial. I'm going to be sending him a Christmas card along with Xihinping. Uh thanking him for allowing us to get more VF Corp. Um that one will be a detailed one next week. So Jeff, we're doing um CPS, VFC, and probably Etsy next week. Generrack we don't have to cover because it went up. Uh oh no you need to do backs. So probably backter VF court CPS next. Um\n\nin the low 20s with uh Stanley Black & Decker with Varco in the twelves. I mean it was Christmas today. It was absolute Christmas selling the things that have had quick doubles and uh using it to buy the things that are going to be five, four, five, and six baggers. Uh that's what we do. ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS Boeing slashes losses as CEO touts our turnaround year. So now everyone's excited about Boeing. It's going to take a breather. Intel beats on revenue slashes foundry investments as CEO says no more blank checks. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. Albamaro post surprise second quarter profit on lithium demand sales surge. Etsy postsec quarter revenue beat amid higher spending on AI marketing. Disney stock is ready to rally after a lost decade. No one wanted it at 85. Everyone wants it at 120. Disney's fabulous four rock which means it probably takes a rest. Disney's fabulous four rockets to 100 million$18 million debut. Uh what's this one? This is Etsy. We'll cover that in detail next week I think or the week after. Fed risk a deflationary spiral by not cutting rates. These bond experts said this is a key headline, ladies and gentlemen. What I've been saying, Fed risks a deflationary spiral by not cutting rates. These bond experts said so-called Kindleberger spiral could materialize if capital flows dry up. Uh why is this not letting me in? Anyway, uh Fed hasn't seen a split like this in 30 years. The people dissenting Chris Waller and Michelle Bowman uh both dissenting against Powell. Jeffrey sees value small caps joining record US stocks rally. We agree. Value and small caps, how you doing? That's been the case the last eight weeks plus until yesterday, but that will resume. Stockpicking hedge funds may come back in market turbulence. Uh yes, sir. Uh US LG producers climb as EU agrees to $750 billion in energy purchases. Everyone thought they were going to gang up against the US and fall into China's arms. The exact opposite happened. Duh. Ignore the noise and follow the leader. ### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES Stock market and sentiment results . Intel update. So you can see here the stock is down because the fundamentals are down. In the short term, the market's a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine. It is weighing garbage fundamentals. Okay? Both on the weighing machine and the voting machine. But Lip Bhan is here to save the day, and we're going to discuss how. With Q2 earning season now in full swing, Intel was the first of our names to report earlier last week. Headline numbers were strong across the board. Revenue came in at 12.9 billion flat yearonear, beating consensus by nearly $1 billion. Let me repeat that. revenues beat consensus by a billion dollars, which means the downward spiral has stopped and now it's stabilizing and then it can start to recover and landing $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. So, not only did they beat by a billion, they were up $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. In fact, Q2 was the third straight quarter of revenue coming ahead of expectations. You could not tell that by the stock price and the short-term emotional voting machine. Earnings were weighed down by restructuring costs and onetime equipment impairment charges. Excluding those, Intel delivered EPS of 10 cents a share ahead of both prior guidance and consensus estimates of 1 cent a share. Not only that, but Q3 guidance held up well with revenue expected between 12.6 6 and 13.6 billion compared to the streets 12.66 billion. Keep in mind Q3 has historically posted high singledigit sequential growth. Current guidance implies -2 to plus 6% due to potential tariff pull forward. That sets a low bar for a beat if demand holds up. But despite the beat and solid guidance, shares fell by nearly 10% after the report. In our view, a gift from the gods. What spooked the market and continues to weigh on the stock comes down to the foundry business and the about face and strategies that Lip Bhutan is bringing to the table and rightfully so.\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nresults .

What spooked the market and continues to weigh on the stock comes down to the foundry business and the about face and strategies that Lip Bhutan is bringing to the table and rightfully so.\nHere is  what was added to the K 10 Q and what Lip Bhutan means by making it his top priority to quote become a more financially disciplined foundry. He did not say get out of the foundry business. He said, \"Become a more financially disciplined foundry.\" And quote, \"If we were able to secure a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A, our next generation semiconductor manufacturing process technology, we may pause. If we are okay, here I love this. Here we go. If we are unable to secure a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A, our next generation semiconductor manufacturing process technology, we may pause or discontinue our pursuit of next generation leading edge process technologies which may have significant strategic business, financial and operational and reputational risks and repercussions. This is a complete Uturn from Pat Gellinger's build it and they will come mentality. In Lip Bhutan's own words, quote, \"Over the past several years, the company invested too much too soon without adequate demand. Going forward, our investment in Intel 14A will be based on confirmed consumer commitments. There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense.\" He's now stewarding our capital the way we would steward our capital because he's got skin in the game. He wrote, you know, uh, uh, Bracken wrote a $3 million check for stock. Lip Bhutan wrote a $25 million personal check for stock. Okay. And the shift in strategy is being viewed as putting the foundry future in jeopardy, meaning without landing an external customer, no 14A, and no future Intel internal production. We have a much different take. The foundry business has been a cash incinerator for years, losing $3 billion this quarter alone with an operating margin of71.7%. There's no planet where that is sustainable. And Lip Bhutan has made it clear he is not willing to eat those losses forever. Until Intel sees external customers stepping up with volume commitments, they are scaling back the massive capex buildout. In other words, they are no longer the bag holders. And believe it or not, they actually have the leverage here. Intel is one of only three leading edge chip fabs left in the world. No company that is currently relying on the kindness of strangers for Advanced Foundry. Whether it's Nvidia, Amazon, or anyone else wants to have all their eggs in the TSMC basket. This is essentially a warning shot to engage and get serious or Intel will walk away from the foundry business. No company in their right mind wants that. At the same time, it doesn't hurt to have the US government as your co-investor and subsidizer chief. The government is committed to reducing dependence on Taiwan semiconductor monopoly and creating a duopoly with Intel. I wouldn't bet against the richest Treasury in the world to make that happen. Many bet against the government's commitment to EVs through Tesla subsidies. Ask them how that turned out. The fact of the matter is that the US cannot afford to let Intel struggle. And just last week, we got further confir confirmation with the AI action plan showing exactly how serious they are. Restore American semiconductor manufacturing. America must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US soil. Streamline regulations that slow semiconductor manufacturing efforts. Support nextgen manufacturing. Prioritize investment in these emerging technologies and usher a new industrial renaissance. uh chips and RD programs, etc. But again, while all the focus is on Foundry and reinventing the future, our original thesis has always been that AI and Foundry are just whipped cream on top. We believe continue to believe the legacy PC and service business server business, which makes up 60% of the sales, is worth $45 to $50 per share on its own. That gives us all the margin of safety we need and makes the short-term noise and uncertainty exactly that, just noise. People seem to forget that despite all of Intel's issues, they are still like they they are still like we like to call what we like to call the leader of mediocre chips. They continue to dominate market share in both PCs and servers with 70 to 80% share in the client market and 55% share in servers. This remains the core of our thesis and Lip Bhutan has made it clear that this is where the focus needs to be. They are fully committed to doubling down, engaging with customers early in the product cycle and winning back share. That is music to our ears. And let's not forget, we have a miracle worker at the helm in lip ban. The chart of Cadence Design Systems before and after he took over says everything you need to know. He stepped in after an 86% collapse in this cadence stock. Over the next 14 years, Cadence be became a 68 bagger. 68 bags. 1 million became 68 million by the time he left. Intel is his next turnaround project. And in his own words, he wants to quote pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations. So this is not only about money. This is about his final run legacy. If t\n\nRestore American semiconductor manufacturing. America must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US soil.

This is about his final run legacy. If there is  one person who can pull it off, it's Lip Banan. Lip Bhutan would have never taken the job if he didn't truly believe Intel could be turned around. He spent two years on the board before resigning. clearly in disagreement with Pat Gellzinger's spending spree and direction. The point is he knows the business inside and out and and the industry by the way and there are no surprises for him. He isn't chasing money. The only thing he's chasing is admission into the semiconductor CEO Hall of Fame. And if his track record wasn't enough, within 30 days of taking the job, he wrote a $25 million check out of his own pocket at a $24 cost basis. that puts you in at lower prices than Lip Bhutan. Uh, one of the best operators in the industry. Betting against Lip Boutan has never been a profitable trade and we don't think this time will be any different. Here's everything you need to know following Q2 earnings. You can go through that step by step. We highlighted all the important parts and the deck and the 10 key points. revenue of 12.9 billion beat consensus by roughly 1 billion and came in nearly 500 million uh above the high end of prior guidance. Intel products revenue reached 11.8 billion up slightly sequentially and ahead of expectations across both client and server segments. On the client side, demand continues to benefit from the co era PC refresh cycle with AIPCs representing a growing share of the mix. And in the server business, Granite Rapids is ramping as planned with hyperscalers continue to refresh their CPU installed base 2. Gross margins are expected to face near-term pressure due to the significant ramp up of Lunar Lake Q3 and Panther Lake later this year as cost per wafer remains high in the early stages. However, as volumes increase, management expect gross margins to expand into 2026, continue improving for several years. Management anticipates 40 to 60% fall through for gross margins next three next year leaning towards high-end if volume scale as expected. Three, management remains on track to achieve 2025 operating expense target of 17 billion with plans to reduce opex further to 16 billion next year. Four, 18A reached a mile key milestone at the start of production wafers in Arizona and remains on track for introduction by the end of 2025. It will serve as the foundation for at least the next three generations of Intel client and server products. Most importantly, management continues to expect reasonable returns on investment from Intel products alone. However, as 18A ramps up to high volume, management expects to be in a stronger position to attract external customers as performance yields improve, driving very strong returns over the long term. Five, the first Panther Lake processor SKU remains on track to begin shipping later this year with additional SKUs coming in the first half of 2026. Six, Intel Foundry revenue rose 3% year-over-year to 4.4 4 billion but continues to bleed significant cash posting an operating loss of 3.2 billion up from a 2.8 billion LA uh loss a year ago. Lip Bhutan's top priority is becoming more financially disciplined foundry scaling back capex until there are firm consumer customer volume commitments for 14A as part of this shift. Intel canceled manufacturing products in Germany and Poland and slowed construction in Ohio to better align with market demand. Seven management announced additional layoffs building on the 15% reduction announced last quarter with the target of cutting headcount by to 75,000 employees by year end. That compares to a peak of 132,000 under Gellzinger with most of the reduction already complete. As a result, the company has eliminated 50% of management layers and remains on track to implement its return to office mandate beginning in September. Can you believe it's 2025 and they're just now doing a return to office mandate? Like you can't make this stuff up. Capital expenditures for the full year are expected to total 18 billion, 5 billion below the original guidance set at the start of the year. Management noted that maintenance capex accounts for about half of the current level or roughly 9 billion and expects both growth gross and net capex to decline further in 2026. Deleveraging the balance sheet is top priority in 2025. Management raised 922 million through the mobile eye offering in July and is on track to complete the 4.46 billion sale of Alther Altera stake in Q3. Additional opportunities to monetize non-core assets is also under review. And 10 Q3 guidance includes a revenue range of 12.6 to 13.6 billion down uh 210 of 1% year-on-year gross margins of 36% up 18 basis points and EPS of flat up 46 cents year. Revenue guidance assumes prior quarters benefited from tariff pull forward with management conservatively projecting growth of -2% to plus 6%. Traditionally, Q3 sees high singledigit sequential growth, setting a low bar if demand holds up. So, here are the key things from the earnings call. We've highlighted in green what you need to know. And now on to PayPal. Again, just pulling up the mammoth cycle here. This is um dispondency. Looks like we're now in aversion. So, this would be uh rather discouragement, anxiety. We got up to at $90 93. Then back to 55. We were in aversion. Now we're getting back up to denial before we bust out to the parabolic move. Going back to the mammoth cycle. If you're not watching this on YouTube, um I would highly encourage that you will get four times as much value. But if you can only do it listening, it's better than nothing. Uh so here you can see cash flow near record all-time high, price near record all-time low. Certainly in the last 10 years, revenues continue to reach records. Uh return on invested capital is accelerating up to low double digits from high single digits. Gross margins are starting to reacelerate. PE is near record low. Price to free cash flow near record low. Uh uh balance sheet is better than ever. free cash flow per share is double what it was a few years ago. Common shares outstanding uh has come down about uh looks like about 15% over the last 3 four years. Uh revenues up a third since 2021. PayPal delivered another lights out quarter this week. revenue of 8.3 billion up 5.1% yearonear beat consensus by 220 million while non-GAAP EPS of 140 came in 10 cents ahead of expectations management also raised fullear EPS guidance to 515 from uh to 530 from 495 to 5 to 510 and lifted fullyear transaction margin dollars essentially gross profit to 51 15.35 to 15.5 billion from prior guidance of 15.2 2 to 15.4. Going through the earnings call, it is hard to find anything not to like. The highlight color is overwhelmingly green. The one soft spot was adjusted free cash flow with ca which came in at just 656 million, down 42% year-onear and well below the 1.62 billion the street expected. In typical shoot first ask\n\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquestions  later fashion. That was not enough for Mr. Market. Uh that was enough for Mr. market to send the stock down by nearly 10%. That sell-off looks even sillier when you realize the slowdown was entirely due to timing shifts in working capital, not any slowdown in the business or permanent impairment. These effects are expected to reverse in the second half if you are an investor and not a trader. The only number that should matter is management reaffirmed fullear free cash flow guidance of six to7 billion this machine spits out of cash uh in the year which is just mind-boggling which implies a nearly 10% free cash flow yield at the midpoint to be sure sell the stock because free cash flow is lumpy be which has long been the norm for PayPal to those who saw saw these results, listened to the call, and still decided to sell. We will gladly be mailing you Christmas cards for the next few years. Uh, we already knew Alex Chris was a winner based on what he accomplishment leading the small business group at into it, but each quarter continues to raise our confidence even higher. Remember, short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. I've built my career on finding opportunities where price disconnects from improving fundamentals. And when investors are bending over backwards to find reasons to sell, just know that dispondency tends to revert to euphoria. That flip might be closer than anyone realizes. We'll be happy to return the early Christmas favor and hand out some shares when the stock is trading well over $150. Here's everything you need to know following the results. You can go through this profitable growth is greater than empty calories. You can see this lumpy cash flow 6 to7 billion years. Uh all these decks we highlighted the important things. Go through it. Here are the 10 key points. Number one, PayPal posted its sixth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with transaction margin dollars reaching 3.8 84 billion, up 7% yearonear, 8% excluding interest on customer balances. Transaction margin rose to 46.4% up 62 basis points yearon year. Declining transaction margin dollar growth had always been central to the bare case with drops of 3% in 2022 and negative 5% in 2023. Alex Chris has flipped that on its head, delivering 5% growth in 2024 and guiding for another 5 to 6% growth in 2025 and targeting high singledigit growth by 2027 with a long-term ambition of 10%. Two, Venmo posted revenue growth over 20%, its highest since 2023. Total payment volume grew 12% during the quarter, accelerating quarter over-arter to the fastest rate in three years. Pay with Venmo total payment volume grew more than 45% while monthly active accounts for the Venmo's debit card rose over 40%. These debit card users have some of the most attractive economics in the ecosystem with both Venmo and PayPal debit card users showing 6x the transaction activity and 3x the average revenue per account. We have always said Venmo is a verb and when Alex Chris took over, there were real doubts about whether Venmo could return to growth. Fast forward today, it's on track for well over $2 billion in revenue by 2027 and just getting started. Three, one of the most important pivots in strategy under Alex Chris has been choosing profitable growth over what he called empty calorie revenues, aka firing unprofitable PSP. Brainree customers as expected. Brainree total payment volume growth has slowed dramatically posting just 2% for the past two quarters down from 18% a year ago with PSP consistently making up over 40% of total payment volume. The shift created short-term revenue headwind of roughly 5% in recent quarters. The good news is that not only have transaction margin dollars improved meaningfully, but the business has also reached an inflection point. Management expects break brain-free total payment volume to reacelerate in the second half of the year and beyond following peak pressure from contract renegotiations and the removal of low margin volumes. Just take a look at this inflection for online branded checkout grew 5% year-on-year. A slight deceleration from 6% growth in the prior quarter and one of the few soft spot uh soft spots in the report. The slowdown was driven by weakness in tariff impacted regions such as Asia-based marketplaces. Without that pressure, growth would have held steady at 6%. The good news is that softness has already stabilized in Q3. Management continues to guide for fullear growth in the mid single digits with improvement expected over the coming quarters and a path to 8 to 10% growth by 2027. This is largely driven by continued adoption of the new checkout experience which made up 30% of US branded as of February 2025 and has already reached over 60% on track to exceed 80% of global transactions by 2027. Five, buy now pay later continues to accelerate and with volume growth of more than 20% and monthly active accounts up 18% outpacing the overall market as PayPal gains share in the space. These customers bring highly attractive economics with average order value more than 80% higher than a standard checkout transaction. Management also noted ongoing improvements in charge off and stable low delinquency rates with plans to expand into additional markets to increase marketing efforts throughout the year. Six total active accounts grew by nearly 2 million from Q1, up 2% for the quarter, reaching an all-time high of 438 million. Monthly active accounts also rose 2% year-onear to 226 million as the largest two-sided platform in the world continues to get bigger. Seven adjusted free cash flow came in at 66 656 million, well below street consensus of 100 1.62 billion. While a soft number caught the market off guard, management said this was simply due to timing shifts in working capital that are expected to reverse in the second half. More importantly, they reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to 7 billion with a B, implying a nearly 10% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Eight share repurchases totaled $1.5 billion for the quarter, bringing the trailing 12 month to total to $6 billion and reducing the share count by 7%. Your pi, your slice of the pie got 7% bigger without putting one new dollar of cash into the company. Management still expects to buy back $6 billion of stock this year, implying a buyback yield well over 8% at current prices with 13.7 billion in cash and investments versus 1.5 billion in debt. We think t\n\nplenty of dry powder for management to ramp up repurchases if Mr. Market continues on one of his manic bouts. Nine management noted that recent talk of certain banks charging for access to customer data which triggered a sharp sell-off in the stock is immaterial to PayPal. They confirmed the company will not be impacted by any such pricing changes. 10 management raised fullear guidance now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.15 to $5.30 11 to 14% earnings growth compared to prior guidance of 495 to 510 6 to10% growth. Transaction margin dollars were also raised to a range of 15.35 billion to 155 5 to 6% growth versus previous guidance of four to 5% growth. They reaffirmed free cash flow estimates of 6 to 7 billion, share repurchases of 6 billion and capex of around a billion. This guidance still looks relatively conservative with the low end assuming up to a couple of points of decelerating in e-commerce spending, though management has seen no evidence thus far.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquick Boeing update. But just to hit on a few quick points of Boeing, if you wanted to see a textbook example, dispondency reverting to Euphoria, look no further than Boeing. Just a few months you couldn't give away the stock in the early 130s. We were on an island saying that we were bullish and got looked at like we had three heads. Now it's at 225 and it's all anyone wants to talk about. As for Q2, it all comes to two words. Kelly Ortberg in his own words, 2025 is Boeing's turnaround year. We could not agree more. As we always say, the number one thing you want to see in a turnaround is free cash flow, especially for a company like Boeing. And they absolutely delivered adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was a usage of 200 million compared to consensus estimates of a $1.8 billion usage and a year ago figure of4.3 billion. Management now sees a usage of just three billion as a reasonable fullear target compared to prior guidance of four to five billion cash burn. Most importantly, the long-term 10 billion of free cash flow target remains intact. That free cash flow is being powered by a business firing on all cylinders. Boeing recorded the highest number of deliveries in both Q2 and the first half of the year since 2018 along with its strongest quarterly revenue in six years. Meanwhile, the 737 program is now running at a production rate of 38 per month and is expected to climb to 42 in the months ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, this thing is going higher. It probably consolidates in the short term. Uh many thanks to Kelly Ortberg for his miracle work in progress. An amazing run we've had in the last couple of months.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nGeneral market. Um a little bit elevated. Active investment managers taking some risk off. Uh again, I think it's more of a sideways chop than it's going to be any material corrections beyond a five normal five to healthy 5 to 10% pullback. NASDAQ top 30 weights earnings estimates went up for this year by almost 1% and next year by 1.14%. Dow same thing earnings are going up 1.25% this year. Uh 56 basis points next year that's top 30.

    "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nHas VF Corp finally gotten its groove back? This program apparel company, you know, is maybe Vans or Northace. Timberland report a magnificent quarter this morning. The stocks at least shot up 3% today, though was up much more than earlier. Here's a stock that's been a real dog for a long time, frankly. But two years ago, the board brought in Bracken Daryl, formerly the CEO of Logitech, to turn things around. And now it looks like he's starting to pull it off. Earlier today, we spoke with Bracken Daryl, the president CEO of VF Corp. We are going to go over what I think is one of the most controversial stories that shouldn't be. It shouldn't be because we have Bracken Daryl who's in charge of it. So, it's only just a matter of time.\n\nSo I'm going to ask you, can Vans be turned around in the next year? >> You know, Vans is going to be turned around and it's I'm not giving you exact time frame, but Vans is absolutely going to be turned around. We've got green shoes at the very top. You know, we've got at this year's uh this year's Paris Fashion Week was just last month, there were probably more skatike shoes there than than have been in a decade. And and you know, these these trends start at the top. So, there's really good luxury trends in our stores. We're we're overpopulating with premium product. The Oxford Street store in London, the Fifth Avenue store in New York. So, I see the green shoots, too, and it's and it feels good. >> Well, let me just ask you, uh, why has it been so hard? What happened to make what I regard as being a premium exciting brand into a brand that's really seemed to be even for you a not easy turn? You know, there are three things that really happened there. First, we the innovation pipeline got very stale. they just didn't launch new products. And then the second thing was they really overextended into value doors with those same shoes that were going very very broad. They look the same, we're the same. So we just overdid it with with a couple of styles and then the marketing got stale. So So those three things though we were really reversing engines. So it's taken longer because we've had to really reset the distribution. So we've pulled back on value doors. We've reduced the scope of what we're selling in there. We've reduced our own number of doors by about almost 20%. Um and and you know the the net effect of all that is it's just a it's a slower turn in this industry. It takes time to get new products out. So we've got a great team though, a super leader and we're we're going to be a machine rolling out new products over the over the next year and year and a half.\n\nIn the interim it is very telling that Northace remains not only a premium brand but one that has gotten very exciting again. It never lost it in Europe. I think the people in Europe are just always very exciting about it. But United States which has been of course an obviously important market seems to have caught fire. So give us a sense of where Northace is now. >> You know Northace is as you said it's always been a terrific brand. It really stands for exploration. You know that's appealing to everybody. What we're doing now is we're we're continuing to innovate in the core business but we're also bringing out more and more footwear. our bags and packs business which is one of the oldest part. Both those segments of the business grew to over 20% globally and we're we're just going to keep pouring it on and we've got so many opportunities in just bringing out more product for the spring and summer as we go into next spring and summer. So there's a lot of opportunity on Northace globally. >> All right. Now, uh Timberland, it seems very exciting. A 9% growth. This is a brand that we remember as being fantastic. Then it got small. Can it get big again? >> I think so. Oh, I mean, I think really Timberland is is one of our one of those brands for us that is the brand itself is so much bigger than the business, you know, and and the the potential, you know, we've really caught fire on the yellow boot, as you said, but we've also got really clear signs that the boat shoe, remember those boat shoes that we used to wear when we were kids? Those are starting to pick up steam again, especially in Europe and even here in the US. And we're really working hard to fuel both those engines and then bring on more and more new products and more and more apparel. So, we've got a lot of opportunities in Timberland, too.\n\nI always feel old when I do that, but Altra people are I thought it was like a I thought it was like a cigarette. Altra is a hot shoe. >> It's about as far from the cigarette as you can get. It's It's the best trail running shoe you can buy. It's the biggest actually in trail running. We're tied for number one in trail running. We're also moving up fast. the fastest growing of the top eight shoes in or eight eight brands in road running, believe it or not. And it's gone from about, you know, $60 million we bought it to about 250 this year. Should be 250 or 250 plus this year. So, it's really on fire. It's a great shoe. Has a unique point of difference. This wide toe box that's really healthier for your foot. So, the people get in it are hooked. And here's the really unbelievable thing. It's a $250 million business at run rate with less than 10% awareness in the US. And probably that's aided awareness meaning have you ever heard of Altra? And so people like you like 90% of people like and and outside the US it's even smaller. So we can scale this business.",
    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\n look, look, I think uh we don't have to be carart. We have to be we have to be the best Dickies we can possibly be. We haven't the last few years. Now the the trends on there are improving too. So the the there was a a turnaround to do there and it's it really dampened this quarter got in the single digits and I'm really optimistic about that business too. I've got a fantastic team there led by a super guy Chris goal out of GAP and he's brought in some just a superstar team there. So just like Sune at at uh Advance and Caroline Brown and Nina Flood I've got four really great big brand leaders now. >> All right. And then last thing and I know that you're dealing with the tariffs. you've been able to mitigate some, not all. Uh, how life-threatening is a tariff to VF court? >> Look, you know, the tariffs are are the great thing about the tariffs is that they tr they they treat everybody equally in our industry. Just everybody's kind of in the same boat. So, in an environment like that, we can deal with it. So, we're taking cost out, relocating factories, and we're raising prices. And we will manage it all as we go into 27. We'll manage it all. So that during 27 we'll offset all the tariffs between those three mechanisms. So it's not life-threatening. We will manage it. >> Well, if if you had to raise price is is the consumer strong enough to be able to take price. >> I think so. You know, we're going to do it very strategically. You know, and as I said, the good thing is you when you're looking at alternatives, you know, if everybody's raising price, and I suspect they will be in our industry because everybody's going to have the same cost increase, then it prices will go up. And then it comes back to let the best brands win. And we believe we have great brands. >> Well, I think your situation is Oh, God. I want to own the stock myself. Not allowed to, but I think it's really time for Brack and Daryl, president CEO of VFO. Brack, I love when you're on the show. Thanks very much. Thank you so much. >> Hey, Jim. I just have to say, you know, I now bought on my own. I've taken $3 million of my own money, one by one by one, and bought stock myself. So, I'm obviously more than just a believer. I'm I'm personally invested beyond what you normally get as a CEO. I like a CEO's all in with his own money rather than just having the shareholders give it to him just because it's much more real that way. Thank you, Bracken. Great to see you again. >> Thank you. >> That's Bracken Daryl, president CEO of VF Corp. And we're back. Uh then Baxter, as you can see here, complete kitchen sink quarter setting the table for the new CEO. We'll cover that one in detail next week. We were buyers today. You'll probably get another couple of days where you can buy the stock. Uh Andrew hitters coming in huge home run. Uh Seven Bagger Plus in his past thing healthc care business and uh this time will be no different. So we're excited about that. Generrack shot the lights out. Fantastic job. Res's crushing it. We'll cover that in detail. Now on to D. Now on to some data. After pandemic lull, Disney's operating profit is growing once again, poised to hit new highs. Most shorted stocks are beating the S&P 500. So short and small was the theme up till yesterday when Powell um came out aggressively hawkish as an FU to the president. Um I can assure you he will not be the one to have the last word. Uh and this trend is going to continue. But the outperformance of small and shorted was 11 percentage points greater than uh the S&P 500 i.e. mag 7 over that period. And uh I think the short-term interruption from yesterday is going to quickly resolve itself back to back to trend. Uh China's augmented budget deficit widens. They're they're stimulating. Here's some uh sellside stuff on Varco maintaining their price target at $20. Uh after earnings, GenerRack uh raising their price target to 210 opinion follows trend. Boeing raised the price target to $250. Uh Varco again different firm $190. QXO opinion follows trend target up to $33. uh Intel ref recovery roadmap roadmap taking shape uh we'll cover that one VF corp uh upside as return to topline growth comes into focus uh comtock uh here's UBS putting a sell on it of course the all the eur European banks are always the most bearish uh Varco they took it to $18 not concerned this is a cyclical play when it goes it gallops just like comtock Just like range. I love this is um gosh, do we have that mammoth cycle? Let's see. Mammoth stock market cycle. This is where we are on a lot of the names. is right here. So, we've gone through a lot of this on these names and now you get into a version where you get this final check back before you get to denial and it would break out. We're we're here right now on Cooper Standard. Okay, so we had that shoot up collapse. Now we're here and now we're breaking through. This is going to return in confidence. Um, PayPal, we're here. You can see it. Yeah. Take a look at this. PayPal basically right down here. Headed back up to denial and then straight up Baba. Same thing. This is perfect. Actually, if you look at BABA, people are so depressed about this. You can't even see the move in the last few weeks. So, you had all this there. Then you go up. Then you test it. You're right here. You're literally right here in denial. It's breaking out above this right here in denial. And then you're going to get returning confidence is where you get the parabolic move. They're all basically there. PayPal. Um, Baxter is probably down here somewhere. Baxter's right here. Max discouragement. Uh, let's take a look here. Generrack. [Music] It's going to be a longer call than I thought. Oh, this is perfect. Look at this. Look at this Generrack. It's just retesting that. It's right here. It's literally right here. So, this is what we're going to get is that this little pullback will probably reload before a next parabolic move. Then you got um VF Corp. Where's VF Corp? VF Corp is probably right down here. Perfect. The spike up and a test down. You're probably right. You might be here. You might be here or you might be here. But either way, I think you're probably here in a version Cooper Standard. [Music] It's just breaking out now. This is pretty amazing. Cooper Standards just breaking out. This is huge. Um I'm excited. Thank God for today. Thank god I was in front of the screens just just ready with my licking my chops and pressing the buy buttons on these that we had one more bite at the apple like the backers in discouragement the Intels's in discouragement the VF corpse in discouragement or aversion um what what else was there today. Dagio, Intel, Varco, Stanley. We bought some Stanley Black & Decker today. Stanley is probably I think it's right here. Let's take a look at Stanley. Boy, this is not how I expected the uh podcast to go today, but I'm having fun doing this. All right. So, you had this recovery and then a final flush and now it's starting to recover final flush. I think you're probably here probably somewhere between aversion and denial on Stanley Black & Decker. All right, so that's that. Let's get back to some data before we take any more tangents. But sometimes the tangents are where the best stuff is. All right. US firms exceed profit estimate estimates at strongest rate in four years. Earnings are going fine. Mainland China's capital inflows into Hong Kong have topped the last year's total. That game is on. They'll get a handshake picture with Trump. Stocks will go crazy. The earnings will support it. Off to the races. Growth in credit card spending. We need to relever the private sector, delever the public sector. Each component of speculating training indicator elevated versus history. Okay. So, we're seeing that this is what we talked about last week. [Music] This was a key point I wanted to cover. The reason I said last week, I said last week, you know, we're growing into a period. We've obviously had a huge move. Uh but I would not expect a big crash of 20%. you're at the most you're going to see during this weak seasonal period of August through October is 5 to 10% pullback to be bought and um and some volatility at the most and I and I wouldn't get too cute with it because there are too many people behind the benchmark that have to buy every single dip that got destroyed in April. Uh and that's why I would stay very constructive. The other reason why is that on average going back a 100red years the market gets a 20% plus uh intraear bare market correction every 4.2 years on average. We have now had three of those in the last 5 years in 2020 in 2022 and in 2025 peaked to trough about 20%. So, we've pulled forward something like 12 years of these uh 20% corrections in a matter of 5 years. Uh I think what you're going to see is a lot of recency bias uh thinking we're going right back to that and idiots on TV calling for a big crash in 2026. Yeah, it's a it's an election year. It tends to be choppy the midterm election years, etc. Fine. If we finish the last fourth quarter super strong, uh, of course you're going to get a pullback in probably February, March, and into the election. But, uh, I don't think we're going to get another 20% correction. We're kind of, uh, overused on that front. Um, I think the five or 10s are going to be perfect and they're going to be bought. Okay.

Cyclicals have gone straight up until yesterday's um sermon on the mount. Uh defensives have been left for dead. I think defensives get bid. Cyclicals may have to take a rest after that uh for a few weeks, but um that creates opportunity. Earnings growth expected to pick up in 2025. Uh those are starting to be revised upward.

Whether it's Dagio, whether it's Baxter, whether it's uh um Horell, whether it's, you know, someone mentioned Clorox on the call. Uh these type of stocks. This is tech relative to defensives. I think uh I think this is going to shift pretty soon. uh at least in the short term. Lithium in China surges. So, Albamaro is I mean that that thing is going to just be you you're seeing it start to start to gallop. People can't believe it. It's going to gallop.

Uh so year to date is is starting to perform. FINRA margin debt over the W Wilshire total market index. Uh this is pretty interesting. Margin debt relative to the index is near all-time lows. Uh similar to what you saw after the tech wreck, which you know implies there's there's again uh room for private sector releveraging and public sector dleveraging. And um the only way to delever the public sector is to run growth hot and run inflation above trend and uh have growth rise faster than interest cost as we've done it before in the past. Uh rally has more room to broaden out. We agree uh it's fits and starts can never take the first two days after Fed meeting serious. And I do think Trump is going to hit him right in the right in the solar plexes and and knock this knock the wind out of him. I think I think yesterday was the straw that broke the camel's back. There was no reason to be that hawkish. Um, okay. Growth sectors are outperforming, values outperforming in Europe. That's the last few weeks. A little bit of a divergence. Uh, US transmission power outages have become more frequent and grid reliability is worse today than in the early 2000s. You're seeing it in Generax results. average household would need 220% more electricity to go all electric. Online retail spending growth has generally outpaced services and overall retail spending growth throughout 2025. So far, uh relative strength versus the S&P 500 in the last year. Staples have been extremely weak relative to the&p 500. Staples and healthcare, that's where you're going to see some opportunity. Staples healthcare and real estate, I think that's where you're going to see some outperformance in the next 18 months. materials, same thing. Uh utilities, I I wouldn't get too interested in that. Financials, selective, I like uh discretionary, same thing. So, industrials have had a run. Um technologies had a run. So, you know, you've seen it in Generrack, you've seen it in Boeing. Um so, you know, probably short term they're going to have to consolidate those gains. there's just no two ways around it, which is why we did a little trimming, but nothing serious. Uh energy is where you're going to find opportunity. So, this is kind of where all the gains have come from. Unfortunately, we've had enough exposure and just crushed it the way we were positioned. But, uh now these that were positioned for where the puck is going are going to start to go as well, which we're excited for. Um, year-to- date sector performance. So, healthcare discretionary, energy, staples, worst performers, industrials, tech, utilities, comm services, best average S&P company, one-day reaction to earning misses. So, this has been the worst one-day earnings reaction to earnings misses. The average company down 5.2%. Um, the last time you saw that were the lows in Q3 2022. So, just keep that in mind that these companies that are getting hit the hardest, they're probably bottoming here because back here, this was when tech was getting hit the hardest. Down",
    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\n look, look, I think uh we don't have to be carart. We have to be we have to be the best Dickies we can possibly be. We haven't the last few years. Now the the trends on there are improving too. So the the there was a a turnaround to do there and it's it really dampened this quarter got in the single digits and I'm really optimistic about that business too. I've got a fantastic team there led by a super guy Chris goal out of GAP and he's brought in some just a superstar team there. So just like Sune at at uh Advance and Caroline Brown and Nina Flood I've got four really great big brand leaders now. >> All right. And then last thing and I know that you're dealing with the tariffs. you've been able to mitigate some, not all. Uh, how life-threatening is a tariff to VF court? >> Look, you know, the tariffs are are the great thing about the tariffs is that they tr they they treat everybody equally in our industry. Just everybody's kind of in the same boat. So, in an environment like that, we can deal with it. So, we're taking cost out, relocating factories, and we're raising prices. And we will manage it all as we go into 27. We'll manage it all. So that during 27 we'll offset all the tariffs between those three mechanisms. So it's not life-threatening. We will manage it. >> Well, if if you had to raise price is is the consumer strong enough to be able to take price. >> I think so. You know, we're going to do it very strategically. You know, and as I said, the good thing is you when you're looking at alternatives, you know, if everybody's raising price, and I suspect they will be in our industry because everybody's going to have the same cost increase, then it prices will go up. And then it comes back to let the best brands win. And we believe we have great brands. >> Well, I think your situation is Oh, God. I want to own the stock myself. Not allowed to, but I think it's really time for Brack and Daryl, president CEO of VFO. Brack, I love when you're on the show. Thanks very much. Thank you so much. >> Hey, Jim. I just have to say, you know, I now bought on my own. I've taken $3 million of my own money, one by one by one, and bought stock myself. So, I'm obviously more than just a believer. I'm I'm personally invested beyond what you normally get as a CEO. I like a CEO's all in with his own money rather than just having the shareholders give it to him just because it's much more real that way. Thank you, Bracken. Great to see you again. >> Thank you. >> That's Bracken Daryl, president CEO of VF Corp. And we're back. Uh then Baxter, as you can see here, complete kitchen sink quarter setting the table for the new CEO. We'll cover that one in detail next week. We were buyers today. You'll probably get another couple of days where you can buy the stock. Uh Andrew hitters coming in huge home run. Uh Seven Bagger Plus in his past thing healthc care business and uh this time will be no different. So we're excited about that. Generrack shot the lights out. Fantastic job. Res's crushing it. We'll cover that in detail. Now on to D. Now on to some data. After pandemic lull, Disney's operating profit is growing once again, poised to hit new highs. Most shorted stocks are beating the S&P 500. So short and small was the theme up till yesterday when Powell um came out aggressively hawkish as an FU to the president. Um I can assure you he will not be the one to have the last word. Uh and this trend is going to continue. But the outperformance of small and shorted was 11 percentage points greater than uh the S&P 500 i.e. mag 7 over that period. And uh I think the short-term interruption from yesterday is going to quickly resolve itself back to back to trend. Uh China's augmented budget deficit widens. They're they're stimulating. Here's some uh sellside stuff on Varco maintaining their price target at $20. Uh after earnings, GenerRack uh raising their price target to 210 opinion follows trend. Boeing raised the price target to $250. Uh Varco again different firm $190. QXO opinion follows trend target up to $33. uh Intel ref recovery roadmap roadmap taking shape uh we'll cover that one VF corp uh upside as return to topline growth comes into focus uh comtock uh here's UBS putting a sell on it of course the all the eur European banks are always the most bearish uh Varco they took it to $18 not concerned this is a cyclical play when it goes it gallops just like comtock Just like range. I love this is um gosh, do we have that mammoth cycle? Let's see. Mammoth stock market cycle. This is where we are on a lot of the names. is right here. So, we've gone through a lot of this on these names and now you get into a version where you get this final check back before you get to denial and it would break out. We're we're here right now on Cooper Standard. Okay, so we had that shoot up collapse. Now we're here and now we're breaking through. This is going to return in confidence. Um, PayPal, we're here. You can see it. Yeah. Take a look at this. PayPal basically right down here. Headed back up to denial and then straight up Baba. Same thing. This is perfect. Actually, if you look at BABA, people are so depressed about this. You can't even see the move in the last few weeks. So, you had all this there. Then you go up. Then you test it. You're right here. You're literally right here in denial. It's breaking out above this right here in denial. And then you're going to get returning confidence is where you get the parabolic move. They're all basically there. PayPal. Um, Baxter is probably down here somewhere. Baxter's right here. Max discouragement. Uh, let's take a look here. Generrack. [Music] It's going to be a longer call than I thought. Oh, this is perfect. Look at this. Look at this Generrack. It's just retesting that. It's right here. It's literally right here. So, this is what we're going to get is that this little pullback will probably reload before a next parabolic move. Then you got um VF Corp. Where's VF Corp? VF Corp is probably right down here. Perfect. The spike up and a test down. You're probably right. You might be here. You might be here or you might be here. But either way, I think you're probably here in a version Cooper Standard. [Music] It's just breaking out now. This is pretty amazing. Cooper Standards just breaking out. This is huge. Um I'm excited. Thank God for today. Thank god I was in front of the screens just just ready with my licking my chops and pressing the buy buttons on these that we had one more bite at the apple like the backers in discouragement the Intels's in discouragement the VF corpse in discouragement or aversion um what what else was there today. Dagio, Intel, Varco, Stanley. We bought some Stanley Black & Decker today. Stanley is probably I think it's right here. Let's take a look at Stanley. Boy, this is not how I expected the uh podcast to go today, but I'm having fun doing this. All right. So, you had this recovery and then a final flush and now it's starting to recover final flush. I think you're probably here probably somewhere between aversion and denial on Stanley Black & Decker. All right, so that's that. Let's get back to some data before we take any more tangents. But sometimes the tangents are where the best stuff is. All right. US firms exceed profit estimate estimates at strongest rate in four years. Earnings are going fine. Mainland China's capital inflows into Hong Kong have topped the last year's total. That game is on. They'll get a handshake picture with Trump. Stocks will go crazy. The earnings will support it. Off to the races. Growth in credit card spending. We need to relever the private sector, delever the public sector. Each component of speculating training indicator elevated versus history. Okay. So, we're seeing that this is what we talked about last week. [Music] This was a key point I wanted to cover. The reason I said last week, I said last week, you know, we're growing into a period. We've obviously had a huge move. Uh but I would not expect a big crash of 20%. you're at the most you're going to see during this weak seasonal period of August through October is 5 to 10% pullback to be bought and um and some volatility at the most and I and I wouldn't get too cute with it because there are too many people behind the benchmark that have to buy every single dip that got destroyed in April. Uh and that's why I would stay very constructive. The other reason why is that on average going back a 100red years the market gets a 20% plus uh intraear bare market correction every 4.2 years on average. We have now had three of those in the last 5 years in 2020 in 2022 and in 2025 peaked to trough about 20%. So, we've pulled forward something like 12 years of these uh 20% corrections in a matter of 5 years. Uh I think what you're going to see is a lot of recency bias uh thinking we're going right back to that and idiots on TV calling for a big crash in 2026. Yeah, it's a it's an election year. It tends to be choppy the midterm election years, etc. Fine. If we finish the last fourth quarter super strong, uh, of course you're going to get a pullback in probably February, March, and into the election. But, uh, I don't think we're going to get another 20% correction. We're kind of, uh, overused on that front. Um, I think the five or 10s are going to be perfect and they're going to be bought. Okay. Cyclical sector breath has weakened relative to defensive. Uh, defensives have been given away. defensives are the are the Backaxers of the world, the Diagios of the world, the Crown Castles of the world, um the Hormels of the world. I think those are going to start to get bid. I think people are underestimating those and that they probably get bid in the fall when when you start to see a little chop.

Nine management noted that recent talk of certain banks charging for access to customer data which triggered a sharp sell-off in the stock is immaterial to PayPal. They confirmed the company will not be impacted by any such pricing changes. 10 management raised fullear guidance now expecting non-GAAP EPS of $5.15 to $5.30 11 to 14% earnings growth compared to prior guidance of 495 to 510 6 to10% growth. Transaction margin dollars were also raised to a range of 15.35 billion to 155 5 to 6% growth versus previous guidance of four to 5% growth. They reaffirmed free cash flow estimates of 6 to 7 billion, share repurchases of 6 billion and capex of around a billion. This guidance still looks relatively conservative with the low end assuming up to a couple of points of decelerating in e-commerce spending, though management has seen no evidence thus far.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nquick Boeing update. But just to hit on a few quick points of Boeing, if you wanted to see a textbook example, dispondency reverting to Euphoria, look no further than Boeing. Just a few months you couldn't give away the stock in the early 130s. We were on an island saying that we were bullish and got looked at like we had three heads. Now it's at 225 and it's all anyone wants to talk about. As for Q2, it all comes to two words. Kelly Ortberg in his own words, 2025 is Boeing's turnaround year. We could not agree more. As we always say, the number one thing you want to see in a turnaround is free cash flow, especially for a company like Boeing. And they absolutely delivered adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was a usage of 200 million compared to consensus estimates of a $1.8 billion usage and a year ago figure of4.3 billion. Management now sees a usage of just three billion as a reasonable fullear target compared to prior guidance of four to five billion cash burn. Most importantly, the long-term 10 billion of free cash flow target remains intact. That free cash flow is being powered by a business firing on all cylinders. Boeing recorded the highest number of deliveries in both Q2 and the first half of the year since 2018 along with its strongest quarterly revenue in six years. Meanwhile, the 737 program is now running at a production rate of 38 per month and is expected to climb to 42 in the months ahead. Ladies and gentlemen, this thing is going higher. It probably consolidates in the short term. Uh many thanks to Kelly Ortberg for his miracle work in progress. An amazing run we've had in the last couple of months.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nGeneral market. Um a little bit elevated. Active investment managers taking some risk off.

So, here we go. And here's our first question from York Bourgeoa. Hope your earning season been going great. Uh with com stock now below 20. Could you describe the comparison between them and national oil well Varco and where you put new money? Uh look, we own com stock from eight bucks. So we're not really chasing up here. Although I am tempted to buy some stock at this these levels, but Varco is a much better bargain cuz it's just getting started. So, um they're two different businesses. I I I could buy I mean, if if com goes back to 15, I I'd put new money to work there, but I mean with an $8 basis, I'm not going to bring my basis up uh just because of a simple pullback. I like Varco here for a new stock for the long term. Brennan Birkhart, I'm 14 years old and have been trading. My dad introduced me to your podcast. He's a big fan of your work and encouraged me to start listening. Hey, welcome, man. Congratulations. 14. Uh, you're a little late. I started when I was 10, but uh, you know, I think you'll catch up. No worries. Uh, while doing some research, came across the stock grab. My dad suggested I like balance sheet cash flow, revenue. From what I saw, the company seems to have low debt, strong cash flow, solid financials. What am I missing? You're missing. We covered this one a couple weeks ago. I hate the food delivery business. Um, I think it's garbage business, but uh, we've covered this one a few times in the last few weeks. I think it probably works as a trade. I think your instinct is correct on this one, Brennan, but um, it's not the type of business that I would on want to own for anything more than a trade. Um, it is recovering, it is growing, but let's just take a quick look here. So, you know, it's trading at seven times sales, um, 200 times earnings, and I think the growth rate has leveled off and there's a lot of competition in that. So, for me, it's not what I'm interested in, but I think you're probably right from a trading standpoint, but from an own forever, not there's no real moat. Eaton Daniel trying to work on my mental valuation muscle and just wanting your thoughts. VFC Corp said they have 300 save 300 million in their cost structure. Expect another 500 to 600 million in savings to flow to net operating income. So just on a savings growth assuming no growth they could be trading 10 to 15 times 800 million this sounds like 8 billion to 12 billion uh valuation from today's 4.5. So double to triple with no growth and possibly another triple on top over the next 5 years assuming fixed costs stay flat and growth comes back at single digit. Um I think you're in the ballpark. I think I look I think Bracken is going to take this thing uh from our original model uh we had underwritten it for originally we had underwritten it for $50 and then we rerated to 100 after he made some uh adjustments on probably about a year in and we've have no change to outlook. Everything he said he's going to do is hitting on all cylinders. He got a little sidetracked with the tariff thing but it's completely immaterial because everyone has that as you saw in his interviews. So, you're roughly in the ballpark.

So double to triple with no growth and possibly another triple on top over the next 5 years assuming fixed costs stay flat and growth comes back at single digit. Um I think you're in the ballpark. I think I look I think Bracken is going to take this thing uh from our original model uh we had underwritten it for originally we had underwritten it for $50 and then we rerated to 100 after he made some uh adjustments on probably about a year in and we've have no change to outlook. Everything he said he's going to do is hitting on all cylinders. He got a little sidetracked with the tariff thing but it's completely immaterial because everyone has that as you saw in his interviews. So, you're roughly in the ballpark. How you got there is  a little different, but uh the key thing you need to know is it's going up and it's going up a lot. Johnny, uh thoughts on ABV uh in Brazil? 6% dividend yield. Um I don't I don't really like this business, but um this is more of a value trap. If you want to buy it for the yield, have at it. It's just it's just um if you're going to go into alcohol, you want to be on the premium premiumization side. People are drinking less and higher quality. I mean, there's nothing not to love here in terms of the free cash flow growth. Uh I think their balance sheet though might have a little bit of leverage, more leverage than we're comfortable with. Four billion of cash. No. I mean, I don't see anything egregiously wrong with this business at all. I just don't think you're going to get the move you expect to get, but I don't think you're going to get hurt either. So, um I just think there are higher and better uses. And uh let me just see what that is happening with the revenue trends, it's been headed down, but I I don't think you get hurt with it, but I don't think you make a lot of money either. Okay.

If you have to play health care, I'd buy like humanity or something like that. I wouldn't even mess with the lower quality. Sentine. I know it looks attractive, but they got all that Medicaid exposure. It's just I'd go with something a little higherend. John Barry, uh, do you think Whirlpool is now a buy? This is a housing play, so I don't need another housing play. We've got enough between um Gener Stanley Black & Decker and QXO to housing and rates play and so is so is Cooper Standard rates play. So um I mean their revenues just show zero sign of recovering. So I I mean no I don't I don't really I think you're right but there's no factual basis. I think you're totally right. Like looking at it as a trader, I agree with you. Looking at it fundamentally, I I have no interest to commit any capital. Dan lease unhooj. Happy to be wrong on that one.

But it's probably time to buy UPS. Let me just take a look. So, we got 19 billion of debt. The only issue is the balance sheet's a little bit leveraged, but other than that, uh, I don't think you're going to get hurt buying it here. I think you buy if you really want to be in it. I think there are higher and better uses of capital and I think it's going to take longer to build a base than you think. But uh I'd buy like half the position here and if it goes down to 70, finish up your position and then you you know in three or five years you probably have a double double and a half. Uh but I could definitely see it starting to turn here. Let me just see what is uh what earnings estimates are for this one. By the way, you get a nice dividend while you wait, which will probably be cut, but for now it's nice. Uh, let's see. Yeah, a lot of pessimism in the stock. I I kind of like it. I kind of like it. I know we've looked at it a million times. I kept saying lower lower, but now it's getting to the point where it's, you know, you it's not going to all Stephen Frampton cut guidance and the dividend. Yeah. Uh Stephen, and by the way, thanks Stephen. He does all the incredible video work on our social platforms. I think you're right, Stephen, but I think uh it's got to go lower uh and we have to see some signs of the turnaround before we guess that the turnaround's coming. But I think generally you are correct. Uh I just think there are higher and better uses at the moment. Robert Smith considering buying Dow, cutting the dividend. Yeah. If I I like Albam Maro for for um materials exposure. We we keep looking at this one every week. I don't know what turned me off about it. Let me just see. Yeah, it's still negative free cash flows. Let's look for some signs of turnaround before we get involved. But yeah, it's probably getting close. Uh, Jack Lomer, 20-year-old listening from Dublin, Ireland. Love listening to podcast every week, gaining loads of valuable insights and your opinions, not advice. With recession risk in the US appearing to diminish and some economic indicators improving, why does broad market consensus remain so bearish on the US dollar? Is it solely to do with slowing growth from US perspective or consensus uh way too bearish? Um, I think we are going to get a counter trend bounce because if you recall last year I was bearish on the dollar when everyone was bullish. Now people are starting to become everyone's starting to become bearish. So we probably do get a large counter trend balance but the trend is down. We we are going to have to inflate away this debt and uh grow above trend and Trump wants a weaker dollar and he'll say he wants a stronger dollar but it's going to help our earnings. It's going to help our exports. It's going to make us more competitive and it's what we need in the short term. If we have a high dollar, we're going to have problems with the amount of debt that we owe. So, um, expect a counter trend bounce followed by a continued downtrend.

      "results . Intel update. So you can see here the stock is down because the fundamentals are down. In the short term, the market's a voting machine. In the long term, it's a weighing machine. It is weighing garbage fundamentals. Okay? Both on the weighing machine and the voting machine. But Lip Bhan is here to save the day, and we're going to discuss how. With Q2 earning season now in full swing, Intel was the first of our names to report earlier last week. Headline numbers were strong across the board. Revenue came in at 12.9 billion flat yearonear, beating consensus by nearly $1 billion. Let me repeat that. revenues beat consensus by a billion dollars, which means the downward spiral has stopped and now it's stabilizing and then it can start to recover and landing $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. So, not only did they beat by a billion, they were up $500 million above the high end of management's prior guidance. In fact, Q2 was the third straight quarter of revenue coming ahead of expectations. You could not tell that by the stock price and the short-term emotional voting machine. Earnings were weighed down by restructuring costs and onetime equipment impairment charges. Excluding those, Intel delivered EPS of 10 cents a share ahead of both prior guidance and consensus estimates of 1 cent a share. Not only that, but Q3 guidance held up well with revenue expected between 12.6 6 and 13.6 billion compared to the streets 12.66 billion. Keep in mind Q3 has historically posted high singledigit sequential growth. Current guidance implies -2 to plus 6% due to potential tariff pull forward. That sets a low bar for a beat if demand holds up. But despite the beat and solid guidance, shares fell by nearly 10% after the report. In our view, a gift from the gods. What spooked the market and continues to weigh on the stock comes down to the foundry business and the about face and strategies that Lip Bhutan is bringing to the table and rightfully so.\nHere is  what was added to the K 10 Q and what Lip Bhutan means by making it his top priority to quote become a more financially disciplined foundry. He did not say get out of the foundry business. He said, \"Become a more financially disciplined foundry.\" And quote, \"If we were able to secure a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A, our next generation semiconductor manufacturing process technology, we may pause. If we are okay, here I love this. Here we go. If we are unable to secure a significant external foundry customer for Intel 14A, our next generation semiconductor manufacturing process technology, we may pause or discontinue our pursuit of next generation leading edge process technologies which may have significant strategic business, financial and operational and reputational risks and repercussions. This is a complete Uturn from Pat Gellinger's build it and they will come mentality. In Lip Bhutan's own words, quote, \"Over the past several years, the company invested too much too soon without adequate demand. Going forward, our investment in Intel 14A will be based on confirmed consumer commitments. There are no more blank checks. Every investment must make economic sense.\" He's now stewarding our capital the way we would steward our capital because he's got skin in the game. He wrote, you know, uh, uh, Bracken wrote a $3 million check for stock. Lip Bhutan wrote a $25 million personal check for stock. Okay. And the shift in strategy is being viewed as putting the foundry future in jeopardy, meaning without landing an external customer, no 14A, and no future Intel internal production. We have a much different take. The foundry business has been a cash incinerator for years, losing $3 billion this quarter alone with an operating margin of71.7%. There's no planet where that is sustainable. And Lip Bhutan has made it clear he is not willing to eat those losses forever. Until Intel sees external customers stepping up with volume commitments, they are scaling back the massive capex buildout. In other words, they are no longer the bag holders. And believe it or not, they actually have the leverage here. Intel is one of only three leading edge chip fabs left in the world. No company that is currently relying on the kindness of strangers for Advanced Foundry. Whether it's Nvidia, Amazon, or anyone else wants to have all their eggs in the TSMC basket. This is essentially a warning shot to engage and get serious or Intel will walk away from the foundry business. No company in their right mind wants that. At the same time, it doesn't hurt to have the US government as your co-investor and subsidizer chief. The government is committed to reducing dependence on Taiwan semiconductor monopoly and creating a duopoly with Intel. I wouldn't bet against the richest Treasury in the world to make that happen. Many bet against the government's commitment to EVs through Tesla subsidies. Ask them how that turned out. The fact of the matter is that the US cannot afford to let Intel struggle. And just last week, we got further confir confirmation with the AI action plan showing exactly how serious they are. Restore American semiconductor manufacturing. America must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US soil. Streamline regulations that slow semiconductor manufacturing efforts. Support nextgen manufacturing. Prioritize investment in these emerging technologies and usher a new industrial renaissance. uh chips and RD programs, etc. But again, while all the focus is on Foundry and reinventing the future, our original thesis has always been that AI and Foundry are just whipped cream on top. We believe continue to believe the legacy PC and service business server business, which makes up 60% of the sales, is worth $45 to $50 per share on its own. That gives us all the margin of safety we need and makes the short-term noise and uncertainty exactly that, just noise. People seem to forget that despite all of Intel's issues, they are still like they they are still like we like to call what we like to call the leader of mediocre chips. They continue to dominate market share in both PCs and servers with 70 to 80% share in the client market and 55% share in servers. This remains the core of our thesis and Lip Bhutan has made it clear that this is where the focus needs to be. They are fully committed to doubling down, engaging with customers early in the product cycle and winning back share. That is music to our ears. And let's not forget, we have a miracle worker at the helm in lip ban. The chart of Cadence Design Systems before and after he took over says everything you need to know. He stepped in after an 86% collapse in this cadence stock. Over the next 14 years, Cadence be became a 68 bagger. 68 bags. 1 million became 68 million by the time he left. Intel is his next turnaround project. And in his own words, he wants to quote pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations. So this is not only about money. This is about his final run legacy. If t",

      "Nvidia, Amazon, or anyone else wants to have all their eggs in the TSMC basket. This is essentially a warning shot to engage and get serious or Intel will walk away from the foundry business. No company in their right mind wants that. At the same time, it doesn't hurt to have the US government as your co-investor and subsidizer chief. The government is committed to reducing dependence on Taiwan semiconductor monopoly and creating a duopoly with Intel. I wouldn't bet against the richest Treasury in the world to make that happen. Many bet against the government's commitment to EVs through Tesla subsidies. Ask them how that turned out. The fact of the matter is that the US cannot afford to let Intel struggle. And just last week, we got further confir confirmation with the AI action plan showing exactly how serious they are. Restore American semiconductor manufacturing. America must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US soil. Streamline regulations that slow semiconductor manufacturing efforts. Support nextgen manufacturing. Prioritize investment in these emerging technologies and usher a new industrial renaissance. uh chips and RD programs, etc. But again, while all the focus is on Foundry and reinventing the future, our original thesis has always been that AI and Foundry are just whipped cream on top.

Back VF Corp, Intel, No. Uh National Oil Well, Varco. I mean, they were just giving stuff away today and we were like, \"Thank you very much.\" And what's so amazing is like you look on a daily, you're like, \"Oh, are these going to be okay?\" And then you look at the numbers, you're like, \"Of course they're going to be okay.\" And then you zoom out, which is what we do here and what we teach, and you look at the album",

Uh we'll go through those earnings. Stanley Black & Decker again, people bitching about that. This recovery is just starting. Same story. Complete flush out, little uncertainty, and then straight back to new highs. This time will be no different. I think the catalyst for that one is just Powell either needs to be undermined or needs to be removed. One of those two things is imminent. Um BF Corp, uh Bracken, unbelievable earnings. The stock shot up to $15. Then you had Powell open his big mouth and all the cyclicals got hit. So, uh, this was down. But, uh, Bracken did an amazing interview with Jim Kramer, which we're going to listen to in just a little bit, and he laid out the whole case. By the way, the one thing he said at the end is the most important thing he said of the whole thing. He's personally purchased over $3 million of stock. Uh which is kind of a rounding error compared to what we have, but um uh it's nice to see that's money he pulled out of his own pocket buying in the hole. We love that. This is the same type of bottoming process you saw in 20201, 2009, 2010. It's a cyclical thing. That's what these businesses do. And uh back off to the races. So this was a gift. Mana from Heaven, buying it till our fingers fell off today. And uh super excited and we had to raise the cash. You know, we we we have uh limits on um what we want to do and things that are doubles in, you know, two 3 months. They're they're going to take a breather. We use some cash. We'll probably buy some of that back, but but to not buy more at these levels, uh for the Stanley's, for the VF Corps, for the Intels, uh for the Baxters, for the Varcos, uh these gifts, these are kind of the last stop on the bus before you rock it to the moon. And uh we didn't want to miss it. So that's that. Uh the big story with Cooper to obviously next week, we'll be going into this very strongly. uh they took North American production guidance down. That's just numbers that they get from the industry rags. I think those are going to be too low. But despite taking production numbers way down uh to 14.9 million from industry, they were able to take adjusted Ibida up from their initial guidance midpoint of 217 a.5 all the way up to 235 midpoint. So almost another $20 million of IBIDA more than they expected. Uh and that's why I think you're seeing the stock up over 29. Would love to see it get a three handle in front in the next week. That would be amazing. VF Corp jumps after earnings beat as turnaround takes hold. Uh that was the case until Powell came out and shot his mouth off unnecessarily, but it's immaterial. I'm going to be sending him a Christmas card along with Xihinping. Uh thanking him for allowing us to get more VF Corp. Um that one will be a detailed one next week. So Jeff, we're doing um CPS, VFC, and probably Etsy next week. Generrack we don't have to cover because it went up. Uh oh no you need to do backs. So probably backter VF court CPS next.",
      "he didn't truly believe Intel could be turned around. He spent two years on the board before resigning. clearly in disagreement with Pat Gellzinger's spending spree and direction. The point is he knows the business inside and out and and the industry by the way and there are no surprises for him. He isn't chasing money. The only thing he's chasing is admission into the semiconductor CEO Hall of Fame. And if his track record wasn't enough, within 30 days of taking the job, he wrote a $25 million check out of his own pocket at a $24 cost basis. that puts you in at lower prices than Lip Bhutan. Uh, one of the best operators in the industry. Betting against Lip Boutan has never been a profitable trade and we don't think this time will be any different. Here's everything you need to know following Q2 earnings. You can go through that step by step. We highlighted all the important parts and the deck and the 10 key points. revenue of 12.9 billion beat consensus by roughly 1 billion and came in nearly 500 million uh above the high end of prior guidance. Intel products revenue reached 11.8 billion up slightly sequentially and ahead of expectations across both client and server segments. On the client side, demand continues to benefit from the co era PC refresh cycle with AIPCs representing a growing share of the mix. And in the server business, Granite Rapids is ramping as planned with hyperscalers continue to refresh their CPU installed base 2. Gross margins are expected to face near-term pressure due to the significant ramp up of Lunar Lake Q3 and Panther Lake later this year as cost per wafer remains high in the early stages. However, as volumes increase, management expect gross margins to expand into 2026, continue improving for several years. Management anticipates 40 to 60% fall through for gross margins next three next year leaning towards high-end if volume scale as expected. Three, management remains on track to achieve 2025 operating expense target of 17 billion with plans to reduce opex further to 16 billion next year. Four, 18A reached a mile key milestone at the start of production wafers in Arizona and remains on track for introduction by the end of 2025. It will serve as the foundation for at least the next three generations of Intel client and server products. Most importantly, management continues to expect reasonable returns on investment from Intel products alone. However, as 18A ramps up to high volume, management expects to be in a stronger position to attract external customers as performance yields improve, driving very strong returns over the long term. Five, the first Panther Lake processor SKU remains on track to begin shipping later this year with additional SKUs coming in the first half of 2026. Six, Intel Foundry revenue rose 3% year-over-year to 4.4 4 billion but continues to bleed significant cash posting an operating loss of 3.2 billion up from a 2.8 billion LA uh loss a year ago. Lip Bhutan's top priority is becoming more financially disciplined foundry scaling back capex until there are firm consumer customer volume commitments for 14A as part of this shift. Intel canceled manufacturing products in Germany and Poland and slowed construction in Ohio to better align with market demand. Seven management announced additional layoffs building on the 15% reduction announced last quarter with the target of cutting headcount by to 75,000 employees by year end. That compares to a peak of 132,000 under Gellzinger with most of the reduction already complete. As a result, the company has eliminated 50% of management layers and remains on track to implement its return to office mandate beginning in September. Can you believe it's 2025 and they're just now doing a return to office mandate? Like you can't make this stuff up. Capital expenditures for the full year are expected to total 18 billion, 5 billion below the original guidance set at the start of the year. Management noted that maintenance capex accounts for about half of the current level or roughly 9 billion and expects both growth gross and net capex to decline further in 2026.",
      "bought. Uh we'll be going through these uh this week. I think we're doing Intel and PayPal. We we can't do 10 companies in one call. We'll be here until the cows come home. Uh but if there's something urgent to talk about, I would uh Boeing again shot up. This thing has moved a lot. 135 to 230 in about, you know, four, five, six weeks. I think it's, you know, we we we told you a couple weeks back we took profits on all of our options which were up huge. Um and we've shaved a little bit of stock. Uh that's just to just because there are companies that haven't moved 100% that we wanted to get more of this week",
      "Boeing. It's going to take a breather. Intel beats on revenue slashes foundry investments as CEO says no more blank checks. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. Albamaro post surprise second quarter profit on lithium demand sales surge. Etsy postsec quarter revenue beat amid higher spending on AI marketing. Disney stock is ready to rally after a lost decade. No one wanted it at 85. Everyone wants it at 120. Disney's fabulous four rock which means it probably takes a rest."

      "the norm for PayPal to those who saw saw these results, listened to the call, and still decided to sell. We will gladly be mailing you Christmas cards for the next few years. Uh, we already knew Alex Chris was a winner based on what he accomplishment leading the small business group at into it, but each quarter continues to raise our confidence even higher. Remember, short-term voting machine, long-term weighing machine. I've built my career on finding opportunities where price disconnects from improving fundamentals. And when investors are bending over backwards to find reasons to sell, just know that dispondency tends to revert to euphoria. That flip might be closer than anyone realizes. We'll be happy to return the early Christmas favor and hand out some shares when the stock is trading well over $150. Here's everything you need to know following the results. You can go through this profitable growth is greater than empty calories. You can see this lumpy cash flow 6 to7 billion years. Uh all these decks we highlighted the important things. Go through it. Here are the 10 key points. Number one, PayPal posted its sixth consecutive quarter of profitable growth with transaction margin dollars reaching 3.8 84 billion, up 7% yearonear, 8% excluding interest on customer balances. Transaction margin rose to 46.4% up 62 basis points yearon year. Declining transaction margin dollar growth had always been central to the bare case with drops of 3% in 2022 and negative 5% in 2023. Alex Chris has flipped that on its head, delivering 5% growth in 2024 and guiding for another 5 to 6% growth in 2025 and targeting high singledigit growth by 2027 with a long-term ambition of 10%. Two, Venmo posted revenue growth over 20%, its highest since 2023. Total payment volume grew 12% during the quarter, accelerating quarter over-arter to the fastest rate in three years. Pay with Venmo total payment volume grew more than 45% while monthly active accounts for the Venmo's debit card rose over 40%. These debit card users have some of the most attractive economics in the ecosystem with both Venmo and PayPal debit card users showing 6x the transaction activity and 3x the average revenue per account. We have always said Venmo is a verb and when Alex Chris took over, there were real doubts about whether Venmo could return to growth. Fast forward today, it's on track for well over $2 billion in revenue by 2027 and just getting started. Three, one of the most important pivots in strategy under Alex Chris has been choosing profitable growth over what he called empty calorie revenues, aka firing unprofitable PSP. Brainree customers as expected. Brainree total payment volume growth has slowed dramatically posting just 2% for the past two quarters down from 18% a year ago with PSP consistently making up over 40% of total payment volume. The shift created short-term revenue headwind of roughly 5% in recent quarters. The good news is that not only have transaction margin dollars improved meaningfully, but the business has also reached an inflection point. Management expects break brain-free total payment volume to reacelerate in the second half of the year and beyond following peak pressure from contract renegotiations and the removal of low margin volumes. Just take a look at this inflection for online branded checkout grew 5% year-on-year. A slight deceleration from 6% growth in the prior quarter and one of the few soft spot uh soft spots in the report. The slowdown was driven by weakness in tariff impacted regions such as Asia-based marketplaces. Without that pressure, growth would have held steady at 6%. The good news is that softness has already stabilized in Q3. Management continues to guide for fullear growth in the mid single digits with improvement expected over the coming quarters and a path to 8 to 10% growth by 2027. This is largely driven by continued adoption of the new checkout experience which made up 30% of US branded as of February 2025 and has already reached over 60% on track to exceed 80% of global transactions by 2027. Five, buy now pay later continues to accelerate and with volume growth of more than 20% and monthly active accounts up 18% outpacing the overall market as PayPal gains share in the space. These customers bring highly attractive economics with average order value more than 80% higher than a standard checkout transaction. Management also noted ongoing improvements in charge off and stable low delinquency rates with plans to expand into additional markets to increase marketing efforts throughout the year. Six total active accounts grew by nearly 2 million from Q1, up 2% for the quarter, reaching an all-time high of 438 million. Monthly active accounts also rose 2% year-onear to 226 million as the largest two-sided platform in the world continues to get bigger. Seven adjusted free cash flow came in at 66 656 million, well below street consensus of 100 1.62 billion. While a soft number caught the market off guard, management said this was simply due to timing shifts in working capital that are expected to reverse in the second half. More importantly, they reiterated fullear free cash flow guidance of six to 7 billion with a B, implying a nearly 10% free cash flow yield at the midpoint. Eight share repurchases totaled $1.5 billion for the quarter, bringing the trailing 12 month to total to $6 billion and reducing the share count by 7%. Your pi, your slice of the pie got 7% bigger without putting one new dollar of cash into the company. Management still expects to buy back $6 billion of stock this year, implying a buyback yield well over 8% at current prices with 13.7 billion in cash and investments versus 1.5 billion in debt. We think t",
      "So, here are the key things from the earnings call. We've highlighted in green what you need to know. And now on to PayPal. Again, just pulling up the mammoth cycle here. This is um dispondency. Looks like we're now in aversion. So, this would be uh rather discouragement, anxiety. We got up to at $90 93. Then back to 55. We were in aversion. Now we're getting back up to denial before we bust out to the parabolic move. Going back to the mammoth cycle. If you're not watching this on YouTube, um I would highly encourage that you will get four times as much value. But if you can only do it listening, it's better than nothing. Uh so here you can see cash flow near record all-time high, price near record all-time low. Certainly in the last 10 years, revenues continue to reach records. Uh return on invested capital is accelerating up to low double digits from high single digits. Gross margins are starting to reacelerate. PE is near record low. Price to free cash flow near record low. Uh uh balance sheet is better than ever. free cash flow per share is double what it was a few years ago. Common shares outstanding uh has come down about uh looks like about 15% over the last 3 four years. Uh revenues up a third since 2021. PayPal delivered another lights out quarter this week. revenue of 8.3 billion up 5.1% yearonear beat consensus by 220 million while non-GAAP EPS of 140 came in 10 cents ahead of expectations management also raised fullear EPS guidance to 515 from uh to 530 from 495 to 5 to 510 and lifted fullyear transaction margin dollars essentially gross profit to 51 15.35 to 15.5 billion from prior guidance of 15.2 2 to 15.4. Going through the earnings call, it is hard to find anything not to like. The highlight color is overwhelmingly green. The one soft spot was adjusted free cash flow with ca which came in at just 656 million, down 42% year-onear and well below the 1.62 billion the street expected. In typical shoot first ask",

Now it's at 225 and it's all anyone wants to talk about. As for Q2, it all comes to two words. Kelly Ortberg in his own words, 2025 is Boeing's turnaround year. We could not agree more. As we always say, the number one thing you want to see in a turnaround is free cash flow, especially for a company like Boeing. And they absolutely delivered adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was a usage of 200 million compared to consensus estimates of a $1.8 billion usage and a year ago figure of4.3 billion. Management now sees a usage of just three billion as a reasonable fullear target compared to prior guidance of four to five billion cash burn. Most importantly, the long-term 10 billion of free cash flow target remains intact. That free cash flow is being powered by a business firing on all cylinders. Boeing recorded the highest number of deliveries in both Q2 and the first half of the year since 2018 along with its strongest quarterly revenue in six years.

      "urgent to talk about, I would uh Boeing again shot up. This thing has moved a lot. 135 to 230 in about, you know, four, five, six weeks. I think it's, you know, we we we told you a couple weeks back we took profits on all of our options which were up huge. Um and we've shaved a little bit of stock. Uh that's just to just because there are companies that haven't moved 100% that we wanted to get more of this week. Uh so we did a little just a tad of harvesting there, but um I could see us buying it back if it pulls back below 200. um but or just riding the rest of it and being perfectly happy because it's still a very sizable position",
      "Kelly Ortberg in his own words, 2025 is Boeing's turnaround year. We could not agree more. As we always say, the number one thing you want to see in a turnaround is free cash flow, especially for a company like Boeing. And they absolutely delivered adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was a usage of 200 million compared to consensus estimates of a $1.8 billion usage and a year ago figure of4.3 billion. Management now sees a usage of just three billion as a reasonable fullear target compared to prior guidance of four to five billion cash burn. Most importantly, the long-term 10 billion of free cash flow target remains intact. That free cash flow is being powered by a business firing on all cylinders. Boeing recorded the highest number of deliveries in both Q2 and the first half of the year since 2018 along with its strongest quarterly revenue in six years. Meanwhile, the 737 program is now running at a production rate of 38 per month and is expected to climb to 42 in the months ahead.",

So what happened is Powell again had to do Powell be his belligerent useless Fed chair self uh and um basically have a very hawkish meeting. So what you saw in the last two days is cyclicals which have been crushing it since the April bottom um got smacked uh yesterday because basically the policy that he was signaling implied that he's going to crash the economy because he's uh wants to stay restrictive and that's why you saw tech get bid they'll do better in a deflationary um uh higher unemployment environment, which is the policy path that he was signaling yesterday. It won't be executed because Trump is going to announce a shadow Fed and Powell is going to become a lame duck. I wouldn't actually be surprised if um they do wind up firing him because at, you know, $600 billion of unnecessary interest costs, uh it's reckless. It's bad for the taxpayers. It's bad for housing. It's bad for employment. You're seeing weak employment. this guy's got his head up his ass and he needs to go. So, um, so that's that. But again, one one Fed meeting, it makes zero difference to the recovery of these companies. It makes a big difference for the price movement, the short-term emotional voting machine over a few days after his meeting. But, as always, the first move is usually the wrong move. expect Trump to ratchet up the pressure and uh at the end of the day, love him or hate him, Trump always wins. This guy's going to be toast. Uh what he did yesterday was a step above being quote unquote data dependent. What he did was a big FU to the president and um uh that old that old dog don't hunt. That's not going to last very long.

      "Intel is one of only three leading edge chip fabs left in the world. No company that is currently relying on the kindness of strangers for Advanced Foundry. Whether it's Nvidia, Amazon, or anyone else wants to have all their eggs in the TSMC basket. This is essentially a warning shot to engage and get serious or Intel will walk away from the foundry business. No company in their right mind wants that. At the same time, it doesn't hurt to have the US government as your co-investor and subsidizer chief. The government is committed to reducing dependence on Taiwan semiconductor monopoly and creating a duopoly with Intel. I wouldn't bet against the richest Treasury in the world to make that happen. Many bet against the government's commitment to EVs through Tesla subsidies. Ask them how that turned out. The fact of the matter is that the US cannot afford to let Intel struggle. And just last week, we got further confir confirmation with the AI action plan showing exactly how serious they are. Restore American semiconductor manufacturing. America must bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US soil. Streamline regulations that slow semiconductor manufacturing efforts. Support nextgen manufacturing. Prioritize investment in these emerging technologies and usher a new industrial renaissance. uh chips and RD programs, etc. But again, while all the focus is on Foundry and reinventing the future, our original thesis has always been that AI and Foundry are just whipped cream on top. We believe continue to believe the legacy PC and service business server business, which makes up 60% of the sales, is worth $45 to $50 per share on its own. That gives us all the margin of safety we need and makes the short-term noise and uncertainty exactly that, just noise. People seem to forget that despite all of Intel's issues, they are still like they they are still like we like to call what we like to call the leader of mediocre chips. They continue to dominate market share in both PCs and servers with 70 to 80% share in the client market and 55% share in servers. This remains the core of our thesis and Lip Bhutan has made it clear that this is where the focus needs to be. They are fully committed to doubling down, engaging with customers early in the product cycle and winning back share. That is music to our ears. And let's not forget, we have a miracle worker at the helm in lip ban. The chart of Cadence Design Systems before and after he took over says everything you need to know. He stepped in after an 86% collapse in this cadence stock. Over the next 14 years, Cadence be became a 68 bagger. 68 bags. 1 million became 68 million by the time he left.
