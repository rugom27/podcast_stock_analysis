**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Constructive with sideways chop → 8/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆

- Too many people behind the benchmark that have to buy every single dip that got destroyed in April.
- Market gets a 20%+ intra-year bear market correction every 4.2 years on average. We have now had three of those in the last 5 years.
- I would not expect a big crash of 20%. you're at the most you're going to see during this weak seasonal period of August through October is 5 to 10% pullback to be bought and um and some volatility at the most and I and I wouldn't get too cute with it

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is in a period of sideways chop with a constructive outlook. Powell's hawkish stance is a short-term interruption and Trump will undermine him. The private sector needs to relever, and the public sector needs to delever. A weaker dollar is coming.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| US firms exceeding profit estimates | Strongest rate in four years | Earnings are going fine. |
| FINRA margin debt over Wilshire total market index | Near all-time lows | Implies room for private sector releveraging and public sector deleveraging. |
| Two Fed governors dissent at July FOMC meeting | Largest number of government descents since 1993 | The natives are getting restless and now internally he's getting dissent in addition to President Trump's dissent and common sense argument that we're paying 600 billion dollars more with taxpayers money on interest than we need to be, particularly when inflation is quelled. |
