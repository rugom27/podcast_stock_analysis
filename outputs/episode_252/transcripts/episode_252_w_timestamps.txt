[145.599s] 253 want to thank Christian dagger and
[149.12s] Preston Melle for having me on vanney
[152.72s] and Company last Thursday thanks to Stu
[154.959s] vanney as well we&#39;re going to listen in
[157.4s] here for the markets it is a rally Dow&#39;s
[160.319s] up
[161.239s] 476 nasdaq&#39;s up 219 course look we&#39;ve
[164.48s] been here before Market straight up and
[166.519s] then in the afternoon it goes straight
[167.64s] down I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to
[168.72s] close but right now it&#39;s up Tom Hayes
[171.12s] joins us to look at the market this
[173.0s] morning is the Fed in your opinion is
[175.4s] the Fed doing the right thing leaving
[177.72s] rates exactly where they are until
[180.08s] September they&#39;re not doing the right
[182.159s] thing St but they&#39;re going to get away
[184.08s] with it and that&#39;s because as we saw
[185.92s] this morning as it relates to to the
[188.04s] economy the rumors of My Demise are
[190.36s] greatly exaggerated so we saw initial
[192.28s] jobless claims come in lower than
[194.319s] expected they&#39;re going to get away with
[195.879s] it the problem is why you&#39;re seeing all
[197.4s] this volatility is Bank of Japan bailed
[199.92s] out the West while we were fighting
[201.159s] inflation they were the global liquidity
[202.92s] provider buying bonds globally buying
[205.0s] equities globally and when they needed
[207.08s] to hike to fight inflation we didn&#39;t
[208.84s] come to their rescue when they hiked
[210.76s] last week the FED should have been
[212.159s] cutting and we wouldn&#39;t see this
[213.4s] volatility so boj had to back off until
[216.36s] September when the fed&#39;s going to cut
[218.12s] and now we&#39;ve got a high chance 80 some
[220.04s] odd percent chance of a 50 basis percent
[222.28s] cut in September and the Market&#39;s doing
[225.159s] well the Market&#39;s doing great there you
[226.76s] go I know you like two stocks in
[228.76s] particular and I&#39;m interested in this
[231.0s] Disney Disney&#39;s all the way down to $84
[234.04s] a share I mean that&#39;s a dip and a half
[235.84s] Disney you can&#39;t give away right now and
[237.56s] I&#39;ll tell you I look at Disney Disney&#39;s
[239.879s] sum of the parts okay so you have the
[241.439s] parks and the experiences people are
[242.879s] worried that the parks are slowing down
[244.72s] for the next couple of quarters they&#39;re
[246.519s] going to do 10 billion of ebit which
[248.28s] implies $80 a share in value for the
[250.28s] parks and experiences that means Disney
[252.56s] plus is worth zero ESPN is worth zero
[255.36s] theatrical Productions is worth zero you
[257.359s] saw Deadpool it&#39;s going to be a billion
[259.4s] dollar franchise inside out too billion
[261.239s] dollar franchise it&#39;s attributed zero
[263.24s] they&#39;ve got3 million subscribers Netflix
[266.28s] has 277 million they get a quarter of a
[269.24s] trillion valuation this business gets
[271.759s] zero so we think between the parks and
[274.68s] the streaming over time the streaming
[276.12s] can do 10 to 15 billion of ebit which
[278.919s] implies $150 to $190 a share over the
[281.84s] next 3 to 5 years and you can&#39;t give it
[284.199s] away today if you bought it for 84 you&#39;d
[286.16s] be satisfied with just a 100 bucks in a
[288.639s] six or seven months Take the Long View
[289.96s] here one last one and we&#39;ve often
[292.12s] covered this gener the generator people
[295.24s] fantastic business uh they got in
[297.6s] trouble from 2001 because they Overstock
[300.36s] during covid they spent eight quarters
[302.44s] working through that Overstock dstock
[304.32s] cycle now they&#39;re in the restock cycle
[306.56s] uh residential was up 8% commercial was
[308.8s] up 10% they beat and raised for this
[311.32s] quarter so we we like this business the
[313.199s] grid is unstable and we&#39;re entering
[314.88s] hurricane season as rates go down so
[317.44s] people are going to be able to finance
[318.639s] them more easily met a good case where&#39;s
[320.44s] it go 137 Now where&#39;s it going uh this
[323.28s] thing is probably over time going to
[325.16s] work towards 200 give it it 12 24 36
[328.24s] months 12 2 4 that&#39;s okay you know
[331.72s] accordion of time frame I&#39;ll tell you
[333.36s] they&#39;ve got 6.25% gener uh penetration
[336.639s] for their total addressable Market uh
[338.72s] this has tremendous opportunity moving
[340.24s] forward so I want to be conservative
[341.6s] here but uh our expectations are much
[344.12s] higher than that got it uh Tom hay
[346.0s] thanks very much for joining us thanks
[347.16s] for having me you&#39;ll be back if you&#39;re
[348.28s] not careful I appreciate it much all
[349.68s] right Lauren&#39;s looking
[351.199s] at and we&#39;re back and then I want to
[354.88s] thank Jeff Cohen and Trinity Chavez for
[358.039s] having me on NYS ETV from the New York
[361.759s] Stock Exchange last uh just uh yesterday
[365.96s] when the PPI inflation numbers came out
[368.639s] we&#39;ll tune in here open right now and
[371.319s] joining me to talk more about this
[373.28s] eventful day is Thomas Hayes he is a
[375.039s] chairman and managing partner and member
[377.599s] well actually managing member at Great
[379.319s] Hill capital good morning good morning
[381.84s] Trinity thanks for having me today
[383.88s] absolutely so let&#39;s lead things off with
[386.12s] some news that just came in about an
[387.88s] hour ago the release of July by
[389.759s] wholesale price data what are you taking
[391.88s] away from the fresh
[393.24s] data well this was phenomenal for the
[395.479s] markets and the markets like it uh
[397.759s] basically it came in at
[399.56s] 2.2% uh versus 2.3% expectations year
[403.039s] on-ear and month- on Monon uh uh 10
[406.36s] basis points versus 20 basis points
[408.759s] expectations the interesting thing about
[410.88s] this report Trinity is that 70% of the
[414.319s] inflation was energy based Energy
[417.12s] Products and the other thing that we saw
[419.24s] which is a change from recent history is
[421.759s] that goods were hotter than Services you
[425.919s] know the last few months Services have
[427.4s] been very very sticky and goods have
[429.72s] been in in Decline so it&#39;s nice to see
[431.72s] Services come down and the market
[434.52s] certainly likes it now the key Trinity
[437.52s] is the impact that it has on
[439.96s] expectations for rate cuts which is what
[442.44s] has the markets uh waiting with baited
[444.8s] breath so more inflation data arrives
[447.879s] tomorrow when the Bureau of Labor
[449.96s] Statistics releases Consumer Price data
[451.84s] for July so what are you pricing out
[454.28s] here yeah I think it&#39;s expected to bump
[457.199s] up a little bit from uh it was negative
[459.4s] one10 to 1% last month uh for the month
[462.36s] on Monon this month it&#39;s expected to be
[464.28s] plus 210 of 1% and 3% year onye the key
[469.08s] though will be is this trend correct and
[471.8s] the trend that I&#39;m talking about is
[474.159s] expectations for probabilities of fed
[476.879s] Cuts in September right now as of this
[479.68s] morning just a few minutes ago we have a
[481.96s] 55% chance of a 50 basis point cut in
[486.24s] September and a 45% chance of a 25 basis
[490.4s] point cut 0% chance of no cuts which is
[494.159s] a big change from just a couple of
[495.759s] months ago and then as of December
[498.159s] because of these inflation numbers that
[499.68s] came in this morning we have a 100%
[502.039s] chance of 75 75 basis points by December
[506.08s] and we have 78% chance of 100 basis
[509.199s] points by December and the market likes
[511.24s] it the Market&#39;s up they just want to see
[513.24s] confirmation tomorrow so if you see a
[515.479s] little uncertainty midday just know the
[517.8s] Market&#39;s waiting for CPI tomorrow
[519.68s] Trinity okay and the CME fed watch tool
[522.479s] is forecasting 100% chance of rate cut
[526.56s] next month but it&#39;s also showing yes so
[529.48s] it&#39;s also showing though a dead heat
[531.64s] when it comes to Traders expecting a 25
[534.64s] basis point cut or a 50 50 base point
[538.279s] cut so what do you believe that we&#39;ll
[540.64s] see next month as this all goes
[543.079s] down yeah it&#39;s a coin flip the key more
[546.2s] than whether it&#39;s 25 or 50 is that they
[548.56s] get started because they can always
[550.24s] speed up or slow down the market has
[552.76s] been waiting with baited breath for the
[554.399s] FED to finally move uh we&#39;re very very
[557.36s] restrictive over 200 basis points above
[560.079s] inflation so they have to get started
[562.079s] and they have to adjust as they go along
[563.68s] and see the data so uh I think that&#39;s
[566.04s] less important for equities than knowing
[568.56s] that they&#39;re in the game and they&#39;re not
[570.2s] going to be too uh rigid in being data
[573.68s] dependent they have to move before we
[575.76s] hit 2% cuz if they move by the time we
[578.279s] hit 2% we&#39;re already in deflation and
[580.44s] that&#39;s a much harder problem to solve
[582.92s] and from your Vantage Point do you think
[584.8s] that the FED waited too long to begin
[586.6s] cutting rids yes but they&#39;ll get away
[589.519s] with
[590.64s] it well I mean that was a short and
[592.76s] sweet
[594.079s] answer and we&#39;ve oh go ahead yeah they
[598.24s] certainly waited too long but they will
[600.04s] get away with it so long as they move in
[601.959s] September they have the Jackson Hole
[604.12s] meeting as an opportunity to convey some
[607.16s] doish and to signal for September which
[609.8s] should hold things together until they
[611.76s] finally start the cutting process just
[614.279s] in the ni just in the nick of time is
[616.48s] really what it&#39;s going to come down to
[618.36s] and you know we&#39;ve also seen a lot of
[620.04s] heightened amount of Market volatility
[622.04s] over the past week so what are you
[623.76s] advising investors to do in the
[625.279s] near-term adid a flurry of economic
[628.16s] headlines yeah so there&#39;s it&#39;s
[630.519s] definitely created some bargain
[632.04s] opportunities I think we&#39;re going to
[633.399s] hold up here into the first cut we may
[636.2s] see some volatility in the fall after
[638.12s] that first cut and before the election
[639.88s] but on balance look earnings are strong
[643.6s] 10.8% year on-year with 78% of the
[646.519s] companies reporting that that compares
[648.76s] to U analysts expected 8.9% earnings
[652.519s] growth to have 10.8% is really really
[655.079s] good for Q2 if you look at the GDP now
[657.72s] we&#39;re still growing at 2 .9% GDP growth
[661.16s] is a big deal and then estimates for
[663.44s] next year have not only held up but
[665.639s] they&#39;ve gone up in the last few weeks up
[668.12s] 1% uh since July 1st still $279 for the
[672.6s] S&amp;P next year which is
[675.44s] 15.2% earnings growth so Trinity when
[678.12s] people say the multiples are too high
[680.36s] just say compared to what because the
[681.959s] earnings growth is going to be 15.2% so
[685.44s] provided the FED does the right thing
[687.72s] and starts that process just in the nick
[689.839s] of time I think we&#39;re going to hold up I
[691.839s] think we&#39;re going to do fine and the one
[693.8s] thing everyone&#39;s worried about the
[695.0s] consumer don&#39;t bet against the consumers
[697.639s] so long as they have a job and so long
[699.88s] as the FED starts this cutting process I
[702.44s] think we&#39;re going to be able to hold the
[703.68s] labor market together and earlier we
[706.56s] dove into wholesale prices and consumer
[709.24s] prices but there are also a lot of
[711.079s] events that are unfolding too like
[713.279s] retail sales data on Thursday and
[715.04s] housing starts data on Friday for
[717.12s] example so what do you feel can Drive
[719.56s] the markets later in the
[721.8s] week yeah I look I think the short-term
[724.72s] numbers everyone knows the consumer is a
[726.6s] little bit weak a little bit nervous and
[728.2s] part of that has to do with
[730.079s] affordability of housing which is going
[731.959s] to improve as the FED starts to cut
[734.079s] rates uh housing starts you&#39;re going to
[736.079s] see uh you know they&#39;re not going to be
[738.0s] great until the FED starts to cut rates
[740.24s] but once that happens and the consumer
[742.44s] has a light at the end of the tunnel
[744.72s] knowing the FED is on their side versus
[747.04s] you know continuing to gut punch them I
[749.76s] I think that things will move forward in
[751.76s] the way that everyone expects and uh and
[754.079s] we&#39;ll be able to see uh earnings re
[756.279s] accelerate margins are are accelerating
[758.76s] so things are holding on but the FED
[760.88s] needs to act fast and as far as the data
[762.88s] this week it&#39;s short-term noise in the
[765.16s] scheme of a long-term strong
[767.68s] economy a lot of important points right
[770.079s] there thank you so much Thomas for
[771.32s] joining us thank you
[773.76s] Trinity and we&#39;re back and then I want
[776.36s] to thank Reuters for including me in
[777.92s] their article about the jobs report last
[780.8s] week uh also an update we&#39;ve had a huge
[783.88s] run in 3M huge run in the stock
[787.8s] multibagger in the options and option
[790.839s] spreads we took profits uh we do think
[794.639s] this this business is going to go higher
[796.48s] over time but it was a lot of money in a
[799.0s] short period of time and every now and
[800.839s] then you got to ring the register we
[802.76s] would love to re-enter this at lower
[804.959s] levels we do not know whether that
[806.839s] opportunity will present itself or not
[809.199s] not but um we are for the time being
[812.72s] holding on to the svent spin-off uh and
[816.519s] may take a look at adding to that as
[818.839s] well but uh this was a win and as you
[821.279s] can see you know this took a whole year
[824.199s] plus to build this base and then when it
[826.16s] took off it took off and doubled off the
[828.079s] bottoms and um between the stock and
[831.0s] options was was very worthwhile so we&#39;re
[833.56s] happy with that uh and you know like
[836.68s] Intel like we did last year went from 25
[839.6s] to 48 we took off 2/3 we readded we
[842.8s] bought more down after uh earnings last
[845.079s] week a lot more down brought our basis
[846.72s] down I think now our basis is down to 23
[849.8s] bucks uh so uh maybe we&#39;ll get an
[852.519s] opportunity to do that in 3M but if not
[854.92s] it was a good ride thank you very much
[857.279s] ring the register uh moving
[860.519s] on we have some data here for for the uh
[865.839s] economic
[866.88s] data services PMI turning up so that&#39;s
[870.04s] good to see uh New York fed Equifax and
[875.519s] serious delinquency 90 plus days that&#39;s
[877.8s] moving up to uh elevated levels at the
[881.399s] low end on credit cards and auto loans
[883.68s] so we got to keep an eye on that and I
[884.92s] hope the FED is keeping an eye on that
[886.519s] and will be dovish until they finally do
[888.6s] their first cut in September doesn&#39;t
[890.8s] really matter whether it&#39;s 25 or 50
[892.639s] yesterday it was 50/50 chance today it&#39;s
[895.16s] 35% chance of a 25 basis point cut and
[899.079s] and uh 65% chance of 50 basis point cut
[903.199s] the key is they get get started and they
[905.199s] can adjust up or down uh Bank of Japan
[908.32s] ucha says no rate hike when financial
[910.48s] markets are unstable so basically what
[912.12s] happened was the uh Bank of Japan had to
[916.8s] raise rates you had to carry trade on
[919.16s] wine because the FED did not cut rates
[922.24s] to offset the liquidity mismatch when
[925.36s] the FED Cuts in September Bank of Japan
[929.319s] will then have the green light to raise
[931.44s] again drain more liquidity Yen stronger
[934.0s] carry trade unwind which supports our
[935.8s] thesis for
[937.0s] China um Japanese 2-year uh government
[940.44s] bond
[941.399s] yield US government spending falling
[944.12s] year onye so this is also
[950.04s] restrictive by the way my favorite mug

[975.279s] to break out they&#39;re retesting they&#39;re
[977.12s] going to break out because earning power
[980.16s] is going up and uh that trend is going
[984.079s] to be fits and starts until it finally
[985.92s] takes off and then everyone will play
[987.24s] catchup same with equal weights uh
[989.56s] absolute same story default rates
[993.079s] are declining this is for leverage loans
[997.44s] actually they peaked earlier this year
[999.079s] and now they&#39;re starting to go down with
[1000.8s] with raid expectations that&#39;s pretty
[1002.36s] good to see uh chapter 11 filings though
[1005.36s] ticking up so this is kind of a mix bag
[1008.399s] uh this is very interesting from Charles
[1012.48s] Payne via Ned Davis research he shows
[1016.639s] since 1945
[1019.12s] there have been
[1020.8s] 89
[1022.36s] 5% correction 5% pullbacks 10 29 10%
[1028.079s] pullbacks 10 20% pullbacks and three 40%
[1032.76s] pullbacks well ladies and gentlemen we
[1034.24s] just had 2 20% pullbacks in the last
[1037.839s] four years which means probably coast is
[1040.839s] clear for some time um statistically
[1045.319s] speaking uh we had one in 2020 and one
[1048.12s] in 20
[1054.12s] 22 and average time to recover for these
[1056.64s] 5% pullbacks is 1.5 months so uh you
[1059.72s] know the market is working back up to
[1061.76s] that fits and starts I would imagine
[1063.36s] we&#39;re going to recover it by September
[1065.72s] but if that&#39;s ahead of the first cut I&#39;d
[1068.24s] be inclined to fade that strength and
[1071.16s] get defensive into the election uh you
[1073.64s] know right around the first cut
[1075.64s] mid-september uh and uh and then build
[1078.2s] up cash to to get aggressively long into
[1080.6s] the year end Rally post
[1082.559s] elction sentiment indicators has dropped
[1084.76s] to cycle lows I&#39;m seeing a lot of the
[1086.28s] sentiment indicators point to levels
[1088.36s] where you want to be a buyer not a
[1089.52s] seller a lot of stuff got knocked down
[1092.08s] uh from that carry trade the beginning
[1093.919s] of the carry trade unwind I think
[1096.32s] there&#39;s an opportunity to step in uh
[1098.44s] selectively for the next few weeks if
[1100.679s] you&#39;re tactical or just long-term and
[1103.32s] hold through the fall volatility of
[1105.08s] course which is more along the lines of
[1106.72s] what we do I think if we do get the
[1108.44s] strength that we expect for the next
[1110.36s] three or 4 weeks we&#39;ll probably put on
[1112.24s] some tactical shorts uh just to take
[1115.24s] advantage of the opportunity and in in
[1117.48s] September October um but we&#39;ll take it
[1121.36s] as it comes uh while while keeping our
[1124.12s] core Holdings and not getting determined
[1126.24s] but the things that have
[1127.76s] reached close to our targets or we&#39;ve
[1130.32s] made a ton of money on in a reasonable
[1132.159s] amount of time like the 3M Etc we&#39;re
[1134.559s] going to we&#39;re going to hit the register
[1136.08s] on some of that stuff uh Global risk
[1138.44s] demand has recently Fallen Shar sharply
[1140.44s] into extreme fear territory so again
[1143.36s] these are periods of
[1144.919s] opportunity uh motor vehicle
[1150.12s] loans okay owned incur is okay relative
[1153.88s] multiple suggests that small caps could
[1155.76s] outperform large caps over the next 10
[1157.559s] years you think yes it&#39;s time back to
[1160.52s] the 2001 to 2007 period and everyone
[1163.12s] lining up um Prime of strip So This Is
[1168.36s] Us prime rate in real terms minus small
[1170.76s] business funding rates is the highest in
[1173.039s] 20
[1174.6s] years uh and the implication is that
[1177.2s] they need to cut a lot more than the FED
[1178.88s] thinks we&#39;ll see uh there are a lot of
[1181.52s] exceptions right now because of what
[1183.159s] happened with Co a once in 100 Year
[1184.88s] event but uh certainly keeping an eye on
[1187.24s] all of this stuff and not being a
[1189.28s] Cassandra and not being a primadonna
[1191.4s] either but just dealing with the data on
[1193.64s] a day-to-day week- toe basis you can see
[1196.32s] the 10-day gauge hit Japanese volatility
[1199.32s] was the highest since the great
[1200.52s] financial crisis and since they blew up
[1202.48s] in the late 80s uh Japanese money
[1205.88s] supply rolling over China&#39;s CPI is going
[1208.44s] up that&#39;s a sign of recovery so pay
[1212.2s] close attention to that you saw the same
[1214.0s] thing off the 2016 lows and a straight
[1216.679s] up rally uh to
[1219.4s] 201819 and then the same thing um the
[1223.24s] 2020 bottoms straight up into beginning
[1226.799s] of 2022 bottomed early 2024 and now is
[1230.039s] working higher that&#39;s a big thing that
[1231.64s] you want to see inflation going up you
[1233.799s] want to see the Yuan start to strengthen
[1235.44s] and you want to start to see bond yields
[1236.919s] going up all of those are coincident
[1239.2s] with Equity starting to rip in China and
[1241.679s] all of those are lining up with uh
[1244.48s] Stronger Yen outflows from Japan which
[1247.159s] was hot money from China Etc PPI
[1249.679s] confirmed the CPI in China worst outflow
[1252.72s] from bank loans since March of 2020 that
[1255.32s] was uh uh during the carry trade on wine
[1260.64s] this talks about Chinese uh out
[1263.88s] producing in terms of getting nuclear
[1266.88s] energy capacity that&#39;s a big
[1270.48s] deal um BuyBacks by corporate clients
[1273.919s] are nearing 2019 highs so that&#39;s a back
[1277.76s] stop supported for the markets which
[1279.64s] which should be part of the reason for
[1282.08s] the August early September strength is
[1284.279s] the blackout periods are over earnings
[1286.279s] are out and now companies can buy back
[1288.64s] stocks with their cash hordes balance
[1290.08s] sheets are
[1293.76s] good and so on moving right along midcap
[1298.12s] etf&#39;s recent buy buying spree after
[1300.279s] selling Spate so the money the money is
[1302.159s] starting to come back into mids it will
[1303.72s] follow into
[1305.159s] Falls
[1308.24s] um this is just a reiteration of
[1310.72s] Charles&#39;s data 5% pullbacks occur more
[1314.24s] than three times a year on average 10%
[1316.48s] pullbacks occur one times a year on
[1318.679s] average 15% Corrections occur every
[1321.279s] other year on average 20% pullbacks
[1323.88s] occur every 3 to four years and as I
[1325.679s] said we&#39;ve had two in four years so
[1328.2s] we&#39;re kind of fronted loaded and we
[1329.76s] should have some smoother sailing for a
[1331.559s] little while prospectively Wake Me Up
[1334.0s] When September end so we should see this
[1335.84s] strength in sept ear August to early
[1338.08s] September I think it&#39;s going to be and
[1339.88s] actually going to be the sell the first
[1341.919s] hike uh also that will be supported by
[1345.96s] um uh election uncertainties so I think
[1349.32s] you know as you get into I think it&#39;s
[1350.6s] September 17th if you have strength and
[1353.64s] a lot of profits it&#39;s time to book some
[1355.64s] maybe put on some tactical shorts and
[1357.919s] then uh mid mid October late October
[1360.64s] because of the election you can probably
[1362.0s] start to buy stuff in the hole and ride
[1364.36s] the um the money machine into year end
[1367.96s] year end rally industrial inventory
[1370.84s] cycle Illinois&#39;s toolworks this is
[1372.799s] earnings quotes from their calls
[1374.679s] destocking which was a headwind all of
[1376.84s] last year is no longer a significant
[1378.559s] Factor at this point we&#39;re going to hear
[1380.32s] from uh um gxo on that as
[1383.799s] well uh Johnson Controls overall I think
[1387.0s] that for the most part the large
[1388.679s] destocking is behind us guys this is the
[1390.919s] whole theme of our portfolio destock to
[1392.96s] restock whether it&#39;s standle whether
[1395.24s] even whether it&#39;s Intel whether it&#39;s um
[1399.32s] gener whether it&#39;s it whether even it
[1402.039s] was uh 3M by the way and 3M probably has
[1404.36s] a lot more juice in it ladies and
[1405.799s] gentlemen it&#39;s just you know when you
[1407.88s] get that kind move in that short period
[1410.24s] of time especially on the options which
[1412.72s] some of the spreads we did were up 3
[1415.12s] 4X um you got to you got to hit the
[1418.08s] window and uh and we may revisit that
[1420.6s] one in the meantime we&#39;ll hang on to
[1422.48s] svent for the time
[1424.96s] being uh arm
[1430.799s] Holdings that&#39;s a different business
[1433.0s] that&#39;s cognizant Microsoft that&#39;s
[1436.24s] Tech that is Tech
[1443.76s] Tech okay so that&#39;s All Tech
[1448.279s] earnings mandelis says they make Oreo
[1451.52s] cookies consumer incomes are rising
[1453.72s] which helps to reduce the inflation
[1455.24s] driven Financial strain on many
[1456.559s] households as a result private label
[1458.039s] growth in our categories is decelerating
[1460.08s] while branded share growth is
[1463.2s] improving that is fascinating that is
[1466.08s] that goes against the the common
[1469.559s] narrative um there here&#39;s Marriott we
[1472.0s] are seeing a stronger performance in the
[1474.399s] upper chain scales than compared to our
[1476.279s] lower chain scales that&#39;s more in line
[1478.0s] with the narrative uh MGM which is
[1481.399s] casinos majority of our customers the
[1483.6s] middle end to high end are still pretty
[1485.799s] strong still visiting quite a bit the
[1487.48s] lower end of the database has seen a bit
[1489.36s] of
[1492.76s] softening Proctor and Gamble makes tide
[1497.0s] so from a consumer standpoint we
[1498.88s] generally don&#39;t see the dynamic of
[1500.32s] consumer pressure that some are
[1501.84s] describing if you look at a couple
[1503.399s] Dynamics private label shares as an
[1505.12s] example which typically would be
[1506.36s] increasing during the time of
[1507.48s] significant consumer pressure that&#39;s not
[1509.64s] what we&#39;re
[1512.159s] seeing fascinating okay uh Matt Ser
[1517.48s] minaro from fundstrat says a peak and
[1520.36s] put call has led to immediate term
[1522.039s] intermediate term lows and equities
[1524.0s] that&#39;s what we saw early this month so
[1525.72s] now where&#39;re fits and starts working
[1527.279s] back up just like we saw uh in past
[1531.08s] instances high yield credit spread
[1533.24s] yields blew out they&#39;re now coming back
[1535.24s] in so that&#39;s positive Market are again
[1537.279s] pricing more fed Cuts in the next 12
[1539.52s] months uh we
[1542.08s] find we find no evidence that hurricane
[1544.559s] Barrel in Texas contributed to the rise
[1546.52s] in temporary layoffs but summer Auto
[1548.64s] Plant retooling shutdowns might have
[1550.84s] contributed so what they&#39;re trying to
[1552.399s] say is that the labor market is not
[1554.84s] cracking yet and Claudia s of the s r
[1557.84s] has been saying similar stuff she&#39;s
[1559.96s] saying pay attention this might time
[1562.0s] might be different but you got to act
[1564.039s] soon is effective what she&#39;s saying so
[1565.919s] maybe it&#39;s the auto retooling and maybe
[1567.88s] it&#39;s also the immigration which we&#39;re
[1569.52s] going to see some data on here uh other
[1572.76s] indicators suggest layoffs remain
[1577.72s] low Bank of America credit and debit
[1580.36s] card spending per household decreased by
[1582.44s] 410 of 1% year onye in July so there&#39;s
[1585.159s] some weakness there
[1589.559s] okay we did the inflation it&#39;s been the
[1592.36s] second longest manufacturing recession
[1594.84s] in history so I could see a situation
[1600.12s] where you have some softening for a
[1604.32s] little bit while Manu you know
[1606.48s] manufacturing has been in a recession
[1608.32s] and we did have that technical recession
[1610.72s] two quarters of negative GDP growth in
[1613.08s] uh first and second quarter of 2022 they
[1615.559s] just didn&#39;t label it as a recession it&#39;s
[1617.36s] like a double dis dip recession just
[1619.48s] like we had during the vulka era and
[1621.36s] then we had 18 years of prosperity
[1624.399s] um I could see a situation where
[1627.12s] manufacturing starts to re accelerate
[1629.24s] and that kind of offsets a a customer
[1632.76s] that&#39;s taking a breather a consumer
[1634.799s] that&#39;s taking a breather although we&#39;re
[1636.64s] going to see from gxo earnings that uh
[1639.44s] the Christmas holiday season based on
[1641.919s] stocks seem to be looking certainly
[1644.44s] better than last year and more
[1646.039s] normalized so I wouldn&#39;t count out you
[1647.799s] know what I always say is don&#39;t count
[1649.08s] out the US consumer if they have a job
[1651.2s] and the question is whether they have
[1652.64s] jobs and and that&#39;s going to be a
[1654.64s] question of whether you believe the most
[1656.24s] recent jobs report was what to expect
[1659.44s] Pro moving forward which means we are
[1662.08s] weakening dramatically or if it was a
[1664.159s] oneof from Auto retooling and from uh
[1668.0s] the immigration Spike number of
[1670.08s] immigrant visas has continued to rise
[1672.399s] you can see it
[1674.84s] there household debt outstanding as a
[1677.24s] share of GDP is down over the past
[1680.679s] decade so the consumer has deleveraged
[1683.399s] tremendously since 2009 household
[1685.64s] balance sheet still in good shape
[1687.72s] Financial Obligations relative to
[1689.279s] incomes are staying low by historical
[1691.0s] standards hasn&#39;t been this low since the
[1693.64s] 60s maybe uh this chart only goes back
[1696.44s] to 1983 so that&#39;s
[1698.679s] positive uh personal bankruptcy filing
[1701.64s] rates are hovering over multi-decade
[1703.48s] lows so you know you see a lot of people
[1705.72s] showing these two-year charts and it&#39;s
[1707.159s] like oh they&#39;re going through the the
[1708.2s] roof but if you go back you know 50
[1710.76s] years they&#39;re way below normal average
[1713.48s] share loans and foreclosure remains very
[1715.679s] low at
[1717.08s] 46% housing affordability index remains
[1720.76s] at record lows this is uh the worst it&#39;s
[1724.08s] been since the vulker vulker
[1726.64s] era uh economic surprise index City
[1729.76s] Group economic surprise index turning up
[1732.48s] this is a key one the election year
[1735.72s] seasonality is kind of going according
[1737.6s] to plan here so far uh we did have that
[1741.399s] correction in Late July early August and
[1743.6s] then it should bode well for strength
[1745.88s] into mid-september and that&#39;s right
[1747.559s] around the first fed cut which
[1750.12s] historically has been sell the first cut
[1752.519s] weakness into the end of October just
[1755.039s] before the election and then year end
[1756.64s] rally I I think that&#39;s going to be the
[1759.0s] model now you know can it be that easy
[1761.36s] the answer is no but it&#39;s a good
[1763.64s] framework and then you adapt based on
[1765.72s] how things play out in in real time but
[1768.32s] uh that&#39;s our base case at the moment uh
[1771.559s] you could see how extreme things got
[1773.44s] here at macro charts off his core risk
[1775.88s] model and bouncing off those lows do we
[1778.84s] go retest those I don&#39;t know if we do or
[1780.919s] we don&#39;t but
[1783.279s] um uh that was that money market assets
[1787.0s] these as rates come down once you get
[1788.72s] the first cut a good slug of these have
[1791.08s] to come back into the market just like
[1793.32s] they did in 2020 you know half a half a
[1795.88s] trillion dollars came into the market
[1798.159s] pretty quickly once they back stop the
[1800.12s] corporate credit Market uh I think the
[1802.559s] same will be true once you get your
[1803.919s] first one or two cuts we get probably a
[1805.88s] half a trillion in for year end into
[1807.799s] equities as people lose out on short
[1810.36s] rates coming down this is going to be
[1812.799s] the most important chart we covered
[1814.279s] today with uh Us sell through on uh
[1819.279s] Auto
[1821.6s] Autos uh pretty excited about that I
[1824.12s] went to
[1825.24s] see Cooper standard at JP Morgan last
[1829.679s] Thursday and um saw the presentation
[1833.12s] talked with uh with the people and um
[1836.36s] I&#39;ll share some some
[1839.44s] um thoughts on that as as we get to the
[1842.159s] article of the
[1843.679s] week Japanese Yen we&#39;ve covered enough
[1846.12s] of
[1847.0s] that hedge funds boost bearish commodity
[1850.799s] bet uh you&#39;re seeing Comstock res
[1853.919s] resources start to rip the last few days
[1855.84s] from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm
[1859.559s] when hedge funds get this bearish on
[1861.519s] Commodities I I think they&#39;re probably
[1863.6s] opportunities in energy I think there a
[1865.679s] few ask me anything questions there but
[1868.12s] uh for my money I I still like com stock
[1870.12s] is is the play uh commodity
[1874.84s] Cycles boom bus Cycles deviations from
[1877.679s] the trend so you can see here it&#39;s
[1880.919s] coming out of the lower
[1885.559s] Trend I did I want to uh
[1892.2s] it&#39;s coming out of a low and checking
[1893.76s] back just like it
[1895.639s] did th this this is a good framework
[1898.84s] model for what we&#39;re
[1901.24s] seeing you had this low and then a rally
[1904.399s] and then check back and then a
[1905.559s] multi-year rally and I think that&#39;s a
[1907.36s] reasonable framework and again that what
[1908.919s] does that point to is 2001 to 2007 I
[1912.799s] think it&#39;s a similar situation over and
[1914.639s] over we keep see seeing very strong
[1917.279s] similarity of all of these things uh no
[1920.2s] one&#39;s buying calls everyone bought puts
[1921.919s] in the holes therefore they had to get
[1923.519s] smoked and they did
[1926.279s] um thank you for playing try again uh
[1930.72s] election year seasonal pattern 1968
[1934.72s] versus 2024 and the reason Jeff Hirsch
[1937.639s] is pointing this one is because LBJ left
[1941.44s] office and then you had a mid July
[1943.48s] correction uh ahead of the Democratic
[1946.12s] Convention and then you had the year end
[1948.36s] rally so this would imply that you don&#39;t
[1951.88s] get any major weakness in October
[1954.24s] meaning it&#39;s just straight up into the
[1956.12s] end of the year if if passes any
[1959.44s] prologue uh which is why you know only
[1962.88s] on things that we&#39;ve seen huge
[1964.48s] multi-baggers would we raise cash um
[1968.32s] certainly on the option side and then
[1970.0s] the underlying stock has to be up 50 75
[1972.96s] 100% And then um
[1981.48s] we&#39;ll see what things look like in
[1982.84s] mid-september is what I&#39;m trying to tell
[1984.279s] you there&#39;s a lot of different analogues
[1985.639s] we can follow the key is we&#39;re
[1987.76s] intermediate term bullish economy is
[1990.08s] good earnings are good 10.8% earnings
[1992.96s] growth versus 8.9% estimated uh
[1996.88s] 15.2% estimated for next year uh GDP now
[2001.08s] at
[2001.88s] 2.9% you know things are humming
[2005.36s] along biggest number one tail risk
[2009.039s] people are saying is a US recession
[2010.919s] that&#39;s If the Fed screws up which
[2012.32s] they&#39;re fully capable of doing but I
[2014.44s] think there&#39;s enough pressure and
[2016.44s] precedent and transparency now that I
[2018.639s] think they&#39;ve got to go in September and
[2020.519s] I think they&#39;ve got to talk doish in um
[2024.159s] I think I I think their best play is if
[2026.2s] they&#39;re being cautious talk like a crazy
[2028.72s] dove in Jackson Hole and then only give
[2031.24s] 25 basis points in September and then if
[2033.799s] you&#39;re wrong you can always go up to you
[2035.72s] can always uh move in November or you
[2038.36s] can go to like a 75 basis point in
[2040.639s] December and signal that in in in
[2043.36s] between and then the market will price
[2044.76s] it in ahead of time European relative to
[2049.159s] 12-month us forward PE this is pretty
[2052.599s] interesting so the European
[2058.24s] PE doing a lot of talking is um 35 to
[2064.079s] 40% lower than the USP and we&#39;re going
[2067.56s] to see and gxo earnings that demand in
[2071.72s] Europe and UK which is where most of
[2073.919s] their business is is exceeding the US
[2077.24s] they&#39;re seeing a little softness in the
[2078.72s] US but they&#39;re seeing a lot of strength
[2080.04s] in Europe and you can buy it at 30 to
[2082.639s] 40% lower which is why we have that UK
[2085.04s] play in serious position in gxo and a
[2087.96s] tiny position in Asos uh which we have
[2091.119s] yet to find a reason to make into a real
[2093.24s] position but we&#39;re keeping an eye on
[2095.359s] it um and looking for some more
[2097.88s] opportunities in Europe as well uh imig
[2102.04s] oh this is this is the chart I wanted to
[2103.56s] show you immigration adjusted
[2105.32s] unemployment rate is lower so remember
[2107.92s] this shot up to 4.3 but if you back out
[2110.48s] the aberrational immigration it&#39;s still
[2113.04s] down at 3.6 and this is the Delta
[2115.599s] between is are we going into a hard
[2117.32s] Landing with the Som rule or is this
[2119.32s] time different because of this
[2120.44s] immigration uh artificial immigration
[2123.2s] Spike
[2125.04s] um which leaves us at 3.6% and that&#39;s
[2128.24s] what you have to keep in mind uh be
[2130.52s] databased and be flexible inflation
[2133.16s] expectations basically down to 10year
[2135.32s] lows for three-year inflation
[2137.839s] expectations at what is it
[2140.32s] 2.3 uh Chinese government bond yields
[2142.96s] started going up that&#39;s very positive
[2145.48s] China goes to New extremes and Crackdown
[2147.32s] on bond market frenzy we want to see
[2149.04s] this go up up up along with
[2151.839s] equities
[2154.599s] um we&#39;ll cover that in the fund manager
[2157.72s] survey but basically you&#39;re seeing
[2159.96s] sentiment levels at the levels you see
[2161.96s] closer to Bottoms not closer to
[2165.079s] Tops which is positive um the gap
[2169.04s] between Mega cap Tech and others is
[2171.0s] shrinking profit growth for magnificent
[2173.0s] 7 starts slowing rest of S&amp;P hits its
[2175.56s] stride we&#39;ve been talking about this for
[2176.96s] months now you can see it happening net
[2179.079s] income growth uh went from 50% now it&#39;s
[2182.24s] down to 25% and going lower uh
[2191.68s] S&amp;P magnificent 7 net income growth now
[2194.76s] starting to move to high single digits
[2197.079s] from being negative up until last
[2200.48s] quarter um feds featuring on earnings
[2203.2s] call like never before so that&#39;s
[2204.76s] becoming a major major issue just like
[2207.44s] it was uh back here it spiked in 2000
[2213.0s] late 2008 when they finally started
[2215.28s] cutting investor sector allocation so
[2218.56s] they&#39;ve gone into defensives Pharma and
[2221.0s] they&#39;re out of discretionary there&#39;ll be
[2222.68s] some opportunities to pick up there you
[2223.88s] saw it in Starbucks by the way we&#39;ve
[2225.76s] talked on it the reason we didn&#39;t get
[2227.68s] involved in
[2228.88s] Starbucks uh or Nike yet and we continue
[2231.68s] to keep our eye we&#39;ll probably miss it
[2233.079s] with Nike you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going
[2234.319s] to wake up and there&#39;ll be an activist
[2235.92s] in Nike and we&#39;ll miss it uh is and Lulu
[2239.24s] for that matter maybe we&#39;ll get one of
[2240.76s] them it&#39;s just a question of what do we
[2242.2s] want to sell well you know we did take
[2243.88s] off at 3M today so maybe there&#39;ll be a
[2245.599s] new spot in the portfolio
[2247.88s] um was just because they had meaningful
[2250.92s] China exposure and we have a meaningful
[2253.48s] China exposure through Baba so we didn&#39;t
[2255.359s] want to have a high correlated trade um
[2258.88s] but we&#39;re going to be open-minded
[2260.48s] because there&#39;s there&#39;s certainly
[2261.72s] opportunity
[2262.839s] there the other thing I thought was
[2264.76s] silly was Nelson Pelt uh I don&#39;t know
[2269.24s] what&#39;s happened to him since Ed Gardner
[2271.24s] left but he&#39;s become like a day trader
[2273.44s] like Disney spiked up and the guy sold
[2276.4s] it partially because they didn&#39;t let him
[2277.88s] on the board then he gets in Starbucks
[2280.079s] it spikes up 20% and he sells it are you
[2282.24s] telling me you put billion dollars in a
[2284.52s] billions of dollars in a position to
[2286.44s] make a 20% gain are you like a day
[2288.599s] trader like why would you
[2290.68s] ever take that big of a position for a
[2293.48s] 20% move like it makes zero sense to me
[2296.359s] so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on over
[2297.88s] there but after Starbucks biked he got
[2299.839s] out which tells me his level of
[2301.4s] confidence in the position which also
[2302.92s] tells me maybe there&#39;ll be another
[2304.44s] chance to get in but I think that&#39;s
[2305.599s] going to be a harder
[2307.64s] ship to correct they couldn&#39;t have
[2309.64s] picked a better guy to do it than the
[2311.44s] guy from Chipotle but I think it&#39;ll take
[2313.96s] some time and after the honeymoon is
[2315.88s] over um maybe there&#39;ll be new
[2317.88s] opportunity but I I I really don&#39;t want
[2319.48s] to compete with luckan in China so for
[2321.72s] me uh certainly with the last CEO it was
[2324.24s] an absolute no uh with the new CEO it&#39;s
[2326.96s] a maybe but uh I&#39;m not paying up for it
[2329.64s] so we&#39;ll keep an eye on that
[2331.44s] one lower uh bond yield expectations
[2334.76s] back to 2023 highs so this the last time
[2339.079s] they had the lower bond yield
[2341.64s] expectations at this level was November
[2343.56s] 2008 which started a huge cutting cycle
[2346.0s] expectations for lower short rates
[2347.72s] highest on record going back to March
[2349.72s] 2020 which was the bottom of the market
[2351.56s] as well PPI we we saw vix has rolled
[2356.04s] over uh recent immigrants labor force
[2358.599s] share has risen sharply and their
[2360.2s] unemployment rate has also trended
[2361.92s] upward which is skewed the overall which
[2364.28s] is what we were talking about on the ear
[2365.96s] earlier part we estimate that net IM
[2367.96s] immigration into the US reached 2.9
[2370.72s] Million people in 2023 1.9 million above
[2374.0s] the pre pandemic Trend will slow to 2.2
[2377.2s] million in
[2379.0s] 2024 uh this is the percent of companies
[2382.44s] with positive 12mth percent changes in
[2384.88s] forward earnings this is not the stuff
[2387.0s] you see at the end of a cycle ladies and
[2388.64s] gentlemen this looks exactly like the
[2391.04s] previous Cycles you get the huge Spike
[2392.64s] off the lows after the recession you
[2394.28s] should have a recession line here in
[2396.0s] 2022 cuz we two quarters of negative GDP
[2398.96s] growth and then it rolls over and then
[2401.839s] you start the recovery rolls over start
[2403.76s] the recovery rolls over starts to
[2406.0s] recovery uh or in the case of 2009 rolls
[2409.319s] you know Spike off the low then a check
[2411.48s] back and then you continue higher Spike
[2413.76s] off the low check back continue higher
[2415.64s] but that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing right now
[2416.68s] this is not what we see at tops is all
[2418.8s] I&#39;m trying to communicate with you uh
[2421.0s] that&#39;s the seasonal pattern some updates
[2422.599s] on the news in no particular order
[2425.04s] Chinese stocks get upgraded as bare
[2426.56s] Market risks seem tempered by state
[2428.4s] buying support Canadian research firm
[2430.2s] says Chinese stocks uh in good stad and
[2434.2s] they&#39;re pointing to the uh Japanese hot
[2436.8s] money flows coming out as well Bloomberg
[2439.04s] intelligence predicts Alibaba and other
[2441.079s] Doom Giants to announce more share
[2443.16s] BuyBacks Disney stock Falls after
[2446.16s] downgrade two things going wrong what&#39;s
[2447.92s] going right it&#39;s so funny when you click
[2449.76s] they change these lines Dynamic the they
[2452.079s] changed the headlines dynamically based
[2455.079s] on what the stock price is doing
[2457.359s] intraday which is kind of comical it&#39;s
[2459.319s] like they completely blow with the wind
[2461.2s] but I guess that&#39;s what you have to do
[2463.04s] in that business to stay alive and um
[2466.72s] we&#39;ll talk a little bit about Disney but
[2468.28s] this analyst took the price Target down
[2470.16s] to 225 so everyone&#39;s worried about the
[2472.92s] park slowing down for a couple of
[2474.4s] quarters they released a whole bunch of
[2476.64s] new stuff over the weekend which we&#39;ll
[2478.16s] talk about um but the big story if you
[2482.319s] remember most of the reason we got in
[2484.88s] parks are great highest return on
[2486.48s] invested capital
[2487.8s] but value Act is the activist in this
[2489.92s] stock and value act turned around
[2491.88s] Salesforce it turned around um New York
[2495.28s] Times if they could turn around New York
[2496.8s] Times they could turn around anything
[2498.16s] they made New York Times profitable they
[2500.52s] turned around
[2502.17s] [Music]
[2503.599s] um Spotify so those were the three
[2506.04s] Salesforce New York Times Spotify and
[2508.359s] they did it all through pricing bundles
[2510.079s] and increasing the prices and as you saw
[2512.28s] which the market didn&#39;t respond to they
[2513.72s] raised the prices right before earnings
[2516.079s] and they&#39;re going to add the ES SPN to
[2517.88s] all the bundles all that business is
[2520.0s] being valued at zero right now it&#39;s got
[2522.319s] 153 million subscribers on the Disney
[2524.599s] Plus Part alone leaving aside ESPN which
[2526.88s] is the number one franchise in sports
[2529.4s] gaining share not losing share and
[2531.28s] they&#39;re going to monetize that through
[2532.72s] streaming uh and so if it&#39;s half what
[2535.64s] what Netflix is Netflix is valued at you
[2537.8s] know 300 billion um for you know 277
[2542.44s] million subscribers they&#39;ve probably got
[2544.319s] 200 across platforms they&#39;re valued at
[2546.359s] zero I&#39;m I&#39;m going to take a wild and
[2548.68s] crazy bet that it&#39;s worth more than zero
[2550.68s] Disney plus Wolverine uh inside out to
[2554.88s] both billion dollar franchises
[2556.319s] theatrical releases Disney Hulu all that
[2559.119s] stuff and um let&#39;s just assume it&#39;s not
[2561.88s] worth half of uh Netflix let&#39;s assume
[2564.319s] it&#39;s worth a quarter of at the end of
[2566.4s] the day it still takes the stock between
[2568.52s] 150 to 200 over the next few years and
[2571.359s] that&#39;s what we need the options will be
[2572.76s] a lot you know the stock will be a
[2574.2s] double the options will be multi-baggers
[2576.44s] and we&#39;ll be r in the register like 3M
[2579.28s] in no time no time was a year and a half
[2581.8s] so there you go retail investors haven&#39;t
[2584.0s] been this pessimistic in 9 months that&#39;s
[2586.319s] that&#39;s the periods that we like to be
[2588.28s] looking for opportunity PayPal stock
[2590.72s] Rises uh its fast track to better
[2593.72s] margins with new guest checkout system
[2595.599s] we&#39;ve been talking about this for months
[2597.68s] uh 80% conversion at checkout versus 50%
[2600.599s] the competition which means you can
[2602.119s] charge more because you&#39;d rather pay you
[2604.839s] know 200 basis points on on an 80 or 90%
[2608.559s] conversion then 100 basis points on a
[2610.52s] 50% conversion just do the math if it&#39;s
[2613.079s] a $100 ticket and uh and that&#39;s going to
[2616.2s] increase margins increase uh payment
[2620.079s] volume increase earnings increase cash
[2621.96s] flow and as we covered before they said
[2624.64s] oh by the way we&#39;re not going to do five
[2626.079s] billion in free cash flow this year
[2627.559s] we&#39;re going to do six billion oh and by
[2629.559s] the way we&#39;re uh we&#39;re not going to do
[2632.319s] $5 billion in BuyBacks we&#39;re going to do
[2634.28s] $6 billion in BuyBacks oh and by the way
[2637.119s] do you remember just a quarter ago when
[2639.28s] he had that negative that uh really
[2641.68s] conservative guidance and I called him
[2643.2s] sandbagger in Chief well this was
[2645.4s] evidence of it this quarter uh as you
[2647.559s] see he&#39;s already blowing estimates out
[2650.04s] of the water he didn&#39;t even wait a
[2651.359s] quarter to keep us in suspense he just
[2653.68s] you know uh the uh the foreplay is over
[2657.52s] I mean we&#39;re we&#39;re getting down to
[2658.72s] business here this guy is rocking and
[2660.119s] rolling so uh Disney raises streaming
[2662.48s] prices through for Hulu Disney and ESPN
[2665.48s] if you remember the guy Alex the new CEO
[2668.079s] he
[2668.8s] ran the small business division at into
[2671.64s] it the stock was a 28 bagger plus while
[2674.559s] he was there and he was responsible for
[2676.72s] 50% of the revenues this guy&#39;s going to
[2678.4s] do it he&#39;s already doing it in just you
[2680.599s] know he&#39;s basically just found the
[2682.2s] coffee machine he&#39;s only been there for
[2683.599s] three quarters and it&#39;s Off to the Races
[2685.76s] yum China gobbles up
[2688.079s] gains uh State Council prepares service
[2690.72s] consumption policy China&#39;s CPI went up
[2694.24s] it&#39;s starting to improve that&#39;s a sign
[2696.0s] of recovery not decline fres shipo which
[2699.319s] is kind of could be the Costco of China
[2701.68s] which we own through
[2702.92s] Alibaba uh achieves four months of
[2705.119s] profitability after major restructuring
[2707.0s] so all these things are turning around
[2708.599s] Intel stock may have bottomed at
[2710.24s] tangible Book value that&#39;s from uh we
[2713.04s] posted over the weekend from
[2715.079s] Barons why am I not signed in here and
[2719.28s] tangible Book value just for you guys
[2721.4s] that are new to this uh is basically
[2723.44s] what you get when they liquidate the
[2724.72s] whole company uh so you&#39;re basically
[2727.16s] trading at liquidation value uh I like
[2731.48s] opportunities like that where your
[2732.88s] downside is is uh uh covered and your
[2736.359s] upside is unlimited and uh we like this
[2738.88s] story so we covered it last week we did
[2740.76s] about an hour and a half on it go back
[2742.2s] to that podcast and listen if you&#39;re
[2743.96s] interested why why buffets dumped 55.8%
[2747.68s] of its Apple stock well I one reason
[2749.68s] could be that uh it&#39;s historically
[2752.28s] traded at a 14 times multiple now it was
[2754.52s] at a 28 to 30 times multiple oh and by
[2757.559s] the way the earnings growth expectations
[2759.48s] have haved so you&#39;re paying you know
[2762.24s] twice as much for half the growth other
[2764.319s] than that how is the play Mrs Lincoln
[2766.559s] from villains to Indiana Jones
[2768.2s] everything we learned at Disney&#39;s Parks
[2770.48s] panel 2024 d23 Expo that&#39;s a mouthful uh
[2775.04s] so they&#39;re going to do a villain land
[2776.8s] coming to the Magic
[2778.4s] Kingdom uh for all the evildoers out
[2781.16s] there that like to uh go to villain
[2783.92s] parks with their kids uh have at it uh
[2787.68s] they&#39;re doing uh more cruise ships
[2790.16s] they&#39;re you know they&#39;re they&#39;re
[2791.24s] basically laying out all the things that
[2792.88s] they&#39;re going to invest in and how it&#39;s
[2795.359s] going to be great and they&#39;re not asleep
[2796.8s] at the wheel and we know all that stuff
[2798.599s] China goes to otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be
[2800.24s] owners China goes to New extreme and
[2802.319s] crack down on B market friendsy go after
[2804.44s] it it&#39;s time you get off your butt and
[2806.52s] you know turn this ship around Baxter to
[2809.079s] sell its Kidney Care business so they
[2810.52s] got four bli $3.8 billion going to use 3
[2813.92s] billion to cut down the um
[2817.4s] uh to sell off their debt they were
[2818.68s] originally going to spend that to us
[2820.28s] that&#39;s a low growth business so uh the
[2823.88s] fact that they&#39;re getting rid of it
[2826.48s] number one I don&#39;t know if we would have
[2828.2s] hung off hung on to that spin-off to be
[2830.04s] honest with you the the kidney dialysis
[2832.359s] business uh we usually really like
[2835.319s] spin-offs like svent so I&#39;m glad they
[2838.24s] sold it they&#39;ll take the debt down by 3
[2840.44s] billion which is going to take down
[2841.52s] their interest cost oh and by the way
[2843.52s] because they don&#39;t have the slow growth
[2845.119s] of the kidney business they multiples is
[2847.28s] going to get rated from 10 to a
[2848.8s] normalized 15 uh over the next few
[2851.48s] months and their free cash flow is going
[2853.88s] to go up because they have less uh
[2856.52s] interest payments for Debt Service and
[2858.52s] they&#39;ve got a lean mean money-making
[2859.96s] machine so we like this we&#39;re very
[2862.319s] excited no change in Outlook uh and
[2866.04s] there you go uh stock down 54% is it
[2869.24s] time to buy the dip on this growth stock
[2870.92s] which is gxo
[2872.359s] logistics uh amen baby you preaching to
[2875.079s] the choir we&#39;re going to talk about that
[2876.599s] one in the article of the week alibaba&#39;s
[2878.72s] lazzada post first monthly profit amid
[2880.88s] intense competition in Southeast Asia so
[2883.079s] they turn that profit around from losing
[2885.28s] money to making money how China just
[2887.599s] like they did with
[2890.16s] fipo uh how China stocks could break out
[2893.44s] of the value trap so this guy put out
[2897.2s] this chart which shows the csi300 versus
[2900.48s] estimated EPs and what he&#39;s basically
[2902.4s] saying is every time it got this extreme
[2904.8s] you got a huge rally in equities we know
[2907.079s] the story it&#39;s time China expects air
[2909.68s] travel to hit a record in 2024 amen
[2912.28s] hallelujah China delivers another harsh
[2914.16s] verbal warning to bond buyers um there
[2917.24s] you go so uh look if you want to get
[2920.4s] people out of your bonds and into your
[2922.16s] stocks uh you know start buying more
[2925.359s] stocks and when the price goes up the
[2927.16s] opinion will follow Trend and then you
[2928.64s] get some natural buyers the the stock
[2930.799s] market could double and it would still
[2932.16s] be cheap so um you want to solve your
[2934.96s] problem for any of the Chinese policy
[2936.799s] makers that are listening to this um do
[2939.64s] what Japan did start buying equities get
[2942.48s] a bid in it opinion will follow Trend
[2944.96s] and then you&#39;ll get a normalized
[2946.04s] multiple and then the game will be on
[2948.0s] like you saw in Japan the difference is
[2950.079s] you&#39;ve got five years of supportive
[2952.079s] demographics before you fall off a cliff
[2954.92s] uh Japan does not so uh that&#39;s why Japan
[2957.559s] hot money is going to come out and it&#39;s
[2958.88s] going to come into China once the
[2960.76s] Chinese uh policy makers get with it and
[2963.2s] realize there&#39;s an opportunity sitting
[2964.76s] right in front of them Home Depot stock
[2966.839s] bounces as Home Improvement demand may
[2968.44s] have just bottomed so that&#39;s good to see
[2970.92s] everyone had been negative that&#39;s all
[2972.559s] going to be a function of rat Stanley
[2973.92s] Black and Decker is going to be a
[2975.0s] function of rates J is going to be a
[2977.04s] function of rates as much as they&#39;ve all
[2978.559s] both already rallied they&#39;re just
[2980.04s] getting started Wells Fargo strategist
[2982.2s] says investors May face a 1995 rerun
[2984.68s] once fed Cuts rates we agree midcycle
[2987.44s] cut massive rally uh just get it done on
[2990.72s] time and then the FED Whisperer who I
[2992.4s] was on Liz Clayman show last week with
[2994.599s] Nick
[2995.44s] timos uh says basically the CPI report
[2999.559s] this morning clears the low hurdle first
[3001.2s] September rate cut so game on basically
[3004.44s] from the horse&#39;s mouth the article of
[3006.72s] the week just published a couple minutes
[3008.52s] ago so I&#39;ll be able to check for
[3010.04s] spelling errors in real time restock
[3012.359s] cycle stock market and sentiment results
[3014.44s] that&#39;s probably the lamest title I&#39;ve
[3016.52s] ever done but uh I couldn&#39;t figure out
[3019.2s] anything to rhyme with restock so there
[3022.24s] you go last Tuesday Thursday I uh we did
[3025.319s] that okay wanted to do this update on
[3027.4s] Cooper standard since going to the
[3029.24s] presentation at uh JP Morgan last week
[3032.4s] on Madison
[3034.319s] Avenue and what was
[3037.96s] exciting about this is there wasn&#39;t
[3040.4s] anything new other than the fact
[3044.0s] um that they talked
[3047.64s] about what they&#39;re seeing in terms of
[3050.76s] incentives in the market picking up and
[3053.68s] that they&#39;ve been following this for
[3055.68s] decades cuz all these guys are lifelong
[3060.319s] Auto industry people and you know I have
[3064.119s] indicators that are pretty much
[3065.48s] guarantees in in my work and they have
[3067.2s] indicators that are pretty much
[3068.2s] guarantees in their work and one of
[3069.48s] their indicators is when incentives from
[3073.319s] dealers and manufacturers start ticking
[3075.96s] up volumes quickly follow and I&#39;m going
[3079.16s] to explain how that&#39;s counterintuitive
[3081.28s] in just a minute but let&#39;s go to this
[3083.44s] chart to start with uh as a reminder in
[3088.799s] 2018
[3090.88s] the national sell through was 18 million
[3096.079s] units of vehicles in the US so that was
[3099.96s] right here November 2017 18 million
[3103.4s] units on that
[3105.559s] basis Cooper standard did
[3108.359s] $722 a share in earnings in
[3112.799s] earnings the stock traded at $146
[3117.68s] so you basically had a 20 times multiple
[3120.24s] on that earnings
[3122.48s] power let me move ahead here last week
[3125.4s] we went into detail on Cooper standard
[3126.92s] earnings outlooks and Prospects moving
[3128.359s] forward as well as our original thesis
[3129.839s] from May 20222 when we initiated the
[3131.96s] position around $5.50 a share you can
[3134.48s] find it here so click there and read the
[3136.16s] whole thing and then click on the link
[3137.359s] in that article that goes to our old
[3139.04s] articles from May of 2022 one concept I
[3142.16s] wanted to point out is that since
[3144.48s] 1980 every single cycle has peaked out
[3147.48s] at 18 million SAR expectations for 2024
[3151.44s] were that the industry would do 16.1
[3153.559s] million this year it has since been
[3156.4s] revised down to 15.8 million so here&#39;s
[3159.96s] 18 million we&#39;re at 158 this is 18 158
[3164.44s] 18 158 18 now look at the last cycle
[3168.559s] 2005 it peaked actually above 20 but it
[3170.92s] was you know 18 for some time at the top
[3172.92s] of the cycle it stays up at 18 for a few
[3175.48s] years before it rolls over okay so it
[3177.76s] was at 18 from you know
[3180.92s] 2006
[3183.079s] to 2004 to 2006 basically then the
[3186.599s] previous cycle before that was the late
[3188.24s] 90s it got up over 18 in
[3190.96s] 1999 then the previous cycle before that
[3193.68s] it got over got again peaked over 20
[3196.079s] actually but mostly over 18 in like 1987
[3199.24s] and
[3201.2s] 1986 and they also all trough below 10
[3204.839s] million in 1981 it trough below 10
[3207.559s] million in 2008 it trough below 10
[3209.68s] million in 2020 it trough below 10
[3212.28s] million it&#39;s mind bogging considering
[3213.839s] how much the population has grown
[3215.92s] leaving that
[3217.359s] aside if we know that it&#39;s going to 18
[3220.52s] million for shizel as Snoop Dog the
[3223.88s] Olympic MC would say then we know that
[3228.119s] what can the question is if we know what
[3231.119s] the industry volume is is going to be
[3233.68s] whether it&#39;s two years out or four years
[3235.64s] out then we can back into what can
[3239.04s] Cooper standard earn on that and then
[3240.92s] what will the market pay for it so you
[3242.96s] could say well that&#39;s very easy well if
[3244.88s] they did $18 million in 2017 and they
[3247.079s] earned
[3247.88s] $7.20 then the stock could be $140 again
[3251.48s] or maybe if it doesn&#39;t get a 20 times
[3253.359s] multiple maybe it gets a 10 times
[3254.68s] multiple it could be $70 again well
[3256.319s] that&#39;s good we bought it at $550 it&#39;s at
[3258.52s] $13 any new money that comes in we&#39;re
[3260.76s] buying a ton at 122 and $13 we&#39;re we&#39;re
[3262.96s] super happy to add at the these levels
[3265.2s] super cheap now now one of the key
[3267.96s] factors which is a leading indicator of
[3270.0s] volumes is incentives offered in recent
[3271.68s] years the oems have experienced the
[3273.44s] housian days of controlling supplies and
[3276.119s] selling above MSRP with a wink and a nod
[3279.44s] all the oems followed suit until now as
[3282.079s] inventories build partially due to the
[3284.4s] artificial EV push that was not met with
[3286.839s] natural demand incentives are starting
[3289.28s] to accelerate meaning there&#39;s cards on
[3291.0s] the Lots they got to move them this is
[3292.839s] the key leading indicator of increasing
[3295.319s] volumes to come to the lay person one
[3297.68s] would think that they are increasing
[3299.44s] incentives because no one wants to buy
[3301.2s] cars therefore volumes will fall the
[3304.16s] opposite is true the high rates high
[3306.92s] prices and low supply has led to pent up
[3309.88s] Demand with average car on the road now
[3312.16s] over 13 years old which is a record high
[3316.599s] the Korean manufacturers will continue
[3318.88s] to ramp cost ramp lower cost
[3322.2s] Alternatives forcing the US and Japan
[3324.72s] oems to follow suit and offer incentives
[3327.119s] to move their current inventories take a
[3329.359s] look at this
[3336.2s] chart this is the average age by vehicle
[3339.0s] type you can see here Passenger cars at
[3341.0s] 14 years
[3342.599s] old light trucked at 12 years old
[3346.359s] combined at 12.6 years this will hurt
[3349.599s] OEM margins GM Ford Stanis Toyota Motor
[3354.0s] Corp so to make up the profit they will
[3356.96s] have to produce more volume to meet
[3359.079s] profitability goals if they hold out for
[3362.0s] Price meaning they they&#39;re unwilling to
[3364.52s] cut they will lose meaningful share the
[3367.039s] race to the bottom will be on this is
[3369.44s] good news for the consumer good for auto
[3372.0s] suppliers that benefit from volumes and
[3374.16s] less so for oems we don&#39;t own any oems
[3376.88s] our play is for volume through Cooper
[3378.72s] standard so what could this actually
[3381.0s] mean for Cooper standard forget about
[3382.92s] what it means when production peaked
[3385.24s] Peaks at 18 million seever several years
[3387.72s] out like every cycle for the last 45
[3389.68s] years just a move from 15.8 million SAR
[3393.4s] where we are now to 16.1 million will
[3396.559s] have a massive impact to earnings per
[3399.24s] share due to CPS operating leverage we
[3403.48s] estimate that another 300,000 cars could
[3406.76s] yield $50 million straight to the bottom
[3409.88s] line that&#39;s on 17 million shares so um
[3414.24s] that given how efficient efficiently CPS
[3417.68s] is now running that implies $3 a share
[3420.039s] in earnings approximately $3 a share in
[3423.24s] earnings as a friendly reminder when
[3425.559s] Cooper standard was bloated and running
[3427.599s] inefficiently in 2017 the stock traded
[3430.76s] up to $146 a share on $7 a share of
[3434.079s] earnings per share at 20 times multiple
[3436.359s] historically when profitable CPS is
[3438.16s] traded between a trough multiple of 10
[3439.92s] times and a peak multiple of 20 times so
[3442.599s] if we can go just to 16.1 million SAR
[3445.92s] and earn $3 a share at 10 to 20 *
[3448.92s] multiple 3 * EPS * 10 or 20 * multiple
[3451.96s] equals $30 to $60 per share price what
[3454.839s] could the business do on a peak SAR of
[3457.48s] $18 million a few years out the answer
[3459.88s] is a lot more than it did on 18 million
[3462.72s] SAR in 2017 because the margins are
[3465.68s] better and the cost structure is
[3467.2s] rationalized an assumption of $3 a share
[3469.64s] for every 300,000 additional SAR after
[3472.68s] 16.1 million might be too optimistic but
[3475.599s] what if we cut C that in half I don&#39;t
[3477.319s] think it&#39;s tooo optimistic but let&#39;s
[3478.559s] just cut it in half $11.50 more EPS per
[3482.0s] 300,000 cars from 16.1 million to18
[3485.079s] million equals 6.33 * 1.5 = $99.50 a
[3490.119s] share EPS plus the $3 from 15.8 to 16.1
[3495.2s] equals $12.50 a share EPS or 75% more
[3499.839s] earnings power than when it traded at
[3502.0s] $146 a share there are no guarantees in
[3505.119s] anything there&#39;s always always execution
[3507.0s] risk Market risk unknown risk
[3510.0s] Etc hedge fund
[3512.559s] tips opinions not advice C
[3517.799s] terms
[3518.9s] [Music]
[3520.64s] um that said no matter how
[3522.68s] conservatively you continue to cut it in
[3524.88s] half the potential
[3526.48s] upside you still wind up with a very
[3529.319s] attractive risk reward profile which is
[3531.2s] why we&#39;ve continued to add shares along
[3532.92s] the way just as we rarely buy 100% all
[3535.76s] at once we rarely sell all at once to be
[3538.079s] when we&#39;ll be taking profits all the way
[3539.48s] up to be pessimistic you have to take
[3541.88s] the view that less people will buy cars
[3545.68s] when the FED lowers rates and the prices
[3548.64s] come down and less people will buy cars
[3552.0s] when the average automobile ages past 14
[3555.28s] years old I&#39;m not willing to take those
[3557.88s] bets which is why we have such a
[3559.28s] material position in Cooper standard
[3562.16s] here are rate odds cuts for September
[3565.359s] which for those of you who are not good
[3567.28s] with math is about a month away uh this
[3570.559s] is 2third odds of a 25 basis point cut
[3573.76s] one3 odd of a 50 basis point cut and
[3577.599s] 100% odds of easing so those are good
[3580.359s] odds um Bank of America fund manager
[3582.96s] survey update on Wednesday we put out a
[3584.92s] summary of the monthly Bank of America
[3586.4s] Global fund manager survey this month
[3588.599s] they surveyed institutional managers
[3590.2s] with 500 billion AUM here were the key
[3592.599s] points you can check out the whole
[3594.24s] summary here number number one most the
[3597.48s] most number of survey participants in 16
[3599.4s] years believe monetary policy is too
[3601.2s] restrictive the last few peaks in this
[3603.559s] level of too restrictive belief marked
[3606.52s] at or near bottoms to buy cyclical small
[3608.839s] cap dividend payers and international
[3610.359s] stocks with the FED funds rate greater
[3612.28s] than 200 basis points above inflation we
[3614.319s] concur with this point of view so here
[3616.4s] our manager saying you&#39;re too
[3617.559s] restrictive and what happened after each
[3619.52s] instance number one the market bottomed
[3621.24s] and number two the FED kite number two
[3623.4s] sentiment is climbing the wall of worry
[3625.039s] but not at extreme so this is not the
[3627.44s] type of sentiment you see at tops it&#39;s
[3629.52s] more like the sentiment you see near
[3631.119s] bottoms utilities exposure has
[3633.2s] skyrocketed to 1.4 standard deviations
[3635.68s] above its long-term average you remember
[3637.319s] last year we were pounding the table by
[3639.72s] by um by utilities when no one wanted
[3642.44s] them they&#39;re up 50% now everyone wants
[3644.68s] them I think it&#39;s probably sold to U
[3646.359s] time long magnificent 7 is still the
[3648.76s] most crowded trade despite a recent 18%
[3651.88s] correction so there&#39;s probably a little
[3653.88s] bit more pain there from uh uh from some
[3657.24s] spots managers Outlook pessimism on the
[3659.88s] economy mirrors levels you see near
[3662.28s] Market bottoms versus Market tops
[3664.319s] investors who see stronger global
[3665.839s] economy in the next 12 months this is
[3667.599s] what you saw in 2009 huge rally this is
[3670.4s] what you saw at the 2020 lows huge rally
[3673.28s] all right gxo Logistics update here were
[3675.4s] the highlights they had 19% Revenue
[3677.319s] year-over-year but that was because they
[3679.44s] closed the winon acquisition in the UK
[3682.28s] they&#39;re going to have $50 million of
[3683.72s] synergies out of that one 2% or organic
[3686.799s] Revenue growth 270 million in new
[3689.44s] business wins sales pipel increased to
[3691.64s] 12-month high of 2.3 billion on track to
[3695.44s] sign up a record amount of new business
[3697.839s] this year uh sequential Improvement in
[3700.92s] organic revenue and strong free cash
[3702.96s] flow reaffirm their guidance and
[3705.68s] strengthening consumer demand in the UK
[3707.88s] which is 50% they generated 115 million
[3710.96s] of cash flow from operation compared to
[3713.16s] 61 million year on-year and 31 million
[3716.92s] of free cash flow compared to 3 million
[3719.4s] they&#39;re guiding at 30 to 40% free cash
[3722.279s] flow conversion uh on 800
[3726.64s] and call it 20 million adjusted eidos so
[3731.52s] call it 300 million of free cash flow
[3733.319s] backend loaded which is usually in line
[3735.88s] with their
[3737.799s] seasonality also in line with what
[3739.68s] they&#39;re seeing uh regarding inventory
[3743.4s] levels for the holiday season which are
[3746.44s] much better than last year which was
[3748.44s] disappointing the restock cycle has
[3751.839s] begun uh they did adjusted eida of 187
[3756.319s] million this
[3757.799s] quarter
[3759.64s] and operating cash flow of5
[3763.279s] million you can
[3765.96s] see that you can see the recent winds
[3768.319s] and expansions from Levis is a big deal
[3770.599s] in Germany uh they&#39;re getting some of
[3772.92s] the Industrials now rathon in UK
[3777.079s] Boeing
[3779.24s] carfor uh wh Smith
[3782.279s] trindall Etc and then their wins came
[3787.0s] from 21 from competitors 32% new
[3790.72s] activity from existing and 47% came from
[3794.559s] uh clients that were Outsourcing their
[3796.96s] supply chain management and Logistics
[3798.88s] Outsourcing to gxo which is a trend why
[3802.319s] because your margins increase when you
[3804.119s] Outsource that business and uh and
[3806.359s] that&#39;s a good thing for earnings and
[3807.64s] that&#39;s a good thing for uh CEO stock
[3810.0s] options and they all want to do it and
[3811.76s] that trend is going to accelerate in
[3813.64s] coming
[3814.88s] years
[3816.48s] um so you can see the revenue growth
[3818.88s] here you can see the return uh operating
[3822.72s] return on invested Capital was
[3824.76s] 32% 2% above their
[3827.44s] target uh net income to average invested
[3831.119s] Capital was 133% and then cash flow from
[3833.839s] operations we covered as it relates to
[3837.52s] the earnings call this was a big deal he
[3840.799s] says the CEO says um Malcolm Wilson says
[3845.599s] as we&#39;ve mentioned we believe we saw the
[3847.76s] bottom of the inventory cycle in the
[3850.68s] fourth quarter of last year we&#39;re beyond
[3853.52s] that inflection point and we&#39;re seeing
[3855.16s] volume Trends beginning to improve
[3857.319s] e-commerce has returned to a sustainable
[3859.0s] structural growth about half the
[3861.16s] contracts we signed this quarter were
[3862.4s] from newly outsourced
[3864.72s] activities uh we acquired winon added
[3867.2s] attractive
[3868.52s] valuation 2027 targets of
[3871.88s] 15.5 to6 billion do of Revenue and $
[3876.72s] 1.25 to $1.3 billion of adjusted
[3880.92s] eida which is uh 30 40% free cash flow
[3885.319s] conversion half a bill I
[3890.44s] mean and I think their free cash flow
[3894.039s] conversion will actually Excel at as as
[3896.4s] you get that far out so that gives you
[3898.319s] an idea
[3900.039s] there
[3902.88s] um all right definitely okay so in the
[3905.88s] Q&amp;A he says definitely UK and
[3907.44s] Continental Europe they&#39;ve remained
[3909.0s] stronger that&#39;s about 2third of our
[3910.92s] business not yet seeing that return to
[3912.88s] growth in North America still a little
[3914.68s] uncertain what we&#39;re seeing is
[3916.079s] tremendous amount of new business
[3917.319s] activity in fact we sign new more new
[3919.799s] business in our North American Business
[3921.24s] recently then for a long time I think
[3923.44s] we&#39;re on target for a record in our
[3925.24s] North American activity for new business
[3927.52s] signings so inventory levels also we
[3930.319s] definitely started to see those return
[3932.839s] uh so from that low point of the end of
[3936.52s] last year I think that was really the
[3938.599s] inflection point for inventory levels
[3940.799s] across all regions definitely we&#39;re
[3942.48s] seeing inventory levels come back
[3944.4s] customers already starting I think to
[3946.24s] prepare for this year&#39;s holiday season
[3948.2s] sales have been strong sales pipelines
[3950.44s] really strong deal size is getting big
[3952.52s] bigger duration of contracts getting
[3954.52s] bigger um
[3959.039s] um Continental Europe UK we feel the
[3961.52s] business is very good trajectory of
[3966.44s] growth North America still a little bit
[3969.039s] uncertain but we do see the signs of an
[3971.68s] improving situation later in the year
[3973.76s] not least the fact we&#39;ve got the holiday
[3975.72s] season ahead of
[3979.48s] us this year&#39;s period will be better
[3982.2s] period for us than last year as far as
[3983.76s] it relates to the holiday
[3986.2s] season free cash flow blah blah
[3989.68s] blah as you would recall our cash flow
[3992.279s] Trends tend to be second half tilted
[3993.72s] every year so our guidance is reflecting
[3995.48s] that uh fear and greed index down to 26
[3998.079s] up from 21 last week so there&#39;s still a
[3999.799s] lot of fear in the market which creates
[4001.079s] opportunity into that first cut and then
[4004.559s] uh economic data we covered the PPI and
[4008.039s] CPI were the big
[4009.64s] deals um you
[4014.079s] have uh
[4018.52s] the CPI today came in at 0 2% which was
[4022.559s] in line with expectations uh year on-ear
[4025.24s] came in at 2.9 versus estimates of 3.0
[4028.24s] and last print was 3.0 so that was
[4030.88s] better than expected on CPI also better
[4032.96s] than expected on PPI at 2.2 versus 2.3
[4036.76s] which is the leading indicator for CPI
[4038.88s] and month on Monon was 0.1 versus 0.2
[4041.559s] all the other numbers don&#39;t matter uh
[4044.279s] earnings as we covered better than
[4046.16s] expected 10.8% versus 8.9 but the most
[4049.96s] important thing is guidance has been
[4051.72s] revised up by 1% since the beginning of
[4053.76s] January still holding in at 279 for next
[4057.079s] year so the podcast is over we&#39;re going
[4059.44s] to go into the ask me anything questions
[4061.599s] from our listeners for everyone who
[4063.24s] likes that please stick around um Gasper
[4067.52s] mahark says hi Tom big fan of the
[4070.279s] podcast I&#39;m with you on PayPal Baba vfc
[4072.44s] was wondering if you are maybe looking
[4074.92s] at w BD in light of a recent drop
[4078.319s] management is selling it as a turnaround
[4080.24s] but it seems to be a grind any thoughts
[4082.24s] uh I&#39;m not going to get involved in that
[4083.64s] we&#39;ve looked at that three or four times
[4085.039s] in the ask me anything question I don&#39;t
[4086.96s] like I mean zlov is pulling $40 million
[4089.48s] a year in salary and and destroying the
[4091.319s] company I think there is value there I
[4093.72s] don&#39;t want to be evolved with it I think
[4095.279s] it&#39;s got too much debt I know it&#39;s got
[4097.0s] free cash flow it&#39;s just too hairy for
[4099.12s] me at the moment so I&#39;m going to pass um
[4102.319s] I&#39;m and and I don&#39;t want a correlation
[4104.239s] Disney I&#39;ve got a margin of safety cuz I
[4106.48s] got the parks I got everything else um
[4110.239s] so I&#39;m happy with Disney I don&#39;t need to
[4111.92s] play in the gutter with uh Warner
[4114.0s] Brothers if it works it&#39;ll be a triple
[4116.04s] quadruple if it doesn&#39;t you got goose
[4118.319s] egg not interested in that Disney if
[4121.04s] it&#39;s if it fails I&#39;m down 20% for a
[4123.88s] little while if it succeeds I&#39;m up
[4125.88s] double and my options are up three and
[4127.4s] 4x and that&#39;s uh highly probable so uh
[4131.159s] Jim Jones was wondering about com
[4133.799s] stock um yeah the reason the share count
[4137.12s] increased is because um Jerry Jones put
[4141.6s] up a lot of equity for the company to
[4143.52s] write out the shorter term Thing Once
[4145.799s] the free cash flow kicks on as natural
[4147.759s] gas prices they&#39;ll buy in the stock and
[4149.88s] it&#39;ll be back to the races I I still
[4152.12s] like it and that&#39;s basically what it was
[4154.88s] and uh and we&#39;re comfortable with that
[4156.839s] Conrad voy and that&#39;s very common in
[4158.96s] those e&amp;p companies also their share
[4161.12s] count expands and then it contracts once
[4163.319s] the cash flow spets go through the roof
[4165.4s] because they don&#39;t do so in a linear
[4166.679s] fashion they do so in a parabolic
[4168.279s] fashion and when the cash gushes they
[4170.159s] just buy in all that excess share count
[4172.52s] and it just goes to the moon um and it&#39;s
[4176.6s] trading not only nowhere near proved
[4179.12s] reserves it&#39;s trading nowhere near
[4180.6s] unproved reserves as well even at these
[4182.52s] depressed prices uh Tomas student and
[4184.92s] listener from Germany this is from
[4186.88s] Conrad Voit thanks a lot for the great
[4188.759s] insights on your podcast you recently
[4190.199s] talked about small caps out performing
[4191.48s] over the next few months how did you
[4193.0s] design a potential trade on that Russ F
[4195.64s] or options do you have any specific
[4196.8s] stocks in mind yeah I got one it&#39;s
[4198.28s] called Cooper standard uh but you could
[4200.199s] buy the ETF which is iwm or others that
[4203.199s] are small cap exposure if you wanted to
[4205.239s] play it that way um we prefer individual
[4208.52s] small cap stocks JP ding uh people often
[4212.04s] ask about when you know when to leave a
[4214.6s] trade what about when you&#39;re too early I
[4216.719s] don&#39;t mind being too early I&#39;m probably
[4217.96s] too early on 3M but I&#39;m happy to ring
[4220.8s] the register I thought I might have been
[4222.56s] too early on Intel last year at 48 I
[4225.48s] think I was because it went to 51 and
[4227.44s] then it crashed down to 29 and then we
[4229.4s] just had this uh toaca last week which
[4232.4s] it went down to 18 or whatever it went
[4234.56s] to now it&#39;s back to 20
[4237.08s] um uh and we and we rebuilt the position
[4239.76s] we sold it uh 48 so you know I I don&#39;t I
[4244.44s] know where I&#39;m getting out before I get
[4245.92s] in to 99% of the positions the only
[4248.08s] thing that would change my mind is if
[4249.4s] the fundamentals got so outstandingly
[4252.4s] better than than I
[4254.08s] anticipated uh um then uh then I would
[4258.159s] then I would consider staying in longer
[4259.64s] than I anticipated but that hasn&#39;t
[4261.159s] happened yet in 3M and that
[4266.76s] um I think long term it will but um but
[4270.96s] every now and then you got to ring the
[4272.04s] register you can&#39;t just ride everything
[4273.44s] up and back down and back up you got to
[4275.32s] you know hit the register and if it goes
[4277.52s] against you maybe rebuild the position
[4279.04s] and if it goes away from you like so
[4280.88s] what I made a multibagger on the options
[4282.56s] made a lot on the stock and on on on to
[4285.44s] the next um Cooper standard May 2022
[4289.64s] look great but also looks like the stock
[4291.52s] won&#39;t meaningfully move until car
[4294.08s] volumes and free cash flow comes back
[4295.8s] meaningfully in second half 2025 so you
[4298.76s] just prioritize other opportunities and
[4300.48s] wait on putting new capital in CPS as
[4303.12s] it&#39;s likely to Flat down like when did
[4305.4s] you have the crystal ball like how do
[4307.0s] you know when volumes are coming back 6
[4309.12s] months ago they thought volumes were
[4310.76s] going to be 161 now they&#39;re 158 how do
[4312.52s] you know 3 months from now they don&#39;t
[4313.679s] say 17 um um you know after the FED cuts
[4317.08s] and you get all these people rushing out
[4318.679s] for Christmas you just don&#39;t know is the
[4321.04s] answer to your question number one and
[4322.8s] number two they didn&#39;t elect cash pay on
[4325.92s] the debt versus pick because they&#39;re
[4327.96s] fearful that things are going to be
[4329.44s] going poorly uh these guys are dialed in
[4332.44s] and when they see what&#39;s happening with
[4333.76s] incentives and they see what&#39;s happened
[4335.199s] every other cycle they know what&#39;s going
[4336.96s] to happen to volumes and they have a
[4338.4s] better finger on the pulse than we do so
[4341.32s] I you know I don&#39;t care look I got I
[4344.719s] went through that byd trade that Charlie
[4346.88s] merer did that had like
[4349.4s] four 50 to 70% draw Downs before it went
[4352.679s] up like 12x in one year so he couldn&#39;t
[4355.52s] know when that was going to happen but
[4357.12s] it didn&#39;t matter because the kager over
[4358.92s] the 20 years was like 20s something
[4361.679s] 25% uh because he stayed in why because
[4364.0s] he didn&#39;t have leverage so if you&#39;re you
[4366.6s] know jumping around looking for the next
[4368.76s] beex headline and noise you&#39;re going to
[4370.679s] miss all these opportunities so for me
[4372.96s] no I&#39;ll just use the flat opportunity to
[4375.28s] to put more money to work when I&#39;m able
[4377.4s] to or just sit there patiently this is
[4380.08s] the business that you get paid for
[4381.719s] inactivity not activity the reason most
[4384.08s] people lose is because they have to jump
[4386.52s] around and chase the next shiny object
[4388.28s] and get their faces smacked the people
[4390.159s] who make money in this business are
[4391.719s] patient and probably golfers because
[4394.36s] they know how to just step away if
[4396.32s] they&#39;ve done the work and they know what
[4397.56s] they own
[4400.48s] um you know it was funny I was talking
[4402.719s] to a friend and I had a I had the worst
[4405.239s] round of uh since last year this weekend
[4408.32s] and you know the weekend before I had a
[4410.44s] great round uh qualifying for the Club
[4413.239s] Championship first round and
[4416.8s] uh and I was like kind of whining to a
[4420.159s] friend and he&#39;s like you know it&#39;s like
[4422.48s] you don&#39;t mind volatility in stocks why
[4425.12s] do you mind volatility in your scores so
[4426.88s] much I said because with stocks I&#39;m 100%
[4429.639s] certain of the underlying fundamentals I
[4431.48s] have no problem with that I know they&#39;re
[4433.199s] going to work out a golf I&#39;m you know
[4435.159s] probably 70% sure of my underlying
[4437.08s] fundamentals so uh so that&#39;s the that&#39;s
[4439.719s] the key difference here so the answer
[4441.4s] your question JP is you do what you want
[4443.84s] but I would never sell a share of that
[4446.0s] right now because I think it&#39;s going to
[4447.679s] take another year because when it goes
[4449.88s] it&#39;s just going to go overnight and you
[4452.48s] know you&#39;re going to wake up because you
[4453.8s] sold at 9 and it&#39;s 25 and then it&#39;s 50
[4458.239s] and then it then you buy at 50 and it
[4460.28s] pulls back to 25 before it goes to 100
[4463.04s] and you&#39;re just going to get it at all
[4464.28s] the wrong times 100% guaranteed Patrick
[4467.92s] K that&#39;s why you have a basket that&#39;s
[4470.6s] why we run a basket of 8 to 12 companies
[4472.639s] it&#39;s the same framework across the board
[4475.159s] some pop immediately in a year some Take
[4477.76s] 6 months some take two years some take
[4479.679s] three years some go against us before
[4481.639s] they turn some take longer than that but
[4484.12s] on balance we&#39;re going to get our
[4486.04s] doubles and double pluses over a couple
[4488.04s] of years and we&#39;re going to keep rinsing
[4489.48s] and repeating in Aggregate and the ones
[4491.84s] that take longer wind up making more in
[4493.719s] the long term and the ones that go
[4495.639s] faster wind up being shorter uh
[4499.84s] but if your framework is
[4502.679s] correct you will make money and you
[4504.88s] don&#39;t have to worry about this nonsense
[4506.96s] about timing and being impatient and
[4508.679s] everything else and if you&#39;re impatient
[4510.52s] go become an entrepreneur because
[4512.199s] entrepreneurs get get paid for activity
[4514.84s] you can you can take action every single
[4517.28s] minute of every single day and the more
[4519.0s] action you take the more money you&#39;re
[4520.08s] make in this business it&#39;s the exact
[4522.92s] opposite the more action you take the
[4524.76s] more the worst you&#39;re going to do until
[4526.639s] you absolutely blow up your account so
[4529.48s] um less action with a good framework is
[4532.0s] how fortunes are made over time and low
[4534.88s] leverage um Patrick K thanks for the
[4538.52s] valuable time and effort you
[4539.48s] consistently share with us you&#39;re the
[4540.6s] real MVP thank you very much uh
[4543.12s] questions related to home builders I
[4544.52s] have no position in either direction uh
[4546.8s] I&#39;ve had a nice rally at the pounding
[4548.52s] the table and everyone else was in the
[4549.76s] hole mortgage rates falling potential
[4551.8s] unwind of the locked in effect a concern
[4554.239s] for Home Building or is a supplying
[4555.88s] balance too fast Mak look rates are
[4557.719s] going to come down that game is going to
[4559.0s] be back on I haven&#39;t found anything that
[4561.239s] I want to buy yet but I&#39;m keeping an eye
[4563.239s] on it Ben
[4564.8s] Russo I&#39;m I&#39;m actually comfortable with
[4567.4s] the derivative plays I&#39;m already got my
[4569.12s] exposure through gen and Stanley Black
[4571.56s] and Decker so I&#39;m good there um Ben
[4574.32s] Russo hi Tom thanks for all the
[4575.96s] information lessons you put out in part
[4577.56s] on the regular could you please take a
[4578.719s] look at AMR focuses BuyBacks and
[4582.8s] NVR all right let&#39;s see
[4587.159s] am
[4589.52s] r ah a minor why do you keep sending me
[4592.48s] these crappy miners all right so you
[4594.0s] want me to take a look at a stock that&#39;s
[4595.84s] up
[4597.28s] 450x and now you&#39;re interested I&#39;m going
[4599.719s] to tell you before anything I&#39;m not
[4601.6s] interested I I&#39;m not I don&#39;t even have
[4603.159s] to look at the numbers so number one
[4606.32s] based on this pick uh welcome to the
[4608.84s] podcast and I hope you will stick with
[4611.28s] us for many months ahead and you&#39;re
[4612.639s] going to learn how to um do a great job
[4617.6s] uh what the problem I see here Ben is
[4621.52s] that cash flow peaked two years ago it&#39;s
[4624.76s] collapsing revenues are rolling over uh
[4628.32s] return on Capital margins are rolling
[4630.159s] over I want nothing to do this is a
[4632.0s] stock that&#39;s up
[4633.88s] 400x and is rolling over on every single
[4636.88s] metric I mean this would be probably
[4639.08s] something to short to be honest with you
[4641.08s] but um I&#39;m not I I haven&#39;t done enough
[4644.199s] work number one to do that with
[4645.6s] conviction number two if I was going to
[4647.08s] short a particular stock I would never
[4648.56s] speak about it publicly and I&#39;m not
[4650.12s] going to short this stock so but I just
[4652.36s] say if I had to do something it wouldn&#39;t
[4654.639s] be long let&#39;s just put it that way uh
[4657.0s] but I need to do a lot more work either
[4658.719s] way but thank you for tuning in and what
[4661.8s] was the second one NVR you wanted me to
[4663.52s] look at a home
[4669.239s] builder all right so this has been a
[4671.48s] steady grower for a long time it&#39;s
[4673.159s] basically at new highs I I I just wait
[4676.159s] for this stuff to pull back um let&#39;s
[4679.76s] just take a look this is going to trade
[4682.159s] with all of them xhb what is the home
[4684.96s] builders doing right now yeah basically
[4687.04s] at new highs now if you didn&#39;t buy this
[4689.36s] in the hole in 2022 or 2020 just wait
[4694.12s] there&#39;s nothing to do with it play the
[4695.4s] ancillary plays that are in the hole
[4696.92s] from the dstock restock cycle like
[4698.56s] Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and gener is
[4700.28s] our view I I know gen&#39;s up almost double
[4702.8s] already and Stanley starting to take off
[4704.4s] but I think
[4706.159s] think you know these are basically
[4708.44s] getting going for a new cycle uh opinion
[4710.6s] on oxy Buffett loves it the name&#39;s near
[4712.96s] as average the name is not near as
[4714.32s] average because he did a warrant deal
[4715.88s] and everyone thinks he&#39;s buying all this
[4717.199s] stock what he&#39;s doing is converting
