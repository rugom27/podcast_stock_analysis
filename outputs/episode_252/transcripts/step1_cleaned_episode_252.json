  "cleaned_transcript": "### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nvanney and Company last Thursday thanks to Stu vanney as well we&#39;re going to listen in here for the markets it is a rally Dow&#39;s up 476 nasdaq&#39;s up 219 course look we&#39;ve been here before Market straight up and then in the afternoon it goes straight down I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to close but right now it&#39;s up Tom Hayes joins us to look at the market this morning is the Fed in your opinion is the Fed doing the right thing leaving rates exactly where they are until September they&#39;re not doing the right thing St but they&#39;re going to get away with it and that&#39;s because as we saw this morning as it relates to to the economy the rumors of My Demise are greatly exaggerated so we saw initial jobless claims come in lower than expected they&#39;re going to get away with it the problem is why you&#39;re seeing all this volatility is Bank of Japan bailed out the West while we were fighting inflation they were the global liquidity provider buying bonds globally buying equities globally and when they needed to hike to fight inflation we didn&#39;t come to their rescue when they hiked last week the FED should have been cutting and we wouldn&#39;t see this volatility so boj had to back off until September when the fed&#39;s going to cut and now we&#39;ve got a high chance 80 some odd percent chance of a 50 basis percent cut in September and the Market&#39;s doing well the Market&#39;s doing great there you go I know you like two stocks in particular and I&#39;m interested in this Disney Disney&#39;s all the way down to $84 a share I mean that&#39;s a dip and a half Disney you can&#39;t give away right now and I&#39;ll tell you I look at Disney Disney&#39;s sum of the parts okay so you have the parks and the experiences people are worried that the parks are slowing down for the next couple of quarters they&#39;re going to do 10 billion of ebit which implies $80 a share in value for the parks and experiences that means Disney plus is worth zero ESPN is worth zero theatrical Productions is worth zero you saw Deadpool it&#39;s going to be a billion dollar franchise inside out too billion dollar franchise it&#39;s attributed zero they&#39;ve got3 million subscribers Netflix has 277 million they get a quarter of a trillion valuation this business gets zero so we think between the parks and the streaming over time the streaming can do 10 to 15 billion of ebit which implies $150 to $190 a share over the next 3 to 5 years and you can&#39;t give it away today if you bought it for 84 you&#39;d be satisfied with just a 100 bucks in a six or seven months Take the Long View here one last one and we&#39;ve often covered this gener the generator people fantastic business uh they got in trouble from 2001 because they Overstock during covid they spent eight quarters working through that Overstock dstock cycle now they&#39;re in the restock cycle uh residential was up 8% commercial was up 10% they beat and raised for this quarter so we we like this business the grid is unstable and we&#39;re entering hurricane season as rates go down so people are going to be able to finance them more easily met a good case where&#39;s it go 137 Now where&#39;s it going uh this thing is probably over time going to work towards 200 give it it 12 24 36 months 12 2 4 that&#39;s okay you know accordion of time frame I&#39;ll tell you they&#39;ve got 6.25% gener uh penetration for their total addressable Market uh this has tremendous opportunity moving forward so I want to be conservative here but uh our expectations are much higher than that got it\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI want to thank Jeff Cohen and Trinity Chavez for having me on NYS ETV from the New York Stock Exchange last uh just uh yesterday when the PPI inflation numbers came out we&#39;ll tune in here open right now and joining me to talk more about this eventful day is Thomas Hayes he is a chairman and managing partner and member well actually managing member at Great Hill capital good morning good morning Trinity thanks for having me today absolutely so let&#39;s lead things off with some news that just came in about an hour ago the release of July by wholesale price data what are you taking away from the fresh data well this was phenomenal for the markets and the markets like it uh basically it came in at 2.2% uh versus 2.3% expectations year on-ear and month- on Monon uh uh 10 basis points versus 20 basis points expectations the interesting thing about this report Trinity is that 70% of the inflation was energy based Energy Products and the other thing that we saw which is a change from recent history is that goods were hotter than Services you know the last few months Services have been very very sticky and goods have been in in Decline so it&#39;s nice to see Services come down and the market certainly likes it now the key Trinity is the impact that it has on expectations for rate cuts which is what has the markets uh waiting with baited breath so more inflation data arrives tomorrow when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases Consumer Price data for July so what are you pricing out here yeah I think it&#39;s expected to bump up a little bit from uh it was negative one10 to 1% last month uh for the month on Monon this month it&#39;s expected to be plus 210 of 1% and 3% year onye the key though will be is this trend correct and the trend that I&#39;m talking about is expectations for probabilities of fed Cuts in September right now as of this morning just a few minutes ago we have a 55% chance of a 50 basis point cut in September and a 45% chance of a 25 basis point cut 0% chance of no cuts which is a big change from just a couple of months ago and then as of December because of these inflation numbers that came in this morning we have a 100% chance of 75 75 basis points by December and we have 78% chance of 100 basis points by December and the market likes it the Market&#39;s up they just want to see confirmation tomorrow so if you see a little uncertainty midday just know the Market&#39;s waiting for CPI tomorrow Trinity okay and the CME fed watch tool is forecasting 100% chance of rate cut next month but it&#39;s also showing yes so it&#39;s also showing though a dead heat when it comes to Traders expecting a 25 basis point cut or a 50 50 base point cut so what do you believe that we&#39;ll see next month as this all goes down yeah it&#39;s a coin flip the key more than whether it&#39;s 25 or 50 is that they get started because they can always speed up or slow down the market has been waiting with baited breath for the FED to\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n is a change from recent history is that goods were hotter than Services you know the last few months Services have been very very sticky and goods have been in in Decline so it&#39;s nice to see Services come down and the market certainly likes it now the key Trinity is the impact that it has on expectations for rate cuts which is what has the markets uh waiting with baited breath so more inflation data arrives tomorrow when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases Consumer Price data for July so what are you pricing out here yeah I think it&#39;s expected to bump up a little bit from uh it was negative one10 to 1% last month uh for the month on Monon this month it&#39;s expected to be plus 210 of 1% and 3% year onye the key though will be is this trend correct and the trend that I&#39;m talking about is expectations for probabilities of fed Cuts in September right now as of this morning just a few minutes ago we have a 55% chance of a 50 basis point cut in September and a 45% chance of a 25 basis point cut 0% chance of no cuts which is a big change from just a couple of months ago and then as of December because of these inflation numbers that came in this morning we have a 100% chance of 75 75 basis points by December and we have a 78% chance of 100 basis points by December and the market likes it the Market&#39;s up they just want to see confirmation tomorrow so if you see a little uncertainty midday just know the Market&#39;s waiting for CPI tomorrow Trinity okay and the CME fed watch tool is forecasting 100% chance of rate cut next month but it&#39;s also showing yes so it&#39;s also showing though a dead heat when it comes to Traders expecting a 25 basis point cut or a 50 50 base point cut so what do you believe that we&#39;ll see next month as this all goes down yeah it&#39;s a coin flip the key more than whether it&#39;s 25 or 50 is that they get started because they can always speed up or slow down the market has been waiting with baited breath for the FED to\nfinally  move uh we&#39;re very very restrictive over 200 basis points above inflation so they have to get started and they have to adjust as they go along and see the data so uh I think that&#39;s less important for equities than knowing that they&#39;re in the game and they&#39;re not going to be too uh rigid in being data dependent they have to move before we hit 2% cuz if they move by the time we hit 2% we&#39;re already in deflation and that&#39;s a much harder problem to solve and from your Vantage Point do you think that the FED waited too long to begin cutting rids yes but they&#39;ll get away with it well I mean that was a short and sweet answer and we&#39;ve oh go ahead yeah they certainly waited too long but they will get away with it so long as they move in September they have the Jackson Hole meeting as an opportunity to convey some doish and to signal for September which should hold things together until they\n\nthey have to move before we hit 2% cuz if they move by the time we hit 2% we&#39;re already in deflation and that&#39;s a much harder problem to solve and from your Vantage Point do you think that the FED waited too long to begin cutting rids yes but they&#39;ll get away with it well I mean that was a short and sweet answer and we&#39;ve oh go ahead yeah they certainly waited too long but they will get away with it so long as they move in September they have the Jackson Hole meeting as an opportunity to convey some doish and to signal for September which should hold things together until they\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally start the cutting process just in the ni just in the nick of time is really what it&#39;s going to come down to and you know we&#39;ve also seen a lot of heightened amount of Market volatility over the past week so what are you advising investors to do in the near-term adid a flurry of economic\n\nheadlines  yeah so there&#39;s it&#39;s definitely created some bargain opportunities I think we&#39;re going to hold up here into the first cut we may see some volatility in the fall after that first cut and before the election but on balance look earnings are strong 10.8% year on-year with 78% of the companies reporting that that compares to U analysts expected 8.9% earnings growth to have 10.8% is really really good for Q2 if you look at the GDP now we&#39;re still growing at 2 .9% GDP growth is a big deal and then estimates for next year have not only held up but they&#39;ve gone up in the last few weeks up 1% uh since July 1st still $279 for the S&amp;P next year which is 15.2% earnings growth so Trinity when people say the multiples are too high just say compared to what because the earnings growth is going to be 15.2% so provided the FED does the right thing and starts the cutting process just in the nick of time I think we&#39;re going to hold up I think we&#39;re going to do fine and the one thing everyone&#39;s worried about the consumer don&#39;t bet against the consumers so long as they have a job and so long as the FED starts this cutting process I think we&#39;re going to be able to hold the labor market together and earlier we dove into wholesale prices and consumer prices but there are also a lot of events that are unfolding too like retail sales data on Thursday and housing starts data on Friday for example so what do you feel can Drive the markets later in the week yeah I look I think the short-term numbers everyone knows the consumer is a little bit weak a little bit nervous and part of that has to do with affordability of housing which is going to improve as the FED starts to cut rates uh housing starts you&#39;re going to see uh you know they&#39;re not going to be great until the FED starts to cut rates but once that happens and the consumer has a light at the end of the tunnel knowing the FED is on their side versus you know continuing to gut punch them I I think that things will move forward in the way that everyone expects and uh and we&#39;ll be able to see uh earnings re accelerate margins are are accelerating so things are holding on but the FED needs to act fast and as far as the data this week it&#39;s short-term noise in the scheme of a long-term strong economy\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\na lot of important points right there thank you so much Thomas for joining us thank you Trinity and we&#39;re back and then I want to thank Reuters for including me in their article about the jobs report last week uh also an update we&#39;ve had a huge run in 3M huge run in the stock multibagger in the options and option spreads we took profits uh we do think this this business is going to go higher over time but it was a lot of money in a short period of time and every now and then you got to ring the register we would love to re-enter this at lower levels we do not know whether that opportunity will present itself or not not but um we are for the time being holding on to the svent spin-off uh and may take a look at adding to that as well but uh this was a win and as you can see you know this took a whole year plus to build this base and then when it took off it took off and doubled off the bottoms and um between the stock and options was was very worthwhile so we&#39;re happy with that uh and you know like Intel like we did last year went from 25 to 48 we took off 2/3 we readded we bought more down after uh earnings last week a lot more down brought our basis down I think now our basis is down to 23 bucks uh so uh maybe we&#39;ll get an opportunity to do that in 3M but if not it was a good ride thank you very much ring the register\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\n uh moving on we have some data here for for the uh economic data services PMI turning up so that&#39;s good to see uh New York fed Equifax and serious delinquency 90 plus days that&#39;s moving up to uh elevated levels at the low end on credit cards and auto loans so we got to keep an eye on that and I hope the FED is keeping an eye on that and will be dovish until they\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nReuters for including me in their article about the jobs report last week uh also an update we&#39;ve had a huge run in 3M huge run in the stock multibagger

the FED is keeping an eye on that and will be dovish until they finally  do their first cut in September doesn&#39;t really matter whether it&#39;s 25 or 50 yesterday it was 50/50 chance today it&#39;s 35% chance of a 25 basis point cut and and uh 65% chance of 50 basis point cut the key is they get get started and they can adjust up or down uh Bank of Japan ucha says no rate hike when financial markets are unstable so basically what happened was the uh Bank of Japan had to raise rates you had to carry trade on wine because the FED did not cut rates to offset the liquidity mismatch when the FED Cuts in September Bank of Japan will then have the green light to raise again drain more liquidity Yen stronger carry trade unwind which supports our thesis for China um Japanese 2-year uh government bond yield US government spending falling year onye so this is also restrictive by the way small caps got up to failed to break out they&#39;re retesting they&#39;re going to break out because earning power is going up and uh that trend is going to be fits and starts until it\n\nBank of Japan ucha says no rate hike when financial markets are unstable so basically what happened was

up and uh that trend is going to be fits and starts until it\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nfinally\n\ntakes off and then everyone will play catchup same with equal weights uh absolute same story default rates are declining this is for leverage loans actually they peaked earlier this year and now they&#39;re starting to go down with with raid expectations that&#39;s pretty good to see uh chapter 11 filings though ticking up so this is kind of a mix bag uh this is very interesting from Charles Payne via Ned Davis research he shows since 1945 there have been 89 5% correction 5% pullbacks 10 29 10% pullbacks 10 20% pullbacks and three 40% pullbacks well ladies and gentlemen we just had 2 20% pullbacks in the last four years which means probably coast is clear for some time um statistically speaking uh we had one in 2020 and one in 20 22 and average time to recover for these 5% pullbacks is 1.5 months so uh you know the market is working back up to that fits and starts I would imagine we&#39;re going to recover it by September but if that&#39;s ahead of the first cut I&#39;d be inclined to fade that strength and get defensive into the election uh you know right around the first cut mid-september uh and uh and then build up cash to to get aggressively long into the year end Rally post elction sentiment indicators has dropped to cycle lows I&#39;m seeing a lot of the sentiment indicators point to levels where you want to be a buyer not a seller a lot of stuff got knocked down uh from that carry trade the beginning of the carry trade unwind I think there&#39;s an opportunity to step in uh selectively for the next few weeks if you&#39;re tactical or just long-term and hold through the fall volatility of course which is more along the lines of what we do I think if we do get the strength that we expect for the next three or 4 weeks we&#39;ll probably put on some tactical shorts uh just to take advantage of the opportunity and in in September October um but we&#39;ll take it as it comes uh while while keeping our core Holdings and not getting determined but the things that have reached close to our targets or we&#39;ve made a ton of money on in a reasonable amount of time like the 3M Etc we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to hit the register on some of that stuff uh Global risk demand has recently Fallen Shar sharply into extreme fear territory so again these are periods of opportunity uh motor vehicle loans okay owned incur is okay relative multiple suggests that small caps could outperform large caps over the next 10 years you think yes it&#39;s time back to the 2001 to 2007 period and everyone lining up um Prime of strip So This Is Us prime rate in real terms minus small business funding rates is the highest in 20 years uh and the implication is that they need to cut a lot more than the FED thinks we&#39;ll see uh there are a lot of exceptions right now because of what happened with Co a once in 100 Year event but uh certainly keeping an eye on all of this stuff and not being a Cassandra and not being a primadonna either but just dealing with the data on a day-to-day week- toe basis you can see the 10-day gauge hit Japanese volatility was the highest since the great financial crisis and since they blew up in the late 80s uh Japanese money supply rolling over China&#39;s CPI is going up that&#39;s a sign of recovery so pay close attention to that you saw the same thing off the 2016 lows and a straight up rally uh to 201819 and then the same thing um the 2020 bottoms straight up into beginning of 2022 bottomed early 2024 and now is working higher that&#39;s a big thing that you want to see inflation going up you want to see the Yuan start to strengthen and you want to start to see bond yields going up all of those are coincident with Equity starting to rip in China and all of those are lining up with uh Stronger Yen outflows from Japan which was hot money from China Etc PPI confirmed the CPI in China worst outflow from bank loans since March of 2020 that was uh uh during the carry trade on wine this talks about Chinese uh out producing in terms of getting nuclear energy capacity that&#39;s a big deal um BuyBacks by corporate clients are nearing 2019 highs so that&#39;s a back stop supported for the markets which which should be part of the reason for the August early September strength is the blackout periods are over earnings are out and now companies can buy back stocks with their cash hordes balance sheets are good and so on moving right along midcap etf&#39;s recent buy buying spree after selling Spate so the money the money is starting to come back into mids it will follow into Falls um this is just a reiteration of Charles&#39;s data 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average 10% pullbacks occur one times a year on average 15% Corrections occur every other year on average 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years and as I said we&#39;ve had two in four years so we&#39;re kind of fronted loaded and we should have some smoother sailing for a little while prospectively Wake Me Up When September end so we should see this strength in sept ear August to early September I think it&#39;s going to be and actually going to be the sell the first hike uh also that will be supported by um uh election uncertainties so I think you know as you get into I think it&#39;s September 17th if you have strength and a lot of profits it&#39;s time to book some maybe put on some tactical shorts and then uh mid mid October late October because of the election you can probably start to buy stuff in the hole and ride the um the money machine into year end year end rally industrial inventory cycle Illinois&#39;s toolworks this is earnings quotes from their calls destocking which was a headwind all of last year is no longer a significant Factor at this point we&#39;re going to hear from uh um gxo on that as well uh Johnson Controls overall I think that for the most part the large destocking is behind us guys this is the whole theme of our portfolio destock to restock whether it&#39;s standle whether even whether it&#39;s Intel whether it&#39;s um gener whether it&#39;s it whether even it was uh 3M by the way and 3M probably has a lot more juice in it ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s just you know when you get that kind move in that short period of time especially on the options which some of the spreads we did were up 3 4X um you got to you got to hit the window and uh and we may revisit that one in the meantime we&#39;ll hang on to svent for the time being uh arm Holdings that&#39;s a different business that&#39;s cognizant Microsoft that&#39;s Tech that is Tech Tech okay so that&#39;s All Tech earnings mandelis says they make Oreo cookies consumer incomes are rising which helps to reduce the inflation driven Financial strain on many households as a result private label growth in our categories is decelerating while branded share growth is improving that is fascinating that is that goes against the the common narrative um there here&#39;s Marriott we are seeing a stronger performance in the upper chain scales than compared to our lower chain scales that&#39;s more in line with the narrative uh MGM which is casinos majority of our customers the middle end to high end are still pretty strong still visiting quite a bit the lower end of the database has seen a bit of softening Proctor and Gamble makes tide so from a consumer standpoint we generally don&#39;t see the dynamic of consumer pressure that some are describing if you look at a couple Dynamics private label shares as an example which typically would be increasing during the time of significant consumer pressure that&#39;s not what we&#39;re seeing fascinating okay uh Matt Ser minaro from fundstrat says a peak and put call has led to immediate term intermediate term lows and equities that&#39;s what we saw early this month so now where&#39;re fits and starts working back up just like we saw uh in past instances high yield credit spread yields blew out they&#39;re now coming back in so that&#39;s positive Market are again pricing more fed Cuts in the next 12 months uh we find we find no evidence that hurricane Barrel in Texas contributed to the rise in temporary layoffs but summer Auto Plant retooling shutdowns might have contributed so what they&#39;re trying to say is that the labor market is not cracking yet and Claudia s of the s r has been saying similar stuff she&#39;s saying pay attention this might time might be different but you got to act soon is effective what she&#39;s saying so maybe it&#39;s the auto retooling and maybe it&#39;s also the immigration which we&#39;re going to see some data on here uh other indicators suggest layoffs remain low Bank of America credit and debit card spending per household decreased by 410 of 1% year onye in July so there&#39;s some weakness there okay we did the inflation it&#39;s been the second longest manufacturing recession in history so I could see a situation where you have some softening for a little bit while Manu you know manufacturing has been in a recession and we did have that technical recession two quarters of negative GDP growth in uh first and second quarter of 2022 they just didn&#39;t label it as a recession it&#39;s like a double dis dip recession just like we had during the vulka era and then we had 18 years of prosperity um I could see a situation where manufacturing starts to re accelerate and that kind of offsets a a customer that&#39;s taking a breather a consumer that&#39;s taking a breather although we&#39;re going to see from gxo earnings that uh the Christmas holiday season based on stocks seem to be looking certainly better than last year and more normalized so I wouldn&#39;t count out you know what I always say is don&#39;t count out the US consumer if they have a job and the question is whether they have jobs and and that&#39;s going to be a question of whether you believe the most recent jobs report was what to expect Pro moving forward which means we are weakening dramatically or if it was a oneof from Auto retooling and from uh the immigration Spike number of immigrant visas has continued to rise you can see it there household debt outstanding as a share of GDP is down over the past decade so the consumer has deleveraged tremendously since 2009 household balance sheet still in good shape Financial Obligations relative to incomes are staying low by historical standards hasn&#39;t been this low since the 60s maybe uh this chart only goes back to 1983 so that&#39;s positive uh personal bankruptcy filing rates are hovering over multi-decade lows so you know you see a lot of people showing these two-year charts and it&#39;s like oh they&#39;re going through the the roof but if you go back you know 50 years they&#39;re way below normal average share loans and foreclosure remains very low at 46% housing affordability index remains at record lows this is uh the worst it&#39;s been since the vulker vulker era uh economic surprise index City Group economic surprise index turning up this is a key one the election year seasonality is kind of going according to plan here so far uh we did have that correction in Late July early August and then it should bode well for strength into mid-september and that&#39;s right around the first fed cut which historically has been sell the first cut weakness into the end of October just before the election and then year end rally I I think that&#39;s going to be the model now you know can it be that easy the answer is no but it&#39;s a good framework and then you adapt based on how things play out in in real time but uh that&#39;s our base case at the moment uh you could see how extreme things got here at macro charts off his core risk model and bouncing off those lows do we go retest those I don&#39;t know if we do or we don&#39;t but um uh that was that money market assets these as rates come down once you get the first cut a good slug of these have to come back into the market just like they did in 2020 you know half a half a trillion dollars came into the market pretty quickly once they back stop the corporate credit Market uh I think the same will be true once you get your first one or two cuts we get probably a half a trillion in for year end into equities as people lose out on short rates coming down this is going to be the most important chart we covered today with uh Us sell through on uh Auto Autos uh pretty excited about that I went to see Cooper standard at JP Morgan last Thursday and um saw the presentation talked with uh with the people and um I&#39;ll share some some um thoughts on that as as we get to the article of the week Japanese Yen we&#39;ve covered enough of that hedge funds boost bearish commodity bet uh you&#39;re seeing Comstock res resources start to rip the last few days from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm when hedge funds get this bearish on Commodities I I think they&#39;re probably opportunities in energy I think there a few\n\nCity Group economic surprise index turning up this is

days from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm when hedge funds get this bearish on Commodities I I think they&#39;re probably opportunities in energy I think there a few\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nquestions  there but uh for my money I I still like com stock is is the play uh commodity Cycles boom bus Cycles deviations from the trend so you can see here it&#39;s coming out of the lower Trend I did I want to uh it&#39;s coming out of a low and checking back just like it did th this this is a good framework model for what we&#39;re seeing you had this low and then a rally and then check back and then a multi-year rally and I think that&#39;s a reasonable framework and again that what does that point to is 2001 to 2007 I think it&#39;s a similar situation over and over we keep see seeing very strong similarity of all of these things uh no one&#39;s buying calls everyone bought puts in the holes therefore they had to get smoked and they did um thank you for playing try again uh election year seasonal pattern 1968 versus 2024 and the reason Jeff Hirsch is pointing this one is because LBJ left office and then you had a mid July correction uh ahead of the Democratic Convention and then you had the year end rally so this would imply that you don&#39;t get any major weakness in October meaning it&#39;s just straight up into the end of the year if if passes any prologue uh which is why you know only on things that we&#39;ve seen huge multi-baggers would we raise cash um certainly on the option side and then the underlying stock has to be up 50 75 100% And then um we&#39;ll see what things look like in mid-september is what I&#39;m trying to tell you there&#39;s a lot of different analogues we can follow the key is we&#39;re intermediate term bullish economy is good earnings are good 10.8% earnings growth versus 8.9% estimated uh 15.2% estimated for next year uh GDP now at 2.9% you know things are humming along biggest number one tail risk people are saying is a US recession that&#39;s If the Fed screws up which they&#39;re fully capable of doing but I think there&#39;s enough pressure and precedent and transparency now that I think they&#39;ve got to go in September and I think they&#39;ve got to talk doish in um I think I I think their best play is if they&#39;re being cautious talk like a crazy dove in Jackson Hole and then only give 25 basis points in September and then if you&#39;re wrong you can always go up to you can always uh move in November or you can go to like a 75 basis point in December and signal that in in in between and then the market will price it in ahead of time European relative to 12-month us forward PE this is pretty interesting so the European PE doing a lot of talking is um 35 to 40% lower than the USP and we&#39;re going to see and gxo earnings that demand in Europe and UK which is where most of their business is is exceeding the US they&#39;re seeing a little softness in the US but they&#39;re seeing a lot of strength in Europe and you can buy it at 30 to 40% lower which is why we have that UK play in serious position in gxo and a tiny position in Asos uh which we have yet to find a reason to make into a real position but we&#39;re keeping an eye on it um and looking for some more opportunities in Europe as well uh imig oh this is this is the chart I wanted to show you immigration adjusted unemployment rate is lower so remember this shot up to 4.3 but if you back out the aberrational immigration it&#39;s still down at 3.6 and this is the Delta between is are we going into a hard Landing with the Som rule or is this time different because of this immigration uh artificial immigration Spike um which leaves us at 3.6% and that&#39;s what you have to keep in mind uh be databased and be flexible inflation expectations basically down to 10year lows for three-year inflation expectations at what is it 2.3 uh Chinese government bond yields started going up that&#39;s very positive China goes to New extremes and Crackdown on bond market frenzy we want to see this go up up up along with equities um we&#39;ll cover that in the fund manager survey but basically you&#39;re seeing sentiment levels at the levels you see closer to Bottoms not closer to Tops which is positive um the gap between Mega cap Tech and others is shrinking profit growth for magnificent 7 starts slowing rest of S&P hits its stride we&#39;ve been talking about this for months now you can see it happening net income growth uh went from 50% now it&#39;s down to 25% and going lower uh S&amp;P magnificent 7 net income growth now starting to move to high single digits from being negative up until last quarter um feds featuring on earnings call like never before so that&#39;s becoming a major major issue just like it was uh back here it spiked in 2000 late 2008 when they\n\ne and UK which is where most of their business is is exceeding the US they&#39;re seeing a little softness in the US but they&#39;re seeing a lot of strength in Europe and you can buy it at 30 to 40% lower which is why we have that UK play in serious position in gxo and a tiny position in Asos uh which we have yet to find a reason to make into a real position but we&#39;re keeping an eye on it um and looking for some more opportunities in Europe as well uh imig oh this is this is the chart I wanted to show you immigration adjusted unemployment rate is lower so remember this shot up to 4.3 but if you back out the aberrational immigration it&#39;s still down at 3.6 and this is the Delta between is are we going into a hard Landing with the Som rule or is this time different because of this immigration uh artificial immigration Spike um which leaves us at 3.6% and that&#39;s what you have to keep in mind uh be databased and be flexible inflation expectations basically down to 10year lows for three-year inflation expectations at what is it 2.3 uh Chinese government bond yields started going up that&#39;s very positive China goes to New extremes and Crackdown on bond market frenzy we want to see this go up up up along with equities um we&#39;ll cover that in the fund manager survey but basically you&#39;re seeing sentiment levels at the levels you see closer to Bottoms not closer to Tops which is positive um the gap between Mega cap Tech and others is shrinking profit growth for magnificent 7 starts slowing rest of S&amp;P hits its stride we&#39;ve been talking about this for months now you can see it happening net income growth uh went from 50% now it&#39;s down to 25% and going lower uh S&amp;P magnificent 7 net income growth now starting to move to high single digits from being negative up until last quarter um feds featuring on earnings call like never before so that&#39;s becoming a major major issue just like it was uh back here it spiked in 2000 late 2008 when they finally  started cutting investor sector allocation so they&#39;ve gone into defensives Pharma and they&#39;re out of discretionary there&#39;ll be some opportunities to pick up there you saw it in Starbucks by the way we&#39;ve talked on it the reason we didn&#39;t get involved in Starbucks uh or Nike yet and we continue to keep our eye we&#39;ll probably miss it with Nike you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going to wake up and there&#39;ll be an activist in Nike and we&#39;ll miss it uh is and Lulu for that matter maybe we&#39;ll get one of them it&#39;s just a question of what do we want to sell well you know we did take off at 3M today so maybe there&#39;ll be a new spot in the portfolio um was just because they had meaningful China exposure and we have a meaningful China exposure through Baba so we didn&#39;t want to have a high correlated trade um but we&#39;re going to be open-minded because there&#39;s there&#39;s certainly opportunity there the other thing I thought was silly was Nelson Pelt uh I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened to him since Ed Gardner left but he&#39;s become like a day trader like Disney spiked up and the guy sold it partially because they didn&#39;t let him on the board then he gets in Starbucks it spikes up 20% and he sells it are you telling me you put billion dollars in a billions of dollars in a position to make a 20% gain are you like a day trader like why would you ever take that big of a position for a 20% move like it makes zero sense to me so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on over there but after Starbucks biked he got out which tells me his level of confidence in the position which also tells me maybe there&#39;ll be another chance to get in but I think that&#39;s going to be a harder ship to correct they couldn&#39;t have picked a better guy to do it than the guy from Chipotle but I think it&#39;ll take some time and after the honeymoon is over um maybe there&#39;ll be new opportunity but I I I really don&#39;t want to compete with luckan in China so for me uh certainly with the last CEO it was an absolute no uh with the new CEO it&#39;s a maybe but uh I&#39;m not paying up for it so we&#39;ll keep an eye on that one lower uh bond yield expectations back to 2023 highs so this the last time they had the lower bond yield expectations at this level was November 2008 which started a huge cutting cycle expectations for lower short rates highest on record going back to March 2020 which was the bottom of the market as well PPI we we saw vix has rolled over uh recent immigrants labor force share has risen sharply and their unemployment rate has also trended upward which is skewed the overall which is what we were talking about on the ear earlier part we estimate that net IM immigration into the US reached 2.9 Million people in 2023 1.9 million above the pre pandemic Trend will slow to 2.2 million in 2024 uh this is the percent of companies with positive 12mth percent changes in forward earnings this is not the stuff you see at the end of a cycle ladies and gentlemen this looks exactly like the previous Cycles you get the huge Spike off the lows after the recession you should have a recession line here in 2022 cuz we two quarters of negative GDP growth and then it rolls over and then you start the recovery rolls over start the recovery rolls over starts to recovery uh or in the case of 2009 rolls you know Spike off the low then a check back and then you continue higher Spike off the low check back continue higher but that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing right now this is not what we see at tops is all I&#39;m trying to communicate with you ###

the stock price is doing intraday which is kind of comical it&#39;s like they completely blow with the wind but I guess that&#39;s what you have to do in that business to stay alive and um we&#39;ll talk a little bit about Disney but this analyst took the price Target down to 225 so everyone&#39;s worried about the park slowing down for a couple of quarters they released a whole bunch of new stuff over the weekend which we&#39;ll talk about um but the big story if you remember most of the reason we got in parks are great highest return on invested capital but value Act is the activist in this stock and value act turned around Salesforce it turned around um New York Times if they could turn around New York Times they could turn around anything they made New York Times profitable they turned around [Music] um Spotify so those were the three Salesforce New York Times Spotify and they did it all through pricing bundles and increasing the prices and as you saw which the market didn&#39;t respond to they raised the prices right before earnings and they&#39;re going to add the ES SPN to all the bundles all that business is being valued at zero right now it&#39;s got 153 million subscribers on the Disney Plus Part alone leaving aside ESPN which is the number one franchise in sports gaining share not losing share and they&#39;re going to monetize that through streaming uh and so if it&#39;s half what what Netflix is Netflix is valued at you know 300 billion um for you know 277 million subscribers they&#39;ve probably got 200 across platforms they&#39;re valued at zero I&#39;m I&#39;m going to take a wild and crazy bet that it&#39;s worth more than zero Disney plus Wolverine uh inside out to both billion dollar franchises theatrical releases Disney Hulu all that stuff and um let&#39;s just assume it&#39;s not worth half of uh Netflix let&#39;s assume it&#39;s worth a quarter of at the end of the day it still takes the stock between 150 to 200 over the next few years and that&#39;s what we need the options will be a lot you know the stock will be a double the options will be multi-baggers and we&#39;ll be r in the register like 3M in no time no time was a year and a half so there you go retail investors haven&#39;t been this pessimistic in 9 months that&#39;s that&#39;s the periods that we like to be looking for opportunity PayPal stock Rises uh its fast track to better margins with new guest checkout system we&#39;ve been talking about this for months uh 80% conversion at checkout versus 50% the competition which means you can charge more because you&#39;d rather pay you know 200 basis points on on an 80 or 90% conversion then 100 basis points on a 50% conversion just do the math if it&#39;s a $100 ticket and uh and that&#39;s going to increase margins increase uh payment volume increase earnings increase cash flow and as we covered before they said oh by the way we&#39;re not going to do five billion in free cash flow this year we&#39;re going to do six billion oh and by the way we&#39;re uh we&#39;re not going to do $5 billion in BuyBacks we&#39;re going to do $6 billion in BuyBacks oh and by the way do you remember just a quarter ago when he had that negative that uh really conservative guidance and I called him sandbagger in Chief well this was evidence of it this quarter uh as you see he&#39;s already blowing estimates out of the water he didn&#39;t even wait a quarter to keep us in suspense he just you know uh the uh the foreplay is over I mean we&#39;re we&#39;re getting\n\nDisney plus Wolverine uh

Alex the new CEO he ran the small business division at into it the stock was a 28 bagger plus while he was there and he was responsible for 50% of the revenues this guy&#39;s going to do it he&#39;s already doing it in just you know he&#39;s basically just found the coffee machine he&#39;s only been there for three quarters and it&#39;s Off to the Races yum China gobbles up gains uh State Council prepares service consumption policy China&#39;s CPI went up it&#39;s starting to improve that&#39;s a sign of recovery not decline fres shipo which is kind of could be the Costco of China which we own through Alibaba uh achieves four months of profitability after major restructuring so all these things are turning around Intel stock may have bottomed at tangible Book value that&#39;s from uh we posted over the weekend from Barons why am I not signed in here and tangible Book value just for you guys that are new to this uh is basically what you get when they liquidate the whole company uh so you&#39;re basically trading at liquidation value uh I like opportunities like that where your downside is is uh uh covered and your upside is unlimited and uh we like this story so we covered it last week we did about an hour and a half on it go back to that podcast and listen if you&#39;re interested why why buffets dumped 55.8% of its Apple stock well I one reason could be that uh it&#39;s historically traded at a 14 times multiple now it was at a 28 to 30 times multiple oh and by the way the earnings growth expectations have haved so you&#39;re paying you know twice as much for half the growth other than that how is the play Mrs Lincoln from villains to Indiana Jones everything we learned at Disney&#39;s Parks panel 2024 d23 Expo that&#39;s a mouthful uh so they&#39;re going to do a villain land coming to the Magic Kingdom uh for all the evildoers out there that like to uh go to villain parks with their kids uh have at it uh they&#39;re doing uh more cruise ships they&#39;re you know they&#39;re they&#39;re basically laying out all the things that they&#39;re going to invest in and how it&#39;s going to be great and they&#39;re not asleep at the wheel and we know all that stuff China goes to otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be owners China goes to New extreme and crack down on B market friendsy go after it it&#39;s time you get off your butt and you know turn this ship around Baxter to sell its Kidney Care business so they got four bli $3.8 billion going to use 3 billion to cut down the um uh to sell off their debt they were originally going to spend that to us that&#39;s a low growth business so uh the fact that they&#39;re getting rid of it number one I don&#39;t know if we would have hung off hung on to that spin-off to be honest with you the the kidney dialysis business uh we usually really like spin-offs like svent so I&#39;m glad they sold it they&#39;ll take the debt down by 3 billion which is going to take down their interest cost oh and by the way because they don&#39;t have the slow growth of the kidney business they multiples is going to get rated from 10 to a normalized 15 uh over the next few months and their free cash flow is going to go up because they have less uh interest payments for Debt Service and they&#39;ve got a lean mean money-making machine so we like this we&#39;re very excited no change in Outlook uh and there you go uh stock down 54% is it time to buy the dip on this growth stock which is gxo logistics uh amen baby you preaching to the choir we&#39;re going to talk about that one in the article of the week alibaba&#39;s lazzada post first monthly profit amid intense competition in Southeast Asia so they turn that profit around from losing money to making money how China just like they did with fipo uh how China stocks could break out of the value trap so this guy put out this chart which shows the csi300 versus estimated EPs and what he&#39;s basically saying is every time it got this extreme you got a huge rally in equities we know the story it&#39;s time China expects air travel to hit a record in 2024 amen hallelujah China delivers another harsh verbal warning to bond buyers um there you go so uh look if you want to get people out of your bonds and into your stocks uh you know start buying more stocks and when the price goes up the opinion will follow Trend and then you get some natural buyers the the stock market could double and it would still be cheap so um you want to solve your problem for any of the Chinese policy makers that are listening to this um do what Japan did start buying equities get a bid in it opinion will follow Trend and then you&#39;ll get a normalized multiple and then the game will be on like you saw in Japan the difference is you&#39;ve got five years of supportive demographics before you fall off a cliff uh Japan does not so uh that&#39;s why Japan hot money is going to come out and it&#39;s going to come into China once the Chinese uh policy makers get with it and realize there&#39;s an opportunity sitting right in front of them Home Depot stock bounces as Home Improvement demand may have just bottomed so that&#39;s good to see everyone

market and sentiment results\n\nwanted to do this update on Cooper standard since going to the presentation at uh JP Morgan last week on Madison Avenue and what was exciting about this is there wasn&#39;t anything new other than the fact um that they talked about what they&#39;re seeing in terms of incentives in the market picking up and that they&#39;ve been following this for decades cuz all these guys are lifelong Auto industry people and you know I have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in in my work and they have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in their work and one of their indicators is when incentives from dealers and manufacturers start ticking up volumes quickly follow and I&#39;m going to explain how that&#39;s counterintuitive in just a minute but let&#39;s go to this chart to start with\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard did $722 a share in earnings in earnings the stock traded at $146 so you basically had a 20 times multiple on that earnings power let me move ahead here last week we went into detail on Cooper standard earnings outlooks and Prospects moving forward as well as our original thesis from May 20222 when we initiated the position around $5.50 a share you can find it here so click there and read the whole thing and then click on the link in that article that goes to our old articles from May of 2022 one concept I wanted to point out is that since 1980 every single cycle has peaked out at 18 million SAR expectations for 2024 were that the industry would do 16.1 million this year it has since been revised down to 15.8 million so here&#39;s 18 million we&#39;re at 158 this is 18 158 18 158 18 now look at the last cycle 2005 it peaked actually above 20 but it was you know 18 for some time at the top of the cycle it stays up at 18 for a few years before it rolls over okay so it was at 18 from you know 2006 to 2004 to 2006 basically then the previous cycle before that was the late 90s it got up over 18 in 1999 then the previous cycle before that it got over got again peaked over 20 actually but mostly over 18 in like 1987 and 1986 and they also all trough below 10 million in 1981 it trough below 10 million in 2008 it trough below 10 million in 2020 it trough below 10 million it&#39;s mind bogging considering how much the population has grown leaving that aside if we know that it&#39;s going to 18 million for shizel as Snoop Dog the Olympic MC would say then we know that what can the question is if we know what the industry volume is is going to be whether it&#39;s two years out or four years out then we can back into what can Cooper standard earn on that and then what will the market pay for it so you could say well that&#39;s very easy well if they did $18 million in 2017 and they earned $7.20 then the stock could be $140 again or maybe if it doesn&#39;t get a 20 times multiple maybe it gets a 10 times multiple it could be $70 again well that&#39;s good we bought it at $550 it&#39;s at $13 any new money that comes in we&#39;re buying a ton at 122 and $13 we&#39;re we&#39;re super happy to add at the these levels super cheap now now one of the key factors which is a leading indicator of volumes is incentives offered in recent years the oems have experienced the housian days of controlling supplies and selling above MSRP with a wink and a nod all the oems followed suit until now as inventories build partially due to the artificial EV push that was not met with natural demand incentives are starting to accelerate meaning there&#39;s cards on the Lots they got to move them this is the key leading indicator of increasing volumes to come to the lay person one would think that they are increasing incentives because no one wants to buy cars therefore volumes will fall the opposite is true the high rates high prices and low supply has led to pent up Demand with average car on the road now over 13 years old which is a record high the Korean manufacturers will continue to ramp cost ramp lower cost Alternatives forcing the US and Japan oems to follow suit and offer incentives to move their current inventories take a look at this chart this is the average age by vehicle type you can see here Passenger cars at 14 years old light trucked at 12 years old combined at 12.6 years this will hurt OEM margins GM Ford Stanis Toyota Motor Corp so to make up the profit they will have to produce more volume to meet profitability goals if they hold out for Price meaning they they&#39;re unwilling to cut they will lose meaningful share the race to the bottom will be on this is good news for the consumer good for auto suppliers that benefit from volumes and less so for oems we don&#39;t own any oems our play is for volume through Cooper standard so what could this actually mean for Cooper standard forget about what it means when production peaked Peaks at 18 million seever several years out like every cycle for the last 45 years just a move from 15.8 million SAR where we are now to 16.1 million will have a massive impact to earnings per share due to CPS operating leverage we estimate that another 300,000 cars could yield $50 million straight to the bottom line that&#39;s on 17 million shares so um that given how efficient efficiently CPS is now running that implies $3 a share in earnings approximately $3 a share in earnings as a friendly reminder when Cooper standard was bloated and running inefficiently in 2017 the stock traded up to $146 a share on $7 a share of earnings per share at 20 times multiple historically when profitable CPS is traded between a trough multiple of 10 times and a peak multiple of 20 times so if we can go just to 16.1 million SAR and earn $3 a share at 10 to 20 * multiple 3 * EPS * 10 or 20 * multiple equals $30 to $60 per share price what could the business do on a peak SAR of $18 million a few years out the answer is a lot more than it did on 18 million SAR in 2017 because the margins are better and the cost structure is rationalized an assumption of $3 a share for every 300,000 additional SAR after 16.1 million might be too optimistic but what if we cut C that in half I don&#39;t think it&#39;s tooo optimistic but let&#39;s just cut it in half $11.50 more EPS per 300,000 cars from 16.1 million to18 million equals 6.33 * 1.5 = $99.50 a share EPS plus the $3 from 15.8 to 16.1 equals $12.50 a share EPS or 75% more earnings power than when it traded at $146 a share there are no guarantees in anything there&#39;s always always execution risk Market risk unknown risk Etc hedge fund tips opinions not advice C terms\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nBank of America fund manager survey update on Wednesday we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America Global fund manager survey this month they surveyed institutional managers with 500 billion AUM here were the key points you can check out the whole summary here number number one most the most number of survey participants in 16 years believe monetary policy is too restrictive the last few peaks in this level of too restrictive belief marked at or near bottoms to buy cyclical small cap dividend payers and international stocks with the FED funds rate greater than 200 basis points above inflation we concur with this point of view so here our manager saying you&#39;re too restrictive and what happened after each instance number one the market bottomed and number two the FED kite number two sentiment is climbing the wall of worry but not at extreme so this is not the type of sentiment you see at tops it&#39;s more like the sentiment you see near bottoms utilities exposure has skyrocketed to 1.4 standard deviations above its long-term average you remember last year we were pounding the table by by um by utilities when no one wanted them they&#39;re up 50% now everyone wants them I think it&#39;s probably sold to U time long magnificent 7 is still the most crowded trade despite a recent 18% correction so there&#39;s probably a little bit more pain there from uh uh from some spots managers Outlook pessimism on the economy mirrors levels you see near Market bottoms versus Market tops investors who see stronger global economy in the next 12 months this is what you saw in 2009 huge rally this is what you saw at the 2020 lows huge rally\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ngxo Logistics update here were the highlights they had 19% Revenue year-over-year but that was because they closed the winon acquisition in the UK they&#39;re going to have $50 million of synergies out of that one 2% or organic Revenue growth 270 million in new business wins sales pipel increased to 12-month high of 2.3 billion on track to sign up a record amount of new business this year uh sequential Improvement in organic revenue and strong free cash flow reaffirm their guidance and strengthening consumer demand in the UK which is 50% they generated 115 million of cash flow from operation compared to 61 million year on-year and 31 million of free cash flow compared to 3 million they&#39;re guiding at 30 to 40% free cash flow conversion uh on 800 and call it 20 million adjusted eidos so call it 300 million of free cash flow backend loaded which is usually in line with their seasonality also in line with what they&#39;re seeing uh regarding inventory levels for the holiday season which are much better than last year which was disappointing the restock cycle has begun uh they did adjusted eida of 187 million this quarter and operating cash flow of5 million you can see that you can see the recent winds and expansions from Levis is a big deal in Germany uh they&#39;re getting some of the Industrials now rathon in UK Boeing carfor uh wh Smith trindall Etc and then their wins came from 21 from competitors 32% new activity from existing and 47% came from uh clients that were Outsourcing their supply chain management and Logistics Outsourcing to gxo which is a trend why because your margins increase when you Outsource that business and uh and that&#39;s a good thing for earnings and that&#39;s a good thing for uh CEO stock options and they all want to do it and that trend is going to accelerate in coming years\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nCPI today came in at 0 2% which was in line with expectations uh year on-ear came in at 2.9 versus estimates of 3.0 and last print was 3.0 so that was better than expected on CPI also better than expected on PPI at 2.2 versus 2.3 which is the leading indicator for CPI and month on Monon was 0.1 versus 0.2 all the other numbers don&#39;t matter uh earnings as we covered better than expected 10.8% versus 8.9 but the most important thing is guidance has been revised up by 1% since the beginning of January still holding in at 279 for next year\n\ninventory levels also we definitely started to see those return uh so from that low point of the end of last year I think that was really the inflection point for inventory levels across all regions definitely we&#39;re seeing inventory levels come back customers already starting I think to prepare for this year&#39;s holiday season sales have been strong sales pipelines really strong deal size is getting big bigger duration of contracts getting bigger um um Continental Europe UK we feel the business is very good trajectory of growth North America still a little bit uncertain but we do see the signs of an improving situation later in the year not least the fact we&#39;ve got the holiday season ahead of us this year&#39;s period will be better period for us than last year as far as it relates to the holiday season free cash flow blah blah blah as you would recall our cash flow Trends tend to be second half tilted every year so our guidance is reflecting that uh fear and greed index down to 26 up from 21 last week so there&#39;s still a lot of fear in the market which creates opportunity into that first cut and then uh economic data we covered the PPI and CPI were the big deals um you have uh the CPI today came in at 0 2% which was in line with expectations uh year on-ear came in at 2.9 versus estimates of 3.0 and last print was 3.0 so that was better than expected on CPI also better than expected on PPI at 2.2 versus 2.3 which is the leading indicator for CPI and month on Monon was 0.1 versus 0.2 all the other numbers don&#39;t matter uh earnings as we covered better than expected 10.8% versus 8.9 but the most important thing is guidance has been revised up by 1% since the beginning of January still holding in at 279 for next year so the podcast is over we&#39;re going to go

mahark says hi Tom big fan of the podcast I&#39;m with you on PayPal Baba vfc was wondering if you are maybe looking at w BD in light of a recent drop management is selling it as a turnaround but it seems to be a grind any thoughts uh I&#39;m not going to get involved in that we&#39;ve looked at that three or four times in the\n\nask me anything  question I don&#39;t like I mean zlov is pulling $40 million a year in salary and and destroying the company I think t\n\nask me anything question I don&#39;t like I mean zlov is pulling $40 million a year in salary and and destroying the company I think t here is\n\nI don&#39;t want to be evolved with it I think it&#39;s got too much debt I know it&#39;s got free cash flow it&#39;s just too hairy for me at the moment so I&#39;m going to pass um I&#39;m and and I don&#39;t want a correlation Disney I&#39;ve got a margin of safety cuz I got the parks I got everything else um so I&#39;m happy with Disney I don&#39;t need to play in the gutter with uh Warner Brothers if it works it&#39;ll be a triple quadruple if it doesn&#39;t you got goose egg not interested in that Disney if it&#39;s if it fails I&#39;m down 20% for a little while if it succeeds I&#39;m up double and my options are up three and 4x and that&#39;s uh highly probable so uh Jim Jones was wondering about com stock um yeah the reason the share count increased is because um Jerry Jones put up a lot of equity for the company to write out the shorter term Thing Once the free cash flow kicks on as natural gas prices they&#39;ll buy in the stock and it&#39;ll be back to the races I I still like it and that&#39;s basically what it was and uh and we&#39;re comfortable with that Conrad voy and that&#39;s very common in those e&amp;p companies also their share count expands and then it contracts once the cash flow spets go through the roof because they don&#39;t do so in a linear fashion they do so in a parabolic fashion and when the cash gushes they just buy in all that excess share count and it just goes to the moon um and it&#39;s trading not only nowhere near proved reserves it&#39;s trading nowhere near unproved reserves as well even at these depressed prices ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n Tomas student and listener from Germany this is from Conrad Voit thanks a lot for the great insights on your podcast you recently talked about small caps out performing over the next few months how did you design a potential trade on that Russ F or options do you have any specific stocks in mind yeah I got one it&#39;s called Cooper standard uh but you could buy the ETF which is iwm or others that are small cap exposure if you wanted to play it that way um we prefer individual small cap stocks JP ding uh people often ask about when you know when to leave a trade what about when you&#39;re too early I don&#39;t mind being too early I&#39;m probably too early on 3M but I&#39;m happy to ring the register I thought I might have been too early on Intel last year at 48 I think I was because it went to 51 and then it crashed down to 29 and then we just had this uh toaca last week which it went down to 18 or whatever it went to now it&#39;s back to 20 um uh and we and we rebuilt the position we sold it uh 48 so you know I I don&#39;t I know where I&#39;m getting out before I get in to 99% of the positions the only thing that would change my mind is if the fundamentals got so outstandingly better than than I anticipated uh um then uh then I would then I would consider staying in longer than I anticipated but that hasn&#39;t happened yet in 3M and that um I think long term it will but um but every now and then you got to ring the register you can&#39;t just ride everything up and back down and back up you got to you know hit the register and if it goes against you maybe rebuild the position and if it goes away from you like so what I made a multibagger on the options made a lot on the stock and on on on to the next um Cooper standard May 2022 look great but also looks like the stock won&#39;t meaningfully move until car volumes and free cash flow comes back meaningfully in second half 2025 so you just prioritize other opportunities and wait on putting new capital in CPS as it&#39;s likely to Flat down like when did you have the crystal ball like how do you know when volumes are coming back 6 months ago they thought volumes were going to be 161 now they&#39;re 158 how do you know 3 months from now they don&#39;t say 17 um um you know after the FED cuts and you get all these people rushing out for Christmas you just don&#39;t know is the answer to your question number one and number two they didn&#39;t elect cash pay on the debt versus pick because they&#39;re fearful that things are going to be going poorly uh these guys are dialed in and when they see what&#39;s happening with incentives and they see what&#39;s happened every other cycle they know what&#39;s going to happen to volumes and they have a better finger on the pulse than we do so I you know I don&#39;t care look I got I went through that byd trade that Charlie merer did that had like four 50 to 70% draw Downs before it went up like 12x in one year so he couldn&#39;t know when that was going to happen but it didn&#39;t matter because the kager over the 20 years was like 20s something 25% uh because he stayed in why because he didn&#39;t have leverage so if you&#39;re you know jumping around looking for the next beex headline and noise you&#39;re going to miss all these opportunities so for me no I&#39;ll just use the flat opportunity to to put more money to work when I&#39;m able to or just sit there patiently this is the business that you get paid for inactivity not activity the reason most people lose is because they have to jump around and chase the next shiny object and get their faces smacked the people who make money in this business are patient and probably golfers because they know how to just step away if they&#39;ve done the work and they know what they own um you know it was funny I was talking to a friend and I had a I had the worst round of uh since last year this weekend and you know the weekend before I had a great round uh qualifying for the Club Championship first round and uh and I was like kind of whining to a friend and he&#39;s like you know it&#39;s like you don&#39;t mind volatility in stocks why do you mind volatility in your scores so much I said because with stocks I&#39;m 100% certain of the underlying fundamentals I have no problem with that I know they&#39;re going to work out a golf I&#39;m you know probably 70% sure of my underlying fundamentals so uh so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the key difference here so the answer your question JP is you do what you want but I would never sell a share of that right now because I think it&#39;s going to take another year because when it goes it&#39;s just going to go overnight and you know you&#39;re going to wake up because you sold at 9 and it&#39;s 25 and then it&#39;s 50 and then it then you buy at 50 and it pulls back to 25 before it goes to 100 and you&#39;re just going to get it at all the wrong times 100% guaranteed Patrick K that&#39;s why you have a basket that&#39;s why we run a basket of 8 to 12 companies it&#39;s the same framework across the board some pop immediately in a year some Take 6 months some take two years some take three years some go against us before they turn some take longer than that but on balance we&#39;re going to get our doubles and double pluses over a couple of years and we&#39;re going to keep rinsing and repeating in Aggregate and the ones that take longer wind up making more in the long term and the ones that go faster wind up being shorter uh but if your framework is correct you will make money and you don&#39;t have to worry about this nonsense about timing and being impatient and everything else and if you&#39;re impatient go become an entrepreneur because entrepreneurs get get paid for activity you can you can take action every single minute of every single day and the more action you take the more money you&#39;re make in this business it&#39;s the exact opposite the more action you take the more the worst you&#39;re going to do until you absolutely blow up your account so um less action with a good framework is how fortunes are made over time and low leverage um Patrick K thanks for the valuable time and effort you consistently share with us you&#39;re the real MVP thank you very much uh\n\nrates falling potential unwind of the locked in effect a concern for Home Building or is a supplying balance too fast Mak look rates are going to come down that game is going to be back on I haven&#39;t found anything that I want to buy yet but I&#39;m keeping an eye on it Ben Russo I&#39;m I&#39;m actually comfortable with the derivative plays I&#39;m already got my exposure through gen and Stanley Black and Decker so I&#39;m good there um Ben Russo hi Tom thanks for all the information lessons you put out in part on the regular could you please take a look at AMR focuses BuyBacks and NVR all right let&#39;s see am r ah a minor why do you keep sending me these crappy miners all right so you want me to take a look at a stock that&#39;s up 450x and now you&#39;re interested I&#39;m going to tell you before anything I&#39;m not interested I I&#39;m not I don&#39;t even have to look at the numbers so number one based on this pick uh welcome to the podcast and I hope you will stick with us for many months ahead and you&#39;re going to learn how to um do a great job uh what the problem I see here Ben is that cash flow peaked two years ago it&#39;s collapsing revenues are rolling over uh return on Capital margins are rolling over I want nothing to do this is a stock that&#39;s up 400x and is rolling over on every single metric I mean this would be probably something to short to be honest with you but um I&#39;m not I I haven&#39;t done enough work number one to do that with conviction number two if I was going to short a particular stock I would never speak about it publicly and I&#39;m not going to short this stock so but I just say if I had to do something it wouldn&#39;t be long let&#39;s just put it that way uh but I need to do a lot more work either way but thank you for tuning in and what was the second one NVR you wanted me to look at a home builder all right so this has been a steady grower for a long time it&#39;s basically at new highs I I I just wait for this stuff to pull back um let&#39;s just take a look this is going to trade with all of them xhb what is the home builders doing right now yeah basically at new highs now if you didn&#39;t buy this in the hole in 2022 or 2020 just wait there&#39;s nothing to do with it play the ancillary plays that are in the hole from the dstock restock cycle like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and gener is our view I I know gen&#39;s up almost double already and Stanley starting to take off but I think think you know these are basically getting going for a new cycle uh opinion on oxy Buffett loves it the name&#39;s near as average the name is not near as average because he did a warrant deal and everyone thinks he&#39;s buying all this stock what he&#39;s doing is converting warrants that he had at much lower prices so everyone&#39;s following him and buying the stock up um I just like comto right now if I find another Energy play I will let you guys know but there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s standing out for me yet um so\n\nuh what the problem I see here Ben is that cash flow peaked two years ago it's collapsing revenues are rolling over uh return on Capital margins are rolling over I want nothing to do this is a stock that's up 400x and is rolling over on every single metric I mean this would be probably something to short to be honest with you but um I'm not I I haven't done enough work number one to do that with conviction number two if I was going to short a particular stock I would never speak about it publicly and I'm not going to short this stock so but I just say if I had to do something it wouldn't be long let's just put it that way uh but I need to do a lot more work either way but thank you for tuning in and what was the second one NVR you wanted me to look at a home builder all right so this has been a steady grower for a long time

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nvanney and Company last Thursday thanks to Stu vanney as well we&#39;re going to listen in here for the markets it is a rally Dow&#39;s up 476 nasdaq&#39;s up 219 course look we&#39;ve been here before Market straight up and then in the afternoon it goes straight down I don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to close but right now it&#39;s up Tom Hayes joins us to look at the market this morning is the Fed in your opinion is the Fed doing the right thing leaving rates exactly where they are until September they&#39;re not doing the right thing St but they&#39;re going to get away with it and that&#39;s because as we saw this morning as it relates to to the economy the rumors of My Demise are greatly exaggerated so we saw initial jobless claims come in lower than expected they&#39;re going to get away with it the problem is why you&#39;re seeing all this volatility is Bank of Japan bailed out the West while we were fighting inflation they were the global liquidity provider buying bonds globally buying equities globally and when they needed to hike to fight inflation we didn&#39;t come to their rescue when they hiked last week the FED should have been cutting and we wouldn&#39;t see this volatility so boj had to back off until September when the fed&#39;s going to cut and now we&#39;ve got a high chance 80 some odd percent chance of a 50 basis percent cut in September and the Market&#39;s doing well the Market&#39;s doing great there you go I know you like two stocks in particular and I&#39;m interested in this Disney Disney&#39;s all the way down to $84 a share I mean that&#39;s a dip and a half Disney you can&#39;t give away right now and I&#39;ll tell you I look at Disney Disney&#39;s sum of the parts okay so you have the parks and the experiences people are worried that the parks are slowing down for the next couple of quarters they&#39;re going to do 10 billion of ebit which implies $80 a share in value for the parks and experiences that means Disney plus is worth zero ESPN is worth zero theatrical Productions is worth zero you saw Deadpool it&#39;s going to be a billion dollar franchise inside out too billion dollar franchise it&#39;s attributed zero they&#39;ve got3 million subscribers Netflix has 277 million they get a quarter of a trillion valuation this business gets zero so we think between the parks and the streaming over time the streaming can do 10 to 15 billion of ebit which implies $150 to $190 a share over the next 3 to 5 years and you can&#39;t give it away today if you bought it for 84 you&#39;d be satisfied with just a 100 bucks in a six or seven months Take the Long View here one last one and we&#39;ve often covered this gener the generator people fantastic business uh they got in trouble from 2001 because they Overstock during covid they spent eight quarters working through that Overstock dstock cycle now they&#39;re in the restock cycle uh residential was up 8% commercial was up 10% they beat and raised for this quarter so we we like this business the grid is unstable and we&#39;re entering hurricane season as rates go down so people are going to be able to finance them more easily met a good case where&#39;s it go 137 Now where&#39;s it going uh this thing is probably over time going to work towards 200 give it it 12 24 36 months 12 2 4 that&#39;s okay you know accordion of time frame I&#39;ll tell you they&#39;ve got 6.25% gener uh penetration for their total addressable Market uh this has tremendous opportunity moving forward so I want to be conservative here but uh our expectations are much higher than that got it\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nI want to thank Jeff Cohen and Trinity Chavez for having me on NYS ETV from the New York Stock Exchange last uh just uh yesterday when the PPI inflation numbers came out we&#39;ll tune in here open right now and joining me to talk more about this eventful day is Thomas Hayes he is a chairman and managing partner and member well actually managing member at Great Hill capital good morning good morning Trinity thanks for having me today absolutely so let&#39;s lead things off with some news that just came in about an hour ago the release of July by wholesale price data what are you taking away from the fresh data well this was phenomenal for the markets and the markets like it uh basically it came in at 2.2% uh versus 2.3% expectations year on-ear and month- on Monon uh uh 10 basis points versus 20 basis points expectations the interesting thing about this report Trinity is that 70% of the inflation was energy based Energy Products and the other thing that we saw which is a change from recent history is that goods were hotter than Services you know the last few months Services have been very very sticky and goods have been in in Decline so it&#39;s nice to see Services come down and the market certainly likes it now the key Trinity is the impact that it has on expectations for rate cuts which is what has the markets uh waiting with baited breath so more inflation data arrives tomorrow when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases Consumer Price data for July so what are you pricing out here yeah I think it&#39;s expected to bump up a little bit from uh it was negative one10 to 1% last month uh for the month on Monon this month it&#39;s expected to be plus 210 of 1% and 3% year onye the key though will be is this trend correct and the trend that I&#39;m talking about is expectations for probabilities of fed Cuts in September right now as of this morning just a few minutes ago we have a 55% chance of a 50 basis point cut in September and a 45% chance of a 25 basis point cut 0% chance of no cuts which is a big change from just a couple of months ago and then as of December because of these inflation numbers that came in this morning we have a 100% chance of 75 75 basis points by December and we have 78% chance of 100 basis points by December and the market likes it the Market&#39;s up they just want to see confirmation tomorrow so if you see a little uncertainty midday just know the Market&#39;s waiting for CPI tomorrow Trinity okay and the CME fed watch tool is forecasting 100% chance of rate cut next month but it&#39;s also showing yes so it&#39;s also showing though a dead heat when it comes to Traders expecting a 25 basis point cut or a 50 50 base point cut so what do you believe that we&#39;ll see next month as this all goes down yeah it&#39;s a coin flip the key more than whether it&#39;s 25 or 50 is that they get started because they can always speed up or slow down the market has been waiting with baited breath for the FED to\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\n is a change from recent history is that goods were hotter than Services you know the last few months Services have been very very sticky and goods have been in in Decline so it&#39;s nice to see Services come down and the market certainly likes it now the

than whether it&#39;s 25 or 50 is that they get started because they can always speed up or slow down the market has been waiting with baited breath for the FED to\nfinally  move uh we&#39;re very very restrictive over 200 basis points above inflation so they have to get started and they have to adjust as they go along and see the data so uh I think that&#39;s less important for equities than knowing that they&#39;re in the game and they&#39;re not going to be too uh rigid in being data dependent they have to move before we hit 2% cuz if they move by the time we hit 2% we&#39;re already in deflation and that&#39;s a much harder problem to solve and from your Vantage Point do you think that the FED waited too long to begin cutting rids yes but they&#39;ll get away with it well I mean that was a short and sweet answer and we&#39;ve oh go ahead yeah they certainly waited too long but they will get away with it so long as they move in September they have the Jackson Hole meeting as an opportunity to convey some doish and to signal for September which should hold things together until they\n\nheadlines  yeah so there&#39;s it&#39;s definitely created some bargain opportunities I think we&#39;re going to hold up here into the first cut we may see some volatility in the fall after that first cut and before the election but on balance look earnings are strong 10.8% year on-year with 78% of the companies reporting that that compares to U analysts expected 8.9% earnings growth to have 10.8% is really really good for Q2 if you look at the GDP now we&#39;re still growing at 2 .9% GDP growth is a big deal and then estimates for next year have not only held up but they&#39;ve gone up in the last few weeks up 1% uh since July 1st still $279 for the S&amp;P next year which is 15.2% earnings growth so Trinity when people say the multiples are too high just say compared to what because the earnings growth is going to be 15.2% so provided the FED does the right thing and starts the cutting process just in the nick of time I think we&#39;re going to hold up I think we&#39;re going to do fine and the one thing everyone&#39;s worried about the consumer don&#39;t bet against the consumers so long as they have a job and so long as the FED starts this cutting process I think we&#39;re going to be able to hold the labor market together and earlier we dove into wholesale prices and consumer prices but there are also a lot of events that are unfolding too like retail sales data on Thursday and housing starts data on Friday for example so what do you feel can Drive the markets later in the week yeah I look I think the short-term numbers everyone knows the consumer is a little bit weak a little bit nervous and part of that has to do with affordability of housing which is going to improve as the FED starts to cut rates uh housing starts you&#39;re going to see uh you know they&#39;re not going to be great until the FED starts to cut rates but once that happens and the consumer has a light at the end of the tunnel knowing the FED is on their side versus you know continuing to gut punch them I I think that things will move forward in the way that everyone expects and uh and we&#39;ll be able to see uh earnings re accelerate margins are are accelerating so things are holding on but the FED needs to act fast and as far as the data this week it&#39;s short-term noise in the scheme of a long-term strong economy\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\na lot of important points right there thank you so much Thomas for joining us thank you Trinity and

    "MACRO_DATA_SLIDES": "\n\nheadlines  yeah so there&#39;s it&#39;s definitely created some bargain opportunities I think we&#39;re going to hold up here into the first cut we may see some volatility in the fall after that first cut and before the election but on balance look earnings are strong 10.8% year on-year with 78% of the companies reporting that that compares to U analysts expected 8.9% earnings growth to have 10.8% is really really good for Q2 if you look at the GDP now we&#39;re still growing at 2 .9% GDP growth is a big deal and then estimates for next year have not only held up but they&#39;ve gone up in the last few weeks up 1% uh since July 1st still $279 for the S&amp;P next year which is 15.2% earnings growth so Trinity when people say the multiples are too

power is going up and uh that trend is going to be fits and starts until it\n\ntakes off and then everyone will play catchup same with equal weights uh absolute same story default rates are declining this is for leverage loans actually they peaked earlier this year and now they&#39;re starting to go down with with raid expectations that&#39;s pretty good to see uh chapter 11 filings though ticking up so this is kind of a mix bag uh this is very interesting from Charles Payne via Ned Davis research he shows since 1945 there have been 89 5% correction 5% pullbacks 10 29 10% pullbacks 10 20% pullbacks and three 40% pullbacks well ladies and gentlemen we just had 2 20% pullbacks in the last four years which means probably coast is clear for some time um statistically speaking uh we had one in 2020 and one in 20 22 and average time to recover for these 5% pullbacks is 1.5 months so uh you know the market is working back up to that fits and starts I would imagine we&#39;re going to recover it by September but if that&#39;s ahead of the first cut I&#39;d be inclined to fade that strength and get defensive into the election uh you know right around the first cut mid-september uh and uh and then build up cash to to get aggressively long into the year end Rally post elction sentiment indicators has dropped to cycle lows I&#39;m seeing a lot of the sentiment indicators point to levels where you want to be a buyer not a seller a lot of stuff got knocked down uh from that carry trade the beginning of the carry trade unwind I think there&#39;s an opportunity to step in uh selectively for the next few weeks if you&#39;re tactical or just long-term and hold through the fall volatility of course which is more along the lines of what we do I think if we do get the strength that we expect for the next three or 4 weeks we&#39;ll probably put on some tactical shorts uh just to take advantage of the opportunity and in in September October um but we&#39;ll take it as it comes uh while while keeping our core Holdings and not getting determined but the things that have reached close to our targets or we&#39;ve made a ton of money on in a reasonable amount of time like the 3M Etc we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to hit the register on some of that stuff uh Global risk demand has recently Fallen Shar sharply into extreme fear territory so again these are periods of opportunity uh motor vehicle loans okay owned incur is okay relative multiple suggests that small caps could outperform large caps over the next 10 years you think yes it&#39;s time back to the 2001 to 2007 period and everyone lining up um Prime of strip So This Is Us prime rate in real terms minus small business funding rates is the highest in 20 years uh and the implication is that they need to cut a lot more than the FED thinks we&#39;ll see uh there are a lot of exceptions right now because of what happened with Co a once in 100 Year event but uh certainly keeping an eye on all of this stuff and not being a Cassandra and not being a primadonna either but just dealing with the data on a day-to-day week- toe basis you can see the 10-day gauge hit Japanese volatility was the highest since the great financial crisis and since they blew up in the late 80s uh Japanese money supply rolling over China&#39;s CPI is going up that&#39;s a sign of recovery so pay close attention to that you saw the same thing off the 2016 lows and a straight up rally uh to 201819 and then the same thing um the 2020 bottoms straight up into beginning of 2022 bottomed early 2024 and now is working higher that&#39;s a big thing that you want to see inflation going up you want to see the Yuan start to strengthen and you want to start to see bond yields going up all of those are coincident with Equity starting to rip in China and all of those are lining up with uh Stronger Yen outflows from Japan which was hot money from China Etc PPI confirmed the CPI in China worst outflow from bank loans since March of 2020 that was uh uh during the carry trade on wine this talks about Chinese uh out producing in terms of getting nuclear energy capacity that&#39;s a big deal um BuyBacks by corporate clients are nearing 2019 highs so that&#39;s a back stop supported for the markets which which should be part of the reason for the August early September strength is the blackout periods are over earnings are out and now companies can buy back stocks with their cash hordes balance sheets are good and so on moving right along midcap etf&#39;s recent buy buying spree after selling Spate so the money the money is starting to come back into mids it will follow into Falls um this is just a reiteration of Charles&#39;s data 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average 10% pullbacks occur one times a year on average 15% Corrections occur every other year on average 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years and as I said we&#39;ve had two in four years so we&#39;re kind of fronted loaded and we should have some smoother sailing for a little while prospectively Wake Me Up When September end so we should see this strength in sept ear August to early September I think it&#39;s going to be and actually going to be the sell the first hike uh also that will be supported by um uh election uncertainties so I think you know as you get into I think it&#39;s September 17th if you have strength and a lot of profits it&#39;s time to book some maybe put on some tactical shorts and then uh mid mid October late October because of the election you can probably start to buy stuff in the hole and ride the um the money machine into year end year end rally industrial inventory cycle Illinois&#39;s toolworks this is earnings quotes from their calls destocking which was a headwind all of last year is no longer a significant Factor at this point we&#39;re going to hear from uh um gxo on that as well uh Johnson Controls overall I think that for the most part the large destocking is behind us guys this is the whole theme of our portfolio destock to restock whether it&#39;s standle whether even whether it&#39;s Intel whether it&#39;s um gener whether it&#39;s it whether even it was uh 3M by the way and 3M probably has a lot more juice in it ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s just you know when you get that kind move in that short period of time especially on the options which some of the spreads we did were up 3 4X um you got to you got to hit the window and uh and we may revisit that one in the meantime we&#39;ll hang on to svent for the time being uh arm Holdings that&#39;s a different business that&#39;s cognizant Microsoft that&#39;s Tech that is Tech Tech okay so that&#39;s All Tech earnings mandelis says they make Oreo cookies consumer incomes are rising which helps to reduce the inflation driven Financial strain on many households as a result private label growth in our categories is decelerating while branded share growth is improving that is fascinating that is that goes against the the common narrative um there here&#39;s Marriott we are seeing a stronger performance in the upper chain scales than compared to our lower chain scales that&#39;s more in line with the narrative uh MGM which is casinos majority of our customers the middle end to high end are still pretty strong still visiting quite a bit the lower end of the database has seen a bit of softening Proctor and Gamble makes tide so from a consumer standpoint we generally don&#39;t see the dynamic of consumer pressure that some are describing if you look at a couple Dynamics private label shares as an example which typically would be increasing during the time of significant consumer pressure that&#39;s not what we&#39;re seeing fascinating okay uh Matt Ser minaro from fundstrat says a peak and put call has led to immediate term intermediate term lows and equities that&#39;s what we saw early this month so now where&#39;re fits and starts working back up just like we saw uh in past instances high yield credit spread yields blew out they&#39;re now coming back in so that&#39;s positive Market are again pricing more fed Cuts in the next 12 months uh we find we find no evidence that hurricane Barrel in Texas contributed to the rise in temporary layoffs but summer Auto Plant retooling shutdowns might have contributed so what they&#39;re trying to say is that the labor market is not cracking yet and Claudia s of the s r has been saying similar stuff she&#39;s saying pay attention this might time might be different but you got to act soon is effective what she&#39;s saying so maybe it&#39;s the auto retooling and maybe it&#39;s also the immigration which we&#39;re going to see some data on here uh other indicators suggest layoffs remain low Bank of America credit and debit card spending per household decreased by 410 of 1% year onye in July so there&#39;s some weakness there okay we did the inflation it&#39;s been the second longest manufacturing recession in history so I could see a situation where you have some softening for a little bit while Manu you know manufacturing has been in a recession and we did have that technical recession two quarters of negative GDP growth in uh first and second quarter of 2022 they just didn&#39;t label it as a recession it&#39;s like a double dis dip recession just like we had during the vulka era and then we had 18 years of prosperity um I could see a situation where manufacturing starts to re accelerate and that kind of offsets a a customer that&#39;s taking a breather a consumer that&#39;s taking a breather although we&#39;re going to see from gxo earnings that uh the Christmas holiday season based on stocks seem to be looking certainly better than last year and more normalized so I wouldn&#39;t count out you know what I always say is don&#39;t count out the US consumer if they have a job and the question is whether they have jobs and and that&#39;s going to be a question of whether you believe the most recent jobs report was what to expect Pro moving forward which means we are weakening dramatically or if it was a oneof from Auto retooling and from uh the immigration Spike number of immigrant visas has continued to rise you can see it there household debt outstanding as a share of GDP is down over the past decade so the consumer has deleveraged tremendously since 2009 household balance sheet still in good shape Financial Obligations relative to incomes are staying low by historical standards hasn&#39;t been this low since the 60s maybe uh this chart only goes back to 1983 so that&#39;s positive uh personal bankruptcy filing rates are hovering over multi-decade lows so you know you see a lot of people showing these two-year charts and it&#39;s like oh they&#39;re going through the the roof but if you go back you know 50 years they&#39;re way below normal average share loans and foreclosure remains very low at 46% housing affordability index remains at record lows this is uh the worst it&#39;s been since the vulker vulker era uh economic surprise index City Group economic surprise index turning up this is a key one the election year seasonality is kind of going according to plan here so far uh we did have that correction in Late July early August and then it should bode well for strength into mid-september and that&#39;s right around the first fed cut which historically has been sell the first cut weakness into the end of October just before the election and then year end rally I I think that&#39;s going to be the model now you know can it be that easy the answer is no but it&#39;s a good framework and then you adapt based on how things play out in in real time but uh that&#39;s our base case at the moment uh you could see how extreme things got here at macro charts off his core risk model and bouncing off those lows do we go retest those I don&#39;t know if we do or we don&#39;t but um uh that was that money market assets these as rates come down once you get the first cut a good slug of these have to come back into the market just like they did in 2020 you know half a half a trillion dollars came into the market pretty quickly once they back stop the corporate credit Market uh I think the same will be true once you get your first one or two cuts we get probably a half a trillion in for year end into equities as people lose out on short rates coming down this is going to be the most important chart we covered today with uh Us sell through on uh Auto Autos uh pretty excited about that I went to see Cooper standard at JP Morgan last Thursday and um saw the presentation talked with uh with the people and um I&#39;ll share some some um thoughts on that as as we get to the article of the week Japanese Yen we&#39;ve covered enough of that hedge funds boost bearish commodity bet uh you&#39;re seeing Comstock res resources start to rip the last few days from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm when hedge funds get this bearish on Commodities I I think they&#39;re probably opportunities in energy I think there a few\n\nquestions  there but uh for my money I I still like com stock is is the play uh commodity Cycles boom bus Cycles deviations from the trend so you can see here it&#39;s coming out of the lower Trend I did I want to uh it&#39;s coming out of a low and checking back just like it did th this this is a good framework model for what we&#39;re seeing you had this low and then a rally and then check back and then a multi-year rally and I think that&#39;s a reasonable framework and again that what does that point to is 2001 to 2007 I think it&#39;s a similar situation over and over we keep see seeing very strong similarity of all of these things uh no one&#39;s buying calls everyone bought puts in the holes therefore they had to get smoked and they did um thank you for playing try again uh election year seasonal pattern 1968 versus 2024 and the reason Jeff Hirsch is pointing this one is because LBJ left office and then you had a mid July correction uh ahead of the Democratic Convention and then you had the year end rally so this would imply that you don&#39;t get any major weakness in October meaning it&#39;s just straight up into the end of the year if if passes any prologue uh which is why you know only on things that we&#39;ve seen huge multi-baggers would we raise cash um certainly on the option side and then the underlying stock has to be up 50 75 100% And then um we&#39;ll see what things look like in mid-september is what I&#39;m trying to tell you there&#39;s a lot of different analogues we can follow the key is we&#39;re intermediate term bullish economy is good earnings are good 10.8% earnings growth versus 8.9% estimated uh 15.2% estimated for next year uh GDP now at 2.9% you know things are humming along biggest number one tail risk people are saying is a US recession that&#39;s If the Fed screws up which they&#39;re fully capable of doing but I think there&#39;s enough pressure and precedent and transparency now that I think they&#39;ve got to go in September and I think they&#39;ve got to talk doish in um I think I I think their best play is if they&#39;re being cautious talk like a crazy dove in Jackson Hole and then only give 25 basis points in September and then if you&#39;re wrong you can always go up to you can always uh move in November or you can go to like a 75 basis point in December and signal that in in in between and then the market will price it in ahead of time European relative to 12-month us forward PE this is pretty interesting so the European PE doing a lot of talking is um 35 to 40% lower than the USP and we&#39;re going to see and gxo earnings that demand in Europe and UK which is where most of their business is is exceeding the US they&#39;re seeing a little softness in the US but they&#39;re seeing a lot of strength in Europe and you can buy it at 30 to 40% lower which is why we have that UK play in serious position in gxo and a tiny position in Asos uh which we have yet to find a reason to make into a real position but we&#39;re keeping an eye on it um and looking for some more opportunities in Europe as well uh imig oh this is this is the chart I wanted to show you immigration adjusted unemployment rate is lower so remember this shot up to 4.3 but if you back out the aberrational immigration it&#39;s still down at 3.6 and this is the Delta between is are we going into a hard Landing with the Som rule or is this time different because of this immigration uh artificial immigration Spike um which leaves us at 3.6% and that&#39;s what you have to keep in mind uh be databased and be flexible inflation expectations basically down to 10year lows for three-year inflation expectations at what is it 2.3 uh Chinese government bond yields started going up that&#39;s very positive China goes to New extremes and Crackdown on bond market frenzy we want to see this go up up up along with equities um we&#39;ll cover that in the fund manager survey but basically you&#39;re seeing sentiment levels at the levels you see closer to Bottoms not closer to Tops which is positive um the gap between Mega cap Tech and others is shrinking profit growth for magnificent 7 starts slowing rest of S&P hits its stride we&#39;ve been talking about this for months now you can see it happening net income growth uh went from 50% now it&#39;s down to 25% and going lower uh S&amp;P magnificent 7 net income growth now starting to move to high single digits from being negative up until last quarter um feds featuring on earnings call like never before so that&#39;s becoming a major major issue just like it was uh back here it spiked in 2000 late 2008 when they\n\nwanted to do this update on Cooper standard since going to the presentation at uh JP Morgan last week on Madison Avenue and what was exciting about this is there wasn&#39;t anything new other than the fact um that they talked about what they&#39;re seeing in terms of incentives in the market picking up and that they&#39;ve been following this for decades cuz all these guys are lifelong Auto industry people and you know I have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in in my work and they have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in their work and one of their indicators is when incentives from dealers and manufacturers start ticking up volumes quickly follow and I&#39;m going to explain how that&#39;s counterintuitive in just a minute but let&#39;s go to this chart to start with\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard did $722 a share in earnings in earnings the stock traded at $146 so you basically had a 20 times multiple on that earnings power let me move ahead here last week we went into detail on Cooper standard earnings outlooks and Prospects moving forward as well as our original thesis from May 20222 when we initiated the position around $5.50 a share you can find it here so click there and read the whole thing and then click on the link in that article that goes to our old articles from May of 2022 one concept I wanted to point out is that since 1980 every single cycle has peaked out at 18 million SAR expectations for 2024 were that the industry would do 16.1 million this year it has since been revised down to 15.8 million so here&#39;s 18 million we&#39;re at 158 this is 18 158 18 158 18 now look at the last cycle 2005 it peaked actually above 20 but it was you know 18 for some time at the top of the cycle it stays up at 18 for a few years before it rolls over okay so it was at 18 from you know 2006 to 2004 to 2006 basically then the previous cycle before that was the late 90s it got up over 18 in 1999 then the previous cycle before that it got over got again peaked over 20 actually but mostly over 18 in like 1987 and 1986 and they also all trough below 10 million in 1981 it trough below 10 million in 2008 it trough below 10 million in 2020 it trough below 10 million it&#39;s mind bogging considering how much the population has grown leaving that aside if we know that it&#39;s going to 18 million for shizel as Snoop Dog the Olympic MC would say then we know that what can the question is if we know what the industry volume is is going to be whether it&#39;s two years out or four years out then we can back into what can Cooper standard earn on that and then what will the market pay for it so you could say well that&#39;s very easy well if they did $18 million in 2017 and they earned $7.20 then the stock could be $140 again or maybe if it doesn&#39;t get a 20 times multiple maybe it gets a 10 times multiple it could be $70 again well that&#39;s good we bought it at $550 it&#39;s at $13 any new money that comes in we&#39;re buying a ton at 122 and $13 we&#39;re we&#39;re super happy to add at the these levels super cheap now now one of the key factors which is a leading indicator of volumes is incentives offered in recent years the oems have experienced the housian days of controlling supplies and selling above MSRP with a wink and a nod all the oems followed suit until now as inventories build partially due to the artificial EV push that was not met with natural demand incentives are starting to accelerate meaning there&#39;s cards on the Lots they got to move them this is the key leading indicator of increasing volumes to come to the lay person one would think that they are increasing incentives because no one wants to buy cars therefore volumes will fall the opposite is true the high rates high prices and low supply has led to pent up Demand with average car on the road now over 13 years old which is a record high the Korean manufacturers will continue to ramp cost ramp lower cost Alternatives forcing the US and Japan oems to follow suit and offer incentives to move their current inventories take a look at this chart this is the average age by vehicle type you can see here Passenger cars at 14 years old light trucked at 12 years old combined at 12.6 years this will hurt OEM margins GM Ford Stanis Toyota Motor Corp so to make up the profit they will have to produce more volume to meet profitability goals if they hold out for Price meaning they they&#39;re unwilling to cut they will lose meaningful share the race to the bottom will be on this is good news for the consumer good for auto suppliers that benefit from volumes and less so for oems we don&#39;t own any oems our play is for volume through Cooper standard so what could this actually mean for Cooper standard forget about what it means when production peaked Peaks at 18 million seever several years out like every cycle for the last 45 years just a move from 15.8 million SAR where we are now to 16.1 million will have a massive impact to earnings per share due to CPS operating leverage we estimate that another 300,000 cars could yield $50 million straight to the bottom line that&#39;s on 17 million shares so um that given how efficient efficiently CPS is now running that implies $3 a share in earnings approximately $3 a share in earnings as a friendly reminder when Cooper standard was bloated and running inefficiently in 2017 the stock traded up to $146 a share on $7 a share of earnings per share at 20 times multiple historically when profitable CPS is traded between a trough multiple of 10 times and a peak multiple of 20 times so if we can go just to 16.1 million SAR and earn $3 a share at 10 to 20 * multiple 3 * EPS * 10 or 20 * multiple equals $30 to $60 per share price what could the business do on a peak SAR of $18 million a few years out the answer is a lot more than it did on 18 million SAR in 2017 because the margins are better and the cost structure is rationalized an assumption of $3 a share for every 300,000 additional SAR after 16.1 million might be too optimistic but what if we cut C that in half I don&#39;t think it&#39;s tooo optimistic but let&#39;s just cut it in half $11.50 more EPS per 300,000 cars from 16.1 million to18 million equals 6.33 * 1.5 = $99.50 a share EPS plus the $3 from 15.8 to 16.1 equals $12.50 a share EPS or 75% more earnings power than when it traded at $146 a share there are no guarantees in anything there&#39;s always always execution risk Market risk unknown risk Etc hedge fund tips opinions not advice C terms\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nBank of America fund manager survey update on Wednesday we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America Global fund manager survey this month they surveyed institutional managers with 500 billion AUM here were the key points you can check out the whole summary here number number one most the most number of survey participants in 16 years believe monetary policy is too restrictive the last few peaks in this level of too restrictive belief marked at or near bottoms to buy cyclical small cap dividend payers and international stocks with the FED funds rate greater than 200 basis points above inflation we concur with this point of view so here our manager saying you&#39;re too restrictive and what happened after each instance number one the market bottomed and number two the FED kite number two sentiment is climbing the wall of worry but not at extreme so this is not the type of sentiment you see at tops it&#39;s more like the sentiment you see near bottoms utilities exposure has skyrocketed to 1.4 standard deviations above its long-term average you remember last year we were pounding the table by by um by utilities when no one wanted them they&#39;re up 50% now everyone wants them I think it&#39;s probably sold to U time long magnificent 7 is still the most crowded trade despite a recent 18% correction so there&#39;s probably a little bit more pain there from uh uh from some spots managers Outlook pessimism on the economy mirrors levels you see near Market bottoms versus Market tops investors who see stronger global economy in the next 12 months this is what you saw in 2009 huge rally this is what you saw at the 2020 lows huge rally\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ngxo Logistics update here were the highlights they had 19% Revenue year-over-year but that was because they closed the winon acquisition in the UK they&#39;re going to have $50 million of synergies out of that one 2% or organic Revenue growth 270 million in new business wins sales pipel increased to 12-month high of 2.3 billion on track to sign up a record amount of new business this year uh sequential Improvement in organic revenue and strong free cash flow reaffirm their guidance and strengthening consumer demand in the UK which is 50% they generated 115 million of cash flow from operation compared to 61 million year on-year and 31 million of free cash flow compared to 3 million they&#39;re guiding at 30 to 40% free cash flow conversion uh on 800 and call it 20 million adjusted eidos so call it 300 million of free cash flow backend loaded which is usually in line with their seasonality also in line with what they&#39;re seeing uh regarding inventory levels for the holiday season which are much better than last year which was disappointing the restock cycle has begun uh they did adjusted eida of 187 million this quarter and operating cash flow of5 million you can see that you can see the recent winds and expansions from Levis is a big deal in Germany uh they&#39;re getting some of the Industrials now rathon in UK Boeing carfor uh wh Smith trindall Etc and then their wins came from 21 from competitors 32% new activity from existing and 47% came from uh clients that were Outsourcing their supply chain management and Logistics Outsourcing to gxo which is a trend why because your margins increase when you Outsource that business and uh and that&#39;s a good thing for earnings and that&#39;s a good thing for uh CEO stock options and they all want to do it and that trend is going to accelerate in coming years\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nCPI today came in at 0 2% which was in line with expectations uh year on-ear came in at 2.9 versus estimates of 3.0 and last print was 3.0 so that was better than expected on CPI also better than expected on PPI at 2.2 versus 2.3 which is the leading indicator for CPI and month on Monon was 0.1 versus 0.2 all the other numbers don&#39;t matter uh earnings as we covered better than expected 10.8% versus 8.9 but the most important thing is guidance has been revised up by 1% since the beginning of January still holding in at 279 for next year",
    "FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES": "\n\ntakes off and then everyone will play catchup same with equal weights uh absolute same story default rates are declining this is for leverage loans actually they peaked earlier this year and now they&#39;re starting to go down with with raid expectations that&#39;s pretty good to see uh chapter 11 filings though ticking up so this is kind of a mix bag uh this is very interesting from Charles Payne via Ned Davis research he shows since 1945 there have been 89 5% correction 5% pullbacks 10 29 10% pullbacks 10 20% pullbacks and three 40% pullbacks well ladies and gentlemen we just had 2 20% pullbacks in the last four years which means probably coast is clear for some time um statistically speaking uh we had one in 2020 and one in 20 22 and average time to recover for these 5% pullbacks is 1.5 months so uh you know the market is working back up to that fits and starts I would imagine we&#39;re going to recover it by September but if that&#39;s ahead of the first cut I&#39;d be inclined to fade that strength and get defensive into the election uh you know right around the first cut mid-september uh and uh and then build up cash to to get aggressively long into the year end Rally post elction sentiment indicators has dropped to cycle lows I&#39;m seeing a lot of the sentiment indicators point to levels where you want to be a buyer not a seller a lot of stuff got knocked down uh from that carry trade the beginning of the carry trade unwind I think there&#39;s an opportunity to step in uh selectively for the next few weeks if you&#39;re tactical or just long-term and hold through the fall volatility of course which is more along the lines of what we do I think if we do get the strength that we expect for the next three or 4 weeks we&#39;ll probably put on some tactical shorts uh just to take advantage of the opportunity and in in September October um but we&#39;ll take it as it comes uh while while keeping our core Holdings and not getting determined but the things that have reached close to our targets or we&#39;ve made a ton of money on in a reasonable amount of time like the 3M Etc we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to hit the register on some of that stuff uh Global risk demand has recently Fallen Shar sharply into extreme fear territory so again these are periods of opportunity uh motor vehicle loans okay owned incur is okay relative multiple suggests that small caps could outperform large caps over the next 10 years you think yes it&#39;s time back to the 2001 to 2007 period and everyone lining up um Prime of strip So This Is Us prime rate in real terms minus small business funding rates is the highest in 20 years uh and the implication is that they need to cut a lot more than the FED thinks we&#39;ll see uh there are a lot of exceptions right now because of what happened with Co a once in 100 Year event but uh certainly keeping an eye on all of this stuff and not being a Cassandra and not being a primadonna either but just dealing with the data on a day-to-day week- toe basis you can see the 10-day gauge hit Japanese volatility was the highest since the great financial crisis and since they blew up in the late 80s uh Japanese money supply rolling over China&#39;s CPI is going up that&#39;s a sign of recovery so pay close attention to that you saw the same thing off the 2016 lows and a straight up rally uh to 201819 and then the same thing um the 2020 bottoms straight up into beginning of 2022 bottomed early 2024 and now is working higher that&#39;s a big thing that you want to see inflation going up you want to see the Yuan start to strengthen and you want to start to see bond yields going up all of those are coincident with Equity starting to rip in China and all of those are lining up with uh Stronger Yen outflows from Japan which was hot money from China Etc PPI confirmed the CPI in China worst outflow from bank loans since March of 2020 that was uh uh during the carry trade on wine this talks about Chinese uh out producing in terms of getting nuclear energy capacity that&#39;s a big deal um BuyBacks by corporate clients are nearing 2019 highs so that&#39;s a back stop supported for the markets which which should be part of the reason for the August early September strength is the blackout periods are over earnings are out and now companies can buy back stocks with their cash hordes balance sheets are good and so on moving right along midcap etf&#39;s recent buy buying spree after selling Spate so the money the money is starting to come back into mids it will follow into Falls um this is just a reiteration of Charles&#39;s data 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average 10% pullbacks occur one times a year on average 15% Corrections occur every other year on average 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years and as I said we&#39;ve had two in four years so we&#39;re kind of fronted loaded and we should have some smoother sailing for a little while prospectively Wake Me Up When September end so we should see this strength in sept ear August to early September I think it&#39;s going to be and actually going to be the sell the first hike uh also that will be supported by um uh election uncertainties so I think you know as you get into I think it&#39;s September 17th if you have strength and a lot of profits it&#39;s time to book some maybe put on some tactical shorts and then uh mid mid October late October because of the election you can probably start to buy stuff in the hole and ride the um the money machine into year end year end rally industrial inventory cycle Illinois&#39;s toolworks this is earnings quotes from their calls destocking which was a headwind all of last year is no longer a significant Factor at this point we&#39;re going to hear from uh um gxo on that as well uh Johnson Controls overall I think that for the most part the large destocking is behind us guys this is the whole theme of our portfolio destock to restock whether it&#39;s standle whether even whether it&#39;s Intel whether it&#39;s um gener whether it&#39;s it whether even it was uh 3M by the way and 3M probably has a lot more juice in it ladies and gentlemen it&#39;s just you know when you get that kind move in that short period of time especially on the options which some of the spreads we did were up 3 4X um you got to you got to hit the window and uh and we may revisit that one in the meantime we&#39;ll hang on to svent for the time being uh arm Holdings that&#39;s a different business that&#39;s cognizant Microsoft that&#39;s Tech that is Tech Tech okay so that&#39;s All Tech earnings mandelis says they make Oreo cookies consumer incomes are rising which helps to reduce the inflation driven Financial strain on many households as a result private label growth in our categories is decelerating while branded share growth is improving that is fascinating that is that goes against the the common narrative um there here&#39;s Marriott we are seeing a stronger performance in the upper chain scales than compared to our lower chain scales that&#39;s more in line with the narrative uh MGM which is casinos majority of our customers the middle end to high end are still pretty strong still visiting quite a bit the lower end of the database has seen a bit of softening Proctor and Gamble makes tide so from a consumer standpoint we generally don&#39;t see the dynamic of consumer pressure that some are describing if you look at a couple Dynamics private label shares as an example which typically would be increasing during the time of significant consumer pressure that&#39;s not what we&#39;re seeing fascinating okay uh Matt Ser minaro from fundstrat says a peak and put call has led to immediate term intermediate term lows and equities that&#39;s what we saw early this month so now where&#39;re fits and starts working back up just like we saw uh in past instances high yield credit spread yields blew out they&#39;re now coming back in so that&#39;s positive Market are again pricing more fed Cuts in the next 12 months uh we find we find no evidence that hurricane Barrel in Texas contributed to the rise in temporary layoffs but summer Auto Plant retooling shutdowns might have contributed so what they&#39;re trying to say is that the labor market is not cracking yet and Claudia s of the s r has been saying similar stuff she&#39;s saying pay attention this might time might be different but you got to act soon is effective what she&#39;s saying so maybe it&#39;s the auto retooling and maybe it&#39;s also the immigration which we&#39;re going to see some data on here uh other indicators suggest layoffs remain low Bank of America credit and debit card spending per household decreased by 410 of 1% year onye in July so there&#39;s some weakness there okay we did the inflation it&#39;s been the second longest manufacturing recession in history so I could see a situation where you have some softening for a little bit while Manu you know manufacturing has been in a recession and we did have that technical recession two quarters of negative GDP growth in uh first and second quarter of 2022 they just didn&#39;t label it as a recession it&#39;s like a double dis dip recession just like we had during the vulka era and then we had 18 years of prosperity um I could see a situation where manufacturing starts to re accelerate and that kind of offsets a a customer that&#39;s taking a breather a consumer that&#39;s taking a breather although we&#39;re going to see from gxo earnings that uh the Christmas holiday season based on stocks seem to be looking certainly better than last year and more normalized so I wouldn&#39;t count out you know what I always say is don&#39;t count out the US consumer if they have a job and the question is whether they have jobs and and that&#39;s going to be a question of whether you believe the most recent jobs report was what to expect Pro moving forward which means we are weakening dramatically or if it was a oneof from Auto retooling and from uh the immigration Spike number of immigrant visas has continued to rise you can see it there household debt outstanding as a share of GDP is down over the past decade so the consumer has deleveraged tremendously since 2009 household balance sheet still in good shape Financial Obligations relative to incomes are staying low by historical standards hasn&#39;t been this low since the 60s maybe uh this chart only goes back to 1983 so that&#39;s positive uh personal bankruptcy filing rates are hovering over multi-decade lows so you know you see a lot of people showing these two-year charts and it&#39;s like oh they&#39;re going through the the roof but if you go back you know 50 years they&#39;re way below normal average share loans and foreclosure remains very low at 46% housing affordability index remains at record lows this is uh the worst it&#39;s been since the vulker vulker era uh economic surprise index City Group economic surprise index turning up this is a key one the election year seasonality is kind of going according to plan here so far uh we did have that correction in Late July early August and then it should bode well for strength into mid-september and that&#39;s right around the first fed cut which historically has been sell the first cut weakness into the end of October just before the election and then year end rally I I think that&#39;s going to be the model now you know can it be that easy the answer is no but it&#39;s a good framework and then you adapt based on how things play out in in real time but uh that&#39;s our base case at the moment uh you could see how extreme things got here at macro charts off his core risk model and bouncing off those lows do we go retest those I don&#39;t know if we do or we don&#39;t but um uh that was that money market assets these as rates come down once you get the first cut a good slug of these have to come back into the market just like they did in 2020 you know half a half a trillion dollars came into the market pretty quickly once they back stop the corporate credit Market uh I think the same will be true once you get your first one or two cuts we get probably a half a trillion in for year end into equities as people lose out on short rates coming down this is going to be the most important chart we covered today with uh Us sell through on uh Auto Autos uh pretty excited about that I went to see Cooper standard at JP Morgan last Thursday and um saw the presentation talked with uh with the people and um I&#39;ll share some some um thoughts on that as as we get to the article of the week Japanese Yen we&#39;ve covered enough of that hedge funds boost bearish commodity bet uh you&#39;re seeing Comstock res resources start to rip the last few days from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm when hedge funds get this

the park slowing down for a couple of quarters they released a whole bunch of new stuff over the weekend which we&#39;ll talk about um but the big story if you remember most of the reason we got in parks are great highest return on invested capital but value Act is the activist in this stock and value act turned around Salesforce it turned around um New York Times if they could turn around New York Times they could turn around anything they made New York Times profitable they turned around [Music] um Spotify so those were the three Salesforce New York Times Spotify and they did it all through pricing bundles and increasing the prices and as you saw which the market didn&#39;t respond to they raised the prices right before earnings and they&#39;re going to add the ES SPN to all the bundles all that business is being valued at zero right now it&#39;s got 153 million subscribers on the Disney Plus Part alone leaving aside ESPN which is the number one franchise in sports gaining share not losing share and they&#39;re going to monetize that through streaming uh and so if it&#39;s half what what Netflix is Netflix is valued at you know 300 billion um for you know 277 million subscribers they&#39;ve probably got 200 across platforms they&#39;re valued at zero I&#39;m I&#39;m going to take a wild and crazy bet that it&#39;s worth more than zero Disney plus Wolverine uh inside out to both billion dollar franchises theatrical releases Disney Hulu all that stuff and um let&#39;s just assume it&#39;s not worth half of uh Netflix let&#39;s assume it&#39;s worth a quarter

foreplay is over I mean we&#39;re we&#39;re getting\n\nwanted to do this update on Cooper standard since going to the presentation at uh JP Morgan last week on Madison Avenue and what was exciting about this is there wasn&#39;t anything new other than the fact um that they talked about what they&#39;re seeing in terms of incentives in the market picking up and that they&#39;ve been following this for decades cuz all these guys are lifelong Auto industry people and you know I have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in in my work and they have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in their work and one of their indicators is when incentives from dealers and manufacturers start ticking up volumes quickly follow and I&#39;m going to explain how that&#39;s counterintuitive in just a minute but let&#39;s go to this chart to start with\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard did $722 a share in earnings in earnings the stock traded at $146 so you basically had a 20 times multiple on that earnings power let me move ahead here last week we went into detail on Cooper standard earnings outlooks and Prospects moving forward as well as our original thesis from May 20222 when we initiated the position around $5.50 a share you can find it here so click there and read the whole thing and then click on the link in that article that goes to our old articles from May of 2022 one concept I wanted to point out is that since 1980 every single cycle has peaked out at 18 million SAR expectations for 2024 were that the industry would do 16.1 million this year it has since been revised down to 15.8 million so here&#39;s 18 million we&#39;re at 158 this is 18 158 18 158 18 now look at the last cycle 2005 it peaked actually above 20 but it was you know 18 for some time at the top of the cycle it stays up at 18 for a few years before it rolls over okay so it was at 18 from you know 2006 to 2004 to 2006 basically then the previous cycle before that was the late 90s it got up over 18 in 1999 then the previous cycle before that it got over got again peaked over 20 actually but mostly over 18 in like 1987 and 1986 and they also all trough below 10 million in 1981 it trough below 10 million in 2008 it trough below 10 million in 2020 it trough below 10 million it&#39;s mind bogging considering how much the population has grown leaving that aside if we know that it&#39;s going to 18 million for shizel as Snoop Dog the Olympic MC would say then we know that what can the question is if we know what the industry volume is is going to be whether it&#39;s two years out or four years out then we can back into what can Cooper standard earn on that and then what will the market pay for it so you could say well that&#39;s very easy well if they did $18 million in 2017 and they earned $7.20 then the stock could be $140 again or maybe if it doesn&#39;t get a 20 times multiple maybe it gets a 10 times multiple it could be $70 again well that&#39;s good we bought it at $550 it&#39;s at $13 any new money that comes in we&#39;re buying a ton at 122 and $13 we&#39;re we&#39;re super happy to add at the these levels super cheap now now one of the key factors which is a leading indicator of volumes is incentives offered in recent years the oems have experienced the housian days of controlling supplies and selling above MSRP with a wink and a nod all the oems followed suit until now as inventories build partially due to the artificial EV push that was not met with natural demand incentives are starting to accelerate meaning there&#39;s cards on the Lots they got to move them this is the key leading indicator of increasing volumes to come to the lay person one would think that they are increasing incentives because no one wants to buy cars therefore volumes will fall the opposite is true the high rates high prices and low supply has led to pent up Demand with average car on the road now over 13 years old which is a record high the Korean manufacturers will continue to ramp cost ramp lower cost Alternatives forcing the US and Japan oems to follow suit and offer incentives to move their current inventories take a look at this chart this is the average age by vehicle type you can see here Passenger cars at 14 years old light trucked at 12 years old combined at 12.6 years this will hurt OEM margins GM Ford Stanis Toyota Motor Corp so to make up the profit they will have to produce more volume to meet profitability goals if they hold out for Price meaning they they&#39;re unwilling to cut they will lose meaningful share the race to the bottom will be on this is good news for the consumer good for auto suppliers that benefit from volumes and less so for oems we don&#39;t own any oems our play is for volume through Cooper standard so what could this actually mean for Cooper standard forget about what it means when production peaked Peaks at 18 million seever several years out like every cycle for the last 45 years just a move from 15.8 million SAR where we are now to 16.1 million will have a massive impact to earnings per share due to CPS operating leverage we estimate that another 300,000 cars could yield $50 million straight to the bottom line that&#39;s on 17 million shares so um that given how efficient efficiently CPS is now running that implies $3 a share in earnings approximately $3 a share in earnings as a friendly reminder when Cooper standard was bloated and running inefficiently in 2017 the stock traded up to $146 a share on $7 a share of earnings per share at 20 times multiple historically when profitable CPS is traded between a trough multiple of 10 times and a peak multiple of 20 times so if we can go just to 16.1 million SAR and earn $3 a share at 10 to 20 * multiple 3 * EPS * 10 or 20 * multiple equals $30 to $60 per share price what could the business do on a peak SAR of $18 million a few years out the answer is a lot more than it did on 18 million SAR in 2017 because the margins are better and the cost structure is rationalized an assumption of $3 a share for every 300,000 additional SAR after 16.1 million might be too optimistic but what if we cut C that in half I don&#39;t think it&#39;s tooo optimistic but let&#39;s just cut it in half $11.50 more EPS per 300,000 cars from 16.1 million to18 million equals 6.33 * 1.5 = $99.50 a share EPS plus the $3 from 15.8 to 16.1 equals $12.50 a share EPS or 75% more earnings power than when it traded at $146 a share there are no guarantees in anything there&#39;s always always execution risk Market risk unknown risk Etc hedge fund tips opinions not advice C terms\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nBank of America fund manager survey update on Wednesday we put out a summary of the monthly Bank of America Global fund manager survey this month they surveyed institutional managers with 500 billion AUM here were the key points you can check out the whole summary here number number one most the most number of survey participants in 16 years believe monetary policy is too restrictive the last few peaks in this level of too restrictive belief marked at or near bottoms to buy cyclical small cap dividend payers and international stocks with the FED funds rate greater than 200 basis points above inflation we concur with this point of view so here our manager saying you&#39;re too restrictive and what happened after each instance number one the market bottomed and number two the FED kite number two sentiment is climbing the wall of worry but not at extreme so this is not the type of sentiment you see at tops it&#39;s more like the sentiment you see near bottoms utilities exposure has skyrocketed to 1.4 standard deviations above its long-term average you remember last year we were pounding the table by by um by utilities when no one wanted them they&#39;re up 50% now everyone wants them I think it&#39;s probably sold to U time long magnificent 7 is still the most crowded trade despite a recent 18% correction so there&#39;s probably a little bit more pain there from uh uh from some spots managers Outlook pessimism on the economy mirrors levels you see near Market bottoms versus Market tops investors who see stronger global economy in the next 12 months this is what you saw in 2009 huge rally this is what you saw at the 2020 lows huge rally\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ngxo Logistics update here were the highlights they had 19% Revenue year-over-year but that was because they closed the winon acquisition in the UK they&#39;re going to have $50 million of synergies out of that one 2% or organic Revenue growth 270 million in new business wins sales pipel increased to 12-month high of 2.3 billion on track to sign up a record amount of new business this year uh sequential Improvement in organic revenue and strong free cash flow reaffirm their guidance and strengthening consumer demand in the UK which is 50% they generated 115 million of cash flow from operation compared to 61 million year on-year and 31 million of free cash flow compared to 3 million they&#39;re guiding at 30 to 40% free cash flow conversion uh on 800 and call it 20 million adjusted eidos so call it 300 million of free cash flow backend loaded which is usually in line with their seasonality also in line with what they&#39;re seeing uh regarding inventory levels for the holiday season which are much better than last year which was disappointing the restock cycle has begun uh they did adjusted eida of 187 million this quarter and operating cash flow of5 million you can see that you can see the recent winds and expansions from Levis is a big deal in Germany uh they&#39;re getting some of the Industrials now rathon in UK Boeing carfor uh wh Smith trindall Etc and then their wins came from 21 from competitors 32% new activity from existing and 47% came from uh clients that were Outsourcing their supply chain management and Logistics Outsourcing to gxo which is a trend why because your margins increase when you Outsource that business and uh and that&#39;s a good thing for earnings and that&#39;s a good thing for uh CEO stock options and they all want to do it and that trend is going to accelerate in coming years\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nCPI today came in at 0 2% which was in line with expectations uh year on-ear came in at 2.9 versus estimates of 3.0 and last print was 3.0 so that was better than expected on CPI also better than expected on PPI at 2.2 versus 2.3 which is the leading indicator for CPI and month on Monon was 0.1 versus 0.2 all the other numbers don&#39;t matter uh earnings as we covered better than expected 10.8% versus 8.9 but the most important thing is guidance has been revised up by 1% since the beginning of January still holding in at 279 for next year",
    "ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA": "\n\nCity Group economic surprise index turning up this is a key one the election year seasonality is kind of going according to plan here so far uh we did have that correction in Late July early August and then it should bode well for strength into mid-september and that&#39;s right around the first fed cut which historically has been sell the first cut weakness into the end of October just before the election and then year end rally I I think that&#39;s going to be the model now you know can it be that easy the answer is no but uh that&#39;s a good framework and then you adapt based on how things play out in in real time but uh that&#39;s our base case at the moment uh you could see how extreme things got here at macro charts off his core risk model and bouncing off those lows do we go retest those I don&#39;t know if we do or we don&#39;t but um uh that was that money market assets these as rates come down once you get the first cut a good slug of these have to come back into the market just like they did in 2020 you know half a half a trillion dollars came into the market pretty quickly once they back stop the corporate credit Market uh I think the same will be true once you get your first one or two cuts we get probably a half a trillion in for year end into equities as people lose out on short rates coming down this is going to be the most important chart we covered today with uh Us sell through on uh Auto Autos uh pretty excited about that I went to see Cooper standard at JP Morgan last Thursday and um saw the presentation talked with uh with the people and um I&#39;ll share some some um thoughts on that as as we get to the article of the week Japanese Yen we&#39;ve covered enough of that hedge funds boost bearish commodity bet uh you&#39;re seeing Comstock res resources start to rip the last few days from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm when hedge funds get this bearish on Commodities I I think they&#39;re probably opportunities in energy I think there a few\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\nquestions  there but uh for my money I I still like com stock is is the play uh commodity Cycles boom bus Cycles deviations from the trend so you can see here it&#39;s coming out of the lower Trend I did I want to uh it&#39;s coming out of a low and checking back just like it did th this this is a good framework model for what we&#39;re seeing you had this low and then a rally and then check back and then a multi-year rally and I think that&#39;s a reasonable framework and again that what does that point to is 2001 to 2007 I think it&#39;s a similar situation over and over we keep see seeing very strong similarity of all of these things uh no one&#39;s buying calls everyone bought puts in the holes therefore they had to get smoked and they did um thank you for playing try again uh election year seasonal pattern 1968 versus 2024 and the reason Jeff Hirsch is pointing this one is because LBJ left office and then you had a mid July correction uh ahead of the Democratic Convention and then you had the year end rally so this would imply that you don&#39;t get any major weakness in October meaning it&#39;s just straight up into the end of the year if if passes any prologue uh which is why you know only on things that we&#39;ve seen huge multi-baggers would we raise cash um certainly on the option side and then the underlying stock has to be up 50 75 100% And then um we&#39;ll see what things look like in mid-september is what I&#39;m trying to tell you there&#39;s a lot of different analogues we can follow the key is we&#39;re intermediate term bullish economy is good earnings are good 10.8% earnings growth versus 8.9% estimated uh 15.2% estimated for next year uh GDP now at 2.9% you know things are humming along biggest number one tail risk people are saying is a US recession that&#39;s If the Fed screws up which they&#39;re fully capable of doing but I think there&#39;s enough pressure and precedent and transparency now that I think they&#39;ve got to go in September and I think they&#39;ve got to talk doish in um I think I I think their best play is if they&#39;re being cautious talk like a crazy dove in Jackson Hole and then only give 25 basis points in September and then if you&#39;re wrong you can always go up to you can always uh move in November or you can go to like a 75 basis point in December and signal that in in in between and then the market will price it in ahead of time European relative to 12-month us forward PE this is pretty interesting so the European PE doing a lot of talking is um 35 to 40% lower than the USP and we&#39;re going to see and gxo earnings that demand in Europe and UK which is where most of their business is is exceeding the US they&#39;re seeing a little softness in the US but they&#39;re seeing a lot of strength in Europe and you can buy it at 30 to 40% lower which is why we have that UK play in serious position in gxo and a tiny position in Asos uh which we have yet to find a reason to make into a real position but we&#39;re keeping an eye on it um and looking for some more opportunities in Europe as well uh imig oh this is this is the chart I wanted to show you immigration adjusted unemployment rate is lower so remember this shot up to 4.3 but if you back out the aberrational immigration it&#39;s still down at 3.6 and this is the Delta between is are we going into a hard Landing with the Som rule or is this time different because of this immigration uh artificial immigration Spike um which leaves us at 3.6% and that&#39;s what you have to keep in mind uh be databased and be flexible inflation expectations basically down to 10year lows for three-year inflation expectations at what is it 2.3 uh Chinese government bond yields started going up that&#39;s very positive China goes to New extremes and Crackdown on bond market frenzy we want to see this go up up up along with equities um we&#39;ll cover that in the fund manager survey but basically you&#39;re seeing sentiment levels at the levels you see closer to Bottoms not closer to Tops which is positive um the gap between Mega cap Tech and others is shrinking profit growth for magnificent 7 starts slowing rest of S&P hits its stride we&#39;ve been talking about this for months now you can see it happening net income growth uh went from 50% now it&#39;s down to 25% and going lower uh S&amp;P magnificent 7 net income growth now starting to move to high single digits from being negative up until last quarter um feds featuring on earnings call like never before so that&#39;s becoming a major major issue just like it was uh back here it spiked in 2000 late 2008 when they\n\ninventory levels also we definitely started to see those return uh so from that low point of the end of last year I think that was really the inflection point for inventory levels across all regions definitely we&#39;re seeing inventory levels come back customers already starting I think to prepare for this year&#39;s holiday season sales have been strong sales pipelines really strong deal size is getting big bigger duration of contracts getting bigger um um Continental Europe UK we feel the business is very good trajectory of growth North America still a little bit uncertain but we do see the signs of an improving situation later in the year not least the fact we&#39;ve got the holiday season ahead of us this year&#39;s period will be better period for us than last year as far as it relates to the holiday season free cash flow blah blah blah as you would recall our cash flow Trends tend to be second half tilted every year so our guidance is reflecting that uh fear and greed index down to 26 up from 21 last week so there&#39;s still a lot of fear in the market which creates opportunity into that first cut and then uh economic data we covered the PPI and CPI were the big deals um you have uh the CPI today came in at 0 2% which was in line with expectations uh year on-ear came in at 2.9 versus estimates of 3.0 and last print was 3.0 so that was better than expected on CPI also better than expected on PPI at 2.2 versus 2.3 which is the leading indicator for CPI and month on Monon was 0.1 versus 0.2 all the other numbers don&#39;t matter uh earnings as we covered better than expected 10.8% versus 8.9 but the most important thing is guidance has been revised up by 1% since the beginning of January still holding in at 279 for next year so the podcast is over we&#39;re going to go into the\n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n\n###

I&#39;m with you on PayPal Baba vfc was wondering if you are maybe looking at w BD in light of a recent drop management is selling it as a turnaround but it seems to be a grind any thoughts uh I&#39;m not going to get involved in that we&#39;ve looked at that three or four times in the\n\nask me anything  question I don&#39;t like I mean zlov is pulling $40 million a year in salary and and destroying the company I think t\n\nask me anything question I don&#39;t like I mean zlov is pulling $40 million a year in salary and and destroying the company I think t here is\n\nI don&#39;t want to be evolved with it I think it&#39;s got too much debt I know it&#39;s got free cash flow it&#39;s just too hairy for me at the moment so I&#39;m going to pass um I&#39;m and and I don&#39;t want a correlation Disney I&#39;ve got a margin of safety cuz I got the parks I got everything else um so I&#39;m happy with Disney I don&#39;t need to play in the gutter with uh Warner Brothers if it works it&#39;ll be a triple quadruple if it doesn&#39;t you got goose egg not interested in that Disney if it&#39;s if it fails I&#39;m down 20% for a little while if it succeeds I&#39;m up double and my options are up three and 4x and that&#39;s uh highly probable so uh Jim Jones was wondering about com stock um yeah the reason the share count increased is because um Jerry Jones put up a lot of equity for the company to write out the shorter term Thing Once the free cash flow kicks on as natural gas prices they&#39;ll buy in the stock and it&#39;ll be back to the races I I still like it and that&#39;s basically what it was and uh and we&#39;re comfortable with that Conrad voy and that&#39;s very common in those e&amp;p companies also their share count expands and then it contracts once the cash flow spets go through the roof because they don&#39;t do so in a linear fashion they do so in a parabolic fashion and when the cash gushes they just buy in all that excess share count and it just goes to the moon um and it&#39;s trading not only nowhere near proved reserves it&#39;s trading nowhere near unproved reserves as well even at these depressed prices ### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\n Tomas student and listener from Germany this is from Conrad Voit thanks a lot for the great insights on your podcast you recently talked about small caps out performing over the next few months how did you design a potential trade on that Russ F or options do you have any specific stocks in mind yeah I got one it&#39;s called Cooper standard uh but you could buy the ETF which is iwm or others that are small cap exposure if you wanted to play it that way um we prefer individual small cap stocks JP ding uh people often ask about when you know when to leave a trade what about when you&#39;re too early I don&#39;t mind being too early I&#39;m probably too early on 3M but I&#39;m happy to ring the register I thought I might have been too early on Intel last year at 48 I think I was because it went to 51 and then it crashed down to 29 and then we just had this uh toaca last week which it went down to 18 or whatever it went to now it&#39;s back to 20 um uh and we and we rebuilt the position we sold it uh 48 so you know I I don&#39;t I know where I&#39;m getting out before I get in to 99% of the positions the only thing that would change my mind is if the fundamentals got so outstandingly better than than I anticipated uh um then uh then I would then I would consider staying in longer than I anticipated but that hasn&#39;t happened yet in 3M and that um I think long term it will but um but every now and then you got to ring the register you can&#39;t just ride everything up and back down and back up you got to you know hit the register and if it goes against you maybe rebuild the position and if it goes away from you like so what I made a multibagger on the options made a lot on the stock and on on on to the next um Cooper standard May 2022 look great but also looks like the stock won&#39;t meaningfully move until car volumes and free cash flow comes back meaningfully in second half 2025 so you just prioritize other opportunities and wait on putting new capital in CPS as it&#39;s likely to Flat down like when did you have the crystal ball like how do you know when volumes are coming back 6 months ago they thought volumes were going to be 161 now they&#39;re 158 how do you know 3 months from now they don&#39;t say 17 um um you know after the FED cuts and you get all these people rushing out for Christmas you just don&#39;t know is the answer to your question number one and number two they didn&#39;t elect cash pay on the debt versus pick because they&#39;re fearful that things are going to be going poorly uh these guys are dialed in and when they see what&#39;s happening with incentives and they see what&#39;s happened every other cycle they know what&#39;s going to happen to volumes and they have a better finger on the pulse than we do so I you know I don&#39;t care look I got I went through that byd trade that Charlie merer did that had like four 50 to 70% draw Downs before it went up like 12x in one year so he couldn&#39;t know when that was going to happen but it didn&#39;t matter because the kager over the 20 years was like 20s something 25% uh because he stayed in why because he didn&#39;t have leverage so if you&#39;re you know jumping around looking for the next beex headline and noise you&#39;re going to miss all these opportunities so for me no I&#39;ll just use the flat opportunity to to put more money to work when I&#39;m able to or just sit there patiently this is the business that you get paid for inactivity not activity the reason most people lose is because they have to jump around and chase the next shiny object and get their faces smacked the people who make money in this business are patient and probably golfers because they know how to just step away if they&#39;ve done the work and they know what they own um you know it was funny I was talking to a friend and I had a I had the worst round of uh since last year this weekend and you know the weekend before I had a great round uh qualifying for the Club Championship first round and uh and I was like kind of whining to a friend and he&#39;s like you know it&#39;s like you don&#39;t mind volatility in stocks why do you mind volatility in your scores so much I said because with stocks I&#39;m 100% certain of the underlying fundamentals I have no problem with that I know they&#39;re going to work out a golf I&#39;m you know probably 70% sure of my underlying fundamentals so uh so that&#39;s the that&#39;s the key difference here so the answer your question JP is you do what you want but I would never sell a share of that right now because I think it&#39;s going to take another year because when it goes it&#39;s just going to go overnight and you know you&#39;re going to wake up because you sold at 9 and it&#39;s 25 and then it&#39;s 50 and then it then you buy at 50 and it pulls back to 25 before it goes to 100 and you&#39;re just going to get it at all the wrong times 100% guaranteed Patrick K that&#39;s why you have a basket that&#39;s why we run a basket of 8 to 12 companies it&#39;s the same framework across the board some pop immediately in a year some Take 6 months some take two years some take three years some go against us before they turn some take longer than that but on balance we&#39;re going to get our doubles and double pluses over a couple of years and we&#39;re going to keep rinsing and repeating in Aggregate and the ones that take longer wind up making more in the long term and the ones that go faster wind up being shorter uh but if your framework is correct you will make money and you don&#39;t have to worry about this nonsense about timing and being impatient and everything else and if you&#39;re impatient go become an entrepreneur because entrepreneurs get get paid for activity you can you can take action every single minute of every single day and the more action you take the more money you&#39;re make in this business it&#39;s the exact opposite the more action you take the more the worst you&#39;re going to do until you absolutely blow up your account so um less action with a good framework is how fortunes are made over time and low leverage um Patrick K thanks for

I&#39;m actually comfortable with the derivative plays I&#39;m already got my exposure through gen and Stanley Black and Decker so I&#39;m good there um Ben Russo hi Tom thanks for all the information lessons you put out in part on the regular could you please take a look at AMR focuses BuyBacks and NVR all right let&#39;s see am r ah a minor why do you keep sending me these crappy miners all right so you want me to take a look at a stock that&#39;s up 450x and now you&#39;re interested I&#39;m going to tell you before anything I&#39;m not interested I I&#39;m not I don&#39;t even have to look at the numbers so number one based on this pick uh welcome to the podcast and I hope you will stick with us for many months ahead and you&#39;re going to learn how to um do a great job uh what the problem I see here Ben is that cash flow peaked two years ago it&#39;s collapsing revenues are rolling over uh return on Capital margins are rolling over I want nothing to do this is a stock that&#39;s up 400x and is rolling over on every single metric I mean this would be probably something to short to be honest with you but um I&#39;m not I I haven&#39;t done enough work number one to do that with conviction number two if I was going to short a particular stock I would never speak about it publicly and I&#39;m not going to short this stock so but I just say if I had to do something it wouldn&#39;t be long let&#39;s just put it that way uh but I need to do a lot more work either way but thank you for tuning in and what was the second one NVR you wanted me to look at a home builder all right so this has been a steady grower for a long time it&#39;s basically at new highs I I I just wait for this stuff to pull back um let&#39;s just take a look this is going to trade with all of them xhb what is the home builders doing right now yeah basically at new highs now if you didn&#39;t buy this in the hole in 2022 or 2020 just wait there&#39;s nothing to do with it play the ancillary plays that are in the hole from the dstock restock cycle like Stanley Black and&amp; Decker and gener is our view I I know gen&#39;s up almost double already and Stanley starting to take off but I think think you know these are basically getting going for a new cycle uh opinion on oxy Buffett loves it the name&#39;s near as average the name is not near as average because he did a warrant deal and everyone thinks he&#39;s buying all this stock what he&#39;s doing is converting warrants that he had at much lower prices so everyone&#39;s following him and buying the stock up um I just like comto right now if I find another Energy play I will let you guys know but there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s standing out for me yet um so\n\nuh what the problem I see here Ben is that cash flow peaked two years ago it's collapsing revenues are rolling over uh return on Capital margins are rolling over I want nothing to do this is a stock that's up 400x and is rolling over on every single

    "TECHNICAL_CHARTS": "\n\nquestions  there but uh for my money I I still like com stock is is the play uh commodity Cycles boom bus Cycles deviations from the trend so you can see here it&#39;s coming out of the lower Trend I did I want to uh it&#39;s coming out of a low and checking back just like it did th this this is a good framework model for what we&#39;re seeing you had this low and then a rally and then check back and then a multi-year rally and I think that&#39;s a reasonable framework and again that what does that point to is 2001 to 2007 I think it&#39;s a similar situation over and over we keep see seeing very strong similarity of all of these things uh no one&#39;s buying calls everyone bought puts in the holes therefore they had to get smoked and they did um thank you for playing try again uh election year seasonal pattern 1968 versus 2024 and the reason Jeff Hirsch is pointing this one is because LBJ left office and then you had a mid July correction uh ahead of the Democratic Convention and then you had the year end rally so this would imply that you don&#39;t get any major weakness in October meaning it&#39;s just straight up into the end of the year if if passes any prologue uh which is why you know only on things that we&#39;ve seen huge multi-baggers would we raise cash um certainly on the option side and then the underlying stock has to be up 50 75 100% And then um we&#39;ll see what things look like in mid-september is what I&#39;m trying to tell you there&#39;s a lot of different analogues we can follow the key is we&#39;re intermediate term bullish economy is good earnings are good 10.8% earnings growth versus 8.9% estimated uh 15.2% estimated for next year uh GDP now at 2.9% you know things are humming along biggest number one tail risk people are saying is a US recession that&#39;s If the Fed screws up which they&#39;re fully capable of doing but I think there&#39;s enough pressure and precedent and transparency now that I think they&#39;ve got to go in September and I think they&#39;ve got to talk doish in um I think I I think their best play is if they&#39;re being cautious talk like a crazy dove in Jackson Hole and then only give 25 basis points in September and then if you&#39;re wrong you can always go up to you can always uh move in November or you can go to like a 75 basis point in December and signal that in in in between and then the market will price it in ahead of time European relative to 12-month us forward PE this is pretty interesting so the European PE doing a lot of talking is um 35 to 40% lower than the USP and we&#39;re going to see and gxo earnings that demand in Europe and UK which is where most of their business is is exceeding the US they&#39;re seeing a little softness in the US but they&#39;re seeing a lot of strength in Europe and you can buy it at 30 to 40% lower which is why we have that UK play in serious position in gxo and a tiny position in Asos uh which we have yet to find a reason to make into a real position but we&#39;re keeping an eye on it um and looking for some more opportunities in Europe as well uh imig oh this is this is the chart I wanted to show you immigration adjusted unemployment rate is lower so remember this shot up to 4.3 but if you back out the aberrational immigration it&#39;s still down at 3.6 and this is the Delta between is are we going into a hard Landing with the Som rule or is this time different because of this immigration uh artificial immigration Spike um which leaves us at 3.6% and that&#39;s what you have to keep in mind uh be databased and be flexible inflation expectations basically down to 10year lows for three-year inflation expectations at what is it 2.3 uh Chinese government bond yields started going up that&#39;s very positive China goes to New extremes and Crackdown on bond market frenzy we want to see this go up up up along with equities um we&#39;ll cover that in the fund manager survey but basically you&#39;re seeing sentiment levels at the levels you see closer to Bottoms not closer to Tops which is positive um the gap between Mega cap Tech and others is shrinking profit growth for magnificent 7 starts slowing rest of S&P hits its stride we&#39;ve been talking about this for months now you can see it happening net income growth uh went from 50% now it&#39;s down to 25% and going lower uh S&amp;P magnificent 7 net income growth now starting to move to high single digits from being negative up until last quarter um feds featuring on earnings call like never before so that&#39;s becoming a major major issue just like it was uh back here it spiked in 2000 late 2008 when they",
    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\ne and UK which is where most of their business is is exceeding the US they&#39;re seeing a little softness in the US but they&#39;re seeing a lot of strength in Europe and you can buy it at 30 to 40% lower which is why we have that UK play in serious position in gxo and a tiny position in Asos uh which we have yet to find a reason to make into a real position but we&#39;re keeping an eye on it um and looking for some more opportunities in Europe as well uh imig oh this is this is the chart I wanted to show you immigration adjusted unemployment rate is lower so remember this shot up to 4.3 but if you back out the aberrational immigration it&#39;s still down at 3.6 and this is the Delta between is are we going into a hard Landing with the Som rule or is this time different because of this immigration uh artificial immigration Spike um which leaves us at 3.6% and that&#39;s what you have to keep in mind uh be databased and be flexible inflation expectations basically down to 10year lows for three-year inflation expectations at what is it 2.3 uh Chinese government bond yields started going up that&#39;s very positive China goes to New extremes and Crackdown on bond market frenzy we want to see this go up up up along with equities um we&#39;ll cover that in the fund manager survey but basically you&#39;re seeing sentiment levels at the levels you see closer to Bottoms not closer to Tops which is positive um the gap between Mega cap Tech and others is shrinking profit growth for magnificent 7 starts slowing rest of S&amp;P hits its stride we&#39;ve been talking about this for months now you can see it happening net income growth uh went from 50% now it&#39;s down to 25% and going lower uh S&amp;P magnificent 7 net income growth now starting to move to high single digits from being negative up until last quarter um feds featuring on earnings call like never before so that&#39;s becoming a major major issue just like it was uh back here it spiked in 2000 late 2008 when they finally  started cutting investor sector allocation so they&#39;ve gone into defensives Pharma and they&#39;re out of discretionary there&#39;ll be some opportunities to pick up there you saw it in Starbucks by the way we&#39;ve talked on it the reason we didn&#39;t get involved in Starbucks uh or Nike yet and we continue to keep our eye we&#39;ll probably miss it with Nike you&#39;re going to you&#39;re going to wake up and there&#39;ll be an activist in Nike and we&#39;ll miss it uh is and Lulu for that matter maybe we&#39;ll get one of them it&#39;s just a question of what do we want to sell well you know we did take off at 3M today so maybe there&#39;ll be a new spot in the portfolio um was just because they had meaningful China exposure and we have a meaningful China exposure through Baba so we didn&#39;t want to have a high correlated trade um but we&#39;re going to be open-minded because there&#39;s there&#39;s certainly opportunity there the other thing I thought was silly was Nelson Pelt uh I don&#39;t know what&#39;s happened to him since Ed Gardner left but he&#39;s become like a day trader like Disney spiked up and the guy sold it partially because they didn&#39;t let him on the board then he gets in Starbucks it spikes up 20% and he sells it are you telling me you put billion dollars in a billions of dollars in a position to make a 20% gain are you like a day trader like why would you ever take that big of a position for a 20% move like it makes zero sense to me so I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s going on over there but after Starbucks biked he got out which tells me his level of confidence in the position which also tells me maybe there&#39;ll be another chance to get in but I think that&#39;s going to be a harder ship to correct they couldn&#39;t have picked a better guy to do it than the guy from Chipotle but I think it&#39;ll take some time and after the honeymoon is over um maybe there&#39;ll be new opportunity but I I I really don&#39;t want to compete with luckan in China so for me uh certainly with the last CEO it was an absolute no uh with the new CEO it&#39;s a maybe but uh I&#39;m not paying up for it so we&#39;ll keep an eye on that one lower uh bond yield expectations back to 2023 highs so this the last time they had the lower bond yield expectations at this level was November 2008 which started a huge cutting cycle expectations for lower short rates highest on record going back to March 2020 which was the bottom of the market as well PPI we we saw vix has rolled over uh recent immigrants labor force share has risen sharply and their unemployment rate has also trended upward which is skewed the overall which is what we were talking about on the ear earlier part we estimate that net IM immigration into the US reached 2.9 Million people in 2023 1.9 million above the pre pandemic Trend will slow to 2.2 million in 2024 uh this is the percent of companies with positive 12mth percent changes in forward earnings this is not the stuff you see at the end of a cycle ladies and gentlemen this looks exactly like the previous Cycles you get the huge Spike off the lows after the recession you should have a recession line here in 2022 cuz we two quarters of negative GDP growth and then it rolls over and then you start the recovery rolls over start the recovery rolls over starts to recovery uh or in the case of 2009 rolls you know Spike off the low then a check back and then you continue higher Spike off the low check back continue higher but that&#39;s what we&#39;re seeing right now this is not what we see at tops is all I&#39;m trying to communicate with you ### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nthat&#39;s the seasonal pattern some updates on the

everyone&#39;s worried about the park slowing down for a couple of quarters they released a whole bunch of new stuff over the weekend which we&#39;ll talk about um but the big story if you remember most of the reason we got in parks are great highest return on invested capital but value Act is the activist in this stock and value act turned around Salesforce it turned around um New York Times if they could turn around New York Times they could turn around anything they made New York Times profitable they turned around [Music] um Spotify so those were the three Salesforce New York Times Spotify and they did it all through pricing bundles and increasing the prices and as you saw which the market didn&#39;t respond to they raised the prices right before earnings and they&#39;re going to add the ES SPN to all the bundles all that business is being valued at zero right now it&#39;s got 153 million subscribers on the Disney Plus Part alone leaving aside ESPN which is the number one franchise in sports gaining share not losing share and they&#39;re going to monetize that through streaming uh and so if it&#39;s half what what Netflix is Netflix is valued at you know 300 billion um for you know 277 million subscribers they&#39;ve probably got 200 across platforms they&#39;re valued at zero I&#39;m I&#39;m going to take a wild and crazy bet that it&#39;s worth more than zero Disney plus Wolverine uh inside out to both billion dollar franchises theatrical releases Disney Hulu all that stuff and um let&#39;s just assume it&#39;s not worth half of uh Netflix let&#39;s assume

turning around Intel stock may have bottomed at tangible Book value that&#39;s from uh we posted over the weekend from Barons why am I not signed in here and tangible Book value just for you guys that are new to this uh is basically what you get when they liquidate the whole company uh so you&#39;re basically trading at liquidation value uh I like opportunities like that where your downside is is uh uh covered and your upside is unlimited and uh we like this story so we covered it last week we did about an hour and a half on it go back to that podcast and listen if you&#39;re interested why why buffets dumped 55.8% of its Apple stock well I one reason could be that uh it&#39;s historically traded at a 14 times multiple now it was at a 28 to 30 times multiple oh and by the way the earnings growth expectations have haved so you&#39;re paying you know twice as much for half the growth other than that how is the play Mrs Lincoln from villains to Indiana Jones everything we learned at Disney&#39;s Parks panel 2024 d23 Expo that&#39;s a mouthful uh so they&#39;re going to do a villain land coming to the Magic Kingdom uh for all the evildoers out there that like to uh go to villain parks with their kids uh have at it uh they&#39;re doing uh more cruise ships they&#39;re you know they&#39;re they&#39;re basically laying out all the things that they&#39;re going to invest in and how it&#39;s going to be great and they&#39;re not asleep at the wheel and we know all that stuff China goes to otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be owners China goes to New extreme and crack down on B market friendsy go after it it&#39;s time you get off your butt and you know turn this ship around Baxter to sell its Kidney Care business so they got four bli $3.8 billion going to use 3 billion to cut down the um uh to sell off their debt they were originally going to spend that to us that&#39;s a low growth business so uh the fact that they&#39;re getting rid of it number one I don&#39;t know if we would have hung off hung on to that spin-off to be honest with you the the kidney dialysis business uh we usually really like spin-offs like svent so I&#39;m glad they sold it they&#39;ll take the debt down by 3 billion which is going to take down their interest cost oh and by the way because they don&#39;t have the slow growth of the kidney business they multiples is going to get rated from 10 to a normalized 15 uh over the next few months and their free cash flow is going to go up because they have less uh interest payments for Debt Service and they&#39;ve got a lean mean money-making machine so we like this we&#39;re very excited no change in Outlook uh and there you go uh stock down 54% is it time to buy the dip on this growth stock which is gxo logistics uh amen baby you preaching to the choir we&#39;re going to talk about that one in the article of the week alibaba&#39;s lazzada post first monthly profit amid intense competition in Southeast Asia so they turn that profit around from losing money to making money how China just like they did with fipo uh how China stocks could break out of the value trap so this guy put out this chart which shows the csi300 versus estimated EPs and what he&#39;s basically saying is every time it got this extreme you got a huge rally in equities we know the story it&#39;s time China expects air travel to hit a

JP Morgan last week on Madison Avenue and what was exciting about this is there wasn&#39;t anything new other than the fact um that they talked about what they&#39;re seeing in terms of incentives in the market picking up and that they&#39;ve been following this for decades cuz all these guys are lifelong Auto industry people and you know I have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in in my work and they have indicators that are pretty much guarantees in their work and one of their indicators is when incentives from dealers and manufacturers start ticking up volumes quickly follow and I&#39;m going to explain how that&#39;s counterintuitive in just a minute but let&#39;s go to this chart to start with\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nCooper standard did $722 a share in earnings in earnings the stock traded at $146 so you basically had a 20 times multiple on that earnings power let me move ahead here last week we went into detail on Cooper standard earnings outlooks and Prospects moving forward as well as our original thesis from May 20222 when we initiated the position around $5.50 a share you can find it here so click there and read the whole thing and then click on the link in that article that goes to our old articles from May of 2022 one concept I wanted to point out is that since 1980 every single cycle has peaked out at 18 million SAR expectations for 2024 were that the industry would do 16.1 million this year it has since been revised down to 15.8 million so here&#39;s 18 million we&#39;re at 158 this is 18 158 18 158 18 now look at the last cycle 2005 it peaked actually above 20 but it was you know 18 for some time at the top of the cycle it stays up at 18 for a few years before it rolls over okay so it was at 18 from you know 2006 to 2004 to 2006 basically then the previous cycle before that was the late 90s it got up over 18 in 1999 then the previous cycle before that it got over got again peaked over 20 actually but mostly over 18 in like 1987 and 1986 and they also all trough below 10 million in 1981 it trough below 10 million in 2008 it trough below 10 million in 2020 it trough below 10 million it&#39;s mind bogging considering how much the population has grown leaving that aside if we know that it&#39;s going to 18 million for shizel as Snoop Dog the Olympic MC would say then we know that what can the question is if we know what the industry volume is is going to be whether it&#39;s two years out or four years out then we can back into what can Cooper standard earn on that and then what will the market pay for it so you could say well that&#39;s very easy well if they did $18 million in 2017 and they earned $7.20 then the stock could be $140 again or maybe if it doesn&#39;t get a 20 times multiple maybe it gets a 10 times multiple it could be $70 again well that&#39;s good we bought it at $550 it&#39;s at $13 any new money that comes in we&#39;re buying a ton at 122 and $13 we&#39;re we&#39;re super happy to add at the these levels super cheap now now one of the key factors which is a leading indicator of volumes is incentives offered in recent years the oems have experienced the housian days of controlling supplies and selling above MSRP with a wink and a nod all the oems followed suit until now as inventories build partially due to the artificial EV push that was not met with natural demand incentives are starting to accelerate meaning there&#39;s cards on the Lots they got to move them this is the key leading indicator of increasing volumes to come to the lay person one would think that they are increasing incentives because no one wants to buy cars therefore volumes will fall the opposite is true the high rates high prices and low supply has led to pent up Demand with average car on the road now over 13 years old which is a record high the Korean manufacturers will continue to ramp cost ramp lower cost Alternatives forcing the US and Japan oems to follow suit and offer incentives to move their current inventories take a look at this chart this is the average age by vehicle type you can see here Passenger cars at 14 years old light trucked at 12 years old combined at 12.6 years this will hurt OEM margins GM Ford Stanis Toyota Motor Corp so to make up the profit they will have to produce more volume to meet profitability goals if they hold out for Price meaning they they&#39;re unwilling to cut they will lose meaningful share the race to the bottom will be on this is good news for the consumer good for auto suppliers that benefit from volumes and less so for oems we don&#39;t own any oems our play is for volume through Cooper standard so what could this actually mean for Cooper standard forget about what it means when production peaked Peaks at 18 million seever several years out like every cycle for the last 45 years just a move from 15.8 million SAR where we are now to 16.1 million will have a massive impact to earnings per share due to CPS operating leverage we estimate that another 300,000 cars could yield $50 million straight to the bottom line that&#39;s on 17 million shares so um that given how efficient efficiently CPS is now running that implies $3 a share in earnings approximately $3 a share in earnings as a friendly reminder when Cooper standard was bloated and running inefficiently in 2017 the stock traded up to $146 a share on $7 a share of earnings per share at 20 times multiple historically when profitable CPS is traded between a trough multiple of 10 times and a peak multiple of 20 times so if we can go just to 16.1 million SAR and earn $3 a share at 10 to 20 * multiple 3 * EPS * 10 or 20 * multiple equals $30 to $60 per share price what could the business do on a peak SAR of $18 million a few years out the answer is a lot more than it did on 18 million SAR in 2017 because the margins are better and the cost structure is rationalized an assumption of $3 a share for every 300,000 additional SAR after 16.1 million might be too optimistic but what if we cut C that in half I don&#39;t think it&#39;s tooo optimistic but let&#39;s just cut it in half $11.50 more EPS per 300,000 cars from 16.1 million to18 million equals 6.33 * 1.5 = $99.50 a share EPS plus the $3 from 15.8 to 16.1 equals $12.50 a share EPS or 75% more earnings power than when it traded at $146 a share there are no guarantees in anything there&#39;s always always execution risk Market risk unknown risk Etc hedge fund tips opinions not advice C terms\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nBank of America fund manager survey update on Wednesday we put

summary here number number one most the most number of survey participants in 16 years believe monetary policy is too restrictive the last few peaks in this level of too restrictive belief marked at or near bottoms to buy cyclical small cap dividend payers and international stocks with the FED funds rate greater than 200 basis points above inflation we concur with this point of view so here our manager saying you&#39;re too restrictive and what happened after each instance number one the market bottomed and number two the FED kite number two sentiment is climbing the wall of worry but not at extreme so this is not the type of sentiment you see at tops it&#39;s more like the sentiment you see near bottoms utilities exposure has skyrocketed to 1.4 standard deviations above its long-term average you remember last year we were pounding the table by by um by utilities when no one wanted them they&#39;re up 50% now everyone wants them I think it&#39;s probably sold to U time long magnificent 7 is still the most crowded trade despite a recent 18% correction so there&#39;s probably a little bit more pain there from uh uh from some spots managers Outlook pessimism on the economy mirrors levels you see near Market bottoms versus Market tops investors who see stronger global economy in the next 12 months this is what you saw in 2009 huge rally this is what you saw at the 2020 lows huge rally\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\ngxo Logistics update here were the highlights they had 19% Revenue year-over-year but that was because they closed the winon acquisition in the UK they&#39;re going to have $50 million of synergies out of that one 2% or organic Revenue growth 270 million in new business wins sales pipel increased to 12-month high of 2.3 billion on track to sign up a record amount of new business this year uh sequential Improvement in organic revenue and strong free cash flow reaffirm their guidance and strengthening consumer demand in the UK which is 50% they generated 115 million of cash flow from operation compared to 61 million year on-year and 31 million of free cash flow compared to 3 million they&#39;re guiding at 30 to 40% free cash flow conversion uh on 800 and call it 20 million adjusted eidos so call it 300 million of free cash flow backend loaded which is usually in line with their seasonality also in line with what they&#39;re seeing uh regarding inventory levels for the holiday season which are much better than last year which was disappointing the restock cycle has begun uh they did adjusted eida of 187 million this quarter and operating cash flow of5 million you can see that you can see the recent winds and expansions from Levis is a big deal in Germany uh they&#39;re getting some of the Industrials now rathon in UK Boeing carfor uh wh Smith trindall Etc and then their wins came from 21 from competitors 32% new activity from existing and 47% came from uh clients that were Outsourcing their supply chain management and Logistics Outsourcing to gxo which is a trend why because your margins increase when you Outsource that business and uh and that&#39;s a good thing for earnings and that&#39;s a good thing for uh CEO stock options and they all want to do it and that trend is going to accelerate in coming years\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nCPI today came in at 0 2% which was in line with expectations uh year on-ear came in at 2.9 versus estimates of 3.0 and last print was 3.0 so that was better than expected on CPI also better than expected on PPI at 2.2 versus 2.3 which is the leading indicator for CPI and month on Monon was 0.1 versus 0.2 all the other numbers don&#39;t matter uh earnings as we covered better than expected 10.8% versus 8.9 but the most important thing is guidance has been revised up by 1% since the beginning of January still holding in at 279 for next year"

compared to our lower chain scales that&#39;s more in line with the narrative uh MGM which is casinos majority of our customers the middle end to high end are still pretty strong still visiting quite a bit the lower end of the database has seen a bit of softening Proctor and Gamble makes tide so from a consumer standpoint we generally don&#39;t see the dynamic of consumer pressure that some are describing if you look at a couple Dynamics private label shares as an example which typically would be increasing during the time of significant consumer pressure that&#39;s not what we&#39;re seeing fascinating okay uh Matt Ser minaro from fundstrat says a peak and put call has led to immediate term intermediate term lows and equities that&#39;s what we saw early this month so now where&#39;re fits and starts working back up just like we saw uh in past instances high yield credit spread yields blew out they&#39;re now coming back in so that&#39;s positive Market are again pricing more fed Cuts in the next 12 months uh we find we find no evidence that hurricane Barrel in Texas contributed to the rise in temporary layoffs but summer Auto Plant retooling shutdowns might have contributed so what they&#39;re trying to say is that the labor market is not cracking yet and Claudia s of the s r has been saying similar stuff she&#39;s saying pay attention this might time might be different but you got to act soon is effective what she&#39;s saying so maybe it&#39;s the auto retooling and maybe it&#39;s also the immigration which we&#39;re going to see some data on here uh other indicators suggest layoffs remain low Bank of America credit and debit card spending per household decreased by 410 of 1% year onye in July so there&#39;s some weakness there okay we did the inflation it&#39;s been the second longest manufacturing recession in history so I could see a situation where you have some softening for a little bit while Manu you know manufacturing has been in a recession and we did have that technical recession two quarters of negative GDP growth in uh first and second quarter of 2022 they just didn&#39;t label it as a recession it&#39;s like a double dis dip recession just like we had during the vulka era and then we had 18 years of prosperity um I could see a situation where manufacturing starts to re accelerate and that kind of offsets a a customer that&#39;s taking a breather a consumer that&#39;s taking a breather although we&#39;re going to see from gxo earnings that uh the Christmas holiday season based on stocks seem to be looking certainly better than last year and more normalized so I wouldn&#39;t count out you know what I always say is don&#39;t count out the US consumer if they have a job and the question is whether they have jobs and and that&#39;s going to be a question of whether you believe the most recent jobs report was what to expect Pro moving forward which means we are weakening dramatically or if it was a oneof from Auto retooling and from uh the immigration Spike number of immigrant visas has continued to rise you can see it there household debt outstanding as a share of GDP is down over the past decade so the consumer has deleveraged tremendously since 2009 household balance sheet still in good shape Financial Obligations relative to incomes are staying low by historical standards hasn&#39;t been this low since the 60s maybe uh this chart only goes back to 1983 so that&#39;s positive uh personal bankruptcy filing rates are hovering over multi-decade lows so you know you see a lot of people showing these two-year charts and it&#39;s like oh they&#39;re going through the the roof but if you go back you know 50 years they&#39;re way below normal average share loans and foreclosure remains very low at 46% housing affordability index remains at record lows this is uh the worst it&#39;s been since the vulker vulker era uh economic surprise index City Group economic surprise index turning up this is a key one the election year seasonality is kind of going according to plan here so far uh we did have that correction in Late July early August and then it should bode well for strength into mid-september and that&#39;s right around the first fed cut which historically has been sell the first cut weakness into the end of October just before the election and then year end rally I I think that&#39;s going to be the model now you know can it be that easy the answer is no but it&#39;s a good framework and then you adapt based on how things play out in in real time but uh that&#39;s our base case at the moment uh you could see how extreme things got here at macro charts off his core risk model and bouncing off those lows do we go retest those I don&#39;t know if we do or we don&#39;t but um uh that was that money market assets these as rates come down once you get the first cut a good slug of these have to come back into the market just like they did in 2020 you know half a half a trillion dollars came into the market pretty quickly once they back stop the corporate credit Market uh I think the same will be true once you get your first one or two cuts we get probably a half a trillion in for year end into equities as people lose out on short rates coming down this is going to be the most important chart we covered today with uh Us sell through on uh Auto Autos uh pretty excited about that I went to see Cooper standard at JP Morgan last Thursday and um saw the presentation talked with uh with the people and um I&#39;ll share some some um thoughts on that as as we get to the article of the week Japanese Yen we&#39;ve covered enough of that hedge funds boost bearish commodity bet uh you&#39;re seeing Comstock res resources start to rip the last few days from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm when hedge funds get this bearish on Commodities I I think they&#39;re probably opportunities in energy I think there a few",
      "jobs report last week uh also an update we&#39;ve had a huge run in 3M huge run in the stock multibagger in the options and option spreads we took profits uh we do think this this business is going to go higher over time but it was a lot of money in a short period of time and every now and then you got to ring the register we would love to re-enter this at lower levels we do not know whether that opportunity will present itself or not not but um we are for the time being holding on to the svent spin-off uh and may take a look at adding to that as well but uh this was a win and as you can see you know this took a whole year plus to build this base and then when it took off it took off and doubled off the bottoms and um between the stock and options was was very worthwhile so we&#39;re happy with that uh and you know like Intel like we did last year went from 25 to 48 we took off 2/3 we readded we bought more down after uh earnings last week a lot more down brought our basis down I think now our basis is down to 23 bucks uh so uh maybe we&#39;ll get an opportunity to do that in 3M but if not it was a good ride thank you very much ring the register",
      "the things that have reached close to our targets or we&#39;ve made a ton of money on in a reasonable amount of time like the 3M Etc we&#39;re going to we&#39;re going to hit the register on some of that stuff uh Global risk demand has recently Fallen Shar sharply into extreme fear territory so again these are periods of opportunity uh motor vehicle loans okay owned incur is okay relative multiple suggests that small caps could outperform large caps over the next 10 years you think yes it&#39;s time back to the 2001 to 2007 period and everyone lining up um Prime of strip So This Is Us prime rate in real terms minus small business funding rates is the highest in 20 years uh and the implication is that they need to cut a lot more than the FED thinks we&#39;ll see uh there are a lot of exceptions right now because of what happened with Co a once in 100 Year event but uh certainly keeping an eye on all of this stuff and not being a Cassandra and not being a primadonna either but just dealing with the data on a day-to-day week- toe basis you can see the 10-day gauge hit Japanese volatility was the highest since the great financial crisis and since they blew up in the late 80s uh Japanese money supply rolling over China&#39;s CPI is going up that&#39;s a sign of recovery so pay close attention to that you saw the same thing off the 2016 lows and a straight up rally uh to 201819 and then the same thing um the 2020 bottoms straight up into beginning of 2022 bottomed early 2024 and now is working higher that&#39;s a big thing that you want to see inflation going up you want to see the Yuan start to strengthen and you want to start to see bond yields going up all of those are coincident with Equity starting to rip in China and all of those are lining up with uh Stronger Yen outflows from Japan which was hot money from China Etc PPI confirmed the CPI in China worst outflow from bank loans since March of 2020 that was uh uh during the carry trade on wine this talks about Chinese uh out producing in terms of getting nuclear energy capacity that&#39;s a big deal um BuyBacks by corporate clients are nearing 2019 highs so that&#39;s a back stop supported for the markets which which should be part of the reason for the August early September strength is the blackout periods are over earnings are out and now companies can buy back stocks with their cash hordes balance sheets are good and so on moving right along midcap etf&#39;s recent buy buying spree after selling Spate so the money the money is starting to come back into mids it will follow into Falls um this is just a reiteration of Charles&#39;s data 5% pullbacks occur more than three times a year on average 10% pullbacks occur one times a year on average 15% Corrections occur every other year on average 20% pullbacks occur every 3 to four years and as I said we&#39;ve had two in four years so we&#39;re kind of fronted loaded and we should have some smoother sailing for a little while prospectively Wake Me Up When September end so we should see this strength in sept ear August to early September I think it&#39;s going to be and actually going to be the sell the first hike uh also that will be supported by um uh election uncertainties so I think you know as you get into I think it&#39;s September 17th if you have strength and a lot of profits it&#39;s time to book some maybe put on some tactical shorts and then uh mid mid October late October because of the election you can probably start to buy stuff in the hole and ride the um the money machine into year end year end rally industrial inventory cycle Illinois&#39;s toolworks this is earnings quotes from their calls destocking which was a headwind all of last year is no longer a significant Factor at this point we&#39;re going to hear from uh um gxo on that as well uh Johnson Controls overall I think that for the most part the large destocking is behind us guys this is the whole theme of our portfolio destock to restock whether it&#39;s standle whether even whether it&#39;s Intel whether it&#39;s um gener whether it&#39;s it whether even it was uh 3M by the way and 3M probably has a lot more juice

can see it there household debt outstanding as a share of GDP is down over the past decade so the consumer has deleveraged tremendously since 2009 household balance sheet still in good shape Financial Obligations relative to incomes are staying low by historical standards hasn&#39;t been this low since the 60s maybe uh this chart only goes back to 1983 so that&#39;s positive uh personal bankruptcy filing rates are hovering over multi-decade lows so you know you see a lot of people showing these two-year charts and it&#39;s like oh they&#39;re going through the the roof but if you go back you know 50 years they&#39;re way below normal average share loans and foreclosure remains very low at 46% housing affordability index remains at record lows this is uh the worst it&#39;s been since the vulker vulker era uh economic surprise index City Group economic surprise index turning up this is a key one the election year seasonality is kind of going according to plan here so far uh we did have that correction in Late July early August and then it should bode well for strength into mid-september and that&#39;s right around the first fed cut which historically has been sell the first cut weakness into the end of October just before the election and then year end rally I I think that&#39;s going to be the model now you know can it be that easy the answer is no but it&#39;s a good framework and then you adapt based on how things play out in in real time but uh that&#39;s our base case at the moment uh you could see how extreme things got here at macro charts off his core risk model and bouncing off those lows do we go retest those I don&#39;t know if we do or we don&#39;t but um uh that was that money market assets these as rates come down once you get the first cut a good slug of these have to come back into the market just like they did in 2020 you know half a half a trillion dollars came into the market pretty quickly once they back stop the corporate credit Market uh I think the same will be true once you get your first one or two cuts we get probably a half a trillion in for year end into equities as people lose out on short rates coming down this is going to be the most important chart we covered today with uh Us sell through on uh Auto Autos uh pretty excited about that I went to see Cooper standard at JP Morgan last Thursday and um saw the presentation talked with uh with the people and um I&#39;ll share some some um thoughts on that as as we get to the article of the week Japanese Yen we&#39;ve covered enough of that hedge funds boost bearish commodity bet uh you&#39;re seeing Comstock res resources start to rip the last few days from 8 to $10 uh I love when when Comm when hedge funds get this bearish on Commodities I I think they&#39;re
