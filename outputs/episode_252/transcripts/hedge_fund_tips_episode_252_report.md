## Featured Company Deep Dives
### Cooper Standard – High. Hayes emphasizes the company's strong position and the predictable nature of auto cycles. Conviction
Cooper Standard is poised to benefit from the recovery in auto production volumes. As incentives increase and pent-up demand is released, Cooper Standard's earnings will increase significantly due to operating leverage. The company is currently undervalued, trading at a low multiple of its potential earnings.

**Key Metrics:**
- Auto production volumes (SAR).
- Incentives offered by OEMs.
- Average age of vehicles on the road.
- Earnings per share (EPS).

**Valuation / Target:** $30 to $60 per share based on 16.1 million SAR, significantly higher with peak SAR of 18 million.
**Action:** Buy. Hayes is adding to the position at $12-13, considering it super cheap.

### GXO Logistics – High. Hayes highlights the company's strong performance and positive trends. Conviction
GXO Logistics is benefiting from the restock cycle and the trend of companies outsourcing their supply chain management. The company is experiencing strong revenue growth, new business wins, and improved free cash flow. Demand is particularly strong in Europe and the UK.

**Key Metrics:**
- Revenue growth.
- New business wins.
- Free cash flow.
- Organic revenue growth.
- Sales pipeline.

**Valuation / Target:** Not explicitly stated, but implied upside based on growth and free cash flow conversion.
**Action:** Buy. Hayes is very excited about the stock, considering it a growth stock trading at a discount.

### Disney – High. Hayes believes the stock is significantly undervalued and has substantial upside. Conviction
Disney is undervalued based on the sum of its parts, with the parks and streaming businesses having significant potential. The market is currently valuing Disney Plus and ESPN at zero, which is unrealistic. Value Act's involvement as an activist investor is a positive catalyst.

**Key Metrics:**
- EBIT from parks and experiences.
- Subscribers on Disney Plus and ESPN.
- Theatrical releases performance.
- Streaming prices.

**Valuation / Target:** $150 to $200 over the next few years.
