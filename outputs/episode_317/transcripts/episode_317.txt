Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom Hayes. I'm Tom Hayes and this is your 317th videocast podcast for the week ending November 11th, 2025. We're a couple days early live from Edinburg. Uh better a couple days early than one day late. Uh I was always taught. So, uh we're going to get right down to it. Uh family first. Uh the only news there this week is Annabelle started at her new school after the move first day yesterday. She loves it. So, super happy to hear back on that. Uh, this was Mornings with Maria Friday. There's uh John Lansky and Cheryl Cason, regulars on Mornings with Maria. That was my first time. Very exciting. There's a little background studio so you guys can see what it looks like behind the scenes. Uh, and then there's uh Bryant Park right outside my place that never gets old with the uh ice skating rink in the winter. And then uh in London, landed in London on Saturday. Had a chance to meet I put out on the podcast last Thursday. Hey, I'm going to be in London. And uh five guys showed up and another one the next day. Um we've got uh David, Patty, Nick, Ed, Tino. Uh we had a great lunch together. Strong supporters of the podcast have told all their friends and family. Some listening just a few weeks like David. Some listening a few years like Nick. Uh and uh just a great time. Should have brought my sticks. Uh a couple of these guys could get me on some nice tracks, but next time Sunnydale, we will do it. Um so that was that. And then Eduardo came the next day. Don't have a picture with him. So uh a couple pictures from London. Always great to be back in London. And that was my way onto German Street to do my annual shopping and get caught up on uh shoes and shirts and turnbull and uh uh ties and the whole thing. This was Scott's restaurant. If you get a chance to go there for seafood, it's phenomenal. That was the entire octopus there on the middle. Um that was uh Leit Le Petit Maison, the classic vanilla creme brulee. Um, classic telephone booth there in London in front of Ralph Lauren. There's Bond Street. And I would suggest if you get to London uh at Scots, get the seared sea bass, the scallops on the shell and le petite maison, the esargo, the grilled lango, and obviously the creme brulee. Highly recommended. Uh then that was um uh after German Street, Savile Row, Bond Street, we I went to the B battery power station which just shows the power of innovation. This was an old energy plant. You can see these smoke stacks here. They turned it into a complete huge development with uh residential and a lot of um shops and so on. A huge mall. There's Harrods. Uh that's the Lotus dealer around the corner from the Mayfair where I stayed. Here is that power station inside. You can see all the stores. I stopped in Lulu to do some channel checks. I'm still not convinced on that. I'm trying to trying to convince myself that it's not the next Under Arour or Gap uh which uh those of you are a little older know the story of GAP was the hottest thing since sliced bread jrew. You know that that what I love so much about VF Corp relative to Lulu is there's a lot of outs. They have multiple brands. They trade in and out of portfolios with something that hasn't been around through cycles like a Vans, like a Nike. Nike is always going to come back. Um uh as a matter of fact, I got to confess, I bought a pair of Nikes doing a little due diligence uh and uh I have enough Vans. But um uh anyway, here here, you know, if you look at Under Armour, they had the most innovative new clothing. They kind of designed the um breathe right stuff where, you know, it's kind of super light fabric versus cotton. And they had a huge run. The founder stepped down, completely collapsed, never recovered since. As a matter of fact, they had an Under Armour store in the uh Batter Sea Power Station, completely empty. Um, Lulu wasn't totally empty. There were a few people in there. I bought some stuff there. I needed some workout clothes. I just wanted to see what it's like. Um, but you know, Gap had the same run. J Crew had the same run and they were just left for dead. Under Armour left for dead. I don't think that will be the case with Lulu, but I'm just not certain. I continue to look at the financials. I continue to say, "Why am I not buying the stock?" and and sometimes there's something just in the back of your head holding you back from doing it. Uh I'll probably be wrong on that and it'll probably work, but um there's a risk in clothing and apparel and stuff if a brand hasn't been around forever. Um and sometimes even if it has uh and especially when you have one bet, it's not multiple bets. I mean, at least gap hedged with Old Navy and and that type of thing. So, Lulu, the jury is still out, but uh it continues to be on front of top of mind. And that's that there. And I think uh we got some stuff from Edinburg. Just got in last night. Uh that's uh me in front of the hotel, the Balmoral and um which is just beautiful. And then uh some stuff nearby. I don't even know what it's called yet. I love in the bathroom they have some James Bond with the proper James Bond, Sean Connory. They've got these cool pictures. I needed a mouse. This was the only mouse I could find from my computer uh within a two miles of the hotel at 8 at night. It's a Hello Kitty, so I'm sure I'm going to take a lot of flack for that. Some more Bond photos. All right, let's get down to business. On Friday, I joined the great Maria Barta Romo on Mornings with Maria Fox Business. We're going to listen in here. Welcome back. It is now time for the word on Wall Street. Top investors watching your money. Joining me now is Great Hill Capital Chairman Thomas Hayes. Also with us this morning is John Lonsky. Thomas, welcome to the program. Thanks so much for joining the conversation. Thanks for having me, Maria. Futures this morning under pressure. As you know, we got the Dow Jones Industrial Average right now down 83 and the Nasdaq down 64, extending the losses of yesterday after all three major indices finished lower on concerns over AI valuations. fears about the ongoing shutdown impact and new data on job cuts. Uh Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang saying there are no active discussions on selling the company's flagship Blackwell AI chips to China. He also clarified his recent remarks about China is winning the AI race. He says he only meant that the country has strong research talent. Nvidia jumped more than 65% in the last six months. It is now valued at $4.5 trillion after hitting 5 trillion at one point. Tesla shareholders approved a record $1 trillion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, the biggest in corporate history tied to ambitious targets including AI robo robo taxis and an $8.5 trillion market value. So we're talking about some huge numbers here. Thomas, are you worried about valuations within tech? I am, Maria. You know, you want to be fearful when others are greedy. What we saw in the last 12 weeks was retail investors 25 weeks consecutively buying call options. So there's a little froth in the market. And if you look at the AI trade, what you're seeing is we're looking for the return on invested capital. Uh cash flows for the hyperscalers are down 43% since Q4 of 2024 to Q1 of 2026. So this is a big issue. Cash flows are declining. And listen to this, Maria. Cap X as a percentage of operating cash flow is now 60% for the hyperscalers. There's only one other industry that has that high level of capex. You know what it is? It's called big oil. And the difference is big oil shows immediate returns. We're not going to see returns on this capex for for the hyperscalers for another one and a half to two years. So the market is taking inventory of this. The waiting of these companies got to 35% of the S&P 500 and the earnings power is only 23%. Well, by the way, that is exactly why I asked Jensen Huang about all of this, the CEO of Nvidia, saying, "When are we going to get a return on investment, all this money?" At one point at a conference, he said he's expecting $3 trillion a year in spending on the AI buildout, on the AI infrastructure. Are you saying you're worried about all that money in terms of yielding a real return? And does that mean you want to be a seller in this market? I think you have to be cautious. Basically, outside of the mag 7, outside of the AI trade, you could throw a dart at a board and find a reasonably valued stock. Inside of that trade, it's definitely frothy. And you know, these companies always commanded super high valuations because why? They were called capex light. They didn't require a lot of capital investment. Well, now they still have the same high valuations, but their cash flow is declining and the capex is going up. The market's worried. I think you want to ease up. If you're overconentrated in the Mag 7 and the hyperscalers, ease up, moderate, and rather than going to the AI cost centers, go to the AI beneficiaries, the ones that are going to implement the AI that don't have all the costs, whose margins are going to go up, which is effectively the unmagnificent 493, everything outside the MAG7. Yeah, great point. Look, this is all happening, this is not happening in a vacuum, John, right? This is all happening in the face of what looks like a weakening jobs picture. I mean, US companies announced more than 153,000 job cuts just in the month of October. That's the highest for the month in 22 years. Uh tech and warehousing led the losses as firms site AI adoption, soft consumer demand, rising costs. The report from Challenger Gray and Christmas said that the layoffs this year have already topped 1 million, the most since the pandemic. You've got JP Morgan CEO Jamie Diamond weighing in on AI's long-term impact, saying the technology will transform every job and in every industry. So, be ready. Watch this. It's going to affect the way I look at it is every application, every job, uh, every customer interface, everything we all do. And you're all going to have your own personal assistance. You're going to have agents that do research for you every time you wake up in the morning. Going to be unbelievable. It's going to cure a lot of diseases that we've all been afflicted with. You know, my guess is the developed world be working three and a half days a week in 20, 30, 40 years. You know, technology has downsides. It's used by bad people, but embrace it. Uh, we had 40 million people working in farms, tractors and fertilizers. It's now like one and a half million. We live better lives. It's literally at the beginning. There's whatever you think there are waves of this coming down the road because AI is happening rather quickly. John Lotsky, your reaction. Well, AI tells us everything's going to be awesome. That is, you know, provided you still have a job. That's going to be the problem. And the transition period is going to be difficult. Uh we are now getting perhaps next to nothing in terms of jobs growth. That tells me that we would have to be braced for lower than expected readings on consumer spending. And in fact, if I'm looking at some of these forecast on discretionary consumer spending, we're going from 7% year-to-year growth in the third quarter to growth of only three and a half% in the fourth quarter. And that's going to be made worse by the government shutdown. Well, we'll see if the Fed acts in December. That will be critical here. You just heard Muhammad El Arian say the Fed needs to cut rates. Thomas Hayes, thank you. Great to see you, sir. Come back soon. John, you're with us all morning long and we are so grateful for that. We'll take a break and come back. We're talking with Tom Emmer on the other side of this break. Stay with us. [Music] And we're back. And then uh want to remind you I'll be in Sarasota, Florida at the Ritz Carlton December 1st and 2nd uh or 2nd and 3rd. Well, 1st through 3rd is the entire event. You can see my speaking on the 1st and 2nd. You can still register here. Go to hedge funips.com. You can search on Money Show and register or just go straight to the Money Show website and you'll find it. No problem. While you're at hedge fun.com, click on terms. This is all opinion, not advice. Consult your financial adviser before doing anything. Uh Ray Dallio, don't worry about looking good. Worry about achieving your goals. I think too many people are afraid of failing or looking bad and they never go after anything in life and they uh uh what did the say uh live a life of quiet desperation and go to the grave singing the same song. You got to take a you got to take a shot ladies and gentlemen. And um uh speaking of which, here's Charlie Mer who took shots his whole life. Success means being very patient but aggressive when it's time. and aggressive when it's time is exactly the cue we took from him when he did his tenico deal during the 2001 recession and made five or 7x on that. Uh and we followed the same framework into Cooper Standard in May of 2022. Uh he wasn't in that one with us. Uh but uh that's been a home run and that is early days. So um you got to take your shots. Want to thank those of you who keep sending in your uh um pictures with the merch. Here's Claire and Cork. And Claire's doing an incredible job. Uh she's a student. Cork Snder is Statman. He teaches at one of the local high schools in California that I went to speak at. And uh his brilliant student Claire tutors my girls in math and does an incredible job. So more and more. There's Patty by the way uh who came to the lunch. Uh, and so many of you sending in these great photos. So, uh, get your hat, get your mug, get your shirt. I love the hoodies if you live in a cold climate, uh, or windy climate. And, um, the name of the game is let's keep sharing hedge fund tips with Tom Hayes. And as we continue to grow, we're going to continue to do this in perpetuity so long as we grow. And that's up to you. Um, uh, my clients are going to get it no matter what. But, uh, non-clients, keep it going. word of mouth and this is the easiest way to do it because when you wear the hat and t-shirt people say what's that and you can tell them all about it. So thank you for your support. Let's continue to move on to the data. Uh historic holiday sales and forecast. So we're looking at 3.7 to 4.2% expected growth for the holiday season. Here's Wolf Research out defending QXO after earnings with a $43 price targets. They're t saying take the long view. We agree you never want to bet against Brad Jacobs and we're going to talk about two of his companies today. Uh average equity fund flow by calendar month over the past decade excluding US election years. So you can see uh a lot of money starts to flow in December through March. Uh here's small cap PE ratios. You can see 16 times earnings for the small cap 6 S&P 600 versus 26 times for uh including some of the nonprofitable small cap. So uh that shows you where you want to focus on is on the profitable areas. Uh here is this is water by the way in case you uh well those of you who have been around know me well enough. I'm pretty much a water and diet coke guy, but um and coffee. So, let's see. Cyclical sectors challenger job cuts. So, what we have here is challenger US job cuts announcements going down after a spike and then cyclical start to go up. So, that should be positive for cyclicals. Uh here is October 2025 ETF launches by segment. The biggest set of launches was leveraged equity. That is a sign of froth, ladies and gentlemen. That's why we started to see some chop. We'll see. You know, it's interesting. on Friday, we went through a lot of our positions and some of the cash that was available and uh we kind of got lucky because um we looked at the positions that haven't moved yet and they were at levels that were like this is definitely an inflection and we put a decent amount of money to work on Friday. I don't think this correction is over, which is why we're not on uh any type of meaningful margin at all and we still have a little bit of cash. But um for some of the names, even if the market corrected another 3 or 4% uh which I don't know whether it will or it won't, but uh that's kind of my base case. um these things have such a margin of safety that it really wouldn't matter wouldn't matter much. So we put a basically a third or maybe a third or a half of the dry powder together uh to work on Friday. Uh we hope to be able to put the remainder uh in the next few weeks. Um but I think we might have a few more hiccups along the way. So, just be open-minded. Uh, and but where the margin of safety is there, you you're never going to get market timing perfect. What you're trying to say is would I buy the entire company at this price? And we have enough target companies uh that unequivocally we would buy it at this price. So whether the market goes down another 3% and some of these names go down another 3% is kind of immaterial because they're all going to be doubles and triples in our view uh based on how we underwrite them. Uh so we, you know, sometimes better an imperfect plan executed today than a perfect tomorrow because tomorrow never comes. Um we're we're easing in selectively and we think there's a little bit more opportunity in coming weeks. So let's let's leave it at that. Uh it's nuanced here. Uh evolution of at Atlanta Fed GDP now is still at 4%. So, even if we lose a percent or percentage and a half uh GDP from the shutdown, um provided they get this done before Thanksgiving, uh we've got more than enough cushion. Here's the home construction ETF. Uh started to take off, came back to test this. I think we're basically there. If you don't have your exposure to home building through the Generax, through the QXOs's, through the Stanley Black & Deckers, I think this is about your last time here in the next few weeks and then it's going to run away from you. So, declining correlation between MAG 7 components. So, we saw the Meta and the Teslas versus the Google's and the um Amazon's. Uh kind of a mixed mixed bag there, but the theme is the same. People are saying where's the return on invested capital? Uh rational but exuberant nonetheless. Record bullishness on stock. So, I think I think what I've said is going to prove to be accurate despite coming in Monday to a little bit of strength in the AI trade. Um, is that the all of that call volume that was bought by retail investors over the last 25 weeks, the bulk of which expiring in November, I think that's got to be flushed and I don't think any of those people are going to get paid, which implies another couple of few percentage points down uh on the general indices. And I think once you get through that option expiration date, that's that could probably be uh where it's time to uh get long and and maybe add quite a bit of risk. But uh we'll we'll take it week by week and day by day. Uh narrow market breath, a watch out tell for bubbles. Um yeah, and that's certainly been the case. that's been part of our base case was breath deteriorating. Most uh all-time 52- week lows since April. Uh I don't think all of this stuff is worked through by one good day of the AI trade. I think it's going to take a few more weeks of bumps and chops. Uh if I'm wrong, great. If I'm right, even better. Um, I'd rather I'd rather go into the end of the year because we bought a lot down and have, you know, 10 12% margin uh at super low prices or we'll go into the year with a couple percentage of cash and the market will be a lot higher and uh uh that's not the worst case either because we're still making a lot of gains. So, uh that's how we're thinking about it. Let's see. The hypers scalar bond spreads are blowing out here up 70 up to 78 basis points. Again, these are still very subdued levels, but the direction is what's more pronounced. Hyperscaler cash flow insufficient to fight AI race. So, they're now having to borrow to fund the capex. And as I said on Mornings with Maria, um again, uh thanks to Caroline Halvin Stricker and Sonni Bakshi for having me on. Um the key is going to be return on invested capital and uh they're now spending at the same levels as big oil and not getting the instant returns that big oil is getting on their investments, but the multiple is more than two times higher. uh equity sentiment indicator. Okay. Value versus growth factor starting to turn back up. In the last month, equity call volume in excessive puts reached the highest value on record. I'm just telling you ladies and gentlemen, these people don't get paid. It's just the way it goes. Uh so we'll see what happens. Energy looks like it's breaking out of a large cup and handle. Uh healthc care is now breaking out. These are the two that we've been pounding the table on. you're seeing our national oil well Varco and our comm stock taking off and um biotech has been crushing it. Uh Baxter not so much yet, but uh we added some on Friday, so we're we're comfortable there. We covered that last week in detail. Uh what makes us unique and our podcast is unique is we confront problems headon. We don't run from problems and we address Baxter uh head on. and uh in doing that uh grew our conviction to add to the position. Uh fear is a little bit flushed out here. That's probably why you saw the bounce on Monday. Then let's see, healthc care sector is on track to deliver its third year of underperformance relative to the S&P. Healthcare has tr the S&P by 8 percentage points year to date uh following underperformance of 22% in 2024, 24% in 2025. cumulative 70 percentage points of healthcare underperformance has been unprecedented in the last 50 years of data history. The sector now constitutes just 9% of the S&P 500 market cap down from 15% in 2022. And I can tell you ladies and gentlemen uh that's when you tend to see massive outperformance after this is very reminiscent of 1999 before healthcare dramatically outperformed in 2000 uh and 9293 recession outperformed in '94 95 and then 9697 for four uh four out of five of the next year. I think we're headed into that. So the key is going to be uh more finding more health care or just sizing up our existing health care which we've started to do. Uh okay let's see here. Total free cash flow of Apple plus Amazon plus Microsoft Alphabet Tesla and Meta in the last 12 months uh continuing to decline as we've talked about. That's why they're starting to borrow to fund their thing. uh the hyperscalers exclusively uh between fourth quarter of 2024 and first quarter of 2025 free cash flow will be down 43%. So that's even bigger than this. Uh median age of first-time home buyers in the US is now 40. That's super sad. Um, after ripping higher in September through early October, simple momentum chasing strategies such as buying stock with high net call volumes in the previous week have sold off since the US China trade expiration escalation a month ago. So those momo people are getting smacked. Uh, other recent moment momentum beneficiaries such as stocks with high short interest have also sold off. S&P is now back at the bottom of the trend channel in place over the last three years. So, if it can hold this, that's very positive. It points towards 7,000. If it cracks, there's probably going to be a little bit of work to do before it gets back up there. Uh, and that's going to scare a lot of people. So, we will see. Chinese companies are increasing share buybacks, uh, which is huge. Uh, consumer discretionary seasonality kicks in around now. So some of those uh neglected names uh in consumer discretionary and then uh natural gas prices turning up which is good for comtock. Colder than expected weather. We like that the climate is changing. The climate is changing. Yeah, we know that. Uh current bull market is still young relative to previous cycles. Uh you could see here 131 month 148 month we're at 67 months. So we'll see how that plays out. First quarter since earnings recession where small cap EPS growth has outpaced large cap EPS growth. This is big first quarter since the earnings recession. So, what you're seeing here is small caps earnings growth uh about 25% versus large caps at about 13% and one has a much lower multiple than the other, about seven turns lower. Earnings are expected to remain strong, about 13% earnings growth for next year. Here's the consumer sentiment index completely flushed out consistent with recession levels uh but tends to lead to huge recoveries. So um this is a a bit abnormal. We're seeing consumer sentiment at 2008 and 2009 levels bottoming out kind of like where it did in 2011 with the double bottom which implies that um there's upside ahead uh either from here or from slightly lower levels if we get a little bit of a hiccup in coming weeks or a little bit more hiccup. We started to get a hiccup. Um, healthcare trades at a large valuation discount relative to history. We've been pounding the table on that uh forward PE. So the lowest multiple in the group is biotech and pharma. forward PE9 pharma. We got our eye on that group. Um, you know, it's just we we have to continue to run a concentrated portfolio, but we do want to get more exposure to healthcare. Housing becoming less affordable for home first-time home buyers. Well, starting to come down a little bit. We'll see. I think that's going to change pretty dramatically over the next year. Uh mentions of power surge this EPS serve this EPS season, highest level since 2006. That's going to help our national oil well varco and our comm stock payroll growth. This was the uh worst in 20 years or something. the October numbers. So, we got to keep our eye on that. That should keep the Fed in the game. They're stopping QT and actually turning to QE, but calling it something else uh starting in December. So, that's going to be welcome after uh any weakness that we may or may not get in coming weeks uh along with the Fed cut. inflow into equities has continued. So there's there's been a frenzy the last four weeks and usually you got to take a little air out of that before you move next higher. So you want to get all the weak sisters out that chase the market up 45% off the lows. Uh knock them out and then you can resume higher after taking their money. They will they bought at the top. they'll sell, you know, eight or 10 percent down depending on the name. Uh if the market goes down another 3%, call it six percent, 7% all in. Um some of the names that these people chased into will be down 2025. And once they get puked out, uh the market can then find its footing, start to look to the Fed, increase liquidity, and uh probably start to show some strength uh towards the last few weeks of the year uh and into first quarter of next year. Shells break even. Wells can make money and cover costs in the low $60 barrel range. And that's the data. Let's go into some headlines. Alibaba doubles down on supercale computing infrastructure plans as AI demand grows. Uh comprehensive consumption AI innovation, new brand champions and AAP's part uh partnership with Xpang. Uh so some more updates on Alibaba's website. China consumer prices unexpectedly rise on holiday demand. This is interesting because if you remember the whole story when China was quote unquote uninvestable was the fact that uh prices continued to go down. They couldn't get any inflation. They were in deflation. That's now changing. Luxury and lifestyle giants signed renewal confidence signal renewed confidence in China's consumer recovery. Uh, Gen Z shoppers can't get enough perfumes. Cody and Estee Lauder are benefiting. That's exciting to see. Hedge fund hedge flow funds cut consumer stocks to global pandemic lows. Goldman data shows that's a contrarian buy signal there. Uh Trump floats idea of $2,000 tariff dividend checks to most Americans. Uh you're not getting a check. That is a signal to the Supreme Court. If you take away the tariffs, I can keep them just by distributing to them to the taxpayers. So, you're not going to win anything other than create inflation because I'm going to give it back to the people versus giving it back to the countries that gave it to us. Uh, and then I'll do a workaround with other laws to get more tariffs in place that the US Treasury will keep. So, go ahead and vote against it uh after we've negotiated all these deals and you will uh lose. So, that's his message to the Supreme Court. Senate clears key hurdle toward ending government shutdown. So, that's positive. It only took him 5 weeks. Uh Musk plans Tesla mega AI chip fab mole's potential Intel partnership. Telling you ladies and gentlemen, he can do his own fab. It's going to take him five years. Intel's already at the finish finish line. Uh and they can just start to dump orders into Intel. China resumes next chip exports to ease supply crunch. Black Rockck faces 100% loss on private loan adding to credit market pain. Ladies and gentlemen, we've been warning about this. Everyone crowding into private credit and private equity because of the fake mark to make believe. They get marked to 100% forever until the next mark is zero. Why do they keep marking it to make believe even when they know there's trouble? because they collect 2% management fees on it uh and carry by uh marking it to whatever they want to and they can no longer do it once the uh borrower stops paying and then they have to mark it down to zero. So about a month ago, Black Rockck deemed the private debt it had extended Renovo Home Partners, a struggling home improvement company to be worth 100 cents on the dollar. As of last week, the firm had a new assessment. Zero. Okay. And those of you and a lot of pension people are are listening and you know, you um have all crowded into private equity and private credit. So, you get to keep your jobs and look good because you have no volatility in your mark tomarket except when you have 100% volatility and more of this stuff is going to happen. And the people who are hiding in these in order to look good on their monthly and weekly and annual performance reviews are going to get canned because they don't have proper exposure. See, when you invest in equities, you get warning signals. You get marked to market every single day of the week. So, you can say, "Okay, the stock is down. Why is the stock down? Has anything changed in the underlying fundamental business? Is this a temporary change? Is this a permanent change? When you look at your sheets and you say, "Oh, everything's at par and everything's doing great and they're all marked to makeelieve." Uh, you don't know if there's trouble until you get the trouble all at once. And I'm telling you, all these pensions that have crowded into private equity and private credit are going to the chickens are going to come home to roost because you don't have they're still buying businesses. they there's no the out the the perceived outperformance uh as an ass asset class is perceived. They're still investing in the underlying economy and in underlying businesses and they will have the same effective performance rate. The difference is the public companies will have more access to capital markets uh and actually be healthier as a result. So, uh, Dagio names and and the other thing with, um, public companies is when the stock goes down a lot, what does the board do? It immediately reacts because it has a warning signal and it replaces the CEO like you saw with Dagio this week and they finally got rid of the clown show that was the last CEO. and put in a real guy who did the Tesco turnaround, super famous guy in the UK, Dave Lewis, and the stock goes up because, you know, Buffett once said, "Buy a business that's so good that a ham sandwich can run it because one day a ham sandwich will run it." And that's exactly what happened with Dagio. Not just the last CEO, the CEO before they were clowns without a circus. But the the business still generates so much effing cash flow that even they working full-time could not screw it up. And now you're going to get a competent jockey at the reigns and this thing over the next 3 to 5 years is going to double and everyone's going to say, "Oh, I thought no one was drinking alcohol anymore." Go have a Dagio 00 with no alcohol and no calories and tell me if you can taste the difference between that and a regular Guinness. uh and you know I'll give you a hundred bucks because at the end of the day they are ahead of the curve on non non-alcoholic they are ahead of the curve in high quality alcoholic and um uh GLPs are not people still like to go out and have a good time and socialize and Dagio is in the the leader in premiumization drinking less but drinking better which means higher margin higher quality stuff uh and uh Dave Dave Lewis is going to absolutely rock and roll and be an effective steward of all of that incredible free cash flow that continues to come in despite years of mismanagement. Wait till it has proper management and you see what happens to the stock. More homes equal lower prices. B Bill Py wants builders to step on the gas. We agree that's going to help the QXOs of the world, the Stanley Black & Deckers of the world, uh the Generax of the world, etc. Feds Mirren says stable coin surge could help push interest rates lower. We've been talking about this for a year. It's happening. Boeing bets big on South Carolina plant to double 787 output and people are selling the stock. Thank you. You know, it's it's funny. When we were buying on Friday, uh we actually thought about putting new money to work in Boeing at 195. We didn't do it because we have such a lower basis, but uh it's getting tempting. Shale operators defy $60 oil to keep increasing production. That helps serers like National Oil Wellvarco, which is why we have no ENTP names in the oil space because uh we don't want to be at the effect of the price of oil. We want to be effect at the volume of oil. Similar to our Cooper Standard play with cars, prices will go down, incentives will go up, volumes will go up, which helps Cooper Standard. And uh similar to um yeah so so that theme continues. Uh boring never looks so good stock market and sentiment results. GXO logistics update. GXO reported another standout quarter last week hitting its stride in the early innings of the logistics upcycle. Revenues of 3.4 4 billion jumped 8% year-on-year, marking an all-time record for Q3. Organic growth of 4% marks the continued recovery from the Dtock trough reached in Q4 2023 and has remained in a clear uptrend ever since. New business wins of 280 million, up 24% year-on-year, brought year-to- date wins above 800 million, putting GXO on pace for its third straight year, topping a billion in new contracts. Even more encouraging, the topline recovery still looks to be in the early innings. 2026 is already shaping up as another strong year with 690 million of incremental revenue booked through Q3, up nearly 50% from the same point last year, effectively locking in 5% plus gross organic growth before factoring in any additional wins, renewals, or volume acceleration. Margins are the next piece of the puzzle. They've lagged the topline recovery and remained below both historical averages and the long-term 9% plus target with year-to- date adjusted Ebida margins at 6.5%. Much of that drag came from the Winkitton integration delays caused by the CMA review which is now firmly behind GXO with the full $60 million run rate of cost synergies on track by year end 2026. Beyond that, rising automation now over 40% of revenues and contributing 200 basis points of margin lift aka you all the robots in their factories uh picking 70,000 SKUs and expanding higher value services like reverse logistics adding 300 basis points uplift position GXO for what CEO Patrick Kellaher calls quote a structurally higher margin base. Speaking of Patrick Kellaher, we continue to view him as a major catalyst in GXO's next era of growth. With over 33 years of global supply chain experience, he's a proven operator whose track record speaks for itself. Logistics are in his blood. Okay, so he's coming from uh he um DHL, which is the largest logistics provider. uh he was the CEO of North America where he oversaw significant growth and operational improvements across the business. Uh this is a big deal because GXO's next growth play is into America. As you know, most of their revenues are in Europe. So, Keller set a clear mandate in his inaugural call. Reacelerating organic growth is the top priority and North America will be the engine to get it done. Let me repeat, North America will be the engine to get it done. stomping grounds he knows better than anyone as the former CEO of DHL Supply Chain North America with the US accounting for just $3.1 billion or 26% of revenues in 2024 and a total addressable market north of 250 billion. The runway for expansion is wide open as you know um Brad Jacobs always likes to target 10 to 15% of a market. So I mean you you could be looking at 25 billion as as a target in in their sites. Uh I might be overly ambitious for them but uh you never know with the with Jacobs and Co. and now Keller to execute. Uh especially in higher margin vehicles like industrial life sciences, aerospace and defense and technology. In fact the sales pipeline in those segments climbed 30% sequentially with technology tripling even before finding the coffee machine. Keller is positioning GXO to tap into that growth, bringing in Michael Jacobs, his handpicked America's leaders and reallocating resources in North America. I gotta tell you, when I met with Brad Jacobs in Greenwich, uh uh let's see, whenever the RDER Cup was in September, uh they couldn't stop talking about how much they liked um Keller at GXO and uh and we couldn't agree more. Uh the mega trends across these verticals combined with the added complexity of tariffs and reshoring put GXO at the center of a massive needlemoving opportunity. Early transaction in foreign trade zone demand is already evidence of that shift. Tailwinds that should be a shot in the arm for outsourcing and music to GXO's ears. GXO eyes expansion as tariffs bolster bolster demand for foreign trade zones which they will specialize in. So, while the stock may take a breather on noise around the consumer or a quote slow holiday peak season, we think that misses the forecast the forest for the trees. With more than $800 million of incremental wins already signed for 2025 and a 95% retention rate, GXO remains well on track to reach its fullear organic growth range of 3.5 to 6.5%. Where results land within that range will depend on volumes with the midpoint of 5% implying Q4 organic growth of 7.8% the strongest in over three years. If recent history is any guide betting against the consumer has rarely been a profitable trade. Holiday sales forecast between uh midpoint around 4% 26% of 2024 revenues. What's that? I see. United Kingdom holiday sales forecast plus 4.2%. With multiple catalysts in place. Oh, I see. Okay. So, there US United States holiday sales expected to grow 4% midpoint. Uh that market is 26% of GXO's revenues. United Kingdom is 45% of the revenues. The the retail sales are expected to grow 4.2%. With multiple cattle in place for a return to the holy grail of high singledigit organic growth and structurally higher margin base, all signs point to GXO getting its swagger back together. Those drivers lay the foundation for a strong recovery back to normalized earnings power and a rerating toward the multiple a high quality doubledigit grow growing cash machine deserves. Here's the breakdown. So let me repeat that together. Those drivers lay the foundation for a strong recovery back to normalized earnings power and a rerating toward the multiple a high quality doubledigit growing cash machine deserves. Rerating means multiple expansion based on growth and increasing margins which is the holy grail in um sellside coverage. 10 key points. Number one, GXO posted record quarterly revenues of 3.4 4 billion up 8% year-on-year. Most importantly, 4% of that growth was organic with every region contributing and bringing fullyear organic growth to 4.1%. The remaining 4% came from an FX tailwind, a key piece in our of our bull thesis on multinationals benefiting from a weaker dollar. Two new business wins during the quarter total of 280 million up 24% year-on-year. This brings total incremental revenue secured for 2025 to 800 million with management having a clear line of sight to exceed $1 billion for the year, which would mark the third straight year of new business wins above a billion. Looking ahead to 2026, GXO has already signed 690 million of incremental revenue, up nearly 50% from the same point last year. Three, GXO's total sales pipeline now stands at 2.3 billion with opportunities in life sciences and aerospace and defense each increasing by 30% sequentially while technology tripled the technology vertical with a $28 billion TAM is a high margin segment where GXO is making a major push having secured three new contracts with a leading hyperscaler during the quarter. Let me repeat that. The technology vertical with a $28 billion TAM total addressable market is a high margin segment where GXO is making a major push having secured three new contracts with a leading hyperscaler during the quarter. Number four, one of the new one of new CEO Patrick Keller's top priorities is accelerating organic growth, particularly in the US, which represented just 26% of revenues in 2024. North America remains one of the largest and fastest growing logistics markets globally with a total addressable market exceeding 250 billion. GXO has appointed Michael Jacobs as president of the Americas and Asia-Pacific region and is strategically reallocating resources towards sales solutioning and digital marketing to drive stronger organic growth. Management views this as a major catalyst positioning GXO to benefit from rising industrial aerospace and defense and data center activity as well as the ongoing reshoring of manufacturing to the US and tariff driven supply chain localization. Both meaningful tailwinds for the business five. GXO's landmark 2.5 billion 10-year deal with the UK's NHS supply chain went live flawlessly in October and is expected to ramp up and make a material contribution to Q4 results. Management is already in discussions to expand that partnership and capitalize on broader growth within the 34 billion life sciences segment. Another notable win in the space is expected to close during Q4 as well as a strong pipeline of strategic opportunities expected to close before year end. Six, the Winkington integration is official officially underway having kicked off in October with the combined teams already securing their first win together. The $60 million run $60 million of run rate cost synergies remain on track to be fully realized by the end of 2026, which is expected to be a meaning meaningful margin tailwind for the year. Management also expects to unlock significant revenue synergies over the coming years, similar to those achieved through the Clipper acquisition, which was the key driver behind the landmark 2.5 billion NHS contract and GXO's expansion into the healthcare segment. Number seven, adjusted Ebidok came in at 250 million during Q3, up 13% from 223 million in the prior year period. Margins expanded by 100 basis points sequentially and 30 basis points year-over-year, driven by improved site level productivity and successful automated start startups. Management continues to see an opportunity for a structurally higher margin base with year-to- date margins of 6.5% compared to the long-term financial target of 9% plus supported by growth in automation related revenues and value added high margin services such as reverse logistics aka uh return management. Eight management reaffirmed fullear guidance calling for organic revenue growth of 3.5 to 6.5 and adjusted EBID between 865 million and 885 million. So far, management is seeing a normal peak season consistent with fullear expectations for flat consumer volumes. Management remains confident in delivering both growth and margin expansion in 2026 with an investor day plan for early next year to update the market on long-term guidance. Nine free cash flow for the quarter came in at 187 million up 110 million in the from the prior year period. Uh this brings year-to- date free cash flow to 96 million compared to 124 million for last year. Operating return on invested capital came in well above expectations at 48.6% versus the long-term target of greater than 30% and 10. GXO's net leverage ratio improved sequentially to 2.7 times from 3.0 zero times even after executing 200 million in share buybacks during the first half. Cash and cash equivalents now stand at 339 million with total liquidity of 1.3 billion against total debt of 2.7 billion. Management plans to further delever the balance sheet in 2026 with M&A not on the near-term agenda. So you can go through the earnings call. We started the most important part and you can find that at hedge funips.com. QXO update. So, we got a Brad Jacobs day. QXO earnings came in with no surprises last week coming in line with pre-announced results from late October. uh Q3 sales of 2.73 billion were down 1% year-on-year versus leg legacy beacons 2.77 billion adjusted EBA margins of 11.1% improved by 40 basis points sequentially but we're still down year-over-year from legacy beacons 11.7% the stock had been under pressure lately selling off in concert with the weakness across the broader residential roofing market something QXO isn't completely immune to for those worried about quarterto quarter volatility or cyclical softness this story isn't for you. In fact, we will be sending Christmas cards to all the generous former shareholders who puked in the hole on a soft quarter. For the rest of us, uh, and by the way, we were buyers at QXO on Friday. Uh, this line from Brad J Brad Jacobs is all we need to hear. Quote, "We're making excellent progress optimizing Beacon and continue to find new avenues for growth. We outperform the market this quarter and are firmly on track to organically grow legacy Beacons IBIDA to more than$2 billion dollars. This momentum combi combined with a very robust acquisition pipeline primes us to reach 50 billion in annual revenue within a decade outperformed the market. New avenues for growth firmly on track to double IBIDA to greater than two billion. Robust M&A pipeline on track for 50 billion in annual revenue within a decade. 5x the current 10 billion. In plain English, that leaves $40 billion of topline expansion still to come. the vast majority through M&A with the entire industry stuck in the cyclical quote pain zone. The longer the weakness lasts, the more act attractively priced acquisition targets become. You have to ask yourself if you're QXO with only one deal under your belt and still in the early innings of an aggressive M&A journey. Would you rather have an industry firing on all cylinders and pay peak multiples or take advantage of temporary macro noise and shop from the clearance rack? When you zoom out, the answer becomes abundantly clear. The longer this dislocation persists, the more of the 7,000 plus distributors across North America will find themselves in QXO's insights. A mana from heaven opportunity for a serial acquirer like Brad Jacobs. Frankly, we wouldn't draw it up any other way. In the meantime, while we wait for the next big acquisition, the focus remains on improving efficiency and driving organic growth at Legacy Beacon, where progress is already visible. Management has identified 200 million of pricing leakage caused by undisciplined discounting and operational inefficiency, cleaned up the organizational structure, and improved inventory availability. On top of that, Jacobs is running the same playbook he always does, leveraging technology and automation to whip this outdated industry into QXO shape. There are just these are just the early steps in a long-term goal of doubling IBIDA to over two billion and achieving 500 plus basis points of margin expansion over the next five years. The way we see it, this is a textbook opportunity for Brad Jacobs to roll up his sleeves and do what he does best, transform fragmented industries and create massive shareholder value in the process. Have some patience and park this one in the filing cabinet because at the end of the day, temporary macro noise doesn't change a single one of the major structural tailwinds working in QXO's favor. Shortage of nearly 4 million homes in the US. The housing market is short 3.7 million housing units. Uh Freddy Mack, the root cause decreased housing affordability is the fact that housing supply has not increased enough to match demand. Trump is on this. They're opening up federal lands. This will happen. significantly aged US housing stock with a median home age over 40 years. Uh five week uh next week infrastructure spending driving more than two trillion in needed investment across North America over the next two decades below average investment since 2010. Um 70 plus million millennials entering peak family formation years. You could see it here. Wolf came out shortly after earnings taking the long view and maintaining a $43 price target. We agree. Here are the notes on that and those are the results. So, uh, fear and greed down to 28. Uh, the National Association of Active Investment Managers equity exposure, uh, they sold in the hole was down to 35% at the April lows. Uh, last week was at 100% at the highs. Uh, now they're backing off because the market's correcting. So I think there's going to be a little bit more consolidation here in the near term. Moving along, uh biotech earnings top 30 weights in the last 60 days were revised up 3.39% for next year. Equal weight biotech similar up 3.44%. Economic data, not a whole lot, but apparently we're going to be getting a bunch soon. Earnings were good, up 13.1% yearonear versus 8% estimated. So, it's come in better than expected. The multiple even after the pullback is still extended at 22.7%. Um, so we'll keep an eye on that. And with that said, let's move on to our ask me anything questions. We got a lot of great ones this week. David H says, "Tom, love the podcast. Please take a look at Wendy's. Is this a value trap opportunity or too early to tell? Um, and I I've covered this one. I don't like Wendy's. If um Nelson Peltz couldn't turn it around, no one can. And um yeah, I I'm not a fan of Wendy's. I think it's a little bit early, but getting closer. You might be okay here. I just don't like it. I don't like the riskreward enough. Um, wait a little longer. Bradley Gerald sharing the pod with everyone I can. Always appreciate everything you do. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Currently have QXO. Wondering what you think of DHI. Uh, well, we did cover the group. DHI hasn't come in enough. Um, too early on that one. Next is Tim D. Let's see. XHB. Let me just see the homebuilders. Yeah. Thoughts on Dolingo? Yeah, we've covered Dolingo. Uh, I don't I love the product and I think it's great. I think the risk you run with these software plays is that uh AI can do it for free. So that's a risk with that one and it's a risk with another great software company called Adobe. Um so the juryy's still out. Jacob Molina Healthcare Bured a pretty large position. I mean, the problem with Bur is he's like, you know, he tends to trade in and out of stuff and um I definitely I definitely think the theme is right. The problem with Molina and Sentine is they deal with the lower end people um the lower end uh insurance. So, it tends to be the people who can't get insurance anywhere else that are on the exchange. um plans which these guys cover and the cost uh the loss rate tends to be super high. Uh and then you have that coupled with the government potentially reducing subsidies for these and I say I think the play for this was Humana. I think that's already gotten away from us. Let's see. No, I think Humana is probably a better way to play it. um as I continue to remind myself, but we're not going to run a a 20 stock portfolio, so you know, we have to be selective and we like what we have. But I think that's interesting. Matt Tumbbo, thoughts on Deckers? No. We covered this last week. Hasn't come down enough. Um Patrick Neo, love the podcast, the value you provide. want to get your thoughts on James Hardy. I think we covered this one. This is the chocolate company maybe. Let's see. Let's see. JHX. Yeah, the revenues have been flat for a few years. Let's just see here. Oh, no. Okay, this is uh fiber cement fiber gypson cement bonded boards. Okay, so this is building supplies. I kind of like this. been around since 1888. See what the balance sheet looks like. I think he got a good one here, my friend. Uh [Music] Let's see here. Four time sales 12 times. Let's take a look at the balance sheet here. All right, let's see. 391 million of cash. And what's the receivables look like? 328. What's this? Restricted cash 1.7 billion. Wait a second. Huh? Okay. Long-term debt 2.5. So, that's probably okay. I I'd want to get a better understanding what that restricted cash is, but looks okay. Uh, free cash flow picking back up. Uh, income statement. Yeah, this they've struggled with the housing revenues have been going down, but that should pick back up. Is your account steady? I think it's okay. See what's happening to gross margins. Gross margins are coming back a little bit. Uh, I like this one. I like this one between, you know, 15 and 1750. So, good job, Patrick. Brian David, hey Tom, long time listener. Thanks for everything you do. Got lucky with RNA being bought by Nova Nordis. Deals expect to close first half. Yeah, Brian, I wouldn't play the merger. I should count I think you should count your lucky blessings on that. Um Henry Griffith. uh genuinely curious about your thoughts on Stanley Duck and Duck Duck and Miller's investing style. Look, there there are many paths to the promised land and what you need to do is figure out what you are better than most people at and your niche that's better. Uh Dr. Miller, you know, I mean, here's the other thing is sometimes you see a great long-term track record because someone had one binary huge bet and it carries their entire career. You know, if you're up 300% in one year, you can be down 2% for the next 10 years and still outperform everyone else. Um, so you have to be a little bit um discerning when you follow people and and you know, in the case of Drunken Miller, he's got a magic hand. He certainly is good on macro calls. Uh, but if you you know, if anyone listening to this podcast think they're going to out macro, uh, Stanley Ducken Miller, uh, you know, good luck. I mean, it's it's possible, but you don't have as much control as you do underwriting individual businesses, and you're not going to sleep as well. Uh, so, um, you know, if you want to do cowboy bets, uh, you know, few people have pulled it off and and they write they write books about them. Uh, and, you know, if you look at Pollson for instance, he made a tremendous amount of money. Uh, a lot of people that made money during the big short uh haven't made much money since. Uh, not all of them. Some have done well, but for the most part, the people who made money in the big short have not done well since because they've missed a lot of the bull market by being pessimistic all the time. So, um, Dr. Miller is an exception. I think he's great, but there's no framework for which from which you can model and replicate uh, and have predictability in the outcome. So, um, you know, what they don't write about is the tens of thousands of people who tried to be drunk and miller and are now Walmart greeters because they gambled and lost versus gambled and won. Um, so, um, I'll leave it at that. You know, same goes for momentum investing. There's there are a few successful people that do it well. Ron Baron's the only one I know who's consistently done well. A lot of that's embedded in Tesla, but uh he's stood the test of time as a growth investor. He's the exception, not the rule. Uh Dereken Miller is the exception, not the rule as it relates to macro investing. If you look at some of the bigger firms like Bridgewater, they had that huge bet. Um you know, the the subsequent performance um you know, has has not been in that same league. So um you know, there is the saying, uh as it relates to some of these guys, you only have to get rich once. So that that's good. But if you're following them on the basis of one big binary coin flip that they got right with leverage and then expecting all their subsequent decisions to have that same magnitude of impact, uh I think you'll be sorely disappointed. So I would avoid that path. But if that's the path that speaks to you, then get as good at it as Draen Miller did. And and uh the way you do that is, you know, 30 years of non-stop experience. And uh uh that's that. Matias Sherm uh did you also have a look at RXO when checking out Brad Jacob's work? Uh I did I don't like it. I don't I mean I think it'll do fine for the next few years. I think their mode is going to get eroded um because it's basically just Uh, I picked the best two that I wanted to be exposed with. I think RXL will probably work, but it doesn't have the same level of certainty and clarity that the others have for me. So, I'll leave it at that. But I don't I don't think you're going to get hurt doing that. I think you're actually going to make money for the next few years, but I don't think the level of certainty that I feel comfortable with my and clients money in is the same as I have with GXO and QXO. Jimmy Jones uh with the China and USA only extending the agreement for one year. Does that place a timeline concern for holding Baba? No, Baba's positioning was not related to an agreement with China and the US. Uh it was based on cash flow and underlying fundamental. Jacob Saxs law saxtoft. Now if it has a three handle in front of it inside of a year, yeah, we'll probably be out. But um we'll see. Tom, thank you for insights. Can you look at Team Weaver again? Price has fallen more since you said to pass. Um Team Viewer I think this falls in the software category that we're not really interested in because we have no idea the impact that AA is going to have on these software businesses. So revenues have been flat since for four years almost five years. I'm sorry. Free cash flow has been flat. Revenues are still growing. Let's take a look at what do these guys do. Provides remote connectivity solutions worldwide. remote support, control management, IT, digital workflow. I mean, a lot of people do this. So, I I just, you know, I just don't know what the edge is going to be here. Let's just see. Sure. There's no debt. 48 million of cash. Oh, they do have a half a billion dollars of debt coming due. Wow. So that's that's your problem right there. Um yeah, they got to pay off the half a billion dollars of debt. They got Let me just see something else here. They've been buying back shares, so that's good. They got 43 million of cash and 22 million of receivable and they've got a half a billion dollars of current debt. So your risk, your risk is that they got to issue a ton of stock. If that information is correct, let's just see here. Yeah. Um, you have better understand how that's going to get paid off. Uh, for me it's a no. All right. So, here's someone looking for a catalyst on PayPal. Daniel, the catalyst is time. It's no different than Baba. There was no explicit catalyst. It was just that people walk up to it all at once and when it turns it turns all at once. There'll be some headline that you think is the catalyst but it never is. Uh it's just when the voting machine turns and the dispondency turns into euphoria, the price follows. It the the price always catches up to the fundamentals sooner or later. And the case of Baba and in the case of PayPal and in the case of BABA, the fundamentals continued to improve and then finally price started started to catch up with it. Same will be true with PayPal. So, you're looking for some catalyst because, oh, why doesn't it go up? Blah, blah, blah. Don't worry about that. It's a time arbitrage game. The reason that you're concerned is the reason why we have an edge in the market is because people get uh tired of waiting and then right when they get out it doubles and triples and that's rinse and repeat. Um, hey Tom, who's to say Back won't do another stupid acquisition like Hillrom? Well, two things Care. Uh, one, they have a new CEO who doesn't do dumb deals. Uh, and two, uh, that's not on the, uh, agenda. But look, you can't have 100% certainty with anything. But, um, you know, those guys are flushed out. And, uh, hitter is is a hitter is what comes down to. 5x five bagger in his last deal. Danaher uh, executive. He Danaher doesn't do dumb deals. He was trained how to do smart deals. And I don't think deals are on the horizon. and I think he's going to fix the business and uh and do it pretty quickly. Uh so that's that. With that said, we'll be back next week uh normal time uh from Newport Beach next week and uh we'll take it from there. So with that said, uh we'll be back then. In the meantime, make it a great one. Bye for now. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music]
