**Tom's Current Market Conviction: Cautious, with a preference for value outside the Magnificent 7. → 6/10** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥☆☆☆☆

- Froth in the AI trade due to retail investors buying call options.
- Declining cash flows for hyperscalers.
- High capital expenditure as a percentage of operating cash flow for hyperscalers.
- Overweighting of tech companies in the S&P 500 relative to their earnings power.

## Macro Thesis & Key Data Points
The market is experiencing froth in specific sectors like AI, while other sectors offer better value. Economic data suggests a weakening jobs picture, which could influence the Federal Reserve's actions. There's a potential shift towards value stocks and small-cap companies. Consumer sentiment is low, which historically precedes significant recoveries.

| Indicator | Value | Tom's Interpretation |
|-----------|-------|----------------------|
| Hyperscalers Free Cash Flow Decline | Down 43% between Q4 2024 and Q1 2025 | This decline raises concerns about the return on invested capital in the AI buildout. |
| Challenger US Job Cuts Announcements | Cyclical sectors starting to increase | Positive for cyclicals. |
| Small Cap PE Ratio | 16x earnings for S&P 600 vs 26x for non-profitable small caps | Focus on profitable small-cap areas. |
| Healthcare Underperformance | Cumulative 70 percentage points of healthcare underperformance in the last 50 years | This is unprecedented and reminiscent of 1999 before healthcare dramatically outperformed in 2000. |
| Consumer Sentiment Index | Consistent with recession levels | Tends to lead to huge recoveries. |

- ⚠️ Risk in clothing and apparel if a brand hasn't been around forever.
- ⚠️ Leveraged equity ETF launches are a sign of froth.
- ⚠️ Private equity and private credit crowded trades with potential for hidden risks.
- ⚠️ AI could erode the moat of software companies.

## Technical Takeaways
The S&P is back at the bottom of the trend channel in place over the last three years. If it can hold this, that's very positive. It points towards 7,000. If it cracks, there's probably going to be a little bit of work to do before it gets back up there.
