We're going to listen in here. All right, let's get right to the floor show and bring in our traders to talk about all of this and the green on the screen. Joining me now, trader Keith Fitzgerald and Great Hill Capitals, Tom Hayes. Tom, look, uh, regardless of a tarnish brand and the long-term effects of that, these back-to-back gains sure feel good, right? I mean, you've got the VIX falling again, back below, at least earlier, 28 at the moment. Yep, it's almost below 27 right now. Remember, it hit high of 60 earlier this month. Bond yields are dropping at least on the long end. What's not to love, Tom? What's not to love? This is an example of the VIX crush. And one more example of getting paid for being greedy when others were fearful. Uh you had a couple other things out there today, Liz. Uh first and foremost, you had Governor Hammock from Cleveland talking about maybe alluding to a cut in June. If the labor market deteriorates, that's confirming what Waller said. The market really likes the idea of a June Fed cut. And it's very interesting about this correction, Liz, because this was the first time that I've seen in my long career that professionals were actually more scared. They were abject uh fear two weeks ago and retail investors were actually net buyers and retail investors, believe it or not, have been the ones that are on the right side of the trade since co. They've been buying weakness and they've been right and this time will be no different. Well, uh yeah, the retail investor is buying. The hedges had been liquidating. They didn't want to be caught flatfooted or maybe some of them were. Keith Fitzgerald, you too have had a long Wall Street career. Uh what do you learn from this? Because three days in a row is really lovely, but we know that bottoming out processes take a long time. Well, they do and that's really the lesson here. I mean, it's 45 plus years for me I've been doing this and fortunately gotten a lot more right than we've gotten wrong. But you know what the lesson I take away from this is bottoming is a process. It's not a switch. There's no allcle bell when it rings. So you want to constantly play to Tom's point. You know, when others are fearful, you want to be greedy. And time and time and time again, the best companies move ahead, which is why you're seeing traders trying to get ahead of it today. Yeah. And you know, you do want to focus, Tom, on things you actually can control. And what do you feel you can control when you certainly can't control, as we put it, the he said, she said, she as in exi Xi Jinping of of China, that we really aren't sure exactly what the true story is at the moment. Yeah, Liz. Well, I I learned early in my career that good things happen to people who buy great companies when they're marked down on sale. And what you saw two weeks ago was one one of the sales of a lifetime. And people were comparing it to the great financial crisis. They were comparing it to the tech wreck. And the fact of the matter is those were years and years of excess buildup. This was started with a tweet. It could end with a tweet. We saw tweets today about positive talks with South Korea, positive talks with India. So, we want to buy highquality businesses marked down and there's still quite a few of them on sale right now. You know, the the econo data is rearview mirror looking, but we did just get durable goods, Keith, and the durable goods orders for last month skyrocketed well beyond what was expected. A lot of that was sort of front-loading, whether it was companies who were putting in a ton of orders ahead of what they perceived would be the tariffs that President Trump had threatened. So, you're looking at something like that. uh they surged 9.2% in March, well above the 2.0 forecast. So what do you suspect is happening right now and how do you not get caught uh sort of too deep in the water with certain companies that may shut down their inventory buildup? That's a very interesting question. We learned a very powerful lesson out of COVID. We used to have just in time deliveries, but what you're seeing this big surge in my takeaway is just in case. So, they're moving ahead. They're doing what they should be. And the companies that have margin power, protection power, customers actually like what they produce are going to come out of this just fine. It's the guys that are ordering, you know, the extra window cleaning solutions that you worry about because maybe they're doing it, they don't have credit, maybe they don't have the right cash flow, they're stockpiling something. That's the wrong move here. If you're doing it because of customers, then that's the stuff I'm going to be all over. Yeah. Okay. Let's talk customers. Tom, you like PayPal. This is interesting. The CEO, Alex Chris, was on stage right here at the Semaphore conference earlier today. I listened very closely to what he said. He's got 400 million customers. And what's important, I think,\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nldup. This was started with a tweet. It could end with a tweet. We saw tweets today about positive talks with South Korea, positive talks with India. So, we want to buy highquality businesses marked down and there&#39;s still quite a few of them on sale right now. You know, the the econo data is rearview mirror looking, but we did just get durable goods, Keith, and the durable goods orders for last month skyrocketed well beyond what was expected. A lot of that was sort of front-loading, whether it was companies who were putting in a ton of orders ahead of what they perceived would be the tariffs that President Trump had threatened. So, you&#39;re looking at something like that. uh they surged 9.2% in March, well above the 2.0 forecast.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nLet&#39;s talk customers. Tom, you like PayPal.\n\nthe fact that he said a lot of these customers are small businesses. And here&#39;s specifically what he said. He said, &quot;We are worried about rising costs that small business will face under the new Trump tariffs.&quot; Uh so what do you what do you see for the future of PayPal which sure is up 3% today but it has gotten hammered this month. Yeah this is still down 80% since the co highs. We love this business. Record free cash flow record revenues margins increasing as you said 425 million customers globally. When you take an Uber Liz that&#39;s PayPal that&#39;s Brainree working in the background that they own. Venmo has become the Kleenex of peer-to-peer payments. Uh, Alex Chris ran small business at into it. That was a 35 bagger stock while he was the CEO. We know he&#39;s going to turn this around. They&#39;ll generate 7 and a half billion of free cash flow this year alone. And they&#39;re going to buy back 20% of the company over the next 2 to 3 years. Your your slice of the pie is going to get bigger and bigger with no new investment. We think this is a phenomenal opportunity. Their fast lane checkout is increasing conversion for small businesses. They need it. PayPal&#39;s got it. Alex Chris is a winner. You want to bet on him for sure. Yeah. You&#39;re also betting on Boeing, which is actually up about 2%. Even as Donald Trump says Boeing should default China over return planes. China&#39;s carriers have returned, I think I think around two planes and more are coming back. They&#39;re not taking hold of them. But Keith, let&#39;s finish with you. What are you buying right now? I mean, I saw one of your favorites, Palunteer, back above 100 earlier up 101. So that&#39;s interesting. Well, I go, you know, one of the other key lessons I learned during my career, Liz, is you go where Wall Street is dumping hardest and fastest. And so, to me, it&#39;s all the big names we talked about. It&#39;s Palanteer, it&#39;s Nvidia, it&#39;s Tesla. Those companies have been punished in recent weeks, I think, unfairly. Yet, every single one of those businesses is continuing to power forward. I think is worth considerably more in the future. Tesla in particular, 3 to 5x the end of the decade. Oh, man. Palanteer&#39;s at 106 and change right now. Yeah, that is one interesting moving target. It is. It is. And it&#39;s a great company to latch on to because it&#39;s doing all the right things at the right time that still doesn&#39;t have any viable competition. And if you look at customers, they&#39;re running to it, not away from it. Gotcha. Yeah, we see that now. Hey, it&#39;s great to have you both. Keith, Tom, we&#39;ll see you again soon. Thank you. And we&#39;re back. Now, let&#39;s go to some of these uh incredible indicators that we look at every week and get through some of the data. Uh first and foremost, want to take a look at the put call coming down. That&#39;s what I referenced. Also, the VIX crush. When it goes above 50 and drops below, you tend to get rallies. You&#39;re starting to see a lot of breath. The PMO by all, we cover a lot. PMO by S&amp;P. We don&#39;t care about PMOs. It&#39;s just indicative of something that&#39;s turning in the market. It&#39;s just the like the 50-day uh 200 day uh crosses that people think make make a big difference. They don&#39;t. Uh one that we do spend a lot of time on is option skew. So the smart money buying catastrophic insurance has withered to nothing. It was very very elevated um beforehand. And you can see here the Nazi summation and the uh MLEN are turning up uh as well as these two as well. So everything is starting to look healthier again now that the administration is backing off. We&#39;re going to cover that. But if you feel like you missed everything, wake up and smell the roses because there are still, as I shared with Liz, so many amazing companies that are still on sale. And I&#39;m not pointing anything out, but this is just the Dow to give you an idea. Like some of these businesses that have been marked down. We don&#39;t own any of these. Uh, United Health, Chevron, Amgen, Merc, Cisco, etc., etc. So yeah, companies are starting to rebound a little bit. Nike we&#39;ve talked a lot about. Um and some of the defensives are starting to get weaker like the Coca-Cas, the Pepsis, etc. So people are coming in from the thaw and jumping back into the market. We even saw some tech which we discover got discussed a couple of weeks ago. We said I think uh Mag 7 could trade back to the top of the range but probably not more this year. I think that is beginning right now. You&#39;re seeing some Meta, some Google, etc. Starbucks is still marked down. There&#39;s a lot of amazing stuff to do here and we&#39;re going to talk about a bunch more on this call. Intel unveils turnaround plan seeking to go back to his engineering roots with lip boo tan. You know, I was sharing actually with Jerry last night. I&#39;m always talking stocks and uh I said look you know the beauty of of Nvidia is they&#39;re great at designing GPUs. The bad news is that their business model depends on the kindness of strangers and so do all the chip designers and that stranger happens to be Taiwan Semiconductor. Now Taiwan Semiconductor said hey we&#39;re going to put 500 billion in the US. Oh good luck. You know we&#39;ll talk to you in five years after you get your zoning and you break ground and you hire all the people etc etc etc. Intel is at the 5 yard line and ready to go. They fired Gellzinger at the exact wrong time. Uh Lip Bhutan&#39;s going to take it from the 5yard line over to the touchdown. Uh Nvidia is currently testing chips, etc. They&#39;re cutting 20% of the workforce. They&#39;re getting lean and mean, and they&#39;re going to go back to designing absolutely incredible products and manufacturing products for not only the Nvidas of the world. And it&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve talked to experts that know Intel well, and they said the demand for GPUs is going to be so unlimited that it&#39;s not only going to be Nvidia, assuming Nvidia can get theirs produced. And the the bottleneck for doing that, they&#39;ve got to go through Intel or TSMC. And the reason their growth has declined, growth rate has declined, is because Taiwan Semiconductor can only give them an extra four billion dollars a quarter. So unless they find new production centers like Intel, uh their growth is going to growth rate is going to continue to decline because the base keeps getting bigger and they&#39;re only allocated 4 billion of growth per quarter. So, that&#39;s where Intel comes in. And I&#39;m so excited to listen to the uh earnings call and um Lip Bhutan&#39;s plan on the way home on the uh on the airplane and um and that will be key. The other thing that I spoke to about with Liz was the odds of a June cut going up. Uh, as you can see here, it&#39;s around 63 62%. So, that&#39;s been vacasillating from 70 to 50. That came from Waller talking about if uh jobs start to get lost. And that was confirmed by the Cleveland Fed governor today. And that&#39;s part of the reason that the market was up as well as good news on South Korea talks, good news on India talks. Trump this week talking about taking down the China tariffs to get something done and saying that there were talks happening this morning. The Chinese are like we we don&#39;t know anything about those talks but okay. Uh but it shows and I think the key pivot point uh after the 90-day pause was meeting with the CEOs of Target, Walmart, Home Depot this morning and getting a sense of like, hey man, you know, we&#39;d love to uh manufacture sneakers in Mississippi, but at the end of the day, uh the economics just don&#39;t work if we&#39;re not paying the workers $2 an hour. So, uh I think there&#39;s going to be a great compromise. uh and that great great compromise. The media may portray it as Trump softening, but the joke is going to be on the media in that he&#39;s going to wind up with tens of billions of dollars, if not a couple hundred billion dollars of revenue for the country that we wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. and do it in a sensible way such that uh we can get some clarity sooner so businesses can actually start to plan because capex has grown to a halt and uh and and businesses can start to feel confident and consumers can start to feel confident. So, they&#39;ll probably get their first quarter of negative GDP, but they&#39;re my sense is they&#39;re getting worried about getting a second quarter because if they get a second quarter of negative GDP, you got a technical recession and that&#39;s going to cost a lot more than what they&#39;ve saved on Doge or they&#39;ve raised from their external revenue service and it will all have been for absolute not and a complete waste of everyone&#39;s time and hurt a lot of retirees who probably sold in the hole two weeks ago and certainly a lot of hedge funds that were selling when they should have been buying or at the very least holding. Problem is they all run too much leverage so they got their asses handed to them. And uh it&#39;s the same story every single time. So, uh\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKorea talks, good news on India talks.

Problem is they all run too much leverage so they got their asses handed to them. And uh it&#39;s the same story every single time. So, uh\nmoving along . Uh we&#39;ve covered this for the last few weeks. I&#39;ve handheld you through this tumultuous period. I said, &quot;Hang on with your white knuckles, ladies and gentlemen. This two shall pass.&quot; And uh and that&#39;s starting to happen. It doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re not going back down to retest the lows. I&#39;d say the probability is lower now. That&#39;s for sure. But this was the one. If you remember uh three weeks ago, I&#39;m like, &quot;Guys, look, I I don&#39;t spend much time on technicals, but I shared this chart with a friend uh who was a little queasy there in the middle of it.&quot; And and by the way, he was one of the more optimistic of my friends. Uh some of them were really, really nervous and understandably so. Uh and I said, &quot;Look, you know, if this holds, we&#39;re probably doing okay.&quot; and and it immediately shot up that that the next day when Trump was like, &quot;Uh, buy now.&quot; I mean, we&#39;ve got a stock promoter and chief. Uh, and then, uh, we went back. It looked like we were going to retest, which we we had told you here that that was a possibility looking back at 2011 as an analog, and we also talked about the 2018 analog. Uh, and then it did that, and now it&#39;s working up higher. And I think you&#39;re now going to start to see a little bit of fear of loss. That&#39;s not to say no damage has been done, ladies and gentlemen. We are seeing some good earnings. We&#39;re seeing some mixed earnings. We&#39;re seeing two track guidances. If if he continues to do I if the craziness continues, here&#39;s what our earnings will look like in a recession, which is guaranteed. Uh or if they cut bait and do something re rational, uh we&#39;re actually cooking and we will report good numbers and we will continue to invest. And now that&#39;s starting to look like a possibility again with all of the news that we&#39;ve shared. This is looking like recovery. That&#39;s the So we did the the 15minute the 60 minute. I swear I haven&#39;t pulled up 15 minute and 60 minute charts in probably since the lows in 2022, which was the last time I ever came on this and said if you were going to put money to work with us, existing clients adding money, uh new clients getting started, now is the time. And the only other time that I&#39;ve done that is two weeks ago uh at the lows in early April. Uh and um and looking at all the opportunity, it it couldn&#39;t it really couldn&#39;t still be a better time. I mean, it&#39;s just phenomenal. Here&#39;s the daily, then the weekly, you know, weekly still you can see it. And then the monthly, barely a blip on the chart, but boy did that feel pretty abrupt for a moment there.\n\nI think you&#39;re now going to start to see a little bit of fear of loss.

Not everyone has the stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds altogether. That&#39;s from the legendary Peter Lynch. Uh Charlie Munger, another mentor uh in in my view by reading and assimilating. Same with Warren. Uh it&#39;s the waiting that helps you as an investor and a lot of people just can&#39;t stand to wait. It&#39;s amazing. People, you know, texting me in the last couple weeks, wow, it&#39;s green today. Feels so good. Like we don&#39;t think ever in terms of days or weeks. We think in terms of months and years. Uh, so you know, Monday was a down day. I mean, honestly, the down days have been more exciting than the up up days because there&#39;s something to do. We can buy stocks. The up days, it&#39;s just like, okay, we got all the stocks we&#39;re going to have. Here we go. We&#39;re going higher. We got enough in the hole. We&#39;re excited. And so on. So, and that&#39;s the way you learn to think about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve I think it&#39;s been a very rare occurrence in my career where I&#39;ve bought stocks on a green day. There have been a couple of times, but um we always buy when it&#39;s red. So games are won by players who focus on the playing field, not by those whose eyes are glued on the scoreboard. And so many get distracted by looking at they spend their time looking at price on a daily basis. And when I get distracted by price because hedge funds are blowing up, pensions are for sellers, uh margin people are getting margin clerk calls and liquidations, uh I just go to the free cash flow and I&#39;m like, &quot;Huh, their cash flow keeps growing. I wonder why the price is going down so much in the short term. I better buy some more.&quot; Uh and and sure enough, that&#39;s always the right call. When the intrinsic value of the business goes up and the price goes down, if you play that arbitrage, uh you&#39;ll get rich over time. I mean, it&#39;s just that simple if you&#39;re patient and if you manage risk through not using a lot of leverage and very few people can do that because you know what is everyone asking me about is everyone&#39;s asking me about all the stocks that are in the\n\nthe scoreboard. And so many get distracted by looking at they spend their time looking at price on a daily basis. And when I get distracted by price because hedge funds are blowing up, pensions are for sellers, uh margin people are getting margin clerk calls and liquidations, uh I just go to the free cash flow and I&#39;m like, \"Huh, their cash flow keeps growing. I wonder why the price is going down so much in the short term. I better buy some more.\" Uh and and sure enough, that&#39;s always the right call.

I mean, it&#39;s just that simple if you&#39;re patient and if you manage risk through not using a lot of leverage and very few people can do that because you know what is everyone asking me about is everyone&#39;s asking me about all the stocks that are in the\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines . They have to ask me about Tesla. They have to ask me about Nvidia. And the companies that are the best are the ones like Boeing that were completely forgotten. And you had another chance to buy it at $129 two weeks ago. and we went on Vanney and we went on all the shows and people were like, \"Well, they&#39;re getting all their parts. Give me an effing break, ladies and gentlemen.\" At the end of the day, you know, the biggest joke I I I loved being on Vanney in real time when that headline came across that the Chinese are refusing are refusing Boeing deliveries. I mean, the Chinese refusing Boeing deliveries is like a diabetic refusing insulin. They need our planes way more than we need their sales already. India&#39;s like, \"We&#39;ll take them.\" Uh, can you paint over them and, you know, put India Airways or whatever they&#39;ve got over there, Jet Jet Airways, uh, uh, on the plane? And they&#39;re like, \"Yeah, we&#39;ll absolutely, we&#39;ll help you. Oh, by the way, China, you want to lose your place in line, you can get back when this tariff thing is negotiated, you can get back at the end of the line and wait 20 years for your next plane.\" Oh, you got Comarmac. They delivered a whopping 13 planes last year. uh you know, let me clear my throat. That&#39;s uh not gonna cut it. So, China is making a mistake there. Uh and um not the first, won&#39;t be the last. Uh but look, we&#39;ve made our share of mistakes as well. And uh they sooner or later, the universal thing, whether you&#39;re in the United States or around the world, is politicians always make the right decision after exhausting every other possibility. And this time will be no different. All right, let&#39;s get to our data charts.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nEveryone says that place. By the way, want to thank um Terry H. You know who you are. And obviously Robert for uh S for putting together such an incredible and Desiree for putting together such an incredible list of things to do. We literally packed every minute that we could. uh you know, did all the snorkeling, did all the excursions, did everything, went to all the right restaurants. Uh and it&#39;s very rare that the girls get a week off training, so we had to jump on it. And very grateful for making it uh super memorable. Uh okay, let&#39;s talk about this some data. We love to do data. Burden ourselves with the fact share of Chinese exports to the US is 14%. So it&#39;s relatively dimminimous. It&#39;s even more diminishous for China these days. Another rare signal that better times could be coming. This is from Carson. Uh S&P performance after three consecutive 1% gains. And you look a month out 1.3 6 months out 9% 12 months out 14%. I love his anecdotes and data that he puts out. He does a really good job. Uh forward 12 month PE ratio at the sector level. Obviously, you can see that uh energy is still the cheapest financials. Healthcare, there&#39;s a lot of opportunity there. Those are going to start to bounce aggressively. Friend sent over an amazing note on biotech. I think biotech&#39;s getting to ready to rip despite Maha and uh Robert Kennedy Jr. I think that part of the solutions for the problem are going to come from innovative biotech companies and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll get that sorted. Uh and better food and all the the great things that they&#39;re talking about as well. Uh, Peter Lynch, the key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them. Uh, here are flows into money market and cash ETFs. Uh, always when it gets this high, you find yourself at or near a huge buying opportunity and a low. World XUS equities versus the S&P 500. You can see here breaking out, breaking this downtrend line. This is a theme that we came in at the beginning of the year pounding the hell out of the table. Get some international exposure. If not China, at least get some emerging markets, get some exus, get some Europe. And they&#39;ve dramatically outperformed. I think XUS is up 6.6% on the year. While the US has been down, albeit coming uh down less and less by the minute. China&#39;s broad budget deficit soarses the first quarter. Uh what that means in English is they are doing massive stimulus spending. They want to move as we covered in recent podcasts from you know 50 some odd percent consumption to 70% consumption within 10 years. US wants to move manufacturing back up to a higher percentage. Uh and that&#39;s rebalance is where a deal is made. Then you look at affordability of vehicles down to 36.7%. By the way, everyone&#39;s sending me like, \"Oh yeah, March, they shot the lights out. You&#39;ve never seen so much car production, which is going to be amazing for Cooper Standard free cash flow.\" Uh, but then they expect April and May to fall off a cliff. April and May aren&#39;t going to fall off a cliff because number one, there&#39;s still the urgency to to get in uh ahead of time. And number two, they now have worked down the inventories and they&#39;re going to have to replenish the inventories on top of it. This is going to continue as well as huge lobbying groups going to Washington and it looks like Trump is going to find some middle ground for the suppliers and for the automakers uh which will be a big deal. Uh margin debt expansion versus contraction indicator. We are nowhere near the extremes you see at or near tops. That&#39;s a good thing, not a bad thing. Dollar was another theme, weak dollar coming into the year, worst start to the year basically on record. Uh, everyone starting to get bearish the dollar. You&#39;re seeing some covers. We&#39;re going to cover the economist. Uh, everyone bearish the dollar, which means we&#39;re probably due for a bounce. It will be a counter trend rally. Get ready for that. Uh,\n\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nGet some international exposure. If not China, at least get some emerging markets, get some exus, get some Europe. And they&#39;ve dramatically outperformed. I think XUS is up 6.6% on the year. While the US has been down, albeit coming uh down less and less by the minute. China&#39;s broad budget deficit soarses the first quarter. Uh what that means in English is they are doing massive stimulus spending.

Japan&#39;s core inflation accelerates, complicating bank, bank of Japan&#39;s rate path if they have to keep raising. Carry trade continues to unwind, which is why we don&#39;t think the mag seven are going to get back above the top of the channel. But there&#39;s a long way between here and the top of the channel because they were the hit hit the hardest as was one of our key themes coming into the year. Go back and listen to our November and December podcasts. price to fair value estimate by economic moat rating across size and style. All this says in English is small cap with wide moat according to the morning star ratings has the greatest discount to fair value i.e. the most undervalued. If you don&#39;t have small cap exposure and you&#39;re skeptical because it hasn&#39;t worked yet, this would be a time to get on board in our view. Again, all of this is opinion, not advice. Go to Headed Headund Tips and read headfundtips.com and click on the terms right there. Basically, it says it&#39;s for entertainment. Don&#39;t do anything. Talk to your financial advisor, etc., etc. Premium beverage. We are spending more on alcohol but drinking less. This is the whole theme of the Diagio narrative, which we&#39;ve discussed in past podcasts. People&#39;s interest in escaping is never going to change. And if they&#39;re drinking less, they&#39;re going to want higher quality, higher premium. And that&#39;s where you benefit from doing the Dagios relative to the constellations or other type of companies in the category. The best and worst days are usually close to each other. That&#39;s why if you&#39;re out of the market or you think you time you you screw up twice because one you sell in the hole and then you think you&#39;re going to buy lower and it winds up moving against you. So you miss the gains back up so you double lose. It&#39;s the way people blow up and never never get ahead.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nHere are all the economies. Here are all the covers on the economist. How a dollar crisis could unfold. So probably get a bounce in the dollar soon. The envy of the world, the US. So they&#39;re talking about the end of US exceptionalism. We&#39;ve covered in the past. We do think international is going to outperform because it runs in 10 to 15 year cycles. But that doesn&#39;t mean US exceptionalism in the broad context will not continue. Never in the history of humankind has a greater company been created. And the reason is is because number one we were blessed with resources. Number two, we were blessed with oceans on both side for defense. But number three and the most important is we got the best ideas from everyone every other country in the world all converged on one great place called America and with hard work with a dream with a risk-taking DNA for them to take that chance to come to a new country. And the only thing that will hurt US exceptionalism is if we stop allowing great people from around the country who are hungry and looking for opportunity from coming in legally but coming in in good numbers which has been our magic formula for success for you know hundreds of years and will continue to be moving forward. But our stocks might underperform for a decade or so. That&#39;s okay. uh they&#39;ll still do great housing supply and if you&#39;re under the surface in the unmagnificent 493 and small caps fortunes are going to be made. This is the type of environment where uh just insane amounts of money are made just like Cooperman and Buffett and Gabelli did in the 70s uh once the Nifty50 uh started to underperform just fortunes were made on a stockby stock basis. Billions. Billions. That&#39;s that&#39;s where they all became billionaires. Housing supply hits 5-year high. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s going to help with prices. Wait till they continue to open the federal lands and then all the things are going to happen. The housing supply, QXO, Stanley, GenerRack, etc., etc. Frontloading is being mainly channeled through air freight, S&P lags, uh, international by the most in 32 years. You know for six months we told you coming into this year that this is not going to last forever. Start getting international, getting emerging markets. In our case getting China by the way update on China for clients. Uh they started the transfer of all US shares to Hong Kong shares. It usually takes it should be done overnight. Um so the first step was done where they get the placeholder and then you get converted out. It&#39;s 8:1 US because the Hong Kong US dollar is pegged at 8 to1 conversion. So you don&#39;t have currency risk. You&#39;ll just get eight more shares for every US share. The price will be the same because the uh fixed US Hong Kong dollar peg. Uh so we&#39;re doing that to hedge. We we think it will be an unnecessary hedge, but we&#39;re keeping 100% of our options in the US because there&#39;s no way to replicate in uh Hong Kong. And uh but our options bucket has always been the huge high expected value and willingness to uh take our our risk is quantified by our sizing and then the stock we&#39;re not willing to accept that risk. So Navaro and all the hawks can do whatever the hell they want. we are uh set up because even if the options um get impacted uh the stock will more than make up for it over time because the fundamentals of the business continue to improve. They continue to generate huge cash flow 25 billion 20 25 billion a year. Uh leader in AI leader in middle class recovery leader in everything that we&#39;ve covered and um one of the lowest multiples relative to growth. It&#39;s it&#39;s such an incredible story and we&#39;re so grateful to be a part of it. And we&#39;re grateful to Xi Jinping for taking so long to clean things up because it enabled us to have twice the size position that we would have had if he fixed it right away. 37% of US imports from China are intermediate goods used in US production. So that&#39;s why both parties need a deal. That&#39;s why the Navaro has been hidden under a rock and Lutnik and Besson has been at the forefront because they figured out uh that um it&#39;s not as black and white as it seems and more rational heads need to come to the table to rebalance but not to flip everything on its head which ultimately winds up hurting us. So we&#39;re going to get a lot of extraction here. We&#39;re going to get a lot of benefits. It&#39;s probably net net potentially good if it resolves right that we went in this direction. How we did it is up for debate and I&#39;m the first one to admit that. Uh the fact that we did do it probably needed to be done. Uh and um and I think it&#39;s going to resolve like like I said all through the crisis when everyone&#39;s hair was on fire is welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0. a new tweet, new set of volatility resolves to the upside over time.

Welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New tweet, new volatility resolves to the upside over time. Okay. Um,here is  the estimated global position of systematic metro. These are the CTAs that got smoked, all sold in the hole at the exact wrong time, just like they did during COVID. And then they&#39;ll have to chase up on the way up as deals are announced and everyone sees that there was a method to the madness. We&#39;re going to be very nice. Trump vows lower tariffs on China. So down from 145 to lower to start negotiations then you know I don&#39;t know they said they aren&#39;t meeting. He says he&#39;s not lowering tariffs but it just keeps getting leaked. So there&#39;s probably a reason for that structural breakout for the euro. This is something that people didn&#39;t expect. The looney is going up as well. These are other themes that we&#39;ve been consistently pounding the table. Retail net buying of S&amp;P 500 single stocks. Like I said hedge funds were the morons selling in the hole. Retail were buying. They&#39;ve been right since COVID. They&#39;ll continue to be right. Dollar most overvalued since the Plaza Accord. We&#39;ve laid out the idea of a Mara Lago accord and probably part of a package deal will be an accepted deval of currency in lie of higher tariffs just like happened at the Plaza Hotel in 1988. Well, it was it&#39;s the second term. I think it was first quarter of 1988. It&#39;s the second term might have been 86. Second term of uh Reagan. Uh Tesla net income dropping.

Uh again, probably unnecessarily, but just need to do it in the case of prudence. Um that&#39;s that. uh equity sector flows starting to flow back into technology.

We said get ready after August once they this the uh stock connect opens for BABA and mainland Chinese investors can buy Alibaba for the first time ever. Imagine being able to buy Amazon for the first time ever. Uh it&#39;s going to continue to flow and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened. 20 some odd billion dollars and probably a lot more to come. Prices bottom before earnings in bare markets. So earnings probably will continue to come down because of all the capex that stopped in the last 3 weeks. You could say necessarily or unnecessarily depending on your views. But bottom line, it froze up a lot of capex spending. I hope it&#39;s worth it. Uh but so expect more bad news about earnings and guidance and and uh probably the the markets bottomed uh in anticipation of that if we don&#39;t retest the lows. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to go much lower than where where we hit uh in early April as I said two weeks ago. Um and we went through the analoges of 2018 and 2011 etc. Traders Cloud 6.6 billion into leverage long ETFs. Median gross margin is uh recovered from 2022. A little bit of step back here uh but headed back towards record. We&#39;ll see if that can be sustained. That&#39;s going to depend a lot on tariffs. M&amp;A is slowing. Okay. So, this is having knock-on effects that we&#39;re going to hear about for the next 3 months. Just like COVID market bottomed in uh March 23rd, 2020.

Negative headlines\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\nThe market was already up 50%. Uh buyback authorizations have increased 19% year-to date. Not only are they buying their own shares in this uncertainty, but corporate insiders are buying a lot of stock. uh Zwag breath thrust which we recently had uh three 1 month later market up 5% 3 months later 8.6% 6 months later 16% these are all averages uh one year later 23%. So, a lot of things have happened in recent weeks that point to very good things happening over the next 6 to 12 months. And based on some of the rational headed comments coming out of the White House, uh that that looks like a decent probability. Now, cash-like ETFs, but look, when the robins are singing, it&#39;s already spring, you know, and in many cases, you missed it. Uh, in this case, there&#39;s still enough to do, but uh, really my hat is off for all of the existing clients uh, and new clients that put in new money when I said now&#39;s the time. Uh, and those who held their wits about them as well, whether if you weren&#39;t in a position to put in new money, maybe you have a lot of illquid private equity and other things that you couldn&#39;t get out of. Um, kudos for just hanging tough and know trusting the process and knowing the intrinsic value of the businesses you own was intact and uh and now they&#39;re rebounding and and off to off to the races. Whether we hit new highs in four months or eight months, it&#39;s it&#39;s really immaterial. The key is you held pat when so many others flushed in the hole. Uh particularly hedge funds to be honest with you. Uh all these cowboys that were on super long levered long mag 7, they&#39;re smoked and most of them are liquidating and now out of business. S&P 500 returns a year after spike in policy uncertainty index. Uh with the exception of 2001 which was 911 and 2006 which was the housing crisis the other 89 instances have been monstrous between 9.7% and 63%. That&#39;s amazing. scorecard on buying the dip. Average return for S&P 500 following drop of at least 5% over two days. 200 days later, you&#39;re up 10%. So again, China firms announced biggest buyback in 14 months. That includes Alibaba. Insider buying and selling. Uh insiders now starting to buy in a material way. That&#39;s uh very very key. Number of containers ships selling from China to the US. So that&#39;s dropped off quite a bit. That&#39;s why that that should get everyone to the table here to come up with something reasonable uh which does you know can help China achieve what they want to do which is more domestic consumption and help the US what we we want to do slightly more domestic manufacturing active listings on the rise for real estate new home sales top all estimates on surge in the south uh all the federal lands are going to be open we showed you the map a few weeks ago southwest as a matter of In fact, there&#39;s a ton of federal land here on the Big Island, and I was telling the helicopter pilot, maybe Trump&#39;s going to open it up for development. They didn&#39;t want to hear that. It&#39;s always nimi, not in my backyard. But, uh, I can imagine that they would be in high demand if they started to do that. A AI bull bear spread below 20. So, this is a record, uh, level of bearishness. That&#39;s obviously inflection points. Soft data has recently surprised to the downside amid hard data resilience. So people are getting more negative even though the data is showing strength. The actual data spending growth is not weakened among the highest income households. Higher income households own around 90% of all corporate equities and mutual funds. That&#39;s the top 20% in income quintile. That&#39;s a big quintile by the way. Total return over 30 years. Gold versus the S&P 500. not even close for everyone chasing gold. Uh S&P has dramatically uh outperformed. Manufacturing employment as a share of total employment has been declining steadily for 80 years even after the US MCA. Past two weeks have seen historic breath. This is from Carson. Good things happened 12 months out all year since 1950 up about double digits. Personnel is policy. So as Bessant has taken the helm, returns have been positive. As Lenik and Navaro had spoken, returns have been negative. Equity leadership cycles and peaks, US versus developed markets, US versus emerging markets. You can see we are at an absolute extreme. And yes, it started dramatic outperformance in the first quarter this year. This is just the beginning of the beginning. This is like the introduction to the book and then like the prologue. Like we&#39;re not even in chapter one. So, if you don&#39;t have international exposure, as we&#39;ve been pounding the table on, and the right international exposure, uh, you&#39;re not going to do as well as you&#39;ve done looking in the rearview mirror through looking through the windshield. Moving forward, White House considers slashing China tariffs to deescalate trade war. China signals openness to US trade talks, but not under duress. for our country. China&#39;s patriots are buying the dip in equities. US chip controls will benefit China&#39;s Nvidia rivals like Huawei say analysts. Of course they will. China Tech groups unintended consequences of emotional policymaking. China Tech groups and by the way Deepseek and Quinn 2.5 all of these LLMs that are that are absolutely destroying chat GPT and others were made by necessity, not by design per se. Um uh the chips that they&#39;re developing internally, all this stuff wouldn&#39;t have happened. We could have kept them dependent on us. Instead, we forced them to innovate. Uh, which is kind of against what they&#39;ve done historically. They prefer to copy. But now, we&#39;ve forced them to innovate and now they&#39;re forced to be reckoned because they&#39;re they&#39;re eating our lunch in AI. And, uh, and that trend is going to continue. Uh, China tech groups lead multi-billion dollar campaign to help exporters sell at home domestic consumption. Who&#39;s the toll taker? 40 cents of every dollar? Ali effing baba. Okay. China accelerates budget spending to counter tariff wos. Huge stimulus spending. Uh Baba is going to be the biggest toll taker there. Hong Kong stock rise on China stimulus. Hope ignore Wall Street selloff. Auto groups lobby Trump administration against parts tariffs in rare unified message. So this is a big deal for Cooper Standard. US officials mole easing tariffs target the auto industry. Uh March sees best new vehicle affordability in 45 months, but tariffs loom and large. Uh we know that except they&#39;ve got to now replenish the inventory. So the game is on. Trump&#39;s U-turns on Powell. China follow dire economic warnings. Trump team needs a trade deal to stop investor panic. That&#39;s from Charlie Gaspirino over at Fox Business. He&#39;s right. I think we probably get one from India or we probably get one from South Korea or we probably get one from Japan. But we get one and then everyone falls in line and we rock and roll. Vietnam kicks off trade talks with us as plain deal takes shape. Uh they&#39;ll get some of Chinese planes. It&#39;s hedge funds, not foreign investors that have been dumping stocks, says JP Morgan. Hartnet amid apocalyptic sentiment, a bullish road map emerges. He&#39;s one of the best strategists on the street from Bank of America. We we cite his Bank of America fund manager survey every single month. Deutsche Bank sees major dollar decline amid selloff. That&#39;s typical European pessimists always downgrade in the hole. Uh even though we remain uh intermediate term bearish on the dollar based on the type of people getting bearish after the fact, I expect a short-term bounce in the dollar. Boeing to sell some of its navigation business in $10.55 billion deal. So you add the cash at $24 billion plus the undrawn credit line of10 billion plus the uh sale now of $10.5 billion about net 10 after taxes coming to Boeing. Uh you&#39;ve got $44 billion of liquidity with $53 billion of debt. So the rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated for everyone who had been saying Boeing could go bankrupt. You&#39;ve got brain damage. Uh Boeing&#39;s got a half a trillion dollar backlog and you were the ones that were selling at 130 and now it&#39;s at 173 going to 250 and beyond.

But um I think the bottom is in or or certainly I wouldn&#39;t expect more than a retest, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect that. I I think 5100 test would look good. Or we could blast right through on good news, which would really take everyone by surprise, which would also be pretty exciting because we did enough buying in the hole. Um that&#39;s the weekly. Here&#39;s the dollar. Probably goes a little lower. Everyone&#39;s getting pessimistic. Maybe it finds some support here, bounces back up, and then everyone will when everyone gets bullish on the dollar again, that&#39;s when we&#39;ll resume the downtrend. Gold at a Fibonacci extension level. I I don&#39;t I could care less about gold. It&#39;s a nonpro productive asset. But you&#39;re just betting on some sucker coming in after you and paying a higher price. Uh usually it&#39;s the central banks that buy at the top. I love when people say, &quot;Oh, the central banks are buying.&quot; They&#39;re always the last ones to buy right before the top and then you&#39;re going to get some Mara Lago accord or some deval of the dollar and that will be it. That&#39;ll be the final harrah and gold will be dormant for another 5 to 10 years. Um, and you know what, I&#39;m a stock guy. Don&#39;t even take that take that with a grain of salt. I could care less what happens to gold prices. So, if it keeps going higher, God bless. Hope you make a ton of money. Keep buying high and hoping to sell it to someone else higher. Um, but not for us. cleared for takeoff\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nRBC . Let&#39;s take a look at some of the technicals because we&#39;re in crazy times. We have to look at the silly charts. So, uh we probably hit some resistance here coming up next week. This downtrend line at 48 5484. Now that everyone&#39;s happy, we probably go up a little more. Maybe we retest 5100. Maybe we don&#39;t. But um I think the bottom is in or or certainly I wouldn&#39;t expect more than a retest, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect that. I I think 5100 test would look good. Or we could blast right through on good news, which would really take everyone by surprise, which would also be pretty exciting because we did enough buying in the hole. Um that&#39;s the weekly.

Um, but not for us. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nstock market and sentiment results . Here&#39;s Boeing. Uh, you know, this is all known. We know what was happening. We just we&#39;ve just basically covered the liquidity. We&#39;ve covered the key points. They&#39;re turning the corner. Their free cash flow was negative, but it&#39;s going to be positive by the second half. It was much less negative than anticipated. That was the biggest news. The production is looking good. The engineering focus is looking good. The backlog increased to over a half a trillion dollars this quarter. And uh up until a few days ago, you couldn&#39;t give the stock away. Now people are getting the message and they&#39;ll really be chasing after it after it hits 200 when no one wanted it when we were on Vney at 130. So [Music] um it&#39;s not that often you get to buy such a clear duopoly at such low prices. I mean something like that happens a couple times in a career and uh and it just recently happened. So I hope you all took advantage. That&#39;s one of our largest positions, by the way, in the US. Uh [Music] um maybe I have to check that. It may it might be as it might almost be the size of Cooper Standard. Maybe more. I got to check where that is now. Um not for long though. Cooper&#39;s Cooper&#39;s going to be way more than a double. I can assure you that. That&#39;s our our view on that. We&#39;ve covered that many times. Uh so free cash flow usage was good. commercial backlog grew by more than 25 billion. Okay, let me just get this thing going here. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have my proper mouse with me down in Hawaii. 787 production starting to increase. 7 737 at 38 going to 42. Uh then 52 is where it was at peak back in 2018. They&#39;ll get back there with approvals over time. Uh tariff exposure, they basically went through that and [Music] uh talked about the impact. It&#39;s it&#39;s not as material as people were afraid of. Net annual impact of tariffs on input costs is less than $500 million annually. That&#39;s very very important. That&#39;s kind of dimminimous for a company of this size. Uh and the deals are probably going to get better. They got the digital aviation solutions sold to Toma Bravo. Uh 777X received FAA authorization for additional aerodynamic brakes and engine testing with daily flights ongoing and performing well. Uh, and obviously they got the big F f47 contract worth $50 billion with the US government and this time it&#39;s going to be a profitable contract versus previous fixedpric contracts that carried undue risk and turned into money losing ventures. Uh, all six KPIs continue to perform well and show stability with every m metric currently in the green including final ticketing which had been below required thresholds during Q4. Uh you can go through the earnings call. We highlighted the important parts here and let me just see if there&#39;s anything else. Sentiment as you can see all the active managers got washed out at the lows. 35% equity exposure. Now, this is going to turn around and move back up to 100 and then everyone will want it and that&#39;s when you can lighten up in the short term. REITs uh top 30 weights estimates in the last 60 days. Um down 2.93% for 2025, up for next year. So, we&#39;re going to start to see a lot of backend loaded stuff. Utilities, let&#39;s see what they did. Um down 64 basis points. That&#39;s not bad. These estimates will continue to come down on a lagged effect from the tariff stuff, but the bottom may have priced in the worst and then they&#39;ll start to recover over time like we see in every major 20% correction. Uh economic data, nothing really crazy. Durable goods orders were f unbelievable. a lot of pull forward that cars that that cash flow is going to help Cooper uh up 9.2% versus 2.1%. A lot of that&#39;s car related, durables excluding defense up 10.4%. This was a big big deal. Uh initial jobless claims 222,000. That&#39;s why you&#39;ve got Waller and the Cleveland governor out talking about June as a possible cut if jobs if we start to lose jobs. Atlanta GDP Fed now has got the uh administration\n\nThey got the digital aviation solutions sold to Toma Bravo. 777X received FAA authorization for additional aerodynamic brakes and engine testing with daily flights ongoing and performing well.

Atlanta GDP Fed now has got the administration finally on alert. You&#39;re getting your negative first quarter probably of GDP. So get your act together or you&#39;re going to get two quarters and the recession is going to cost you more than all the trouble you&#39;ve caused uh in terms of Doge and in terms of tariffs. uh the cost uh and the amount of spending you&#39;ll have to do to get us out of a recession is going to dwarf what you have made in tariffs and what you have made in Doge cuts. So the moral of the story is take yes for an answer. Take the win. You&#39;ve got more tariffs than you&#39;ve ever had. Uh and you can save a recession if you pivot very quickly and businesses can start to invest again and it will be a good thing all around and you will look like a hero. But push it harder and get a recession and then you got double triple loss. Uh and you get wiped out in the midterms completely handcuffed for the for the remaining two years if you screw this up. So um that&#39;s that. You can see 20 26 estimates going up. Uh 2025 haven&#39;t really come down a lot. I mean the most optimistic was ever 275 sometime late last year. So down to 267, it&#39;s not a huge hit. Those will probably keep coming down and next year we&#39;ll keep coming up, which should be able to stabilize the market because the market may be able to look through that.\n\non alert.

Um, the problem here is  what I hate about what they did is they went crazy on the uh the weed trade when there all that hype was there and they got shellacked. Um, they chased a trend versus sticking to their knitting and it hurt them badly, but probably not badly enough for the stock to be down this much. So, I do like it here, Drew. I think you&#39;re on your game and I I think your time is pretty good. um you know, if you bought a bunch at 53, even if it went down to 40 before it starts to recover, I think you&#39;re in good shape.\n\nBrad K asks, &quot;Alcoa, AA, this has always been a really bad business and a poorly run business. So I&#39;m going to just say no because I&#39;ve seen so many opportunities to buy it and uh passed every time and invariably was proved correct. Um they do seem to be inflecting here. I just fig they seem to chronic and and again this just comes from experience. There&#39;s something cultural about Alcoa that they continue to seem to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory over and over and over. Maybe this time&#39;s different. If there&#39;s a new CEO, maybe take another look. But um this is a business that I&#39;ve never owned and never regretted not owning. Let&#39;s put it that way. Uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet. I remember they used to have that CEO with the accent who would come on every single quarter and Wall Street uh till his eyes were brown. but he had such a sophisticated accent that they believed all his and he lost them so much money that eventually they kicked him out and he had to go build this fake town for Saudi Arabia that doesn&#39;t even exist now. Uh and um he did as good a job with that project as he did with Alcoa and uh needless to say the city does not exist and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s running the project anymore. Um next week we&#39;ll cover how Tom really feels about a company. Uh let&#39;s just talk here. So revenues seem to be ramping up. Earnings inflecting from being negative. Ebida is starting to recover. It&#39;s just so inconsistent. It&#39;s so cyclical. You&#39;re trying to make the cyclical trade, which I understand that. I&#39;m okay with that. But I I I don&#39;t want to play the timing game with this because this the good the good times never last with Alcoa. So, if you get a few string a few quarters and the stock doubles, great. Um balance sheet looks okay. They&#39;ll find a way to screw you. Maybe they&#39;ll issue a ton of shares as the stock goes up, but they just have never been a shareholder wind type of company. W\n\nAlcoa, AA, this has always been a really bad business and a poorly run business.

Where is  the shares outstand? Yeah. So, they did it already. They were at 184 million shares. Boom. Like magic. They added 34 million shares in the last 12 months or between 2023 and 2024. I I I literally hate management like that. I literally cannot stand management that does so hard no right there. Unless they fired the CEO since this offering was done, I want nothing to do with it. Like Brad Jacobs did an offering on QXO. And you can say, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you hate Brad?&quot; Because Brad&#39;s got a billion dollars of his own money in it before they did the offering, before they found Beacon Roofing. So if he if he&#39;s hurting me, he&#39;s hurting himself a lot more. He wouldn&#39;t do the offering to hurt himself. He would do it because he saw it was a growth path forward. It was a necessary thing to get it done to get Beacon done and he&#39;s doing it and now he&#39;s got his platform and the game is just beginning. Again, this is one you tuck away and in 5 to 7 years you have a multibagger. Whether it&#39;s 5x, 8x, 12x, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve modeled it to seven or 8x based on he likes to get 15% of the industry and double digit ebid on margins yada yada yada. But um it it really doesn&#39;t matter. you&#39;re going to so far so dramatically outperform anything else you could do that it it deserves a position in the portfolio. Nothing is ever a guarantee. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a position. Not your whole mortg mortgage your house, but a serious position because this guy has made so much incredible amounts of money for shareholders over and over and over throughout his career. And he&#39;s got the most skin in the game, personal skin in the game, than he&#39;s ever had in any other deal. In QXO, he only put in 150 million. In URI, he put in less. So, there you go. Uh, Leaf Foster, what do you think of Petra Boss? We covered this a million at times. The financials look fine, but you have a socialist in power, so at any moment in time, they could cut the dividend. They haven&#39;t done it yet. They may never do it, but it&#39;s it&#39;s not a game I want to play. Aaron L, thank you for all you do. I find your weekly video very extremely valuable, especially during those periods of peak uncertainty. The consistency you bring is truly admirable. Thank you, Aaron. That&#39;s very kind of you say. Was hoping you could take a look at at core ATKR company offers conduit fittings and various other electrical infrastructure related parts with its manufacturing operations and customers concentrated in the US. Okay, I think we looked at this one a couple weeks ago. ATKR So okay, so prices declined with revenues and cash flows. So what you need to prove out in order to take a stab at this is what&#39;s the turnaround plan and you know this is a serious broken momentum stock and this is where you can get trapped. you know, you have a stock that was a 10bagger and then it comes down, you know, 60% in a short period of time. It&#39;s probably going to take two or three years to build the base on this. I&#39;m willing to be wrong on that, but um that turnaround plan is probably just beginning solution polys. All right, let&#39;s take a look at some financials. So revenues have dropped off from 4 billion down to three billion give or take. Free cash flow is almost haved. Balance sheet 350 million of cash. $700 million debt. That&#39;s probably okay. Share count has come down a lot. All right. So all t\n\nthe most skin in the game, personal skin in the game, than he&#39;s ever had in any other deal. In QXO, he only put in 150 million. In URI, he put in less. So, there you go.

How are they going to turn it around? Does it look credible? What have they said in the past and what&#39;s happened? What have they been saying the last eight quarters as revenues and and cash flow have been declining? And if you can get comfortable that their turnaround plan is plausible and you verify by looking at competitors and seeing what competitors are are saying in the space and doing channel checks and doing it. You might have it, but just taking a look at it, I think it&#39;s way, way too early. It&#39;s a broken It&#39;s a broken Momo stock. Any thoughts on Flow Traders, Europe&#39;s leading market maker? Uh, that&#39;s a business I tend to avoid or flow. What? F L Flow Traders. Yeah, looks like your cash flow peaked four years ago. Never looked back. The stock price is going up without the cash flow. It&#39;s a pass for me. Theo Djardan Apache we covered in the past. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not great. The reason that we&#39;re not not as sanguin is we love our com stock. [Music] Um yeah, I I I think we said yes to this a few times. We just prefer com stock and we covered all the reasons why. So go back to the last few weeks of podcast. Uh buying more VF Corp. You bet. Yeah. All new clients got VF Corp as a full position. So uh nothing to think about there. That&#39;s just tariff noise and BS. You still got the same winner running the show uh turning things around and the tariffs will be what the tariffs are, but their their business modes are going to be their business modes and they&#39;re they&#39;ve got they&#39;ve done the Dtock. They&#39;re now going to ramp it up and Bracken&#39;s done this a gazillion times with different brands going back to his PNG days with Old Spice, then Logitech, 26 Bagger, and it&#39;s going to do the same exact thing. if you&#39;ve got to sell a couple brands to buy a couple new more that that&#39;s what VF Corp has been doing for 125 years and they&#39;re going to do for the next 125 years. So, they&#39;ve cleaned everything up. They sold they they took solveny risk off the table with Supreme. Could they sell the pack business to get a little more cash if they had to? They sure could. Uh but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll have to. Moody&#39;s reported that March Auto Sales was 175 million on an annualized basis due to pull forward. Uh, however, they believe April and May could be ugly. The inventories will still have to be rebuilt. The lobbying is in place, etc. At the end of the day, David, [Music] um, the average car on the road is still 13.5 years. So, in the worst case scenario, if the cost of a car goes up $5,000, people are going to buy smaller cars. So, it&#39;s going to go up $2,500. And then they&#39;re going to offer more and more incentives. The affordability is coming down. Why? Because the gig is up. They got away with murder during COVID because they could control supply and demand was high. Demand is even higher now. But they can no longer control supply because the Koreans are going to come in and flood their ass with cheap cars if they don&#39;t if they don&#39;t compete. Okay? And so now they&#39;re competing. They&#39;re all offering incentives. It&#39;s race to the bottom in terms of margins for the OEMs which is going to benefit the auto parts suppliers because they get paid on volumes and their prices are pre pre-negotiated in the case of Cooper Standard just finished all their negotiations in the last 6 months. Uh so they&#39;re going to mint cash on the race to the bottom with huge volumes. And like Generrack generators, the fastest growing states are the ones with the highest penetration. When your neighbor gets a new car, which on average they haven&#39;t for 13 and a half years, um everyone starts to get new cars and the game is going to be on and the incentives are going to be on and it&#39;s going to be a race to protect share by the US OEM. So, they&#39;re going to have to do more and more dealer incentives, and you&#39;re seeing it every single day on commercials, which is going to be a huge benefit for Cooper.

So, you can listen to the noise in the headlines  on a daily basis, or you can step back, zoom out, and actually make intelligent long-term decisions that that will make you multibags, rinse, repeat, out in three to five years onto the next. Um, auto industry aggressively lobbies. Okay, we got that one already. Uh, Peter Rardo asked a question. Literally, this is what they wrote as their name. Uh, really appreciate the great podcast. Extremely generous person. Want to ask the likelihood we get a repeat of the 70s or did we start our secular bare market in bonds being invested in energy is the best way. Thoughts on national Varco? National Varco is kind of a dog, but we've covered it a million times. I think at these levels, you're okay. There are better ways to play it. I think if you have to play servicesers, you're probably better off going up the food chain to slumber so you can sleep easily at night. But if you want to uh dig in the dumpster, I would say Varco is probably going to be, you know, probably be a double over a few years. Again, we looked at the financials a few weeks ago.

Uh, look, I told you what we're doing. you do it, you're going to I I don't know how to You've got to figure out how to hedge out your Hong Kong dollar risk with the Australian dollar. I'm not I don't think you're pegged. Um I think this is going to be much to do about nothing, but um I'm being proactive. I mean, there's no downside other than the commission to just switch them over, which is it's dimminimous. Um so, uh for us, we did it. as far as you doing it and hedging it out, talk to your financial advisor. Uh you probably do have to hedge out currency in some way, but um in your shoes, I'd probably switch it over and just deal with it because like if you look, even if you had a negative currency implication of 20% and the stock doubles, who cares?

    "HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nexcited to bring a lot to you. But as always, family first, then we&#39;ll get right\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nKorea talks, good news on India talks. Trump this week talking about taking down the China tariffs to get something done and saying that there were talks happening this morning. The Chinese are like we we don&#39;t know anything about those talks but okay. Uh but it shows and I think the key pivot point uh after the 90-day pause was meeting with the CEOs of Target, Walmart, Home Depot this morning and getting a sense of like, hey man, you know, we&#39;d love to uh manufacture sneakers in Mississippi, but at the end of the day, uh the economics just don&#39;t work if we&#39;re not paying the workers $2 an hour. So, uh I think there&#39;s going to be a great compromise. uh and that great great compromise. The media may portray it as Trump softening, but the joke is going to be on the media in that he&#39;s going to wind up with tens of billions of dollars, if not a couple hundred billion dollars of revenue for the country that we wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. and do it in a sensible way such that uh we can get some clarity sooner so businesses can actually start to plan because capex has grown to a halt and uh and and businesses can start to feel confident and consumers can start to feel confident. So, they&#39;ll probably get their first quarter of negative GDP, but they&#39;re my sense is they&#39;re getting worried about getting a second quarter because if they get a second quarter of negative GDP, you got a technical recession and that&#39;s going to cost a lot more than what they&#39;ve saved on Doge or they&#39;ve raised from their external revenue service and it will all have been for absolute not and a complete waste of everyone&#39;s time and hurt a lot of retirees who probably sold in the hole two weeks ago and certainly a lot of hedge funds that were selling when they should have been buying or at the very least holding. Problem is they all run too much leverage so they got their asses handed to them. And uh it&#39;s the same story every single time. So, uh\nmoving along . Uh we&#39;ve covered this for the last few weeks. I&#39;ve handheld you through this tumultuous period. I said, &quot;Hang on with your white knuckles, ladies and gentlemen. This two shall pass.&quot; And uh and that&#39;s starting to happen. It doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re not going back down to retest the lows. I&#39;d say the probability is lower now. That&#39;s for sure. But this was the one. If you remember uh three weeks ago, I&#39;m like, &quot;Guys, look, I I don&#39;t spend much time on technicals, but I shared this chart with a friend uh who was a little queasy there in the middle of it.&quot; And and by the way, he was one of the more optimistic of my friends. Uh some of them were really, really nervous and understandably so. Uh and I said, &quot;Look, you know, if this holds, we&#39;re probably doing okay.&quot; and and it immediately shot up that that the next day when Trump was like, &quot;Uh, buy now.&quot; I mean, we&#39;ve got a stock promoter and chief. Uh, and then, uh, we went back. It looked like we were going to retest, which we we had told you here that that was a possibility looking back at 2011 as an analog, and we also talked about the 2018 analog. Uh, and then it did that, and now it&#39;s working up higher. And I think you&#39;re now going to start to see a little bit of fear of loss. That&#39;s not to say no damage has been done, ladies and gentlemen. We are seeing some good earnings. We&#39;re seeing some mixed earnings. We&#39;re seeing two track guidances. If if he continues to do I if the craziness continues, here&#39;s what our earnings will look like in a recession, which is guaranteed. Uh or if they cut bait and do something re rational, uh we&#39;re actually cooking and we will report good numbers and we will continue to invest. And now that&#39;s starting to look like a possibility again with all of the news that we&#39;ve shared. This is looking like recovery. That&#39;s the So we did the the 15minute the 60 minute. I swear I haven&#39;t pulled up 15 minute and 60 minute charts in probably since the lows in 2022, which was the last time I ever came on this and said if you were going to put money to work with us, existing clients adding money, uh new clients getting started, now is the time. And the only other time that I&#39;ve done that is two weeks ago uh at the lows in early April. Uh and um and looking at all the opportunity, it it couldn&#39;t it really couldn&#39;t still be a better time. I mean, it&#39;s just phenomenal. Here&#39;s the daily, then the weekly, you know, weekly still you can see it. And then the monthly, barely a blip on the chart, but boy did that feel pretty abrupt for a moment there.\n\nthe scoreboard. And so many get distracted by looking at they spend their time looking at price on a daily basis. And when I get distracted by price because hedge funds are blowing up, pensions are for sellers, uh margin people are getting margin clerk calls and liquidations, uh I just go to the free cash flow and I&#39;m like, \"Huh, their cash flow keeps growing. I wonder why the price is going down so much in the short term. I better buy some more.\" Uh and and sure enough, that&#39;s always the right call. When the intrinsic value of the business goes up and the price goes down, if you play that arbitrage, uh you&#39;ll get rich over time. I mean, it&#39;s just that simple if you&#39;re patient and if you manage risk through not using a lot of leverage and very few people can do that because you know what is everyone asking me about is everyone&#39;s asking me about all the stocks that are in the\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines . They have to ask me about Tesla. They have to ask me about Nvidia. And the companies that are the best are the ones like Boeing that were completely forgotten. And you had another chance to buy it at $129 two weeks ago. and we went on Vanney and we went on all the shows and people were like, \"Well, they&#39;re getting all their parts. Give me an effing break, ladies and gentlemen.\" At the end of the day, you know, the biggest joke I I I loved being on Vanney in real time when that headline came across that the Chinese are refusing are refusing Boeing deliveries. I mean, the Chinese refusing Boeing deliveries is like a diabetic refusing insulin. They need our planes way more than we need their sales already. India&#39;s like, \"We&#39;ll take them.\" Uh, can you paint over them and, you know, put India Airways or whatever they&#39;ve got over there, Jet Jet Airways, uh, uh, on the plane? And they&#39;re like, \"Yeah, we&#39;ll absolutely, we&#39;ll help you. Oh, by the way, China, you want to lose your place in line, you can get back when this tariff thing is negotiated, you can get back at the end of the line and wait 20 years for your next plane.\" Oh, you got Comarmac. They delivered a whopping 13 planes last year. uh you know, let me clear my throat. That&#39;s uh not gonna cut it. So, China is making a mistake there. Uh and um not the first, won&#39;t be the last. Uh but look, we&#39;ve made our share of mistakes as well. And uh they sooner or later, the universal thing, whether you&#39;re in the United States or around the world, is politicians always make the right decision after exhausting every other possibility. And this time will be no different. All right, let&#39;s get to our data charts.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nEveryone says that place. By the way, want to thank um Terry H. You know who you are. And obviously Robert for uh S for putting together such an incredible and Desiree for putting together such an incredible list of things to do. We literally packed every minute that we could. uh you know, did all the snorkeling, did all the excursions, did everything, went to all the right restaurants. Uh and it&#39;s very rare that the girls get a week off training, so we had to jump on it. And very grateful for making it uh super memorable. Uh okay, let&#39;s talk about this some data. We love to do data. Burden ourselves with the fact share of Chinese exports to the US is 14%. So it&#39;s relatively dimminimous. It&#39;s even more diminishous for China these days. Another rare signal that better times could be coming. This is from Carson. Uh S&P performance after three consecutive 1% gains. And you look a month out 1.3 6 months out 9% 12 months out 14%. I love his anecdotes and data that he puts out. He does a really good job. Uh forward 12 month PE ratio at the sector level. Obviously, you can see that uh energy is still the cheapest financials. Healthcare, there&#39;s a lot of opportunity there. Those are going to start to bounce aggressively. Friend sent over an amazing note on biotech. I think biotech&#39;s getting to ready to rip despite Maha and uh Robert Kennedy Jr. I think that part of the solutions for the problem are going to come from innovative biotech companies and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll get that sorted. Uh and better food and all the the great things that they&#39;re talking about as well. Uh, Peter Lynch, the key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them. Uh, here are flows into money market and cash ETFs. Uh, always when it gets this high, you find yourself at or near a huge buying opportunity and a low. World XUS equities versus the S&P 500. You can see here breaking out, breaking this downtrend line. This is a theme that we came in at the beginning of the year pounding the hell out of the table. Get some international exposure. If not China, at least get some emerging markets, get some exus, get some Europe. And they&#39;ve dramatically outperformed. I think XUS is up 6.6% on the year. While the US has been down, albeit coming uh down less and less by the minute. China&#39;s broad budget deficit soarses the first quarter. Uh what that means in English is they are doing massive stimulus spending. They want to move as we covered in recent podcasts from you know 50 some odd percent consumption to 70% consumption within 10 years. US wants to move manufacturing back up to a higher percentage. Uh and that&#39;s rebalance is where a deal is made. Then you look at affordability of vehicles down to 36.7%. By the way, everyone&#39;s sending me like, \"Oh yeah, March, they shot the lights out. You&#39;ve never seen so much car production, which is going to be amazing for Cooper Standard free cash flow.\" Uh, but then they expect April and May to fall off a cliff. April and May aren&#39;t going to fall off a cliff because number one, there&#39;s still the urgency to to get in uh ahead of time. And number two, they now have worked down the inventories and they&#39;re going to have to replenish the inventories on top of it. This is going to continue as well as huge lobbying groups going to Washington and it looks like Trump is going to find some middle ground for the suppliers and for the automakers uh which will be a big deal. Uh margin debt expansion versus contraction indicator. We are nowhere near the extremes you see at or near tops. That&#39;s a good thing, not a bad thing. Dollar was another theme, weak dollar coming into the year, worst start to the year basically on record. Uh, everyone starting to get bearish the dollar. You&#39;re seeing some covers. We&#39;re going to cover the economist. Uh, everyone bearish the dollar, which means we&#39;re probably due for a bounce. It will be a counter trend rally. Get ready for that. Uh,\n\nemerging markets total return. This is European up 13% versus S&P down 10%. Japan&#39;s core inflation accelerates, complicating bank, bank of Japan&#39;s rate path if they have to keep raising. Carry trade continues to unwind, which is why we don&#39;t think the mag seven are going to get back above the top of the channel. But there&#39;s a long way between here and the top of the channel because they were the hit hit the hardest as was one of our key themes coming into the year. Go back and listen to our November and December podcasts. price to fair value estimate by economic moat rating across size and style. All this says in English is small cap with wide moat according to the morning star ratings has the greatest discount to fair value i.e. the most undervalued. If you don&#39;t have small cap exposure and you&#39;re skeptical because it hasn&#39;t worked yet, this would be a time to get on board in our view. Again, all of this is opinion, not advice. Go to Headed Headund Tips and read headfundtips.com and click on the terms right there. Basically, it says it&#39;s for entertainment. Don&#39;t do anything. Talk to your financial advisor, etc., etc. Premium beverage. We are spending more on alcohol but drinking less. This is the whole theme of the Diagio narrative, which we&#39;ve discussed in past podcasts. People&#39;s interest in escaping is never going to change. And if they&#39;re drinking less, they&#39;re going to want higher quality, higher premium. And that&#39;s where you benefit from doing the Dagios relative to the constellations or other type of companies in the category. The best and worst days are usually close to each other. That&#39;s why if you&#39;re out of the market or you think you time you you screw up twice because one you sell in the hole and then you think you&#39;re going to buy lower and it winds up moving against you. So you miss the gains back up so you double lose. It&#39;s the way people blow up and never never get ahead.\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nHere are all the economies. Here are all the covers on the economist. How a dollar crisis could unfold. So probably get a bounce in the dollar soon. The envy of the world, the US. So they&#39;re talking about the end of US exceptionalism. We&#39;ve covered in the past. We do think international is going to outperform because it runs in 10 to 15 year cycles. But that doesn&#39;t mean US exceptionalism in the broad context will not continue. Never in the history of humankind has a greater company been created. And the reason is is because number one we were blessed with resources. Number two, we were blessed with oceans on both side for defense. But number three and the most important is we got the best ideas from everyone every other country in the world all converged on one great place called America and with hard work with a dream with a risk-taking DNA for them to take that chance to come to a new country. And the only thing that will hurt US exceptionalism is if we stop allowing great people from around the country who are hungry and looking for opportunity from coming in legally but coming in in good numbers which has been our magic formula for success for you know hundreds of years and will continue to be moving forward. But our stocks might underperform for a decade or so. That&#39;s okay. uh they&#39;ll still do great housing supply and if you&#39;re under the surface in the unmagnificent 493 and small caps fortunes are going to be made. This is the type of environment where uh just insane amounts of money are made just like Cooperman and Buffett and Gabelli did in the 70s uh once the Nifty50 uh started to underperform just fortunes were made on a stockby stock basis. Billions. Billions. That&#39;s that&#39;s where they all became billionaires. Housing supply hits 5-year high. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s going to help with prices. Wait till they continue to open the federal lands and then all the things are going to happen. The housing supply, QXO, Stanley, GenerRack, etc., etc. Frontloading is being mainly channeled through air freight, S&P lags, uh, international by the most in 32 years. You know for six months we told you coming into this year that this is not going to last forever. Start getting international, getting emerging markets. In our case getting China by the way update on China for clients. Uh they started the transfer of all US shares to Hong Kong shares. It usually takes it should be done overnight. Um so the first step was done where they get the placeholder and then you get converted out. It&#39;s 8:1 US because the Hong Kong US dollar is pegged at 8 to1 conversion. So you don&#39;t have currency risk. You&#39;ll just get eight more shares for every US share. The price will be the same because the uh fixed US Hong Kong dollar peg. Uh so we&#39;re doing that to hedge. We we think it will be an unnecessary hedge, but we&#39;re keeping 100% of our options in the US because there&#39;s no way to replicate in uh Hong Kong. And uh but our options bucket has always been the huge high expected value and willingness to uh take our our risk is quantified by our sizing and then the stock we&#39;re not willing to accept that risk. So Navaro and all the hawks can do whatever the hell they want. we are uh set up because even if the options um get impacted uh the stock will more than make up for it over time because the fundamentals of the business continue to improve. They continue to generate huge cash flow 25 billion 20 25 billion a year. Uh leader in AI leader in middle class recovery leader in everything that we&#39;ve covered and um one of the lowest multiples relative to growth. It&#39;s it&#39;s such an incredible story and we&#39;re so grateful to be a part of it. And we&#39;re grateful to Xi Jinping for taking so long to clean things up because it enabled us to have twice the size position that we would have had if he fixed it right away. 37% of US imports from China are intermediate goods used in US production. So that&#39;s why both parties need a deal. That&#39;s why the Navaro has been hidden under a rock and Lutnik and Besson has been at the forefront because they figured out uh that um it&#39;s not as black and white as it seems and more rational heads need to come to the table to rebalance but not to flip everything on its head which ultimately winds up hurting us. So we&#39;re going to get a lot of extraction here. We&#39;re going to get a lot of benefits. It&#39;s probably net net potentially good if it resolves right that we went in this direction. How we did it is up for debate and I&#39;m the first one to admit that. Uh the fact that we did do it probably needed to be done. Uh and um and I think it&#39;s going to resolve like like I said all through the crisis when everyone&#39;s hair was on fire is welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0. a new tweet, new set of volatility resolves to the upside over time. Okay?\n\nRetail net buying of S&P 500 single stocks. Like I said hedge funds were the morons selling in the hole. Retail were buying. They&#39;ve been right since COVID. They&#39;ll continue to be right. Dollar most overvalued since the Plaza Accord. We&#39;ve laid out the idea of a Mara Lago accord and probably part of a package deal will be an accepted deval of currency in lie of higher tariffs just like happened at the Plaza Hotel in 1988. Well, it was it&#39;s the second term. I think it was first quarter of 1988. It&#39;s the second term might have been 86. Second term of uh Reagan. Uh Tesla net income dropping. Uh you got to believe in robots to buy this story, you know. Uh I&#39;ll leave it there. We we&#39;ve never owned it. We&#39;ve never shorted it. Uh we That&#39;s the thing that you really have to understand if you want to be a good investor. Just because everyone&#39;s talking about something doesn&#39;t mean you have to be involved. You want to get involved with great businesses when no one&#39;s talking about them, not when everyone&#39;s talking. There&#39;s still huge risk when everyone&#39;s talking. Capex intentions. You know what I love about Alibaba right now? No one&#39;s really talking about it other than the dellesting nonsense. Uh which now we&#39;ve hedged hedged against that risk. Uh again, probably unnecessarily, but just need to do it in the case of prudence. Um that&#39;s that. uh equity sector flows starting to flow back into technology. Uh starting to flow into what is that green? Healthc care that&#39;ll be good. Uh roughly two and five home sellers is starting to give concessions to buyers. Uh\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nhere is  from Brendan Ahern. Baba&#39;s holdings from Chinese investors via southbound stock connect now eight now 8.554%. So remember that was a key theme last year. We said get ready after August once they this the uh stock connect opens for BABA and mainland Chinese investors can buy Alibaba for the first time ever. Imagine being able to buy Amazon for the first time ever. Uh it&#39;s going to continue to flow and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened. 20 some odd billion dollars and probably a lot more to come. Prices bottom before earnings in bare markets. So earnings probably will continue to come down because of all the capex that stopped in the last 3 weeks. You could say necessarily or unnecessarily depending on your views. But bottom line, it froze up a lot of capex spending. I hope it&#39;s worth it. Uh but so expect more bad news about earnings and guidance and and uh probably the the markets bottomed uh in anticipation of that if we don&#39;t retest the lows. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to go much lower than where where we hit uh in early April as I said two weeks ago. Um and we went through the analoges of 2018 and 2011 etc. Traders Cloud 6.6 billion into leverage long ETFs. Median gross margin is uh recovered from 2022. A little bit of step back here uh but headed back towards record. We&#39;ll see if that can be sustained. That&#39;s going to depend a lot on tariffs. M&amp;A is slowing. Okay. So, this is having knock-on effects that we&#39;re going to hear about for the next 3 months. Just like COVID market bottomed in uh March 23rd, 2020. Negative\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\n\n### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS\nheadlines and then you got to deal with nonsense that ultimately shoots our it just destroys the US investors. So, I mean, if they do dlisting, it&#39;s the dumbest political decision in the history of mankind because you&#39;ve basically evaporated $800 billion of your own US investor capital. But stupider things have happened. Uh, so you can&#39;t completely rule it out, which is why we&#39;re just hedging. We&#39;re keeping all of our options in the US because we can&#39;t replicate them in Hong Kong. So, you know, maybe you do half and half. You know, if if if half gets wiped, the other half doubles, you&#39;re you&#39;re fine. And if nothing happens, everything doubles. Uh that that&#39;s another way to hedge it. But I would probably take the currency risk in your shoes. That&#39;s opinion, not advice. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nUm Jimmy Jones, Abomaro, what are the impact of tariffs? No one knows because no one knows the rules of the game. Okay, so we could wake up. So the when you zoom out, here&#39;s what you have to think about. What is the demand of lithium moving forward? Is it priced inexpensively or expensively? Do the players that can benefit from the the price troughing and rebounding over time with tariffs or without tariffs have the liquidity to wait through the cycle? And Albamaro is one of the biggest lithium producers in the world. They&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity. So as whether there&#39;s a 20% or 0% or 50% or 145% tariff, they&#39;re still going to have the most share and demand for lithium is not going to change. So as far as handicapping whether a 20% tariff will hurt earnings by this month or 30 and guessing and pretending you have some edge, there is no edge. The edge is do you want the one of the biggest share companies in the business with ample liquidity to sit through the trough of the cycle uh and to own it at an enormous discount to intrinsic value with or without tariffs? And if the answer is yes, I would like one of the biggest players that has ample liquidity to ride it out because it&#39;s a huge hockey stick of operating leverage as prices come back and all the small players get blown out, then Albamaro is for you and that&#39;s why we own it. So, good question and thank you for being a regular listener and contributor. Eric F. Uh he&#39;s asking about ones that we&#39;ve uh talked about in the past. So, we had um we don&#39;t spend a lot of time on on the winners. We&#39;ve done uh Vornnado. We&#39;ve done uh um uh Range Resources. We&#39;ve done um Rolls-Royce. We&#39;ve done uh Wells Fargo, we&#39;ve done uh Exxon Mobile during co we we&#39;ve done a bunch of them uh that that we&#39;ve publicly talked about and a bunch that we&#39;ve done in private. We did the the Google and the um Alphabet and Amazon we bought in uh fall of 2022 when no one wanted it. uh and we bought the uh sold them in July of last year. They went up again before crashing in the first quarter. So we looked like we were early. We were right. Um we did um Yeah. So So that&#39;s just a sampling. So, you know, every 6 months we probably bring on one or two more new names and then we close out one or two names and we talk about them uh and and so on and so forth. So, welcome to the podcast. You&#39;re obviously new um and glad to have you on board. So,",
    "MISCELLANEOUS": "\n\nUh too much to cover. As you can see, uh I don&#39;t have the uh proper height to be a hoola dancer. Uh so we&#39;ll just uh stick to stocks. This was at Unu uh excuse me, this was at Ulu at the Four Seasons. Caitlyn and I went out for date night. We met the most incredible couple couple um Jerry and Kathleen Grundhuffer. And I know Jerry, I didn&#39;t even realize when I was talking to him. I&#39;m so embarrassed now. Uh this guy is an absolute legend. He was the chairman and CEO of US Bank Corp when Warren Buffett owned US Bank Corp. And spoke about how incredible Jerry was in all of his annual letters and we were talking about his rollups. He&#39;s just uh one of the greatest banking CEOs in the history of the United States. And like all great uh men, t\n\n### MISCELLANEOUS\nldup. This was started with a tweet. It could end with a tweet. We saw tweets today about positive talks with South Korea, positive talks with India. So, we want to buy highquality businesses marked down and there&#39;s still quite a few of them on sale right now. You know, the the econo data is rearview mirror looking, but we did just get durable goods, Keith, and the durable goods orders for last month skyrocketed well beyond what was expected. A lot of that was sort of front-loading, whether it was companies who were putting in a ton of orders ahead of what they perceived would be the tariffs that President Trump had threatened. So, you&#39;re looking at something like that. uh they surged 9.2% in March, well above the 2.0 forecast.\n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nLet&#39;s talk customers. Tom, you like PayPal.\n\nleader in AI leader in middle class recovery leader in everything that we&#39;ve covered and um one of the lowest multiples relative to growth. It&#39;s it&#39;s such an incredible story and we&#39;re so grateful to be a part of it. And we&#39;re grateful to Xi Jinping for taking so long to clean things up because it enabled us to have twice the size position that we would have had if he fixed it right away. 37% of US imports from China are intermediate goods used in US production. So that&#39;s why both parties need a deal. That&#39;s why the Navaro has been hidden under a rock and Lutnik and Besson has been at the forefront because they figured out uh that um it&#39;s not as black and white as it seems and more rational heads need to come to the table to rebalance but not to flip everything on its head which ultimately winds up hurting us. So we&#39;re going to get a lot of extraction here. We&#39;re going to get a lot of benefits. It&#39;s probably net net potentially good if it resolves right that we went in this direction. How we did it is up for debate and I&#39;m the first one to admit that. Uh the fact that we did do it probably needed to be done. Uh and um and I think it&#39;s going to resolve like like I said all through the crisis when everyone&#39;s hair was on fire is welcome to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0. a new tweet, new set of volatility resolves to the upside over time. Okay? And that&#39;s all you need to if you if you need anything else, whether you&#39;re Democrat or Republican um for the next three and a half years, just write it down. Put it on your computer. Welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as Trump 1.0. New tweet, new volatility resolves to the upside over time. Okay. Um,here is  the estimated global position of systematic metro. These are the CTAs that got smoked, all sold in the hole at the exact wrong time, just like they did during COVID. And then they&#39;ll have to chase up on the way up as deals are announced and everyone sees that there was a method to the madness. We&#39;re going to be very nice. Trump vows lower tariffs on China. So down from 145 to lower to start negotiations then you know I don&#39;t know they said they aren&#39;t meeting. He says he&#39;s not lowering tariffs but it just keeps getting leaked. So there&#39;s probably a reason for that structural breakout for the euro. This is something that people didn&#39;t expect. The looney is going up as well. These are other themes that we&#39;ve been consistently pounding the table. Retail net buying of S&amp;P 500 single stocks. Like I said hedge funds were the morons selling in the hole. Retail were buying. They&#39;ve been right since COVID. They&#39;ll continue to be right. Dollar most overvalued since the Plaza Accord. We&#39;ve laid out the idea of a Mara Lago accord and probably part of a package deal will be an accepted deval of currency in lie of higher tariffs just like happened at the Plaza Hotel in 1988. Well, it was it&#39;s the second term. I think it was first quarter of 1988. It&#39;s the second term might have been 86. Second term of uh Reagan. Uh Tesla net income dropping. Uh you got to believe in robots to buy this story, you know. Uh I&#39;ll leave it there. We we&#39;ve never owned it. We&#39;ve never shorted it. Uh we don&#39;t have to play. We That&#39;s the thing that you really have to understand if you want to be a good investor. Just because everyone&#39;s talking about something doesn&#39;t mean you have to be involved. You want to get involved with great businesses when no one&#39;s talking about them, not when everyone&#39;s talking. There&#39;s still huge risk when everyone&#39;s talking. Capex intentions. You know what I love about Alibaba right now? No one&#39;s really talking about it other than the dellesting nonsense. Uh which now we&#39;ve hedged hedged against that risk. Uh again, probably unnecessarily, but just need to do it in the case of prudence. Um that&#39;s that. uh equity sector flows starting to flow back into technology. Uh starting to flow into what is that green? Healthc care that&#39;ll be good. Uh roughly two and five home sellers is starting to give concessions to buyers. Uh\n\nThey got the digital aviation solutions sold to Toma Bravo. 777X received FAA authorization for additional aerodynamic brakes and engine testing with daily flights ongoing and performing well. And obviously they got the big F f47 contract worth $50 billion with the US government and this time it&#39;s going to be a profitable contract versus previous fixedpric contracts that carried undue risk and turned into money losing ventures. All six KPIs continue to perform well and show stability with every m metric currently in the green including final ticketing which had been below required thresholds during Q4. Sentiment as you can see all the active managers got washed out at the lows. 35% equity exposure. Now, this is going to turn around and move back up to 100 and then everyone will want it and that&#39;s when you can lighten up in the short term. REITs top 30 weights estimates in the last 60 days. Down 2.93% for 2025, up for next year. So, we&#39;re going to start to see a lot of backend loaded stuff. Utilities, let&#39;s see what they did. Um down 64 basis points. That&#39;s not bad. These estimates will continue to come down on a lagged effect from the tariff stuff, but the bottom may have priced in the worst and then they&#39;ll start to recover over time like we see in every major 20% correction. Economic data, nothing really crazy. Durable goods orders were f unbelievable. a lot of pull forward that cars that that cash flow is going to help Cooper up 9.2% versus 2.1%. A lot of that&#39;s car related, durables excluding defense up 10.4%. This was a big big deal. Initial jobless claims 222,000. That&#39;s why you&#39;ve got Waller and the Cleveland governor out talking about June as a possible cut if jobs if we start to lose jobs. Atlanta GDP Fed now has got the administration finally on alert. You&#39;re getting your negative first quarter probably of GDP. So get your act together or you&#39;re going to get two quarters and the recession is going to cost you more than all the trouble you&#39;ve caused uh in terms of Doge and in terms of tariffs. uh the cost uh and the amount of spending you&#39;ll have to do to get us out of a recession is going to dwarf what you have made in tariffs and what you have made in Doge cuts. So the moral of the story is take yes for an answer. Take the win. You&#39;ve got more tariffs than you&#39;ve ever had. Uh and you can save a recession if you pivot very quickly and businesses can start to invest again and it will be a good thing all around and you will look like a hero. But push it harder and get a recession and then you got double triple loss. Uh and you get wiped out in the midterms completely handcuffed for the for the remaining two years if you screw this up. So um that&#39;s that. You can see 20 26 estimates going up. Uh 2025 haven&#39;t really come down a lot. I mean the most optimistic was ever 275 sometime late last year. So down to 267, it&#39;s not a huge hit. Those will probably keep coming down and next year we&#39;ll keep coming up, which should be able to stabilize the market because the market may be able to look through that.\n\non alert. You&#39;re getting your negative uh first quarter probably of GDP. Uh so get your act together or you&#39;re going to get two quarters and the recession is going to cost you more than all the trouble you&#39;ve caused uh in terms of Doge and in terms of tariffs. uh the cost uh and the amount of spending you&#39;ll have to do to get us out of a recession is going to dwarf what you have made in tariffs and what you have made in Doge cuts.

    "MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP": "\n\n### MEDIA_APPEARANCE_RECAP\nWant to thank Liz Clayman, Brooke Halisgak, and Jake Mack for having me on Fox Business Today live from Hawaii to talk about my favorite things, the market, uh, and a couple of picks, Boeing and PayPal. We're going to listen in here. All right, let's get right to the floor show and bring in our traders to talk about all of this and the green on the screen. Joining me now, trader Keith Fitzgerald and Great Hill Capitals, Tom Hayes. Tom, look, uh, regardless of a tarnish brand and the long-term effects of that, these back-to-back gains sure feel good, right? I mean, you've got the VIX falling again, back below, at least earlier, 28 at the moment. Yep, it's almost below 27 right now. Remember, it hit high of 60 earlier this month. Bond yields are dropping at least on the long end. What's not to love, Tom? What's not to love? This is an example of the VIX crush. And one more example of getting paid for being greedy when others were fearful. Uh you had a couple other things out there today, Liz. Uh first and foremost, you had Governor Hammock from Cleveland talking about maybe alluding to a cut in June. If the labor market deteriorates, that's confirming what Waller said. The market really likes the idea of a June Fed cut. And it's very interesting about this correction, Liz, because this was the first time that I've seen in my long career that professionals were actually more scared. They were abject uh fear two weeks ago and retail investors were actually net buyers and retail investors, believe it or not, have been the ones that are on the right side of the trade since co. They've been buying weakness and they've been right and this time will be no different. Well, uh yeah, the retail investor is buying. The hedges had been liquidating. They didn't want to be caught flatfooted or maybe some of them were. Keith Fitzgerald, you too have had a long Wall Street career. Uh what do you learn from this? Because three days in a row is really lovely, but we know that bottoming out processes take a long time. Well, they do and that's really the lesson here. I mean, it's 45 plus years for me I've been doing this and fortunately gotten a lot more right than we've gotten wrong. But you know what the lesson I take away from this is bottoming is a process. It's not a switch. There's no allcle bell when it rings. So you want to constantly play to Tom's point. You know, when others are fearful, you want to be greedy. And time and time and time again, the best companies move ahead, which is why you're seeing traders trying to get ahead of it today. Yeah. And you know, you do want to focus, Tom, on things you actually can control. And what do you feel you can control when you certainly can't control, as we put it, the he said, she said, she as in exi Xi Jinping of of China, that we really aren't sure exactly what the true story is at the moment. Yeah, Liz. Well, I I learned early in my career that good things happen to people who buy great companies when they're marked down on sale. And what you saw two weeks ago was one one of the sales of a lifetime. And people were comparing it to the great financial crisis. They were comparing it to the tech wreck. And the fact of the matter is those were years and years of excess buildup. This was started with a tweet. It could end with a tweet. We saw tweets today about positive talks with South Korea, positive talks with India. So, we want to buy highquality businesses marked down and there's still quite a few of them on sale right now. You know, the the econo data is rearview mirror looking, but we did just get durable goods, Keith, and the durable goods orders for last month skyrocketed well beyond what was expected. A lot of that was sort of front-loading, whether it was companies who were putting in a ton of orders ahead of what they perceived would be the tariffs that President Trump had threatened. So, you're looking at something like that. uh they surged 9.2% in March, well above the 2.0 forecast. So what do you suspect is happening right now and how do you not get caught uh sort of too deep in the water with certain companies that may shut down their inventory buildup? That's a very interesting question. We learned a very powerful lesson out of COVID. We used to have just in time deliveries, but what you're seeing this big surge in my takeaway is just in case. So, they're moving ahead. They're doing what they should be. And the companies that have margin power, protection power, customers actually like what they produce are going to come out of this just fine. It's the guys that are ordering, you know, the extra window cleaning solutions that you worry about because maybe they're doing it, they don't have credit, maybe they don't have the right cash flow, they're stockpiling something. That's the wrong move here. If you're doing it because of customers, then that's the stuff I'm going to be all over. Yeah. Okay. Let's talk customers. Tom, you like PayPal. This is interesting. The CEO, Alex Chris, was on stage right here at the Semaphore conference earlier today. I listened very closely to what he said. He's got 400 million customers. And what's important, I think,",

Tom, you like PayPal.\n\n### TECHNICAL_CHARTS\nRBC . Let&#39;s take a look at some of the technicals because we&#39;re in crazy times. We have to look at the silly charts. So, uh we probably hit some resistance here coming up next week. This downtrend line at 48 5484. Now that everyone&#39;s happy, we probably go up a little more. Maybe we retest 5100. Maybe we don&#39;t. But um I think the bottom is in or or certainly I wouldn&#39;t expect more than a retest, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect that. I I think 5100 test would look good. Or we could blast right through on good news, which would really take everyone by surprise, which would also be pretty exciting because we did enough buying in the hole. Um that&#39;s the weekly. Here&#39;s the dollar. Probably goes a little lower. Everyone&#39;s getting pessimistic. Maybe it finds some support here, bounces back up, and then everyone will when everyone gets bullish on the dollar again, that&#39;s when we&#39;ll resume the downtrend. Gold at a Fibonacci extension level. I I don&#39;t I could care less about gold. It&#39;s a nonpro productive asset. But you&#39;re just betting on some sucker coming in after you and paying a higher price. Uh usually it&#39;s the central banks that buy at the top. I love when people say, &quot;Oh, the central banks are buying.&quot; They&#39;re always the last ones to buy right before the top and then you&#39;re going to get some Mara Lago accord or some deval of the dollar and that will be it. That&#39;ll be the final harrah and gold will be dormant for another 5 to 10 years. Um, and you know what, I&#39;m a stock guy. Don&#39;t even take that take that with a grain of salt. I could care less what happens to gold prices. So, if it keeps going higher, God bless. Hope you make a ton of money. Keep buying high and hoping to sell it to someone else higher. Um, but not for us. \n### FEATURED_COMPANY_DEEP_DIVES\nstock market and sentiment results . Here&#39;s Boeing. Uh, you know, this is all known. We know what was happening. We just we&#39;ve just basically covered the liquidity. We&#39;ve covered the key points. They&#39;re turning the corner. Their free cash flow was negative, but it&#39;s going to be positive by the second half. It was much less negative than anticipated. That was the biggest news. The production is looking good. The engineering focus is looking good. The backlog increased to over a half a trillion dollars this quarter. And uh up until a few days ago, you couldn&#39;t give the stock away. Now people are getting the message and they&#39;ll really be chasing after it after it hits 200 when no one wanted it when we were on Vney at 130. So [Music] um it&#39;s not that often you get to buy such a clear duopoly at such low prices. I mean something like that happens a couple times in a career and uh and it just recently happened. So I hope you all took advantage. That&#39;s one of our largest positions, by the way, in the US. Uh [Music] um maybe I have to check that. It may it might be as it might almost be the size of Cooper Standard. Maybe more. I got to check where that is now. Um not for long though. Cooper&#39;s Cooper&#39;s going to be way more than a double. I can assure you that. That&#39;s our our view on that. We&#39;ve covered that many times. Uh so free cash flow usage was good. commercial backlog grew by more than 25 billion. Okay, let me just get this thing going here. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have my proper mouse with me down in Hawaii. 787 production starting to increase. 7 737 at 38 going to 42. Uh then 52 is where it was at peak back in 2018. They&#39;ll get back there with approvals over time. Uh tariff exposure, they basically went through that and [Music] uh talked about the impact. It&#39;s it&#39;s not as material as people were afraid of. Net annual impact of tariffs on input costs is less than $500 million annually. That&#39;s very very important. That&#39;s kind of dimminimous for a company of this size. Uh and the deals are probably going to get better. They got the digital aviation solutions sold to Toma Bravo. Uh 777X received FAA authorization for additional aerodynamic brakes and engine testing with daily flights ongoing and performing well. Uh, and obviously they got the big F f47 contract worth $50 billion with the US government and this time it&#39;s going to be a profitable contract versus previous fixedpric contracts that carried undue risk and turned into money losing ventures. Uh, all six KPIs continue to perform well and show stability with every m metric currently in the green including final ticketing which had been below required thresholds during Q4. Uh you can go through the earnings call. We highlighted the important parts here and let me just see if there&#39;s anything else. Sentiment as you can see all the active managers got washed out at the lows. 35% equity exposure. Now, this is going to turn around and move back up to 100 and then everyone will want it and that&#39;s when you can lighten up in the short term. REITs uh top 30 weights estimates in the last 60 days. Um down 2.93% for 2025, up for next year. So, we&#39;re going to start to see a lot of backend loaded stuff. Utilities, let&#39;s see what they did. Um down 64 basis points. That&#39;s not bad. These estimates will continue to come down on a lagged effect from the tariff stuff, but the bottom may have priced in the worst and then they&#39;ll start to recover over time like we see in every major 20% correction. Uh economic data, nothing really crazy. Durable goods orders were f unbelievable. a lot of pull forward that cars that that cash flow is going to help Cooper uh up 9.2% versus 2.1%. A lot of that&#39;s car related, durables excluding defense up 10.4%. This was a big big deal. Uh initial jobless claims 222,000.

    "QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK": "\n\nI think you&#39;re now going to start to see a little bit of fear of loss. That&#39;s not to say no damage has been done, ladies and gentlemen. We are seeing some good earnings. We&#39;re seeing some mixed earnings. We&#39;re seeing two track guidances. If if he continues to do I if the craziness continues, here&#39;s what our earnings will look like in a recession, which is guaranteed. Uh or if they cut bait and do something re rational, uh we&#39;re actually cooking and we will report good numbers and we will continue to invest. And now that&#39;s starting to look like a possibility again with all of the news that we&#39;ve shared. This is looking like recovery. That&#39;s the So we did the the 15minute the 60 minute. I swear I haven&#39;t pulled up 15 minute and 60 minute charts in probably since the lows in 2022, which was the last time I ever came on this and said if you were going to put money to work with us, existing clients adding money, uh new clients getting started, now is the time. And the only other time that I&#39;ve done that is two weeks ago uh at the lows in early April. Uh and um and looking at all the opportunity, it it couldn&#39;t it really couldn&#39;t still be a better time. I mean, it&#39;s just phenomenal. Here&#39;s the daily, then the weekly, you know, weekly still you can see it. And then the monthly, barely a blip on the chart, but boy did that feel pretty abrupt for a moment there. ### QUOTES_OF_THE_WEEK\nPeter Lynch, everyone has the brain power to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach. If you are susceptible to selling everything in a panic, you ought to avoid stocks and mutual funds altogether. That&#39;s from the legendary Peter Lynch. Uh Charlie Munger, another mentor uh in in my view by reading and assimilating. Same with Warren. Uh it&#39;s the waiting that helps you as an investor and a lot of people just can&#39;t stand to wait. It&#39;s amazing. People, you know, texting me in the last couple weeks, wow, it&#39;s green today. Feels so good. Like we don&#39;t think ever in terms of days or weeks. We think in terms of months and years. Uh, so you know, Monday was a down day. I mean, honestly, the down days have been more exciting than the up up days because there&#39;s something to do. We can buy stocks. The up days, it&#39;s just like, okay, we got all the stocks we&#39;re going to have. Here we go. We&#39;re going higher. We got enough in the hole. We&#39;re excited. And so on. So, and that&#39;s the way you learn to think about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve I think it&#39;s been a very rare occurrence in my career where I&#39;ve bought stocks on a green day. There have been a couple of times, but um we always buy when it&#39;s red. So games are won by players who focus on the playing field, not by those whose eyes are glued on the scoreboard. And so many get distracted by looking at they spend their time looking at price on a daily basis. And when I get distracted by price because hedge funds are blowing up, pensions are for sellers, uh margin people are getting margin clerk calls and liquidations, uh I just go to the free cash flow and I&#39;m like, &quot;Huh, their cash flow keeps growing. I wonder why the price is going down so much in the short term. I better buy some more.&quot; Uh and and sure enough, that&#39;s always the right call. When the intrinsic value of the business goes up and the price goes down, if you play that arbitrage, uh you&#39;ll get rich over time. I mean, it&#39;s just that simple if you&#39;re patient and if you manage risk through not using a lot of leverage and very few people can do that because you know what is everyone asking me about is everyone&#39;s asking me about all the stocks that are in the",

They have to ask me about Tesla. They have to ask me about Nvidia. And the companies that are the best are the ones like Boeing that were completely forgotten. And you had another chance to buy it at $129 two weeks ago. and we went on Vanney and we went on all the shows and people were like, \"Well, they&#39;re getting all their parts. Give me an effing break, ladies and gentlemen.\" At the end of the day, you know, the biggest joke I I I loved being on Vanney in real time when that headline came across that the Chinese are refusing are refusing Boeing deliveries. I mean, the Chinese refusing Boeing deliveries is like a diabetic refusing insulin. They need our planes way more than we need their sales already. India&#39;s like, \"We&#39;ll take them.\" Uh, can you paint over them and, you know, put India Airways or whatever they&#39;ve got over there, Jet Jet Airways, uh, uh, on the plane? And they&#39;re like, \"Yeah, we&#39;ll absolutely, we&#39;ll help you. Oh, by the way, China, you want to lose your place in line, you can get back when this tariff thing is negotiated, you can get back at the end of the line and wait 20 years for your next plane.\" Oh, you got Comarmac. They delivered a whopping 13 planes last year. uh you know, let me clear my throat. That&#39;s uh not gonna cut it. So, China is making a mistake there. Uh and um not the first, won&#39;t be the last. Uh but look, we&#39;ve made our share of mistakes as well. And uh they sooner or later, the universal thing, whether you&#39;re in the United States or around the world, is politicians always make the right decision after exhausting every other possibility. And this time will be no different. All right, let&#39;s get to our data charts.\n### MACRO_DATA_SLIDES\nEveryone says that place. By the way, want to thank um Terry H. You know who you are. And obviously Robert for uh S for putting together such an incredible and Desiree for putting together such an incredible list of things to do. We literally packed every minute that we could. uh you know, did all the snorkeling, did all the excursions, did everything, went to all the right restaurants. Uh and it&#39;s very rare that the girls get a week off training, so we had to jump on it. And very grateful for making it uh super memorable. Uh okay, let&#39;s talk about this some data. We love to do data. Burden ourselves with the fact share of Chinese exports to the US is 14%. So it&#39;s relatively dimminimous. It&#39;s even more diminishous for China these days. Another rare signal that better times could be coming. This is from Carson. Uh S&P performance after three consecutive 1% gains. And you look a month out 1.3 6 months out 9% 12 months out 14%. I love his anecdotes and data that he puts out. He does a really good job. Uh forward 12 month PE ratio at the sector level. Obviously, you can see that uh energy is still the cheapest financials. Healthcare, there&#39;s a lot of opportunity there. Those are going to start to bounce aggressively. Friend sent over an amazing note on biotech. I think biotech&#39;s getting to ready to rip despite Maha and uh Robert Kennedy Jr. I think that part of the solutions for the problem are going to come from innovative biotech companies and they&#39;ll they&#39;ll get that sorted. Uh and better food and all the the great things that they&#39;re talking about as well. Uh, Peter Lynch, the key to making money in stocks is not to get scared out of them. Uh, here are flows into money market and cash ETFs. Uh, always when it gets this high, you find yourself at or near a huge buying opportunity and a low. World XUS equities versus the S&P 500. You can see here breaking out, breaking this downtrend line. This is a theme that we came in at the beginning of the year pounding the hell out of the table. Get some international exposure. If not China, at least get some emerging markets, get some exus, get some Europe. And they&#39;ve dramatically outperformed. I think XUS is up 6.6% on the year. While the US has been down, albeit coming uh down less and less by the minute. China&#39;s broad budget deficit soarses the first quarter. Uh what that means in English is they are doing massive stimulus spending. They want to move as we covered in recent podcasts from you know 50 some odd percent consumption to 70% consumption within 10 years. US wants to move manufacturing back up to a higher percentage. Uh and that&#39;s rebalance is where a deal is made. Then you look at affordability of vehicles down to 36.7%. By the way, everyone&#39;s sending me like, \"Oh yeah, March, they shot the lights out. You&#39;ve never seen so much car production, which is going to be amazing for Cooper Standard free cash flow.\" Uh, but then they expect April and May to fall off a cliff. April and May aren&#39;t going to fall off a cliff because number one, there&#39;s still the urgency to to get in uh ahead of time. And number two, they now have worked down the inventories and they&#39;re going to have to replenish the inventories on top of it. This is going to continue as well as huge lobbying groups going to Washington and it looks like Trump is going to find some middle ground for the suppliers and for the automakers uh which will be a big deal. Uh margin debt expansion versus contraction indicator. We are nowhere near the extremes you see at or near tops. That&#39;s a good thing, not a bad thing. Dollar was another theme, weak dollar coming into the year, worst start to the year basically on record. Uh, everyone starting to get bearish the dollar. You&#39;re seeing some covers. We&#39;re going to cover the economist. Uh, everyone bearish the dollar, which means we&#39;re probably due for a bounce. It will be a counter trend rally. Get ready for that.

    "### HEADLINES_AND_NEWS": "\n\nBaba&#39;s holdings from Chinese investors via southbound stock connect now eight now 8.554%. So remember that was a key theme last year. We said get ready after August once they this the uh stock connect opens for BABA and mainland Chinese investors can buy Alibaba for the first time ever. Imagine being able to buy Amazon for the first time ever. Uh it&#39;s going to continue to flow and that&#39;s exactly what&#39;s happened. Prices bottom before earnings in bare markets. So earnings probably will continue to come down because of all the capex that stopped in the last 3 weeks. Median gross margin is uh recovered from 2022. A little bit of step back here uh but headed back towards record. We&#39;ll see if that can be sustained. That&#39;s going to depend a lot on tariffs. M&amp;A is slowing. Okay. So, this is having knock-on effects that we&#39;re going to hear about for the next 3 months. Just like COVID market bottomed in uh March 23rd, 2020. Negative headlines\n\nThe market was already up 50%. Uh buyback authorizations have increased 19% year-to date. Not only are they buying their own shares in this uncertainty, but corporate insiders are buying a lot of stock. uh Zwag breath thrust which we recently had uh three 1 month later market up 5% 3 months later 8.6% 6 months later 16% these are all averages uh one year later 23%. So, a lot of things have happened in recent weeks that point to very good things happening over the next 6 to 12 months. And based on some of the rational headed comments coming out of the White House, uh that that looks like a decent probability. Now, cash-like ETFs, but look, when the robins are singing, it&#39;s already spring, you know, and in many cases, you missed it. Uh, in this case, there&#39;s still enough to do, but uh, really my hat is off for all of the existing clients uh, and new clients that put in new money when I said now&#39;s the time. Uh, and those who held their wits about them as well, whether if you weren&#39;t in a position to put in new money, maybe you have a lot of illquid private equity and other things that you couldn&#39;t get out of. Um, kudos for just hanging tough and know trusting the process and knowing the intrinsic value of the businesses you own was intact and uh and now they&#39;re rebounding and and off to off to the races. Whether we hit new highs in four months or eight months, it&#39;s it&#39;s really immaterial. The key is you held pat when so many others flushed in the hole. Uh particularly hedge funds to be honest with you. Uh all these cowboys that were on super long levered long mag 7, they&#39;re smoked and most of them are liquidating and now out of business. S&P 500 returns a year after spike in policy uncertainty index. Uh with the exception of 2001 which was 911 and 2006 which was the housing crisis the other 89 instances have been monstrous between 9.7% and 63%. That&#39;s amazing. scorecard on buying the dip. Average return for S&P 500 following drop of at least 5% over two days. 200 days later, you&#39;re up 10%. So again, China firms announced biggest buyback in 14 months. That includes Alibaba. Insider buying and selling. Uh insiders now starting to buy in a material way. That&#39;s uh very very key. Number of containers ships selling from China to the US. So that&#39;s dropped off quite a bit. That&#39;s why that that should get everyone to the table here to come up with something reasonable uh which does you know can help China achieve what they want to do which is more domestic consumption and help the US what we we want to do slightly more domestic manufacturing active listings on the rise for real estate new home sales top all estimates on surge in the south uh all the federal lands are going to be open we showed you the map a few weeks ago southwest as a matter of In fact, there&#39;s a ton of federal land here on the Big Island, and I was telling the helicopter pilot, maybe Trump&#39;s going to open it up for development. They didn&#39;t want to hear that. It&#39;s always nimi, not in my backyard. But, uh, I can imagine that they would be in high demand if they started to do that. A AI bull bear spread below 20. So, this is a record, uh, level of bearishness. That&#39;s obviously inflection points. Soft data has recently surprised to the downside amid hard data resilience. So people are getting more negative even though the data is showing strength. The actual data spending growth is not weakened among the highest income households. Higher income households own around 90% of all corporate equities and mutual funds. That&#39;s the top 20% in income quintile. That&#39;s a big quintile by the way. Total return over 30 years. Gold versus the S&P 500. not even close for everyone chasing gold. Uh S&P has dramatically uh outperformed. Manufacturing employment as a share of total employment has been declining steadily for 80 years even after the US MCA. Past two weeks have seen historic breath. This is from Carson. Good things happened 12 months out all year since 1950 up about double digits. Personnel is policy. So as Bessant has taken the helm, returns have been positive. As Lenik and Navaro had spoken, returns have been negative. Equity leadership cycles and peaks, US versus developed markets, US versus emerging markets. You can see we are at an absolute extreme. And yes, it started dramatic outperformance in the first quarter this year. This is just the beginning of the beginning. This is like the introduction to the book and then like the prologue. Like we&#39;re not even in chapter one. So, if you don&#39;t have international exposure, as we&#39;ve been pounding the table on, and the right international exposure, uh, you&#39;re not going to do as well as you&#39;ve done looking in the rearview mirror through looking through the windshield. Moving forward, White House considers slashing China tariffs to deescalate trade war. China signals openness to US trade talks, but not under duress. for our country. China&#39;s patriots are buying the dip in equities. US chip controls will benefit China&#39;s Nvidia rivals like Huawei say analysts. Of course they will. China Tech groups unintended consequences of emotional policymaking. China Tech groups and by the way Deepseek and Quinn 2.5 all of these LLMs that are that are absolutely destroying chat GPT and others were made by necessity, not by design per se. Um uh the chips that they&#39;re developing internally, all this stuff wouldn&#39;t have happened. We could have kept them dependent on us. Instead, we forced them to innovate. Uh, which is kind of against what they&#39;ve done historically. They prefer to copy. But now, we&#39;ve forced them to innovate and now they&#39;re forced to be reckoned because they&#39;re they&#39;re eating our lunch in AI. And, uh, and that trend is going to continue. Uh, China tech groups lead multi-billion dollar campaign to help exporters sell at home domestic consumption. Who&#39;s the toll taker? 40 cents of every dollar? Ali effing baba. Okay. China accelerates budget spending to counter tariff wos. Huge stimulus spending. Uh Baba is going to be the biggest toll taker there. Hong Kong stock rise on China stimulus. Hope ignore Wall Street selloff. Auto groups lobby Trump administration against parts tariffs in rare unified message. So this is a big deal for Cooper Standard. US officials mole easing tariffs target the auto industry. Uh March sees best new vehicle affordability in 45 months, but tariffs loom and large. Uh we know that except they&#39;ve got to now replenish the inventory. So the game is on. Trump&#39;s U-turns on Powell. China follow dire economic warnings. Trump team needs a trade deal to stop investor panic. That&#39;s from Charlie Gaspirino over at Fox Business. He&#39;s right. I think we probably get one from India or we probably get one from South Korea or we probably get one from Japan. But we get one and then everyone falls in line and we rock and roll. Vietnam kicks off trade talks with us as plain deal takes shape. Uh they&#39;ll get some of Chinese planes. It&#39;s hedge funds, not foreign investors that have been dumping stocks, says JP Morgan. Hartnet amid apocalyptic sentiment, a bullish road map emerges. He&#39;s one of the best strategists on the street from Bank of America. We we cite his Bank of America fund manager survey every single month. Deutsche Bank sees major dollar decline amid selloff. That&#39;s typical European pessimists always downgrade in the hole. Uh even though we remain uh intermediate term bearish on the dollar based on the type of people getting bearish after the fact, I expect a short-term bounce in the dollar. Boeing to sell some of its navigation business in $10.55 billion deal. So you add the cash at $24 billion plus the undrawn credit line of10 billion plus the uh sale now of $10.5 billion about net 10 after taxes coming to Boeing. Uh you&#39;ve got $44 billion of liquidity with $53 billion of debt. So the rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated for everyone who had been saying Boeing could go bankrupt. You&#39;ve got brain damage. Uh Boeing&#39;s got a half a trillion dollar backlog and you were the ones that were selling at 130 and now it&#39;s at 173 going to 250 and beyond.

You&#39;ve got brain damage. Uh Boeing&#39;s got a half a trillion dollar backlog and you were the ones that were selling at 130 and now it&#39;s at 173 going to 250 and beyond.

So, uh we probably hit some resistance here coming up next week. This downtrend line at 48 5484. Now that everyone&#39;s happy, we probably go up a little more. Maybe we retest 5100. Maybe we don&#39;t. But um I think the bottom is in or or certainly I wouldn&#39;t expect more than a retest, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t expect that. I I think 5100 test would look good.

We just we&#39;ve just basically covered the liquidity. We&#39;ve covered the key points. They&#39;re turning the corner. Their free cash flow was negative, but it&#39;s going to be positive by the second half. It was much less negative than anticipated. That was the biggest news. The production is looking good. The engineering focus is looking good. The backlog increased to over a half a trillion dollars this quarter. And uh up until a few days ago, you couldn&#39;t give the stock away. Now people are getting the message and they&#39;ll really be chasing after it after it hits 200 when no one wanted it when we were on Vney at 130. So [Music] um it&#39;s not that often you get to buy such a clear duopoly at such low prices. I mean something like that happens a couple times in a career and uh and it just recently happened. So I hope you all took advantage. That&#39;s one of our largest positions, by the way, in the US. Uh [Music] um maybe I have to check that. It may it might be as it might almost be the size of Cooper Standard. Maybe more. I got to check where that is now. Um not for long though. Cooper&#39;s Cooper&#39;s going to be way more than a double. I can assure you that. That&#39;s our our view on that. We&#39;ve covered that many times. Uh so free cash flow usage was good. commercial backlog grew by more than 25 billion. Okay, let me just get this thing going here. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have my proper mouse with me down in Hawaii. 787 production starting to increase. 7 737 at 38 going to 42. Uh then 52 is where it was at peak back in 2018. They&#39;ll get back there with approvals over time. Uh tariff exposure, they basically went through that and [Music] uh talked about the impact. It&#39;s it&#39;s not as material as people were afraid of. Net annual impact of tariffs on input costs is less than $500 million annually. That&#39;s very very important. That&#39;s kind of dimminimous for a company of this size. Uh and the deals are probably going to get better. They got the digital aviation solutions sold to Toma Bravo. Uh 777X received FAA authorization for additional aerodynamic brakes and engine testing with daily flights ongoing and performing well. Uh, and obviously they got the big F f47 contract worth $50 billion with the US government and this time it&#39;s going to be a profitable contract versus previous fixedpric contracts that carried undue risk and turned into money losing ventures. Uh, all six KPIs continue to perform well and show stability with every m metric currently in the green including final ticketing which had been below required thresholds during Q4. Uh you can go through the earnings call. We highlighted the important parts here and let me just see if there&#39;s anything else. Sentiment as you can see all the active managers got washed out at the lows. 35% equity exposure. Now, this is going to turn around and move back up to 100 and then everyone will want it and that&#39;s when you can lighten up in the short term. REITs uh top 30 weights estimates in the last 60 days. Um down 2.93% for 2025, up for next year. So, we&#39;re going to start to see a lot of backend loaded stuff. Utilities, let&#39;s see what they did. Um down 64 basis points. That&#39;s not bad. These estimates will continue to come down on a lagged effect from the tariff stuff, but the bottom may have priced in the worst and then they&#39;ll start to recover over time like we see in every major 20% correction. Uh economic data, nothing really crazy. Durable goods orders were f unbelievable. a lot of pull forward that cars that that cash flow is going to help Cooper uh up 9.2% versus 2.1%. A lot of that&#39;s car related, durables excluding defense up 10.4%. This was a big big deal. Uh initial jobless claims 222,000. That&#39;s why you&#39;ve got Waller and the Cleveland governor out talking about June as a possible cut if jobs if we start to lose jobs. Atlanta GDP Fed now has got the uh administration",

Um, the problem here is  what I hate about what they did is they went crazy on the uh the weed trade when there all that hype was there and they got shellacked. Um, they chased a trend versus sticking to their knitting and it hurt them badly, but probably not badly enough for the stock to be down this much. So, I do like it here, Drew. I think you&#39;re on your game and I I think your time is pretty good. um you know, if you bought a bunch at 53, even if it went down to 40 before it starts to recover, I think you&#39;re in good shape.\n\nBrad K asks, &quot;Alcoa, AA, this has always been a really bad business and a poorly run business. So I&#39;m going to just say no because I&#39;ve seen so many opportunities to buy it and uh passed every time and invariably was proved correct. Um they do seem to be inflecting here. I just fig they seem to chronic and and again this just comes from experience. There&#39;s something cultural about Alcoa that they continue to seem to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory over and over and over. Maybe this time&#39;s different. If there&#39;s a new CEO, maybe take another look. But um this is a business that I&#39;ve never owned and never regretted not owning. Let&#39;s put it that way. Uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance sheet. I remember they used to have that CEO with the accent who would come on every single quarter and Wall Street uh till his eyes were brown. but he had such a sophisticated accent that they believed all his and he lost them so much money that eventually they kicked him out and he had to go build this fake town for Saudi Arabia that doesn&#39;t even exist now. Uh and um he did as good a job with that project as he did with Alcoa and uh needless to say the city does not exist and I don&#39;t think he&#39;s running the project anymore. Um next week we&#39;ll cover how Tom really feels about a company. Uh let&#39;s just talk here. So revenues seem to be ramping up. Earnings inflecting from being negative. Ebida is starting to recover. It&#39;s just so inconsistent. It&#39;s so cyclical. You&#39;re trying to make the cyclical trade, which I understand that. I&#39;m okay with that. But I I I don&#39;t want to play the timing game with this because this the good the good times never last with Alcoa. So, if you get a few string a few quarters and the stock doubles, great. Um balance sheet looks okay. They&#39;ll find a way to screw you. Maybe they&#39;ll issue a ton of shares as the stock goes up, but they just have never been a shareholder wind type of company. W\n\nthe most skin in the game, personal skin in the game, than he&#39;s ever had in any other deal. In QXO, he only put in 150 million. In URI, he put in less. So, there you go. Uh, Leaf Foster, what do you think of Petra Boss? We covered this a million at times. The financials look fine, but you have a socialist in power, so at any moment in time, they could cut the dividend. They haven&#39;t done it yet. They may never do it, but it&#39;s it&#39;s not a game I want to play. \n### ASK_ME_ANYTHING_QA\nWas hoping you could take a look at at core ATKR company offers conduit fittings and various other electrical infrastructure related parts with its manufacturing operations and customers concentrated in the US. Okay, I think we looked at this one a couple weeks ago. ATKR So okay, so prices declined with revenues and cash flows. So what you need to prove out in order to take a stab at this is what&#39;s the turnaround plan and you know this is a serious broken momentum stock and this is where you can get trapped. you know, you have a stock that was a 10bagger and then it comes down, you know, 60% in a short period of time. It&#39;s probably going to take two or three years to build the base on this. I&#39;m willing to be wrong on that, but um that turnaround plan is probably just beginning solution polys. All right, let&#39;s take a look at some financials. So revenues have dropped off from 4 billion down to three billion give or take. Free cash flow is almost haved. Balance sheet 350 million of cash. $700 million debt. That&#39;s probably okay. Share count has come down a lot. All t\nhere is  to do here uh Aaron is you got to start your research process. How are they going to turn it around? Does it look credible? What have they said in the past and what&#39;s happened? What have they been saying the last eight quarters as revenues and and cash flow have been declining? And if you can get comfortable that their turnaround plan is plausible and you verify by looking at competitors and seeing what competitors are are saying in the space and doing channel checks and doing it. You might have it, but just taking a look at it, I think it&#39;s way, way too early. It&#39;s a broken It&#39;s a broken Momo stock. Any thoughts on Flow Traders, Europe&#39;s leading market maker? Uh, that&#39;s a business I tend to avoid or flow. What? F L Flow Traders. Yeah, looks like your cash flow peaked four years ago. Never looked back. The stock price is going up without the cash flow. It&#39;s a pass for me. Theo Djardan Apache we covered in the past. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not great. The reason that we&#39;re not not as sanguin is we love our com stock. [Music] Um yeah, I I I think we said yes to this a few times. We just prefer com stock and we covered all the reasons why. So go back to the last few weeks of podcast. Uh buying more VF Corp. You bet. Yeah. All new clients got VF Corp as a full position. So uh nothing to think about there. That&#39;s just tariff noise and BS. You still got the same winner running the show uh turning things around and the tariffs will be what the tariffs are, but their their business modes are going to be their business modes and they&#39;re they&#39;ve got they&#39;ve done the Dtock. They&#39;re now going to ramp it up and Bracken&#39;s done this a gazillion times with different brands going back to his PNG days with Old Spice, then Logitech, 26 Bagger, and it&#39;s going to do the same exact thing. if you&#39;ve got to sell a couple brands to buy a couple new more that that&#39;s what VF Corp has been doing for 125 years and they&#39;re going to do for the next 125 years. So, they&#39;ve cleaned everything up. They sold they they took solveny risk off the table with Supreme. Could they sell the pack business to get a little more cash if they had to? They sure could. Uh but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll have to. Moody&#39;s reported that March Auto Sales was 175 million on an annualized basis due to pull forward. Uh, however, they believe April and May could be ugly. The inventories will still have to be rebuilt. The lobbying is in place, etc. At the end of the day, David, [Music] um, the average car on the road is still 13.5 years. So, in the worst case scenario, if the cost of a car goes up $5,000, people are going to buy smaller cars. So, it&#39;s going to go up $2,500. And then they&#39;re going to offer more and more incentives. The affordability is coming down. Why? Because the gig is up. They got away with murder during COVID because they could control supply and demand was high. Demand is even higher now. But they can no longer control supply because the Koreans are going to come in and flood their ass with cheap cars if they don&#39;t if they don&#39;t compete. Okay? And so now they&#39;re competing. They&#39;re all offering incentives. It&#39;s race to the bottom in terms of margins for the OEMs which is going to benefit the auto parts suppliers because they get paid on volumes and their prices are pre pre-negotiated in the case of Cooper Standard just finished all their negotiations in the last 6 months. Uh so they&#39;re going to mint cash on the race to the bottom with huge volumes. And like Generrack generators, the fastest growing states are the ones with the highest penetration. When your neighbor gets a new car, which on average they haven&#39;t for 13 and a half years, um everyone starts to get new cars and the game is going to be on and the incentives are going to be on and it&#39;s going to be a race to protect share by the US OEM. So, they&#39;re going to have to do more and more dealer incentives, and you&#39;re seeing it every single day on commercials, which is going to be a huge benefit for Cooper.

Um, auto industry aggressively lobbies. Okay, we got that one already. Uh, Peter Rardo asked a question. Literally, this is what they wrote as their name. Uh, really appreciate the great podcast. Extremely generous person. Want to ask the likelihood we get a repeat of the 70s or did we start our secular bare market in bonds being invested in energy is the best way. Thoughts on national Varco? National Varco is kind of a dog, but we've covered it a million times. I think at these levels, you're okay. There are better ways to play it. I think if you have to play servicesers, you're probably better off going up the food chain to slumber so you can sleep easily at night. But if you want to uh dig in the dumpster, I would say Varco is probably going to be, you know, probably be a double over a few years. Again, we looked at the financials a few weeks ago. I hate to even take time to do it again. I think it was generally okay. Let me just take a quick look for solveny risk and then we can move on. Yeah, this one will be okay. Um, same conclusion we came to three or four times in the last few podcasts. All right. Uh, so here's an Australian that owns US ADRs. Should he exchange?

The edge is do you want the one of the biggest share companies in the business with ample liquidity to sit through the trough of the cycle uh and to own it at an enormous discount to intrinsic value with or without tariffs? And if the answer is yes, I would like one of the biggest players that has ample liquidity to ride it out because it&#39;s a huge hockey stick of operating leverage as prices come back and all the small players get blown out, then Albamaro is for you and that&#39;s why we own it.

But um it it really doesn&#39;t matter. you&#39;re going to so far so dramatically outperform anything else you could do that it it deserves a position in the portfolio. Nothing is ever a guarantee. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a position. Not your whole mortg mortgage your house, but a serious position because this guy has made so much incredible amounts of money for shareholders over and over and over throughout his career. And he&#39;s got the most skin in the game, personal skin in the game, than he&#39;s ever had in any other deal. In QXO, he only put in 150 million. In URI, he put in less. So, there you go. Uh, Leaf Foster, what do you think of Petra Boss? We covered this a million at times. The financials look fine, but you have a socialist in power, so at any moment in time, they could cut the dividend. They haven&#39;t done it yet. They may never do it, but it&#39;s it&#39;s not a game I want to play. Aaron L, thank you for all you do. I find your weekly video very extremely valuable, especially during those periods of peak uncertainty. The consistency you bring is truly admirable. Thank you, Aaron. That&#39;s very kind of you say. Was hoping you could take a look at at core ATKR company offers conduit fittings and various other electrical infrastructure related parts with its manufacturing operations and customers concentrated in the US. Okay, I think we looked at this one a couple weeks ago. ATKR So okay, so prices declined with revenues and cash flows. So what you need to prove out in order to take a stab at this is what&#39;s the turnaround plan and you know this is a serious broken momentum stock and this is where you can get trapped. you know, you have a stock that was a 10bagger and then it comes down, you know, 60% in a short period of time. It&#39;s probably going to take two or three years to build the base on this. I&#39;m willing to be wrong on that, but um that turnaround plan is probably just beginning solution polys. All right, let&#39;s take a look at some financials. So revenues have dropped off from 4 billion down to three billion give or take. Free cash flow is almost haved. Balance sheet 350 million of cash. $700 million debt. That&#39;s probably okay. Share count has come down a lot. All right. So all t"

They&#39;re now going to ramp it up and Bracken&#39;s done this a gazillion times with different brands going back to his PNG days with Old Spice, then Logitech, 26 Bagger, and it&#39;s going to do the same exact thing. if you&#39;ve got to sell a couple brands to buy a couple new more that that&#39;s what VF Corp has been doing for 125 years and they&#39;re going to do for the next 125 years. So, they&#39;ve cleaned everything up. They sold they they took solveny risk off the table with Supreme. Could they sell the pack business to get a little more cash if they had to? They sure could.

      "the liquidity to wait through the cycle? And Albamaro is one of the biggest lithium producers in the world. They&#39;ve got $3.5 billion of liquidity. So as whether there&#39;s a 20% or 0% or 50% or 145% tariff, they&#39;re still going to have the most share and demand for lithium is not going to change. So as far as handicapping whether a 20% tariff will hurt earnings by this month or 30 and guessing and pretending you have some edge, there is no edge. The edge is do you want the one of the biggest share companies in the business with ample liquidity to sit through the trough of the cycle uh and to own it at an enormous discount to intrinsic value with or without tariffs? And if the answer is yes, I would like one of the biggest players that has ample liquidity to ride it out because it&#39;s a huge hockey stick of operating leverage as prices come back and all the small players get blown out, then Albamaro is for you and that&#39;s why we own it.
