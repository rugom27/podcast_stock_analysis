[0.64s] Welcome to Hedge Fund Tips with Tom
[2.879s] Hayes. I&#39;m Tom Hayes and this is your
[5.64s] 288th videocast podcast for the week
[8.24s] ending April 24th, 2025, live from the
[12.32s] Big Island, Hawaii. Aloha everyone. I&#39;ve
[15.679s] got my authentic Tory Richard shirts
[18.96s] that I got over at the King shops. And
[21.6s] uh excited to bring a lot to you. But as
[24.0s] always, family first, then we&#39;ll get
[25.68s] right down to business. Uh there&#39;s
[27.599s] Annabelle paddle boarding. Uh we&#39;re at
[30.16s] Mal Mount Alani
[32.559s] uh which is just incredible. That&#39;s the
[34.239s] private beach club there. She&#39;s able to
[35.92s] paddle board, snorkel. The girls loved
[38.48s] it. This was an incredible
[41.68s] um luau that we went to in downtown Kona
[45.76s] at one of the Marriotts. It&#39;s the most
[47.52s] authentic one. It was beyond
[49.76s] expectations. How this thing doesn&#39;t
[51.52s] have five-star reviews all across the
[54.0s] board is beyond me. They they pulled
[55.559s] this pig that they cooked in the ground
[59.359s] out of the ground and like chopped it
[61.039s] up. Absolutely incredible. Uh too much
[63.84s] to cover. As you can see, uh I don&#39;t
[66.64s] have the uh proper height to be a hoola
[69.88s] dancer. Uh so we&#39;ll just uh stick to
[72.88s] stocks. This was at Unu uh excuse me,
[77.2s] this was at Ulu at the Four Seasons.
[79.439s] Caitlyn and I went out for date night.
[81.36s] We met the most incredible couple couple
[85.119s] um Jerry and Kathleen Grundhuffer. And I
[89.439s] know Jerry, I didn&#39;t even realize when I
[91.6s] was talking to him. I&#39;m so embarrassed
[93.92s] now. Uh this guy is an absolute legend.
[97.439s] He was the chairman and CEO of US Bank
[100.88s] Corp when Warren Buffett owned US Bank
[103.68s] Corp. And spoke about how incredible
[106.159s] Jerry was in all of his annual letters
[108.32s] and we were talking about his rollups.
[110.799s] He&#39;s just uh one of the greatest banking
[113.68s] CEOs in the history of the United
[116.24s] States. And like all great uh men, there
[120.079s] is even more spectacular woman behind
[123.119s] them. Uh we just had so much fun meeting
[126.32s] with them. And so much so that we missed
[128.399s] our dinner reservation cuz we had to go
[130.479s] pick up the girls because they were
[132.0s] swimming with the local uh swim club,
[134.16s] which we&#39;re going to talk about uh in
[136.08s] just a second. But Jerry and Kathleen,
[137.84s] great to spend time with you at Ulu. Uh
[141.36s] this is with the girls
[143.72s] downtown. Uh okay, this is the swim club
[146.64s] that the girls swam with, the Y Kaloa uh
[150.879s] swim club. Absolutely incredible. They
[154.319s] became honorary team members for the
[156.239s] week and enjoy training with their team
[158.16s] and making new swim friends on the Big
[160.56s] Island. So, that&#39;s super, especially
[162.16s] because Annabelle and Mimi both have
[164.319s] meets and games this weekend. Moving
[166.8s] along, that was the helicopter tour. Uh,
[170.16s] that&#39;s a panoramic view. That&#39;s why that
[172.0s] picture looks strange. That&#39;s a normal
[173.44s] view uh with Caitlyn, the girls, and I.
[177.2s] We landed the helicopter at this special
[179.44s] waterfall that you can only get to via
[181.84s] helicopter. You could see it&#39;s
[183.28s] absolutely incredible. That was Blue
[185.12s] Hawaiian Tours. That&#39;s me and Annabelle
[187.44s] in the front, which was super cool.
[189.519s] That&#39;s a little view for you. That&#39;s the
[191.68s] girls in the back. Um, Caitlyn and Mimi.
[195.76s] This is a volcano that was active twice
[198.48s] this week. Of course, the day we went,
[200.239s] it wasn&#39;t active, but you know what?
[202.319s] I&#39;ll take no wind uh in a helicopter to
[204.959s] an active volcano any day of the week.
[206.959s] So, that was that. More pictures. I
[209.84s] could tell you, I mean, I s the ladies
[212.239s] in the audience were just staring at
[213.92s] this guy non-stop the entire night. uh
[216.72s] is kind of weird, but nonetheless, uh
[219.599s] here&#39;s some pictures from that and you
[222.319s] should definitely check it out when
[223.519s] you&#39;re in
[224.76s] town. Um this was uh played Mount
[229.72s] Alani South and North all week. I want
[233.2s] to thank my friends Robert and Desiree
[235.519s] Smok. We stayed at their house right on
[238.4s] the third hole of Mount Alani South. If
[242.72s] you&#39;re ever coming to Hawaii, you should
[245.439s] rent their house. It&#39;s absolutely
[248.0s] perfect. Three bedrooms. These are the
[250.879s] views from your backyard. Look at that
[252.72s] sunset. You can walk to the beach club.
[254.799s] They have golf carts. You can go to the
[257.12s] resort. You can go to Canoe House, which
[259.44s] is seriously one of the best
[261.04s] restaurants. I&#39;m going to put this link
[265.24s] um right
[268.199s] in the show notes. So go to
[272.759s] YouTube.com, click on hedge funfund tips
[277.44s] uh go go to hedge fund tips channel. So
[280.32s] in the search bar for YouTube, just go
[282.08s] to hedge fund tips and then under
[283.84s] episode 288, right under the play
[286.32s] button, you&#39;ll see show notes, I&#39;ll put
[288.24s] the link. If you&#39;re coming to Hawaii,
[290.08s] you can rent their house on Airbnb.
[292.0s] Absolutely incredible. Um so that&#39;s
[295.6s] that. And then couple more things just
[299.52s] wanted to cover real
[301.479s] quick and then we&#39;ll get down to
[303.68s] business
[305.32s] here.
[307.8s] Okay, so that&#39;s the south course. That
[310.08s] was my favorite. A lot of lot of people
[311.759s] like the north course, by the way, which
[314.16s] is really cool. They&#39;ve got these bucket
[316.52s] greens. Uh that&#39;s more from there.
[319.6s] That&#39;s a south course picture. And you
[322.4s] just play it. I mean, it&#39;s unbelievable
[324.08s] all the water holes on the south course.
[325.68s] But then again, I&#39;m a tourist. This is
[327.28s] the bucket hole on the north course, par
[329.28s] 3. Really cool. That&#39;s all lava rock.
[332.72s] Um, that&#39;s the girls at Napua, which is
[336.8s] a great restaurant in the private beach
[339.759s] club when you stay at Robert and
[342.4s] Desire&#39;s house. Uh, that is Canoe House,
[346.08s] which is also in this development. I
[348.8s] think that&#39;s the best restaurant I&#39;ve
[350.0s] been to in 5 years. Uh,
[353.24s] and the the Wagu was incredible. There
[356.72s] were two types of Wagu, two types of
[358.32s] fatty tuna. Uh, this beet salad was
[361.039s] incredible. Their bread, they&#39;re famous
[362.56s] for their bread. It&#39;s pull apart bread.
[364.24s] The corn, you got to check it out. And
[366.56s] obviously, the views don&#39;t suck. So, uh,
[369.039s] there you go. That was that. That&#39;s the
[372.24s] backyard from the house. Ah, this is my
[374.8s] new friend Sheriff. He&#39;s a member up in
[378.52s] Olympic and uh can&#39;t wait to play up
[381.52s] there. We had a great time on the south
[383.6s] course. He&#39;s a CIO for a big family
[385.6s] office and um actually worked for
[389.919s] Citadel for a while. So, this guy is a
[392.479s] serious hitter. Uh and I think that&#39;s
[397.039s] that. So, you got the link again in the
[399.6s] YouTube video. Want to thank Liz
[403.039s] Clayman, Brooke Halisgak, and Jake Mack
[406.56s] for having me on Fox Business Today live
[409.6s] from Hawaii to talk about my favorite
[411.68s] things, the market, uh, and a couple of
[414.319s] picks, Boeing and PayPal. We&#39;re going to
[416.319s] listen in here. All right, let&#39;s get
[418.4s] right to the floor show and bring in our
[419.919s] traders to talk about all of this and
[421.68s] the green on the screen. Joining me now,
[423.199s] trader Keith Fitzgerald and Great Hill
[425.36s] Capitals, Tom Hayes. Tom, look, uh,
[427.919s] regardless of a tarnish brand and the
[429.759s] long-term effects of that, these
[431.36s] back-toback gains sure feel good, right?
[433.44s] I mean, you&#39;ve got the VIX falling
[434.96s] again, back below, at least earlier, 28
[437.599s] at the moment. Yep, it&#39;s almost below 27
[439.919s] right now. Remember, it hit high of 60
[442.56s] earlier this month. Bond yields are
[444.479s] dropping at least on the long end.
[445.759s] What&#39;s not to love, Tom? What&#39;s not to
[448.479s] love? This is an example of the VIX
[450.16s] crush. And one more example of getting
[452.639s] paid for being greedy when others were
[455.28s] fearful. Uh you had a couple other
[457.28s] things out there today, Liz. Uh first
[458.96s] and foremost, you had Governor Hammock
[461.199s] from Cleveland talking about maybe
[463.68s] alluding to a cut in June. If the labor
[467.52s] market deteriorates, that&#39;s confirming
[469.52s] what Waller said. The market really
[471.759s] likes the idea of a June Fed cut. And
[474.4s] it&#39;s very interesting about this
[475.52s] correction, Liz, because this was the
[477.44s] first time that I&#39;ve seen in my long
[479.039s] career that professionals were actually
[481.44s] more scared. They were abject uh fear
[485.199s] two weeks ago and retail investors were
[487.919s] actually net buyers and retail
[490.0s] investors, believe it or not, have been
[491.599s] the ones that are on the right side of
[493.12s] the trade since co. They&#39;ve been buying
[495.28s] weakness and they&#39;ve been right and this
[497.28s] time will be no different. Well, uh
[499.36s] yeah, the retail investor is buying. The
[501.52s] hedges had been liquidating. They didn&#39;t
[503.759s] want to be caught flatfooted or maybe
[505.36s] some of them were. Keith Fitzgerald, you
[507.52s] too have had a long Wall Street career.
[510.56s] Uh what do you learn from this? Because
[512.8s] three days in a row is really lovely,
[514.479s] but we know that bottoming out processes
[516.64s] take a long time. Well, they do and
[519.519s] that&#39;s really the lesson here. I mean,
[520.8s] it&#39;s 45 plus years for me I&#39;ve been
[522.8s] doing this and fortunately gotten a lot
[524.32s] more right than we&#39;ve gotten wrong. But
[525.92s] you know what the lesson I take away
[527.279s] from this is bottoming is a process.
[528.8s] It&#39;s not a switch. There&#39;s no allcle
[530.48s] bell when it rings. So you want to
[532.24s] constantly play to Tom&#39;s point. You
[534.0s] know, when others are fearful, you want
[535.6s] to be greedy. And time and time and time
[537.6s] again, the best companies move ahead,
[539.519s] which is why you&#39;re seeing traders
[540.88s] trying to get ahead of it today. Yeah.
[542.88s] And you know, you do want to focus, Tom,
[544.56s] on things you actually can control. And
[547.04s] what do you feel you can control when
[549.6s] you certainly can&#39;t control, as we put
[551.519s] it, the he said, she said, she as in exi
[554.64s] Xi Jinping of of China, that we really
[557.68s] aren&#39;t sure exactly what the true story
[559.519s] is at the moment.
[561.76s] Yeah, Liz. Well, I I learned early in my
[563.92s] career that good things happen to people
[566.16s] who buy great companies when they&#39;re
[568.16s] marked down on sale. And what you saw
[570.16s] two weeks ago was one one of the sales
[571.839s] of a lifetime. And people were comparing
[573.519s] it to the great financial crisis. They
[575.6s] were comparing it to the tech wreck. And
[577.04s] the fact of the matter is those were
[578.959s] years and years of excess buildup. This
[581.68s] was started with a tweet. It could end
[583.6s] with a tweet. We saw tweets today about
[586.0s] positive talks with South Korea,
[587.92s] positive talks with India. So, we want
[589.76s] to buy highquality businesses marked
[591.839s] down and there&#39;s still quite a few of
[593.44s] them on sale right now. You know, the
[595.68s] the econo data is rearview mirror
[598.32s] looking, but we did just get durable
[600.24s] goods, Keith, and the durable goods
[601.839s] orders for last month skyrocketed well
[605.2s] beyond what was expected. A lot of that
[607.36s] was sort of front-loading, whether it
[609.04s] was companies who were putting in a ton
[610.72s] of orders ahead of what they perceived
[612.8s] would be the tariffs that President
[614.959s] Trump had threatened. So, you&#39;re looking
[616.959s] at something like that. uh they surged
[619.24s] 9.2% in March, well above the 2.0
[622.76s] forecast. So what do you suspect is
[625.279s] happening right now and how do you not
[627.6s] get caught uh sort of too deep in the
[630.88s] water with certain companies that may
[632.959s] shut down their inventory buildup?
[636.88s] That&#39;s a very interesting question. We
[638.399s] learned a very powerful lesson out of
[640.24s] COVID. We used to have just in time
[641.92s] deliveries, but what you&#39;re seeing this
[643.76s] big surge in my takeaway is just in
[646.0s] case. So, they&#39;re moving ahead. They&#39;re
[648.0s] doing what they should be. And the
[649.279s] companies that have margin power,
[650.88s] protection power, customers actually
[652.48s] like what they produce are going to come
[654.16s] out of this just fine. It&#39;s the guys
[655.68s] that are ordering, you know, the extra
[657.36s] window cleaning solutions that you worry
[658.88s] about because maybe they&#39;re doing it,
[660.079s] they don&#39;t have credit, maybe they don&#39;t
[661.44s] have the right cash flow, they&#39;re
[663.2s] stockpiling something. That&#39;s the wrong
[664.88s] move here. If you&#39;re doing it because of
[666.56s] customers, then that&#39;s the stuff I&#39;m
[668.0s] going to be all over. Yeah. Okay. Let&#39;s
[670.0s] talk customers. Tom, you like PayPal.
[673.2s] This is interesting. The CEO, Alex
[674.959s] Chris, was on stage right here at the
[677.04s] Semaphore conference earlier today. I
[679.04s] listened very closely to what he said.
[681.12s] He&#39;s got 400 million customers. And
[684.16s] what&#39;s important, I think, here is the
[686.32s] fact that he said a lot of these
[688.079s] customers are small businesses. And
[690.8s] here&#39;s specifically what he said. He
[692.8s] said, &quot;We are worried about rising costs
[695.44s] that small business will face under the
[697.839s] new Trump tariffs.&quot; Uh so what do you
[701.12s] what do you see for the future of PayPal
[703.279s] which sure is up 3% today but it has
[705.839s] gotten hammered this month.
[708.72s] Yeah this is still down 80% since the co
[712.0s] highs. We love this business. Record
[714.24s] free cash flow record revenues margins
[716.72s] increasing as you said 425 million
[719.2s] customers globally. When you take an
[720.88s] Uber Liz that&#39;s PayPal that&#39;s Brainree
[723.04s] working in the background that they own.
[724.72s] Venmo has become the Kleenex of
[726.639s] peer-to-peer payments. Uh, Alex Chris
[729.2s] ran small business at into it. That was
[731.44s] a 35 bagger stock while he was the CEO.
[734.639s] We know he&#39;s going to turn this around.
[736.16s] They&#39;ll generate 7 and a half billion of
[738.16s] free cash flow this year alone. And
[740.399s] they&#39;re going to buy back 20% of the
[743.04s] company over the next 2 to 3 years. Your
[745.519s] your slice of the pie is going to get
[747.12s] bigger and bigger with no new
[748.48s] investment. We think this is a
[749.92s] phenomenal opportunity. Their fast lane
[751.76s] checkout is increasing conversion for
[753.76s] small businesses. They need it. PayPal&#39;s
[756.079s] got it. Alex Chris is a winner. You want
[758.0s] to bet on him for sure. Yeah. You&#39;re
[759.68s] also betting on Boeing, which is
[761.279s] actually up about 2%. Even as Donald
[763.68s] Trump says Boeing should default China
[765.76s] over return planes. China&#39;s carriers
[767.839s] have returned, I think I think around
[770.16s] two planes and more are coming back.
[772.24s] They&#39;re not taking hold of them. But
[773.76s] Keith, let&#39;s finish with you. What are
[775.279s] you buying right now? I mean, I saw one
[777.04s] of your favorites, Palunteer, back above
[778.88s] 100 earlier up 101. So that&#39;s
[781.68s] interesting.
[783.6s] Well, I go, you know, one of the other
[785.279s] key lessons I learned during my career,
[786.88s] Liz, is you go where Wall Street is
[788.8s] dumping hardest and fastest. And so, to
[790.8s] me, it&#39;s all the big names we talked
[792.32s] about. It&#39;s Palanteer, it&#39;s Nvidia, it&#39;s
[794.079s] Tesla. Those companies have been
[795.76s] punished in recent weeks, I think,
[797.519s] unfairly. Yet, every single one of those
[799.519s] businesses is continuing to power
[801.12s] forward. I think is worth considerably
[803.279s] more in the future. Tesla in particular,
[804.959s] 3 to 5x the end of the decade. Oh, man.
[807.839s] Palanteer&#39;s at 106 and change right now.
[811.2s] Yeah, that is one interesting moving
[813.12s] target.
[815.04s] It is. It is. And it&#39;s a great company
[816.639s] to latch on to because it&#39;s doing all
[818.399s] the right things at the right time that
[820.16s] still doesn&#39;t have any viable
[821.44s] competition. And if you look at
[823.36s] customers, they&#39;re running to it, not
[825.36s] away from it. Gotcha. Yeah, we see that
[827.2s] now. Hey, it&#39;s great to have you both.
[828.56s] Keith, Tom, we&#39;ll see you again soon.
[830.079s] Thank you.
[832.88s] And we&#39;re back. Now, let&#39;s go
[835.72s] to some of these uh
[841.32s] incredible indicators that we look at
[843.6s] every week and get through some of the
[845.519s] data. Uh first and
[848.44s] foremost, want to take a look at the put
[851.76s] call coming down. That&#39;s what I
[853.279s] referenced. Also, the VIX crush. When it
[855.839s] goes above 50 and drops below, you tend
[857.6s] to get rallies. You&#39;re starting to see a
[858.88s] lot of breath. The PMO by all, we cover
[860.72s] a lot. PMO by S&amp;P. We don&#39;t care about
[863.92s] PMOs. It&#39;s just indicative of something
[866.079s] that&#39;s turning in the market. It&#39;s just
[868.16s] the like the 50-day uh 200 day uh
[871.6s] crosses that people think make make a
[873.6s] big difference. They don&#39;t. Uh one that
[875.519s] we do spend a lot of time on is option
[877.6s] skew. So the smart money buying
[880.24s] catastrophic insurance has withered to
[882.639s] nothing. It was very very elevated
[885.68s] um
[887.24s] beforehand. And you can see here the
[890.959s] Nazi summation and the uh
[893.639s] MLEN are turning up uh as well as these
[898.399s] two as well. So everything is starting
[900.16s] to look healthier again now that the
[902.88s] administration is backing off. We&#39;re
[904.399s] going to cover that. But if you feel
[906.88s] like you missed
[908.68s] everything, wake up and smell the roses
[911.12s] because there are still, as I shared
[913.6s] with Liz, so many amazing companies that
[916.48s] are still on sale. And I&#39;m not pointing
[918.8s] anything out, but this is just the Dow
[920.48s] to give you an idea. Like some of these
[922.399s] businesses that have been marked down.
[924.16s] We don&#39;t own any of these. Uh, United
[926.88s] Health, Chevron, Amgen, Merc, Cisco,
[932.639s] etc., etc. So yeah, companies are
[934.72s] starting to rebound a little bit. Nike
[936.399s] we&#39;ve talked a lot about.
[939.56s] Um and some of the defensives are
[941.92s] starting to get weaker like the
[943.04s] Coca-Cas, the Pepsis, etc. So people are
[945.36s] coming in from the thaw and jumping back
[948.48s] into the market. We even saw some tech
[950.399s] which we discover got discussed a couple
[952.72s] of weeks ago. We said I think uh Mag 7
[955.279s] could trade back to the top of the range
[957.12s] but probably not more this year. I think
[959.92s] that is beginning right now. You&#39;re
[961.839s] seeing some Meta, some Google, etc.
[965.36s] Starbucks is still marked down. There&#39;s
[967.44s] a lot of amazing stuff to do here and
[969.6s] we&#39;re going to talk about a bunch more
[971.279s] on this
[975.0s] call. Intel unveils turnaround plan
[978.16s] seeking to go back to his engineering
[979.92s] roots with lip boo tan. You know, I was
[984.24s] sharing actually with Jerry last night.
[986.88s] I&#39;m always talking stocks and uh I said
[989.6s] look you know the beauty of of Nvidia is
[991.92s] they&#39;re great at designing GPUs. The bad
[994.48s] news is that their business model
[996.24s] depends on the kindness of strangers and
[998.079s] so do all the chip designers and that
[1000.399s] stranger happens to be Taiwan
[1001.92s] Semiconductor. Now Taiwan Semiconductor
[1003.839s] said hey we&#39;re going to put 500 billion
[1005.6s] in the US. Oh good luck. You know we&#39;ll
[1007.519s] talk to you in five years after you get
[1009.12s] your zoning and you break ground and you
[1011.44s] hire all the people etc etc etc. Intel
[1014.32s] is at the 5 yard line and ready to go.
[1016.639s] They fired Gellzinger at the exact wrong
[1019.199s] time. Uh Lip Bhutan&#39;s going to take it
[1021.759s] from the 5yard line over to the
[1023.4s] touchdown. Uh Nvidia is currently
[1025.919s] testing chips, etc. They&#39;re cutting 20%
[1029.439s] of the workforce. They&#39;re getting lean
[1031.12s] and mean, and they&#39;re going to go back
[1032.559s] to designing absolutely incredible
[1035.12s] products and manufacturing products for
[1037.839s] not only the Nvidas of the world. And
[1039.839s] it&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve talked to experts that
[1041.839s] know Intel well, and they said the
[1043.52s] demand for GPUs is going to be so
[1047.4s] unlimited that it&#39;s not only going to be
[1051.12s] Nvidia, assuming Nvidia can get theirs
[1053.36s] produced. And the the bottleneck for
[1055.2s] doing that, they&#39;ve got to go through
[1056.96s] Intel or TSMC. And the reason their
[1060.08s] growth has declined, growth rate has
[1062.48s] declined, is because Taiwan
[1064.96s] Semiconductor can only give them an
[1066.48s] extra four billion dollars a quarter. So
[1068.32s] unless they find new production centers
[1071.12s] like Intel, uh their growth is going to
[1073.679s] growth rate is going to continue to
[1075.52s] decline because the base keeps getting
[1076.96s] bigger and they&#39;re only allocated 4
[1078.96s] billion of growth per quarter. So,
[1081.28s] that&#39;s where Intel comes in. And I&#39;m so
[1083.28s] excited to listen to the uh earnings
[1085.919s] call and um Lip Bhutan&#39;s plan on the way
[1091.2s] home on the uh on the airplane and
[1096.48s] um and that will be key. The other thing
[1099.12s] that I spoke to about with Liz was the
[1103.44s] odds of a
[1105.48s] June cut going up.
[1110.0s] Uh, as you can see here, it&#39;s
[1112.76s] around 63 62%. So, that&#39;s been
[1116.799s] vacasillating from 70 to 50. That came
[1119.6s] from Waller talking about if uh jobs
[1123.28s] start to get lost. And that was
[1124.88s] confirmed by the Cleveland Fed governor
[1127.28s] today. And that&#39;s part of the reason
[1129.36s] that the market was up as well as good
[1131.6s] news on South Korea talks, good news on
[1133.679s] India talks. Trump this week talking
[1135.919s] about taking down the China tariffs to
[1138.559s] get something done and saying that there
[1140.4s] were talks happening this morning. The
[1142.24s] Chinese are like we we don&#39;t know
[1143.679s] anything about those talks but okay.
[1148.36s] Uh but it shows and I think the key
[1152.16s] pivot point uh after the 90-day pause
[1156.44s] was meeting with the CEOs of Target,
[1161.52s] Walmart, Home Depot this morning and
[1163.6s] getting a sense of like, hey man, you
[1166.08s] know, we&#39;d love to uh manufacture
[1168.24s] sneakers in Mississippi, but at the end
[1170.4s] of the day, uh the economics just don&#39;t
[1173.2s] work if we&#39;re not paying the workers $2
[1175.2s] an hour. So, uh I think there&#39;s going to
[1177.679s] be a great compromise.
[1181.679s] uh and that great great
[1184.6s] compromise. The media may portray it as
[1188.32s] Trump softening, but the joke is going
[1192.4s] to be on the media in that he&#39;s going to
[1195.36s] wind up with tens of billions of
[1198.2s] dollars, if not a couple hundred billion
[1201.28s] dollars of revenue for the country that
[1204.08s] we wouldn&#39;t have otherwise. and do it in
[1206.24s] a sensible way such that uh we can get
[1210.72s] some clarity sooner so businesses can
[1212.88s] actually start to plan because capex has
[1214.88s] grown to a halt and uh and and
[1218.0s] businesses can start to feel confident
[1219.52s] and consumers can start to feel
[1220.88s] confident. So, they&#39;ll probably get
[1223.2s] their first quarter of negative GDP, but
[1226.72s] they&#39;re my sense is they&#39;re getting
[1228.559s] worried about getting a second quarter
[1229.919s] because if they get a second quarter of
[1231.84s] negative GDP, you got a technical
[1233.76s] recession and that&#39;s going to cost a lot
[1235.84s] more than what they&#39;ve saved on Doge or
[1237.679s] they&#39;ve raised from their external
[1239.28s] revenue service and it will all have
[1241.52s] been for absolute not and a complete
[1244.159s] waste of everyone&#39;s time and hurt a lot
[1246.159s] of retirees who probably sold in the
[1247.84s] hole two weeks ago and certainly a lot
[1250.48s] of hedge funds that were selling when
[1252.32s] they should have been buying or at the
[1253.679s] very least holding. Problem is they all
[1255.76s] run too much leverage so they got their
[1257.36s] asses handed to them. And uh it&#39;s the
[1259.679s] same story every single time. So, uh
[1262.08s] moving along. Uh we&#39;ve covered this for
[1265.28s] the last few weeks. I&#39;ve handheld you
[1266.96s] through this tumultuous period. I said,
[1268.96s] &quot;Hang on with your white knuckles,
[1270.48s] ladies and gentlemen. This two shall
[1272.159s] pass.&quot; And uh and that&#39;s starting to
[1274.48s] happen. It doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re not going
[1275.919s] back down to retest the lows. I&#39;d say
[1278.08s] the probability is lower now. That&#39;s for
[1280.32s] sure. But this was the one. If you
[1282.159s] remember uh three weeks ago, I&#39;m like,
[1285.039s] &quot;Guys, look, I I don&#39;t spend much time
[1287.679s] on technicals, but I shared this chart
[1289.84s] with a friend uh who was a little queasy
[1293.12s] there in the middle of it.&quot; And and by
[1294.72s] the way, he was one of the more
[1296.4s] optimistic of my friends. Uh some of
[1298.48s] them were really, really nervous and
[1300.64s] understandably so. Uh and I said, &quot;Look,
[1303.679s] you know, if this holds, we&#39;re probably
[1305.28s] doing okay.&quot; and and it immediately shot
[1307.679s] up that that the next day when Trump was
[1310.0s] like, &quot;Uh, buy now.&quot; I mean, we&#39;ve got a
[1314.159s] stock promoter and chief. Uh, and then,
[1316.96s] uh, we went back. It looked like we were
[1318.48s] going to retest, which we we had told
[1320.48s] you here that that was a possibility
[1323.12s] looking back at 2011 as an analog, and
[1326.64s] we also talked about the 2018 analog.
[1329.28s] Uh, and then it did that, and now it&#39;s
[1330.96s] working up higher. And I think you&#39;re
[1332.88s] now going to start to see a little bit
[1334.24s] of fear of loss. That&#39;s not to say no
[1336.799s] damage has been done, ladies and
[1338.08s] gentlemen. We are seeing some good
[1339.36s] earnings. We&#39;re seeing some mixed
[1340.64s] earnings. We&#39;re seeing two track
[1342.48s] guidances. If if he continues to do I if
[1346.0s] the craziness continues, here&#39;s what our
[1348.32s] earnings will look like in a recession,
[1349.919s] which is guaranteed. Uh or if they cut
[1353.84s] bait and do something re rational, uh
[1357.2s] we&#39;re actually cooking and we will
[1359.84s] report good numbers and we will continue
[1361.52s] to invest. And now that&#39;s starting to
[1364.08s] look like a possibility again with all
[1366.96s] of the news that we&#39;ve shared. This is
[1369.36s] looking like recovery. That&#39;s the So we
[1371.679s] did the the 15minute the 60 minute. I
[1375.76s] swear I haven&#39;t pulled up 15 minute and
[1377.52s] 60 minute charts in probably since the
[1379.84s] lows in 2022, which was the last time I
[1383.28s] ever came on this and said if you were
[1386.159s] going to put money to work with us,
[1388.799s] existing clients adding money, uh new
[1391.679s] clients getting started, now is the
[1393.52s] time. And the only other time that I&#39;ve
[1395.6s] done that is two weeks ago uh at the
[1398.88s] lows in early April. Uh and um and
[1403.6s] looking at all the opportunity, it it
[1406.4s] couldn&#39;t it really couldn&#39;t still be a
[1408.4s] better time. I mean, it&#39;s just
[1409.84s] phenomenal. Here&#39;s the daily, then the
[1412.12s] weekly, you know, weekly still you can
[1414.88s] see it. And then the monthly, barely a
[1417.76s] blip on the chart, but boy did that feel
[1419.76s] pretty abrupt for a moment there.
[1421.679s] Reminder, money show May 15th to 17th.
[1424.64s] I&#39;ll be down in Miami. I&#39;ll be in uh
[1428.08s] Dubai the week after uh meeting with a
[1430.799s] good friend and uh client and uh also
[1436.48s] the YPO out there
[1439.44s] uh for dinner. And then
[1443.88s] uh all my friends in
[1447.24s] Connecticut, I&#39;ll be back on the 10th
[1450.0s] and 11th on my way to New York and we&#39;ll
[1452.32s] we&#39;ll play up there. And then uh here&#39;s
[1455.44s] the quotes of the week. Peter Lynch,
[1457.2s] everyone has the brain power to make
[1458.48s] money in stocks. Not everyone has the
[1460.0s] stomach. If you are susceptible to
[1461.919s] selling everything in a panic, you ought
[1463.6s] to avoid stocks and mutual funds
[1465.679s] altogether. That&#39;s from the legendary
[1468.24s] Peter Lynch. Uh Charlie Munger, another
[1472.159s] mentor uh in in my view by reading and
[1475.919s] assimilating. Same with Warren. Uh it&#39;s
[1478.88s] the waiting that helps you as an
[1480.559s] investor and a lot of people just can&#39;t
[1482.48s] stand to wait. It&#39;s amazing. People, you
[1485.2s] know, texting me in the last couple
[1487.36s] weeks, wow, it&#39;s green today. Feels so
[1488.96s] good. Like we don&#39;t think ever in terms
[1492.64s] of days or weeks. We think in terms of
[1495.12s] months and years. Uh, so you know,
[1497.84s] Monday was a down day. I mean, honestly,
[1500.32s] the down days have been more exciting
[1501.84s] than the up up days because there&#39;s
[1503.44s] something to do. We can buy stocks. The
[1505.039s] up days, it&#39;s just like, okay, we got
[1506.64s] all the stocks we&#39;re going to have. Here
[1508.32s] we go. We&#39;re going higher. We got enough
[1509.76s] in the hole. We&#39;re excited. And so on.
[1512.159s] So, and that&#39;s the way you learn to
[1513.44s] think about it. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve I
[1516.0s] think it&#39;s been a very rare occurrence
[1518.08s] in my career where I&#39;ve bought stocks on
[1519.919s] a green day. There have been a couple of
[1521.76s] times, but um we always buy when it&#39;s
[1525.2s] red. So games are won by players who
[1527.52s] focus on the playing field, not by those
[1529.919s] whose eyes are glued on the scoreboard.
[1532.72s] And so many get distracted by looking at
[1537.76s] they spend their time looking at price
[1539.52s] on a daily basis. And when I get
[1541.679s] distracted by price because hedge funds
[1544.4s] are blowing up, pensions are for
[1546.08s] sellers, uh margin people are getting
[1548.64s] margin clerk calls and liquidations,
[1551.279s] uh I just go to the free cash flow and
[1554.08s] I&#39;m like, &quot;Huh, their cash flow keeps
[1556.0s] growing. I wonder why the price is going
[1557.84s] down so much in the short term. I better
[1559.36s] buy some more.&quot; Uh and and sure enough,
[1561.84s] that&#39;s always the right call. When the
[1563.44s] intrinsic value of the business goes up
[1565.44s] and the price goes down, if you play
[1567.52s] that arbitrage, uh you&#39;ll get rich over
[1570.0s] time. I mean, it&#39;s just that simple if
[1572.08s] you&#39;re patient and if you manage risk
[1575.279s] through not using a lot of leverage and
[1577.36s] very few people can do that because you
[1579.44s] know what is everyone asking me about is
[1581.279s] everyone&#39;s asking me about all the
[1582.96s] stocks that are in the headlines. They
[1584.88s] have to ask me about Tesla. They have to
[1586.799s] ask me about Nvidia. And the companies
[1589.36s] that are the best are the ones like
[1590.96s] Boeing that were completely forgotten.
[1593.36s] And you had another chance to buy it at
[1595.88s] $129 two weeks ago. and we went on
[1598.559s] Vanney and we went on all the shows and
[1600.96s] people were like, &quot;Well, they&#39;re getting
[1602.159s] all their parts. Give me an effing
[1604.08s] break, ladies and gentlemen.&quot; At the end
[1605.76s] of the day, you know, the biggest joke I
[1608.08s] I I loved being on Vanney in real time
[1610.4s] when that headline came across that the
[1613.08s] Chinese are
[1615.96s] refusing are refusing Boeing deliveries.
[1619.039s] I mean, the Chinese refusing Boeing
[1621.2s] deliveries is like a diabetic refusing
[1623.44s] insulin. They need our planes way more
[1626.96s] than we need their sales already.
[1628.96s] India&#39;s like, &quot;We&#39;ll take them.&quot; Uh, can
[1630.88s] you paint over them and, you know, put
[1632.48s] India Airways or whatever they&#39;ve got
[1634.72s] over there, Jet Jet Airways, uh, uh, on
[1638.08s] the plane? And they&#39;re like, &quot;Yeah,
[1639.279s] we&#39;ll absolutely, we&#39;ll help you. Oh, by
[1641.039s] the way, China, you want to lose your
[1642.159s] place in line, you can get back when
[1644.24s] this tariff thing is negotiated, you can
[1646.4s] get back at the end of the line and wait
[1647.919s] 20 years for your next plane.&quot; Oh, you
[1649.679s] got Comarmac. They delivered a whopping
[1651.52s] 13 planes last year.
[1653.679s] uh you know, let me clear my throat.
[1656.32s] That&#39;s uh not gonna cut it. So, China is
[1659.12s] making a mistake there. Uh and
[1662.2s] um not the first, won&#39;t be the last. Uh
[1665.679s] but look, we&#39;ve made our share of
[1667.039s] mistakes as well. And uh they sooner or
[1669.6s] later, the universal thing, whether
[1671.6s] you&#39;re in the United States or around
[1673.2s] the world, is politicians always make
[1675.36s] the right decision after exhausting
[1677.36s] every other possibility. And this time
[1679.84s] will be no different. All right, let&#39;s
[1682.48s] get to our data charts. Uh so I can get
[1684.799s] out of here and go to Copper Bar on the
[1686.48s] way to the airport and have a nice
[1688.32s] dinner. Everyone says that place. By the
[1689.919s] way, want to thank
[1692.679s] um Terry H. You know who you are. And
[1695.72s] obviously Robert for uh S for putting
[1698.799s] together such an incredible and Desiree
[1701.279s] for putting together such an incredible
[1702.64s] list of things to do. We literally
[1704.399s] packed every minute that we could. uh
[1707.279s] you know, did all the snorkeling, did
[1708.88s] all the excursions, did everything, went
[1711.12s] to all the right restaurants. Uh and
[1713.12s] it&#39;s very rare that the girls get a week
[1714.88s] off training, so we had to jump on it.
[1716.799s] And very grateful for making it uh super
[1719.64s] memorable. Uh okay, let&#39;s talk about
[1723.96s] this some data. We love to do data.
[1727.279s] Burden ourselves with the fact share of
[1729.039s] Chinese exports to the US is 14%. So
[1732.72s] it&#39;s relatively dimminimous. It&#39;s even
[1734.799s] more diminishous for China these days.
[1737.2s] Another rare signal that better times
[1738.88s] could be coming. This is from Carson. Uh
[1742.039s] S&amp;P performance after three consecutive
[1744.559s] 1% gains. And you look a month out
[1749.399s] 1.3 6 months out 9% 12 months out 14%. I
[1753.679s] love his anecdotes and data that he puts
[1756.159s] out. He does a really good job. Uh
[1758.159s] forward 12 month PE ratio at the sector
[1760.88s] level. Obviously, you can see that uh
[1764.399s] energy is still the cheapest financials.
[1766.24s] Healthcare, there&#39;s a lot of opportunity
[1767.679s] there. Those are going to start to
[1769.039s] bounce aggressively. Friend sent over an
[1771.36s] amazing note on biotech. I think
[1773.12s] biotech&#39;s getting to ready to rip
[1774.96s] despite Maha and uh Robert Kennedy Jr. I
[1779.279s] think that part of the solutions for the
[1781.919s] problem are going to come from
[1783.2s] innovative biotech companies and they&#39;ll
[1784.96s] they&#39;ll get that sorted. Uh and better
[1787.12s] food and all the the great things that
[1788.799s] they&#39;re talking about as well. Uh, Peter
[1791.76s] Lynch, the key to making money in stocks
[1793.76s] is not to get scared out of them. Uh,
[1796.48s] here are flows into money market and
[1798.64s] cash ETFs. Uh, always when it gets this
[1802.0s] high, you find yourself at or near a
[1805.52s] huge buying opportunity and a low. World
[1809.52s] XUS equities versus the S&amp;P 500. You can
[1812.799s] see here breaking out, breaking this
[1814.799s] downtrend line. This is a theme that we
[1817.2s] came in at the beginning of the year
[1819.039s] pounding the hell out of the table. Get
[1821.279s] some international exposure. If not
[1823.2s] China, at least get some emerging
[1824.799s] markets, get some exus, get some Europe.
[1827.12s] And they&#39;ve dramatically outperformed. I
[1829.12s] think XUS is up 6.6% on the year. While
[1832.96s] the US has been down, albeit coming uh
[1836.0s] down less and less by the minute.
[1839.2s] China&#39;s broad budget deficit soarses the
[1841.84s] first quarter. Uh what that means in
[1844.32s] English is they are doing massive
[1846.48s] stimulus spending. They want to move as
[1849.2s] we covered in recent podcasts from you
[1851.679s] know 50 some odd percent consumption to
[1854.0s] 70% consumption within 10 years. US
[1857.12s] wants to move manufacturing back up to a
[1860.799s] higher percentage. Uh and that&#39;s
[1862.799s] rebalance is where a deal is made. Then
[1865.2s] you look at affordability of vehicles
[1867.6s] down to 36.7%.
[1870.32s] By the way, everyone&#39;s sending me like,
[1872.08s] &quot;Oh yeah, March, they shot the lights
[1873.919s] out. You&#39;ve never seen so much car
[1875.279s] production, which is going to be amazing
[1876.64s] for Cooper Standard free cash flow.&quot; Uh,
[1879.12s] but then they expect April and May to
[1881.76s] fall off a cliff. April and May aren&#39;t
[1883.2s] going to fall off a cliff because number
[1884.64s] one, there&#39;s still the urgency to to get
[1887.12s] in uh ahead of time. And number two,
[1890.32s] they now have worked down the
[1891.679s] inventories and they&#39;re going to have to
[1892.96s] replenish the inventories on top of it.
[1895.679s] This is going to continue as well as
[1898.559s] huge lobbying groups going to Washington
[1900.64s] and it looks like Trump is going to find
[1902.559s] some middle ground for the suppliers and
[1904.799s] for the automakers uh which will be a
[1907.679s] big deal. Uh margin debt expansion
[1911.36s] versus contraction indicator. We are
[1913.36s] nowhere near the extremes you see at or
[1915.6s] near tops. That&#39;s a good thing, not a
[1917.679s] bad thing. Dollar was another theme,
[1920.0s] weak dollar coming into the year, worst
[1922.32s] start to the year basically on record.
[1924.96s] Uh, everyone starting to get bearish the
[1927.039s] dollar. You&#39;re seeing some covers. We&#39;re
[1929.039s] going to cover the economist. Uh,
[1930.88s] everyone bearish the dollar, which means
[1932.159s] we&#39;re probably due for a bounce. It will
[1934.72s] be a counter trend rally. Get ready for
[1937.76s] that. Uh, here is emerging markets total
[1941.12s] return. Uh, actually, it&#39;s even
[1944.44s] uh bigger. This is European up 13%
[1948.48s] versus S&amp;P uh down
[1952.44s] 10%. 11. Yeah, 10%. Okay. Uh, Japan&#39;s
[1956.96s] core inflation accelerates, complicating
[1958.88s] bank, bank of Japan&#39;s rate path if they
[1961.039s] have to keep raising. Uh, carry trade
[1963.6s] continues to unwind, which is why we
[1965.44s] don&#39;t think the mag seven are going to
[1967.279s] get back above the top of the channel.
[1969.6s] But there&#39;s a long way between here and
[1971.2s] the top of the channel because they were
[1972.48s] the hit hit the hardest as was one of
[1974.559s] our key themes coming into the year. Go
[1976.799s] back and listen to our November and
[1978.559s] December podcasts. uh price to fair
[1981.44s] value estimate by economic moat rating
[1983.36s] across size and style. All this says in
[1985.679s] English is small cap uh with wide moat
[1989.44s] according to the morning star ratings
[1992.159s] has the greatest discount to fair value
[1995.2s] i.e. the most undervalued. If you don&#39;t
[1997.679s] have small cap exposure and you&#39;re
[1999.36s] skeptical because it hasn&#39;t worked yet,
[2001.279s] this would be a time to uh uh get on
[2004.24s] board in our view. Again, all of this is
[2006.72s] opinion, not advice. Go to Headed
[2008.399s] Headund Tips and read
[2012.36s] headfundtips.com and click
[2016.2s] on the
[2019.159s] terms right there. Basically, it says
[2022.72s] it&#39;s for entertainment. Don&#39;t do
[2024.399s] anything. Talk to your financial
[2025.6s] advisor, etc., etc. Premium beverage. We
[2029.12s] are spending more on alcohol but
[2030.72s] drinking less. This is the whole theme
[2032.96s] of the Diagio narrative, which we&#39;ve
[2035.6s] discussed in past podcasts.
[2039.159s] Uh people&#39;s interest in escaping is
[2042.08s] never going to change. And if they&#39;re
[2043.679s] drinking less, they&#39;re going to want
[2044.799s] higher quality, higher premium. And
[2046.64s] that&#39;s where you benefit from doing the
[2049.28s] Dagios relative to the uh constellations
[2053.119s] or other type of uh companies in the
[2055.599s] category. The best and worst days are
[2057.599s] usually close to each other. That&#39;s why
[2059.359s] if you&#39;re out of the market or you think
[2060.8s] you time uh you you screw up twice
[2064.24s] because one you sell in the hole and
[2066.0s] then you think you&#39;re going to buy lower
[2067.359s] and it winds up moving against you. So
[2068.879s] you miss the gains back up so you double
[2070.639s] lose. It&#39;s the way people blow up and
[2072.399s] never never get ahead. Here are all the
[2075.159s] economies. Here are all the uh covers on
[2078.48s] the economist. How a dollar crisis could
[2080.399s] unfold. So probably get a bounce in the
[2082.879s] dollar soon. The envy of the world, the
[2084.72s] US. Uh so they&#39;re talking about the end
[2088.0s] of US exceptionalism. We&#39;ve covered in
[2089.839s] the past. We do think international is
[2091.679s] going to outperform because it runs in
[2093.359s] 10 to 15ear cycles. Uh but that doesn&#39;t
[2096.24s] mean US exceptionalism
[2098.72s] uh in the broad context will not
[2101.119s] continue. Never in the history of
[2102.8s] humankind has a greater company been
[2104.8s] created. And the reason is is because
[2106.72s] number one we were blessed with
[2108.16s] resources. Number two, we were blessed
[2109.76s] with oceans on both side for defense.
[2112.16s] But number three and the most important
[2113.76s] is we got the best ideas from everyone
[2117.119s] every other country in the world all
[2119.119s] converged on one great place called
[2121.0s] America and with hard work with a dream
[2123.839s] with a risk-taking DNA for them to take
[2126.0s] that chance to come to a new country.
[2128.24s] And the only thing that will hurt US
[2130.52s] exceptionalism is if we stop allowing
[2132.88s] great people from around the country who
[2134.64s] are hungry and looking for opportunity
[2137.44s] from coming in legally but coming in in
[2140.16s] in good numbers which has been our magic
[2142.88s] formula for success for you know
[2146.24s] hundreds of years and will continue to
[2148.88s] be moving forward. But our stocks might
[2151.839s] underperform for a decade or so. That&#39;s
[2153.599s] okay. uh they&#39;ll still do great housing
[2156.16s] supply and if you&#39;re under the surface
[2158.32s] in the unmagnificent 493 and small caps
[2161.52s] fortunes are going to be made. This is
[2162.96s] the type of environment where uh just
[2165.76s] insane amounts of money are made just
[2167.52s] like uh Cooperman and Buffett and
[2171.76s] Gabelli did in the 70s uh once the
[2175.48s] Nifty50 uh started to
[2178.2s] underperform just fortunes were made on
[2180.48s] a stockby stock basis. Billions.
[2182.72s] Billions. That&#39;s that&#39;s where they all
[2184.0s] became billionaires. Housing supply hits
[2185.839s] 5-year
[2186.839s] high. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s going to help
[2188.88s] with prices. Wait till they continue to
[2190.64s] open the federal lands and then all the
[2193.2s] things are going to happen. The housing
[2194.72s] supply, QXO, Stanley, uh, GenerRack,
[2198.96s] etc., etc. Frontloading is being mainly
[2201.68s] channeled through air freight, S&amp;P lags,
[2205.04s] uh, international by the most in 32
[2208.68s] years. You
[2210.839s] know for six months we told you coming
[2214.8s] into this year that this is not going to
[2217.92s] last forever. Start getting
[2219.52s] international, getting emerging markets.
[2221.68s] In our case getting China by the way
[2223.68s] update on China for clients. Uh they
[2226.8s] started the transfer of all US shares to
[2229.52s] Hong Kong shares. It usually takes it
[2231.76s] should be done overnight.
[2234.28s] Um so the first step was done where they
[2237.119s] get the placeholder and then you get
[2238.56s] converted out. It&#39;s 8:1 US because the
[2241.52s] Hong Kong US dollar is pegged at 8 to1
[2244.0s] conversion. So you don&#39;t have currency
[2245.44s] risk. You&#39;ll just get eight more shares
[2248.88s] for every US share. The price will be
[2250.88s] the same because the uh fixed US Hong
[2254.32s] Kong dollar peg. Uh so we&#39;re doing that
[2257.599s] to hedge. We we think it will be an
[2259.359s] unnecessary hedge, but we&#39;re keeping
[2260.96s] 100% of our options in the US because
[2262.88s] there&#39;s no way to replicate in uh Hong
[2266.56s] Kong. And uh but our options bucket has
[2269.68s] always been the huge high expected value
[2273.44s] and willingness to uh take our our risk
[2277.52s] is quantified by our sizing and then the
[2279.92s] stock we&#39;re not willing to accept that
[2281.359s] risk. So Navaro and all the hawks can do
[2284.16s] whatever the hell they want. we are uh
[2286.56s] set up because even if the options um
[2291.44s] get impacted uh the stock will more than
[2294.32s] make up for it over time because the
[2295.839s] fundamentals of the business continue to
[2297.44s] improve. They continue to generate huge
[2300.16s] cash flow 25 billion 20 25 billion a
[2302.8s] year. Uh leader in AI leader in middle
[2306.079s] class recovery leader in everything that
[2307.839s] we&#39;ve covered and um one of the lowest
[2310.8s] multiples relative to growth. It&#39;s it&#39;s
[2312.56s] such an incredible story and we&#39;re so
[2314.16s] grateful to be a part of it. And we&#39;re
[2315.52s] grateful to Xi Jinping for taking so
[2317.68s] long to clean things up because it
[2319.2s] enabled us to have twice the size
[2320.64s] position that we would have had if he
[2322.32s] fixed it right away. 37% of US imports
[2325.119s] from China are intermediate goods used
[2327.28s] in US production. So that&#39;s why both
[2329.28s] parties need a deal. That&#39;s why the
[2331.28s] Navaro has been hidden under a rock and
[2333.28s] Lutnik and Besson has been at the
[2335.119s] forefront because they figured out uh
[2338.079s] that
[2339.4s] um it&#39;s not as black and white as it
[2341.92s] seems and more rational heads need to
[2344.8s] come to the table to rebalance but not
[2348.0s] to flip everything on its head which
[2350.4s] ultimately winds up hurting us. So we&#39;re
[2352.56s] going to get a lot of extraction here.
[2354.16s] We&#39;re going to get a lot of benefits.
[2355.599s] It&#39;s probably net net potentially good
[2358.96s] if it resolves right that we went in
[2361.52s] this direction. How we did it is up for
[2364.32s] debate and I&#39;m the first one to admit
[2366.079s] that. Uh the fact that we did do it
[2369.599s] probably needed to be done. Uh and um
[2372.88s] and I think it&#39;s going to resolve like
[2374.88s] like I said all through the crisis when
[2376.8s] everyone&#39;s hair was on fire is welcome
[2380.0s] to Trump 2.0 same as Trump 1.0. a new
[2383.839s] tweet, new set of volatility resolves to
[2387.28s] the upside over time. Okay? And that&#39;s
[2389.44s] all you need to if you if you need
[2391.2s] anything else, whether you&#39;re Democrat
[2392.72s] or Republican
[2394.8s] um for the next three and a half years,
[2397.04s] just write it down. Put it on your
[2399.0s] computer. Welcome to Trump 2.0. Same as
[2402.0s] Trump
[2402.839s] 1.0. New tweet, new volatility resolves
[2406.64s] to the upside over time. Okay. Um, here
[2411.119s] is
[2412.359s] the estimated global position of
[2414.96s] systematic metro. These are the CTAs
[2417.119s] that got smoked, all sold in the hole at
[2419.04s] the exact wrong time, just like they did
[2420.64s] during COVID. And then they&#39;ll have to
[2422.48s] chase up on the way up as deals are
[2424.88s] announced and everyone sees that there
[2426.88s] was a method to the madness. We&#39;re going
[2428.88s] to be very nice. Trump vows lower
[2431.04s] tariffs on China. So down from 145 to
[2434.88s] lower to start
[2436.599s] negotiations then you know I don&#39;t know
[2440.16s] they said they aren&#39;t meeting. He says
[2441.76s] he&#39;s not lowering tariffs but it just
[2443.76s] keeps getting leaked. So there&#39;s
[2445.04s] probably a reason for that structural
[2446.88s] breakout for the euro. This is something
[2448.64s] that people didn&#39;t expect. The looney is
[2450.32s] going up as well. These are other themes
[2452.0s] that we&#39;ve been consistently pounding
[2453.52s] the table. Retail net buying of S&amp;P 500
[2456.48s] single stocks. Like I said hedge funds
[2458.319s] were the morons selling in the hole.
[2459.839s] Retail were buying. They&#39;ve been right
[2461.76s] since COVID. They&#39;ll continue to be
[2463.2s] right. Dollar most overvalued since the
[2465.44s] Plaza Accord. We&#39;ve laid out the idea of
[2468.079s] a Mara Lago accord and probably part of
[2470.64s] a package deal will be an accepted deval
[2473.599s] of currency in lie of higher tariffs
[2476.56s] just like happened at the Plaza Hotel in
[2480.44s] 1988. Well, it was it&#39;s the second term.
[2483.28s] I think it was first quarter of 1988.
[2485.2s] It&#39;s the second term might have been 86.
[2487.599s] Second term of uh
[2489.48s] Reagan.
[2491.48s] Uh Tesla net income
[2494.839s] dropping. Uh you got to believe in
[2497.28s] robots to buy this story, you know. Uh
[2500.319s] I&#39;ll leave it there. We we&#39;ve never
[2501.92s] owned it. We&#39;ve never shorted it. Uh we
[2504.88s] don&#39;t have to play. We That&#39;s the thing
[2507.04s] that you really have to understand if
[2509.04s] you want to be a good investor. Just
[2511.04s] because everyone&#39;s talking about
[2512.24s] something doesn&#39;t mean you have to be
[2513.92s] involved. You want to get involved with
[2516.16s] great businesses when no one&#39;s talking
[2518.319s] about them, not when everyone&#39;s talking.
[2520.319s] There&#39;s still huge risk when everyone&#39;s
[2522.56s] talking. Capex intentions. You know what
[2524.72s] I love about Alibaba right now? No one&#39;s
[2526.319s] really talking about it other than the
[2527.76s] dellesting nonsense. Uh which now we&#39;ve
[2530.16s] hedged hedged against that risk. Uh
[2533.359s] again, probably unnecessarily, but just
[2535.599s] need to do it in the case of prudence.
[2539.4s] Um that&#39;s that. uh equity sector flows
[2542.96s] starting to flow back into technology.
[2545.44s] Uh starting to flow
[2548.2s] into what is that green? Healthc care
[2551.28s] that&#39;ll be good. Uh roughly two and five
[2553.76s] home sellers is starting to give
[2555.599s] concessions to buyers. Uh here is from
[2558.72s] Brendan Ahern. Baba&#39;s holdings from
[2560.24s] Chinese investors via southbound stock
[2562.24s] connect now eight now
[2566.04s] 8.554%. So remember that was a key theme
[2568.48s] last year. We said get ready after
[2570.079s] August once they this the uh stock
[2572.56s] connect opens for
[2574.76s] BABA and mainland Chinese investors can
[2578.48s] buy Alibaba for the first time ever.
[2580.8s] Imagine being able to buy Amazon for the
[2583.2s] first time ever. Uh it&#39;s going to
[2585.76s] continue to flow and that&#39;s exactly
[2587.28s] what&#39;s happened. 20 some odd billion
[2589.04s] dollars and probably a lot more to come.
[2590.96s] Prices bottom before earnings in bare
[2593.2s] markets. So earnings probably will
[2595.68s] continue to come down because of all the
[2597.28s] capex that stopped in the last 3 weeks.
[2599.839s] You could say necessarily or
[2601.44s] unnecessarily depending on your views.
[2603.44s] But bottom line, it froze up a lot of
[2605.119s] capex spending. I hope it&#39;s worth it. Uh
[2609.119s] but so expect more bad news about
[2611.359s] earnings and guidance and and uh
[2613.28s] probably the the markets bottomed uh in
[2615.52s] anticipation of that if we don&#39;t retest
[2618.079s] the lows. But I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going
[2619.599s] to go much lower than where where we hit
[2623.28s] uh in early April as I said two weeks
[2626.2s] ago. Um and we went through the analoges
[2629.599s] of 2018 and 2011 etc. Traders Cloud 6.6
[2633.28s] billion into leverage long ETFs. Median
[2636.64s] gross
[2637.72s] margin is uh recovered from 2022. A
[2641.599s] little bit of step back here uh but
[2643.76s] headed back towards record. We&#39;ll see if
[2645.599s] that can be sustained. That&#39;s going to
[2647.04s] depend a lot on tariffs. M&amp;A is slowing.
[2650.56s] Okay. So, this is having knock-on
[2652.64s] effects that we&#39;re going to hear about
[2653.68s] for the next 3 months. Just like COVID
[2655.92s] market bottomed in uh March
[2659.319s] 23rd, 2020. Negative headlines until
[2662.88s] August. The market was already up 50%.
[2665.52s] Uh buyback authorizations have increased
[2667.92s] 19% year-to date. Not only are they
[2669.839s] buying their own shares in this
[2671.28s] uncertainty, but corporate insiders are
[2673.92s] buying a lot of stock. uh Zwag breath
[2676.319s] thrust which we recently had uh three 1
[2680.88s] month later market up 5% 3 months later
[2684.44s] 8.6% 6 months later 16% these are all
[2687.599s] averages uh one year later 23%. So, a
[2690.8s] lot of things have happened in recent
[2692.0s] weeks that point to very good things
[2693.76s] happening over the next 6 to 12 months.
[2695.92s] And based on some of the rational headed
[2697.92s] comments coming out of the White House,
[2700.16s] uh that that looks like a decent
[2702.16s] probability. Now, cash-like ETFs, but
[2705.359s] look, when the robins are singing, it&#39;s
[2707.119s] already spring, you know, and in many
[2708.88s] cases, you missed it. Uh, in this case,
[2711.92s] there&#39;s still enough to do, but uh,
[2714.319s] really my hat is off for all of the
[2716.56s] existing clients uh, and new clients
[2719.52s] that put in new money when I said now&#39;s
[2721.52s] the time. Uh, and those who held their
[2724.48s] wits about them as well, whether if you
[2726.48s] weren&#39;t in a position to put in new
[2727.76s] money, maybe you have a lot of illquid
[2729.28s] private equity and other things that you
[2731.2s] couldn&#39;t get out of. Um, kudos for just
[2734.72s] hanging tough and know trusting the
[2736.319s] process and knowing the intrinsic value
[2738.64s] of the businesses you own was intact and
[2740.8s] uh and now they&#39;re rebounding and and
[2742.48s] off to off to the races. Whether we hit
[2744.48s] new highs in four months or eight
[2745.92s] months, it&#39;s it&#39;s really immaterial. The
[2747.92s] key is you held pat when so many others
[2750.56s] flushed in the hole. Uh particularly
[2752.88s] hedge funds to be honest with you. Uh
[2754.88s] all these cowboys that were on super
[2756.8s] long levered long mag 7, they&#39;re smoked
[2758.96s] and most of them are liquidating and now
[2760.4s] out of business. S&amp;P 500 returns a year
[2764.24s] after spike in policy uncertainty index.
[2776.2s] Uh with the exception of 2001 which was
[2780.16s] 911 and 2006 which was the housing
[2782.72s] crisis the
[2785.16s] other 89 instances have been monstrous
[2788.24s] between 9.7% and 63%. That&#39;s amazing.
[2792.24s] scorecard on buying the dip. Average
[2793.76s] return for S&amp;P 500 following drop of at
[2795.76s] least 5% over two days. 200 days later,
[2798.48s] you&#39;re up 10%. So again, China firms
[2801.44s] announced biggest buyback in 14 months.
[2804.48s] That includes Alibaba. Insider buying
[2807.28s] and selling. Uh insiders now starting to
[2810.16s] buy in a material way. That&#39;s uh very
[2813.04s] very key. Number of containers ships
[2815.28s] selling from China to the US. So that&#39;s
[2817.92s] dropped off quite a bit. That&#39;s why that
[2819.76s] that should get everyone to the table
[2821.28s] here to come up with something
[2822.48s] reasonable uh which does you know can
[2825.359s] help China achieve what they want to do
[2827.2s] which is more domestic consumption and
[2829.92s] help the US what we we want to do
[2832.24s] slightly more domestic
[2834.68s] manufacturing active listings on the
[2836.88s] rise for real estate new home sales
[2839.8s] top all estimates on surge in the south
[2843.76s] uh all the federal lands are going to be
[2845.119s] open we showed you the map a few weeks
[2846.72s] ago southwest as a matter of In fact,
[2848.96s] there&#39;s a ton of federal land here on
[2851.04s] the Big Island, and I was telling the
[2852.96s] helicopter pilot, maybe Trump&#39;s going to
[2854.48s] open it up for development. They didn&#39;t
[2855.76s] want to hear that. It&#39;s always nimi, not
[2857.52s] in my backyard. But, uh, I can imagine
[2860.0s] that they would be in high demand if
[2861.839s] they started to do that. A AI bull bear
[2864.56s] spread below 20. So, this is a record,
[2868.0s] uh, level of bearishness. That&#39;s
[2869.76s] obviously inflection points. Soft data
[2871.599s] has recently surprised to the downside
[2873.119s] amid hard data resilience.
[2876.319s] So people are getting more negative even
[2878.319s] though the data is showing strength. The
[2880.88s] actual
[2884.28s] data spending growth is not weakened
[2886.56s] among the highest income households.
[2888.16s] Higher income households own around 90%
[2890.56s] of all corporate equities and mutual
[2893.16s] funds. That&#39;s the top
[2895.88s] 20% in income quintile. That&#39;s a big
[2898.8s] quintile by the way. Total return over
[2901.2s] 30 years. Gold versus the S&amp;P 500. not
[2904.0s] even close for everyone chasing gold. Uh
[2906.559s] S&amp;P has dramatically uh outperformed.
[2909.359s] Manufacturing employment as a share of
[2911.2s] total employment has been declining
[2912.8s] steadily for 80 years even after the US
[2916.079s] MCA. Past two weeks have seen historic
[2918.72s] breath. This is from Carson. Good things
[2921.359s] happened 12 months out all year since
[2923.76s] 1950 up about double digits. Personnel
[2927.04s] is policy. So as Bessant has taken the
[2929.359s] helm, returns have been positive. As
[2931.76s] Lenik and Navaro had spoken, returns
[2934.16s] have been negative. Equity leadership
[2936.319s] cycles and peaks, US versus developed
[2938.559s] markets, US versus emerging markets. You
[2940.8s] can see we are at an absolute extreme.
[2943.52s] And yes, it started dramatic
[2945.119s] outperformance in the first quarter this
[2946.64s] year. This is just the beginning of the
[2948.8s] beginning. This is like the introduction
[2950.96s] to the book and then like the prologue.
[2953.28s] Like we&#39;re not even in chapter one. So,
[2955.2s] if you don&#39;t have international
[2956.319s] exposure, as we&#39;ve been pounding the
[2957.76s] table on, and the right international
[2959.599s] exposure, uh, you&#39;re not going to do as
[2962.079s] well as you&#39;ve done looking in the
[2964.16s] rearview mirror through looking through
[2966.559s] the windshield. Moving
[2973.96s] forward, White House considers slashing
[2977.44s] China tariffs to deescalate trade war.
[2980.72s] China signals openness to US trade
[2982.72s] talks, but not under duress.
[2984.88s] for our country. China&#39;s patriots are
[2987.119s] buying the dip in equities. US chip
[2989.839s] controls will benefit China&#39;s Nvidia
[2992.079s] rivals like Huawei say analysts. Of
[2994.559s] course they will. China Tech groups
[2996.559s] unintended consequences of emotional
[2999.0s] policymaking. China Tech groups and by
[3001.2s] the way Deepseek and Quinn 2.5 all of
[3006.2s] these LLMs that are that are absolutely
[3011.359s] destroying chat GPT and others were made
[3014.88s] by necessity, not by design per se. Um
[3019.2s] uh the chips that they&#39;re developing
[3020.72s] internally, all this stuff wouldn&#39;t have
[3022.96s] happened. We could have kept them
[3024.16s] dependent on us. Instead, we forced them
[3026.559s] to innovate. Uh, which is kind of
[3028.48s] against what they&#39;ve done historically.
[3030.16s] They prefer to copy. But now, we&#39;ve
[3032.16s] forced them to innovate and now they&#39;re
[3033.839s] forced to be reckoned because they&#39;re
[3034.88s] they&#39;re eating our lunch in AI. And, uh,
[3037.52s] and that trend is going to continue. Uh,
[3039.839s] China tech groups lead multi-billion
[3041.839s] dollar campaign to help exporters sell
[3043.599s] at home domestic consumption. Who&#39;s the
[3045.2s] toll taker? 40 cents of every dollar?
[3047.28s] Ali effing baba. Okay. China accelerates
[3050.96s] budget spending to counter tariff wos.
[3053.28s] Huge stimulus spending. Uh Baba is going
[3056.8s] to be the biggest toll taker there. Hong
[3058.48s] Kong stock rise on China stimulus. Hope
[3060.24s] ignore Wall Street selloff. Auto groups
[3062.48s] lobby Trump administration against parts
[3064.72s] tariffs in rare unified message. So this
[3068.4s] is a big deal for Cooper Standard. US
[3071.04s] officials mole easing tariffs target the
[3073.2s] auto industry. Uh March sees best new
[3076.48s] vehicle affordability in 45 months, but
[3078.8s] tariffs loom and large. Uh we know that
[3082.16s] except they&#39;ve got to now replenish the
[3083.92s] inventory. So the game is on. Trump&#39;s
[3086.24s] U-turns on Powell. China follow dire
[3089.52s] economic warnings. Trump team needs a
[3092.24s] trade deal to stop investor panic.
[3093.92s] That&#39;s from Charlie Gaspirino over at
[3095.76s] Fox Business. He&#39;s right. I think we
[3098.4s] probably get one from India or we
[3100.16s] probably get one from South Korea or we
[3102.24s] probably get one from Japan. But we get
[3104.64s] one and then everyone falls in line and
[3106.72s] we rock and roll. Vietnam kicks off
[3108.559s] trade talks with us as plain deal takes
[3112.64s] shape. Uh they&#39;ll get some of Chinese
[3114.8s] planes. It&#39;s hedge funds, not foreign
[3117.119s] investors that have been dumping stocks,
[3118.8s] says JP Morgan. Hartnet amid apocalyptic
[3122.16s] sentiment, a bullish road map emerges.
[3124.64s] He&#39;s one of the best strategists on the
[3126.24s] street from Bank of America. We we cite
[3128.48s] his Bank of America fund manager survey
[3131.119s] every single month. Deutsche Bank sees
[3133.28s] major dollar decline amid selloff.
[3135.92s] That&#39;s typical European pessimists
[3138.079s] always downgrade in the hole. Uh even
[3140.64s] though we remain uh intermediate term
[3143.599s] bearish on the dollar based on the type
[3145.599s] of people getting bearish after the
[3147.52s] fact, I expect a short-term bounce in
[3149.76s] the dollar. Boeing to sell some of its
[3151.92s] navigation business in $10.55 billion
[3155.2s] deal. So you add the cash at $24 billion
[3158.64s] plus the undrawn credit line of10
[3160.76s] billion plus the uh sale now of $10.5
[3165.04s] billion about net 10 after taxes coming
[3168.16s] to Boeing. Uh you&#39;ve got $44 billion of
[3172.72s] liquidity with $53 billion of debt. So
[3176.88s] the rumors of my demise have been
[3178.559s] greatly exaggerated for everyone who had
[3180.8s] been saying Boeing could go bankrupt.
[3183.68s] You&#39;ve got brain damage. Uh Boeing&#39;s got
[3186.24s] a half a trillion dollar backlog and you
[3188.559s] were the ones that were selling at 130
[3191.04s] and now it&#39;s at 173 going to 250 and
[3194.16s] beyond. Boeing to seek FAA approval this
[3198.0s] year to increase 737 max production as
[3201.119s] losses narrow. They&#39;re up to 38 planes a
[3203.359s] month on the 737 Max going to 42 going
[3206.88s] beyond. They are rocking and rolling.
[3209.04s] Kelly Ortberg is a winner. He did a four
[3212.079s] bagger in seven years at Rockwell
[3213.68s] Collins. is going to do the same thing
[3215.599s] at Boeing. Intel plans to spend slash
[3218.64s] more than 20% of its workforce. The
[3220.72s] stock is rising. Trump FDA sends a
[3223.44s] bullish signal to biotech. New
[3225.28s] commissioner Marty McCari&#39;s vow to back
[3228.0s] innovation might ease fears stoked by
[3231.2s] the health and human services chief uh
[3234.96s] Robert Kennedy
[3237.4s] Jr. Disney stock is worth buying. Don&#39;t
[3241.52s] sweat the recession risk analyst says.
[3244.0s] We agree. Again, these are the people
[3246.24s] that were selling at $83. Now it&#39;s
[3248.48s] probably I don&#39;t know what it did today.
[3250.319s] Probably mid 90s already. Going to be
[3252.559s] over 100 again. Going to be over 200 in
[3254.64s] a handful of years or less. Etsy touts
[3257.44s] shopping domestically as tariffs
[3259.359s] threaten price increases for imports.
[3261.28s] This thing&#39;s a cash machine. She talks
[3263.28s] about Depop and the reselling website
[3265.68s] that&#39;s crushing it among the younger
[3267.68s] kids, the millennials and the Gen Z,
[3270.4s] etc. Americans are obsessed with protein
[3272.72s] and is driving nutrition experts nuts.
[3275.119s] That&#39;s a play for Horell, which we&#39;ve
[3278.24s] talked about. US new home sales top all
[3280.48s] estimates on surge in South. That helps
[3283.44s] the Stanleys, that helps the Generax,
[3285.599s] that helps the QXO&#39;s i.e. Beacon roofing
[3289.359s] supply. And now we&#39;ve got uh hopefully
[3292.88s] our
[3295.52s] um sloomer stuff from RBC. There we go.
[3298.96s] Let&#39;s take a look at some of the
[3300.319s] technicals because we&#39;re in crazy times.
[3302.8s] We have to look at the silly
[3304.52s] charts. So, uh we probably hit some
[3307.359s] resistance here coming up next week.
[3309.28s] This downtrend line at 48 5484. Now that
[3313.68s] everyone&#39;s happy, we probably go up a
[3315.2s] little more. Maybe we retest 5100. Maybe
[3318.0s] we don&#39;t. But um I think the bottom is
[3321.28s] in or or certainly I wouldn&#39;t expect
[3324.4s] more than a retest, but I don&#39;t I don&#39;t
[3326.319s] expect that. I I think 5100 test would
[3328.64s] look good. Or we could blast right
[3330.16s] through on good news, which would really
[3332.16s] take everyone by surprise, which would
[3334.0s] also be pretty exciting because we did
[3335.52s] enough buying in the hole.
[3338.359s] Um that&#39;s the weekly. Here&#39;s the dollar.
[3341.52s] Probably goes a little lower. Everyone&#39;s
[3343.04s] getting pessimistic. Maybe it finds some
[3344.72s] support here, bounces back up, and then
[3346.88s] everyone will when everyone gets bullish
[3348.559s] on the dollar again, that&#39;s when we&#39;ll
[3349.92s] resume the downtrend. Gold at a
[3352.72s] Fibonacci extension level. I I don&#39;t I
[3355.28s] could care less about gold. It&#39;s a
[3356.799s] nonpro productive asset. But you&#39;re just
[3359.2s] betting on some sucker coming in after
[3361.44s] you and paying a higher price. Uh
[3363.44s] usually it&#39;s the central banks that buy
[3364.799s] at the top. I love when people say, &quot;Oh,
[3366.72s] the central banks are buying.&quot; They&#39;re
[3368.319s] always the last ones to buy right before
[3370.0s] the top and then you&#39;re going to get
[3371.119s] some Mara Lago accord or some deval of
[3373.92s] the dollar and that will be it. That&#39;ll
[3376.079s] be the final harrah and gold will be
[3377.68s] dormant for another 5 to 10 years. Um,
[3381.2s] and you know what, I&#39;m a stock guy.
[3383.68s] Don&#39;t even take that take that with a
[3385.119s] grain of salt. I could care less what
[3386.48s] happens to gold prices. So, if it keeps
[3388.24s] going higher, God bless. Hope you make a
[3390.16s] ton of money. Keep buying high and
[3391.52s] hoping to sell it to someone else
[3392.96s] higher. Um, but not for us. cleared for
[3396.319s] takeoff stock market and sentiment
[3397.839s] results. Here&#39;s Boeing. Uh, you know,
[3400.4s] this is all known. We know what was
[3402.24s] happening. We just we&#39;ve just basically
[3403.839s] covered the
[3405.48s] liquidity. We&#39;ve covered the key points.
[3407.76s] They&#39;re turning the corner. Their free
[3409.599s] cash flow was negative, but it&#39;s going
[3411.2s] to be positive by the second half. It
[3412.88s] was much less negative than anticipated.
[3415.44s] That was the biggest news. The
[3417.119s] production is looking good. The
[3418.88s] engineering focus is looking good. The
[3420.88s] backlog increased to over a half a
[3422.88s] trillion dollars this quarter. And uh up
[3425.92s] until a few days ago, you couldn&#39;t give
[3427.52s] the stock away. Now people are getting
[3429.04s] the message and they&#39;ll really be
[3430.559s] chasing after it after it hits 200 when
[3433.04s] no one wanted it when we were on Vney at
[3435.28s] 130. So
[3437.47s] [Music]
[3439.079s] um it&#39;s not that often you get to buy
[3441.92s] such a clear duopoly at such low prices.
[3445.52s] I mean something like that happens a
[3447.119s] couple times in a career and uh and it
[3449.68s] just recently happened. So I hope you
[3451.119s] all took advantage. That&#39;s one of our
[3452.64s] largest positions, by the way, in the
[3454.559s] US. Uh
[3457.2s] [Music]
[3459.0s] um maybe I have to check that. It may it
[3462.96s] might be as it might almost be the size
[3464.799s] of Cooper Standard. Maybe more. I got to
[3467.44s] check where that is now. Um not for long
[3470.72s] though. Cooper&#39;s Cooper&#39;s going to be
[3472.319s] way more than a double. I can assure you
[3473.839s] that. That&#39;s our our view on that. We&#39;ve
[3475.68s] covered that many times. Uh so free cash
[3478.72s] flow usage was good. commercial backlog
[3481.04s] grew by more than 25
[3487.079s] billion. Okay, let me just get this
[3489.52s] thing going here. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t
[3491.68s] have my proper mouse with me down in
[3496.44s] Hawaii. 787 production starting to
[3500.559s] increase. 7 737 at 38 going to
[3505.24s] 42. Uh then
[3507.96s] 52 is where it was at peak back in 2018.
[3512.16s] They&#39;ll get back there with approvals
[3513.599s] over time. Uh tariff exposure, they
[3517.119s] basically went through
[3518.92s] that and
[3520.56s] [Music]
[3524.119s] uh talked about the impact. It&#39;s it&#39;s
[3526.799s] not as material as people were afraid
[3528.799s] of. Net annual impact of tariffs on
[3533.44s] input costs is less than $500 million
[3536.0s] annually. That&#39;s very very important.
[3537.76s] That&#39;s kind of dimminimous for a company
[3540.079s] of this size. Uh and the deals are
[3542.64s] probably going to get better. They got
[3544.079s] the digital aviation solutions sold to
[3546.319s] Toma Bravo. Uh 777X received FAA
[3551.119s] authorization for additional aerodynamic
[3553.68s] brakes and engine testing with daily
[3555.28s] flights ongoing and performing well.
[3558.839s] Uh, and obviously they got the big F f47
[3562.64s] contract worth $50 billion with the US
[3564.799s] government and this time it&#39;s going to
[3565.839s] be a profitable contract versus previous
[3568.16s] fixedpric contracts that carried undue
[3570.4s] risk and turned into money losing
[3572.04s] ventures. Uh, all six KPIs continue to
[3575.2s] perform well and show stability with
[3576.559s] every m metric currently in the green
[3578.799s] including final ticketing which had been
[3581.28s] below required thresholds during Q4. Uh
[3584.559s] you can go through the earnings call. We
[3587.52s] highlighted the important parts here
[3592.28s] and let me just see if there&#39;s anything
[3602.52s] else. Sentiment as you can see all the
[3606.24s] active managers got washed out at the
[3608.72s] lows. 35% equity exposure. Now, this is
[3611.359s] going to turn around and move back up to
[3613.68s] 100 and then everyone will want it and
[3616.0s] that&#39;s when you can lighten up in the
[3617.44s] short term. REITs uh top 30 weights
[3621.04s] estimates in the
[3623.48s] last 60 days. Um down
[3628.599s] 2.93% for 2025, up for next year. So,
[3631.92s] we&#39;re going to start to see a lot of
[3632.96s] backend loaded stuff. Utilities, let&#39;s
[3635.52s] see what they did. Um down 64 basis
[3639.52s] points. That&#39;s not bad. These estimates
[3641.52s] will continue to come down on a lagged
[3643.28s] effect from the tariff stuff, but the
[3645.68s] bottom may have priced in the worst and
[3647.76s] then they&#39;ll start to recover over time
[3649.68s] like we see in every major
[3654.359s] 20%
[3656.76s] correction. Uh economic
[3659.96s] data, nothing really crazy. Durable
[3663.2s] goods orders were f unbelievable. a lot
[3665.92s] of pull forward that cars that that cash
[3668.0s] flow is going to help Cooper uh up 9.2%
[3672.0s] versus 2.1%. A lot of that&#39;s car
[3675.119s] related, durables excluding defense up
[3677.799s] 10.4%. This was a big big deal. Uh
[3681.839s] initial jobless claims
[3683.88s] 222,000. That&#39;s why you&#39;ve got Waller
[3686.319s] and the Cleveland governor out talking
[3688.88s] about June as a possible cut if jobs if
[3692.319s] we start to lose jobs. Atlanta GDP Fed
[3694.799s] now has got the uh administration
[3697.44s] finally on alert. You&#39;re getting your
[3698.96s] negative uh first quarter probably of
[3701.0s] GDP. Uh so get your act together or
[3703.68s] you&#39;re going to get two quarters and the
[3704.88s] recession is going to cost you more than
[3706.64s] all the trouble you&#39;ve caused uh in
[3708.799s] terms of Doge and in terms of tariffs.
[3712.4s] uh the cost uh and the amount of
[3715.04s] spending you&#39;ll have to do to get us out
[3716.4s] of a recession is going to dwarf what
[3719.119s] you have made in tariffs and what you
[3722.24s] have made in Doge cuts. So the moral of
[3724.319s] the story is take yes for an answer.
[3727.28s] Take the win. You&#39;ve got more tariffs
[3729.44s] than you&#39;ve ever had. Uh and you can
[3731.839s] save a recession if you pivot very
[3733.92s] quickly and businesses can start to
[3735.599s] invest again and it will be a good thing
[3737.599s] all around and you will look like a
[3740.64s] hero.
[3742.88s] But push it harder and get a recession
[3745.44s] and then you got double triple loss. Uh
[3748.4s] and you get wiped out in the midterms
[3750.24s] completely handcuffed for the for the
[3752.64s] remaining two years if you screw this
[3754.64s] up. So um that&#39;s that. You can see 20 26
[3760.079s] estimates going up. Uh 2025 haven&#39;t
[3763.599s] really come down a lot. I mean the most
[3765.119s] optimistic was ever 275 sometime late
[3768.48s] last year. So down to 267, it&#39;s not a
[3771.119s] huge hit. Those will probably keep
[3772.799s] coming down and next year we&#39;ll keep
[3774.48s] coming up, which
[3776.68s] should be able to stabilize the market
[3779.359s] because the market may be able to look
[3781.04s] through that. So with that said, let&#39;s
[3783.599s] get down to the ask me anything
[3785.2s] questions from our
[3787.72s] incredible audience.
[3791.4s] Um, and for those of you who don&#39;t like
[3794.16s] the ask me anything questions, thanks
[3795.76s] for tuning in. We&#39;ll see you next week,
[3798.16s] same time, back in California. Uh, for
[3801.52s] those of you who do love it, let&#39;s get
[3803.52s] started company by company, question by
[3806.44s] question. Uh, Drew Burn, Drew Brin, Drew
[3811.039s] is a big supporter. Drew Burn has been
[3814.0s] with us for many years. Hi, Tom. Hope
[3816.0s] you and your family had a great time in
[3817.28s] Hawaii. Still here, man. A few more
[3819.28s] hours. Uh, as Scott&#39;s Miracle Grow has
[3823.039s] been really beaten down. grateful for
[3824.24s] your thoughts on it and position sizing.
[3826.4s] Thanks. Uh I&#39;ll never discuss position
[3828.48s] sizing because that&#39;s proprietary for my
[3830.559s] clients. Um and part of the secret sauce
[3833.52s] in addition to the derivative overlay
[3836.559s] that we do for excess returns without
[3838.319s] drawing major leverage. But uh as it
[3840.799s] relates to SMG, which we do not hold a
[3842.88s] position, but we do like the idea, maybe
[3845.68s] maybe more than like the idea here
[3847.52s] because we do want to get some A
[3849.52s] exposure.
[3851.359s] Um, the problem here is what I hate
[3854.559s] about what they did is they went crazy
[3857.079s] on the uh the weed trade when there all
[3861.76s] that hype was there and they got
[3863.799s] shellacked. Um, they chased a trend
[3866.319s] versus sticking to their knitting and it
[3868.319s] hurt them
[3869.799s] badly, but probably not badly enough for
[3872.4s] the stock to be down this much. So, I do
[3874.64s] like it here, Drew. I think you&#39;re on
[3876.4s] your game and I I think your time is
[3878.88s] pretty good.
[3880.319s] um you know, if you bought a bunch at
[3882.839s] 53, even if it went down to 40 before it
[3885.76s] starts to recover, I think you&#39;re in
[3887.28s] good shape. Let me just check out the
[3888.72s] balance sheet before you go uh start
[3891.599s] your research process.
[3908.119s] Um, all right. Let&#39;s see
[3912.599s] here. Can&#39;t make it that small.
[3925.119s] That should
[3929.799s] work. All right.
[3933.799s] So, 72 million of
[3939.559s] cash.
[3945.64s] $2.5 billion dollars of debt. That could
[3949.28s] be a problem, my friend. That&#39;s going to
[3951.839s] be the key issue. They&#39;re going to have
[3953.76s] to raise some type of capital, and I
[3956.799s] don&#39;t know if they&#39;re going to be able
[3957.76s] to hit the debt markets with that amount
[3960.76s] of So, this is the problem you have with
[3963.44s] this one. This is a really bad balance
[3965.76s] sheet.
[3967.68s] You&#39;re going to have to figure
[3969.319s] out how much undrawn credit
[3973.4s] is and what is the cyclicality of their
[3976.4s] cash. It seems like maybe their cash
[3979.44s] peaks in the third quarter uh based on
[3983.2s] planting season that that that would
[3984.88s] make
[3986.039s] sense,
[3988.92s] but I&#39;m not thrilled with this. So,
[3991.52s] you&#39;re going to have to understand how
[3992.88s] they plan on staying in business. I&#39;m
[3994.559s] sure they will, but at what cost are
[3996.799s] they going to dilute you with equity?
[3998.72s] How much debt is coming due? What is
[4001.119s] their cash flow situation like? Let&#39;s
[4003.28s] take a look at
[4012.68s] that, man. How can you screw up a
[4015.119s] business like
[4024.76s] this? So, they did generate a half a
[4027.359s] billion dollars of free cash flow last
[4028.96s] year,
[4030.359s] though. So, this is going to be going
[4032.559s] through all the conference calls. I
[4036.76s] mean, you gota you you really have to be
[4040.319s] damn certain about solveny risk on this
[4043.2s] one before you buy a share. And you
[4045.68s] know, just at first blush without
[4047.28s] starting my research process, this one
[4049.92s] is not making me that comfortable uh
[4054.4s] anytime soon. So, I I got to understand
[4057.2s] what they&#39;re saying about liquidity on
[4058.88s] the conference calls. I have to look at
[4061.28s] the cap table, see when maturities come
[4063.359s] due. I got to see how sustainable this
[4066.16s] free cash flow was from last year. Um,
[4070.16s] and if I can get some comfort, then I
[4072.079s] can start to build a position. But, uh,
[4074.079s] this is not looking good, my friend. So,
[4076.48s] be very cautious as you start your
[4078.4s] research process. As much as I wanted
[4080.559s] that to be a win for you, I don&#39;t I&#39;m
[4082.64s] not sure. Alex C. Hey,
[4085.72s] Tom. Uh uh for it seems like modeling
[4090.319s] skills are heavily prioritized, but I
[4092.319s] struggle to see the value in building
[4093.599s] something like a DC DCF. What sort of
[4096.56s] course you have to build a DCF, Alex?
[4098.48s] Alex, like that&#39;s table stakes. That&#39;s
[4101.199s] that&#39;s not going to give you an edge.
[4102.799s] That&#39;s that&#39;s like a starting point.
[4104.48s] That&#39;s like that&#39;s bread and butter.
[4106.88s] It&#39;s like learning your alphabet before
[4108.719s] you read. So yes, you have to do that.
[4111.52s] Uh and then you have to to get a lot
[4114.239s] deeper into all the public filings, all
[4117.12s] the earnings call transfer, all the
[4119.199s] channel checks, all competition checks,
[4121.92s] all I mean
[4124.319s] uh Alex, I&#39;m going to suggest what I
[4126.96s] suggest to every young person. Number
[4128.719s] one, read the intelligent investor by
[4130.88s] Ben Graham. That&#39;ll save you a lot of
[4132.319s] time. You might just decide after
[4133.759s] reading that. If you don&#39;t get it right
[4135.12s] away after reading the intelligent
[4136.319s] invest, just go become an entrepreneur
[4138.799s] and make your fortune that way. There&#39;s
[4140.159s] so many different ways to make money.
[4141.92s] Um, I find too many people want to get
[4144.359s] into the investing world because they
[4146.64s] think that&#39;s the shest way to wealth.
[4148.319s] And for the if you&#39;re coming into this
[4150.799s] business because you think that&#39;s how
[4154.4s] it&#39;s it&#39;s the best way to make money,
[4156.719s] uh, you&#39;re going to fail. If you&#39;re
[4158.239s] coming into the business because it&#39;s
[4159.44s] all you want to do 24 hours a day, uh,
[4162.4s] then you&#39;ve got a shot. Okay? And and
[4165.199s] this type of stuff is stable stake. So
[4167.279s] read the intelligent investor. If it
[4168.64s] clicks, then start start reading the CFA
[4170.799s] books. Do all three levels. Uh, and
[4173.12s] that&#39;ll give you a
[4174.52s] basic understanding of the language of
[4177.199s] the business. And then it just comes
[4178.96s] from experience over and over. But yeah,
[4180.96s] you got you got to learn all the
[4182.159s] modeling. You got to learn all the
[4183.279s] basics. Uh, and then that&#39;s not going to
[4186.719s] give you an edge. That&#39;s just going to
[4188.08s] invite you to the party, okay? To speak
[4190.48s] the language. It&#39;s like if you go to,
[4192.719s] you know, the south of France and you
[4194.239s] get invited to a party and it&#39;s all
[4195.76s] French people. Well, table stakes is you
[4198.4s] need to learn how to speak French or
[4199.76s] you&#39;re going to be, you know, so, okay,
[4202.48s] so then you can speak French. It doesn&#39;t
[4204.4s] mean that people are going to like you,
[4205.92s] okay? It just means that, you
[4208.04s] know, you&#39;re in the game, okay? Uh, and
[4212.4s] um, and there&#39;s a lot more to it.
[4214.84s] So Brad K
[4217.719s] asks,
[4220.12s] &quot;Alcoa,
[4223.8s] AA, this has always been a really bad
[4227.239s] business and a poorly run business. So
[4230.48s] I&#39;m going to just say no because I&#39;ve
[4232.32s] seen so many
[4234.199s] opportunities to buy it and uh passed
[4238.159s] every time and invariably was proved
[4240.719s] correct.
[4242.36s] Um they do seem to be inflecting here. I
[4245.76s] just fig they seem to chronic and and
[4248.64s] again this just comes from experience.
[4250.719s] There&#39;s something cultural about Alcoa
[4254.239s] that they continue to seem to
[4257.08s] snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
[4259.92s] over and over and over. Maybe this
[4261.92s] time&#39;s different. If there&#39;s a new CEO,
[4264.239s] maybe take another look. But um this is
[4266.88s] a business
[4268.04s] that I&#39;ve never owned and never
[4270.96s] regretted not owning. Let&#39;s put it that
[4272.719s] way. Uh let&#39;s take a look at the balance
[4276.6s] sheet. I remember they used to have that
[4278.96s] CEO with the accent who would come on
[4281.12s] every single quarter and Wall
[4282.96s] Street uh till his eyes were brown. but
[4285.36s] he had such a sophisticated accent that
[4287.28s] they believed all his and he
[4289.12s] lost them so much money that eventually
[4290.64s] they kicked him out and he had to go
[4292.239s] build this fake town for Saudi Arabia
[4294.159s] that doesn&#39;t even exist now. Uh and um
[4298.0s] he did as good a job with that project
[4299.76s] as he did with Alcoa and uh needless to
[4302.48s] say the city does not exist and I don&#39;t
[4304.8s] think he&#39;s running the project anymore.
[4308.199s] Um next week we&#39;ll cover how Tom really
[4312.08s] feels about a company. Uh let&#39;s just
[4314.32s] talk here. So revenues seem to be
[4316.0s] ramping
[4318.6s] up. Earnings inflecting from being
[4324.44s] negative. Ebida is starting to
[4331.56s] recover. It&#39;s just so inconsistent. It&#39;s
[4334.32s] so cyclical. You&#39;re trying to make the
[4336.0s] cyclical trade, which I understand that.
[4338.56s] I&#39;m okay with that. But
[4344.08s] I I I don&#39;t want to play the timing game
[4345.92s] with this because this the good the good
[4348.239s] times never last with Alcoa. So, if you
[4350.64s] get a few string a few quarters and the
[4352.32s] stock doubles,
[4354.6s] great. Um balance sheet looks
[4358.92s] okay. They&#39;ll find a way to screw you.
[4361.28s] Maybe they&#39;ll issue a ton of shares as
[4363.52s] the stock goes up, but they just have
[4365.84s] never been a shareholder wind type of
[4368.8s] company.
[4370.56s] Where is the shares outstand? Yeah. So,
[4373.52s] they did it
[4374.76s] already. They were at 184 million
[4377.36s] shares. Boom. Like magic. They added 34
[4381.76s] million shares in the last 12 months or
[4384.08s] between 2023 and 2024. I I I
[4390.199s] literally hate management like that. I
[4393.04s] literally cannot stand management that
[4394.8s] does so hard no right there. Unless they
[4399.199s] fired the CEO since this offering was
[4401.199s] done, I want nothing to do with it. Like
[4403.36s] Brad Jacobs did an offering on QXO. And
[4406.159s] you can say, &quot;Well, why don&#39;t you hate
[4407.28s] Brad?&quot; Because Brad&#39;s got a billion
[4409.199s] dollars of his own money in it before
[4410.88s] they did the offering, before they found
[4413.12s] Beacon Roofing. So if he if he&#39;s hurting
[4416.32s] me, he&#39;s hurting himself a lot more. He
[4418.96s] wouldn&#39;t do the offering to hurt
[4421.679s] himself. He would do it because he saw
[4424.159s] it was a growth path forward. It was a
[4426.159s] necessary thing to get it done to get
[4428.4s] Beacon done and he&#39;s doing it and now
[4430.56s] he&#39;s got his platform and the game is
[4432.159s] just beginning. Again, this is one you
[4434.239s] tuck away and in 5 to 7 years you have a
[4437.28s] multibagger. Whether it&#39;s 5x, 8x, 12x, I
[4441.04s] don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve modeled it to seven or
[4443.199s] 8x based on he likes to get 15% of the
[4446.159s] industry and double digit ebid on
[4448.08s] margins yada yada yada. But um it it
[4452.159s] really doesn&#39;t matter. you&#39;re going to
[4453.36s] so far so dramatically outperform
[4455.76s] anything else you could do that it it
[4458.48s] deserves a position in the portfolio.
[4460.32s] Nothing is ever a guarantee. That&#39;s why
[4461.76s] it&#39;s a position. Not your whole mortg
[4464.56s] mortgage your house,
[4466.6s] but a serious position because this guy
[4469.44s] has made so much incredible amounts of
[4471.44s] money for shareholders over and over and
[4474.239s] over throughout his career. And he&#39;s got
[4475.76s] the most skin in the game, personal skin
[4477.44s] in the game, than he&#39;s ever had in any
[4479.36s] other deal. In QXO, he only put in 150
[4481.84s] million. In URI, he put in less. So,
[4485.199s] there you go. Uh, Leaf Foster, what do
[4488.08s] you think of Petra Boss? We covered this
[4489.679s] a million at times. The financials look
[4491.199s] fine, but you have a socialist in power,
[4492.96s] so at any moment in time, they could cut
[4495.199s] the dividend. They haven&#39;t done it yet.
[4496.64s] They may never do it, but
[4499.4s] it&#39;s it&#39;s not a game I want to play.
[4502.8s] Aaron L, thank you for all you do. I
[4505.199s] find your weekly video very extremely
[4506.96s] valuable, especially during those
[4508.08s] periods of peak uncertainty. The
[4509.6s] consistency you bring is truly
[4510.92s] admirable. Thank you, Aaron. That&#39;s very
[4513.199s] kind of you say. Was hoping you could
[4514.56s] take a look at at core ATKR company
[4517.6s] offers conduit fittings and various
[4519.04s] other electrical infrastructure related
[4520.84s] parts with its manufacturing operations
[4523.199s] and customers concentrated in the US.
[4525.44s] Okay, I think we looked at this one a
[4527.92s] couple weeks ago. ATKR
[4535.679s] So okay, so prices declined with
[4537.36s] revenues and cash flows. So what you
[4539.12s] need to prove out in order to take a
[4542.64s] stab at this is what&#39;s the turnaround
[4546.6s] plan
[4552.36s] and you know this is a serious broken
[4555.44s] momentum stock and this is where you can
[4557.76s] get trapped. you know, you have a stock
[4559.52s] that was a 10bagger and then it comes
[4561.48s] down, you know, 60% in a short period of
[4565.52s] time. It&#39;s probably going to take two or
[4567.6s] three years to build the base on this.
[4569.44s] I&#39;m willing to be wrong on that, but
[4572.84s] um that turnaround plan is probably just
[4579.64s] beginning
[4581.719s] solution
[4583.64s] polys. All right, let&#39;s take a look at
[4585.84s] some financials.
[4597.44s] So revenues have dropped off from 4
[4599.6s] billion down to three
[4603.56s] billion give or take.
[4613.28s] Free cash flow
[4615.0s] is almost
[4620.92s] haved. Balance sheet 350 million of
[4624.44s] cash. $700 million debt. That&#39;s probably
[4634.92s] okay. Share count has come down a lot.
[4638.56s] All right. So all there is to do here uh
[4641.6s] Aaron is you got to start your research
[4643.199s] process. How are they going to turn it
[4644.56s] around? Does it look credible? What have
[4646.08s] they said in the past and what&#39;s
[4647.36s] happened? What have they been saying the
[4648.88s] last eight quarters as revenues and and
[4650.56s] cash flow have been declining? And if
[4652.48s] you can get comfortable that their
[4654.56s] turnaround plan is plausible and you
[4658.64s] verify by looking at competitors and
[4660.64s] seeing what competitors are are saying
[4662.32s] in the space and doing channel checks
[4666.44s] and doing it. You might have it, but
[4668.719s] just taking a look at it, I think it&#39;s
[4670.48s] way, way too early. It&#39;s a broken It&#39;s a
[4673.44s] broken Momo stock. Any thoughts on Flow
[4676.48s] Traders, Europe&#39;s leading market maker?
[4680.12s] Uh, that&#39;s a business I tend to
[4683.159s] avoid or flow. What? F
[4688.04s] L Flow Traders.
[4699.28s] Yeah, looks like your cash flow
[4702.12s] peaked four years ago. Never looked
[4704.88s] back. The stock price is going up
[4706.4s] without the cash flow. It&#39;s a pass for
[4710.92s] me. Theo
[4715.719s] Djardan Apache we covered in the past.
[4718.56s] It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s not great. The reason
[4721.12s] that we&#39;re not not as sanguin is we love
[4724.0s] our com stock.
[4726.16s] [Music]
[4727.64s] Um yeah, I I I think we said yes to this
[4731.84s] a few times. We just prefer com stock
[4734.159s] and we covered all the reasons why. So
[4735.84s] go back to the last few weeks of
[4737.88s] podcast. Uh buying more VF Corp. You
[4740.56s] bet. Yeah. All new clients got VF Corp
[4742.88s] as a full position. So uh nothing to
[4745.44s] think about there. That&#39;s just tariff
[4746.96s] noise and BS. You still got the same
[4748.64s] winner running the show uh turning
[4750.88s] things around and the tariffs will be
[4752.8s] what the tariffs are, but their their
[4754.64s] business modes are going to be their
[4756.0s] business modes and they&#39;re they&#39;ve got
[4758.32s] they&#39;ve done the Dtock. They&#39;re now
[4760.239s] going to ramp it up and Bracken&#39;s done
[4762.32s] this a gazillion times with different
[4764.4s] brands going back to his PNG days with
[4766.64s] Old Spice, then Logitech, 26 Bagger, and
[4769.76s] it&#39;s going to do the same exact thing.
[4771.28s] if you&#39;ve got to sell a couple brands to
[4773.36s] buy a couple new more that that&#39;s what
[4775.36s] VF Corp has been doing for 125 years and
[4778.0s] they&#39;re going to do for the next 125
[4779.679s] years. So, they&#39;ve cleaned everything
[4781.36s] up. They sold they they took solveny
[4783.6s] risk off the table with Supreme. Could
[4786.0s] they sell the pack business to get a
[4787.6s] little more cash if they had to? They
[4789.12s] sure could. Uh but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll
[4791.28s] have to. Moody&#39;s reported that March
[4793.84s] Auto Sales was 175 million on an
[4796.88s] annualized basis due to pull forward.
[4799.719s] Uh, however, they believe April and May
[4801.92s] could be ugly. The inventories will
[4804.159s] still have to be rebuilt. The lobbying
[4805.92s] is in place, etc. At the end of the
[4809.159s] day, David,
[4811.46s] [Music]
[4815.48s] um, the average car on the road is still
[4818.0s] 13.5 years. So, in the worst case
[4820.08s] scenario, if the cost of a car goes up
[4822.719s] $5,000, people are going to buy smaller
[4824.64s] cars. So, it&#39;s going to go up $2,500.
[4827.52s] And then they&#39;re going to offer more and
[4828.96s] more incentives. The affordability is
[4830.48s] coming down. Why? Because the gig is up.
[4832.48s] They got away with murder during COVID
[4834.08s] because they could control supply and
[4835.6s] demand was high. Demand is even higher
[4837.679s] now. But they can no longer control
[4839.199s] supply because the Koreans are going to
[4840.96s] come in and flood their ass with cheap
[4842.8s] cars if they don&#39;t if they don&#39;t
[4844.96s] compete. Okay? And so now they&#39;re
[4847.92s] competing. They&#39;re all offering
[4849.36s] incentives. It&#39;s race to the bottom in
[4851.199s] terms of margins for the OEMs which is
[4853.6s] going to benefit the auto parts
[4856.04s] suppliers because they get paid on
[4858.88s] volumes and their prices are pre
[4860.96s] pre-negotiated in the case of Cooper
[4863.04s] Standard just finished all their
[4864.4s] negotiations in the last 6 months. Uh so
[4866.8s] they&#39;re going to mint cash on the race
[4868.8s] to the bottom with huge volumes. And
[4871.12s] like Generrack generators, the fastest
[4873.199s] growing states are the ones with the
[4874.64s] highest penetration. When your neighbor
[4876.56s] gets a new car, which on average they
[4879.36s] haven&#39;t for 13 and a half years, um
[4882.48s] everyone starts to get new cars and the
[4884.159s] game is going to be on and the
[4885.199s] incentives are going to be on and it&#39;s
[4886.56s] going to be a race to protect share by
[4888.56s] the US OEM. So, they&#39;re going to have to
[4890.48s] do more and more dealer incentives, and
[4892.96s] you&#39;re seeing it every single day on
[4894.48s] commercials, which is going to be a huge
[4896.4s] benefit for Cooper. So, you can listen
[4898.8s] to the noise in the headlines on a daily
[4900.64s] basis, or you can step back, zoom out,
[4902.88s] and actually make intelligent long-term
[4904.88s] decisions that that will make you
[4906.32s] multibags, rinse, repeat, out in three
[4908.96s] to five years onto the next. Um, auto
[4913.12s] industry aggressively lobbies. Okay, we
[4915.199s] got that one already. Uh, Peter Rardo
[4919.04s] asked a question. Literally, this is
[4920.8s] what they wrote as their name. Uh,
[4922.88s] really appreciate the great podcast.
[4924.48s] Extremely generous person. Want to ask
[4925.92s] the likelihood we get a repeat of the
[4929.32s] 70s or did we start our secular bare
[4931.92s] market in bonds being invested in energy
[4934.0s] is the best way. Thoughts on national
[4936.639s] Varco? National Varco is kind of a dog,
[4939.679s] but we&#39;ve covered it a million times. I
[4941.28s] think at these levels, you&#39;re okay.
[4943.28s] There are better ways to play it. I
[4944.88s] think if you have to play servicesers,
[4946.48s] you&#39;re probably better off going up the
[4948.48s] food chain to slumber so you can sleep
[4950.719s] easily at night. But if you want to
[4955.48s] uh dig in the dumpster, I would say
[4958.639s] Varco is probably going to be, you know,
[4961.679s] probably be a double over a few years.
[4964.0s] Again, we looked at the financials a few
[4966.159s] weeks ago. I hate to even take time to
[4967.76s] do it again. I think it was generally
[4969.44s] okay. Let me just take a quick look for
[4972.48s] solveny risk and then we can move on.
[5001.199s] Yeah, this one will be okay.
[5004.679s] Um, same conclusion we came to three or
[5007.84s] four times in the last few podcasts. All
[5010.88s] right. Uh, so here&#39;s an Australian that
[5013.76s] owns US ADRs. Should he exchange? Uh,
[5019.28s] look, I told you what we&#39;re doing. you
[5021.04s] do it, you&#39;re going to I I don&#39;t know
[5022.719s] how to You&#39;ve got to figure out how to
[5024.719s] hedge out your Hong Kong dollar risk
[5026.239s] with the Australian dollar. I&#39;m not I
[5028.08s] don&#39;t think you&#39;re pegged.
[5033.08s] Um I think this is going to be much to
[5035.44s] do about nothing, but um I&#39;m being
[5038.4s] proactive. I mean, there&#39;s no downside
[5041.04s] other than the commission to just switch
[5042.8s] them over, which is it&#39;s dimminimous.
[5046.28s] Um so, uh for us, we did it. as far as
[5049.6s] you doing it and hedging it out, talk to
[5052.159s] your financial advisor. Uh you probably
[5054.4s] do have to hedge out currency in some
[5056.36s] way, but
[5065.639s] um in your shoes, I&#39;d probably switch it
[5068.239s] over and just deal with it because
[5070.36s] like if you look, even if you had a
[5073.36s] negative currency implication of 20% and
[5076.8s] the stock doubles, who cares? So, you
[5079.12s] know, it&#39;s better than, you know, Navaro
[5082.159s] gets in the headlines and then you got
[5083.6s] to deal with nonsense that ultimately
[5086.4s] shoots our it just destroys the US
[5088.48s] investors. So, I mean, if they do
[5090.08s] dlisting, it&#39;s the dumbest political
[5092.239s] decision in the history of mankind
[5093.679s] because you&#39;ve basically evaporated $800
[5096.159s] billion of your own US investor capital.
[5098.719s] But stupider things have happened. Uh,
[5101.28s] so you can&#39;t completely rule it out,
[5103.12s] which is why we&#39;re just hedging. We&#39;re
[5104.48s] keeping all of our options in the US
[5106.0s] because we can&#39;t replicate them in Hong
[5107.44s] Kong. So, you know, maybe you do half
[5110.159s] and half. You know, if if if half gets
[5112.639s] wiped, the other half doubles, you&#39;re
[5114.8s] you&#39;re fine. And if nothing happens,
[5117.28s] everything doubles. Uh that that&#39;s
[5119.199s] another way to hedge it. But I would
[5120.88s] probably take the currency risk in your
[5122.32s] shoes. That&#39;s opinion, not advice.
[5125.4s] Um Jimmy
[5129.239s] Jones,
[5132.28s] Abomaro, what are the impact of tariffs?
[5136.159s] No one knows because no one knows the
[5137.44s] rules of the game. Okay, so we could
[5139.28s] wake up. So
[5141.08s] the when you zoom out, here&#39;s what you
[5144.08s] have to think about. What is the demand
[5146.08s] of lithium moving forward? Is it priced
[5148.08s] inexpensively or expensively? Do the
[5150.639s] players that can benefit from the the
[5152.56s] price troughing and rebounding over time
[5155.6s] with tariffs or without tariffs have the
[5158.48s] liquidity to wait through the cycle? And
[5161.84s] Albamaro is one of the biggest lithium
[5163.679s] producers in the world. They&#39;ve got $3.5
[5165.12s] billion of liquidity. So as whether
[5168.719s] there&#39;s a 20% or 0% or 50% or 145%
[5173.12s] tariff, they&#39;re still going to have the
[5174.719s] most share and demand for lithium is not
[5177.04s] going to change. So as far as
[5178.88s] handicapping whether a 20% tariff will
[5181.28s] hurt earnings by this month or 30 and
[5183.28s] guessing and pretending you have some
[5184.719s] edge, there is no edge. The edge is do
[5187.199s] you want the one of the biggest share
[5189.12s] companies in the business with ample
[5191.12s] liquidity to sit through the trough of
[5192.639s] the cycle uh and to own it at an
[5194.719s] enormous discount to intrinsic value
[5196.96s] with or without tariffs? And if the
[5198.96s] answer is yes, I would like one of the
[5200.8s] biggest players that has ample liquidity
[5202.48s] to ride it out because it&#39;s a huge
[5204.239s] hockey stick of operating leverage as
[5205.84s] prices come back and all the small
[5207.12s] players get blown out, then Albamaro is
[5209.52s] for you and that&#39;s why we own it. So,
[5211.52s] good question and thank you for being a
[5214.719s] regular listener and contributor. Eric
[5222.12s] F. Uh he&#39;s asking about ones that we&#39;ve
[5224.96s] uh talked about in the past. So, we had
[5227.6s] um we don&#39;t spend a lot of time on on
[5229.679s] the winners. We&#39;ve done uh Vornnado.
[5232.08s] We&#39;ve done uh um uh Range Resources.
[5235.6s] We&#39;ve done um Rolls-Royce. We&#39;ve done uh
[5240.4s] Wells Fargo, we&#39;ve done uh Exxon Mobile
[5243.36s] during co we we&#39;ve done a bunch of them
[5245.6s] uh that that we&#39;ve publicly talked about
[5247.199s] and a bunch that we&#39;ve done in private.
[5248.96s] We did the the Google and the um
[5252.239s] Alphabet and Amazon we bought in uh fall
[5254.719s] of 2022 when no one wanted it. uh and we
[5258.159s] bought the uh sold them in July of last
[5260.639s] year. They went up again before crashing
[5263.44s] in the first quarter. So we looked like
[5264.96s] we were early. We were right. Um we did
[5272.6s] um Yeah. So So that&#39;s just a sampling.
[5275.36s] So, you know,
[5276.92s] every 6 months we probably bring on one
[5279.92s] or two more new names and then we close
[5282.639s] out one or two names and we talk about
[5284.96s] them uh and and so on and so forth. So,
[5287.44s] welcome to the podcast. You&#39;re obviously
[5288.88s] new um and glad to have you on board.
[5292.159s] So, with that said, we&#39;ll be back next
[5293.92s] week, same time, same place. In the
[5295.199s] meantime, make it a great one. Bye for
[5297.92s] now. Actually, new place coming back to
[5300.32s] you from California next week. Have a
[5302.719s] great one. Bye for now.
